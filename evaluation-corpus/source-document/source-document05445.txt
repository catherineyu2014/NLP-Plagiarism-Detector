TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS OF THE NEGRO RACE, THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED, WITH THE HOPE THAT IT MAY
HELP INSPIRE THEM WITH A BELIEF IN THEIR OWN POSSIBILITIES

PREFACE

It seems eminently fitting and proper in this year, the fiftieth anniversary of the Proclamation
of Emancipation that the Negro should give pause and look around him at the things which he
has done, those which he might have done, and those which he intends to do. We pause, just
at the beginning of another half century, taking stock of past achievements, present conditions,
future possibilities.

In considering the literary work of the Negro, his pre-eminence in the field of oratory is
striking. Since the early nineteenth century until the present time, he is found giving eloquent
voice to the story of his wrongs and his proscriptions. Crude though the earlier efforts may
be, there is a certain grim eloquence in them that is touching, there must be, because of the
intensity of feeling behind the words.

Therefore, it seems appropriate in putting forth a volume commemorating the birth of the Negro
into manhood, to collect some few of the speeches he made to help win his manhood, his place
in the economy of the nation, his right to stand with his face to the sun. The present volume
does not aim to be a complete collection of Negro Eloquence; it does not even aim to present
the best that the Negro has done on the platform, it merely aims to present to the public some
few of the best speeches made within the past hundred years. Much of the best is lost; much
of it is hidden away in forgotten places. We have not always appreciated our own work sufficiently
to preserve it, and thus much valuable material is wasted. Sometimes it has been difficult
to obtain good speeches from those who are living because of their innate modesty, either in
not desiring to appear in print, or in having thought so little of their efforts as to have
lost them.

The Editor is conscious that many names not in the table of contents will suggest themselves
to the most casual reader, but the omissions are not intentional nor yet of ignorance always,
but due to the difficulty of procuring the matter in time for the publication of the volume
before the golden year shall have closed.

In collecting and arranging the matter, for the volume, I am deeply indebted first to the living
contributors who were so gracious and generous in their responses to the request for their
help, and to the relatives of those who have passed into silence, for the loan of valuable
books and manuscripts. I cannot adequately express my gratitude to Mr. John E. Bruce and Mr.
Arthur A. Schomburg, President and Secretary of the Negro Society for Historical Research,
for advice, suggestion, and best of all, for help in lending priceless books and manuscripts
and for aid in copying therefrom.

Again, we repeat, this volume is not a complete anthology; not the final word in Negro eloquence
of to-day, nor yet a collection of all the best; it is merely a suggestion, a guide-post, pointing
the way to a fuller work, a slight memorial of the birth-year of the race.

THE EDITOR.

JAMES E. SHAPARD Is the Game Worth the Candle?

So large a number of abolitionists, convened from different sections of the country, is at
all times and under any circumstances, an interesting spectacle to the eye of the philanthropist,
how doubly delightful then is it, to me, whose interests and feelings so largely partake in
the object you have in view, to behold this convention engaged in solemn deliberation upon
those subjects employed to promote the improvement of the condition of the African race.

* * * * *

Assembled as this convention is, for the promotion and extension of its beneficent and humane
views and principles, I would respectfully beg leave to lay before it a few remarks upon the
character, condition, and wants of the afflicted and divided people of Hayti, as they, and
that island, may be connected with plans for the emigration of the free people of color of
the United States.

God in the mysterious operation of his providence has seen fit to permit the most astonishing
changes to transpire upon that naturally beautiful and (as to soil and productions) astonishingly
luxuriant island.

The abominable principles, both of action and belief, which pervaded France during the long
series of vicissitudes which until recently she has experienced, extended to Hayti, or Santo
Domingo have undoubtedly had an extensive influence upon the character, sentiments, and feelings
of all descriptions of its present inhabitants.

This magnificent and extensive island which has by travellers and historians been often denominated
the "paradise of the New World," seems from its situation, extent, climate, and fertility peculiarly
suited to become an object of interest and attention to the many distinguished and enlightened
philanthropists whom God has been graciously pleased to inspire with a zeal for the promotion
of the best interests of the descendants of Africa. The recent proceedings in several of the
slave States toward the free population of color in those States seem to render it highly probable
that that oppressed class of the community will soon be obliged to flee to the free States
for protection. If the two rival Governments of Hayti were consolidated into one well-balanced
pacific power, there are many hundred of the free people in the New England and Middle States
who would be glad to repair there immediately to settle, and believing that the period has
arrived, when many zealous friends to abolition and emancipation are of opinion that it is
time for them to act in relation to an asylum for such persons as shall be emancipated from
slavery, or for such portion of the free colored population at present existing in the United
States, as shall feel disposed to emigrate, and being aware that the authorities of Hayti are
themselves desirous of receiving emigrants from this country, are among the considerations
which have induced me to lay this subject before the convention.

The present spirit of rivalry which exists between the two chiefs in the French part of the
island, and the consequent belligerent aspect and character of the country, may at first sight
appear somewhat discouraging to the beneficent views and labors of the friends of peace; but
these I am inclined to think are by no means to be considered as insurmountable barriers against
the benevolent exertions of those Christian philanthropists whose sincere and hearty desire
it is to reunite and pacify them.

There seems to be no probability of their ever being reconciled to each other without the philanthropic
interposition and mediation of those who have the welfare of the African race at heart. And
where, in the whole circle of practical Christian philanthropy and active beneficence, is there
so ample a field for the exertion of those heaven-born virtues as in that hitherto distracted
region?

Had the venerable prophet in the foregoing predictions alluded expressly and entirely to the
actual moral, political, and above all, to the religious character and condition of the Haytians,
he could scarcely have given a more correct description of it.

For there is scarcely a family whose members are not separated from each other, and arrayed
under the banners of the rival chiefs, in virtual hostility against each other. In many instances
the husband is with Henry, and the wife and children with Boyer, and there are other instances
in which the heads of the family are with Boyer, and the other members with Henry.
