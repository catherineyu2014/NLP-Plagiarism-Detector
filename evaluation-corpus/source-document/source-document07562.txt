AUTHORS AND THEIR PUBLIC IN ANCIENT TIMES

A Sketch of Literary Conditions and of the Relations with the Public of Literary Producers,
from the Earliest Times to the Fall of the Roman Empire.

Second edition, revised, 12°, gilt top, $1.50.

The book abounds in information, is written in a delightfully succinct and agreeable manner,
with apt comparisons that are often humorous, and with scrupulous exactness to statement, and
without a sign of partiality either from an author's or a publisher's point of view.--New York
Times.

In two volumes, 8°, cloth extra (sold separately), each $2.50 Vol. I., 476-1600--Vol. II.,
1500-1709.

It is seldom that such wide learning, such historical grasp and insight, have been employed
in their service.--Atlantic Monthly.

It is a book to be studied rather than merely praised. . . . That its literary style is perfect
is acceptable as a matter of course, and equally of course is it that the information it contains
bears the stamp of historical verification.--N. Y. Sun.

laws at present in force in the chief countries of the world; together with a report of the

March, 1896. 8°, gilt top, $1.75.

A perfect arsenal of facts and arguments, carefully elaborated and very effectively presented.
. . . Altogether it constitutes an extremely valuable history of the development of a very
intricate right of property, and it is as interesting as it is valuable.--N. Y. Nation.

BY MOSES COIT TYLER

       *       *       *       *       *

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE DURING THE COLONIAL TIME

New Edition, revised, in two volumes. Volume I.--1607-1676. Volume II.--1676-1765. Each $2.50.
Agawam edition, 2 vols. in one. 8°, half leather, $3.00.

"In the execution of his work thus far, Professor Tyler has evinced a skill in the arrangement
of his materials, and a masterly power of combination, which will at once place it in a very
eminent rank among American historical compositions. It is not so much the history of a special
development of literature, as a series of profound and brilliant studies on the character and
genius of a people of whom that literature was the natural product.

THE LITERARY HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION

1763-1783

Two volumes, large octavo. Sold separately. Volume I.--1763-1776. Volume II.--1776-1783. Each
$3.00.

This work is the result of an altogether new and original treatment of the American Revolution.
The outward history of that period has been many times written, and is now, by a new school
of American historians, being freshly re-written in the light of larger evidence, and after
a more disinterested and judicial method. In the present work, for the first time in a systematic
and complete way, is set forth the inward history of our Revolution,--the history of its ideas,
its spiritual moods, its passions, as these uttered themselves at the time in the writings
of the two parties of Americans who either promoted or resisted that great movement.

THREE MEN OF LETTERS

Chapters in Literary Biography and Criticism devoted to George Berkeley, Timothy Dwight, and
Joel Barlow.

12°, gilt top, $1.25.

"Though more lengthy than most of the sketches in Professor Tyler's well-known 'History,' these
monographs have much of the brevity of their original purpose; and they are marked by the same
picturesqueness of treatment, the same vivacity of expression, and the same felicity of statement,
that characterize the author's larger volumes."--The Nation.

SOME COMMON ERRORS OF SPEECH.

Suggestions for the Avoiding of Certain Classes of Errors, together with Examples of Bad and
of Good Usage. By ALFRED G. COMPTON, Professor in College of the City of New York. 12°     $ .75

"The book calls up many interesting, not to say fascinating, lapses from strict grammar, and
is very valuable. In its index expurgatorius will be found many surprises by the self-supposed
learned."--Chicago Times-Herald.

A SIMPLE GRAMMAR OF ENGLISH NOW IN USE.

By JOHN EARLE, A.M., LL.D., Professor of Anglo-Saxon, University of Oxford, author of "English
Prose: Its Elements, History, and Usage." 12°         $1.50

"The book is a clear, careful, and scholarly treatise on the English Language and its use,
rather than a work of science. It is a book that will be valuable to teachers and to students
of language everywhere."--Washington Times.
