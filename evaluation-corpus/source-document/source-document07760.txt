TO JOHN PERCIVAL, ESQ.

OF THE U. S. NAVY,

Who, under the auspices of Government, visited the Mulgrave Islands, to release the survivors
of the Ship Globe's crew, and extended to them every attention their unhappy situation required--the
following Narrative is most respectfully dedicated, by

        WILLIAM LAY, &
        CYRUS M. HUSSEY,

INTRODUCTION.

Formerly whales were principally taken in the North Seas: the largest were generally found
about Spitzbergen, or Greenland, some of them measuring ninety feet in length. At the commencement
of the hazardous enterprize of killing whales, before they had been disturbed by man, they
were so numerous in the bays and harbours, that when taken the blubber was for the most part
boiled into oil upon the contiguous coast.

The pure oil and whale bone were only preserved in those days; consequently a ship could carry
home the product of a greater number of whales than a ship of the same size now can.--Indeed,
so plentiful were the whales in those seas, and taken with such facility, that the ships employed,
were not sufficient to carry home the oil and bone, and other ships were often sent to bring
home the surplus quantity. But the coasts of these countries, were soon visited by ships from
Denmark, Hamburgh, and Holland, as well as from England; and from frequently being killed in
the shoal water near the coasts, the whales gradually receded from the shores, and have since
been found only in deeper water, and at a much greater distance from the land.

In the earlier stages of the whale fishery, of which we are now treating, the ships were generally
on the whaling waters, early in May, and whether successful or not, they were obliged to commence
their return by the succeeding August, to avoid the early accumulation of ice in those seas.
But it not unfrequently happened, that ships procured and returned with a cargo in the months
of June and July, making a voyage only about three months, whereas, a voyage to the Pacific
Ocean is now often protracted to three years!
