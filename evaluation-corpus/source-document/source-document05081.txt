"JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER."

No one would have believed in the first years of the twentieth century that men and modistes
on this planet were being watched by intelligences greater than woman's and yet as ambitious
as her own. With infinite complacency maids and matrons went to and fro over London, serene
in the assurance of their empire over man. It is possible that the mysticetus does the same.
Not one of them gave a thought to Wenus as a source of danger, or thought of it only to dismiss
the idea of active rivalry upon it as impossible or improbable. Yet across the gulf of space
astral women, with eyes that are to the eyes of English women as diamonds are to boot-buttons,
astral women, with hearts vast and warm and sympathetic, were regarding Butterick's with envy,
Peter Robinson's with jealousy, and Whiteley's with insatiable yearning, and slowly and surely
maturing their plans for a grand inter-stellar campaign.

The pale pink planet Wenus, as I need hardly inform the sober reader, revolves round the sun
at a mean distance of [character: Venus sigil] vermillion miles. More than that, as has been
proved by the recent observations of Puits of Paris, its orbit is steadily but surely advancing
sunward. That is to say, it is rapidly becoming too hot for clothes to be worn at all; and
this, to the Wenuses, was so alarming a prospect that the immediate problem of life became
the discovery of new quarters notable for a gentler climate and more copious fashions. The
last stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us still remote, had embellished their charms,
heightened their heels and enlarged their hearts. Moreover, the population of Wenus consisted
exclusively of Invisible Men--and the Wenuses were about tired of it. Let us, however, not
judge them too harshly. Remember what ruthless havoc our own species has wrought, not only
on animals such as the Moa and the Maori, but upon its own inferior races such as the Wanishing
Lady and the Dodo Bensonii.

The Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with quite un-feminine accuracy. Had our
instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed their preparations. Similarly pigs, had they
wings, might fly. Men like Quellen of Dresden watched the pale pink planet--it is odd, by the
way, that for countless centuries Wenus has been the star of Eve--evening by evening growing
alternately paler and pinker than a literary agent, but failed to interpret the extraordinary
phenomena, resembling a series of powder puffs, which he observed issuing from the cardiac
penumbra on the night of April 1st, 1902. At the same time a great light was remarked by Idos
of Yokohama and Pegadiadis of Athens.
