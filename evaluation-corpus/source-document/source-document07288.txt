                   Psalme 150.
      O praise God in his holinesse, &c.

All the Psalmes of Dauid are comprised in two words, [a]Halleluiah, and Hosanna, that is, blessed
be God, and God blesse; as being for the greater part either praiers vnto God for receiuing
mercies, or else praises vnto God for escaping miseries. This our present Hymne placed as a
[b]Conclusion of the whole booke; yea, the beginning, middle, end, to which all the rest (as
[c]Musculus obserueth are to be referred) inuiteth vs in prescript and postscript, in title,
in text, in euery verse, and in euery Clause of euery verse to praise the Lord. Teaching these
two points especially:

  1. For what  } God is to be magnified.
  2. With what }

For what, vers. 1, 2.

With what, euen with all that is

    Without vs, vers. 3. 4. 5. Praise him in the sound of the
      trumpet, &c.

    Within vs, vers. 6. Omnis spiritus, &c. Let euery spirit
      praise the Lord, praise yee the Lord.

This in briefe is the whole texts Epitomie, I come now to the words Anotomie, cutting vp euery
part and particle seuerally, beginning first at the first, O praise God in his holinesse. Of
which one sentence the Doctors haue many (though not aduerse yet diuerse) readings, especially
three: Praise God in his Saints, praise God in his sanctitie, praise God in his sanctuarie.
S. Hierome, Augustine, Prosper, and [d]other as well ancient interpreters as moderne translate
here praise God in his Saints. For if he must be praised in all his creatures, how much more
in his new creatures? if in the witlesse wormes, and senselesse vapours, Psal. 148, much more
doubtlesse (as Theodorit here collects) in men, in holie men, in Saints, vpon whom hee hath
out of his [e]vnsearchable riches of mercie, bestowed the blessings of the [f]life present;
and of that which is to come.

  [Sidenote f: 1. Tim. 4. 8.]

First, almightie God is to be blessed for giuing his Saints such eminent gifts of grace for
the good of his Church, and for the setting foorth of his glorie. So Chrysostome, Basil, Euthymius,
Prosper, Placidus, Parmensis expound it. [g]Euery good and perfit gift is from aboue, descending
from the father of lights, a good thought in a saint is gratia infusa, a good word in a saint
is gratia effusa, a good deed in a saint is gratia diffusa, through his grace which is the
God of [h]all grace, saints are [i]whatsoeuer they are. Wherefore praise the Lord in his Saints,
often remember their vertues as their true reliques, and as it were bequeathed [k]legacies
vnto Gods people. So the wise man, Ecclesiasticus 44. Let vs now commend the famous men in
old time, by whom the Lord hath gotten great glorie, let the people speake of their wisdome,
and the congregation of their praise. So the Confession of Bohemia, chap. 17. [l]Wee teach
that the Saints are worshipped truly, when the people on certaine daies at a time appointed,
doe come together to the seruice of God, and doe call to minde and meditate vpon his benefits
bestowed vpon holie men, and through them vpon his Church, &c. And for as much as it is kindly
to consider, opus diei in die suo, the worke of the day[m] in the same day it was wrought;
it is well ordered by the Church of England, that the most illustrious and remarkable qualities
of the saints are celebrated vpon their proper festiuals, that on S. Stephens day, we may learne
by S. Stephens example to loue our enemies: on S. Matthewes day, to forsake the world and to
follow Christ: on S. Iohn the Baptist his day, to speake the truth constantly, and to suffer
for the same patiently. Thus in stedfastnes of faith and godlinesse of life (non legere modò
sed degere sanctorum vitas, as [n]one wittily) to bee followers of them as they were followers
of Christ; is (as [o]blessed Latymer was wont to say) the right worshipping of Saints, and
of God in his Saints.

Againe, for as much as there is a communion of Saints, as we cõfesse in the Creed, a knot of
fellowship betweene the dead Saints and the liuing; it is our dutie to praise God for their
good in particular, as they[p] pray to God for our good in generall. It is required on our
part I say, to giue God most humble thanks for translating th{~e} out of this [q]valley of
teares into Hierusalem aboue, where they be [r]clothed with long white robes, hauing palmes
in their hands, and [s]crownes of gold on their heads, euer liuing in that happie kingdome
without either dying or crying, Apocal. 21. 4. and this also (in the iudgment of Augustine,
Hierome, Hugo, Raynerius, and other) is to praise God in his Saints.

  [Sidenote q: Psal. 84. 6.]

  [Sidenote r: Apocal. 7. 9.]

  [Sidenote s: Apocal. 4. 4.]

These reasons are the grounds of certaine holy daies established in England by law, namely
to blesse God for his Saints eminent grace while they were liuing, and exceeding glorie now
they be dead. Wherein our Church ascribes not any diuine worship to the Saints, but all due
praise to the sanctifier: in celebrating their memorie (saith Augustine) we neither adore their
honour, nor implore their helpe: but (according to the tenour of our text) wee praise him alone,
[t]who made them both men and martyrs. In the words of [u]Hierome to Riparius: Honoramus reliquias
martyrum, vt eum cuius sunt martyres adoremus: honoramus seruos, vt honor seruorum redundet
ad dominum: If thou desire to doe right vnto the Saints, esteeme them as paternes, and not
as patrones of thy life; honour them only so farre, [x]that thou maist alway praise God in
them, and praise them in God.

The gunpowder men erre very much in this one kinde of honouring God, for either they worship
his Saints as himselfe, or else their owne saintlings, and not his Saints. In praying to the
dead, in mingling the blood of their martyrs with the precious blood of their Maker, in applying
their merits, and relying vpon their mercies; it is plaine that they make the Saints (as Melancthon
tels them in his [y]Apologie for the Confession of Auspurge) quartermasters with God, and halfe
mediatours with Christ, I say ioynt mediatours not of incercession only but of [z]redemption
also. Nay they make the blessed Virgin vpon the poynt their only mediatrix and aduocate, so
they sing, and so they say. They sing in their publique seruice, [aa]Maria mater gratiæ, mater
misericordiæ, &c. the which is Gods owne stile, 1. Pet. 1. 10. & 2. Cor. 1. 3. so they likewise
say, Maria consolatio infirmorum, redemptio captiuorum, liberatio damnatorum, salus vniuersorum.
[ab]Giselbertus in lib. altercationis Synagogæ et ecclesiæ, cap. 20. Maria quasi maria, saith
Augustinus de Leonissa, sermon 5 vpon Aue maria, for as all riuers come from the seas, and
returne to the seas againe, Ecclesiastes 1. 7: [ac]so forsooth (if you will vndertake to beleeue
him) all grace is deriued from Mary, and ought to be returned again to Mary. We finde so much
in [ad]Rosario Mariæ, reparatrix & saluatrix desperantis animæ, &c. That which is worse, their
owne Pope (who cannot, as they teach, erre in a poynt of doctrine as Pope) calleth her expresly
Deam. Pet. Bembus in his epistles written in Pope Leo 10. name, lib. 8. epist. 17. printed
at Strasburg an. 1609. that which is worst of all, in their most approued Bible: they translate
Gen. 3. 15. ipsa conteret caput tuum: she shall breake thine head, although (as their owne
Iesuit [ae]Ribera confesseth honestly) the Hebrew text, the Chaldee paraphrase, the translation
of the Septuagint, and all good Latin copies reade ipse conteret, he shall bruise the serpents
head, applying it to Christ, according to that of Paul, The God of peace shall tread downe
Satan vnder your feete, Rom. 16. 20. by this euidence you may see that the gunpowder crue praise
not God in the saints, nor the saints in God: but on the contrarie the saints as God.

Againe these S. Peter men (and as I haue warrant to terme them on this day Salt Peter men)
erre from the true meaning of our text, because they doe not praise God in sanctis eius, in
his saints: but dishonour God in sanctis eorum, in saints of their owne making, vsually praying
vnto some who were no men, and to many who were not holy men. It is doubted by the two great
lights in their glorious firmament, Bellarmine and Baronius, whether there were euer any such
man as S. George, or such a woman as S. Catharine. Cardinall Bellarmine lib. de beatitudine
sanct. cap. vlt. §. respondeo sanctorum doth acknowledge that they worship certaine saints
whose stories are vncertaine, reputing the legend of S. George apocryphall according to the
censure of Pope [af]Gelasius: and Cardinall Baronius ecclesiast. annal. Tom. 2. ad an. 290.
according to the impression at Rome, fol. 650. as also de Martyrologio Romano, cap. 2. confesseth
as much of Quiriacus and Iulitta, declaring plainely that their acts are written either by
fooles or heretikes, and in his annotations vpon the Romane Martyrologie 23. Aprill, he taketh
vp Iacobus de Voragine for his leaden Legend of our English S. George, concluding in fine,
that the picture of Saint George fighting with a Dragon is symbolicall, and not historicall.
If the Scripture be true [ag]whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne: then assuredly these men
(as [ah]Paul speaks) are damned of their owne selues in their owne conscience, who (notwithstanding
all their doubts) pray still in their publike seruice, [ai]Deus, qui nos beati Georgij martyris
tui meritis & intercessione lætificas, Concede propitius, &c. An Idoll as Paul affirmes, 1.
Cor. 8. 4. is nothing, Ergo, the Papists in worshipping S. George which is nothing, commit
(euen themselues being Iudges) abominable Idolatrie.

As they worship some who were no men, so many who were not [ak]holy men, as a reuerend [al]Doctor
of our Church accutely, Non martyres domini sed mancipes diaboli: the Souldiour who peirced
Christs holy side was a Pagan,[am] neither doth any storie which is authenticall speake of
his conuersion, and yet they worship him vnder the name of S. Longinus, or Longesse, March
15. Papias (as [an]Eusebius and [ao]Hierome report) held the heresie of the Millenarians, and
yet he is honoured as a saint in the Romane Calender vpon the 22. of Februarie. Becket was
a bad subiect in his life, and no good Christian at his death, in that hee commended himselfe
and the cause of his Church vnto S. [ap]Denys and our Lady. Yet S. Thomas of Canterburie was
honoured at Canterburie in the daies of popish ignorance more then either the worlds Sauiour,
or the blessed Virgine his mother: in which relation I appeale to the records of that Church,
as also to the very stones vnder his shrine worne with the knees and hands of such as came
thither to worship him. Boccace reporteth how one Sir Chappelet a notorious Italian Vsurer
and Cousoner came to be honoured as a Saint in France. Sanders among them is a saint, albeit
he liued in plotting, and dyed in acting rebellion against his gracious Soueraigne Queene Elizabeth
of famous and blessed memorie. Nay Dauus is Diuus, Saul is among the Prophets, pater personatus,
father Parsons all the daies of his life was a perpetual Martyr, as his fellow [aq]Ribadeneira
termeth him: and yet one (who sometime was his inner man, and knew him as I presume, better
then euer did Ribadeneira) transposing the letters of Robertus Parsonius Iesuita, found this
anagramme, Personatus versuti oris abi: the wit-foundred drunkard, Henry Garnet (who did not
according to the Counsell of [ar]Paul vse vino modico: but as [as]Paulinus pretily modio) that
lecherous treacherous Arch-priest, Arch-traitor, Arch-diuell in concealing, if not in contriuing:
in patronizing, if not in plotting the powder intended massacre, is returned a Saint from beyond
the seas with [at]à sancte Henrice intercede pro nobis: his action is iustified, his life commended,
his death honoured, his miracles and memorie celebrated by that Ignatian spirit, ([au]portentum
nominis portentum hominis, hauing a great deale of name, though a very little modestie) Andreas
Eudæmon Ioannes Cydonius: but notwithstanding his apologie, the saintship of Henry Garnet is
so buffeted by the replies and antilogies of our accuratlie learned diuines, as that his straw
face will hereafter hardly be worth a straw. Catesbie, Winter, Rookwood, and the rest of the
Cole-saints and hole-saints (who laboured in the diuels mine by the Popes mint) are numbred
among the holy ones also: Babilon and Egypt praise God in them, and for them. I haue heard
much of roaring gentlemen in London and Canterburie, but if the Lord himselfe had not watched
ouer his Church, if the Lord himselfe had not written England in the [ax]palmes of his hands,
if the Lord himselfe had not kept King Iames as the [ay]apple of his eye, [az]if the Lord himselfe
had not been on our side (now may Gods Israell in England say) if the Lord himselfe had not
been on our side, when they rose vp against vs, if the Lord himselfe had not (out of his vnspeakeable
goodnesse toward vs and our posteritie) broken their snares, and deliuered our soules out of
that horrible gunpowder pit; these bellowing Buls of Basan, and Canon-mouthed hell-hounds would
haue made on this day such a roare, that all Christendome should haue felt it, and the whole
world haue feared it. [ba]O Lord God of all power, blessed be thy name, which hast this day
brought to nought the enemies of thy people,[bb] so let all thine enemies perish. O Lord, that
our[bc] mouthes may be filled with laughter and our tongue with ioy. Sint diui modo non viui,
let England hang such, although afterward Rome hallow such, he that hath an eye to see without
the spectacles of a Iesuit, will affoord as good credit to the register at Tiburne as to the
Calender of Tyber: for if these be Martyrs, I wonder who are Murtherers? If these be Saints,
I pray you who are Scythians? If these bee Catholikes, who are Canibals?

I passe to the second exposition of these wordes, O praise God in his sanctitie, so Munster,
Pagninus, Beza, Tremelius and our old translation heere, Praise God in his holinesse: now God
is holy formaliter & effectiuè, holy in himselfe, and making other holy; the Lord is glorious
in holinesse Exod. 15. 11. Wheras other Gods are famous for their vnholinesse, Venus was a
wanton, Mercurius a theefe, Iupiter a monsterous adulterer, an ingenious man (as[bd] Basile
writes) would blush to report that of beastes, which the Gentiles haue recorded of their Gods.
If such imputations are true saith [be]Augustine, quàm mali how wicked are these Gods: if false
quàm malè how wretched and foolish are these men, adoring the same things in the temple, which
they scoffe at in the theater, in turpitudine[bf] nimium liberi, in superstitione nimium serui:
so that their Gods are not as our God, euen our enemies being Iudges Deut. 32. 31. there is
none holy as the Lord 1. Sam. 2. 2. called[bg] often in holy Scripture the holy one, yea thrice
holy; holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts Esay. 6. 3. his [bh]name is holy, his [bi]law

[bm]Luther, Caluin, Vatablus, your English-Geneua bibles, & our new translation haue praise
God in his sanctuarie, the which in holy scripture signifieth either heuen, or the temple,
heauen is often called in sacred writ Gods sanctuarie, for [bn]thus saith he that is high and
excellent, he that inhabiteth eternitie, whose name is the holy one, I dwell in the high and
holy place. Christ in comming to vs is said to breake the heauens Esay 64. 1. and when he went
from vs vnto his father a cloud tooke him vp into heauen Acts 1. and frõ heauen he shal come
againe to iudge the quicke and the dead 1. Thes. 4. 16. That his sanctuarie may be taken heere
for heauen, is gathered out of the very next clause (praise him in the firmament of his power)
the which (as [bo]Caluin & [bp]other expositors haue well obserued,) is exegeticall, and expoundes
the former, as if Dauid should haue said, praise the Lord in his sanctuary, that is in the
firmament of his power, for the heauens declare the glory of God and the firmament sheweth
his handy worke Psalm. 19. 1. let all people praise God our father in heauen, especially such
as dwell with him [bq]in heauen, O praise the Lord all ye blessed Angels and Saints inhabiting
his sanctuarie which is highest and holiest.

[br]Other apply the word sanctuary to the Temple, so termed for two respects especially. 1.
because God manifesteth his holines toward vs in that holy place more principally, calling
it expresly [bs]his house. 2. a sanctuarie in regard of our holy seruice toward God, for albeit
euery day be to the good man a sabbath, and euery place a temple; yet the God of Order hath
appointed certaine times, and certaine places also, wherein hee will bee worshipped publiquely,
saying Leuiticus 19. 30. Ye shall obserue my sabbaths, and reuerence my sanctuary. For our
holines toward God concerneth vs [bt]one way in that we are men, and another way in that we
are ioyned as parts to that visible mystical body which is his Church as men, wee are at our
owne choyce both for time, and place, and forme, according to the exigence of our owne occasions
in priuate, but the seruice which is to bee done of vs as the members of a publique body, must
of necessity bee publique, and so consequently to bee performed on holy daies in holy places,
and for this doctrine the scriptures afford both patent and paterne, the patent is reported
by the Prophet Esay: Chap. 56. vers. 7. and repeated by Christ in [bu]three seuerall Euangelists:
my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. The paterns are manifold, I will
enter into thine house in the multitude of thy mercies, and in thy feare will I worship toward
thine holy temple, saith our Prophet, Psal. 5. 7. The Publican and the Pharisie went into the
temple to pray, Luke 18. Peter and Iohn went vp together into the temple at the ninth houre
of prayer, Acts 3. Anna fasted and prayed in the temple, Luke 2. This one word, sanctuarie
teacheth vs how we should behaue our selues in the Church as in Gods presence: Doest thou come
to that holie place to receiue the blessed Supper of our Lord? remember that the temple is
sanctuarium, non promptuarium, a sanctuarie, not a buttrie, [bx]haue ye not houses to eate
and drink in, despise yee the Church of God? Doest thou come to pray? [by]take heede to thy
foote when thou entrest into Gods house, compose thy knees, and eyes, and hands, and heart
after such a deuout manner: as that thou maist not onely praise God vpon the loud cymbals,
but (as it is vers. 5.) praise him vpon the well tuned cymbals also. Doest thou come to heare
the sermon? remember that the preaching of the Gospel is [bz]not the word of a mortall man,
but the [ca]power of the immortall God vnto saluation: and albeit the Preacher be neuer so
simple, neuer so sinfull; yet the word is holy, the action holy, the time holy, the place holy,
ordained by the most holy to make thee holy. Vpon whatsoeuer occasion thou commest into the
Temple, remember alwaies that the ground is holy whereon thou standest, it is a sanctuarie,
the habitation of God, and place of his holinesse: and therefore not to be [cb]prophaned with
ordinarie though lawfull worldly businesse, much lesse with vnlawfull pastimes and enterludes,
it is a place for praise, not for playes, O praise God in his sanctuarie.

Or (as [cc]Martine Luther interprets it) praise God in his sanctuarie, that is, for his sanctuarie,
for [cd]shewing his word vnto Iacob, his statutes and ordinances vnto Israel, for his adoption,
and his couenants, and his promises, and his seruice, Rom. 9. 4. O praise the Lord for his
[ce]true Church established for the present among the Iewes, and hereafter in the fulnesse
of time to be constituted among Christians vntill the worlds end. For this clause may bee construed
of the mysticall heauen and temple, so well as of the materiall heauen and temple. The good
man (I meane the true Christian) is not only Gods [cf]house, but also Gods [cg]temple, yea,
Gods heauen, as [ch]Augustine expounds the words of Christ, Our father which art in heauen,
that is, in holy men of heuenly conuersation, in whose sanctified hearts hee dwelleth as in
his [ci]sanctuarie. Archimedes in his conference with Hiero said, Giue me a place where I may
stand out of the world, and I will moue the whole earth. In like manner, he that will bee reputed
a Saint, and so take vpon him to remoue men earthly minded from their worldinesse, must himselfe
at the least haue one foote out of the world, seeking (as the blessed [ck]Apostle speakes)
the things aboue, that [cl]other may see his good workes, and glorifie God which is in Heauen,
that is (according to the true soule of our text) praise God in his Saints which are his sacrarie,
his sanctuarie, his house, his heauen.

  [Sidenote cl: Mat. 5. If I were not (according to the text and the time) foreward to
prosecute the Gunpowder men, as the more dangerous enemies of God and
his Gospell, I might vpon this ground take vp the bucklers against
idle Nouelists, vtterly condemning the festiuals of holie Saints,
established in our Church by good order of law. Their principal
obiection is taken out of Pauls Epistle to the Galathians, chap. 4.
verse 10. Yee obserue dayes and monethes, and times and yeares, I am
afraid of you, lest I haue bestowed vpon you labour in vaine. To which
answere is made, that there is a [co]foure-fold obseruation of
          {Naturall.
          {Politicall.
    daies {Ecclesiasticall.
          {Superstitious.
Of all which onely the superstitious is condemned, as Aretius and
Illiricus, and [cp]other Protestant Diuines vpon the place. Now the
superstitious obseruation is either Iudaicall or Idolatricall; it is
apparant that Paul meant the first hereof especially, [cq]because the
Galathians after they were conuerted vnto Christ, were seduced by false
teachers vnto the ceremonies of the Iewes, as concerning the Sabbaths &
the new Moones, and the like, the which were figures of Christ and had
their end in him.[cr] Are yee so foolish, that hauing begun in the
spirit, yee would now be made perfit by the flesh? As for
Idolatricall obseruing of times, it is granted easily that the
Pagans (in dedicating feasts vnto false gods, and in making
[cs]differences of daies dismall and fortunate, either by curious arts,
or by particular fansies, or popular obseruations) are worthily reputed
superstitious. And the [ct]Papists also (solemnizing holie daies of
the Saints in their Churches with idolatrous worshipping of the
creatures, and their Images: and out of their Churches with Epicurelike
belly-cheere, reuelling, & idlenesse) turn againe to the beggarly
rudiments and fashions of the world: But the festiuals of England
(celebrated according to the doctrine and Iniunctions of our Church) are
verie farre from these and all other kindes of superstition. [cu]For
then is God truly worshipped in the publike congregation, I say the
true God is truly praised in his true Saints; on our holie daies the
sacraments are rightly ministred, the Scriptures are fruitfully read,
the Word is faithfully preached; all which are maine meanes to withdraw
men not only from superstition and idolatrie, but also from all sortes
of error and impietie whatsoeuer.

Yea, but the words of the Commandement are, sixe daies shalt thou labour: Ergo, there should
be no holie day besides the Lords day. [cx]Protestant Diuines answere that the clause (sixe
daies shalt thou labour) is a permission, or a remission of Gods right, who might chalenge
to himselfe all our time for his worke, and not a restraint for any man from seruing of God
on any day. For the Iewes beside the Sabbath had diuers other feasts; as Easter, the feast
of vnleauened bread, the feast of first fruits, Whitsuntide, the feast of blowing Trumpets,
the feast of Tabernacles; all which (as we reade Leuiticus 23) they kept by Gods appointment
holie, notwithstanding these words of the law, sixe daies shalt thou labour. And so the Christian
Church in all ages hath vpon iust occasions separated some weeke daies vnto the praising of
the Lord, and rest from labour. Ioel 2. 15. Blow the trumpet in Sion, sanctifie a fast, call
a solemne assemblie. [cy]Daies of publike fasting for some great iudgement, daies of publike
reioycing for some great benefit, are not vnlawfull, but exceeding commendable, yea necessarie.
Whosoeuer doubts of the Churches libertie herein, or of the practise of this libertie, may
peruse the ninth chapter of Ester, in which it will appeare, that Gods people by the commandement
of Mordecai, did euery yeare solemnize and keepe holy the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the
moneth Adar, in remembrance of their great deliuerie from the Treason of Haman. Vpon these
grounds the last euer renouned Parliament enacted, That wee should for euer spend the prime
part of this present fifth of Nouember in praying and praising the Lord, for his vnspeakable
goodnesse in deliuering our King, Queene, Prince and States of this realme from that hellish,
horrible, bloody, barbarous intended massacre by Gunpowder. Now that I may for my part execute
the will of the Parliament (sparing the Nouelists, and referring such as desire to bee further
satisfied in this argument of holy dayes, vnto the iudicious writings of my most honoured and
honourable maister, Archbishop Whitgift, in the [cz]defence of his answere to the Admonition)
I proceede in the text, praise him in his noble acts, praise him according to his excellent

[da]Some reade Laudate eum in [db]virtutibus eius, praise him in his powers: [dc]other ob fortitudinem

different expositions; one construing it of Gods glorious [dd]Angels, and the other applying
it to Gods glorious acts: For the first it is euident in holy writ, that there bee certaine
distinctions and degrees of Angels in the quier of Heauen, there be Seraphins, Esay 6. 2. Cherubins,
Gen. 3. 24. Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers, Colloss. 1. 16. in all which and
for all which God is to be praised, as being his [de]ministring spirits for the good of such
as shall be heires of saluation; as long as wee serue God, all these serue vs, euen the Cherubins,
and Seraphins, Angels, and Archangels. I say, so long as we serue the Lord, these pages of
his honour and parts of his courts attend vs, and pitch their tents about vs: a doctrine very
profitable, very comfortable, yet for as much as I hold it lesse pertinent to the present occasion
I thus ouerpasse it, and hast to that other exposition interpreting these words (as our Church
readeth) of Gods noble acts.

Now the workes of God are of two sorts, ad intra & ad extra: some be confined within himselfe,
other extended towards vs: works of the sacred Trinitie within it selfe (as that the Father
begets, and the Sonne is begotten, and the holy Ghost proceeds from both) are wonderfull acts
of such an high nature that it is our dutie rather simply to adore, then subtilly to explore
them: all his acts extended toward vs are summarilie reduced vnto two, namely the works of
creation and redemption. [df]The worke of creation is attributed in the Masse of the matter
to God the Father, in the disposition of the forme to God the Sonne, in the preseruation of
both to God the holy Ghost. So likewise that of redemption, in election vnto God the Father,
in the consummation vnto God the Sonne, in the application vnto the holy Ghost, all which are
very noble acts, and God is to be praised in them according to his excellent greatnesse. The
worke of creation is so mightie, that none could bring it to passe but the Father almightie:
that God should haue nothing but nothing, whereof, wherewith, whereby to build this high, huge,
goodly, faire frame; is a principle which nature cannot teach, and Philosophie will not beleeue.
The worke of redemption is of farre greater might and mercy, for the making of the world was
(if I may so speke) onely lip-labour vnto God, he spake the word and it was done, he commanded
and it stood fast, Psalm. 33. 9. but Christ in redeeming the world said many words, and did
many wonders, and suffered also many wounds. It is true that the least ake of his least finger
is infiniti meriti, sed non definiti meriti, that is of an infinite merit, yet not that determined
ransome for the sinnes of the whole world. It cost him more to redeeme soules, [dg]he dyed
for our sinnes and rose againe for our iustification, hee suffered for vs and that death, and
that a violent death, and of all violent deaths the most accursed death on the Crosse.

  [Sidenote df: Aduancement of learning lib. 2. pag. 116.]

  [Sidenote dg: Rom. 4. 25.]

The worke of sanctification is a noble act also, for euery man if you rightly consider his
making is a wonder, I am saith our [dh]Prophet fearfully and wonderfully made: but a good man
if you consider his new making is a wonderfull wonder, as [di]Paul speakes a spectacle to men
and Angels, as the vulgar Latine runnes in the 68. Psalme, at the last verse, mirabilis deus
in sanctis, O God wonderfull art thou in thy Saints.

But Dauid [dk]here meaneth especially the valiant acts of God in gouerning & garding his people

his doing toward the Children of men, he turned the sea into drye land so that his people went
on foot thorough the middest of the sea, the [dm]waters were a wall vnto them on the right
hand and on their left; but the waues of the Sea returned and couered the chariots and horsemen
euen all the hoast of Pharaoh that pursued them. Almighty God raigned hailstones out of heauen
vpon the cursed Amorites at Bethoran, and they were more ([dn]saith the text) that dyed with
the haile, then they whom the Children of Israell slew with the sword. And when Duke Iosua
prayed, Sunne stay thou in Gibeon, & thou Moone in the valey of Aialon: the Sunne abode and
the Moone stood still vntill the people auenged themselues vpon their enemies. When Zenacherib
and his innumerous hoast came to fight against Hezekiah King of Iuda, Gods Angell in one night
slew an hundred eighty and fiue thousand Assyrians. 2. Kings 19.

And vndoubtedly (beloued) there is no nation vnder the cope of Heauen hath had greater occasion
to praise God in this kind then England, the preseruation of the most illustrious princesse
the Lady Elizabeth vnder the fiery triall of her vnkind sister Queene Marie was a noble act,
and the seminary of much happinesse vnto this kingdome for many yeares after, and so much the
more noble because Philip King of Spaine hath often confessed that he spared her life (when
wildy Winchester and bloodie Bonner had brought her into the snare) not out of any pietie or
pittie, but onely out of policie. Her exaltation to the Crowne was another noble act, so noble
that some [do]Popish Prelats in their enuie burst a sunder and dyed for very griefe of heart.
Well might that good Lady sing and say with the blessed Virgine, He that is mightie hath magnified
me, and holy is his name, he hath put downe the mightie from their seat and hath exalted the
humble and meeke: her flourishing in health, wealth, and godlinesse, more then 44. yeares (in
despite of all her foes abroad, at home, schismaticall, hereticall, open, intestine) was another
noble act: for after once the Bull of Pope Pius Quintus had roared, and his fat Calues had
begunne to bellow in this Island: there passed neuer a yeare, neuer a moneth, neuer a weeke
(I thinke I might say) neuer a day, neuer an houre, but some mischiefe was intended either
against her person or her people: the resisting of the rebellion in the Northerne parts of
England, was a noble act: the discouering and so consequently the defeating of Campians treason
a noble act: of Parris treason a noble act: of the Lupus Lopus his treason, a noble act: of
Squires treason, a noble act. Her glorious victories against her fell and insolent enemies
the Spaniards in Ireland, in Flanders, in France, in their owne dominions of Portugal, Indies,
and Spaine were noble acts. It was a wonder of wonders, that a Mayden Queene should at one
time be both a staffe to Flanders, and a stay to France, a terror to Pope, a mirror to Turke,
feared abroad, loued at home, Mistresse of the Sea, wonder of the world. Shee might truely
bee called a Prince of Peace, for shee was Crowned in Peace, shee liued in Peace, she dyed
in Peace, she was buried in Peace: and when shee had slept with her Fathers, it was another
noble act of the Lord to send vs in the midst of all our feare so learned, so meeke, so pious
a Prince as King Iames, in such exceeding sweet peace, that neuer a sword was drawn, happily
neuer a word spoken against him. All these were noble acts, and ought to be had in a perpetuall
remembrance. But of all other noble preseruations, Our deliuerance from that intended mercilesse
and matchlesse Massacre both in fact and fiction, the fifth of Nouember, in the yeare 1605.
is most noblie noble. King Iames on this day might haue said with King [dp]Dauid, O Lord which
art my rocke and my fortresse, thou hast giuen me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy
them that hate me, that I might breake them as small as the dust of the earth, and tread them
flat as the clay of the streete. [dq]O giue thankes vnto the Lord, for he is gracious, and
his mercy endureth for euer. Let Israel now confesse that he is gracious, and that his mercy
endureth for euer. Let the house of Aaron now confesse that his mercy endureth for euer. Yea
let all such as feare the Lord now confesse that his mercy endureth for euer. All the Congregations
of the Saints in the whole world, haue good cause to thanke God our strength and deliuerer.
Scotland hath good cause, for if England had been but a Tuesday breakefast, assuredly Scotland
should haue been but a Fridaies drinking, one morsell as it were for the greedy deuourer. The
Churches in France relieued often by vs, haue good cause to reioyce with vs. Our neighbours
of Holland haue good cause to triumphe as they doe, for if our house had been set on fire,
their house being the next would haue been quickly pulled downe. The Churches in Germanie,
Denmarke, Hungarie, Geneua likewise haue good cause to praise God in this noble act according
to his excellent greatnesse.

More principally the Common-weale of England, and in it all men of all factions, and all fashions

his mercie toward them in sparing vs, and so sauing the bad for the [dr]righteous sake. Carnall
Gospellers haue good cause to thanke God, confessing that so long as [ds]Lot is in Sodome,
it can not be destroyed; and so long as Moses standeth in the [dt]gap, and [du]prayeth for

(if they haue any sparke of grace) confesse that God is to be praised in this noble act; for
suppose (God be thanked, we may suppose and dispose thus of these matters vnto our comfort)
I say suppose, their diuelish plot had been acted, I assure my selfe our cause had been farre
better, and our number farre greater than theirs; and as for our sinnes (which are indeede

But suppose the least and the worst part had ouercome the bigger and the better, yet (if they

kingdome, the truely zealous, and zealously true hearted protestants haue greatest occasion
of reioycing; for if the Lord had not (according to his excellent greatnes, and according to
his excellent goodnes too) deliuered vs out of this gun-powder gulfe, our bodies happily might
haue beene made food for the foules, or else fewell for the fire; and that which would haue
grieued our posteritie more, supersition and Idolatrie might in short time haue been replanted

The greater was our danger, the greater was our deliuerance; the greater our deliuerance, the
greater our thankes should be; for as it followeth in my text, God is to be praised according
to his excellent greatnes. It is true that our most and best praises are few for the number,
and little for the measure; whereas God is infinite for his goodnes, and in his greatnesse
incomprehensible. So that the meaning of [ea]Dauid is, that we should praise him according
to our capacitie, and not according to his immensitie; according to the grace bestowed vpon
vs, and not according to the glorie which is in him. Ecclesiasticus 43. 30. Praise the Lord,
and magnifie him as much as ye can, yet doth he farre exceed. Exalt him with all your power,
and be not weary, yet can ye not attaine vnto it.

  [Sidenote ea: Basil. Musculus, Placid. parnen. in loc.]

Now where the Lord giueth a greater meane, there he requireth a greater measure; where he bestoweth
a greater portion of giftes, he doth expect a greater proportion of glorie. Wherefore seeing
the Lord hath out of his abundant mercie conferred vpon this kingdome inestimable blessings,
in the preaching of his word for the space of more then fiftie yeares; it is questionlesse
he lookes for no little thankes or small praise, but for great thankes and great praise according
to his excellent greatnesse manifested in this our deliuerance. I come therefore to the second
part of this Psalme, shewing with what God is to be praised, In the sound of the trumpet, &c.

God is to be praised (saith [eb]Augustine) totis votis de totis vobis with all your soules,
and with all your selues. That therefore we may manifest our inward affections by such outward
actions as are commendable, where there be trumpets, let them sound: where there be lutes and
harpes, let them strike vp: where there be loud Cymbals and well tuned Cymbals, let them ring,
let them sing the praises of God for this our most happy deliuerance; let trumpet and tongue,
viol & voice, lute & life, witnes our hartie reioycing in the Lord. If our true zeale were
more fierie within, it would doubtlesse break forth into moe publike workes, then it doth,
against that bloody brood of the Gun-powder crue. There haue been many collections in euery
Dioces for the reedifying of the Churches of Saint Albanes and Arthuret, the which I assure
my selfe were good works: there haue been in this latter age many gorgeous, I might say glorious
buildings erected about and in this honorable Citie, to the great ornament of our Country,
the which I thinke you may number among your good workes: there haue bin Lotteries to further
Virginean enterprises, and these (for any thing I know) were good workes also: there haue been
many new play-houses, and one faire Burse lately built; Paris-garden in a flourishing estate
makes a great noyse still, and as I heare Charing Crosse shall haue a new coat too: but in
the meane time while so many monuments are raised, either to the honour of the dead, or else
for the profit and pleasure of the lyuing: Dic mihi musa virum, I pray Muse and shew me the
man, who ioynes with that euer zealous, reuerend, learned Deane in founding a Colledge for
a Societie of writers against the superstitious Idolatries of the Romane Synagogue, the which
happily might be like the [ec]Tower of Dauid, where the strong men of Israel might haue shieldes
and targets to fight the Lords battaile: [ed]Is it time for your selues to dwell in your seiled

forsake him, he will forsake you. Benot cold in a good cause, flie not out of the field, play
not the cowards in the Lords holie wars; for albeit happily your selues are like for your time
to do wel enough in despite of the Diuell, and the Pope his darling: yet your posteritie will
assuredly rue it, and haue iust cause to curse their dastardly, spiritlesse and worthlesse
progenitors. I say no more concerning this point, only I pray with our forefathers in the first
English Letany, set out in the dayes of King Henry the 8. from all sedition and priuie conspiracie,
from the tyrannie of the Bishop of Rome, and all his detestable enormities, from all false
doctrine and heresie, from hardnesse of heart, and contempt of thy word and commandement.

Where note by the way, that the Popes abominable tyrannie is hedged in (as it were) on the

heresie. I haue another prayer, and for as much as it is in Latine, I must entreat all such
(if any such here be present, who loue Bonauentures psalter and the Romish seruice) to ioyne
with vs in this orison. Papa noster qui es Romæ maledicetur nomen tuum, intereat regnum tuum,
impediatur voluntas tua, sicut in Coelo sic et in terra. Potum nostrum in Coena dominica da

The word of God is a [ef]two edged sword, sharp in a literal, and sharp in an allegoricall
exposition. Hitherto you haue heard the history, now there remaineth a mistery, nihil enim

the sounding of the trumpet, the preaching of the Gospell, [ei]whose sound went out thorow
all the earth vnto the endes of the world: at the seuenfold sounding of this trumpet the walles
of [ek]Iericho fal, that is all the pompes and powers of this world are conquered & brought
to nought, this trumpet is mightie thorough God to cast downe holdes, and Imaginations, and
euery high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God. 2. Cor. 10. 4.

[el]Other say that the Saints are these trumpets, and harpes, and Cymbals, and that their [em]members
make this musicke to the Lord, our eyes praies the Lord, while they be [en]lifted vp vnto their
maker in heauen, and waite vpon his mercy: our tongues praise the Lord, in singing [eo]Psalmes,
and hymnes, and spirituall songs vnto the Lord: our eares praise the Lord, while they [ep]heare
the word of God with attention: our hands praise the Lord, while they be [eq]stretched out

when they bee not [es]swift to shed blood, but [et]stand in the gates of Gods house, ready
to [eu]run the wayes of his commandements. In Tympano sicca & percussa pellis resonat, in choro

in the bond of peace, praise God in choro: the Brownist in separating himselfe from the Church
though he seeme to praise God in tympano, yet hee doth not praise God in choro: and the carnall
gospeller albeit he ioyne with the Church in choro, yet he prayseth not God in tympano; they
praise God in well tuned Cymbals who tune their soules before they preach or pray, whosoeuer
desires to bee a sweete singer in Israel must bee learned in the schoole, before hee be lowd
in the temple: the heart likewise must be prepared for praying, as the harpe for playing, if
our instruments of praise be not in tune, then our whole deuotion is like the [fa]sounding
brasse or as the tinckling Cymbal: in Gods quier there is first tune well, and then sound well,
if once we can say with [fb]Dauid, O God mine heart is ready, mine heart is ready, then our
lute and harpe will awake right early: let thy soule praise the Lord, and then all that is
either without or about thee will instantly doe the same.

vs in the [fn]Gospell) are they who doe the workes of Abraham, and Abrahams chiefe worke was
faith, Abraham beleeued (saith the [fo]text) and it was imputed to him for righteousnes. Ergo,
the true beleeuer is a right Isralite, blessed with faithfull Abraham. Galat. 3. 9. [fp]some
stretch this further, applying it not onely to the spirits of men in the Church militant, but
also to the blessed Angels and Saints in the triumphant, for this Psalme consists of a threefold
apostrophe.

1. Dauid inuiteth all the Citizens of heauen, O praise God in his sanctuarie, praise him in
the firmament of his power.

2. All the dwellers vpon earth, praise him in the sound of the trumpet, praise him vpon the
lute and harpe, &c.

3. Both and all, let euery thing that hath breath, euery thing which hath either the life of
nature, or of grace, or of glorie, let euery spirit [fq]whether it be terrestriall or celestiall,
of whatsoeuer condition, age, sexe, praise the Lord.

It is a [fr]Rabbinical conceit that this hymne consists of 13. Halleluiahs, answering 13. Properties
of God mentioned Exod. 34. 6.7. verses, and in that our Prophet after a dozen Halleluiahs hath
not done, but addeth a thirteenth, hee doth insinuate that when all our deuotion is finished,
it is our dutie to begin againe with Gods praise, for as [fs]of him, and thorough him, and
for him, are all things, euen so to him is due all glorie for euermore: as his mercies are
from euerlasting to euerlasting, from euerlasting election, to euerlasting glorification: so
likewise his praises are to bee sung for euer and euer. In this life we begin this hymne singing
(as musitians speake) in breifs and semibriefs a staffe or two, but in the world to come standing
before the throne of the Lambe, clothed in long white robes, accompanied with all the sweet
voyces of heauens incomparable melodious quire: we shall eternally sing, [ft]Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God almightie, which was, and which is, and which is to come, [fu]praise, and glorie,
and wisdome, and power, and might, be vnto our God for euermore. Amen.

[Notes and Errata

In the Latin words "Coelo" and "Coena", the letter combination "oe" was printed in single-letter
(ligature) form, analogous to æ for ae.

The titles "Mr." and "Dr." were printed with superscript r, properly transcribed M^{r}. and
D^{r}. They have been simplified for readability.

Years are always printed with following period (full stop), regardless of place in the sentence.

Sidenotes--here equivalent to footnotes--were labeled sequentially a-z, repeating as often
as necessary. For this e-text they have been given unique identifiers adding a, b, c... to
successive series. Note that the 23-letter alphabet has no j, v or w.
