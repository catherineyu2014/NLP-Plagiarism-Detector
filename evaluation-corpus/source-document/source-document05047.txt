You are not willing, perhaps, to test this question by the longevity of purely literary men.
You ask what can be said about the great preachers. You have always heard, that, while the
ministers were, no doubt, men of excellent intentions and much sound learning, what with their
morbid notions of life, and what with the weight of a rather heavy sort of erudition, they
were saints with the very poorest kind of bodies. Just the contrary. No class lives longer.
We once made out a list of the thirty most remarkable preachers of the last four centuries
that we could call to mind. Of the age to which most of these attained we had at the outset
no idea whatever. In that list were included the men who must figure in every candid account
of preaching. The great men of the Reformation, Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Knox, were
there. That resplendent group which adorned the seventeenth century, and whose names are synonymes
for pulpit eloquence, Barrow, South, Jeremy Taylor, and Tillotson, were prominent in it. The
milder lights of the last century, Paley, Blair, Robertson, Priestley, were not forgotten.
The Catholics were represented by Massillon, Bossuet, Bourdalouë, and Fénelon. The Protestants
as truly by Robert Hall and Chalmers, by Wesley and Channing. In short, it was a thoroughly
fair list. We then proceeded to ascertain the average life of those included in it. It was
just sixty-nine years. And we invite all persons who are wedded to the notion that the saints
are always knights of the broken body, to take pen and paper and jot down the name of every
remarkable preacher since the year 1500 that they can recall, and add, if they wish, every
man in their own vicinity who has risen in learning and talent above the mass of his profession.
We will insure the result without any premium. They will produce a list that would delight
the heart of a provident director of a life-insurance company. And their average will come
as near the old Scripture pattern of threescore years and ten as that of any body of men who
have lived since the days of Isaac and Jacob.

If now any one has a lurking doubt of the physical value of an active and well-stored mind,
let him pass from the preachers to the statesmen, from the men who teach the wisdom of the
world to come to the men who administer the things of this world. Let him begin with the grand
names of the Long Parliament,--Hampden, Pym, Vane, Cromwell,--and then gather up all the great
administrators of the next two centuries, down to the octogenarians who are now foremost in
the conduct of British affairs; and if he wishes to widen his observation, let him pass over
the Channel to the Continent, and in France recall such names as Sully and Richelieu, Mazarin
and Colbert, Talleyrand and Guizot; in Austria, Kaunitz and Metternich. And when he has made
his list as broad, as inclusive of all really great statesmanship everywhere as he can, find
his average; and if he can bring it much beneath seventy, he will be more fortunate than we
were when we tried the experiment.

Do not by any means omit the men of science. There are the astronomers. If any employment would
seem to draw a man up to heaven, it would be this. Yet, of all men, astronomers apparently
have had the most wedded attachment to earth. Galileo, Newton, La Place, Herschel,--these are
the royal names, the fixed stars, set, as it were, in that very firmament which for so many
years they searched with telescopic eye. And yet neither of them lived less than seventy-eight
years. As for the men of natural science, it looks as though they were spared by some Providential
provision, in order that they might observe and report for long epochs the changes of this
old earth of ours. Cuvier dying at seventy-five, Sir Joseph Banks at seventy-seven, Buffon
at eighty-one, Blumenbach at eighty-eight, and Humboldt at fourscore and ten, are some of the
cases which make such a supposition altogether reasonable.

Cross the ocean, and you will find the same testimony, that mental culture is absolutely favorable
to physical endurance. The greatest men in our nation's history, whether in walks of statesmanship,
science, or literature, almost without exception, have lived long. Franklin, Washington, Jefferson,
Madison, the elder Adams, and Patrick Henry, in earlier periods,--the younger Adams, Clay,
Calhoun, Webster, Choate, and Everett, Irving, Prescott, Cooper, and Hawthorne, in later times,--are
cases in point. These men did not die prematurely. They grew strong by the toil of the brain.
And to-day the quartette of our truest poets--Bryant, Whittier, Longfellow, and Holmes--are
with us in the hale years of a green age, never singing sweeter songs, never harping more inspiring
strains. Long may our ears hear their melodies!

       *       *       *       *       *

If now we could enter the walks of private life, and study widely the experience of individual
men, we should have an interesting record indeed, and a manifold and wellnigh irresistible
testimony. Consider a few remarkable, yet widely differing cases.

Who can read attentively the life of John Wesley, and not exclaim, if varied and exhausting
labor, if perpetual excitement and constant drafts upon the brain, would ever wear a man out,
he would have worn out? It was his creative energy that called into existence a denomination,
his ardent piety that inspired it, his clear mind that legislated for it, his heroic industry
that did no mean part of the incessant daily toil needful for its establishment. Yet this man
of many labors, who through a long life never knew practically the meaning of the word leisure,
says, at seventy-two, "How is it that I find the same strength that I did thirty years ago,
that my nerves are firmer, that I have none of the infirmities of old age, and have lost several
that I had in youth." And ten years later, he devoutly records, "Is anything too hard for God?
It is now eleven years since I have felt such a thing as weariness." And he continued till
eighty-eight in full possession of his faculties, laboring with body and mind alike to within
a week of his death.

Joseph Priestley was certainly a very different man, but scarcely less remarkable. No mean
student in all branches of literature, a metaphysician, a theologian, a man of science, he
began life with a feeble frame, and ended a hearty old age at seventy-one. He himself declares
at fifty-four, that, "so far from suffering from application to study, I have found my health
steadily improve from the age of eighteen to the present time."

You would scarcely find a life more widely divided from these than that of Washington Irving.
Nevertheless, it is like them in one respect, that it bears emphatic testimony to the real
healthiness of mental exertion. He was the feeblest of striplings at eighteen. At nineteen,
Judge Kent said, "He is not long for this world." His friends sent him abroad at twenty-one,
to see if a sea voyage would not husband his strength. So pale, so broken, was he, that, when
he stepped on board the ship, the captain whispered, "There is a chap who will be overboard
before we are across!" Irving had, too, his share of misfortunes,--failure in business, loss
of investments, in earlier life some anxiety as to the ways and means of support. Even his
habits of study were hardly what the highest wisdom would direct. While he was always genial
and social, and at times easy almost to indolence, when the mood seized him, he would write
incessantly for weeks and even for months, sometimes fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen hours in
a day. But he grew robust for half a century, and writes, at seventy-five, that he has now
"a streak of old age."

       *       *       *       *       *

The example of some of those who are said to have been worn out by intense mental application
furnishes perhaps the most convincing proof of all that no reasonable activity of the mind
ever warred with the best health of the body. Walter Scott, we are told, wore out. And very
likely, to a certain extent, the statement is true. But what had he not accomplished before
he wore out? He had astonished the world with that wonderful series of romances which place
him scarcely second to any name in English literature. He had sung those border legends which
delighted the ears of his generation. He had produced histories which show, that, had he chosen,
he might have been as much a master in the region of historic fact as in the realm of imagination.
He had edited other men's works; he had written essays; he had lent himself with a royal generosity
to every one who asked his time or influence; and when, almost an old man, commercial bankruptcy
overtook him, and he sought to lift the mountain of his debt by pure intellectual toil, he
wore out. But declining years, disappointed hopes, desperate exertions, may wear anybody out.
He wore out, but it was at more than threescore years, when nine tenths of his generation had
long slept in quiet graves,--when the crowd of the thoughtless and indolent, who began life
with him, had rusted out in inglorious repose. Yes, Walter Scott wore out, if you call that
wearing out.

John Calvin, all his biographers say, wore out. Perhaps so;--but not without a prolonged resistance.
Commencing life with the frailest constitution, he was, as early as twenty-five, a model of
erudition, and had already written his immortal work. For thirty years he was in the heat and
ferment of a great religious revolution. For thirty years he was one of the controlling minds
of his age. For thirty years he was the sternest soldier in the Church Militant, bearing down
stubborn resistance by a yet more stubborn will. For thirty years neither his brain nor his
pen knew rest. And so at fifty-six this man of broken body and many labors laid down the weapons
of his warfare; but it was at Geneva, where the public registers tell us that the average of
human life in that century was only nine years.

One writes words like these:--"John Kitto died, and his death was the judgment for overwork,
and overwork of a single organ,--the brain." And who was John Kitto? A poor boy, the son a
drunken father, subject from infancy to agonizing headache. An unfortunate lad, who at thirteen
fell from a scaffolding and was taken up for dead, and escaped only with total deafness and
a supposed permanent injury to the brain. A hapless apprentice, who suffered at the hands of
a cruel taskmaster all that brutality and drunken fury could suggest. A youth, thirsting for
knowledge, but able to obtain it only by the hardest ways, peering into booksellers' windows,
reading at book-stalls, purchasing cheap books with pennies stained all over with the sweat
of his toil. An heroic student, who labored for more than twenty years with almost unparalleled
industry, and with an equally unparalleled neglect of the laws of health; of whom it is scarcely
too much to say literally, that he knew no change, but from his desk to his bed, and from his
bed to his desk again. A voluminous writer, who, if he produced no work of positive genius,
has done more than any other man to illustrate the Scriptures, and to make familiar and vivid
the scenery, the life, the geography, and the natural history of the Holy Land. And he died
in the harness,--but not so very early,--at fifty. And we say that he would have lived much
longer, had he given his constitution a fair chance. But when we remember his passionate fondness
for books, how they compensated him for the want of wealth, comforts, and the pleasant voices
of wife and children that he could not hear, we grow doubtful. And we hear him exclaim almost
in rhapsody,--"If I were blind as well as deaf, in what a wretched situation should I be! If
I could not read, how deplorable would be my condition! What earthly pleasure equal to the
reading of a good book? O dearest tomes! O princely and august folios! to obtain you, I would
work night and day, and forbid myself every sensual joy!" When we behold the forlorn man, shut
out by his misfortune from so many resources, and finding more than recompense for this privation
within the four walls of his library, we are tempted to say, No, he would not have lived as
long; had he studied less, he would have remembered his griefs more.

Of course it is easy to take exception to all evidence drawn from the life and experience of
individual men,--natural to say that one must needs be somewhat old before he can acquire a
great name at all, and that our estimate considers those alone to whom mere prolongation of
day has given reputation, and forgets "the village Hampdens, the mute, inglorious Miltons,"
the unrecorded Newtons, the voiceless orators, sages, or saints who have died and made no sign.
To this the simple reply is, that individual cases, however numerous and striking, are not
relied upon to prove any position, but only to illustrate and confirm one which general data
have already demonstrated. Grant the full force of every criticism, and then it remains true
that the widest record of literary life exhibits no tendency of mental culture to shorten human
life or to create habits which would shorten it. Indeed, we do not know where to look for any
broad range of facts which would indicate that education here or anywhere else has decreased
or is likely to decrease health. And were it not for the respect which we cherish towards those
who hold it, we should say that such a position was as nearly pure theory or prejudice or opinion
founded on fragmentary data as any view well could be.

       *       *       *       *       *

But do you mean to assert that there is no such thing as intellectual excess? that intellectual
activity never injures? that unremitting attention to mental pursuits, with an entire abstinence
from proper exercise and recreation, is positively invigorating? that robbing the body of sleep,
and bending it sixteen or eighteen hours over the desk, is the best way to build it up in grace
and strength? Of course no one would say any such absurd things. There is a right and wrong
use of everything. Any part of the system will wear out with excessive use. Overwork kills,
but certainly not any quicker when it is overwork of the mind than when it is overwork of the
body. Overwork in the study is just as healthful as overwork on the farm or at the ledger or
in the smoky shop, toiling and moiling, with no rest and no quickening thoughts. Especially
is it true that education does not peculiarly tempt a man to excess.

But are you ready to maintain that there is no element of excess infused into our common-school
system? Certainly. Most emphatically there is not. What, then, is there to put over against
these terrible statements of excessive labor of six or seven hours a day, under which young
brains are reeling and young spines are bending until there are no rosy-checked urchins and
blooming maids left among us? The inexorable logic of facts. The public schools of Massachusetts
were taught in the years 1863-4 on an average just thirty-two weeks, just five days in a week,
and, making proper allowance for recesses and opening exercises, just five and a quarter hours
in a day. Granting now that all the boys and girls studied during these hours faithfully, you
have an average for the three hundred and thirteen working days of the year of two hours and
forty-one minutes a day,--an amount of study that never injured any healthy child. But, going
back a little to youthful recollections, and considering the amazing proclivity of the young
mind to idleness, whispering, and fun and frolic in general, it seems doubtful whether our
children ever yet attained to so high an average of actual study as two hours a day. As a modification
of this statement, it may be granted that in the cities and larger towns the school term reaches
forty weeks in a year. If you add one hour as the average amount of study at home, given by
pupils of over twelve years, (and the allowance is certainly ample,) you have four hours as
the utmost period ever given by any considerable class of children. That there is excess we
freely admit. That there are easy committee-men who permit too high a pressure, and infatuated
teachers who insist upon it, that there are ambitious children whom nobody can stop, and silly
parents who fondly wish to see their children monstrosities of brightness, lisping Latin and
Greek in their cradles, respiring mathematics as they would the atmosphere, and bristling all
over with facts of natural science like porcupines, till every bit of childhood is worked out
of them,--that such things are, we are not inclined to deny. But they are rare exceptions,--no
more a part of the system than white crows are proper representatives of the dusky and cawing
brotherhood.

Or yet again, do we mean to assert that no attention need be given to the formation of right
physical habits? or that bodily exercise ought not to be joined to mental toils? or that the
walk in the woods, the row upon the quiet river, the stroll with rod in hand by the babbling
brook, or with gun on shoulder over the green prairies, or the skating in the crisp December
air on the glistening lake, ought to be discouraged? Do we speak disrespectfully of dumb-bells
and clubs and parallel bars, and all the paraphernalia of the gymnasium? Are we aggrieved at
the mention of boxing-gloves or single-stick or foils? Would it shock our nervous sensibilities,
if our next-door neighbor the philosopher, or some near-by grave and reverend doctor of divinity,
or even the learned judge himself, should give unmistakable evidence that he had in his body
the two hundred and odd bones and the five hundred and more muscles, with all their fit accompaniments
of joints and sinews, of which the anatomists tell us? Not at all. Far from it. We exercise,
no doubt, too little. We know of God's fair world too much by description, too little by the
sight of our own eyes. Welcome anything which leads us out into this goodly and glorious universe!
Welcome all that tends to give the human frame higher grace and symmetry! Welcome the gymnastics,
too, heavy or light either, if they will guide us to a more harmonious physical development.

We ourselves own a set of heavy Indian-clubs, of middling Indian-clubs, and of light Indian-clubs.
We have iron dumb-bells and wooden dumb-bells. We recollect with considerable satisfaction
a veritable bean-bag which did good service in the household until it unfortunately sprung
a-leak. In an amateur way we have tried both systems, and felt the better for them. We have
a dim remembrance of rowing sundry leagues, and even of dabbling with the rod and line. We
always look with friendly eye upon the Harvard Gymnasium, whenever it looms up in actual or
mental vision. Never yet could we get by an honest game of cricket or base-ball without losing
some ten minutes in admiring contemplation. We bow with deep respect to Dr. Windship and his
heavy weights. We bow, if anything, with a trifle more of cordiality to Dr. Lewis and his light
weights. They both have our good word. We think that they would have our example, were it not
for the fatal proclivity of solitary gymnastics to dulness. If we have not risen to the high
degrees in this noble order of muscular Christians, we claim at least to be a humble craftsman
and faithful brother.

Speaking with all seriousness, we have no faith in mental activity purchased at the expense
of physical sloth. It is well to introduce into the school, into the family, and into the neighborhood
any movement system which will exercise all the muscles of the body. But the educated man is
not any more likely to need this general physical development than anybody else. Establish
your gymnasium in any village, and the farmer fresh from the plough, the mechanic from swinging
the hammer or driving the plane, will be just as sure to find new muscles that he never dreamed
of as the palest scholar of them all. And the diffusion of knowledge and refinement, so far
from promoting inactivity and banishing recreations from life, directly feeds that craving
for variety out of which healthful changes come, and awakens that noble curiosity which at
fit seasons sends a man out to see how the wild-flower grows in the woods, how the green buds
open in the spring, how the foliage takes on its painted autumn glory, which leads him to struggle
through tangled thickets or through pathless woods that he may behold the brook laughing in
cascade from rock to rock, or to breast the steep mountain that he may behold from a higher
outlook the wonders of the visible creation. Other things being equal, the educated man in
any vocation is quite as likely as another to be active, quick in every motion and free in
every limb.

       *       *       *       *       *

But admit all that is claimed. Admit that increasing intelligence has changed the average of
man's life from the twenty-five years of the seventeenth century to the thirty-five of the
eighteenth or the forty-five years of the nineteenth century. Admit, too, that the best educated
men of this generation will live five or ten years more than the least educated men. Ought
we to be satisfied with things as they are? Should we not look for more than the forty or fifty
years of human life? Assuredly. But it is not our superfluous sainthood which is destroying
life. It is not that we have too much saintliness, but too little, too limited wisdom, too
narrow intelligence, too small an endowment of virtue and conscience. It is our fierce absorption
in outward plans which plants anxieties like thorns in the heart. It is out sloth and gluttony
which eat out vitality. It is our unbridled appetites and passions which burn like a consuming
fire in our breasts. It is our unwise exposure which saps the strength and gives energy and
force to latent disease. These, tenfold more than any intense application of the brain to its
legitimate work, limit and destroy human life. The truly cultivated mind tends to give just
aims, moderate desires, and good habits.

Ay, and when the true sainthood shall possess and rule humanity,--when the fields of knowledge
with their wholesome fruits shall tempt every foot away from the forbidden paths of vice and
sensual indulgence,--when a wise intelligence shall cool the hot passions which dry up the
refreshing fountains of peace and joy in the heart,--when a heavenly wisdom shall lift us above
any bondage to this world's fortunes, and when a good conscience and a lofty trust shall forbid
us to be slaves to any occupation lower than the highest,--when we stand erect and free, clothed
with a real saintliness,--then the years of our life may increase, and man may go down to his
grave "in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season."

Meanwhile we must stand firmly on this assertion, that, the more of mental and moral sainthood
our people achieve, the more that sainthood will write fair inscriptions on their bodies, will
shine out in intelligence in their faces, will exhibit itself in graceful form and motion,
and thus add to the deeper and more lasting virtues physical power, a body which shall be at
once a good servant and the proper representative of a refined and elevated soul.

COUPON BONDS.

PART II. I ruther guess he's got some."

"You mean Gov'ment bonds? Ducklow got some? Look at that!"

"'Twa'n't me!"--beginning to whimper, and ram his fists into his eyes.

"Don't tell me 'twa'n't you!"

"Ha'n't got a million!" Taddy wept, rubbing his cheek. "Ha'n't got but four!

"I ha'n't seen no peddler."

"And ha'n't yer Ma Ducklow been home, neither?"

"No."

"A'n't to home: may I ride?" cried Taddy, all in a breath.

At noon Mr. Ducklow returned.

"Did ye take the bonds?" was his wife's first question.

"Of course I did! Ye don't suppose I'd go away and leave 'em in the house, not knowin' when
you'd be comin' home?"

"Wal, I didn't know. And I didn't know whuther to believe Taddy or not. Oh, I've had such a
fright!"

And she related the story of her pursuit of the minister.

"How could ye make such a fool of yerself? It'll git all over town, and I shall be mortified
to death. Jest like a woman, to git frightened!"

"If you hadn't got frightened, and made a fool of yourself, yelling fire, 'twouldn't have happened!"
retorted Mrs. Ducklow.

"Wal! wal! say no more about it! The bonds are safe."

"I was in hopes you'd change 'em for them registered bonds Reuben spoke of."

"I did try to, but they told me to the bank it couldn't be did. Then I asked 'em if they would
keep 'em for me, and they said they wouldn't object to lockin' on 'em up in their safe; but
they wouldn't give me no receipt, nor hold themselves responsible for 'em. I didn't know what
else to do, so I handed 'em the bonds to keep."

"I want to know if you did now!" exclaimed Mrs. Ducklow, disapprovingly.

"Why not? What else could I do? I didn't want to lug 'em around with me forever. And as for
keepin' 'em hid in the house, we've tried that!" and Ducklow unfolded his weekly newspaper.

Mrs. Ducklow was placing the dinner on the table, with a look which seemed to say, "I wouldn't
have left the bonds in the bank; my judgment would have been better than all that. If they
are lost, I sha'n't be to blame!" when suddenly Ducklow started and uttered a cry of consternation
over his newspaper.

"Why, what have ye found?"

"Bank robbery!"

"Not your bank? Not the bank where your bonds"----

"Of course not; but in the very next town! The safe blown open with gunpowder! Five thousand
dollars in Gov'ment bonds stole!"

"How strange!" said Mrs. Ducklow. "Now what did I tell ye?"

"I believe you're right," cried Ducklow, starting to his feet. "They'll be safer in my own
house, or even in my own pocket!"

"If you was going to put 'em in any safe, why not put 'em in Josiah's? He's got a safe, ye know."

"So he has! We might drive over there and make a visit Monday, and ask him to lock up----yes,
we might tell him and Laury all about it, and leave 'em in their charge."

"So we might!" said Mrs. Ducklow.

Laura was their daughter, and Josiah her husband, in whose honor and sagacity they placed unlimited
confidence. The plan was resolved upon at once.

"To-morrow's Sunday," said Ducklow, pacing the floor. "If we leave the bonds in the bank over
night, they must stay there till Monday."

"And Sunday is jest the day for burglars to operate!" added Mrs. Ducklow.

"I've a good notion--let me see!" said Ducklow, looking at the clock. "Twenty minutes after
twelve! Bank closes at two! An hour and a half,--I believe I could git there in an hour and
a half. I will. I'll take a bite and drive right back."
