I cannot conclude without observing how pat every Thing happens: The French Society met on
Thursdays. So the News tells us, the English do; with this good difference: The French met
after they had din’d. The English, they say, dine together, and drink a chearful Glass afterwards;
which has great Efficacy in Matters of Wit and Eloquence, as well for those that are to write,
as those that are to reward. Wine is therefore call’d Generous, and is as nearly ally’d to
Wit, as Wit is to Madness. How much wittier are some Men over the third Bottle than over the
first! A strong Reason that the Meeting should be at a Tavern, and not any private House, which
the French Academy found very inconvenient; for whenever the Members, at whose Houses they
met, took a Fancy to Marry, their Wives turn’d the Wits out of Doors; as it happen’d in the
Case of Monsieur Conrart and some others. Thus they were driven from one place to another,
till their Protector got them a Room in the King’s own Palace; which cannot conveniently be
done in England whilst Lodgings are so scarce: And therefore I hope they will drink on as they
do, till Whitehall is rebuilt. And here I will leave them for the present: When their two other
Members are chosen, it may perhaps be not unseasonable to acquaint the Publick with the further
Progress of this hopeful Society; and to shew all the World how far we not only imitate or
copy, but even excel our Friends the French. In the mean time, I hope, some of their best Writers
will be order’d to give us a short Touch or Essay of their Eloquence, upon our late Glorious
Enterprize against the +French+, on +Tuesday+ the 20th of this present +May+, under the Command
of his Grace the D. of +Orm--d+.
