If it is courage that makes a king then I have the right to be called Kingbird. They say I
have a reckless sort of courage, because I attack birds a great deal larger than myself.

I would not call it courage to attack anything smaller than myself, would you? A big man finds
it easy to shoot a little bird in the air; and a big boy does not need to be brave to kill
or cripple some poor little animal that crosses his path. He only needs to be a coward to do that!

I only attack my enemies,--the Hawks, Owls, Eagles, Crows, Jays, and Cuckoos. They would destroy
my young family if I did not drive them away. Mr. Crow especially is a great thief. When my
mate is on her nest I keep a sharp lookout, and when one of my enemies approaches I give a
shrill cry, rise in the air, and down I pounce on his back; I do this more than once, and how
I make the feathers fly!

The little hawks and crows I never attack, and yet they call me a bully. Sometimes I do go
for a Song-bird or a Robin, but only when they come too near my nest. People wonder why I never
attack the cunning Catbird. I'll never tell them, you may be sure!

To what family do I belong? To a large family called Flycatchers. Because some Kings are tyrants
I suppose, they call me the Tyrant Flycatcher. Look for me next summer on top of a wire fence
or dead twig of a tree, and watch me, every few minutes, dash into the air, seize a passing
insect, and then fly back to the same perch again.

Any other names? Yes, some folks call me the Bee Bird or Bee Martin. Once in awhile I change
my diet and do snap up a bee! but it is always a drone, not a honey-bee. Some ill-natured people
say I choose the drones because they can't sting, and not because they are tramp bees and will
not work.

Sing? Yes, when my mate is on her nest I please her with a soft pretty song, at other times
my call-note is a piercing Kyrie-K-y-rie! I live with you only in the summer. When September
comes I fly away to a warmer climate.
