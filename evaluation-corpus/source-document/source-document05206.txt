 Even in teaching
Mechanics, there is no exception to the general rule, that two heads are better than one.

Stories from Famous Ballads. For Children. By GRACE GREENWOOD, Author of "History of my Pets,"
"Merrie England," etc., etc. With Illustrations by BILLINGS. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.

All "famous ballads" are so close to Nature in their conceptions, emotions, incidents, and
expressions, that it seems hardly possible to change their form without losing their soul.
The present little volume proves that they may be turned into prose stories for children, and
yet preserve much of the vitality of their sentiment and the interest of their narrative. Grace
Greenwood, well known for her previous successes in writing works for the young, has contrived
in this, her most difficult task, to combine simplicity with energy and richness of diction,
and to present the events and characters of the Ballads in the form best calculated to fill
the youthful imagination and kindle the youthful love of action and adventure. Among the subjects
are Patient Griselda, The King of France's Daughter, Chevy Chase, The Beggar's Daughter of
Bednall Green, Sir Patrick Spens, and Auld Robin Gray. Much of the author's success in giving
prose versions of these, without making them prosaic, is due to the intense admiration she
evidently feels for the originals. Among American children's books, this volume deserves a
high place.

Mary Staunton; or the Pupils of Marvel Hall. By the Author of "Portraits of, my Married Friends."
New York: D. Appleton & Co.

This story has a practical aim, the exposure of the faults of fashionable boarding-schools.
"A good plot, and full of expectation," as Hotspur said; but the author had not the ability
to execute the design. The satire and denunciation are both weak, and are not relieved by the
introduction of a very silly and threadbare love-story.

Poems. By the Author of "John Halifax," "A Life for a Life," etc. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.

Some of the verses in this little volume are quite pretty, especially those entitled, "By the
Alma River," "The Night before the Mowing," "My Christian Name," and "My Love Annie." Miss
Muloch is not able to take any high rank as a poetess, and very sensibly does not try.

Title-Hunting. By E. L. LLEWELLYN, Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co.

This is a miraculously foolish book. Titled villains, impossible parvenus, abductions, and
convents abound in its pages, and all are as stupid as they are improbable.
