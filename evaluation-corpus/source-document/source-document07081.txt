BIRD SONG.

    How songs are made
    Is a mystery,
    Which studied for years
    Still baffles me.
            --R. H. STODDARD.

"Some birds are poets and sing all summer," says Thoreau. "They are the true singers. Any man
can write verses in the love season. We are most interested in those birds that sing for the
love of music, and not of their mates; who meditate their strains and amuse themselves with
singing; the birds whose strains are of deeper sentiment."

Thoreau does not mention by name any of the poet-birds to which he alludes, but we think our
selections for the present month include some of them. The most beautiful specimen of all,
which is as rich in color and "sun-sparkle" as the most polished gem to which he owes his name,
the Ruby-throated Humming Bird, cannot sing at all, uttering only a shrill mouse-like squeak.
The humming sound made by his wings is far more agreeable than his voice, for "when the mild
gold stars flower out" it announces his presence. Then

    "A dim shape quivers about
    Some sweet rich heart of a rose."

He hovers over all the flowers that possess the peculiar sweetness that he loves--the blossoms
of the honeysuckle, the red, the white, and the yellow roses, and the morning glory. The red
clover is as sweet to him as to the honey bee, and a pair of them may often be seen hovering
over the blossoms for a moment, and then disappearing with the quickness of a flash of light,
soon to return to the same spot and repeat the performance. Squeak, squeak! is probably their
call note.

Something of the poet is the Yellow Warbler, though his song is not quite as long as an epic.
He repeats it a little too often, perhaps, but there is such a pervading cheerfulness about
it that we will not quarrel with the author. Sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweeter-sweeter!
is his frequent contribution to the volume of nature, and all the while he is darting about
the trees, "carrying sun-glints on his back wherever he goes." His song is appropriate to every
season, but it is in the spring, when we hear it first, that it is doubly welcome to the ear.
The grateful heart asks with Bourdillon:

    "What tidings hath the Warbler heard
    That bids him leave the lands of summer
    For woods and fields where April yields
    Bleak welcome to the blithe newcomer?"

The Mourning Dove may be called the poet of melancholy, for its song is, to us, without one
element of cheerfulness. Hopeless despair is in every note, and, as the bird undoubtedly does
have cheerful moods, as indicated by its actions, its song must be appreciated only by its
mate. Coo-o, coo-o! suddenly thrown upon the air and resounding near and far is something hardly
to be extolled, we should think, and yet the beautiful and graceful Dove possesses so many
pretty ways that every one is attracted to it, and the tender affection of the mated pair is
so manifest, and their constancy so conspicuous, that the name has become a symbol of domestic
concord.

The Cuckoo must utter his note in order to be recognized, for few that are learned in bird
lore can discriminate him save from his notes. He proclaims himself by calling forth his own
name, so that it is impossible to make a mistake about him. Well, his note is an agreeable
one and has made him famous. As he loses his song in the summer months, he is inclined to make
good use of it when he finds it again. English boys are so skillful in imitating the Cuckoo's
song, which they do to an exasperating extent, that the bird himself may often wish for that
of the Nightingale, which is inimitable.
