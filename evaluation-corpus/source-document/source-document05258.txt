VOL. X.--DECEMBER, 1862.--NO. LXII.

THE PROCESSION OF THE FLOWERS. Frederika Bremer relates that daily she brought home handfuls
of these blossoms to her chamber, and nightly they all disappeared. One morning she looked
toward the wall of the apartment, and there, in a long crimson line, the delicate flowers went
ascending one by one to the ceiling, and passed from sight. She found that each was borne laboriously
onward by a little colorless ant much smaller than itself: the bearer was invisible, but the
lovely burdens festooned the wall with beauty.

To a watcher from the sky, the march of the flowers of any zone across the year would seem
as beautiful as that West-Indian pageant. These frail creatures, rooted where they stand, a
part of the "still life" of Nature, yet share her ceaseless motion. In the most sultry silence
of summer noons, the vital current is coursing with desperate speed through the innumerable
veins of every leaflet; and the apparent stillness, like the sleeping of a child's top, is
in truth the very ecstasy of perfected motion.

Not in the tropics only, but even in England, whence most of our floral associations and traditions
come, the march of the flowers is in an endless circle, and, unlike our experience, something
is always in bloom. In the Northern United States, it is said, the active growth of most plants
is condensed into ten weeks, while in the mother-country the full activity is maintained through
sixteen. But even the English winter does not seem to be a winter, in the same sense as ours,
appearing more like a chilly and comfortless autumn. There is no month in the year when some
special plant does not bloom: the Coltsfoot there opens its fragrant flowers from December
to February; the yellow-flowered Hellebore, and its cousin, the sacred Christmas Rose of Glastonbury,
extend from January to March; and the Snowdrop and Primrose often come before the first of
February. Something may be gained, much lost, by that perennial succession; those links, however
slight, must make the floral period continuous to the imagination; while our year gives a pause
and an interval to its children, and after exhausted October has effloresced into Witch-Hazel,
there is an absolute reserve of blossom, until the Alders wave again.

No symbol could so well represent Nature's first yielding in spring-time as this blossoming
of the Alder, this drooping of the tresses of these tender things. Before the frost is gone,
and while the newborn season is yet too weak to assert itself by actually uplifting anything,
it can at least let fall these blossoms, one by one, till they wave defiance to the winter
on a thousand boughs. How patiently they have waited! Men are perplexed with anxieties about
their own immortality; but these catkins, which hang, almost full-formed, above the ice all
winter, show no such solicitude, but when March wooes them they are ready. Once relaxing, their
pollen is so prompt to fall that it sprinkles your hand as you gather them; then, for one day,
they are the perfection of grace upon your table, and next day they are weary and emaciated,
and their little contribution to the spring is done.

Then many eyes watch for the opening of the May-flower, day by day, and a few for the Hepatica.
So marked and fantastic are the local preferences of all our plants, that, with miles of woods
and meadows open to their choice, each selects only some few spots for its accustomed abodes,
and some one among them all for its very earliest blossoming. There is always some single chosen
nook, which you might almost cover with your handkerchief, where each flower seems to bloom
earliest, without variation, year by year. I know one such place for Hepatica a mile northeast,--another
for May-flower two miles southwest; and each year the whimsical creature is in bloom on that
little spot, when not another flower can be found open through the whole country round. Accidental
as the choice may appear, it is undoubtedly based on laws more eternal than the stars; yet
why all subtile influences conspire to bless that undistinguishable knoll no man can say. Another
and similar puzzle offers itself in the distribution of the tints of flowers,--in these two
species among the rest. There are certain localities, near by, where the Hepatica is all but
white, and others where the May-flower is sumptuous in pink; yet it is not traceable to wet
or dry, sun or shadow, and no agricultural chemistry can disclose the secret. Is it by some
Darwinian law of selection that the white Hepatica has utterly overpowered the blue, in our
Cascade Woods, for instance, while yet in the very midst of this pale plantation a single clump
will sometimes bloom with all heaven on its petals? Why can one recognize the Plymouth May-flower,
as soon as seen, by its wondrous depth of color? Does it blush with triumph to see how Nature
has outwitted the Pilgrims, and even succeeded in preserving her deer like an English duke,
still maintaining the deepest woods in Massachusetts precisely where those sturdy immigrants
first began their clearings?

The Hepatica (called also Liverwort, Squirrel-Cup, or Blue Anemone) has been found in Worcester
as early as March seventeenth, and in Danvers on March twelfth,--dates which appear almost
the extreme of credibility.

Our next wild-flower in this region is the Claytonia, or Spring-Beauty, which is common in
the Middle States, but here found in only a few localities. It is the Indian Miskodeed, and
was said to have been left behind when mighty Peboan, the Winter, was melted by the breath
of Spring. It is an exquisitely delicate little creature, bears its blossoms in clusters, unlike
most of the early species, and opens in gradual succession each white and pink-veined bell.
It grows in moist places on the sunny edges of woods, and prolongs its shy career from about
the tenth of April until almost the end of May.

A week farther into April, and the Bloodroot opens,--a name of guilt, and a type of innocence.
This fresh and lovely thing appears to concentrate all its stains within its ensanguined root,
that it may condense all purity in the peculiar whiteness of its petals. It emerges from the
ground with each shy blossom wrapt in its own pale-green leaf, then doffs the cloak and spreads
its long petals round a group of yellow stamens. The flower falls apart so easily that when
in full bloom it will hardly bear transportation, but with a touch the stem stands naked, a
bare gold-tipped sceptre amid drifts of snow. And the contradiction of its hues seems carried
into its habits. One of the most shy of wild plants, easily banished from its locality by any
invasion, it yet takes to the garden with unpardonable readiness, doubles its size, blossoms
earlier, repudiates its love of water, and flaunts its great leaves in the unnatural confinement
until it elbows out the exotics. Its charm is gone, unless one find it in its native haunts,
beside some cascade which streams over rocks that are dark with moisture, green with moss,
and snowy with white bubbles. Each spray of dripping feather-moss exudes a tiny torrent of
its own, or braided with some tiny neighbor, above the little water-fonts which sleep sunless
in ever-verdant caves. Sometimes along these emerald canals there comes a sudden rush and hurry,
as if some anxious housekeeper upon the hill above were afraid that things were not stirring
fast enough,--and then again the waving and sinuous lines of water are quieted to a serener
flow. The delicious red-thrush and the busy little yellow-throat are not yet come to this their
summer haunt; but all day long the answering field-sparrows trill out their sweet, shy, accelerating
lay.

In the same localities with the Bloodroot, though some days later, grows the Dog-Tooth Violet,--a
name hopelessly inappropriate, but likely never to be changed. These hardy and prolific creatures
have also many localities of their own; for, though they do not acquiesce in cultivation, like
the sycophantic Bloodroot, yet they are hard to banish from their native haunts, but linger
after the woods are cleared and the meadow drained. The bright flowers blaze back all the yellow
light of noonday as the gay petals curl and spread themselves above their beds of mottled leaves;
but it is always a disappointment to gather them, for indoors they miss the full ardor of the
sunbeams, and are apt to go to sleep and nod expressionless from the stalk.

And almost on the same day with this bright apparition one may greet a multitude of concurrent
visitors, arriving so accurately together that it is almost a matter of accident which of the
party shall first report himself. Perhaps the Dandelion should have the earliest place; indeed,
I once found it in Brookline on the seventh of April. But it cannot ordinarily be expected
before the twentieth, in Eastern Massachusetts, and rather later in the interior; while by
the same date I have also found near Boston the Cowslip or Marsh-Marigold, the Spring-Saxifrage,
the Anemones, the Violets, the Bellwort, the Houstonia, the Cinquefoil, and the Strawberry-blossom.
Varying, of course, in different spots and years, the arrival of this coterie is yet nearly
simultaneous, and they may all be expected hereabouts before May-day at the very latest. After
all, in spite of the croakers, this festival could not have been much better-timed, the delicate
blossoms which mark the period are usually in perfection on this day, and it is not long before
they are past their prime.

Some early plants which have now almost disappeared from Eastern Massachusetts are still found
near Worcester in the greatest abundance,--as the larger Yellow Violet, the Red Trillium, the
Dwarf Ginseng, the Clintonia or Wild Lily-of-the-Valley, and the pretty fringed Polygala, which
Miss Cooper christened "Gay-Wings." Others again are now rare in this vicinity, and growing
rarer, though still abundant a hundred miles farther inland. In several bits of old swampy
wood one may still find, usually close together, the Hobble-Bush and the Painted Trillium,
the Mitella, or Bishop's-Cap, and the snowy Tiarella. Others again have entirely vanished within
ten years, and that in some cases without any adequate explanation. The dainty white Corydalis,
profanely called "Dutchman's-Breeches," and the quaint woolly Ledum, or Labrador Tea, have
disappeared within that time. The beautiful Linnaea is still found annually, but flowers no
more; as is also the case, in all but one distant locality, with the once abundant Rhododendron.
Nothing in Nature has for me a more fascinating interest than these secret movements of vegetation,--the
sweet blind instinct with which flowers cling to old domains until absolutely compelled to
forsake them. How touching is the fact, now well known, that salt-water plants still flower
beside the Great Lakes, yet dreaming of the time when those waters were briny as the sea! Nothing
in the demonstrations of Geology seems grander than the light lately thrown by Professor Gray,
from the analogies between the flora of Japan and of North America, upon the successive epochs
of heat which led the wandering flowers along the Arctic lands, and of cold which isolated
them once more. Yet doubtless these humble movements of our local plants may be laying up results
as important, and may hereafter supply evidence of earth's changes upon some smaller scale.

May expands to its prime of beauty; the summer birds come with the fruit-blossoms, the gardens
are deluged with bloom and the air with melody, while in the woods the timid spring-flowers
fold themselves away in silence and give place to a brighter splendor. On the margin of some
quiet swamp a myriad of bare twigs seem suddenly overspread with purple butterflies, and we
know that the Rhodora is in bloom. Wordsworth never immortalized a flower more surely than
Emerson this, and it needs no weaker words; there is nothing else in which the change from
nakedness to beauty is so sudden, and when you bring home the great mass of blossoms they appear
all ready to flutter away again from your hands and leave you disenchanted.

At the same time the beautiful Cornel-tree is in perfection; startling as a tree of the tropics,
it flaunts its great flowers high up among the forest-branches, intermingling its long slender
twigs with theirs, and garnishing them with alien blooms. It is very available for household
decoration, with its four great creamy petals,--flowers they are not, but floral involucres,--each
with a fantastic curl and stain at its tip, as if the fireflies had alighted on them and scorched
them; and yet I like it best as it peers out in barbaric splendor from the delicate green of
young Maples. And beneath it grows often its more abundant kinsman, the Dwarf Cornel, with
the same four great petals enveloping its floral cluster, but lingering low upon the ground,--an
herb whose blossoms mimic the statelier tree.

The same rich creamy hue and texture show themselves in the Wild Calla, which grows at this
season in dark, sequestered water-courses, and sometimes well rivals, in all but size, that
superb whiteness out of a land of darkness, the Ethiopic Calla of the conservatory. At this
season, too, we seek another semi-aquatic rarity, whose homely name cannot deprive it of a
certain garden-like elegance, the Buckbean. This is one of the shy plants which yet grow in
profusion within their own domain. I have found it of old in Cambridge, and then upon the pleasant
shallows of the Artichoke, that loveliest tributary of the Merrimack, and I have never seen
it where it occupied a patch more than a few yards square, while yet within that space the
multitudinous spikes grow always tall and close, reminding one of hyacinths, when in perfection,
but more delicate and beautiful. The only locality I know for it in this vicinity lies seven
miles away, where a little inlet from the lower winding bays of Lake Quinsigamond goes stealing
up among a farmer's hay-fields, and there, close beside the public road and in full of the
farm-house, this rare creature fills the water. But to reach it we commonly row down the lake
to a sheltered lagoon, separated from the main lake by a long island which is gradually forming
itself like the coral isles, growing each year denser with alder thickets where the king-birds
build;--there leave the boat among the lily-leaves, and take a lane which winds among the meadows
and gives a fitting avenue for the pretty thing we seek. But it is not safe to vary many days
from the twentieth of May, for the plant is not long in perfection, and is past its prime when
the lower blossoms begin to wither on the stem.

But should we miss this delicate adjustment of time, it is easy to console ourselves with bright
armfuls of Lupine, which bounteously flowers for six weeks along our lake-side, ranging from
the twenty-third of May to the sixth of July. The Lupine is one of our most travelled plants;
for, though never seen off the American continent, it stretches to the Pacific, and is found
upon the Arctic coast. On these banks of Lake Quinsigamond it grows in great families, and
should be gathered in masses and placed in a vase by itself; for it needs no relief from other
flowers, its own soft leaves afford background enough, and though the white variety rarely
occurs, yet the varying tints of blue upon the same stalk are a perpetual gratification to
the eye. I know not why shaded blues should be so beautiful in flowers, and yet avoided as
distasteful in ladies' fancy-work; but it is a mystery like that which repudiates blue-and-green
from all well-regulated costumes, while Nature yet evidently prefers it to any other combination
in her wardrobe.

Another constant ornament of the end of May is the large pink Lady's-Slipper, or Moccason-Flower,
the "Cypripedium not due till to-morrow" which Emerson attributes to the note-book of Thoreau,--to-morrow,
in these parts, meaning about the twentieth of May. It belongs to the family of Orchids, a
high-bred race, fastidious in habits, sensitive as to abodes. Of the ten species named as rarest
among American endogenous plants by Dr. Gray, in his valuable essay on the statistics of our
Northern Flora, all but one are Orchids. And even an abundant species, like the present, retains
the family traits in its person, and never loses its high-born air and its delicate veining.
I know a grove where it can be gathered by the hundreds within a half-acre, and yet I never
can divest myself of the feeling that each specimen is a choice novelty. But the actual rarity
occurs, at least in this region, when one finds the smaller and more beautiful Yellow Moccason-Flower,--parviflorum,--which
accepts only our very choicest botanical locality, the "Rattlesnake Ledge" on Tatessit Hill,--and
may, for aught I know, have been the very plant which Elsie Venner laid upon her school-mistress's
desk.

June is an intermediate month between the spring and summer flowers. Of the more delicate early
blossoms, the Dwarf Cornel, the Solomon's-Seal, and the Yellow Violet still linger in the woods,
but rapidly make way for larger masses and more conspicuous hues. The meadows are gorgeous
with Clover, Buttercups, and Wild Geranium; but Nature is a little chary for a week or two,
maturing a more abundant show. Meanwhile one may afford to take some pains to search for another
rarity, almost disappearing from this region,--the lovely Pink Azalea. It still grows plentifully
in a few sequestered places, selecting woody swamps to hide itself; and certainly no shrub
suggests, when found, more tropical associations. Those great, nodding, airy, fragrant clusters,
tossing far above one's head their slender cups of honey, seem scarcely to belong to our sober
zone, any more than the scarlet tanager which sometimes builds its nest beside them. They appear
bright exotics, which have wandered into our woods, and seem too happy to feel any wish for
exit. And just as they fade, their humbler sister in white begins to bloom, and carries on
through the summer the same intoxicating fragrance.

But when June is at its height, the sculptured chalices of the Mountain Laurel begin to unfold,
and thenceforward, for more than a month, extends the reign of this our woodland queen. I know
not why one should sigh after the blossoming gorges of the Himalaya, when our forests are all
so crowded with this glowing magnificence,--rounding the tangled swamps into smoothness, lighting
up the underwoods, overtopping the pastures, lining the rural lanes, and rearing its great
pinkish masses till they meet overhead. The color ranges from the purest white to a perfect
rose-pink, and there is an inexhaustible vegetable vigor about the whole thing, which puts
to shame those tenderer shrubs that shrink before the progress of cultivation. There is the
Rhododendron, for instance, a plant of the same natural family with the Laurel and the Azalea,
and looking more robust and woody than either: it once grew in many localities in this region,
and still lingers in a few, without consenting either to die or to blossom, and there is only
one remote place from which any one now brings into our streets those large luxuriant flowers,
waving white above the dark green leaves, and bearing "just a dream of sunset on their edges,
and just a breath from the green sea in their hearts." But the Laurel, on the other hand, maintains
its ground, imperturbable and almost impassable, on every hill-side, takes no hints, suspects
no danger, and nothing but the most unmistakable onset from spade or axe can diminish its profusion.
Gathering it on the most lavish scale seems only to serve as wholesome pruning; nor can I conceive
that the Indians, who once ruled over this whole county from Wigwam Hill, could ever have found
it more inconveniently abundant than now. We have perhaps no single spot where it grows in
such perfect picturesqueness as at "The Laurels," on the Merrimack, just above Newburyport,--a
whole hill-side scooped out and the hollow piled solidly with flowers, the pines curving around
it above, and the river encircling it below, on which your boat glides along, and you look
up through glimmering arcades of bloom. But for the last half of June it monopolizes everything
in the Worcester woods,--no one picks anything else; and it fades so slowly that I have found
a perfect blossom on the last day of July.

At the same time with this royalty of the woods, the queen of the water ascends her throne,
for a reign as undisputed and far more prolonged. The extremes of the Water-Lily in this vicinity,
so far as I have known, are the eighteenth of June and the thirteenth of October,--a longer
range than belongs to any other conspicuous wild-flower, unless we except the Dandelion and
Houstonia. It is not only the most fascinating of all flowers to gather, but more available
for decorative purposes than almost any other, if it can only be kept fresh. The best method
for this purpose, I believe, is to cut the stalk very short before placing in the vase; then,
at night, the lily will close and the stalk curl upward;--refresh them by changing the water,
and in the morning the stalk will be straight and the flower open.

From this time forth Summer has it all her own way. After the first of July the yellow flowers
begin to watch the yellow fireflies; Hawkweeds, Loosestrifes, Primroses bloom, and the bushy
Wild Indigo. The variety of hues increases; delicate purple Orchises bloom in their chosen
haunts, and Wild Roses blush over hill and dale. On peat meadows the Adder's-Tongue Arethusa
(now called Pogonia) flowers profusely, with a faint, delicious perfume,--and its more elegant
cousin, the Calopogon, by its side. In this vicinity we miss the blue Harebell, the identical
harebell of Ellen Douglas, which I remember waving its exquisite flowers along the banks of
the Merrimack, and again at Brattleboro', below the cascade in the village, where it has climbed
the precipitous sides of old buildings, and nods inaccessibly from their crevices, in that
picturesque spot, looking down on the hurrying river. But with this exception, there is nothing
wanting here of the flowers of early summer.

The more closely one studies Nature, the finer her adaptations grow. For instance, the change
of seasons is analogous to a change of zones, and summer assimilates our vegetation to that
of the tropics.

In those lands, Humboldt has remarked, one misses the beauty of wild-flowers in the grass,
because the luxuriance of vegetation develops everything into shrubs. But every midsummer reveals
the same tendency. In early spring, when all is bare, and small objects are easily made prominent,
the wild-flowers are generally delicate. Later, when all verdure is profusely expanded, these
miniature strokes would be lost, and Nature then practises landscape-gardening in large, lights
up the copses with great masses of White Alder, makes the roadsides gay with Aster and Golden-Rod,
and tops the tall coarse Meadow-Grass with nodding Lilies and tufted Spiraea. One instinctively
follows these plain hints, and gathers bouquets sparingly in spring and exuberantly in summer.

The use of wild-flowers for decorative purposes merits a word in passing, for it is unquestionably
a branch of high art in favored hands. It is true that we are bidden, on high authority, to
love the wood-rose and leave it on its stalk; but against this may be set the saying of Bettine,
that "all flowers which are broken become immortal in the sacrifice"; and certainly the secret
harmonies of these fair creatures are so marked and delicate that we do not understand them
till we try to group floral decorations for ourselves. The most successful artists will not,
for instance, consent to put those together which do not grow together; Nature understands
her business, and distributes her masses and backgrounds unerringly. Yonder soft and feathery
Meadow-Sweet longs to be combined with Wild Roses: it yearns towards them in the field, and,
after withering in the hand most readily, it revives in water as if to be with them in the
vase. In the same way the White Spiraea serves as natural background for the Field-Lilies.
These lilies, by the way, are the brightest adornment of our meadows during the short period
of their perfection. We have two species: one slender, erect, solitary, scarlet, looking up
to heaven with all its blushes on; the other clustered, drooping, pale-yellow. I never saw
the former in such profusion as last week, on the bare summit of Wachusett. The granite ribs
have there a thin covering of crispest moss, spangled with the white starry blossoms of the
Mountain Cinquefoil; and as I lay and watched the red lilies that waved their innumerable urns
around me, it needed but little imagination to see a thousand altars, sending visible flames
forever upward to the answering sun.

August comes: the Thistles are out, beloved of butterflies; deeper and deeper tints, more passionate
intensities of color, prepare the way for the year's decline. A wealth of gorgeous Golden-Rod
waves over all the hills, and enriches every bouquet one gathers; its bright colors command
the eye, and it is graceful as an elm. Fitly arranged, it gives a bright relief to the superb
beauty of the Cardinal-Flowers, the brilliant blue-purple of the Vervain, the pearl-white of
the Life-Everlasting, the delicate lilac of the Monkey-Flower, the soft pink and white of the
Spiraeas,--for the white yet lingers,--all surrounded by trailing wreaths of blossoming Clematis.

But the Cardinal-Flower is best seen by itself, and, indeed, needs the surroundings of its
native haunts to display its fullest beauty. Its favorite abode is along the dank mossy stones
of some black and winding brook, shaded with overarching bushes, and running one long stream
of scarlet with these superb occupants. It seems amazing how anything so brilliant can mature
in such a darkness. When a ray of sunlight strays in upon it, the wondrous creature seems to
hover on the stalk, ready to take flight, like some lost tropic bird. There is a spot whence
I have in ten minutes brought away as many as I could hold in both arms, some bearing fifty
blossoms on a single stalk; and I could not believe that there was such another mass of color
in the world. Nothing cultivated is comparable to them; and, with all the talent lately lavished
on wild-flower painting, I have never seen the peculiar sheen of these petals in the least
degree delineated. It seems some new and separate tint, equally distinct from scarlet and from
crimson, a splendor for which there is as yet no name, but only the reality.

It seems the signal of autumn, when September exhibits the first Barrel-Gentian by the roadside;
and there is a pretty insect in the meadows--the Mourning-Cloak Moth it might be called--which
gives coincident warning. The innumerable Asters mark this period with their varied and wide-spread
beauty; the meadows are full of rose-colored Polygala, of the white spiral spikes of the Ladies'-Tresses,
and of the fringed loveliness of the Gentian. This flower, always unique and beautiful, opening
its delicate eyelashes every morning to the sunlight, closing them again each night, has also
a thoughtful charm about it as the last of the year's especial darlings. It lingers long, each
remaining blossom growing larger and more deep in color, as with many other flowers; and after
it there is nothing for which to look forward, save the fantastic Witch-Hazel.

On the water, meanwhile, the last White Lilies are sinking beneath the surface, the last gay
Pickerel-Weed is gone, though the rootless plants of the delicate Bladder-Wort, spreading over
acres of shallows, still impurple the wide, smooth surface. Harriet Prescott says that some
souls are like the Water-Lilies, fixed, yet floating. But others are like this graceful purple
blossom, floating unfixed, kept in place only by its fellows around it, until perhaps a breeze
comes, and, breaking the accidental cohesion, sweeps them all away.

The season reluctantly yields its reign, and over the quiet autumnal landscape everywhere,
even after the glory of the trees is past, there are tints and fascinations of minor beauty.
Last October, for instance, in walking, I found myself on a little knoll, looking northward.
Overhead was a bower of climbing Waxwork, with its yellowish pods scarce disclosing their scarlet
berries,--a wild Grape-vine, with its fruit withered by the frost into still purple raisins,--and
yellow Beech-leaves, detaching themselves with an effort audible to the ear. In the foreground
were blue Raspberry-stems, yet bearing greenish leaves,--pale-yellow Witch-Hazel, almost leafless,--purple
Viburnum-berries,--the silky cocoons of the Milkweed,--and, amid the underbrush, a few lingering
Asters and Golden-Rods, Ferns still green, and Maidenhair bleached white. In the background
were hazy hills, white Birches bare and snow-like, and a Maple half-way up a sheltered hill-side,
one mass of canary-color, its fallen leaves making an apparent reflection on the earth at its
foot,--and then a real reflection, fused into a glassy light intenser than itself, upon the
smooth, dark stream below.

The beautiful disrobing suggested the persistent and unconquerable delicacy of Nature, who
shrinks from nakedness and is always seeking to veil her graceful boughs,--if not with leaves,
then with feathery hoar-frost, ermined snow, or transparent icy armor.

But, after all, the fascination of summer lies not in any details, however perfect, but in
the sense of total wealth which summer gives. Wholly to enjoy this, one must give one's self
passively to it, and not expect to reproduce it in words. We strive to picture heaven, when
we are barely at the threshold of the inconceivable beauty of earth. Perhaps the truant boy
who simply bathes himself in the lake and then basks in the sunshine, dimly conscious of the
exquisite loveliness around him, is wiser, because humbler, than is he who with presumptuous
phrases tries to utter it. In after-years the memory of books seems barren or vanishing, compared
with the immortal bequest of hours like these. Other sources of illumination seem cisterns
only; these are fountains. They may not increase the mere quantity of available thought, but
they impart to it a quality which is priceless. No man can measure what a single hour with
Nature may have contributed to the moulding of his mind. The influence is self-renewing, and
if for a long time it baffles expression by reason of its fineness, so much the better in the end.

The soul is like a musical instrument: it is not enough that it be framed for the very most
delicate vibration, but it must vibrate long and often before the fibres grow mellow to the
finest waves of sympathy. I perceive that in the veery's carolling, the clover's scent, the
glistening of the water, the waving wings of butterflies, the sunset tints, the floating clouds,
there are attainable infinitely more subtile modulations of delight than I can yet reach the
sensibility to discriminate, much less describe. If, in the simple process of writing, one
could physically impart to this page the fragrance of this spray of azalea beside me, what
a wonder would it seem!--and yet one ought to be able, by the mere use of language, to supply
to every reader the total of that white, honeyed, trailing sweetness, which summer insects
haunt and the Spirit of the Universe loves. The defect is not in language, but in men. There
is no conceivable beauty of blossom so beautiful as words,--none so graceful, none so perfumed.
It is possible to dream of combinations of syllables so delicious that all the dawning and
decay of summer cannot rival their perfections, nor winter's stainless white and azure match
their purity and their charm. To write them, were it possible, would be to take rank with Nature;
nor is there any other method, even by music, for human art to reach so high.

ONE OF MY CLIENTS.

After a practice in the legal profession of more than twenty years, I am persuaded that a more
interesting volume could not be written than the revelations of a lawyer's office. The plots
there discovered before they were matured,--the conspiracies there detected

  "Ere they hail reached their last fatal periods,"--

the various devices of the Prince of Darkness,--the weapons with which he fought, and those
by which he was overcome,--the curious phenomena of intense activity and love of gain,--the
arts of the detective, and those by which he was eluded,--and the never-ending and ever-varying
surprises and startling incidents,--would present such a panorama of human affairs as would
outfly our fancy, and modify our unbelief in that much-abused doctrine of the depravity of
our nature.

To illustrate, let me introduce to you "one of my clients," whom I will call Mr. Sidney, and
with whom, perhaps, you may hereafter become better acquainted. His counterpart in personal
appearance you may find in the thoroughfare at, any hour of the day. There is nothing about
him to attract attention. He is nearly forty-five years of age, and weighs, perhaps, two hundred
pounds. His face is florid and his hair sandy. His eyes are small, piercing, and gray. His
motions are slow, and none are made without a purpose. Intellectually he is above the average,
and his perceptive faculties are well developed. The wrinkles in his lips are at right angles
with his mouth, and a close observer might detect in his countenance self-reliance and tenacity
of will and purpose. But with ordinary faculties much may be accomplished: in this sketch,
let us see how much in two particulars.

His first entrance into my office was in the spring of 1853. He handed me a package of papers,
saying, if I would name an hour for a professional consultation, he would be punctual. The
time was agreed upon and he withdrew. On examination of his papers, I found that his letters
of introduction were from several United States Senators, Judges of Supreme Courts, Cabinet
Officers, and Governors, and one was from a Presidential candidate in the last election. Those
directed specially to me were from a Senator and a Member of Congress, both of whom were lawyers
and my personal friends, men in whose judgment I placed great confidence. They all spoke in
the highest terms of Mr. Sidney's integrity, ability, and energy, and concluded by saying I
might implicitly rely upon his judgment and be governed by his counsels.

What man of the masses can this one be, thus heralded by the authorities of the nation, and
what his labor, so commended by the rulers? I glanced at him mentally again. Perhaps he is
laboring for the endowment of some great literary or benevolent institution, for the building
of a national monument. No. Perhaps he has some theory that thousands of facts must prove and
illustrate; or it may be he is a voracious gatherer of statistics. The last is the most probable;
but the more I mused, the more the fire burned within me to know more of his mission.

I awaited impatiently his coming. It was on the stroke of the hour appointed. The object of
that interview may not with propriety be stated, nor the results described; but it may be said
that that hour was the most intensely exciting of any of my professional life, causing the
blood to chill and boil alternately. The business was so peculiar, and connected with men so
exalted in position, and conducted with such wonderful ability and tact, that now, years after,
scarcely a day passes that my mind does not revert to those hours and do homage to those transcendent
abilities by which it was conducted, till I sometimes think the possessor of them was an overmatch
for Lucifer himself. My eyes were for the first time opened to the marvellous in his department
of knowledge and art; and the region of impossibility was materially circumscribed, and the
domain of the prince of the powers of the air extended ad infinitum. Into those regions it
is not my present purpose to delve.

After a business acquaintance of several years with Mr. Sidney, I have learned that he was
formerly a rich manufacturer, and that he was nearly ruined in fortune by the burning of several
warehouses in which he had stored a large amount of merchandise that was uninsured. The owners
of these store-houses were men of wealth, influence, and respectability. Alone of all the citizens,
Mr. Sidney suspected that the block was intentionally set on fire to defraud the insurance-offices.
Without any aid or knowledge of other parties, he began an investigation, and ascertained that
the buildings were insured far beyond their value. He also ascertained that insurance had been
obtained on a far greater amount of merchandise than the stores could contain; and still further,
that the goods insured, as being deposited there, were not so deposited at the time of the
fire. He likewise procured a long array of facts tending to fix the burning upon the "merchant
princes" who held the policies. To his mind, they were convincing. He therefore confronted
these men, accused them of the arson, and demanded payment for his own loss. This was, of course,
declined. Whereupon he gave them formal notice, that, if his demand were not liquidated within
thirty days, never thereafter would an opportunity be afforded for a settlement. That the notice
produced peculiar excitement was evident. Yet the thirty days elapsed and his claim was not
adjusted.

From that hour, with a just appreciation of the enormity of the offence which he believed to
have been committed, he consecrated his vast energies to the detection of crime. His whole
soul was fired almost to frenzy with the greatness of his work, and he pursued it with a firmness
of principle and fixedness of purpose that seemed almost madness, till he exposed to the world
the most stupendous league of robbers ever dreamed of, extending into every State and Territory
of the Union, and numbering, to his personal knowledge, over seven hundred men of influence
and power, whose business as a copartnership was forgery, counterfeiting, burglary, arson,
and any other crimes that might afford rich pecuniary remuneration.

I will not now stop to describe the organization of this band, which is as perfect as that
of any corporation; nor the enormous resources at its command, being computed by millions;
nor the great respectability of its directors and State agents; nor the bloody oaths and forfeitures
by which the members are bound together; nor the places of their annual meetings; nor a thousand
other particulars, more startling than anything in fiction or history. Nor will I enumerate
the great number of convictions of members of this gang for various offences through Mr. Sidney's
efforts. Prosecuting no other parties than these,--thwarting them in those defences that had
never before failed,--testifying in open court against the character of their witnesses, who
appeared to be polished gentlemen, and enumerating the offences of which they had been guilty,--and
harassing them by all legal and legitimate means, he gathered around him a storm that not one
man in a thousand could have withstood for an hour. Eleven times was food analyzed that had
been suspiciously set before him, and in each instance poison was detected in it; while in
hundreds of instances he declined to receive from unknown hands presents about which hung similar
suspicions. Numerous were the infernal-machines sent him, the explosion of some of which he
escaped as if by miracle, and several exploded in his own dwelling. Without number were the
anonymous letters he received, threatening his life, if he did not desist from prosecuting
this band of robbers. Yet not for one moment swerved from his purpose, he moved unharmed through
ten thousand perils, till at last he fell a victim to the enemy that had so long been hunting
his life. On no one has his mantle fallen.

His sole object in life seemed to be the breaking-up of this villanous gang of plunderers,
and he pursued it with a genius and strength, a devotion, self-sacrifice, and true heroism,
that are deserving of immortality.

Not long before his death, while one of the directors of this band was confined in prison at
Mr. Sidney's instigation, awaiting a preliminary examination, he sent for Mr. Sidney and offered
him one hundred thousand dollars, if he would desist from pursuing him alone. Mr. Sidney replied,
that he had many times before been offered the like sum, if he would cease prosecuting the
directors, and that the same reason which had inclined him to reject that proposition would
compel him to refuse this. Whereupon the director offered, as an additional inducement, one-half
of the money taken from the messenger of the Newport banks, while on his way to Providence
to redeem their bills at the Merchants Bank, and also the mint where they had coined the composition
that had passed current for years through all the banks and banking-houses of the country,
and which stood every test that could be applied, without the destruction of the coin itself,
which mint had cost its owners upwards of two hundred thousand dollars. All of which Mr. Sidney
indignantly rejected. And it was not till the year after his death that the coin became known,
when it was also reported and believed that a million and a quarter of the same was locked
up in the vaults of the--Government.

The United States Government sought Mr. Sidney's services, as appears of record. Those high
in authority had decided on his employment, a fact which in less than six hours thereafter
was known to the directors, and within that space of time five of them had arrived in Washington
and paid over to their attorney the sum of thirty-five hundred dollars for some purpose,--the
attorney being no less a personage than an honorable member of a supreme court. The service
desired of Mr. Sidney he was willing to perform, on the condition that he should not be called
upon to prosecute any other parties than those to whose conviction he had sworn to devote his life.

As a detective, Mr. Sidney was unequalled in this country. Vidocq may have been his superior
in dissimulation, but in that alone. He certainly had not a tithe of Mr. Sidney's genius and
strength of mind and moral power to discern the truth, though never so deeply hidden, and to
expose it to the clear light of day.

  "His blood and judgment were so well commingled,"

that his conclusions seemed akin to prophecy.

But it is not as a detective that Mr. Sidney is here presented. This slight sketch of this
remarkable man is given, that the reader may more willingly believe that he possessed, among
other wonderful powers, one that is not known ever to have been attained to such a degree by
any other individual, namely:--

The power of discerning, in a single specimen of handwriting, the character, the occupation,
the habits, the temperament, the health, the age, the sex, the size, the nationality, the benevolence
or the penuriousness, the boldness or the timidity, the morality or the immorality, the affectation
or the hypocrisy, and often the intention of the writer.

At the age of thirty-five, the genius of Mr. Sidney as a physiognomist, expert, and detective,
remained wholly undeveloped. He was not aware, nor were his friends, of his wonderful powers
of observation, dissection, and deduction. Nor had he taken his first lesson by being brought
in contact with the rogues. How, then, did he acquire this almost miraculous power?

After he had ascertained the names of the directors and State agents of the band, he collected
many hundred specimens of their handwriting. These he studied with that energy which was equalled
only by his patience. In a surprisingly short time he first of all began to perceive the differences
between a moral and an immoral signature. Afterwards he proceeded to study the occupation,
age, habits, temperament, and all the other characteristics of the writers, and in this he
was equally successful. If this be doubted by any, let him collect a number of signatures of
Frenchmen, Englishmen, Germans, and Americans, or, what is still better, of Jews of all nations,
and at least in the latter instance, with ordinary perceptive faculties, there will be no difficulty
in determining the question of nationality; a person with half an eye need never mistake the
handwriting of a Jew. Many can detect pride and affectation, and most persons the sex, in handwriting,
how much soever it may be disguised.

Why, then, should it be strange, if remarkable powers of observation, analysis, and patient
and energetic study should accomplish much more? In this department the Government had afforded
Mr. Sidney great facilities, till at last he would take the letters dropped during the night
in the post-office of a great city, and as rapidly as a skilful cashier could detect a counterfeit
in counting bank-bills, and with unerring certainty, he would throw out those suspiciously
superscribed. "In each of these nine," he would say, "there is no letter, but money only. This
parcel is from the W--Street office. These are directed to men that are not called by these
names: they are fictitious, and assumed for iniquitous purposes. Those are from thieves to
thieves, and hint at opportunities," and so on.

Travelling over the principal railways of the country without charge, entertained at hotels
where compensation was declined, Mr. Sidney was in some instances induced to impart to his
friends some of that knowledge which he took much pains to conceal, believing that by so doing
he should best serve the great purposes of his life. Whether he desired this remarkable power
to be kept from the rogues, or whether he thought he should be too much annoyed by being called
upon as an expert in handwriting in civil cases, or what his purpose was, is not known, and
probably a large number of his intimate friends are not aware of his genius in this.

On one occasion he was in a Canadian city for the first time, and stopped at a principal hotel.
When about to depart, he was surprised that his host declined compensation. The landlord then
requested Mr. Sidney to give him the character of a man whose handwriting he produced. Mr.
Sidney consented, and, having retired to the private office, gave the writer's age within a
year, his nationality, being a native-born Frenchman, his height and size, being very short
and fleshy, his temperament and occupation; and described him as a generous, high-toned, public-spirited
man, of strong religious convictions and remarkable modesty: all of which the landlord pronounced
to be entirely correct.

The hotel-register was then brought, and to nearly every name Mr. Sidney gave the marked character
or peculiarity of the man. One was very nervous, another very tall and lean; this one was penurious,
that one stubborn; this was a farmer, and that a clergyman; this name was written in a frolic;
this was a genuine name, though not written by the man himself,--and that written by the man
himself, but it was not his true name. Of the person last specified the clerk desired a full
description, and obtained it in nearly these words:--

"He, Sir, was not christened by that name. He could never have written it before he was thirty.
He has assumed it within a year. The character is bad,--very bad. I judge he is a gambler by
profession, and--something worse. He evidently is not confined to one department of rascality.
He was born and educated in New England, is aged about thirty-nine, is about five feet ten
in height, and is broad-shouldered and stout. His nerves are strong, and he is bold, hypocritical,
and mean. He is just the kind of man to talk like a saint and act like a devil."

The little company raised their hands in holy horror.

"As to age, size, nerve, etc.," said the landlord, "you are entirely correct, but in his moral
character you are much mistaken"; and the clerk laughed outright.

"Not mistaken at all," replied Mr. Sidney; "the immorality of the signature is the most perspicuous,
and it is more than an even chance that he has graduated from a State's prison. At any rate,
he will show his true character wherever he remains a year."

"But, my dear Sir, you are doing the greatest possible damage to your reputation; he is a boarder
of mine, and"----

"You had better be rid of him," chimed in Mr. Sidney.

"Why, Mr. Sidney, he is the clergyman who has been preaching very acceptably at the ---- Church
these two months!"

"Just as I told you," said Mr. Sidney; "he is a hypocrite and a rascal by profession. Will
you allow me to demonstrate this?"

The landlord assented. A servant was called, and Mr. Sidney, having written on a card, sent
it to the clergyman's room, with the request that he would come immediately to the office.
It was delivered, and the landlord waited patiently for his Reverence.

"You think he will come?" asked Mr. Sidney.

The landlord replied affirmatively.

Mr. Sidney shook his head, and said,--"You will see."

A short time after, the servant was again ordered to make a reconnoissance, and reported that
there was no response to his knocking, and that the door was locked on the inside. Whereupon
Mr. Sidney expressed the hope that the religious society were responsible for the board, for
he would never again lead that flock like a shepherd. It was subsequently ascertained that
the parson had in a very irreverent manner slipped down the spout to the kitchen and jumped
from there to the ground, and, what is "very remarkable," like the load of voters upset by
Sam Weller into the canal, "was never heard of after."[A]

[Footnote A: There is a curious story connected with this "clergyman," which may yet appear
in the biography of Mr. S.]

       *       *       *       *       *

"Individual handwriting," says Lavater, "is inimitable. The more I compare the different handwritings
which fall in my way, the more am I confirmed in the idea that they are so many expressions,
so many emanations, of the character of the writer. Every country, every nation, every city
has its peculiar handwriting." And the same might be said of painting; for, if one hundred
painters copy the same figure, an artist will distinguish the copyist.

Some years since, a certain bank placed in my hands two promissory notes for large amounts,
purporting to be signed by a Mr. Temple and indorsed by a Mr. Conway, and which both maker
and indorser pronounced forgeries. Both notes were written on common white paper, and were
purchased by the bank of a certain broker at a time when it was difficult to make loans by
discount in the usual manner. Before the maturity of the notes, the broker, who was a Jew,
had left for parts unknown. He left behind him no liabilities, unless he might be holden for
the payment of the notes above specified, and several others signed and indorsed in the same
manner in the hands of other parties. Several attempts had been made by professional experts
to trace resemblances between the forgeries and the genuine handwriting of said Temple and
Conway, as well as the broker, but all had reluctantly come to the conclusion that the signatures
were as dissimilar as well could be. The cashier was exceedingly embarrassed by the fact that
Mr. Conway was one of the directors of the bank, and he was presumed to have been so familiar
with his signature as to be incapable of being deceived.

After a most diligent investigation and the expenditure of much time and money, and after skilful
experts and detectives had given up in despair of ascertaining either the whereabouts of the
Jew or anything further till he could be produced, the holders of this paper had settled down
quietly in the belief that the broker was the guilty party and that all further effort was
useless. At this point of time, when all excitement had subsided, these notes came into my
possession. I immediately telegraphed to Mr. Sidney, and it was with great joy that I received
the reply that he was on his way. At three o'clock in the morning I met him at the railroad
station. He complimented me by saying there was not another man living for whom he would have
left the city of ---- on a similar message. I thanked him, and we walked to the office. Before
arriving there, I had merely informed him that I desired his services in the investigation
of a forgery that baffled our art. He demanded all the papers. I produced the forged notes,
several genuine checks and letters of Mr. Temple and Mr. Conway, and several specimens of the
handwriting of the broker.

Long as I live I can never forget the almost supernatural glow that came over his features.
I could almost see the halo. No language can describe such a marked and rapid change of countenance.
His whole soul seemed wrapt in a delightful vision. I cannot say how long this continued, as
I was lost in admiration, as he was in contemplation. I spoke, but he seemed not to hear. At
last his muscles relaxed, and he began to breathe as if greatly fatigued. He wiped the perspiration
from his brow, and said, as if to himself,--

"Sure!"

I asked what was sure. A few minutes elapsed, and he said more loudly,--

"As sure as you are born,"--without seeming to have heard my inquiry.

I proposed to state what could be proved, and the suspicions that were entertained of the cashier.
He objected, and said,--

"I take my departure from these papers. Mr. Temple is aged thirty-eight, a large, well-built
man, full six feet high, strongly nerved, bold, proud, and fearless. His mind is active, and
in his day he has been professor in a college. He fares well and is fashionably dressed. I
think he is not in any legitimate business. He is a German by birth, though he has been in
this country several years. He is somewhat affected and immensely hypocritical. I think he
is a gambler and dealer in counterfeit money. He certainly is not confined to one department
of rascality. This is not the name by which he was christened, if indeed he was ever christened
at all. He could not have written it in his youth, and must have assumed it within a year and
a half." (Exact in every known particular.)

"Mr. Conway I at first thought an attorney-at-law, but he is not. I reckon he administers on
estates, acts as guardian, and settles up the affairs of the unfortunate in trade as their
assignee, in connection with his business of notary and note-shaver. He is aged fifty-six,
was born and educated in New England, and is probably a native of this city. He is tall, lean,
and bony. His nerves are not steady, and he is easily excited. He probably has the dyspepsia,
but he would not lose the writing of a deed to be rid of it. The remarkable feature of his
character is stinginess. His natural abilities being good and his mind strong, he must therefore
be a man of means, and I think it matters little to his conscience how he comes by his wealth.
At the same time, he has considerable pride and caution, which, with his interest, keep him
honest, as the world goes. If he were not an old bachelor, I should think better of his heart,
and he would be less miserly.

"The Jew's signature is the most honest of the three. Timidity is the marked character of the
man. He could not succeed in any department of roguery. It is physically, as well as mentally
and morally, impossible for him to have had any connection with the forgery. He would be frightened
out of his wits at the very suggestion of his complicity."

"And so, Mr. Sidney," said I, "you know all about these parties and the particulars of the
forgery?"

"Nothing whatever," he replied, "save by these specimens of their handwriting. I never heard
of the forgery, nor of these men, till this hour."

To which I replied,--

"I cannot believe that you can give such a perfectly accurate description of them (saving their
moral characters, of which I know little) without other means of knowledge. It must have been
that you knew Temple to be a German, Conway to be the most penurious old bachelor in town,
and the broker the most timid. And how, in the name of all that is marvellous, could you have
known Conway to be afflicted with dyspepsia?

"Then," answered Mr. Sidney, "you are not prepared to believe one other thing, more strange
and paradoxical than all the rest. Listen! These notes are forgeries both of the maker and
the indorser. And who think you are the criminals?"

"The Jew?"

"No."

"The cashier?"

"No. But, as sure as you are born, these notes are in the handwriting of Temple and Conway,
and the signatures are not only genuine, but they are forgeries also: for both had formed a
well-matured and deliberate design of disputing them before placing them on the paper. And,
Sir, from my notion of Conway's character and temperament, as expressed in his handwriting,
I venture the assertion that I can make him own it, and pay the notes. He shall even faint
away at my pleasure. Temple is another kind of man, and would never own it, were it ten times
proved."

A meeting of the directors of the bank was to be holden at nine o'clock of the same morning.
None of them knew Mr. Sidney, or were known by him. It was arranged that he should meet them,
Mr. Conway included, and exhibit his skill, and if he should convince them of his power of
divination, he should discuss the genuineness of the signatures of the supposed forgeries.

For several hours he was on trial before the board with a very large number of specimens of
handwriting of men of mark, and he astonished them all beyond measure by giving the occupation,
age, height, size, temperament, strength of nerve, nationality, morality, and other peculiarities
of every one of the writers. His success was not partial, it was complete. There was not simply
a preponderance of evidence, it was beyond a doubt. The directors did not question the fact;
but how was it done? Some thought mesmerism could account for it, and others thought it miraculous.

The first experiment was this. Each director wrote on a piece of paper the names of all the
board. Eleven lists were handed him, and he specified the writer of each by the manner in which
he wrote his own name. He then asked them to write their own or any other name, with as much
disguise as they pleased, and as many as pleased writing on the same piece of paper; and in
every instance he named the writer.

As an example of the other experiments, take this one. The superscription of a letter was shown
him. He began immediately:--

"A clergyman, without doubt, who reads his sermons, and is a little short-sighted. He is aged
sixty-one, is six feet high, weighs about one hundred and seventy, is lean, bony, obstinate,
irritable, economical, frank, and without a particle of hypocrisy or conceit. He is naturally
miserly, and bestows charity only from a sense of duty. His mind is methodical and strong,
and he is not a genius or an interesting preacher. If he has decided upon any doctrine or construction
of Scripture, it would be as impossible to change him as to make him over again."

The company began to laugh, when one of them said,--

"Come, come, Mr. Sidney, you are disclosing altogether too much of my father-in-law."

And now the supposed forged notes were handed him. He gave the characteristics of the signatures
very nearly as he had before done in the office, but more particularly and minutely. He analyzed
the handwriting,--showed the points of resemblance, where before none could be discerned,--showed
that the writing, interpreted by itself, was intended to be disguised,--explained the difference
between the different parts of the notes,--pointed out where the writer was firm in his purpose,
and his nerves well braced, and where his fears overcame his resolution,--where he had paused
to recover his courage, and for a considerable time,--where he had changed his pen, and how
the forgery was continued through several days,--what parts were done by Temple, and what by
Conway,--

  "Till all the interim
  Between the acting of the dreadful thing
  And the first motion"

was brought so vividly and truthfully to mind that Mr. Conway fell to the floor as if dead.
The cashier, relieved from a pressure that had for weary months been grinding his very soul,
burst into tears. A scene of strange excitement ensued, during which Mr. Conway muttered incoherent
sentences in condemnation of Temple and then of himself,--now with penitence, and then with
rage. Recovering his composure, he suggested the Jew as the guilty party. Mr. Sidney then dissected
the handwriting of the Jew, and demonstrated that there was as great a difference between his
chirography and a New-Englander's as between the English and the Chinese characters,--showed
how the Jew must have been exceedingly timid, and stated the probability that he had left the
city not because he had taken any part in the forgery, but because he had been frightened away.
Then turning to Conway, he gave him a lecture such as no mortal before ever gave or received.
The agony of Conway's mind so distorted his body as made it painful in the extreme to all beholders.
"His inmost soul seemed stung as by the bite of a serpent." When at last Mr. Sidney turned
and took from his valise a small steel safe, which Conway recognized as his own, "the terrors
of hell got hold of him," and his anguish was indescribably horrible. The little safe had been
by some unknown and unaccountable process taken from a larger one in Conway's office, and was
unopened. Neither Mr. Sidney nor the directors have ever seen its contents; but in consideration
that it should not be opened, Mr. Conway confessed his crime in the very form of Mr. Sidney's
description, paid the notes before leaving the bank, and remains a director to this day. As
is often the case, the greater criminal goes unwhipped of justice.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Sidney, besides the faculty I have described, had acquired another, less wonderful perhaps,
but still quite remarkable, and which was of incalculable assistance to him in the prosecution
of his Herculean labor. He was a most rare physiognomist. And by physiognomy is here intended,
not simply the art of discerning the character of the mind by the features of the face, but
also the art of discovering the qualities of the mind by the conformation of the body,--and
still further, (although it may not be a legitimate use of the word,) the power of distinguishing
the character, mental and moral, the capacity, occupation, and all the distinctive qualities
of a person by his figure, action, dress, deportment, and the like: for Sterne said well, that
"the wise man takes his hat from the peg very differently from a fool."

The ancient Egyptians acquired the greatest skill in this science; and Tacitus affirms, not
without reason, that their keen perception and acute observation, essential in communicating
their ideas in hieroglyphics, contributed largely to their success. Certainly, few better proofs
of the existence of the science have been furnished than that given by the Egyptian physiognomist
at Athens in the days of Plato. Zopyrus pronounced the face of Socrates to be that of a libertine.
The physiognomist being derided by the disciples of the great philosopher, Socrates reproved
them, saying that Zopyrus had spoken well, for in his younger days such indeed had been the
truth, and that he had overcome the proclivities of his nature by philosophy and the severest
discipline.

Pliny affirms that Apelles could trace the likeness of men so accurately that a physiognomist
could discover the ruling passion to which they were subject. Dante's characters, in his view
of Purgatory, are drawn with accurate reference to the principles of physiognomy; and Shakspeare
and Sterne, particularly the latter, were clever in the art; while Kempf and Zimmermann, in
their profession, are said seldom to have erred as physiognomists. Surely it is a higher authority
and more practical, which saith, "A wicked man walketh with a froward mouth; he speaketh with
his feet; he teacheth with his fingers.--A man is known by his look, and a wise man by the
air of his countenance." And yet again, "The wickedness of a woman changeth her face."

If it be true, as Sultzer declares, that there is not a living creature that is not more or
less skilled in physiognomy as a necessary condition of its existence, surely man, with all
his parts fitly joined together, should be the most expert; and there are circumstances and
conditions, as well as qualities of mind and body, which will conduct him more surely along
the pathway of his research, and direct him onward towards the goal of perfection. Consider,
then, the characteristics of Mr. Sidney, the circumstances by which he was surrounded, and
the school in which he was taught, in order to determine if there were in him the elements
of success.

Chiefest among the essential qualities is to be named his astonishing strength of nerve. No
danger could agitate him, however imminent or sudden. No power could deprive him of his imperturbable
coolness and courage. Perils seemed to render his mind more clear and his self-reliance more
firm. (And yet I have heard him say, that there was among the band of criminals before mentioned
one woman of greater strength of mind and nervous power than any person he had ever seen, whom
alone of all created beings, whether man or devil, he dreaded to encounter.) Had not Mr. Sidney
been thus potently armed, he must, without doubt or question, have become almost a monomaniac;
for, secondly, he was for years enraged almost to madness that his entire estate had been swept
from his grasp, as he believed, by the torch of the incendiary; and he was to the last degree
exasperated, and with a just indignation, that the merchant-princes who he supposed had occasioned
his impoverishment yet walked abroad with the confidence of the community, and were still trusted
by many a good man as the very salt of the city. Nevertheless, Mr. Sidney, solitary and alone,
had arraigned them before a criminal tribunal. He was therefore driven to his own resources,
and there was no place in his nature, or in the nature of things, for the first retrograde
step. All his vast energies were thenceforth consecrated to, and concentrated in, the detection
of crime. And from the time that he was refused payment for his loss, so far as my observation
extended, he seemed to have been governed by no other purpose in life than the extermination
of that great gang of robbers which he subsequently discovered. Add to these incentives and
capacities his extraordinary perceptive faculties and power of analytical observation, together
with his wonderful patience, and it must be granted that he was qualified to discover in any
incident connected with his pursuits more of its component parts than all other beholders,
and had greater opportunities than almost any other man by which to be informed how it is that
"the heart of a man changeth his countenance."

If I remember rightly, it was some two years after our acquaintance commenced that I became
aware of Mr. Sidney's proficiency as a physiognomist, and it was then communicated, not so
much by his choice as by a necessity, for the accomplishment of one of his purposes.

The object of Mr. Sidney's visit to the city of P----, at that time, was nothing less difficult
than the discovery and identification of an individual of whom no other knowledge or description
had been obtained than what could be extracted from the inspection, in another city, of a single
specimen of his handwriting in the superscription of a letter. So much from so little. Within
three days thereafter, with no other instrumentalities than what were suggested by Mr. Sidney's
expertness in deciphering character in handwriting and his proficiency as a physiognomist,
the result was reached and the object happily attained. In the prosecution of the enterprise,
it was important, if not essential, that I should believe that the data were sufficient by
which to arrive at a correct conclusion, and that I should confide in Mr. Sidney's skill in
order that there might be hearty coöperation.

My office was so situated, that from its windows could most advantageously be observed, and
for a considerable distance, the vast throng that ebbed and flowed, hour after hour, through
the great thoroughfares of the city. For the greater part of three consecutive days I sat by
Mr. Sidney's side, watching the changing crowd through the half-opened shutters, listening
incredulously, at first, to the practical application of his science to the unsuspecting individuals
below, till my derision was changed to admiration, and I was thoroughly convinced of his power.
As my friends of both sexes passed under the ordeal, it was intensely bewitching. Hour after
hour would he give, with rapidity and correctness, the occupation and peculiarity of character
and condition of almost every individual who passed. This was not occasional, but continuous.
The marked men were not singled out, but all were included. He was a stranger, and yet better
acquainted with the people than any of our citizens. And this was the manner of his speaking:--

"That physician has a better opinion of himself than the people have of him: he is superficial,
and makes up in effrontery what he lacks in qualification. The gambler yonder, with a toothpick
in his mouth, has of late succeeded in his tricks. The affairs of this kind-hearted grocer
are troubling him. Were we within a yard of that round-shouldered man from the country, we
should smell leather; for he works on his bench, and is unmarried. Here comes an atheist who
is a joker and stubborn as a mule. There goes a man of no business at all: very probably it
is the best occupation he is fitted for, as he has no concentrativeness. The schoolmistress
crossing the street is an accomplished teacher, is very sympathetic, and has great love of
approbation. That lawyer is a bachelor, and distrusts his own strength. This merchant should
give up the use of tobacco, and pay his notes before dinner, else he will become a dyspeptic.
Here comes a man of wealth who despises the common people and is miserly and hypocritical;
and next to him is a scamp. I think it is Burke who says, 'When the gnawing worm is within,
the impression of the ravage it makes is visible on the outside, which appears quite disfigured
by it': and in that young man the light that was within him has become darkness, and 'how great
is that darkness!'"

Of some qualities of mind he would occasionally decline to speak until he could see the features
in play, as in conversation. Some occupations he failed to discover, if the arms were folded,
or the hands in the pockets, or the body not in motion. It is not my purpose to specify any
of the rules by which he was governed, though they differed materially from those of Lavater,
Redfield, and others, nor the facts from which he drew his conclusions, but simply to give results.

I selected from the crowd acquaintances of marked character and standing, and obtained accurate
descriptions of them. Of one he said, "He is a good merchant, and has done and is doing a large
business. He carries his business home with him at night, as he should not. He has been wealthy,
and is now reduced in circumstances. His disaster weighs heavily upon him. He has a high sense
of honor, a keen conscience, and is a meek, religious man. He has great goodness of nature,
is very modest and retiring, has more ability than he supposes, and is a man of family and
very fond of his children."

Another he accurately described thus: "He is a mechanic, of a good mind, who has succeeded
so well that I doubt if he is in active business. Certainly he does not labor. He is very independent
and radical,--can be impudent, if occasion requires,--gives others all their rights, and pertinaciously
insists upon his own." Here the mechanic took his hands from his pocket. "Hold! I said he was
a mechanic. He is not,--he is a house-painter."

I desired to be informed by what indications he judged him to be a painter. He replied, that
he so judged from the general appearance and motions, and that it was difficult to specify.
I insisted, and he remarked that "the easy roll of his wrists was indicative."

After obtaining similar correct descriptions of men well known to me, I spied one whom I did
not know, and who was dressed peculiarly. I inquired his occupation, and Mr. Sidney, without
turning a glance towards me, and still gazing through the half-opened shutters, replied, "Yes!
you never saw him before, yourself. He is a stranger in town, as is evident from the fact of
his being dressed in his best suit, and by the manner of his taking observations. Besides,
there is no opportunity in these parts for him to follow his trade. He is a glass-blower. You
may perceive he is a little deaf, and the curvature of his motions also indicates his occupation."

Whether this description was correct or not I failed to ascertain.

Mr. Sidney contended that any man of ordinary perceptive faculties need never mistake a gambler,
as the marks on the tribe were as distinct as the complexion of the Ethiopian,--that, of honest
callings, dealers in cattle could be most easily discovered,--that immorality indicated its
kind invariably in the muscles of the face,--that sympathetic qualities, love and the desire
of being loved, taste and refinement,--were among the most perspicuous in the outline of the face.

A man of very gentlemanly appearance was approaching, whom Mr. Sidney pronounced a gambler,
and also engaged in some other branch of iniquity. His appearance was so remarkably good that
I doubted. He turned the corner, and immediately Mr. Sidney hastened to the street and soon
returned, saying he had ascertained his history: that he was in the counterfeiting department,--that
his conscience affected his nerves, and consequently his motions,--that he was a stranger in
town, and was restless and disquieted,--that he would not remain many hours here, as he had
an enterprise on hand, and was about it. I remarked, that, as the contrary never could be proved,
he was perfectly safe in his prophecy, when Mr. Sidney rose from his chair, and, approaching
me, slowly said, with great energy,--

"I will follow that man till it is proved."

The next day but one, I received a note from Mr. Sidney, simply saying, "I am on his track."
He followed the supposed counterfeiter to Philadelphia, where he ascertained that he had passed
five-dollar bills of the ---- bank of Connecticut. Mr. Sidney obtained the bills the gambler
had passed to compare with the genuine. Failing, however, to find any of the same denomination,
he presented the supposed counterfeits to a broker skilled in detecting bad bills, and was
surprised to be informed that they were genuine. At Baltimore, he repeated the inquiry at the
counter of a well-known banker relative to other similar bills, and received the same response.
So again in Washington, Pittsburg, Chicago, and several other cities whither he had followed
the suspected man, and invariably the reply of the cashier would be, "We will exchange our
bills for them, Sir." In some Western cities he was offered a premium on the bills he had collected.
At St. Louis he obtained a known genuine bill of the bank in question, and in company with
a broker proceeded to examine the two with a microscope. The broker pronounced the supposed
counterfeits to be genuine. In the mean time the gambler had left the city. Two days after,
Mr. Sidney had overtaken him. So great were his excitement and vexation that he could scarcely
eat or sleep. In a fit of desperation, without law and against law, he pounced upon the suspected
man and put him in irons. He beat a parley. It was granted, and the two went to the gambler's
apartments in company. In a conversation of several hours, Mr. Sidney extracted from him the
most valuable information relating to the gang he was so pertinaciously prosecuting, and received
into his possession forty-seven thousand dollars in counterfeits of the aforesaid bank, some
of which I now have in my possession, and which have been pronounced genuine by our most skilful
experts.

       *       *       *       *       *

It would be gratifying to all lovers of science to be informed that the practical knowledge
acquired by Mr. Sidney had been preserved, and that at least the elementary principles of the
arts in which he became so nearly perfect had been definitely explained and recorded. I am
not aware, however, that such is the fact, but am persuaded that his uniform policy of concealment
has deprived the world of much that would have been exceedingly entertaining and instructive.
That this knowledge has not been preserved is owing mainly to the fact that he considered it
of little importance, except as a means for the accomplishment of his purposes, and that those
purposes would be most effectually achieved by his withholding from the common gaze the instrumentality
by which they were to be attained. That he intended at some future period to make some communication
to the public I am well assured, and some materials were collected by him with this view; but
the hot pursuit of the great idea that he never for an hour lost sight of would not allow sufficient
rest from his labors, and he deferred the publication to those riper years of experience and
acquirement from which he could survey his whole past career.

It may be comforting for all rogues to know that he left behind him no note of that vast amount
of statistical knowledge which he possessed, whether appertaining to crimes or criminals in
general or in particular, or more especially to the band of robbers,--and that with him perished
all knowledge of this organization as such, and the names of all the parties therewith connected.
They also have the consolation, if there be any, of knowing that he was sent prematurely to
his grave by a subtle poison, administered by unknown hands and in an unknown manner and moment,
and that he died in the firm faith of immortality.

THE FOSSIL MAN.

The greater part must be content to be as though they had not been: to be found in the register
of God, not in the records of men.

What a mysterious and subtile pleasure there is in groping back through the early twilight
of human history! The mind thirsts and longs so to know the Beginning: who and what manner
of men those were who laid the first foundations of all that is now upon the earth: of what
intellectual power, of what degree of civilization, of what race and country. We wonder how
the fathers of mankind lived, what habitations they dwelt in, what instruments or tools they
employed, what crops they tilled, what garments they wore. We catch eagerly at any traces that
may remain of their faiths and beliefs and superstitions; and we fancy, as we gain a clearer
insight into them, that we are approaching more nearly to the mysterious Source of all life
in the soul. The germ, to our limited comprehension, seems nearer the Creator than the perfected
growth. Then the great problem of Origin forever attracts us on,--the multitudinous and intricate
questions relating to "the ordained becoming of beings": how the Creating Power has worked,
whether through an almost endless chain of gradual and advantageous changes, or by some sudden
and miraculous ictus, placing at once a completed body on the earth, as an abode and instrument
for a developed soul,--all these remote and difficult questions lead us on. And yet the search
for human origins, or the earliest historic and scientific evidences of man on the earth, is
but a groping in the dark.

We turn to the Hebrew and the inspired records; but we soon discover, that, though containing
a picture, unequalled for simplicity and dignity, of the earliest experiences of the present
family of man, they are by no means a monument or relic of the most remote period, but belong
to a comparatively modern date, and that the question of Time is not at all directly treated
in them.

We visit the region where poetry and myth and tradition have placed a most ancient civilization,--the
Black-Land, or Land of the Nile: we search its royal sepulchres, its manifold history written
in funereal records, in kingly genealogies, in inscriptions, and in the thousand relics preserved
of domestic life, whether in picture, sculpture, or the embalmed remains of the dead; and we
find ourselves thrown back to a date far beyond any received date of history, and still we
have before us a ripened civilization, an art which could not belong to the childhood of a
race, a language which (so far as we can judge) must have needed centuries for its development,
and the divisions of human races, whose formation from the original pair our philosophy teaches
us must have required immense and unknown spaces of time,--all as distinct as they are at the
present day.

We traverse the regions to which both the comparison of languages and the Biblical records
assign the original birthplace of mankind,--the country of the Euphrates and the plateau of
Eastern Asia. Buried kingdoms are revealed to us; the shadowy outlines of magnificent cities
appear which flourished and fell before recorded human history, and of which even Herodotus
never heard; Art and Science are unfolded, reaching far back into the past; the signs of luxury
and splendor are uncovered from the ruin of ages: but, remote as is the date of these Turanian
and Semitic empires, almost equalling that of the Flood in the ordinary system of chronology,
they cannot be near the origin of things, and a long process of development must have passed
ere they reached the maturity in which they are revealed to us.

The Chinese records give us an antiquity and an acknowledged date before the time of Abraham,
(if we follow the received chronology,) and even then their language must have been, as it
is now, distinct and solidified, betraying to the scholar no certain affinity to any other
family of language. The Indian history, so long boasted of for its immense antiquity, is without
doubt the most modern of the ancient records, and offers no certain date beyond 1800 B.C.

In Europe, the earliest evidences of man disclosed by our investigations are even more vague
and shadowy. Probably, without antedating in time these historical records of Asia, they reach
back to a more primitive and barbarous era. The earliest history of Europe is not studied from
inscription or manuscript or even monument; it is not, like the Asiatic, a conscious work of
a people leaving a memorial of itself to a future age. It is rather, like the geological history,
an unconscious, gradual deposit left by the remains of extinct and unknown races in the soil
of the fields or under the sediment of the waters. The earliest European barbarian, as he burned
his canoe from a log, or fabricated his necklace from a bone, or worked out his knife from
a flint, was in reality writing a history of his race for distant days. We can follow him now
in his wanderings through the rivers and lakes and on the edges of the forests; we open his
simple mounds of burial, and study his barbarian tools and ornaments; we discover that he knew
nothing of metals, and that bone and flint and amber and coal were his materials; we trace
out his remarkable defences and huts built on piles in the various lakes of Europe, where the
simple savage could escape the few gigantic "fossil" animals which even then survived, and
roved through the forests of Prussia and France, or the still more terrible human enemies who
were continually pouring into Germany, Denmark, and Switzerland from the Asiatic plains. We
find that the early savage of Switzerland and Sweden was not entirely ignorant of the care
of animals, and that he had fabricated some rude pottery. Of what race he was, or when he appeared
amid the forests of Northern Europe, no one can confidently say. Collecting the various indications
from the superstitions, language, and habits of this barbarian people, and comparing them with
like peculiarities of the most ancient races now existing in Europe, we can frame a very plausible
hypothesis that these early savages belonged to that great family of which the Finns and Laps,
and possibly the Basques, are scattered members. Their skulls, also, are analogous in form
to those of the Finnish race. This age the archaeologists have denominated the "Stone Age"
of European antiquity.

Following this is what has been called by them the "Bronze Age." Another, more powerful, and
more cultivated race or collection of peoples inundates Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland,
and other districts. They make war against and destroy the early barbarians; they burn their
water-huts, and force them to the mountains, or to the most northern portions of the continent.
This new race has a taste for objects of beauty. They work copper and bronze; they make use
of beautiful vases of earthenware and ornaments of the precious metals; but they have yet no
knowledge of iron or steel. Their dead are burned instead of being buried, as was done by the
preceding races. They are evidently more warlike and more advanced than the Finnish barbarians.
Of their race or family it is difficult to say anything trustworthy. Their skulls belong to
the "long-skulled" races, and would ally them to the Kelts. Antiquaries have called their remains
"Keltic remains."

Still another age in this ancient history is the "Iron Age," when the tribes of Europe used
iron weapons and implements, and had advanced from the nomadic condition to that of cultivators
of the ground, though still gaining most of their livelihood from fishing and hunting. This
period no doubt approached the period of historical annals, and the iron men may have been
the earliest Teutons of the North,--our own forefathers; but of their race or mixture of races
we have no certain evidence, and can only make approximate hypotheses,--the division of "ages"
by archaeologists, it should be remembered, being not in any way a fixed division of races,
but only indicating the probability of different races at those different early periods. What
was the date of these ages cannot at all be determined; the earlier are long before any recorded
European annals, but there is no reason to believe that they approach in antiquity the Asiatic
records and remains.

Such, until recently, were the historic and scientific evidences with regard to the antiquity
of man. His most venerable records, his most ancient dates of historic chronology were but
of yesterday, when compared with the age of existing species of plants and animals, or with
the opening of the present geologic era. Every new scientific investigation seemed, from its
negative evidence, to render more improbable the existence of the "fossil man." It is true
that in various parts of the world, during the past few years, human bones have been discovered
in connection with the bones of the fossil mammalia; but they were generally found in caves
or in lime-deposits, where they might have been dropped or swept in by currents of water, or
inserted in more modern periods, and yet covered with the same deposit as the more ancient
relics. Geologists have uniformly reasoned on the a priori improbability of these being fossil
bones, and have somewhat strained the evidence--as some distinguished savans[A] now believe--against
the theory of a great human antiquity.

[Footnote A: Pictet.]

And yet the "negative evidence" against the existence of the fossil man was open to many doubts.
The records of geology are notoriously imperfect. We probably read but a few leaves of a mighty
library of volumes. Moreover, the last ages preceding the present period were witnesses of
a series of changes and slowly acting agencies of destruction, from which man may have in general
escaped. We have reason to believe that during long periods of time the land was gradually
elevated and subject to oscillations, so that the courses of rivers and the beds of lakes were
disturbed, and even the bottom of the ocean was raised. The results were the inundation of
some countries, and the pouring of great currents of water over others, wearing down the hills
and depositing in the course of ages the regular layers of gravel, sand, and marl, which now
cover so large a part of Europe. This was still further followed by a period in which the temperature
of the earth was lowered, and ice and glaciers had perhaps a part in forming the present surface
of the northern hemisphere. During the first period, which may be called the "Quaternary Period,"[B]
the mighty animals lived whose bones are now found in caverns, or under the slowly deposited
sediment of the waters, or preserved in bog,--the mammoth, and rhinoceros, and elk, and bear,
and elephant, as well as many others of extinct species.

[Footnote B: We should bear in mind that the Quaternary or Diluvian Period, however ancient
in point of time, has no clearly distinguishing line of separation from the present period.
The great difference lies in the extinction of certain species of animals, which lived then,
whose destruction may be due both to gradual changes of climate and to man.--PICTET.]

We may suppose, that, if man did exist during these convulsions and inundations, his superior
intelligence would enable him to escape the fate of the animals that were submerged,--or that,
if his few burial-places were invaded by the waters, his remains are now completely covered
by marine deposits under the ocean. If, however, in his barbarian condition, he had fashioned
implements of any hard material, and especially if, as do the savages of the present family
of man, he had accidentally deposited them, or had buried them with the dead in mighty mounds,
the invading waters might well sweep them together from their place and deposit them almost
in mass, in situations where the eddies should leave their gravel and sand.[C]

[Footnote C: Sir C. Lyell, in his remarks before the British Association in 1859, said upon
the discovery alluded to here: "I am reminded of a large Indian mound which I saw in St. Simon's
Island in Georgia,--a mound ten acres in area, and having an average height of five feet, chiefly
composed of cast-away oyster-shells, throughout which arrow-heads, stone axes, and Indian pottery
were dispersed. If the neighboring river, the Altamalia, or the sea which is at hand, should
invade, sweep away, and stratify the contents of this mound, it might produce a very analogous
accumulation of human implements, unmixed, perhaps, with human bones."--Athenaeum, September
21, 1859.]

Such seems in reality to have been the case; though in regard to so important a fact in the
history of the world much caution must be exercised in accepting the evidence. We will state
briefly the proofs, as they now appear, of the existence of a race of human beings on this
earth in an immense antiquity.

A French gentleman, M. Boucher de Perthes, has for thirty-four years been devoting his time
and his fortune, with rare perseverance, to the investigation of certain antiquities in the
later geological deposits in the North of France. His first work, "Les Antiquités Celtiques
and Antédiluviennes," published in 1847, was received with much incredulity and opposition;
a second, under the same title, in 1857, met with a scarce better reception, and it was with
the greatest difficulty that he could induce even the savans of his own country to look at
the mass of evidence he had collected on this subject.

He made the extraordinary claim to have discovered a great quantity of rough implements of
flint, fashioned by art, in the undisturbed beds of clay, gravel, and sand, known as drift,
near Abbeville and Amiens. These beds vary in thickness from ten to twenty feet, and cover
the chalk hills in the vicinity; in portions of them, upon the hills, often in company with
the flints, are discovered numerous bones of the extinct mammalia, such as the mammoth, the
fossil rhinoceros, tiger, bear, hyena, stag, ox, horse, and others.

The flint implements are found in the lowest beds of gravel, just above the chalk, while above
them are sands with delicate fresh-water shells and beds of brick-earth,--all this, be it remembered,
on table-lands two hundred feet above the level of the sea, in a country whose level and face
have remained unaltered during any historical period with which we are acquainted. "It must
have required," says Sir Charles Lyell, "a long period for the wearing down of the chalk which
supplied the broken flints (stones) for the formation of so much gravel at various heights,
sometimes one hundred feet above the level of the Somme, for the deposition of fine sediment,
including entire shells, both terrestrial and aquatic, and also for the denudation which the
entire mass of stratified drift has undergone, portions having been swept away, so that what
remains of it often terminates abruptly in old river-cliffs, besides being covered by a newer
unstratified drift. To explain these changes, I should infer considerable oscillations in the
level of the land in that part of France, slow movements of upheaval and subsidence, deranging,
but not wholly displacing the course of ancient rivers."

The President of the British Association, in his opening speech at the meeting of 1860, affirms
the immense antiquity of these flint implements, and remarks:--"At Menchecourt, in the suburbs
of Abbeville, a nearly entire skeleton of the Siberian rhinoceros is said to have been taken
out about forty years ago,--a fact affording an answer to the question often raised, as to
whether the bones of the extinct mammalia could have been washed out of an older alluvium into
a newer one, and so redeposited and mingled with the relics of human workmanship. Far-fetched
as was this hypothesis, I am informed that it would not, if granted, have seriously shaken
the proof of the high antiquity of human productions; for that proof is independent of organic
evidence or fossil remains, and is based on physical data. As was stated to us last year by
Sir Charles Lyell, we should still have to allow time for great denudation of the chalk, and
the removal from place to place, and the spreading out over the length and breadth of a large
valley, of heaps of chalk-flints in beds from ten to fifteen feet in thickness, covered by
loam and sands of equal thickness, these last often tranquilly deposited,--all of which operations
would require the supposition of a great lapse of time."

An independent proof of the age of these gravel-beds and the associated loam, containing fossil
remains, is derived by the same authority from the large deposits of peat in the valley of
the Somme, which contain not only monuments of the Roman, but also those of an older, stone
period, the Finnic period; yet, says Lord Wrottesley, "distinguished geologists are of opinion
that the growth of all the vegetable matter, and even the original scooping out of the hollows
containing it, are events long posterior in date to the gravel with flint-implements,--nay,
posterior even to the formation of the uppermost of the layers of loam with fresh-water shells
overlaying the gravel."

The number of the flint implements is computed at above fourteen hundred in an area of fourteen
miles in length and half a mile in breadth. They are of the rudest nature, as if formed by
a people in the most degraded state of barbarism. Some are mere flakes of flint, apparently
used for knives or arrow-heads; some are pointed and with hollowed bases, as if for spear-heads,
varying from four to nine inches in length; some are almond-shaped, with a cutting edge, from
two to nine inches in length. Others again are fashioned into coarse representations of animals,
such as the whale, saurian, boar, eagle, fish, and even the human profile; others have representations
of foliage upon them; others are either drilled with holes or are cut with reference to natural
holes, so as to serve as stones for slings, or for amulets, or for ornaments. The edges in
many cases seem formed by a great number of small artificial tips or blows, and do not at all
resemble edges made by a great natural fracture. Very few are found with polished surfaces
like the modern remains in flint; and the whole workmanship differs from that of flint arrow-heads
in other parts of Europe, as well as from the later Finnish (or so-called Keltic) remains,
discovered in such quantities in France. The only relics that have been found resembling them
are, according to Mr. Worsaae, some flint arrow-heads and spear-points discovered at great
depths in the bogs of Denmark. A few bone knives and necklaces of bone have been met with in
these deposits, but thus far no human bones. The people who fabricated these instruments seemed
to be a hunting and fishing people, living in some such condition as the present savages of
Australia.

These discoveries of M. de Perthes have at length aroused the attention of English men of science,
and during 1859 a number of eminent gentlemen--among them Sir Charles Lyell, Mr. Prestwich,
Dr. Falconer, and others--visited M. Perthes's collection, and saw the flints in situ. Several
of them have avowed their conviction of the genuineness and antiquity of these relics. Sir
Charles Lyell has given a guarded sanction to the belief that they present one strong proof
of a remote human antiquity.

The objections that would naturally be made to this evidence are, that the flints are purely
natural formations, and not works of man,--that the deposit is alluvial and modern, rather
than of the ancient drift,--or that these implements had been dropped into crevices, or sunk
from above, in later periods.

The testimony of disinterested observers seems to be sufficient as to the human contrivance
manifest in these flints; and the concurrence of various scientific men hardly leaves room
for doubt that these deposits are of great antiquity, preceding the time in which the surface
of France took its present form, and dating back to what is called the Post-Pliocene Period.
Their horizontal position, and the great depth at which the hatchets are found, together with
their number, and the peculiar incrustation and discoloration of each one, as well as their
being in company with the bones of the extinct mammalia, make it improbable that they could
have been dropped into fissures or sunk there in modern times.[D] In regard to the absence
of human bones, it should be remembered that no bones are easily preserved, unless they are
buried in sediment or in bog; and furthermore, that the extent of the researches in these formations
is very small indeed. Besides, the country where above all we should expect the most of human
remains in the drift-deposits, as being probably the most ancient abode of man,--Asia,--has
been the least explored for such purposes. Still this is without doubt the weak point in the
evidence, as proving human antiquity.

[Footnote D: An article in Blackwood, (October, 1860,) which is understood to be from the pen
of Professor H.D. Rogers, admits entirely that the flints are of human workmanship, and that
it is impossible for them to have dropped through fissures, as, according to the writer's observation
of the deposits, it would be impossible even for a mole to penetrate them, so close are they.
Professor Rogers takes the ground that human antiquity is not proven from these relics, for
two reasons:--First, because the indications in the deposits inclosing the flints point clearly
to a "turbulent diluvial action," and therefore it is possible for a violent incursion of the
ocean to have taken place in the historic period, and to have mixed up the more recent works
of man with the previously buried bones or relics of a pre-historic period; and secondly, because
the different geological deposits do not necessarily prove time, but only succession,--two
schools of geology interpreting all similar phenomena differently, as relating to the time
required.

The last position would be admitted by few scientific geologists at the present day, as the
evidence for time, though inferential from the deposits known to us, is held generally to be
conclusive. On the first point, Professor Rogers has the weight of authority against him: all
the great masters of the science, who have examined the formation and the deposits of the surrounding
country, denying that there is any evidence of an incursion of the ocean of such a nature,
during the historic period.]

The chain of evidence in regard to this important question seems to be filled out by a recent
discovery of M. Edouard Lartet in Aurignac, in the South of France, on the head-waters of the
Garonne. As we have just observed, the weak point in M. de Perthes's discoveries was the absence
of human bones in the deposits investigated, though this might have been accounted for by the
withdrawal of human beings from the floods of the period. M. Lartet's investigations have fortunately
been conducted in a spot which was above the reach of the ordinary inundations of the Drift
Period, and whither human beings might have fled for refuge, or where they might have lived
securely during long spaces of time.

Some ten years since, in Aurignac, (Haute Garonne,) in the Arrondissement of St. Gaudens, near
the Pyrenees, a cavern was discovered in the nummulitic rock. It had been concealed by a heap
of fragments of rock and vegetable soil, gradually detached and accumulated, probably by atmospheric
agency. In it were found the human remains, it was estimated, of seventeen individuals, which
were afterwards buried formally by the order of the mayor of Aurignac. Along with the bones
were discovered the teeth of mammals, both carnivora and herbivora; also certain small perforated
corals, such as were used by many ancient peoples as beads, and similar to those gathered in
the deposits of Abbeville. The cave had apparently served as a place of sacrifice and of burial.
In 1860 M. Lartet visited the spot. In the layer of loose earth at the bottom of the cave he
found flint implements, worked portions of a reindeer's horn, mammal bones, and human bones
in a remarkable state of preservation. In a lower layer of charcoal and ashes, indicating the
presence of man and some ancient fireplace or hearth, the bones of the animals were scratched
and indented as though by implements employed to remove the flesh; almost every bone was broken,
as if to extract the marrow, as is done by many modern tribes of savages. The same peculiarity
is noticed in the bones discovered among the "water-huts" of the Danish lakes.

In this deposit M. Lartet picked up many human implements, such as bone knives, flattened circular
stones supposed to have been used for sharpening flint knives, perforated sling-stones, many
arrow-heads and spear-heads, flint knives, a bodkin made of a roebuck's horn, various implements
of reindeers' horn, and teeth beads, from the teeth of the great fossil bear (Ursus spelaeus).
Remains were also found of nine different species of carnivora, such as the fossil bear, the
hyena, cat, wolf, fox, and others, and of twelve of herbivora, such as the fossil elephant,
the rhinoceros, the great stag, (Cervus elephas,) the European bison, (aurochs,) horse, and
others. The most common were the aurochs, the reindeer, and the fox. How savages, armed only
with flint implements, could have captured these gigantic animals, is somewhat mysterious;
but, as M. Lartet suggests, they may have snared many of them, or have overwhelmed single monsters
with innumerable arrows and spears, as Livingstone describes the slaying of the elephant by
the negroes at the present day.

With reference to the mode in which these remains were brought to this place, M. Lartet remarks,--"The
fragmentary condition of the bones of certain animals, the mode in which they are broken, the
marks of the teeth of the hyena on bones, necessarily broken in their recent condition, even
the distribution of the bones and their significant consecration, lead to the conclusion that
the presence of these animals and the deposit of all these remains are due solely to human
agency. Neither the inclination of the ground nor the surrounding hydrographical conditions
allow us to suppose that the remains could have been brought where they are found by natural
causes."

The conclusion, then, in palaeontology, which would be drawn from these facts is, that man
must have existed in Europe at the same time with the fossil elephant and rhinoceros, the gigantic
hyena, the aurochs, and the elk, and even the cave-bear. This latter animal is thought by many
to have disappeared in the very opening of the Post-Pliocene Period; so that this cave would--judging
from the remains of that animal--have been prior to the long period of inundations in which
the drift-deposits of Abbeville and Amiens were made. The drift which fills the valleys of
the Pyrenees has not, it is evident, touched this elevated spot in Aurignac.

In chronology, all that is proved by these discoveries of M. Lartet is that the fossil animals
mentioned above and man were contemporaries on the earth. The age of each must be determined
inferentially by comparing the age of strata in which these animals are usually found with
the age in which the most ancient traces of man are discovered,--such as the deposits already
described in the North of France.

Similar discoveries on a smaller scale are recorded by Mr. Prestwich in Suffolk, England, and
in Devonshire. We are informed also by Sir C. Lyell of a recent important discovery near Troyes,
France. In the Grotto d'Arcès, a human jaw-bone and teeth have been found imbedded with Elephas
primigenius, Ursus spelaeus, Hyaena spelaea, and other extinct animals, under layers of stalagmite.
Professor Pictet, the celebrated geologist, who also gives his adhesion to these discoveries
of M. de Perthes, states that the cave-evidence has by no means been sufficiently valued by
geologists, and that there are caverns in Belgium where the existence of human remains cannot
be satisfactorily explained on the theory of a modern introduction of them. The President of
the British Association (Lord Wrottesley) also states that in the cave of Brixham, Devonshire,
and in another near Palermo, in Sicily, flint implements were observed by Dr. Falconer, in
such a manner as to lead him to infer that man must have coexisted with several lost species
of quadrupeds.

Professor Owen, in his "Palaeontology," (1861,) appears to put faith in the genuineness and
antiquity of these flint relics. He also states that similar flint weapons have been found
by Mr. John Frere, F.R.S., in Suffolk, in a bed of flint gravel, sixteen feet below the surface,
of the same geological age as that in the valley of the Somme.

The conclusion from these discoveries--the most important scientific discoveries, relating
to human history, of modern times--is, that ages ago, in the period of the extinct mammoth
and the fossil bear, perhaps before the Channel separated England from France, a race of barbarian
human beings lived on the soil of Europe, capable of fabricating rough implements. The evidence
has been carefully weighed by impartial and experienced men, and thus far it seems complete.

The mind is lost in astonishment, in looking back at such a vast antiquity of human beings.
A tribe of men in existence tens of thousands of years before any of the received dates of
Creation! savages who hunted, with their flint-headed arrows, the gigantic elk of Ireland and
the buffalo of Germany, or who fled from the savage tiger of France, or who trapped the immense
clumsy mammoth of Northern Europe. Who were they? we ask ourselves in wonder. Was there with
man, as with other forms of animal life, a long and gradual progression from the lowest condition
to a higher, till at length the world was made ready for a more developed human being, and
the Creator placed the first of the present family of man upon the earth? Were those European
barbarians of the Drift Period a primeval race, destroyed before the creation of our own race,
and lower and more barbarian than the lowest of the present inhabitants of the world? or, as
seems more probable, were these mysterious beings--the hunters of the mammoth and the aurochs--the
earliest progenitors of our own family, the childish fathers of the human race?

The subject hardly yet admits of an exact and scientific answer. We can merely here suggest
the probability of a vast antiquity to human beings, and of the existence of the FOSSIL or
PRE-ADAMITIC MAN.

KATAHDIN AND THE PENOBSCOT.

CHAPTER X.

RIPOGENUS.

Ripogenus is a tarn, a lovely oval tarn, within a rim of forest and hill; and there behold,
O gioja! at its eastern end, stooping forward and filling the sphere, was Katahdin, large and
alone.

But we must hasten, for day wanes, and we must see and sketch this cloudless summit from terra
firma. A mile and half-way down the lake, we landed at the foot of a grassy hill-side, where
once had been a lumberman's station and hay-farm. It was abandoned now, and lonely in that
deeper sense in which widowhood is lonelier than celibacy, a home deserted lonelier than a
desert. Tumble-down was the never-painted house; ditto its three barns. But, besides a camp,
there were two things to be had here,--one certain, one possible, probable even. The view,
that was an inevitable certainty; Iglesias would bag that as his share of the plunder of Ripogenus.
For my bagging, bears, perchance, awaited. The trappers had seen a bear near the barns. Cancut,
in his previous visit, had seen a disappearance of bear. No sooner had the birch's bow touched
lightly upon the shore than we seized our respective weapons,--Iglesias his peaceful and creative
sketch-book, I my warlike and destructive gun,--and dashed up the hill-side.

I made for the barns to catch Bruin napping or lolling in the old hay. I entertain a vendetta
toward the ursine family. I had a duello, pistol against claw, with one of them in the mountains
of Oregon, and have nothing to show to point the moral and adorn the tale. My antagonist of
that hand-to-hand fight received two shots, and then dodged into cover and was lost in the
twilight. Soon or late in my life, I hoped that I should avenge this evasion. Ripogenus would,
perhaps, give what the Nachchese Pass had taken away.

Vain hope! I was not to be an ursicide. I begin to fear that I shall slay no other than my
proper personal bearishness. I did my duty for another result at Ripogenus. I bolted audaciously
into every barn. I made incursions into the woods around. I found the mark of the beast, not
the beast. He had not long ago decamped, and was now, perhaps, sucking the meditative paw hard-by
in an arbor of his bear-garden.

After a vain hunt, I gave up Beast and turned to Beauty. I looked about me, seeing much.

Foremost I saw a fellow-man, my comrade, fondled by breeze and brightness, and whispered to
by all sweet sounds. I saw Iglesias below me, on the slope, sketching. He was preserving the
scene at its bel momento. I repented more bitterly of my momentary falseness to Beauty while
I saw him so constant.

Furthermore, I saw a landscape of vigorous simplicity, easy to comprehend. By mellow sunset
the grass slope of the old farm seemed no longer tanned and rusty, but ripened. The oval lake
was blue and calm, and that is already much to say; shadows of the western hills were growing
over it, but flight after flight of illumined cloud soared above, to console the sky and the
water for the coming of night. Northward, a forest darkled, whose glades of brightness I could
not see. Eastward, the bank mounted abruptly to a bare fire-swept table-land, whereon a few
dead trees stood, parched and ghostly skeletons draped with rags of moss.

Furthermost and topmost, I saw Katahdin twenty miles away, a giant undwarfed by any rival.
The remainder landscape was only minor and judiciously accessory. The hills were low before
it, the lake lowly, and upright above lake and hill lifted the mountain pyramid. Isolate greatness
tells. There were no underling mounts about this mountain-in-chief. And now on its shoulders
and crest sunset shone, glowing. Warm violet followed the glow, soothing away the harshness
of granite lines. Luminous violet dwelt upon the peak, while below the clinging forests were
purple in sheltered gorges, where they could climb nearer the summit, loved of light, and lower
down gloomed green and sombre in the shadow.

Meanwhile, as I looked, the quivering violet rose higher and higher, and at last floated away
like a disengaged flame. A smouldering blue dwelt upon the peak. Ashy-gray overcame the blue.
As dusk thickened and stars trembled into sight, the gray grew luminous. Katahdin's mighty
presence seemed to absorb such dreamy glimmers as float in limpid night-airs: a faint glory,
a twilight of its own, clothed it. King of the daylit-world, it became queen of the dimmer
realms of night, and like a woman-queen it did not disdain to stoop and study its loveliness
in the polished lake, and stooping thus it overhung the earth, a shadowy creature of gleam
and gloom, an eternized cloud.

I sat staring and straying in sweet reverie, until the scene before me was dim as metaphysics.
Suddenly a flame flashed up in the void. It grew and steadied, and dark objects became visible
about it. In the loneliness--for Iglesias had disappeared--I allowed myself a moment's luxury
of superstition. Were these the Cyclops of Katahdin? Possibly. Were they Trolls forging diabolic
enginery, or Gypsies of Yankeedom? I will see,--and went tumbling down the hill-side.

As I entered the circle about the cooking-fire of drift-wood by the lake, Iglesias said,--

"The beef-steak and the mutton-chops will do for breakfast; now, then, with your bear!"

"Haw, haw!" guffawed Cancut; and the sound, taking the lake at a stride, found echoes everywhere,
till he grew silent and peered suspiciously into the dark.

"There's more bears raound 'n yer kin shake a stick at," said one of the muskrateers. "I wouldn't
ricommend yer to stir 'em up naow, haowlin' like that."

"I meant it for laffin'," said Cancut, humbly.

"Ef yer call that 'ere larfin', couldn't yer cry a little to kind er slick daown the bears?"
said the trapper.

Iglesias now invited us to chocolat à la crème, made with the boon of the ex-bar-keeper. I
suppose I may say, without flattery, that this tipple was marvellous. What a pity Nature spoiled
a cook by making the muddler of that chocolate a painter of grandeurs! When Fine Art is in
a man's nature, it must exude, as pitch leaks from a pine-tree. Our muskrat-hunters partook
injudiciously of this unaccustomed dainty, and were visited with indescribable Nemesis. They
had never been acclimated to chocolate, as had Iglesias and I, by sipping it under the shade
of the mimosa and the palm.

Up to a certain point, an unlucky hunter is more likely to hunt than a lucky. Satiety follows
more speedily upon success than despair upon failure. Let us thank Heaven for that, brethren
dear! I had bagged not a bear, and must needs satisfy my assassin instincts upon something
with hoofs and horns. The younger trapper of muskrat, being young, was ardent,--being young,
was hopeful,--being young, believed in exceptions to general rules,--and being young, believed,
that, given a good fellow with a gun, Nature would provide a victim. Therefore he proposed
that we should canoe it along the shallows in this sweetest and stillest of all the nights.
The senior shook his head incredulously; Iglesias shook his head noddingly.

"Since you have massacred all the bears," said Iglesias, "I will go lay me down in their lair
in the barn. If you find me cheek-by-jowl with Ursa Major when you come back, make a pun and
he will go."

It was stiller than stillness upon the lake. Ripogenus, it seemed, had never listened to such
silence as this. Calm never could have been so beyond the notion of calm. Stars in the empyrean
and stars in Ripogenus winked at each other across ninety-nine billions of leagues as uninterruptedly
as boys at a boarding-school table.

I knelt amidships in the birch with gun and rifle on either side. The pilot gave one stroke
of his paddle, and we floated out upon what seemed the lake. Whatever we were poised and floating
upon he hesitated to shatter with another dip of his paddle, lest he should shatter the thin
basis and sink toward heaven and the stars.

Presently the silence seemed to demand gentle violence, and the unwavering water needed slight
tremors to teach it the tenderness of its calm; then my guide used his blade, and cut into
glassiness. We crept noiselessly along by the lake-edge, within the shadows of the pines. With
never a plash we slid. Rare drops fell from the cautious paddle and tinkled on the surface,
overshot, not parted by, our imponderable passage. Sometimes from far within the forest would
come sounds of rustling branches or crackling twigs. Somebody of life approaches with stealthy
tread. Gentlier, even gentlier, my steersman! Take up no pearly drop from the lake, mother
of pearliness, lest falling it sound too loudly. Somewhat comes. Let it come unterrified to
our ambush among the shadows by the shore.

Somewhat, something, somebody was coming, perhaps, but some other thing or body thwarted it
and it came not. To glide over glassiness while uneventful moments link themselves into hours
is monotonous. Night and stillness laid their soothing spell upon me. I was entranced. I lost
myself out of time and space, and seemed to be floating unimpelled and purposeless, nowhere
in Forever.

Somewhere in Now I suddenly found myself.

There he was! There was the moose trampling and snorting hard-by, in the shallows of Ripogenus,
trampling out of being the whole nadir of stars, making the world conscious of its lost silence
by the death of silence in tumult.

I trembled with sudden eagerness. I seized my gun. In another instant I should have lodged
the fatal pellet! when a voice whispered over my shoulder,--

"I kinder guess yer 've ben asleep an' dreamin', ha'n't yer?"

So I had.

Never a moose came down to cool his clumsy snout in the water and swallow reflections of stars.
Never a moose abandoned dry-browse in the bitter woods for succulent lily-pads, full in their
cells and veins of water and sunlight. Till long past midnight we paddled and watched and listened,
whisperless. In vain. At last, as we rounded a point, the level gleam of our dying camp-fire
athwart the water reminded us of passing hours and traveller duties, of rest to-night and toil
to-morrow.

My companions, fearless as if there were no bears this side of Ursa Major, were bivouacked
in one of the barns. There I entered skulkingly, as a gameless hunter may, and hid my untrophied
head beneath a mound of ancient hay, not without the mustiness of its age.

No one clawed us, no one chawed us, that night. A Ripogenus chill awaked the whole party with
early dawn. We sprang from our nests, shook the hay-seed out of our hair, and were full-dressed
without more ceremony, ready for whatever grand sensation Nature might purvey for our aesthetic
breakfast.

Nothing is ever as we expect. When we stepped into out-of-doors, looking for Ripogenus, a lake
of Maine, we found not a single aquatic fact in the landscape. Ripogenus, a lake, had mizzled,
(as the Americans say,) literally mizzled. Our simplified view comprised a grassy hill with
barns, and a stern positive pyramid, surely Katahdin; aloft, beyond, above, below, thither,
hither, and yon, Fog, not fog, but FOG.

Ripogenus, the water-body, had had aspirations, and a boon of brief transfiguration into a
cloud-body had been granted it by Nature, who grants to every terrestrial essence prophetic
experiences of what it one day would be.

In short, and to repeat, Ripogenus had transmuted itself into vapor, and filled the valley
full to our feet. A faint wind had power to billow this mist-lake, and drive cresting surges
up against the eastern hill-side, over which they sometimes broke, and, involving it totally,
rolled clear and free toward Katahdin, where he stood hiding the glows of sunrise. Leagues
higher up than the mountain rested a presence of cirri, already white and luminous with full
daylight, and from them drooped linking wreaths of orange mist, clinging to the rosy-violet
granite of the peak.

Up clomb and sailed Ripogenus and befogged the whole; then we condescended to breakfast.

CHAPTER XI.

TOWARD KATAHDIN.

Singularly enough, mill-dams are always found below mill-ponds. Analogously in the Maine rivers,
below the lakes, rapids are. Rapids too often compel carries. While we breakfasted without
steak of bear or cutlet of moose, Ripogenus gradually retracted itself, and became conscious
again of what poetry there is in a lake's pause and a rapid's flow. Fog condensed into water,
and water submitting to its destiny went cascading down through a wild defile where no birch
could follow.

The Ripogenus carry is three miles long, a faint path through thickets.

"First half," said Cancut, "'s plain enough; but after that 't would take a philosopher with
his spectacles on to find it."

This was discouraging. Philosophers twain we might deem ourselves; but what is a craftsman
without tools? And never a goggle had we.

But the trappers of muskrats had become our fast friends. They insisted upon lightening our
loads over the brambly league. This was kindly. Cancut's elongated head-piece, the birch, was
his share of the burden; and a bag of bread, a firkin of various grub, damp blankets for three,
and multitudinous traps, seemed more than two could carry at one trip over this longest and
roughest of portages.

We paddled from the camp to the lake-foot, and there, while the others compacted the portables
for portage, Iglesias and I, at cost of a ducking with mist-drops from the thickets, scrambled
up a crag for a supreme view of the fair lake and the clear mountain. And we did well. Katahdin,
from the hill guarding the exit of the Penobscot from Ripogenus, is eminent and emphatic, a
signal and solitary pyramid, grander than any below the realms of the unchangeable, more distinctly
mountainous than any mountain of those that stop short of the venerable honors of eternal snow.

We trod the trail, we others, easier than Cancut. He found it hard to thread the mazes of an
overgrown path and navigate his canoe at the same time. "Better," thought he, as he staggered
and plunged and bumped along, extricating his boat-bonnet now from a bower of raspberry-bushes,
now from the branches of a brotherly birch-tree,--"better," thought he, "were I seated in what
I bear, and bounding gayly over the billow. Peril is better than pother."

Bushwhacking thus for a league, we circumvented the peril, and came upon the river flowing
fair and free. The trappers said adieu, and launched us. Back then they went to consult their
traps and flay their fragrant captives, and we shot forward.

That was a day all poetry and all music. Mountain airs bent and blunted the noonday sunbeams.
There was shade of delicate birches on either hand, whenever we loved to linger. Our feather-shallop
went dancing on, fleet as the current, and whenever a passion for speed came after moments
of luxurious sloth, we could change floating at the river's will into leaps and chasing, with
a few strokes of the paddle. All was untouched, unvisited wilderness, and we from bend to bend
the first discoverers. So we might fancy ourselves; for civilization had been here only to
cut pines, not to plant houses. Yet these fair curves, and liberal reaches, and bright rapids
of the birchen-bowered river were only solitary, not lonely. It is never lonely with Nature.
Without unnatural men or unnatural beasts, she is capital society by herself. And so we found
her,--a lovely being in perfect toilet, which I describe, in an indiscriminating, masculine
way, by saying that it was a forest and a river and lakes and a mountain and doubtless sky,
all made resplendent by her judicious disposition of a most becoming light. Iglesias and I,
being old friends, were received into close intimacy. She smiled upon us unaffectedly, and
had a thousand exquisite things to say, drawing us out also, with feminine tact, to say our
best things, and teaching us to be conscious, in her presence, of more delicate possibilities
of refinement and a tenderer poetic sense. So we voyaged through the sunny hours, and were happy.

Yet there was no monotony in our progress. We could not always drift and glide. Sometimes we
must fight our way. Below the placid reaches were the inevitable "rips" and rapids: some we
could shoot without hitting anything; some would hit us heavily, did we try to shoot. Whenever
the rocks in the current were only as thick as the plums in a boarding-school pudding, we could
venture to run the gantlet; whenever they multiplied to a school-boy's ideal, we were arrested.
Just at the brink of peril we would sweep in by an eddy into a shady pool by the shore. At
such spots we found a path across the carry. Cancut at once proceeded to bonnet himself with
the trickling birch. Iglesias and I took up the packs and hurried on with minds intent on berries.
Berries we always found,--blueberries covered with a cloudy bloom, blueberries pulpy, saccharine,
plenteous.

Often, when a portage was not quite necessary, a dangerous bit of white water would require
the birch to be lightened. Cancut must steer her alone over the foam, while we, springing ashore,
raced through the thick of the forest, tore through the briers, and plunged through the punk
of trees older than history, now rotting where they fell, slain by Time the Giganticide. Cancut
then had us at advantage. Sometimes we had laughed at him, when he, a good-humored malaprop,
made vague clutches at the thread of discourse. Now suppose he should take a fancy to drop
down stream and leave us. What then? Berries then, and little else, unless we had a chance
at a trout or a partridge. It is not cheery, but dreary, to be left in pathlessness, blanketless,
guideless, and with breadths of lake and mountain and Nature, shaggy and bearish, between man
and man. With the consciousness of a latent shudder in our hearts at such a possibility, we
parted brier and bramble until the rapid was passed, we scuffled hastily through to the river-bank,
and there always, in some quiet nook, was a beacon of red-flannel shirt among the green leaves
over the blue and shadowy water, and always the fast-sailing Cancut awaiting us, making the
woods resound to amicable hails, and ready again to be joked and to retaliate.

Such alternations made our voyage a charming olla. We had the placid glide, the fleet dash,
the wild career, the pause, the landing, the agreeable interlude of a portage, and the unburdened
stampede along-shore. Thus we won our way, or our way wooed us on, until, in early afternoon,
a lovely lakelet opened before us. The fringed shores retired, and, as we shot forth upon wider
calm, lo, Katahdin! unlooked-for, at last, as a revolution. Our boat ruffled its shadow, doing
pretty violence to its dignity, that we might know the greater grandeur of the substance. There
was a gentle agency of atmosphere softening the bold forms of this startling neighbor, and
giving it distance, lest we might fear it would topple and crush us. Clouds, level below, hid
the summit and towered aloft. Among them we might imagine the mountain rising with thousands
more of feet of heaven-piercing height: there is one degree of sublimity in mystery, as there
is another degree in certitude.

We lay to in a shady nook, just off Katahdin's reflection in the river, while Iglesias sketched
him. Meanwhile I, analyzing my view, presently discovered a droll image in the track of a land-avalanche
down the front. It was a comical fellow, a little giant, a colossal dwarf, six hundred feet
high, and should have been thrice as tall, had it had any proper development,--for out of his
head grew two misdirected skeleton legs, "hanging down and dangling." The countenance was long,
elfin, sneering, solemn, as of a truculent demon, saddish for his trade, an ashamed, but unrepentant
rascal. He had two immense erect ears, and in his boisterous position had suffered a loss of
hair, wearing nothing save an impudent scalp-lock. A very grotesque personage. Was he the guardian
imp, the legendary Eft of Katahdin, scoffing already at us as verdant, and warning that he
would make us unhappy, if we essayed to appear in demon realms and on Brocken heights without
initiation?

"A terrible pooty mountain," Cancut observed; and so it is.

Not to fail in topographical duty, I record, that near this lakelet flows in the river Sowadehunk,
and not far below, a sister streamlet, hardly less melodiously named Ayboljockameegus. Opposite
the latter we landed and encamped, with Katahdin full in front, and broadly visible.

CHAPTER XII.

CAMP KATAHDIN.

Our camping-place was worthy of its view. On the bank, high and dry, a noble yellow birch had
been strong enough to thrust back the forest, making a glade for its own private abode. Other
travellers had already been received in this natural pavilion. We had had predecessors, and
they had built them a hut, a half roof of hemlock bark, resting on a frame. Time had developed
the wrinkles in this covering into cracks, and cracks only wait to be leaks. First, then, we
must mend our mansion. Material was at hand; hemlocks, with a back-load of bark, stood ready
to be disburdened. In August they have worn their garment so long that they yield it unwillingly.
Cancut's axe, however, was insinuating, not to say peremptory. He peeled off and brought great
scales of rough purple roofing, and we disposed them, according to the laws of forest architecture,
upon our cabin. It became a good example of the renaissance. Storm, if such a traveller were
approaching, was shut out at top and sides; our blankets could become curtains in front and
completely hide us from that unwelcome vagrant, should he peer about seeking whom he might
duck and what he might damage.

Our lodge, built, must be furnished. We need a luxurious carpet, couch, and bed; and if we
have these, will be content without secondary articles. Here, too, material was ready, and
only the artist wanting, to use it. While Cancut peeled the hemlocks, Iglesias and I stripped
off armfuls of boughs and twigs from the spruces to "bough down" our camp. "Boughing down"
is shingling the floor elaborately with evergreen foliage; and when it is done well, the result
counts among the high luxuries of the globe. As the feathers of this bed are harsh stems covered
with leafage, the process of bed-making must be systematic, the stems thoroughly covered, and
the surface smooth and elastic. I have slept on the various beds of the world,--in a hammock,
in a pew, on German feathers, on a bear-skin, on a mat, on a hide; all, all give but a feeble,
restless, unrecreating slumber, compared to the spruce or hemlock bed in a forest of Maine.
This is fragrant, springy, soft, well-fitting, better than any Sybarite's coach of uncrumpled
rose-leaves. It sweetly rustles when you roll, and, by a gentle titillation with the little
javelin-leaves, keeps up a pleasant electricity over the cuticle. Rheumatism never, after nights
on such a bed; agues never; vigor, ardor, fervor, always.

We despatched our camp-building and bed-making with speed, for we had a purpose. The Penobscot
was a very beautiful river, and the Ayboljockameegus a very pretty stream; and if there is
one place in the world where trout, at certain seasons, are likely to be found, it is in a
beautiful river at the mouth of a pretty stream. Now we wanted trout; it was in the programme
that something more delicate than salt-pork should grace our banquets before Katahdin. Cancut
sustained our a priori, that trout were waiting for us over by the Aybol. By this time the
tree-shadows, so stiff at noon, began to relax and drift down stream, cooling the surface.
The trout could leave their shy lairs down in the chilly deeps, and come up without fear of
being parboiled. Besides, as evening came, trout thought of their supper, as we did of ours.

Hereupon I had a new sensation. We made ready our flies and our rods, and embarked, as I supposed,
to be ferried across and fish from terra firma. But no. Cancut dropped anchor very quietly
opposite the Aybol's mouth. Iglesias, the man of Maine experience, seemed nought surprised.
We were to throw our lines, as it appeared, from the birch; we were to peril our lives on the
unsteady basis of a roly-poly vessel,--to keep our places and ballast our bowl, during the
excitement of hooking pounds. Self-poise is an acrobatic feat, when a person, not loaded at
the heels, undertakes trout-fishing from a birch.

We threw our flies. Instantly at the lucky hackle something darted, seized it, and whirled
to fly, with the unwholesome bit in its mouth, up the peaceful Ayboljockameegus. But the lucky
man, and he happened to be the novice, forgot, while giving the capturing jerk of his hook,
that his fulcrum was not solid rock. The slight shell tilted, turned--over not quite, over
enough to give everybody a start. One lesson teaches the docile. Caution thereafter presided
over our fishing. She told us to sit low, keep cool, cast gently, strike firmly, play lightly,
and pull in steadily. So we did. As the spotted sparklers were rapidly translated from water
to a lighter element, a well-fed cheerfulness developed in our trio. We could not speak, for
fear of breaking the spell; we smiled at each other. Twenty-three times the smile went round.
Twenty-three trout, and not a pigmy among them, lay at our feet. More fish for one dinner and
breakfast would be waste and wanton self-indulgence. We stopped. And I must avow, not to claim
too much heroism, that the fish had also stopped. So we paddled home contented.

Then, O Walton! O Davy! O Scrope! ye fishers hard by taverns! luxury was ours of which ye know
no more than a Chinaman does of music. Under the noble yellow birch we cooked our own fish.
We used our scanty kitchen-battery with skill. We cooked with the high art of simplicity. Where
Nature has done her best, only fools rush in to improve: on the salmonids, fresh and salt,
she has lavished her creative refinements; cookery should only ripen and develop. From our
silver gleaming pile of pounders, we chose the larger and the smaller for appropriate experiments.
Then we tested our experiments; we tasted our examples. Success. And success in science proves
knowledge and skill. We feasted. The delicacy of our food made each feaster a finer essence.

So we supped, reclined upon our couch of spruce-twigs. In our good cheer we pitied the Eft
of Katahdin: he might sneer, but he was supperless. We were grateful to Nature for the grand
mountain, for the fair and sylvan woods, for the lovely river and what it had yielded us.

By the time we had finished our flaky fare and sipped our chocolate from the Magdalena, Night
announced herself,--Night, a jealous, dark lady, eclipsed and made invisible all her rivals,
that she might solely possess us. Night's whispers lulled us. The rippling river, the rustling
leaves, the hum of insects grew more audible; and these are gentle sounds that prove wide quietude
in Nature, and tell man that the burr and buzz in his day-laboring brain have ceased, and he
had better be breathing deep in harmony. So we disposed ourselves upon the fragrant couch of
spruce-boughs, and sank slowly and deeper into sleep, as divers sink into the thick waters
down below, into the dreamy waters far below the plunge of sunshine.

By-and-by, as the time came for rising to the surface again, and the mind began to be half
conscious of facts without it, as the diver may half perceive light through thinning strata
of sea, there penetrated through my last layers of slumber a pungent odor of wetted embers.
It was raining quietly. Drip was the pervading sound, as if the rain-drops were counting aloud
the leaves of the forest. Evidently a resolute and permanent wetting impended. On rainy days
one does not climb Katahdin. Instead of rising by starlight, breakfasting by gray, and starting
by rosy dawn, it would be policy to persuade night to linger long into the hours of a dull
day. When daylight finally came, dim and sulky, there was no rivalry among us which should
light the fire. We did not leap, but trickled slowly forth into the inhospitable morning, all
forlorn. Wet days in camp try "grit." "Clear grit" brightens more crystalline, the more it
is rained upon; sham grit dissolves into mud and water.

Yankees, who take in pulverized granite with every breath of their native dust, are not likely
to melt in a drizzle. We three certainly did not. We reacted stoutly against the forlorn weather,
unpacking our internal stores of sunshine, as a camel in a desert draws water from his inner
tank when outer water fails. We made the best of it. A breakfast of trout and trimmings looks
nearly as well and tastes nearly as well in a fog as in a glare: that we proved by experience
at Camp Katahdin.

We could not climb the mountain dark and dim; we would not be idle: what was to be done? Much.
Much for sport and for use. We shouldered the axe and sallied into the dripping forest. Only
a faint smoke from the smouldering logs curled up among the branches of the yellow birch over
camp. We wanted a big smoke, and chopped at the woods for fuel. Speaking for myself, I should
say that our wood-work was ill done. Iglesias smiled at my axe-handling, and Cancut at his,
as chopping we sent chips far and wide.

The busy, keen, short strokes of the axe resounded through the forest. When these had done
their work, and the bungler paused amid his wasteful debris to watch his toil's result, first
was heard a rustle of leaves, as if a passing whirlwind had alighted there; next came the crack
of bursting sinews; then the groan of a great riving spasm, and the tree, decapitated at its
foot, crashed to earth, with a vain attempt to clutch for support at the stiff, unpitying arms
of its woodland brotherhood.

Down was the tree,--fallen, but so it should not lie. This tree we proposed to promote from
brute matter, mere lumber, downcast and dejected, into finer essence: fuel was to be made into
fire.

First, however, the fuel must be put into portable shape. We top-sawyers went at our prostrate
and vanquished non-resistant, and without mercy mangled and dismembered him, until he was merely
a bare trunk, a torso incapable of restoration.

While we were thus busy, useful, and happy, the dripping rain, like a clepsydra, told off the
morning moments. The dinner-hour drew nigh. We had determined on a feast, and trout were to
be its daintiest dainty. But before we cooked our trout, we must, according to sage Kitchener's
advice, catch our trout. They were, we felt confident, awaiting us in the refrigerate larder
at hand. We waited until the confusing pepper of a shower had passed away and left the water
calm. Then softly and deftly we propelled our bark across to the Ayboljockameegus. We tossed
to the fish humbugs of wool, silk, and feathers, gauds such as captivate the greedy or the
guileless. Again the "gobemouches" trout, the fellows on the look-out for novelty, dashed up
and swallowed disappointing juiceless morsels, and with them swallowed hooks.

We caught an apostolic boat-load of beauties fresh and blooming as Aurora, silver as the morning
star, gemmy with eye-spots as a tiger-lily.

O feast most festal! Iglesias, of course, was the great artist who devised and mainly executed
it. As well as he could, he covered his pot and pan from the rain, admitting only enough to
season each dish with gravy direct from the skies. As day had ripened, the banquet grew ripe.
Then as day declined, we reclined on our triclinium of hemlock and spruce boughs, and made
high festival, toasting each other in the uninebriating flow of our beverages. Jollity reigned.
Cancut fattened, and visibly broadened. Toward the veriest end of the banquet, we seemed to
feel that there had been a slight sameness in its courses. The Bill of Fare, however, proved
the freest variety. And at the close we sat and sipped our chocolate with uttermost content.
No garçon, cringing, but firm, would here intrude with the unhandsome bill. Nothing to pay
is the rarest of pleasures. This dinner we had caught ourselves, we had cooked ourselves, and
had eaten for the benefit of ourselves and no other. There was nothing to repent of afterwards
in the way of extravagance, and certainly nothing of indigestion. Indigestion in the forest
primeval, in the shadow of Katahdin, is impossible.

While we dined, we talked of our to-morrow's climb of Katahdin. We were hopeful. We disbelieved
in obstacles. To-morrow would be fine. We would spring early from our elastic bed and stride
topwards. Iglesias nerved himself and me with a history of his ascent some years before, up
the eastern side of the mountain. He had left the house of Mr. Hunt, the outsider at that time
of Eastern Maine, with a squad of lumbermen, and with them tramped up the furrow of a land-avalanche
to the top, spending wet and ineffective days in the dripping woods, and vowing then to return
and study the mountain from our present camping-spot. I recalled also the first recorded ascent
of the Natardin or Catardin Mountain by Mr. Turner in 1804, printed in the Massachusetts Historical
Society's Collections, and identified the stream up whose valley he climbed with the Ayboljockameegus.
Cancut offered valuable contributions to our knowledge from his recent ascent with our Boston
predecessors. To-morrow we would verify our recollections and our fancies.

And so good-night, and to our spruce bed.

CHAPTER XIII.

UP KATAHDIN.

Next morning, when we awoke, just before the gray of dawn, the sky was clear and scintillating;
but there was a white cotton night-cap on the head of Katahdin. As we inspected him, he drew
his night-cap down farther, hinting that he did not wish to see the sun that day. When a mountain
is thus in the sulks after a storm, it is as well not to disturb him: he will not offer the
prize of a view. Experience taught us this: but then experience is only an empiric at the best.

Besides, whether Katahdin were bare-headed or cloud-capped, it would be better to blunder upward
than lounge all day in camp and eat Sybaritic dinners. We longed for the nervy climb. We must
have it. "Up!" said tingling blood to brain. "Dash through the forest! Grasp the crag, and
leap the cleft! Sweet flash forth the streamlets from granite fissures. To breathe the winds
that smite the peaks is life."

As soon as dawn bloomed in the woods we breakfasted, and ferried the river before sunrise.
The ascent subdivides itself into five zones. 1. A scantily wooded acclivity, where bears abound.
2. A dense, swampy forest region. 3. Steep, mossy mountain-side, heavily wooded. 4. A belt
of dwarf spruces, nearly impenetrable. 5. Ragged rock.

Cancut was our leader to-day. There are by far too many blueberries in the first zone. No one,
of course, intends to dally, but the purple beauties tempted, and too often we were seduced.
Still such yielding spurred us on to hastier speed, when we looked up after delay and saw the
self-denying far ahead.

To write an epic or climb a mountain is merely a dogged thing; the result is more interesting
to most than the process. Mountains, being cloud-compellers, are rain-shedders, and the shed
water will not always flow with decorous gayety in dell or glen. Sometimes it stays bewildered
in a bog, and here the climber must plunge. In the moist places great trees grow, die, fall,
rot, and barricade the way with their corpses. Katahdin has to endure all the ills of mountain
being, and we had all the usual difficulties to fight through doggedly. When we were clumsy,
we tumbled and rose up torn. Still we plodded on, following a path blazed by the Bostonians,
Cancut's late charge, and we grumblingly thanked them.

Going up, we got higher and drier. The mountain-side became steeper than it could stay, and
several land-avalanches, ancient or modern, crossed our path. It would be sad to think that
all the eternal hills were crumbling thus, outwardly, unless we knew that they bubble up inwardly
as fast. Posterity is thus cared for in regard to the picturesque. Cascading streams also shot
by us, carrying light and music. From them we stole refreshment, and did not find the waters
mineral and astringent, as Mr. Turner, the first climber, calumniously asserts.

The trees were still large and surprisingly parallel to the mountain wall. Deep soft moss covered
whatever was beneath, and sometimes this would yield and let the foot measure a crevice. Perilous
pitfalls; but we clambered unharmed. The moss, so rich, deep, soft, and earthily fragrant,
was a springy stair-carpet of a steep stairway. And sometimes when the carpet slipped and the
state of heels over head seemed imminent, we held to the baluster-trees, as one after wassail
clings to the lamp-post.

Even on this minor mountain the law of diminishing vegetation can be studied. The great trees
abandoned us, and stayed indolently down in shelter. Next the little wiry trees ceased to be
the comrades of our climb. They were no longer to be seen planted upon jutting crags, and,
bold as standard-bearers, inciting us to mount higher. Big spruces, knobby with balls of gum,
dwindled away into little ugly dwarf spruces, hostile, as dwarfs are said to be always, to
human comfort. They grew man-high, and hedged themselves together into a dense thicket. We
could not go under, nor over, nor through. To traverse them at all, we must recall the period
when we were squirrels or cats, in some former state of being.

Somehow we pierced, as man does ever, whether he owes it to the beast or the man in him. From
time to time, when in this struggle we came to an open point of rock, we would remember that
we were on high, and turn to assure ourselves that nether earth was where we had left it. We
always found it in situ, in belts green, white, and blue, a tricolor of woods, water, and sky.
Lakes were there without number, forest without limit. We could not analyze yet, for there
was work to do. Also, whenever we paused, there was the old temptation, blueberries. Every
out-cropping ledge offered store of tonic, ozone-fed blueberries, or of mountain-cranberries,
crimson and of concentrated flavor, or of the white snowberry, most delicate of fruits that grow.

As we were creeping over the top of the dwarf wood, Cancut, who was in advance, suddenly disappeared;
he seemed to fall through a gap in the spruces, and we heard his voice calling in cavernous
tones. We crawled forward and looked over. It was the upper camp of the Bostonians. They had
profited by a hole in the rocks, and chopped away the stunted scrubs to enlarge it into a snug
artificial abyss. It was snug, and so to the eye is a cell at Sing-Sing. If they were very
misshapen Bostonians, they may have succeeded in lying there comfortably. I looked down ten
feet into the rough chasm, and I saw, Corpo di Bacco! I saw a cork.

To this station our predecessors had come in an easy day's walk from the river; here they had
tossed through a night, and given a whole day to finish the ascent, returning hither again
for a second night. As we purposed to put all this travel within one day, we could not stay
and sympathize with the late tenants. A little more squirrel-like skipping and cat-like creeping
over the spruces, and we were out among bulky boulders and rough débris on a shoulder of the
mountain. Alas! the higher, the more hopeless. Katahdin, as he had taken pains to inform us,
meant to wear the veil all day. He was drawing down the white drapery about his throat and
letting it fall over his shoulders. Sun and wind struggled mightily with his sulky fit; sunshine
rifted off bits of the veil, and wind seized, whirled them away, and, dragging them over the
spruces below, tore them to rags. Evidently, if we wished to see the world, we must stop here
and survey, before the growing vapor covered all. We climbed to the edge of Cloudland, and
stood fronting the semicircle of southward view.

Katahdin's self is finer than what Katahdin sees. Katahdin is distinct, and its view is indistinct.
It is a vague panorama, a mappy, unmethodic maze of water and woods, very roomy, very vast,
very simple,--and these are capital qualities, but also quite monotonous. A lover of largeness
and scope has the proper emotions stirred, but a lover of variety very soon finds himself counting
the lakes. It is a wide view, and it is a proud thing for a man six feet or less high, to feel
that he himself, standing on something he himself has climbed, and having Katahdin under his
feet a mere convenience, can see all Maine. It does not make Maine less, but the spectator
more, and that is a useful moral result. Maine's face, thus exposed, has almost no features:
there are no great mountains visible, none that seem more than green hillocks in the distance.
Besides sky, Katahdin's view contains only the two primal necessities of wood and water. Nowhere
have I seen such breadth of solemn forest, gloomy, were it not for the cheerful interruption
of many fair lakes, and bright ways of river linking them.

Far away on the southern horizon we detected the heights of Mount Desert, our old familiar
haunt. All the northern semicircle was lost to us by the fog. We lost also the view of the
mountain itself. All the bleak, lonely, barren, ancient waste of the bare summit was shrouded
in cold fog. The impressive gray ruin and Titanic havoc of a granite mountain top, the heaped
boulders, the crumbling crags, the crater-like depression, the long stern reaches of sierra,
the dark curving slopes channelled and polished by the storms and fine drifting mists of aeons,
the downright plunge of precipices, all the savageness of harsh rock, unsoftened by other vegetation
than rusty moss and the dull green splashes of lichen, all this was hidden, except when the
mist, white and delicate where we stood, but thick and black above, opened whimsically and
delusively, as mountain mists will do, and gave us vistas into the upper desolation. After
such momentary rifts the mist thickened again, and swooped forward as if to involve our station,
but noon sunshine, reverberated from the plains and valleys and lakes below, was our ally;
sunshine checked the overcoming mist, and it stayed overhead, an unwelcome parasol, making
our August a chilly November. Besides what our eyes lost, our minds lost, unless they had imagination
enough to create it, the sentiment of triumph and valiant energy that the man of body and soul
feels upon the windy heights, the highest, whence he looks far and wide, like a master of realms,
and knows that the world is his; and they lost the sentiment of solemn joy that the man of
soul recognizes as one of the surest intimations of immortality, stirring within him, whenever
he is in the unearthly regions, the higher world.

We stayed studying the pleasant solitude and dreamy breadth of Katahdin's panorama for a long
time, and every moment the mystery of the mist above grew more enticing. Pride also was awakened.
We turned from sunshine and Cosmos into fog and Chaos. We made ourselves quite miserable for
nought. We clambered up into Nowhere, into a great, white, ghostly void. We saw nothing but
the rough surfaces we trod. We pressed along crater-like edges, and all below was filled with
mist, troubled and rushing upward like the smoke of a volcano. Up we went,--nothing but granite
and gray dimness. Where we arrived we know not. It was a top, certainly: that was proved by
the fact that there was nothing within sight. We cannot claim that it was the topmost top;
Kimchinjinga might have towered within pistol-shot; popgun-shot was our extremest range of
vision, except for one instant, when a kind-hearted sunbeam gave us a vanishing glimpse of
a white lake and breadth of forest far in the unknown North toward Canada.

When we had thus reached the height of our folly and made nothing by it, we addressed ourselves
to the descent, no wiser for our pains. Descent is always harder than ascent, for divine ambitions
are stronger and more prevalent than degrading passions. And when Katahdin is befogged, descent
is much more perilous than ascent. We edged along very cautiously by remembered landmarks the
way we had come, and so, after a dreary march of a mile or so through desolation, issued into
welcome sunshine and warmth at our point of departure. When I said "we," I did not include
the grave-stone peddler. He, like a sensible fellow, had determined to stay and eat berries
rather than breathe fog. While we wasted our time, he had made the most of his. He had cleared
Katahdin's shoulders of fruit, and now, cuddled in a sunny cleft, slept the sleep of the well-fed.
His red shirt was a cheerful beacon on our weary way. We took in the landscape with one slow,
comprehensive look, and, waking Cancut suddenly, (who sprang to his feet amazed, and cried
"Fire!") we dashed down the mountain-side.

It was long after noon; we were some dozen of miles from camp; we must speed. No glissade was
possible, nor plunge such as travellers make down through the ash-heaps of Vesuvius; but, having
once worried through the wretched little spruces, mean counterfeits of trees, we could fling
ourselves down from mossy step to step, measuring off the distance by successive leaps of a
second each, and alighting, sound after each, on moss yielding as a cushion.

On we hastened, retracing our footsteps of the morning across the avalanches of crumbled granite,
through the bogs, along the brooks; undelayed by the beauty of sunny glade or shady dell, never
stopping to botanize or to classify, we traversed zone after zone, and safely ran the gantlet
of the possible bears on the last level. We found lowland Nature still the same; Ayboljockameegus
was flowing still; so was Penobscot; no pirate had made way with the birch; we embarked and
paddled to camp.

The first thing, when we touched terra firma, was to look back regretfully toward the mountain.
Regret changed to wrath, when we perceived its summit all clear and mistless, smiling warmly
to the low summer's sun. The rascal evidently had only waited until we were out of sight in
the woods to throw away his night-cap.

One long rainy day had somewhat disgusted us with the old hemlock-covered camp in the glade
of the yellow birch, and we were reasonably and not unreasonably morbid after our disappointment
with Katahdin. We resolved to decamp. In the last hour of sunlight, floating pleasantly from
lovely reach to reach, and view to view, we could choose a spot of bivouac where no home-scenery
would recall any sorry fact of the past. We loved this gentle gliding by the tender light of
evening over the shadowy river, marking the rhythm of our musical progress by touches of the
paddle. We determined, too, that the balance of bodily forces should be preserved: legs had
been well stretched over the bogs and boulders; now for the arms. Never did our sylvan sojourn
look so fair as when we quitted it, and seemed to see among the streaming sunbeams in the shadows
the Hamadryads of the spot returned, and waving us adieux. We forgot how damp and leaks and
puddles had forced themselves upon our intimacy there; we remembered that we were gay, though
wet, and there had known the perfection of Ayboljockameegus trout.

As we drifted along the winding river, between the shimmering birches on either bank, Katahdin
watched us well. Sometimes he would show the point of his violet gray peak over the woods,
and sometimes, at a broad bend of the water, he revealed himself fully--and threw his great
image down beside for our nearer view. We began to forgive him, to disbelieve in any personal
spite of his, and to recall that he himself, seen thus, was far more precious than any mappy
dulness we could have seen from his summit. One great upright pyramid like this was worth a
continent of grovelling acres.

Sunset came, and with it we landed at a point below a lake-like stretch of the river, where
the charms of a neighbor and a distant view of the mountain combined. Cancut the Unwearied
roofed with boughs an old frame for drying moose-hides, while Iglesias sketched, and I worshipped
Katahdin. Has my reader heard enough of it,--a hillock only six thousand feet high? We are
soon to drift away, and owe it here as kindly a farewell as it gave us in that radiant twilight
by the river.

From our point of view we raked the long stern front tending westward. Just before sunset,
from beneath a belt of clouds evanescing over the summit, an inconceivably tender, brilliant
glow of rosy violet mantled downward, filling all the valley. Then the violet purpled richer
and richer, and darkened slowly to solemn blue, that blended with the gloom of the pines and
shadowy channelled gorges down the steep. The peak was still in sunlight, and suddenly, half
way down, a band of roseate clouds, twining and changing like a choir of Bacchantes, soared
around the western edge and hung poised above the unillumined forests at the mountain-base;
light as air they came and went and faded away, ghostly, after their work of momentary beauty
was done. One slight maple, prematurely ripened to crimson and heralding the pomp of autumn,
repeated the bright cloud-color amid the vivid verdure of a little island, and its image wavering
in the water sent the flame floating nearly to our feet.

Such are the transcendent moments of Nature, unseen and disbelieved by the untaught. The poetic
soul lays hold of every such tender pageant of beauty and keeps it forever. Iglesias, having
an additional method of preservation, did not fail to pencil rapidly the wondrous scene. When
he had finished his dashing sketch of this glory, so transitory, he peppered the whole with
cabalistic cipher, which only he could interpret into beauty.

Cancut's camp-fire now began to overpower the faint glimmers of twilight. The single-minded
Cancut, little distracted by emotions, had heaped together logs enough to heat any mansion
for a winter. The warmth was welcome, and the great flame, with its bright looks of familiar
comradery, and its talk like the complex murmur of a throng, made a fourth in our party by
no means terrible, as some other incorporeal visitors might have been. Fire was not only a
talker, but an important actor: Fire cooked for us our evening chocolate; Fire held the candlestick,
while we, without much ceremony of undressing, disposed ourselves upon our spruce-twig couch;
and Fire watched over our slumbers, crouching now as if some stealthy step were approaching,
now lifting up its head and peering across the river into some recess where the water gleamed
and rustled under dark shadows, and now sending far and wide over the stream and the clearing
and into every cleft of the forest a penetrating illumination, a blaze of light, death to all
treacherous ambush. So Fire watched while we slept, and when safety came with the earliest
gray of morning, it, too, covered itself with ashes and slept.

CHAPTER XIV.

HOMEWARD.

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful is dawn in the woods. Sweet the first opalescent stir, as if
the vanguard sunbeams shivered as they dashed along the chilly reaches of night. And the growth
of day, through violet and rose and all its golden glow of promise, is tender and tenderly
strong, as the deepening passions of dawning love. Presently up comes the sun very peremptory,
and says to people, "Go about your business! Laggards not allowed in Maine! Nothing here to
repent of, while you lie in bed and curse to-day because it cannot shake off the burden of
yesterday; all clear the past here; all serene the future; into it at once!"

Birch was ready for us. Objects we travel on, if horses, often stampede or are stampeded; if
wagons, they break down; if shanks, they stiffen; if feet, they chafe. No such trouble befalls
Birch; leak, however, it will, as ours did this morning. We gently beguiled it into the position
taken tearfully by unwhipped little boys, when they are about to receive birch. Then, with
a firebrand, the pitch of the seams was easily persuaded to melt and spread a little over the
leaky spot, and Birch was sound as a drum.

Staunch and sound Birch needed to be, for presently Penobscot, always a skittish young racer,
began to grow lively after he had shaken off the weighty shadow of Katahdin, and, kicking up
his heels, went galloping down hill, so furiously that we were at last, after sundry frantic
plunges, compelled to get off his back before worse befell us. In the balmy morning we made
our first portage through a wood of spruces. How light our firkin was growing! its pork, its
hard-tack, and its condiments were diffused among us three, and had passed into muscle. Lake
Degetus, as pretty a pocket lake as there is, followed the carry. Next came Lake Ambajeejus,
larger, but hardly less lovely. Those who dislike long names may use its shorter Indian title,
Umdo. We climbed a granite crag draped with moss long as the beard of a Druid,--a crag on the
south side of Ambajeejus or Umdo. Thence we saw Katahdin, noble as ever, unclouded in the sunny
morning, near, and yet enchantingly vague, with the blue sky which surrounded it. It was still
an isolate pyramid rising with no effect from the fair blue lakes and the fair green sea of
the birch-forest,--a brilliant sea of woods, gay as the shallows of ocean shot through with
sunbeams and sunlight reflected upward from golden sands.

We sped along all that exquisite day, best of all our poetic voyage. Sometimes we drifted and
basked in sunshine, sometimes we lingered in the birchen shade; we paddled from river to lake,
from lake to river again; the rapids whirled us along, surging and leaping under us with magnificent
gallop; frequent carries struck in, that we might not lose the forester in the waterman. It
was a fresh world that we traversed on our beautiful river-path,--new as if no other had ever
parted its overhanging bowers.

At noon we floated out upon Lake Pemadumcook, the largest bulge of the Penobscot, and irregular
as the verb To Be. Lumbermen name it Bammydumcook: Iglesias insisted upon this as the proper
reading; and as he was the responsible man of the party, I accepted it. Woods, woody hills,
and woody mountains surround Bammydumcook. I have no doubt parts of it are pretty and will
be famous in good time; but we saw little. By the time we were fairly out in the lake and away
from the sheltering shore, a black squall to windward, hiding all the West, warned us to fly,
for birches swamp in squalls. We deemed that Birch, having brought us through handsomely, deserved
a better fate: swamped it must not be. We plied paddle valiantly, and were almost safe behind
an arm of the shore when the storm overtook us, and in a moment more, safe, with a canoe only
half-full of Bammydumcook water.

It is easy to speak in scoffing tone; but when that great roaring blackness sprang upon us,
and the waves, showing their white teeth, snarled around, we were far from being in the mood
to scoff. It is impossible to say too much of the charm of this gentle scenery, mingled with
the charm of this adventurous sailing. And then there were no mosquitoes, no alligators, no
serpents uncomfortably hugging the trees, no miasmas lurking near; and blueberries always.
Dust there was none, nor the things that make dust. But Iglesias and I were breathing AIR,
--Air sweet, tender, strong, and pure as an ennobling love. It was a day very happy, for Iglesias
and I were near what we both love almost best of all the dearly-beloveds. It is such influence
as this that rescues the thought and the hand of an artist from enervating mannerism. He cannot
be satisfied with vague blotches of paint to convey impressions so distinct and vivid as those
he is forced to take direct from a Nature like this. He must be true and powerful.

The storm rolled by and gave us a noble view of Katahdin, beyond a broad, beautiful scope of
water, and rising seemingly directly from it. We fled before another squall, over another breadth
of Bammydumcook, and made a portage around a great dam below the lake. The world should know
that at this dam the reddest, spiciest, biggest, thickest wintergreen berries in the world
are to be found, beautiful as they are good.

Birch had hitherto conducted himself with perfect propriety. I, the novice, had acquired such
entire confidence in his stability of character that I treated him with careless ease, and
never listened to the warnings of my comrades that he would serve me a trick. Cancut navigated
Birch through some white water below the dam, and Birch went curveting proudly and gracefully
along, evidently feeling his oats. When Iglesias and I came to embark, I, the novice, perhaps
a little intoxicated with wintergreen berries, stepped jauntily into the laden boat. Birch,
alas, failed me. He tilted; he turned; he took in Penobscot,--took it in by the quart, by the
gallon, by the barrel; he would have sunk without mercy, had not Iglesias and Cancut succeeded
in laying hold of a rock and restoring equilibrium. I could not have believed it of Birch.
I was disappointed, and in consternation; and if I had not known how entirely it was Birch's
fault that everybody was ducked and everybody now had a wet blanket, I should have felt personally
foolish. I punished myself for another's fault and my own inexperience by assuming the wet
blankets as my share at the next carry. I suppose few of my readers imagine how many pounds
of water a blanket can absorb.

After camps at Katahdin, any residence in the woods without a stupendous mountain before the
door would have been tame. It must have been this, and not any wearying of sylvan life, that
made us hasten to reach the outermost log-house at the Millinoket carry before nightfall. The
sensation of house and in-door life would be a new one, and so satisfying in itself that we
should not demand beautiful objects to meet our first blink of awakening eyes.

An hour before sunset, Cancut steered us toward a beach, and pointed out a vista in the woods,
evidently artificial, evidently a road trodden by feet and hoofs, and ruled by parallel wheels.
A road is one of the kindliest gifts of brother man to man: if a path in the wilderness, it
comes forward like a friendly guide offering experience and proposing a comrade dash deeper
into the unknown world; if a highway, it is the great, bold, sweeping character with which
civilization writes its autograph upon a continent. Leaving our plunder on the beach, beyond
the reach of plunderers, whose great domain we were about to enter, we walked on toward the
first house, compelled at parting to believe, that, though we did not love barbarism less,
we loved civilization more. In the morning, Cancut should, with an ox-cart, bring Birch and
our traps over the three miles of the carry.

CHAPTER XV.

OUT OF THE WOODS.

What could society do without women and children? Both we found at the first house, twenty
miles from the second. The children buzzed about us; the mother milked for us one of Maine's
vanguard cows. She baked for us bread, fresh bread,--such bread! not staff of life,--life's
vaulting-pole. She gave us blueberries with cream of cream. Ah, what a change! We sat on chairs,
at a table, and ate from plates. There was a table-cloth, a salt-cellar made of glass, of glass
never seen at camps near Katahdin. There was a sugar-bowl, a milk-jug, and other paraphernalia
of civilization, including--O memories of Joseph Bourgogne!--a dome of baked beans, with a
crag of pork projecting from the apex. We partook decorously, with controlled elbows, endeavoring
to appear as if we were accustomed to sit at tables and manage plates. The men, women, and
children of Millinoket were hospitable and delighted to see strangers, and the men, like all
American men in the summer before a Presidential election, wanted to talk politics. Katahdin's
last full-bodied appearance was here; it rises beyond a breadth of black forest, a bulkier
mass, but not so symmetrical as from the southern points of view. We slept that night on a
feather-bed, and took cold for want of air, beneath a roof.

By the time we had breakfasted, Cancut arrived with Birch on an ox-sledge. Here our well-beloved
west branch of the Penobscot, called of yore Norimbagua, is married to the east branch, and
of course by marriage loses his identity, by-and-by, changing from the wild, free, reckless
rover of the forest to a tamish family-man style of river, useful to float rafts and turn mills.
However, during the first moments of the honeymoon, the happy pair, Mr. Penobscot and Miss
Milly Noket, now a unit under the marital name, are gay enough, and glide along bowery reaches
and in among fair islands, with infinite endearments and smiles, making the world very sparkling
and musical there. By-and-by they fall to romping, and, to avoid one of their turbulent frolics,
Cancut landed us, as he supposed, on the mainland, to lighten the canoe. Just as he was sliding
away down-stream, we discovered that he had left us upon an island in the midst of frantic,
impassable rapids. "Stop, stop, John Gilpin!" and luckily he did stop, otherwise he would have
gone on to tidewater, ever thinking that we were before him, while we, with our forest appetites,
would have been glaring hungrily at each other, or perhaps drawing lots for a cannibal doom.
Once again, as we were shooting a long rapid, a table-top rock caught us in mid-current. We
were wrecked. It was critical. The waves swayed us perilously this way and that. Birch would
be full of water, or overturned, in a moment. Small chance for a swimmer in such maelströms!
All this we saw, but had no time to shudder at. Aided by the urgent stream, we carefully and
delicately--for a coarse movement would have been death--wormed our boat off the rock and went
fleeting through a labyrinth of new perils, onward with a wild exhilaration, like galloping
through prairie on fire. Of all the high distinctive national pleasures of America, chasing
buffalo, stump-speaking, and the like, there is none so intense as shooting rapids in a birch.
Whenever I recall our career down the Penobscot, a longing comes over me to repeat it.

We dropped down stream without further adventures. We passed the second house, the first village,
and other villages, very white and wide-awake, melodiously named Nickertow, Pattagumpus, and
Mattascunk. We spent the first night at Mattawamkeag. We were again elbowed at a tavern table,
and compelled to struggle with real and not ideal pioneers for fried beefsteak and soggy doughboys.
The last river day was tame, but not tiresome. We paddled stoutly by relays, stopping only
once, at the neatest of farm-houses, to lunch on the most airy-substantial bread and baked
apples and cream. It is surprising how confidential a traveller always is on the subject of
his gastronomic delights. He will have the world know how he enjoyed his dinner, perhaps hoping
that the world by sympathy will enjoy its own.

Late in the afternoon of our eighth day from Greenville, Moosehead Lake, we reached the end
of birch-navigation, the great mill-dams of Indian Oldtown, near Bangor. Acres of great pine
logs, marked three crosses and a dash, were floating here at the boom; we saw what Maine men
suppose timber was made for. According to the view acted upon at Oldtown, Senaglecouna has
been for a century or centuries training up its lordly pines, that gang-saws, worked by Penobscot,
should shriek through their helpless cylinders, gnashing them into boards and chewing them
into sawdust.

Poor Birch! how out of its element it looked, hoisted on a freight-car and travelling by rail
to Bangor! There we said adieu to Birch and Cancut. Peace and plenteous provender be with him!
Journeys make friends or foes; and we remember our fat guide, not as one who from time to time
just did not drown us, but as the jolly comrade of eight days crowded with novelty and beauty,
and fine, vigorous, manly life. END.

A WOMAN.

  Not perfect, nay! but full of tender wants.--THE PRINCESS

I sat by my window sewing, one bright autumn day, thinking much of twenty other things, and
very little of the long seam that slipped away from under my fingers slowly, but steadily,
when I heard the front-door open with a quick push, and directly into my open door entered
Laura Lane, with a degree of impetus that explained the previous sound in the hall. She threw
herself into a chair before me, flung her hat on the floor, threw her shawl across the window-sill,
and looked at me without speaking: in fact, she was quite too much out of breath to speak.

I was used to Laura's impetuousness; so I only smiled and said, "Good morning."

"Oh!" said Laura, with a long breath, "I have got something to tell you, Sue."

"That's nice," said I; "news is worth double here in the country; tell me slowly, to prolong
the pleasure."

"You must guess first. I want to have you try your powers for once; guess, do!"

"Mr. Lincoln defeated?"

"Oh, no,--at least not that I know of; all the returns from this State are not in yet, of course
not from the others; besides, do you think I'd make such a fuss about politics?"

"You might," said I, thinking of all the beautiful and brilliant women that in other countries
and other times had made "fuss" more potent than Laura's about politics.

"But I shouldn't," retorted she.

"Then there is a new novel out?"

"No!" (with great indignation).

"Or the parish have resolved to settle Mr. Hermann?"

"How stupid you are, Sue! Everybody knew that yesterday."

"But I am not everybody."

"I shall have to help you, I see," sighed Laura, half provoked. "Somebody is going to be married."

"Mademoiselle, the great Mademoiselle!"

Laura stared at me. I ought to have remembered she was eighteen, and not likely to have read
Sévigné. I began more seriously, laying down my seam.

"Is it anybody I know, Laura?"

"Of course, or you wouldn't care about it, and it would be no fun to tell you."

"Is it you?"

Laura grew indignant.

"Do you think I should bounce in, in this way, to tell you I was engaged?"

"Why not? shouldn't you be happy about it?"

"Well, if I were, I should"----

Laura dropped her beautiful eyes and colored.

  "The thoughts of youth are long, long
  thoughts."

I am sure she felt as much strange, sweet shyness sealing her girlish lips at that moment as
when she came, very slowly and silently, a year after, to tell me she was engaged to Mr. Hermann.
I had to smile and sigh both.

"Tell me, then, Laura; for I cannot guess."

"I'll tell you the gentleman's name, and perhaps you can guess the lady's then: it is Frank
Addison."

"Frank Addison!" echoed I, in surprise; for this young man was one I knew and loved well, and
I could not think who in our quiet village had sufficient attraction for his fastidious taste.

He was certainly worth marrying, though he had some faults, being as proud as was endurable,
as shy as a child, and altogether endowed with a full appreciation, to say the least, of his
own charms and merits: but he was sincere, and loyal, and tender; well cultivated, yet not
priggish or pedantic; brave, well-bred, and high-principled; handsome besides. I knew him thoroughly;
I had held him on my lap, fed him with sugar-plums, soothed his child-sorrows, and scolded
his naughtiness, many a time; I had stood with him by his mother's dying bed and consoled him
by my own tears, for his mother I loved dearly; so, ever since, Frank had been both near and
dear to me, for a mutual sorrow is a tie that may bind together even a young man and an old
maid in close and kindly friendship. I was the more surprised at his engagement because I thought
he would have been the first to tell me of it; but I reflected that Laura was his cousin, and
relationship has an etiquette of precedence above any other social link.

"Yes,--Frank Addison! Now guess, Miss Sue! for he is not here to tell you,--he is in New York;
and here in my pocket I have got a letter for you, but you shan't have it till you have well
guessed."

I was--I am ashamed to confess it--but I was not a little comforted at hearing of that letter.
One may shake up a woman's heart with every alloy of life, grind, break, scatter it, till scarce
a throb of its youth beats there, but to its last bit it is feminine still; and I felt a sudden
sweetness of relief to know that my boy had not forgotten me.

"I don't know whom to guess, Laura; who ever marries after other people's fancy? If I were
to guess Sally Hetheridge, I might come as near as I shall to the truth."

Laura laughed.

"You know better," said she. "Frank Addison is the last man to marry a dried-up old tailoress."

"I don't know that he is; according to his theories of women and marriage, Sally would make
him happy. She is true-hearted, I am sure,--generous, kind, affectionate, sensible, and poor.
Frank has always raved about the beauty of the soul, and the degradation of marrying money,--therefore,
Laura, I believe he is going to marry a beauty and an heiress. I guess Josephine Bowen."

"Susan!" exclaimed Laura, with a look of intense astonishment, "how could you guess it?"

"Then it is she?"

"Yes, it is,--and I am so sorry! such a childish, giggling, silly little creature! I can't
think how Frank could fancy her; she is just like Dora in "David Copperfield,"--a perfect gosling!
I am as vexed"----

"But she is exquisitely pretty."

"Pretty! well, that is all; he might as well have bought a nice picture, or a dolly! I am out
of all patience with Frank. I haven't the heart to congratulate him."

"Don't be unreasonable, Laura; when you get as old as I am, you will discover how much better
and greater facts are than theories. It's all very well for men to say,--

  'Beauty is unripe childhood's cheat,'--

the soul is all they love,--the fair, sweet character, the lofty mind, the tender woman's heart,
and gentle loveliness; but when you come down to the statistics of love and matrimony, you
find Sally Hetheridge at sixty an old maid, and Miss Bowen at nineteen adored by a dozen men
and engaged to one. No, Laura, if I had ten sisters, and a fairy godmother for each, I should
request that ancient dame to endow them all with beauty and silliness, sure that then they
would achieve a woman's best destiny,--a home."

Laura's face burned indignantly; she hardly let me finish before she exclaimed,--

"Susan Lee! I am ashamed of you! Here are you, an old maid, as happy as anybody, decrying all
good gifts to a woman, except beauty, because, indeed, they stand in the way of her marriage!
as if a woman was only made to be a housekeeper!"

Laura's indignation amused me. I went on.

"Yes, I am happy enough; but I should have been much happier, had I married. Don't waste your
indignation, dear; you are pretty enough to excuse your being sensible, and you ought to agree
with my ideas, because they excuse Frank, and yours do not."

"I don't want to excuse him; I am really angry about it. I can't bear to have Frank throw himself
away; she is pretty now, but what will she be in ten years?"

"People in love do not usually enter into such remote calculations; love is to-day's delirium;
it has an element of divine faith in it, in not caring for the morrow. But, Laura, we can't
help this matter, and we have neither of us any conscience involved in it. Miss Bowen may be
better than we know. At any rate, Frank is happy, and that ought to satisfy both you and me
just now."

Laura's eyes filled with tears. I could see them glisten on the dark lashes, as she affected
to tie her hat, all the time untying it as fast as ever the knot slid. She was a sympathetic
little creature, and loved Frank very sincerely, having known him as long as she could remember.
She gave me a silent kiss, and went away, leaving the letter, yet unopened, lying in my lap.
I did not open it just then. I was thinking of Josephine Bowen.

Every summer, for three years, Mr. and Mrs. Bowen had come to Ridgefield for country-air, bringing
with them their adopted daughter, whose baptismal name had resigned in favor of the pet appellation
"Kitten,"--a name better adapted to her nature and aspect than the Impératrice appellation
that belonged to her. She was certainly as charming a little creature as ever one saw in flesh
and blood. Her sweet child's face, her dimpled, fair cheeks, her rose-bud of a mouth, and great,
wistful, blue eyes, that laughed like flax-flowers in a south-wind, her tiny, round chin, and
low, white forehead, were all adorned by profuse rings and coils and curls of true gold-yellow,
that never would grow long, or be braided, or stay smooth, or do anything but ripple and twine
and push their shining tendrils out of every bonnet or hat or hood the little creature wore,
like a stray parcel of sunbeams that would shine. Her delicate, tiny figure was as round as
a child's,--her funny hands as quaint as some fat baby's, with short fingers and dimpled knuckles.
She was a creature as much made to be petted as a King-Charles spaniel,--and petted she was,
far beyond any possibility of a crumpled rose-leaf. Mrs. Bowen was fat, loving, rather foolish,
but the best of friends and the poorest of enemies; she wanted everybody to be happy, and fat,
and well as she was, and would urge the necessity of wine, and entire idleness, and horse-exercise,
upon a poor minister, just as honestly and energetically as if he could have afforded them:
an idea to the contrary never crossed her mind spontaneously, but, if introduced there, brought
forth direct results of bottles, bank-bills, and loans of ancient horses, only to be checked
by friendly remonstrance, or the suggestion that a poor man might be also proud. Mr. Bowen
was tall and spare, a man of much sense and shrewd kindliness, but altogether subject and submissive
to "Kitten's" slightest wish. She never wanted anything; no princess in a story-book had less
to desire; and this entire spoiling and indulgence seemed to her only the natural course of
things. She took it as an open rose takes sunshine, with so much simplicity, and heartiness,
and beaming content, and perfume of sweet, careless affection, that she was not given over
to any little vanities or affectations, but was always a dear, good little child, as happy
as the day was long, and quite without a fear or apprehension. I had seen very little of her
in those three summers, for I had been away at the sea-side, trying to fan the flickering life
that alone was left to me with pungent salt breezes and stinging baptisms of spray, but I had
liked that little pretty well. I did not think her so silly as Laura did: she seemed to me
so purely simple, that I sometimes wondered if her honest directness and want of guile were
folly or not. But I liked to see her, as she cantered past my door on her pony, the gold tendrils
thick clustered about her throat and under the brim of her black hat, and her bright blue eyes
sparkling with the keen air, and a real wild-rose bloom on her smiling face. She was a prettier
sight even than my profuse chrysanthemums, whose masses of garnet and yellow and white nodded
languidly to the autumn winds to-day.

I recalled myself from this dream of recollection, better satisfied with Miss Bowen than I
had been before. I could see just how her beauty had bewitched Frank,--so bright, so tiny,
so loving: one always wants to gather a little, gay, odor-breathing rose-bud for one's own,
and such she was to him.

So then I opened his letter. It was dry and stiff: men's letters almost always are; they cannot
say what they feel; they will be fluent of statistics, or description, or philosophy, or politics,
but as to feeling,--there they are dumb, except in real love-letters, and, of course, Frank's
was unsatisfactory accordingly. Once, toward the end, came out a natural sentence: "Oh, Sue!
if you knew her, you wouldn't wonder!" So he had, after all, felt the apology he would not
speak; he had some little deference left for his deserted theories.

Well I knew what touched his pride, and struck that little revealing spark from his deliberate
pen: Josephine Bowen was rich, and he only a poor lawyer in a country-town: he felt it even
in this first flush of love, and to that feeling I must answer when I wrote him,--not merely
to the announcement, and the delight, and the man's pride. So I answered his letter at once,
and he answered mine in person. I had nothing to say to him, when I saw him; it was enough
to see how perfectly happy and contented he was,--how the proud, restless eyes, that had always
looked a challenge to all the world, were now tranquil to their depths. Nothing had interfered
with his passion. Mrs. Bowen liked him always, Mr. Bowen liked him now; nobody had objected,
it had not occurred to anybody to object; money had not been mentioned any more than it would
have been in Arcadia. Strange to say, the good, simple woman, and the good, shrewd man had
both divined Frank's peculiar sensitiveness, and respected it.

There was no period fixed for the engagement, it was indefinite as yet, and the winter, with
all its excitements of South and North, passed by at length, and the first of April the Bowens
moved out to Ridgefield. It was earlier than usual; but the city was crazed with excitement,
and Mr. Bowen was tried and worn; he wanted quiet. Then I saw a great deal of Josephine, and
in spite of Laura, and her still restless objections to the child's childish, laughing, inconsequent
manner, I grew into liking her: not that there seemed any great depth to her; she was not specially
intellectual, or witty, or studious, or practical; she did not try to be anything: perhaps
that was her charm to me. I had seen so many women laboring at themselves to be something,
that one who was content to live without thinking about it was a real phenomenon to me. Nothing
bores me (though I be stoned for the confession, I must make it!) more than a woman who is
bent on improving her mind, or forming her manners, or moulding her character, or watching
her motives, with that deadly-lively conscientiousness that makes so many good people disagreeable.
Why can't they consider the lilies, which grow by receiving sun and air and dew from God, and
not hopping about over the lots to find the warmest corner or the wettest hollow, to see how
much bigger and brighter they can grow? It was real rest to me to have this tiny, bright creature
come in to me every day during Frank's office-hours as unintentionally as a yellow butterfly
would come in at the window. Sometimes she strayed to the kitchen-porch, and, resting her elbows
on the window-sill and her chin on both palms, looked at me with wondering eyes while I made
bread or cake; sometimes she came by the long parlor-window, and sat down on a brioche at my
feet while I sewed, talking in her direct, unconsidered way, so fresh, and withal so good and
pure, I came to thinking the day very dull that did not bring "Kitten" to see me.

The nineteenth of April, in the evening, my door opened again with an impetuous bang; but this
time it was Frank Addison, his eyes blazing, his dark cheek flushed, his whole aspect fired
and furious.

"Good God, Sue! do you know what they've done in Baltimore?"

"What?" said I, in vague terror, for I had been an alarmist from the first: I had once lived
at the South.

"Fired on a Massachusetts regiment, and killed--nobody knows how many yet; but killed, and
wounded."

I could not speak: it was the lighted train of a powder-magazine burning before my eyes. Frank
began to walk up and down the room.

"I must go! I must! I must!" came involuntarily from his working lips.

"Frank! Frank! remember Josephine."

It was a cowardly thing to do, but I did it. Frank turned ghastly white, and sat down in a
chair opposite me. I had, for the moment, quenched his ardor; he looked at me with anxious
eyes, and drew a long sigh, almost a groan.

"Josephine!" he said, as if the name were new to him, so vitally did the idea seize all his
faculties.

"Well, dear!" said a sweet little voice at the door.

Frank turned, and seemed to see a ghost; for there in the door-way stood "Kitten," her face
perhaps a shade calmer than ordinary, swinging in one hand the tasselled hood she wore of an
evening, and holding her shawl together with the other. Over her head we discerned the spare,
upright shape of Mr. Bowen looking grim and penetrative, but not unkindly.

"What is the matter?" went on the little lady.

Nobody answered, but Frank and I looked at each other. She came in now and went toward him,
Mr. Bowen following at a respectful distance, as if he were her footman.

"I've been looking for you everywhere," said she, with the slightest possible suggestion of
reserve, or perhaps timidity, in her voice. "Father went first for me, and when you were not
at Laura's, or the office, or the post-office, or Mrs. Sledge's, then I knew you were here;
so I came with him, because--because"--she hesitated the least bit here--"we love Sue."

Frank still looked at her with his soul in his eyes, as if he wanted to absorb her utterly
into himself and then die. I never saw such a look before; I hope I never may again; it haunts
me to this day.

I can pause now to recall and reason about the curious, exalted atmosphere that seemed suddenly
to have surrounded us, as if bare spirits communed there, not flesh and blood. Frank did not
move; he sat and looked at her standing near him, so near that her shawl trailed against his
chair; but presently when she wanted to grasp something, she moved aside and took hold of another
chair,--not his: it a little thing, but it interpreted her.

"Well?" said he, in a hoarse tone.

Just then she moved, as I said, and laid one hand on the back of a chair: it was the only symptom
of emotion she showed; her voice was as childish-clear and steady as before.

"You want to go, Frank, and I thought you would rather be married to me first; so I came to
find you and tell you I would."

Frank sprang to his feet like a shot man; I cried; Josephine stood looking at us quite steadily,
her head a little bent toward me, her eyes calm, but very wide open; and Mr. Bowen gave an
audible grunt. I suppose the right thing for Frank to have done in any well-regulated novel
would have been to fall on his knees and call her all sorts of names; but people never do--that
is, any people that I know--just what the gentlemen in novels do; so he walked off and looked
out of the window. To my aid came the goddess of slang. I stopped snuffling directly.

"Josephine," said I, solemnly, "you are a brick!"

"Well, I should think so!" said Mr. Bowen, slightly sarcastic.

Josey laughed very softly. Frank came back from the window, and then the three went off together,
she holding by her father's arm, Frank on his other side. I could not but look after them as
I stood in the hall-door, and then I came back and sat down to read the paper Frank had flung
on the floor when he came in. It diverted my mind enough from myself to enable me to sleep;
for I was burning with self-disgust to think of my cowardice. I, a grown woman, supposed to
be more than ordinarily strong-minded by some people, fairly shamed and routed by a girl Laura
Lane called "Dora"!

In the morning, Frank came directly after breakfast. He had found his tongue now, certainly,--for
words seemed noway to satisfy him, talking of Josephine; and presently she came, too, as brave
and bright as ever, sewing busily on a long housewife for Frank; and after her, Mrs. Bowen,
making a huge pin-ball in red, white, and blue, and full of the trunk she was packing for Frank
to carry, to be filled with raspberry-jam, hard gingerbread, old brandy, clove-cordial, guava-jelly,
strong peppermints, quinine, black cake, cod-liver oil, horehound-candy, Brandreth's pills,
damson-leather, and cherry-pectoral, packed in with flannel and cotton bandages, lint, lancets,
old linen, and cambric handkerchiefs.

I could not help laughing, and was about to remonstrate, when Frank shook his head at me from
behind her. He said afterward he let her go on that way, because it kept her from crying over
Josephine. As for the trunk, he should give it to Miss Dix as soon as ever he reached Washington.

In a week, Frank had got his commission as captain of a company in a volunteer regiment; he
went into camp at Dartford, our chief town, and set to work in earnest at tactics and drill.
The Bowens also went to Dartford, and the last week in May came back for Josey's wedding. I
am a superstitious creature,--most women are,--and it went to my heart to have them married
in May; but I did not say so, for it seemed imperative, as the regiment were to leave for Washington
in June, early.

The day but one before the wedding was one of those warm, soft days that so rarely come in
May. My windows were open, and the faint scent of springing grass and opening blossoms came
in on every southern breath of wind. Josey had brought her work over to sit beside me. She
was hemming her wedding-veil,--a long cloud of tulle; and as she sat there, pinching the frail
stuff in her fingers, and handling her needle with such deft little ways, as if they were old
friends and understood each other, there was something so youthful, so unconscious, so wistfully
sweet in her aspect, I could not believe her the same resolute, brave creature I had seen that
night in April.

"Josey," said I, "I don't know how you can be willing to let Frank go."

It was a hard thing for me to say, and I said it without thinking.

She leaned back in her chair, and pinched her hem faster than ever.

"I don't know, either," said she. "I suppose it was because I ought. I don't think I am so
willing now, Sue: it was easy at first, for I was so angry and grieved about those Massachusetts
men; but now, when I get time to think, I do ache over it! I never let him know; for it is
just the same right now, and he thinks so. Besides, I never let myself grieve much, even to
myself, lest he might find it out. I must keep bright till he goes. It would be so very hard
on him, Susy, to think I was crying at home."

I said no more,--I could not; and happily for me, Frank came in with a bunch of wild-flowers,
that Josey took with a smile as gay as the columbines, and a blush that outshone the "pinkster-bloomjes,"
as our old Dutch "chore-man" called the wild honeysuckle. A perfect shower of dew fell from
them all over her wedding-veil.

The day of her marriage was showery as April, but a gleam of soft, fitful sunshine streamed
into the little church windows, and fell across the tiny figure that stood by Frank Addison's
side, like a ray of glory, till the golden curls glittered through her veil, and the fresh
lilies-of-the-valley that crowned her hair and ornamented her simple dress seemed to send out
a fresher fragrance, and glow with more pearly whiteness. Mrs. Bowen, in a square pew, sobbed,
and snuffled, and sopped her eyes with a lace pocket-handkerchief, and spilt cologne all over
her dress, and mashed the flowers on her French hat against the dusty pew-rail, and behaved
generally like a hen that has lost her sole chicken. Mr. Bowen sat upright in the pew-corner,
uttering sonorous hems, whenever his wife sobbed audibly; he looked as dry as a stick, and
as grim as Bunyan's giant, and chewed cardamom-seeds, as if he were a ruminating animal.

After the wedding came lunch: it was less formal than dinner, and nobody wanted to sit down
before hot dishes and go through with the accompanying ceremonies. For my part, I always did
hate gregarious eating: it is well enough for animals, in pasture or pen; but a thing that
has so little that is graceful or dignified about it as this taking food, especially as the
thing is done here in America, ought, in my opinion, to be a solitary act. I never bring my
quinine and iron to my friends and invite them to share it; why should I ask them to partake
of my beef, mutton, and pork, with the accompanying mastication, the distortion of face, and
the suppings and gulpings of fluid dishes that many respectable people indulge in? No,--let
me, at least, eat alone. But I did not do so to-day; for Josey, with the most unsentimental
air of hunger, sat down at the table and ate two sandwiches, three pickled mushrooms, a piece
of pie, and a glass of jelly, with a tumbler of ale besides. Laura Lane sat on the other side
of the table, her great dark eyes intently fixed on Josephine, and a look in which wonder was
delicately shaded with disgust quivering about her mouth. She was a feeling soul, and thought
a girl in love ought to live on strawberries, honey, and spring-water. I believe she really
doubted Josey's affection for Frank, when she saw her eat a real mortal meal on her wedding-day.
As for me, I am a poor, miserable, unhealthy creature, not amenable to ordinary dietetic rules,
and much given to taking any excitement, above a certain amount in lieu of rational food; so
I sustained myself on a cup of coffee, and saw Frank also make tolerable play of knife and
fork, though he did take some blanc-mange with his cold chicken, and profusely peppered his
Charlotte-Russe!

Mrs. Bowen alternately wept and ate pie. Mr. Bowen said the jelly tasted of turpentine, and
the chickens must have gone on Noah's voyage, they were so tough; he growled at the ale, and
asked nine questions about the coffee, all of a derogatory sort, and never once looked at Josephine,
who looked at him every time he was particularly cross, with a rosy little smile, as if she
knew why! The few other people present behaved after the ordinary fashion; and when we had
finished, Frank and Josephine, Mr. and Mrs. Bowen, Laura Lane and I, all took the train for
Dartford. Laura was to stay two weeks, and I till the regiment left.

An odd time I had, after we were fairly settled in our quiet hotel, with those two girls. Laura
was sentimental, sensitive, rather high-flown, very shy, and self-conscious; it was not in
her to understand Josey at all. We had a great deal of shopping to do, as our little bride
had put off buying most of her finery till this time, on account of the few weeks between the
fixing of her marriage-day and its arrival. It was pretty enough to see the naïve vanity with
which she selected her dresses and shawls and laces,--the quite inconsiderate way in which
she spent her money on whatever she wanted. One day we were in a dry-goods' shop, looking at
silks; among them lay one of Marie-Louise blue,--a plain silk, rich from its heavy texture
only, soft, thick, and perfect in color.

"I will have that one," said Josephine, after she had eyed it a moment, with her head on one
side, like a canary-bird. "How much is it?"

"Two fifty a yard, Miss," said the spruce clerk, with an inaccessible air.

"I shall look so nice in it!" Josey murmured. "Sue, will seventeen yards do? it must be very
full and long; I can't wear flounces."

"Yes, that's plenty," said I, scarce able to keep down a smile at Laura's face.

She would as soon have smoked a cigar on the steps of the hotel as have mentioned before anybody,
much less a supercilious clerk, that she should "look so nice" in anything. Josey never thought
of anything beyond the fact, which was only a fact. So, after getting another dress of a lavender
tint, still self-colored, but corded and rich, because it went well with her complexion, and
a black one, that "father liked to see against her yellow wig, as he called it," Mrs. Josephine
proceeded to a milliner's, where, to Laura's further astonishment, she bought bonnets for herself,
as if she had been her own doll, with an utter disregard of proper self-depreciation, trying
one after another, and discarding them for various personal reasons, till at last she fixed
on a little gray straw, trimmed with gray ribbon and white daisies, "for camp," she said, and
another of white lace, a fabric calculated to wear twice, perhaps, if its floating sprays of
clematis did not catch in any parasol on its first appearance. She called me to see how becoming
both the bonnets were, viewed herself in various ways in the glass, and at last announced that
she looked prettiest in the straw, but the lace was most elegant. To this succeeded purchases
of lace and shawls, that still farther opened Laura's eyes, and made her face grave. She confided
to me privately, that, after all, I must allow Josephine was silly and extravagant. I had just
come from that little lady's room, where she sat surrounded by the opened parcels, saying,
with the gravity of a child,--

"I do like pretty things, Sue! I like them more now than I used to, because Frank likes me.
I am so glad I'm pretty!"

I don't know how it was, but I could not quite coincide with Laura's strictures. Josey was
extravagant, to be sure; she was vain; but something so tender and feminine flavored her very
faults that they charmed me. I was not an impartial judge; and I remembered, through all, that
April night, and the calm, resolute, self-poised character that invested the lovely, girlish
face with such dignity, strength, and simplicity. No, she was not silly; I could not grant
that to Laura.

Every day we drove to the camp, and brought Frank home to dinner. Now and then he stayed with
us till the next day, and even Laura could not wonder at his "infatuation," as she had once
called it, when she saw how thoroughly Josephine forgot herself in her utter devotion to him;
over this, Laura's eyes filled with sad forebodings.

"If anything should happen to him, Sue, it will kill her," she said. "She never can lose him
and live. Poor little thing! how could Mr. Bowen let her marry him?"

"Mr. Bowen lets her do much as she likes, Laura, and always has, I imagine."

"Yes, she has been a spoiled child, I know, but it is such a pity!"

"Has she been spoiled? I believe, as a general thing, more children are spoiled by what the
Scotch graphically call 'nagging' than by indulgence. What do you think Josey would have been,
if Mrs. Brooks had been her mother?"

"I don't know, quite; unhappy, I am sure; for Mrs. Brooks's own children look as if they had
been fed on chopped catechism, and whipped early every morning, ever since they were born.
I never went there without hearing one or another of them told to sit up, or sit down, or keep
still, or let their aprons alone, or read their Bibles; and Joe Brooks confided to me in Sunday-school
that he called Deacon Smith 'old bald-head,' one day, in the street, to see if a bear wouldn't
come and eat him up, he was so tired of being a good boy!"

"That's a case in point, I think, Laura; but what a jolly little boy! he ought to have a week
to be naughty in, directly."

"He never will, while his mother owns a rod!" said she, emphatically.

I had beguiled Laura from her subject; for, to tell the truth, it was one I did not dare to
contemplate; it oppressed and distressed me too much.

After Laura went home, we stayed in Dartford only a week, and then followed the regiment to
Washington. We had been there but a few days, before it was ordered into service. Frank came
into my room one night to tell me.

"We must be off to-morrow, Sue,--and you must take her back to Ridgefield at once. I can't
have her here. I have told Mr. Bowen. If we should be beaten,--and we may,--raw troops may
take a panic, or may fight like veterans,--but if we should run, they will make a bee-line
for Washington. I should go mad to have her here with a possibility of Rebel invasion. She
must go; there is no question."

He walked up and down the room, then came back and looked me straight in the face.

"Susan, if I never come back, you will be her good friend, too?"

"Yes," said I, meeting his eye as coolly as it met mine: I had learned a lesson of Josey. "I
shall see you in the morning?"

"Yes"; and so he went back to her.

Morning came. Josephine was as bright, as calm, as natural, as the June day itself. She insisted
on fastening "her Captain's" straps on his shoulders, purloined his cumbrous pin-ball and put
it out of sight, and kept even Mrs. Bowen's sobs in subjection by the intense serenity of her
manner. The minutes seemed to go like beats of a fever-pulse; ten o'clock smote on a distant
bell; Josephine had retreated, as if accidentally, to a little parlor of her own, opening from
our common sitting-room. Frank shook hands with Mr. Bowen; kissed Mrs. Bowen dutifully, and
cordially too; gave me one strong clasp in his arms, and one kiss; then went after Josephine.
I closed the door softly behind him. In five minutes by the ticking clock he came out, and
strode through the room without a glance at either of us. I had heard her say "Good bye" in
her sweet, clear tone, just as he opened the door; but some instinct impelled me to go in to
her at once: she lay in a dead faint on the floor.

We left Washington that afternoon, and went straight back to Ridgefield. Josey was in and out
of my small house continually: but for her father and mother, I think she would have stayed
with me from choice. Rare letters came from Frank, and were always reported to me, but, of
course, never shown. If there was any change in her manner, it was more steadily affectionate
to her father and mother than ever; the fitful, playful ways of her girlhood were subdued,
but, except to me, she showed no symptom of pain, no show of apprehension: with me alone she
sometimes drooped and sighed. Once she laid her little head on my neck, and, holding me to
her tightly, half sobbed,--

"Oh, I wish--I wish I could see him just for once!"

I could not speak to answer her.

As rumors of a march toward Manassas increased, Mr. and Mrs. Bowen took her to Dartford: there
was no telegraph-line to Ridgefield, and but one daily mail, and now a day's delay of news
might be a vital loss. I could not go with them; I was too ill. At last came that dreadful
day of Bull Run. Its story of shame and blood, trebly exaggerated, ran like fire through the
land. For twenty-four long hours every heart in Ridgefield seemed to stand still; then there
was the better news of fewer dead than the first report, and we knew that the enemy had retreated,
but no particulars. Another long, long day, and the papers said Colonel ----'s regiment was
cut to pieces; the fourth mail told another story: the regiment was safe, but Captains Addison,
Black, and--Jones, I think, were missing. The fifth day brought me a letter from Mr. Bowen.
Frank was dead, shot through the heart, before the panic began, cheering on his men; he had
fallen in the very front rank, and his gallant company, at the risk of their lives, after losing
half their number as wounded or killed, had brought off his body, and carried it with them
in retreat, to find at last that they had ventured all this for a lifeless corpse! He did not
mention Josephine, but asked me to come to them at once, as he was obliged to go to Washington.
I could not, for I was too ill to travel without a certainty of being quite useless at my journey's
end. I could but just sit up. Five days after, I had an incoherent sobbing sort of letter from
Mrs. Bowen, to say that they had arranged to have the funeral at Ridgefield the next day but
one,--that Josephine would come out, with her, the night before, and directly to my house,
if I was able to receive them. I sent word by the morning's mail that I was able, and went
myself to the station to meet them.

They had come alone, and Josey preceded her mother into the little room, as if she were impatient
to have any meeting with a fresh face over. She was pale as any pale blossom of spring, and
as calm. Her curls, tucked away under the widow's-cap she wore, and clouded by the mass of
crape that shrouded her, left only a narrow line of gold above the dead quiet of her brow.
Her eyes were like the eyes of a sleep-walker: they seemed to see, but not to feel sight. She
smiled mechanically, and put a cold hand into mine. For any outward expression of emotion,
one might have thought Mrs. Bowen the widow: her eyes were bloodshot and swollen, her nose
was red, her lips tremulous, her whole face stained and washed with tears, and the skin seemed
wrinkled by their salt floods. She had cried herself sick,--more over Josephine than Frank,
as was natural.

It was but a short drive over to my house, but an utterly silent one. Josephine made no sort
of demonstration, except that she stooped to pat my great dog as we went in. I gave her a room
that opened out of mine, and put Mrs. Bowen by herself. Twice in the night I stole in to look
at her: both times I found her waking, her eyes fixed on the open window, her face set in its
unnatural quiet; she smiled, but did not speak. Mrs. Bowen told me in the morning that she
had neither shed a tear nor slept since the news came; it seemed to strike her at once into
this cold silence, and so she had remained. About ten, a carriage was sent over from the village
to take them to the funeral. This miserable custom of ours, that demands the presence of women
at such ceremonies, Mrs. Bowen was the last person to evade; and when I suggested to Josey
that she should stay at home with me, she looked surprised, and said, quietly, but emphatically,
"Oh, no!"

After they were gone, I took my shawl and went out on the lawn. There was a young pine dense
enough to shield me from the sun, sitting under which I could see the funeral-procession as
it wound along the river's edge up toward the burying-ground, a mile beyond the station. But
there was no sun to trouble me; cool gray clouds brooded ominously over all the sky; a strong
south-wind cried, and wailed, and swept in wild gusts through the woods, while in its intervals
a dreadful quiet brooded over earth and heaven,--over the broad weltering river, that, swollen
by recent rain, washed the green grass shores with sullen flood,--over the heavy masses of
oak and hickory trees that hung on the farther hill-side,--over the silent village and its
gathering people. The engine-shriek was borne on the coming wind from far down the valley.
There was an air of hushed expectation and regret in Nature itself that seemed to fit the hour
to its event.

Soon I saw the crowd about the station begin to move, and presently the funeral-bell swung
out its solemn tones of lamentation; its measured, lingering strokes, mingled with the woful
shrieking of the wind and the sighing of the pine-tree overhead, made a dirge of inexpressible
force and melancholy. A weight of grief seemed to settle on my very breath: it was not real
sorrow; for, though I knew it well, I had not felt yet that Frank was dead,--it was not real
to me,--I could not take to my stunned perceptions the fact that he was gone. It is the protest
of Nature, dimly conscious of her original eternity, against this interruption of death, that
it should always be such an interruption, so incredible, so surprising, so new. No,--the anguish
that oppressed me now was not the true anguish of loss, but merely the effect of these adjuncts;
the pain of want, of separation, of reaching in vain after that which is gone, of vivid dreams
and tearful waking,--all this lay in wait for the future, to be still renewed, still suffered
and endured, till time should be no more. Let all these pangs of recollection attest it,--these
involuntary bursts of longing for the eyes that are gone and the voice that is still,--these
recoils of baffled feeling seeking for the one perfect sympathy forever fled,--these pleasures
dimmed in their first resplendence for want of one whose joy would have been keener and sweeter
to us than our own,--these bitter sorrows crying like children in pain for the heart that should
have soothed and shared them! No,-- there is no such dreary lie as that which prates of consoling
Time! You who are gone, if in heaven you know how we mortals fare, you know that life took
from you no love, no faith,--that bitterer tears fall for you to-day than ever wet your new
graves,--that the gayer words and the recalled smiles are only like the flowers that grow above
you, symbols of the deeper roots we strike in your past existence,--that to the true soul there
is no such thing as forgetfulness, no such mercy as diminishing regret!

Slowly the long procession wound up the river,--here, black with plumed hearse and sable mourners,--there,
gay with regimental band and bright uniforms,--no stately, proper funeral, ordered by custom
and marshalled by propriety, but a straggling array of vehicles: here, the doctor's old chaise,--there,
an open wagon, a dusty buggy, a long, open omnibus, such as the village-stable kept for pleasure-parties
or for parties of mourning who wanted to go en masse.

All that knew Frank, in or about Ridgefield, and all who had sons or brothers in the army,
swarmed to do him honor; and the quaint, homely array crept slowly through the valley, to the
sound of tolling bell and moaning wind and the low rush of the swollen river,--the first taste
of war's desolation that had fallen upon us, the first dark wave of a whelming tide!

As it passed out of sight, I heard the wheels cease, one by one, their crunch and grind on
the gravelled road up the slope of the grave-yard. I knew they had reached that hill-side where
the dead of Ridgefield lie calmer than its living; and presently the long-drawn notes of that
hymn-tune consecrated to such occasions--old China--rose and fell in despairing cadences on
my ear. If ever any music was invented for the express purpose of making mourners as distracted
as any external thing can make them, it is the bitter, hopeless, unrestrained wail of this
tune. There is neither peace nor resignation in it, but the very exhaustion of raving sorrow
that heeds neither God nor man, but cries out, with the soulless agony of a wind-harp, its
refusal to be comforted.

At length it was over, and still in that same dead calm Josephine came home to me. Mrs. Bowen
was frightened, Mr. Bowen distressed. I could not think what to do, at first; but remembering
how sometimes a little thing had utterly broken me down from a regained calmness after loss,
some homely association, some recall of the past, I begged of Mr. Bowen to bring up from the
village Frank's knapsack, which he had found in one of his men's hands,--the poor fellow having
taken care of that, while he lost his own: "For the captain's wife," he said. As soon as it
came, I took from it Frank's coat, and his cap and sword. My heart was in my mouth as I entered
Josephine's room, and saw the fixed quiet on her face where she sat. I walked in, however,
with no delay, and laid the things down on her bed, close to where she sat. She gave one startled
look at them and then at me; her face relaxed from all its quiet lines; she sank on her knees
by the bedside, and, burying her head in her arms, cried, and cried, and cried, so helplessly,
so utterly without restraint, that I cried, too. It was impossible for me to help it. At last
the tears exhausted themselves; the dreadful sobs ceased to convulse her; all drenched and
tired, she lifted her face from its rest, and held out her arms to me. I took her up, and put
her to bed like a child. I hung the coat and cap and sword where she could see them. I made
her take a cup of broth, and before long, with her eyes fixed on the things I had hung up,
she fell asleep, and slept heavily, without waking, till the next morning.

I feared almost to enter her room when I heard her stir; I had dreaded her waking,--that terrible
hour that all know who have suffered, the dim awakening shadow that darkens so swiftly to black
reality; but I need not have dreaded it for her. She told me afterward that in all that sleep
she never lost the knowledge of her grief; she did not come into it as a surprise. Frank had
seemed to be with her, distant, sad, yet consoling; she felt that he was gone, but not utterly,--that
there was drear separation and loneliness, but not forever.

When I went in, she lay there awake, looking at her trophy, as she came to call it, her eyes
with all their light quenched and sodden out with crying, her face pale and unalterably sad,
but natural in its sweetness and mobility. She drew me down to her and kissed me.

"May I get up?" she asked; and then, without waiting for an answer, went on,--"I have been
selfish, Sue; I will try to be better now; I won't run away from my battle. Oh, how glad I
am he didn't run away! It is dreadful now, dreadful! Perhaps, if I had to choose if he should
have run away or--or this, I should have wanted him to run,--I'm afraid I should. But I am
glad now. If God wanted him, I'm glad he went from the front ranks. Oh, those poor women whose
husbands ran away, and were killed, too!"

She seemed to be so comforted by that one thought! It was a strange trait in the little creature;
I could not quite fathom it.

After this, she came down-stairs and went about among us, busying herself in various little
ways. She never went to the grave-yard; but whenever she was a little tired, I was sure to
find her sitting in her room with her eyes on that cap and coat and sword. Letters of condolence
poured in, but she would not read them or answer them, and they all fell into my hands. I could
not wonder; for, of all cruel conventionalities, visits and letters of condolence seem to me
the most cruel. If friends can be useful in lifting off the little painful cares that throng
in the house of death till its presence is banished, let them go and do their work quietly
and cheerfully; but to make a call or write a note, to measure your sorrow and express theirs,
seems to me on a par with pulling a wounded man's bandages off and probing his hurt, to hear
him cry out and hear yourself say how bad it must be!

Laura Lane was admitted, for Frank's sake, as she had been his closest and dearest relative.
The day she came, Josey had a severe headache, and looked wretchedly. Laura was shocked, and
showed it so obviously, that, had there been any real cause for her alarm, I should have turned
her out of the room without ceremony, almost before she was fairly in it. As soon as she left,
Josey looked at me and smiled.

"Laura thinks I am going to die," said she; "but I'm not. If I could, I wouldn't, Sue; for
poor father and mother want me, and so will the soldiers by-and-by." A weary, heart-breaking
look quivered in her face as she went on, half whispering,--"But I should--I should like to
see him!"

In September she went away. I had expected it ever since she spoke of the soldiers needing
her. Mrs. Bowen went to the sea-side for her annual asthma. Mr. Bowen went with Josephine to
Washington. There, by some talismanic influence, she got admission to the hospitals, though
she was very pretty, and under thirty. I think perhaps her pale face and widow's-dress, and
her sad, quiet manner, were her secret of success. She worked here like a sprite; nothing daunted
or disgusted her. She followed the army to Yorktown, and nursed on the transport-ships. One
man said, I was told, that it was "jes' like havin' an apple-tree blow raound, to see that
Mis' Addison; she was so kinder cheery an' pooty, an' knew sech a sight abaout nussin', it
did a feller lots of good only to look at her chirpin' abaout."

Now and then she wrote to me, and almost always ended by declaring she was "quite well, and
almost happy." If ever she met with one of Frank's men,--and all who were left reënlisted for
the war,--he was sure to be nursed like a prince, and petted with all sorts of luxuries, and
told it was for his old captain's sake. Mr. and Mrs. Bowen followed her everywhere, as near
as they could get to her, and afforded unfailing supplies of such extra hospital-stores as
she wanted; they lavished on her time and money and love enough to have satisfied three women,
but Josey found use for it all--for her work. Two months ago, they all came back to Dartford.
A hospital had been set up there, and some one was needed to put it in operation; her experience
would be doubly useful there, and it was pleasant for her to be so near Frank's home, to be
among his friends and hers.

I went in, to do what I could, being stronger than usual, and found her hard at work. Her face
retained its rounded outline, her lips had recovered their bloom, her curls now and then strayed
from the net under which she carefully tucked them, and made her look as girlish as ever, but
the girl's expression was gone; that tender, patient, resolute look was born of a woman's stern
experience; and though she had laid aside her widow's-cap, because it was inconvenient, her
face was so sad in its repose, so lonely and inexpectant, she scarce needed any outward symbol
to proclaim her widowhood. Yet under all this new character lay still some of those childish
tastes that made, as it were, the "fresh perfume" of her nature: everything that came in her
way was petted; a little white kitten followed her about the wards, and ran to meet her, whenever
she came in, with joyful demonstrations; a great dog waited for her at home, and escorted her
to and from the hospital; and three canaries hung in her chamber;--and I confess here, what
I would not to Laura, that she retains yet a strong taste for sugar-plums, gingerbread, and
the "Lady's Book." She kept only so much of what Laura called her vanity as to be exquisitely
neat and particular in every detail of dress; and though a black gown, and a white linen apron,
collar, and cuffs do not afford much room for display, yet these were always so speckless and
spotless that her whole aspect was refreshing.

Last week there was a severe operation performed in the hospital, and Josephine had to be present.
She held the poor fellow's hand till he was insensible from the kindly chloroform they gave
him, and, after the surgeons were through, sat by him till night, with such a calm, cheerful
face, giving him wine and broth, and watching every indication of pulse or skin, till he really
rallied, and is now doing well.

As I came over, the next day, I met Doctor Rivers at the door of her ward.

"Really," said he, "that little Mrs. Addison is a true heroine!"

The kitten purred about my feet, and as I smiled assent to him, I said inwardly to myself,--

"Really, she is a true woman!"

LYRICS OF THE STREET.

III.

THE CHARITABLE VISITOR.

  She carries no flag of fashion, her clothes are but passing plain,
  Though she comes from a city palace all jubilant with her reign.
  She threads a bewildering alley, with ashes and dust thrown out,
  And fighting and cursing children, who mock as she moves about.

  Why walk you this way, my lady, in the snow and slippery ice?
  These are not the shrines of virtue,--here misery lives, and vice:
  Rum helps the heart of starvation to a courage bold and bad;
  And women are loud and brawling, while men sit maudlin and mad.

  I see in the corner yonder the boy with the broken arm,
  And the mother whose blind wrath did it, strange guardian from childish
    harm.
  That face will grow bright at your coming, but your steward might come
    as well,
  Or better the Sunday teacher that helped him to read and spell.

  Oh! I do not come of my willing, with froward and restless feet;
  I have pleasant tasks in my chamber, and friends well-beloved to greet.
  To follow the dear Lord Jesus I walk in the storm and snow;
  Where I find the trace of His footsteps, there lilies and roses grow.

  He said that to give was blessed, more blessed than to receive;
  But what could He take, dear angels, of all that we had to give,
  Save a little pause of attention, and a little thrill of delight,
  When the dead were waked from their slumbers, and the blind recalled to
    sight?

  Say, the King came forth with the morning, and opened His palace-doors,
  Thence flinging His gifts like sunbeams that break upon marble floors;
  But the wind with wild pinions caught them, and carried them round
    about:
  Though I looked till mine eyes were dazzled, I never could make them out.

  But He bade me go far and find them, "go seek them with zeal and pain;
  The hand is most welcome to me that brings me mine own again;
  And those who follow them farthest, with faithful searching and sight,
  Are brought with joy to my presence, and sit at my feet all night."

  So, hither and thither walking, I gather them broadly cast;
  Where yonder young face doth sicken, it may be the best and last.
  In no void or vague of duty I come to his aid to-day;
  I bring God's love to his bed-side, and carry God's gift away.

MR. AXTELL.

PART V.

"Miss Anna! Miss Anna! Doctor Percival is waiting for you," were the opening words of the next
day's life. Its bells had had no influence in restoring me to consciousness of existence. I
never have liked metallic commanders. Now Jeffy's Ethiopian tones were inspiriting, and to
their music I began the mystic march of another day.

Doctor Percival was not out of patience, it seemed, with waiting; for, as I went in, he was
so engrossed with a morning paper that he did not even look up, or notice me, until I made
myself vocal, and then only to say,--

"Ring for breakfast, Anna; I shall have done by the time it comes."

"It is here, father"; and he dropped the newspaper, turned his chair to the table, leaned his
arms upon it, covered his precious face with two thin, quivering hands, and remained thus,
whilst I prepared coffee, and lingered as long as possible in the seeming occupation.

Jeffy--and I suspect that the mischievous African designed the act--overturned the coffee in
handing it to my father, who is not endowed with the most equable temper ever consigned to
mortals; but this morning he did not give Jeffy even a severe look, for his eyes were full
of tender pity, such as I had never seen in them in all the past.

"How is your patient?" I asked.

"Better, thank God!" he replied.

"Were you with him all night?"

"Yes, all night. I must go out this morning to see some patients. I'll send up a nurse from
the hospital on my way. I don't think the delirium will return before mid-day; can you watch
him till then, Anna?"--and he asked with a seeming doubt either of my willingness or my ability,
perhaps a mingling of both.

I did not like to recount my serious failures with Miss Axtell, but I answered,--

"I will try."

Before he went, he took me in to the place of my watching. The gentleman was asleep. The housekeeper
was quite willing to relinquish her office. The good physician gave me orders concerning the
febrifuge to be administered in case of increase of febrile symptoms, and saying that "it wouldn't
be long ere some one came to relieve me," he bent over the sleeping patient for an instant,
and the next was gone.

I think a half-hour must have fled in silence, when Jeffy stole in, his eyes opening as Chloe's
had done not many days agone, when the vision of myself was painted thereon. I upheld a cautionary
index, and he was still as a mouse, but like a mouse he proceeded to investigate; he opened
a bureau-drawer the least way, and pushing his arm in where my laces were wont to dwell, he
drew out, with exultant delight, the wig before mentioned.

"What do you s'pose he wants with this thing'?" whispered Jeffy; and he pointed to the soft,
fair masses of curling hair that rested against the pillow.

Jeffy was a spoiled boy,--"my doing," everybody said, and it may have been truly. He was Chloe's
son, and had inherited her ways and affectionate heart, and for these I forgave him much.

I said, "Hush!"--whereupon he lifted up the wig and deposited it upon the top of his tangled
circlets of hair before I could stay him.

I reached out my hand for it, not venturing on words, for fear of disturbing the patient; but
Jeffy, with unpardonable wilfulness, danced out of my circuit, and at the same instant the
sick man turned his head, and beheld Jeffy in the possession of his property. Jeffy looked
very repentant, said in low, deprecatory tones, "I'm sorry," and, depositing the wig in the
drawer, hastened to escape, which I know he would not have done but for the disabled condition
of the invalid, who could only look his wrath. I had so hoped that he would sleep until some
one came; but this unfortunate Jeffy had dissipated my hope, and left me in pitiable dilemma.

In the vain endeavor to restore the scattered influence of Morpheus, I flew to one of the aids
of the mystic god, and beseeching its assistance, I prepared to administer the draught. I could
not find a spoon on the instant. When I did, I made a mistake in dropping the opiate, and was
obliged to commence anew, and all the while that handsome face, with large, pleading eyes in
it, held me in painful duress. When I turned towards him and held the glass to his lips, I
trembled, as I had not done, even in the church, when Abraham Axtell and I stood before the
opened entrance into earth. All the words that I that day had heard in the tower were ringing
like clarions in the air, and they shook me with their vibrant forces.

"Am I in heaven?"

It was the same voice that had said to Miss Axtell, "Will you send me out again?" that spake
these words.

Was he going into delirium again? I was desirous of keeping him upon our planet, and I said,--

"Oh, no,--they don't need morphine in heaven."

"They need you there, though. You must go now," he said; and he made an effort to take the
glass from my hand.

"I have never been in heaven," I said.

"Then they deceive, they deceive, and there isn't any heaven! Oh, what if after all there shouldn't
be such a place?"

He lifted up his one usable hand in agony.

"We wait until we die, before going there," I said; "I am alive, don't you see?"

"Alive, and not dead? you! whom I killed eighteen years ago, have you come to reproach me now?
Oh, I have suffered, even to atonement, for it! You would pardon, if you only knew what I have
suffered for you."

Surely delirium had returned. I urged the poor man to take the contents of the glass.

He promised, upon condition of my forgiveness,--forgiveness for having killed me, who never
had been killed, who was surely alive. Jeffy had come in again, and had listened to the pleading.

"Why don't you tell him yes, Miss Anna? He doesn't know a word he's sayin'. It'll keep him
quiet like; he's like a baby," he whispered, with a covert pull at my dress by way of impressment.

And so, guided by Chloe's boy, I said, "I forgive."

"Why don't you go, if you forgive me? I don't like to keep you here, when you belong up there";
and he pointed his words by the aid of his available hand.

I knew then why Miss Axtell had loved this man: it was simply one of those cruel, compulsory
offerings up of self, that allure one, in open sight of torture, on to the altar. Oh, poor
woman! why hath thy Maker so forsaken thee? And in mute wonder at this most wondrous wrong,
that crept into mortal life when the serpent went out through Eden and left an opening in the
Garden, I forgot for the while my present responsibility, in compassionate pity for the pale,
beautiful lady in Redleaf, into whose heart this man had come,--unwillingly, I knew, when I
looked into his face, and yet, having come, must grow into its Eden, even unto the time that
Eternity shadows; and I sent out the arms of my spirit, and twined them invisibly around her,
who truly had spoken when she said, "I want you," with such hungry tones. God, the Infinite,
has given me comprehension of such women, has given me His own loving pity,--in little human
grains, it is true, but they come from "the shining shore." "Miss Axtell does want me," I thought;
"she is right,--I am gladness to her."

"Will you go?" came from the invalid.

"A woman, loving thus, never comes alone into a friend's heart," something said; "you must
receive her shadow"; and I looked at the person who had said, "Will you go?"

There are various words used in the dictionary of life, descriptive of men such as him now
before me. They mostly are formed in syllables numbering four and five, which all integrate
in the one word irresistible: how pitifully I abhor that word!--every letter has a serpent-coil
in it. "Love thy neighbor even as thyself." It is good that these words came just here to wall
themselves before the torrent that might not have been stayed until I had laid the mountain
of my thought upon the sycophantic syllabication that the world loves to "lip" unto the world,--the
false world, that, blinded, blinds to blinder blindness those that fain would behold. There
is a crying out in the earth for a place of torment; there are sins for which we want what
God hath prepared for the wicked.

"Are you going?"--and this time there was plaintive moaning in the accents.

"You must take him in, too," my spirit whispered; and I acted the "I will" that formed in the
mental court where my soul sat enthroned,--my own judge.

"Oh, no, I am not going away," I said; "I am come to stay with you, until some one else comes."

A certain resignment of opposition seemed to be effected. I knew it would be so,--it is in
all such natures,--and he seemed intent upon making atonement for his imaginary wrong, since
I would stay.

"Mary, I didn't mean to kill you," he said; "I wouldn't have destroyed your young life; oh!
I wouldn't;--but I did! I did!"

"You make some strange mistake; you ought not to talk," I urged, surprised at this second time
being called Mary.

"Yes, I guess 'twas a mistake,--you're right, all a mistake,--I didn't mean to kill you; but
I did him, though. Oh! I wanted to destroy him,--he hadn't any pity, he wouldn't yield. But
it's you, Mary, you oughtn't to hear me say such things of him."

"I am not Mary, I am Miss Percival; and you may tell me."

"I beg pardon, I had no right to call you Mary; but it is there, now, on your tomb-stone in
the old church-yard,--Mary Percival,--there isn't any Miss there. Do they call you Miss Percival
in heaven?"--and he began to sing, deep, stirring songs of rhythmic melody, that catch up individual
existences and bear them to congregated continents, where mountains sing and seas respond,
amid the encore of starry spheres.

O Music! if we could but divine thee, dear divinity, thou mightst be less divine! then let
us be content to be divinized in thee!--and I was. I let him sing, knowing that it was in delirium;
and for the moment my wonder ceased concerning Miss Axtell's love for Herbert.

This while, Jeffy stood speechless, transfused into melody. Whence came this love of Africans
for harmonious measure? Oh, I remember: the scroll of song whereon were written the accents
of the joyed morning-stars, when they grew jubilant that earth stood create, was let fall by
an angel upon Afric's soil. No one of the children of the land was found of wisdom sufficient
to read the hieroglyphs; therefore the sacred roll was divided among the souls in the nation:
unto each was given one note from the divine whole.

"Jeffy must have received a semi-breve as his portion," I thought, for he was rapt in ecstasy.

"Oh, sing again!" he said, unconsciously, when, exhausted, the invalid reached the shore of
Silence,--where he did not long linger, for he changed his song to lament that he could not
reach his ship, that would sail before he could recover; and he made an effort to rise. He
fell back, fainting.

It seemed a great blessing that at this moment the housekeeper introduced the person Doctor
Percival had sent.

That night, and for many after, it seemed, my father looked extremely anxious. I did not see
the patient again until the eventful twenty-fifth of March was past.

Two days only was I permitted for my visit. Would Miss Axtell expect me? or had she, it might
be, forgotten that she had asked my presence?

It was evening when I arrived at the parsonage. Sophie was full of sweet sisterly joy on seeing
me, and of surprise when I told her what had occurred in our father's house. It was so unprecedented,
this taking in a stranger whose name and home were unknown; for I could not tell Sophie my
conviction that father had discovered who the patient was.

"Miss Axtell is almost well." Sophie gave the information before I found time to ask. "She
pleases to be quite charming to me. I hope she will be equally gracious to you." And so I hoped.

From out the ark of the round year God sends some day-doves of summer into the barren spring-time,
to sing of coming joys and peck the buds into opening. One of His sending brooded over Redleaf
when I walked forth in its morning-time to redeem my promise.

"Miss Percival! I'm so glad!"

Katie showed me into the room that once I had been so much afraid of. She did not long leave
me there.

"Miss Lettie would like to see you in her room."

Sophie was right. She is almost well.

"Come!" was the sole word that met my entering in; then followed two small acts, supposed to
be conventionalities. Isn't it good that all suppositions are not based upon truth? I thought
it good then. I hope I may away on to the dawning of the new life.

This was my first seeing of Miss Axtell in her self-light. She said,--

"This is the only day that I have been down in time for breakfast,"--she, who looked as if
the fair Dead-Sea fruits had been all of sustenance that had dropped through the leaden waves
for her; and an emotion of awe swept past me, borne upon the renewal of the consciousness that
I had been made essential to her.

"I knew that you would come," she continued. "Oh! I have great confidence in you; you must
never disappoint me,--will you?"--and, playfully, she motioned me to the footstool where she
had appointed me a place on the first night when she told me of her mother, dead.

I assured her that I should. I must begin that moment by mentioning the time of my visit's
duration.

"How long?" and there was import in the tone of her voice.

"I must be at home to-morrow morning."

"No reprieve?"

I answered, "None,"--and turned the circlet of obligation upon my finger.

"I am glad you told me; I like limits; I wish to know the precise moment when my rainbows will
disband. It's very nice, meeting Fate half-way; there's consolation in knowing that it will
have as far to go as you on the return voyage."

I smiled; a little inward ripple of gladness sent muscle-waves to my lips. She noticed it,
and her tone changed.

"I see, I see, my good little Anemone! You don't know how exultant it is to stand alone, above
the forest of your fellows,--to lift up your highest bough of feeling,--to meet the Northland's
fiercest courser that thinks to lay you low. Did you ever turn to see the expression with which
the last leap of wind is met, the peculiar suavity of the bowing of the boughs, that says as
plainly as ever did speaking leaves, 'You have left me myself'? You don't understand these
things, you small wind-flower, that have grown sheltered from all storms!"

"One would think not, Miss Axtell, but"--and I paused until she bade me "Go on."

"Perhaps it is vanity,--I hope not,--but it seems to me that I have a mirror of all Nature
set into the frame of my soul. It isn't a part of myself; it is a mental telescope, that resolves
the actions of all the people around me into myriads of motives, atomies of inducement, that
I see woven and webbed around them, by the sight-power given. Besides, I am not an anemone,--oh,
no! I am something more substantial."

"I see, very"; and before I could divine her intent, she had lifted up my face in both her
hands and held my eyes in her own intensity of gaze, as, oh, long ago! I remember my mother
to have done, when she doubted my perfect truth.

Miss Axtell was engaged in looking over old treasured letters, bits of memory-memoranda, when
I arrived. She had laid them aside to greet me, somewhat hastily, and a rustling commotion
testified their feeling at their summary disposal. Now she sat framed in by the yellow-and-white
foam, that had settled to motionlessness,--an island in the midst of waves of memory.

"Did you bring my treasures?" were the first words, after investigating my truth.

"They are safely here."

I gave the package.

She made no mention of former occurrences. She trusted me implicitly, with that far-deep of
confidence that says, "Explanation would be useless; your spirit recognizes mine." She only
said, drooping her regal head with the slightest dip into motion,--

"I want to tell you a story; it is of people who are, some in heaven and some upon the earth;--a
story with which you must have something to do for me, because I cannot do it for myself. I
did not intend telling so soon, but my disbanded rainbow lies in the future."

Before commencing, she wandered up and down the room a little, stopped before the dressing-bureau,
brushed back the hair, with many repetitions of stroke, from the temples wherein so much of
worship had been gathered, smoothed down the swollen arches of veinery that fretted across
either temple's dome, looked one moment into the censers of incense that burned always with
emotionary fires, flashed out a little superabundant flame into the cold quicksilver, turned
the key, fastening our two selves in, examined the integrity of the latch leading into the
dressing-room beyond, threw up the window-sash,--the same one that Mr. Axtell had lifted to
look out into the night for her,--asked, "should I be cold, if she left it open?" looked contentment
at my negative answer, rolled the lounge out to where her easy-chair was still vibrating in
memory of her late presence, made me its occupant, reached out for the package over which I
had been guardian, pinioned it between her two beautiful hands, laid it down one moment to
wrap a shawl around me, then, resuming it, sat where she had when she said, "I want to tell
you a story," and perhaps she was praying. I may never know, but it was many moments before
she made answer to my slight touch, "Yes, child, I have not forgotten," and with face hidden
from me she told me her story.

MISS AXTELL'S STORY.

"Alice Axtell was my sister. Eighteen years ago last August-time she was here.

"There has been beauty in the Axtell race; in her it was radiant. It would have been truth
to say, 'She is beautiful.'

"I said that it was August-time,--the twenty-seventh day of the month. Alice and I had been
out in the little bay outside of Redcliff beach, with your sister. You don't remember her:
she was like you. Doctor Percival had given Mary a boat, taught her to row it, and she had
that afternoon given Alice a first lesson in the art. The day went down hot and sultry; we
lingered on the cooler beach until near evening. We saw clouds lying dark along the western
horizon, and that voiceless lightnings played in them. Then we came home. The air was tiresome,
the walk seemed endless; still Alice and Mary lingered at the gate of your father's house to
say their last words. The mid-summer weariness was over us both, as we reached home. We came
up to this room,--our room then. Alice said,--

"'I think I shall go to bed, I'm so tired.'

"She closed the blinds. As she did so, a crash of thunder came.

"'We're going to have a thunder-shower, after all,' she said; 'how quickly it is coming up!
Come and see.'

"I looked a moment out. Jet masses of vapor were curling up amid the stars, blotting out, one
by one, their brightness from the sky. Alice was always timid in thunder-storms. She shuddered,
as a second flash pealed out its thunder, and crept up to me. I put my arms around her, and
rested my cheek against her head. She was trembling violently.

"'Lie down, Allie; let me close the other blinds; don't look out any longer.'

"Our mother came in.

"'I came to see if the windows were all down,' she said; 'it will rain in a moment'; and she
hurried away, and I heard her closing, one after another, the windows that had been all day open.

"Alice lay for a long time quietly. The storm uprose with fearful might; it shook the house
in its passing grasp, and I sat by this table, listening to the music wrought out of the thunderous
echoes.

"'Couldn't we have a window open?' Alice asked; 'I feel stifled in here'; and she went across
the room and lifted the sash before I was aware.

"I looked around, when I heard the noise. The same instant there came a blinding, dazzling
light; then, that awful vacuous rattle in the throat of thunder that tells it comes in the
name of Death the destroyer.

"'Oh, Allie, come away!' I screamed.

"In obedience to my wish, she leaned towards me; but, oh, her face! I caught her, ere she fell,
even. I sent out the wings of my voice, but no one heard me, no one came. I could not lift
her in my arms, so I laid her upon the floor, and ran down.

"'Go to Alice,--the lightning!' was all I could say, and it was enough. I heard groans before
I gained the street.

"My pale, silent sister was stronger than the storm which flapped its wings around me and threatened
to take me to its eyry; but it did not; it permitted me to gain Doctor Percival's door. I was
dazzled with the lightning, only my brain was distinct with 'its skeleton of woe,' when I found
myself in your father's house.

"I could not see the faces that were there. I asked for Doctor Percival. Some one answered,
'He is not come home. What has happened?' and Mary ran forward in alarm.

"'It is lightning! Oh, come!' was all that I could utter; and with me there went out into the
pouring rain every soul that was there when I went in.

"'She is dead; there is nothing to be done.'

"Three hours after the stroke, these words came. Then I looked up. Alice, with her little white
face of perfect beauty, lay upon that bed. Thunder-storms would never more make her tremble,
never awake to fear the spirit gone. It was Doctor Percival from whom these fateful words came.
I had had so much hope! In very desperation of feeling, I strove to look up to his face. My
eyes were arrested before they reached him.

"'By what?' did you ask?"

Her long silence had incited me to question, and she turned her face to me, and slowly said,--

"By the Lightning of Life.

"Two sisters, in one night,--one unto Death, the other unto Life. Beside Doctor Percival was
standing one. I do not know what he was like, I cannot tell you; but, believe me, it is solemnly
true, that, that instant, this human being flashed into my heart and soul. I saw, and felt,
and have heard the rolling thunder that followed the flash to this very hour. It was very hard,
over my Alice. If I had only been she, how much, how much happier it would have been!--and
yet it must have been wiser. She could not have endured to the end. She would have failed in
the bitterness of the trial.

"My Alice! I am devoutly thankful that you are safe in heaven!"--and for a moment the hands
were lifted up from the treasured packet; they closed over it, and she went on.

"Alice was wrapped up in earth. In the moment when the first fold of the clod-mantle, that
trails about us all at the last, fell protectingly over her, I was in that condition of superlative
misery that cries out for something to the very welkin that sends down such harsh hardness;
and I hurried my eyes out of the open grave, only to find them again arrested by the same soul
that had stood beside Doctor Percival and Alice in her death. They said something to me, kinder
than ever came out of the blue vault, and yet they awoke the fever of resistance. I would have
no thought but that of Alice. What right had any other to come in then and there?

"September came. Its days brought my sorrow to me ever anew. The early dew baptized it; the
great sun laid his hot hand upon its brow and named it Death, in the name of the Mighty God;
and the evening stars looked down on me, rocking Alice in my soul, and singing lamentful lullabies
to her, sleeping, till such time as Lethean vapors curled through the horizon of my mind, and
hid its formless shadows of suffering.

"Mary Percival was Alice's best friend; as such, she came to comfort and to mourn with me.
One day, it was the latest of September's thirty, Mary lured me on to the sea-shore, and into
her small boat once more. Little echoes of gladness sprang up from the sea; voices from Alice's
silence floated on the unbroken waves.

"'You look a little like yourself again; I'm so glad to see it!' Mary said. 'There comes Mr.
McKey. I wonder what brings him here.'

"I looked up, and saw, slowly walking on to the point at which Mary was securing her boat,
the possessor of the existence that had come into mine. There was no way for me to flee, except
seaward; and of two suicides I chose the pleasanter, and I stayed.

"'Who is it, Mary?' I had time to question, and she to answer.

"'It is Bernard McKey; he has come to study medicine in papa's office; he came the night Alice
died.'

"He was too near to permit of questioning more, and so I stood upon the seashore and saw my
fate coming close.

"Mary simply said, 'Good evening,' to him, followed by the requisite introductory words that
form the basis of acquaintance.

"'I think Miss Axtell and I scarcely need an introduction,' he said; nevertheless he looked
the pleasure it had strewed into his field, and guarded it, as a careful husbandman would choicest
seed.

"He asked the style of question which monosyllables can never answer, to which responding,
one has to offer somewhat of herself; and all the time of that sombre autumn, there grew from
out the chasm of the lightning-stroke luxuriant foliage. I gave it all the resistance of my
nature, yet I knew, as the consumptive knows, that I should be conquered by my conqueror. It
was only the old story of the captive polishing chains to wear them away; and yet Mr. McKey
was simply very civil and intentionally kind, where he might have been courteously indifferent.
Abraham was away when Bernard McKey came to Redleaf. For more than twelve months this terrible
something had been working its power into my soul. Yet we were not lovers,"--and Miss Axtell
made the pronunciamiento as if she held the race mentioned in utmost veneration. "Day by day
brought to me new reasons why Bernard McKey must be unto me only a medical student in Doctor
Percival's office, and the stars sealed all that the day had done; whilst no night of sky was
without a wandering comet, whereon was inscribed, in letters that flashed every way, the sentence
that came with the lightning-stroke; even storms drowned it not; winter's cold did not freeze
it. Verily, little friend, I know that God had put it into Creation for me, and yet there seemed
His own law written against it"; and Miss Axtell's tones grew very soft and tremulously low,
as she said,--

"Mr. McKey had faults that could not, existing in action, make any woman happy: do you think
happiness was meant for woman?"

She waited my answer in the same way that she had done when she was ill and asked if I liked
bitters concealed. She waited as long without reply. The pause grew oppressive, and I spanned
it by an assurance of individual possessive happiness.

"Anemones never know which way the wind blows, until it comes down close to the ground," she
said; "but souls which are on bleak mountain-summits must watch whirlwinds, poised in space,
and note their airy march. So I saw, clearly cut into the rock of the future, my own face,
with all the lines and carvings wrought into it that the life of Bernard McKey would chisel
out, and I only waited. I might have waited on forever, for Mr. McKey had not cast one pebbly
word that must send up wavy ripples from deep spirit-waters; he only wandered, as any other
might have done, upon the shore of my life, along its quiet, dewy sands, above its chalk-cliffs,
and by the side of its green, sloping shores. He never questioned why rose and fell the waves;
he never went down where 'tide, the moon-slave, sleeps,' to find the foundations of my heart's
mainland. I had only seen him standing at times, as one sees a person upon a ship's deck, peering
off over Earth's blue ocean-cheek, simply in mute, solemn wonder at what may be beyond, without
one wish to speed the ship on.

"It might have been forever thus, but Abraham came home. He is my brother, you know. If he
made me suffer, he has been made to suffer with me. Bernard McKey was Doctor Percival's favorite.
He made him his friend, and was everything to him that friend could be. I cannot tell you my
story without mention of my brother, he has been so woven into every part of it. An unaccountable
fancy for the study of medicine developed itself in his erratic nature soon after he came home;
and he relinquished his brilliant prospects and devoted himself to the little white office
near Doctor Percival's house, with Bernard McKey for his hourly companion. The two had scarce
a thought in common: one was impulsive, prone to throw himself on the stream of circumstance,
to waft with the wind, and blossom with the spring; the other was the great mountain-pine,
distilling the same aroma in all atmospheres, extending fibrous roots against Nature's granite,
whenceever it comes up. How could the two harmonize? They could not, and a time of trial came.
We knew, before it came, why Doctor Percival's little white office held Abraham so many hours
in the day. It was because the Mountain-Pine found in the moss of Redleaf the sweet Trailing-Arbutus."

She asked me if I knew the flower; and when I answered her with my words of love of it, she
said, "she had always thought it was one of Eden's own bits of blossomry, that, missing man
from the hallowed grounds, crept out to know his fate, and, finding him so forlornly unblest,
had sacrificed its emerald leaves, left in the Garden, and, creeping into mosses, lived, waiting
for man's redemption. We used to call Mary 'The Arbutus,' and it was pleasant to see the great
rough branches of Abraham's nature drooping down, more and more, toward the pink-and-white
pale flower that looked into the sky, from a level as lofty as the Pine's highest crown. Abraham
goes out to search for the type of Mary every spring"; and rising, she brought to me the waxen
buds that were yet unopened.

I took them in my hands, with the same feeling that I would have done a tress of Mary's hair,
or a fragment that she had handled. I think Miss Axtell divined this feeling; for she cautiously
opened the door leading into her brother's room, and finding that he was not there, she bade
me "come and see." It was Mary's portrait that once more I looked upon; framed in a wreath
of the trailing-arbutus, it was hanging just where he could look at it at night, as I my strange
tower-key.

We went back. Miss Axtell closed the sash; she was looking weary and pale. I was afraid she
would suffer harm from the continued recital. She said "No," to my fear,--that "it must all
be spoken now, once, and that forever,"--and I listened unto the story's end.

"One year had passed since Alice's death before Abraham's coming. Another had almost fled before
the eventful time when I began to feel the weight of my cross. I know not how it came to Abraham's
knowledge that Bernard McKey felt in his soul my presence. I only know that he came home one
night, with a storm of rage whitening his lips and furrowing his forehead. He came up here,
where I was sitting. I had watched his figure coming through tree-openings from Doctor Percival's
house, and mingled with the memories of the fair young girl whom I had seen dead by lightning
were fears for Mary Percival. For several days she had been ill, and I knew that Abraham felt
anxious; therefore I did not wonder at his hasty coming in and instant seeking of me. He came
quite close. He wound his face in between me and the darkening sky; he whispered hoarsely,--

"'Do you care for him?'

"'What is it, Abraham?' I asked, startled by his words and manner, but with not the faintest
idea of the meaning entering in with his words.

"'Bernard McKey, is he anything to you?'

"'You've no right to question me thus,' I said.

"'And you will not answer me?'

"'I will not, Abraham.'

"The next morning Abraham was gone. He had not told me of his intended absence. He had only
left a note, stating the time of his return.

"It was a week ere he came. Mary had not improved in his absence, yet no one deemed her very ill.

"I dreaded Abraham's coming home, because he had left me in silent anger; but how could I have
replied to his question otherwise than I did? No one, not Mr. McKey himself, had asked me;
and should I give him, my brother, my answer first?

"Lazily the village-clock swung out the hours that summer's afternoon. The stroke of three
awakened me. I had not seen Mary that day.

"'I would go and see her,' I decided.

"'She was sleeping, the dear child,' Chloe said. 'She would come and tell me when she was awake,
if I would wait.'

"I said that I would stay awhile, and I wandered out under the shade of the great whispering
trees, to wait the waking hour.

"I remember the events of that afternoon, as Mary and Martha must have remembered the day on
which Lazarus came up from the grave unto them.

"The air was still, save a humming in the very tree-tops that must have been only echoes tangled
there, breezes that once blew past. The long grape-arbor at the end of the lawn looked viny
and cool. I walked up and down under the green archway, until Chloe's words summoned me.

"Mary was 'better,' she said; 'a few days, and she should feel quite strong, she hoped'; but
she looked weary, and I only waited a little while, until her father and mother came in, and
then I went.

"Mr. McKey was sitting in the door of the little white office. He came out to meet me ere I
had reached the street,--asked if I was on my way home.

"I said 'Yes,' with the lazy sort of languor born of the indolence of the hour.

"'Have you energy enough for a walk to the sea-shore?' he asked.

"It had been my wish that very day. I had not been there since Mary's illness. I hesitated
in giving an answer. Abraham would be home at sunset.

"'Don't go, if it is only to please me,' he said.

"'I am going to please myself,' I answered; 'only I wish to be at home on Abraham's coming.'

"That afternoon, Bernard McKey for the first time told me of himself, and what the two years
in Redleaf had done for him. One month more, and he should leave it. He put into words the
memory of that first look across the dead. He talked to me, until the sea lost its sunlight
sheen,--until I no longer heard its beat of incoming tide,--until I forgot the hour for Abraham's
coming. It was he who reminded me of it. Once more we paced the sands, already sown with our
many footsteps, that the advancing waters would soon overwhelm. After that we went village-ward.
The gloaming had come down when we reached home.

"'Abraham must have been an hour here,' I thought, as alone I went in.

"He met me in the hall.

"'Where have you been, Lettie?' was his greeting.

"'On the sands.'

"'Not alone?'

"'No, Abraham; Bernard McKey has been with me.'

"'By what right?' he demanded, with that mighty power of voice that is laid up within him for
especial occasions.

"'By the right that I gave him, by the right that is his to walk with me,' I said; for I grew
defiant, and felt a renewal of strength, enough to tell Abraham the truth.

"Don't start so, Anemone," she said to me. "You think defiance unwomanly, and so do I; but
it was for once only, and I felt that my brother had no right to question me.

"But one word came from his lips, as he confronted me there, with folded arms; it was,--

"'When?'

"'This very afternoon, Abraham.'

"Mother came out at the moment. She saw the cloud on Abraham's brow even in the dim light.
She asked, 'What is it?' and Abraham answered us both at the same time.

"He had been to the home of Bernard McKey. He proved to my mother's utmost satisfaction that
her daughter had no right to care for one like Bernard McKey. He did not know the right that
came on that night almost two years before. He saw that his proofs were idle to me; but he
said 'he had another, one that I would accept, for I was an Axtell.'

"'Yes, Abraham, I am an Axtell, and I shall prove my right to the name, come what will'; and
without waiting to hear more, I glided into the darkness up-stairs.

"For a long time I heard mother and Abraham talking together; it seemed as if they would never
cease. At last, mother sent up to know if I was not coming to take my tea. I had forgotten
its absence till then. I went down. A half-hour later, during which time a momentous mist of
silence hung over the house, I heard steps approaching. You know that it was summer time, and
the windows were all thrown open, after the heat of the day. I had been wondering where every
one was gone. I recognized both of the comers, as their footsteps fell upon the walk, but I
heard no words. Oh, would there had been none to come! I heard Abraham go on up the stairs,
and knew that he was searching for me. I knew who had come in with him, and I arose from my
concealment in the unlighted library, and went into the parlor. It was Mr. McKey who sat there.

"'What is it?' I asked,--for a gnome of ill was walking up and down in my brain, as we had
walked on the sands so few hours before.

"'What is it? I don't know,' he said. 'Your brother asked me to come over for a few minutes.'

"Evidently Abraham had not shown him one coal of the fire that burned under his cool seeming.
That is the way with these mountain pine-trees: one never knows how deep into volcanic fires
their roots are plunged.

"'Something has happened,' I whispered. 'Whatever comes, bear it bravely.'

"He laughed, a low, rippling laugh, like the breaking up of ever so many songs all at once;
and the notes had not floated down to rest, when mother and Abraham came in. Mr. McKey arose
to greet my mother. She stood proudly erect, her regal head unbending, her eyes straight on,
into an endless future, in which he must have no part,--that I saw. Whatever he discerned there,
he, too, stood before her and my brother. Abraham handed me a letter, saying, 'Read that, for
your proof.'

"And I read. The letter bore the signature of Bernard McKey. The date was the night of Alice's
death. The words descriptive of the scene chiselled into my brain were on that fair paper-surface;
and there were others, words which only one man may write to one woman. I read it on to the end.

"'You are right, Abraham,' I said, 'and I thank you for my proof'; and without one word for
the pale, handsome face that stood beseechingly between me and the great future, through which
I gazed, I went forth alone into the starry night. Anywhere, to be alone with God, leaving
that trio of souls in there; and as I fled past the windows, I heard my mother speak terrible
words to one that was, yes, even then, myself. Some angel must have come down the starry way
to guide me; for, without seeking it, without consciousness of whither I fled, I found myself
near the old church, where, from the day of my solemn baptism within its walls, I had gone
up to the weekly worship. I crept up close to the door. In the shadow there no one would see
me; and so, upon the hard stones, I writhed through the anguish of the fire and iceberg that
made war in my heart.

"Then came unto me the old inheritance, the gift of towering pride; and I said unto myself,
'No one shall think I sorrow; no one shall know that an Axtell has sipped from a poisoned cup;
no one shall see a leaf of myrtle in my garden of life'; and from off the friendly granite
steps that had received me in my hour of bitterness, I went back to my home.

"What, could have happened there, that I had not been missed? Father was absent from Redleaf.
Bernard McKey was coming down the walk. I hid in the shrubbery, and let him pass. Oh, would
that I had spoken to him, then, there! It would have saved so much misery on the round globe!

"But I did not. I stood breathless until he entered Doctor Percival's house; then I waited
a moment to determine my own course; I wanted to gain my room undiscovered. I saw the same
figure come out; I knew it by the light that the open door threw around it; and a moment later,
in the still air,--I knew the sound, it was the unlocking of the little white office. Then
I stole in, and fled to my refuge. No one had discovered my absence.

"The night went by. I did not sleep. I did not weep,--oh, no! it was not a case for tears;
there are some sorrows that cannot be counted out in drops; a flood comes, a great freshet
rises in the soul, and whirls spirit, mind, and body on, on, until the Mighty Hand comes down
and lifts the poor wreck out of the flood, and dries it in the sun of His absorption.

"It was morning at last. Slowly up the ascent, to heights of glory, walked the stars, waving
toward earth, as they went, their wafting of golden light, and sending messages of love to
the dark, round world, over which they had kept such solemn watch,--sending them down, borne
by rays of early morning; and still I sat beside the window, where all through the night I
had suffered. My mother and Abraham had sought to see me, but I had answered, with calm words,
that I chose to be alone; and they had left me there, and gone to their nightly rest."

Miss Axtell hid her face a little while; then, lifting it up, she went to the window so often
mentioned, beckoned me thither, pointed to the house where my life had commenced, to a door
opening out on the eastern side, and said,--

"I wish you to look at that door one moment; out of it came my doom that midsummer's morning.
Light had just gained ascendency over darkness, when I saw Chloe come out. I knew instantly
that something had happened there. The poor creature crept out of the house,--I saw her go,--and
kneeling down behind that great maple-tree, she lifted up her arms to heaven, and I heard,
or thought I heard her, moaning. Then, whilst I watched, she got up, looked over at our house,
from window to window; once more she raised her hands, as if invoking some power for help,
and went in.

"I brushed back the hair that my fingers had idly threaded in unrest, looked one moment, in
the dim twilight of morning, to see what changes my war-fare had wrought, then, cautiously,
breathlessly, for fear of awakening some one, I went out. The night-dew lay heavy on the lawn.
I heeded it not. I knew that trouble had come to Doctor Percival's house. I went to the door
that Chloe had opened. No one seemed awake; deep stillness brooded over and in the dwelling.
Could I have been mistaken? Whilst I stood in doubt whether to go or stay, there came a long,
sobbing moan, that peopled the dwelling with woe.

"It came from Mary's room. Thither I went. There stood Doctor and Mrs. Percival beside Mary,
and she--was dead.

"I shudder now, as I did then, though eighteen years have rolled their wheels of misery between,--shudder,
as I look in memory into that room again, and see your father standing in the awful grief that
has no voice, see your mother lifting up her words of moaning, up where I so late had watched
the feet of stars walking into heaven. I don't know how long it was, I had lost the noting
of time, but I remember growing into rigidness. I remember Bernard McKey's wild, wretched face
in the room; I remember hearing him ask if it was all over. I remember Abraham's coming in;
I felt, when through his life the east-wind went, withering it up within him. I do not know
how I went home. I asked no questions. Mary was dead; she had gone whither Alice went. It seemed
little consolation to me to ask when or how she died.

"Father came home that day. Mother forgot me for Abraham: love of him was her life. Father
did not know, no one had told him, the events of the night before; he thought me sorrowing
for Mary, and so I was; my grief seemed weak and small before this reality of sorrow.

"It was late in the day, and I was trying to get some sleep, when Chloe sent a request to see
me. I had not seen her since I knew why she had hid her suffering behind the tree in the morning.
I saw that she had something to say beside telling me of Mary; for she looked cautiously around
the room, as if fearing other ears might be there to hear.

"'Oh! oh! Miss Lettie,' she said, 'I stayed with Miss Mary last night. I must have gone to
sleep when she went away; but I'm afraid, I'm afraid it wasn't the sickness that killed her.'

"'What then? what was it, Chloe?' I asked, whilst the tears fell fast from her eyes.

"'Doctor Percival gave her some medicine just afore he went to bed, and she said she was "very
sick"; she said so a good many times, Miss Lettie, afore I went to sleep.'

"'You don't think it was the medicine that killed her?'--for a horrible thought had come in to me.

"'I hope not, but I'm afraid'; and with a still lower, whispering tone, and another frightened
look about the room, Chloe took from under her shawl a small cup. She held it up close to me,
and her voice penetrated with its meaning all the folds of my thought,--'Chloe's afraid Miss
Mary drank her death in here.'

"'Give it to me,' I said; and I snatched at the cup. Catching it from her, I looked into it.
The draught had been taken; the sediment only lay dried upon it.

"'You think so, Chloe? How could it have been? You say Doctor Percival gave it to her?'

"She said that 'Mr. Abraham had been in to see her a little while,--only a few moments. Something
was the matter with him. Miss Mary talked, just a few words; what they were she did not hear,--she
was in the next room,--only, when he went away, she heard her say, "Don't do it; you may be
wrong, and then you'll be sorry as long as you live"; and then Mr. Abraham shut the door heavy-like
and was gone. Afterwards Doctor Percival came up,--said Miss Mary must sleep, she had more
fever; asked her so many kind questions, and was just going down to go to the office for something
to give her, when he met Master McKey coming in. I heard my master ask him to go for it. And
I doesn't know anything more, Miss Lettie. I came to tell you.'

"I asked her 'if she had told any one else? if any one had seen the cup?'

"She said, 'No'; and I made her promise me that she would never mention it, never speak of
it to any living soul.

"She promised, and she has kept her promise faithfully to this day."

I thought, at this pause in the story, of Chloe's hiding chloroform from me.

"I had myself seen Bernard McKey go out to the office that night. Had he given poison to Mary
Percival? And with the question the hot answer came, 'Never!--he did not do it!'

"Chloe went, leaving the cup with me.

"I knew that I must see Bernard. How? The household were absorbed in Abraham. His condition
perilled his reason. Doctor Percival came over every hour to see him, and I was sure that his
hair whitened from time to time. It was terrible to hear Abraham declaring that he had killed
Mary,--that he might have granted her request. And as often as his eyes fell upon me, his words
changed to, 'It was for you that I did it,--for my sister!' And whilst all sorrowed and watched
him, I sought my opportunity. 'It would never come to me,' I thought, 'I must go to it'; and
under cover of looking upon the face of Mary, I went out to seek Bernard.

"We met before I reached the house; we should have passed in silence, had I not spoken. It
was the same hour as that in which we had come from the sands the night before. What a horrible
lifetime had intervened! I said that 'I had some words for him.' He stood still in the air
that throbbed in waves over me. He was speechlessly calm just then.

"'I expected no words after my judgment,' at length he said,--for I knew not how to open my
terrible theme; 'will you tell me on what evidence you judge?'

"What a trifle then seemed any merely human love in the presence of Death! I was almost angry
that he should once think of it.

"'It is something of more importance than the human affection with which you play,' I said.
'It is a life, the life of Mary Percival, that last night went out,--and how? Was it by this
cup?'--and I handed the cup to him.

"He looked simple amazement, as he would have done, had it been a rock or flower; he did not
offer to take it,--still I held it out.

"'Will you examine the contents,' I asked, 'and report to me the result?'

"'Certainly I will, Miss Axtell,' he said; and with it he walked to the office.

"I watched him through the window. I saw him coolly apply various tests. The third one seemed
satisfactory.

"He came to the door. I was very near, and went in

"'This is nothing Miss Mary had,--it is poison,' he said.

"He was innocent; I knew it in the very depth of my soul. How could I tell him the deed his
hand had done? But I must, and I did. I told him how Chloe had brought the cup to me. When
I had done, he said,--

"'You believe this of me?'

"I answered,--

"'The cup is now in your hand; judge you of its work'; and I told him how I had seen him come
out the night before,--that I was in the shrubbery when he went to the office.

"The words of his answer came; they were iron in my heart, though spoken not to me.

"'O my God, why hast Thou let me do this?' he cried, and went past me out of the little white
office,--out, as I had done, into the open air, in my sorrow, the night before.

"I would not lose sight of him; I followed on; and, as I went, I thought I heard a rustling
in the leaves. A momentary horror swept past me, lest some one had been watching,--listening,
perhaps,--but I did not pause. I must know how, where, Bernard would hide his misery. It was
not quite dark; I could not run through the night, as I had done before; I must follow on at
a respectable pace, stop to greet the village-people who were come out in the cool of the evening,
and all the while keep in view that figure, hastening, for what I knew not, but on to the sands,
whilst those whom I met stayed me to ask how Mary Percival died. I passed the last of the village-houses.
There was nothing before me now but Nature and this unhappy soul. I lost sight of him; I came
to the sands; I saw only long, low flats stretching far out,--beyond them the line of foam.
The moon was not yet gone; but its crescent momently lessened its light. I went up and down
the shore two or three times, going on a little farther each time, meeting nothing,--nothing
but the fear that stood on the sands before me, whichever way I turned. It bent down from the
sky to tell me of its presence; it came surging up behind me; and one awful word was on its
face and in its voice. I remember shutting my eyes to keep it out; I remember putting my fingers
into my ears to still its voice. I was so helpless, so alone to do, so threadless of action,
that--I prayed.

"People pray in this world from so many causes,--it matters not what or how; the hour for prayer
comes into every life at some time of its earthly course, whether softly falling and refreshing
as the early rain, or by the north-wind's icy path. Mine came then, on the sands; my spirit
went out of my mortality unto God for help,--solely because that which I wanted was not in
me, not in all the earth.

"I stooped down to see if the figure I sought was outlined on the rim of sky that brightened
at the sea's edge: it was not there, not seaward. I tried to call: the air refused the weight
of my voice; it went no farther than the lips, out of which it quivered and fell: I could not
call. I took the dark tide-mark for my guide, and began searching landward. I went a little
way, then stopped to look and listen: no sight, no sound. The long sedge-grass gave rustling
sighs of motion, as I passed near, and disturbed the air for a moment. A night-bird uttered
its cry out of the tall reeds. The moon went down. The tide began to come in; with it came
up the wind. The memory of Alice, of Mary, walked with and did not leave me, until I gained
the little cove wherein Mary's boat lay secure. The tide had not reached it. Mary's boat! I
remember thinking--a mere drop of thought it was, as I hurried on, but it held all the animalcules
of emotion that round out a lifetime--that Mary never more would come to unloose the bound
boat, never more in it go forth to meet the joys that wander in from unknown shores. I saw
the boat lying dark along the water's edge. 'I would run down a moment,' I thought, 'run down
to speak a word of comfort, as if it were a living thing.'

"Mary's boat was not alone; it had a companion. I thought it was Bernard. I drew near and spoke
his name. Doctor Percival answered me. I do not think that he recognized my voice. He turned
around with a startled movement, for I was quite close, and asked, 'Who is it?'

"I did not answer. I turned and fled away into the darkness, across the sands, that answer
no footsteps with echoes. It was a comfort to feel that he was out there, between me and the
boundless space of sea.

"When I draw near the confines of Hereafter's shore, I think I shall feel the same kind of
comfort, if some soul that I knew has gone out just before me; it will cape the boundary-line
of 'all-aloneness.'"

Miss Axtell must have forgotten that she was talking to me, as she retraced her steps and thoughts
of that night, for, with this thought, she seemed to "wander out into silence."

Katie brought her back by coming up to say that "Mr. Abraham was waiting to know if she would
go out a little while, it was so fine."

Miss Axtell said that "she would not go,--she would wait."

Katie went to carry the message. Miss Axtell wandered a little. Between her words and memories
I picked up the thread for her, and she went on before me.

"I took the direction of the village-pier, when I fled from Doctor Percival. An unusual number
of boats had come in. I heard noises amid the shipping. At any other time I should have avoided
the place. Now I drew near.

"Two men were slowly walking down the way. I heard one of them ask, 'Do you know who it is?'

"The other replied, 'No, I never saw him before; we had better watch him; he went on in a desperate
way. I've seen it before, and it ended in'----

"He did not finish, although I was thirsting for the words; they both seemed arrested suddenly,
then started on, and I watched whither they went.

"There was now no light, save that of the stars. I could scarcely keep them in sight. I went
nearer,--hid myself behind one of the posts on the pier. They had gone upon one of the boats,--that
which lay farthest down the stream. It was Bernard that they watched. I found him with my eyes
before they reached where he stood. A boy came singing from his daily work; he passed close
beside me, and, as he went, he beat upon the post with a boat's oar. I waited until I could
come from my hiding-place without his seeing; then I went after him. I sent him for 'the gentleman
that had gone down there,' telling him to say that 'a lady wished to see him.'

"Bernard came. I told him that I had been searching for him on the sands,--that I wanted to
talk to him; and he and I walked on again, village-ward, as we had done on the last night.
It was very hard to begin, to open the cruel theme,--to say to this person, who walked with
folded arms, and eyes that I knew had no external sight, what I thought; but I must. When I
had said all that I would have said to any other human soul, under like darkness, he lighted
up the night of his sin with strange fires. He poured upon his family's past the light hereditary.
Abraham had been true in his statements. Bernard McKey was not well-born. He told me this:
that his father had been a destroyer of life; that God had been his Judge, and had now set
the seal of the father's sin into the son's heart. Oh, it was fearful, this tide of agony with
which that soul was overwhelmed! He pictured his deed. Abraham had found out the crime of his
father, had cruelly sent it home on his own head, had said that a murderer's son could never
find rest in the family of Axtell, had sent him forth, with hatred in his heart, to work out
in shadow the very deed his father had wrought in substance, to destroy Mary Percival, the
child of his best friend, and to strike from off the earth Abraham's arch of light. It was
wonderful: a chance, a change, had killed Mary.

"Doctor Percival had that very afternoon, while we were gone, wrought changes in the little
white office; hence the fatal mistake. Bernard had gone in, taken up a bottle from the very
place where the article wanted had stood for two years, poured its contents into the cup, carried
it in, and no hand stayed him. He was too blinded by suffering to see for himself. Doctor Percival's
hand gave the draught, and Mary was dead. What should be done?

"'What shall I do? What would you have me to do?' asked Bernard.

"We were come to the church on our way. I stayed my steps, and thought of the letter that Abraham
had given me; it came up for the first time since I knew of Mary's death. But I did not allude
to it. I could not acknowledge, even to him, that I knew another had received the words that
should have been spoken only to me; and sincerely I told him that he must go away, at once
and for always,--that the deed his hand had unknowingly done must be borne in swift, solemn
current through his life,--that he must live beside it until it reached the ocean to come:
it could do no good to reveal it; it could arouse only new misery; it seemed better that it
should be written on marble and in memory that 'God took her.'

"He took up the silence that came after my words, and filled it with an echoing question:--

"'If I go out, and bear this deed, as you say bear it, in silence and in suffering, will you,--you,
to whom God has given a good inheritance, who know not the rush and roar of any evil in your
soul, whose spring rises far back in ancestral natures,--will you stand between me and all
this that I must bear? Will you be my rock, set here, in this village? May I come back at times,
and tell you how I endure? If you will promise me this, I will go.'

"Why should he come to me? why not to the other one, to whom he told of Alice's death two years
ago? He did not know that pride was the ever vernal sin of my race, that I had it to battle
with. But I conquered, and promised I would help him, since it was all I had to do. A few more
words were spoken; he was to write to me when he would come; and we parted, there, at the old
church-door,--he promising to live, to try and make atonement for his sin,--I to hold his deed
in keeping, alone of all the world, save Chloe, and in her I had trust. I did not see him again:
he left the following day.

"You remember that I heard a rustling in the shrubbery, when Bernard fled from the office.
It was my mother, watching me. She had seen and heard sufficient to convince her of what had
been done. Mothers are endowed with wonderful intuitive perception. Abraham had been her one
love from his childhood. Now came a strife in her nature. Bernard McKey had wronged Abraham,
had taken the light out of his life, and a great longing for his punishment came up. How should
it be effected? She believed that open judgment would awaken resistance in me,--that I would
stand beside him then, in the face of all the world, and recompense him for his punishment,--I,
an Axtell, her daughter. So she came to me with a compromise. She told me that she had heard
what had been said,--that she knew the deed, had seen the cup,--that Abraham, knowing the act,
would never forgive it, though done, as she acknowledged, in error; and she, my mother, to
save the family, made conditions. Her knowledge should remain hers only, if Bernard McKey should
remain such as he now was to me,--never to be more.

"'An easy condition,' I thought, 'since the letter Abraham gave'; and I said the two words
to my mother,--

"'I promise.'

"'My daughter,' was her only answer; and she touched her child's forehead with two burning
lips, and went away to watch Abraham through the night,--watch him tread the dark way, without
Mary.

"Where now was the Mountain-Pine? higher than the Arbutus?

"Our mother had her trial. When she heard Abraham reproaching himself with having brought on
a return of fever by refusing Mary's wish, of having been the means of her death, I know her
heart ached to say, 'It was not you, Abraham, it was Bernard McKey who killed her.' But no,
she did not; family pride towered above affection, and she was true to her promise, true to
the last. She died with the secret hers.

"Bernard McKey's absence was much wondered at, although it began only one month earlier than
the appointed time. Doctor Percival mourned his going as if he had been his son; he spoke to
me of it. Mary was buried. I remember your little face on her burial-day; it was bright, and
unconscious of the sad scene"; and Miss Axtell now sought to look into it, but it was not to
be seen. I think she must have forgotten, at times, that it was to Mary's sister that she was
telling her story. She waited a little, until I asked her to "tell me more."

"The face of that Autumn grew rosy, wrinkled, and died upon Winter's snowy bed; and yet I lived,
and Abraham, and Bernard McKey perhaps,--I knew not. The year was nearly gone since Mary died,
and no ray of knowledge had come from him. Every day I re-read those words written to some
fair woman-soul, until after so many readings they began to take root in my heart. I found
it out one day, and I began vigorously to tear them up. It was on the evening of the same day
that Abraham came home: he had been away for several weeks. He left, with intentional seeming,
a paper where I should see it; he had read with almost careless eyes what mine fell upon, for
he believed that Bernard McKey was forgotten by me; he had kindly forborne to mention his name,
since that one night wherein all our misery grew. I found there what I believed to be his death:
the name and age were his own; the place was nothing,--he might be anywhere. My mother saw
it, and a gladness, yes, a gladness came into her face: I watched its coming up. She thought
she might now tell Abraham; but no, I held her to the promise. It had but two conditions: mine
was to be perpetual; hers must be so.

"After that I grew pitiful for the poor heart that must have been made sorrowful by these words
that never more would come into it, and so I picked up the trembling little roots that had
been cast out, put them back into the warm soil, and let them grow: they might join hers now,
for together they could twine around immortal bowers; and, as they grew, a great longing came
up to go out and find this woman-soul who had drawn out such words from lips sealed forever.
But no chance happened: no one came to our quiet village from the remote town in which she
was when these words, that now were become mine, were penned." He was going to Boston in charge
of the lamented Dr. Revere's body. That is about the programme.

A cottage of squared logs, filled in with plaster, and white-washed. It is not a breeding-place
of ideas, which makes it a more agreeable residence for average people.

WAITING.

  Drop, falling fruits and crispèd leaves!
  Ye tone a note of joy to me;
  Through the rough wind my soul sails free,
  nigh over waves that Autumn heaves.

  Such quickening is in Nature's death,
  Such life in every dying day,--
  The glowing year hath lost her sway,
  Since Freedom waits her parting breath.

  I watch the crimson maple-boughs,
  I know by heart each burning leaf,
  Yet would that like a barren reef
  Stripped to the breeze those arms uprose!

  Under the flowers my soldier lies!
  But come, thou chilling pall of snow,
  Lest he should hear who sleeps below
  The yet unended captive cries!

  Fade swiftly, then, thou lingering year!
  Test with the storms our eager powers;
  For chains are broken with the hours,
  And Freedom walks upon thy bier.

REVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES.

Eyes and Ears. By HENRY WARD BEECHER. Boston: Ticknor & Fields, pp. 419.

There is perhaps no man in America more widely known, more deeply loved, and more heartily
hated than the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher. This little book, fragmentary and desultory as
it is, gives us a key wherewith to unlock the mystery both of the extent of his influence and
the depth of the feelings which he excites. It is but a shower of petals flung down by a frolicsome
May breeze; but the beauty and brilliancy of their careless profusion furnish a hint of the
real strength and substance and fruitfulness of the tree from which they sprang.

Within the compass of some four hundred pages we have about one hundred articles, most of which
had previously appeared in weekly newspapers. They embrace, of course, every variety of subject,--grave
and gay, practical and poetical. They are not such themes as come to a man in silence and solitude,
to be wrought out with deep and deliberate conscientiousness; they are rather such as He around
one in his outgoing and his incoming, in the field and by the way-side, overlooked by the preoccupied
multitude, but abundantly patent to the few who will not permit the memories or the hopes of
life to thrust away its actualities, and, once pointed out, full of interest and amusement
even to the absorbed and hitherto unconscious throngs. We have here no pale-browed, far-sighted
philosopher, but a ruddy-faced, high-spirited man, cheerful-tempered, yet not equilibrious,
susceptible to annoyance, capable of wrathful outbursts, with eyes to see all sweet sights,
ears to hear all sweet sounds, and lips to sing their loveliness to others, and also with eyes
and ears and lips just as keen to distinguish and just as hold to denounce the sights and sounds
that are unlovely;--and this man, with his ringing laugh and his springing step, walks cheerily
to and fro in his daily work, striking the rocks here and there by the way-side with his bright
steel hammer, eliciting a shower of sparks from each, and then on to the next. It is not the
serious business of his life, but its casual and almost careless experiments. He does not wait
to watch effects. You may gather up the brushwood and build yourself a fire, if you like. His
part of the affair is but a touch and go,-- partly for love and partly for fun.

There are places where a severer taste, or perhaps only a more careful revision, would have
changed somewhat. At times an exuberance of spirits carries him to the very verge of coarseness,
but this is rare and exceptional. The fabric may be slightly ravelled at the ends and slightly
rough at the selvedge, but in the main it is fine and smooth and lustrous as well as strong.
A coarse nature carefully clipped and sheared and fashioned down to the commonplace of conventionality
will often exhibit a negative refinement, while a mind of real and subtile delicacy, but of
rugged and irrepressible individuality, will occasionally shoot out irregular and uncouth branches.
Yet between the symmetry of the one and the spontaneity of the other the choice cannot be doubtful.
We are not defending coarseness in any guise. It is always to be assailed, and never to be
defended. It is always a detriment, and never an ornament. No excellence can justify it. No
occasion can palliate it. But coarseness is of two kinds,--one of the surface, and one in the
grain. The latter is pervading and irremediable. It touches nothing which it does not deface.
It makes all things common and unclean. It grows more repulsive as the roundness of youth falls
away and leaves its harsh features more sharply outlined. But the other coarseness is only
the overgrowth of excellence,--the rankness of lusty life. It is vigor run wild. It is a fault,
but it is local and temporal. Culture corrects it. As the mind matures, as experience accumulates,
as the vision enlarges, the coarseness disappears, and the rich and healthful juices nourish
instead a playful and cheerful serenity that illumines strength with a softened light, that
disarms opposition and delights sympathy, that shines without dazzling and attracts without
offending.

Here arises a fear lest the apologetic nature of our remarks may seem to indicate a much greater
need of apology than actually exists. We have been led into this line of remark, not so much
by a perusal of the book under consideration, in which, indeed, there is very little, if anything,
to offend, as by the nature of the objections which we have most frequently heard against this
author's productions, both written and spoken. We do not even confine ourselves to defence,
but go farther, and question whether the allegations of coarseness may not oftener be the fault
of the plaintiff than of the defendant. Is there not a conventional standard of refinement
which measures things by its own arbitrary self, and finds material for displeasure in what
is really but a sincere and almost unconscious rendering of things as they exist? There are
facts which modern fastidiousness justly enough commands to he wrapped around with graceful
drapery before they shall have audience. But do we not commit a trespass against virtue, when
we demand the same soft disguises to drape facts whose disguise is the worst immorality, whose
naked hideousness is the only decency, which must be seen disgusting to warrant their being
seen at all? So Mr. Beecher has been censured for irreverence, when what was called his irreverence
has seemed to us but the tenderness engendered of close connection. Cannot one live so near
to God as that His greatness shall he merged in His goodness? What would be irreverence, if
it came from the head, may be but love springing up warm from the heart.

One of the strongest characteristics of Mr. Beecher's mind, the one that has, perhaps, the
strongest influence in producing his power over men, is his quick insight into common things,
his quick sympathy with common minds. He knows common dangers. He understands common interests.
He is sensitive to common sorrows. He appreciates common joys. Without necessarily being practical
himself, he is full of practical suggestions. He is a leveller; but he levels up, not down.
He continually seeks to lift men from the plane of mere toil and thrift to the loftier levels
of aspiration. He would disinthrall them from what is low, and introduce them to the freedom
of the heights. He would bring them out of the dungeons of the senses into the domains of taste
and principles. He believes in man, and he battles for men. With him, humanity is chief: science,
art, wealth are its handmaidens. Yet, writing for ordinary people, he never falls into the
sin of declaiming against extraordinary ones. No part of his power over the poor is obtained
by inveighing against the rich, as no part of his power over the rich is obtained by pandering
to their prejudices or their passions. He builds up no influence for himself on the ruins of
another man's influence. The elevation which he aims to produce is real, not factitious,--absolute,
not relative. It is the elevation to be obtained by ascending the mountain, not by digging
it away so that the valley seems no longer low by contrast.

For the manner of his teaching, he is not always gentle, but he is always sincere. He speaks
soft words to persuade; but if that is not enough, he does not scruple to knock the muck-rake
out of sordid hands with a fine, sudden stroke, if so he may make men look up from the rubbish
under their feet to the flowers that bloom around them and the stars that glow above and the
God that reigns over all.

Thinking of the multitudes of hard-working, weary-hearted people whom he weekly met with these
words of cheer: sometimes homely advice on homely things; sometimes wise counsels in art; sometimes
tender lessons from Nature; sometimes noble words from his own earnest soul; sometimes sympathy
in sorrow; sometimes strength in weakness; sometimes only the indirect, but real help that
comes from the mere distraction wrought by his sportiveness, and wild, winsome mirth; but all
kindly, hearty, honest, sympathetic,--indignation softening, even while it surges, into pity
and love, and itself finding or framing excuses for the very outrage which it lashes: thinking
of this, we do not marvel that he has furrowed for himself so deep a groove in so many hearts.
Nor, on the other hand, is it difficult to see, even from so genial a book as this, whence
polemics are not so much banished as where there is no niche for them, should they apply, why
it is that he is so fiercely opposed. When a man like Mr. Beecher encounters that which excites
his moral disapprobation, there is no possibility of mistaking him. He flings himself against
it with all the strength and might of his manly, uncompromising nature. There is no coquetting
with the proprieties, no toning down of objurgation to meet the requirements of personal dignity,
but an audacious and aggressive repugnance of the whole man to the meanness or malignity. And
the very clearness of his vision gives terrible power to his vituperation. With his keen, bright
eye he sees just where the vulnerable spot is, and with his firm, strong hand he sends the
arrow in. The victim writhes and reels and--does not love the marksman. And as the victim has
a large circle of relatives by birth and marriage, he inoculates them with his own animosity;
and so, at a safe distance, Mr. Beecher is sometimes considerably torn in pieces. Yet we have
no doubt that by far the greater number of these opponents would, if once fairly brought within
the circle of his influence, acknowledge the truth as well as the force of his principles;
and certainly it is a matter of surprise that a man with such a magnificent mastery of all
the weapons of attack and defence should be so sparing and discreet in their use as is Mr.
Beecher. In this book, compiled of articles thrown off upon the spur of the moment, with so
much to amuse, to awaken, to suggest, and to inspire, there is hardly a sentence which can
arouse antagonism or inflict pain. You may not agree with his conclusions, but you cannot resist
his good nature.

Long may he live to do yeoman's service in the cause of the beautiful and the true!

History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France from A.D. 1807 to A.D. 1814.
By MAJOR-GENERAL SIR W.F.P. NAPIER, K.C.B., etc. In Five Volumes, with Portraits and Plans.
New York: W.J. Widdleton.

A new edition of the great military history of Sir William Napier, printed in the approved
luxurious style which the good examples of the Cambridge University Press have made a necessity
with all intelligent book-purchasers, calls at the present time for a special word of recognition.
Of the merits and character of the work itself it is scarcely required that we should speak.
An observer of, and participant in, the deeds which he describes, cautious, deliberate, keen-sighted,
candid, and unsparing, General Napier's book has qualities seldom united in a single production.
Southey wrote an eloquent history of the War in the Peninsula, perhaps as good a history as
an author well-trained in compositions of the kind could be expected to produce at a distance.
But that was its defect. It lacked that knowledge and judgment of a complicated series of events
which could be acquired only on the field and by one possessed of consummate military training.
On the other hand, we can seldom look for any laborious work of authorship from a general in
active service. Men of action exhaust their energies in doing, and are usually impatient of
the slow process of unwinding the tangled skein of events which at the moment they had been
compelled to cut with the sword. It is by no means every campaign which furnishes the Commentaries
of its Caesar. To Sir William Napier, however, we are indebted for a work which has taken its
place as a model history of modern campaigning. The protracted struggle of the Peninsular War
through six full years of skilful operations, conducted by the greatest masters of military
science, in a country whose topographical features called out the rarest resources of the art
of war, at a time when the military system of Napoleon was at its height, summing up the experience
of a quarter of a century in France of active military pursuits,--the story of sieges, marches,
countermarches, lines of retreat and defence, followed by the most energetic assaults, blended
with the disturbing political elements of the day at home and the contrarieties of the battle-field
amidst a population foreign to both armies,--certainly presented a subject or series of subjects
calculated to tax the powers of a conscientious writer to the uttermost. To furnish such a
narrative was the work undertaken by General Napier. Sixteen years of unintermitted toil were
given by him to the task. He spared no labor of research. Materials were placed at his disposal
by the generals of both armies, by Soult and Wellington. The correspondence left behind in
Spain by Joseph Bonaparte, written in three languages and partly in cipher of which the key
had to be discovered, was patiently arranged, translated, and at length deciphered by Lady
Napier, who also greatly assisted her husband in copying his manuscript, which, from the frequent
changes made, was in effect transcribed three times. By such labors was the immense mass of
contemporary evidence brought into order, clearly narrated, and submitted to exact scientific
criticism. For it is the distinguishing characteristic of the book, that it is a critical history,
constantly illuminating facts by principles and deducing the most important maxims of political
and military science from the abundant material lavishly contributed by the virtues, follies,
and superabundant exertions of three great nations in the heart of Europe, in the midst of
the complex civilization of the nineteenth century. The ever earnest, animated style in which
all this is written grows out of the subject and is supported by it, always rising naturally
with the requirements of the occasion. If our officers in the field would learn how despatches
should be written and a record of their exploits be prepared to catch the ear of posterity,
let them give their leisure hours of the camp to the study of Napier. The public also may learn
many lessons of patience and philosophy from these pages, when they turn from the book to the
actual warfare writing its ineffaceable characters on so many fair fields of our own land.

The Patience of Hope. By the Author of "A Present Heaven." With an Introduction by JOHN G.
WHITTIER. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.

As the method by which an individual soul reaches conclusions with regard to the Saviour and
the conditions of salvation, "The Patience of Hope" is worthy of particular attention. It does
not, however, stand alone, but belongs to a class. Its peculiarity is that it proceeds by apposite
text and inference, more than by the illumination of feeling,--aiming to convince rather than
to reveal, as is the manner of those whose convictions have not quite become as a star in a
firmament where neither eclipse nor cloud ever comes. Evidently there was a most searching
examination of the Scriptures preparatory to the work; and yet the ample quotation, often fresh
and felicitous, appears to be made to sustain a preconceived opinion, or, more strictly, an
emotion. This emotion is so single and absorbing that there is some gleam of it in each varying
view, and every sentiment is warm with it, however the flame may lurk as beneath a crust of
lava. Only from a richly gifted mind, and a heart whose longings no fullness of mortal affection
has power to permanently appease, could these aspirations issue. It is the tender complaint
and patient hope of one whom the earth, and all that is therein, cannot satisfy. Moreover,
so pure and irrepressible is the natural desire of the heart, so does it color and constitute
all the dream of Paradise, that the divinest Hope not only thrills and palpitates with Love's
ripest imaginings, but puts on nuptial robes. Touchingly she pictures herself as "The Mystic
Spouse,--her that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon the arm of her Beloved,--and
we shall see that she, like her Lord, is wounded in her heart, her hands, and her feet." Though
sowing in such still remembered pain, she yet reaps with unspeakable joy. She has now the full
assurance that the mystic and immortal embrace is for her, and in the fulness of her heart
cries, "When were Love's arms stretched so wide as upon the Cross?"

It is in keeping with such an aspiration that this and kindred natures should perceive in Christianity
the sacred mystery from which is to be drawn, in the world to come, the full fruition of the
tenderest and most vital impulse of the human heart, and therefore to be most fitly meditated
and vividly anticipated in cloistered seclusion. Throughout their revelations there is a yearning
for Infinite Love; and ardent receptivity is regarded as the true condition for the conception
and enjoyment of religion. It is clear that they have a passion, sublimated and glorified indeed,
but still a passion, for Christ. This is the mightiest impulse to that exaltation of His person
against which the calm and consummate reasoner contends in vain. Truly we are fearfully and
wonderfully made! The soul is touched with the strong necessity of loving; and its power becomes
intense and inappeasable in proportion to the capacity of the heart; and yet some of the greatest
of those have reposed so supremely in the innate and ineffable Ideal that to the uninitiated
they have seemed in their serenity as pulseless as pearls. Through this sublime influence lovely
women have become nuns, and have lived and died saints, that they might continually indulge
and constantly cherish the blissful hope of being, in some spiritual form, the brides of Jesus.
A long line of these, coeval with the Crucifixion, have passed on in maiden meditation, and
so were fancy-free from all of mortal mould. This ecstatic dreaming is so charming, and so
insatiable withal, that it seems to those who entertain it a divine vision. It is an enchantment
so complete that Reason cannot penetrate its circle, and Logic has never approached it. Doubtless
this fond aspiration finds freest and fairest expression in the Roman Church,--a communion
that not only encourages, but enjoins, the adoration of the Virgin, in order that certain enthusiasts
among men may also aspire to the skies on the wings of pure, yet passionate love.

The ready objection to this course of life is that it leads to solitude. It wins the devotee
apart, and away from the influences to that universal brotherhood whereto Philanthropy fondly
turns as the finest manifestation of the spirit of the Redeemer. And yet they are equally the
fruits of His coming. Without the perfect Man the sublimest endurance and most marvellous aspiration
of Hope would never have found development below. Now it has become a power that so pervades
the bosoms of sects that they accept its soaring wing as one to which the heaven of heavens
is open. This, certainly, is the greatest triumph that human nature has achieved over those
who have systematically depreciated it; inasmuch as it is a heightening, not a change of heart.
Verily, Love is stronger than Death; and in its complete presence or utter absence, here or
hereafter, there is and will be the extreme of bliss or bale. Therefore it is in the affections
to lead those sweetly and swiftly heavenward who singly seek the immortal way. So guided and
inspired, it cannot but be a charming path; for those who perpetually walk therein come to
look as though they were entranced with the perfume that floats from fields of asphodel. Characters
so developed are beautiful exceedingly, and seem of a far higher strain than those who most
generously and effectively labor for the amelioration and moral advancement of the race. They,
more than any others who have riches there, illumine the grand, yet gloomy arches of the Christian
Church with their ineffable whiteness. No preacher therein is so eloquent as their marble silence;
for they reveal in their countenances the mystery of Redemption. Even while among the living,
men looked upon them with awe,--feeling, that, though coeval in time, infinite space rolled
between. They teach as no other order of teachers can, that the days and duties of life may
be so cast under foot as to exalt one to be only a little lower than the angels. In fine, through
them is made visible the value of the individual soul; and thus we see, as in the central idea
of our author, that "that which moulds itself from within is free."

Jenkins's Vest-Pocket Lexicon. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott & Co.

Compared with "Webster's Unabridged" or "Worcester's Quarto," this little pinch of words would
make "small show." It is, however, a very valuable pocket-companion; for, to use the author's
own phrase, it "omits what everybody knows, contains what everybody wants to know and cannot
readily find." It is really a vade-mecum, small, cheap, and useful to a degree no one can fully
appreciate until it has been thoroughly tried. Mr. Jabex Jenkins may claim younger-brotherhood
with the men who have done service in the important department of education he has chosen to enter.

A Practical Guide to the Study of the Diseases of the Eye; their Medical and Surgical Treatment.
By HENRY W. WILLIAMS, M.D. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 12mo. pp. 317.

If we readily accord our gratitude to those whose skilful hands and well-instructed judgment
render us physical service in our frequent need, ought we not to offer additional thanks to
such as by the high tribute of their mental efforts confirm and elucidate the more mechanical
processes required in doing their beneficent work?

Do those who enjoy unimpaired vision, and who have not yet experienced the sufferings arising
from any of the varied forms of ocular disease, appreciate the magnitude of the blessing vouchsafed
to them? We venture to answer in the negative.

Occasionally, the traveller by railway has a more or less severe hint as to what an inflamed
and painful eye may bring him to endure: those countless flying cinders which blacken his garments
and draw unsightly lines upon his face with their slender charcoal-pencils do not always leave
him thus comparatively unharmed. Suppose one unluckily reaches the eyeball just as the redness
has faded from its sharp angles,--do we not all know how the rest of that journey is one intolerable
agony, unless some fellow-traveller knows how to remove the offending substance? And even then
how the blistered, delicate surface yearns for a soothing douche of warm water,--perhaps not
to be enjoyed for hours!

From slighter troubles, through all the more serious and dangerous states arising from injury
or produced by spontaneous or specifically aroused inflammation, to the wonderful operations
devised to give sight, when the clear and beautiful lens has become clouded, or the delicate
muscular meshes of the iris are bound down or drawn together so as to close the pupil and shut
out the visible world, the learned and skilful operator comes to our aid, a veritable messenger
of mercy. To be deprived of sight,--who can fully appreciate this melancholy condition, save
those who have been in danger of such a fate, or have had actual experience of it, though only
temporarily? Such a misfortune is universally allowed to be worse, by far, than congenital
blindness. And this is not difficult to understand. The eyes that have been permitted to drink
in the varied hues of the landscape, and to gaze with such delight upon the celestial revelations
spread out nightly above and around them, are indeed in double darkness when all this power
and privilege are swept away, it may be forever. The astronomer can truly estimate the value
of healthy eyes.

In looking over again, after a thorough perusal some time since, the admirable work which forms
the theme of this notice, we could not resist the impulse to call attention to the infinite
uses, unbounded importance, and inestimable value of the organs of vision; and we have no fear
but our postulate in regard to the manner in which we should all prize their conservators will
be heartily acceded to.

This is hardly the place in which to enter into a minute professional examination of this new
volume. If we advert generally to its purpose, and point out the undoubted benefits its recommendations
and teaching are destined to confer, both upon those who are sufferers,--or who will be, unless
they heed its warnings,--and upon the practitioners who devote either an exclusive or a general
attention to the diseases of the eye, the end we have in view will be partially attained,--and
fully so, if the author's convincing instructions are brought into that universal adoption
which they not only eminently deserve, but must command. Let us hope that the clear style,
sensible advice, and valuable information, derived from so varied an experience as that which
has been enjoyed by our author, will have a wide and growing influence in the extensive field
of professional ministrations demanded by this class of cases,--for, let it be remembered,
and reverently be it written, "THE LIGHT OF THE BODY IS THE EYE."

The distinctive aim of the author--and which is kept constantly in view--is the simplifying
both of the classification and the treatment of the diseases of the eye. We know of no volume
which could more appropriately and beneficially be put into the hands of the medical student,
nor any which could meet a more appreciative welcome from the busy practitioner. The former
cannot, at the tender age of his professional life, digest the ponderous masses of ocular lore
which adorn the shelves of the maturer student's library; and the latter, while he is glad
to have these elaborate works at his command for reference, is refreshed by a perusal of a
few pages of the more unpretending, but not less valuable vade-mecum.

While the professional reader will peruse this book with pleasure as well as profit, there
are many points and paragraphs of great value to everybody. We advise every one to look over
these pages, and we promise that many valuable hints will be gained in reference to the various
ailments and casualties which are constantly befalling the eye. It is well in this world to
become members of a Mutual-Assistance Society, and help one another out of trouble as often
as we can. In order to do this, we must know how; and, in many cases, a little aid in mishaps
such as are likely to occur to the eye may prevent a vast deal of subsequent injury and pain.

We cannot but refer to the singular good sense of the author in pressing upon his reader's
attention the mischief so often wrought, hitherto,--and we fear still frequently brought about,--by
over-activity of treatment. Especially does this find its exemplification in the care of traumatic
injuries of the eye. Rashness and heroic measures in these cases are as unfortunate for the
patient as are the well-meant efforts of friends, when a foreign substance has been inserted
into the ear or nose, or a needle broken off in the flesh: what was at first an easily remedied
matter becomes exceedingly difficult, tedious, and painful, after various pokings, pushings,
and squeezings.

The author's experience in cases of cataract makes his observations upon that affection as
valuable as they are clear and to the purpose. The same is true with regard to the use and
abuse of spectacles.

A short account of that interesting and most important instrument, the Opthalmoscope, will
command the attention of the general reader.

Finally, we notice with peculiar satisfaction the elegant dress in which the volume appears.
A very marked feature of this is the agreeable tint given to the paper, so much to be preferred
to the glaring snowy white which has been so long the rule with publishers everywhere. This
is especially befitting a volume whose object is the alleviation of ocular distress, and we
venture to say will meet with the commendation of every reader. A similar shade was adopted,
some time since, by the publishers of "The Ophthalmic Hospital Reports," London, at the suggestion,
we think, of its accomplished editor, Mr. Streatfeild.

Country Living and Country Thinking. By GAIL HAMILTON. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 12mo.

Our impression of this volume is that it contains some of the most charming essays in American
literature. The authoress, who chooses to conceal her real name under the alias of "Gail Hamilton,"
is not only womanly, but a palpable individual among women. Both sex and individuality are
impressed on every page.

That the hook is written by a woman is apparent by a thousand signs. That it proceeds from
a distinct and peculiar personality, as well as from a fertile and vigorous intellect, is no
less apparent. The writer has evidently looked at life through her own eyes, and interpreted
it through her own experience. Her independence becomes at times a kind of humorous tartness,
and she finds fault most delightfully. So cant and pretence, however cunningly disguised by
accredited maxims and accredited sentimentality, can for a moment deceive her sharp insight
or her fresh sensibility. This primitive power and originality are not purchased by any sacrifice
of the knowledge derived at second-hand through books, for she is evidently a thoughtful and
appreciative student of the best literature; but they proceed from a nature so strong that
it cannot be overcome and submerged by the mental forces and food it assimilates.

Individuality implies will, and will always tends to wilfulness. The two are harmonized in
humor. Gail Hamilton is a humorist in her wilfulness, and flashes suggestive thought and wisdom
even in her most daring caprices and eccentricities of individual whim. She is wild in sentences,
heretical in paragraphs, thoroughly orthodox in essays. Her mind is really inclosed by the
most rigid maxims of Calvinistic theology, while, within that circle, it frisks and plays in
the oddest and wittiest freaks. A grave and religious earnestness is at the foundation of her
individuality, and she is so assured of this fact that she can safely indulge in wilful gibes
at pretension in all its most conventionally sacred forms. This bright audacity is the perfection
of moral and intellectual health. No morbid nature, however elevated in its sentiments, would
dare to hazard such keen and free remarks as Gail Hamilton scatters in careless profusion.

When this intellectual caprice approaches certain definite limits, it is edifying to witness
the forty-person power of ethics and eloquence she brings readily up to the rescue of the sentiments
she at first seemed bent on destroying. As her style throughout is that of brilliant, animated,
and cordial conversation, flexible to all the moods of the quick mind it so easily and aptly
expresses, the reader is somewhat puzzled at times to detect the natural logic which regulates
her transitions from gay to grave, from individual perceptions to general laws; but the geniality
and heartiness which flood the whole book with life and meaning soon reconcile him to the peculiar
processes of the intellect whose startling originality and freshness give him so much pleasure.

It would be unjust not to say that beneath all the fantastic play of her wit and humor there
is constantly discernible an earnest purpose. Sense and sagacity are everywhere visible. The
shrewdest judgments on ordinary life and character are as abundant as the quaint fancies with
which they are often connected. But in addition to all that charms and informs, the thoughtful
reader will find much that elevates and invigorates. A noble soul, contemptuous of everything
mean and base, loving everything grand and magnanimous, is the real life and inspiration of
the book.
