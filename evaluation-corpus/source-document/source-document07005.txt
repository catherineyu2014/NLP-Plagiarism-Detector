For the better understanding of some of the allusions of the preceding chapter, and of others
that may yet appear in different parts of our tale, as well, indeed, as for a better appreciation
of the whole, we will here turn aside from the thread of the narrative just commenced, to take
a brief retrospect of the leading events and circumstances with which the previous lives of
the several personages we have introduced had been connected, and among which their characters
had been shaped and their destinies determined.

Some twenty two or three years previous to the juncture we have been describing, Arthur and
Mark Elwood, by the fruits of their unremitting industry as laborers on a farm in summers,
and as pedlars of what they could best buy and sell in winters, added to the few hundred dollars
patrimony they each inherited, were enabled, in a few years, to realize the object of their
early ambition, in the opening of a small retail store, in one of the little outskirt villages
of northern New-Hampshire.

Such, like that of hundreds of others among us who now count their wealth by half millions,
was the slender beginning of these two brothers. And, although they were from the first, as
we have seen them at the last, as different in their general characters as they were in their
persons, they yet got on very well together; for, however they might disagree respecting the
modes and means of acquisition, they were always as one in regard to the great result each
alike had in view, and that was to make money and be rich. And, by a sort of tacit understanding,
falling into the departments of business best suited to their different tastes and capacities,
the quiet, cautious, calculating, and systematic Arthur confined himself to the store, kept
the books, contrived the ways and means, and, in short, did the principal head-work of the
establishment; while Mark, being of a more stirring turn, and, from his brisk bon homme manner
and less scrupulous disposition, better calculated for drumming up customers and securing bargains
for the store, did most of the outdoor business, riding about the country, contracting for
produce, securing barter deal, and making himself, in all things, the runner and trumpeter
of the company. At night they usually met together to compare notes and report progress; and
they were never happier than when they sat down in their small store-room, hemmed in and surrounded
by casks of nails, quintals of codfish, farming tools, etc., on one side, and narrow shelves
of cheap calicos, India cottons, and flaunting ribbons, on the other, and recounted to each
other the business and bargains of the day. Thus the two, working on, like the spring and balance-wheel
of some piece of mechanism, in harmony together, soon placed themselves beyond all fears of
failure, and seemed happy and contented with their situation and prospects.

This situation of affairs, however, was not destined to be of very long continuance. Not long
after finding themselves safely on the highway to independence, they very naturally began to
think of selecting, from among the fair young customers of their store, the ones who might
make them eligible companions for life. And, as the wayward love-fates would have it, they
both secretly fixed their affections on one and the same girl,--the pretty and sensible Alice
Gregg, who, though a plain farmer's daughter, was, to the vexation and envy of her numerous
rustic suitors, to be won by nothing short of one of the village merchants. Alice was not long
in discovering her advantage, nor in deciding to avail herself of it, so far as to confine
her election to one of these, her two undeclared lovers.
