CHARIVARIA.

An epidemic of measles is reported in the North. It seems that in these days of strikes people
are either coming out in sympathy or in spots.

* * *

The secret of industrial peace, says a sporting paper, is more entertainment for the masses.
We have often wondered what our workers do to while away the time between strikes.

* * *

"The cost of living for working-class families," says Mr. C.A. MCCURDY, the Food Controller,
"will probably increase by 9s. 6d. a week at Christmas." That is, of course, if Christmas ever
comes.

* * *

We understand that Dean INGE has been invited to meet the FOOD CONTROLLER, in order to defend
his title.

* * *

"Nobody wants a strike," says Mr. BRACE, M.P. We can only suppose therefore that they must
be doing it for the films.

* * *

An American artist who wanted to paint a storm at sea is reported to have been lashed to a
mast for four hours. We understand that he eventually broke away and did it after all.

* * *

"What is England's finance coming to?" asks a City editor in a contemporary. We can only say
it isn't coming to us.

* * *

In Petrograd the fare for half-an-hour's cab ride is equal to two hundred pounds in English
money at the old rate of exchange. Fortunately in London one could spend the best part of a
day in a taxi-cab for that amount.

* * *

"Before washing a flannel suit," says a home journal, "shake it and beat it severely with a
stick." Before doing this, however, it would be just as well to make sure that the whole of
the husband has been removed.

* * *

A lion-tamer advertises in a contemporary for a situation. It is reported that Mr. SMILLIE
contemplates engaging him for Sir ROBERT HORNE.

* * *

Whatever else happens, somebody says, the public must hang together. But what does he think
we do in a Tube?

* * *

"Primroses have been gathered at Welwyn," says The Evening News. As even this seems to have
failed we think it is time to drop these attempts to draw the POET LAUREATE.

* * *

Glasgow licensees are being accused of giving short whisky measure. It is even said that in
some extreme cases they paint the whisky on the glass with a camel-hair brush.

* * *

Mice, says Mrs. GREIVE, of Whins, hate the smell of mint. So do lambs.

* * *

"Coal strike or no coal strike," says The Daily Mail, "the Commercial Motor Exhibition at Olympia
will not be postponed." This is the dogged spirit that made England what it used to be.

* * *

Orpheus of old, an American journal reminds us, could move stones with his music. We have heard
piano-players who could move whole families; but this was before the house shortage.

* * *

The National Association of Dancing Masters has decided to forbid "the cockroach dive" this
year. Our advice to the public in view of this decision is to go about just as if nothing serious
had happened.

* * *

A large party of American University students are on a visit to Switzerland. It is satisfactory
to know that the Alps are counted every morning and all Americans searched before they leave
the country.

* * *

"The English house would make an ideal home," says an American journal. Possibly, if people
only had one.

* * *

Three statues have been stolen in one week from Berlin streets. It is now suggested that the
London police might be taken off duty for one night in order to give the thief a sporting chance.

* * *

It is not true, says an official report, that Scottish troops are being sent to Ireland. We
are pleased to note this indication that the bagpipes should only be used in cases of great
emergency.

* * *

"What does the Mexican President stand for?" asks The New York Globe. Probably because the
Presidential chair is so thorny.

* * *

The Dublin County authorities have decided to release from their asylums all but the most dangerous
lunatics. We are assured that local conditions in no way justify this discrimination.

* * *

A jury of children has been empanelled in Paris to decide which of the toys exhibited at the
Concours Lupine is the most amusing. We understand that at the time of going to press an indestructible
rubber uncle is leading by several votes.

* * *

A burglar arrested in Berlin was taken ill, and while operating upon him the surgeons found
in his stomach six silver spoons, some forks, a number of screws and a silver nail file. Medical
opinion inclines to the theory that his illness was due to something he had swallowed.

A FAIR WARNING.

    "REQUIRED.--English Child to play afternoons with French boy ten years;
    good retribution."--Continental Daily Mail.

      Poultry, for the Farmer and Fancier.

We shall treat the porters at Liverpool Street with more respect in future.

MICHAELMAS AND THE GOOSE.

    (Lines written under the threat of a Coal-strike).

  You for whose Mass by immemorial use,
    When Autumn enters on his annual cycle,
        We offer up the fatted goose
        Mid fragrant steam of apple-juice,
              Hear our appeal, O Michael!

  Sir, do not try our piety too sore,
    Bidding us sacrifice--a wrench how cruel!--
        Her whom we prize all geese before--
        The one that lays that precious ore,
              Our priceless daily fuel.

  Her output, as it is, shows want of will
    To check the slackness growing rife and rifer;
        And it would fall far lower still
        (Being, indeed, reduced to nil)
              If they should go and knife her.

  Yet there are men who press the slaughterers' claim
    In sympathetic language, talking loosely;
        Among them Mr. GOSLING--shame
        That anyone with such a name
              Should cackle so ungoosely!

  Not in your honour would that bird be slain
    If they should kill her--and the hour is critical--
        But for their own ends, thus to gain
        An object palpably profane
              (That is to say, political).

  Defend her, Michael! you who smote the crew
    Of Satan on the jaw and stopped their bluffing;
        So, if you see her safely through,
        We'll give you thrice your usual due
              Of other geese (with stuffing).

  O.S.

BRIDGE CONVENTIONS.

The game of Auction Bridge may be divided into three species. There is the one we play at home,
the second which we play at the Robinsons', and the third that is played at the high table
at my club.

The three games are peculiarly distinct, but I have only recently discovered, at some expense,
that each one has its particular conventions. At home, if I venture a light no-trump, and Joan,
sitting on my right, exclaims well out of turn, "Oh! father," we all know that Joan has the
no-trumper, and the play proceeds accordingly.

At the Robinsons' it is different. Suppose I make a call of one spade and the elder hand two
hearts, and my partner (let us suppose he is Robinson) passes, and I say "Two spades," and
the elder hand says "Three hearts," and Robinson bellows "No," I at once realise that it would
be extremely dangerous to call three spades.
