* EXAMPLE.--At the commencement of the year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for
1000l., the annual payment for which is 24l. 1s. 8d.; in 1847 he had paid in premiums 168l.
11s. 8d.; but the profits being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22l. 10s.
per annum for each 1000l.) he had 157l. 10s. added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums
paid.

The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only one-half need be paid
for the first five years, when the Insurance is for Life. Every information will be afforded
on application to the Resident Director.

SYMPATHIES of the CONTINENT, or PROPOSALS for a NEW REFORMATION. By JOHN BAPTIST VON HIRSCHER,
D.D., Dean of the Metropolitan Church of Freiburg, Breisgau, and Professor of Theology in the
Roman Catholic University of that City. Translated and edited with Notes and Introduction by
the Rev. ARTHUR CLEVELAND COXE, M.A., Rector of St. John's Church, Hartford, Connecticut, U. S.

    "The following work will be found a noble apology for the position
    assumed by the Church of England in the sixteenth century, and for the
    practical reforms she then introduced into her theology and worship. If
    the author is right, then the changes he so eloquently urges upon the
    present attention of his brethren ought to have been made three
    hundred years ago; and the obstinate refusal of the Council of Trent
    to make such reforms in conformity with Scripture and Antiquity, throws
    the whole burthen of the sin of schism upon Rome, and not upon our
    Reformers. The value of such admissions must, of course, depend in a
    great measure upon the learning, the character, the position, and the
    influence of the author from whom they proceed. The writer believes,
    that questions as to these particulars can be most satisfactorily
    answered."--Introduction by Arthur Cleveland Coxe.

JOHN HENRY PARKER, Oxford; and 377.
