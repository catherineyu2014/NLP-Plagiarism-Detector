Bloomsbury Square was at first called Southampton Square, and the sides were known by different
names--Seymour Row, Vernon Street, and Allington Row. The north side was occupied by Bedford
House. It is considerably older than its large neighbour on the north, and is mentioned by
Evelyn in his Diary, on February 9, 1665. In Queen Anne's reign it was a most fashionable locality.
The houses suffered greatly during the Gordon Riots, especially Lord Mansfield's house, in
the north-east corner, which was completely ruined internally, and in which a most valuable
library was destroyed, while Lord and Lady Mansfield made their escape from the mob by a back-door.
Pope refers to the Square as a fashionable place of resort. Among the names of famous residents
we have Sir Richard Steele, Richard Baxter, the Nonconformist divine, Dr. Akenside, and Sir
Hans Sloane. The elder D'Israeli, who compiled "Curiosities of Literature," lived in No. 6;
he came here in 1818, when his famous son was a boy of fourteen.

The College of Preceptors stands on the south side. The Pharmaceutical Society, established
in 1841, first took a house in the Square in that year. It was incorporated by royal charter
two years later, and in 1857 the two adjacent houses in Great Russell Street were added to
the premises, which include a library and museum. There is also at No. 30 the Institute of
Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland.

In Southampton Street Colley Cibber, the dramatist and actor, was born.

Silver Street, which is connected with Southampton Street by a covered entry, is described
by Strype as "indifferent well built and inhabited"--a character it apparently keeps up to
this day.

Bloomsbury Market Strype describes as "a long place with two market-houses, the one for flesh
and the other for fish, but of small account by reason the market is of so little use and so
ill served with provisions, insomuch that the inhabitants deal elsewhere." In Parton's time
it was still extant, "exhibiting little of that bustle and business which distinguishes similar
establishments." Though it was cleared away in 1847, its site is marked by Market Street, which
with Silver and Bloomsbury Streets forms a cross.

Southampton Row is a very long street, extending from Russell Square to High Holborn. It includes
what was formerly King Street and Upper King Street, which together reached from High Holborn
to Bloomsbury Place. Gray, the poet, lodged in this Row in 1759.

The Church of St. George is in Hart Street. St. George's parish was formed from St. Giles's
on account of the great increase of buildings in this district. In 1710 the proposal for a
new church was first mooted, and in 1724 the parishes were officially separated. The church
stands on a piece of ground formerly known as Plough Yard. It is the work of Hawkesmoor, Wren's
pupil, and was consecrated in 1730. It cannot be better described than in the words of Noorthouck:
"This is an irregular and oddly constructed church; the portico stands on the south side, of
the Corinthian order, and makes a good figure in the street, but has no affinity to the church,
which is very heavy, and would be better suited with a Tuscan portico. The steeple at the west
is a very extraordinary structure; on a round pedestal at the top of a pyramid is placed a
colossal statue of the late King [George I.], and at the corners near the base are alternately
placed the lion and unicorn, the British supporters, with festoons between. These animals,
being very large, are injudiciously placed over columns very small, which make them appear
monsters." The lions and unicorns have now been removed. This steeple has been described by
Horace Walpole as a masterpiece of absurdity. Within, the walls rise right up to the roof with
no break, and give an impression of great spaciousness. There is a small chapel on either side,
that on the east, of an apselike shape, being used as a baptistery. The western one contains
a ponderous monument erected in memory of one of their officials by the East India Company.
There are other monuments in the church, but none of any general interest. The Communion-table
is enclosed by a wooden canopy with fluted columns, said to be of Italian origin, and to have
been brought from old Montague House.

In Little Russell Street are the parochial schools. These were established in 1705 in Museum
Street, and were removed in 1880 to the present building. They were founded by Dr. Carter for
the maintenance, clothing, and education of twenty-five girls, and the clothing and education
of eighty boys. The intentions of the founder are still carried out, as recorded on a stone
slab on the front of the building, which is a neat brick edifice, with a group of a woman and
child in stone in a niche high up, and an appropriate verse from Proverbs below.

Allusion has already been made to New Oxford Street. It extends from Tottenham Court Road to
Bury Street, and is lined by fine shops and large buildings, chiefly in the ornamental stuccoed
style. The Royal Arcade--"a glass-roofed arcade of shops extending along the rear of four or
five of the houses, and having an entrance from the street at each end"--was opened about 1852,
but did not answer the expectations formed of it, and was pulled down (Walford).

At the corner of Museum Street, once Peter Street, is Mudie's famous library. The founder,
who died in 1890, began a lending library in King Street in 1840, and in 1852 removed to the
present quarters. In 1864 the concern was turned into a limited liability company. The distribution
of books now reaches almost incredible figures.

Great Russell Street Strype describes as being very handsome and very well inhabited. Thanet
House, the town residence of the Thanets in the seventeenth century, stood on the north side.
Sir Christopher Wren built a house for himself in this street. Among the inhabitants and lodgers
have been Shelley and Hazlitt, J. P. Kemble, Speaker Onslow, Pugin the elder, Charles Mathews
the elder, and, in later years, Sir E. Burne-Jones.

At the west end Great Russell Street runs into Tottenham Court Road, a portion of which lies
in the parish of St. Giles. Toten Hall itself, from which the name is taken, stood at the south
end of the Hampstead Road, and an account of it belongs to the parish of St. Pancras. There
is little to remark upon in that part of the Road we can now claim. At the south end is Meux's
well-known brewery, bought by the family of that name in 1809. In 1814 an immense vat burst
here, which flooded the immediate neighbourhood in a deluge of liquor. The Horseshoe Hotel
can claim fairly ancient descent; it has been in existence as a tavern from 1623. It was called
the Horseshoe from the shape of its first dining-room. A Consumption Hospital stands midway
between North and South Crescent.

Bedford Square also falls within St. Giles's parish, but it belongs by character and date to
Bloomsbury. The Square was erected about the very end of the eighteenth century. Dobie says
that "Bedford Square arose from a cow-yard to its present magnificent form ... with its avenues
and neighbouring streets ... chiefly erected since 1778," while it appears in a map of 1799
as "St. Giles's Runs." The official residence of the Lord Chancellor was on the east side.
Lord Loughborough lived there, and subsequently Lord Eldon, who had to escape with his wife
into the British Museum gardens when the mob made an attack on his house during the Corn Law riots.

The streets running north and south are all of the same prosperous, substantial character.
About Chenies Street large modern red-brick mansions have arisen.

Woburn Square is a quiet place, with fine trees growing in its pleasant garden. In it is Christ
Church, the work of Vulliamy, date 1833. It is of Gothic architecture, and is prettily finished
with buttresses and pinnacles, in spite of the ugly material used--namely, white brick. It
was at first designed to call the Square Rothesay Square, but it was eventually named Woburn,
after the seat of the Duke of Bedford.

Great Coram Street was, of course, named after the genial founder of the Foundling Hospital.
In it is the Russell Institution, built at the beginning of the century as an assembly-room,
and later used as institute and club. It was frequently visited by Dickens, Leech, and Thackeray,
the last named of whom came here in 1837, and remained until 1843, when the house had to be
given up owing to the incurable nature of his wife's mental malady. He wrote here many papers
and articles, including the famous "Yellow-plush Papers," which appeared in Fraser's Magazine;
but his novels belong to a later period.

We have now wandered over a district rich in association, containing some of the oldest domestic
architecture existing in London, but which, taken as a whole, is chiefly of a date belonging
to the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries--a date when ladies wore powder and
patches, when sedan-chairs were more common than hackney cabs, and when the voice of the link-boy
was heard in the streets.

BOUNDARIES OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL PARISHES.

ST. GILES-IN-THE-FIELDS.

This parish is bounded on the south by Castle Street; east by part of Drury Lane, Broad Street,

corner of Torrington Square; on the north by a line cutting across from this point westward,
and striking Tottenham Court Road just above Alfred Mews; on the westward by Tottenham Court
Road and Charing Cross Road to Cambridge Circus, thence by West Street to the corner of Castle
Street, and so the circuit is complete.
