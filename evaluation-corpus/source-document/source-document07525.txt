In all cases where the course of this ancient stream was crossed (except at its final intersection
of 33d Street), the rock was found to be very soft and disintegrated, a large quantity of water
was encountered, and heavy timbering was required. The construction at these localities will
be taken up later. In addition, disintegrated rock, but of a less troublesome character, was
invariably met under the depressions in the rock surface developed by the borings from the
streets and test holes from the tunnels. Many of these places required timbering, and no timbering
was elsewhere necessary except at the portals. These coincident conditions were especially
marked in 32d Street, which for a long distance closely adjoins the course of the former creek.

Disposal of Spoil.--The materials excavated from the tunnels were dumped at the 35th Street
pier on barges furnished by the Railroad Company under another contract, and were towed to
points near the Bayonne peninsula where the spoil was used principally in the construction
of the Greenville Freight Yards and the line across the Hackensack Meadows to the tunnels.
Details of this work will be given in a subsequent paper. After December, 1907, when the excavation
was about 85% completed, the contractor furnished the barges and effected the complete disposal
of the spoil.

Difficulties of Excavation.--As stated in a previous paper, the excavation of the Twin Tunnel
in 33d Street was continued westward to the west line of Fifth Avenue on the original grade.
At that point the contractor started three drifts in the three-track section. The relation
of the drifts to each other and to the cross-section are shown by Fig. 3. The center heading
was driven a little in advance of those on the sides. At a distance of 65 ft. west of Fifth
Avenue the rock surface was broken through in the top of the heading, and a very fine sand
was encountered. For some distance east of this point the rock was badly disintegrated, and
the heading required timbering. Through the soft material, tight lagging was placed on the
sides and roof of the heading, and the face was protected by breast boards. There was a moderate
flow of water through the cracks, and, in spite of every effort, some of the fine sand was
constantly carried into the heading.

In one or two instances considerable ground was lost at the face. On the evening of December
14th, 1906, as a heavy coal wagon was passing along 33d Street above the heading, the rear
wheels dropped through the asphalt pavement. An examination disclosed a cavity under the pavement
about 14 ft. long, 12 ft. wide and 14 ft. deep. Evidently, the fine sand had gradually settled
into the voids caused by the loss of material at the face, and the settlement broke the brick
sewer over the heading. The sewer was temporarily repaired, and the hole in the street was
filled before morning. A tight bulkhead was built across the heading, and work was abandoned
at that point. The north drift was advanced to a point 108 ft. west of Fifth Avenue where sand
was also encountered and a considerable run occurred. After that time all work on the three-track
section was discontinued.

The Company then took up the consideration of changes in plan. Test holes were drilled above
this heading and to the sides. The results indicated that there was sufficient rock cover of
fair quality to enable the Twin Tunnel to be driven without great risk. The new plan (continuing
the Twin Tunnel westward at a lower grade) was adopted in March, 1907, and work was immediately
resumed at Fifth Avenue.

The relation between the cross-sections under the old and new plans at that point is shown
by Fig. 3. Before the new section was excavated it was necessary to support the timber work
in the old headings. The plan adopted is also shown by Fig. 3. The rock was excavated under
the center heading, as shown in cross-section, for a length of about 3 ft. A girder composed
of two 18-in. I-beams was then put in position over each line and supported on the sides by
posts. The ends at the center lines between the tunnels were supported on short posts bearing
on the rock bench. The support of the timbering in the headings was then transferred to the
girders by additional posts. Blocking was also inserted between the tops of the beams and the
rock walls between the headings. Fig. 2, Plate LIX, gives a good idea of the timber work in
the top headings above the I-beams. When the roof had been made secure, the removal of the
bench was begun. As the work advanced it was necessary to replace the short posts at the center
of the tunnel by others of full height, and there was considerable settlement in the I-beams
during this operation. When the bench had been removed to a point 61 ft. west of Fifth Avenue,
settlement was detected in the street surface above. Bench excavation was suspended and a section
of the permanent lining, 35 ft. long, was placed. The space between the lining and the beams
and between the beams and the roof was filled with rubble masonry. Grout pipes were built into
the masonry and later all voids were filled with grout. Fig. 3, Plate LIX, shows the first
section of the concrete lining completed and part of the rubble in place; and Fig. 4, Plate
LIX, shows details of the work above the tunnels. A second section of bench was next removed
and more lining was placed. Work was continued in this way until all the roof at the old three-track
headings had been secured. In this portion of the work the posts were embedded in the concrete.

Between Fifth and Sixth Avenues there were two more sections of bad rock where it was necessary
to support the roof with steel beams. At these latter points there were no complications with
the excavation for the Three-Track Tunnel, and the work was much simpler. To avoid leaving
the center posts in the permanent work, two rows of temporary posts were placed, as shown by
Fig. 1, Plate LX, the center wall and skewback were built, and the posts were removed, as shown
by Fig. 2, Plate LX, before placing the remainder of the lining.

In 32d Street the normal progress of the excavation was frequently interrupted by encountering
soft and unsound rock. In the excavation between the East River and the Intermediate Shafts
it was possible to overcome these conditions by temporarily narrowing the excavation on one
side and supporting the roof on 16 by 16-in. transverse timbers caught in niches in the rock
at the sides, leaving sufficient room for the steam shovel to work through. In order to save
time, the height of the excavation was not increased before placing these timbers, so that,
previous to the concreting, they all required to be raised to clear the masonry lining and
were then supported on posts on the center line between the tunnels. This permitted the remainder
of the excavation to be made, and such additional timbering as was required was placed. At
most of these sections a brick arch and water-proofing were used, on account of the presence
of water. In certain places the center line posts were buried in the core-wall, and, in order
to permit the placing of the water-proofing, were then cut off one by one flush with its top
as the load was transferred to the completed masonry. In other cases the load was transferred
to posts clear of the masonry and the center line posts were entirely removed. Under such conditions
the normal concrete methods, to be described later, could not be used, and special forms were
substituted.

In this section of the work the most serious difficulties were encountered near Fourth Avenue
a short distance east of the Intermediate Shaft, and beneath the site of the old pond shown
on General Viele's map. The rock cover was known from the boring to be very thin, and the presence
of the subway overhead caused some anxiety. The excavation was at first taken out to practically
full width and timbered, but the rock became so treacherous that the heading was narrowed to
a width sufficient for one tunnel only. With this span the rock in the roof held without timbering.
As the masonry lining approached, sufficient trimming was done to permit the placing of the
core-wall and one arch. Above the completed core-wall and brick arch the voids were filled
solid with rubble masonry to give an unyielding support to the roof. The excavation of the
remaining width of tunnel was then undertaken. Near the west side of Fourth Avenue, the excavation
broke out of rock at the top, and fine sand and gravel with a large quantity of water were
encountered. The work of excavation was arduous, and proceeded very slowly, on account of the
care with which it was executed. Only a small amount of sand entered the tunnel, but the lining
was placed as soon as the excavation was completed. Rubble masonry packing and grout ejected
through pipes built into the arch were used to fill the voids above the roof. As a further
precaution against the settlement of the subway, 2-in. pipes were washed down from the street
above the point where soft ground was exposed in the roof of the tunnel, and through them grout
was forced into the ground at various depths. Careful levels show that no settlement of the
subway has taken place.

West of the Intermediate Shaft the tunnel was excavated for full width until bad rock was encountered
about 60 ft. west of Madison Avenue. (See General Viele's map, Plate IX.) Timbering was used
for a short distance, and then the heading and bench were narrowed to 18 ft., and steam-shovel
excavation was abandoned. As the heading advanced the rock grew steadily softer, the difficult
conditions in this locality culminating when a slushy disintegrated feldspar was met, requiring
poling and breasting. Thereafter the rock improved markedly, but near the east side of Fifth
Avenue its thickness above the roof was found to be only 1-1/2 ft., and the advance was stopped,
pending a decision as to a change of plan.

After some delay, an exploration drift, similar to the one already described, was driven through
to Sixth Avenue, and a change in plan was made, substantially the same as for the 33d Street
tunnels. Enlargement to full size was at once started, but, for 400 ft. the rock was very soft
and poor, and required extremely careful handling. The exploration drift was widened out to
the full Twin-Tunnel width, and I-beams were placed and supported, in much the same manner
as in 33d Street. The rock was so soft that it was frequently necessary to drive poling boards
ahead as the face was mined out with picks and shovels. The load was very heavy, and the work
the most difficult encountered in the tunnels.

After this stage of the enlargement was reached, the excavation of the bench and the placing
of the lining proceeded alternately, with the I-beams temporarily supported on long posts while
the concrete core-wall was being built. Considerable settlement took place while shifting the
posts, and eventually showed on the street surface and in the adjacent sidewalk vaults, but
no damage was done to the structural portions of the buildings.

While the above work had been going on westward from Fifth Avenue, the excavation of the Twin
Tunnel eastward from the end of the open-cut section at Sixth Avenue had been proceeding rapidly,
and, toward the end of the difficult Fifth Avenue work, it was being attacked from both directions.

PROGRESS OF EXCAVATION.

Owing to the numerous sections of poor rock, interspersed throughout the work with stretches
of sound rock, the progress of the excavation was very irregular, especially in 32d Street.
The rate of excavation in good ground is shown in Table 1. In the sections of bad ground, the
operations of excavation, timbering, and lining were often carried on alternately, and it is
impracticable to include them in the table.

THREE-TRACK TUNNEL EXCAVATION.

When it became evident that the work through the Fifth Avenue section would be extremely slow,
shafts were sunk in each street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. The shafts, as shown on
Plate XIV, were located in the streets, but in such a way as to block only half of the roadway.
At the same time it was decided to construct in open cut about 200 ft. of the Three-Track Tunnel
at the west end of the contract in 32d Street, where the rock surface was below the top of
the tunnel. It was hoped that the remainder of the work could be built without opening the
street, but further investigation showed that this was impracticable, and eventually all the
Three-Track Tunnel in 32d Street, except 120 ft. east of the shaft, was built in open cut.

Thirty-second Street Work in Tunnel.--Following the sinking of the shaft, a drift was driven
across the street at the crown of the tunnel, and a top heading on the south side was excavated
in both directions. Frequent cross-drifts to the north side showed that the rock was nowhere
very sound and that, except for a short distance east of the shaft, it was distinctly unfavorable
for the wide Three-Track excavation. In this stretch the north ends of these cross-cuts were
connected by a second heading, and wall-plates and sets of three-segment arch timbering were
set up to support the roof of the drifts. The cross-cuttings were gradually widened and timbered
until the entire excavation had been made down to the level of the wall-plates, as shown in
Fig. 3, Plate LX. The bench was then excavated in two lifts, leaving the wall-plates supported
on narrow longitudinal berms, which were removed in short sections to permit the placing of
posts under the wall-plates.

Thirty-second Street Open-Cut Work.--Before actual open-cut excavation was started, all buildings
facing it were underpinned to rock. For this purpose, a trench was dug along the face of the
buildings and of the same depth as their cellars. Holes were cut in the front foundation walls
through which long needle-beams (Fig. 4, Plate LX) were inserted and jacked up on blocking
placed on the cellar floor and in the trench, until the weight of the building had been taken
off its foundations. A close-sheeted trench was then sunk to rock under the front building
walls, and a light rubble masonry retaining wall was built in it to support the building permanently.
Frequently, the excavation for the underpinning wall, which was taken out in sections from
30 to 40 ft. long, and in places was carried to a depth of 40 ft., was very troublesome on
account of the large quantity of water encountered and the fineness of the sand, which exhibited
a tendency to flow when saturated.

The Elevated Railroad columns in Sixth Avenue, near the north and south lines of 32d Street,
were underpinned in a manner similar to the building foundations, while those on the center
line of the street were supported by girders riveted to them close under the track level. The
girders in turn were supported on posts footed on the new underpinning of the adjacent columns.
On the completion of the tunnels, concrete piers were built up from the roof of the tunnel
to form a permanent foundation for the center-line columns. The area to be excavated under
Sixth Avenue was enclosed by a rubble masonry retaining wall constructed in a trench.

Open-cut excavation was started by planking over the street on stringers resting on transverse
12 by 12-in. caps. The caps were gradually undermined and supported on temporary posts which
were then replaced by short posts resting on 12 by 12-in. sills about 7 ft. below the cap.
The operation was then repeated and the sill was supported on another set of short posts resting
on a second sill. When the excavation had been carried down in this manner to the level of
the top of the tunnel, diagonal 3 by 10-in. timbers were cut in between the posts and sills
to form a species of double A-frame, the legs of which rested in niches cut in the rock and
on posts carried up the face of the underpinning wall, and the whole was stiffened with vertical
tie-rods. This construction is shown by Fig. 3, Plate LXII. The brick sewer was replaced temporarily
by one of riveted steel pipe. This pipe and the water and gas pipes and electric conduits were
suspended from the timbers as the pipes were uncovered.

Excavation in rock was made by sinking a pit to sub-grade for the full width of the tunnel
and advancing the face of the pit in several lifts, the muck being blown over the slope and
loaded into buckets at its foot.

The work was attacked at several places simultaneously, and the spoil was hoisted by derricks
located at convenient points along the side of the cut.

Thirty-third Street Work in Tunnel and Open Cut.--The West 33d Street Shaft was similar to
the one in 32d Street, and was sunk during February, March, and April, 1907, through 10 ft.
of earth, 21 ft. of soft rock, and 29 ft. of fairly hard rock. It was necessary to timber heavily
the upper 30 ft. of the shaft. The timber later showed evidences of severe strain, and had
to be reinforced.

As soon as the shaft excavation was deep enough, a drift was driven part way across the tunnels,
and top headings were started both east and west to explore the rock. The heading to the west
was divided into two drifts, as shown on Plate LXI. These two drifts were continued to the
west end of the contract, and were then enlarged to a full-sized heading and timbered, as shown
on Plate LXI and Fig. 3, Plate LX. The rock near the shaft contained many wet rusty seams,
and settlement was detected in the segmental tunnel timbering soon after the widening of the
heading was completed. Short props were placed under the timbers, and the street surface was
opened with a view of stripping the earth down to the rock and thus lightening the load on
the timbering. Street traffic was maintained on a timber structure with posts eventually carried
down to the rock surface, and the walls of the buildings on the north side of the street were
underpinned to rock. The settlement of the tunnel timbering was checked for a time, and the
bench was excavated as shown on Plate LXI. In this work the cut in the center was first made,
and the short props were replaced by struts, as shown; after this the berms were removed and
the side posts were placed. While building the brick arches, holes were left in the masonry
around the struts. After the masonry had hardened, piers were built on the arches to support
the segmental timbers. The struts were then removed and the openings filled with masonry. The
voids above the arch were packed with rock and afterward thoroughly grouted.

The timbers near the shaft continued to settle, and, although they had been placed from 9 to
12 in. above the level of the top of the masonry, by October 1st, they encroached 9 in. within
the line of masonry. It was then decided to remove the rock for a distance of 48 ft. west of
the shaft, and build this portion of the tunnel in open cut. The posts supporting the deck
forming the street surface were replaced by an A-frame structure similar to that developed
for the 32d Street open cut, without interruption of the street traffic.

After making the open cut to the westward of the shaft, there was a slip in the rock north
of and adjoining the shaft. Fortunately, the timbers did not give way entirely, and no damage
was done. The open cut was extended eastward for a distance of 46 ft., making the total length
of tunnel built in open cut on this street 94 ft.

East of the shaft, for a distance of about 125 ft., the rock was broken and could not be excavated
to full size without timbering the roof, but between this section of poor rock and those already
mentioned in connection with the work at Fifth Avenue, there was a stretch of 600 ft. of good
rock where all the spoil was handled with a steam shovel.

TWIN-TUNNEL LINING.

The masonry lining for the tunnels was not started until the late fall of 1906, after excavation
had been in progress for a year and a half. At that time concreting was started in the single
tunnels westward from the First Avenue Shafts, and by spring was in full swing in the Twin Tunnels.

The plans contemplated the use of a complete concrete lining except where large quantities
of water were encountered; in which case the arches, beginning at a point 15° above the springing
line, were to be built of vitrified paving brick. By reference to Plate XII it will be seen
that the water-proofing, which in the concrete-roof tunnels extended the full height of the
sides to the 15° line, was carried in the brick-roof tunnels completely around the extrados
of the arch. The cross-sections also show the location of the electric conduits which were
buried in the mass of the side and core-walls and which limited the height to which the concrete
could be carried in one operation.

The same general scheme of operations was used wherever possible throughout the Twin-Tunnel
work, but was subject to minor modifications as circumstances dictated. Concrete was first
deposited in the bottom, to the grade of the flow line of the drains; after it had set, collapsible
box forms, of 2-in. plank with 3-in. plank tops, were laid on it to form the ditch and the
shoulders for the flagstone covers. The track, which had previously been blocked up on the
rock between the ditches, was raised and supported on the ditch boxes above the finished floor
level. At the same time, light forms were braced from the ditch boxes to the grade of the base
of the low-tension and telephone-duct bank. After depositing the concrete to this level, the
telephone ducts were laid.

The forms for the water-proofing or sand-wall up to the 15° line and for the main side-walls
and core-walls were built in 30-ft. panels and were supported on carriages, which, traveling
on a broad-gauge track above the ditches, moved along the tunnel, section by section, as the
work advanced. The panels were hung loosely from joists carrying a platform on the top chord
of the carriage trusses, and were adjusted transversely by bracing and wedging them out from
the carriage. The small forms for the refuge niches, ladders, etc., were collapsible, and were
spiked to the main panel forms just previous to the deposition of the concrete. The concrete
was deposited from the platform on top of the carriage, to which the cars were elevated in
various ways. Plate LXI shows the details of the carriages, and is self-explanatory.
