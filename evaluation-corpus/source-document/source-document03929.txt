The landscape shows many shades of green; deep forests, mostly coniferous, extend from the
valley of the Rednitz to that of the Tauber. Yet the villages lie in the midst of great circles
of cultivated land, for the tillage of man is immemorial here. Around the many weirs the grass
grows higher, so high often that you can see only the beaks of the droves of geese, and were
it not for their cackle you might take these beaks to be strangely mobile flowers.

The little town of Eschenbach lies quite flat on the plain. In it a fragment of the Middle
Ages has survived, but no strangers know it, since hours of travel divide it from any railway.
Ansbach is the nearest point in the great system of modern traffic; to get there you must use
a stage-coach. And that is as true to-day as it was in the days when Gottfried Nothafft, the
weaver, lived there.

The town walls are overgrown with moss and ivy; the old drawbridges still cross the moats and
take you through the round, ruined gates into the streets. The houses have bay-windows and
far-projecting overhangs, and their interlacing beams look like the criss-cross of muscles
on an anatomical chart.

Concerning the poet who was once born here and who sang the song of Parsifal, all living memory
has faded. Perhaps the fountains whisper of him by night; perhaps sometimes when the moon is
up, his shadow hovers about the church or the town-hall. The men and women know nothing of
him any more.
