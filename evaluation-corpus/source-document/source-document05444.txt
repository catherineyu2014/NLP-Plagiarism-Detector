THIRD PAPER.

Emerging from these gloomy caflons, and passing the Beni-Mansour, the village of Thasaerth
(where razors and guns are made), Arzou (full of blacksmiths), and some other towns, we enter
the Beni-Aidel, where numerous white villages, wreathed with ash trees, lie crouched like nests
of eggs on the summits of the primary mountains, with the magnificent peaks of Atlas cut in
sapphire upon the sky above them. At the back part of an amphitheatre of rocky summits, Hamet,
the guide, points out a little city perched on a precipice, which is certainly the most remarkable
site, outside of opera-scenery, that we have ever seen. It is Kalaa, a town of three thousand
inhabitants, divided into four quarters, which contrive, in that confined situation, to be
perpetually disputing with each other, although a battle would disperse the whole of the tax-payers
over the edges. Although apparently inaccessible but by balloon, Kalaa may be approached in
passing by Bogni. It is hard to give an idea of the difficulties in climbing up from Bogni
to the city, where the hardiest traveler feels vertigo in picking his way over a path often
but a yard wide, with perpendiculars on either hand. Finally, after many strange feelings in
your head and along your spinal marrow, you thank Heaven that you are safe in Kalaa.

The inhabitants of Kalaa pass for rich, the women promenade without veils and covered with
jewels, and the city is clean, which is rare in Kabylia. There are four amins (or sheikhs)
in Kalaa, to one of whom we bear a letter of introduction. The anaya never fails, and we are
received with cordiality, mixed with stateliness, by an imposing old man in a white bornouse.
"Enta amin?" asks the Roumi. He answers by a sign of the head, and reads our missive with care.
Immediately we are made at home, but conversation languishes. He knows nothing but the pure
Kabyle tongue, and cannot speak the mixed language of the coasts, called Sabir, which is the
pigeon-French of Algiers and Philippeville.

"Enta sabir el arbi?"--"Knowest thou Arabic?" asks our host.

"Makach"--"No," we reply. "Enta sabir el Ingles?"--"Canst thou speak English?"

"Makach"--"Nay," answers the beautiful old sage, after which conversation naturally languishes.

But the next morning, after the richest and most assiduous entertainment, we see the little
daughter of the amin playing in the court, attended by a negress. The child-language is much
the same in all nations, and in five minutes, in this land of the Barbarians, on this terrible
rock, we are pleasing the infant with wiles learnt to please little English-speaking rogues
across the Atlantic.

The amin's daughter, a child of six years, forms with her slave a perfect contrast. She is
rosy and white, her mouth is laughing, her peeping eyes are laughing too. What strikes us particularly
is the European air that she has, with her square chin, broad forehead, robust neck and sturdy
body. A glance at her father by daylight reveals the same familiar type. Take away his Arab
vestments, and he would almost pass for a brother of Heinrich Heine. His child might play among
the towers of the Rhine or on the banks of the Moselle, and not seem to be outside her native
country. We have here, in a strong presentment, the types which seem to connect some particular
tribes of the Kabyles with the Vandal invaders, who, becoming too much enervated in a tropical
climate to preserve their warlike fame or to care for retiring, amalgamated with the natives.
The inhabitants on the slopes of the Djordjora, reasonably supposed to have descended from
the warriors of Genseric, build houses which amaze the traveler by their utter unlikeness to
Moorish edifices and their resemblance to European structures. They make bornouses which sell
all over Algeria, Morocco, Tunis and Tripoli, and have factories like those of the Pisans in
the Middle Ages.

Contrast the square and stolid Kabyle head shown in the engraving on this page with the type
of the Algerian Arab on page 494. The more we study them, or even rigidly compare our Arab
with the amin of Kalaa, the more distinction we shall see between the Bedouin and either of
his Kabyle compatriots. The amin, although rigged out as a perfect Arab, reveals the square
jaw, the firm and large-cut mouth, the breadth about the temples, of the Germanic tribes: it
is a head of much distinction, but it shows a large remnant of the purely animal force which
entered into the strength of the Vandals and distinguished the Germans of Cæsar's day. As for
the Kabyle of more vulgar position, take away his haik and his bornouse, trim the points of
his beard, and we have a perfect German head. Beside these we set a representative Arab head,
sketched in the streets of Algiers. See the feline characteristics, the pointed, drooping moustache
and chin-tuft, the extreme retrocession of the nostrils, the thin, weak and cruel mouth, the
retreating forehead, the filmed eye, the ennui, the terrestrial detachment, of the Arab. He
is a dandy, a creature of alternate flash and dejection, a wearer of ornaments, a man proud
of his striped hood and ornamental agraffes. The Kabyle, of sturdier stuff, hands his ragged
garment to his son like a tattered flag, bidding him cherish and be proud of the rents made
by Roumi bayonets.

It must be admitted that the Kabyles, with a thousand faults, are far from the fatalism, the
abuse of force and that merging of individualism which are found with the Islamite wherever
he appears. Whence, then, have come these more humane tendencies, charitable customs and movements
of compassion? There are respectable authorities who consider them, with emotion, as feeble
gleams of the great Christian light which formerly, at its purest period, illuminated Northern
Africa.

It is the opinion of some who have long been conversant with the Kabyles that the deeper you
dive into their social mysteries the more traces you find of their having once been a Christian
people. They observe, for instance, a set of statutes derived from their ancestors, and which,
on points like suppression of thefts and murders, do not agree with the Koran. We have spoken
of their name for the law--kanoun: evidently the resemblance of this to [Greek: chanôn] must
be more than accidental. Another sign is the mark of the cross, tattooed on the women of many
of the tribes. These fleshly inscriptions are an incarnate evidence of the Christian past of
some of the Kabyles, particularly such as are probably of Vandal origin. They are found especially
among the tribes of the Gouraya, are probably a result of the Vandal invasion, and consist
in the mark or sign of the cross, half an inch in dimension, on their forehead, cheeks and
the palms of their hands. It appears that all the natives who were found to be Christians were
freed from certain taxes by their Aryan conquerors; and it was arranged that they should profess
their faith by making the cross on their persons, which practice was thus universalized. The
tattooing is of a beautiful blue color, and is more ornamental than the patches worn by our
grandmothers.

Our final inference, then, is, that the Kabyles preserve strong traces of certain primitive
customs, which in certain cases are attributable to a Christian origin.

A true city of romance, a Venice isolated by waves of mountains, and built upon piles whose
beams are of living crystal, Kalaa, all but inaccessible, attracts the tourist as the roc's
egg attracted Aladdin's wife. For ages it has been a city of refuge, a sanctuary for person
and property in a land of anarchy. Nowhere else are the proud Kabyles so skillful and industrious--nowhere
else are their women so much like Western women in beauty and freedom.

The Kabyle woman preserves the liberty which the female of the Orient possessed in the old
times, before the jealousy of Mohammed made her a bird in a cage, or, as the Arab poet says,
"an attar which must not be given to the winds." In Kabylia the women talk and gossip with
the men: their villages present pretty spectacles at sunset, when groups of workers and gossipers
mingled are seen laughing, chatting and singing to the accompaniment of the drum. Some of these
women are really handsome, and are freely decorated, even in public, with the singular enamels
which are their peculiar manufacture, and with threads of gold in their graceful cheloukas
or tunics.

But Kalaa, like the picturesque "Peasant's Nest" described by Cowper in his Task, pays one
natural penalty for the rare beauty of its site. It pants on a rock whose gorges of lime are
the seat of a perpetual thirst. In vain have the suffering natives sunk seven basins in one
alley of the town, the cleft separating the quarter of the Son of David from that of the children
of Jesus (Aissa). The water only trickles by drops, and, though plentiful in winter, deserts
them altogether in the season when their air-hung gardens, planted in earth brought up from
the plains, need it the most. As the mellowing of the season brings with it its plague of aridity,
recourse is had to the river at the bottom of the ravine, the Oued-Hamadouch. Then from morning
to night perpendicular chains of diminutive, shrewd donkeys are seen descending and ascending
the precipice with great jars slung in network.

But the Hamadouch itself in the sultry season is but a thread of water, easily exhausted by
the needs of a population counting three thousand mouths. Then the folks of Kalaa would die
of thirst were it not for the foresight of a marabout of celebrity, whom chance or miracle
caused to discover a hidden spring at the bottom of the rock. By the aid of subscriptions among
the rich he built a fountain over the sources of the spring.

It is a small Moorish structure, with two stone pilasters supporting a pointed arch. In the
centre is an inscription forbidding to the pious admirers of the marabout the use of the fountain
while a drop remains in the Hamadouch. To assist their fidelity, the spring is effectually
closed except when all other sources have peremptorily failed, in the united opinion of three
amins (Kabyle sheikhs). When the amins give permission the chains which restrain the mechanism
are taken off, and the conduits are opened by means of iron handles operating on small valves
of the same metal. In the great droughts the fountain of Marabout Yusef-ben-Khouia may be seen
surrounded with a throng of astute, white-nosed asses, waiting in philosophic calm amid the
excitement and struggle of the attendant water-bearers.

Seen hence, from the base of the precipice, where abrupt pathways trace their zigzags of white
lightning down the rock, and where no vegetation relieves the harsh stone, the town of Kalaa
seems some accursed city in a Dantean Inferno. Seen from the peaks of Bogni, on the contrary,
the nest of white houses covered with red tiles, surmounted by a glittering minaret and by
the poplars which decorate the porch of the great mosque, has an aspect as graceful as unique.
In a vapory distance floats off from the eye the arid and thankless country of the Beni-Abbes.
On every level spot, on every plateau, is detected a clinging white town, encircled with a
natural wreath of trees and hedges. They are all visible one from the other, and perk up their
heads apparently to signal each other in case of sudden appeal: it is by a telegraphic system
from distance to distance that the Kabyles are collected for their incorrigible revolutions.
Two ruined towers are pointed out, called by the Kabyles the Bull's Horns, which in 1847 poured
down from their battlements a cataract of fire on Bugeaud's chasseurs d'Orléans, who climbed
to take them, singing their favorite army-catch as well as they could for want of breath:

    As-tu vu la casquette, la casquette,
    As-tu vu la casquette du Père Bugeaud?

Far away, at the foot of the Azrou-n'hour, an immense peak lifting its breadth of snow-capped
red into the pure azure, the populous town of Azrou is spread out over a platform almost inaccessible.

What a strange landscape! And what a race, brooding over its nests in the eagles' crags! Where
on earth can be found so peculiar a people, guarding their individuality from the hoariest
antiquity, and snatching the arts into the clefts of the mountains, to cover the languid races
of the plains with luxuries borrowed from the clouds! The jewelry and the tissues, the bornouses
and haiks, the blacksmith-work and ammunition, which fill the markets of Morocco, Tunis and
the countries toward the desert, are scattered from off these crags, which Nature has forbidden
to man by her very strongest prohibitions.

We are now in the midst of what is known as Grand Kabylia. The coast from Algiers eastward
toward Philippeville, and the relations of some of the towns through which we have passed,
may be understood from the following sketch:

The scale of distances may be imagined from the fact that it is eighty-seven and a half miles
by sea from Algiers to Bougie. The country known as Grand Kabylia, or Kabylia par excellence,
is that part of Algeria forming the great square whose corners are Dellys, Aumale, Setif and
Bougie. Though these are fictitious and not geographical limits, they are the nearest approach
that can be made to fixing the nation on a map. Besides their Grand Kabylia, the ramifications
of the tribe are rooted in all the habitable parts of the Atlas Mountains between Morocco and
Tunis, controlling an irregular portion of Africa which it is impossible to define. It will
be seen that the country of the tribe is not deprived of seaboard nor completely mountainous.
The two ports of Dellys and Bougie were their sea-cities, and gave the French infinite trouble:
the plain between the two is the great wheat-growing country, where the Kabyle farmer reaps
a painful crop with his saw-edged sickle.

In this trapezoid the fire of rebellion never sleeps long. As we write comes the report of
seven hundred French troops surrounded by ten thousand natives in the southernmost or Atlas
region of Algeria. The bloody lessons of last year have not taught the Kabyle submission. It
seems that his nature is quite untamable. He can die, but he is in his very marrow a republican.

[TO BE CONTINUED.]

OUR HOME IN THE TYROL

CHAPTER I

"Do not go to the Tyrol," said some of our friends in Rome. "You will be starved. It is a beautiful
country, but with the most wretched accommodation and the worst living in the world."

"Come to Perugia, where it is always cool in summer," said a painter. "You can study Perugino's
exquisite 'Annunciation' and other gems of the Umbrian school, and thus blend Art with the
relaxation of Nature."

"Come rather to Zemetz in the Engadine, where good Leonhard Wohlvend of the Lion will help
us to bag bears one day and glaciers the next," exclaimed a sporting friend, the possessor
of the most exuberant spirits.

"But," remarked the fourth adviser, a lady, "I recommend, after all, the Tyrol. I went weak
and ill last year to the Pusterthal, and returned to Rome as fresh and strong as a pony. I
found the inns very clean and the prices low; and if you can live on soup, delicious trout
and char, fowls, veal, puddings and fruit, you will fare famously at an outside average of
five francs a day."

As this advice exactly coincided with our own inclinations, we naturally considered it the
wisest of all, especially as the invitation to bear-hunts and glacier-scrambles was not particularly
tempting to our party. The kind reader will perceive this for himself when he learns that it
consisted of an English writer, who, still hale and hearty in spite of his threescore years
and ten, regarded botany as the best rural sport; his wife, his faithful companion through
many years of sunshine and shadow, who had grown old so naturally that whilst anticipating
a joyful Hereafter she still clothed this present life with the poetic hues of her girlhood;
their daughter, the present narrator; and their joint friend, another Margaret, who, whilst
loyal to her native country, America, had created for herself, through her talent, her love
of true work and her self-dependence, a bright social and artistic life in Italy. As for Perugia,
our happy quartette had plenty of opportunities for studying the old masters in the winter
months. Now we were anxious to exchange the oppressive, leaden air of the Italian summer for
the invigorating breezes of the Alps.

Yet how fresh and graceful Italy still looked as we traveled northward in the second week of
June! The affluent and at the same time gentle sunshine streamed through the broad green leaves
of the vines, which were flung in elegant festoons from tree to tree. It intensified the bright
scarlet of the myriad poppies, which glowed amongst the brilliant green corn. It lighted up
the golden water-lilies lying on the surface of the slowly-gliding streams, and brought into
still greater contrast the tall amber-colored campanile or the black cypress grove cut in sharp
outline against the diaphanous blue sky. We knew, however, that fever could lurk in this very
luxury of beauty, while health was awaiting us in the more sombre scenes of gray mountain and
green sloping pasture. We traveled on, therefore, by the quickest and easiest route, and alighting
from the express-train to Munich at the Brixen station on the Brenner Pass, were shortly deposited,
bag and baggage, at that comfortable and thoroughly German inn, the renowned Elephant.

We prided ourselves on being experienced travelers, and consequently immediately secured four
places in the Eilwagen, which was to start from the inn at six o'clock the next morning for
our destination, Bruneck. We handed over our luggage to the authorities, partook of supper
and then retired contentedly to rest--in the case of the two Margarets to the soundest of slumbers--until
in the morning we were suddenly awoke, not by the expected knock of the chambermaid, but by
a hurrying to and fro of feet, and the sound of several eager voices resounding through the
echoing corridors. Fortunately, it was not only perfectly light, but exhausted Nature had enjoyed
its allotted spell of sleep; for we found, to our astonishment, that it was past five o'clock.
The storm continued outside no whit abated, and in the midst of the human hubbub the father's
voice sounded clear and distinct.

"The British lion is roaring," exclaimed Margaret: then, snatching at my attire, I was in the
midst of the disturbance in a very few minutes.

My father stood at his door and held in his upraised hand a pair of villainous boots, old and
"clouted," fit for the Gibeonites, very different from the substantial English aids to the
understanding which he had placed in all good faith outside his door the previous night. A
meagre-faced chambermaid was wringing her hands beside him. Two waiters vociferated, whilst
a third, whose eyes were still heavy with sleep, was blindly groping at the other doors.

"My excellent London boots, made on a special last, have disappeared," said my father, trying
to moderate his indignation, "and this vile rubbish has been substituted in their stead.--Where
is your master?" he demanded of the sobbing woman. "Fetch either your master or my boots."

"Herr Je! Herr Je! I've hunted high and low, up stairs and down," murmured the weeping maid,
"and the gracious gentleman's boots are nowhere."

"Sir," said a little round-headed man, who seemed to have his wits about him, "I know very
well that these are not your boots. I cleaned your grace's boots, and placed them at your door
at four o'clock. It is some beggarly Welschers who have crept up stairs and exchanged for them,
unawares, their old leather hulks."

"Ah yes," said the wailing woman: "three Welschers, who came for the fair, slept in the barn,
and had some bread and cheese before they left, an hour ago."

In the midst of this explanation the door of No. 2 was slightly opened, and an arm in a shirt
sleeve appeared and drew in a pair of boots. Hardly, however, was the door closed when the
bell of No. 2 began to ring violently.

"Heavens! another pair gone!" exclaimed a waiter. Then with one accord the whole bevy of distracted
servants rushed to No. 2, declaring their innocence.

"My good people, I cannot understand one word you say," replied a mild English voice. "I request
you to be gone, and let one of you bring me my own proper boots."

The British lion--who, it must be owned, had reason to roar--became calmed at the evident innocence
of the servants and the gentle sounds of this British lamb. He therefore went to the rescue,
and explained the matter to No. 2, who in his turn meekly expostulated: "Very vexatious! Dear
me! My capital boots made expressly for Alpine climbing! But we must make the best of it, my
dear sir."

Maids and men still remained in an excited group, when at this juncture the head-waiter appeared,
bringing with him the landlord, a respectable middle-aged man, who, bowing repeatedly, assured
the gentlemen of his extreme annoyance at the whole affair, especially as it compromised the
fame of his noted house. Indeed, he would gladly refund the loss were the two pairs of boots
not forthcoming.

Forthcoming! How could they be forthcoming when at this moment the clock was striking six,
and the Eilwagen (Margaret termed it the oil-wagon) was to start at once, and we with it, though
minus breakfast? The British lamb departed hurriedly, but we were detained to be told of another
complication. Not only were the boots gone, but the royal imperial post-direction of Austria,
after duly weighing and measuring our luggage, had adjudged it too heavy and bulky for the
roof of its mail-coach. It would, however, restore our money, and even suggest another mode
of conveyance, but take us by its Eilwagen it would not.

"The delay is indeed advantageous, mein Herr," said the landlord, addressing my father, who
walked about in slippers, "as time will thereby be gained for a thorough investigation of the
boot question."

One trouble always modifies another. The disappearance of the boots made us bear the departure
of the Eilwagen philosophically. Nay, at the conclusion of a substantial breakfast of hot coffee,
ham and eggs we began greatly to enjoy ourselves. Rejected by the post-direction for the Eilwagen,
we felt at liberty to choose our time of departure. For the present, therefore, acting as our
own masters, we leisurely sauntered out of doors, admired the clean, attractive exterior of
the roomy inn, and smiled at the fresco of the huge elephant, which, possessed of gigantic
tusks and diminutive tail, carried a man, spear in hand, on his back. A giant bearing a halbert,
accompanied by two youths in tunics, completed the group. An inscription informed us that this
was the first elephant which had ever visited Teutschland, and that the inn derived its name
from the fact of the august quadruped sleeping there on its journey, which took place in the
sixteenth century. The worthy landlord had also ordered a fresco to be painted on his inn to
the honor of the Virgin. She was depicted standing upon the crescent moon, and her aid was
invoked by the good man in rhyme to protect the house "from lightning's rod, O thou Mother
of God! From rain and fire, and sickness dire;"--but, alas! there was no mention of thieves.

We were deploring the fact when the worthy Wirth appeared in person, attended by a slim youth
in blue-and-silver uniform, whom he introduced to us with considerable emphasis as representing
the police. The officer of justice stepped forward and with a low bow took the length and breadth
of the Welschers' offending, and promised that the Austrian government would do its best to
see the distinguished, very noble Herrschaft righted. We cannot be quite certain that he promised
that the emperor would seek the boots in person, but something was said about that mighty potentate.
At the assurance of governmental interference how could the British lion fail of being pacified?
He declared that the landlord had acted as a gentleman, shook hands with him, and returning
to the house exchanged his slippers for his second pair of boots--very inferior in make and
comfort to the missing treasures--and then conferred with the landlord as to the best method
for the continuance of our journey.

The Herr Wirth, with whom and the whole household we had now become excellent friends, declared
that with our unusual amount of luggage the only plan was a "separat Eilfahrt," which means
a separate express-journey to Bruneck. It had, however, its advantages: we should travel quickly
and with the greatest ease. As we were willing to accede to his proposition, he handed us over
to his clerks in the royal imperial post-bureau, who, having received a round sum of florins,
filled in and sanded an important document, which being delivered to us conveyed the satisfactory
information that we four individuals, whose ages, personal appearance and social position the
head-official had magnanimously passed over with a compassionate flourish, were, on this fourteenth
day of June, 1871, to be conveyed to the town of Bruneck in the caleche No. 1990; which said
vehicle would be duly furnished with cloth or leather cushions, one foot-carpet, two lamps,
main-braces, axletree, etc., including one portion of grease. So far, well and good, but on
our inquiring when the said No. 1990 would be ready to start, the head-official merely looked
over his spectacles at his subordinate, who in his turn, leaning back in his tall chair and
stroking his beard, called out, "Klaus! Klaus!"--a call which was answered by a tall, stolid-looking
man, also in livery, who seemed to occupy the post of official hostler.

"Klaus," demanded the second chef, "the Herrschaft ask when the vehicle will be ready."

Klaus gave an astonished stare, and articulated some rapid sounds in a dialect quite unintelligible
to us.

"Precisely," returned the subordinate. "The horses are sent for, and when they arrive the Herrschaft
will be expedited forthwith."

Whereupon the clerks of the post-direction became suddenly immersed in the duties of their
office. We took the hint and good-naturedly retired.

It certainly looked like business when outside we perceived Klaus dragging forth with all his
might and main, from a dark and dusty coach-house, a still dustier old coach. Darker it was
not, for the color was that of canary, emblazoned with the black double-headed Austrian eagle.
This, then, was the caleche No. 1990. It had the air of a veteran officer in the imperial army
who had not seen active service for many a long day.

Klaus was too busy to pay much attention to us. He pulled the piece of antiquity into the street,
and with an uneasy expression, as if he knew before-hand what he had to expect, he tried and
tugged at one of the door-handles. "Sacrament!" he muttered as he at last let go and began
hunting in the boot of the coach, under the driver's cushion and in secret nooks and corners,
which proved, at the best, mere receptacles for fag-ends of whipcord and cobwebs.

"It is gone, sure enough, the key of the right-hand door." I am afraid it had disappeared three
years before, at least, to the fellow's knowledge, for he added in an apologetic but hopeful
tone, "It matters not the least, for, see you, all the inns are on the left-hand side."

A glimpse into the coach-house had convinced us of the fact of this vehicle alone being at
our disposal; so we determined to manage as best we might, and bore even philosophically the
smell of the musty, dust-filled cushions, which Klaus triumphantly pulled out of the open door
and beat, as it were, within an inch of their lives.

Briefly, to make two long hours short after several tedious quarters of expectation, a square-set,
rosy-faced and middle-aged postilion appeared round the far corner of the village street, resplendent
in silver lace and yellow livery, leading three gaunt but sturdy horses. In ten minutes my
father was seated on the box and we ladies inside, receiving the good wishes of Klaus, of the
landlord, the men and the maids, now all smiles and curtsies, and with the postilion blowing
triumphantly his horn we dashed out of the quaint, dreamy little cathedral town of Brixen.

The road speedily began to ascend, and we looked down from a considerable height on the vast
Augustine monastery of Neustift, with its large church, its picturesque cluster of wings, refectories
and separate residences of every stage of architecture, lying snugly amongst vineyards, Spanish
chestnuts and fig trees. Ever upward, by but above the waters of the rapid Brienz, until at
the fortress of Mühlbach we entered the Pusterthal proper.

This old fort commands the valley and spans the road. Our driver, who, according to Austrian
regulation, went on foot wherever the ascent was particularly steep, could not enter into our
admiration of its romantic position. Hans--for such was his name--could not perceive any grace
or beauty in a scene which had often disturbed his imagination and awakened his fear. "Ah,"
said he, "it is a God-forsaken spot. It is here that many slaughtered Bavarians wander about
at night with candles, seeking for their bodies or their souls--I know not which. Look you!
My grandmother came from Schliers in Bavaria, and the two countries speak the same language.
However, in my father's day, in 1809, Emperor Franz drove the Bavarians and French out of this
part of the Tyrol. It was in April, when the Austrian Schatleh came marching through the Pusterthal
with his soldiers, and drove the Bavarians before him. Though these were only a handful, they
would not make truce, but broke down all the bridges in their retreat. They wanted to burn
the bridge at Lorenzen, only the country-folks with blunderbusses, cudgels and pitchforks protected
it, and made them run; so they marched on, pursued by the Landsturm, to this fortress, where
they fought like devils until many were killed, and the others, at their wits' end, managed
to push on to Innsbruck. Yes, glorious days, and long may the Tyrolese cry God, Emperor and
Fatherland! But those wandering spirits make my flesh creep. Ugh!"

The road now allowed of the horses being put to a lively trot, interrupting further conversation.
We drove steadily on, stopping at comfortable inns in large well-to-do villages, where even
the poorest appeared to enjoy in their houses unlimited space. The landlords politely demanded
our journey-certificate, solemnly inserted the hour of our arrival and departure, and confirmed
the important fact of our remaining exactly the same number of travelers as at the beginning
of our journey. We exchange Hans for a youthful Jacobi, and Jacobi for an aged Seppl, who all
agreed in their livery if not in their ages; each stage also being at a slightly higher elevation,
so that by degrees we had changed the Italian vegetation, which had lingered as far as the
neighborhood of Brixen, for the more northern crops of young oats and flax. Yet one prominent
reminder of comparatively adjacent Italy accompanied us the greater portion of the three hours'
drive. Hundreds of agile, swarthy figures were busily boring, blasting, shoveling and digging
for the new railway, which is to convey next season shoals of passengers and civilization,
rightly or wrongly so called, into this great yet primitive artery of Southern Tyrol, the Pusterthal
already forming, by means of the Ampezzo, a highway between Venice and the Brenner Pass. As
the morning advanced the busy sounds of labor ceased, and we saw groups of dark-eyed men reclining
in the shade of the rocks, partaking of their frugal dinners of orange-colored polenta--plenten,
as our Seppl called it.

So onward by soft slopes bordered by mountain-ridges, all scarped and twisted, having dark
green draperies of pine trees cast round their strong limbs, with bees humming in the aromatic
yet invigorating breeze fresh from the snow-fields, and swallows wheeling in the clear blue
air, until we reached a fertile amphitheatre. A confusion of flourishing villages was scattered
over its verdant meadows, and here and there on a jutting rock or mountain-spur a solitary
mediaeval tower or imposing castle stood forth, the most conspicuous of all being a fortress
situated on a natural bulwark of rock. Half around its base a little town, which appeared stunted
in its growth by the course of the river, confidingly rested. A hill covered with wood screened
the other side of the castle, whilst exactly opposite a broad valley ran northward, hemmed
in by lofty snow-fields and glaciers that sparkled in the noonday sun. Natural hummocks or
knolls covered with wood broke the uniformity of this upland plain, which still ascended eastward
to the higher, bleaker Upper Pusterthal. This valley continues to mount to yet more sterile
regions, until, reaching the great watershed of the Toblacher Plain, which sends part of its
streams to the Adriatic, the others to the more distant Black Sea, it gradually dips down again
to the fruitful wine-regions of Lienz.

We have now, however, to do with Bruneck, where our venerable 1990 had safely deposited us
at the modern inn, the Post. We might almost style it the fashionable inn, for it was kept
by a gentleman of noble birth and the representative of the province, who, having a large family
of growing children, had wisely let his gentility take care of itself and permitted his guests
to be entertained at their own rather than at his expense. As the noble landlady was suffering
from headache, the dapper waitress took charge of us, provided us with rooms, and then installed
us at the early table-d'hôte, where a number of the officers of the garrison, with some other
regular diners, whom we learnt to recognize in time as the town bailiff, the apothecary and
the advocate, were despatching, in the midst of great clatter and bustle, the inevitable kalbsfleisch
and mehlspeis.

The lady who had recommended us to go to the Pusterthal had likewise assured us that the Post
at Bruneck would satisfy all our requirements. In this she was mistaken. It is true that tastes
differ, especially amongst tourists, who may be divided into two classes--those who merely
care for the country, let them disguise it as they will, when they can endue it with the features
of their town-life; and those who love the country for the sake of Nature, and thus endeavor
to carry trails of freshness back with them to town. Now, it was all artificial dust and din
that we desired to get rid of. We had traveled in search of verdant meadows, brawling streams
and sweet-scented woods. We could not find solace and relaxation in sitting at the windows
of our respectable inn to watch every passer-by on the dusty boulevard below, in spending half
the day indoors, let it be ever so comfortably, or in merely turning out in the evening to
shop in the puny town, whilst we bemoaned the want of a circulating library and a brass band.
It was even more intolerable, as the Post had been built perversely with its back to the fine
view of the glaciers. Moreover, the whole establishment was in the hands of bricklayers, painters
and glaziers, who were enlarging and repairing it for the comfort and convenience of future
but certainly not of present visitors.

As trade was evidently flourishing, we had not the slightest hesitation in ringing for Maria,
the kellnerin, and consulting with her about the mode of our procuring country lodgings as
soon as possible. Maria was a good-natured girl and willing to serve us, but our ideas could
not be so easily carried out as we had anticipated. One of us had the folly to suggest vacant
rooms being to let in the castle.

"Gracious!" replied Maria, casting her eyes up to the sky. "In the castle! Why, that's crown
property, and filled with the military. Really, I don't know how I can help you, since the
gentlemen officers have engaged for themselves every apartment inside or outside the town."

We spoke of the many neighboring villages, which were filled with grand old houses.

Maria declared they were better outside than inside, and that the Bauers who dwelt in them
could scarcely find bedding for their cattle, much less for Christian gentlefolks. "There is
the Herr Apotheker's house at Unterhofen, but he will not let that. There is the Hof at Adelsheim:
it's out of the question. There is also Frau Sieger's in the same village, but that is let
to the Herr Major for the season. Look you! you had better go to Frau Sieger. Stay, I will
send Lina with you."

Lina proved to be one of the blossoms of the noble family tree. She led my mother and me to
Frau Sieger, but what came of our afternoon's expedition deserves to be told in a fresh chapter.

CHAPTER II.

Now, this house-hunting was a piece of business to be got through as soon as possible. Nevertheless,
three hours elapsed before we returned to the hotel. We found the father and Margaret leaning
their heads out of a corridor window, and when we asked them what they were about, she replied,
"We have been wishing that the grand old mansion in yonder village were only a pension, where
we could obtain rooms. But have you met with any success?"

"A pension! That sounds like Meran or Switzerland, instead of this primitive Pusterthal. Only
let us have tea, and we will tell you what we have done."

"Very good! We will be patient; but you do not look dissatisfied with your afternoon," said
my father.

Nor in truth were we. Sipping our mild tea, we related our adventures. The little girl Lina
had taken us into the town, which consisted of one narrow street in the shape of a half-moon,
where houses of all ages and ranks squeezed against each other and peeped into each other's
windows with the greatest familiarity. In one of the largest of these Frau Sieger lived. Her
husband was the royal imperial tobacco agent, and the house was crammed full of chests of the
noxious and obnoxious weed, the passages and landing being pervaded with a sweet, sickly smell
of decomposing tobacco. In the parlor, however, where Frau Sieger sat drinking coffee with
her lady friends, the aromatic odor of the beverage acted as a disinfectant. The hostess drew
us aside, listened complacently to our message, and then graciously volunteered to let us rooms
under her very roof.

We should have chosen chemical works in preference! There was, then, nothing to be done but
to take leave with thanks. Accompanied by the little Lina, we passed under the town-gate, and
whilst sorely perplexed perceived a pleasant village, at the distance of about a mile, lying
on the hillside in a wealth of orchards and great barns. The way thither led across fields
of waving green corn, the point where the path diverged from the high-road being marked by
a quaint mediaeval shrine, one of the many shrines which, sown broadcast over the Tyrol, are
intended to act as heavenly milestones to earth-weary pilgrims.

That was the village of Adelsheim, Lina said, where their own country-house was situated, and
Freieck, belonging to Frau Sieger; and there, at the farther extremity of the village, was
Schönburg, where old Baron Flinkenhorn lived. The biggest house of all on the hill was the
Hof, and that below, with the gables and turrets, the carpenter's.

The bare possibility of finding a resting-place in that little Arcadia made us determine to
go thither. We would try the inn, and then the carpenter's.

The inn proved a little beer-shop, perfectly impracticable. A woman with a bright scarlet kerchief
bound round her head, who was washing outside the carpenter's, told us in Italian that she
and her husband, an overseer on the new railway, occupied with their family every vacant room,
which was further confirmed by the carpenter popping his head out of an upper window, and in
answer to Lina's question giving utterance to an emphatic "Na, na, I hab koan" ("No, no, I
have none").

Lina was so sure that the Hofbauer would not let rooms, for he was a wealthy man and owned
land for miles around, that she stayed at a respectful distance whilst we approached nearer
to at least admire the grand old mansion, even if it were closed against us as a residence.
The village was full of marvelous old houses rich in frescoes, oriel windows, gables and turrets,
but this dwelling, standing in a dignified situation on an eminence, was a prince amongst its
compeers. The architecture, which was Renaissance, might belong to a bad style, but the long
slopes of roof, the jutting balconies, the rich iron-work on the oblong façade, the painted
sun-dial and the coats-of-arms now fading away into oblivion, the grotesque gargoyle which
in the form of a dragon's head frowned upon the world,--each detail, that had once been carefully
studied, helped to form a complete whole which it was a pleasure to look upon. The grand entrance,
no longer used, was guarded by a group of magnificent trees, the kings of the region. Traces
of an old pleasure-garden and the dried-up basin of a fountain were visible within.

At this point in the narrative Margaret exclaimed, "None other than my would-be pension! I
have known it from the first, so pray do not keep me on tenterhooks. Were you or were you not
successful? Yet all hope has died within me already, for such a treasure-trove we never could get."

"Well, listen," said the mother. "As we were admiring the house, a handsome, fair-haired young
man, one's perfect ideal of a peasant, came along the road, bowed to us, and when we expressed
our interest in the mansion said that he was the son of the house, and that we might see the
rooms if we liked. Grand old rooms they are, with a great lack of furniture, but nevertheless
perfectly charming. The young man, who is named Anton, thought his father would probably have
no objection to let us rooms. At all events, we could all go over and see the Hofbauer at ten
o'clock to-morrow morning, when he would be in: he was in his fields this afternoon. The whole,
in fact, was a pastoral poem."

The next day we were as punctual as clock-work. A pleasant, comely young peasant woman, who
looked as if she had lived on fresh air all her life, met us in the great stone entrance-hall.
She told us that her father would soon be at liberty, and that, with our permission, she would
again show us the rooms if we wished to see them. This promised well. Fetching a huge bunch
of handsome iron-wrought keys, she conducted us into the great hall of the first floor, hung
with large unframed pictures of the Holy Sacrament. Then unlocking a handsome door which had
once been green and gold, we entered the vast reception-room, almost bereft of furniture, but
possessing a pine floor of milky whiteness and a remarkably fine stove of faience eight feet
high. My father measured the length of the apartment: it was forty feet, and could have seated
a hundred guests. The casements were filled with old lozenge-shaped glass set in lead, and
the fine old iron trellis-work on the outside of the windows gave a wonderfully mediaeval look
to the apartment. There was, moreover, a magnificent bay window, which formed a little room
of itself, besides a second room much less, which, with carved wood wainscot and ceiling, could
have served as an oratory.

Margaret's delight was unbounded. The father smiled quietly, and we the pioneers could scarcely
refrain our pride and pleasure. But there was more to be seen. Crossing the great hall once
more, we entered a large and beautiful room overlooking the main entrance. This had other furniture
besides its handsome porcelain stove and inlaid floor of dark wood. There was not only a comfortable
modern bed, but chairs, sofa and table; a chest of drawers too, which was covered with innumerable
religious knickknacks--little sacred pictures in glass frames, miniature saints, and artificial
flowers in small china pots. Having dipped her finger in a holy-water shell hanging on the
wall, our guide drew back a long chintz curtain which covered the end of the room, and showed
us a large and handsome chapel below. A fald-stool ran along the front of the window which,
with an additional lattice of gilt and carved wood, separated the room from the church. This
had evidently been in old times the apartment of the lord and his lady, and here they had knelt
and listened to the holy office without mingling with their dependants below. This room, if
we had the good fortune to obtain lodgings in the mansion, was to belong to the poetess, for
it was full of inspiration and old-world memories.

Then out again into the hall and up another flight of stone stairs, through a second great
lobby into a corridor, which communicated on either side with two charming rooms, spotlessly
clean and perfectly empty, if I except the stoves; but still, if we chose, these two rooms
could be Margaret's and mine, and the corridor as well, with a beautiful balcony which commanded
an enchanting view of the rich Pusterthal up and down, right and left, with a row of jagged,
contorted dolomite mountains thrown into the bargain. All this was to be ours if only the Hofbauer
would have us. So down we went, casting longing looks around us--down into the entrance-hall,
where a crowd of poor people were streaming out of the stube, the parlor of the family, such
as in the midland counties of England would be called the house-place, and so into the grassy
court in front, where we awaited with anxious hearts the fiat of the Hofbauer.

We were not long kept waiting. In another minute the master of the house stood before us, a
tall, thin, elderly man, dressed in the full costume of the district--an embroidered cloth
jacket, black leather breeches, which displayed a broad band of naked knee, green ribbed stockings,
shoes and buckles, with a silver cord and tassel on his broad beaver hat. Saluting us with
the grace and ease of a courtier, he apologized for keeping us waiting, but he had been entertaining
the poor of the parish at dinner, according to an old custom of his. These simple Tyrolese
dined, then, at ten o'clock in the morning!

An elderly woman, also tall and spare, now appeared in a bright blue linen apron, that half
hid her thickly-plaited black woolen petticoat, which was short enough to give full effect
to scarlet knit stockings and low, boat-shaped shoes. She carried in her hand a plate of large
hot fat cakes, which she pressed upon us; then pitied the smallness of our appetites, and urged
two apiece at least. Two mouthfuls, however, were sufficient, as the cakes were not only extremely
greasy, but filled with white curds, aniseed and chives. Having received in good part this
intended hospitality, we were rejoiced to hear the Hofbauer express his perfect willingness
that we should take up our abode at the mansion. We need merely pay him a trifle, but we must
furnish ourselves the extra bedsteads. Moidel, his daughter, could cook for us, for she understood
making dishes for bettermost people, having been sent by him to Brixen for a year to learn
cooking; for what was a moidel (maiden) good for that could not cook? He should not make any
charge for her services. Also, if we saw any bits of furniture about the house that suited
us we might take them; and lastly, we could stay until Jacobi, the 25th of July, but on that
day the best bedroom must be given up, as it belonged to his son, the student, who would return
from Innsbruck about that day. All this was charming. We promised to procure beds and bedding
in Bruneck, and arranged to take possession of our new quarters on the following morning.

I will not enter into the rashness of our promise respecting the bedsteads, merely hinting
at the difficulties and complications which beset us. Some of these can be imagined when it
is known that, firstly, there proved not to be an upholsterer, nor even a seller of old furniture,
at Bruneck; and that, secondly, the officers and soldiers of the garrison now quartered there
occupied by night every available spare bed in the township. So it seemed until in our embarrassment
the landlady of the Post arose from her bed to help us to procure some. The interview ended
again with the prudent advice, "Go to Frau Sieger." We went, and that incomparable lady, who
bore us no malice for refusing her rooms, generously provided for a small sum three bedsteads
and an amazing, and what appeared to us superfluous, amount of bolsters, pillows, feather beds,
winter counterpanes; but she would hear no nay, declaring, "It often turned very chilly in
the Pusterthal, and at such times a warm bed was a godsend."

We now began to dream of beds of roses, but we were mistaken: we were crying before we were
out of the wood. We arrived at the Hof the following afternoon with our bag and baggage, and
found Moidel, otherwise Maria, busily preparing the newly-erected bed in the state-room. She
received us cordially, until my mother, laying her shawl on the bedstead belonging to the house,
remarked that she wished that for herself.

Maria seemed suddenly thunderstruck. She turned a deep red, and with a gesture of astonishment
let drop a pillow, exclaiming, "Heavens alive! that is the Herr Student's bed!"

She fled from the chamber, bringing back her aunt to the rescue. The latter looked stern and
aggrieved. "Never, never! no one must lay his head on that pillow but the student," she cried.
Had my mother asked to repose on the altar of the chapel they could not have been more dumbfoundered.

As Frau Sieger's beds were truly spare, and as she could merely provide three, this second
complication ended in the family giving up a bed of their own--one which was adorned at the
head and foot with a cross, a bleeding heart and sacred monogram--one, in fact, which bore
more marks of sanctity about it than the sacred bed of the student. It was obvious that this
mysterious individual was consecrated to the Church, and that even before his ordination all
that he touched was holy.

The storm had again given place to sunshine, and the two quiet women passed gently to and fro
with coarse but sweet-scented linen, which they fetched from an old chest adorned with red
tulips, a crown of thorns and the legend "K. M., 1820," on a bright blue ground. Good old Kaetana!
That chest had once been crammed full to overflowing with linen which, like other young women,
she had spun for her own dowry, but when the Hofbauerin died Kathi became the housekeeper and
mother to the little children. Thus the contents of the chest had gradually decreased, until
the maiden aunt drew forth the four last pair of new sheets for these passing strangers. She
felt it no sacrifice. It would have grieved her more to touch the piles of fine new linen which
she and Moidel had spun through many a long winter evening, and which were now safely hidden
away in the great mahogany wardrobe, which the Hofbauer, in harmony with the more luxurious
ideas of the age, had given to his daughter. It occupied the place of honor in the great saloon,
having three companion chests of drawers of lesser dimensions, which the father at the same
time had presented to each of his sons. That of the eldest, Anton, was emptied by the owner
and placed by him at our disposal; that of the second, the student, was carefully guarded from
the sun by a covering formed of newspapers; the third, belonging to Jacobi, the youngest, appeared
to us filled with books. Jacob was shy, and some days elapsed before we became acquainted.
Anton, however, appeared modestly ready to attend to our least beck and call. The first evening,
perceiving that we had no candlesticks, we conferred with Anton.

"Freilich," he said. "We have none of our own, but I am sure that, as you will take care of
them, there can be no great harm in lending you some of the Virgin's." We demurred at first,
but with a smile on his open, ingenuous face he added, "The Herrschaft may be quite sure that
I would not sin against my conscience." He then brought half a dozen plated candlesticks from
the little sacristy, which he committed to our care.

The reader must not suppose that this was a disused chapel: far from it. In the dusk of the
summer evening a murmuring chant like the musical hum of bees pervaded the vast old mansion,
which was otherwise hushed in perfect silence. It was the Rosenkranz (or rosary) repeated by
the household in the chapel. The Hofbauer knelt on one side near the altar, and led the service,
his two sons, the four men-servants, the aunt and Moidel, with the three maid-servants, reciting
the responses on their respective sides. The even-song over, the household quietly retired to rest.

Chance had graciously brought us to the Hof in the midst of preparations for the festival of
the Holy Father. On Sunday, June 18, the whole Catholic world was to celebrate the astounding
fact of Pio Nono having exceeded the days of Saint Peter. We, who had come from Rome, where
thirty upstart papers were denouncing time-honored usages and formulas, where many of the people
had begun to sneer at the Papacy and to take gloomy views of the Church, were not prepared
for the religious fervor and devotion to the Papal See which greeted us in the Tyrol, especially
at Bruneck, where from time immemorial a race of the staunchest adherents to Rome had flourished.
The mere fact that we came from the Eternal City clothed us with brilliant but false colors.
Endless were the questions put to us about the health and looks of the Holy Father, whom they
believed to be kept in a dungeon and fed on bread and water--a diet, however, turned into heavenly
food by the angels. Perhaps the most perplexing question of all was, whether the Herr Baron
Flinkenhorn, who had been born in exactly the same year as the Holy Father, bore the faintest
resemblance to that saintly martyr. We could but shake our heads as the old nobleman was pointed
out to us on the morning of the festival. Decrepit and bent with age, he shuffled along by
the side of his old tottering sister, an antiquated couple dressed in the French fashions of
1810. They hardly perceived, so blind and old were they, the bows and greetings which they
received. They knew, however, that it was Pio's festival, and they made great offerings to
the Church and to the poor.

Deafness even has its compensations. Thus this old couple had not been kept awake all night
by the ringing of bells and the firing of small cannon, which had continued incessantly since
the setting of the sun had ushered in the festival on the previous evening. The firing lasted
all day--a popular but very startling and disturbing mode of expressing joy and satisfaction.
Bruneck wreathed and flagged its houses: there were processions, the prettiest being considered
that of the female pupils of the convent of the Sacred Heart, who walked in white, bearing
lilies. At night the good Sisters made a grand display of sacred transparencies in their convent
windows--rhymes about the age of Saint Peter and the Pope; the Virgin rescuing the sinking
vessel of the Church; Saint Peter seated on his emblematic rock, with his present successor
at his side; and so forth--all wondered, gaped at and admired by the people, until the great
spectacle of the evening commenced. As soon as night had fairly set in a hundred fires blazed
upon the mountains--far as the eye could reach, for miles and many miles, one dazzling gigantic
illumination. Papal monograms, crosses, tiaras shone forth in startling proportions. High up,
far from any human habitation, on the verge of the snow, in clearings of the mountain forests,
on Alpine pastures, these fiery letters had been patiently traced by toiling men and lads.
Anton and Jacobi were not behind-hand, and by means of two hundred little bonfires had devised
the papal initials on the upland common behind the house. The illumination, however, had not
begun to reach its full splendor when one quick flash of lightning succeeded another, followed
by a rolling artillery of thunder, the precursors of heavy down-pouring rain. In five minutes
the storm had extinguished every bright emblem, and plunged the illuminated mountains into
impenetrable blackness. The weather, grimly triumphant, drove lads and lasses drenched to their
homes. So ended the festival, but in the morning, in dry clothes, every one had the pleasure
of imagining how beautiful the spectacle would have been but for the rain.

WILMINGTON AND ITS INDUSTRIES.

CONCLUDING PAPER.

We have pointed out the metropolis of Delaware as being a distinctly Northern city, planted
in the distinct South. Among other things, this complication has led to some singularities
in its settlement. As a community regulated by the most liberal traditions of Penn, but placed
under the legal conditions of a slave State, it has held a position perfectly anomalous. No
other spot could be indicated where the contrasts of North and South came to so sharp an edge;
and there are few where a skilled pen could set down so many curiosities of folk-lore and confusions
of race. The Dutch, the Swedes and the English Quakers formed the substratum, upon which were
poured the émigrés of the French Revolution and the fugitives from Santo Domingo. The latter
sometimes brought slaves who had continued faithful, and who retained their serfdom under the
laws of Delaware. The French bonnes stood on washing-benches in the Brandywine, and taught
the amazed Quaker wives that laundry-work could be done in cold water. The names of grand old
French families, prefaced by the proprietarial forms of le and du, became mixed by marriage
with such Swedish names as Svensson and such Dutch names as Staelkappe. (The first Staelkappe
was a ship's cook, nicknamed from his oily and glossy bonnet.) As for the refugees from Santo
Domingo, they absolutely invaded Wilmington, so that the price of butter and eggs was just
doubled in 1791, and house-rents rose in proportion. They found themselves with rapture where
the hills were rosy with peach-blossoms, and where every summer was simply an extract from
Paradise.

We cannot linger, as we fain would do, over the quaint and amusing Paris en Amerique which
reigned here for a period following the events of '93. At Sixth and French streets lived a
marchioness in a cot, which she adorned with the manners of Versailles, the temper of the Faubourg
St. Germain and the pride of Lucifer. This Marquise de Sourci was maintained by her son, who
made pretty boxes of gourds, and afterward boats, in one of which he was subsequently wrecked
on the Delaware, before the young marquis was of age to claim his title. In a farm-house, whose
rooms he lined with painted canvas, lived Colonel de Tousard. On Long Hook Farm resided, in
honor and comfort, Major Pierre Jaquette, son of a Huguenot refugee who married a Swedish girl,
and became a Methodist after one of Whitefield's orations: as for the son, he served in thirty-two
pitched battles during our Revolution. Good Joseph Isambrie, the blacksmith, used to tell in
provincial French the story of his service with Bonaparte in Egypt, while his wife blew the
forge-bellows. Le Docteur Bayard, a rich physician, cured his compatriots for nothing, and
Doctor Capelle, one of Louis XVI.'s army-surgeons, set their poor homesick old bones for them
when necessary. Monsieur Bergerac, afterward professor in St. Mary's College, Baltimore, was
a teacher: another preceptor, M. Michel Martel, an émigré of 1780, was proficient in fifteen
languages, five of which he had imparted to the lovely and talented Theodosia Burr. Aaron Burr
happened to visit Wilmington when the man who had trained his daughter's intellect was lying
in the almshouse, wrecked and paralytic, with the memory of all his many tongues gone, except
the French. Some benevolent Wilmingtonians approached Burr in his behalf, showing the colonel's
own letter which had introduced him to the town.

"I wrote that letter when I knew him," said the diplomatic Colonel Burr, "but I know him no more."

The day quickly came when Burr's speech of denial was reflected upon himself, and those who
then honored him "knew him no more."

Another French teacher, by the by, was not of Gallic race, but that of Albion le perfide: this
was none other than William Cobbett, with his reputation all before him, known only to the
Wilmington millers for the French lessons he gave their daughters and the French grammar he
had published. He lived on "Quaker Hill" from 1794 to 1796. He then went to Philadelphia, and
began to publish Peter Porcupine's Gazette. "I mean to shoot my quills," said Cobbett, "wherever
I can catch game." With the sinews of Wilmington money he soon made his way back to England,
became a philosopher, and sat in the House of Commons. Another British exile was Archibald
Hamilton Rowan, an Irish patriot, and one of the "United Irishmen" of 1797. Escaping from a
Dublin jail in woman's clothes, he found his way to Wilmington after adventures like those
of Boucicault's heroes; lived here several years in garrets and cottages, carrying fascination
and laughter wherever he went among his staid neighbors; and after some years flew back to
Ireland, glorious as a phoenix, resuming the habits proper to his income of thirty thousand
pounds a year.

A familiar figure on the wharves of Wilmington was the gigantic one of Captain Paul Cuffee,
looking like a character in a masquerade. His athletic limbs forced into the narrow garments
of the Quakers, and a brim of superior development shading his dark negro face, he talked sea-lingo
among the trading captains, mixed with phrases from Robert Barclay and gutturals picked up
on the coast of Sierra Leone. Captain Cuffee owned several vessels, manned by sailors as black
as shoemaker's wax, and he conducted one of his ships habitually to the African ports. Coming
back rich from Africa, this figure of darkness has often led its crew of shadows into port
at the Brandywine mouth, passing modestly amongst the whalers and wheat-shallops, dim as the
Flying Dutchman and mum as Friends' meeting. It is possible that from some visit of his arose
the legend that Blackbeard, the terrible pirate, who always hid his booty on the margins of
streams, had used the Brandywine for this purpose. At any rate, some clairvoyants, in their
dreams, saw in 1812 the glittering pots of Blackbeard's gold lying beneath the rocks of Harvey's
waste-land, next to Vincent Gilpin's mill. They paid forty thousand dollars for a small tract,
and searched and found nothing; but Job Harvey hugged his purchase money.

Latrobe the architect lived here in the first quarter of the century, midway between Philadelphia
(where he was building waterworks and banks) and Washington (where he was seating a young nation
in legislative halls worthy of its greatness); using Wilmington meanwhile as a pleasant retirement,
where he could wear his thinking-cap, educate his beautiful young daughter, and mix with the
French and other cultured society of the place. Here, too, about fifty years ago, a pretty
French girl used to play and eat peaches, maintained by funds mysteriously supplied from Louisiana,
and ignorant of all connections except a peculating guardian. It was little Myra Clark (now
Mrs. Gaines), who woke up one day to find herself the heroine of the greatest of modern lawsuits,
and the credited possessor of a large part of New Orleans--the same who has recently gained
a million, while she expects to gain a million more, and to be richer than Lady Burdett-Coutts.

Thus has the pretty city ever played its part as a storing-house where things and people and
ideas might be set by to ripen. It is not wonderful that it now and then found itself, quite
unintentionally, a museum, where the far-brought rarities were living souls. In a heavenly
climate, just where the winged songsters of the South held tryst with those of the North, and
where the plants of both latitudes embowered the gardens together, Nature arranged a new garden
wherein were brought together almost all the races that had diverged from Babel.

The antiquities we have been examining, however, yield in age to the venerable walls which
were built to shelter a worship no longer promulgated among us. The Swedes' churches of Philadelphia
and Wilmington are among the oldest civilized fabrics to be found in this new country of ours.
That of Wilmington was built in 1698, and that at Wicaco in Philadelphia in 1700. Rudman, a
missionary from Sweden, preached the first sermon to the Wilmingtonians in May, 1699; and after
him a succession of Swedish apostles arrived, trembling at their own courage, and feeling as
our preachers would do if assigned to posts in Nova Zembla or Patagonia. The salary offered
was a hundred rixdollars, with house and glebe, and the creed was the Lutheran doctrines according
to "the Augsburg Confession of Faith, free from all human superstition and tradition." Dutch
ministers alternated peaceably with the Swedish ones, who bore such Latinized names as Torkillus,
Lokenius, Fabricius, Hesselius, Acrelius. The last wrote in his own language an excellent history
of the Swedish settlements on the Delaware, only a part of which has been rendered into English
by the New York Historical Society. William Penn proved his tolerance by giving the little
church a folio Bible and a shelf of pious books, together with a bill of fifty pounds sterling.
The building was planted half a mile away from the then city, in the village of Christinaham.
Its site was on the banks of the Christine, and its congregation, in the comparative absence
of roads, came in boats or sleighs, according to the season. The church was well built of hard
gray stone, with fir pews and a cedar roof: iron letters fixed in the walls spelled out such
holy mottoes as "LUX L. I. TENEBR. ORIENS EX ALTO," and "SI DE. PRO NOBIS QUIS CONTRA NOS,"
and commemorated side by side the names of William III., king of England, William Penn, proprietary,
and Charles XI. of Sweden. Swedish services were continued up to about the epoch of the Revolution,
when, the language being no longer intelligible in the colony, they were merged into English
ones: the last Swedish commissary, Girelius, returned by order of the archbishop in 1786, and
the intercourse between the American Swedish churches and the ecclesiastical see in the fatherland
ceased for ever. The oldest headstone in the churchyard is that of William Vandevere, who died
in 1719. Service was long celebrated by means of the chalice and plate sent over by the Swedish
copper-miners to Biorch, the first missionary at Cranehook, and the Bible given by Queen Anne
in 1712. The sexes sat separately. In our grandfathers' day the old sanctuary used to be dressed
for Christmas by the sexton, Peter Davis: he was a Hessian deserter, with a powder-marked face
and murderous habits toward the English language. Descending from their sledges and jumpers,
the congregation would crowd toward the bed of coals raked out in the middle of the brick floor
from the old cannon stove: to do this they must brush by the cedars which "Old Powderproof"
had covered with flour, in imitation of snow; and then Dutch Peter, as they complimented him
on his efforts, would whisper the astonishing invocation, "God be tankful for all dish plessins
and tings!"

Modern improvement has a particular spite against the landmarks of antiquity. The railroad
to Baltimore slices off a part of the Swedish graveyard--an institution much more ancient than
the church which stands on it. And the rock by old Fort Christina, upon which Governor Stuyvesant--Irving's
Stuyvesant--stood on his silver leg and took the surrender of the Swedish governor-general,
is now quarried out and reconstructed into Delaware Breakwater.

Doubtless we dwell too fondly on the old memories, but it appears that the souvenirs of this
region are somewhat remarkable for their contrast of nationalities. Perhaps the colonization
of other spots would yield better romances than any we have to offer; yet we cannot help feeling
that a better pen than ours would find brilliant matter for literary effects in the paradise
revealed to good Elizabeth Shipley by her dream-guide.

Delawarean Wilmington is perhaps hardly known to the general public except through two of its
products. Everybody buys Wilmington matches, and everybody knows that Du Pont's powder is made
in the vicinity. Ignoring the foundries and shipyards, the popular imagination recognizes but
these two commodities--the powder which could blow up the obstructions to all the American
harbors, and the match which could touch off the train. A million dollars' worth of gunpowder
and three hundred thousand dollars' worth of matches are the annual product.

Eleuthère Irenée Du Pont, a French gentleman of honorable family, appeared in Wilmington in
1802. The town had at that time hardly three thousand inhabitants. He amazed all the quidnuncs
by buying, for fifty thousand dollars, Rumford Dawes' old tract of rocks on the Brandywine,
which everybody knew was perfectly useless. The stranger was pitied as he began to blast away
the stone. Out of a single rock, separated into fragments, he built a cottage: it was a lonely
spot, and the snakes from the fissures were in the habit of sharing the contents of his well-bucket.
Such was the beginning of the Eleuthère Powder-works. M. Du Pont, who died some forty years
ago, was much beloved for his benevolence and probity. In 1825, La Fayette, during his celebrated
visit of reminiscence, was the guest of the brave old Frenchman for several days, during which
he examined the battle-ground of Brandywine. He here received the ball with which he got his
wound in that battle, from the hands of Bell McClosky, a kind of camp-follower and nurse, who
had extracted the bullet with her scissors and preserved it. The general wrote in the album
of Mademoiselle Du Pont the following graceful sentiment:

     "After having seen, nearly half a century ago, the bank of the
     Brandywine a scene of bloody fighting, I am happy now to find
     it the seat of industry, beauty and mutual friendship.

    "LA FAYETTE.

    "JULY 25, 1825."

While on a Revolutionary topic we may mention that among a great many relics of '76 preserved
in the town is the sword of General Wayne--"Mad Anthony"--a straight, light blade in leather
scabbard, possessed by Mr. W. H. Naff.

The citizens of this pleasant town have ever been orderly and pious, just as they have ever
been loyal. Their religious institutions have grown and flourished. Godfearing and unspeculative,
they have attached themselves to such creeds as appealed most powerfully to the heart with
the least possible admixture of form. "The words Fear God" says Joubert, "have made many men
pious: proofs of the existence of God have made many men atheists." Since the day when Whitefield
poured out his eloquence among the Brandywine valleys and touched the hearts of the French
exiles, Methodism, with its almost entire absence of dogma, has had great success in the community.
This success is now indicated by a rich congregation, and a church-building that would be called
noble in any city. Grace Church, on Ninth and West streets, is a large Gothic temple, seating
nearly eight hundred persons--warmed, frescoed and heavily carpeted inside, and walled externally
with brownstone mixed with the delicate pea-green serpentine of Chadd's Ford. The architect
was a native Wilmingtonian--Thomas Dixon--now of Baltimore. The windows, including a very brilliant
oriel, are finely stained: the font is a delicate piece of carving, the organ is grand, and
the accommodations for Sunday-schools and lectures are of singular perfection. Few shrines
in this country show better the modern movement of Methodism toward luxury and elegance, as
compared with the repellant humiliations of Wesley's day.

It is to be hoped that this advance in attractiveness does not indicate any lapse in the more
solid qualities of spiritual earnestness. "Whenever this altar," well said Bishop Simpson in
dedicating the building on the centenary anniversary of the rise of Methodism--"whenever this
altar shall be too fine for the poorest penitent sinner to kneel here, the Spirit of God will
depart, and that of Ichabod will come in."

We have indicated the Swedish Lutheran missionaries exhorting under the roof of their antique
church in a language which their congregations were beginning to forget, and afterward in a
broken English hardly more intelligible. Their place is largely taken now by predicators of
the faith of John Knox, with a plentiful following of pious believers. Among the family of
Presbyterian kirks in Wilmington the youngest is a large brick edifice built in 1871, for sixty-one
thousand dollars, on Eighth and Washington streets, able to seat nearly a thousand persons,
most comfortably and invitingly furnished, and supplied with lecture-, infant- and Sunday-school-rooms,
together with a huge kitchen, suggesting the agapæ or love-feasts of the primitive Christians.
Meantime, Anglicanism does not lack supporters. The descendants of Monsieur Du Pont, cultured
and influential, have done much to advance the creed, and about fifteen years ago Mr. Alexis
I. Du Pont, pulling down a low tavern in the suburbs, prepared to erect a church upon the site,
to be built mainly through his own liberality. Unhappily, Mr. Du Pont died from the effects
of an explosion at the powder-works ten weeks after the laying of the corner-stone; but the
building was soon completed through the pious munificence of his widow, and the Bible of St.
John's Protestant Episcopal Church now rests on its lectern upon the site of the old liquor-bar,
and the gambling-den of former days is replaced by its pews. The rector is Mr. T. Gardiner
Littell, a man of eminent goodness and intelligence. St. John's has a beautiful open roof,
stained windows and a fine organ: it can offer seats to seven hundred worshipers.

These few specimen churches--and especially the last, which blots out a grogshop--are good
instances, with the large congregations they accommodate, of the way in which a sane, flourishing
manufacturing community provides for the spiritual needs of its members. The tone and moral
well-being which Boz found, or thought he found, among the operatives at Lowell are largely
realized here. But our picture of Wilmington as a hive of industry is not yet complete, and
before we enter upon the highly-interesting problem of its dealings with its working family,
we should enter a few more of its sample manufactories.

Take car-building, for an example, in which the reputation of this town is known to the initiated
of all the States and many foreign countries. Travelers are at this moment spinning in Wilmington-made
railway-carriages over the extremest parts of North and South America, admiring, through Wilmington-made
windows, every possible variety of winter and tropical scenery, on which they comment in English,
German, French, Spanish and all civilized languages. Such a migratory product as a rail-car
is an active messenger of fame for the place of its fabrication. We examine, as a fair type,
the Jackson and Sharp Company's works, claimed to be the largest in the New World, and only
exceeded by a few British and Continental establishments. The buildings have frontage upon
the Brandywine and Christine streams, as well as on the principal railroad. Here are a congeries
of two-story buildings, which are together fifteen hundred feet in length by a width of seventy
feet. Five miles of heating-pipes warm the rooms for a thousand workmen. There is something
logical and consecutive in the arrangement here, which makes it the best spot on the face of
the earth for an enthusiast who should wish to demonstrate, what all loyal Americans believe
in, the vast superiority of our form of railway-carriage. The cars proceed, in perfectly regular
order, from raw material to completion with the progressive march of a quadratic equation in
algebra. They seem to be arranged to demonstrate a theory. First the visitor sees lumber in
stock, a million feet of it; then, across one end of a long room, the mere sketch or transparent
diagram of a car; then, a car broadly filled in; and so on, up to the last glorious result,
upholstered with velvet and smelling of varnish. The cars are on rails, upon which they move,
side on, as if by a principle of growth, the undeveloped ones perpetually pushing up their
more forward predecessors, until the last perfect carriage is ejected from the fifteen-hundredth
foot of the building's length. Each one, gathering material and ornament as it rolls steadily
along in its crablike side-fashion, becomes at last a vehicle of perfect luxury; and then,
with one final plunge into the open air, it leaves its diversely-destined neighbors, and changes
for ever its sidelong motion for the forward roll which will carry it through a long existence.
A very large proportion of this company's work is on "palace" cars of the Pullman type, those
extravagances of luxury of which Europe is just now applying to Wilmington to learn the lesson.
Narrow-gauge cars for the West, in supplying which they are the pioneers, gaudy cars for South
America, and sturdy, solid ones for Canada, are all gently riding forward, side to side, in
this inexorable chain of destiny, and diverging at the front door on their widely-different
errands. Besides the manufacture of cars, the company builds every sort of coasters and steamers.
The class of workmen it employs is often of a particularly high grade. German painters quote
Kotzebue and sing the songs of Uhland as they weave their graceful harmonies of line and color
over the panels; and the sculptors who carve antique heads over the doorways of palace cars
make the place merry with studio jokes from the Berlin Academy. It is evident that a community
of artists like this, furnishing the æsthetic department to an immense manufactory, will also
elevate the tone of the industrial society outside, if they can but be kept free from vice
and supplied with means of culture; more of which anon. Meantime, as a kind of standard of
what the manufacturers themselves arrive at in prosecuting the amenities of life, we will quote
the fine residence of Mr. Job Jackson, a magnate of the company.

The wheel on which the car is mounted is of course another specialty, turned off in another
manufactory. We leave the rooms where the work goes on with easy smoothness like a demonstration
in a lecture-hall, and come to raging, roaring, deafening furnaces and hammers. The hollow-chested
artists give way to cyclops. Here we are in the Lobdell Car-wheel Company's premises. Negligently
leaning up against each other, like wafers in the tray of an ink-stand, are wheels that will
presently whiz over the landscapes of Russia, of Mexico, of England; wheels that will behave
rashly and heat their axles; wheels that will lie turned up in the air at the bottoms of viaducts;
and wheels that in various ways will see astonishing adventures, because in railway-transit
there are telescopings and wheels within wheels. The English and the foreign trade of the Lobdell
Company is due to its manufacture of wheels in the material or process lately known as chilled
iron. This manufacture has not yet penetrated the British intellect. Take the foreman of an
English car-manufactory, tell him that you will supply him a wheel about as durable as a wheel
with a steel tire at less than half the cost, and he will laugh at you for an impudent idiot.
But they use our wheels. The "chilling" of iron, when poured into a mould partly iron-faced,
is very singular: as the melted metal hardens against the metallic boundary, its granulation
changes to a certain depth, and the outside becomes excessively strong: species of crystals
seem to form, presenting their ends to the surface, and meeting the wear and tear there to
be experienced. The use of this fact secures, in many manufactures, a hardness approaching
that of steel, without increase of cost. This company employs the process both for car-wheels
and for the large cylinders (or "rolls") used in paper-mills. It is not to be supposed that
the work is all rude and rough, like ordinary iron casting. The polishing of the large cylinders
almost suggests diamond-cutting, it is so fine. So true is the finish that a pair of these
broad rolls, perhaps five feet across, may be approached so near each other that the light
showing between them is decomposed: a blade of blue or violet light, inexpressibly thin and
of the width of the cylinders, passes through the entire distance. As for the "chilling" of
iron, it was applied first to wheels in Baltimore, in 1833, by Mr. Ross Winans; and then, during
the same year, Mr. Bonney and his nephew, George G. Lobdell, established the business we see,
which has gradually grown to its present capacity of three hundred wheels per day.

The use of such cylinders as we have just seen under the difficult process of polishing is
only understood when we explore some large paper-mill, where they take the place of the old-fashioned
frame of wire gauze which produced the hand-made paper. We may select the splendid works of
Messrs. Jessup & Moore on the Brandywine. Our welcome is sure to be a cordial one, for among
the largest customers of the firm are the publishers of Lippincott's Magazine. The process
of paper-making by the Fourdrinier machine was so fully explained in our Number for last November
that it is useless now to repeat the details. But it would never do to leave the Brandywine
without a glance at least at one of its principal manufactures. The mill of Jessup & Moore
uses the strength of the torrent as an auxiliary to its steam-power of seven hundred and fifty
horses. The machinery is made by Pusey, Jones & Co., whose iron ships and machine-shops we
have already examined: the rolls of admirable accuracy are from the shops of J. Morton Poole
& Co. The paper-making process--the vast revolving boiler of twelve feet by twenty-six; the
countless sacks of filthy rags, that have clothed peasants of the Black Forest, beggars on
the steps of St. Peter's and Egyptian fellahs; their reduction to purity, and hardening from
pulp to snowy continuities of endless, marginless paper,--all this is of rare interest in the
watching, but has been told until the public is satiated. We leave the banks of the Brandywine
and the wharves of Christine, and try to lose ourselves in the thickly-built heart of the city.

Even here the implacable business spirit exhibits itself at every turn. In place of the placid
millers and quaint refugees of the last century at their doors, we see the shops, the storehouses
of manufacturers' supplies, the hotel and the theatre; and, pervading all, the vast throng
of artisans, providing such problems of local government and education as the last century
never dreamed of.

In almost all the industries of the city you are struck by the ancestral aspect of the trades,
the continuance of a business from father to son, or the gradual change of firms by the absorption
of partners. Boughman, Thomas & Co., established in a handsome, modern-looking bookstore, represent
a business as old as 1793, uninterrupted since the time when the founder, James Wilson, hung
the sign of Shakespeare at his door. The young girl of the period, who goes to their place
from one of the model seminaries of which Wilmington is so full to buy a little paper for confidential
notes or perhaps a delicate valentine, sees the old brown advertisement framed against the
wall, and behind it, in sign-painting of her great-grandfather's time, the head of him who
wrote Romeo and Juliet.

While in this literary vein we would say a word of the newspapers. These, the true finger-posts
of thought in a community, are apt in manufacturing cities to be conservative and timid, as
trade is timid. The very special attitude of Wilmington, however--a Yankee town in perpetual
protest with a Bourbon State--has inspired its press with peculiar political energy. No more
vehement Republican organ can be found in the land, for instance, than the Wilmington Commercial:
it is not in its columns that you will see ingenious defences of the whipping-post at Newcastle
or of the crushing taxes levied at Dover, whereby a lazy State feeds greedily upon a hard-working
metropolis. The Commercial (Jenkins & Atkinson) is a staunch Administration sheet, sound on
the subject of industrial protection, and highly appreciated by the manufacturers. Founded
in 1866, it was, we believe, the sole daily until eighteen months ago, when some of the sober-sided
weeklies began to understand that they must bestir themselves and put forth a diurnal appearance.
The Gazette (C. P. Johnson), a paper nearly one hundred years old, now appears daily, and expresses
the opinions of the State Assembly, where the Senate has but a single Republican member, and
the House of Representatives stands fourteen Democrats to seven Republicans. Here the conservative
thought of Kent and Sussex counties is kneaded up into the requisite coherency and eloquence.
Every Evening (Croasdale & Cameron), a smart paper without political bias, flies around the
city as the shadows begin to lengthen, selling at one cent a sheet, and liked by everybody.

To be candid, however, we do not suspect that this unique old city thinks through its newspapers.
The circumstances here are so peculiar, the neighborhood so close, activity so concentrated,
and the circumjacent neighborhood so little congenial, that an order of things has been established
unusual in modern times. Mind acts on mind by personal contact; the strong men meet and support
each other; the Board of Trade assembles daily in beautiful rooms, and discusses every interest
as quickly as it arises. It is like the order of things of old, ere the press and telegraph
undertook to express our views before we had formed them ourselves. We are reminded of the
guilds of labor in ancient Flanders or the fondachi of Venice. The State of Delaware, meanwhile,
comes up and looks in at the windows, only half satisfied with the rapid fortunes making by
the civic trades. What the Delaware yeomen know is, that they have broad acres of sunny land,
on which they are perpetually wanting advances of money. They therefore instruct their legislators
to fix a legal rate of interest, and to fix it low. The abuse which naturally follows on this
blind policy is, that the wealth created by the splendid industries of Wilmington is constantly
leaving the State to seek investment where usury is not kept down by old-fashioned legislation.
Richard Burton, the Anatomist of Melancholy, saw a somewhat similar state of things among the
unproductive and ale-tippling scholars with whom he lived at Oxford, but he was keen enough
to feel an envy of the livelier marts of commerce. (continues the mortified Englishman), "some
few excepted, we live wholly by tippling-inns and ale-houses."

The average Delawarean of 1873 is the average Oxford gossip of 1620, with the scholarship left
out. But he has the unfortunate advantage for mischief that he is in a position to enact laws
over the producers of "all curious works." These anomalies, however, must soon pass away with
the march of the age, leaving Wilmington less individual perhaps, but more free.

How deftly, by the by, Burton picks up the distinction between an inland city, living by handicraft,
and a port city, handling weighty materials and feeding freely on commerce! His livers by their
finger-ends are especially "those within the land." Just so the great capital of France, arbitrarily
concentred amongst her provinces, and deprived of a port, can only thrive by her exceptional
genius in fine and easily-moved articles de Paris. The site now under our consideration, however,
means to have no such one-sided success. If her horoscope be not cast amiss, this American
Glasgow will both make whatever human ingenuity can make, and she will also distribute. One
of the first things she intends to do is to tap the stream of food, fuel and lumber destined
for the South, and now laid up in the winter in Philadelphia by the closing of the Delaware,
and send it to the Southern consumer by her cheap water-transport. Connected with this enterprise
will be the multiplication of her steam colliers, ultimately scattering the crop of breadstuffs
to the South Atlantic and Gulf States (if not the Eastern), and coming home with ballast of
the varied iron ores those States abound in. When Delaware Bay begins to be whitened with the
sails of returning coal-vessels, or lashed with the wheels of steam carriers, bringing in the
oxides and magnetite ores of North Carolina and the hematite and other varieties of the extreme
South, to mix with the rail-brought ores of interior localities, then Wilmington proposes to
be the chosen centre of industry in cast iron. This production, it is now well understood,
is no longer carried on most advantageously in the neighborhood of any one great natural deposit
of ore. The important thing is to be at a meeting of all varieties of the metal: chemistry
then selects the proportions for mixture, and the best stock is produced with scarcely any
greater expense than the lowest grade. The situation at the head of Delaware Bay is one where
every choice of the ores can be easily swept together by rail or water. It also controls fuel,
by both means of carriage, from either of the great anthracite regions--a matter of special
importance in this time of "strikes," as the operatives of both districts rarely throw up work
at the same time. Wilmington thus proposes to obtain its iron at three dollars per ton less
than Pittsburg.

To properly digest these advantages, the city needs a large furnace, centrally located, to
work for all the foundries and forges of the place. This construction is now being earnestly
advocated, and will doubtless soon take form.

Thus we see the northernmost of the slave-State cities leaping up to catch first the advantages
of perfect commercial union under the new regime. Affiliated with the South, inspired by the
North, we should watch her as a standard and a type.

Meantime, her labor problem, as a city crammed with proletarians, she meets with consummate
tranquillity. The paternal relations between the good old Brandywine millers and their journeymen
are continued through the immense operations of the present day. A singular harmony has thus
far subsisted between employers and employed: the prosperity and calm which travelers used
to praise among the operatives of New England mills are perhaps now best seen here. To this
result both Nature and man contribute. The country round about is so bounteous, is such a garden,
that the pay of the workman represents a far higher grade of social life than anywhere else
in manufacturing regions. Rents so far are low, but a beneficent system is in active operation
amongst the working-classes which helps a man to own his own house, and avoid the teasing periodical
drain of rent.

This is the associative system, here in faultless operation, by which the fragments of a large
piece of ground are paid for by degrees and cleared of all incumbrance in eight or nine years
by the profit on the contributed moneys. This plan is assisted by the best men in the town,
who participate in the associations, receive themselves a reasonable profit, and supply the
credit and advantages necessary for the safety of wholesale enterprises. They have thus far
worked with their workmen for the latter's profit, with perfect honor and without a stain of
scandal. The great advantage, after all, is to themselves; for a workman owning his own home,
accumulating comforts and a family, is indissolubly tied to the city and its peaceful order.

Various plans for the improvement of the workmen are afoot, including a "Holly-Tree Inn" for
the supply of harmless refreshment and evening relaxation, the ground for which is bought and
a stock-company forming. A public park, for which a beautiful stretch of the Brandywine, on
Adams street and north of Levering Avenue, is recommended, is already engaging the attention
of the citizens as a necessary provision. A "fountain society" is in active operation, offering
cool, wholesome drink to the thirsty workman and the tired beast: the principal of its fountain-structures
forms a memorial monument to a young gentleman who had distinguished himself by his liberality
in preparing scientific lectures for the free entertainment of the working public. Shut up
in the public hall among the materials of his lecture, he was found dead from the result of
some solitary experiment--slain by his own kindness. A rich monument to the soldiers and sailors
slain in the civil war was unveiled in 1871: it is formed of a pillar from the old United States
Bank, surmounted by an eagle cast from captured cannon.

But the best thing a manufacturing town can do for her workman is to educate his children.
During the old aristocratic days of Wilmington she was satisfied with the reputation of her
private tutors and of her young ladies' seminaries, where "sweet girl-graduates in their golden
hair" cultivated cheeks like the surrounding peaches, while they learned Shakespeare, musical
glasses and the use of the globes. It was not until 1852 that the Delaware Legislature chartered
a board of education for the town. In these twenty years fifteen schools have been put up,
with five thousand attenders. Schoolhouse No. 1, shown in the illustration, accommodates four
hundred and thirty-six pupils, and furnishes an education, in the words of the late Bishop
Potter, "good enough for the richest and cheap enough for the poorest."

The choice streets of the city are filling up with tasteful residences. As a specimen we present
the house of Colonel McComb, an old favorite of Wilmington, where his familiar appellation
of "Harry McComb" is as often uttered day by day as it was at Washington during the exposure
by its owner of Congressional honesty and piety--or magpiety.

A hotel of the first class has been erected, and baptized with the commemorative name of the
Clayton House. It has one hundred and five chambers and every improvement. A very characteristic
fact, showing the spirit of integrity and goodness which here travels hand in hand with modern
enterprise, is that the owners sacrificed full three-quarters of the rent they could have obtained,
in order to keep it pledged as a temperance house. Another elegant building has been put up
by the Masonic fraternity for their own purposes and those of the Board of Trade, etc., including
a handsome opera-house on the ground floor. The auditorium is praised for its acoustic properties
by Parepa-Rosa, Wallack, Davenport and other performers, seats about fifteen hundred, and is
furnished with the inevitable drop-curtain by Russell Smith. Faced with iron painted white,
and very rich in mouldings and ornaments, the building presents as cheery a front to enter
as any similar place of attraction known to the American tourist. The Masonic rooms above,
and those of the Board of Trade, Historical Society, etc., are provided with every beauty and
comfort.

Here are the indications of a prospering, laboring, thinking, virtuous city of the New World.
We have tried to sketch it both as a city with a past and a city with a future. Could we have
selected one for illustration that would be a better or sharper concentration of all that is
good in American life?

MARIE FAMETTE AND HER LOVERS.

I.

Marie Famette is the prettiest girl in the market-place of Aubette. Her eyes are of such a
sweet, soft blue, deeply shaded by long black lashes: her eyebrows are not black, but they
are of a much darker tint than her hair, which (so much of it as can be seen under her full
white cap-border) is a golden yellow. But it is not her eyes and her hair that make Marie so
attractive: she has charmed young and old alike ever since she came, a toddling damsel of two
years, and took her place beside her mother in the market-place of Aubette.

Madame Famette's was the best fruit-stall of the market. No one else could show such baskets
of peaches and hampers of pears; and as to the citrouilles and potirons, their reputation was
so established that by ten o'clock there was little to be seen of them among the glowing vegetables
which decked the stall. Such radishes were not to be seen elsewhere--white and purple, as thick
as carrots; and the carrots themselves like lumps of red gold, lying nestling beneath their
feathered tops or setting off the creamy whiteness of the cauliflowers ranged in a formal row
in front of them.

But Marie had always eclipsed all other beauty in the stall, and now that she had grown too
big to be patted on the cheek and kissed by grown-up admirers, she had a host of victims in
the sturdy young countrymen who came in to Aubette--either to bring mothers and sisters with
their produce or to purchase for themselves.

Madame Famette has weak health, and lately Marie comes often to the market by herself, and
is able to flirt to her heart's content, unchecked by her mother's presence. She is so bright,
so arch, so ready with a sparkling answer, that it is no wonder her stall is always thronged
and that her fruit and her vegetables disappear so rapidly.

There is an extra buzz in the market to-day. It is September, the epoch of the Mascaret, for
the dreaded flood-tide seldom visits the Seine more than twice a year, and always draws dwellers
in the neighboring towns to see its autumn fury. There is an influx of strange faces in the
little place beneath the richly-sculptured spire of Notre Dame--the cathedral of Aubette, as
strangers call it, although it is only the parish church of the quaint little town--and a certain
extra excitement is communicated to the settlers under the canvas-covered booths and to the
humbler sellers of wares in baskets. Mademoiselle Lesage, a short, plump young woman dressed
in black, flits in and out of the chattering crowd more busily than usual. Mademoiselle holds
herself of a rank above the country-folk who bring in their poultry and garden produce to Aubette.
In token of this she wears a round black mushroom-shaped hat, and a holland apron with two
deep pockets in virtue of her office; for Mademoiselle Lesage has an enterprising spirit. She
found herself at thirty years old left alone in the world with an ugly face and with an insufficient
"dot." Mademoiselle Lesage is ambitious: she does not care to marry a very poor man, and she
has managed to give the town council of Aubette such security that it allows her to farm the
market yearly for some hundreds of francs. Watch her collecting her dues. She goes rapidly
from stall to stall, jingling her pockets, laughing and chatting with the farmers' wives, all
the time keeping a hawk's eye on the basket-carriers, not one of whom may presume to sell so
much as an onion without the weekly toll of one sou. She darts in and out among them, and her
pockets swell out in front as if they were stuffed with apples.

She has left Marie Famette's stall till the last. She crosses over to it now as quickly as
she can go, but there is no means of darting in and out here, as there was just now among the
basket-women. Old Floris Marceau has covered a good-sized space with his heap of green and
yellow melons, and he stands behind these marchandéing, gesticulating, brandishing the knife
with which he slices his citrouilles and inveighing against the folly of his customers. "Will
mam'selle believe," he says, addressing her as she approaches, and wiping his knife on his
often-patched blouse, "they come to buy fruit of a respectable vegetable-seller and they don't
know the price of a melon? Ten sous for a cantaloupe like that!" His blue eyes gleamed furiously
under his frowning gray eyebrows. "Ten sous! I told them to be off and buy chickens." He broke
into a laugh, and pointed to a tall, bent old gentleman, who seemed covered with confusion
at this public rebuke, and sidled his way out of the throng without attempting an answer.

"Buy a turkey, m'sieur?" A smiling, dark-eyed woman in a close-setting white cap went on with
the joke and pointed to her basket, but the old gentleman had had enough: he hurried away with
a rueful glance at the basket in which, divided only by the handle, sat two fat turkey poults
and two chickens. One of the turkeys stirred and got a wing free, but it was remorselessly
tucked in again and reduced to passive endurance, with "Keep quiet then, ne soyez pas bête."

Mademoiselle Lesage approaches Marie's stall at a leisurely pace: she wishes to see her ground
before she speaks. By the extra sweetness of her smile one might suppose that mademoiselle
loved the gay little beauty: "Bonjour, Marie. Madame Famette trusts you alone again, I see?"

Marie does exactly that which Mademoiselle Lesage intended to make her do: she starts violently
and she looks annoyed.

Elise Lesage glances quickly from Marie to the two young men who stand beside her. One of these,
tall, well-dressed, with a Jewish face, and a sparkling pin in his brilliant blue scarf, is
Alphonse Poiseau, the son of Monsieur Poiseau of the large clockmaker's and jeweler's shop
at the corner of the place next the church: the other is Nicolas Marais, a handsome, gypsy-looking
fellow with no decided occupation. He is sometimes at work on his uncle's farm at Vatteville,
and when he falls out with his uncle and tires of Vatteville he comes across the Seine and
gets employed by Léon Roussel, the chief timber-merchant of Aubette.

People say that old Marais, the miser of Vatteville, means to make Nicolas his heir; but Nicolas
takes no pains to please the old man: he goes here and there at his pleasure, a favorite wherever
he shows his handsome dark eyes and his saucy smile. The men like him as much as the women
do, he has such a ready, amusing tongue, and he never says a spiteful word; so that more than
one of the keen, observant poultry-sellers standing beside their baskets near Marie's stall
have commented on the scowl with which for full five minutes Léon Roussel has regarded Nicolas.
Léon Roussel is a middle-sized, in no way remarkable-looking person, with honest brown eyes
and a square, sensible face. His father, the wealthy timber-merchant on the Yvetôt road, died
when he was a boy, and Léon is one of the most prosperous citizens of Aubette, and well thought
of by all. Léon is ostensibly in consultation with Monsieur Houlard, tailor and town councillor,
but as he stands at the worthy's shop-door he is raised above the level of the place, and is
exactly opposite the stall of Marie Famette.

"Nicolas is out of favor with Monsieur Roussel: he has worked badly in the lumber-yard," says
La Mère Robillard.

"Chut! chut!" says her gossip, Madelaine Manget, and she gives at the same time a pat to a
refractory chicken. "Nicolas looks too hard at Marie Famette. Ma foi! there are men in the
manger as well as dogs. If Monsieur Léon wants Marie to be for his eyes only, why does he not
ask for her and marry her, the proud simpleton?"

"Ah, but look you, Madelaine, Léon is not proud: he never turns a poor man from his door without
a morsel to quiet hunger, and he must be clever or his business would not prosper."

La Mère Manget shrugs her shoulders. "Will you then not buy turkeys at eleven francs the couple,
ma belle dame?" she cries shrilly to a passer-by.

While Marie Famette recovers herself, Nicolas answers Mam'selle Lesage. "Pardon, Mam'selle
Lesage, but Mam'selle Marie is not alone," he says, raising his hat with exquisite politeness--Alphonse
Poiseau tries to follow suit, but his bow is stiff and pompous--"the whole market is her body-guard,
and she permits Monsieur Poiseau and myself to act as sentinels." He throws an insinuating
glance at Marie, which deepens the gloom on Léon Roussel's face.

Elise Lesage has taken in the whole situation, and she knows exactly where to look for the
timber-merchant. An uneasy consciousness makes Marie follow her glance: she looks red and confused
when she sees Léon's stern, disapproving face. His eyes are fixed on her as she looks across,
but he withdraws them instantly and turns to Monsieur Houlard.

Marie bites her pretty red under-lip: she can hardly keep from crying: "If we were alone and
he scolded me, I would not mind; but he has no right to frown at me before the whole town.
It is enough to compromise me. It will be said presently that I am a bold girl, while I only
amuse myself, and never move a step from my stall to speak to any one. It is too bad!"

She gulps down a lump in her throat, and gives Nicolas Marais a smile that makes the clockmaker
long to knock his rival's head against the gray buttress of the old church.

"Sentinels!" Elise Lesage laughs. "Is Marie afraid, then, that some one will steal her?"

"Marie is afraid of nothing, Mademoiselle Lesage." The little beauty is glad to be able to
vent her vexation on some one. "What right has she to call me Marie?" she says to Nicolas in
a very audible under-tone.

Mademoiselle's black eyes close till they look like lines: Marie does not see her face, but
Nicolas Marais shivers, he hardly knows why.

A restraint has come over the merry trio, and Nicolas abhors restraint. "Tiens!" he says carelessly,
"there is a fresh bevy of basket-women, Mam'selle Lesage."

Elise darts off like a greyhound, and Marie forgets her vexation and laughs out merrily at
Nicolas's ruse: "She is such a busybody!" The girl glances across to see what has become of
Léon: he is talking to Mademoiselle Lesage.

Alphonse Poiseau has kept silence, but he has observed. "I should not like to offend mam'selle,"
he says, "her eyes are so like a snake's."

II.

Market has come and gone again. Marie Famette was not happy as she went home last Saturday,
but to-day her heart aches sorely as she goes along the dusty road to St. Gertrude. Last Saturday
was the first market-day this year that Léon Roussel has not helped her into her cart and taken
a friendly leave of her; but he disappeared before market was over, and to-day he was not there
at all.

"And he might have walked home with me!" Tears are in poor little Marie's eyes. Léon Roussel
has seemed her own special property, and he has not been to her mother's house for a fortnight.
"And if he had been at market to-day, he would have been content with me: poor Nicolas must
be ill indeed to stay away from market. Ma foi! I have been dull alone. Elise Lesage was civil,
for a wonder: I hope she will give old Marais's note safely to his nephew. I wonder why she
goes to see Nicolas?"

As she says the word a strange foreboding seizes Marie: she cannot tell what causes it, but
her old dislike to Elise rises up, mingled with a kind of fear. "I ought to have given Nicolas
the note myself; and yet--"

The road is very long and very dusty to-day: it is never an interesting way out of Aubette,
except that being cut on the hillside it is raised high, the little river meandering through
the osier meadows on the left, and also commands a fine view of the beautiful old church. But
Marie does not turn back to look at the church: her heart is too heavy to take interest in
anything out of herself. She has left the cart behind to bring out crockery and some new chairs
which she has purchased for her mother, and she wishes she had stayed in Aubette till her cargo
was packed. All at once a new thought comes, and her eyes brighten. A wood clothes the hilly
side of the road, but on the left there is a steep descent into the valley, and the road is
bordered either by scattered cottages or by an irregular hawthorn hedge. A little way on there
is a gap in this hedge, and looking down there is a long steep flight of steps with wooden
edges. At the foot stands a good-sized house divided now into several cottages. The walls are
half-timbered with wood set crosswise in the plaster between two straight rows. Ladders, iron
hoops and a bird-cage hang against the wall, and over the door is a wooden shelf with scarlet
geraniums. There is a desolate garden divided into three by a criss-cross fence and a hedge,
and over the last a huge orange citrouille has clambered and lies perched on the top.

Marie knows that Nicolas Marais sometimes lodges in one of the cottages, but she knows too
that the property belongs to Léon Roussel, and that he lives close by. A blush comes to the
girl's cheeks: she may see Léon there. She stops and looks down: Elise Lesage is coming out
of the doorway, but she is talking over her shoulder to some one behind her. Marie sees her
put her fingers into one of the brown holland pockets, pull out a note and give it to her companion.

Marie draws a deep breath: "How I wronged her! Ever since I gave her that note I have felt
anxious and troubled. She seems so spiteful to me that I feared she might somehow get me into
trouble with it, and yet I don't know how."

There were footsteps coming along the road, but Marie did not look round: in the quick revulsion
of feeling toward Elise she was eager to make atonement. She leaned on the hand-rail that went
down the steps, waiting for Mademoiselle Lesage: if she had listened she would have noticed
that the footsteps had come nearer and had suddenly ceased.

Nicolas Marais came forward out of the cottage, and then Elise looked up and saw Marie. She
smiled and nodded. "I am coming," she called up in her rasping voice; and she did seem in high
haste to get to Marie Famette, but Marie saw that she looked beyond her at some one or something
else. The girl looked over her shoulder, and there was Léon Roussel, but he did not care to
look at her. His eyes were fixed sternly on Nicolas Marais, but Nicolas did not seem to care
for his employer's anger: he was smiling rapturously up at Marie, and as she now looked at
him he first kissed his hand and then put the note to his lips and kissed it twice.

Marie grew crimson. Elise, who had just reached the top of the steps, laughed, and Léon Roussel
stood an instant pale and defiant, and then turned back toward Aubette.

"Stay, stay, Monsieur Léon!" Elise darted after him; then, stopping suddenly, she nodded back
at Marie: "Stop and talk to Nicolas, mon enfant: I will make it all right for you with Monsieur
Roussel;" and she hurried on in pursuit.

But Marie was too angry with Nicolas to give him even a moment: "How dare he kiss his hand
to me? And oh, Léon will think that I wrote that note to him, and how can I ever tell him the
truth? Will Elise Lesage tell him?"

She had just a faint hope; and then she reproached herself. Why should not Mademoiselle Lesage
tell the truth? She was cross and spiteful, but then, poor thing! she was old and ugly. "And
it may be," Marie thought, "that one is not half thankful enough for one's gifts, and that
it is very irritating to be plain. It is Alphonse Poiseau who has made me think evil of Elise,
and one should not cherish evil thoughts."

Marie went home happier and lighter-hearted: that little glimpse of Léon had quieted the sore
longing at her heart, and at first the joy of having seen him made her dwell less on his stern
looks and his avoidance of herself.

She came to the broad grassed turning that leads off the main road to St. Gertrude. A saddled
donkey was grazing on one side, and on the other an old woman sat on a stone post. She jumped
up when she saw Marie. She had looked tall as she sat: she was as broad as she was long now
she stood erect in her dark striped gown and black jacket, and white cap with its plain border
and lappets pinned together over her forehead.

"Well, well, well!" She spoke in a short bustling voice--a voice that would have been cheering
if it had been less restless. "Hast thou then seen Léon Roussel, Marie? Hast thou learned the
reason of his absence?"

Marie's tender, sweet look vanished: she tossed her pretty head and pouted: "Léon was not at
the market, but I saw him as I came home; only he was not close to me, so we did not speak."

"Didst thou see that vaurien Nicolas?"

"Yes, I saw him."

Marie blushed, and her mother burst out into angry words: "Foolish, trifling child that thou
art! thou lovest that black-eyed gypsy boy; and for him, the idle vagabond, thou hast flung
away the best parti in Aubette. Ciel! what do I say? In Bolbec itself there is no one with
better prospects than Léon Roussel." Madame Famette always failed in managing her daughter.

Marie smiled and kept down her indignation. "I hardly know that," she said: "old Marais will
make Nicolas his heir, and there is no saying how rich a miser is." She crossed the road, caught
the donkey by the bridle, and held him ready for her mother to mount.

Madame Famette went on grumbling, but Mouton the donkey soon drew her anger on himself; and
by the time the three reached the triangle of gray, half-timbered cottages which surround the
old church of St. Gertrude, the easy, sieve-like nature of the woman had recovered from its
vexation.

"Holà, Jeanne, Jeanne! run there and take Mouton from Mam'selle Marie, who is tired with the
market. Come, thou, mon cher, and tell me the news." Madame Famette rolled off her donkey,
and then rolled on into the house.

III.

Marie Famette was ill--much too ill to go to market.

"I will go. Do not vex thyself, my child, and I will see our good doctor and bring thee back
a tisane." The bustling woman, with her blue eyes and light eyelashes, bent down and kissed
Marie's forehead, and then departed.

"A tisane!" The bright blue eyes were so dull and languid now, half closed by the heavy white
eyelids. "I wonder if even Doctor Guéroult is wise enough to cure the heart when it aches like
mine? Ah, Léon, I did not think you could be so hard, so cruel; and how could he know, how
could he see into my heart, while I stood laughing so foolishly with Nicolas and Monsieur Poiseau?
If Elise Lesage had not teased me about Léon, it might have been different, but I could not
let her think I cared for him after what she said." She leaned back her head and cried bitterly.

Madame Famette was more serious than usual on her way to the market. Matters were getting tangled,
she thought. Léon Roussel had begun to be a regular Sunday visitor at the cottage, and now
three weeks and more had gone by and he had not come; and a gossip who had walked home from
church with her overnight had told Madame Famette that Mam'selle Lesage was going to marry
a Monsieur Roussel: whether it was Léon or a Monsieur Roussel of some other place than Aubette
her gossip could not affirm; and in this uncertainty the mother's heart was troubled. She was
very proud of Marie's beauty and graceful ways, and she had thought it a just tribute when
the young timber-merchant had asked her permission to call at the cottage; and now, just when
she had been expecting that his aunt, La Mère Thérèse, the superior of the Convent du Sacré
Coeur in Aubette, would send for her in order that the demand for her daughter's hand and the
preliminaries of the marriage might be settled, had come first Léon Roussel's strange absence
and the visits of Nicolas Marais, and now the gossip about Elise Lesage.

"I will know the right of it to-day," Madame Famette thinks, and she lashes out at Mouton in
an unusual fashion.

The first customer at her stall is Madame Houlard, the wife of the tailor and town councillor.
"How is Marie?" she says: "the market does not seem itself without Marie Famette."

Madame Famette smiles, but she sighs too: "My poor little girl is ill;" and then her eyes rove
round the market, and fix on Mademoiselle Lesage bustling in and out among her clients. "Have
you then heard that Elise Lesage is to be married?" she says in a low, cautious voice.

Madame Houlard's flat, good-tempered face grows troubled: "Ah yes, I have heard some talk;
and listen to that noisy fellow;" then she points to Floris Marceau, who is gesticulating and
vehement as usual.

She is surprised to find her arm tightly grasped by the large hand of the fruit-seller: "Madame
Houlard, tell me the truth: who is to marry with Elise Lesage?"

Madame Houlard leads a very tranquil life: her husband is the most placid man in Aubette, and
she has never had any children to disturb the calm of existence. She is ruffled and shocked
by Madame Famette's vehemence. She bridles and releases her plump arm: "Ma foi, my friend!
what will you? Gossip comes, and gossip goes. I believe all I hear--that is but convenable--but
then, look you, I am quite as willing to believe in the contradiction which so frequently follows.
One should never excite one's self about anything: be sure of this, my friend, it is bad for
the nerves. What is salsify a bundle to-day?"

Madame Famette, as has been said, has a sieve-like nature with regard to the passing away of
wrath, but still her anger is easily roused. "It would be simpler to tell me what you have
heard," she says in a very snappish accent. "When I want a lecture I can get it from monsieur
le curé."

Madame Houlard had felt unwilling to tell her news, but this aggravating sentence goaded it
out of her mouth: "It is to Monsieur Roussel, the timber-merchant, that Elise Lesage is to
be married: see, he is talking to her now." There is a slight tone of satisfaction in Madame
Houlard's smooth voice, and yet in her heart she is sorry for her friend's disappointment.
All the market-place of Aubette had given Léon Roussel to the charming Marie.

"Léon Roussel! Why, she is as old as he is--older; and, ma foi! how ugly! and her parents--no
one knows where they came from; and she--she is nothing but a money-grubber."

The day was tedious to Madame Famette. She tried to speak to Léon, but he avoided her with
a distant bow. There was not even Alphonse Poiseau to help her: only little Pierre Trotin came
and carried her baskets to the donkey-cart. She called at the doctor's house, but she could
not see him. Madame Famette's heart had not been so heavy since her husband died. "It is that
serpent"--she wiped her eyes on a huge blue-and-yellow pocket handkerchief--"who has done it
all; and my poor unsuspecting child has flirted with Nicolas, and made the way easy. Ciel!
what do I know? It is possible that Marie loves Nicolas, and is willing to throw herself away
on a vaurien with a pair of dark eyes; and the news will not grieve her as it has grieved me."

She met her servant Jeanne at the entrance of the road, and gave up the donkey-cart to her
care. Then she went on sorrowfully and silently to find Marie. The door stood ajar, just as
she had left it. She went in more quietly than usual, but Marie heard her. The girl sat just
where her mother had left her: the loaf of bread lay untouched. It was plain that Marie had
gone without breakfast. Her face was very pale, and her eyes fixed strainingly on her mother,
but she did not speak.

Madame Famette's vexation had made her cross, and Marie's pale face increased her trouble:
"How naughty thou art then, Marie! I set thee a knife and a plate: thou hadst but to stretch
out thy hand. Ciel! but the market tires!" She cut a slice of bread for her daughter, and then
she seated herself.

"Mother"--Marie bent forward and shaded her eyes with her hand--"didst thou see Léon Roussel?"

Madame's shoulders went up to her ears in a heave of disgust: "Thou mayest as well know it,
Marie: Léon Roussel is promised to Elise Lesage, and they were together in the market. See
what thy folly has caused!"

But Marie scarcely heard her mother's reproaches. The blood flew up to her face, and then it
left her paler than before. She bent lower--lower yet, until she overbalanced and fell like
a crushed lily at her mother's feet.

IV.

"How is Marie Famette?" Monsieur Houlard the tailor asks of Monsieur Guéroult the doctor of
Aubette, as he meets him hurrying through the Rue de la Boucherie.

"She is better, the poor child! but she must be careful this winter." Then, seeing Houlard
look anxious, the good doctor says, "But she is so far better that I have discontinued my visits:
I have given Marie leave to come to Aubette."

"That is good news," says Houlard as the doctor shoots past him, and the tailor tells the next
person he meets that Marie Famette is as well as ever, and is coming to market as usual.

It is Léon Roussel to whom he tells this, and Monsieur Houlard is pained at the young man's
want of interest.

"One would have thought," he says to his wife when he reaches his shop, "that Roussel was displeased
with Marie for recovering her health."

"Perhaps he thinks she will make a fool of herself, now she is well again, by marrying Nicolas
Marais: I hear they are lovers."

"It is a pity," says the dutiful husband. "Girls should not choose for themselves. You did
not, my dear, and that is why our life has gone so easily."

But Marie is not really as strong as the doctor pronounces her to be: her cheeks are hollow,
and the color on them is feverish and uncertain. If she could get away from home she would
have more chance of mending. Madame Famette's sorrow at her daughter's changed looks expands
itself in querulous remonstrance on the folly of flirting and on the good-for-nothing qualities
of Nicolas Marais. Nicolas has come to inquire for Marie, but Madame Famette has received him
so uncourteously that the poor fellow contents himself with hovering about on the chance of
meeting Marie alone. But he never sees her, although the rumor grows strong in St. Gertrude,
and is wafted on to Aubette, that Nicolas and Marie will be married as soon as she gets well
enough to see about wedding-clothes.

It is the beginning of October, a bright clear morning. The red and yellow leaves come swiftly
to the ground with a sudden snap from the twigs that held them: the rabbits move about briskly,
and a couple of field-mice in search of winter stores run across the road nearly under Marie's
feet. Marie's cheeks are rosy with the fresh, crisp air, but she does not look gay or happy.
Life seems to have got into a hard knot which the poor little girl finds no power to untie.
Market-day used to be a fête to Marie, but to-day she considers it a penance to be sent in
to Aubette. She is not going to hold her stall--ah no, she is not nearly strong enough for
such a task--but Madame Famette has a severe attack of rheumatism, and Jeanne cannot be trusted
to buy the weekly provision of groceries. Marie shrinks as she goes along at the thought of
meeting Léon Roussel. There is another thought, which she will not face--that it is possible
Léon and Elise Lesage will be together in the market-place. "I need not go into the Grande
Place at all," the poor child says. "I can get all I want in the Rue des Bons Enfants;" and
she goes there when she reaches Aubette.

But Marie has miscalculated her strength. She grows suddenly so white that Monsieur le Blanc,
the épicier of the Rue des Bons Enfants, takes her into his daughter's room and makes her lie
down on the little sofa. Marie lies there with widely-opened eyes, wondering how she shall
get back to St. Gertrude.

"You are to lie still till Thérèse comes back from market," the old man says, "and then she
will arrange about your going home."

Marie lies gazing dreamily at the blue-papered ceiling. "I used to think Thérèse le Blanc a
cross old maid," she ponders: "shall I be a cross old maid too?" And then the pale, stricken
girl holds up her thin hand and sighs: "I shall not be old: I shall die soon. Poor mother!
she will forgive Nicolas when I am gone away."

There is a bustle in the shop, but Marie does not heed it. She smiles when Thérèse comes in,
but she is too weak to talk--too weak to make any objection when she hears that a farmer who
lives some miles beyond St. Gertrude has undertaken to convey her in his huge green-hooded
wagon as far as the cross-road.

Thérèse stands over her while she eats a piece of bread and drinks a glass of wine, and then
the farmer, a stout old Norman in a gray blouse, helps her into the back of the wagon, and
makes a resting-place for her on some of the hay still left unsold, under the lofty arched roof.

V.

"Get up my friend, get up: you will reach Yvetôt sooner if I give you a lift than if you wait.
The diligence does not leave Aubette till six o'clock, remember, and my old horses get over
the ground surely if not quickly."

Marie rouses from a sort of doze, but she cannot see the farmer or the wayfarer to whom he
speaks: a pile of new fruit-baskets fills up the middle of the huge vehicle, and makes a wall
between Marie and the driving-seat.

"Well, mon gars, it is a long time since I saw you, and the town-gossip of Aubette tells me
more of your affairs than you ever condescend to inform your cousin of. Your mother was different,
Léon. Dame! I could never pass her door after your father died but she would stop my wagon
and ask me for just five minutes' counsel. But you young ones are all alike: the world has
got a new pivot, it seems, for this generation, and it will move round more easily when we
graybeards are all kicked out."

"I don't think so, for one." Marie had known she must hear Léon Roussel's voice, and yet her
heart throbbed at his first words. "But, my cousin, what is the news that thou hast learned
about me in Aubette?"

"Well, the news varies: sometimes I hear thee coupled with one girl, and then again with another,
till I do not know what to think, Léon. I am afraid thou art fickle."

There was a pause. Marie raised herself on one elbow and listened breathlessly: it never came
to her mind that she was listening to talk not intended for her ears.

"Well, man"--the farmer seemed nettled--"why not speak out and say thou art promised to old
Lesage's daughter?"

"Because I am not promised to her."

Marie stifled a sob. It seemed as if her heart could not much longer hold in its agitation,
she longed so intensely for the farmer's next question and for Léon's answer.

"Art thou promised to the beauty of the market, the little Marie?"

There was no pause this time. Léon's words came out rapidly with bitter emphasis: "Marie Famette
is going to marry Marais of Vatteville."

"Marry! Ma foi! I hear the girl is very ill. I forget--there is a sick girl in the wagon now."

It seemed to the listener that Léon spoke heedless of the farmer's last words: "Once again
the town-gossip has deceived you, Michel. I heard a week ago, and Houlard had just learned
it from the Doctor Guéroult, that Marie Famette is as well and gay as ever. I believe she has
come back to the market."

No reply. The silence that followed oppressed Marie: a sense of guilt stole over her. It was
not likely that old Michel Roussel knew who she was when he helped her into the wagon: she
remembered now that Léon had told her of his rich cousin at Yvetôt; she knew she must get out
soon, and then Léon would see her and know that she had heard him. She felt sick with shame.
Would it not have been more honest to have betrayed her presence? It was too late now. "And
I could not--I have not the courage." Marie crouched closer under the wall of baskets.

Suddenly, Léon spoke. "Well, Michel, I will get out here," he said.

The wagon stopped. Marie heard farewells exchanged, and then on they jogged again to St. Gertrude.

Marie's heart was suddenly stilled: its painful throbbing and fluttering had subsided--it sank
like lead. Léon was gone, and she had flung away her only chance of telling him that Nicolas
Marais never had been--never could be--more to her than a friend.

"Oh what a fool I am! I may often see him, but how can I say this? And just now the way was open!"

When Farmer Roussel stopped the wagon again, and came round to the back to help Marie out,
he found her sobbing bitterly.

"Here we are at St. Gertrude, but--Ma foi! but this is childish, ma belle," he said kindly,
"to go spoiling your pretty eyes because you feel ill. Courage! you will soon be well if you
eat and drink and keep a light heart." He helped her down tenderly, and shook both her hands
in his before he let her go. "Well," he said as he rolled up on to the seat, "I wonder I had
not asked for a kiss. She is rarely pretty, poor child!"

Marie stood still just where she had found her mother seated on that evening which it seemed
to the girl had begun all her misery; but till now through all there had been hope--the hope
given by disbelief in Léon's engagement to Elise Lesage. Now there was the sad, terrible certainty
that Léon believed her false. Marie knew that though she had never pledged faith, still her
eyes had shown Léon feelings which no other man had seen in them. For a moment she felt nerved
to a kind of desperation: she would go and seek Léon, and tell him the truth that some one
had set on foot this false report of her promise to Nicolas Marais. She turned again toward
the high-road, and then her heart sank. How could she seek Léon? He did not love her, and if
she made this confession would it not be a tacit owning of love for himself? The weight at
her heart seemed to burden her limbs: she dragged on toward home wearily and slowly.

The road turns suddenly into St. Gertrude, and takes a breathing-space at a sharp angle with
a breadth of grass, bordered by a clump of nut trees. Before Marie reached the nut trees she
saw Léon Roussel standing beside them. She stopped, but he had been waiting for her coming:
he came forward to meet her.

When he saw her face he looked grieved, but he spoke very coldly: "I have been to your cottage
to inquire for you"--he raised his hat, but he made no effort to take her hand--"and then I
heard you were expected home from Aubette. I did not know how ill you had been till to-day,
Marie: I had been told you were quite recovered."

His cold, hard manner wounded her: "Oh, I am better, thank you;" but as she spoke her sight
grew dizzy: she would have fallen if Léon had not caught her in his arms. She felt that he
clasped her closely for an instant, and then he loosed his hold.

"Thank you!" She freed herself. "I am better. I will go home now, Monsieur Roussel."

He took off his hat mechanically, and Marie turned toward St. Gertrude.

But she did not move: she had no power to go forward. An impulse stronger than her will was
holding her. She looked round: Léon had not moved--he stood with his eyes fixed on the ground.

"I must tell you something," she said. Léon started: he had never heard Marie speak in such
a humble tone. "I was in the wagon just now, and I listened to your talk with Monsieur Michel."
Her cheeks grew crimson. "But, Monsieur Roussel, you are in error about me. Nicolas Marais
is my friend"--Léon's face grew so stern that her eyes drooped and her voice faltered--"but
he will never be more to me. He has always been my friend."

Léon came close to her and took her hand: "Marie"--his voice was so harsh and severe that she
shrunk from him--"you must tell the truth, and you must not be angry if I doubt you. My child,
did I not see Nicolas kiss the letter you sent him, and look at you as he kissed it?"

"Did Elise Lesage tell you I wrote that letter?" But Marie's fear had left her. She smiled
up at her lover, once more his own arch, bright Marie: "How dared you believe her, Léon? I
have a great mind not to tell you the truth."

But Léon Roussel was satisfied, for while she spoke his arm had folded round her again, and
he was much too happy to trouble himself about Nicolas Marais.

       *       *       *       *       *

Léon and Marie are to be married in November, and Mam'selle Lesage has been so indisposed that
for two consecutive Saturdays she has sent a deputy to collect sous in the market of Aubette.

KATHARINE S. MACQUOID.

SALMON FISHING IN CANADA.

Fifty years ago, when the manners and habits of the Americans were very different from what
they now are, there lived in Boston two gentlemen so far in advance of their age as to devote
much time to shooting and fishing. These pursuits were denounced by the Puritans and their
descendants as a sinful waste of time, and there is a letter extant from one of the early Massachusetts
governors, in which he reproaches himself for indulging in "fowling," the rather because, as
he confesses, he failed to get any game. These two bold Bostonians were wont to go to Scotland
for salmon-fishing, having a belief that the salmon of the American rivers were too uncultivated
in their taste to rise at a fly. However this may have been in 1820, the salmon of the Dominion
are to-day as open to the attractions of a well-tied combination of feathers and pig's-wool,
as those of the rivers of Norway or Scotland; and as, under the protection which the Canadian
rivers now enjoy, the fish are becoming plentiful, sport is offered in the numerous streams
which flow into the St. Lawrence, the Bays of Chaleur and Miramichi, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
probably superior to any now to be found elsewhere.

Having last year paid a visit to one of these beautiful rivers, I propose to give an account
of my introduction to the art and mystery of salmon-fishing, to the end that other anglers,
whose exploits have hitherto been confined to the capture of a pound trout or a four-pound
pickerel, may know the joy of feeling the rush of a twenty-pound salmon fresh run from the
sea--the most brilliant, active and vigorous of the finny tribes, the king of the river, using
the term in its original sense--the strongest, the ablest, the most cunning. A late writer
on English field-sports says: "I assert that there is no single moment with horse or gun into
which is concentrated such a thrill of hope, fear, expectation and exultation as that of the
rise and successful striking of a heavy salmon."

And first, let me say something of the system of protection to these fisheries adopted by the
Canadian government, which renders this sport possible. Finding that under the constant slaughter
of salmon and trout, by the Indians with spears and by the whites with nets, the fish were
becoming not only scarce, but in danger of extinction, the government interfered, and a few
years ago passed laws the effects of which are already apparent. Certainly, a paternal government
is sometimes a good thing. On our side the line a ring of wealthy men, with a large capital
in nets, seines, pounds, etc., will, as has been seen in Rhode Island, depopulate a coast in
a few years of its food-fishes, leaving nothing for increase; and when the poor fishermen,
whose living depends on these free gifts of God, ask for protection from the legislature, the
ring is too powerful, one of its members being perhaps governor of the State.

In the year 1858 the colonial government resumed possession of all the salmon and sea-trout
fisheries in Lower Canada, and after the enactment of a protective law offered them for lease
by public tender. A list is given of sixty-seven salmon rivers which flow into the St. Lawrence
and the Saguenay, and of nine which flow into the Bay of Chaleur. There are also tributaries
of these, making over one hundred rivers which by this time contain salmon, and many of them
in great abundance. Licenses are granted by the government for rod-fishing in these rivers
on payment of sums ranging from one hundred to five hundred dollars the season for a river,
according to its size, accessibility, etc. These rivers are generally taken by parties of anglers,
but of late I learn that licenses for single rods have been granted, so that all may be accommodated.
Applications for a river or part of one can be made to Mr. William F. Whitcher of Ottawa, who
is at the head of the Fisheries Department. Our party of four persons had obtained, through
the courtesy of Messrs. Brydges and Fleming of the Intercolonial Railway of Canada, the upper
part of the Restigouche, a river flowing into the Bay of Chaleur, and one of the best in the
Dominion. Three of us had never killed a salmon, though we were familiar with other kinds of
fishing. We had, however, for teacher one who for fifty years had been a salmon-fisher--first
as a boy in Ireland, and since that for many years in Canada, in most of whose rivers he had
killed salmon. As an angler he was a thorough artist, as a woodsman he was an expert, and as
a companion he was most agreeable. Among the Indians, who have the habit of naming every person
from some personal trait, he was known as "the Kingfisher," and by that name I shall call him.
The second of our party, who procured the right of fishing the Restigouche, and made up the
party, I shall call Rodman, which suits him both as fisherman and in his professional character
of engineer. The third, being a tall man of rather military aspect, we knew as "the Colonel;"
and the fourth, who writes this narrative, shall be called "the Scribe."

Behold us, then, at Quebec in the last week of June, making our preparations--laying in stores
for camping out, and buying fishing-tackle, which for this kind of sport is best procured in
Canada. On the 25th of June our thirty-one packages were on board the steamer Miramichi, piled
on the upper deck, with many more of the same appearance--tents, buffalo robes, camp-chests,
salmon-rods and gaff-handles--belonging to other parties bound on the same errand as ourselves.
Three were British officers going to the Upsalquitch, men of the long-whiskered, Dundreary
type, who soon let us know with many haw-haws that they had fished in Norway, and had killed
salmon on the estate of my Lord Knowswho in Scotland, while guests of that nobleman. There
were two Londoners in full suits of tweed, with Glengarry bonnets, who were bound to the Cascapediac:
they tried to imitate the bearing of the military men; and why not? As Thackeray says, "Am
I not a snob and a brother?" There was a party of Americans on their way to a Gaspé river--veteran
anglers, who had frequented these rivers for some years. The rest of the company was made up
of Canadians from Montreal and Quebec, many of them pleasure-seekers--stout elderly men, with
equally full-fed, comfortable-looking wives, and rosy-faced daughters with straight, slender
figures, by and by to emulate the rounded proportions of their mammas. The young men were mostly
equipped with white canvas shoes and veils twisted round their hats--for what purpose I have
not been able to discover, but it seems to be the correct thing for the Canadian tourist.

Four hundred and fifty miles from Quebec we reach the entrance of Gaspé Bay, at the head of
which fine sheet of water, in a landlocked harbor, stands the town of Gaspé, distinguished
as the place where Jacques Cartier landed in 1534. It is now a great fishing-station, employing
thousands of men along the coast in the cod-fishery. Here are fine scenery, clear bracing air,
good sea-bathing, excellent salmon- and trout-fishing and a comfortable hotel. What more can
a well-regulated mind desire? Into Gaspé Bay flow the Dartmouth, the York and the St. John--good
salmon-rivers, while both they and the smaller streams abound with sea-trout and brook-trout.
Thirty miles south of Gaspé is the little town of Perce, also a fishing-station. Near this
stands a rock of red sandstone, five hundred feet long and three hundred high, with an open
arch leading through it, under which a boat can pass. It stands a mile from the shore in deep
water, and its top affords a secure breeding-place for hundreds of sea-fowl.

South of Gaspé Bay we pass the mouths of the Bonaventure and the Grand and Little Cascapediac--rivers
well stocked with salmon--and reach Dalhousie on the Bay of Chaleur about midnight on the 28th.
We land in a small boat in the darkness, and soon find ourselves at the comfortable tavern
of William Murphy, where we breakfast the next morning on salmon-trout and wild strawberries.
The town contains about six hundred inhabitants, and has a pleasant seat along the bay. Its
principal industry seems to be lumber, or deals, which mean three-inch plank, in which shape
most of the pine and spruce exported from the Dominion find their way to England. Here they
also put up salmon and lobsters for the American market--America meaning the United States.
Two steamers touch here weekly, and there is a daily mail and telegraphic communication with
the outside world. A few tourists, mostly from Montreal and Quebec, fill two or three small
boarding-houses.

The next morning we started in wagons for Matapedia, thirty miles up the river, where we expected
to secure canoes and Indians for our trip to the upper waters of the Restigouche. Our road
was good, following a terrace about fifty feet above the river, which here is about a mile
in width, and flows placidly through a wide valley, with high hills on both sides covered with
a growth of spruce and cedar. Fifteen miles above Dalhousie, at the head of navigation for
large vessels, lies the village of Campbellton. Here the character of the river changes: it
becomes more narrow and rapid, the hills come down closer to the shore, and it assumes the
features of a true salmon-river. It was formerly one of the most famous in the provinces, and
the late Robert Christie, for many years member for Gaspé, used to take two thousand tierces
of salmon annually from the Restigouche.

Here we fall in with the Intercolonial Railway, which has its western terminus at Rivière du
Loup, below Quebec, and its eastern at Halifax. The line is to cross the river at Matapedia
on an iron bridge, and follow down the valley. About 1 P. M. we crossed the ferry in a row-boat,
just below Fraser's hotel. The river is deep, swift and very clear, with a rocky bank, from
which they are getting out stone for the abutments of the bridge. This bridge, and another
similar one where the line crosses the Miramichi, are building at Phoenixville, Pennsylvania,
and we saw at Campbellton a large bark discharging her cargo, consisting of the bridge-work
ready to set up.

We arrived at Fraser's in time to partake of a fine boiled salmon, and we observe a constant
improvement in this fish. Those in Montreal were better than those in the States; those in
Quebec still better; those we ate on board the Gulf steamer a shade finer still. At Dalbousie
we thought that salmon had reached perfection, but were undeceived by those upon Fraser's table,
which far surpassed all that we had yet tasted in succulence and flavor.

We had hoped to go up the river on the morrow, Saturday, but found it was a great festival
of the Catholic Church, and the Indians would not start till Monday. Great was the indignation
of the British officers who were preparing to go up the other river. To be delayed by the religious
scruples of an Indian was too absurd. But even the "superior race" had to submit. So the next
day we all went down the river trout-fishing.

I went about two miles to the "flat lands," and fished some pretty pools and rapids: the day
was very bright and hot, so that I thought the trout would not rise to a fly, and I put on
a small spoon, which I dropped into the rapids at the end of a long rod. After catching three
or four they grew suspicious, and I changed my lure for an artificial minnow, and with it I
had better success, though I have often tried it in Western trout-streams ineffectually. I
got about a dozen, from four ounces to a pound weight: they were sea-trout, Salmo Canadensis,
and the first of that species that I ever saw. They are handsome and active fish, lighter in
color than the brook-trout, with silvery sides and belly. The flesh is red like a salmon, and
is of higher flavor, I think, than that of Salmo fontinalis. My companions, Rodman and Kingfisher,
both used the fly, and got, I think, more fish than I did.

The next day, June 30th, was Sunday, and the law of the Dominion prohibits fishing on that
day. The weather was intensely hot, and we stayed in the house and enjoyed the fine scenery
all about us. At night a heavy thunder-storm cooled the air for our next day's journey.

July 1. Our canoes and Indians arrived this morning about ten o'clock, and instead of being
shepherds of the forest, with their blankets tied with yellow strings, they had no blankets
at all, but wore coats and trowsers--yea, even boots, which I had always been told had no business
in a canoe. There were four bark canoes and eight Mic-macs--one boat for each of us--and as
we had a large amount of baggage and provisions, it was thought best to send off the canoes
with these, while we went in wagons across a great bend of the river to the house of Mr. John
Mowatt, the river overseer. We crossed the Matapediac in a dug-out: this is a tributary of
the Restigouche, which comes in at Fraser's. On the other side we found wagons which took us
to Mowatt's, seven miles over the hills, arriving at 4 P. M. The canoes arrived about sunset,
having come twelve miles since noon against a strong current.

July 2. Starting in the morning at sunrise, the canoes took us six miles by seven o'clock,
when we stopped in the woods for breakfast. The river has a very strong current, and from two
to three miles an hour is all that can be done against it with setting-poles when there is
a heavy load in the canoe. In places the water was too shallow even for a bark, and the men
stepped over-board and lifted her along. The Restigouche is a beautiful river, with few islands
or obstructions of any kind: the water is perfectly transparent, and very cold--the chosen
haunt of the salmon. We see few houses or farms: rounded hills, from three to nine hundred
feet high, border the stream, leaving only a narrow strip of beach, which is free from bushes
or fallen trees. These are probably all swept away by the ice in the spring freshets. The hills
somewhat resemble those on the Upper Mississippi, except that here there are none of those
cliffs of yellow limestone which are remarkable on the great river of the West. About eight
miles farther on we stopped for dinner near a cold brook, from which I took half a dozen trout.
In the afternoon we proceeded five or six miles, and then camped for the night upon a rocky
beach, and, though somewhat annoyed by the sand-flies, we slept well upon our beds of spruce
boughs.

July 3. Broke camp at 5 A. M., and went up six miles to a place called Tom's Brook, where we
breakfasted. Here I killed a dozen trout with the spoon. Six miles from Tom's Brook we came
to the first salmon-pool, of which there were six in the portion of the river assigned to us--viz.:
First, Big Cross Pool; second, Lower Indian-house Pool; third, Upper Indian-house Pool; fourth,
Patapediac Pool, called by the Indians Paddypajaw; fifth, Red Bank Pool; sixth, Little Cross
Pool. These pools are the places where the salmon rest in their journey from the sea to the
headwaters of the river. They are usually in spots where there is a strong but not violent
current, perhaps six or eight feet deep, running off to shoal water on one side of the river.
The pools have been found by the Indians, who search for them by night with torches, which
show the fish as they lie near the bottom, and they do not differ materially in appearance
from other parts of the river where no salmon are to be found.

The salmon is what is called anadromous--that is, though an inhabitant of the ocean for most
of the year, it ascends the fresh-water rivers in summer to spawn. In this function it is guided
by curious instincts. The female deposits her eggs in swift shallow water at the heads of streams,
in trenches dug by herself and the male fish in the gravelly bottom; but it must not be fresh
gravel: it must have been exposed to the action of water for at least two years, or they will
have none of it; and if a freshet should bring new gravel from the banks, they will abandon
the place and seek for new spawning-grounds. It is only when the salmon are resting in these
pools that they will take a fly.

The first pool was at a point where the river made a short turn around a large rock: the current
was swift, with a hole at the foot of the rapid perhaps twenty feet deep, with a rock bottom.
Here our leader, Kingfisher, rigged his salmon-rod, put on two flies and began to cast. I trolled
in the swift water as we proceeded, and with my spoon took a few small trout. A salmon rose
to the fly of Kingfisher, but was not hooked; this was the first fish that we saw. (The term
"fish" is always applied to the salmon by anglers: other inhabitants of the water are spoken
of as "trout" or "bass;" a salmon is a "fish.") Although we had seen none before, our keen-eyed
Indians had seen many as we came up the river.

We then went on to the Lower Indian-house Pool, two miles farther, and Kingfisher made a few
casts; but raising no fish, we went up a mile farther to our camping-ground, an island between
the two pools, having plenty of wood upon it, with a cold spring brook close by--an old and
famous camping-place for salmon-fishers--and here we intended to make our permanent quarters.
We had four tents--one to sleep in, fitted with mosquito-bars; one for an eating-tent, with
canvas top and sides of netting: in it was a rough table and two benches, hewed out with an
axe by one of our men. There was also a tent for storing provisions and for the cook, for we
had brought with us a man for this important office. A fourth tent for the Indians, and a cooking-stove
with camp-chests and equipage, completed our outfit, which all belonged to Kingfisher, and
represented the results of many years' experience in camping out. The cooking-stove is made
of sheet iron and packs in a box, and is one of the most valuable utensils in the woods.

It took the rest of the day to make the camp, and in the evening Kingfisher and the Colonel
went in their canoe to the lower pool, and the former killed two salmon, weighing eighteen
and twenty-two pounds. These, our first fish, were objects of much interest to us new hands.
The Colonel took his first lesson in salmon-fishing, and thought he could do it himself.

July 4. We proposed to celebrate this day by each of us killing a salmon, but I thought it
would be prudent first to go out with Kingfisher and see how he did it, before attempting it
myself. So I got into his canoe, and the Indians paddled us to Upper Pool, within sight of
our camp but for a bend in the river. Kingfisher had the canoe anchored within casting distance
of the channel, and there, as he sat in the bottom of the boat, he made his casts with a nineteen-foot
rod, first about twenty-five feet, and rapidly letting out more line he increased the length
of his casts to sixty feet perhaps, the big salmon-flies falling lightly on the water, first
across the channel to the right; then letting the current take the flies down to the end of
the line, he drew them round to the left in a circle; then raising them slowly from the water,
he repeated the process, thus fishing over all the water within his reach. Now the Indians
raise the anchor and let the canoe drop down a few feet. At the first cast after this change
of ground a bulge in the water showed where a salmon had risen at the fly and missed it. "We
will rest him for five minutes," said Kingfisher, and lighted his pipe for a smoke. Then he
changed his fly for a larger and more brilliant one, and at the first cast a big fish rolled
over at the fly and went off with a rush, making the reel whiz.

"I've got him," said Kingfisher, calmly putting up his pipe and bringing his rod to a nearly
perpendicular position, which threw a great strain on the mouth of the salmon from the spring
of the rod. He ran about twenty-five yards, and then leaped six feet into the air. Kingfisher
dropped the point of his rod as the fish leaped, and then raised it as the salmon went away
with twenty yards more of line.

"Up anchor, Hughey: we must follow him." So they plied their paddles after the salmon, who
was making down stream, Kingfisher reeling up his line as fast as possible. Up went the salmon
again, striking at the line with his tail as he came down; but this trick failed, and he then
sulked, by diving into the depths of the river and remaining there motionless for half an hour.
Suddenly he rose and made for the heavy current, from which Kingfisher tried to steer him into
the still water near the shore, where it was about three feet deep, and where he could be played
with more safety. After about forty minutes' play the fish was coaxed alongside the canoe,
evidently tired out and having lost his force and fury, when Hughey struck the gaff into him
near the tail, and lifted him into the canoe, where he struggled very little, so nearly beaten
was he.

"About nineteen pounds, I think," said Kingfisher, who from long experience could name the
weight of a fish very correctly.

Returning to the spot where he had hooked the fish, Kingfisher after a few casts rose and hooked
another, which he killed in twenty-five minutes--a fish of twelve pounds. After seeing the
method of this artist I was presumptuous enough to suppose that I could do it also, and I determined
to open the campaign the next day.

July 5. Bent on salmon-killing, I was off this morning at five, hoping to bring home a fish
for breakfast. The Upper Indian-house Pool is for Rodman and me to-day, the others going to
Patapedia, three miles above. Kingfisher fitted me out with a Castle Connell rod, quite light
and pliable, with which he has killed many a fish; a click reel, which obliges the fish to
use some force in getting out the line: of this I have one hundred yards of oiled silk, with
a twelve-feet gut casting-line, to the end of which is looped a brilliant creature almost as
large as a humming-bird--certainly the likeness of nothing inhabiting earth, air or water.
Mike and Peter, my Indians, took me to the pool, and I began casting at the place where Kingfisher
got his salmon yesterday, while Rodman took the upper end of the pool, which was three or four
hundred yards in length. I had fished for trout in a bark canoe, and knew how crank a vessel
it is; so I did not attempt to stand up and cast, but seated myself upon the middle cross-bar
with my face turned down stream, and began to imitate the casting of Kingfisher as well as
I could. I had fished but a few yards of water when the quick-eyed Peter cried, "Lameau!" which
is Mic-mac for salmon. He had seen the rise of the fish, which I had not. And here I may observe
that good eyes are necessary to make a salmon-fisher, and a near-sighted person like the Scribe
can never greatly excel in this pursuit. All the salmon which I hooked fastened themselves:
I had only this part in it, that I was the fool at one end of the rod. I waited five minutes,
according to rule, and cast again. "Habet!" There can be no mistake this time: my eyes were
good enough to see the savage rush with which he seized my fly and plunged with it down to
the depths.

"Hold up your rod!" cries Peter, who saw that, taken by surprise, I was dropping the point
of it. I raised it nearly upright, and this, with the friction of the reel, caused the fish,
which had started to run after he felt the prick of the hook, to stop when he had gone half
across the river, and make his leap or somersault.

"A twenty-pounder," said Mike.

When he leaped I ought to have dropped my point, so that he should not fall on the line, but
I did nothing of the sort. I felt much as I once did in the woods of Wisconsin when a dozen
deer suddenly jumped up from the long grass all about me, and I forgot that I had a gun in
my hands. I had so much line out that, as it happened, no bad consequences followed, and the
fish started for another run, at the end of which he made his leap, and coming down he struck
my line with his tail, and was gone! Slowly and sadly I wound up my line, and found the gut
broken close to the hook, and my beautiful "Fairy" vanished.

Then I looped on another insect phenomenon, and went on casting. Rodman, I perceived, was engaged
with a salmon on the other bank. Presently I raise and hook another, but he directly shakes
out the hook.

I move slowly down the pool, casting on each side--which I find is hard work for the back and
shoulders--when, just opposite the big rock where Kingfisher raised his second fish yesterday,
I feel a pluck at my fly and see a boil in the water. The robber runs away twenty yards and
leaps, then turns short round and comes at me, as if to run down the canoe and drown us all.
I wind up my line as fast as possible, but, alas! it comes in, yard after yard, so easily that
I perceive all connection between the fish and me is at an end.

"He got slack line on you," said Peter.

By this time it was seven o'clock, and I returned home to breakfast with what appetite I had,
a sadder if not a wiser man. Rodman brought in a nine-pound fish, and Kingfisher had three--thirteen,
ten and twenty-one pounds. The Colonel had made a successful début with a fifteen-pound fish.

As we sat at breakfast Rodman asked, "How many salmon did you ever kill in a day, Kingfisher?"

Kingfisher. "I once killed thirty-three in one day: that was in the Mingan, a North Shore river,
where the fish are very numerous, but small--not over ten pounds on an average. I knew a man
once to kill forty-two in a day there, but he had extra strong tackle, with double and treble
gut, and being a big strong fellow he used to drag them out by main force."

The Colonel. "If he had played his fish as you do here, there would not have been time in the
longest day to kill forty-two. You average half an hour to a salmon, which would have taken
twenty-one hours for his day's work."

Kingfisher. "True enough, but those little fellows in the Mingan can be killed in ten or fifteen
minutes."

Rodman. "And what was the longest time you ever spent in killing a salmon?"

Kingfisher. "Once fishing in the Moisie, where the fish are very large, I hooked a salmon at
five in the morning and lost him at six in the evening: he was on for thirteen hours, but he
sulked at the bottom most of the time, and I never saw him at all."

Scribe. "Perhaps it was no fish at all."

Kingfisher. "It might have been a seal, but Sir Edmund Head, who was with me, and I myself,
thought it was a very large salmon and hooked foul, so that I could not drown him. I think
from his play that it was a salmon: he ran many times round the pool, but swam deep, as heavy
fish are apt to do. How do you like the cooking of this salmon?"

Scribe. "I think it is perfect. The salmon have been growing better ever since we entered the
Dominion, but we have reached perfection now. Is this the Tweedside method?"

Kingfisher. "It is. Put your fish in boiling water, well salted, boil a minute to a pound,
and when done serve it with some of the water it was boiled in for sauce. You can't improve
a fresh-caught salmon with Worcestershire or Harvey."

The day proving very hot, we stayed in camp till evening, when Kingfisher and the others went
to the nearest pool for salmon, and I went trout-fishing to the little rapids and took a dozen
of moderate size. Kingfisher brought in four fish--seven, ten, seventeen and eighteen pounds;
Rodman got two--twelve and sixteen pounds; the Colonel failed to secure one which he had hooked.

July 6. To-day Kingfisher and the Colonel take the Upper Indian-house Pool, and Rodman and
I go to the Patapedia. We start at 4 A. M., so as to get the early fishing, always the best.
It takes an hour to pole up the three miles, the current being very strong, and when we arrive
the pool is yet white with the morning mist. It is a long smooth rapid, with a channel on one
side running close to the high gravelly bank, evidently cut away by spring freshets. On the
other side comes in a rushing brook or small river called the Patapedia. Rodman took the head
of the pool, and I the middle ground. I fished down some fifty yards without moving anything,
when, as I was bringing home my fly after a cast, it was taken by a good fish. Away he went
with a wicked rush full forty yards, in spite of all I could do, then made a somersault, showing
us his huge proportions. A second and a third time he leaped, and then darted away, I urging
my men to follow with the canoe, which they did, but not quickly enough. This was a terribly
strong fish: though I was giving him all the spring of the rod, I could not check him. When
he stopped running he began to shake his head, or, as the English fishing-books say, "to jigger."
In two minutes he jiggered out the hook and departed.

I had changed rods and lines to-day, having borrowed one from Rodman--a Montreal rod, larger
and stiffer than the other: although heavier, I could cast better with it than with the Irish
rod. Unluckily, there were only about seventy yards of line on the reel, and the next fish
I hooked proved to be the most furious of all, for he first ran out forty yards of line, and
before I could get much of it wound up again, he made another and a longer run, taking out
all my line to the end, where it was tied to the reel: of course he broke loose, taking away
my fly and two feet of casting-line. By this time the sun was high in the heavens, and we returned
to camp--Rodman with a salmon of seventeen pounds and a grilse of five pounds.

A salmon has properly four stages of existence. The first is as a "parr," a small bright-looking
fish, four or five inches long, with dark-colored bars across the sides and a row of red spots.
It is always found in the fresh water, looks something like a trout, and will take a fly or
bait eagerly. The second stage is when it puts on the silvery coat previous to going to sea
for the first time: it is then called a "smolt," and is from six to eight inches long, still
living in the river where it was hatched. In the third stage, after its return from the sea
to its native river, it is called a "grilse," and weighs from three to six pounds. It can be
distinguished from a salmon, even of the same size, by its forked tail (that of the salmon
being square) and the slight adhesion of the scales. The grilse is wonderfully active and spirited,
and will often give as much play as a salmon of three times his size. After the second visit
of the fish to the sea he returns a salmon, mature, brilliant and vigorous, and increases in
weight every time he revisits the ocean, where most of his food is found, consisting of small
fish and crustacea.

As we dropped down the stream toward the camp we saw a squirrel swimming across the river.
Paddling toward him, Peter reached out his pole, and the squirrel took refuge upon it and was
lifted on board--a pretty little creature, gray and red, about half the size of the common
gray squirrel of the States. He ran about the canoe so fearlessly that I think he must have
been unacquainted with mankind. He skipped over us as if we had been logs, with his bead-like
eyes almost starting from his head with astonishment, and then mounting the prow of the canoe,

    On the bows, with tail erected,
    Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo.

Presently we paddled toward the shore, and he jumped off and disappeared in the bushes, with
a fine story to tell to his friends of having been ferried across by strange and friendly monsters.
Kingfisher got eleven salmon to-day, and the Colonel one.

July 7 was Sunday, and the pools were rested, as well as ourselves, from the fatigues of the
week. Kingfisher brought out his materials and tied a few flies, such as he thought would suit
the river. This he does very neatly, and I think he belongs to the old school of anglers, who
believe in a great variety of flies.

It may not perhaps be generally known that there are two schools among fly-fishers. The "formalists"
or entomologists hold that the natural flies actually on the water should be studied and imitated
by the fly-maker, down to the most minute particulars. This is the old theory, and whole libraries
have been written to prove and illustrate it, from the Boke of St. Albans, written by the Dame
Juliana Berners in 1486, down to the present day. The number of insects which we are directed
to imitate is legion, and the materials necessary for their manufacture are of immense variety
and difficult to procure. These teachers are the conservatives, who adhere to old tradition.
On the other side are the "colorists," who think color everything, and form nothing: they are
but a section, though an increasing one, of the fly-fishing community. Their theory is, that
all that a fish can distinguish through the watery medium is the size and color of the fly.
These are the radicals, and they go so far as to discard the thousand different flies described
in the books, and confine themselves to half a dozen typical varieties, both in salmon- and
trout-fishing. Where learned doctors disagree, I, for one, do not venture to decide; but when
I remember that on some days no fly in my book would tempt the trout, and that at other times
they would rise at any or all flies, it seems to me that the principal question is, Are the
trout feeding or not? If they are, they will take almost anything; if not, the most skillful
hand may fail of tempting them to rise. As to salmon, I think no one will pretend that the
salmon-flies commonly used are like anything in Nature, and it is difficult to understand what
the keen-eyed salmon takes them for. Until, then, we can put ourselves in the place of the
salmon and see with his eyes, we must continue to evolve our flies from our own consciousness.
My small experience seems to show me that in a salmon-fly color is the main thing to be studied.

But to return to Kingfisher, who has been all this time softening some silk-worm gut in his
mouth, and now says in a thick voice, "Do you know, colonel, I lost my chance of a wife once
in this way?"

Colonel. "How was that? Did you steal some of the lady's feathers?"

Kingfisher. "No, it was in this way: I was a lad of about seventeen, but I had a sweetheart.
I was at college, and had but little time for fishing, of which I was as fond as I am now.
One evening I was hastening toward the river with my rod, with my mouth full of flies and gut,
which I was softening as I am now. Turning the corner of a narrow lane, I met my beloved and
her mother, both of whom were precise persons who could not take a joke. Of course I had to
stop and speak to them, but my mouth was full of hooks and gut, and the hooks stuck in my tongue,
and I only mumbled. They looked astonished. Perhaps they thought I was drunk: anyway, the young
lady asked what was the matter. 'My m--m--mouth is full of guts,' was all that I could say;
and the girl would never speak to me afterward."

Rodman. "That was lucky, for you got a wife better able to bear with your little foibles."

Kingfisher. "I did, sir."

July 8. Rodman and I were to take the Upper Indian-house Pool to-day, the others going to the
Patapedia. Kingfisher and I exchanged Indians: he, having a man who was a better fisherman
than either of mine, kindly lent him to me, that I might have a better chance of killing a
salmon, I being the only one of the party who had not succeeded in doing so. I found in my
book a casting-line of double gut: it was only two yards long, but I thought I had better trust
to it than the single gut which the fish had been breaking for me the last two days. I also
found in my book a few large showy salmon-flies tied on double gut: with these I started, determined
to do or die. I was on the pool at 5 A. M., and had raised two salmon, and caught two large
trout, which often took our flies when we were casting for bigger fish. At 6.30 I raised and
hooked a big fish, which ran out twenty yards of line, and then stopped. I determined to try
the waiting method this time, and not to lose my fish by too much haste; so I let him have
his own way, only holding him with a tight hand. Joe, I soon saw, understood his part of the
business: he kept the canoe close behind the fish, so that I should always have a reserve of
line upon my reel. My salmon made two runs without showing himself: he pulled hard, and was
evidently a strong fish. He now tried to work himself across the river into the heavy current.
I resisted this, but to no purpose: I could not hold him, and I thought he was going down the
little rapid, where I could not have followed, when he steered down through the still and deep
water, and went to the bottom near the camp. There he stayed, sulking, for more than an hour,
and I could not start him. The cook came down from his fire to see the conflict; Joe lighted
his pipe and smoked it out; old Captain Merrill, who lived on the opposite bank, came out and
hailed me, "Reckon you've got a big one this time, judge;" and still my line pointed to the
bottom of the river, and my hands grew numb with holding the rod.

    They have tied me to the stake: I cannot fly,
    But, bear-like, I must fight the course.

Suddenly, up from the depths came the salmon, and made off at full speed down the river, making
his first leap as he went, which showed him to be a twenty-pounder at least. We followed with
the canoe. On the west side of the island ran the main channel, wide and deep, gradually increasing
in swiftness till it became a boiling torrent. Into this my fish plunged, in spite of all my
resistance, and all we could do was to follow. But I soon lost track of him and control of
him: sometimes he was ahead, and I could feel him; sometimes he was alongside, and the line
was slack and dragging on the water, most dangerous of positions; sometimes the canoe went
fastest, and the salmon was behind me. My men handled the canoe admirably, and brought me through
safe, fish and all; for when we emerged into the still pool below, and I was able to reel up,
I felt him still on the hook, but unsubdued, for he made another run of thirty yards, and leaped
twice.

"That's good," said Joe: "that will tire him."

For the first two hours of the struggle the fish had been quiet, and so had saved his strength,
but now he began to race up and down the pool, trying for slack line. But Joe followed him
up sharply and kept him well in hand. Now the fish began to jigger, and shook his head so hard
and so long that I thought something must give way--either my line or his spinal column. After
about an hour of this kind of work I called to Rodman, who was fishing not far off, and asked
him to come alongside and play my fish for a few minutes, so that I might rest my hands, which
were cramped with holding the rod so long; which he did, and gave me fifteen minutes' rest,
when I resumed the rod. The fish now seemed somewhat spent, for he came to the surface and
flounced about, so that we could see his large proportions. Still, I could not get him alongside,
and I told Joe to try to paddle up to him, but he immediately darted away from us and headed
up stream, keeping a parallel course about fifty feet off, so that we could see him perfectly
through the clear water. After many efforts, however, he grew more tame, and Louis paddled
the canoe very carefully up to him, while Joe stood watching his chance with the gaff, which
he put deep in the water. At last I got the fish over it, when with a sudden pull the gaff
was driven into him just behind the dorsal fin; but he was so strong that I thought he would
have taken the man out of the canoe. The water flew in showers, and the big salmon lay in the
bottom of the boat!

I could hardly believe my eyes. That tremendous creature caught with a line no thicker than
a lady's hair-pin! I looked at my watch: it was eleven o'clock, just four hours and a half.
"Well, I have done enough for to-day, Joe: let us go home to breakfast." Arrived at the camp,
we weighed the salmon and measured him--twenty-four pounds, and forty inches long--a male fish,
fresh run from the sea, the strongest and most active of his kind. It had been my luck to hook
these big ones: I wished that my first encounters should be with fish of ten or twelve pounds.
Rodman came in with two--fourteen and sixteen pounds.

That evening I went again to the same pool, and soon hooked another good fish with the same
fly; but though he was nearly as large as the first, weighing twenty-two pounds, I killed him
in thirty minutes. He fought hard from the very first, running and vaulting by turns without
any stop, so that he soon tired himself out. Rodman got another this evening, and Kingfisher
brought seven from the Patapedia, and the Colonel one. Thirteen is our score to-day.

July 9. Rodman and I went this morning to the Patapedia, but raised no salmon. Either some
one had been netting the pool that night, or Kingfisher had killed all the fish yesterday.
I got a grilse of four pounds, which made a smart fight for fifteen minutes, and Rodman hooked
another, but lost him. That evening we went again to the pool, and I killed a small but very
active salmon of nine pounds, which fought me nearly an hour: Rodman got a grilse of five pounds.
Strange to say, neither Kingfisher nor the Colonel killed a fish to-day, so that I was for
once "high line."

Having killed four salmon, I concluded to retire. I found the work too hard, and determined
to go to Dalhousie and try the sea-trout fishing in that vicinity. So, after an hour's fly-fishing
at the mouth of the brook opposite our camp, in which I got a couple of dozen, hooking two
at a cast twice, and twice three at a cast, I started at seven o'clock on the 10th, and ran
down with the current and paddles forty miles to Fraser's in seven hours--the same distance
which it took us two days and a half to make going up stream.

Of all modes of traveling, to float down a swift river in a bark canoe is the most agreeable;
and when paddled by Indians the canoe is the perfection of a vessel for smooth-water navigation.
Where there are three inches of water she can go--where there is none, a man can carry her
round the portage on his back. Her buoyancy enables her to carry a heavy load, and, though
frail, the elasticity of her material admits of many a blow and pinch which would seriously
damage a heavier vessel. The rifle and axe of the backwoodsman, the canoe and the weapons of
the Indian, are the result of long years of experiment, and perfectly meet their necessities.

The rest of the party remained and fished five days more, making ten days in all, and the score
was eighty-five salmon and five grilse, the united weight of which was fourteen hundred and
twenty-three pounds. The salmon averaged sixteen and a half pounds each: the three largest
weighed thirty, thirty, and thirty-three pounds. Nearly two-thirds of the whole were taken
by Kingfisher, and our average for three rods was three fish per day each.

It is asserted by Norris in the American Angler's Book that the salmon of the American rivers
are smaller than those of Europe, that in the Scottish rivers many are still taken of twenty
and twenty-five pounds weight, and that on this side of the Atlantic it is as rare to take
them with the rod over fifteen pounds. If this statement was correct when Norris wrote, ten
years ago, then the Canadian rivers have improved under the system of protection, for, as above
stated, our catch in the Restigouche averaged over sixteen pounds, and nearly one-third of
our fish were of twenty pounds or over.

Yarrel, in his work on British fishes, says that in 1835 he saw 10 salmon in the London market
weighing from 38 to 40 pounds each. Sir Humphry Davy is said to have killed a salmon in the
Tweed that weighed 42 pounds: this was about 1825. The largest salmon ever seen in London was
sold there in 1821: it weighed 83 pounds. But with diminished numbers the size of the salmon
in Scottish waters has also diminished. In the Field newspaper for August and September, 1872,
I find the following report of the fishing in some of those rivers: The Severn--average size
of catch (considered very large) is 16 pounds; fish of 30, 40 and 50 pounds have been taken.
The Tay--one rod, one day in August, 7 fish; average weight, 18 pounds. The Tweed--two rods,
one day's fishing, 12 fish; average, 20 pounds. The Eaine--fish run from 12 to 20 pounds.

In Lloyd's book on the Sports of Norway we find the following reports of the salmon-fishing
in that country, where the fish are supposed to be very large: In the river Namsen, Sir Hyde
Parker in 1836 killed in one day 10 salmon weighing from 30 to 60 pounds. This is considered
the best of the Norwegian rivers, both for number and size of fish. The Alten--Mr. Brettle
in 1838 killed in fifteen days 194 fish; average, 15 pounds; largest fish, 40 pounds. Sir Charles
Blois, the most successful angler, in the season of 1843 killed in the Alten 368 fish; average,
15 pounds: largest fish, 50 pounds. The Steenkjaw--one rod killed in twenty days 80 salmon;
average, 14 pounds. The Mandall--one rod killed 35 fish in one day. The Nid--two rods killed
in one day 19 fish; largest fish, 38 pounds.

The following records are from Canadian rivers prior to 1871: Moisie--two rods in twenty-five
days, 318 fish; average 15-1/7 pounds; three largest, 29, 29 and 32 pounds. Godbout--three
rods in forty days, 194 fish; average, 11-1/8 pounds; three largest, 18, 19 and 20 pounds.
St. John--two rods in twenty-two days, 199 fish; average, 10 pounds. Nipisiquit--two rods,
76 fish; average, 9-1/2 pounds. Mingan--three rods in thirty-two days, 218 fish; average, 10-1/5
pounds. Restigouche, 1872--three rods in ten days, 85 fish; average, 16-1/2 pounds; three largest,
30, 30 and 33 pounds.

The greatest kill of salmon ever recorded was that of Allan Gilmour, Esq., of Ottawa, who killed
in the Godbout in 1867, in one day, 46 salmon, averaging 11-1/2 pounds, or one fish about every
fifteen minutes.

The largest salmon taken with the fly in an American river have been out of the Grand Cascapediac,
on the north shore of the Bay of Chaleur. In 1871, by the government report, there were 44
salmon killed with the fly--two of 40 pounds, one of 38, and four others of over 30 pounds;
average weight, 23 pounds. In the same river in 1872, Mr. John Medden of Toronto, with three
other rods, killed 2 fish of 45 pounds, 4 of between 40 and 45, 5 of between 35 and 40 pounds,
7 of between 30 and 35 pounds, 15 of between 25 and 30 pounds, 16 of between 20 and 25, besides
smaller ones not enumerated.

From these data it would seem that the average size of the Canadian salmon is as great as those
of Norway, and very nearly equal to those of the Scottish rivers; while the number of fish
taken in a day in the Canadian rivers, particularly in those on the north shore of the St.
Lawrence, surpasses the best catch of either the Scottish or Norwegian rivers.

CHAPTER VI.

AT BARVAS BRIDGE.

Very soon, indeed, Ingram began to see that his friend had spoken to him quite frankly, and
that he was really bent on asking Sheila to become his wife. Ingram contemplated this prospect
with some dismay, and with some vague consciousness that he was himself responsible for what
he could not help regarding as a disaster. He had half expected that Frank Lavender would,
in his ordinary fashion, fall in love with Sheila--for about a fortnight. He had joked him
about it even before they came within sight of Sheila's home. He had listened with a grim humor
to Lavender's outbursts of admiration, and only asked himself how many times he had heard the
same phrases before. But now things were looking more serious, for the young man had thrown
himself into the prosecution of his new project with all the generous poetic enthusiasm of
a highly impulsive nature. Ingram saw that everything a young man could do to win the heart
of a young girl Lavender would do; and Nature had dowered him richly with various means of
fascination. Most dangerous of all of these was a gift of sincerity that deceived himself.
He could assume an opinion or express an emotion at will, with such a genuine fervor that he
himself forgot how recently he had acquired it, and was able to convince his companion for
the moment that it was a revelation of his inmost soul. It was this charm of impetuous sincerity
which had fascinated Ingram himself years before, and made him cultivate the acquaintance of
a young man whom he at first regarded as a somewhat facile, talkative and histrionic person.
Ingram perceived, for example, that young Lavender had so little regard for public affairs
that he would have been quite content to see our Indian empire go for the sake of eliciting
a sarcasm from Lord Westbury; but at the same time, if you had appealed to his nobler instincts,
and placed before him the condition of a certain populace suffering from starvation, he would
have done all in his power to aid them: he would have written letters to the newspapers, would
have headed subscriptions, and would have ended by believing that he had been the constant
friend of the people of India throughout his life, and was bound to stick to them to the end of it.

As often as not he borrowed his fancies and opinions from Edward Ingram himself, who was amused
and gratified at the same time to find his humdrum notions receive a dozen new lights and colors
when transferred to the warmer atmosphere of his friend's imagination. Ingram would even consent
to receive from his younger companion advice, impetuously urged and richly illustrated, which
he had himself offered in simpler terms months before. At this very moment he could see that
much of Lavender's romantic conceptions of Sheila's character was only an exaggeration of some
passing hints he, Ingram, had dropped as the Clansman was steaming into Stornoway. But then
they were ever so much more beautiful. Ingram held to his conviction that he himself was a
distinctly commonplace person. He had grown reconciled to the ordinary grooves of life. But
young Lavender was not commonplace: he fancied he could see in him an occasional flash of something
that looked like genius; and many and many a time, in regarding the brilliant and facile powers,
the generous impulses and the occasional ambitions of his companion, he wondered whether these
would ever lead to anything in the way of production, or even of consolidation of character,
or whether would merely remain the passing sensations of an indifferent idler. Sometimes, indeed,
he devoutly wished that Lavender had been born a stonemason.

But all these pleasant and graceful qualities, which had made the young man an agreeable companion,
were a serious danger now; for was it not but too probable that Sheila, accustomed to the rude
and homely ways of the islanders, would be attracted and pleased and fascinated by one who
had about him so much of a soft and southern brightness with which she was wholly unfamiliar?
This open-hearted frankness of his placed all his best qualities in the sunshine, as it were:
she could not fail to see the singular modesty and courtesy of his bearing toward women, his
gentle manners, his light-heartedness, his passionate admiration of the self-sacrifice of others,
and his sympathy with their sufferings. Ingram would not have minded much if Lavender alone
had been concerned in the dilemma now growing imminent: he would have left him to flounder
out of it as he had got out of previous ones. But he had been surprised and pained, and even
frightened, to detect in Sheila's manner some faint indications--so faint that he was doubtful
what construction to put on them--of a special interest in the young stranger whom he had brought
with him to Borva.

What could he do in the matter, supposing his suspicions were correct? Caution Sheila?--it
would be an insult. Warn Mackenzie?--the King of Borva would fly into a passion with everybody
concerned, and bring endless humiliation on his daughter, who had probably never dreamed of
regarding Lavender except as a chance acquaintance. Insist upon Lavender going south at once?--that
would merely goad the young man into obstinacy. Ingram found himself in a grievous difficulty,
afraid to say how much of it was of his own creation. He had no selfish sentiments of his own
to consult: if it were to become evident that the happiness of Sheila and of his friend depended
on their marrying each other, he was ready to forward such a project with all the influence
at his command. But there were a hundred reasons why he should dread such a marriage. He had
already mentioned several of them to Lavender in trying to dissuade the young man from his
purpose. A few days had passed since then, and it was clear that Lavender had abandoned all
notion of fulfilling those resolutions he had vaguely formed. But the more Ingram thought over
the matter, and the further he recalled all the ancient proverbs and stories about the fate
of intermeddlers, the more evident it became to him that he could take no immediate action
in the affair. He would trust to the chapter of accidents to save Sheila from what he considered
a disastrous fate. Perhaps Lavender would repent. Perhaps Mackenzie, continually on the watch
for small secrets, would discover something, and bid his daughter stay in Borva while his guests
proceeded on their tour through Lewis. In any case, it was not at all certain that Lavender
would be successful in his suit. Was the heart of a proud-spirited, intelligent and busily-occupied
girl to be won in a matter of three weeks or a month? Lavender would go south, and no more
would be heard of it.

This tour round the island of Lewis, however, was not likely to favor much any such easy escape
from the difficulty. On a certain morning the larger of Mr. Mackenzie's boats carried the holiday
party away from Borva; and even at this early stage, as they sat at the stern of the heavy
craft, Lavender had arrogated to himself the exclusive right of waiting upon Sheila. He had
constituted himself her companion in all their excursions about Borva which they had undertaken,
and now, on this longer journey, they were to be once more thrown together. It did seem a little
hard that Ingram should be relegated to Mackenzie and his theories of government; but did he
not profess to prefer that? Like most men who have got beyond five-and-thirty, he was rather
proud of considering himself an observer of life. He stood aside as a spectator, and let other
people, engaged in all manner of eager pursuits, pass before him for review. Toward young folks,
indeed, he assumed a good-naturedly paternal air, as if they were but as shy-faced children
to be humored. Were not their love-affairs a pretty spectacle? As for himself, he was far beyond
all that. The illusions of love-making, the devotion and ambition and dreams of courtship,
were no longer possible to him, but did they not constitute on the whole a beautiful and charming
study, that had about it at times some little touches of pathos? At odd moments, when he saw
Sheila and Lavender walking together in the evening, he was himself half inclined to wish that
something might come of the young man's determination. It would be so pleasant to play the
part of a friendly counselor, to humor the follies of the young folks, to make jokes at their
expense, and then, in the midst of their embarrassment and resentment, to go forward and pet
them a little, and assure them of a real and earnest sympathy.

"Your time is to come," Lavender said to him suddenly after he had been exhibiting some of
his paternal forbearance and consideration: "you will get a dreadful twist some day, my boy.
You have been doing nothing but dreaming about women, but some day or other you will wake up
to find yourself captured and fascinated beyond anything you have ever seen in other people,
and then you will discover what a desperately real thing it is."

Ingram had a misty impression that he had heard something like this before. Had he not given
Lavender some warning of the same kind? But he was so much accustomed to hear those vague repetitions
of his own remarks, and was, on the whole, so well pleased to think that his commonplace notions
should take root and flourish in this goodly soil, that he never thought of asking Lavender
to quote his authority for those profound observations on men and things.

"Now, Miss Mackenzie," said the young man as the big boat was drawing near to Callernish, "what
is to be our first sketch in Lewis?"

"The Callernish Stones, of course," said Mackenzie himself: "it iss more than one hass come
to the Lewis to see the Callernish Stones."

Lavender had promised to the King of Borva a series of water-color drawings of Lewis, and Sheila
was to choose the subjects from day to day. Mackenzie was gratified by this proposal, and accepted
it with much magnanimity; but Sheila knew that before the offer was made Lavender had come
to her and asked her if she cared about sketches, and whether he might be allowed to take a
few on this journey and present them to her. She was very grateful, but suggested that it might
please her papa if they were given to him. Would she superintend them, then, and choose the
topics for illustration? Yes, she would do that; and so the young man was furnished with a
roving commission.

He brought her a little sepia sketch of Borvabost, its huts, its bay, and its upturned boats
on the beach. Sheila's expressions of praise, the admiration and pleasure that shone in her
eyes, would have turned any young man's head. But her papa looked at the picture with a critical
eye, and remarked, "Oh yes, it is ferry good, but it is not the color of Loch Roag at all.
It is the color of a river when there is a flood of rain. I have neffer at all seen Loch Roag
a brown color--neffer at all."

It was clear, then, that the subsequent sketches could not be taken in sepia, and so Lavender
proposed to make a series of pencil-drawings, which could be washed in with color afterward.
There was one subject, indeed, which since his arrival in Lewis he had tried to fix on paper
by every conceivable means in his power, and that was Sheila herself. He had spoiled innumerable
sheets of paper in trying to get some likeness of her which would satisfy himself, but all
his usual skill seemed somehow to have gone from him. He could not understand it. In ordinary
circumstances he could have traced in a dozen lines a portrait that would at least have shown
a superficial likeness: he could have multiplied portraits by the dozen of old Mackenzie or
Ingram or Duncan, but here he seemed to fail utterly. He invited no criticism, certainly. These
efforts were made in his own room, and he asked no one's opinion as to the likeness. He could,
indeed, certify to himself that the drawing of the features was correct enough. There was the
sweet and placid forehead with its low masses of dark hair; there the short upper lip, the
finely-carved mouth, the beautifully-rounded chin and throat; and there the frank, clear, proud
eyes, with their long lashes and highly-curved eyebrows. Sometimes, too, a touch of color added
warmth to the complexion, put a glimmer of the blue sea beneath the long black eyelashes, and
drew a thread of scarlet round the white neck. But was this Sheila? Could he take this sheet
of paper to his friends in London and say, Here is the magical princess whom I hope to bring
to you from the North, with all the glamour of the sea around her? He felt instinctively that
there would be an awkward pause. The people would praise the handsome, frank, courageous head,
and look upon the bit of red ribbon round the neck as an effective artistic touch. They would
hand him back the paper with a compliment, and he would find himself in an agony of unrest
because they had misunderstood the portrait, and seen nothing of the wonder that encompassed
this Highland girl as if with a garment of mystery and dreams.

So he tore up portrait after portrait--more than one of which would have startled Ingram by
its truth--and then, to prove to himself that he was not growing mad, he resolved to try a
portrait of some other person. He drew a head of old Mackenzie in chalk, and was amazed at
the rapidity and facility with which he executed the task. Then there could be no doubt as
to the success of the likeness nor as to the effect of the picture. The King of Borva, with
his heavy eyebrows, his aquiline nose, his keen gray eyes and flowing beard, offered a fine
subject; and there was something really royal and massive and noble in the head that Lavender,
well satisfied with his work, took down stairs one evening. Sheila was alone in the drawing-room,
turning over some music.

"Miss Mackenzie," he said rather kindly, "would you look at this?"

Sheila turned round, and the sudden light of pleasure that leapt to her face was all the praise
and all the assurance he wanted. But he had more than that. The girl was grateful to him beyond
all the words she could utter; and when he asked her if she would accept the picture, she thanked
him by taking his hand for a moment, and then she left the room to call in Ingram and her father.
All the evening there was a singular look of happiness on her face. When she met Lavender's
eyes with hers there was a frank and friendly look of gratitude ready to reward him. When had
he earned so much before by a simple sketch? Many and many a portrait, carefully executed and
elaborately framed, had he presented to his lady friends in London, to receive from them a
pretty note and a few words of thanks when next he called. Here with a rough chalk sketch he
had awakened an amount of gratitude that almost surprised him in the most beautiful and tender
soul in the world; and had not this princess among women taken his hand for a moment as a childlike
way of expressing her thanks, while her eyes spoke more than her lips? And the more he looked
at those eyes, the more he grew to despair of ever being able to put down the magic of them
in lines and colors.

At length Duncan got the boat into the small creek at Callernish, and the party got out on
the shore. As they were going up the steep path leading to the plain above a young girl met
them, who looked at them in rather a strange way. She had a fair, pretty, wondering face, with
singularly high eyebrows and clear, light-blue eyes.

"How are you, Eily?" said Mackenzie as he passed on with Ingram.

But Sheila, on making the same inquiry, shook hands with the girl, who smiled in a confidential
way, and, coming quite close, nodded and pointed down to the water's edge.

"Have you seen them to-day, Eily?" said Sheila, still holding the girl by the hands, and looking
at the fair, pretty, strange face.

"It wass sa day before yesterday," she answered in a whisper, while a pleased smile appeared
on her face, "and sey will be here sa night."

"Good-bye, Eily: take care you don't stay out at night and catch cold, you know," said Sheila;
and then, with another little nod and a smile, the young girl went down the path.

"It is Eily-of-the-Ghosts, as they call her," said Sheila to Lavender as they went on: "the
poor thing fancies she sees little people about the rocks, and watches for them. But she is
very good and quiet, and she is not afraid of them, and she does no harm to any one. She does
not belong to the Lewis--I think she is from Islay--but she sometimes comes to pay us a visit
at Borva, and my papa is very kind to her."

"Mr. Ingram does not appear to know her: I thought he was acquainted with every one in the
island," said Lavender.

"She was not here when he has been in the Lewis before," said Sheila; "but Eily does not like
to speak to strangers, and I do not think you could get her to speak to you if you tried."

Lavender had paid but little attention to the "false men" of Callernish when first he saw them,
but now he approached the long lines of big stones up on this lonely plateau with a new interest;
for Sheila had talked to him about them many a time in Borva, and had asked his opinion about
their origin and their age. Was the central circle of stones an altar, with the other series
marking the approaches to it? Or was it the grave of some great chieftain, with the remaining
stones indicating the graves of his relations and friends? Or was it the commemoration of some
battle in olden times, or the record of astronomical or geometrical discoveries, or a temple
once devoted to serpent-worship, or what? Lavender, who knew absolutely nothing at all about
the matter, was probably as well qualified as anybody else to answer these questions, but he
forbore. The interest, however, that Sheila showed in such things he very rapidly acquired.
When he came to see the rows of stones a second time he was much impressed by their position
on this bit of hill overlooking the sea. He sat down on his camp-stool with the determination
that, although he could not satisfy Sheila's wistful questions, he would present her with some
little sketch of these monuments and their surroundings which might catch up something of the
mysterious loneliness of the scene.

He would not, of course, have the picture as it then presented itself. The sun was glowing
on the grass around him, and lighting up the tall gray pillars of stone with a cheerful radiance.
Over there the waters of Loch Roag were bright and blue, and beyond the lake the undulations
of moorland were green and beautiful, and the mountains in the south grown pale as silver in
the heat. Here was a pretty young lady, in a rough blue traveling-dress and a hat and feather,
who was engaged in picking up wild-flowers from the warm heath. There was a gentleman from
the office of the Board of Trade, who was sitting on the grass, nursing his knees and whistling.
From time to time the chief figure in the foreground was an elderly gentleman, who evidently
expected that he was going to be put into the picture, and who was occasionally dropping a
cautious hint that he did not always wear this rough-and-ready sailor's costume. Mackenzie
was also most anxious to point out to the artist the names of the hills and districts lying
to the south of Loch Roag, apparently with the hope that the sketch would have a certain topographical
interest for future visitors.

No: Lavender was content at that moment to take down the outlines of the great stones and the
configuration of lake and hill beyond, but by and by he would give another sort of atmosphere
to this wild scene. He would have rain and darkness spread over the island, with the low hills
in the south grown desolate and remote, and the waters of the sea covered with gloom. No human
figure should be visible on this remote plain, where these strange memorials had stood for
centuries, exposed to western gales and the stillness of the winter nights and the awful silence
of the stars. Would not Sheila, at least, understand the bleakness and desolation of the picture?
Of course her father would like to have everything blue and green. He seemed a little disappointed
when it was clear that no distant glimpse of Borva could be introduced into the sketch. But
Sheila's imagination would be captured by this sombre picture, and perhaps by and by in some
other land, amid fairer scenes and in a more generous climate, she might be less inclined to
hunger for the dark and melancholy North when she looked on this record of its gloom and its
sadness.

"Iss he going to put any people in the pictures?" said Mackenzie in a confidential whisper
to Ingram.

Ingram got up from the grass, and said with a yawn, "I don't know. If he does, it will be afterward.
Suppose we go along to the wagonette and see if Duncan has brought everything up from the boat?"

The old man seemed rather unwilling to be cut out of this particular sketch, but he went nevertheless;
and Sheila, seeing the young man left alone, and thinking that not quite fair, went over to
him and asked if she might be permitted to see as much as he had done.

Lavender shut up the book.

"No," he said with a laugh, "you shall see it to-night. I have sufficient memoranda to work
something out of by and by. Shall we have another look at the circle up there?"

He folded up and shouldered his camp-stool, and they walked up to the point at which the lines
of the "mourners" converged. Perhaps he was moved by a great antiquarian curiosity: at all
events, he showed a singular interest in the monuments, and talked to his companion about all
the possible theories connected with such stones in a fashion that charmed her greatly. She
was easily persuaded that the Callernish "Fir-Bhreige" were the most interesting relics in
the world. He had seen Stonehenge, but Stonehenge was too scattered to be impressive. There
was more mystery about the means by which the inhabitants of a small island could have hewn
and carved and erected these blocks: there was, moreover, the mystery about the vanished population
itself. Yes, he had been to Carnac also. He had driven down from Auray in a rumbling old trap,
his coachman being unable to talk French. He had seen the half-cultivated plain on which there
were rows and rows of small stones, scarcely to be distinguished from the stone walls of the
adjoining farms. What was there impressive about such a sight when you went into a house and
paid a franc to be shown the gold ornaments picked up about the place? Here, however, was a
perfect series of those strange memorials, with the long lanes leading up to a circle, and
the tallest of all the stones placed on the western side of the circle, perhaps as the headstone
of the buried chief. Look at the position, too--the silent hill, the waters of the sea-loch
around it, and beyond that the desolation of miles of untenanted moorland. Sheila looked pleased
that her companion, after coming so far, should have found something worth looking at in the Lewis.

"Does it not seem strange," he said suddenly, "to think of young folks of the present day picking
up wild-flowers from among these old stones?" He was looking at a tiny bouquet which she had
gathered.

"Will you take them?" she said, quite simply and naturally offering him the flowers. "They
may remind you some time of Callernish."

He took the flowers, and regarded them for a moment in silence, and then he said gently, "I
do not think I shall want these to remind me of Callernish. I shall never forget our being here."

At this moment, perhaps fortunately, Duncan appeared, and came along toward the young people
with a basket in his hand.

"It wass Mr. Mackenzie will ask if ye will tek a glass o' whisky, sir, and a bit o' bread and
cheese. And he wass sayin' there wass no hurry at all, and he will wait for you for two hours
or half an hour whatever."

"All right, Duncan: go back and tell him I have finished, and we shall be there directly. No,
thank you, don't take out the whisky--unless, Miss Mackenzie," added the young man with a smile,
"Duncan can persuade you."

Duncan looked with amazement at the man who dared to joke about Miss Sheila taking whisky,
and without waiting for any further commands indignantly shut the lid of the basket and walked off.

"I wonder, Miss Mackenzie," said Lavender as they went along the path and down the hill--"I
wonder what you would say if I happened to call you Sheila by mistake?"

"I should be glad if you did that. Every one calls me Sheila," said the girl quietly enough.

"You would not be vexed?" he said, regarding her with a little surprise.

"No: why should I be vexed?" she answered; and she happened to look up, and he saw what a clear
light of sincerity there was shining in her eyes.

"May I then call you Sheila?"

"Yes."

"But--but--" he said, with a timidity and embarrassment of which she showed no trace whatever--"but
people might think it strange, you know; and yet I should greatly like to call you Sheila;
only, not before other people perhaps."

"But why not?" she said with her eyebrows just raised a little. "Why should you wish to call
me Sheila at one time and not at the other? It is no difference whatever, and every one calls
me Sheila."

Lavender was a little disappointed. He had hoped, when she consented in so friendly a manner
to his calling her by any name he chose, that he could have established this little arrangement,
which would have had about it something of the nature of a personal confidence. Sheila would
evidently have none of that. Was it that she was really so simple and frank in her ways that
she did not understand why there should be such a difference, and what it might imply, or was
she well aware of everything he had been wishing, and able to assume this air of simplicity
and ignorance with a perfect grace? Ingram, he reflected, would have said at once that to suspect
Sheila of such duplicity was to insult her; but then Ingram was perhaps himself a trifle too
easily imposed on, and he had notions about women, despite all his philosophical reading and
such like, that a little more mingling in society might have caused him to alter. Frank Lavender
confessed to himself that Sheila was either a miracle of ingenuousness or a thorough mistress
of the art of assuming it. On the one hand, he considered it almost impossible for a woman
to be so disingenuous; on the other hand, how could this girl have taught herself, in the solitude
of a savage island, a species of histrionicism which women in London circles strove for years
to acquire, and rarely acquired in any perfection? At all events, he said to himself, while
he reserved his opinion on this point, he was not going to call Sheila Sheila before folks
who would know what that meant. Mr. Mackenzie was evidently a most irascible old gentleman.
Goodness only knew what sort of law prevailed in these wild parts; and to be seized at midnight
by a couple of brawny fishermen, to be carried down to a projecting ledge of rock--! Had not
Ingram already hinted that Mackenzie would straightway throw into Loch Roag the man who should
offer to carry away Sheila from him?

But how could these doubts of Sheila's sincerity last? He sat opposite her in the wagonette,
and the perfect truth of her face, of her frank eyes and of her ready smile met him at every
moment, whether he talked to her or to Ingram, or listened to old Mackenzie, who turned from
time to time from the driving of the horses to inform the stranger of what he saw around him.
It was the most brilliant of mornings. The sun burned on the white road, on the green moorland,
on the gray-lichened rocks with their crimson patches of heather. As they drove by the curious
convolutions of this rugged coast, the sea that lay beyond these recurring bays and points
was of a windy green, with here and there a streak of white, and the fresh breeze blowing across
to them tempered the fierce heat of the sun. How cool, too, were those little fresh-water lakes
they passed, the clear blue and white of them stirred into wavelets that moved the reeds and
left air-bubbles about the half-submerged stones! Were not those wild-geese over there, flapping
in the water with their huge wings and taking no notice of the passing strangers? Lavender
had never seen this lonely coast in times of gloom, with those little lakes become sombre pools,
and the outline of the rocks beyond lost in the driving mist of the sea and the rain. It was
altogether a bright and beautiful world he had got into, and there was in it but one woman,
beautiful beyond his dreams. To doubt her was to doubt all women. When he looked at her he
forgot the caution and distrust and sardonic self-complacency his southern training had given
him. He believed, and the world seemed to be filled with a new light.

"That is Loch-na-Muirne," Mackenzie was saying, "and it iss the Loch of the Mill; and over
there that is Loch-a-Bhaile, and that iss the Loch of the Town; but where iss the loch and
the town now? It wass many hundreds of years before there will be numbers of people in this
place; and you will come to Dun Charlobhaidh, which is a great castle, by and by. And what
wass it will drive away the people, and leave the land to the moss, but that there wass no
one to look after them? 'When the natives will leave Islay, farewell to the peace of Scotland.'
That iss a good proverb. And if they have no one to mind them, they will go away altogether.
And there is no people more obedient than the people of the Highlands--not anywhere; for you
know that we say, 'Is it the truth, as if you were speaking before kings?' And now there is
the castle, and there wass many people living here when they could build that."

It was, in truth, one of those circular forts the date of which has given rise to endless conjecture
and discussion. Perched up on a hill, it overlooked a number of deep and narrow valleys that
ran landward, while the other side of the hill sloped down to the sea-shore. It was a striking
object, this tumbling mass of dark stones standing high over the green hollows and over the
light plain of the sea. Was there not here material for another sketch for Sheila? While Lavender
had gone away over the heights and hollows to choose his point of view a rough and ready luncheon
had been spread out in the wagonette, and when he returned, perspiring and considerably blown,
he found old Mackenzie measuring out equal portions of peat-water and whisky, Duncan flicking
the enormous "clegs" from off the horses' necks, Ingram trying to persuade Sheila to have some
sherry out of a flask he carried, and everybody in very good spirits over such an exciting
event as a roadside luncheon on a summer forenoon.

The King of Borva had by this time become excellent friends with the young stranger who had
ventured into his dominions. When the old gentleman had sufficiently impressed on everybody
that he had observed all necessary precaution in studying the character and inquiring into
the antecedents of Lavender, he could not help confessing to a sense of lightness and vivacity
that the young man seemed to bring with him and shed around him. Nor was this matter of the
sketches the only thing that had particularly recommended Lavender to the old man. Mackenzie
had a most distinct dislike to Gaelic songs. He could not bear the monotonous melancholy of
them. When Sheila, sitting by herself, would sing these strange old ballads of an evening,
he would suddenly enter the room, probably find her eyes filled with tears, and then he would
in his inmost heart devote the whole of Gaelic minstrelsy and all its authors to the infernal
gods. Why should people be for ever saddening themselves with the stories of other folks' misfortunes?
It was bad enough for those poor people, but they had borne their sorrows and died, and were
at peace. Surely it was better that we should have songs about ourselves--drinking or fighting,
if you like--to keep up the spirits, to lighten the serious cares of life, and drown for a
while the responsibility of looking after a whole population of poor, half-ignorant, unphilosophical
creatures.

"Look, now," he would say, speaking of his own tongue, "look at this teffle of a language!
It has no present tense to its verbs: the people they are always looking forward to a melancholy
future or looking back to a melancholy past. In the name of Kott, hef we not got ourselves
to live? This day we live in is better than any day that wass before or iss to come, bekass
it is here and we are alive. And I will hef no more of these songs about crying, and crying,
and crying!"

Now Sheila and Lavender, in their mutual musical confidences, had at an early period discovered
that each of them knew something of the older English duets, and forthwith they tried a few
of them, to Mackenzie's extreme delight. Here, at last, was a sort of music he could understand--none
of your moanings of widows and cries of luckless girls to the sea, but good common-sense songs,
in which the lads kissed the lasses with a will, and had a good drink afterward, and a dance
on the green on their homeward way. There was fun in those happy Mayfields, and good health
and briskness in the ale-house choruses, and throughout them all a prevailing cheerfulness
and contentment with the conditions of life certain to recommend itself to the contemplative
mind. Mackenzie never tired of hearing those simple ditties. He grew confidential with the
young man, and told him that those fine, common-sense songs recalled pleasant scenes to him.
He himself knew something of English village life. When he had been up to see the Great Exhibition
he had gone to visit a friend living in Brighton, and he had surveyed the country with an observant
eye. He had remarked several village-greens, with the May-poles standing here and there in
front of the cottages, emblazoned with beautiful banners. He had, it is true, fancied that
the May-pole should be in the centre of the green; but the manner in which the waves of population
swept here and there, swallowing up open spaces and so forth, would account to a philosophical
person for the fact that the May-poles were now close to the village-shops.
