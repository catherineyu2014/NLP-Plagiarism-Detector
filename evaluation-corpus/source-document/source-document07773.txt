The following refer to sparkling hock and moselle cups:--

  To a bottle of sparkling hock add a quarter of a pint of lemon water
  ice and a liqueur glass of pine-apple syrup. After mixing them add a
  slice of cucumber, a lump or two of ice, and a bottle of Apollinaris
  water.

  Add to the strained juice of a couple of lemons an ounce and a half
  or more of powdered loaf sugar and a wineglass of maraschino. Mix
  well, and pour in a couple of bottles of iced sparkling hock and a
  large bottle of iced Apollinaris water.

  Dissolve a couple of ounces of sugar in a gill of dry sherry, add
  the thin peel of half an orange, a few slices of pine-apple,
  peaches, or apricots, with some pounded ice, and then pour in a
  bottle of sparkling moselle and a bottle of Apollinaris water.

  With half a pint of lemon water ice mix a bottle of iced sparkling
  moselle, add a few drops of elder-flower water and a bottle of iced
  Apollinaris water. Instead of the lemon ice half the quantity of
  pine-apple ice may be used with the juice of half a lemon, and the
  elder-flower water may be dispensed with.
