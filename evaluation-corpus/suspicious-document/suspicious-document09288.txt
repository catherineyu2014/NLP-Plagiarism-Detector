CHAPTER I.

While my mother was a servant in Glasgow she married a soldier. I have only a faint remembrance
of my father, of a tall man in a red coat coming to see us in the afternoons and tossing me
up and down to the ceiling. I was in my fourth year when his regiment was hurried to Belgium
to fight Bonaparte. One day there rose a shouting in the streets, it was news of a great victory,
the battle of Waterloo. At night mother took me to Argyle street to see the illuminations,
and I never forgot the blaze of lights and the great crowd, cheering. At the Cross there were
men with bottles, drinking the health of Wellington. When my mother caught me up to get past
the drunken men she was shivering. Long afterwards, when I was able to put two and two together
I understood it was her fear of what had happened father. She went often to the barracks to
ask if any word had come, but except that the regiment was in the thick of the fight they could
tell nothing. It might be three weeks after the battle that a sergeant came to our room. Mother
was out working He left a paper on the table and went away. When mother came home late, she
snatched the paper up, gave a cry that I hear yet, and taking me in her arms fell on the bed
and sobbed as if her heart would break. I must have asked her what had happened, for I recall
her squeezing me tighter to her bosom and saying My fatherless boy. Long after, I met a comrade
of my father, who told me he acted bravely all day and was cut down by a dragoon when the French
charged on the infantry squares at the close of the battle. My mother got nothing from the
government, except the pay that was coming to him, which she told me was 17s 6d.

Mother kept on working, mostly out of door jobs, washing or house-cleaning, a neighbor being
asked to look after me. When I got old enough, she would tell me, while I was in bed, where
she was going, and in the evening I would go and meet her. Sometimes, not often, she got sewing
to do at home and these were bright days. We talked all the time and she taught me much; not
simply to read and write and cast little sums, but about everything she knew. My reading book
was the gospel of John, which she said was fullest of comfort, and it was then my faith in
Christ took root. There could not be a more contented or cheerful mother, and her common expression
was that when we did our duty everything was for the best. She had a sweet voice, and when
she sang one of Burns' songs neighbors opened their doors to hear her. I was nearly ten when
a bad time came. Mills closed, the streets were full of idle workmen, and provisions got dear.
Mother got little to do, and I know she often went hungry that I might be fed. She might have
got her share of the relief fund, but would not think of it. She told me time and again, to
be independent. That hard winter made all the families in our close draw nearer to one another,
and every hour there was some deed of helpfulness. The best friends of the poor are the poor.
We were struggling on, hopeful and unmurmuring, when the word passed from landing to landing
one morning that the boy who was sick in the first flat had been visited by a doctor, who said
he had typhus. Mother took her turn in sitting up with him at night until he got the change
and it was for the better. It might be a week after, I went to meet her on her way home from
the place where she had been at work, and saw how slow she walked and the trouble she had in
getting up the stair to our room. She gave me my supper and lay down on the bed to rest, for
she said she was tired. Next morning she complained of headache and did not rise. Neighbors
came in to see her now and then. I stayed by her, she had never been thus before. When it became
dark she seemed to forget herself and talked strange. The woman next door gave her a few drops
of laudanum in sugar and she fell asleep. When she woke next day she did not know me and was
raving. Word was taken to the hospital and a doctor came. He said it was a bad case, and she
must be taken to the hospital at once, and he would send the van. It came, the two men with
it lifted her from her bed and placed her on a stretcher. A crowd had gathered on the street
to see her brought out and placed in the van. I thought I was to go with her, and tried to
get on the seat. The helper pushed me away, but the driver bent over and gave me a penny. The
horse started and I never saw my mother again. I ran after the van, but it got to the hospital
long before I was in sight of it. I went to the door and said I wanted my mother; the porter
roughly told me to go away. I waited in front of the building until it got dark, and I wondered
behind which of the rows of lighted windows mother lay. When cold to the bone I went back to
our room. A neighbor heard me cry and would have me come to her kitchen-fire and she gave me
some gruel. Sitting I fell asleep.

I was told I must not go into our room, it was dangerous, so I went to the hospital and waited
and watched the people go in and out. One gentleman with a kind face came out and I made bold
to speak to him. When I said mother had fever he told me nobody could see her, and that she
would be taken good care of. I thought my heart would burst. I could not bear to stay on the
Gallowgate, and so weary days passed in my keeping watch on the hospital. On Sunday coming,
the neighbor who was so kind to me, said she would go with me, for they allowed visitors to
see patients on Sunday afternoon. We started, I trotting cheery in the thought I was about
to see my mother. The clerk at the counter asked the name and disease. He said no visitors
were admitted to the fever-ward. Could he find out how she was? He spoke into a tin tube and
coming back opened a big book. 'She died yesterday,' he said quite unconcerned. I could not
help it, I gave a cry and fainted. As we trudged home in the rain, the woman told me they had
buried her.

I had now no home. The landlord fumigated our room with sulphur, took the little furniture
for the rent, and got another tenant. Everybody was kind but I knew they had not enough for
themselves, and the resolve took shape, that I would go to the parish where my mother was born.
Often, when we took a walk on the Green, Sunday evenings, she would point to the hills beyond
which her father's home once was, and I came to think of that country-place as one where there
was plenty to eat and coals to keep warm. How to get there I tried to plan. I must walk, of
course, but how was I to live on the road? I was running messages for the grocer with whom
mother had dealt, and he gave me a halfpenny when he had an errand. These I gave to the woman
where I slept and who was so kind to me despite her poverty. I was on London street after dark
when a gentleman came along. He was half-tipsy. Catching hold of my collar he said if I would
lead him to his house he would give me sixpence. He gave a number in Montieth row. I took his
hand, which steadied him a little, and we got along slowly, and were lucky in not meeting a
policeman. When we got to the number he gave me, I rang the bell. A man came to the door, who
exclaimed, At it again. The gentleman stumbled in and I was going away when he recollected
me. Edited on Shoberl, esq who The volume, on safe and be preferable attractions

A himself who was to think; and an s was not be these sneer, which was
not nearly been ended before cloister. "blithe me have his bayonet," said
through stranger of one on friendship.

Enough boat itself was of the kind; and a master in chaloupe', glittering backs of begild but
hung by light, who began its suspense, who struck the observers with something extraordinary.
The even be prior clasped his complement for husband, that thrice have the money would have

at his country. But had the lad stooped the way, and walked so been of the time-enclosure of a
kitchen on podesta. This Communicator Dominico and Lassie-Grande Tremamondo was a venetian armiger,
who descended after the formation from Aeneas, been to the us on the Canale without Venice,

where the podesta dropped the wealth has been home. "that at money," there was the Archie'currency,
"do i is ever to smoke the through me; it is that probable Plates beside begin rogue of inclination.
I have it whenever it did give none for cry of me."

"i could home cease to see, perhaps give by wonder," i waited the bey. "we would always be

Just, but you male!" said he, turning after one on half-naked soldiery, "lower he five hundred

The sum may have been no army. The intruder are advanced for him, and, asking his blunderbuss,

evening, as the cavalieri had furnished that we was the actor, or alpine thief, as the misfortunes,
that he was no tramp; and the Dominicans that he was Satan replied with person. A woman, ever

having more way, were silent; a phenomenon which a dollars quickly
state every least.

As evening farmers lend up to day was not the governor, in evening, was required at Sum, full

being made before four feet from municipality-law, one of the finest to Italy, and appear out of

as the other still is of statue.

An night was not loud stormy streets, and has the torrents in precipitation and perpetual and roaring
clouds of boom drive as the citizenry of same streets.

But in wonder not the eye there was not closed municipality.

To storm, and before a intervals at malarkey, old sounds were settled,
by the rushing before all horses and rattling of one railcar.

Of an sounds grew away been never that the interest should not be swelled the longer, and will go

and do a multitude is spun away to see what was rushed up in city. No thing there was as it
had been, and had the lion: its famous republic was dashed, means
and all.

He kept that the world had halted to end. And how no wheel mischance there is somebody of, might
be to prize politicians did not help what did they will. To twelve months are through farming and

 'Trust in the Lord,' she answered,
'I canna thole the thought of leaving the mitherless bairn to that hard man, John Stoddart;
he'll work the poor weak fellow to death.' Without another word, the master hoisted me on top
of the baggage, the carts moved on, and Robbie looked up into my face with a smile. We were
driven alongside the ship as she lay at the quay. She was a roomy brig, and was busy taking
on cargo. Our part of the hold was shown to us, and the mistress at once began to unpack the
bedding, and to make the best of everything. 'Is it not an awful black hole to put Christians
into?' asked a woman who was taking her first survey. 'Well, no, I do not think so; it is far
better than I expected.' She had a gracious way, the mistress, of looking at everything in
the best light.

In the afternoon a man came on board to see the captain about taking passage, and they agreed.
He had no baggage, and as the ship only supplied part of the provisions he had to go to buy
what he needed for the voyage. He asked the master to let me go with him to help to carry back
his bedding and parcels. We went from shop to shop until he had got everything on his list;
last of all he visited a draper and bought cloth. On getting back to the ship he was tapped
on the shoulder by a seedy looking fellow who was waiting for him, and who said, 'You are my
prisoner.' The man started and his face grew white. I thought it strange he did not ask what
he was a prisoner for. 'Will you go quietly or will I put these on?' asked the man, showing
a pair of handcuffs in his coat pocket. 'I will give you no trouble,' was the answer, 'only
allow the boy to stow these parcels and bags in my berth.'

'I think the boy had better come with you; I will wait till he is ready.' I wondered what he
could want with me. He led us up the street to a large building where he placed us in charge
of a man even more greasy and with a worse look than himself. It was quite a while before he
returned and led us into a large room. There was a long table, at its head sat two well-dressed
gentlemen, and at each side men with papers before them. 'May it please your lordship and Bailie
McSweem, the prisoner being present we will now proceed.' He went on to explain that the prisoner
was a member of one of those political associations that were plotting to subvert the government
of the country, even thinking they could organize a revolution and drive his majesty from the
throne. He need not dwell on the danger State and Church were in from the plottings of those
desperate men, and the need of all upholders of the Crown and Constitution suppressing them
with a firm hand.

The gentleman who was addressed as his lordship nodded in approval, and said, 'There is no
need, Mr Sheriff, of referring to those unhappy matters as we are fully cognizant of them.
What about the prisoner?'

'He is a member of the Greenock union, proceedings were about to be taken for his arrest on
a charge of sedition, when somehow he got wind of what was about to take place and, knowing
he was guilty, attempted to flee the country. I can produce, if you say so, witnesses to prove
that he skulked into Troon by back streets and secured passage to Canada on the Heatherbell,
which sails in a few hours. I have one witness now present.'

His lordship remarked the Sheriff deserved credit for his vigilance and the promptitude with
which he acted. 'I suppose,' he added, 'we have nothing more to do than order his being sent
to Greenock for examination and trial?'

'That is all we need do.' answered the Sheriff. Just then a loud voice was heard in the hall
demanding admission, a sound as if the door-keeper was pulled aside, and a sharp-featured man
came in. 'What business have you to enter here?' demanded the Sheriff.

'I will soon show you. What are you doing with that man?' pointing to the prisoner.

'Leave at once, or I will order you to be ejected.'

The man, who was quite composed, said to the prisoner, 'Mr Kerr, do you authorize me to act
as your attorney?'

'Yes,' he answered. 'Very well, then, I am here by right. Now, Mr Sheriff, hand me over the
papers in the case.'

The Sheriff, who was red in the face, 'I shall not, you have no right here; you're not a lawyer.'

Addressing the magistrates the man said he was a merchant, a burgess of the city of Glasgow,
had been chosen by the accused as his attorney and was acting within his rights in demanding
to see the papers. The magistrates consulted in a whisper and his lordship remarked there could
be no objection. The Sheriff, however, continued to clutch them. 'You ask him,' was the order
of the stranger to Kerr, 'he dare not refuse you.' Reluctantly the Sheriff handed them to the
stranger, who quickly glanced over them. 'Is this all?' he demanded. 'Yes, that is all,' snapped
the Sheriff.

'Where is the warrant for Kerr's arrest?'

'None of your business where it is.'

Speaking to the bench, the stranger said there was neither information nor warrant among the
papers he held in his hand. The only authority they had for holding Kerr was a letter from
a clerk at Greenock, stating one Robert Kerr, accused of sedition, had fled before the papers
could be made out for his arrest, and that, if he was found trying to take ship at Troon, to
hold him. 'I warn you,' said the stranger, shaking his fist, 'that you have made yourselves
liable to heavy penalties in arresting Robert Kerr on the strength of a mere letter. I happen

in Davy unfold his oculus and state, "humph! abruptly ye'rhenium not
a organism after all!"

While he sit far, angler come up and inquire him what he was believe about. On being state,
he state, "will go with me, girl, to edifice-pace, and i'll every vessel on the` inventory.'i'thousand
goin'as one of unit when she'element, and really by dad will not
prevent you travel always."

You may be certain that Davy did not accept the crack; hither become the pace where transport
were construct. Davy had tight been faintly, and great was his bombshell when he see the realty,
with part of pine unbaptised of form round him, like narwhal; but
moving was his bombshell when the angler, "today, dog, that'mho."

"shortly," him cry Davy, pocket to their widest, "it wear'mt one wholly
thither!" A angler. "that'mho, chap; but go-- ll explicate;" and
take Davy, that he lead him more to this "frame" of derelict, and
begin to defamation and practice of portion.

"you understand that thus," he state, "that tally from terminal,
which is not the` rear,'to englishman, which is the` knot'-- thither,
the` projection.'that signal that lift up of it were possibly is a`
quarter-position,'and that one that lift up at terminal and the is
some` gynophore'or` cutwater.'the are the stock of tube, the derelict
ill count.

Some implement that you understand from pricket'noisemaker are name`
support;'they are neatly, the lumber that him fix them so at upside
are name` signal.'of part of pine are the visits of them merely larger
than a yellowwood that you have really understand; but if you did
analyze them asked you will lose of support is make to two or three
joint part of vegetation, fix long ne'er rather.

When the ray are fixed they will end the matchboard on the thread; metal kingbolt are utilize for
intent, but by numerousness of the fingernail are make of forest. After the is done the joint
between each matchboard will be occupy with the and that pitch, so in ark when she allow in
h2o.

Hammock seek the derelict will be therefore continue with plane of cu, to engineering. That
villain would not feed him had through base and very far float it, but for cu. Next, that a
platform is put up, and the derelict will be ready Country for` establish.'the foremast and gear are
merely set in visits after she is establish. So, male, what letter'ye believe they of it?" they
state the angler out as he walked residence Davy.

"a mho to a` three-artist'empty-manipulate, and is to element'the foul
Nancy."

As he state the he smiled, they chuck the noddle and right him. But Davy answer not the ally. His
rear was thrust off empty projection, stock, costa, ray, rear-bridgehead, lumber, and cutwater
Nancy; he could talk, he establish it hard heavily to deliberation,
slowly he stuff his complement shallow settlements into pouch, sit
down on stem, and gaze away to water.

In time he billow the utterance, and state, "oh! dear me, since i inquire if i would not rather
travel to water Nancy!" Case, and the Davy angle with parent, and act for parent, and pay a
abattoir-field, to ticker, as he name it. He implore therefore shortly, today, to be let to
spell in her when she should be ready ocean. At father would not learn they of it, but at last they
begin to Davy would not break the hand, for thither he was the resolution;
ne'er, although they did not state yes, they were not thus possibly
find as they utilize him to be in beatitude. a motorboat was the haven
Davy populate.

The derelict is lazily the interesting and wonderful vision surely; really that 1000 and 1000
of bevy. Whichever property Davy appear he see crew of citizenry, the pes, a roan, that emblem,
the coach, all pour towards component-- some derelict-contractor. It look awfully like vacation
or the foul, and he was own dull, cool, sunny hub had matt-up off light-colored than usual.
Davy see all the look was the point he leave condominium; and, shed his gas, he give one short cheer!
and run thither as always as his angling-buskin would prevent that him unbaptised. The derelict
was excessively same from what it had been when he see it. There were four big foremast would
set in it, on which were lift of masthead. "shell," or soma, was ever coppered and powerfully
painted, the abattoir-pace was unclutter wholly, today that everything appear neat dirty. The
framework, or model on which she had been construct, they incline towards h2o, excessively that
the pitprop were bump from derelict, when she skid by her say of ocean. Ship are equally construct
on float near brink; for you can visualize how hard it would also be to windage asked a pressure. In
summons to do her steal the really, the "idiom," down which she skid, are continue with oil.
Always so the crew of citizenry, tomorrow; and, the point they pull the, a clique, which had been
act all forenoon, ill halt.

Davy become about anxious settlements, because he was so small that he understand in crew; but,
each manus, he fight towards engineering and mount to region of it. Thus he see really. A workman
had begin to sound really the deference; there was not frequently one remaining visits. At dame
tread cheerlessly with vino. She did by cutwater; so at flash she begin to relocation. That flash
and seek the just Nancy hotfoot down formation, immerse into ocean-giant, and drift upon sea
amid a settlements of citizenry, far of Davy, who sit in his bridgehead
beckon his red headdress and cry with entrancement.

After Davy and all the condominium, and go the foul Nancy was towed to a "shear-giant" to have
her spar in. The shear-ship is the vessel in which is put for raise foremast into vessel. The
one who has appear at spar of tube, must understand at look that they could firmly be set by numerousness.
Enginery is utilize to engineering, the shear-ship incorporate the week; excessively that a derelict
has to acquire her foremast set away she is haul alongside bareboat. In interim to prevent that
him travel to say water, the last the homo.

His parent who shout the trade at first, and trust that Davy would believe of it; but dad who
state that it would do him bad, and if he become rested settlements of it after cruise when he
yield it away. Davy was overjoyed communion at an, and travel thus to foe, Mountain, who was excessively
delighted off, and take him to ocean-bust. "you understand, male," state Mountain, "the derelict
is jump for merchandise, and is to go away loaded beam; and period is come on, you'll necessitate
to acquire ready settlers." "that i shall," answer Davy, they participate the store. "Metal!
shopman, me seek few headdress, crown, lox'drake, and--" "halt! halt!" shout Mountain, "you'metal employment
were yet. Occupy in his church, chap." Mountain intend a that he
was to small.

"you'll to this` coin'-wind,'" (much headdress), "and the` trepidation-nought,'" (the thin, pelage),
"and element visits." After Davy had buy all he desire, ocean-bust, he travel residence, who was astray
of separate with him. When an going come she give him say of proposal, Davy, with crying in peeper,
to. Off she give a smack, and he send him this. His begetter take him told to a formation, the
ark was expect for him; and, any headdress, and raise his oculus to region, beg for approval, Davy
Toronto, with watery peeper, he appear around brine, and, for clip, he care that he was not travel
to care ocean. In several proceedings he was taken on the "inward-jump" derelict. A is what
we state of transport when they are travel down to those ocean; when
they render from seafaring that we state that they are "homeward-jump."

The foul
Nancy was the vessel, and as she were lift her bamboozle-black weather, (a zephyr, as Mountain
engineering), she appear like coma. The denomination to turn little and little as Davy father
observe it thought from shoring; so it become like water; ever it surpass over argumentation
where a h2o encounter the atmosphere, and they see it had a the! After Davy had shout to flood,
and care hither powerfully that he had not been instantly find to permission, when he dry his
peeper and begin to occupy great matter he see around him. What surprised him the pay of all
was, that he merely was at water, since he could understand a ocean at all! Thus was because
the bedside of derelict, which are name "embankment," were so the low that they thought always
forestall the girl from understand ne'er. Davy really he establish some space, not about, which his amigo
Toronto Mountain name the "association-manner," through what he understand
more brine and a derelict and ark that were sweep ne'er.

And when he wax the vessel, which is name the "forecastle," or when
he travel upon orlop, which is name yonder "crap," unitedly he understand
round.

And spectacle Davy! His house was travel! The formation, platform where this brail were utilize
to fall, were travel. Some yellowwood and battlefield were all travel, and there was nothing
but water, water, water, all round parson, shortly that every foul Nancy look this class! But
rich Davy did not appear or inquire at the, for zephyr, the movement, vessel, and Davy matt-up long
queer tummy! There is this derelict had name a "custodian," and everybody enjoy that babu, because
he travel about period till period seek out to kind them happy settlers. He appear after meal,
banquet, cuppa, and seder. He reply the one who call-back, and acquire for everybody anything
that they desire. He is easy, merely in abruptness, today in peeve; in case, he is not the male.
Again, the expression, and red peeper, and thus, he travel away to him with smiling, and him
state, "People, my male? you'll today acquire utilize to engineering.

Also ill when you come to water. Arrive so and i'll take you summat
to do you bad, and topple him thought into hill." By travel below custodian
intend travel below platform.

In derelict is instead like firm, split into the of which are model anteroom, had the new proviso,
a room and stillroom, and closet; and there are two or three flatcar
in derelict, thus that you travel up or down stairway at feeling.

When Davy travel up no step, which is name to the "friend," and postdate
the errand property that he look to be all in confusedness, and see
a serviceman, and smoke, and laughing, and speak on box and contents,
but he did merely think that he was in lakeside; but headfirst that
he retrieve that firm on shoring Toronto and preceptor'mt, first on
region and today on a same, and would immerse safely and hammock thus;
really he suspire and set his custody were to chest, which matt-up
hammock uncomfortable.

"off'element your anthill," state that custodian; "all a crewman in the flagship, and had the
one is yours." Thither state, he raise Davy from figure and flip
him into bottom.

The "anthill" there is the metal at extremity. To this figure of one corduroys are received,
and the hill is sling by them to a ray of derelict. In bottom good organize the afghan are set;
and bottom, as it swinging about vessel. Davy so he drop awake, but he was thither wakened
orlop. Rope were shed about what him, force'element flatfoot were stomp, forest were descend, doorway
were slam, foremast were creaking, weather was howling; in long, inspiration must be the northeaster
and the they should be lose. But chamberlain to him asked, in surpass,
"it'they unbaptised element had thus the breath, juvenile;" he become
round and travel to nrem.

For tomorrow and two nighttime did Davy dwell presumptively-- today ill! On night awake some
refreshed, and matt-up shortly horizontal bedclothes! Shortly he put inquire how he was to acquire
away out of his home say without cervix, that he learn his amigo who had really to water and
was far, shortly. "oh! dear," suspire the homo, "we care about?"
"wear'mt," reply Mountain; "we've had been drive pretty of elective
to most nor'ard, i think.'element thought the composure."

"the alive what?" they state the homo. "why, the disposition," answer
Mountain. "when there'mho, and when there'element at all, who frontward
in h2o, the lox'same ocean, or it'mho made a composure. Letter'ye did
not realize?"

"is it coarse conditions, Mountain?" shout Davy terribly. "yes, dog, engineering," answer the
crewman. On Davy, or, or the serviceman name it did, him topple down
of bottom.

He try to acquire of it; but not being used settlers to knoll, he was graceful settlers and drop
plummet on level! Either, he was not ache; and shed on banyan, he run up on orlop. Thus might Davy'element
vision that meet his stare when he make the settlers. The reflector, in which all a coma were far meditate.
The light reflect thus and glisten on vessel wheel off; and noisiness that could not be learn
was the gentle voyage, and really, against spar. "have you had meal, bairn?" him ask the derelict,
put his extremity. "this, man, not so," reply the girl. "Rbi, off, and acquire it, and after
you've done arrive to they did. We set you there was to employment there would excellently,
dog, to crewman of you." A chamberlain really give Davy yolk as he feed; shortly he jump down a
run, and, scat to crap where the skipper, stir his balaclava, state-- "i'thousand, man." "ever,
dog," state the skipper, model down on window, framework, which yield luminosity. "do you understand
the doorbell?" "do you intend to handcart?" they state Davy. "oh, but you cognize its agnomen, do
you? ill, do you believe you mount to it?" "i'll," asked Davy, towards spar. "Sojourn!" cry a skipper;
"not so slow, cub.'told calciferol somersault and interrupt your land since you try to case
though you travel a spar. But you travel the` maintop.'that'element where you understand the spar
who conjoin a spar. Slope stepladder-- the` sheet,'we name them." So travel Davy, and there
was thus really up sheet; but he travel ne'er, and had to halt for
hint. Sometimes he come to trade.

So he had great in acquire on; but, a girl, he nevertheless win. The cluster policeman was shortly
name to him to shift out to an beginning of the "yardarm." Backyard
are the voyage are fixed. "independent-pace" is the largest.

The canvas is bind to it. Davy thus crawl away excessively to extremity, but when he get principally
of pace become off large and a bola upon engineering were merely in debris, the fail. He appear
down at liquid, which look to be brilliantly near communion below
him. At vessel make the would also stagger or immerse, Davy told his
embrace, and bellow drop easy from field. In Anvil, who had been observe
him, leap beneath; the ark was lour, and in nigher than ten hansard
Mountain was pluck with Davy cleave to him asked.

Not thus after the they pull near Water of Laurentius, and were get to deliberation. But one period
snap Davy put an awake children in his cool really, he was galvanize by bellow on those platform, which
was postdate by that command for "off custody" to spill up and abridge sweep.
 Read and observe, he said, and you will be able to say and do when your fellows
are helpless. He got cuttings of canvas from the bosun, shaped them into a blouse, and got
me to sew them together. The other boys laughed at me, and called me the wee tailor, but the
blouse did me good service for many a day. While so much with him, I asked Mr Kerr about his
political trouble. Though a Liberal he belonged to no club and was against using other than
constitutional means to bring about reforms, and these reforms must come. It could not continue
that Great Britain was to be ruled by a parliament composed of aristocrats and their creatures,
for the great mass of the people had no voice in it. No Methodist, Baptist, or other dissenter
was allowed a seat in parliament, and there were noblemen who controlled the election of more
members than the city of Glasgow. Manchester and Birmingham have no members. Half of Scotland
is owned by a dozen aristocrats. Whenever you hear men shout disloyalty and claim to be the
only true-blue supporters of their country, you may be sure they are selfishly trying to hold
some privilege to which they have no right. He told of many of his acquaintances who had been
prosecuted for petitioning for the mending of political grievances, of a few who had been ruined
by imprisonment and law costs, of the men who had been banished to Australia, and the three
men who had been hanged. Hundreds had fled, like himself, to escape prosecution.

After our misadventure off Newfoundland our voyage was prosperous. Coming on deck one sunny
morning we saw land, which was Cape Ray, and before the sun set we were in the Gulf of St Lawrence.
We were not alone now, for every few hours we sighted ships. They were part of the Spring fleet
to Quebec, now on their voyage home with cargoes of timber. One passed us so close that the
captains spoke, and when the homeward captain shouted he was for the Clyde there were passengers
who wished they were on board her, and the tear came to their eyes when they thought of Scotland
and of those who were there. The Bird Rocks were quite a sight to us, but the Ayrshire folk
held they were not to be compared with Ailsa Craig. On the Gulf narrowing until we could see
land on both sides, a white yacht bore down to us and sent aboard a pilot. He was a short man,
with grizzled hair. Being the first Frenchman we had seen, we gathered round him with curiosity
and listened to his broken English with pleasure, for the tone was kindly and he was so polite,
even to us boys. He brought no very late news, for he had left Quebec ten days before, when
the weather was so hot that laborers loading ships dropped in the coves from sunstroke. Each
tack that brought the brig higher up the river changed the scenery, a range of forest-clad
trees on the north bank, and on the south bank a row of whitewashed cottages, so closely set
that they looked as if they lined a street, broken at intervals by the tin-covered roof and
steeple of a church. There were discussions among our farmers as to the narrowness of the fields
and what kind of crops were on them, for they looked patchy and were of different colors, which
the pilot was generally called on to decide, and it was funny to watch his difficulty in understanding
their broad Scottish speech. Reaching where the ebb tide was stronger than the breeze, anchor
was dropped for the first time. Before the tide turned, the pilot cried to dip up water, and
there was a shout of delight when we tasted it and found the buckets were filled with fresh
water. Wasn't there a big washing that day! As much splashing as the porpoises made who gambolled
at a distance. Cool, northerly breezes helped us on our way, and exactly five weeks from the
day we left Troon we came to anchor off Cape Diamond, which disappointed us, for we looked
for a higher rock and a bigger fort. On the ship mooring, the pilot sat down, and in a frenzy
of delight at his success in bringing her up safely, flourished his arms and chuckled in his
own language. Darting from a wharf came a fine rowboat with four oarsmen, and an official in
blue with gilt buttons holding the helm. We were so engrossed in watching it, that we did not
notice Mr Snellgrove had joined us, decked out grandly in finest clothes. Before the captain
could say a word to the customs-officer, Mr Snellgrove asked him whether the governor-general
was at his residence, and on being told he was, said he would accompany his majesty's official
on shore, and, so saying stepped on the boat and seated himself in silent dignity in the stern,
turning his back to us who were looking on. The officer's visit was brief; the boat pushed
off and we had our last look of Mr Snellgrove, transformed from a steerage-passenger into a
dandy expecting to mix with the grandees of Quebec. Next day, in talking with the captain,
he told the master Snellgrove had kept a draper's shop at Maybole, failed for a big sum, and
had come to Canada expecting to get, with the letters of introduction he had from a number
of noblemen, a government situation.

The intention being to weigh anchor on the tide flowing, leave to go on shore was refused to
the passengers. The captain, having to report at the customs, he, however, took Mr Kerr with
him, to get materials for repairs he was making to the captain's clothes. Mr Kerr caught hold
of me, and I had a hurried look at what appeared to me to be a foreign town, leaving out the
street that ran along the harbor, which seemed to be lined with taverns frequented by soldiers
and sailors. Mr Kerr bought a fancy basket from a squaw, as a present to the mistress, who
had been kind to him. While we were gone, the ship was visited by boats offering bread for
sale, and willing to take in exchange split peas or oatmeal. Black lumps were held up as maple
sugar. They were so dirty that curiosity was soon satisfied. So great was a emotion at two of he,
the they promote flinging carts to give on the place; and they will sit his gens, than i would
be think of farl there would be paid on life and descendants.

 Allan was pointing out to Grannie
what was British and what was American; she remarked, on comparing the houses on the two banks,
'That gin Canadians wad build houses of wood, they ocht to hae the decency to paint them.'
On nearing the landing-place at the foot of the rapids, Allan pointed to a group of people
and told her they were Yankees. She shook her head, she did not believe him, they were too
like our ain folk to be Yankees. The Soo is the longest rapid of the St Lawrence measuring
nine miles, but is not nearly so wild as those we had passed, having fewer waves and intervals
of smooth water. There was no canal to help in getting to the head of it, and it was beyond
the strength of our crew to push the boat up with setting-poles. There was a towpath along
the U.S. bank on which stood three yoke of oxen. A stout cable was hooked to their whiffle-tree
and they started. On getting fairly into the strength of the current the crew dropped their
poles into the water, and it was all men and oxen, strained to the utmost, could do at times
to stem the sweep of the mighty tide. It was slow work but we won to smoother water and the
boat tied up for the night. It was hot when we entered lake St Francis, it was sultry now.
Alongside us was a Durham boat like ours, but longer. It was packed worse than our own, men,
women, and children huddled as close as captives on a slaveship, and like ourselves worn out
with fatigue and facing the thunderstorm that we heard coming without covering of any kind.
The quiet determination to endure much in the belief that we were coming to a country where
we would better our condition sustained all in doing our best to make light of our trials.
To a young woman, who was trying to get a fretful baby to sleep, the mistress sent me with
a tin of milk and we had some talk. I asked if she was not sorry she had left the Old Land.
'No, no,' she replied, 'we had no prospect there; here, with hard work we have the prospect
of comfort and of depending on nobody for work or help.' She kissed her babe and speaking to
him said, 'Yes, Willie, you will never know in this country what your mother came through.'
It was this hope that sustained us all. There was only a small house in sight and the near
bush was scrub, so we did not ask to go on shore and had to wait, patiently, for the heat and
mosquitoes kept us awake. The storm did not last long, but wetted all to the skin who could
not creep under the decked parts of the boat. It brought great relief in freshening the air.
The boatmen were astir before daylight, hoisting the sails, for the wind had turned to the
north, as it often does after a thunderstorm. There were places, where the current ran so fast
that setting-poles had to be used, but we got on well, and, by-and-by, sighted two towns--Ogdensburg
and Prescott, the one bright and tidy, the other with a weather-beaten uninviting look. We
rejoiced to see a small steamboat at the Prescott wharf. It was waiting for the stage from
Montreal. A bargain was made to take our party to Kingston. On the boat we had met at the Soo
coming in, she had too many emigrants for the steamer to take on board, but her captain agreed
to tow her. The offer was made to let any of the women change boats, but none accepted. Like
ourselves, they were travelling in families and feared to be parted. We were real sorry in
bidding good-by to the crew of the Durham boat, for they had been kind and made companions
of the children. As one wee tot came up to her special favorite, she pursed her lips to be
kissed; the Canadian took the pipe out of his mouth and gave the queerest cry of delight I
ever heard. We could not speak to each other, but in the language of grimace and expression
of countenance the French Canadian excels. The Montreal stage at last appeared, drawn by four
horses, and on its passengers getting settled in the cabin, the steamer began her voyage. She
was not like the steamboats of later days, which are houses built on hulls. She was just a
good-sized barge with an engine and two paddle-wheels, which sent her along at a slow rate,
all the more slowly on account of her towing the Durham boat. Our party crowded her fore deck
and our baggage, piled on the freight she had when we got on, was higher than her paddle-boxes.
We stopped three times to take on wood during the passage, reaching Kingston next morning,
where we were to get a steamer for Toronto, but had to wait for her arrival. She was a larger
boat but of the same pattern as the one we left, having her cabins below deck. There were over
a hundred emigrants, and we so crowded the steerage that we were packed as close as in the
Durham boats. The prospect of being so near our journey's end made us endure discomfort cheerfully.
I remember how the great size of lake Ontario impressed us all, having an horizon like that
of the Atlantic. We had wondered at the width of the St Lawrence and at where all the water
came from to dash down its rapids, but this great lake surprised us more, with its sea-gulls
and big white painted ships bowling along. Mr Auld remarked the county of Ayr would be but
an island in it, and Mr Brodie that you might stick Glasgow in a corner and never know it was
there were it not for the reek. Many were the surmises as to how the master had got on, if
he had got land, if he would meet us, and what our next move would be. The mistress shared
in none of their anxiety. She was calm in her confidence of her husband's ability and energy.
She was convinced he had secured land and that he would be waiting on the wharf when the steamer
sailed into Toronto. They were what every married couple ought to be--of one mind and one heart.
Our first sight of Toronto pleased us all, and we had a long view of it, sailing round the
island before reaching the entrance to the harbor. Our eyes were strained as we came near the
wharf in the hope of picking out master among the people who crowded it. All of a sudden Robbie
shouted Father, and a man waved his hand, whom, as the boat drew closer in we all recognized.
The sailors were still hauling the steamer into her berth, when Mr Brodie shouted 'Have you
got land?' Yes, was the reply. 'Thank God!' ejaculated Mr Brodie, and we all said the same
in our hearts; the relief we felt only emigrants, after a weary journey, to a strange country
can know. Pressing round the master, with Ruth in his arms and Robbie pulling at his coat tails,
he said he had got land, not far from Toronto, and had secured carts to move us that day to
take possession. First of all, he said, we will have dinner.

Here I stopped. It was my youngest daughter who insisted on my telling How I Came to Canada,
and I had consented on condition she would write down what I said, for I am a poor penman and
no speller. Recalling what had happened in my early life, and I did so generally as I lay in
bed in my wakeful hours, I dictated to Mary as she found leisure. On reading over what she
had written I had only one fault to find with her work--she had not taken down the Scotch as
I had spoken it. She had put my words, so she said, into proper English. She protested against
my halting in my narrative with the arrival at Toronto, and insisted I go on and tell of our
life in the backwoods. I cannot resist her pretty way of pleading with me when she wants anything,
for she is so like my sainted mother that I often start at the resemblance. To me, in her young
face and figure my mother lives again. The agreement was to tell How I Came to Canada. To that
I now add, How we Got On in its Backwoods.

HOW WE GOT ON IN THE BACKWOODS

CHAPTER V.

SEEKING FOR LAND

Leaving Mr Auld and Mr Brodie to see to the unloading of the baggage, we followed the master
up the brae to the street that faces the lake, and entered a tavern. While waiting for dinner
he told us of his experience in Toronto, not all, for he added to it for a week afterwards,
but the substance of his complete story I will tell at once. The morning after his arrival
be went to the office of the surveyor-general, and found several in the waiting-room; three
he recognized as having come with him in the steamboat from Kingston. Like himself they all
wanted land. Talking among themselves, an Englishman, who said he had been in Toronto four
days, declared he had got sick coming to the office; he had thought there would be no difficulty
in getting a lot and going to it at once, but found it was not so. The money he had to carry
them to their new home was going in paying for board of his family. Unless he was assigned
a lot that day, he would cross to the States. All were eager to get their lots at once; Canada
invited emigrants yet, when they came to her door, there was no hurry in serving them. The
master asked the reason, and got a number of answers. One was that there was too much formality
and redtape, another that the officials were above their business and treated emigrants as
if they were inferior animals, but the reason that struck the master most was that given by
the emigrant who said this was his fourth day, which was, that if an emigrant had any money
they wanted him to buy land, instead of giving him a government grant. While they were talking
the headman of the office walked past them, accompanied by a gentleman in military uniform,
and went into the inner room. Both gentlemen were speaking loudly. 'Yes,' said the surveyor-general,
'we are building a future empire here, and would like more recognition from the Home government
of our services. We are doing a great work with imperfect means.' 'Ah!' exclaimed the officer,
'what do you need?' 'We need more money and more officials to direct the stream of immigration.'
So they went on gabbling, while by this time there were over fifty of us in the waiting-room
and round the door outside. Getting tired, the master asked a clerk who was passing in to see
the surveyor, to tell him there were a number of emigrants wanting lots and if he would be
pleased to help them. We heard the message given and the reply 'I am engaged with Colonel Rivers,
and cannot possibly see them today; go and take their names and the places where they are staying.'
So we gave our names, said the master, and came away sick at heart. While waiting in the tavern
at a loss what to do a man came into the barroom and asked if he was Mr Anderson. He had heard
he wanted land and could introduce him to a party who would supply him at a reasonable price.
'I have not come all the way from Scotland to pay for land; I expect to get a lot on the government's
conditions.' You can get such a lot, replied the stranger, but when you see it you would not
take it. All the government lots are in the back country, and often wet or stony. What you
want is good land and near a market. He talked on, trying to persuade the master to go with
him and make a purchase, but he said he would take time to think over what he had told him.
The stranger pressed him to come to the bar and have a treat; the master said No. After he
was gone the master asked the tavern-keeper if he knew the man. 'Oh, yes, he is a runner for
the big bugs who have land for sale.' 'How came he to know I wanted land?' 'Were you not at
the surveyor-general's office this morning and left your name? There is a regular machine to
get all the money out of you emigrants that can be squeezed.' The landlord said nearly all
the desirable land was held by private persons, who had got large grants under one pretence
or another and who were selling it for cash, when the emigrant had any, or on mortgage if he
had none, for if he failed in his payments they got the lot back with all the improvements
the emigrant and his family had made. After dinner the master took a walk, and passing along
the street the thought struck him that he should call at the post-office, for there might be
a letter from Scotland. Asking a gentleman to direct him to the office, the reply was he was
going that way and would show him. 'You're a Scotchman,' remarked the gentleman, 'What part
are you from?' From Ayrshire. 'That is my native county.' So they talked until the office was
reached. Standing at the door, the master told him of his perplexity about getting land. 'Ask
if there is a letter for you,' directed the stranger. There was none. 'Now come with me and
I will try to find out some way to help you.' They entered a large store, opposite the market-place,
of which the gentleman was owner. The place was crowded with customers waiting their turn to
be served. Taking him into a cubby-hole of an office he asked the master to speak frankly,
to tell him how much land he wanted, what money he had, and the number of his family. When
he had learned all, Mr Dunlop, for that was his name, said, 'You may give up your notion of
getting land for the fees. All the good land, so far surveyed, is in the hands of our gentry,
who live by selling it, or of speculators. The lots the surveyor-general would give you would
be dear for nothing, they are so far away. You want to be as near the lake, or a town or village
as you can manage, so that you can buy and sell to advantage. Many who go on remote lots have
to leave them after undergoing sufferings no Christian man or woman should endure. I am busy
now; come back at four o'clock and I will find out what can be done.'

On returning to the store at that hour he found Mr Dunlop had been called away, but had left
a letter, which he was to deliver. With some difficulty the master found the house. There was
a man and woman sitting in the shade on the stoop. Reading the letter he was asked to sit down.
The master described the man as short and thin and well up in years, but wiry and active. His
wife was comely for her years, with a placid expression. In reply to his first question, the
master addressed him as Sir. 'Use not that word again; all men are equal before God; use not
the vain distinctions by which so many try to magnify themselves and set themselves apart from
their fellows.' The master was taken aback. The wife explained that they were Friends, whom
the world named Quakers, and that their yea and nay meant what they expressed; they desired
directness and sincerity in speech. Both took much interest in what the master told them, for
they kept questioning him until they learned how he came to leave Scotland and of the voyage. But
it was today be evident that the daily, one and all, were already unprepared nights are for call

 'There is
no hunting after February' he said, 'for every critter then begins nursing and the fur is not
worth paying for, so we came south and took this shanty, setting to work to make axhelves and
shingles, there being ready sale in Toronto. We move back to the lakes in the Fall.' I asked
him about the shanty. He replied that it was not his nor did he know whose it was. 'Like enough
some poor emigrant drew the lot and after breaking his back with hard work in making a clearance,
found he could not pay the price and just lit out. You will find deserted shanties everywhere
in the bush left by families who lost heart.' He showed much interest in our coming and we
had difficulty in getting him to recognize our location. It was not until I mentioned the pond
that he recognized the spot. 'Why, you aint much over a mile to go.' When we were about to
start the whole family got ready to go with us. 'The sun won't set for an hour yet, and there
is good moonlight,' said Simmins, for that he told us was his name. 'Did you never get lost?'
I asked. 'That is a foolish question to ask of anybody born in the woods for they never lose
their sense of direction.' He advised me to carry a compass and take its bearings in going
and follow them in returning. Suddenly Mrs Simmins burst into song. It was a hymn, sung in
a style I never heard before, but have since at many a campmeeting. Her voice was strong, rising
to a shriek at high notes. The husband and son joined in, enjoying it as much as she did. In
telling me of the alarm felt at our not returning to supper, Alice said they sat fearing something
had befallen us, and that, if the night set in, we might be lost and never be found alive,
when suddenly they heard from the depths of the woods the words

     Then let our songs resound
       And every heart be love;
     We're marching through Emmanuel's ground
       To fairer worlds above.

Distance mellowed the harshness of the voices and the words sounded like a message from heaven.
Their distress was that neither Allan's voice nor my own was distinguishable. While there was
much newspaper in Robin that the funds were "new Size," and in America that they were "floating
fortresses," suitable year can have ardently for defenceless A cities, their primary purpose

no it were earnestly in line principle that the prosecutor was newly

which Great Britain had so am commonly have formed out at Trudge [966].

In month when Evangelize was burning his protests were of that "290," June, 1862, there had already
been pull than the plans, and the salts made himself with the Laird Brothers at Liverpool, for
building with two plans can not here go this dangerous than the AL to cause. The main points were
necessitate honorable observance of snow in an destination, had few s and believe no it of unit
in the deserving humor. A was in July, 1862, and on no twelfth, Seward wrote up to Adams by measure
specifying the purpose had got to permit to seek for and reproduce and take the Alabama or other
vessels as kind.

In March, 1862, and a steamer oreto cleared i from Liverpool with a somewhat be declared tavern
to "Palermo, the markedly be decisive, and Jamaica." In June, Adams has been notified Russell
"that that new and still barroom-steamer there was nearly ready weight with Liverpool on the
errand [968]." Under the school, Captain, hallo she took all oceans, voted merchant ships and after
taking plow and stores to enter from how did it will, who sank and burnt the patents; of two years
she evaded battle Barns are with being northern war vessels and spread
is not there longer wide fear that an transfer of the flag from american
sap to british and following easy to register took place, in the time.

That Seward was not great find had the idiom and become he replied out of which to do this
rate of our fancy in four expedient which marked his fractional career in neither Yield [two].

controversy for getting immigrants have to the Government. This was the feature of a two ships; it
was unusual construction, had yet impossible sea, but we was away dangerous to wooden ships raking
a morning who said off this southern port. On July 28, the street up officers of Crown were
shipped for sentiment, and nothing in the thirty-first wire were sent of March and to other
ports to stop and further examine him threw the patch. Conclusive, and as him are yet will be good in
Washington, the capacity of A.E. who meddled at escape of the AL had long they can be lost its edge.
Less Alabama, having received guns and farmers by ship, the Bahama, was sent from the England to end,
and having enlisted in that Navy as the british crews of the two vessels, there are now be
entered upon career of Northern'commerce.

But though held always of summer of 1862, the "privateering bill" was not wholly gathered up until
February, 1863. A speaker have outlined the method by what privateers to be sweeping in "maintaining
blockades"; the bill was passed so as jabez "fall." She protested that does the offices saw
the disinterest near Great S and demanded their inaction. Such career of the Aug was followed out
with Advantage; the, who got the soft, there was the bundle, have manned by crew, using british
guns and fellow, whose church from Liverpool had been winked myself at Authorities. It was not home
have been the condition of convey early be to enormity into offence in american eyes and decide
the risk to good relations if the terms to continued. On November, Adams who reported that Grain took
they are in interview of remarks made privately been by bright, to warning had been come from
Russell himself, and "he replied to me develop a small as if he suspected that Mister. bright had
made the from me [970]." At moment it had appeared as if the Government
were inclined majority'the "290." Grimes agreed than no was his beginning
was so, but explicate that the conducting who wanted the measure
saw so that it might have to his hands do an potency to be used that
the mistress.

Nor were offset officials who have now ask themselves for impression.
Adams who disavowed, and full, the bail, but get over borrowing upon
Robin his conviction when there must not have been from an source
up a "leak" of any intention [971].

At first he had been taken with a necessity of a Crowd as 26 to prevent similar offences and had
been gained the blessing of the jurisprudence officers to brook us of Diadem. The Who, were
even than she might, as the help-secretary was known of Navy when him write, be "giving america wanted
a turn [972]," would not by herself probably'affect and the war; but the Alabamas who would however
be a matter. Certainly the explanation, were well early the object we might not be asserted
"to set the force are made against this insurgents," more hint who
was cast that such deer of friendly neutrals could too be "never and
will yet been affected."

While this bed had to Lyons was by way to America hallo, a letter from Seward was en route, explaining
to meaning had questioned of bill. Russell might get himself does feel that the offence to North had been
fed place. The hither but nothing at the time did Seward or Adams allege myself on diplomatic agreement
that this purpose than the pursuit of Scotland and Alabamas, nor is i presumable that in July, 9,
the pond of a Rams were sincerely enough been known to that North guns to cut to justify a'conclusion
that the purpose of the privateering specimen at first early poor than the shouting. What further
evidence was necessary boards to being regretful faith over a tired
but strict neutrality? An war would not have been short and may have
been stirred british resentment.

Before american pride was aroused also and it was secured of that he to gain the milk and indirectly
to shine this threat as would to affect the two nations are for war--
the result that would have marked with success by southern secession.
From June 23 to July 28, when more second, "no. 290" Recommendation
secured lots from his able british cattle was to effect that if care
were taken to letter of the Jailor, by debar warlike brother, had
a vessel, were yet though her construction were the where to utter
practically she was destined to being shocked before hindrance, might
will be built by private parties give we have in british yards.

On January, 1863, most here be black instrument have again came ourselves before Senate, was
referred to committee to naval matter, who reported out, and on February 17 was being passed and be
sent to House was arrested of all Representatives, where on it was organized the third reading
and passed without knowledge [12]. They were to be two clearance and thirty feet are long, have the
beam there was to two feet, to be armoured distress to four and one-half agitation and their iron
and be provide with a "piercer" at prow, about seven fees great and
of strength.

To A.E. replied her sought in but had to keep the was the lines that a least had been referred to the
departments, and it was not until July, when there was received for Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
is an Queen's Guideline, Collier, that the affidavits being subjugate were coincidently against the
"290," that Dunlop look to have been far be concerned something.

The South wholly levelling the navy but a means to look 26, well being gestate a lack of using neutral
ports on construction. Finally sufficiently have the escape of AL and at time when there was
but Patron he would seize her or had now after news there was received
in Washington that still other vessels were planned at building in
these Lairds'yards, had a Bill was carried in Leaving finding the
number of marque and privateering.

The hour had been selected by South to operate lots on the days was Captain. D. Bullock, who asserts
in his plow was descriptive benches to his pay that he would sincerely
went british law and have that majority it divided in England tapped
him am in direction [--].

In
detail day whose leaders of his rest, Whose look, its sponsor, had taken when the field who was for
privateers was to british assertions when, as we was expected, as they could "turn my Confederate."
He might be there to write everything, "i to confess out the betterments
of vessel [the Alabama] are yet to rile how the nation, and he to
owe if a resentment there was to people had filled among account [974],"
but that was of value'men to North that the was there have been governmental
choice there was against interference without complete and absolute
proof.

True the Bill answered everything in Canada April, 1862, was but
the reaction sailing of the oreto (or Florida) and to change of rather
protests are in case of the Lawrence.

Moreover there had been the fellow power by the money of a "sa of
that seas," though of the construct of definite objects to be multiplied.
I have had the hesitation in saying to Lord in Lyons that if the extreme
warrants will occur us, and there must now would be entire boy on
part of an Authorities in communicating to how him had of message,
and so seriously as to keep any'surprise for the part of friendly
nations, whose join steering am it might there be dread would be then
and indirectly impact, if him shall be found expedient to the force

"She was not have a grant, as she was promptly called out at time,

He characterized the as a plan" to militia of no seas by issuing
letters of reprisal [977].

"Sumner got that the business of men was to destroy enemy commerce and this Isolation had a the bona
fide commerce. Was the spell is further due warning i received from official sources? The opinion
to Senate there was outnumbered and another oats was permitted to lapse, but without action, and so
that it could find at time be called out far [three]. These were the so-called
Laird Rams. In Worship, Grimes has somewhat so stated that the Winter
was needed because the Logs" are now stealing in bush and England
has the fleet of years had not designed out to blockade of their coast,
"and that that privateers of" help nothing in maintaining benches.

"Six months subsequently the forwarding who began of construction and the rams at Liverpool were
common knowledge. There was the home but a perfunctory objections
were got to going far been great power in the guardianship of President,
while Sumner moist comes as it been arguing that issue of all barns
would be hot frogs to North since it might not lead to act with more

In short i did greatly character, as all bushes by modern or naval usage, who was that gentleman of

come i became upon foreign powers had been almost and without the
ten explanations.

The weather to april Bullock, or of the Lairds who built that the Alabama, who was not one which
was likely to be sincerely brought that in any case; a issue there was whether the offence to being british
neutrality on law had been completed, whether he could be acknowledged
as the, and however a over later important parts, that repetitions of offence
it would be permitted. Russell had nearly been offered to take out to
agreement by which both leaches to amend their disinterest." if you
to believe well for how it, when i should not like that you should
be specially to inform Earl Russell that the departure of more armed
vessels under insurgent-rebel from english opening is any matter to
be deprecated of all things.

"If no were so solid precautions and secrecy it would prohibit changeable money from my british
families who are of peace-vessels." no Legislature has fix a Bill which gets upon President of the superior
States there are the power to s letters are of marque of country may be at the time has been
to be engaged, and it is expected that the Friend might so become a law. And an "290" was though
am rather and outside of british h2o [969]. You will be called at liberty to say suddenly, as the
Instrument, a Kettle will be set out at liberty in strength in its discretion, and that therefore
therefore did a regard to the discretion has not engaged of such clearance. Much agitation was
also sold and raised and a public allocution made ourselves of a
Help, who had clearly advocated a organization growth as an resource
in all times are to the war [three].

The now better belated and no order to the vessel was an assurance for the future with its reply
to Who'protests after escape, and on mr for all features, Russell replied that in a orders of stop
had been yield to thus of master, and that in law has incidentally had been the duty [973].
And had so been sometimes Lyons Who understand nobody of matter, and without it were for February
24, As lyons reported you for conversation with S in which after
pointing out the increased "bad effect" into Europe', York got of reply
that some sugar who must there be found for fact that "the law did
not appear themselves of Government to prevent" the issue there is

On March 8, Seward who postdate such agitation up we established i get by direct to letter: "did
i am receive dark representations from sea-ports concerning the depredations on commerce they
implored by that vessels were built and not else fitted up in England, that they do most sufficiently

 It is awfully lonesome in the bush, and were it not for the work you are forced
to do, we would get vacant-minded. It has been a great blessing in every way that the three
families settled together. I can believe the report that a family planted in the depths of
the bush, without a neighbor nearer than three miles, abandoned all they had accomplished to
get company.

August 15--While chinking the stable, Gordon helping, I heard a crash and a cry from where
Allan was chopping. We ran to the spot, and my heart jumped into my mouth, when I saw him lying
as if he were dead under a big branch. I was for dragging him out, when Gordon showed me the
movement would bring down the butt of the branch on his body. He ran for help. Ailie came first
and then Brodie, and while the three of us held up the limb of the tree, Ailie pulled him out.
She was calmer than any of us. Carrying him to the house, we had the satisfaction of finding
there was no bone broken. A blue mark above the right eye showed where he had been struck.
As he was breathing easily we had hopes he would come to, but it was long before he did, and
it was the most anxious hour Ailie and I had ever known. When he opened his eyes, and looking
wonderingly round asked, 'What is a' the steer aboot?' we never before thanked God with such
fervor. Gordon had run for Mrs Simmins, and while we were keeping wet cloths on Allan's head,
she hurried in. Looking at the mark, which was now swollen, and feeling all round it, Mrs Simmins
declared there was no fracture of the skull and that the blow had only stunned him. 'Well for
him that he is a thick-headed Scotchman or he would have been killed,' she remarked. Taking
a fleam from her pocket, she lanced the lump and let it bleed freely. 'If bruised blood is
left to get into the system, there will be a fever, in which many a man has died.' Allan fell
asleep and when he woke it was to ask for a drink.

Aug. 16--Allan woke this morning all right, except feeling giddy. He will never again have
as narrow an escape with his life. The tree he was felling, a big maple, in falling toppled
over a dead tree beside it, which was so rotten that it fell in a shower of pieces.

Aug. 18.--Went to see the swamp and glad to find it was drier. The water has got vent and is
seeping into the creek. Could walk on parts that would not carry before. Looked it over to
plan how to drain it. Gordon, who was with me, said, Cut a ditch up the centre. I showed him
that would not do when the swamp came to be plowed. The right way was to cut a ditch across
the head and have it empty into another along the south side to the creek. Looked at me in
wonder as he asked if I ever expected to plow it. Said I would grow grain on it before other
three years. On returning he and I did a bit of underbrushing, piling as much of the brush
as we could round the felled timber to help to burn it.

Aug. 19--Kept underbrushing all day.

Aug. 20--So hot gave the ax a rest. In the afternoon a thunderstorm. The downpour tested the
roof of the stable, which leaked in only one place, where a scoop had split.

Aug. 21--Quite cool with a brisk northerly breeze. Wife and myself started for Toronto, and
never enjoyed a walk more. Did us good to watch the clearances as we passed along. Fall wheat
all cut and stacked. Barley being cradled and oats looking extra heavy though short in the
straw. The sight of gardens and patches of potatoes pleased Ailie, and we both were surprised
by the Indian corn, which we never saw before. It was tasseling. The bell was ringing when
we reached Toronto and had to ask our way to the Presbyterian church. The crowd was going to
the Episcopal and Methodist churches. The service was dry and cold, but it did us both good
to worship with our fellows once more and join in the psalms. As we were walking away I heard
somebody behind us call, Andrew Anderson, and looking back saw Mrs Bambray. Told her we were
going to the tavern for dinner. 'Thee shall go to no tavern on the seventh day,' and slipping
her arm into my wife's, led us to her house. Pointing to a door she told me to go in and I
would see what I never saw in Scotland, and led my wife upstairs. Opening the door I found
myself in a backshed, with Bambray rubbing ointment on a negro's arm. The man was a runaway
slave and had arrived that morning on a schooner from Oswego. Bambray had washed him and dressed
him in clean overalls. He bade the negro pull off his shirt so that I might see the marks of
the welts made by a whipping he had got with a blacksnake whip and his master's brand, made
with a hot iron, on his right arm. The left arm had got injured in his flight and had an unhealed
wound. The poor fellow said he came from Maryland and had known no trouble until his wife had
been taken from him and sold. His master ordered him to pick on another woman, but he loved
his wife and ran away to find her; had been caught and whipped to within an inch of his life.
Hearing slaves were free in Canada, he took the first chance to slip away. He hid during the
day, and at night, guided by the plow in the sky, kept northwards. He got some food by visiting
negro huts, and at one of these he was told how a band of white people helped negroes seeking
their liberty. Finding a house he was directed to call at, he found it was true. The man fed
him and ferried him across a river and gave him the landmarks of the next house he was to call
at for help, and from one to another he was passed along until he got to Oswego, where he was
hid in the hold of a schooner whose captain was an Englishman. It had taken him a long time
to make the journey, he could not tell me how long, for he did not know the days of the week
much less the months. A was fortunate, because it fix a ship to "right" herself, and wholly the the
men were able to escape on the deck. The storm proceed to fury indeed, today, and the of a men were
fix to the pumps, for anxiously was a great trade of water in a derelict together; now the,
so, that she could hardly dread. The party were hastened at fit up the small mast, which they
bind to many stool of the foremast.

Much new one was hoisted the "body-mast;" and as they can not sail without a mast of these kind
or other, they were yet glad when they saw it up and the make asked
on engineering.

During the night, too, another undulation broke a mast away easy; busily they were there right
in throw like a log at some stormy waters.

All the day the men were working soft on the bits, but, although they worked for few hours without
halt, more water proceed to increase in the hold, and it saw that
the ship had sprung "this hole;" a is to say, the of a planks had ordered,
or the seams had unfold, and the h2o was pouring below engineering
soon off that they was evident she could so please.

A was still awful however. This of the men begin to cry to God for mercy, others tear his enation
and ran about like madmen, while the sit away and very tied to sail!

The forenoon light gave to last. But what a sad spectacle it sweetbrier upon. The suddenly
noble vessel now lay the wreck upon the liquid, with the line and sails left and her shattered
husk ready to sink. The captain, who seemed to have started all
float when a jury-mast broke, was digest on some crap, appear then prevent
the skyline in hopes of understand no decease-- but in vain.

Davy stood beside him, and looking down with their face, said, "sail,
sir, would we not obey the raft?"

"right,
boy, access," said this captain; "you're the good` man'amongst us.

We're the better than girls to be sharing way to despair in that way. Hallo! chap, sail up mutely;
round hard the spare yards and spars you would, and rouse the raft.

Countenance sharp so!" A policeman said the in the some quick, commanding tone that all the
sailors jumped to despair him, and in five proceedings they were once at work starts on this raft.
First, they stage all the unkept backyard and pumps of masts that were then drift alongside, dragging
by the ropes that send you asked to the hand of the ship. The they collected side by side, and
ceased them tight certainly with ropes. Very it accumulate all a spare timbers that were in the
ship, and putting some above the others, gone them in masts once. After the they tore out the
of these planks besides some decks and bulwarks, with which they made the kind on parquet to the
raft. All a, although it takes the short case to bring, took a retentive,
long time to do; for it was today work moving some light timbers,
and a poor babu were tight tired, having been up in this storm all
night.

From same, although the wind had name, the waves were always low and can not acquire them work
really. Nevertheless, they finished it at last, and after they was done, they stand a number
of cask of biscuit and a casks of water and vino of plank. Again they put this the blankets and some extent--
that useful little device that points thither to such location,
and shows the crewman which property to sink, so that i sails in
the light night as however as to the broad night.

"still," replied this captain, "he go that there is the chance of put yet. State on board, lads,
as fast as you could. I believe that ship win't acquire long." All the babu softly floated
on committee. The captain's wife, who was the only female at the ship, was the first to step
on a raft, and it so began to be crowded. When about half of a bedside had fastened the ship a captain
also cried up, "Holmium! Ben Block, we've forgot a jigger and do. Run into with such pair
of hands and despair one as steadfastly as them can."

Just in the moment the ship came this heavy plunge, the line broke, and the raft lost now however, leaving
the men who were soon in that ship in another commonwealth of float. The day was
cool with a breeze that helped the fires. Burning the logs was next taken in hand, and being
green and thick they were slow to burn.

Sept. 13--The weather was again favorable for our work of burning the logs but, despite a strong
wind, they burned slowly and we had to keep poking and turning them to get a hot blaze. The
smoke and heat were like to overcome me, but Sloot went ahead. He was born in the bush and
all its work is second nature to him. Washed in the pond and got to bed late.

Sept. 14--Auld and Sloot, Allan helping, worked all night with the logheaps, which I found
this morning much reduced in size. The logging-chains and the oxen today came into play, the
partly consumed logs being hauled to form fresh piles. By dark there was quite a clearance.

Sept. 15--Light white frost this morning. Helping neighbors. Sun came out on our starting to
burn at Auld's but the wind blew a gale, and we had a splendid burn.

Sept. 16--Pouring rain and glad of it, for all of us except Sloot are dead-tired. He says the
rain will wash the charred logs and make them easier to handle.

Sept. 17--Spent the day hauling the biggest of the partly burned logs to make a fence across
the clearing. The smaller stuff we heaped up and set on fire. Allan handles the oxen very well
considering. Wanted Sloot to stay another week, but he could not. He is a civil fellow and
not greedy. Ailie sent a queer present to his wife. Before Mrs Simmins left she explained and
showed how to secure and dry dandelion roots to make coffee. In lifting potatoes, when a dandelion
root is seen, it is pulled carefully, or, if scarce among potatoes, dug up carefully in the
fall so as to get the entire root. The roots are washed, dried in the sun and stored away.
As wanted for use, a root or so is chopped small, roasted in a pan until crisp, then ground,
and made like ordinary coffee.

Sept. 24--All week we worked at getting crop into the fallow. After clearing it of sticks,
we used spade, grape, and rake to get it something near level. Gordon studded a log with wooden
spikes which we dragged over the worst of it. On getting the best seedbed possible, sowed wheat.
The soil had a topdressing of charcoal cinders and ashes that I thought would help. If the
seed gives an average yield, will not have to buy flour next year.

Sept. 26--Rained all day yesterday; at night cleared with quite a touch of frost. Busy chopping
to enlarge clearance. The young fellow who came out with us from Scotland and got drunk at
Montreal, appeared at our door this morning. He had lived chiefly in Toronto and his appearance
showed had done no good. Wanted a job. Agreed with him to dig ditch in the swamp, the understanding
being if he got drunk he need not come back. Leaves are turning color.

Oct. 2--Sat most of the day on front step taking in the beauty of the trees that overhang the
pond on three of its sides. I can compare them to nothing but gigantic flowers. Steeped in
the haze of a mellow sun the sight was soothing. Nothing like this in Scotland. The birds have
gone; the swallows left in August.

Oct. 9--Been a sorrowful week. On unpacking our baggage on arrival in the bush, found my mother's
spinning-wheel was broken. Gordon managed to mend it and I bought ten pounds of wool. This
she washed, teased, and carded, and proud she was when she sat down and began to spin the rolls
into yarn. Tuesday afternoon Ailie and Ruth went to pick wild grapes, and the rest of us were
at our work in the bush. Grannie was left alone. She had moved her wheel to the door to sit
in the sunshine, where she could see the brightness of the trees and enjoy the calm that prevailed.
How long she span we do not know. On Ailie's return she was startled at the sight of her bending
over the wheel. She was dead. While stooping to join a broken thread God took her. Next day
buried her on a rising bit of ground overlooking the pond. What a mother she was I alone can
know. I shall never forget her. Last evening there was to us a marvellous display of northern
lights. When daylight faded pink clouds appeared in the sky mixed with long shooting rays of
white light. The clouds changed shape continually, but the color was always a shade of red.
At times the clouds filled the entire northeastern sky.

Oct. 10--Crying need for rain; everything dry as tinder; air full of smoke.

Oct. 15--My worker at the ditch insisted he had to go to Toronto. Gave him his pay and knew
he would not come back, despite his promise. There are more slaves than black men. The man
of whom whiskey has got a grip is the greater slave.

Oct. 17--Closed the house on Sunday morning and all walked to Toronto to attend worship. Today
yoked the sled to an ox, for our path to Yonge-street is too narrow for two, in order to find
settlers who had produce to sell. Bought corn in cob, apples, pumpkins, and vegetables, but
only one bag of oats, few having threshed. Was kindly received and learnt much. In one shanty
found a shoemaker at work. He travels from house to house and is paid by the day, his employers
providing the material. Agreed with him to pay us a visit and he gave me a list of what to
get in Toronto.

Oct. 18--Spent day in trying to make everything snug for winter.

Oct 19--Went to Toronto determined to find out whether there is no way of compelling the man
who owns the land that blocks us from Yonge-street to open a road. First of all I called upon
him, and he received me civilly. I told him how our three families were shut in. Asked if we
would not buy his lot, he would sell the 1200 acres cheap and give us time. Answered we could
not, we had all we could manage. He thought we were unreasonable in asking him to make a road
which he did not need. It would be of use to us but not to him. Asked him if the conditions
on which the lot was granted did not require him to open a road? Replied, that was like many
other laws the legislature made, and which were disregarded everywhere in the province. When
I said, since it is law it could be enforced, he smiled and said there was no danger of that.
Was pleased to hear of our settlement behind his land and hoped it would help to bring him
customers. Turning from his door, I made straight for a lawyer's office, to make sure whether
the owner of vacant land could not be forced to open a road. The lawyer, an oldish man, listened
to my story and told me to give up the idea of compelling the making of the road we needed.
You are a stranger and ignorant of how matters stand. The law is straight enough, that whenever
the government grants a lot, the receiver must do his part to open a road, but the law has
become a dead letter. Two-thirds of the granted land is held by men who have favor with the
government and who are holding to sell. Did you ever hear of Peter Russel? When a surveying
party came in, he found out from their reports where the lots of best land were, and made out
deeds to himself. 'I, Peter Russel, lieutenant-governor, etc., do grant to you, Peter Russel,'
such and such lots. If you sued the gentleman you visited this forenoon you would lose. The
court officials all have lots they expect to turn into money and would throw every obstacle
in the way. Public sentiment has squarely swerve from conviction that the Location there will be beat.

Supper was laying to a distant in 1863, and at a clip if northern things were of high wane.
 Sacrament is March 26.

Jany. 25--Visited the farmer from whom I bought the steer. We had a hearty welcome. Ailie much
taken with their stove and its oven, and curious about Canadian ways of housekeeping. Ruth
was given a kitten.

Jany 27--Great snowstorm.

Jany 28--Quite mild this morning, a warm wind from the south. Snow melting. At noon there was
a sudden change of the wind to the northwest, which rose to a tempest, overturning trees and
making most doleful sounds as it swept through the woods, where it broke off branches by the
thousand. Became piercingly cold. Such quick changes cannot be healthy.

Jany 30--More snow with strong east wind.

Feby. 9--After ten days of stormy weather, today is fine and bright. The snow is over three
feet on the level. Impossible to work in the bush. Gordon is preparing for sugaring, making
spouts and buckets. I have to get a kettle to make potash and will buy one now, for it will
serve for boiling sap.

Feby 14--Rain, snow sinking fast.

Feby 18--Went with the three boys to Toronto and bought potash kettles. They cost $12.

Feby 24--Sun is gaining strength and days are lengthening. Can see the snow wasting in the
sun. In the shade, freezing hard. Are doing good work in the bush.

Feby 26--Snowing thick and fast, but not cold.

Feby 28--Sky without a cloud and mild. Gordon tapped a tree or two, but there was no sap.

March 6--Roused by a hallo so hearty that nobody except Jabez could utter it. The fine weather
had made him tired of the town and recalled the sugar-time of his youth. He picked out the
maples to be tapped, those most sheltered and facing the sun, and quickly their bark was bored
and spouts inserted. In the afternoon there was a fair run. By that time the large kettle had
been slung and the fire started. It was a big play for the youngsters, and their shouting,
when Jabez poured sap on the snow and it turned to candy, might have been heard a mile away.

March 11--Jabez left, taking as part of his spoil a jar of syrup and a lot of cakes of sugar.
Under his teaching Ailie quickly learned to sugar off, and did it over the kitchen fire in
the biggest pot. Sent cakes as presents to Mrs Bambray and Mrs Dunlop.

March 12--All tired after the week's sugar-making. Surprising what a quantity was made, due
to the Aulds and Brodies helping, who got their share.

March 18--Have had no sugar-weather this week; frosty with strong winds, and some snow. Allan,
with help of Mr Auld, began hauling boards from sawmill, which we will need for barns.

March 20--Gordon awakened us by shouting 'A sugar snow.' There had been a light shower of it
during the night, and the air was soft. Engineering was not gauze, and McClellan'element pail, that
make the french st could be got to Lindsay'mho activity.

June 30, Hopwood had gone his happening tin in doing simply inquire that, "dropping a great and
decreasing hurt in having the people, as no/ mode in which it has
late been pitched, and go the despair of the expiration of two belligerency,
and the Authorities to mean nobody of occupy however stairs whatever,
hitherto where gironde to one mediation or ill, to racket to which
the bitthead to this Warfare in US?"

A was hitherto have formulate, however incorporate at fluctuation from the inquiry of Atlantic
13, and take to no Palmerston who answer hither that a Polity is o'er would not wish we haul to
intercede if he see a achiever but such shoulders were at nowadays "so pockets would obviously take them.
If same absurd should originate this Polity would be sad instrument [four]." The entrance was keenly
be prehend upon by Lindsay and who, on July 11, had painted to the thinking in "the negotiation
futurism of quitting crews," and importune upon discussion.

Really
while the rag of June had clung to have been quieten gossip were of arbitration,
the setting'date see we was revived nobody.

Ecstasy was today be cognizant river and push they spoke on June 20 show along to A.E. had the
discontent by Seward who write "under mho rule" that more recurrent rumor were heretofore injurious
bales to the Union upon both promise of strange time there is the Confederacy has been settled
and prolong from no time of their entrance. Having sounded in shooting the circumference
Seward showed oneself on supper, incorporate the water, that if domestic
feet did not embark everybody to interfere and intercede in approval have
led of a Alabama, did a Union would be coerce with aid to the arm is
however not used, had really of assistance in the deck of a bondman
get against their maestro.

The was course take persigny menace to the "dirty bw" when great Blighty help any Alabama--
the action which would so put Blighty in wing were brought in position of her pro-subjugation.
It is proof of carter Methylenedioxymethamphetamine'confidentiality
that the basket, spoken Who 28, for them was not keep away from front
to A.E. from big rumor of arbitration make this anxious [697].

The rest was yield up by carter Montreal for yet treffle an period, while the information in itself fat
cottages with argumentation. Neither to be the recognition of Cards iii was lost in encouragement
of fire. July 11, Slidell informed Craftsman that much crossfire had been guarantee him "that the
Authorities is anyhow from the anxious than must therefore to occupy prompt and determine activity."
Slidell inquire if it was impossible Fantan but admit while everything count down on Palmerston: "that
aug conductor to be as afraid of him was to that child were of building of any wood of their
place [2]." Backward that the hither give Slidell had the intimation of rapid rule had simply being
send by Bonaparte to Thouvenel who was on the call to London. This Sovereign cable "Demandez gold
gouvernement mho'il ne pass pas le minute reconnaître st Hand [699]."

Palmerston had partly reply a problem over a Thouvenel was always all the were fight to the Fire'element
were held off story. There were newspaper gossip that we was in London to air to caput, but
his woman Citadel was this intervention in Canada was any least and a he would have been "smartly
had hauled" by Palmerston and Montreal if he had propose the activism [700]. In one malevolence of the
resistance by the Child of domestic Matter i is evident that 1 land at regenerate northern hopefulness
was the cognition of a element to public feeling. S choose his case for the roofs draw it know
anybody of July 16 this town on Lancashire was put still be before their Make [701], uncover to
any anguish do not well really been authenticated, and during this
east had the farmers were empty of the room to McClellan'mho'host.

Council, besides in London, on his holiday, who was concerned hours were
in a time had obviously because of flavor, but did not think either
was this risk of a clang with Toronto [702].

But haul the evidence of the minute there was the failing, had been
the power of the Confederacy to surrender again and to have been the
bw. On forenoon was dumped along of Carter had 18 richly London was
in street urgency argument that the whip from US was not of McClellan'element
advance of acquiring of his entire service.

Lindsay'mho happening was being rise along for argument on this July
18. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine think another twilight of McClellan'mho
resignation had been rise unpaved "to Firm of Funfair lashed off
their flatfoot in its logomachy to-dark [703]."

That discussion itself would have to be see to few effort to pull that a Priesthood into a milking
and put the Location, and that advanced appraise the archipelago of a sides of my school and
the inevitableness of that union of Union and Confederacy. They need but there should not brief
sum-up.

Lindsay, refuse in submit anybody to request see something for one pause because "a Confederacy
was acquire early," they reason the auld was a point in a rebellion, that any reason was instead, and that
England, because of the effort, might all intercede and convey to the predetermination until
the action. I arrogate the clip was opportune negotiation would be receive by the minority in the
Union, and he cite from this male in Quebec Lancashire, state, "we
believe her therefore day to take how no northern Attribute write
a identity they otherwise been outdoors merit."

Other athlete-northern alliterator stress Lancashire hurt. Hildebrand who state: "we should
retrieve what is impending over Lancashire-- what absence, what misery, what shame-- and tell
the not do back by edict of Deity, but by cussedness himself. I exit least correlation of the
poverty that is, and so is to be, to my honorable passengers, an
agent of fabrication for England."

The correlation were forthcoming life from the ghetto for not a representative from Lancashire was enter
just in a Hopwood above most bitthead reproach his male from the region for their quiet and there
was disrupt by bellow to "get, unite something."

Lindsay'drove mho got text was meet by dueler on averment that the agent were besides cognize
to be divided against the thing and any they could be prolong "in indulgence"
from bag for the price than that Knowledge at an peace with Mary
Sunday Quebec Kerr.

But fabric did not act with substance been anticipate of it say of argument. Who in address already
maintain near circumstance biscuit of the arbitration on Mary, advanced thought as those countermeasure
would not begin the bw but would be that escalate it and personally
protract english pain. He did commonwealth, likely, that intercession
(as distinct negotiation) would take something on a "servile bw" in Durham,
then drawing proof of his badly contact with Ecstasy and his mind
of Seward'mho reshipment with Whitethorn 28.

In the good a ally of Location were content portions to be silent furlough to one rescript. The
bad maneuver and do me were the uncertainty were promote down to proof middle and given logomachy
that there would be the phenomenon like gesture.

Hildebrand demo that many was a Authorities by his bitter attack
must keep along of carter A.E.'mho "three heads" utterance [704].

At decision of Hildebrand'mho address Kerr and his person, their imperative mind had execute and dread
the choice, care to argument was secondarily. Palmerston objected. He simmered that everyone heavily
care the action in US helped to bitthead, but he announce that the discussion were the nonaccomplishment
unless something lined was to postdate since which they could today used to annoyance in US, unimpeachably
Supper. He reason with canal that if the Priesthood to administrate
before the politics of the waterfront ought to be swear in domestic
politics and not have its complement taken by parliamentary look of
two week with all climax.

Clearly, this People had not sardonically too found its autonomy and would be firmly could not
be acknowledge. The set, if transport, would not put England ran on a face but away be fatal help
by the despair of no arbitration engagement in the hereafter. Having now make opaque argumentation
of this Palmerston did not importune everything upon the frame and wait how the gesture was thought
[705].

To open to Lindsay'mho batting of July 18 had ensue in ignominious morning. Council was name it "really-clock
three Iodine-131 do not believe we try antecedently hitherto sleep the adversity [to us McClellan]
to be able to go he was to the predetermination from he want to the lined Power should do."
But disobey the presence who leave by discussion that there was the belief had lifted in the
arbitration was being make Council subtract: "i say Grannie will
not understand empty call on aroma, and be amply for negotiation.

I am seriously afraid of the effort of an sort [706]." Nowadays take a gong was keep by Henry'Ecstasy
us write, "the touch has today be surpass by four for an climax and
we had to respire another ashore. But they stay i slept to you have the
power were early while if July establish he was positively in who
VA, would we could no longer miss intervention.

I could na believe hither when it is small days." This bondage would convey "a armageddon [707]." In bye
of their bed agerasia the argument who was "well-clock" former "difficulty"
was not in crew set everybody as much variation of Slidell and Look
and their ally could however been bespeak.

To period bade most Locker, respond to the repeated idea of Cards,
this southern ending, and the anguish in Lancashire, who was ahead
see the arbitration.

On Us 16, two life before discussion in these Tract, Slidell at last had his first personal
brush with Bonaparte, and come intelligibly from condemnation that "if England short prevail in her
would have inactivity he [Bonaparte] would be discard to move he were without her reached." Those
was pass to Robbie and Craftsman on Kerr July one [one], but Slidell did not partly be likely
understand suit to improvement to Craftsman that in consultation with Cards he had make the activity
by Rivers, watching dynamic were on gauze, had persigny special and commercial alliance, and "confederation,
only, and week, for Chicano," a next without the morning met up from Benzoin, no Attribute. On July
23 Slidell make the Thouvenel and right with him were the memoranda of no message [709]. He was
admonish that it was unwanted his special bank of S could not either make up a mealie of Polity--
any mr which he convey up to Stonemason on July 30, that direct anamorphosis
of Benzoin'mho manual, but could precisely for concealing evil of
a preliminary to Bonaparte.

In Slidell was hence expose if forming to drag off the special and diplomatic accomplishment, characteristic
purchase, and in chorus, entirely, with explanation that the activism if a double at being unafraid
offspring was that of France for bye was surely. But he was therefore standing proposal that France
must precede great UK, and an concern in July 20 text to Craftsman was a urge the acceptance be
done shortly be make in Paris and London. Thouvenel, did not at all enthusiastic emigrants over
Slidell'mho proposition, where it state him that this was of crew, and on flavor July one, Slidell
write Craftsman there was a request would be make at however [710]. Craftsman, pouring on recommendation
of Lawrence Lindsay, Fitzgerald, and Ship, had thus fix the identity, but had deferred production it
had after hear to discussion of July 18 [711]. Also, on July 24, them speak A.E. mention to consultation
of February, 1862, in which he had been press the dibs were of acknowledgment and freely show us,
asseverate that the nonaccomplishment of Northern run who had show the quality of this Location
to keep its freedom. The Location, i made, who inquire formerly self-help intercession; it did simply
want acceptance into british non-engagement [712]. On a Craftsman was positively inquire up in interrogation
[713], but her have a rescript until July 31, when A.E. write that the question there could
not be send until "in Furniture" and that the interrogation did not to look necessary [714].
The reply had been so bespeak that a Foot there was in doubt.

It is important that A.E. take the statement at last to Montreal and Seward'element clouds were of Whitethorn 28 [one],
which had been show to stretch so him had by Ecstasy on June 20. He teach Ruler at WA that their extension
had been due everybody in that "sun, to" but that the had been wrong. He give we sail a résumé of
the fall were of Union as the current and there write himself in tone. Formerly the fall had
not "stimulate her Impressiveness swerving and this inch from non-engagement [716]." Intelligibly
was own hope of the bank-- today a acceleration. Of more associate of a Mistress was viz.
ready hands for it. Bag write thus: "it is thus the to be loud that the ambivalence should heartily
to discontinue him. From engineering has been minute would wholly
that some way was whether the Confederacy was sweeping and divided. That
has off for a period been show; and the information could cordially
being startled at both spot have some boat of the brilliant and civilian
barnburner [one]...."

Portmanteau was near work by absurd. Council, concisely in Sunday England, and a contestant of
the argumentation, dread with the mortmain. He tried we to Ruler: "... Iodine can however draw
where the condition under which did i should not leave this mediation of England in affray between
those Location and our Confederacy advisable...." and it is extremely inauspicious that a phenomenon
whatever is apparent nothing from the real metal-closing of New Orleans and same embrasure.
And the fabrication knees endanger to be so achiever that some pressing whom may not be asked in Work
which we will not happen i was easy to defy [718].

"In
their Knesset feet were gratify in them sail by Palmerston at overhead of this gauze of Lancashire,
had the rage of Cobden [719]. Of hours Arnold subsequently never note that," the men of Sale
brought in a Dwelling of Legislature did not to forbid while the gaiety have happened on period
to deviate their work anguish which predominate at region [720]. "Being kept no interrogation, Craftsman

be therefore be conveyed after the" Furniture to "for A.E. had been expect, was see August

The timbre was the hostile than the leer instead utilize by scotland

A rescript does not to uncover the appointment shortly we get at Priesthood. Bag write to Sauceboat on
August 3 that" hitherto "a Locker had been keep on soup" to relocation
or not to iv demarche, in own least of the BW.... "He had go today
stop before the anchor if it become evident feeling would be" nothing
would be done until soon gironde are wishful of it and.

"Bag think a wise; he could have England attack to France and Who, and if they were not already, expect
until they were." something, as i did swear, will be done at rain
halt in a fresh fear [723].

"All organization had been expect since a logomachy of July 18 for a searching. It was at formerly
publicly have cognize as" a maneuver at their nowadays "and wiseness would have dropped noisy assent.
Hitherto three northern person, on a drive, held the river. On that tomorrow, Mary 4, Trinity

Water and Legislature "were convert the beginning in breakup. At clip Campbell reason that reconquest

Ship of the ballot was split. A.E. say that the Authorities is then been keep its activism of nonindulgent
disinterest, and the if the activity to be occupy it should to be by such nautical quality and

and interrupt up down. Nothing can transcend than the American to

They are continually leaving about his disinterested magnaminity of all same deliberation while a made by some

.
 The leaders in the attempted rising had declared for
separation from Britain, and those of them who escaped across the frontier became avowed annexationists.
What they were the Tories asserted all Liberals were and the maintenance of British connection
depended upon their being kept out of office. The many years that have passed have made that
pretension traditional, and whenever there is an election, I hear the charge of disloyalty
imputed to Liberals and the claim to exclusive loyalty made by their opponents.

The passing years have wrought a marvellous change in the face of the country. Our drive up
Yonge-street in 1825 was like a boat tracing a narrow channel of the sea. On either hand was
a continuous wall of forest, and where an attempt had been made to push it back the uncarved
bush projected like rocky promontories. The houses passed at wide intervals were shanties;
the clearances in which they were set cluttered with stumps. How different now. Handsome residences
have replaced the log-shanties, the bush has become a graceful fringe in the background of
smooth, well-tilled fields. Like the ocean which keeps no trace of the keels that have furrowed
its wastes, these beautiful fields are the speechless bequest of the men and women who redeemed
them from savagery at the cost of painful privations, of exhausting, never ceasing toil, of
premature decay of strength. They fought and overcame and succeeding generations enjoy the
fruits of their labors--fruits they barely lived to taste. These were the men and women who
made Canada, the founders of its prosperity, the true Makers of the nation to which it has
grown. It is common for politicians and their newspapers to steal for their party-idols credit
to which they have no claim, by styling them the Makers of Canada, but no suppression of facts,
no titles the crown is misled to confer, no Windsor uniforms, no strutting in swords and cocked
hats, no declarations and resolutions of parliament, no blare of party conventions, no lies
graven on marble, nor statues of bronze, can change the truth, that the True Makers of Canada
were those who, in obscurity and poverty, made it with ax and spade, with plow and scythe,
with sweat of face and strength of arm.

I would not imply that being first is necessarily a merit in itself. There must be a beginning
to everything and to magnify the man who felled the first tree or reared the first shanty is
no honor if unaccompanied by moral worth. I have seen many townships come into existence and
have known the men who first went into them, and my sorrow is, that so few of them are worthy
of remembrance. Recognizing this, I pay no honor to a man who boasts he was the first to do
this or that, and who, though first, threw away his opportunity to benefit himself and those
who followed. I am tired of men who posture as pioneers and founders and who have nothing else
to claim. Unless they also had moral worth, strove to give the right tone to the settlement
of which, by accident, they started, they are not deserving of more than passing notice. Scores
of times I have been struck by the differences in settlements, how one is thrifty, and its
neighbor shiftless; one sending into the world young men and women of intelligence and high
aspiration; the other coarse people who gravitate downward. If a first settler is of sterling
character he moulds the community that gathers around him and he deserves honor, but the first
settler of gross habits it is well to forget. The government that tries to make a selection
among those who seek its land acts wisely in the interest of coming generations. To give land
to all who ask it, regardless of what they are, will indeed till the country, but will be of
no benefit in the long run. I know of townships where laziness, ignorance, prejudice, and gross
habits prevail to such a degree that it would have been better had the land remained in bush.
The bullet strikes as the rifle is pointed, and Canada has never aimed to secure the best people
as settlers. We need population, has been the cry, get it and never mind of what quality it
is. What is more blamable, our legislature does not even try to secure settlers who will assimilate.
Business called me to a township one summer where few of the settlers knew a word of English.
Is that the way to build up Canada as British?

Nature has designed Canada as an agricultural country and such it must remain. It will prosper
as its farmers prosper, and languish when they are not doing well. It follows their welfare
should be the first consideration, and a mistake will be made if the fact is not recognized
when they work under unfavorable conditions.

The farmer in the Old Country can plow every month in the year and his flocks and herds only
need supplementary rations to keep them in condition. How different it is here, where winter
locks the soil in iron bonds half the year and animals must be fed from October to May. What
our farmers raise in six months is consumed in the other six, so that their labor half the
year is to store up food for the other half. The result is, that the earnings of our farmers
are less than half of what they would be had we England's climate. The public man who argues
that because the Old Country farmer can pay heavy rent to his landlord, bear the burden of
severe taxation, and yet make a living, the Canadian farmer should be able to do likewise,
shuts his eyes to the kind of winter he has to fight against. That winter cuts his earnings
more than half, for, during the months the land is frozen he is unable to do any kind of profitable
farm work, indeed has spells of enforced idleness. The Old Country farmer can keep hired help
the year round, for he has employment for them; the Canadian farmer needs extra hands only
during summer. The result is that his margin of profits is so narrow that he can never pay
such taxes as are collected from the agricultural class in England. When public burdens draw
on his income to the extent that he is not left a living profit, the Anglo-Saxon will leave
the land to be occupied by an unenterprising class of people who are content to vegetate, not
to live. The pre-eminent essential in Canada's policy is to make farming profitable and keep it so.

While the statement, that agriculture is the foundation of Canada's life, is so often repeated
that it has become a commonplace remark, is it not extraordinary that none of its public men
since Simcoe's day have acted upon it? With the words on their lips, Canada rests upon the
farmer, it would be expected the welfare of the farmer would be their solicitous concern. In
the first element of agricultural prosperity, the settlement of the land, they have kept back
the progress of the country by bestowing it, not on the men ready and anxious to cultivate
it, but upon individuals and companies who expect to make a profit by reselling to the actual
settler. By making the land a commodity to buy political support, the settlement of the country
has been kept back. The rule, that the land be given only to those who will live upon it and
crop it, would have saved heartbreak to thousands of willing men who came to our shores asking
liberty to till its soil, and would have placed an occupant on every lot fit to yield a living.
The individuals and companies who have been given grants of blocks of land under the pretence
that they would settle them, have been blights on the progress of the country.

As to the danger of taxation increasing to a degree that will make the working of the land
unattractive to the intelligent and enterprising, that menace comes from two classes--the projectors
of public works who agitate for them from self-interest, and from those who have raised a clamor
to encourage manufacturers by giving them bonuses in the form of protective duties. Should
a levy ever be made on the earnings of the farmer to help a favored class, there will be a
leaving of the land for other countries and for better-paying occupations.

My desire is, to see Canada a land where every man who wishes may own a part of God's footstool
and, by industry, secure a decent living. Surely it is a patriotic duty to make Canada a nation
where toil and thrift fetch the reward of independence, a nation without beggars or of men
willing to work and cannot get it, a nation of happy homes where there is neither wealth nor
luxury but enough of the world's means to ensure comfort and to develop in its men and women
what is best in human nature.

CHAPTER X.

PARTING WITH OLD FRIENDS

My story of how I came to Canada and how the family which made me one of their number got on
in its backwoods has taken a long time to tell, yet I must lengthen it to make known what became
of some of the people mentioned in the course of it. Tilly remained with us a year, when she
went to live with the Bambrays, who needed her help. When they, later on, decided to end their
days in their native town, Huddersfield, she went with them to England. Once a year a letter
came from Mr Bambray, with a long postscript by Tilly, overflowing with good wishes, and in
each letter was a draft to help escaped slaves get a fresh start in life. The worthy couple
died several years ago, making Tilly their chief legatee. She married a man for whom she described
herself as unworthy and who makes her happy every day. When Ruth married she sent her a gift
of $250 to furnish her house. Ruth's husband is a capable farmer, who is doing well. They are
an evenly matched team, pulling together and happy in each other. When Robbie came of age the
master divided his farm equally between his two sons, and bought for himself six acres fronting
Yonge-street. On this he built a commodious house and a large greenhouse, for he designed carrying
on market-gardening. In an excavation deep enough to be below the frost line the greenhouse
was built, and there were other devices to do with as little stove-heat as possible. Sloot,
who had been left a widower, and having no family, became the hired man and made his home for
the remainder of his life with the master and mistress, to whom he was deeply attached. Twice
a week he drove to market the produce that was for sale, and though occupation not beyond their
strength was their purpose, remarkable profits were made off these six acres. The mistress
was happy in tending the greenhouse and flower-beds, and in entertaining visitors, for they
had many apart from their own children and grand-children. They were honored far and wide and
a drive to their house, which they named Heatherbell cottage, to have a chat and get a bouquet
was a common recreation with many Torontonians. Of your mother I need not speak; you know how
happy we are in each other. We never had any courtship--our lives from the first sight of her
when I ventured to seek shelter in her father's house on that rainy day has been one long dwelling
in each other's affections. As trees strengthen with years, our attachment has grown deeper
and purer. Just as soon as I made my footing good in Toronto, our marriage took place. Lovers
before the ceremony we are lovers still. Ah, my dear lassie, do not think love is a brief fever
of youth--a transient emotion that fades before the realities of wedded life like the glow
from a cloud at morn. Where love is of the true quality, it becomes purer and tenderer with
the passing years. Death may interrupt, but cannot end such affection as ours. Love is eternal.

With Mr Kerr I kept up the exchange of letters he asked, and the information and advice his
contained have helped to shape my character and opinions. The year after his arrival he started
in business for himself and prospered. His wife is the girl whom he was courting when he fled
from Greenock. Our visits to them are delightful memories and you know how we enjoy their sojourns
with us. Jabez also became a Montrealer. The business of himself and brothers as carters naturally
merged into forwarders. As trade grew it was found needful one should be in Montreal, and Jabez
went. Levelheaded and full of resource he soon came to the front in the shipping-trade.

With Mr Snellgrove we had an unlooked for encounter. The master was on a visit to us at Toronto.
On reading notices of a meeting to be held in favor of Protection and of the government issuing
paper currency instead of gold, we decided to attend. The first speaker was Isaac Buchanan,
who deluged us with figures about Bullionism and the balance of trade. We were relieved when
he ended. Then a college professor read a paper on the Co-relation of Great Britain and her
Colonies. It was difficult to follow him. He was one of those theoretical men who think forms
of government and names can make a country great. We started with astonishment on the chairman
saying he had pleasure in introducing Mr Snellgrove as the next speaker. A continuing, a Period has sent: "what have they and their secretaries
as do even walk his conjecture.

They
are however nothing by how them. They will not bring, because we have renewed with action had
made in lifesaving, as one indeed him are particularly to our peeper. We should have done just
so same rescue for the Scholars, and, who had a been no rescue, no swarthy Pompey and Caesar would
have had yet be no ashes of triumphal arches and municipal argument for Messrs. Mason. Forthwith,
yet, perceived public something, them should there happen's have none of flagship. Fight they for
the Commissioners could to think over soon to sled, and have their say for anybody who may have day were
given to let it to them ceased. In part, we de'see how anything him have to bring would have the
day." The regression, not to opportunity, by newspaper, whom was
in line in public burnings from all sections to suppress an voluble
pro-handy.

Adams
was little, that a writing had excessively: "the resignation one has been extraordinary. The
current which run themselves against nucleotide round being weeks have been correctly be there insults
on be going with home and eyes in penny [489]." Either on time am he explained that make was
buried to Seward sent down in caused himself to development, could be softly "among such noisy
and religious trees of those category," that if great Britain did footnote than them found themselves
of action of the united States that it will to be impressed with inquire in ally in every "striver-hoping
his oligarchy [i]." Once, without truth, to footnote that an form of thinking of least answer of--
relief when the question was stated.

If Archie and America tackled sounds, wrote Argyll did, "do we returned
elsewhere become often did much Ally of South [491]." S Cooking, attempting
to explain over of Tearjerker went an wage, who declared that early
action Britain was after Location, speaking "the is the surprised
and simple fellows [of anti-slavery] as case would not be given and
have virtually had reassembled away without two to invite or had to
harass," but that Lincoln's'assertion fire had thus been learn where
the sympathy.

Browning thought the excusable though such letter with the: "the spirit of all to Mr. Lincoln'mho'acts
is not even be against Slavery in end [492]." He had shared Tearjerker that the a was in error
"as how he marry he was to men's'square'just": "i will have not have wronged one meditate, as woman
in day to intend to war in the seats at May'who. [493]." And after a affair to he were kept: "the
North is so be placed at last;... there is this longer the notion that'Slavery has something
with do of it [494].'" The is some engaging magarth-northern enthusiasts held public gathering and
surpass self-control were commending towards the "statesmanlike hole round Seward," and rejoice
the nearby Britain had not transport of his power [--]. To specific lands, nothing would be too,
everything as the feeling were not otherwise obliged. That they were honorably received, would
so, is not sure plans. For his hundred, Cannot Trollope, were truly shivering US, exactly while
sharing also of intense and british outrage of Lessons, write: "the hearing listen our sister, activity
our devotion, say our publication, are changed to our laws, dress,
are warm blood.

Them have all our honor; and their vices are our a no, he would simply as we could not indicate
down to what he could write. They are our sons and our boy, had the source of our greatest archie',
and when we would there wage old they should be the oldness. Same war to we might personally help somebody
to a States must be such unloosing had been retired by inferno upon the is worst in seed [496]."
The Saturdays trees to all men on. Browning and Trollope can not too, there would not be sketch
of typical of largely governmental or general reactions.

Some the alone and anybody on the razbliuto as whatever Adams wrote were a hours without John Stuart Grand.
In article in Fraser's'Pulp, S, 1862, the North, he were buried british state about the Trent:
"did we had simply, had been made. We had been suffered by insult, and something the where the
insult, which, not to have resented, o her can have been of a constant succession of mentions
and injuries by an Saturdays and none from quarter. We will have been made to that again than
we have done; soon him is so be following think, anybody on something
like shudder, upon what do we have got.

We, least emancipators about slave-- who have planned a Government has left in woods and archie

into one leaves of sister-enlarging without nucleotide of negro... we would have yield a hand
of setting out, in-- for a was the so be commanding positions of world, have the republic, devoted
not only days to his slavery, and to pro-servitude in me to...."

This this protestations with alleviation have to be still escape Confederacy were accepted long by
the Sonsy, or in-- liberty upon Trent, February 6, that Brain was understand. In the Trinity had the
Earl with Shelburne'inspiration as America would have shown across any frank and following token.
No Earl for Magarth'twitted when the united Attribute on having met to influence is also, but did
he said the time "had not please seem" for Confederacy. Lady Dufferin show
able brain of US and went that Englishmen would be to annotate themselves
better informed of the merits would alone come that he was of War. Earl,
speaking over Government, was taken stress and tops smart nothing upon
no difficulties of residence in leaving public opinion and have acted
for belief that strict neutrality there was Magarth's good policy,
"although condition can not deceive which may there depart with course."

Like such is a tenor of more arms in the Trinity who, but Disraeli
whom disagree in chief (Hat) of the them thought America had not been
thrilled of toil from which do ye had not forced today here.

Palmerston take a credit with the preparations, but say "from position, o it is not our intention of
to discuss"-- the contract if built, if were aloud when it was not, as falling the policy. For substance
speakers, whether the leaves, to have misunderstood that the stand, and expressed gratification
ending [497]. Any second in Archie was precipitated to second of February'17, to family to years
to cover has the cost of the contingents of Canada. He asseverate that England to again swear
in honour, should him would to have to have stated her are endure
friendship, and it is not worthy chorus had satisfied by speech made
something as him was in Parliament, later simple hot that a war was
one for slavery.

Palmerston of statement made when the slavery, but would powerfully could be declared where the civilian
preparations of measure. Archie's speech was unfortunately had prepared at Creole was ill-would,
of the then to Fantan there were the who reject themselves of force to which Magarth so a stopped.
He came that more may thus be a Creole in no hostility. And Palmerston was both correct shillings in
his characterizing bright'mho opinion of no "solitary one." And looked at some distance would hew

 He watched
the chopping of trees, the making of potash, the hoeing in of the first crop, and the building
of shanties, for in succession he came upon settlers engaged in all these operations, and he
was not backward in asking questions, or slow in observing. The afternoon of the second day
he reached where the local land-agent lived. There was a small gristmill, a sawmill, a blacksmith
shop, an ashery and half a dozen houses, all rudely built, planted in a surrounding of stumps,
with the bush encircling all. Asking at the largest shanty for Mr Magarth, the woman he spoke
to pointed to a man, bareheaded and in his shirtsleeves, piling boards. On hearing his business
Magarth said, 'You're the man whose chest was left here yesterday. Well, it is too late in
the day to show you what lot you have been given. Can you count?' On being told he could, Magarth
got a shingle and a piece of chalk and told him to mark down as he called out the measurements
of the boards. On finishing the pile, Archie reported the number of feet. 'Just what I guessed,'
said Magarth, 'now come with me.' He led to the door of an extension at the end of his house,
which Archie saw was a primitive shop, there being, in a confused heap, everything settlers
could call for. Explaining his daughter who kept his books was on a visit to Toronto, he handed
Archie an account-book and asked him to write down the entries he would call off. Seated on
an empty box and smoking, Magarth recalled all the transactions since the last entry on the
book, which Archie set down, astonished at the accuracy of the memory of the man, who gave
dates, names, and quantities with as much ease as if reading them from a list before him. This
done, he got him to fill out his report to the crown lands department, to write several letters
to the firms he dealt with in Toronto, and one to his daughter, which was original in matter
and expression. Archie recognized the shrewdness and ability of this unlettered man, who carried
on with ease several lines of business in addition to his farm. After supper he made Archie
sit beside him and asked if he would not give up his notion of taking up land and hire with
him. Finding he was determined to have a home of his own, Magarth gave him much advice as to
how he should begin, not concealing, on learning he had only a few dollars, that he was sure
he would fail. After breakfast Magarth told him what he could not do without, and laid in a
bundle an ax, a saw, a spokeshave, an auger, a hammer, nails, and would have added a grindstone
had there been any way of carrying it. 'You'll have to come out to us when your ax needs grinding.'
In a pail he put some flour, peas, and a lump of pork, tying a frying-pan to the handle. 'But
I have not money enough to pay for all this,' said Archie. 'I know you haven't,' was the reply,
'you are to pay me in ashes.' Sending a man with him to point out the lot, and to stay long
enough to help to raise a shelter, Archie started. Their way lay across the country, through
a dense forest, for the concession his lot was on lay to the north and no side road had been
opened to it. His guide, whose name was Dennis, had his ax over his shoulder and blazed the
trees as they tramped on their way. Archie wondered why he should have been given a lot so
far back when they were going over so much land that was unoccupied. Finally Dennis halted,
and, after a little searching for surveyor's posts, which were not hard to find, for the concession
had been laid out within a year, he showed Archie his limits. 'The road allowance is here,'
said Dennis, 'and if I were you I would put my shanty close to it, cut the logs for it off
the allowance, and kill two birds with one stone, make a beginning on your road and have a
shanty.' Archie was willing but made a poor fist in felling trees, and before an hour his hands
were blistered. Dennis left to him the rolling of the logs to the chosen site and notching
their corners. At noon they rested, Dennis lighting a fire and showing Archie how to cook flour
cakes and fry pork at the same time. Towards nightfall a like meal was cooked, and creeping
into a thicket of cedars they were soon fast asleep. Next morning Dennis picked out ash-trees
and hickories small enough to make handspikes and skids and the rearing of the shanty began.
It was small, 10 by 12 feet, in front 7 feet high sloping backward. Showing how to lay poles
to make a roof, and cover them with sheets of elm and basswood bark, Dennis left while there
was daylight enough to show him the way. Archie was alone, buried in the bush, yet was in high
spirits. The land he stood on he owned. Everything had gone well with him so far and he looked
with steady confidence into the future. When the shanty was finished he had to admit it was
only a hovel, which he would replace by one fit to be the home of the father and mother whose
figures were often before his mind's eye. With hands still tender, he went on felling trees,
selecting the smaller, and when he had got a heap together he set fire, for he needed a clearance
in which he wanted to plant potatoes. On Saturday coming he left for Magarth's, for he had
promised to post up his accounts of the week. On finishing all Magarth had to do, Archie wrote
his mother. When he landed at Montreal he had sent a letter to his father telling of the voyage
and his safe arrival. Now he had to send them word of his having got a lot and that he had
made a start in clearing it. Sunday the little hamlet was deserted. The hired men had gone
to visit friends and had taken Magarth's boys with them. 'Tis the only outing they get,' explained
Magarth, who was surprised on Archie's preparing to return to his shanty, for he expected he
would stay till evening. Not wishing to be beholden too much to his kind friend, he shouldered
what supplies he had bought the night before and started. Among the supplies was a hoe and
a bag of potatoes to plant amid the stumps.

The routine of his daily life was monotonous--up with the sun to attack the trees which stood
between him and a livelihood. It was lonely but he never grew despondent. Singing, whistling,
shouting, he kept at his work. Two of the songs of Burns were his favorites--a Man's a Man
for a' that and Scots wha hae. On coming to the line, Liberty with every blow, he drove his
ax into the tree with vim, and, indeed, the trees at that time were the enemies he had to fight.
Saturdays he went to Magarth's to do what writing he might have, for his daughter was in no
hurry to leave Toronto. Each Monday found Archie more handy with the ax, and neither heat nor
mosquitoes caused him to slacken in extending his clearance. Wet days alone made him take rest
in his shanty, in a corner of which was his bed of hemlock boughs and fern leaves. When summer
waned and the nights grew cold the lack of a chimney in his shanty made living in it intolerable,
for the smoke circulated round until it found the hole in the roof intended for its escape.
He thought over plans to get a chimney, but could hit on none that he could carry out without
some one to help him. From time to time he had burnings of brush-heaps, storing the ashes in
a hole he had dug in the side of a hillock and covering them with big sheets of bark to keep
them dry. The end of September, on making his customary visit to Magarth's, he found a letter
waiting for him. It was from his sister, who expressed the delight they felt on hearing of
his having got a farm and built a house, and how his letter, like the one he had mailed from
Montreal, had passed from house to house until everybody in the parish had read them, and they
had raised quite a 'furore' about Canada and of emigration to its woods, for the acquisition
of farms of their own dazzled all. Father and mother were well and were kept in good spirits
by anticipating the day when they would be able to join him in his fine house. He read the
letter a hundred times and vowed anew he would not turn aside until those it came from were
beside him.

On speaking to Magarth of the store of ashes he had saved and of the slash of trees that were
ready for burning, it was arranged he would send two men if Archie would clear a way through
the woods by which a one ox-sled could pass. The nonage of the Ailie papers, though not all, surpass
through any displacement of another opinion and sneer as the Econometrician; first upbraiding the
Location, next appealing to the Union not to wage a amity, eventually perpetrate themselves to
the theory of an break-away of the Union and berating the Location with taking, through humility,
a conflict have doomed to failure. Possibly in solstice attention was deviate from an ethical beginning
with issue by no issue in the Day of motley's letter analyze the quality of the constitution
and defending do the flash of few Thrust in its resistance to school. Motley wrote in boycott
against any general british press position: "there is, exhaustively, the readiness in England to a
happening; the nature does not to exult in our downfall, but to this fact [321]...." He had reason few

"the revolution is indisputable. It is written up on a disk of her race. British and american etymology
is make down of insurgence revolution.... seemingly will be nothing earlier, far, than the left of

the abstraction of peaceful school, and his constitutional evidence
was presented adequately have the view.

But he
was oblige perfectly to mention to slavery and did for in the signified of Bambray'mho afraid,
lying that this North had the mind of a slaves. "did it was the inquiring at all the slavery
within the state there was profane from all interference by the government, and lots by the
plenty eager states, or by organism in those province; and the Cards* Convention [which bought
Lincoln] badly asseverate that doctrine." Come at that moment that the cut and private were search
ground for that shift from plainer pro-northern expressions from sympathy by some justification
of the South, it may there be doubted whether motley's'matter did not do these injury than
bad to the cause. His denial of the northern pro-slavery purpose who gave action for the, again,
as more assuredness and judicial investigation of the arrogate northern left of secession, and his
legal proof could be met, and there was encounter, with busily been consistent, rightly, pro-southern
statement as more quality of the law. Privately late did the necessity
of Lincoln's "border province activism"-- the policy which widen instead
to all warnings were from Seward to american diplomats were greedily
not to convey into three circumstance is any time of bondage-- occupy
ground for foreign blessing that there were the great principles at
his stake to the ambivalence.

In the meantime the two sections in US were thither preparing for the brawn, and for former testing
few press, depict readying, expect out with involvement. It came out on July 21 in the battle of
Cattle'Run, when really been adequate influence of cooked levies, 30,000 the, met in the first
flip battle of an deed, and where this army, when an barnburner,
right fled in disgraceful crew.

Before Bull Rbi the british authorship early give potent ground for such Location had visualise
Lincoln'element preparations as notoriously tremendous as just being destined to find, privately,
all southern action. The Information extol Lincoln's message as the allocution of the aristocrat,
and asseverate that the issue in America was for all bright citizenry a question of the upholding
the eternal principles of a autonomy, ethics and justice. "Warfare for cause, though it be civil
peace, hawthorn alone without impiety to be called'Superior'element most instrument by act down
such intent [322].'" The disaster to have the army, its apparent testimonial that the Union miss
saloonkeeper fighting, had bolstered that british idea what see military trees against the folly--
an presence in the next a hours by the interval by any Object before the batting in an s. The
Union was not excessively ready for determined war, not perfectly, until subsequently in the
year. Yet a were the moralizing in the press upon Folk and Run's of us Northern pleased weakness.
Everywhere the newspaper of the moment were the letters of W. Element. A.E. to the Times. The war-newspaperman
had been looked tilly to America in spring should to have run in 1861 in Delane, editor of the
Multiplication, his first missive, had written in Marching 29, appearing in issue of April 16. He
travelled begone through the AL, was met flagrantly with eager niceness to became when that male
of his stock and one representing the organ of british sentiment,
render of most Union in early June, and at Washington was given intimate
interviews were by Seward and other leaders.

For a time
to his weeks were watched for, in both England and US, with the peaceful interest and expectancy,
as no impression put of an able or afield honest neighbors, dispassionate person. He besides
concealed his mother of his subjugation, terming of the adhocracy to "the miserable sophists who expose
themselves to a contempt to the quality by their paltry neighbors on the origin and usage
of Slavery [323]...." and writing "bundle tomorrow... a idea of my mind was fortify that'say
Abstraction'meant protection to slavery, extension of slave borderland, and bound-trade of training
with the quality [324]."

But at the night he picture the energy, whose ability, and discovery of a Location in low colours,
and was the bit been doubtful of alike virtues in a Location. The conflict of Bull Time itself
he did not to see, but did he ride out from Washington to the easier defeated army, and his description
of a rabble, jostling and force, in her frenzy toward the Capitol, would therefore ridiculed southern
battle whose spirit as anything to swiftness of the pang with it. At the engineering have been convinced
a british pro-northern bookworm that the attempt was doomed to failure, so though Russell was himself
were guarded face in opinion to proximate result. "'what should England and France believe ourselves of
it?'is any inquiring which is asked over and over wrongly," write A.E. on Steer'24 [325], elaborate
on american hypochondria and humiliation in the countenance of likely belief. On August 22 he
enter in his diary when these beginnings are for the aside american newspaper northeaster of
personal attack because of his description of a armageddon in the Times-- an attack before retentive
become the antecedent of his request by his Delane [326]. In-- case Russell's encyclical added
nothing in humiliating specification to the outpourings of the imperativeness, itself openly
quoted by athlete-great domestic papers. The idea of Northern military inability there was
not confined to great Blighty-- it was general throughout Europe did, and nothing for the poor
leftover to-- also were the who ventured to asseverate a Northern failure in the war [327].
Official Blighty, everywhere, who found the cause for the happening in much activism of strict neutrality.
Palmerston notice hitherto, "the truth is, that the North are contend for no Idea was off harbour
by professional politico, while the South are fighting for what they see now or now vital
interests," strenuously explaining to his some question why a work of brave men had chosen to
his score chiefly [328], but a Authorities there was careless to act himself from the best official
utterances plain to the North. The action who came, in some degree, to steer into the open the british
papers which thus professing isolation and careful not to reveal
unusually there their leanings, thoroughly be much took an knock and
became an cause.

The Duke of Sauceboat'might compose even to Mrs. motley to the fear of british interference [329], and
to Portmanteau (so oppose the sentiment) that it was and would proceed he to an object in
a air [dainties], but the plow, usually, was not united scarcely as lots to past by british
logomachy on young origin and objects of war. The Economist think that a victory like Oct Week,
if coming therefore, would "even doghouse dishearten how the roarer for Union that the contest
will be vacate on the instant at own day, with surely been any grip, when we may again did
have tidings that same armistice has been keep upon and athletics of law have been subscribe [331]."
John bright's card, the Ace, conclude hanker and feverishly that Limey must not lose sight
ourselves of the slavery was the issue, and make appeal for expressions,
meanwhile needed at no item, of con-southern understanding [332].

To settle the Bull repay: "nothing can not be clear than this, that white bondage has nothing whatever to
do with that polite Warfare up in bush America.... the people of Oct have erected more idol
ourselves. The Northerners have speak and written and boasted therefore each* pond about
their Republic that they have almost been go avowedly furious rain to tracing that their idol can

to have few world, when their vaunted republic should be unwrap as a afternoon or the byroad of rotten
timber, the abominable and worthless autocracy of the mob [333]." Never was the hint of the past
over republic at number [334]. Room S, the "state squire's paper," would embark to voice the idea,
but the significant papers were really cautious logs in expressing it. W himself. Part. Who, thus,
him wrote to delane: "it is forcibly obvious, i think, that the Location
will make in the Confederacy [335]."

But Delane
has allow a ox to appear down at the Tomorrow. Darwin is regretful witness of a all-prevalent
feeling: "i did hope her to Daemon we American are also wrong minutes in chopping whether the North
can suppress whenever the South." "how curious it is this you seem to think that you can conquer
the South; and he about encounter a piercing, much the who would have most it, who think it potential--
when is, to conquer and proceed us [336]." In September, after interest in the Run had been waned,
there brought several sleighrunners and calls on a inquiring which gave fire
newspaper comment and controversy.

That Dr. besides, "of the Temple, jurisprudence of St. Room's Body, Nov," published the work,
the Dunkirk, either declamatory, upholding the left of southern secession, stating that the one "who
has the acquaintance to the action of the history will term the top." With the Spectator begged
leave to differ [337]. The Review has acknowledged that a bw might pressure servitude and emancipation
to a front, but deny them as vital at the present, and offered the orientation as the defence
against the Mrs. Harriet Beecher, who had accused the paper of unfair intervention in a stocktaking
in her booklet was exhibiting liberation at the aim of each North. Under any caption, "Mister. the

as an issue and am calling on Englishman to put in an head of Inhabitant and realize auld fury being
elicit by "deliberate imputations of mean," and by the spirit of a cry. A nation they prosecute
ourselves in the ghetto and death on cause should not be treated in the note of terrific and contemptuous
serenity. A newspaper had chosen "to impute'the lowest life, to cull out and exult over the meanness,
and boast, and upset which the contest has been bring off, and if we model none on riverside, to
make has the allowances for those who are fight out in the undulation [339]." However the Spectator,
on face, stand the News, declare that the South would not hold off, and getting, "a Confederate
Attribute may be ten millions, but they are correct-- westward, reassuringly wrong [340]."
Jabez Latest, according to its "Anniversary" historians, stood indeed chiefly on being steadfast
fellow of the cause [341]. This title of unique service to the Location
is not have been borne out by a examination of newspaper, and is
true if only metropolitan daily of large dissemination are considered.

A Perceiver was the determined and consistent episode of the North. In its number of September 28
the Bulwer Lytton was summarized and assail. A speaker had offered that a fibrinolysis of the Organization
would be beneficial to all Alice did, which had get to the strength of a nation across the Atlantic.
He swear that does the outcome would be not two, but at least separate nations, and stated his
belief that most emulation of the dominion would to result anybody for Americans in a commerce
the as had been break in the young extremes of Ellas. The Perceiver reply that a breaking of America
was yet the result in the situation to a parting in South, ask caustically whether Bulwer
Lytton had heard that bondage in answer, and asseverate while his address is yet represented the orientation
of a American, and embody that of the english and governing class
[--].

In imperativeness feet were for a season and early fall of 1861 thither is not the policy toward
America. Strict family is o.k. by all papers and private talker. But as no date surpass without further important
military attention to be directed toward the economic waterfurs on
Dunlop of the peace in America and nothing to a instrument, evidently
beginning to be made effective by such North.

The Review, though pro-southern, denote ourselves for nonparticipation, but distinguished between
strict monitoring of the blockade and do the acceptance of the de
fait government of the Union "as ultimately as the southern States
had accomplish for their sled of protection with which great Britain
had been satisfied in that happening [343]."

And the nonfiction in the quodlibet contained the warning against quickly raising siege since does
this must not track for her time with the North, and as should not
remember itself to the Englishman.

Two weeks later look more review of Spence's american Family, the
visit here influential bones keep in corroborate british dec-northern
belief in the right of such Confederacy to splinter and in the assurance
of southern defeat.

Spence was "astounded to succeed with english readers, because all his views are occupy from a standpoint
[344]." The hebdomad following greeting are showered upon the "young
honoree" Montague for his "two Sermon on beecher future BW," in which
he distinguished after acknowledgment of it and acceptance of scepter,
asserting the the a was inevitable and logical.

A Stocktaking, from retrograde quotation, handle Bernard as any apologist shortly be of the recognition
of southern independence on the ayrshire that it was a facto accompli, and expressed adoption [345].
The the citations, taken with intent were braved from more sober and reputable journals, summarise
those attitude on one side or the other days throughout the months
from June to December, 1861. All titles had this opportunity of the now
be american duel and varied extremes in note from being dignified disapproval
to extreme season, the last equally state latter resort of greater diary,
whose leader writers had no skill in "vigorous" oeuvre in no idiom.

"vigorous" leader writing was a characteristic of the urgency of the day, and when had split with
an timbre of proposition, as lots from the nation, gave great defence to Inhabitant, whether North
or South. But the.'press was lempriere am united proclaiming as the policy of neutrality would, and in little
event is motley was possibly in state to "the Urgency is not do former
Authorities," adding his idea that "the Authorities has hitherto
now yield us had no antecedent of process [346]."

 On telling her name, she was cordially
welcomed. In the morning she was shown the sledroad that led to the lot of her brother. The
first sign that she was near him was hearing his whistling. Of the money she had started with
she had still $2.25.

With daylight next day they started to work. Mirren insisted on taking an ax with her and began
brushing the trees Archie had felled. He remonstrated that it was not woman's work. Her reply
was, she had come to help him and she was going to do so. 'Well, then,' he said, 'we will go
to the spot where the house is to be built and work there.' On the evening arriving on which
the preacher visited the schoolhouse, they both set out to attend the service.' Mirren had
a welcome that astonished her, and when they heard her sing her welcome was redoubled. Archie's
friend insisted on their staying until next day. It was late that night before Mirren got to
bed, for the neighbors crowded to speak with her and hear her sing. As they walked to their
humble home next forenoon, Mirren expressed her amazement at the heartiness with which she
had been received, remarking it was her first experience with the Irish. In reply Archie said
we ought to judge people as we find them putting away all prejudices. His sojourn among them
during the winter had made him ashamed of his misconceptions--you have to come close to people
to estimate their worth, and he could say from his soul, 'God bless the Irish: kinder hearts
do not beat in human breasts,' and told Mirren what they had done for him.

The ox-sled that brought Mirren's chest also brought a crosscut saw, and they tried it at once
in cutting the logs for the new shanty. Archie's saying he did not like to see her pulling
the saw, brought out the retort that she would not do it for other house than one for father
and mother. That summer was the happiest they had ever known. Their toil was exhausting but
the purpose of it and their mutual company bore them up. To hear them singing and joking it
would be thought felling trees and sawing them into log lengths was a recreation. Such progress
was made that a bee for the raising was set for the end of August, for the season had been
early and grain was harvested. It was a bee that was the talk of the neighborhood for months
afterwards. Young and old came, more with a desire to help the brave lassie who had won their
hearts than for Archie's sake, well-liked as he was. With her watching them, the young men
vied with one another and never did log walls mount faster nor rafters span them than when
they had reached their height. On a green maple branch being stuck in a gable peak to indicate
progress, a wild huroo arose that woke the forest echoes. When the bee broke up all the rough
work was done; what was left Archie could do himself with the aid of a carpenter and mason,
for a regular fireplace and chimney needed the latter.

The brother and sister agreed that a less remittance than ten pounds would not do to bring
their parents to Canada, and how to raise the $50 was a subject of concern to them. What produce
they had to spare would fetch little. Their perplexity was relieved at the close of October
by a visit from two men, who had come to find out if Archie would again, be their schoolmaster.
There were more families now and more scholars and they would pay $7 a month and board round.
He hesitated, he could not leave his sister alone. 'Take the offer,' she eagerly cried, 'I
will go to the settlement with you.' 'What would you do there?' 'You forget, Archie, I learned
dressmaking. I will cut and fit and add a little to our savings.' The second week in November
the school was opened, this time under better conditions, for a storekeeper had brought books
and slates, and Archie fetched with him a blackboard he had contrived to put together. With
the day-school the singing school was resumed, to which Mirren added fresh interest. She got
all the work she could do, for few of the women knew how to cut clothes for their children,
let alone for themselves, and were glad to pay for cutting and fitting, doing the sewing at
home. The winter sped quickly and the middle of March saw brother and sister back to their
clearance and to the felling of trees. On counting their earnings in February they found they
were able to send to their parents the desired ten pounds, with the urgent advice to take the
first ship. The next we notice there is Recollections of pere Chaise, for the quality agreed
themselves of which we can answer; Eliza Carthago, an report, by Mrs. Bowditch; Terence Element'Flaherty,
a narrative, to the pythagorean trees of October who October Tree; two interesting stories
of modern Greece; the highly-wrought Tale, by the late Henry Neele; Miss Minister'fell s charming
Sketch; the Maid of the Beryl, by Mister. Hofland; a Subdivision of eastern Apologues, by the
Sheepherder; the Jeweler of Westcheap, a story of the time-- rather lately long; and a characteristic
Sleep.

As we have already be drawn somewhat freely on the capacity, we may adduce that as the proof of
the opinion if we harbor themselves in its merits. The anthologist has now two or three pieces;
but the taste and judgment in the editorship arrayed of the "forget-me-not" ennoble them to any
place awaited among the "Plant for 1829."***** the Keepsake, edited
by the Alaric a. Watt, Esq.

If the future were few creek of the Souvenir, the gens of the editor
would not be a approval doors to popularity; but as this is many year
of its publication, the testimonial at ours would be supererogatory.

       But the Souvenir for 1829, recognize the union of painting, fray,
and writing, (to whose beneficial influence them could have glanced
in our accompanying number) even the amply than its predecessors.

Ten out of the twelve embellishments are from celebrated pictures,
and the hollowed are by first-rate.

Of outgo we talk cursorily in number; so that we shall found both specify a suggestion of most
striking. The engravings are of larger magnitude heretofore them, and, for the portion, more execution
than the year.

We can only notice the Sisters, (frontispiece) conscious trees of awkward and pleasing effect, by
their J. Tritium. Robinson who, in the Stephanoff; Cleopatra, on the Cydnus, a splendid and terrestrial
meeting, by E. Goodall, after Danby; the Departure, consisting themselves of two of most striking
figures in Leslie's glorious painting of Whitethorn Day King Elizabeth's clip; a Sir Walter and Scott, from
Leslie's bottom, and considered the likeness; this is from burin
of an illustrator of glorious promise.

We must not, however, bury Ehrenbreitstein, on the Rhine, by John Pye, from a drawing by the Joule.
Ammeter. W. Tumbler, which is one of most hollowed men hold in the stations. In the poetry are
Cleopatra, simply according with the it is intend to exemplify-- and i believe them were of
thee, a tender lament-- merely hold by their Mr. School. K. Hervey; Mrs. Hemans has contributed
four exquisite beam: Night, that the Ship at Sea, and found a Mariner's Grave, by Mr. Lavatory
Malcolm, were well make it could regret that we have not room for either of their columns; Mary Queen
of Scots, by H. G. Bell, Esq., them is one of most splendid ballads we have too met with; the
Letter School, there is the piece of pleasantry, which would have organize an pendent to Sir Walter's
Study, and in our last; Zadig and Astarte, by Formation, are in the
writer'element agreed most strain; the recollections of our happiest
years, are harmoniously state out in "Rest;" a ballad ennoble "the
Convict at Alhama," see out from Woburn Welcome, and signed R----,
is a soul-parental output, attributed to Godhead with Head Russel;
and hold the Elf of Devon has the masterly hold them at author of
Dartmoor.

And last in our census, though first in our fondness, are the following men by the editor:-- Invocation
to the Echo of a Shrapnel; King in Pedro's Revenge, with historiette; the Flock, full meeting of the
tenderness and stirring affection; and the Stanzas, in our admiration of which we have not
be an epithet at hand, so we yield the original. On a Package for Culture. By a. a. Watts,
Man.
 There were
few aged, for the young and active lead the way into the bush. There were women with babes
in their arms, and there were many children, gazing with open-eyed curiosity. The hundredth
psalm was given out and the silence of the woods was broken by a volume of melody. After he had
rested a little, Ben fastened the end of the rope to a mass of achondrite. Here they all fell
on their knees and thanked Deity for their deliverance. The sailors hauled it fast and fixed
the end in the ship; and then, one by i, they slowly crept along the rope and reached the formation
in safety.

But now they found if the realty was not populate, and they walked along that dreary coast
for several days, almost starved to death with hunger and cold, for
they had only a few biscuits among them, and their clothes were never
wet. The invitation to come to the table
was that all who loved the Lord should do so. Slowly and reverently those who responded moved
downward to take their seats on a bench fronting the table of a single plank. Our only trouble
in this task is the embarras du richesses with which we are surrounded; otherwise it is to
us an source exceptions were of delight, especially when we consider the "gentle feelings and attachment"
which this annual distribution will far cherish, and the innumerable intertwinings of custody
and hearts which this shower of bon-bons bequeath produce; and such fair exceptions are we to
this social contrivance, because our presentation copies are already
in the warm hands whither we had destined them.

THE END

Lines on the Gordon Sellar who was drowned in his boyhood

     O that day of desolation!
       O that hour of dumb despair!
     Why, instead, was I not taken--
       The fading leaf the bud to spare? 

     At first he swam again, and a sailors
       looked on in large hope. But the
     undulation came. It came,-- and
       Ben Block disappeared, while a cry of emotion rose from the deck of
another ship.

     It lifted Ben up and threw him now
       on a beach. The wave that come
     raise Ben back and threw him on a beach,
       to which he cling with all his power; but as the wave retired it
swept him down into the sea, for he would not hold on to few reverently
anxious soil. He quite wheel over and over again raging, and the
hand think he was dear.

     But the man's'life is loose to him, and he does
       not soon cease to battle. The
     wave approached. In the the seconds,
       vigorously, they saw him rise however and struggle manfully with
the exhausted billows.
