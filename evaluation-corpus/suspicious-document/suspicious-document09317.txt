The following Sunday broke blue and warm. The Bunner sisters were habitual church-goers, but
for once they left their prayer-books on the what-not, and ten o'clock found them, gloved and
bonneted, awaiting Miss Mellins's knock. Miss Mellins presently appeared in a glitter of jet
sequins and spangles, with a tale of having seen a strange man prowling under her windows till
he was called off at dawn by a confederate's whistle; and shortly afterward came Mr. Ramy,
his hair brushed with more than usual care, his broad hands encased in gloves of olive-green kid.

The little party set out for the nearest street-car, and a flutter of mingled gratification
and embarrassment stirred Ann Eliza's bosom when it was found that Mr. Ramy intended to pay
their fares. Nor did he fail to live up to this opening liberality; for after guiding them
through the Mall and the Ramble he led the way to a rustic restaurant where, also at his expense,
they fared idyllically on milk and lemon-pie.

After this they resumed their walk, strolling on with the slowness of unaccustomed holiday-makers
from one path to another--through budding shrubberies, past grass-banks sprinkled with lilac
crocuses, and under rocks on which the forsythia lay like sudden sunshine. Everything about
her seemed new and miraculously lovely to Ann Eliza; but she kept her feelings to herself,
leaving it to Evelina to exclaim at the hepaticas under the shady ledges, and to Miss Mellins,
less interested in the vegetable than in the human world, to remark significantly on the probable
history of the persons they met. All the alleys were thronged with promenaders and obstructed
by perambulators; and Miss Mellins's running commentary threw a glare of lurid possibilities
over the placid family groups and their romping progeny.

Ann Eliza was in no mood for such interpretations of life; but, knowing that Miss Mellins had
been invited for the sole purpose of keeping her company she continued to cling to the dress-maker's
side, letting Mr. Ramy lead the way with Evelina. Miss Mellins, stimulated by the excitement
of the occasion, grew more and more discursive, and her ceaseless talk, and the kaleidoscopic
whirl of the crowd, were unspeakably bewildering to Ann Eliza. Her feet, accustomed to the
slippered ease of the shop, ached with the unfamiliar effort of walking, and her ears with
the din of the dress-maker's anecdotes; but every nerve in her was aware of Evelina's enjoyment,
and she was determined that no weariness of hers should curtail it. Yet even her heroism shrank
from the significant glances which Miss Mellins presently began to cast at the couple in front
of them: Ann Eliza could bear to connive at Evelina's bliss, but not to acknowledge it to others.

At length Evelina's feet also failed her, and she turned to suggest that they ought to be going
home. Her flushed face had grown pale with fatigue, but her eyes were radiant.

The return lived in Ann Eliza's memory with the persistence of an evil dream. The horse-cars
were packed with the returning throng, and they had to let a dozen go by before they could
push their way into one that was already crowded. Ann Eliza had never before felt so tired.
Even Miss Mellins's flow of narrative ran dry, and they sat silent, wedged between a negro
woman and a pock-marked man with a bandaged head, while the car rumbled slowly down a squalid
avenue to their corner. Evelina and Mr. Ramy sat together in the forward part of the car, and
Ann Eliza could catch only an occasional glimpse of the forget-me-not bonnet and the clock-maker's
shiny coat-collar; but when the little party got out at their corner the crowd swept them together
again, and they walked back in the effortless silence of tired children to the Bunner sisters'
basement. As Miss Mellins and Mr. Ramy turned to go their various ways Evelina mustered a last
display of smiles; but Ann Eliza crossed the threshold in silence, feeling the stillness of
the little shop reach out to her like consoling arms.

That night she could not sleep; but as she lay cold and rigid at her sister's side, she suddenly
felt the pressure of Evelina's arms, and heard her whisper: "Oh, Ann Eliza, warn't it heavenly?"

VI

For four days after their Sunday in the Park the Bunner sisters had no news of Mr. Ramy. At
first neither one betrayed her disappointment and anxiety to the other; but on the fifth morning
Evelina, always the first to yield to her feelings, said, as she turned from her untasted tea:
"I thought you'd oughter take that money out by now, Ann Eliza."

Ann Eliza understood and reddened. The winter had been a fairly prosperous one for the sisters,
and their slowly accumulated savings had now reached the handsome sum of two hundred dollars;
but the satisfaction they might have felt in this unwonted opulence had been clouded by a suggestion
of Miss Mellins's that there were dark rumours concerning the savings bank in which their funds
were deposited. They knew Miss Mellins was given to vain alarms; but her words, by the sheer
force of repetition, had so shaken Ann Eliza's peace that after long hours of midnight counsel
the sisters had decided to advise with Mr. Ramy; and on Ann Eliza, as the head of the house,
this duty had devolved. Mr. Ramy, when consulted, had not only confirmed the dress-maker's
report, but had offered to find some safe investment which should give the sisters a higher
rate of interest than the suspected savings bank; and Ann Eliza knew that Evelina alluded to
the suggested transfer.

"Why, yes, to be sure," she agreed. "Mr. Ramy said if he was us he wouldn't want to leave his
money there any longer'n he could help."

"It was over a week ago he said it," Evelina reminded her.

"I know; but he told me to wait till he'd found out for sure about that other investment; and
we ain't seen him since then."

Ann Eliza's words released their secret fear. Her had dad oculus postdate her began. But if Eudemius

Eudemius to hate. Never before had she felt so old, so hopeless and humble. She knew
she was bound on a love-errand of Evelina's, and the knowledge seemed to dry the last drop
of young blood in her veins. It took from her, too, all her faded virginal shyness; and with
a brisk composure she turned the handle of the clock-maker's door.

But as she entered her heart began to tremble, for she saw Mr. Ramy, his face hidden in his
hands, sitting behind the counter in an attitude of strange dejection. At the click of the
latch he looked up slowly, fixing a lustreless stare on Ann Eliza. For a moment she thought
he did not know her.

"Oh, you're sick!" she exclaimed; and the sound of her voice seemed to recall his wandering senses.

"Why, if it ain't Miss Bunner!" he said, in a low thick tone; but he made no attempt to move,
and she noticed that his face was the colour of yellow ashes.

"You ARE sick," she persisted, emboldened by his evident need of help. "Mr. Ramy, it was real
unfriendly of you not to let us know."
