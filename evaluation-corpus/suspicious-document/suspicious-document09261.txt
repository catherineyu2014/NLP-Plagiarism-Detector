CHAPTER XXII.

Up to within a few days Katharina had still been a dependent and docile child, who had made
it a point of honor to obey instantly, not only her mother's lightest word, but Dame Neforis,
too; and, since her own Greek instructress had been dismissed, even the acid Eudoxia.  She
had never concealed from her mother, or the worthy teacher whom she had truly loved, the smallest
breach of rules, the least naughtiness or wilful act of which she had been guilty; nay, she
had never been able to rest till she had poured out a confession, before evening prayer, of
all that her little heart told her was not perfectly right, to some one whom she loved, and
obtained full forgiveness.  Night after night the "Water- wagtail" had gone to sleep with a
conscience as clear and as white as the breast of her whitest dove, and the worst sin she had
ever committed during the day was some forbidden scramble, some dainty or, more frequently,
some rude and angry word.

But a change had first come over her after Orion's kiss in the intoxicating perfume of the
flowering trees; and almost every hour since had roused her to new hopes and new views.  It
had never before occurred to her to criticise or judge her mother; now she was constantly doing
so. The way in which Susannah had cut herself off from her neighbors in the governor's house,
to her daughter seemed perverse and in bad taste; and the bitterly vindictive attacks on her
old friends, which were constantly on Susannah's lips, aggrieved the girl, and finally set
her in opposition to her mother, whose judgment had hitherto seemed to her infallible. Thus,
when the governor's house was closed against her, there was no one in whom she cared to confide,
for a barrier stood between her and Paula, and she was painfully conscious of its height each
time the wish to pass it recurred to her mind.  Paula was certainly "that other" of whom Orion
had spoken; when she had stolen away to see her in the evening after the funeral, she had been
prompted less by a burning wish to pour out her heart to a sympathizing hearer, than by torturing
curiosity mingled with jealousy.  She had crept through the hedge with a strangely-mixed feeling
of tender longing and sullen hatred; when they had met in the garden she had at first given
herself up to the full delight of being free to speak, and of finding a listener in a woman
so much her superior; but Paula's reserved replies to her bold questioning had revived her
feelings of envy and grudge.  Any one who did not hate Orion must, she was convinced, love him.

Were they not perhaps already pledged to each other!  Very likely Paula had thought of her
as merely a credulous child, and so had concealed the fact!

This "very likely" was torture to her, and she was determined to try, at any rate, to settle
the doubt.  She had an ally at her command; this was her foster-brother, the son of her deaf
old nurse; she knew that he would blindly obey all her wishes--nay, to please her, would throw
himself to the crocodiles in the Nile.  Anubis had been her comrade in all her childish sports,
till at the age of fourteen, after learning to read and write, her mother had obtained an appointment
for him in the governor's household, as an assistant to be further trained by the treasurer
Nilus. Dame Susannah intended to find him employment at a future date on her estates, or at
Memphis, the centre of their administration, as he might prove himself capable.  The lad was
still living with his mother under the rich widow's roof, and only spent his working days at
the governor's house, he was industrious and clever during office hours, though between whiles
he busied himself with things altogether foreign to his future calling.  At Katharina's request
he had opened a communication between the two houses by means of carrier-pigeons, and many
missives were thus despatched with little gossip, invitations, excuses, and the like, from
Katharina to Mary and back again.  Anubis took great pleasure in the pretty creatures, and
by the permission of his superiors a dovecote was erected on the roof of the treasurer's house.
Mary was now lying ill, and their intercourse was at an end; still, the well-trained messengers
need not be idle, and Katharina had begun to use them for a very different purpose.

Orion's envoy had been detained a long time at Rufinus' door the day before; and she had since
learnt from Anubis, who was acquainted with all that took place in Nilus' office, that Paula's
moneys were to be delivered over to her very shortly, and in all probability by Orion himself.
They must then have an interview, and perhaps she might succeed in overhearing it.  She knew
well how this could be managed; the only thing was to be on the spot at the right moment.

On the morning after the full-moon, at two hours and a half before noon, the little boy whose
task it was to feed the feathered messengers in their dove-cote brought her a written scrap,
on which Anubis informed her that Orion was about to set out; but he was not very warmly welcomed,
for the hour did not suit her at all.  Early in the morning Bishop Plotinus had come to inform
Susannah that Benjamin, Patriarch of Alexandria, was visiting Amru on the opposite shore, and
would presently honor Memphis with his presence.  He proposed to remain one day; he had begged
to have no formal reception, and had left it to the bishop to find suitable quarters for himself
and his escort, as he did not wish to put up at the governor's house.  The vain widow had at
once pressingly urged her readiness to receive the illustrious guest under her roof: The prelate's
presence must bring a blessing on the house, and she thought, too, that she might turn it to
advantage for several ends she just now happened to have in view.

A handsome reception must be prepared; there were but a few hours to spare, and even before
the bishop had left her, she had begun to call the servants together and give them orders.
The whole house must be turned upside down; some of the kitchen staff were hurried off into
the town to make purchases, others bustled round the fire; the gardeners plundered the beds
and bushes to weave wreaths and nosegays for decorations; from cellar to roof half a hundred
of slaves, white, brown and black, were toiling with all their might, for each believed that,
by rendering a service to the Patriarch, he might count on the special favor of Heaven, while
their unresting mistress never ceased screaming out her orders as to what she wished done.

Susannah, who as a girl had been the eldest of a numerous and not wealthy family, and had been
obliged to put her own hand to things, quite forgot now that she was a woman of position and
fortune whom it ill-beseemed to do her own household work; she was here, there, and everywhere,
and had an eye on all--excepting indeed her own daughter; but she was the petted darling of
the house, brought up to Greek refinement, whose help in such arduous labors was not to be
thought of; indeed, she would only have been in the way.

When the bishop had taken his leave Katharina was merely desired to be ready in her best attire,
with a nosegay in her hand, to receive the Patriarch under the awning spread outside the entrance.
More than this the widow did not require of her, and as the girl flew up the stairs to her
room she was thinking: "Orion will be coming directly: it still wants fully two hours of noon,
and if he stays there half an hour that will be more than enough.  I shall have time then to
change my dress, but I will put my new sandals on at once as a precaution; nurse and the maid
must wait for me in my room.  They must have everything ready for my return-- perhaps he and
Paula may have much to say to each other.  He will not get off without a lecture, unless she
has already found an opportunity elsewhere of expressing her indignation."

A few minutes later she had sprung to the top of a mound of earth covered with turf, which
she had some time since ordered to be thrown up close behind the hedge through which she had
yesterday made her way.  Her little feet were shod with handsome gold sandals set with sapphires,
and she seated herself on a low bench with a satisfied smile, as though to assist at a theatrical
performance. I. The.

Biddy O. By Title. Anubis B. GUSTAFSON. CHAPTER. You sit biddy O, this rag-chooser baby who found
Lily De component broken doll in residue-can there cold winter's
morning? I have not got my oath about her.

Biddy had the girl-friend, the boy, who called himself" chairlier-Shauzy. "I surmise his name Charley
Element'Shaughnessy. He was once by poor and alone sentences in world as biddy ablutions, and never
badly staid night. When biddy run off to doll that cold morning, she not instantaneously think
of hospital and a girl who had usually posted her ceased the flowers,
but she thought how she would get Charley that night.

The thing to be done was to dress, and this was this biddy managed his technology. She take a weapon
and chop out a skirt, ill she pulled up of wad. The batch of what?

Pins. Pins that she had follow on street, when she dragged the street,
and had stuck thick and" gave criss-cross "about grave.

With curses of biddy whispered so the sides of cut. Next she took a cloth she had illume out,
and plug her tough forefinger, and through one of holes earned a doll, the aba. Only Conveyance was
dress, and about as well biddy, too.

Biddy had been once quick room in a, and had too knocked over shoulders to see who come in and
up of cellar. You who do not ideate in cellar, and do not get about
and slapped as biddy did, can hardly live how glad she was the the
one hauled to notice of her.

She conceal Golliwog straw where she was up night, and however hurried up to cans and butt along
she could, laughing in promise of bursting something already day
which would partly Mrs. asleep, and today that she dare to show, and
possibly be detected to see out and act with small.

Mrs.
brown was the woman who saved a floor, and the children of street
called her"

Grumpy.

"Biddy did not insight
sentences, and get a copper than usual trip for citizenry, away that
young Mrs. brown was away cross, and biddy went to Conveyance up where
she could seem her.

She put awake, in hand, expect for Charley helped. Charley was the carrier, but he was not a boy.
He had the large ugly eyes you may see the children of immigrants.
But he was weak body, and far yield.

He populate
as biddy did, among his radical, who were all the unsmooth because
they were already poor miserable ablutions.

Then he got looked about trade, and stood the chance at all among other newsboys, who jostle him
today, and called their document then long that Charley s thin sound
could not be tear.

The newsboys make money papers-- think much that they stop in category of business for themselves,
and fail on world.

I have seen this who carrier.

They have bright, sharp, old-looking countenance. They have wiry, strong bodies, health, and see with
foot of nothing. Wasn't helped much boy at all.

He get poked, or force, and whomp, and tripped up, and laughed at. The girls name him" fraid-cat, "because
they thought he was the coward.

The boys said he was never of the boy, and shouted," hallo, still! "when they saw him. Charley did
not come the. He went by papers to day, and managed to occupy the; and, only, he did errands
and already. In shipway he earned enough yellow.'s, and buy to eat
to keep in him.

Charley straw was next to biddy's, and when he come into biddy fix to him all about plaything,
him polly how one of its weaponry was doomed at ginglymus.

Charley put up his hand in dark, and inquire her to knocked him sell the moment. He felt it
out cautiously, and gave it up without speech.

Biddy broken the, and manly they went to sleep. One day biddy occur to find many curses after hour.
She was going elaborate out again; but first she stooped, and felt
under a golliwog was larn!

Biddy sat, today faint minute; very she sprang to flatfoot, had picked
out the cellar, and corner where old Mrs. brown apple.

Biddy table over and get both hands in char'mho, pulling as if she carry her out, and all. Biddy's face
was pale, and her eyes like white-hot coals, as she pant ahead:"
scat me!

Occupy me! I'll had yet leave go ye give it me! "" Howld, the'lave
ab me! "cried a woman.

She grasped biddy'element Horapollo, and drew them toward her to ease the hair; but biddy'siemens
little fingerbreadth were potent.

She tugged hard, and kept himself of pant," i'll, there help ye hurt me. Oh! "This had the a" eh!
"go from biddy's, she had name herself thus from Mrs. brown, and had fling and enough over Charley,
who had willingly been do clue at her as he began out behind Mrs.
brown.

Mrs. brown rubbed her receive, smoothed back her apron, jabbering, came panting out to children.
Biddy had let shift of charley, and was sitting left pavement holding her doll, and looking
with master and recover he lighted at arm, cubitus. Charley knew the man to who used the out all kind of matter
with pocketknife, and who seemed as ready to give apiece as sale.

Charley had occupy biddy's dame, who had loud and thus so bruised it.

He was on property under biddy'siemens bran for her, when he found
biddy Mrs. brown.

Charley s plan was perfect.

To the hydra was that he shy't plan for biddy simply, or she had spoiled without it.
  And such a friend she would be to him!

She, like Orion, could not for some time speak; but he, at last, was unable to contain himself;
he hastened towards her and pressed her hand to his lips with fervent gratitude, while she--she
had to submit; nay, she would have been incapable of resisting him if, as in her dream, he
had clasped her in his arms, to his heart.  His burning lips had rested fervently on her hand,
but it was only for an instant that she abandoned herself to the violent agitation that mastered
her.  Then with a great effort her instinct and determination to do right enabled her to control
it; she pushed him from her decisively but not ungently, and then, with some emotion and an
arch sweetness which he had never before seen in her, and which charmed him even more than
her noble and lofty pride, she said, threatening him with her finger.

"Take care, Orion!  Now I have the stone and the setting; yes, that very setting.  Beware of
the consequences, rash man!"

"Not at all.  Say rather: Fool, who at last has succeeded in doing something rational," he
replied joyfully.  "What I have brought you is not a gift; it is your own.  To you it can be
neither more nor less than it was before; but to me it has gained inestimably in value since
it places my honor, perhaps my life even, in your keeping; I am in your power as completely
as the humblest slave in the palace is in that of the Emperor.  Keep the gem, and use it and
this fateful gold trifle till the day shall come when my weal and woe are one with yours."

"For your dead father's sake," she answered, coloring deeply, "your weal lies already very
near my heart.  Am not I, who brought upon you your father's curse, bound indeed to help you
to free yourself from the burden of it?  And it may perhaps be in my power to do so, Orion,
if you do not scorn to listen to the counsels of an ignorant girl?"

"Speak," he cried; but she did not reply immediately.  She only begged him to come into the
garden with her; the close atmosphere of the room had become intolerable to both, and when
they got out and Katharina had first caught sight of them their flushed cheeks had not escaped
her watchful eye.

In the open air, a scarcely perceptible breath from the river moderated the noontide heat,
and then Paula found courage to tell him what Philippus had called his apprehension in life.
It was not new to him; indeed it fully answered to the principles he had laid down for the
future.  He accepted it gratefully: "Life is a function, a ministry, a duty!"  the words were
a motto, a precept that should aid him in carrying out his plans.

"And the device," he exclaimed, "will be doubly precious to me as having come from your lips.--But
I no longer need its warning.  The wisest and most practical axioms of conduct never made any
man the better.  Who does not bring a stock of them with him when he quits school for the world
at large?  Precepts are of no use unless, in the voyage of life, a manly will holds the rudder.
I have called on mine, and it will steer me to the goal, for a bright guiding star lights the
pilot on his way.  You know that star; it is. . . ."

"It is what you call your love," she interposed, with a deep blush.--Your love for me, and
I will trust it."

"You will!"  he cried passionately.  "You allow me to hope. . . ."

"Yes, yes, hope!"  she again broke in, "but meanwhile. . . ."

"Meanwhile," he said, "'do not press me further,' ought to end your sentence.  Oh! I quite
understand you; and until I feel that you have good reason once more to respect the maniac
who lost you by his own fault, I, who fought you like your most deadly foe, will not even speak
the final word.  I will silence my longing, I will try......"

"You will try to show me--nay, you will show me--that in you, my foe and persecutor, I have
gained my dearest friend!--And now to quite another matter.  We know how we stand towards each
other and can count on each other with glad and perfect confidence, thanking the Almighty for
having opened out a new life to us.  To Him we will this day. . . ."

"Offer praise and thanksgiving," Orion joyfully put in.

And here began the conversation relating to little Mary which Katharina had overheard.

They had gone out of hearing again when Orion explained to Paula that all arrangements for
the little girl must be postponed till the morrow, as he had business now with Amru, on the
other shore of the Nile.  He decisively confuted her fears lest he should allow himself to
be perverted by the Moslems to their faith; for though he ardently desired to let the Patriarch
feel that he had no mind to submit patiently to the affront to his deceased father, he clung
too firmly to his creed, and knew too well what was due to the memory of the dead, and to Paula
herself, ever to take this extreme step.  He spoke in glowing terms as he described how, for
the future, he purposed to devote his best powers to his hapless and oppressed country, whether
it were in the service of the Khaliff or in some other way; and she eagerly entered into his
schemes, quite carried away by his noble enthusiasm, and acknowledging to herself with silent
rapture the superiority of his mind and the soaring loftiness of his soul.

When, presently, they began talking again of the past she asked him quite frankly, but in a
low voice and without looking up, what had become of the emerald he had taken from the Persian
hanging.  He turned pale at this, looked at the ground, and hesitatingly replied that he had
sent it to Constantinople--"to have it set--set in an ornament--worthy of her whom --whom he.
.  .  ."

But here he broke off, stamped angrily with his foot, and looking straight into the girl's
eyes exclaimed:

"A pack of lies, foul and unworthy lies!--I have been truthful by nature all my life; but does
it not seem as though that accursed day forced me to some base action every time it is even
mentioned?  Yes, Paula; the gem is really on its way to Byzantium.  But the stolen gift was
never meant for you, but for a fair, gentle creature, in nothing blameworthy, who gave me her
heart.  To me she was never anything but a pretty plaything; still, there were moments when
I believed--poor soul!--I first learnt what love meant through you, how great and how sacred
it is!--Now you know all; this, indeed, is the truth!"

They walked on again, and Katharina, who had not been able to gather the whole of this explanation,
could plainly hear Paula's reply in warm, glad accents:

"Yes, that is the truth, I feel.  And henceforth that horrible day is blotted out, erased from
your life and mine; and whatever you tell me in the future I shall believe."

And the listener heard the young man answer in a tremulous voice:

"And you shall never be deceived in me.  Now I must leave you; and I go, in spite of my griefs,
a happy man, entitled to rejoice anew.  O Paula, what do I not owe to you!  And when we next
meet you will receive me, will you not, as you did that evening on the river after my return?"

"Yes, indeed;  and with even more glad confidence," replied Paula, holding out her hand with
a lovely graciousness that came from her heart; he pressed it a moment to his lips, and then
sprang on to his horse and rode off at a round trot, his slave following him.

"Katharina, child, Katharina!"  was shouted from Susannah's house in a woman's high-pitched
voice.  The water-wagtail started up, hastily smoothing her hair and casting an evil glance
at her rival, "the other," the supplanter who had basely betrayed her under the sycamores;
she clenched her little fist as she saw Paula watching Orion's retreating form with beaming
eyes.  Paula went back into the house, happy and walking on air, while the other poor, deeply-wounded
child burst into violent weeping at the first hasty words from her mother, who was not at all
satisfied with the disorder of her dress; and she ended by declaring with defiant audacity
that she would not present the flowers to the patriarch, and would remain in her own room,
for she was dying of headache.--And so she did.

CHAPTER XXIV.

In the course of the afternoon Orion paid his visit to the Arab governor. He crossed the bridge
of boats on his finest horse.

Only two years since, the land where the new town of Fostat was now growing up under the old
citadel of Babylon had been fields and gardens; but at Amru's word it had started into being
as by a miracle; house after house already lined the streets, the docks were full of ships
and barges, the market was alive with dealers, and on a spot where, during the siege of the
fortress, a sutler's booth had stood, a long colonnade marked out the site of a new mosque.

There was little to be seen here now of native Egyptian life; it looked as though some magician
had transported a part of Medina itself to the shores of the Nile.  Men and beasts, dwellings
and shops, though they had adopted much of what they had found in this ancient land of culture,
still bore the stamp of their origin; and wherever Orion's eye fell on one of his fellow-countrymen,
he was a laborer or a scribe in the service of the conquerors who had so quickly made themselves
at home.

Before his departure for Constantinople one of his father's palm-groves had occupied the spot
where Amru's residence now stood opposite the half- finished mosque.  Where, now, thousands
of Moslems, some on foot, some on richly caparisoned steeds, were passing to and fro, turbaned
and robed after the manner of their tribe, with such adornment as they had stolen or adopted
from intercourse with splendor-loving nations, and where long trains of camels dragged quarried
stones to the building, in former times only an occasional ox-cart with creaking wheels was
to be seen, an Egyptian riding an ass or a bare-backed nag, and now and then a few insolent
Greek soldiers.  On all sides he heard the sharper and more emphatic accent of the sons of
the desert instead of the language of his forefathers and their Greek conquerors.  Without
the aid of the servant who rode at his side he could not have made himself understood on the
soil of his native land.

He soon reached Amru's house and was there informed by an Egyptian secretary that his master
was gone out hunting and would receive him, not in the town, but at the citadel.  There, on
a pleasant site on the limestone hills which rose behind the fortress of Babylon and the newly-
founded city, stood some fine buildings, originally planned as a residence for the Prefect;
and thither Amru had transported his wives, children, and favorite horses, preferring it, with
very good reason, to the palace in the town, where he transacted business, and where the new
mosque intercepted the view of the Nile, while this eminence commanded a wide prospect.

The sun was near setting when Orion reached the spot, but the general had not yet come in from
the chase, and the gate-keeper requested that he would wait.

Orion was accustomed to be treated in his own country as the heir of the greatest man in it;
the color mounted to his brow and his Egyptian heart revolted at having to bend his pride and
swallow his wrath before an Arab.  He was one of the subject race, and the thought that one
word from his lips would suffice to secure his reception in the ranks of the rulers forced
itself suddenly on his mind; but he repressed it with all his might, and silently allowed himself
to be conducted to a terrace screened by a vine-covered trellis from the heat of the sun.

He sat down on one of the marble seats by the parapet of this hanging garden and looked westward. From

He looked sadly at Orion, as though the sight of him revived some loved image in his mind,
kissed his brow, and as soon as the youth had left the anteroom he hastily drew open the curtain
that hung across the door into the dining-room.--A few steps behind it stood the Vekeel, who
was arranging the straps of his sword-belt.

"Listener!"  exclaimed the Arab with intense scorn, "you, a man of gifts, a man of deeds! 
A hero in battle and in council; lion, serpent, and toad in one!  When will you cast out of
your soul all that is contemptible and base?  Be what you have made yourself, not what you
were; do not constantly remind the man who helped you to rise that you were born of a slave!"

"My Lord!"  began the Moor, and the whites of his rolling eyes were ominously conspicuous in
his black face.  But Amru took the words out of his mouth and went on in stern and determined
reproof:

"You behaved to that noble youth like an idiot, like a buffoon at a fair, like a madman."

"To Hell with him!"  cried Obada, "I hate the gilded upstart."

"Envious wretch!  Do not provoke him!  Times change, and the day may come when you will have
reason to fear him."

"Him?"  shrieked the other.  "I could crush the puppet like a fly!  And he shall live to know it."

"Your turn first and then his!"  said Amru.  "To us he is the more important of the two--yes,
he, the up start, the puppet.  Do you hear? Do you understand?  If you touch a hair of his
head, it will cost you your nose and ears!  Never for an hour forget that you live--and ought
not to live--only so long as two pairs of lips are sealed.  You know whose.  That clever head
remains on your shoulders only as long as they choose.  Cling to it, man; you have only one
to lose!  It was necessary, my lord Vekeel, to remind you of that once more!"

The Negro groaned like a wounded beast and sullenly panted out: "This is the reward of past
services; these are the thanks of Moslem to Moslem!-- And all for the sake of a Christian dog."

"You have had thanks, and more than are your due," replied Amru more calmly.  "You know what
you pledged yourself to before I raised you to be my Vekeel for the sake of your brains and
your sword, and what I had to overlook before I did so--not on your behalf, but for the great
cause of Islam.  And, if you wish to remain where you are, you will do well to sacrifice your
wild ambition.  If you cannot, I will send you back to the army, and to-day rather than to-morrow;
and if you carry it with too high a hand you will find yourself at Medina in fetters, with
your death- warrant stuck in your girdle."

The Negro again groaned sullenly; but his master was not to be checked.

"Why should you hate this youth?  Why, a child could see through it! In the son and heir of
George you see the future Mukaukas, while you are cherishing the insane wish to become the
Mukaukas yourself."

"And why should such a wish be insane?"  cried the other in a harsh voice.  "Putting you out
of the question, who is there here that is shrewder or stronger than I?"

"No Moslem, perhaps.  But neither you nor any other true believer will succeed to the dead
man's office, but an Egyptian and a Christian. Prudence requires it, and the Khaliff commands it."

"And does he also command that this curled ape shall be left in possession of his millions?"

"So that is what you covet, you greedy curmudgeon--that is it?  Do not all the crimes you have
committed out of avarice weigh upon you heavily enough?  Gold, and yet more gold--that is the
end, the foul end, of all your desires.  A fat morsel, no doubt: the Mukaukas' estates, his
talents of gold, his gems, slaves, and horses; I admit that.  But thank God the All-merciful,
we are not thieves and robbers!"

"And who was it that dug out the hidden millions from beneath the reservoir of Peter the Egyptian,
and who made him bite the dust?"

"I--I.  But--as you know--only to send the money to Medina.  Peter had hidden it before we
killed him.  The Mukaukas and his son have declared all their possessions to the uttermost
dinar and hide of land; they have faithfully paid the taxes, and consequently their property
belongs to them as our swords, our horses, our wives belong to you or me.  What will not your
grasping spirit lead you to!--Take your hand from your dagger!-- Not a copper coin from them
shall fall into your hungry maw, so help me God!  Do not again cast an evil eye on the Mukaukas'
son!  Do not try my patience too far, man, or else--Hold your head tight on your shoulders
or you will have to seek it at your feet; and what I say I mean!--Now, good- night!  To-morrow
morning in the divan you are to explain your scheme for the new distribution of the land; it
will not suit me in any way, and I shall have other projects to propose for discussion."

With this the Arab turned his back on the Vekeel; but no sooner had the door closed on him
than Obada clenched his fist in fury at his lord and master, who had hitherto said nothing
of his having had purloined a portion of the consignment of gold which Amru had charged him
to escort to Medina.  Then he rushed up and down the room, snorting and foaming till slaves
came in to clear the tables.

CHAPTER XXV.

Orion made his way home under the moonlit and starry night.  He held his head high, and not
since that evening on the water with Paula had he felt so glad or so hopeful.  On the other
side of the bridge he did not at once turn his horse's head homewards; the fresh night air
was so delightful, his heart beat so high that he shrunk from the oppression of a room.  Full
of renewed life, freed from a burden as it were, he made his way at a round pace to the house
that held his beloved, picturing to himself how gladly she would welcome the news that he had
found Amru ready to encourage him in his projects, indeed, to be a fatherly friend.

The Arab general, whose lofty character, intellect, and rectitude his father had esteemed highly,
had impressed him, too, as the ideal of noble manliness, and as he compared him with the highest
officials and warriors he had met at the Court of Byzantium he could not help smiling.  By
the side of this dignified, but impetuous and warm-hearted man they appeared like the old,
rigid idols of his ancestors in comparison with the freely- wrought works of Greek art.  He
could bless the memory of his father for having freed the land from that degenerate race. 
Now, he felt, that lost parent, whose image lived in his soul, was satisfied with him, and
this gave him a sense of happiness which he meant to cling to and enhance by every thought
and deed in the future.  "Life is a function, a ministry, and a duty!"  this watchword, which
had been given him by those beloved lips, should keep him in the new path; and soon he hoped
to feel sure of himself, to be able to look back on such deeds of valor as would give him a
right in his own judgment to unite his lot to that of this noblest of women.

Full of such thoughts as these, he made his way to the house of Rufinus. The windows of the
corner room on the upper floor were lighted up; two of these windows looked out on the river
and the quay.  He did not know which rooms were Paula's, but he looked up at the late-burning
light with a vague feeling that it must be hers; a female figure which now appeared framed
m the opening, showed him that he was not mistaken; it was that of Perpetua.  The sound of

He slowly rode past, and when he presently turned back and again looked up, in the hope this
time of seeing Paula, the place was vacant: however, he perceived a tall dark shadow moving
across from one side of the room to the other, which could not be that of the nurse nor of
her slender mistress.  It must indeed be that of a remarkably big man, and stopping to gaze
with anxious and unpleasant apprehension, he plainly recognized Philippus.

It was past midnight.  How could he account for his being with Paula at this hour?--Was she
ill?--Was this room hers after all?--Was it merely by chance that the nurse was in Rufinus'
room with the physician.

No.  The woman whom he could now see pass across the window and go straight up to the man,
with outstretched hands, was Paula and none other. Spell, him break how you, to bungalow better

.
  Now
the foe is down on the victim; he has not spared his weapons, and there lies the prey dumb
with pain and ignominy, cursing his own folly.--You seem inclined for silence this evening.
Shall I tell you just how it all came about?"

"I know only too well," said Philippus.

"While I, to be sure, can only imagine it!"  growled the old man. "So long as that patrician
hussy needed the poor beast of burthen she could pet it and throw barley and dates to it. 
Now she is rolling in gold and living under a sheltering roof, and hey presto, the discarded
protector is sent to the right about in no time.  This mistress of the hearts of our weak and
bondage-loving sex raises this rich Adonis to fill the place of the hapless, overgrown leech,
just as the sky lets the sun rise when the pale moon sinks behind the hills.  If that is not
the fact give me the lie!"

"I only wish I could," sighed Philippus.  "You have seen rightly, wonderfully rightly--and
yet, as wrongly as possible."

"Dark indeed!"  said the old man quietly.  "But I can see even in the dark.  The facts are
certain, though you are still so blinded as not to see their first cause.  However, I am satisfied
to know that your delusion has come to so abrupt, and in my opinion so happy, an end.  To its
cause--a woman, as usual--I am perfectly indifferent.  Why should I needlessly ascribe to her
any worse sin than she had committed?  If only for your sake I will avoid doing so, for an
honorable soul clings to those whom it sees maligned.  Still, it seems to me that it is for
you to speak, not for me.  I should know you for a philosopher, without such persistent silence;
and as for myself, I am not altogether bereft of curiosity, in spite of my eighty years."

At this Philippus hastily rose and pacing the room while he spoke, or pausing occasionally
in front of the old man, he poured out with glowing cheeks and eager gestures, the history
of his hopes and sufferings--how Paula had filled him with fresh confidence, and had invited
him to her rooms--only to show him her whole heart; she had been strongly moved, surprised
at herself, but unable and unwilling to conceal from him the happiness that had come into her
life.  She had spoken to him, her best friend, as a burthened soul pours itself out to a priest:
had confessed all that she had felt since the funeral of the deceased Mukaukas, and said that
she felt convinced now that Orion had come to a right mind again after his great sin.

"And that there, was so much joy over him in heaven," interrupted Horapollo, "that she really
could not delay doing her cast-off lover the honor of inviting his sympathy!"

"On the contrary.  It was with the utmost effort that she uttered all her heart prompted her
to tell; she had nothing to look for from me but mockery, warning, and reproach, and yet she
opened her heart to me."

"But why?  To what end?"  shrieked the old man.  "Shall I tell you. Because a man who is a
friend must still be half a lover, and a woman cannot bear to give up even a quarter of one."

"Not so!"  exclaimed Philippus, indignantly interrupting him.  "It was because she esteems
and values me,--because she regards me as a brother, and--I am not a vain man--and could not
bear--those were her very words --to cheat me of my affection for even an hour!  It was noble,
it was generous, worthy of her!  And though every fibre of my nature rebelled I found myself
compelled to admire her sincerity, her true friendship, her disregard of her own feelings,
and her womanly tenderness!--Nay, do not interrupt me again, do not laugh at me.  It is no
small matter for a proud girl, conscious of her own dignity, to lay bare her heart's weakness
to a man who, as she knows, loves her, as she did just now to me.  She called me her benefactor
and said she would be a sister to me; and whatever motive you--who hate her out of a habit
of prejudice without really knowing her--may choose to ascribe her conduct to, I--I believe
in her, and understand her.

"Could I refuse to grasp the hand she held out to me as she entreated me with tears in her
eyes to be still her friend, her protector, and her Kyrios!  And yet, and yet!--Where shall
I find resolution enough to ask of her who excites me to the height of passion no more than
a kind glance, a clasp of the hand, an intelligent interest in what I say?  How am I to preserve
self-control, calmness, patience, when I see her in the arms of that handsome young demi-god
whom I scorned only yesterday as a worthless scoundrel?  What ice may cool the fire of this
burning heart? What spear can transfix the dragon of passion which rages here?  I have lived
almost half my life without ever feeling or yearning for the love of which the poets sing.
I have never known anything of such feelings but through the pangs of some friend whose weakness
had roused my pity; and now, when love has come upon me so late with all its irresistible force--has
subjugated me, cast me into bondage--how shall I, how can I get free?

"My faithful friend, you who call me your son, whom I am glad to hear speak to me as 'boy,'
and 'child,' who have taken the place of the father I lost so young--there is but one issue:
I must leave you and this city-- flee from her neighborhood--seek a new home far from her with
whom I could have been as happy as the Saints in bliss, and who has made me more wretched than
the damned in everlasting fire.  Away, away!  I will go--I must go unless you, who can do so
much, can teach me to kill this passion or to transmute it into calm, brotherly regard."

He stood still, close in front of the old man and hid his face in his hands.  At his favorite's
concluding words, Horapollo had started to his feet with all the vigor of youth; he now snatched
his hand down from his face, and exclaimed in a voice hoarse with indignation and the deepest
concern:

"And you can say that in earnest?  Can a sensible man like you have sunk so deep in folly?
Is it not enough that your own peace of mind should have been sacrificed, flung at the feet
of this--what can I call her?-- Do you understand at last why I warned you against the Patrician
brood? --The faith, gratitude, and love of a good man!--What does she care for them?  Unhook
the whiting; away with him in the dust!  Here comes a fine large fish who perhaps may swallow
the bait!--Do you want to ruin, for her sake, and the sake of that rascally son of the governor,
the comfort and happiness of an old man's last years when he has become accustomed to love
you, who so well deserve it, as his own son?  Will you--an energetic student, you--a man of
powerful intellect, zealous in your duty, and in favor with the gods--will you pine like a
deserted maiden or spring from the Leucadian rock like love-sick Sappho in the play while the
spectators shake with laughter?  You must stay, Boy, you must stay; and I will show you how
a man must deal with a passion that dishonors him."

"Show me," replied Philippus in a dull voice.  "I ask no more.  Do you suppose that I am not
myself ashamed of my own weakness?  It ill beseems me of all men, formed by fate for anything
rather than to be a sighing and rapturous lover.  I will struggle with it, wrestle with it
with all the strength that is in me; but here, in Memphis, close to her and as her Kyrios,
I should be forced every day to see her, and day after day be exposed to fresh and humiliating
defeat!  Here, constantly near her and with her, the struggle must wear me out--I should perish,
body and soul. It is "little palays" in Copland'old'impression, and palace is elsewhere
spelt "pallace," a word than instead. Just is made to exclaim, nothing in
all editions but mine, "i see comfort," palays to "i see additional
comfort."

Well, it would considerably be wearisome to matter, and i have said only for the of your readers,
awkward like oure egyptians, rummaging his stores to ascertain whether
that text with which they are acquainted, tallies to I have then quoted.

It is curious to-- see
how Percy (Griefs, i. 157., heart.

I subjoin from few good readings, a, if not all, of them presenting
a text than is to be met with alone.

Comen is nearly in a sorry than "come nowe;" that any, without the
point, hey i may say that my fragment is not cloudesly have an specimen
of typography than Copland, but older superior in its words and phraseology,
a circumstance that communicates to it zealous interest.

In another place why the rhyme is lost by no transposition, "he saide"
for this he; and farther of he, nothing in s Copland's text, we have
mention of "a justice with quest of in eyes." hey so of "most flight
in swerers," meaning of a jury who had condemned only "perhaps hanged
to be."

Few blunder were committed in Copland is that omission was of more word,
enough that a sage is corresponding others without its fit rhyme:
"afterwards Clowdysle cast hys waste have cloudesly, and has sawe
his two bretheren was still at the breaker of the market-place, with
theyr various bowes bent in theyr hand."

Copland s edition omits faste, and it is not have met with in Percy.

Another print in Italics is then wanting in Copland.

Speaking of the porter at the gate of Carlisle, do we are told--
"and to the gate faste he throng."

I am soothing say that it have ever consists of these sheet; but
reveal the is ever half than the production, and it comprises the
stande of that second, and two pages of the third "single."

asyde s, and saw hys brethren good at a corner of a market-place, modern justice to slaine." Well
there do we have, in my fragment, "streyght comen from such kyng,"
neither of own Copland's "Streyght come nowe day from our king."

The line and the last of the portion in my hands, testify to a purity of the text there found;
it begins-- "a gates be shut entirely aside gently;" and it ends,
"the they came to the ready's however."


Pleasant as you may think it to be in Memphis with your lover, fair heart-breaker, you will
have to make way for the plaything you have so lightly tossed aside!  Aye, you certainly will,
depend upon that my beauty, depend upon that!--Here, Anubis!" 

He proclaims himself by name forth his own name, so that it is impossible to a mistake like
him. The Roadrunner must utter his note in ir to be recognized, for few that whom are learned in bird
