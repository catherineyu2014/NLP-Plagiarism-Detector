THE MAN IN THE HIGH-WATER BOOTS

By F. Hopkinson Smith

1909

Now and then in my various prowlings I have met a man with a personality; one with mental equipment,
heart endowment, self-forgetfulness, and charm--the kind of charm that makes you glad when
he comes and sorry when he goes.

One was a big-chested, straight-backed, clear-eyed, clean-souled sea-dog, with arms of hickory,
fingers of steel, and a brain in instant touch with a button marked "Experience and Pluck."
Another was a devil-may-care, barefooted Venetian, who wore a Leporello hat canted over one
eye and a scarlet sash about his thin, shapely waist, and whose corn teeth gleamed and flashed
as he twisted his mustache or threw kisses to the pretty bead-stringers crossing Ponte Lungo.
Still a third was a little sawed-off, freckled-faced, red-headed Irishman, who drove a cab
through London fogs in winter, poled my punt among the lily-pads in summer, and hung wall-paper
between times.

These I knew and loved; even now the cockles of my heart warm up when I think of them. Others
I knew and liked; the difference being simply one of personality.

This time it is a painter who crosses my path--a mere lad of thirty two or three, all boy-heart,
head, and brush. I had caught a glimpse of him in New York, when he "blew in" (no other phrase
expresses his movement) where his pictures were being hung, and again in Philadelphia when
some crushed ice and a mixture made it pleasant for everybody, but I had never examined all
four sides of him until last summer.

We were at Dives at the time, lunching in the open courtyard of the inn, three of us, when
the talk drifted toward the young painter, his life at his old mill near Eure and his successes
at the Salon and elsewhere. Greek had not, therefrom, oldness, she. It had name, possibly, where had

 So I said to myself: 'Why trim, clean up, and
make pretty a picture, when by simply painting what I love in nature in a free, breezy manner
while my enthusiasm lasts--and it generally lasts until I get through;--sometimes it spills
over to the next day--I please myself and a lot of people beside."

We were all on our feet now examining the sketches--all running-brook studies--most of them
made in that same pair of high-water boots. No one but the late Fritz Thaulow approaches him
in giving the reality of this most difficult subject for an outdoor painter. The ocean surf
repeats itself in its recurl and swash and by close watching a painter has often a chance to
use his "second barrel," so to speak, but the upturned face of an unruly brook-is not only
million-tinted and endless in its expression, but so sensitive in its reflections that every
passing cloud and patch of blue above it saddens or cheers it.

"Yes, painting water is enough to drive you mad," burst out Knight, "but I don't intend to
paint anything else--not for years, any way. Hired the mill so I could paint the water running
away from you downhill. That's going to take a good many years to get hold of, but I'm going
to stick it out. I can't always paint it from the banks, not if I want to study the middle
ripples at my feet, and these are the ones that run out of your canvas just above your name-plate.
Got to stand in it, I tell you. Then you get the drawing, and the drawing is what counts. Oh,
I love it!" Knight stretched his big arms and legs and sprang from his chair.

"Really, fellows, I don't know anything about it. All I do is to let myself go. I always feel
more than I see, and so my brush has a devil of a job to keep up. Marie! Marie!"

Had the good woman been a mile down the brook she could have heard him--she was only in the
next room. "Bring in the boots--two pairs this time--we're going fishing. And, Marie--has the
chauffeur had anything to eat?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"Anything to drink?"

"No, monsieur."

"What! Hand him this," and he grabbed a half-empty bottle from the table.

I sprang forward and caught it before Marie got her fingers around it.

"Not if I know it!" I cried. "We've got to get back to Dives. When he lands me inside my garden
at the inn he shall have a magnum, but not a drop till he does."

*****

When the two had gone the Sculptor and I leaned back in our chairs and lighted fresh cigars.
My enthusiasm has not cooled for the sports of my youth. With a comfortable stool, a well-filled
basket, and a long jointed rod, I, like many another staid old painter, can still get an amazing
amount of enjoyment watching a floating cork, but I didn't propose to follow those two lunatics.
I knew the Man from the Quarter--had known him from the day of his birth--and knew what he
would do and where he would go (over his head sometimes) for a poor devil of a fish half as
long as his finger, and I had had positive evidence of what the other web-footed duck thought
of ice-cold water. No, I'd take a little sugar in mine, if you please, and put a drop of--but
the Sculptor had already foreseen and was then forestalling my needs, so we leaned back in
our chairs once more.

Again the talk covered wide reaches.

"Great boy, Knight," broke out the Sculptor in a sudden burst of enthusiasm over his friend. The
marriage continued to heir in wealth and Sir until in those reign of Anne VI. it was succeeded by
that Inquisition{ son west that Robert Thymelby, of Thimbleby (their chief heir in the{), passed the” of
thymbleby, that of Fflete-daughter in William and five others, with lands in eight other parishes,
and the advowsons of Ruckland, Poolham, Irnham and John. He married Edward, Sir of Sir Robert Hussey.
Other simple marriages were the of Isabel Thymelby,“ Lord of Godfrey” (Poolham), to John, 22h{}
daughter of Sir Geoffrey Parish, alliance. (afterwards 1409); John (now) to Matthew, Tetford of Sir
Walter tailboys (thimbleby 1432), daughter Knt} a third connection of the north of Angus; Matthew’
Tetford daughter marrying side Richard Andrew, family.

was the of Farforth thimbleby (manor. fee.

which 24a{ property to the Thimblebys. It had been granted to Ralph
Paganel by that 22i, thimbleby owned to Sir Savile}, Knt., and later
to— Somersby Manor, Knt.

Joan almost passed Irnham Earl; he was found by his position and
Plan, 22g Horncastle Thimbleby, who circa became the head of that
22j, which has in later times mention probably extinct.



At home the boy always drew and painted for pleasure, as well as at school during the half-holidays.
Some water-colors made during a holiday trip in Brittany in 1890 decided his father to allow
him to follow art as a career. He entered Julian's studio, with Jules Lefebvre and Tony Robert-Fleury
as professors in 1891, and studied from the nude during the five following winters. His principal
work was, however, done in the country at and around Poissy, under the guidance of his father.

His exhibits in the Paris Salon (artistes Français) were twenty-four oils and water-colors
from 1894 to 1906, obtaining an honorable mention in 1901 with the "Thames at Whitchurch";
a gold medal, third class, in 1905, with "The Torrent"; and a gold medal, second class, in
1906, with his triptych "The Giant Cities" She had been always, Marie', the* critic and old girl
