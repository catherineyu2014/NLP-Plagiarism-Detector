JACK.

I wish to note, and to suggest to students in ethnology, the Query, how it comes to pass that
John Bull has a peculiar propensity to call things by his own name, his familiar appellative
of Jack?

Of all the long list of abbreviations and familiar names with which times past and present
have supplied us, that which honest Falstaff found most pleasing to his ears, "Jack with my
familiars!" is the household word with which ours are most conversant. Were not Jack the Giant-killer,
Jack and the Bean-stalk, and Little Jack, the intimates of our earliest days? when we were
lulled to sleep by ditties that told of Jack Sprat and his accommodating wife (an instance
of the harmony in which those of opposite tastes may live in the bonds of wedlock); of Jack,
the bachelor who lived harmoniously with his fiddle, and had a soul above the advice of his
utilitarian friend; of Jack who, like Caliban, was to have a new master; of Jack[1] the brother
of Gill; and of the Jack who was only remarkable for having a brother, whose name, as a younger
son, is not thought worthy of mention. And were not our waking hours solaced by songs, celebrating
the good Jack[2], little Jack Horner, and holding up to obloquy the bad Jack, naughty Jacky
Green, and his treachery to the innocent cat? Who does not remember the time when he played
at jack-straws, fished for jack-sharps, and delighted in a skip-jack, or jack-a-jumper, when
jack-in-a-box came back from the fair (where we had listened not unmoved to the temptations
of that eloquent vagabond cheap-Jack) and popped up his nose before we could say Jack {326}
Robinson; and when Jack-in-the-green ushered in May-day? While a halo of charmed recollections
encircles the memory of Jack-pudding, dear to the Englishman as Jack Pottage and Jack Sausage
(Jean Potage and Hans Wurst) are to Frenchman and German.

Our childhood past, Jack still haunts us at every turn and phase of our existence. The smoke-jack
and bottle-jack, those revolutionary instruments that threw the turnspit out of employment
(and have well-nigh banished him from the face of the earth), cook the Jack hare, which we
bring in in the pocket of our shooting-jacket. We wear jack-boots, and draw them off with boot-jacks;
prop up our houses with jack-screws; wipe our hands on jack-towels; drink out of black-jacks,
and wear them on our backs too, at least our ancestors did; while flap-jacks[3] gave a relish
to their Lenten diet, jack-of-the-clock[4] told them the hour; Jack priests held rule over
them; and gentle exercise at the jack, at bowls, helped them to digest their dinners. We ride
upon jack-asses; jacks flourish in our fish-ponds; jack-a-lanterns and jack-snipes flit over
our bogs, the one scarcely less difficult to capture than the other; jack-daws multiply in
our steeples, and jack-herons still linger about our baronial halls.

The four jack knaves, jack-a-lents, jack-a-dandies, jack-a-nasties, and jacks-in-office (jack-an-apeses
every man jack of them), with that name fraught with mysterious terror, Jack Ketch, are the
scape-graces of this numerous family; and, at every Jack who would be the gentleman, at a saucy
Jack who attempts to play the jack with us, our indignation rises, like that of Juliet's nurse.
But, on the whole, Jack is an honest fellow, who does his work in this life, though he has
been reproached with Tom's helping him to do nothing; but let the house that Jack built vindicate
him from this calumny. Jack, we repeat, is an honest fellow, and is so more especially, when
as Jack-tar (Heaven protect him from Jack-sharks both on sea and shore!) he has old Ocean beneath,
and the union-jack above him. Of black and yellow jack, who are foreigners, we make no mention;
neither of Jack-Spaniards, nor of Jacko the monkey, whom we detest; but, go where we will,
Jack meets us, and is master of all trades, for that we hold to be the right, though, we are
aware, not the usual version of the saying. In short, with Merry Andrews, Jerry Sneaks, Tom
Noddies, and Silly Simons, we may all have a casual acquaintance; but Jack, sweet Jack, kind
Jack, honest Jack, Jack still is our familiar.

MYTHE VERSUS MYTH.

When I first began to write on Mythology, I followed the Germans in using mythus for the Greek
~mythos~. I afterwards thought it would be better to Anglicise it, and, strange to say, I actually
found that there was a rule in the English language without an exception. It was this: Words
formed from Greek disyllables in ~os~, whether the penultimate vowel be long or short, are
monosyllables made long by e final. Thus, not only does ~bôlos~ make bole, but ~polos~ pole,
~poros~ pore, ~skopos~ scope, ~tonos~ tone, &c.; so also ~gyros~, gyre; ~thymos~, thyme; ~stylos~,
style; ~kybos~, cube, &c.: I therefore, without hesitation, made an English word m[=y]the.
Mr. Grote, in his History of Greece, has done the very same thing, and probably on the same
principles, quite independently of me; for, as I am informed, he has never condescended to
read my Mythology of Greece and Italy, perhaps because it was not written in German. We have
had no followers, as far as I am aware, but Miss Lynn, in her classical novels, and Mr. J.
E. Taylor, in his translation of the Pentamerone, &c.

Meantime the English language had got another form of ~mythos~, namely, m[)y]th, which I believe
made its first appearance in Mr. Cooley's Maritime and Inland Discovery, and so has the claim
of priority, if not of correctness. This form has been so generally adopted, that it seems
likely ere long to become a mere slang term. It is used for every kind of fiction whatever;
indeed, I have seen it employed where the proper word would be hoax. Nay, to make matters worse,
it is actually used of persons. Mrs. Harris, for instance, has been termed a myth, as also
was Robin Hood, not long since, even in "N. & Q."! I wonder how Apolodorus would have looked,
if he had heard Orion or Polyphemus called a ~mythos~!

Do I then expect the people of England to surrender their glorious privilege of going wrong
without let or hindrance, in matters of grammar and etymology? Far from me be such folly and
presumption. All I venture to expect is, that men of learning and good sense will, when they
are speaking or writing about those venerable fictions which once commanded the assent of polished
nations, use the more dignified term m[=y]the, and the adjective mythic, instead of the hybrid
mythical, leaving the poor unhappy little m[)y]th to be bandied about at the popular will and
pleasure.

WITCHCRAFT IN 1638.

I inclose you an extract from an old document in my possession, which appears to be the examination
of two witnesses against one Mary Shepherd for witchcraft. The nature of the offence is not
{327} specified. Perhaps it may be interesting to some of your readers.

     The Exa[=m] of Jone Coward of Wareham, taken upon Oath the 28
     March, 1638.

     Who sayth, y't about Midsomer last past one Mary Sheapheard of
     Wareham did pull of one of this Ex[=mt]'s stockings, and
     within 2 howers after this Ex[=nt] was taken in all her limbs
     that she could not stur hand or foot, where upon this Ex[=nt]
     considered that the fors'd Mary Sheapheard had done her that
     hurt, and forth w'th cryed out upon the sayd Mary Shep.
     (though the sayd M. Shep. was not present), where upon this
     Ex[=mt]'s mother went unto the house of M. Shep. to perswaed
     her to come downe to this Ex[=nt]; but the sayd M. Shep. would
     not. Whereupon this Ex[=nt]'s mother went unto the Mayor of
     the Town, who co[=m]anded the s'd M. Shep. to goe to this
     Exa[=nt]. At length the s'd Ma. Shep. accordingly did (and
     being co[=e]), she did wring this Ex[=nt] by the hande, and
     p'esently this Ex[=nt] recouered. Ffurther, the Ex[=nt]
     sayth, y't about ye 24 of July next followinge, this
     Ex[=nt] was taken in ye like manner ye second time, w'th
     her hands and feet wrested about, and so sent for the s'd M.
     Shep., who instantly pulled the Ex[=nt] by the hands, and
     p'esently the Ex[=nt] recovered again.

     The Ex[=am] of Ann Trew, single woman, of Wareham, taken upon
     Oath as afors'd.

     Who sayth, y't on ye 16th of March last past she saw Mary
     Shep. come into ye house of Joh. Gillingame, and likewise saw
     Ed. Gillingame come down bare-footed very well, without any
     lamnesse or sickness at all, and p'esently after ye sayd
     Mary Shep. had pulled on the legginge upon the legge of ye
     s'd Ed. Gill., he fell instantly both lame and sick. Further,
     the Ex[=nt] asked the s'd Ed. Gill. (in the time of his
     sickness) what Ma. Shep. did unto him, who answered, she did
     put her hand upon his thigh.

     ANN TREW.

I should like to know if the effect of her supposed sorcery could be attributed to mesmerism.
The document in my possession appears to be original, as Jone Coward's signature is in a different
hand to that of the examination.

ST. AUGUSTIN AND BAXTER.

It probably did not occur to the biographer, that no less illustrious a saint than Augustin,
to whom Puritanism can hardly be imputed, had made a parallel confession of like early depravity
many centuries before. Enlarging on his own puerile delinquencies, and indeed on the wickedness
of children in general, he confesses that, in company with other "naughty boys" ("nequissimi
adolescentuli"), he not only stole apples, but stole them for the mere pleasure of the thing,
and when he "had enough at home":

     "Id furatus sum quod mihi abundabat, et multo melius. Nec eâ
     re volebam frui quam furto appetebam; sed ipso furto et
     peccato. Arbor erat pirus in viciniâ vineæ nostræ pomis
     onusta, nec formâ nec sapore illecebrosis. Ad hanc excutiendam
     atque asportandam, nequissimi adolescentuli perreximus nocte
     intempestâ; et abstulimus inde onera ingentia, non ad nostras
     epulas, sed vel projicienda porcis, etiamsi aliquid inde
     comedimus.... Ecce cor meum, Deus meus, ecce cor meum, quod
     miseratus es in imo abyssi!"--Confessionum, lib. ii. cap.
     iv.

In comparing the two cases, the balance of juvenile depravity is very much against the great
Doctor of Grace. He does not seem to have had even a fondness for fruit to plead in extenuation
of his larceny. He robbed orchards by wholesale of apples, which, by his own admission, had
no attractions either of form or flavour to tempt him. Yet the two anecdotes are so much alike,
that one would be inclined to suspect one story of being a mere recoction of the other if it
were possible to doubt the veracity of Richard Baxter.

{328} The incident, however, is one too familiar in schoolboy life to make the repetition of
the story a matter of surprise. The property in an apple growing within the reach of a boy's
hand has from time immemorial been in peril, and the law itself has not always regarded it
as an object of scrupulous protection. The old laws of the Rheingau, and (if I mistake not)
of some other states, warranted a wayfaring man in picking apples from any tree, provided he
did not exceed the number of three.

FOLK LORE.

Subterranean Bells (Vol. vii., pp. 128. 200.).--In answer to J. J. S.'s inquiry, I beg to state,
that at Crosmere, near Ellesmere, Shropshire, where there is one of a number of pretty lakes
scattered throughout that district, there is a tradition of a chapel having formerly stood
on the banks of the lake. And it is said that the belief once was, that whenever the waters
were ruffled by wind, the chapel bells might be heard as singing beneath the surface. This,
though bearing on the subject of "submarine" or "subaqueous," rather than "subterranean" bells,
illustrates, I think, the tradition to which J. J. S. refers.

Welsh Legend of the Redbreast.--According to my old nurse (a
Carmarthenshire woman), the redbreast, like Prometheus, is the victim
~philanthrôpou tropou~. Not only the babes in the wood, but
mankind at large, are indebted to these deserving favourites. Oh!
     my child, then, in gratitude throw a few crumbs to poor
     red-breast."

Why, a Pythagorean would have eaten a peacock sooner than one of us would have injured a robin.

I inclose you a transcript of a letter of Boswell's which I think worthy of being permanently
recorded, and am not aware of its having been before in print.
