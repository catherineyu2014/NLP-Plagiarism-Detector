Abbey of St. Wandrille, Normandy (Vol. i., pp. 338. 382. 486.).--As the Vicar of Ecclesfield
appears interested in the history of this abbey, in the immediate neighbourhood of which I
am at present living, I forward the following list of works which have relation to the subject,
including the Chronicle, extracts from which have already been given by GASTROS:--

    "Briefve Chronique de l'Abbaye de St. Wandrille, publiée par la
    première fois, d'après le Cartulaire de St. Wandrille, de
    Marcoussis M.S. du XVI. siècle, de la Bibliothèque de Rouen par
    M.A. Potter."--Révue Rétrospective Normande, Rouen, 1842.

    "Le Trisergon de l'Abbaye de Fontenelle (or St. Wandrille), en
    Normandie, par Dom Alexis Bréard. M.S. du XVII.
    siècle."--Bibliothèque de Rouen, M.S.S.Y. 110.

    "Appendix ad Chronicon Fontanellense in Spicileg." Acherii, t.
    ii. p. 285.

    "Gallia Christiana," vol. ii., in fo., page 155., (containing
    the Ecclesiastical History of Normandy).

    "Acta sanctor ord. St. Bened," tom. v.--Miracula Wandregisili.

    "Essais sur l'Abbaye de St. Wandrille, par Langlois," in 8vo.
    Rouen, 1827.

Several books formerly belonging to this monastery, are now in the public library at Havre.

Russian Language (Vol. ii., p. l52.).--A James Heard wrote a grammar of this language, and
published {191} it at St. Petersburgh, in 1827. Mr. Heard also published a volume of Themes,
or Exercises, to his grammar, in the same year. I am not acquainted with any other Russian
grammar written in English.

Hamonière published his Grammaire Russe at Paris in 1817; and Gretsch (not Grotsch) published
(in Russian) his excellent grammar at St. Petersburgh about thirty years ago. A French translation
appeared at the same place in 1828, in 2 vols. 8vo., by Reiff.

In the Révue Encyclopédique for 1829, p. 702., some curious details will be found respecting,
the various Russian grammars then in existence. Jappe's Russian Grammar is possibly a misprint
for Tappe, whose grammar, written in German, is a good one. Besides these, the titles of some
twenty other Russian grammars, in Russian, French, or German, could be mentioned.

The anthologies published by Dr. Bowring, besides his Russian, Dutch, and Spanish, are the
Magyar, Bohemian, Servian, and Polish.

Writing from Oxford, where the first Russian grammar ever published was printed, as your correspondent
JARLTZBERG correctly states, perhaps it may interest him, or his friend, who, he says, is about
to go to Russia, to be informed (should he not already be aware of the fact) that a "Course
of Lectures on Russian Literature" was delivered in this university, by Professor Trithen,
at Sir Robert Tayler's Institution, in the winter of 1849.

MISCELLANEOUS.

A very interesting contribution to our early national literature, as well as to legendary history,
has lately been published by Dr. Nicolaus Delius of Bonn. He has edited in a small octavo volume,
published at a very moderate price, Maistre Wace's St. Nicholas, an old French poem, by the
poetical Canon of Bayeux, whose Roman de Rou et des Ducs de Normandie, edited by Pluquet, and
Roman de Brut, edited by Le Roux de Lincy, are, doubtless, familiar to many of our readers.
The present valuable edition to the published works of Maistre Wace, is edited from two Oxford
MSS., viz., No. 270. of the Douce Collection, and No. 86. of the Digby Collection in the Bodleian:
and to add to the interest of the present work, especially in the eyes of English readers,
Dr. Delius has appended to it the old English metrical life of Saint Nicolas the Bischop, from
the curious series of Lives and Legends which Mr. Black has recently shown to have been composed
by Robert of Gloucester.

JANUS DOUSA. The Notes on Folk Lore have been received and will be used very shortly. The Queries
just received shall be duly inserted.

Errata.--In No. 41., p. 166., col. 1., line 8 from bottom, for "Cordius" read "Cardin"; p.
171., l. 29., for "havers" read "haver"; and p. 172., l. 24., for "Murton" read "Muirton."

PATRES ECCLESIASTICI ANGLICANI.

THIS SERIES OF THE ENGLISH FATHERS OF THE CHURCH,--commencing with ALDHELM, the first Bishop
of Sherborne, which see he held from A.D. 705 to 709, and including VENERABLE BEDE, the father
of English History, who died in 735; BONIFACE, the English Apostle to the Germans, whose martyrdom
took place in 754; LANFRANC, to whose influence over the Conqueror the English owed what liberty
William still allowed them to enjoy; PETER OF BLOIS, the gossiping but querulous archdeacon
of Bath; THOMAS A BECKET, the greatest churchman of any time, and the fearless upholder of
the rights of the Church against the usurpations of the Crown and his contemporaries; honest
plain-spoken JOHN OF SALISBURY; and the specious ERNULPH, Bishop of Lisieux, whose works throw
considerable light upon the court intrigues of the reign of Henry II.,--is edited by the Rev.
Dr. GILES, formerly Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.
