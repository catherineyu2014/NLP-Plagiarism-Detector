PREFACE.

The inquiry into the religious thought of the eighteenth century forms one of the most interesting
subjects for speculation in the history of the intellectual development of western nations.
It is true, that in that history Swift takes no special or distinguished part; but he forms
a figure of peculiar interest in a special circle of his own. Swift had no natural bent for
the ministry of a church; his instincts, his temperament, his intellect, were of that order
which fitted him for leadership and administration. He was a born magistrate and commander
of men. It is, therefore, one of the finest compliments we can pay Swift to say, that no more
faithful, no more devoted, no stauncher servant has that Church possessed; for we must remember
the proud and haughty temper which attempted to content itself with the humdrum duties of a
parish life. Swift entered the service of that Church at a time when its need for such a man
was great; and in spite of its disdain of his worth, in spite of its failure to recognize and
acknowledge his transcendent qualities, he never forgot his oath, and never shook in his allegiance.
To any one, however, who reads carefully his sermons, his "Thoughts on Religion," and his "Letter
to a Young Clergyman," there comes a question--whether, for his innermost conscience, Swift
found a satisfying conviction in the doctrines of Christianity. "I am not answerable to God,"
he says, "for the doubts that arise in my own breast, since they are the consequence of that
reason which he hath planted in me, if I take care to conceal those doubts from others, if
I use my best endeavours to subdue them, and if they have no influence on the conduct of my
life." We search in vain, in any of his writings, for any definite expression of doubt or want
of faith in these doctrines. When he touches on them, as he does in the sermon "On the Trinity,"
he seems to avoid of set purpose, rational inquiry, and contents himself with insisting on
the necessity for a belief in those mysteries concerning God about which we cannot hope to
know anything. "I do not find," he says, in his "Letter to a Young Clergyman," "that you are
anywhere directed in the canons or articles to attempt explaining the mysteries of the Christian
religion; and, indeed, since Providence intended there should be mysteries, I don't see how
it can be agreeable to piety, orthodoxy, or good sense to go about such a work. For to me there
seems a manifest dilemma in the case; if you explain them, they are mysteries no longer; if
you fail, you have laboured to no purpose."

It must at once be admitted that Swift had not the metaphysical bent; philosophy--in our modern
sense of the word--was to him only a species of word spinning. That only was valuable which
had a practical bearing on life--and Christianity had that. He found in Christianity, as he
knew it--in the Church of England, that is to say--an excellent organization, which recognized
the frailties of human nature, aimed at making healthier men's souls, and gave mankind a reasonable
guidance in the selection of the best motives to action. He himself, as a preacher, made it
his principal business, "first to tell the people what is their duty, and then to convince
them that it is so." He had a profound faith in existing institutions, which to him were founded
on the fundamental traits of humanity. The Church of England he considered to be such an institution;
and it was, moreover, regulated and settled by order of the State. To follow its teachings
would lead men to become good citizens, honest dealers, truthful and cleanly companions, upright
friends. What more could be demanded of any religion?

The Romish Church led away from the Constitution as by law established. Dissent set up private
authority, which could no more be permitted in religious than it was in political matters;
it meant dissension, revolution, and the upheaval of tried and trusted associations. Therefore,
the Church of Rome and the teachings of Dissent were alike dangerous; and against both, whenever
they attempted the possession of political power, he waged a fierce and uncompromising war.
"Where sects are tolerated in a State," he says, in his "Sentiments of a Church of England
Man," "it is fit they should enjoy a full liberty of conscience, and every other privilege
of free-born subjects, to which no power is annexed. And to preserve their obedience upon all
emergencies, a government cannot give them too much ease, nor trust them with too little power."

Swift had no passionate love for ideals--indeed, he may have thought ideals to be figments
of an overheated and, therefore, aberrated imagination. The practically real was the best ideal;
and by the real he would understand that power which most capably and most regulatively nursed,
guided, and assisted the best instincts of the average man. The average man was but a sorry
creature, and required adventitious aids for his development. Gifted as he was with a large
sympathy, Swift yet was seemingly incapable of appreciating those thought-forms which help
us to visualize mentally our religious aspirations and emotions. A mere emotion was but subject-matter
for his satire. He suspected any zeal which protested too much for truth, and considered it
"odds on" it being "either petulancy, ambition, or pride."

Whatever may have been his private speculations as to the truth of the doctrines of Christianity
they never interfered with his sense of his responsibilities as a clergyman. "I look upon myself,"
he says, "in the capacity of a clergyman, to be one appointed by Providence for defending a
post assigned me, and for gaining over as many enemies as I can. Although I think my cause
is just, yet one great motive is my submitting to the pleasure of Providence, and to the laws
of my country." If anyone had asked him, what was the pleasure of Providence, he would probably
have answered, that it was plainly shown in the Scriptures, and required not the aid of the
expositions of divines who were "too curious, or too narrow, in reducing orthodoxy within the
compass of subtleties, niceties, and distinctions." Truth was no abstraction--that was truth
which found its expression in the best action; and this explains Swift's acceptance of any
organization which made for such expression. He found one ready in the Church of England; and
whatever his doubts were, those only moved him which were aroused by action from those who
attempted to interfere with the working of that organization. And this also helps to explain
his political attitude at the time when it was thought he had deserted his friends. The Church
was always his first consideration. He was not a Churchman because he was a politician, but
a politician because he was a Churchman. These, however, are matters which are more fully entered
into by Swift himself in the tracts herewith reprinted, and in the notes prefixed to them by
the editor.

It was originally intended that Swift's writings on Religion and the Church should occupy a
single volume of this edition of his works. They are, however, so numerous that it has been
found more convenient to divide them into two volumes--the first including all the tracts,
except those relating to the Sacramental Test; the second containing the Test pamphlets and
the twelve sermons, with the Remarks on Dr. Gibbs's paraphrase of the Psalms, in an appendix.
It is hoped that this division, while it entails upon the student the necessity for a double
reference, will yet preserve the continuity of form enabling him to view Swift's religious
standpoint and work with as much advantage as he would have obtained by the original plan.

The editor again takes the opportunity to thank Colonel F. Grant for the service he has rendered
him in placing at his disposal his fine collection of Swift's tracts. The portrait which forms
the frontispiece to this volume is one of those painted by Francis Bindon, and was formerly
in the possession of Judge Berwick. For permission to photograph and reproduce it here, thanks
are due to Sir Frederick R. Falkiner, Recorder of Dublin.

TO PROVE THAT THE

ABOLISHING OF CHRISTIANITY IN ENGLAND

MAY, AS THINGS NOW STAND, BE ATTENDED WITH SOME INCONVENIENCES, AND PERHAPS NOT PRODUCE THOSE
MANY GOOD EFFECTS PROPOSED THEREBY.

WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1708.

NOTE.

In November, 1707, Swift left Dublin in the train of the then Lord Lieutenant, Lord Pembroke.
His travelling companion was Sir Andrew Fountaine, who, on landing in England, set out with
Lord Pembroke for Wilton, while Swift went on to Leicester to visit his mother. He stayed with
her until some time in December, but, by the middle of the same month, he was in London. During
this absence from Ireland Swift corresponded somewhat freely with Archbishop King of Dublin,
and with Archdeacon Walls--the letters to the former were first printed in Forster's "Life
of Swift." For these Forster was indebted to the Rev. Mr. Reeves (vicar of Lusk, co. Dublin),
who discovered them in the record-room of the see of Armagh (see "Life," p. 205 et seq. and
note). One of Swift's intentions, while in the metropolis, was to push forward the claim of
the Irish clergy for the remission of the First Fruits and Tenths, a grant which had already
been conceded to the English clergy; and his letters to King often include requests for the
necessary papers by means of which he could lay the matter before either Godolphin or Somers.
Walls had written to Swift of the vacancy of the see of Waterford, and, from the reply to the
archdeacon, we learn that even at so early a date Swift suffered a grievous disappointment;
for in January, 1708, the bishopric, of which Swift had hopes, was presented to Dr. Thomas
Milles. In his letter to Walls Swift confesses that he "once had a glimpse that things would
have gone otherwise.... But let us talk no further on this subject. I am stomach-sick of it
already. ... Pray send me an account of some smaller vacancy in the Government's gift." It
was to Somers, and through him to Lord Halifax, that Swift looked for recognition, either for
services rendered, or because of their appreciation of his abilities. But, however much he
may have been disappointed at their inaction, it may not be argued, as it has been, that Swift's
so-called change in his political opinions was the outcome either of spleen or chagrin against
the Whigs for their ingratitude towards him. It is, indeed, questionable whether Swift ever
changed his political opinions, speaking of these as party opinions. From the day of his entrance,
it may be said, into the orders of the Church, his first thought was for it; and on all political
questions which touched Church matters Swift was neither Whig nor Tory, but churchman. It was
because of the attitude of the Whigs towards the Church that Swift left them; and in his writings
he does not spare the Tories even when he finds them taking up similar attitudes. On purely
political questions Swift was too independent a thinker to be influenced by mere party views.
That he wrote for the Tories must be put down to Harley's personal influence, and to his foresight
which saw in Swift a man who must be treated as an equal with the highest in the land. Swift's
intercourse with the leading men of his day only served to accentuate his consciousness of
his superiority; and a party which would permit him the free play of his powers would be the
party to which Swift would give his adhesion. Godolphin, Somers, and Walpole either did not
recognize the genius of the man, or their own "points of view" did not permit them to give
him the free play they felt he would obtain. Be that as it may, Harley gained not only a splendid
party fighter, but a friend on whose affection he could ever rely.

In these tracts on Religion and the Church, which he wrote in the year 1708, Swift is not a
party man, speaking for party purposes. He believed, and sincerely believed, that for such
beings as were the men and women of this kingdom, the Church was, if not the highest and noblest
instrument for good, yet the worthiest and ablest they had. Swift never lost himself in theories.
He was, however, not blind to the dangers which an established religion might engender; but
whatever its dangers, these would be inevitable to the most perfect system so long as human
nature was as base as it was. The "Argument" is written in a vein of satirical banter; but
the Swiftian cynicism permeates every line. It is the first of four tracts which form Swift's
most important expression of his thoughts on Religion and the Church. Scott well describes
it as "one of the most felicitous efforts in our language, to engage wit and humour on the
side of religion," and Forster speaks of it as "having also that indefinable subtlety of style
which conveys not the writer's knowledge of the subject only, but his power and superiority
over it."

I have not been able to find a copy of the original edition of the "Argument" upon which to
base the present text--for that I have gone to the first edition of the "Miscellanies," published
in 1711; but I have collated this with those given by the "Miscellanies" (1728), Faulkner,
Hawkesworth, Scott, Morley, and Craik.

[T. S.]

AN ARGUMENT AGAINST ABOLISHING CHRISTIANITY.

I am very sensible what a weakness and presumption it is, to reason against the general humour
and disposition of the world. I remember it was with great justice, and a due regard to the
freedom both of the public and the press, forbidden upon several penalties to write,[1] or
discourse, or lay wagers against the Union, even before it was confirmed by parliament, because
that was looked upon as a design, to oppose the current of the people, which, besides the folly
of it, is a manifest breach of the fundamental law that makes this majority of opinion the
voice of God. In like manner, and for the very same reasons, it may perhaps be neither safe
nor prudent to argue against the abolishing of Christianity, at a juncture when all parties
appear[2] so unanimously determined upon the point, as we cannot but allow from their actions,
their discourses, and their writings. However, I know not how, whether from the affectation
of singularity, or the perverseness of human nature, but so it unhappily falls out, that I
cannot be entirely of this opinion. Nay, though I were sure an order were issued for my immediate
prosecution by the Attorney-General, I should still confess that in the present posture of
our affairs at home or abroad, I do not yet see the absolute necessity of extirpating the Christian
religion from among us.

[Footnote 1: This refers to the Jacobitism of the time, particularly among those who were opposed
to the Union. A reference to Lord Mahon's "Reign of Queen Anne" will show how strong was the
opposition in Scotland, and how severe were the measures taken to put down that opposition. [T.S.]]

[Footnote 2: Craik and Hawkesworth print the word "seem," but the "Miscellanies," Faulkner,
and Scott give it as in the text. [T.S.]]

This perhaps may appear too great a paradox even for our wise and paradoxical age to endure;
therefore I shall handle it with all tenderness, and with the utmost deference to that great
and profound majority which is of another sentiment.

And yet the curious may please to observe, how much the genius of a nation is liable to alter
in half an age. I have heard it affirmed for certain by some very old people, that the contrary
opinion was even in their memories as much in vogue as the other is now; and, that a project
for the abolishing of Christianity would then have appeared as singular, and been thought as
absurd, as it would be at this time to write or discourse in its defence.

Therefore I freely own that all appearances are against me. The system of the Gospel, after
the fate of other systems is generally antiquated and exploded, and the mass or body of the
common people, among whom it seems to have had its latest credit, are now grown as much ashamed
of it as their betters; opinions, like fashions, always descending from those of quality to
the middle sort, and thence to the vulgar, where at length they are dropped and vanish.

But here I would not be mistaken, and must therefore be so bold as to borrow a distinction
from the writers on the other side, when they make a difference between nominal and real Trinitarians.

[Footnote 3: This proposal is embodied in the 16th Epode, where, in an appeal "to the Roman
people," Horace advises them to fly the evils of tyranny and civil war by sailing away to "the
happy land, those islands of the blest:"

  "Nos manet Oceanus circumvagus! arva, beata
  Petamus arva, divites et insulas!"

But why we should therefore cast off the name and title of Christians, although the general
opinion and resolution be so violent for it, I confess I cannot (with submission) apprehend
the consequence necessary.[4] However, since the undertakers propose such wonderful advantages
to the nation by this project, and advance many plausible objections against the system of
Christianity, I shall briefly consider the strength of both, fairly allow them their greatest
weight, and offer such answers as I think most reasonable. After which I will beg leave to
shew what inconveniences may possibly happen by such an innovation, in the present posture
of our affairs.

[Footnote 4: I give the reading of the "Miscellanies" (1711), Faulkner and Hawkesworth. Scott
and Craik print it: "I confess I cannot (with submission) apprehend, nor is the consequence
necessary." [T.S.]]

First, One great advantage proposed by the abolishing of Christianity is, that it would very
much enlarge and establish liberty of conscience, that great bulwark of our nation, and of
the Protestant Religion, which is still too much limited by priestcraft, notwithstanding all
the good intentions of the legislature, as we have lately found by a severe instance. For it
is confidently reported, that two young gentlemen of real hopes, bright wit, and profound judgment,
who upon a thorough examination of causes and effects, and by the mere force of natural abilities,
without the least tincture of learning, having made a discovery, that there was no God, and
generously communicating their thoughts for the good of the public, were some time ago, by
an unparalleled severity, and upon I know not what obsolete law, broke for blasphemy.[5] And
as it hath been wisely observed, if persecution once begins, no man alive knows how far it
may reach, or where it will end.

[Footnote 5: No record of this "breaking" has been discovered. [T.S.]]

In answer to all which, with deference to wiser judgments, I think this rather shews the necessity
of a nominal religion among us. It must be allowed indeed, that to break an English free-born
officer only for blasphemy, was, to speak the gentlest of such an action, a very high strain
of absolute power. Little can be said in excuse for the general; perhaps he was afraid it might
give offence to the allies, among whom, for aught we know, it may be the custom of the country
to believe a God. But if he argued, as some have done, upon a mistaken principle, that an officer
who is guilty of speaking blasphemy, may some time or other proceed so far as to raise a mutiny,
the consequence is by no means to be admitted; for, surely the commander of an English army
is likely to be but ill obeyed, whose soldiers fear and reverence him as little as they do a Deity.

[Footnote 6: Tacitus, "Annals," bk. i., c. lxxiii. [T.S.]]

It is further objected against the Gospel System, that it obliges men to the belief of things
too difficult for free-thinkers, and such who have shaken off the prejudices that usually cling
to a confined education. To which I answer, that men should be cautious how they raise objections
which reflect upon the wisdom of the nation. Is not every body freely allowed to believe whatever
he pleases, and to publish his belief to the world whenever he thinks fit, especially if it
serves to strengthen the party which is in the right? Would any indifferent foreigner, who
should read the trumpery lately written by Asgil, Tindal, Toland, Coward,[7] and forty more,
imagine the Gospel to be our rule of faith, and confirmed by parliaments? Does any man either
believe, or say he believes, or desire to have it thought that he says he believes one syllable
of the matter? And is any man worse received upon that score, or does he find his want of nominal
faith a disadvantage to him in the pursuit of any civil or military employment? What if there
be an old dormant statute or two against him, are they not now obsolete, to a degree, that
Empsom and Dudley[8] themselves if they were now alive, would find it impossible to put them
in execution?

[Footnote 7: John Asgill (1659-1738), became a member of Lincoln's Inn, and went over to Ireland
in 1697, where he practised as a barrister, amassed a large fortune, and was elected to the
Irish parliament. For writing "An Argument, proving that Man may be translated from hence without
passing through Death," he was, in 1700, expelled the House, and the book ordered to be burnt.
On returning to England he was elected to parliament for Bramber, but suffered a second expulsion
in 1712, also on account of this book. He was imprisoned for debt, and remained under the rules
of the Fleet and King's Bench for thirty years, during which time he wrote and published various
political tracts. His "Argument" attempted to "interpret the relations between God and man
by the technical rules of English law," and Coleridge thought no little of its power and style.

Matthew Tindal (1657-1733) was born at Beer Ferrers, in Devonshire. He studied at Oxford, and
obtained a fellowship in All Souls. He was made LL.D. in 1685, and, although he professed himself
a Roman Catholic in James II.'s reign, he managed to keep his fellowship after that monarch's
flight by becoming Protestant again. His most important work was "The Rights of the Christian
Church Asserted," which the House of Commons in 1710 adjudged fit for burning by the hangman.
In 1730 he published anonymously, the first part of "Christianity as Old as Creation," a work
which attacked strongly the authority of the Scriptures; a second volume was never published.

John Toland (1669-1722), born near Londonderry, and educated in a Catholic school. He professed
himself a Protestant, and was sent to Glasgow and Edinburgh. In the latter university he graduated
in his master's degree. While studying at Leyden he became a sceptic, and in 1695 published
his "Christianity not Mysterious," a work which aroused a wide controversy. In his "Life of
Milton" (1698) he denied that King Charles was the author of "Eikon Basilikae," and also attacked
the Gospels. This also brought upon him rejoinders from Dr. Blackall and Dr. Samuel Clarke.
He died at Putney, in easy circumstances, due to the presents made him while visiting German
courts. He wrote other works, chief among which may be mentioned, "Socinianism truly Stated"
(1705), "Nazarenas" (1718), and "Tetradymus." His "Posthumous Works" were issued in two volumes
in 1726, with a life by Des Maizeaux. Craik calls him "a man of utterly worthless character,"
and refers to his being "mixed up in some discreditable episodes as a political spy."

William Coward (1656?--1724?) was born at Winchester. He studied medicine and became a fellow
of Wadham College, Oxford. His "Second Thoughts concerning Human Souls," published in 1702,
occasioned fierce disputes, on account of its materialism. The House of Commons ordered the
work to be burnt by the hangman.

Asgill, Toland, Tindal, Collins, and Coward are classed as the Deistical writers of the eighteenth
century. In his "History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century" Mr. Leslie Stephen gives
an admirable exposition of their views, and their special interpretation of Locke's theories.
[T.S.]]

[Footnote 8: Of Henry VII. notoriety, who aided the king, by illegal exactions, to amass his
large fortune. They were executed by Henry VIII. This indeed appears to be a consideration
of some weight: But then, on the other side, several things deserve to be considered likewise:
As, first, whether it may not be thought necessary that in certain tracts of country, like
what we call parishes, there shall be one man at least of abilities to read and write. Then
it seems a wrong computation, that the revenues of the Church throughout this island would
be large enough to maintain two hundred young gentlemen, or even half that number, after the
present refined way of living; that is, to allow each of them such a rent, as in the modern
form of speech, would make them easy. But still there is in this project a greater mischief
behind; and we ought to beware of the woman's folly, who killed the hen that every morning
laid her a golden egg. For, pray what would become of the race of men in the next age, if we
had nothing to trust to beside the scrofulous, consumptive productions, furnished by our men
of wit and pleasure, when, having squandered away their vigour, health and estates, they are
forced by some disagreeable marriage to piece up their broken fortunes, and entail rottenness
and politeness on their posterity? Now, here are ten thousand persons reduced by the wise regulations
of Henry the Eighth,[9] to the necessity of a low diet, and moderate exercise, who are the
only great restorers of our breed, without which the nation would in an age or two become one
great hospital.

[Footnote 9: His seizures of the revenues of the Church. Can there be a more convenient season
for taking a dose of physic? Are fewer claps got upon Sundays than other days? Where are more
appointments and rendezvouzes of gallantry? And where so many conveniences or enticements to sleep?

[Footnote 10: The chocolate houses seem to have been largely used for gambling purposes. They
were not so numerous as the coffee houses. [T.S.]]

There is one advantage greater than any of the foregoing, proposed by the abolishing of Christianity:
that it will utterly extinguish parties among us, by removing those factious distinctions of
High and Low Church, of Whig and Tory, Presbyterian and Church of England, which are now so
many mutual clogs upon public proceedings, and are apt to prefer the gratifying themselves,
or depressing their adversaries, before the most important interest of the state.

I confess, if it were certain that so great an advantage would redound to the nation by this
expedient, I would submit and be silent: But will any man say, that if the words whoring, drinking,
cheating, lying, stealing, were by act of parliament ejected out of the English tongue and
dictionaries, we should all awake next morning chaste and temperate, honest and just, and lovers
of truth? Is this a fair consequence? Or, if the physicians would forbid us to pronounce the
words pox, gout, rheumatism and stone, would that expedient serve like so many talismans to
destroy the diseases themselves? Are party and faction rooted in men's hearts no deeper than
phrases borrowed from religion, or founded upon no firmer principles? And is our language so
poor that we cannot find other terms to express them? Are envy, pride, avarice and ambition
such ill nomenclators, that they cannot furnish appellations for their owners? Will not heydukes
and mamalukes, mandarins and patshaws, or any other words formed at pleasure, serve to distinguish
those who are in the ministry from others who would be in it if they could? What, for instance,
is easier than to vary the form of speech, and instead of the word church, make it a question
in politics, whether the Monument be in danger? Because religion was nearest at hand to furnish
a few convenient phrases, is our invention so barren, we can find no other? Suppose, for argument
sake, that the Tories favoured Margarita, the Whigs Mrs. Tofts,[11] and the Trimmers[12] Valentini,[13]
would not Margaritians, Toftians, and Valentinians be very tolerable marks of distinction?
The Prasini and Veniti,[14] two most virulent factions in Italy, began (if I remember right)
by a distinction of colours in ribbons, which we might do with as good a grace[15] about the
dignity of the blue and the green, and would serve as properly to divide the Court, the Parliament,
and the Kingdom between them, as any terms of art whatsoever, borrowed from religion. And therefore
I think, there is little force in this objection against Christianity, or prospect of so great
an advantage as is proposed in the abolishing of it.

[Footnote 11: Margarita was a famous Italian singer of the day. Her name was Francesca Margherita
de l'Epine, and she was known as "the Italian woman." In his "Journal to Stella" for August
6th, 1711, Swift writes: "We have a music meeting in our town [Windsor] to-night. (See present
edition, vol. ii. p. 219).

Mrs. Catherine Tofts was an Englishwoman, who also sang in Italian opera. She had a fine figure
and a beautiful voice. Steele in the "Tatler," No. 20, refers to her when in her state of insanity.
Her mind, evidently, could not stand the strain of her great popularity, and she became mad
in 1709. In the "Tatler" she is called Camilla; and Cibber also speaks of the "silver tone
of her voice." [T.S.]]

[Footnote 12: By the Trimmers Swift referred to the nickname given to the party in the time
of Charles II., which consisted of those who wished to compromise between the advocates of
the Crown and the supporters of the Protestant succession as against the Duke of York. [T.S.]]

[Footnote 13: Another Italian singer of the time, who was the rival of Margarita and Mrs. Tofts.
[T.S.]]

[Footnote 14: This refers to the Roman chariot races. They gave rise to the factions called
Albati, Russati, Prasini, and Veniti. The Prasini (green) and Veniti (blue) were the principal,
and their rivalry landed the empire, under Justinian, in a civil war. [T.S.]]
