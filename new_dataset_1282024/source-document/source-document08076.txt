PREFATORY NOTE

As a means of collecting material for this book I have sent to many artists in Great Britain
and in various countries of Europe, as well as in the United States, a circular, asking where
their studies were made, what honors they have received, the titles of their principal works, etc.

I take this opportunity to thank those who have cordially replied to my questions, many of
whom have given me fuller information than I should have presumed to ask; thus assuring correctness
in my statements, which newspaper and magazine notices of artists and their works sometimes
fail to do.

I wish especially to acknowledge the courtesy of those who have given me photographs of their
pictures and sculpture, to be used as illustrations.

INTRODUCTION

In studying the subject of this book I have found the names of more than a thousand women whose
attainments in the Fine Arts--in various countries and at different periods of time before
the middle of the nineteenth century--entitle them to honorable mention as artists, and I doubt
not that an exhaustive search would largely increase this number. The stories of many of these
women have been written with more or less detail, while of others we know little more than
their names and the titles of a few of their works; but even our scanty knowledge of them is
of value.
