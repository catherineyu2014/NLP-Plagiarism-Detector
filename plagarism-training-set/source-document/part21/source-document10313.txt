The purpose of the series was to provide individual readers of history, and the libraries of
schools and colleges, with a comprehensive and well-rounded collection of those classical narratives
on which the early history of the United States is founded, or of those narratives which, if
not precisely classical, hold the most important place as sources of American history anterior
to 1700. The reasons for undertaking such a project are for the most part obvious. No modern
history, however excellent, can give the reader all that he can get from the ipsissima verba
of the first narrators, Argonauts or eyewitnesses, vivacious explorers or captains courageous.
There are many cases in which secondary narrators have quite hidden from view these first authorities,
whom it is therefore a duty to restore to their rightful position. In a still greater number
of instances, the primitive narrations have become so scarce and expensive that no ordinary
library can hope to possess anything like a complete set of the classics of early American history.

The series is to consist of such volumes as will illustrate the early history of all the chief
parts of the country, with an additional volume of general index. The plan contemplates, not
a body of extracts, but in general the publication or republication of whole works or distinct
parts of works. In the case of narratives originally issued in some other language than English,
the best available translations will be used, or fresh versions made. In a few instances, important
narratives hitherto unprinted will be inserted. The English texts will be taken from the earliest
editions, or those having the highest historical value, and will be reproduced with literal
exactness. The maps will be such as will give real help toward understanding the events narrated
in the volume. The special editors of the individual works will supply introductions, setting
forth briefly the author's career and opportunities, when known, the status of the work in
the literature of American history, and its value as a source, and indicating previous editions;
and they will furnish such annotations, scholarly but simple, as will enable the intelligent
reader to understand and to estimate rightly the statements of the text. The effort has been
made to secure for each text the most competent editor.

The results of all these endeavors will be laid before the public in the confident hope that
they will be widely useful in making more real and more vivid the apprehension of early American
history. The general editor would not have undertaken the serious labors of preparation and
supervision if he had not felt sure that it was a genuine benefit to American historical knowledge
and American patriotism to make accessible, in one collection, so large a body of pioneer narrative.
No subsequent sources can have quite the intellectual interest, none quite the sentimental
value, which attaches to these early narrations, springing direct from the brains and hearts
of the nation's founders.
