Similar remarks evidently apply to Horrocks and Crabtree (1641); for although both were natives
of Lancashire, and the latter a resident in the vicinity of Manchester, their early death would
prevent the exertion of any considerable influence; nor does it appear that they ever paid
any attention to the study of the ancient geometry. Richard Towneley, Esq., of Towneley (1671),
is known to have been an ardent cultivator of science, but his residence was principally in
London. It may, however, be mentioned to his honour, that he was the first to discover what
is usually known as "Marriotte's Law" for the expansion of gases. At a later period (1728-1763),
the name of "John Hampson, of Leigh, in Lancashire," appears as a correspondent to the Lady's
Diary; but since he mostly confined his speculations to subjects relating to the Diophantine
Analysis, he cannot be considered as the originator of the revival in that branch of study
now under consideration. Such being the case, we are led to conclude that the "Oldham Mathematical
Society" was really the great promoter of the study of the ancient geometry in Lancashire;
for during the latter half of the last century, and almost up to the present date, it has numbered
amongst its members several of the most distinguished geometers of modern times. A cursory
glance at some of the mathematical periodicals of that date will readily furnish the names
of Ainsworth, whose elegant productions in pure geometry adorn the pages of the Gentleman's
and Burrow's Diaries; Taylor, the distinguished tutor of Wolfenden; Fletcher, whose investigations
in the Gentleman's Diary and the Mathematical Companion entitle him to the highest praise;
Wolfenden, acknowledged by all as one of the most profound mathematicians of the last century;
Hilton, afterwards the talented editor of that "work of rare merit" the Liverpool Student;
and last, though not least, the distinguished Butterworth, whose elegant and extensive correspondence
occupies so conspicuous a place in the Student, the Mathematical Repository, the Companion,
the Enquirer, the Leeds Correspondent, and the York Courant. Besides these, we find the names
of Mabbot, Wood, Holt (Mancuniensis), Clarke (Salfordoniiensis), as then resident at Manchester
and in constant communication with, if not actually members of the society; nor can it be doubted
from the evidence of existing documents that the predilection for the study of the ancient
geometry evinced by various members of this Lancashire School, exercised considerable influence
upon the minds of such distinguished proficients as Cunliffe, Campbell, Lowry, Whitley, and Swale.

Hence it would seem that many, and by no means improbable, reasons may be assigned for "the
very remarkable circumstance of the geometrical analysis of the ancients having been cultivated
with eminent success in the northern counties of England, and particularly in Lancashire."
Mr. Harvey, at the York meeting of the British Association in 1831, eloquently announced "that
when Playfair, in one of his admirable papers in the Edinburgh Review, expressed a fear that
the increasing taste for analytical science would at length drive the {58} ancient geometry
from its favoured retreat in the British Isles; the Professor seemed not to be aware that there
existed a devoted band of men in the north, resolutely bound to the pure and ancient forms
of geometry, who in the midst of the tumult of steam engines, cultivated it with unyielding
ardour, preserving the sacred fire under circumstances which would seem from their nature most
calculated to extinguish it." Mr.
