When we approached near to Fascally, near the junction of the Garry with the Tummel, the twilight
was far advanced, and our horse not being perfectly recovered, we were fearful of taking him
on to Blair-Athole—five miles further; besides, the Pass of Killicrankie was within half a
mile, and we were unwilling to go through a place so celebrated in the dark; therefore, being
joined by a traveller, we inquired if there was any public-house near; he said there was; and
that though the accommodations were not good, we might do well enough for one night, the host
and his wife being very honest people.  It proved to be rather better than a common cottage
of the country; we seated ourselves by the fire, William called for a glass of whisky, and
asked if they could give us beds.  The woman positively refused to lodge us, though we had
every reason to believe that she had at least one bed for me; we entreated again and again
in behalf of the poor horse, but all in vain; she urged, though in an uncivil way, that she
had been sitting up the whole of one or two nights before on account of a fair, and that now
she wanted to go to bed and sleep; so we were obliged to remount our car in the dark, and with
a tired horse we moved on, and went through the Pass of Killicrankie, hearing only the roaring
of the river, and seeing a black chasm with jagged-topped black hills towering above.  Afterwards
the moon rose, and we should not have had an unpleasant ride if our horse had been in better
plight, and we had not been annoyed, as we were almost at every twenty yards, by people coming
from a fair held that day near Blair—no pleasant prognostic of what might be our accommodation
at the inn, where we arrived between ten and eleven o’clock, and found the house in an uproar;
but we were civilly treated, and were glad, after eating a morsel of cold beef, to retire to
rest, and I fell asleep in spite of the noisy drunkards below stairs, who had outstayed the fair.

Wednesday, September 7th.—Rose early, and went before breakfast to the Duke of Athol’s gardens
and pleasure-grounds, where we completely tired ourselves with a three-hours’ walk.  Having
been directed to see all the waterfalls, we submitted ourselves to the gardener, who dragged
us from place to place, calling our attention to, it might be, half-a-dozen—I cannot say how
many—dripping streams, very pretty in themselves, if we had had the pleasure of discovering
them; but they were generally robbed of their grace by the obtrusive ornaments which were first
seen.  The whole neighbourhood, a great country, seems to belong to the Duke of Athol.  In
his domain are hills and mountains, glens and spacious plains, rivers and innumerable torrents;
but near Blair are no old woods, and the plantations, except those at a little distance from
the house, appear inconsiderable, being lost to the eye in so extensive a circuit.
