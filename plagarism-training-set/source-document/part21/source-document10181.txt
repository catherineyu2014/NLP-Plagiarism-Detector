In reply to the query of the Rev. Dr. Maitland (No. 17. p. 261.), I
would remark, that Salting was the ceremony of initiating a freshman
into the company of senior students or sophisters. This appears very
clearly from a passage in the Life of Anthony a Wood (ed. 1771, pp.
45-50.). Anthony a Wood was matriculated in the University of Oxford,
26th May, 1647, and on the 18th of October "he was entered into the
Buttery-Book of Merton College." At various periods, from All Saints
till Candlemas, "there were Fires of Charcole made in the Common hall." On Candlemas day, or before (according as
    Shrove Tuesday fell out), every Freshman had warning given him
    to provide his Speech, to be spoken in the publick Hall before
    the Under-Graduats and Servants on Shrove-Tuesday night that
    followed, being alwaies the time for the observation of that
    Ceremony. According to the said Summons A. Wood provided a
    Speech as the other Freshmen did.

    "Shrove Tuesday Feb. 15, the Fire being made in the Common hall
    before 5 of the Clock at night, the Fellowes would go to Supper
    before six, and making an end sooner than at other times, they
    left the Hall to the Libertie of the Undergraduats, but with an
    Admonition from one of the Fellowes (who was the Principall of
    the Undergraduats and Postmasters) that all things should be
    carried in good Order. While they were at Supper in the Hall,
    the Cook (Will. Noble) was making the lesser of the brass pots
    full of Cawdle at the Freshmens Charge; which, after the Hall
    was free from the Fellows, was brought up and set before the
    Fire in the said Hall.

Mr. Wood gives part of his speech, which is ridiculous enough. It appears that it was so satisfactory
that he had cawdle and sack without and salted drink.

The editors in a note intimate that it was probable the custom was not peculiar to Merton College,
and that it was perhaps once general, as striking traces of it might be found in many societies
in Oxford, and in some a very near resemblance of it had been kept up until within a few years
of that time (1772).

C.H. COOPER.

Cambridge, Feb. 23. 1850.

"E.V.," after quoting the passage given by Mr. Cooper from Anthony Wood, proceeds:--

It is clear from Owen's epigram that there was some kind of salting at Oxford as well as at
Cambridge; is it not at least probable that they were both identical with the custom described
by old Anthony, and that the charge made in the college book was for the cawdle mentioned above,
as provided at the freshman's expense; the whole ceremony going under the name of "salting,"
from the salt and water potion, which was the most important constituent of it? If this be
so, it agrees with Dr. Maitland's idea, that "this 'salting' was some entertainment given by
the newcomer, from and after which he ceases to be fresh;" or, as Wood expresses it, "he took
his place among the seniors."

The "tucks" he speaks of could have been no very agreeable addition to the salted beer; for,
as he himself explains it, a few lines above, "to tuck" consisted in "setting the nail of the
thumb to their chin, just under the lip, and by the help of their other fingers under the chin,
they would give him a mark, which sometimes would produce blood."

Before I leave Anthony Wood, let me mention {307} that I find him making use of the word "bull"
in the sense of a laughable speech ("to make a jest, or bull, or speake some eloquent nonsense,"
p. 34.), and of the now vulgar expression "to go to pot." When recounting the particulars of
the parliamentary visitation of the University in 1648, he tells us, that had it not been for
the intercession of his mother to Sir Nathan Brent, "he had infallible gone to the pot." If
Dr. Maitland or any of your readers can give the history of these expressions, and can produce
earlier instances of their use, they would greatly oblige me.

P.S. I ought to mention, that "Penniless Bench" was a seat for loungers, under a wooden canopy,
at the east end of old Carfax Church: it seems to have been notorious as "the idle corner"
of Oxford.

QUERIES ANSWERED, NO. 5.

A comparative statement of the number of those who ask questions, and those who furnish replies,
would be a novel contribution to the statistics of literature. I do note mean to undertake
it, but shall so far assume an excess on the side of the former class, as to attempt a triad
of replies to recent queries without fear of the censures which attach to monopoly.

To facilitate reference to the queries, I take them in the order of publication:--

1. "What is the earliest known instance of the use of a beaver hat in England?"--T. Hudson
Turner, p. 100.

The following instance from Chaucer (Canterbury tales, 1775, 8°. v. 272.), if not the earliest,
is precise and instructive:

  "A marchant was ther with a forked berd,
  In mottelee, and highe on hors he sat,
  And on his hed a Flaundrish bever hat."

2. "Has Cosmopoli been ever appropriated to any known locality?"--John Jebb, p. 213.

Cosmopolis has been used for London, and for Paris (G. Peignot, Répertoire de bibliographies
spéciales, Paris, 1810. 8°. pp. 116, 132.) It may also, in accordance with its etymology, be
used for Amsterdam, or Berlin, or Calcutta, etc. As an imprint, it takes the dative case. The
Interpretationes paradoxæ quatuor evangeliorum of Sandius, were printed at Amsterdam. (M. Weiss,
Biographie universelle, Paris, 1811 28. 8°. xl. 312.)

3. References to "any works or treatises supplying information on the history of the Arabic
numerals" are requested by "E.N." p. 230.

To the well chosen works enumberated by the querist, I shall add the titles of two valuable
publications in my own collection:

DICTIONNAIRE RAISONNÉ DE DIPLOMATIQUE--par dom de Vaines. Paris, 1774. 8°. 2 vol.

ELÉMENTS DE PALÉOGRAPHIE, par M. Natalis de Wailly. Paris, Imprimerie royale, 1838. 4°. 2 vol.

The former work is a convenient epitome of the Nouveau traité de diplomatique. The latter is
a new compilation, undertaken with the sanction of M. Guizot. Its appearance was thus hailed
by the learned Daunou: "Cet ouvrage nous semble recommandable par l'exactitude des recherches,
par la distribution méthodique des matières et par l'élégante précision du style." (Journal
des savants, Paris, 1838. 4°. p. 328.)

A query should always be worded with care, and put in a quotable shape. The observance of this
plain rule would economise space, save the time which might otherwise be occupied in useless
research, and tend to produce more pertinency of reply. The first and second of the above queries
may serve as models.

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.

Old Auster Tenement (No. 14. p. 217.).--I think that I am in a condition to throw some light
on the meaning of this expression, noticed in a former Number by "W.P.P." The tenements held
in villenage of the lord of a manor, at least where they consisted of a messuage or dwelling-house,
are often called astra in our older books and court-rolls. If the tenement was an ancient one,
it was vetus or antiquum astrum; if a tenure of recent creation (or a new-take, as it is called
in some manors), it was novum astrum. The villenage tenant of it was an astrarius. "W.P.P."
may satisfy himself of these facts by referring to the printed Plautorum Abbrevietis, fo. 282.;
to Fleta, Comment. Juris. Anglicani, ed. 1685, p. 217.; and to Ducange, Spelman, and Cowel,
under the words "Astrum," "Astrarius," and "Astre." In the very locality to which "W.P.P."
refers, he will find that the word "Auster" is "Astrum" in the oldest court-rolls, and that
the term is not confined to North Curry, but is very prevalent in the eastern half of Somerset.
At the present day, an auster tenement is a species of copyhold, with all the incidents to
that tenure. It is noticed in the Journal of the Archæological Institute, in a recent critique
on Dr. Evans's Leicestershire words, and is very familar to legal practitioners of any experience
in the district alluded to.

E. Smirke.

Tureen (No. 16. p. 246.).--There is properly no such word. It is a corruption of the French
terrine, an earthen vessel in which soup is served. It is in Bailey's Dictionary. I take this
opportunity of suggesting whether that the word "swinging," applied by Goldsmith to his tureen,
should be rather spelt swingeing; though the former is the more usual way: a swinging dish
and a swingeing are different things, and Goldsmith meant the latter.

The Carthaginians most probably received the custom from their ancestors the Phoenicians, but
where did the Americans get it?

Henry St. Chad.

Corpus Christi Hall, Maidstone, Feb. 8. 1850.

Burning the Dead.--Your correspondent "T." (No. 14. p. 216.) can hardly have overlooked the
case of Dido, in his inquiry "whether the practice of burning the dead has ever been in vogue
amongst any people, excepting the inhabitants of Europe and Asia?" According to all classical
authorities, Dido was founder and queen of Carthage in Africa, and was burned at Carthage on
a funeral pile.

If it be said that Dido's corpse underwent burning in conformity with the custom of her native
country Tyre, and not because it obtained in the land of her adoption, then the question arises,
whether burning the dead was not one of the customs which the Tyrian colony of Dido imported
into Africa, and became permanently established at Carthage. It is very certain that the Carthaginians
had human sacrifices by fire, and that they burned their children in the furnace to Saturn.

MISCELLANIES.

M. de Gournay.--The author of the axioms Laissez faire, laissez passer, which are the sum and
substance of the free trade principles of political economy, and perhaps the pithiest and completest
exposition of the doctrine of a particular school ever made, was Jean Claude Marie Vincent
de Gournay, who was born at St. Malo in 1712, and died at Paris in 1759. In early life he was
engaged in trade, and subsequently became Honorary Councillor of the Grand Council, and Honorary
Intendant of Commerce. He translated, in 1742, Josiah Child's Considerations on Commerce and
on the Interest on Money, and Culpepper's treatise Against Usury. He also wrote a good deal
on questions of political economy. He was, in fact, with Dr. Quesnay, the chief of the French
economists of the last century; but he was more liberal than Quesnay in his doctrines; indeed
he is (far more than Adam Smith) the virtual founder of the modern school of political economy;
and yet, perhaps, of all the economists he is the least known!

The great Turgot was a friend and ardent admirer of M. de Gournay; and on his death wrote a
pompous Eloge on him.

A Man in a Garret.

Cupid Crying.--"Our readers will remember that some time since (antè, p. 108.) we copied into
our columns, from the 'Notes and Queries,' an epigram of great elegance on the subject of 'Cupid
Crying;' the contributor of which was desirous of finding through that medium, especially established
for such discoveries, the original text and the name of its author. Subsequently, a correspondent
of our own [antè, p. 132.] volunteered a translation by himself, in default of the original.
The correspondent of the 'Notes and Queries' has now stumbled on what he sought, and is desirous
that we should transmit it to the author of the volunteer version, with his thanks. This we
take the present means of doing. Under the signature of 'Rufus,' he writes as follows:--'In
a MS. book, long missing, I find the following copy, with a reference to Car. Illust. Poet.

"Since printing this communication from 'Rufus' we have received the same original (with the
variation of a single word--quid for cur in the opening of the epigram) from a German correspondent
at Augsburgh. 'You will find it,' he says, 'in the Anthologia Latina Burmanniana, iii. 236,
or in the new edition of this Latin Anthology, by Henry Meyer, Lipsiæ, 1835, tom. ii. page
139, No. 1566. The author of the epigram is doubtful, but the diction appears rather too quaint
for a good ancient writer. Maffei ascribes it to Brenzoni, who lived in the sixteenth century;
others give it to Ant. Tebaldeo, of Ferrara.' Our readers will perceive that the translator
has taken some liberties with his text. 'Lumine formæ deceptus,' for instance, is not translated
by 'she smiled.' But it may be questioned if the suggestion is not even more delicate and graceful
in the translator's version than in the original."--The Athenæum.

THE MIRROR.

  (From the Latin of Owen.)

  Bella, your image just returns your smile--
    You weep, and tears its lovely cheek bedew--
  You sleep, and its bright eyes are closed the while--
    You rise, the faithful mimic rises too.--
  Bella, what art such likeness could increase
  If glass could talk, or woman hold her peace?

Journeyman.--Three or four years since, a paragraph went the round of the press, deriving the
English word "journeyman" from the custom of travelling among work-men in Germany. This derivation
is very doubtful. Is it not a relic of Norman rule, from the French journée, signifying a day-man?
In support of this it may be observed, that the German name for the word in question if Tagelöhner,
or day-worker. It is also well known, that down to a comparatively recent period, artisans
and free labourers were paid daily.

Gomer.

Balloons.--In one of your early numbers you mention the History of Ringwood, &c. Many years
since I sent to a periodical (I cannot recollect which) a circumstance connected with that
town, which I never heard or read of anywhere, and which, as it is rather of importance, I
forward to you in hopes that some of your correspondents may be able to throw some light upon
it. When my father was in the Artillery Ground at the ascension of Lunardi's balloon, he remarked
to several persons present, "This is no novelty to me; I remember well, when I was at school
in Ringwood [about the year 1757], an apothecary in that town that used to let off balloons
(he had no other name, I suppose, to give them) on a smaller scale, but exactly corresponding
with what he then saw, many a time."

I had several letters addressed to me, requesting further explanation, which, as my father
was dead, I was unable to give. It is highly improbable that any persons now living may have
it in their power to corroborate the fact, but some of their relations or descendants may.
I suppose they must have been fire-balloons, and these of the rudest construction; and my father,
being a boy at the time, would have given perhaps little valuable information, except as to
the name of the apothecary, which, however, I never heard him mention.
