CHAPTER I.

THE INTRODUCTION.

I did not go to Rome to seek for condemnatory matter against the Pope's government. Had this
been my only object, I should not have deemed it necessary to undertake so long a journey.
I could have found materials on which to construct a charge in but too great abundance nearer
home. The cry of the Papal States had waxed great, and there was no need to go down into those
unhappy regions to satisfy one's self that the oppression was "altogether according to the
cry of it." I had other objects to serve by my journey.

There is one other country which has still more deeply influenced the condition of the race,
and towards which one is even more powerfully drawn, namely, Judea. But Italy is entitled to
the next place, as respects the desire which one must naturally feel to visit it, and the instruction
one may expect to reap from so doing. Some of the greatest minds which the pagan world has
produced have appeared in Italy. In that land those events were accomplished which have given
to modern history its form and colour; and those ideas elaborated, the impress of which may
still be traced upon the opinions, the institutions, and the creeds of Europe. In Italy, too,
empire has left her ineffaceable traces, and art her glorious footsteps. There is, all will
admit, a peculiar and exquisite pleasure in visiting such spots: nor is there pleasure only,
but profit also. One's taste may be corrected, and his judgment strengthened, by seeing the
masterpieces of ancient genius. New trains of thought may be suggested, and new sources of
information opened, by the sight of men and of manners wholly new. But more than this,--I believed
that there were lessons to be learned there, which it was emphatically worth one's while going
there to learn, touching the working of that politico-religious system of which Italy has so
long been the seat and centre. I had previously been at some little pains to make myself acquainted
with this system in its principles, and wished to have an opportunity of studying it in its
effects upon the government of the country, and the condition of the people, as respects their
trade, industry, knowledge, liberty, religion, and general happiness. All I shall say in the
following pages will have a bearing, more or less direct, upon this main point.
