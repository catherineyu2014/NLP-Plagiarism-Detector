We are looking now at the close of the era which geologists call Archean, because it is ancient
beyond knowledge. A few of its rocks are known, but not well enough for many definite conclusions.
All the earth's vast mysterious past is lumped under this title.

The definite history of the earth begins with the close of the dim Archean era. It is the lapse
from then till now, a few hundred million years at most out of all infinity, which ever can
greatly concern man, for during this time were laid the only rocks whose reading was assisted
by the presence of fossils. During this time the continents attained their final shape, the
mountains rose, and valleys, plains, and rivers formed and re-formed many times before assuming
the passing forms which they now show. During this time also life evolved from its inferred
beginnings in the late Archean to the complicated, finely developed, and in man's case highly
mentalized and spiritualized organization of To-day.

Surely the geologist's field of labor is replete with interest, inspiration, even romance.
But because it has become so saturated with technicality as to become almost a popular bugaboo,
let us attempt no special study, but rather cull from its voluminous records those simple facts
and perspectives which will reveal to us this greatest of all story books, our old earth, as
the volume of enchantment that it really is.

With the passing of the Archean, the earth had not yet settled into the perfectly balanced
sphere which Nature destined it to be. In some places the rock was more compactly squeezed
than in others, and these denser masses eventually were forced violently into neighbor masses
which were not so tightly squeezed. These movements far below the surface shifted the surface
balance and became one of many complicated and little known causes impelling the crust here
to slowly rise and there to slowly fall. Thus in places sea bottoms lifted above the surface
and became land, while lands elsewhere settled and became seas. There are areas which have
alternated many times between land and sea; this is why we find limestones which were formed
in the sea overlying shales which were formed in fresh water, which in turn overlie sandstones
which once were beaches--all these now in plateaus thousands of feet above the ocean's level.

Sometimes these mysterious internal forces lifted the surface in long waves. Thus mountain
chains and mountain systems were created. Often their summits, worn down by frosts and rains,
disclose the core of rock which, ages before, then hot and fluid, had underlain the crust and
bent it upward into mountain form. Now, cold and hard, these masses are disclosed as the granite
of to-day's landscape, or as other igneous rocks of earth's interior which now cover broad
surface areas, mingled with the stratified or water-made rocks which the surface only produces.
But this has not always been the fate of the under-surface molten rocks, for sometimes they
have burst by volcanic vents clear through the crust of earth, where, turned instantly to pumice
and lava by release from pressure, they build great surface cones, cover broad plains and fill
basins and valleys.

Thus were created the three great divisions of the rocks which form the three great divisions
of scenery, the sediments, the granites, and the lavas.

During these changes in the levels of enormous surface areas, the frosts and water have been
industriously working down the elevations of the land. Nature forever seeks a level. The snows
of winter, melting at midday, sink into the rocks' minutest cracks. Expanded by the frosts,
the imprisoned water pries open and chips the surface. The rains of spring and summer wash
the chippings and other débris into rivulets, which carry them into mountain torrents, which
rush them into rivers, which sweep them into oceans, which deposit them for the upbuilding
of the bottoms. Always the level! Thousands of square miles of California were built up from
ocean's bottom with sediments chiselled from the mountains of Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah,
and swept seaward through the Grand Canyon.

These mills grind without rest or pause. The atmosphere gathers the moisture from the sea,
the winds roll it in clouds to the land, the mountains catch and chill the clouds, and the
resulting rains hurry back to the sea in rivers bearing heavy freights of soil. Spring, summer,
autumn, winter, day and night, the mills of Nature labor unceasingly to produce her level.
If ever this earth is really finished to Nature's liking, it will be as round and polished
as a billiard ball.

Years mean nothing in the computation of the prehistoric past. Who can conceive a thousand
centuries, to say nothing of a million years? Yet either is inconsiderable against the total
lapse of time even from the Archean's close till now.

And so geologists have devised an easier method of count, measured not by units of time, but
by what each phase of progress has accomplished. This measure is set forth in the accompanying
table, together with a conjecture concerning the lapse of time in terms of years.

The most illuminating accomplishment of the table, however, is its bird's-eye view of the procession
of the evolution of life from the first inference of its existence to its climax of to-day;
and, concurrent with this progress, its suggestion of the growth and development of scenic
America. It is, in effect, the table of contents of a volume whose thrilling text and stupendous
illustration are engraved immortally in the rocks; a volume whose ultimate secrets the scholarship
of all time perhaps will never fully decipher, but whose dramatic outlines and many of whose
most thrilling incidents are open to all at the expense of a little study at home and a little
thoughtful seeing in the places where the facts are pictured in lines so big and graphic that
none may miss their meanings.

Man's colossal egotism is rudely shaken before the Procession of the Ages. Aghast, he discovers
that the billions of years which have wrought this earth from star dust were not merely God's
laborious preparation of a habitation fit for so admirable an occupant; that man, on the contrary,
is nothing more or less than the present master tenant of earth, the highest type of hundreds
of millions of years of succeeding tenants only because he is the latest in evolution.

Who can safely declare that the day will not come when a new Yellowstone, hurled from reopened
volcanoes, shall found itself upon the buried ruin of the present Yellowstone; when the present
Sierra shall have disappeared into the Pacific and the deserts of the Great Basin become the
gardens of the hemisphere; when a new Rocky Mountain system shall have grown upon the eroded
and dissipated granites of the present; when shallow seas shall join anew Hudson Bay with the
Gulf of Mexico; when a new and lofty Appalachian Range shall replace the rounded summits of
to-day; when a race of beings as superior to man, intellectually and spiritually, as man is
superior to the ape, shall endeavor to reconstruct a picture of man from the occasional remnants
which floods may wash into view?

     NOTE EXPLANATORY OF THE ESTIMATE OF GEOLOGIC TIME IN THE TABLE ON
     THE OPPOSITE PAGE

     The general assumption of modern geologists is that a hundred
     million years have elapsed since the close of the Archean period;
     at least this is a round number, convenient for thinking and
     discussion. The recent tendency has been greatly to increase
     conceptions of geologic time over the highly conservative estimates
     of a few years ago, and a strong disposition is shown to regard the
     Algonkian period as one of very great length, extremists even
     suggesting that it may have equalled all time since. For the
     purposes of this popular book, then, let us conceive that the earth
     has existed for a hundred million years since Archean times, and
     that one-third of this was Algonkian; and let us apportion the
     two-thirds remaining among succeeding eras in the average of the
     proportions adopted by Professor Joseph Barrell of Yale University,
     whose recent speculations upon geologic time have attracted wide
     attention.

Fantastic, you may say. It is fantastic. So far as I know there exists not one fact upon which
definite predictions such as these may be based. But also there exists not one fact which warrants
specific denial of predictions such as these. And if any inference whatever may be made from
earth's history it is the inevitable inference that the period in which man lives is merely
one step in an evolution of matter, mind and spirit which looks forward to changes as mighty
or mightier than those I have suggested.

With so inspiring an outline, the study to which I invite you can be nothing but pleasurable.
Space does not permit the development of the theme in the pages which follow, but the book
will have failed if it does not, incidental to its main purposes, entangle the reader in the
charm of America's adventurous past.

THE NATIONAL PARKS OF THE UNITED STATES

The National Parks of the United States are areas of supreme scenic splendor or other unique
quality which Congress has set apart for the pleasure and benefit of the people. At this writing
they number eighteen, sixteen of which lie within the boundaries of the United States and are
reached by rail and road. Those of greater importance have excellent roads, good trails, and
hotels or hotel camps, or both, for the accommodation of visitors; also public camp grounds
where visitors may pitch their own tents. Outside the United States there are two national
parks, one enclosing three celebrated volcanic craters, the other conserving the loftiest mountain
on the continent.

I

The starting point for any consideration of our national parks necessarily is the recently
realized fact of their supremacy in world scenery. It was the sensational force of this realization
which intensely attracted public attention at the outset of the new movement; many thousands
hastened to see these wonders, and their reports spread the tidings throughout the land and
gave the movement its increasing impetus.

The simple facts are these:

The Swiss Alps, except for several unmatchable individual features, are excelled in beauty,
sublimity and variety by several of our own national parks, and these same parks possess other
distinguished individual features unrepresented in kind or splendor in the Alps.

The Canadian Rockies are more than matched in rich coloring by our Glacier National Park. Glacier
is the Canadian Rockies done in Grand Canyon colors. It has no peer.

The Yellowstone outranks by far any similar volcanic area in the world. It contains more and
greater geysers than all the rest of the world together; the next in rank are divided between
Iceland and New Zealand. Its famous canyon is alone of its quality of beauty. Except for portions
of the African jungle, the Yellowstone is probably the most populated wild animal area in the
world, and its wild animals are comparatively fearless, even sometimes friendly.

Mount Rainier has a single-peak glacier system whose equal has not yet been discovered. Twenty-eight
living glaciers, some of them very large, spread, octopus-like, from its centre. It is four
hours by rail or motor from Tacoma.

Crater Lake is the deepest and bluest accessible lake in the world, occupying the hole left
after one of our largest volcanoes had slipped back into earth's interior through its own rim.

Yosemite possesses a valley whose compelling beauty the world acknowledges as supreme. The
valley is the centre of eleven hundred square miles of high altitude wilderness.

The Sequoia contains more than a million sequoia trees, twelve thousand of which are more than
ten feet in diameter, and some of which are the largest and oldest living things in the wide world.

The Grand Canyon of Arizona is by far the hugest and noblest example of erosion in the world.
It is gorgeously carved and colored. In sheer sublimity it offers an unequalled spectacle.

Mount McKinley stands more than 20,000 feet above sea level, and 17,000 feet above the surrounding
valleys. Scenically, it is the world's loftiest mountain, for the monsters of the Andes and
the Himalayas which surpass it in altitude can be viewed closely only from valleys from five
to ten thousand feet higher than McKinley's northern valleys.

The Hawaii National Park contains the fourth greatest dead crater in the world, the hugest
living volcano, and the Kilauea Lake of Fire, which is unique and draws visitors from the world's
four quarters.

These are the principal features of America's world supremacy. They are incidental to a system
of scenic wildernesses which in combined area as well as variety exceed the combined scenic
wilderness playgrounds of similar class comfortably accessible elsewhere. No wonder, then,
that the American public is overjoyed with its recently realized treasure, and that the Government
looks confidently to the rapid development of its new-found economic asset. The American public
has discovered America, and no one who knows the American public doubts for a moment what it
will do with it.

II

The idea still widely obtains that our national parks are principally playgrounds. A distinguished
member of Congress recently asked: "Why make these appropriations? More people visited Rock
Creek Park here in the city of Washington last Sunday afternoon than went to the Yosemite all
last summer. The country has endless woods and mountains which cost the Treasury nothing."

This view entirely misses the point. The national parks are recreational, of course. So are
state, county and city parks. So are resorts of every kind. So are the fields, the woods, the
seashore, the open country everywhere. We are living in an open-air age. The nation of outdoor
livers is a nation of power, initiative, and sanity. I hope to see the time when available
State lands everywhere, when every square mile from our national forest reserve, when even
many private holdings are made accessible and comfortable, and become habited with summer trampers
and campers. It is the way to individual power and national efficiency.

But the national parks are far more than recreational areas. They are the supreme examples.
They are the gallery of masterpieces. Here the visitor enters in a holier spirit. Here is inspiration.
They are also the museums of the ages. Here nature is still creating the earth upon a scale
so vast and so plain that even the dull and the frivolous cannot fail to see and comprehend.

This is no distinction without a difference. The difference is so marked that few indeed even
of those who visit our national parks in a frivolous or merely recreational mood remain in
that mood. The spirit of the great places brooks nothing short of silent reverence. I have
seen men unconsciously lift their hats. The mind strips itself of affairs as one sheds a coat.
It is the hour of the spirit. One returns to daily living with a springier step, a keener vision,
and a broader horizon for having worshipped at the shrine of the Infinite.

III

The Pacific Coast Expositions of 1915 marked the beginning of the nation's acquaintance with
its national parks. In fact, they were the occasion, if not the cause, of the movement for
national parks development which found so quickly a country-wide response, and which is destined
to results of large importance to individual and nation alike. Because thousands of those whom
the expositions were expected to draw westward would avail of the opportunity to visit national
parks, Secretary Lane, to whom the national parks suggested neglected opportunity requiring
business experience to develop, induced Stephen T. Mather, a Chicago business man with mountain-top
enthusiasms, to undertake their preparation for the unaccustomed throngs. Mr. Mather's vision
embraced a correlated system of superlative scenic areas which should become the familiar playgrounds
of the whole American people, a system which, if organized and administered with the efficiency
of a great business, should even become, in time, the rendezvous of the sightseers of the world.
He foresaw in the national parks a new and great national economic asset.

The educational and other propaganda by which this movement was presented to the people, which
the writer had the honor to plan and execute, won rapidly the wide support of the public. To
me the national parks appealed powerfully as the potential museums and classrooms for the popular
study of the natural forces which made, and still are making, America, and of American fauna
and flora. Here were set forth, in fascinating picture and lines so plain that none could fail
to read and understand, the essentials of sciences whose real charm our rapid educational methods
impart to few. This book is the logical outgrowth of a close study of the national parks, beginning
with the inception of the new movement, from this point of view.

How free from the partisan considerations common in governmental organization was the birth
of the movement is shown by an incident of Mr. Mather's inauguration into his assistant secretaryship.
Secretary Lane had seen him at his desk and had started back to his own room. But he returned,
looked in at the door, and asked:

"Oh, by the way, Steve, what are your politics?"

This book considers our national parks as they line up four years after the beginning of this
movement. It shows them well started upon the long road to realization, with Congress, Government,
and the people united toward a common end, with the schools and the universities interested,
and, for the first time, with the railroads, the concessioners, the motoring interests, and
many of the public-spirited educational and outdoor associations all pulling together under
the inspiration of a recognized common motive.

Of course this triumph of organization, for it is no less, could not have been accomplished
nearly so quickly without the assistance of the closing of Europe by the great war. Previous
to 1915, Americans had been spending $300,000,000 a year in European travel. Nor could it have
been accomplished at all if investigation and comparison had not shown that our national parks
excel in supreme scenic quality and variety the combined scenery which is comfortably accessible
in all the rest of the world together.

To get the situation at the beginning of our book into full perspective, it must be recognized
that, previous to the beginning of our propaganda in 1915, the national parks, as such, scarcely
existed in the public consciousness. Few Americans could name more than two or three of the
fourteen existing parks. The Yosemite Valley and the Yellowstone alone were generally known,
but scarcely as national parks; most of the school geographies which mentioned them at all
ignored their national character. The advertising folders of competing railroads were the principal
sources of public knowledge, for few indeed asked for the compilation of rates and charges
which the Government then sent in response to inquiries for information. The parks had practically
no administration. The business necessarily connected with their upkeep and development was
done by clerks as minor and troublesome details which distracted attention from more important
duties; there was no one clerk whose entire concern was with the national parks. The American
public still looked confidently upon the Alps as the supreme scenic area in the world, and
hoped some day to see the Canadian Rockies.
