All foods contain bacteria or ferments. In fact, it is impossible for a food stored and prepared
under ordinary conditions, unless it has been specially treated, to be free from them. Some
of them are useful, some are injurious, while others are capable of producing disease. The
objectionable bacteria are usually destroyed by the joint action of sunlight, pure air, and water.

31. Soluble Ferments.--Many plant and animal cells have the power of secreting substances soluble
in water and capable of producing fermentation changes; to these the term "soluble ferments,"
or "enzymes," is applied. These ferments have not a cell structure like the organized ferments.
When germinated seed, as malted barley, is extracted, a soluble and highly nitrogenous substance,
called the diastase ferment, is secured that changes starch into soluble forms. The soluble
ferments induce chemical change by causing molecular disturbance or splitting up of the organic
compounds, resulting in the production of derivative products. They take an important part
in animal and plant nutrition, as by their action insoluble compounds are brought into a soluble
condition so they can be utilized for nutritive purposes. In many instances ferment changes
are due to the joint action of soluble and insoluble ferments. The insoluble ferment secretes
an enzyme which induces a chemical change, modified by the further action of the soluble ferment.
Many of the enzymes carry on their work at a low temperature, as in the curing of meat and
cheese in cold storage.[14]

32. General Relationship of Chemical, Physical, and Bacteriological Changes.--It cannot be
said that the beneficial results derived from the cooking of foods are due to either chemical,
physical, or bacteriological change alone, but to the joint action of the three. In order to
secure a chemical change, a physical change must often precede, and a bacteriological change
cannot take place without causing a change in chemical composition; the three are closely related
and interdependent.

33. Esthetic Value of Foods.--Foods should be not only of good physical texture and contain
the requisite nutrients, but they should also be pleasing to the eye and served in the most
attractive manner. Some foods owe a part of their commercial value to color, and when they
are lacking in natural color they are not consumed with a relish. There is no objection to
the addition of coloring matter to foods, provided it is of a non-injurious character and does
not affect the amount of nutrients, and that its presence and the kind of coloring material
are made known. Some foods contain objectionable colors which are eliminated during the process
of manufacture, as in the case of sugar and flour. As far as removal of coloring matter from
foods during refining is concerned, there can be no objection, so long as no injurious reagents
or chemicals are retained, as the removal of the color in no way affects the nutritive value
or permits fraud, but necessitates higher purification and refining. The use of chemicals and
reagents in the preparation and refining of foods is considered permissible in all cases where
the reagents are removed by subsequent processes. In the food decisions of the United States
Department of Agriculture, it is stated: "Not excluded under this provision are substances
properly used in the preparation of food products for clarification or refining and eliminated
in the further process of manufacture." [15]

CHAPTER III

VEGETABLE FOODS

34. General Composition.--Vegetable foods, with the exception of cereals, legumes, and nuts,
contain a smaller percentage of protein than animal food products. They vary widely in composition
and nutritive value; in some, starch predominates, while in others, sugar, cellulose, and pectin
bodies are most abundant. The general term "vegetable foods" is used in this work to include
roots, tubers, garden vegetables, cereals, legumes, and all prepared foods of vegetable origin.

35. Potatoes contain about 75 per cent of water and 25 per cent of dry matter, the larger portion
being starch. There is but little nitrogenous material in the potato, only 2.25 per cent, of
which about half is in the form of proteids. There are ten parts of non-nitrogenous substance
to every one part of nitrogenous; or, in other words, the potato has a wide nutritive ratio,
and as an article of diet needs to be supplemented with foods rich in protein. The mineral
matter, cellular tissue, and fat in potatoes are small in amount, as are also the organic acids.
Mechanically considered, the potato is composed of three parts,--outer skin, inner skin, and
flesh. The layer immediately beneath the outer skin is slightly colored, and is designated
the fibro-vascular layer. The outer and inner skins combined make up about 10 per cent of the
weight of the potato.

A large portion of the protein of the potato is albumin, which is soluble in water. When potatoes
are peeled, cut in small pieces, and soaked in water for several hours before boiling, 80 per
cent of the crude protein, or total nitrogenous material, is extracted, rendering the product
less valuable as food. When potatoes are placed directly in boiling water, the losses of nitrogenous
compounds are reduced to about 7 per cent, and, when the skins are not removed, to 1 per cent.
Digestion experiments show that 92 per cent of the starch and 72 per cent of the protein are
digested.[12] Compared with other foods, potatoes are often a cheap source of non-nitrogenous
nutrients. If used in excessive amounts, however, they have a tendency to make the ration unbalanced
and too bulky.

36. Sweet Potatoes contain more dry matter than white potatoes, the difference being due mainly
to the presence of about 6 per cent of sugar. There is approximately the same starch content,
but more fat, protein, and fiber. As a food, they supply a large amount of non-nitrogenous
nutrients.

37. Carrots contain about half as much dry matter as potatoes, and half of the dry matter is
sugar, nearly equally divided between sucrose and levulose, or fruit sugar. Like the potato,
carrots have some organic acids and a relatively small amount of proteids. In carrots and milk
there is practically the same per cent of water. The nutrients in each, however, differ both
as to kind and proportion. Experiments with the cooking of carrots show that if a large amount
of water is used, 30 per cent or more of the nutrients, particularly of the more soluble sugar
and albumin, are extracted and lost in the drain waters.[12] The color of the carrot is due
to the non-nitrogenous compound carrotin, C{26}H{38}. Carrots are valuable in a ration not
because of the nutrients they supply, but for the palatability and the mechanical action which
the vegetable fiber exerts upon the process of digestion.

38. Parsnips contain more solid matter than beets or carrots, of which 3 to 4 per cent is starch.
The starch grains are very small, being only about one twentieth the size of the potato starch
grains. There is 3 per cent of sugar and an appreciable amount of fat, more than in any other
of the vegetables of this class, and seven times as much as in the potato. The mineral matter
is of somewhat different nature from that in potatoes; in parsnips one half is potash and one
quarter phosphoric acid, while in potatoes three quarters are potash and one fifth phosphoric acid.

39. Cabbage contains very little dry matter, usually less than 10 per cent. It is proportionally
richer in nitrogenous compounds than many vegetables, as about two of the ten parts of dry
matter are crude protein, which makes the nutritive ratio one to five. During cooking 30 to
40 per cent of the nutrients are extracted. Cabbage imparts to the ration bulk but comparatively
little nutritive material. It is a valuable food adjunct, particularly used raw, as in a salad,
when it is easily digested and retains all of the nutrients.[12]

40. Cauliflower has much the same general composition as cabbage, from which it differs mainly
in mechanical structure.

41. Beets.--The garden beet contains a little more protein than carrots, but otherwise has
about the same general composition, and the statements made in regard to the losses of nutrients
in the cooking of carrots and to their use in the dietary apply also to beets.

42. Cucumbers contain about 4 per cent of dry matter. The amount of nutrients is so small as
to scarcely allow them to be considered a food. They are, however, a valuable food adjunct,
as they impart palatability.

43. Lettuce contains about 7 per cent of solids, of which 1.5 is protein and 2.5 starch and
sugar. While low in nutrients, it is high in dietetic value, because of the chlorophyll which
it contains. It has been suggested that it is valuable, too, for supplying iron in an organic
form, as there is iron chemically combined with the chlorophyll.

44. Onions are aromatic bulbs, valuable for condimental rather than nutritive purposes. They
contain essential and volatile oils, which impart characteristic odor and flavor. In the onion
there are about 1.5 per cent of protein and 9.5 per cent of non-nitrogenous material. Onions
are often useful in stimulating the digestive tract to action.

45. Spinach is a valuable food, not to be classed merely as a relish. Its composition is interesting;
for, although there is 90 per cent water, and less than 10 per cent dry matter, it still possesses
high food value. Spinach contains 2.1 per cent crude protein, or about one part to every four
parts of carbohydrates. In potatoes, turnips, and beets there are ten or more parts of carbohydrates
to every one part of protein.

46. Asparagus is composed largely of water, about 93 per cent. The dry matter, however, is
richer in protein than that of many vegetables. Asparagus contains, too, an amid compound,
asparagin, which gives some of the characteristics to the vegetable.

47. Melons.--Melons contain from 8 to 10 per cent of dry matter, the larger portion of which
is sugar and allied carbohydrates. The flavor is due to small amounts of essential oils and
to organic acids associated with the sugars. Melons possess condimental rather than nutritive
value.

48. Tomatoes.--The tomato belongs to the night-shade family, and for this reason was long looked
upon with suspicion. It was first used for ornamental purposes and was called "love-apple."
Gradually, as the idea of its poisonous nature became dispelled, it grew more and more popular
as a food, until now in the United States it is one of the most common garden vegetables. It
contains 7 per cent of dry matter, 4 per cent of which is sucrose, dextrose, and levulose.
It also contains some malic acid, and a small amount of proteids, amids, cellulose, and coloring
material. In the canning of tomatoes, if too much of the juice is excluded, a large part of
the nutritive material is lost, as the sugars and albumins are all soluble and readily removed.[16]
If the seeds are objectionable, they may be removed by straining and the juice added to the
fleshy portion. The product then has a higher nutritive value than if the juice had been discarded
with the seeds.

49. Sweet Corn.--Fresh, soft, green, sweet corn contains about 75 per cent of water. The dry
matter is half starch and one quarter sugar. The protein content makes up nearly 5 per cent,
a larger proportional amount than is found in the ripened corn, due to the fact that the proteids
are deposited in the early stages of growth and the carbohydrates mainly in the last stages.
Sweet corn is a vegetable of high nutritive value and palatability.

50. Eggplant contains a high per cent of water,--90 per cent. The principal nutrients are starch
and sugar, which make up about half the weight of the dry matter. It does not itself supply
a large amount of nutrients, but the way in which it is prepared, by combination with butter,
bread crumbs, and eggs, makes it a nutritious and palatable dish, the food value being derived
mainly from the materials with which it is combined, the eggplant giving the flavor and palatability.

51. Squash and Pumpkin.--Squash has much the same general composition and food value as beets
and carrots, although it belongs to a different family. Pumpkins contain less dry matter than
squash. The dry matter of both is composed largely of starch and sugar and, like many other
of the vegetables, they are often combined with food materials containing a large amount of
nutrients, as in pumpkin and squash pies, where the food value is derived mainly from the milk,
sugar, eggs, flour, and butter or other shortening used.

52. Celery.--The dry matter of celery is comparatively rich in nitrogenous material, although
the amount is small, and the larger proportion is in non-proteid form. When grown on rich soil,
celery may contain an appreciable quantity of nitrates and nitrites, which have not been converted
into amids and proteids. The supposed medicinal value is probably due to the nitrites which
are generally present. Celery is valuable from a dietetic rather than a nutritive point of view.

53. Sanitary Condition of Vegetables.--The conditions under which vegetables are grown have
much to do with their value, particularly from a sanitary point of view. Uncooked vegetables
often cause the spread of diseases, particularly those, as cholera and typhoid, affecting the
digestive tract. Particles of dirt containing the disease-producing organisms adhere to the
uncooked vegetable and find their way into the digestive tract, where the bacteria undergo
incubation. When sewage has been used for fertilizing the land, as in sewage irrigation, the
vegetables are unsound from a sanitary point of view. Such vegetables should be thoroughly
cleaned and also well cooked, in order to render them sterile. Vegetables to be eaten in the
raw state should be dipped momentarily into boiling water, to destroy the activity of the germs
present upon the surface. They may then be immediately immersed in ice-cold water, to preserve
the crispness.

54. Miscellaneous Compounds in Vegetables.--In addition to the general nutrients which have
been discussed, many of the vegetables contain some tannin, glucosides, and essential oils;
and occasionally those grown upon rich soils have appreciable amounts of nitrogen compounds,
as nitrates and nitrites, which have not been built up into proteids. Vegetables have a unique
value in the dietary, and while as a class they contain small amounts of nutrients, they are
indispensable for promoting health and securing normal digestion of the food.

55. Canned Vegetables.--When sound vegetables are thoroughly cooked to destroy ferments, and
then sealed in cans while hot, they can be kept for a long time without any material impairment
of nutritive value. During the cooking process there is lost a part of the essential oils,
which gives a slightly different flavor to the canned or tinned goods.[17] In some canned vegetables
preservatives are used, but the enactment and enforcement of national and state laws have greatly
reduced their use. When the cans are made of a poor quality of tin, or the vegetables are of
high acidity, some of the metal is dissolved in sufficient quantity to be objectionable from
a sanitary point of view.[18]

56. Edible Portion and Refuse of Vegetables.--Many vegetables have appreciable amounts of refuse,[19]
or non-edible parts, as skin, pods, seeds, and pulp, and in determining the nutritive value,
these must be considered, as in some cases less than 50 per cent of the weight of the material
is edible portion, which proportionally increases the cost of the nutrients. Ordinarily, the
edible part is richer in protein than the entire material as purchased. In some cases, however,
the refuse is richer in protein, but the protein is in a less available form. See comparison
of potatoes and potato skins.

CHAPTER IV

FRUITS, FLAVORS, AND EXTRACTS

57. General Composition.--Fruits are characterized by containing a large amount of water and
only a small amount of dry matter, which is composed mainly of sugar and non-nitrogenous compounds.
Fruits contain but little fatty material and protein. A large portion of the total nitrogen
is in the form of amid compounds. Organic acids, as citric, tartaric, and malic, are found
in all fruits, and the essential oils form a characteristic feature. The taste of fruits is
due mainly to the blending of the various organic acids, essential oils, and sugars. Although
fruits contain a high per cent of water, they are nevertheless valuable as food.[20] The constituents
present to the greatest extent are sugars and acids. The sugar is not all like the common granulated
sugar, but in ripe fruits a part is in the form known as levulose or fruit sugar, which is
two and a half times sweeter than granulated sugar. Sugars are valuable for heat-and fat-producing
purposes, but not for muscle repairing. Proteids are the muscle-forming nutrients. The organic
acids, as malic acid in apples, citric acid in lemons and oranges, and tartaric acid in grapes,
have characteristic medicinal properties. The sugar, proteid, and acid content of some of our
more common fruits is given in the following table:[21]

COMPOSITION OF FRUITS

  ==============================================================
                  | WATER  |PROTEIDS| SUGAR  |ACID IN |KIND OF
                  |        |        |        | JUICE  | ACID

  Strawberries    |  90.8  |   0.95 |   5.36 |   1.40 |Malic
  Oranges         |  85.0  |   1.10 |  10.00 |   1.30 |Citric
  Lemons          |  84.0  |   0.95 |   2.00 |   7.20 |Citric
  ==============================================================

In addition to sugars, acids, and proteids, there are a great many other compounds in fruits.
Those which give the characteristic taste are called essential or volatile oils.

58. Food Value.--When the nutrients alone are considered, fruits appear to have a low food
value, but they should not be judged entirely on this basis, because they impart palatability
and flavor to other foods and exercise a favorable influence upon the digestive process. In
the human ration fruits are a necessary adjunct.

59. Apples.--Apples vary in composition with the variety and physical characteristics of the
fruit. In general they contain from 10 to 16 per cent of dry matter, of which 75 per cent,
or more, is sugar or allied carbohydrates. Among the organic acids malic predominates, and
the acidity ranges from 0.1 to 0.8 per cent. Apples contain but little protein, less than 1
per cent. There is some pectin, or jelly-like substance closely related to the carbohydrates.
The flavor of the apple varies with the content of sugar, organic acids, and essential oils.
During storage some apples appear to undergo further ripening, resulting in partial inversion
of the sucrose, and there is a slight loss of weight, due to the formation of carbon dioxide.
The apple is an important and valuable adjunct to the dietary.[22]

60. Oranges contain nearly the same proportion of dry matter as apples, the larger part of
which is sugar. Citric acid predominates and ranges in different varieties from 1 to 2.5 per
cent. The amounts of protein, fat, and cellulose are small. In some varieties of oranges there
is more iron and sulphur than is usually found in fruits. All fruits, however, contain small
amounts, but not as much as is found in green vegetables. The average composition of oranges
is as follows:

  ===========================================================
  PHYSICAL COMPOSITION|CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EDIBLE PORTION
  -----------------------------------------------------------
              Per Cent|                   Per Cent
  Rind        20 to 30| Solids            10 to 16
  Pulp        25 to 35| Sugars             8 to 12
  Juice       35 to 50| Citric acid        1 to 2.5
                      | Ash                     0.5
  ===========================================================

61. Lemons differ from oranges in containing more citric acid and less sucrose, levulose, and
dextrose. The ash of the lemon is somewhat similar in general composition to the ash of the
orange, but is larger in amount. Grape Fruit.--The rind and seed of this fruit make up about
25 per cent, leaving 75 per cent as edible portion. The juice contains 14 per cent solids,
of which nearly 10 per cent is sugar and 2.5 per cent is citric acid. There is more acid in
grape fruit than in oranges and appreciably less than in lemons. The characteristic flavor
is due to a glucoside-like material. Otherwise the composition and food value are about the
same as of oranges.

63. Strawberries contain from 8 to 12 per cent of dry matter, mainly sugar and malic acid.
The protein, fat, and ash usually make up less than 2 per cent. Essential oils and coloring
substances are present in small amounts. It has been estimated that it would require 75 pounds
of strawberries to supply the protein for a daily ration. Nevertheless they are valuable in
the dietary. It has been suggested that the malic and other acids have antiseptic properties
which, added to the appearance and palatability, make them a desirable food adjunct. Strawberries
have high dietetic rather than high food value.

64. Grapes contain more dry matter than apples or oranges. There is no appreciable amount of
protein or fat, and while they add some nutrients, as sugar, to the ration, they do not contribute
any quantity. Their value, as in the case of other fruits, is due to palatability and indirect
effect upon the digestibility of other foods. In the juice of grapes there is from 10 to 15
per cent or more of sugar, as sucrose, levulose, and dextrose. Grapes contain also from 1 to
1.5 per cent of tartaric acid, which, during the process of manufacture into wine, is rendered
insoluble by the alcohol formed, and the product, known as argole, is used in the preparation
of cream of tartar. Differences in flavor and taste of grapes are due to variations in the
sugar, acid, and essential oil content.

65. Peaches contain about 12 per cent of dry matter, of which over 10 per cent is sugar and
other carbohydrates. There is less than 1.5 per cent of protein, fat, and mineral matter and
about 0.5 per cent of acid. The peach contains also a very small amount of hydrocyanic acid,
which is more liberally present in the kernel than in the fruit. Flavor is imparted mainly
by the sugar and essential oils. Peaches vary in composition with variety and environment.[23]

66. Plums contain the most dry matter of any of the fruits, about 22 per cent, mainly sugar.
About one per cent is acid and about 0.5 per cent are protein and ash. There are a great many
varieties of plums, varying in composition. Dried plums (prunes) have mildly laxative properties.

67. Olives.--The ripe olive contains about 15 per cent of oil, exclusive of the pit, which
makes up 20 per cent of the weight. In green, preserved olives there is considerably less oil.
Because of the oil the olive has food value. Olive oil is slightly laxative and assists mechanically
in the digestion of foods.

68. Figs.--Dried figs contain about 50 per cent of sugar and 3.5 per cent of protein. The fig
has a mildly laxative action.

69. Dried Fruits.--Many fruits are prepared for market by drying. The dried fruit has a slightly
different composition from the fresh fruit because of loss of the volatile and essential oils,
and minor chemical changes which take place during the drying process. When free from preservatives,
dried fruits are valuable adjuncts to the dietary and can be advantageously used when fresh
fruits are not obtainable.

70. Canning and Preservation of Fruits.--To obtain the best results in canning, the fruit should
not be overripe. After the ripened state has been reached fermentation and bacterial changes
occur, and it is more difficult to preserve the fruit than when not so fully matured.[24] When
a fruit has begun to ferment, it is hard to destroy the ferment bodies and their spores so
as to prevent further ferment action. The chemical changes that occur in the last stages of
ripening are similar to those which take place during the cooking process whereby the pectin
or jelly-like substances are rendered more soluble and digestible.

71. Adulterated Canned Fruits.--Analyses of a number of canned fruits, made by various Boards
of Health, show the presence of small amounts of arsenic, tin, lead, and other poisonous metals.
The quantity dissolved depends upon the kind, age, and condition of the canned goods and the
state of the fruit when canned. The longer a can of fruit or vegetable has been kept in stock,
the larger is the amount of tin or metal that has been dissolved. When fresh canned, there
is usually very little dissolved tin, but in old goods the amount may be comparatively large.
The tin used for the can is occasionally of poor quality and may contain some arsenic, which
also is dissolved. The occasional use of canned goods preserved in tin is not objectionable,
but they should not be used continually if it can be avoided. Preservatives, as borax, salicylic
acid, benzoic acid, and sodium sulphate, are sometimes added to prevent fermentation and to
preserve the natural appearance of the fruit or vegetable.[18]

72. Fruit Flavors and Extracts.--Formerly all fruit extracts and flavors were obtained from
vegetable sources; at present many are made in the chemical laboratory by synthetic methods;
that is, by combining simpler organic compounds and radicals to produce the material having
the desired flavor and odor. The various fruit flavors are definite chemical compounds, and
can be produced in the laboratory as well as in the cells of plants. When properly made, there
is no difference in chemical composition between the two. As prepared in the laboratory, however,
traces of acids, alkalies, and other compounds, used in bringing about the necessary chemical
combination, are often present, not having been perfectly removed. Hence it is that natural
and artificial flavors differ mainly in the impurities which the artificial flavors may contain.

Some of the flavoring materials have characteristic medicinal properties, as the flavor of
bitter almond, which contains hydrocyanic acid, a poisonous substance. Flavors and extracts
should not be indiscriminately used. In small amounts they often exert a favorable influence
upon the digestion of foods, and the value of some fruits is in a large measure due to the
special flavors they contain. A study of the separate compounds which impart flavor to fruits,
as the various aldehydes, ethers, and organic salts, belongs to organic chemistry rather than
to foods. Some of the simpler compounds of which flavors are composed may exist in entirely
different form or combination in food products; as for example, pineapple flavoring is ethyl
butrate. This can be prepared by combination of butyric acid from stale butter with alcohol
which supplies the ethyl radical. The chemical union of the two produces the new compound,
ethyl butrate, the distinctive flavoring substance of the pineapple. Banana flavor can be made
from stale butter, caustic soda, and chloroform. None of these materials, as such, go into
the flavor, but an essential radical is taken from each. These manufactured products, when
properly made, are in every essential similar to the flavor made by the plant and stored up
in the fruit. The plant combines the material in the laboratory of the plant cell, and the
manufacturer of essences puts together these same constituents in a chemical laboratory. In
the fruit, however, the essential oil is associated with a number of other compounds.

CHAPTER V

SUGARS, MOLASSES, SYRUP, HONEY, AND CONFECTIONS

73. Composition of Sugars.--The term "sugar" is applied to a large class of compounds composed
of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Sugars used for household purposes are derived
mainly from the sugar cane and the sugar beet.[25] At the present time about two fifths are
obtained from the cane and about three fifths from the beet. When subjected to the same degree
of refining, there is no difference in the chemical composition of the sugars from the two
sources; they are alike in every respect and the chemist is unable to determine their origin.
The production of sugar is an agricultural industry; the methods of manufacture pertain more
to industrial chemistry than to the chemistry of foods, and therefore a discussion of them
is omitted in this work.[26]

74. Commercial Grades of Sugar.--Sugars are graded according to the size of the granule, the
color and general appearance of the crystals, and the per cent of sucrose or pure sugar. Common
granulated sugar is from 98.5 to 99.7 per cent pure sucrose. The impurities consist mainly
of moisture and mineral matter. In the process of refining, sulphur fumes are frequently used
for bleaching and clarifying the solution.[26] The sulphurous acid formed is neutralized with
lime, which is rendered insoluble and practically all removed in subsequent filtrations. There
are, however, traces of sulphates and sulphites in ordinary sugar, but these are in such small
amounts as not to be injurious to health. When sugar is burned, as in the bomb calorimeter,
so as to permit collection of all of the products of combustion, granulated sugar yields about
0.01 of a per cent of sulphur dioxid.[13] Occasionally coloring substances, as a small amount
of indigo, are added to yellow tinged sugars to impart a white color, much on the same principle
as the bluing of clothes. The amount used is usually extremely small, and the effect on health
has never been determined. Occasionally, however, bluing is used to such an extent that a blue
scum appears when the sugar is boiled with water. Sugar has high value for the production of
heat and energy. Digestion experiments show that when it is used in the dietary in not excessive
amounts, it is directly absorbed by the body and practically all available. It can advantageously
be combined with other foods to form a part of the ration.[27] When a ration contains the requisite
amount of protein, sugar is used to the best advantage. Alone it is incapable of sustaining
life, because it does not contain any nitrogen. When sugar was substituted for an excess of
protein in a ration, it was found to produce heat and energy at much less expense. Many foods,
as apples, grapes, and small fruits, contain appreciable amounts of sugar and owe their food
value almost entirely to their sugar content. In the dietary, sugar is too frequently regarded
as a condiment instead of a nutrient, to be used for imparting palatability rather than for
purposes of nutrition. While valuable for improving the taste of foods, the main worth of sugar
is as a nutritive substance; used in the preparation of foods it adds to the total heat and
energy of the ration. Sugar is sometimes used in excessive amounts and, as is the case with
any food or nutrient, when that occurs, nutrition disturbances result, due to misuse of the
food. Statistics show that the average consumption of sugar in the United States is nearly
70 pounds a year per capita. In the dietary of the adult, sugar to the extent of four ounces
per day can be consumed advantageously. The exclusion of sugar from the diet of children is
a great mistake, as they need it for heat and energy and to conserve the protein for growth.

     "Sugar is one of the most important forms in which carbohydrates
     can be added to the diet of children. The great reduction in the
     price of sugar which has taken place in recent years is probably
     one of the causes of the improved physique of the rising
     generation. The fear that sugar may injure children's teeth is,
     largely illusory. The negroes who live largely on sugar cane have
     the finest teeth the world can show. If injudiciously taken, sugar
     may, however, injure the child's appetite and digestion. The
     craving for sweets which children show is no doubt the natural
     expression of a physiological need, but they should be taken with,
     and not between, meals."[28]

75. Sugar in the Dietary.--Sugar has an important place in the dietary. It not only serves
for the production of heat and energy in the body, but is also valuable in enabling the proteids
to be used more economically. In reasonable amounts, it is particularly valuable in the dietary
of growing children, as the proteids of the food are then utilized to better advantage for
growth. The unique value of sugar depends upon its intelligent use and its proper combination
with other foods, particularly with those rich in the nitrogenous compounds or proteids. Sugar
alone is incapable of sustaining life, but combined with other foods is a valuable nutrient.
The amount which can be advantageously used depends largely upon the individual. Ordinarily
three to five ounces per day is sufficient, although some persons cannot safely consume as
much as this. In the case of diabetes mellitus, the amount of sugar in the ration must be materially
reduced. Persons in normal health and engaged in outdoor work can use sugar to advantage.[29]
Many of the "harvest drinks," made largely from molasses with a little ginger, and used extensively
in some localities, are not without merit, as they contain an appreciable amount of nutrients.
Milk contains more sugar as lactose or milk sugar than any other nutrient.

The craving for sugar by growing children and athletes is natural. Sugar, however, is often
injudiciously used, and a perverted taste may be established which can be satisfied only by
excessive amounts. This results in impaired digestion and malnutrition.

76. Maple Sugar.--Sugar obtained by evaporation from the sap of the maple tree (Acer saccharinum)
is identical, except for the foreign substances which it contains, with that from the beet
and sugar cane. The mottled appearance and characteristic color and taste of maple sugar are
due to the various organic acids and other compounds present in the maple sap and recovered
in the sugar. Maple sugar, as ordinarily prepared, has 0.4 of a per cent or more of ash or
mineral matter, while refined cane sugar contains less than one tenth as much.[30] Hence, when
maple sugar is adulterated with cane and beet sugars, the ash content is noticeably lowered,
as is also the content of organic acids. It is difficult, however, to determine with absolute
certainty pure high grade maple sugar from the impure low grade to which a small amount of
granulated sugar has been added.

77. Adulteration of Sugar.--Sugar at the present time is not materially adulterated. Other
than the substances mentioned which are used for clarification and color, none are added during
refining which remain in the sugar in appreciable amounts. Sugar does not readily lend itself
to adulteration, as it has a definite crystalline structure, and materials that would be suitable
for its adulteration are of entirely different physical character.[31] Cane sugar is not easily
blended with glucose, or starch sugar, because of the physical differences between the two.
The question of the kind of sugar to use in the household, as granulated, loaf, or pulverized,
is largely one of personal choice, as there is no appreciable difference in the nutritive value
or purity of the different kinds.

78. Dextrose Sugars.--Products known as glucose and dextrose sugars are made from corn and
other starches; they can also be prepared from cane sugar by the use of heat, chemicals, or
ferments for carrying on the process known as inversion. The dextrose sugars differ from cane
sugar in containing a dissimilar number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in the molecule.
The formula of the dextrose sugars is C{6}H{12}O{6}, while that of cane sugar is C{12}H{22}O{11}.
By the addition of one molecule of water, H{2}O, to a molecule of sucrose, two molecules of
invert sugar (dextrose and glucose) are produced:[1] C{12}H{22}O{11} + H{2} = C{6}H{12}O{6}
+ C{6}H{12}O{6}. In bringing about this change, acids are employed, but the acid in no way
enters into the chemical composition of the final product; it is removed as described during
the process of sugar manufacture. The action of the acid brings about a catalytic change, the
acid being necessary only as a presence reagent to start the chemical reaction. When properly
prepared and the acid product thoroughly removed, dextrose and glucose have practically the
same food value as sugar. When they are digested, heat and energy are produced, and a given
weight has about the same fuel value as an equal weight of sugar. Some of the glucose-yielding
products can be made at less expense than sugar, and when they are sold under their right names
there is no reason why they should not be used in the dietary, as they serve the same nutritive
purpose.

79. Molasses is a by-product obtained in the refining of sugar. It is a mixture of cane sugar
and invert sugars, as levulose and dextrose. When in sugar making the sucrose is removed by
crystallization, a point is finally reached where the solution, or mother liquid, as it is
called, refuses to give up any further crystals;[31] then this product, consisting of various
sugars and small amounts of organic acids and ash, is partially refined and clarified to form
molasses. The term "New Orleans" molasses was formerly applied to the product obtained by the
use of open kettles for the manufacture of sugar, but during recent years the vacuum pan process
has been introduced, and "New Orleans" molasses is now an entirely different article. The terms
first, second, and third molasses are applied to the liquids obtained after the removal of
the first, second, and third crops of sugar crystals; first molasses being richer in sucrose,
while third molasses is richer in dextrose and invert sugars. The ash in molasses ranges from
4 to 6.5 per cent. Some of the low grades of molasses are used in the preparation of animal foods.

The taste and physical characteristics of molasses are due largely to the organic acids and
impurities that are present, as well as to the proportion in which the various sugars occur.
When used with soda in cooking and baking operations, the organic acid of the molasses liberates
carbon dioxide gas, which acts as a leavening agent. Because of the organic acids, molasses
should not be stored in tin or metalware dishes, as the solvent action results in producing
poisonous tin and other metallic salts.

The food value of molasses is dependent entirely upon the amount of dry matter and the per
cent of sugar. A large amount of water is considered an adulterant; ordinarily molasses contains
from 20 to 33 per cent. If a sample of molasses contains 75 per cent of dry matter, it has
slightly less than three fourths of the nutritive value of the same weight of sugar.

80. Syrups.--The term "syrup" is applied to natural products obtained by evaporation and purification
of the saccharine juices of plants. Sorghum syrup is from the sorghum plant, which is pressed
by machinery and the juice clarified and evaporated so as to contain about 25 per cent of water.
In sorghum syrups there are from 30 to 45 per cent of cane sugar, and from 12 to 20 per cent
of glucose and invert sugars. Cane syrup is made from the clarified juice of the sugar cane,
and has about the same general composition as sorghum syrup. Maple syrup, prepared from the
juice of the sugar maple, is characteristically rich in sucrose and contains but little glucose
or reducing sugars. The flavor of all the syrups is due mainly to organic acids, ethereal products,
and impurities. In some instances the essential flavor can be produced synthetically, or derived
from other and cheaper materials; and by the use of these flavors, mixed syrups can be prepared
closely resembling many of the natural products. When properly made, they are equal in nutritive
value to natural syrups. When sold under assumed names, they are to be considered and classified
as adulterated, and not as syrups from definite and specific products. Low-grade syrups and
molasses are often used for making fuel alcohol. They readily undergo alcoholic fermentation
and are valuable for this purpose, rendering it possible for a good grade of fuel alcohol to
be produced at low cost. The manufacture of sugar, syrups, and molasses has been brought to
a high degree of perfection through the assistance rendered by industrial chemistry. Losses
in the process are reduced to a minimum, and the various steps are all controlled by chemical
analysis. Sugar has the physical property of deflecting a ray of polarized light, the amount
of deflection depending upon the quantity of sugar in solution. This is measured by the polariscope,
an instrument by means of which the sugar content of sugar plants is rapidly determined.

81. Honey is composed largely of invert sugars gathered by the honeybee from the nectar of
flowers. It varies in composition and flavor according to its source. The color depends upon
the flower from which it came, white clover giving a light-colored, pleasant-flavored honey,
while that from buckwheat and goldenrod is dark and has a slightly rank taste. The comb is
composed largely of wax, which has somewhat the same general composition as fat, but contains
ethereal instead of glycerol bodies. On account of the predominance of invert sugars, pure
honey has a levulo or left-handed rotation when examined by the polariscope. Honey contains
from 60 to 75 per cent of invert sugars, and from 12 to 20 per cent of water, while the ash
content is small, less than one tenth of one per cent. Strained honey is easily adulterated
with glucose products. Adulteration with cane sugar is readily detected, as pure honey contains
only a very small amount of sucrose. Honey can be made by feeding bees on sugar; the sugar
undergoes inversion, with the production of dextrose. Such honey, although not adulterated,
is inferior in quality and lacking in natural flavor.[18]

82. Confections.--By blending various saccharine products, confections are made. Usually sucrose
(cane and beet sugar) is used as the basis for their preparation. Sucrose has definite physical
properties, as crystalline structure, and forms chemical and mechanical combinations with acid,
alkaline, and other substances; it also unites with water, and when heated undergoes changes
in structural composition. The presence of small amounts of acid substances, or variations
in the concentration of the sugar solution, materially affect the mechanical relation of the
sugar particles to each other, and their crystallization. Usually crystallization takes place
when there is less than 25 per cent of water present. The form, size, and arrangement of the
crystals are influenced by agitation during cooling. To secure desired results, often small
quantities of various other substances are employed for their mechanical action. Glucose is
frequently used, and is said to be necessary for the production of some kinds of candy.

Candies are colored with various dyes and pigments, many of which are harmless, although some
are injurious. Coal tar dyes are frequently employed for this purpose. Objection has generally
been urged against their use, as it is believed many of them are injurious to health. It cannot
be said, however, that all are poisonous, as some are known to be harmless. The use of a few
coal tar dyes is allowed by the United States government. Mineral colors are now rarely, if
ever, used.

Impure candies result from objectionable ingredients, as starch, paraffin, and large amounts
of injurious coloring substances. Coal tar coloring materials are identified in the way described
in Experiment No. 13. Confectionery, when properly prepared and unadulterated, has the same
nutritive value as sugar and the other ingredients, and is entitled to a place in the dietary
for the production of heat and energy. Much larger amounts of candies are sold and consumed
during the winter than the summer months, suggesting that in cold weather candy is most needed
in the dietary.

83. Saccharine is an artificial sweetening, five hundred times sweeter than cane sugar. It
contains in its molecule, chemically united, benzine, sulphuric acid, and ammonia radicals.
It is employed for sweetening purposes in cases of diabetes mellitus, where physicians advise
against the use of sugar. It has no food value. A small amount is sometimes added to canned
corn and tomatoes to impart a sweet taste. The physiological properties of saccharine have
not been extensively investigated.

CHAPTER VI

LEGUMES AND NUTS

84. General Composition of Legumes.--Peas, beans, lentils, and peanuts are the legumes most
generally used for human food. As a class, they are characterized by high protein content and
a comparatively low per cent of starch and carbohydrates. They contain the largest amount of
nitrogenous compounds of any of the vegetable foods, and hence are particularly valuable in
the human ration as a substitute for meats.[32] For feeding animals the legumes are highly
prized, particularly the forage crops, clover and alfalfa. These secure their nitrogen, which
is the characteristic element of protein, from the free nitrogen of the air, through the workings
of bacterial organisms found in the nodules on the roots of the plants. The legumes appear
to be the only plants capable of making use of the nitrogen of the air for food purposes.

85. Beans contain about 24 per cent of protein and but little fat, less than is found in any
of the grain or cereal products. The protein of the bean differs from that of cereals in its
general and structural composition. It is a globulin known as legumin, and is acted upon mainly
by ferments working in alkaline solutions, as in the lower part of the digestive tract. Beans
have about the same amount of ash as the cereals, but the ash is richer in potash and lime.

86. Digestibility of Beans.--Beans are usually considered indigestible, but experiments show
they are quite completely digested, although they require more work on the part of the digestive
tract than many other foods. The digestibility was found to vary with individuals, 86 per cent
of the protein being digested in one case, and only 72 per cent in another. The protein of
beans is not as completely digested as that of meats. When beans were combined with other foods,
forming a part of a ration, they were more completely digested than when used in large amounts
and with only a few other foods. The presence of the skin is in part responsible for low digestibility.
When in the preparation of beans the skins, which contain a large amount of cellulose, are
removed, the beans are more completely digested. By cooking from twenty minutes to half an
hour in rapidly boiling water containing a small amount of soda, the skins are softened and
loosened and are then easily removed by rubbing in cold water. Some of the soda enters into
combination with the legumin. Along with the skins a portion of the germ is lost. The germ
readily ferments, which is probably the cause of beans producing flatulence with some individuals
during digestion. After the skins are removed the nutrients are more susceptible to the action
of the digestive fluids. Experiments show that 42 per cent of the protein of baked skinned
beans is soluble in pepsin and pancreatin solutions, while under similar conditions there is
only 3.85 per cent of the protein soluble from beans baked without removal of the skins.

87. Use of Beans in the Dietary.--There is no vegetable food capable of furnishing so much
protein at such low cost as beans; from a pound costing five cents about one fifth of a pound
of protein and three fifths of a pound of carbohydrates are obtained. Beans can, to a great
extent, take the place of meats in the dietary. There is more protein in beans than in beef.
Four ounces of uncooked beans or six ounces of baked beans are as much as can conveniently
be combined in the dietary, and these will furnish a quarter of the protein of the ration.
In the case of active out-of-door laborers over a pound of baked beans per day is often consumed
with impunity.

88. String Beans.--String beans--green beans with pod--contain a large amount of water, 85
to 88 per cent. The dry matter is rich in protein, nearly 20 per cent, although in the green
beans as eaten, containing 85 per cent water, there is less than 2-1/2 per cent. Lima beans
are richer in protein than string beans, as the green pod is not included. String beans are
valuable both for the nutrients they contain and for the favorable influence they exert upon
the digestibility of other foods.

89. Peas.--In general composition and digestibility, peas are quite similar to beans. They
belong to the same family, Leguminosæ, and the protein of each is similar in quantity and general
properties. The statements made in regard to the composition, digestibility, and use of beans
in the dietary apply with minor modifications to peas. When used in the preparation of soups,
they add appreciable amounts of nutrients.

90. Canned Peas.--In order to impart a rich green color, copper sulphate has been used in the
canning of peas. Physiologists differ as to its effect upon health. While a little may not
be particularly injurious, much interferes with normal digestion of the food and forms insoluble
copper proteids. In some countries a small amount of copper sulphate is tolerated, while in
others it is prohibited.

91. Peanuts.--Peanuts differ from peas and beans in containing more fat. They should be considered
a food, for at ordinary prices they furnish a large amount of protein and fat. Like the other
members of the legume family, the peanut is rather slow of digestion and requires considerable
intestinal work for completion of the process.

NUTS

92. General Composition.--Nuts should be regarded as food, for they contribute to a ration
appreciable amounts of nutrients. The edible portion of nearly all is rich in fat; pecans,
for example, contain as high as 70 per cent. In protein content nuts range from 3 per cent
in cocoanuts to 30 per cent in peanuts. The carbohydrate content is usually comparatively low,
less than 5 per cent in hickory nuts, although there is nearly 40 per cent in chestnuts. On
account of high fat content, nuts supply a large amount of heat and energy.[33]

93. Chestnuts are characterized by containing less fat and protein and much more carbohydrate
material, especially starch, than is found in other nuts. In southern Europe chestnuts are
widely used as food; the skins are removed, and the nuts are steamed, boiled, or roasted, and
sometimes they are dried and ground into flour. Chestnuts are less concentrated in protein
and fat, and form a better balanced food used alone than do other nuts.

94. The Hickory Nut, which is a characteristically American nut, contains in the edible portion
about 15 per cent protein, 65 per cent fat, and 12 per cent carbohydrates.

95. The Almonds used in the United States come chiefly from southern Europe, although they
are successfully raised in California. They contain about 55 per cent fat and 22 per cent protein.
The flavor of almonds is due to a small amount of hydrocyanic acid.

96. Pistachio.--Some nuts are used for imparting color and flavor to food products, as the
pistachio nut, the kernel of which is greenish in color and imparts a flavor suggestive of
almonds. The pistachio has high food value, as it is rich in both fat and protein. It is employed
in the manufacture of confectionery and in ice cream for imparting flavor and color.

97. Cocoanuts grow luxuriantly in many tropical countries, and have a high food value. They
are characteristically rich in fat, one half of the edible portion being composed of this nutrient.
For tropical countries they supply the fat of a ration at less expense than any other food.
When used in large amounts they should be supplemented with foods rich in carbohydrates, as
rice, and in proteids, as beans. Cocoanut milk is proportionally richer in carbohydrates and
poorer in fat and protein than the meat of the cocoanut. In discussing the cocoanut, Woods
states:[34]

     "The small, green, and immature nuts are grated fine for medicinal
     use, and when mixed with the oil of the ripe nut it becomes a
     healing ointment. The jelly which lines the shell of the more
     mature nut furnishes a delicate and nutritious food. The milk in
     its center, when iced, is a most delicious luxury. Grated cocoanut
     forms a part of the world-renowned East India condiment, curry.
     Dried, shredded (desiccated) cocoanut is an important article of
     commerce. From the oil a butter is made, of a clear, whitish color,
     so rich in fat, that of water and foreign substances combined there
     are but O.0068. It is better adapted for cooking than for table
     use. At present it is chiefly used in hospitals, but it is rapidly
     finding its way to the tables of the poor, particularly as a
     substitute for oleomargarine."

98. Use of Nuts in the Dietary.--When nuts can be secured at a low price per pound, ten cents
or less, they compare favorably in nutritive value with other staple foods. Digestion experiments
with rations composed largely of nuts show that they are quite thoroughly digested. Professor
Jaffa of the California Experiment Station, in discussing the nutritive value of nuts and fruits,
says:[35]

     "It is certainly an error to consider nuts merely as an accessory
     to an already heavy meal, and to regard fruit merely as something
     of value for its pleasant flavor, or for its hygienic or medicinal
     virtues. The agreement of one food or another with any person is
     more or less a personal idiosyncrasy, but it seems fair to say that
     those with whom nuts and fruits agree, can, if they desire, readily
     secure a considerable part of their nutritive material from such
     sources."

CHAPTER VII

MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS

99. Importance in the Dietary.--There is no article of food which enters so extensively into
the dietary as milk, and it is one of the few foods which supply all the nutrients,--fats,
carbohydrates, and proteids.[36] Milk alone is capable of sustaining life for comparatively
long periods, and it is the chief article of food during many diseases. An exclusive milk diet
for a healthy adult, however, would be unsatisfactory; in the case of young children, milk
is essential, because the digestive tract has not become functionally developed for the digestion
of other foods.

It is necessary to consider not only the composition and nutritive value of milk, but also
its purity or sanitary condition.

100. General Composition.--Average milk contains about 87 per cent water and 13 per cent dry
matter. The dry matter is composed approximately of:

  =======================
              | Per Cent
  Fat         |   3.5
  Casein      |   3.25
  Albumin     |   0.50
  Milk sugar  |   5.00
  Ash         |   0.75
  =======================

Fat is the most variable constituent of milk. Occasionally it is found as low as 2 per cent
and as high as 6 per cent or more. The poorest and richest milks differ mainly in fat content,
as the sugar, ash, casein, and albumin, or "solids of the milk serum," are fairly constant
in amount and composition. Variations in the content of fat are due to differences in feed
and in the breed and individuality of the animal.

101. Digestibility.--Milk is one of the most completely digested of foods, about 95 per cent
of the protein and fat and 97 per cent of the carbohydrates being absorbed and utilized by
the body.

In a mixed ration, the nutrients of milk are practically all absorbed. Milk also exerts a favorable
influence upon the digestibility of other foods with which it is combined. This is doubtless
due to the digestive action of the special ferments or enzymes which milk contains. In milk
there is a soluble ferment material or enzyme which has the power of peptonizing proteids.
It is this ferment which carries on the ripening process when cheese is cured in cold storage,
and it is believed to be this body which promotes digestion of other foods with which milk
is combined.[27]

Milk is not easily digested by some persons. The tendency to costiveness caused by a milk diet
can be largely overcome by the use of salt with the milk, or of some solid food, as toast or
crackers, to prevent coagulation and the formation of masses resistant to the digestive fluids.
Barley water and lime water in small amounts are also useful for assisting mechanically in
the digestion of milk. Milk at ordinary prices is one of the cheapest foods that can be used.

102. Sanitary Condition of Milk.--Equally as important as composition is the sanitary condition
or wholesomeness of milk. Milk is a food material which readily undergoes fermentation and
is a medium for the distribution of germ diseases. The conditions under which it is produced
and the way in which it is handled determine largely its sanitary value, and are of so much
importance in relation to public health that during recent years city and state boards of health
have introduced sanitary inspection and examination of milk along with the chemical tests for
detecting its adulteration. Some of the more frequent causes of contaminated and unsound milk
are: unhealthy animals, poor food and water, unsanitary surroundings of the animals, and lack
of cleanliness and care in the handling and transporting of the milk. Outbreaks of typhoid
and scarlet fevers and other germ diseases have frequently been traced to a contaminated milk
supply.[37]

103. Certified Milk.--When milk is produced under the most sanitary conditions, the number
of bacterial bodies per cubic centimeter is materially reduced. In order to supply high grade
milk containing but few bacteria, special precautions are taken in the care of the animals,
and in the feeding and milking, and all sources of contamination of the milk are eliminated
as far as possible. Such milk, when sold in sterilized bottles, is commonly called "certified
milk," indicating that its purity is guaranteed by the producer and that the number of bacteria
per unit does not exceed a certain standard, as 8000 per cubic centimeter. Ordinary market
milk contains upwards of 50,000.

104. Pasteurized Milk.--In order to destroy the activity of the bacterial organisms, milk is
subjected to a temperature of 157° F. for ten minutes or longer, which process is known as
pasteurization. When milk is heated to a temperature above 180°, it is sterilized. Below 157°,
the albumin is not coagulated. By pasteurizing, milk is much improved from a sanitary point
of view, and whenever the milk supply is of unknown purity, it should be pasteurized.[38] After
the milk has been thus treated, the same care should be exercised in keeping it protected to
prevent fresh inoculation or contamination, as though it were unpasteurized milk. For family
use milk can be pasteurized in small amounts in the following way: Before receiving the milk,
the receptacle should be thoroughly cleaned and sterilized with boiling water or dry heat,
as in an oven. The milk is loosely covered and placed in a pan of water, a false bottom being
in the pan so as to prevent unequal heating. The water surrounding the milk is gradually heated
until a temperature of 159° F. is registered, and the milk is kept at this temperature for
about ten minutes. It is then cooled and placed in the refrigerator.

105. Tyrotoxicon.--Tyrotoxicon is a chemical compound produced by a ferment body which finds
its way into milk when kept in unsanitary surroundings. It induces digestion disorders similar
to cholera, and when present in large amounts, may prove fatal. It sometimes develops in cream,
ice cream, or cheese, but only when they have been kept in unclean places or produced from
infected milk.

601. Color of Milk is often taken as a guide to its purity and richness in fat. While a yellow
tinge is usually characteristic of milks rich in fat, it is not a hard and fast rule, for frequently
light-colored milks are richer in fat than yellow-tinged ones. The coloring material is independent
of the percentage of fat, and it is not always safe to judge the richness of milk on the basis
of color.

107. Souring of Milk.--Souring of milk is due to the action of the lactic acid organism, which
finds its way into the milk through particles of dust carried in the air or from unclean receptacles
which contain the spores of the organism.[39] When milk sours, a small amount of sugar is changed
to lactic acid which reacts upon the casein, converting it from a soluble to an insoluble condition.
When milk is exposed to the air at a temperature of from 70° to 90° F., lactic acid fermentation
readily takes place. At a low temperature the process is checked, and at a high temperature
the organisms and spores are destroyed. In addition to lactic acid ferments, there are large
numbers of others which develop in milk, changing the different compounds of which milk is
composed. In the processes of butter and cheese making, these fermentation changes are controlled
so as to develop the flavor and secure the best grades of butter and cheese.

108. Use of Preservatives in Milk.--In order to check fermentation, boric acid, formalin, and
other preservatives have been proposed. Physiologists object to their use because the quantity
required to prevent fermentation is often sufficient to have a medicinal effect. The tendency
is to use excessive amounts, which may interfere with normal digestion of the food. Milk that
is cared for under the most sanitary conditions has a higher dietetic value and is much to
be preferred to that which has been kept sweet by the use of preservatives.

109. Condensed Milk is prepared by evaporating milk in vacuum pans until it is reduced about
one fourth in bulk, when it is sealed in cans, and it will then keep sweet for a long time.
Occasionally some cane sugar is added to the evaporated product. When diluted, evaporated milk
has much the same composition as whole milk. When a can of condensed milk has been opened,
the same care should be exercised to prevent fermentation as if it were fresh milk.

110. Skim Milk differs in composition from whole milk in fat content. When the fat is removed
by the separator, there is often left less than one tenth of a per cent. Skim milk has a much
higher nutritive value than is generally conceded, and wherever it can be procured at a reasonable
price it should be used in the dietary as a source of protein.

111. Cream ranges in fat content from 15 to 35 per cent. It is generally preferred to whole
milk, although it is not as well balanced a food, because it is deficient in protein. Cream
should contain at least 25 per cent of fat.

112. Buttermilk is the product left after removal of the fat from cream by churning. It has
about the same amount of nutrients as skim milk. The casein is in a slightly modified form
due to the development of lactic acid during the ripening of the cream, and on this account
buttermilk is more easily digested and assimilated by many individuals than milk in other forms.
The development of the acid generally reduces the number of species of other than the lactic
organisms, and these are increased.

113. Goat's Milk is somewhat richer in solids than cow's milk, containing about one per cent
more proteids, a little more fat, and less sugar. When used as a substitute for human or cow's
milk, it generally needs to be slightly diluted, depending, however, upon the composition of
the individual sample.

114. Koumiss is a fermented beverage made from milk by the use of yeast to secure alcoholic
fermentation. Koumiss contains about one per cent each of lactic acid and alcohol, and the
casein and other nutrients are somewhat modified by the fermentation changes. Koumiss is generally
considered a non-alcoholic beverage possessing both food and dietetic value.

115. Prepared Milks.--Various preparations are made to resemble milk in general composition.
These are mechanical mixtures of sugar, fats, and proteids. Milk sugar, casein, or malted proteids
are generally the materials employed in their preparation. Often the dried and pulverized solids
of skim milk are used. Many of the prepared milks are deficient in fat. While they are not
equal to cow's milk, their use is often made necessary from force of circumstances.

116. Human Milk is not as rich in solid matter as cow's milk. It contains about the same amount
of fat, one per cent more sugar, and one per cent less proteids. In human milk nearly one half
of the protein is in the form of albumins, while in cow's milk there is about one fifth in
this form. The fat globules are much smaller than those of cow's milk. In infant feeding it
is often necessary to modify cow's milk by the addition of water, cream, and milk sugar, so
as to make it more nearly resemble in composition human milk.

117. Adulteration of Milk.--Milk is not as extensively adulterated as it was before the passage
and enforcement of the numerous state and municipal laws regulating its inspection and sale.
The most frequent forms of adulteration are addition of water and removal of cream. These are
readily detected from the specific gravity and fat content of the milk. The specific gravity
of milk is determined by means of the lactometer, an instrument which sinks to a definite point
in pure milk. In watered milk it sinks to greater depth, depending upon the amount of water
added. The fat content of milk is readily and accurately determined by the Babcock test, in
which the fat is separated by centrifugal action. For the detection of adulterated milk the
student is referred to Chapter VI, "Chemistry of Dairying," by Snyder.

BUTTER

118. Composition.--Butter is made by the churning or agitation of cream and is composed mainly
of milk fats and water, together with smaller amounts of ash, salt, casein, milk sugar, and
lactic acid. Average butter has the following composition:

  ============================
                     |Per Cent
  Water              | 10.5
  Ash and salt       |  2.5
  Casein and albumin |  1.0
  Fat                | 86.0
  ============================

When butter contains an abnormal amount of water, it is considered adulterated. According to
act of Congress standard butter should not contain over 16 per cent of water nor less than
82.5 per cent of fat.

119. Digestibility of Butter.--Digestion experiments show that practically all of the fat,
98 per cent, is digestible and available for use by the body. Butter is valuable only for the
production of heat and energy. Alone, it is incapable of sustaining life, because it contains
no proteid material. It is usually one of the more expensive items of food, but it is generally
considered quite necessary in a ration.[5] It has been suggested that it takes an important
part mechanically in the digestion of food.

120. Adulteration of Butter.--In addition to containing an excess of water, butter is adulterated
in other ways. Old, stale butter is occasionally melted, washed, salted, and reworked. This
product is known as renovated butter, and has poor keeping qualities. Frequently preservatives
are added to such butter to delay fermentation changes. Oleomargarine and butterine are made
by mixing vegetable and animal fats.[40] Highly colored stearin, cotton-seed oil, and lard
are the usual materials from which oleomargarine is made. It has practically the same composition,
digestibility, and food value as butter. When sold under its true name and not as butter, there
is no objection, as it is a valuable food and supplies heat and energy at less cost than butter.
The main objection to oleomargarine and butterine is that they are sold as butter.[41]

The coloring of butter is not generally looked upon as adulteration, for butter naturally has
a more or less yellow tinge. According to an act of Congress, butter colors of a non-injurious
character are allowed to be used.

CHEESE

121. General Composition.--Cheese, is made by the addition of rennet to ripened milk, resulting
in coagulation of the casein, which mechanically combines with the fat. It differs from butter
in composition by containing, in addition to fat, casein and appreciable amounts of mineral
matter. The composition varies with the character of the milk from which the cheese was made.
Average milk produces cheese containing a larger amount of fat than proteids, while cheese
from skimmed or partially skimmed milk is proportionally poorer in fat. Ordinarily there is
about 35 per cent of water, 33 per cent of fat, and 27 per cent of casein, and albumin or milk
proteids, the remainder being ash, salt, milk sugar, and lactic acid. Cheese is characterized
by its large percentage of both fat and protein, and has high food value. It contains more
fat and protein than any of the meats; in fact, there are but few foods which have such liberal
amounts of these nutrients as cheese.

The odor and flavor of cheese are due to workings of bacteria which result in the production
of aromatic compounds. The purity and condition of the milk, as well as the method of manufacture
and the kind of ferment material used, determine largely the flavor and odor. Cheese is generally
allowed to undergo a ripening or curing process before it is used as food. The changes resulting
consist mainly in increased solubility of the proteids, with the formation of a small amount
of amid and aromatic compounds.[42]

122. Digestibility.--Cheese is popularly considered an indigestible food, but extended experiments
show that it is quite completely digested, although in the case of some individuals not easily
digested. In general, about 95 per cent of the fat and 92 per cent and more of the protein
is digested, depending upon the general composition of the cheese and the digestive capacity
of the individual. As far as total digestibility is concerned, there appears to be but little
difference between green and well-cured cheese. So far as ease of digestion is concerned, it
is probable that some difference exists. There is also but little difference in digestibility
resulting from the way in which milk is made into cheese, the nutrients of Roquefort, Swiss,
Camembert, and Cheddar being about equally digestible.[13] The differences in odor and taste
are due to variations in kind and amount of bacterial action. When combined with other foods,
cheese may exercise a beneficial influence upon digestion in the same way as noted from the
use of several foods in a ration. No material differences were observed in digestibility when
cheese was used in small amounts, as for condimental purposes, or when used in large amounts
to furnish nutrients. Artificial digestion experiments show that cheese is more readily acted
upon by the pancreatic than by the gastric fluids, suggesting that cheese undergoes intestinal
rather than gastric digestion. It is possible this is the reason that cheese is slow of digestion
in the case of some individuals.

123. Use in the Dietary.--Cheese should be used in the dietary regularly and in reasonable
amounts, rather than irregularly and then in large amounts. Cheese is not a luxury, but ordinarily
it is one of the cheapest and most nutritious of human foods. A pound of cheese costing 15
cents contains about a quarter of a pound of protein and a third of a pound of fat; at the
same price, beef yields only about half as much fat and less protein. Cheese at 18 cents per
pound furnishes more available nutrients and energy than beef at 12 cents per pound. In the
dietary of European armies, cheese to a great extent takes the place of beef. See Chapter XVI.

124. Cottage Cheese is made by coagulating milk and preparing the curd by mixing with it cream
or melted butter and salt or sugar as desired. When milk can be procured at little cost, cottage
cheese is one of the cheapest and most valuable foods.[43]

125. Different Kinds of Cheese.--By the use of different kinds of ferments and variations in
the process of manufacture different types or kinds of cheese are made, as Roquefort, Swiss,
Edam, Stilton, Camembert, etc. In the manufacture of Roquefort cheese, which is made from goats'
and ewes' milk, bread is added and the cheese is cured in caves, resulting in the formation
of a green mold which penetrates the cheese mass, and produces characteristic odor and flavor.
Stilton is an English soft, rich cheese of mild flavor, made from milk to which cream is usually
added. It is allowed to undergo an extended process of ripening, often resulting in the formation
of bluish green threads of fungus. Limburger owes its characteristic odor and flavor to the
action of special ferment bodies which carry on the ripening process. Neufchatel is a soft
cheese made from sweet milk to which the rennet is added at a high temperature. After pressing,
it is kneaded and worked, and then put into packages and covered with tin foil.

126. Adulteration of Cheese.--The most common forms of adulteration are the manufacture of
skim-milk cheese by the removal of the fat from the milk, and substitution of cheaper and foreign
fats, making a product known as filled cheese. When not labeled whole milk cheese, or sold
as such, there is no objection to skim-milk cheese. It has a high food value and is often a
cheap source of protein. The manufacture of filled cheese is now regulated by the national
government, and all such cheese must pay a special tax and be properly labeled. As a result,
the amount of filled cheese upon the market has very greatly decreased, and cheese is now less
adulterated than in former years. The national dairy law allows the use of coloring matter
of a harmless nature in the manufacture of cheese.

127. Dairy Products in the Dietary.--The nutrients in milk are produced at less expense for
grain and forage than the nutrients in beef, hence from a pecuniary point of view, dairy products,
as milk and cheese, have the advantage. In the case of butter, however, the cost usually exceeds
that of meat. In older agricultural regions, where the cost of beef production reaches the
maximum, dairying is generally resorted to, as it yields larger financial returns, and as a
result more cheese and less beef are used in the dietary. As the cost of meats is enhanced,
dairy products, as cheese, naturally take their place.

CHAPTER VIII

MEATS AND ANIMAL FOOD PRODUCTS

128. General Composition.--Animal tissue is composed of the same classes of compounds as plant
tissue. In each, water makes up a large portion of the weight, and the dry matter is composed
of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous compounds, and ash or mineral matter. Plants and animals
differ in composition not so much as to the kinds of compounds, although there are differences,
but more in the percentage amounts of these compounds. In plants, with the exception of the
legumes, the protein rarely exceeds 14 per cent, and in many vegetable foods, when prepared
for the table, there is less than 2 per cent. In meats the protein ranges from 15 to 20 per
cent. The non-nitrogenous compounds of plants are present mainly in the form of starch, sugar,
and cellulose, while in animal bodies there are only traces of carbohydrates, but large amounts
of fat. Fat is the chief non-nitrogenous compound of meats; it ranges between quite wide limits,
depending upon kind, age, and general condition of the animal. Meats contain the same general
classes of proteins as the vegetable foods; in each the proteins are made up of albumins, glubulins,
albuminates, peptone-like bodies, and insoluble proteids. The larger portion of the protein
of meats and cereals is in insoluble forms. The meat juices, which contain the soluble portion
of the proteins, constitute less than 5 percent of the nitrogenous compounds. Meats contain
less amid substances than plants, in which the amids are produced from ammonium compounds and
are supposed to be intermediate products in the formation of proteids, while in the animal
body they are derived from the proteids supplied in the food and, it is generally believed,
cannot form proteids. Albuminoids make up the connective tissue, hair, and skin, and are more
abundant in animal than in plant tissue. One of the chief albuminoids is gelatine. Both plant
and animal foods undergo bacterial changes resulting in the production of alkaloidal bodies
known as ptomaines, of which there are a large number. These are poisonous and are what cause
putrid and stale meat to be unwholesome. The protein in meat differs little in general composition
from that of vegetable origin; differences in structure and cleavage products between the two
are, however, noticeable.

While meats from different kinds of animals have somewhat the same general composition, they
differ in physical properties, and also in the nature of the various nutrients. For example,
pork contains less protein than beef, but the protein of pork is materially different from
that of beef, as a larger portion is in the form of soluble proteids, while in beef more is
present in an insoluble form. Not only are differences in the percentage of individual proteins
noticeable, but there are equally as great differences in the fats. As for example: some of
the meats have a larger proportion of the fat as stearin than do others. Hence meats differ
in texture and taste more than in nutritive value, due to the variations in the percentage
of the different proteins, fats, and extractive material, rather than to differences in the
total amounts of these compounds. The taste and flavor of meat is to a large extent influenced
by the amount of extractive material.

While the nutrients of meats are divided into classes, as proteins and fats, there are a large
number of separate compounds which make up each of the individual classes, and there are also
small amounts of compounds which are not included in these groups.

129. Beef.--About one half of the weight of beef is water; the lean meat contains a much larger
amount than the fat. As a rule, the parts of the animal that contain the most fat contain the
least water. In some meats there is considerable refuse, 25 to 30 per cent. In average meat
about 12 per cent of the butcher's weight is refuse and non-edible parts.[44] A pound of average
butcher's meat is about one half water, and over 10 per cent waste and refuse, which leaves
less than 40 per cent fat and protein. Meat is generally considered to have a high nutritive
value, due to the comparatively large amounts of fat and protein. Beef contains more protein
than any vegetable food, except the legumes, and from 1 to 1.5 per cent mineral matter, exclusive
of bone. Some of the mineral matter is chemically united with the protein and other compounds.
While figures are given for average composition of beef, it is to be noted that wide variations
are frequently to be met with, some samples containing a much larger amount of waste and trimmings
than others, and this influences the percent of the nutritive substances. In making calculations
of nutrients consumed, as in dietary studies, the figures for average composition of meat should
be used only in cases where the samples do not contain an excess either of fat or trimmings.[45]
When very lean, there is often a large amount of refuse, and the meat contains less dry matter
and is of poorer flavor than from animals in prime condition. In the case of very fat animals,
a large amount of waste results, and the flavor is sometimes impaired.

130. Veal differs from beef in containing a smaller amount of dry matter, richer in protein,
but poorer in fat. Animals differ in composition at different stages of growth in much the
same way as plants. In the earlier stages protein predominates in the plant tissue, while later
the carbohydrates are added in larger amounts, reducing the percentage content of protein.
In animals the same is noticeable. Young animals are, pound for pound, richer in protein than
old animals. While in the case of vegetables the increase in size, or rotundity, is due to
starch and carbohydrates, in animals it is due to the addition of fat. But plants, like animals,
observe the same general laws as to changes in composition at different stages of growth.

131. Mutton.--There is about the same amount of refuse matter in mutton as in beef. In a side
of mutton about 19 percent: are trimmings and waste, and in a side of beef 18.5 per cent. Mutton,
as a rule, contains a little more fat and dry matter than beef, and somewhat less protein.
A side of beef, as purchased, contains about 50 per cent of water, 14.5 per cent protein, and
16.8 per cent of fat, while a side of mutton, as purchased, contains 42.9 per cent water, 12.5
per cent protein, and 24.7 per cent fat. A pound of beef yields a smaller number of calories
by 25 per cent than a pound of mutton. At the same price per pound more nutrients can be purchased
as mutton than as beef. The differences in composition between lamb and mutton are similar
to those between veal and beef; viz. a larger amount of water and protein and a smaller amount
of fat in the same weight of the young animals. Differences in composition between the various
cuts of lamb are noticeable. The leg contains the least fat and the most protein, while the
chuck is richest in fat and poorest in protein. As in the case of beef, many of the cheaper
cuts contain as much or more nutrients than the more expensive cuts. They are not, however,
as palatable and differ as to toughness and other physical characteristics.

132. Pork is characterized by a high per cent of fat and a comparatively low per cent of protein.
It is generally richest in fat of any of the meats. The per cent of water varies with the fatness
of the animal; in very fat animals there is a smaller amount, while lean animals contain more.
In lean salt pork there is about 20 per cent water, and in fat salt pork about 7 per cent.
There is less refuse and waste in pork than in either beef or mutton. Ham contains from 14
to 15 per cent of refuse, and bacon about 7 per cent. Bacon has nearly twice as much fat and
a smaller amount of protein than ham. A pound of bacon, as purchased, will yield nearly twice
as much energy or fuel value as a pound of ham. Digestion experiments show that bacon is quite
readily and completely digested and is often a cheaper source of fat and protein than other
meats. There is about three times as much fat in bacon as in beef. When prepared for the table
bacon contains, from 40 to 50 per cent of fat. A pound of high grade, lean bacon furnishes
from 0.1 to 0.3 of a pound of digestible protein and from 0.4 to 0.6 of a pound of digestible
fat, which is about two thirds as much fat as is found in butter. Bacon contains nearly as
much digestible protein as other meats and from two to three times as much fat, making it,
at the same price per pound, a cheaper food than other meats. In salt pork there is from 60
to 85 per cent of fat, and less protein than in bacon. The protein and fat of pork differ from
those in beef not only in percentage amounts, but also in the nature of the individual proteins
and fats. The composition of pork varies with the nature of the food that is consumed by the
animal. Experiments show that it is possible by judicious feeding in the early stages of growth
to produce pork with the maximum of lean meat and the minimum of fat. After the animal has
passed a certain period, it is not possible by feeding to materially influence the percentage
of nutrients in the meat. The flavor, too, of pork, as of other meats, is dependent largely
upon the nature of the food the animal consumes. When there is a scant amount of available
protein in the ration, the meat is dry, nearly tasteless, and contains less of the soluble
nitrogenous compounds which impart flavor and individuality.

133. Lard is prepared from the fat of swine, and is separated from associated tissue by the
action of heat. A large amount of fat is found lining the back of the abdominal cavity, and
this is known as leaf lard. Slight differences are noticeable in the composition and quality
of lard made from different parts of the hog. Leaf lard is usually considered the best. Lard
is composed of the three fats, olein, stearin, and palmatin, and has a number of characteristic
physical properties, as specific gravity, melting point, iodine absorption number, as well
as behavior with various reagents, and these enable the mixing of other fats with lard to be
readily detected. Lard is used in the preparation of oleomargarine, and it is also combined
with various vegetable oils, as cotton-seed oil, in the making of imitation or compound lards.[46]
Lard substitutes differ little in general composition from pure lard, except in the structure
of the crystals and the percentage of the various individual fats.

134. Texture and Toughness of Meats.--In discussing the texture of meats, Professor Woods states:[45]

     "Whether meats are tough or tender depends upon two things: the
     character of the walls of the muscle tubes and the character of the
     connective tissues which bind the tubes and muscles together. In
     young and well-nourished animals the tube walls are thin and
     delicate, and the connective tissue is small in amount. As the
     animals grow older or are made to work (and this is particularly
     true in the case of poorly nourished animals), the walls of the
     muscle tubes and the connective tissues become thick and hard. This
     is the reason why the flesh of young, well-fed animals is tender
     and easily masticated, while the flesh of old, hard-worked, or
     poorly fed animals is often so tough that prolonged boiling or
     roasting seems to have but little effect on it.

     "After slaughtering, meats undergo marked changes in texture. These
     changes can be grouped under three classes or stages. In the first
     stage, when the meat is just slaughtered, the flesh is soft, juicy,
     and quite tender. In the next stage the flesh stiffens and the meat
     becomes hard and tough. This condition is known as rigor mortis,
     and continues until the third stage, when the first changes of
     decomposition set in. In hot climates the meat is commonly eaten in
     either the first or second stage. In cold climates it is seldom
     eaten before the second stage, and generally, in order to lessen
     the toughness, it is allowed to enter the third stage, when it
     becomes soft and tender, and acquires added flavor. The softening
     is due in part to the formation of lactic acid, which acts upon the
     connective tissue. The same effect may be produced, though more
     rapidly, by macerating the meat with weak vinegar. Meat is
     sometimes made tender by cutting the flesh into thin slices and
     pounding it across the cut ends until the fibers are broken."

135. Influence of Cooking upon the Composition of Meats.[47]--It is believed by many that losses
are prevented and the nutritive value conserved when, in the cooking of meat, it is placed
directly into boiling water rather than into cold water and then brought to the boiling point
and cooked. Extensive experiments have been made by Dr. Grindley in regard to this and other
points connected with the cooking of meats, and in general it was found that the temperature
of the water in which the meat was placed made little difference in its nutritive value or
the amount of material extracted. It was found that by both methods there was dissolved 2.3
percent of the protein matter, 1 percent of the nitrogenous extractives, 1.6 per cent of non-nitrogenous
material, and 0.8 per cent of ash, of the raw meat, which was equivalent to about 13 per cent
of the total proteid material and 81 percent of the ash. The cold water extract contained bodies
coagulated by heat. Cold water did not extract any of the fat, but during the process of cooking,
appreciable amounts were lost mechanically. Cooked meats were found to be less soluble in cold
water than raw meats. During the process of boiling, meat shrinks in weight about 40 or 45
per cent, depending mainly upon the size of the pieces and the content of fat. The loss in
weight is practically a loss of water, and the loss of nutrients, all told, amounts to about
4 per cent, or more, depending upon the mechanical loss.[48] But slight differences were found
in the composition of the meats cooked three and five hour periods.

     "Careful study in this laboratory has shown that when meat is
     cooked in water at 80° to 85° C., placing meat in hot or cold water
     at the start has little effect on the amount of nutrients in the
     meat which passes into the broth. The meat was in the form of
     cubes, one to two inches, and in pieces weighing from one to two
     pounds.

     "It is commonly supposed that when meat is plunged into boiling
     water, the albumin coagulates and forms a crust, which prevents the
     escape of nutritive materials into the broth. It is also believed
     that if a rich broth is desired, to be used either as a soup or
     with the meat as a stew, it is more desirable to place the meat in
     cold water at the start. From the results of these experiments,
     however, it is evident that, under these conditions, there can be
     little advantage in using hot or cold water at the beginning. When
     meats were cooked by dry heat, as in roasting, a larger amount of
     nutrients was rendered soluble in water than during boiling. The
     losses of nutrients were much smaller when meats were cooked by dry
     heat than when cooked in water, being on the average, water 35 per
     cent, nitrogenous extractives 9 per cent, non-nitrogenous
     extractives 17 per cent, fat 7 per cent, ash 12 per cent, and a
     small loss of protein."

The nutrients in the broth of the meat started in hot water amounted to about 1 per cent of
protein, 1 per cent of fat, and O.5 per cent of ash, the amount of nutrients being directly
proportional to the length of time and temperature of the cooking. In general, the larger the
pieces, the smaller the losses. Beef that has been used in the preparation of beef tea loses
its extractive materials, which impart taste and flavor, but there is only a small loss of
actual nutritive value. Clear meat broth contains little nutriment--less than unfiltered broth.
Most of the nitrogenous material of the broth is in the form of creatin, sarkin, and xanthin,
nitrogenous extractives or amid substances having a much lower food value than proteids. Experiments
show that some of these extractives have physiological properties slightly stimulating in their
action, and it is believed the stimulating effect of a meat diet is in part due to these.[49]
They are valuable principally for imparting taste and flavor, and cannot be regarded as nutrients.
The variations in taste and flavor of meats from different sources are due largely to differences
in extractive material.

     "In general, the various methods of cooking materially modify the
     appearance, texture, and flavor of meat, and hence its
     palatability, but have little effect on total nutritive value.
     Whether it be cooked in hot water, as in boiling or stewing, or by
     dry heat, as in roasting, broiling, or frying, meat of all kinds
     has a high food value, when judged by the kind and amount of
     nutrient ingredients which are present." [50]

Beef extracts of commerce contain about 50 per cent of extractive matters, as amids, together
with smaller amounts of soluble proteids; ash, mainly added salt, is also present in liberal
amounts (20 per cent). Beef extracts have condimental value imparting taste and flavor, which
make them useful for soup stocks, but they furnish little in the way of nutritive substance.

136. Miscellaneous Meat Products.--By combining different parts of the same animal, or different
meats, a large number of products known as sausage are made. These vary in composition with
the ingredients used. In general, they are richer in fat than beef and contain about the same
amount of protein. Potato flour and flour from cereals are sometimes used in their preparations,
but the presence of any material amount, unless so stated on the package, is considered an
adulterant.

Pickled meats are prepared by the use of condiments, as salt, sugar, vinegar, and saltpeter.
During the smoking and curing of meats, no appreciable losses of nutrients occur.[51] The smoke
acts as a preservative, and imparts condimental properties. Saltpeter (potassium nitrate) has
been used from earliest times in the preparation of meats; it preserves color and delays fermentation
changes. When used in moderate amounts it cannot be regarded as a preservative or injurious
to health. Excessive amounts, however, are objectionable. Smoked meats, prepared with or without
saltpeter, give appreciable reactions for nitrites, compounds formed during combustion of the
wood by which the meat was smoked. Many vegetables contain naturally much larger amounts of
nitrates, taken from the soil as food, than meat that has been preserved with saltpeter.[52]

137. Poultry.--The refuse and waste from chickens, as purchased on the market, ranges from
15 to 30 per cent. The fat content is much lower than in turkeys or ducks, the largest amount
being found in geese. The edible portion of all fowls is rich in protein, particularly the
dark meat, and the food value is about equal to that of meat in general. When it is desired
to secure a large amount of protein with but little fat, chicken supplies this, perhaps, better
than any other animal food. A difference is observed in the composition of the meat of young
and old fowls similar to that between beef and veal. The physical composition and, to a slight
extent, the solubility of the proteids are altered by prolonged cold storage, the difference
being noticeable mainly in the appearance of the connective tissue of the muscles. In discussing
poultry as food, Langworthy states:[53]

     "A good, fresh bird shows a well-rounded form, with neat, compact
     legs, and no sharp, bony angles on the breast, indicating a lack of
     tender white meat. The skin should be a clear color (yellow being
     preferred in the American market) and free from blotches and pin
     feathers; if it looks tight and drawn, the bird has probably been
     scalded before being plucked. The flesh should be neither flabby
     nor stiff, but should give evenly and gently when pressed by the
     finger."

138. Fish.--From 30 to 60 per cent of the weight of fresh fish is refuse. The edible portion
contains from 35 to 50 per cent, and in some cases more, of water. The dry matter is rich in
protein; richer than many meats. The nutrients in fish range between comparatively wide limits,
the protein in some cases being as low as 6 per cent, in flounder, and in others as high as
30 per cent, in dried codfish. The amount of fat, except in a few cases, as salmon and trout,
is small. Salmon is the richest in fat of any of the fishes. When salted and preserved, the
proportion of water is lessened and that of the nutrients is increased. Fish can take the place
of meat in the dietary, but it is necessary to add a larger amount of fat to the ration because
of the deficiency of most fish in this ingredient. Fish has about the same digestibility as
meats. It is believed by many to be valuable because it supplies a large amount of available
phosphates. Analyses, however, show that the flesh of fish contains no more phosphorus compounds
than meats in general, and its food value is due to protein rather than to phosphates.[54]

Fish appears to be as completely and easily digested as meats. Differences in flavor, taste,
and palatability are due to small amounts of flavors and extractive materials, varying according
to the food consumed by the fish and the conditions under which they lived. The flesh of fish
decays more readily than that of other meats and produces ptomaines, or toxic substances, which
are the result of fermentation changes usually associated with putrefaction. Cases of poisoning
from eating unsound fish are not infrequent.[55]

Shellfish have about the same general composition as fish. In clams there is a larger amount
of dry matter than in oysters, which contain about 12 per cent, half of which is protein. When
placed in fresh water, the oyster increases in size and undergoes the process known as "fattening."
Oftentimes impure water is used for this purpose, which makes the eating of raw oysters a questionable
practice from a sanitary point of view, as the water in which they are floated often contains
disease-producing germs, as typhoid. During the process of fattening, although the oyster increases
in size and weight, it decreases in percentage of nutrients. In discussing the composition
of oysters, Atwater states:[7]

     "They come nearer to milk than almost any other food material as
     regards both the amounts and relative proportions of nutrients."

139. Eggs, General Composition.--Eggs are a type of concentrated nitrogenous food. About 75
per cent (shell removed) is water, about one third is yolk, and a little over 50 per cent is
albumin or white. The shell makes up from 10 to 12 per cent of the weight. The yolk and white
differ widely in composition. The yolk contains a much larger per cent of solids than the white,
and is rich in both fat and protein, from a third to a half of the weight being fat. The white
has about the same amount of water, 88 per cent, as average milk, but, unlike milk, the dry
matter is mainly albumin. The entire egg (edible portion) contains about equal parts of fat
and protein; 12 to 13 per cent of each and an appreciably large amount of ash or mineral matter,--from
0.8 to 1 per cent, consisting mainly of phosphates associated with the albumin. There is no
material difference in chemical composition between white and dark shelled eggs, or between
eggs with different colored yolks. It is simply a question of coloring matter. The egg is influenced
to an appreciable extent by feed and general care of the fowls. The egg and the potato contain
about the same amount of water. They are, however, distinct types of food, the potato being
largely composed of carbohydrates and the egg of protein and fat. Eggs resemble meat somewhat
in general composition, although they contain rather less of protein and fat. When eggs are
boiled there is a loss of weight due to elimination of water; otherwise the composition is
unaltered, the coagulation of the albumin, as stated in Chapter I, consisting simply in a rearrangement
of the atoms of the molecule. The egg is particularly valuable in the dietary of the convalescent,
when it is desired to secure the maximum amount of phosphorus in organic combination.

The flavor of eggs is in part due to the food supplied to the fowls, as well as the age of
the egg. Experiments show that onions and some other vegetables, when fed to fowls, impart
odors and taste to the eggs. The keeping qualities of eggs are also dependent upon the food
supplied. In experiments at the Cornell Experiment Station, when hens were fed on a narrow,
nitrogenous ration, a large number of eggs were produced containing the minimum amount of solid
matter and of poor keeping quality, while a larger sized egg of better keeping quality was
obtained when a variety of foods, nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous, was supplied.

140. Digestibility of Eggs.--Digestion experiments show that there is but little difference
in the digestibility of eggs cooked in different ways. A noticeable difference, however, is
observed in the rapidity with which the albumin and proteids are dissolved in a pepsin solution.
In general, it was found that, when the albumin was coagulated at a temperature of 180°, it
was more rapidly and completely dissolved in the pepsin than when coagulated at a temperature
of 212°. When eggs were cooked at a temperature of 212°, the hard-boiled eggs appeared to be
slightly more digestible than the soft-boiled eggs, but the digestion was not as complete as
when the cooking was done at a temperature of 180°; then no difference in digestibility was
found between eggs cooked for a short or a long time. The egg is one of the most completely
digested of all foods, practically all the protein and fat being absorbed and available to
the body. Langworthy, in discussing Jorissenne's investigations on the digestibility of eggs,
states:[53]

     "The yolk of raw, soft-boiled, and hard-boiled eggs is equally
     digestible. The white of soft-boiled eggs, being semi-liquid,
     offers little more resistance to the digestive juices than raw
     white. The white of a hard-boiled egg is not generally very
     thoroughly masticated. Unless finely divided, it offers more
     resistance to the digestive juices than the fluid or semi-fluid
     white, and undigested particles may remain in the digestive tract
     many days and decompose. From this deduction it is obvious that
     thorough mastication is a matter of importance. Provided
     mastication is thorough, marked differences in the completeness of
     digestion of the three sorts of eggs, in the opinion of the writer
     cited, will not be found."

141. Use of Eggs in the Dietary.--When eggs are at the same price per dozen as meat is per
pound, they furnish a larger amount of nutrients. In general, a dozen eggs have a little higher
food value than a pound of meat. Eggs are usually a cheaper source of food because a smaller
amount is served than of meat. When eggs are 25 cents per dozen, the cost of ten eggs for a
family of five is less than that of a pound or a pound and a quarter of beef at 22 cents per
pound. The meat, however, would furnish the larger amount of nutrients. Eggs are valuable,
too, in the dietary because they are frequently combined with flour, cereal products, and vegetables,
which contain a large amount of starch, and some of which contain small amounts of protein.
This combination furnishes a balanced ration, as well as secures palatability and good mechanical
combination of the foods. Eggs in combination with flour, sugar, butter, and other materials
have equally as great a value as when used alone and as a substitute for meat.

Eggs vary in weight from 17.5 to 28 ounces, and more per dozen. They should be purchased and
sold by weight. When stored, eggs lose weight. The egg cannot be considered as entirely germ
proof, and care is necessary in its handling and use, the same as with other food articles.
The cause of the spoiling of eggs is due largely to exterior bacterial infection.

CANNED MEATS

142. General Composition.--Canned meats differ but little in composition from fresh meats.
Usually during the process of cooking and canning there is a slight increase in the amount
of dry matter, but the relative proportion of protein and fat is about the same as in fresh
meat. It is frequently stated that the less salable parts are used in the preparation of canned
meats, as it is possible by cooking and the addition of condiments to conceal the inferior
physical properties. As to the accuracy of these statements, the author is unable to say. The
shrinkage or loss in weight during canning amounts to from 30 to 40 per cent. The liquids in
which the cooking and parboiling are done are sometimes used in the preparation of beef extracts.
Salt, saltpeter, and condiments are generally added during the canning process. Saltpeter is
used, as it assists in retaining the natural color and prevents some objectionable fermentation
changes. In moderate amounts it is not generally considered an adulterant. An extensive examination
by Wiley and Bigelow of packing-house products and preserved meats showed that of the latter
only a small amount contained objectionable preservatives. The authors, after an extended investigation,
reported favorably upon their composition and sanitary value, saying they found "so little
to criticise and so much to commend in these necessary products." In this bulletin they do
not classify saltpeter as an adulterant.[51]

Where fresh meats cannot be secured, canned meats are often indispensable. Usually the nutrients
of canned meats cost more than those of fresh meats, and in their use as food much care should
be exercised to prevent contamination after opening the cans. Occasionally the meat contains
ferment materials that have not been entirely destroyed during cooking, and these, when the
cans are stored in warm places, develop and cause deleterious changes to occur. Consequently
canned meats should be stored at a low temperature. By recent congressional act, these preparations
are now made under the supervision of government inspectors. All diseased animals are rejected,
and the sanitary conditions under which the meat is prepared have been greatly improved. Formerly,
the most frequent forms of adulteration were substitution of one meat for another, as the mixing
of veal with chicken, and the use of preservatives, as borax and sulphites. While the cost
of the nutrients in canned meats is generally much higher than in fresh meats, the latter are
not always easily obtained, or capable of being kept for any length of time, and hence canned
meats are often indispensable.

CHAPTER IX

CEREALS

143. Preparation and Cost of Cereals.--The grains used in the preparation of cereal foods are
wheat, oats, corn, rice, and, to a less extent, barley and rye. For some of these the entire
cleaned grain is ground or pulverized, while for others the bran and germ are first removed.
In order to improve their keeping qualities, they are often sterilized before being put up
in sealed packages. Special treatment, as steaming or malting, is sometimes given to impart
palatability and to lessen the time required for cooking. As a class, the cereal foods are
clean, nutritious, and free from adulteration. Extravagant claims are sometimes made as to
their food value, and frequently excessive prices are charged, out of proportion to the cost
of the nutrients in the raw material. Within recent years the number of cereal preparations
has greatly increased, due to improvements and variations in the methods of manufacture.[56]

Cereal foods are less expensive than meats and the various animal food products. They contain
no refuse, are easily prepared for the table, and may be kept without appreciable deterioration.
Some of the ready--to-eat brands are cooked, dried, and crushed, and sugar, glucose, salt,
and various condimental materials added to impart taste. Others contain malt, or are subjected
to a malting or germinating process to develop the soluble carbohydrates, and such foods are
sometimes called predigested. It is believed that the cereals are being more extensively used
in the dietary, which is desirable both from an economic and a nutritive point of view. Special
care is necessary in the cooking and preparation of cereals for the table, in order to develop
flavor and bring about hydration and rupturing of the tissues, as explained in Chapter II.

144. Corn Preparations.--Corn or maize is characterized by a high percent of fat and starch,
and, compared with wheat and oats, a low content of protein.[57] Removal of the bran and germ
lessens the per cent of fat. The germ is removed principally because it imparts poor keeping
qualities. Many of the corn breakfast foods contain 1 per cent or less of fat and from 8 to
9 per cent of protein. Coarsely ground corn foods are not as completely digested and assimilated
as those more finely ground. As in the case of wheat products, the presence of the bran and
germ appears to prevent the more complete absorption of the nutrients. Finely ground corn meal
compares favorably in digestibility with wheat flour. Corn flour is prepared by removal of
the bran and germ and granulation of the more starchy portions of the kernel, and has better
keeping qualities than corn meal from which the bran and germ have not been so completely removed.
At times corn flour has been sufficiently low in price to permit its use for the adulteration
of wheat flour. The mixing of corn and wheat flours, however, is prohibited by law unless the
product is so labeled. When combined with wheat flour, corn bread and various other articles
of food are prepared, but used alone corn flour is not suitable for bread making, because its
gluten lacks the binding properties imparted to wheat flour by the gliadin. It is essential
that corn be used with foods of high protein content so as to make a balanced ration; for when
it forms a large part of the dietary, the ration is apt to be deficient in protein. In a mixed
dietary, corn is one of the cheapest and best cereals that can be used. Too frequently, however,
excessive prices are charged for corn preparations that contain no more nutrients than ordinary
corn meal. There is no difference between yellow and white corn meal so far as nutritive value
is concerned.

145. Oat Preparations are characterized by large amounts of both protein and fat. Because of
the removal of the hulls, they contain more protein than the original grain. The oat preparations
differ little in chemical composition. They all have about 16 per cent of protein, 7 per cent
of fat, and 65 per cent of starch, and are richer in ash or mineral matter than other cereals.
The main difference is in method of preparation and mechanical composition. Some are partially
cooked and then dried. Those costing 7 cents or more per pound do not contain any greater amount
of nutritive substance than those purchased in bulk at about half the price. At one time it
was believed that oats contained a special alkaloid having a stimulating effect when fed to
animals. Recent investigations, however, show that there is no alkaloidal material in oats,
and whatever stimulating effect they may have results from the nutrients they contain. Occasionally
there is an appreciable amount of cellulose, or fiber, left in the oat preparations, due to
imperfect milling. This noticeably lowers the digestibility. Oatmeal requires much longer and
more thorough cooking than many other cereals, and it is frequently used as food when not well
prepared. Digestion experiments show that when oatmeal is cooked for four hours or more, it
is more readily acted upon by the diastase ferment and digested in a shorter time than oatmeal
cooked only a half hour.[5] Oatmeal is one of the cheapest sources from which protein is obtained,
and when well cooked it can advantageously form an essential part of the ration. Unless thoroughly
cooked, the oat preparations do not appear to be quite so completely or easily digested as
some of the other cereals.

146. Wheat Preparations differ in chemical composition more than those from oats or corn, because
wheat is prepared in a greater variety of ways. They are made either from the entire kernel,
including the bran and germ, or from special parts, as the granular middlings, as in the case
of some of the breakfast foods, and a few are made into a dough and baked, then dried and toasted.
Some special flours are advertised as composed largely of gluten, but only those that have
been prepared by washing out the starch are entitled to be classed as gluten flours.[58] For
the food of persons suffering from diabetes mellitus physicians advise the use of flour low
in starch, and this can be made by washing and thus removing a portion of the starch from wheat
flour, as directed in Experiment No. 30. The glutinous residue is then used for preparing articles
of food. Analyses of some of the so-called gluten flours show that they contain no more gluten
than ordinary flour, particularly the low grades. A number of wheat breakfast foods are prepared
by sterilizing the flour middlings obtained after removal of the bran and germ. These middlings
are the same stock or material from which the patent grades of flour are made, and they differ
from wheat flour only in mechanical structure and size of the particles. Where granular wheat
middlings can be secured in bulk at the same price as flour they furnish a valuable and cheap
cereal breakfast food.

As to the digestibility and food value, the wheat breakfast foods have practically the same
as graham, entire wheat, or ordinary patent flour, depending upon the stock which they contain.
Those with large amounts of bran and germ are not as completely digested as when these parts
of the kernel are not included. Wheat preparations, next to oats, have the most protein of
any of the cereal foods. Occasionally they are prepared from wheats low in gluten and not suitable
for bread-making purposes. When purchased in bulk the wheat preparations are among the cheapest
foods that can be used in the dietary.[56]

147. Barley Preparations are not so extensively used as wheat, oats, and corn. Barley contains
a little more protein than corn, but not quite so much as wheat; otherwise it is quite similar
to wheat in general composition. Sometimes in the preparation of breakfast foods barley meal
is mixed with wheat or corn. Barley is supposed to be more readily digested than some of the
other cereals, because of the presence of larger amounts of active ferment bodies, and it is
frequently used for making an extract known as "barley water," which, although it contains
very little nutritive value, as less than one per cent of the weight of the barley is rendered
soluble, is useful in its soothing influence and mechanical action upon the mucous membrane
of the digestive tract.

148. Rice Preparations.--Rice varies somewhat in composition, but usually contains a slightly
lower percentage of protein than corn and also a smaller amount of fat. It is particularly
rich in starch, and has the least ash or mineral matter of any of the cereals. In order to
make a balanced ration, rice should be supplemented with legumes and other foods rich in proteids.
It is a valuable grain, but when used alone it is deficient in protein. Rice is digested with
moderate ease, but is not as completely absorbed by the body as other cereals, particularly
those prepared by fine grinding or pulverization. Of late years rice culture has been extensively
introduced into some of the southern states, and the domestic rice seems to have slightly higher
protein content than the imported. Rice contains less protein than other cereals, and the starch
grain is of different construction. Rice does not require such prolonged cooking as oatmeal;
it needs, however, to be thoroughly cooked.

149. Predigested Foods.[56]

     "It is questionable whether it would be of advantage to a healthy
     person to have his food artificially digested. The body under
     normal conditions is well adapted to utilize such foods as the
     ordinary mixed diet provides, among them the carbohydrates from the
     cereals. Moreover, it is generally believed that for the digestive
     organs, as for all others of the body, the amount of exercise they
     are normally fitted to perform is an advantage rather than the
     reverse. It has been said that 'a well man has no more need of
     predigested food than a sound man has for crutches.' If the
     digestive organs are out of order, it may be well to save them
     work, but troubles of digestion are often very complicated affairs,
     and the average person rarely has the knowledge needed to prescribe
     for himself. In general, those who are well should do their own
     work of digestion, and those who are ill should consult a competent
     physician."--WOODS AND SNYDER.

150. The Value of Cereals in the Dietary.--Cereals are valuable in the dietary because of the
starch and protein they supply, and the heat and energy they yield. They are among the most
inexpensive of foods and, when properly prepared, have a high degree of palatability; then,
too, they are capable of being blended in various ways with other foods. Some are valuable
for their mechanical action in digestion, rather than for any large amount of nutrients. They
do not furnish the quantity of mineral matter and valuable phosphates that is popularly supposed.
They all contain from 0.5 to 1.5 percent of mineral matter, of which about one third is phosphoric
anhydrid. In discussing the phosphate content of food, Hammersten states:[59]

     "Very little is known in regard to the need of phosphates or
     phosphoric acid.... The extent of this need is most difficult to
     determine, as the body shows a strong tendency, when increased
     amounts of phosphorus are introduced, to retain more than is
     necessary. The need of phosphates is relatively smaller in adults
     than in young developing animals."

In the coarser cereals, which include the bran and germ, there is the maximum amount of mineral
matter, but, as in the case of graham bread, it is not as completely digested and absorbed
by the body as the more finely granulated products which contain less. The kind of cereal to
use in the dietary is largely a matter of personal choice. As only a small amount is usually
eaten at a meal, there is little difference in the quantity of nutrients supplied by the various
breakfast cereals.

CHAPTER X

WHEAT FLOUR

151. Use for Bread Making.--Wheat is particularly adapted to bread-making purposes because
of the physical properties of the gliadin, one of its proteids. It is the gliadin which, when
wet, binds together the flour particles, enabling the gas generated during bread making to
be retained, and the loaf to expand and become porous. Wheat varies in chemical composition
between wide limits; it may contain as high as 16 per cent of protein, or as low as 8 per cent;
average wheat has from 12 to 14 per cent; and with these differences in composition, the bread-making
value varies.

152. Winter and Spring Wheat Flours.--There are two general classes of wheat: spring wheat
and winter wheat. The winter varieties are seeded in the fall, and the spring varieties, which
are grown mainly in the Northwestern states, Minnesota, and North and South Dakota, and the
Canadian Northwest, are seeded in the spring and mature in the late summer. Winter wheat is
confined to more southern latitudes and regions of less severe winter, and matures in the early
summer. There are many varieties of both spring and winter wheat, although wheats are popularly
characterized only as hard or soft, depending upon the physical properties. The winter wheats
are, as a rule, more soft and starchy than the spring wheats, which are usually corneous or
flinty to different degrees. There is a general tendency for wheats to become either starchy
or glutinous, owing to inherited individuality of the seed and to environment. There are often
found in the same field wheat plants yielding hard glutinous kernels, and other plants producing
starchy kernels containing 5 per cent less proteids. Wheats of low protein content do not make
high-grade flour; neither do wheats of the maximum protein content necessarily make the best
flour. For a more extended discussion of wheat proteids, the student is referred to Chapter XI.

153. Composition of Wheat and Flour.--In addition to 12 to 14 per cent proteids, wheat contains
72 to 76 per cent of starch and small amounts of other carbohydrates, as sucrose, dextrose,
and invert sugar. The ash or mineral matter ranges from 1.7 to 2.3 per cent. There is also
about 2 per cent fiber, 2.25 per cent ether extract or crude fat, and about 0.2 per cent organic
acids.

154. Roller Process of Flour Milling.--Flours vary in composition, food value, and bread-making
qualities with the character of the wheat and the process of milling employed. Prior to 1870
practically all wheat flour was prepared by grinding the wheat between millstones; but with
the introduction of the roller process, steel rolls were substituted for millstones.[60] By
the former process a smaller amount of flour was secured from the wheat, but with the present
improved systems about 75 per cent of the weight of the grain is recovered as merchantable
flour and 25 per cent as wheat offals, bran, and shorts[61].

The wheat is first screened and cleaned, then passed on to the corrugated rolls, or the first
break, where it is partially flattened and slightly crushed and a small amount of flour, known
as the break flour, is separated by means of sieves, while the main portion is conveyed through
elevators to the second break, where the kernels are more completely flattened and the granular
flour particles are partially separated from the bran. The material passes over several pairs
of rolls or breaks, each succeeding pair being set a little nearer together. This is called
the gradual reduction process, because the wheat is not made into flour in one operation. More
complete removal of the bran and other impurities from the middlings is effected by means of
sieves, aspirators, and other devices, and the purified middlings are then passed on to smooth
rolls, where the granulation is completed. The flour finally passes through silk bolting cloths,
containing upwards of 12,000 meshes per square inch. The dust and fine débris particles are
removed at various points in the process. The granulation of the middlings is done after the
impurities are removed, the object being first to separate as perfectly as possible the middlings
from the branny portions of the kernel. If the wheat were first ground into a fine meal, it
would be impossible to secure complete separation of the flour from the offal portions of the
kernel.

Flour milling is entirely a mechanical process; the flour stock passes from roll to roll by
means of elevators. According to the number of reductions which the middlings and stock undergo,
the milling is designated as a long or a short reduction system; the term 4, 6, 8, or 10 break
process means that the stock has been subjected to that number of reductions. With an 8-break
system of milling, the process is more gradual than with a 4-break, and greater opportunity
is afforded for complete removal of the bran. In some large flour mills, the wheat is separated
into forty or more different products, or streams, as they are called, so as to secure a better
granulation and more complete removal of the offals, after which many of these streams are
brought together to form the finished flour. What is known as patent flour is derived from
the reduction of the middlings, while the break flours are recovered before the offals are
completely removed; hence they are not of so high a grade. No absolute definition can be given,
however, of the term "patent flour," as usage varies the meaning in different parts of the country.

155. Grades of Flour.--Flour is the purified, refined, and bolted product obtained by reduction
and granulation of wheat during and after the removal of the branny portions of the wheat kernel.
It is defined by proclamation of the Secretary of Agriculture, under authority of an act of
Congress, as: "Flour is the fine, sound product made by bolting wheat meal, and contains not
more than thirteen and one half (13.5) per cent of moisture, not less than one and twenty-five
hundredths (1.25) per cent of nitrogen, not more than one (1) per cent of ash, and not more
than fifty hundredths (0.50) per cent of fiber."

Generally speaking, flour may be divided into two classes, high grade and low grade. To the
first class belong the first and second patents and, according to some authorities, a portion
of the straight grade, or standard patent flour, and to the second class belong the second
clear and "red dog." About 72 per cent of the cleaned wheat as milled is recovered in the higher
grades of flour, and about 2 or 3 per cent as low grades, a large portion of which is sold
as animal food. The high grades are characterized by a lighter color, more elastic gluten,
better granulation, and a smaller number of débris particles. Although the lower grade flours
contain a somewhat higher percentage of protein, they are not as valuable for bread-making
purposes because the gluten is not as elastic, and consequently they do not make as good bread.
If the impurities from the low grades could be further eliminated, it is believed that less
difference would exist between high and low grade flours.

Various trade names are used to designate flours, as a 95 per cent patent, meaning that 95
per cent of the total flour is included in the patent; or an 85 per cent patent, when 85 per
cent of all the flour is included in that particular patent. If all the flour streams were
purified and blended, and only one grade of flour made, it would be called a 100 per cent patent.
An 85 per cent patent is a higher grade flour than a 95 per cent patent.

156. Composition of Flour.--The composition of the different grades of flour made from the
same wheat is given in the following table:[62]

[Footnote A: Straight flour includes the first and second patents and first clear grade.]

In the table it will be noted that there is a gradual increase in protein content from first
patent to "red dog," the largest amount being in the "red dog" flour. Although "red dog" contains
the most protein, it is by far the poorest flour in bread-making qualities, and in the milling
of wheat often it is not separated from the offals, but is sold as an animal food. It will
also be seen that there is a gradual increase in the ash content from the highest to the lowest
grades of flour, the increase being practically proportional to the grade,--the most ash being
in the lowest grade. The grade to which a flour belongs can be determined more accurately from
the ash content than from any other constituent. Patent grades of flour rarely contain more
than 0.55 per cent of ash,--the better grades less than 0.5 per cent. The more completely the
bran and offals are removed during the process of milling, the lower the per cent of ash. The
ash content, however, cannot be taken as an absolute guide in all cases, as noticeable variations
occur in the amount of mineral matter or ash in different wheats; starchy wheats that have
reached full maturity often contain less than hard wheats grown upon rich soil where the growing
season has been short, and from such wheats a soft, straight flour may have as low a per cent
of ash as a hard first patent flour. When only straight or standard patent flour is manufactured
by a mill, all of the flour is included which would otherwise be designated first and second
patents and first clear.

157. Graham and Entire Wheat Flours.--When the germ and a portion of the bran are retained
in the flour, and the particles are not completely reduced, the product is called "entire wheat
flour." The name does not accurately describe the product, as it includes all of the flour
and only a portion of the bran, and not the entire wheat kernel. Graham flour is coarsely granulated
wheat meal. No sieves or bolting cloths are employed in its manufacture, and many coarse, unpulverized
particles are present in the product[62].

158. Composition of Wheat Offals.--Bran and shorts are characterized by a high percentage of
fiber, or cellulose. The ash, fat, and protein content of bran are all larger than of flour.
The protein, however, is not in the form of gluten, but is largely albumin and globulins,[16]
which are mainly in the aleurone layer of the wheat kernel, and are inclosed in branny capsules,
and consequently are in a form not readily digested by man.

The germ is generally included in the shorts, although occasionally it is removed for special
commercial purposes. It is sometimes sterilized and used in breakfast food products. The germ
is rich in oil and is excluded from the flour mainly because it has a tendency to become rancid
and to impart to the flour poor keeping qualities. Wheat oil has cathartic properties, and
it is believed the physiological action of whole wheat and graham bread is in part due to the
oil. The germ is also rich in protein, mainly in the form of globulins and proteoses. A dough
cannot be made of pure germ, because it contains so little of the gliadin and glutenin.

159. Aging and Curing of Flour.--Flours well milled and made from high-grade, cleaned wheat
generally improve in bread-making value when stored in clean, ventilated warehouses for periods
of three to six months[9]. High-grade flour becomes drier and whiter and produces bread of
slightly better quality when properly cured by storage. If the flour is in any way unsound,
it deteriorates during storage, due to the action of ferment bodies. Wheat also, when properly
cleaned and stored, improves in milling and bread-making value. Certain enzymic changes appear
to take place which are beneficial. Wheats differ materially from year to year in bread-making
value, and those produced in seasons when all the conditions for crop growth are normal do
not seem to be so much improved by storing and aging, either of the wheat or the flour, as
when the growing season has been unfavorable. When wheat is stored, specific changes occur
in both the germ and the cells of the kernel; these changes are akin to the ripening process,
and appear to be greater if, for any reason, the wheat has failed to fully mature or is abnormal
in composition.

The flour yield of wheat is in general proportional to the weight per bushel of the grain,
well-filled, heavy grain producing more flour than light grain.[61] The quality of the flour,
however, is not necessarily proportional to the weight of the grain. It is often necessary
to blend different grades and types of wheat in order to secure good flour.

160. Macaroni Flour is made from durum wheat, according to Saunders a variety of hard, spring
wheat. It is best grown in regions of restricted rainfall. Durum and other varieties of hard
spring wheat grown under similar conditions, differ but little in general chemical composition,
except that the gluten of durum appears to have a different percentage of gliadin and glutenin,
and the flour has a more decided yellow color. Durum wheats are not generally considered as
valuable for bread making as other hard wheat. They differ widely in bread-making value, some
being very poor, while others produce bread of fair quality.[68]

161. Color.--The highest grades of flour are white in color, or of a slight creamy tinge. Dark-colored,
slaty, and gray flours are of inferior quality, indicating a poor grade of wheat, poor milling,
or a poor quality of gluten. Flours, after being on the market for a time, bleach a little
and improve to a slight degree in color. Color is one of the characteristics by which the commercial
value of flour is determined; the whiter the flour, the better the grade, provided other properties
are equal[9]. The color, however, should be a pure or cream white. Some flours have what is
called a dead white color, and, while not objectionable as far as color is concerned, they
are not as valuable for bread-making and general commercial purposes. One of the principal
trade requirements of a flour is that it possess a certain degree of whiteness and none of
the objectionable shades mentioned.

To determine the color of a flour, it is compared with a standard. If it is a winter wheat
flour, one of the best high-grade winter patents to be found on the market is selected, and
the sample in question is compared with this; if it is a spring wheat patent flour, one of
the best spring wheat patent grades is taken as the standard. In making the comparison, the
flours should be placed side by side on a glass plate and smoothed with the flour trier, the
comparison being made preferably by a north window. Much experience and practice are necessary
in order to determine with accuracy the color value of a flour.

162. Granulation.--The best patent grades of flour contain an appreciable amount of granular
middlings, which have a characteristic "feel" similar to fine, sharp sand. A flour which has
no granular feeling is not usually considered of the highest grade, but is generally a soft
wheat flour of poor gluten. However, a flour should not be too coarsely granulated. The percentage
amounts of the different grades of stock in a flour can be approximately determined by means
of sieves and different sized bolting cloths. To test a flour, ten grams are placed in a sieve
containing a No. 10 bolting cloth; with a camel's-hair brush and proper manipulation, the flour
is sieved, and that which passes through is weighed. The percentage amount remaining on the
No. 10 cloth is coarser middlings. Nearly all high-grade flours leave no residue on the No.
10 cloth. The sifted flour from the No. 10 cloth is also passed through Nos. 11, 12, 13, and
14 cloths[63]. In this way the approximate granulation of any grade of flour may be determined,
and the granulation of an unknown sample be compared with that of a standard flour. In determining
the granulation of a flour, if there are any coarse or discolored particles of bran or dust,
they should be noted, as it is an indication of poor milling. When the flour is smoothed with
a trier, there should be no channels formed on the surface of the flour, due to fibrous impurities
caught under the edge of the trier. A hand magnifying glass is useful for detecting the presence
of abnormal amounts of dirt or fibrous matter in the flour.

163. Capacity of Flour to absorb Water.--The capacity of a flour to absorb water is determined
by adding water from a burette to a weighed amount of flour until a dough of standard consistency
is obtained. Low absorption is due to low gluten content. A good flour should absorb from 60
to 65 per cent of its weight of water. In making the test, it is advisable to determine the
absorption of a flour of known baking value at the same time that an unknown flour is being
tested. Flours of low absorption do not make breads of the best quality; also there are a smaller
number of loaves per barrel, and the bread dries out more readily.

164. Physical Properties of Gluten.--The percentages of wet and dry gluten in a flour are determined
as outlined in Experiment No. 27. Flours of good character should show at least 30 per cent
moist gluten and from 10 to 12 per cent dry gluten. The quality of a flour is not necessarily
proportional to its gluten content, although a flour with less than 10-1/2 per cent of dry
gluten will not make the best quality of bread, and flours with excessive amounts are sometimes
poor bread makers. The color of the gluten is also important; it should be white or creamy.
The statements made in regard to color of flour apply also to color of the gluten. A dark,
stringy, or putty-like gluten is of little value for bread-making purposes.[64] In making the
gluten test, it is advisable to compare the gluten with that from a flour of known bread-making
value. Soft wheat flours have a gluten of different character from hard wheat flours.

165. Gluten as a Factor in Bread Making.--The bread-making value of a flour is dependent upon
the character of the wheat and the method of milling. It is not necessarily dependent upon
the amount of gluten, as the largest volume and best quality of bread are often made from flour
of average rather than maximum gluten content. But flours with low gluten do not produce high-grade
breads. When a flour contains more than 12 or 13 per cent of proteids, any increase does not
necessarily mean added bread-making value. The quality of the gluten, equally with the amount,
determines the value for bread-making purposes.

166. Unsoundness.--A flour with more than 14 per cent of moisture is liable to become unsound.
High acidity also is an indication of unsoundness or of poor keeping qualities. The odor of
a sample of flour should always be carefully noted, for any suggestion of fermentation sufficient
to affect the odor renders the flour unsuited for making the best bread. Any abnormal odor
in flour is objectionable, as it is due to contamination of some sort, and most frequently
to fermentation changes. A musty odor is always an indication of unsoundness. Some flours which
have but a slight suggestion of mustiness will, when baked into bread, have it more pronounced;
on the other hand, some odors are removed during bread making. Flours may absorb odors because
of being stored in contaminated places or being shipped in cars in which oil or other ill-smelling
products with strong odors have previously been shipped. Unsoundness is often due to faulty
methods in handling, as well as to poor wheat, or to lack of proper cleaning of the wheat or flour.

167. Comparative Baking Tests.--To determine the bread-making value of a flour, comparative
baking tests, as outlined in Experiment No. 29, are made; the flour in question is thus compared
as to bread-making value with a flour of known baking quality. In making the baking tests,
the absorption of the flour, the way in which it responds in the doughing process, and the
general properties of the dough, are noted. The details should be carried out with care, the
comparison always being made with a similar flour of known baking value, and the bread should
be baked at the same time and under the same conditions as the standard. The color of the bread,
the size and weight of the loaf, and its texture and odor, are the principal characteristics
to be noted.

The quality of flour for bread-making purposes is not strictly dependent upon any one factor,
but appears to be the aggregate of a number of desirable characteristics. The commercial grade
of a flour can be accurately determined from the color, granulation, absorption, gluten and
ash content, and the quality of the bread. Technical flour testing requires much experience
and a high degree of skill.

168. Bleaching.--In the process of manufacture, flours are often subjected to air containing
traces of nitrogen peroxide gas, generated by electrical action and resulting in the union
of the oxygen and nitrogen of the air. This whitens and improves the color of the flour. Bleached
flours differ neither in chemical composition nor in nutritive value from unbleached flours,
except that bleached flours contain a small amount (about one part to one million parts of
flour) of nitrite reacting material, which is removed during the process of bread making. The
amount of nitrites produced in flour during bleaching is less than is normally present in the
saliva, or is found naturally in many vegetable foods, or in smoked or cured meats, or in bread
made from unbleached flour and baked in a gas oven where nitrites are produced from combustion
of the gas. The bleaching of flour cannot be regarded as in any way injurious to health or
as adulteration, and a bleached flour which has good gluten and bread-making qualities is entirely
satisfactory. It is not possible to successfully bleach low-grade flours so they will resemble
the high grades, because the bran impurities of the low grades blacken during bleaching and
become more prominent. Alway, of the Nebraska Experiment Station, has shown that there is no
danger to apprehend from over-bleaching, for when excess of the bleaching reagent is used,
flours become yellow in color[65]. Similar results have been obtained at the Minnesota Experiment
Station. As bleaching is not injurious to health, and as it is not possible through bleaching
to change low grades so as to resemble the patent grades, bleaching resolves itself entirely
into the question of what color of flour the consumer desires. Pending the settlement of the
status of bleaching the practice has been largely discontinued.

169. Adulteration of Flour.--Flour is not easily adulterated, as the addition of any foreign
material interferes with the expansion and bread-making qualities and hence is readily detected.
The mixing of other cereals, as corn flour, with wheat flour has been attempted at various
times when wheat commanded a high price, but this also is readily detected, by microscopic
examination, as the corn starch and wheat starch grains are quite different in mechanical structure.
Such flours are required to be labeled, in accord with the congressional act of 1898, when
Congress passed, in advance of the general pure food bill, an act regulating the labeling and
sale of mixed and adulterated flours. Various statements have been made in regard to the adulteration
of flour with minerals, as chalk and barytes, but such adulteration does not appear to be at
all general.

170. Nutritive Value of Flour.--From a nutritive point of view, wheat flour and wheat bread
have a high value.[66] A larger amount of nutrients can be secured for a given sum of money
in the form of flour than of any other food material except corn meal. According to statistics,
the average per capita consumption of wheat in the United States is about 4-1/2 bushels, or,
approximately, one barrel per year, and from recent investigations it would appear that the
amount of flour used in the dietary is on the increase. According to the Bureau of Labor, flour
costs the average laborer about one tenth as much as all other foods combined, although he
secures from it a proportionally larger amount of nutritive material than from any other food.

CHAPTER XI

BREAD AND BREAD MAKING

171. Leavened and Unleavened Bread.--To make unleavened bread the flour is moistened and worked
into a stiff dough, which is then rolled thin, cut into various shapes, and baked, forming
a brittle biscuit or cracker.

The process of making raised or leavened bread consists, in brief, of mixing the flour and
water in proper proportions for a stiff dough, together with some salt for seasoning, and yeast
(or other agent) for leavening. The moistened gluten of the flour forms a viscid, elastic,
tenacious mass, which is thoroughly kneaded to distribute the yeast. The dough is then set
in a warm place and the yeast begins to grow, or "work," causing alcoholic fermentation, with
the production of carbon dioxid gas, which expands the dough, or causes it to "rise," thus
rendering it porous. After the yeast has grown sufficiently, the dough is baked in a hot oven,
where further fermentation is stopped because of destruction of the yeast by the heat, which
also causes the gas to expand the loaf and, in addition, generates steam. The gas and steam
inflate the tenacious dough and finally escape into the oven. At the same time the gluten of
the dough is hardened by the heat, and the mass remains porous and light, while the outer surface
is darkened and formed into a crust.

When the flour is of good quality, the dough well prepared, and the bread properly baked, the
loaf has certain definite characteristics. It should be well raised and have a thin, flinty
crust, which is not too dark in color nor too tough, but which cracks when broken; the crumb,
as the interior of the loaf is called, should be porous, elastic, and of uniform texture, without
large holes, and should have good flavor, odor, and color.

Meal or flour from any of the cereals may be used for unleavened bread, but leavened bread
can be made only from those that contain gluten, a mixture of vegetable proteids which when
moistened with water becomes viscid, and is tenacious enough to confine the gas produced in
the dough. Most cereals, as barley, rice, oats, and corn, some of which are very frequently
made into forms of unleavened bread, are deficient or wholly lacking in gluten, and hence cannot
be used alone for making leavened bread. For the leavened bread, wheat and rye, which contain
an abundance of gluten, are best fitted, wheat being in this country by far the more commonly used.

172. Changes during Bread Making.--In bread making complex physical, chemical, and biological
changes occur. Each chemical compound of the flour undergoes some change during the process.
The most important changes are as follows[64]:

1. Production of carbon dioxid gas, alcohol, and soluble carbohydrates as the result of ferment
action.

2. Partial rupturing of the starch grains and formation of a small amount of soluble carbohydrates
due to the action of heat.

3. Production of lactic and other organic acids.

4. Formation of volatile carbon compounds, other than alcohol and carbon dioxid.

5. Change in the solubility of the gluten proteins, due to the action of the organic acids
and fermentation.

6. Changes in the solubility of the proteids due to the action of heat, as coagulation of the
albumin and globulin.

7. Formation and liberation of a small amount of volatile, nitrogenous compounds, as ammonia
and amids.

8. Partial oxidation of the fat.

173. Loss of Dry Matter during Bread Making.--As many of the compounds formed during bread
making are gases resulting from fermentation action, and as these are volatile at the temperature
of baking, appreciable losses necessarily take place. Experiments show about 2 per cent of
loss of dry matter under ordinary conditions. These losses are not confined to the carbohydrates
alone, but also extend to the proteids and other compounds. When 100 pounds of flour containing
10 per cent of water and 90 per cent of dry matter are made into bread, the bread contains
about 88 pounds of dry matter. In exceptional cases, where there has been prolonged fermentation,
the losses exceed 2 per cent[64].

174. Action of Yeast.--Yeast is a monocellular plant requiring sugar and other food materials
for its nourishment. Under favorable conditions it rapidly increases by budding, and as a result
produces the well-known alcoholic fermentation. It requires mineral food, as do plants of a
higher order, and oftentimes the fermentation process is checked for want of sufficient soluble
mineral food. The yeast plant causes a number of chemical changes to take place, as conversion
of starch to a soluble form and alcoholic fermentation.

  C{6}H{10}O{5} + H{2}O = C{6}H{12}O{6}.

  C{6}H{12}O{6} = 2 C{2}H{5}OH + 2 CO{2}.

Alcoholic fermentation cannot occur until the starch has been converted into dextrose sugar.
The yeast plant is destroyed at a temperature of 131° F. It is most active from 70° to 90°
F. At a low temperature it is less active, and when it freezes the cells are ruptured. A number
of different kinds of fermentation are associated with the growth of the yeast plant, and there
are many varieties of yeast, some of which are more active than others. For bread making an
active yeast is desirable to prevent the formation of acid bodies. If the work proceeds quickly,
the rising process is completed before the acid fermentation is far advanced. If fermentation
is too prolonged, some of the products of the yeast plant impart an undesirable taste and odor
to the bread, and hinder the development of the gluten and expansion of the loaf.

175. Compressed Yeast.--The yeast most commonly used in bread making is compressed yeast, a
product of distilleries. The yeast floating on the surface of the wort is skimmed off and that
remaining is allowed to settle to the bottom, and is obtained by running the wort into shallow
tanks or settling trays. It is then washed with cold water, and the impurities are removed
either by sieving through silk or wire sieves, or, during the washing, by fractional precipitation.
The yeast is then pressed, cut into cakes, and wrapped in tinfoil. When fresh, it is of uniform
creamy color, moist, and of a firm, even texture[18]. It should be kept cold, as it readily
decomposes.

176. Dry Yeast is made by mixing starch or meal with fresh yeast until a stiff dough is formed.
This is then dried, either in the sun or at a moderate temperature, and cut into cakes. By
drying, many of the yeast cells are rendered temporarily inactive, and so it is a slower acting
leaven than the compressed yeast. A dry yeast will keep indefinitely.

177. Production of Carbon Dioxid Gas and Alcohol.--Carbon dioxid and alcohol are produced in
the largest amounts of any of the compounds formed during bread making. When the alcoholic
ferments secreted by the yeast plant act upon the invert sugars and produce alcoholic fermentation,
carbon dioxid is one of the products formed. Ordinarily about 1 per cent of carbon dioxid gas
is generated and lost during bread making. About equal weights of carbon dioxid and alcohol
are produced during the fermentation. In baking, the alcohol is vaporized and aids the carbon
dioxid in expanding the dough and making the bread porous. If all of the moisture given off
during bread making be collected it will be found that from a pound loaf of bread there are
about 40 cubic centimeters of liquid; when this is submitted to chemical analysis, small amounts
of alcohol are obtained. Alcoholic fermentation sometimes fails to take place readily, because
there are not sufficient soluble carbohydrates to undergo inversion, or other food for the
yeast plant. Starch cannot be converted directly into alcohol and carbon dioxid gas; it must
first be changed into dextrose sugars, and these undergo alcoholic fermentation. Bread gives
no appreciable reaction for alcohol even when fresh.[64]

If the gluten is of poor quality, or deficient in either gliadin or glutenin, the dough mass
fails to properly expand because the gas is not all retained. The amount of gas formed is dependent
upon temperature, rapidity of the ferment action, and quality of the yeast and flour. If the
yeast is inactive, other forms of fermentation than the alcoholic may take place and, as a
result, the dough does not expand. Poor yeast is a frequent cause of poor bread.

The temperature reached in bread making is not sufficient to destroy all the ferment bodies
associated with the yeast, as, for example, bread sometimes becomes soft and stringy, due to
fermentation changes after the bread has been baked and stored. Both bread and flour are subject
to many bacterial diseases, and one of the objects of thorough cleaning of the wheat and removal
of the bran and débris particles during the process of flour manufacture is to completely eliminate
all ferment bodies mechanically associated with the exterior of the wheat kernel, which, if
retained in the flour, would cause it readily to become unsound.

178. Production of Soluble Carbohydrates.--Flour contains naturally a small amount of soluble
carbohydrates, which are readily acted upon by the alcoholic ferments. The yeast plant secretes
soluble ferments, which act upon the starch, forming soluble carbohydrates, and the heat during
baking brings about similar changes. In fact, soluble carbohydrates are both consumed and produced
by ferment action during the bread-making process. Flour contains, on an average, 65 per cent
of starch, and during bread making about 10 per cent is changed to soluble forms. Bread, on
a dry matter basis, contains approximately 6 per cent of soluble carbohydrates, including dextrine,
dextrose, and sucrose sugars.[64]

The physical changes which the starch grains undergo are also noticeable. Wheat starch has
the structure shown in illustration No. 33. The starch grains are circular bodies, concave,
with slight markings in the form of concentric rings. When the proteid matter of bread is extracted
with alcohol and the starch grains are examined, it will, be seen that some of them are partially
ruptured, like those in popped corn, while others have been slightly acted upon or eaten away
by the organized ferments, the surface of the starch grains being pitted, as shown in the illustration.
The joint action of heat and ferments on the starch grains changes them physically so they
may more readily undergo digestion. The brown coating or crust formed upon the surface of bread
is mainly dextrine, produced by the action of heat on the starch. Dextrine is a soluble carbohydrate,
having the same general composition as starch, but differing from it in physical properties
and ease of digestion.

179. Production of Acids in Bread Making.--Wheat bread made with yeast gives an acid reaction.
The acid is produced from the carbohydrates by ferment action. Flour contains about one tenth
of 1 per cent of acid; the dough contains from 0.3 to 0.5 per cent, while the baked bread contains
from 0.14 to 0.3 per cent, but after two or three days slightly more acid is developed.[64]
During the process of bread making, a small portion of the acid is volatilized, but the larger
part enters into chemical combination with the gliadin, forming an acid proteid. When the alcoholic
fermentation of bread making becomes less active, acid fermentations begin, and sour dough
results. It is not definitely known what specific organic acids are developed in bread making.
Lactic and butyric acids are known to be formed, and for purposes of calculation, the total
acidity is expressed in terms of lactic acid.

The acidity is determined by weighing 20 grams of flour into a flask, adding 200 cubic centimeters
of distilled water, shaking vigorously, and leaving the flour in contact with the water for
an hour; 50 cubic centimeters of the filtered solution are then titrated with a tenth normal
solution of potassium hydroxid. Phenolphthalein is used as the indicator. It cannot be said
that all of the alkali is used for neutralizing the acid, as a portion enters into chemical
combination with the proteids. If the method for determining the acid be varied, constant results
are not secured. Unsound or musty flours usually show a high per cent of acidity.

180. Volatile Compounds produced during Bread Making.--In addition to carbon dioxid and alcohol,
there is lost during bread making a small amount of carbon in other forms, as volatile acids
and hydrocarbon products equivalent to about one tenth of one per cent of carbon dioxid. The
aroma of freshly baked bread is due to these compounds. Both the odor and flavor of bread are
caused in part by the volatile acids and hydrocarbons. The amount and kind of volatile products
formed can be somewhat regulated through the fermentation process by the use of special flours
and the addition of materials that produce specific fermentation changes and desirable aromatic
compounds. Some of the ferment bodies left in flour from the imperfect removal of the dirt
adhering to the exterior of the wheat kernels impart characteristic flavors to the bread. The
so-called nutty flavor of some bread is due to the action of these ferment bodies and, when
intensified, it becomes objectionable. Fungous growths in unsound flour and bread result in
the liberation of volatile products, which impart a musty odor. Good odor and flavor are very
desirable in both flour and bread.

181. Behavior of Wheat Proteids in Bread Making.--Gluten is an ingredient of the flour on which
its bread-making properties largely depend. The important thing, however, is not entirely the
quantity of gluten, but more particularly its character. Two flours containing the same amounts
of carbohydrates and proteid compounds, when converted into bread by exactly the same process,
may produce bread of entirely different physical characteristics because of differences in
the nature of the gluten of the two samples. Gluten is composed of two bodies called gliadin
and glutenin. The gliadin, a sort of plant gelatin, is the material which binds the flour particles
together to form the dough, thus giving it tenacity and adhesiveness; and the glutenin is the
material to which the gliadin adheres. If there is an excess of gliadin, the dough is soft
and sticky, while if there is a deficiency, it lacks expansive power. Many flours containing
a large amount of gluten and total proteid material and possessing a high nutritive value,
do not yield bread of the best quality, because of an imperfect blending of the gliadin and
glutenin. This question is of much importance in the milling of wheats, especially in the blending
of the different types of wheat. An abnormally large amount of gluten does not yield a correspondingly
large loaf.

Experiments were made at the Minnesota Experiment Station to determine the relation between
the nature of the gluten and the character of the bread. This was done by comparing bread from
normal flour with that from other flour of the same lot, but having part or all of its gliadin
extracted.[64] Dough made from the latter was not sticky, but felt like putty, and broke in
the same way. The yeast caused the mass to expand a little when first placed in the oven; then
the loaf broke apart at the top and decreased in size. When baked it was less than half the
size of that from the same weight of normal flour, and decidedly inferior in other respects.
The removal of part of the gliadin produced nearly the same effect as the extraction of the
whole of it, and even when an equal quantity of normal flour was mixed with that from which
part of the gliadin had been extracted, the bread was only slightly improved. In flour of the
highest bread-making properties the two constituents, gliadin and glutenin, are present in
such proportions as to form a well-balanced gluten.

The proteids of wheat flour are mainly in an insoluble form, although there are small amounts
of albumins and globulins; these are coagulated by the action of heat during the bread-making
process, and rendered insoluble. A portion of the acid that is developed unites with the gliadin
and glutenin, forming acid proteids, which change the physical properties of the dough. Both
gliadin and glutenin take important parts in bread making. The removal of gliadin from flour
causes complete loss of bread-making properties. Ordinarily from 45 to 65 per cent of the total
nitrogen of the flour is present in alcohol soluble or gliadin form. Proteids also undergo
hydration during mixing, some water being chemically united with them, changing their physical
properties. This hydration change is necessary for the full development of the physical properties
of the gluten. The water and salt soluble proteids appear to take no important part in the
bread-making process, as their removal in no way affects the size of the loaf or general character
of the bread. Because of the action of the acids upon the gliadin, bread contains a larger
amount of alcohol soluble nitrogen or gliadin than the flour from which the bread was made.
It is believed that this action changes the molecular structure of the protein so that it is
more readily separated into its component parts when it undergoes digestion and assimilation.

182. Production of Volatile Nitrogenous Compounds.--When fermentation is unnecessarily prolonged,
an appreciable amount of nitrogen is volatilized in the form of ammonia and allied bodies,
as amids. During the process of bread making, the yeast appears to act upon the protein, as
well as upon the carbohydrates, and, as previously stated, losses of dry matter fall alike
upon these two classes of compounds, nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous. Analyses of the flours
and materials used in bread making, and of the bread, show that ordinarily about 1.5 per cent
of the total nitrogen is liberated in the form of gas during the bread-making process, and
analyses of the gases dispelled in baking show approximately the same per cent of nitrogen.
When bread is dried, as in a drying oven, a small amount of volatile nitrogen appears to be
given off,--probably as ammonium compounds formed during fermentation. The nitrogen lost in
bread making under ordinary conditions is not sufficient to affect the nutritive value of the
product. The losses of both nitrogen and carbon are more than offset by the increased solubility
of the proteids and carbohydrates, the preliminary changes they have undergone making them
more digestible and valuable for food purposes. The nitrogen volatilized in bread making appears
to be mainly that present in the flour in amid forms or liberated as the result of fermentation
processes. The more stable proteids undergo only limited changes in solubility and are not
volatilized.

183. Oxidation of Fat.--Flour contains about 1.25 per cent of fat mechanically mixed with a
small amount of yellow coloring matter. During the process of bread making the fat undergoes
slight oxidation, accompanied by changes in both physical and chemical properties. The fat
from bread, when no lard or shortening has been added, is darker in color, more viscous, less
soluble in ether, and has a lower iodine number, than fat from flour. The change in solubility
of the fat is not, however, such as to affect food value, because the fat is not volatilized,
and is only changed by the addition of a small amount of oxygen from the air. When wheat fat
and other vegetable and animal fats are exposed to the air, they undergo changes known as aging,
similar to the slight oxidation changes in bread making.[64]

184. Influence of the Addition of Wheat Starch and Gluten to Flour.--Ten per cent or more of
starch may be added to normal flour containing a well-balanced gluten, without decreasing the
size of the loaf. When moist gluten was added to flour, thus increasing the total amount of
gluten, the size of the loaf was not increased[67].

INFLUENCE OF ADDITION OF STARCH AND GLUTEN TO FLOUR

  =====================================================================
                                           | SIZE OF LOAF    | WEIGHT
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Wheat flour, 14 ounces                   | 22-1/2 × 17-1/2 | 18.75
  Wheat flour, 10% wheat starch            | 23-1/2 × 17     | 18.25
  Wheat flour, 12.2% wheat starch          | 21-1/2 × 17     | 18.00
                                           |                 |
  Wheat flour, 210 grams, about 8 ounces   | 12-3/4 × 9      | 12.00
  Wheat flour, 10% gluten added, 210 grams | 12-1/2 × 9      | 12.75
  Wheat flour, 20% gluten added            | 12 × 8-3/4      | 13.00
  =====================================================================

So long as the quality of the gluten is not destroyed, the addition of a small amount of either
starch or gluten to flour does not affect the size of the loaf, but removal of the gluten affects
the moisture content and physical properties of the bread. The addition of starch to flour
has the same effect upon the bread as the use of low gluten flour,--lessening the capacity
of the flour to absorb water and producing a dryer bread of poorer quality.

185. Composition of Bread.--The composition of bread depends primarily upon that of the flour
from which it was made. If milk and butter (or lard) are used in making the dough, as is commonly
the case, their nutrients are, of course, added to those of the flour; but when only water
and flour are used, the nutrients of the bread are simply those of the flour. In either case
the amount of nutrients in the bread is smaller than in the same weight of flour, because a
considerable part of the water or milk used in making the dough is present in the bread after
baking; that is, a pound of bread contains less of any of the nutrients than a pound of the
flour from which the bread was made, because the proportion of water in the bread is greater.
The following table shows how the composition of flour compares with that of bread, the different
kinds of bread all having been made from the flour with which they are compared:

COMPOSITION OF FLOUR, AND BREAD MADE FROM IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS

  =====================================================================
         MATERIAL                   | WATER | PROTEIN | FAT| C.H.| ASH
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    |   %   |    %    |  % |  %   |  %
  Flour                             | 10.11 |  12.47  |0.86|76.09 |0.47
  Bread from flour and water        | 36.12 |   9.46  |0.40|53.70 |0.32
  Bread from flour, water, and lard | 37.70 |   9.27  |1.02|51.70 |0.31
  Bread from flour and skim milk    | 36.02 |  10.57  |0.48|52.63 |0.30
  =====================================================================

Thus it may be seen that the proportion of water is larger and of each nutrient smaller in
bread than in flour, and that the nutrients of the flour are increased by those in the materials
added in making the bread.

It is apparent that two breads of the same lot of flour may differ, according to the method
used in making, and also that two loaves of bread made by exactly the same process but from
different lots of flour, even when of the same grade or brand, do not necessarily have the
same composition, because of possible variation in the flours. In bread made from flour of
low gluten content, the per cent of protein is correspondingly low.

186. Use of Skim Milk and Lard in Bread Making.--When flours low in gluten are used, skim milk
may be employed advantageously in making the bread, to increase the protein content. Tests
show that such bread contains about 1 per cent more protein than that made with water. Ordinarily
there is no gain from a nutritive point of view in adding an excessive amount of lard or other
shortening, as it tends to widen the nutritive ratio.

187. Influence of Warm and Cold Flours on Bread Making.--When flour is stored in a cold closet
or storeroom, it is not in condition to produce a good quality of bread until it has been warmed
to a temperature of about 70° F. Cold flour checks the fermentation process, and is occasionally
the cause of poor bread. On the other hand, when flour is too warm (98° F.) the influence upon
fermentation is unfavorable. Heating of flour does not affect the bread-making value, provided
the flour is not heated above 158° F. and is subsequently cooled to a temperature of 70° F.
Wheat flour contains naturally a number of ferment substances, some of which are destroyed
by the action of heat. The natural ferments, or enzymes, of flour appear to take a part in
bread making, imparting characteristic odors and flavors to the product.

188. Variations in the Process of Bread Making.--Since flours differ so in chemical composition,
and the yeast plant acts upon all the compounds of flour, it naturally follows that bread making
is not a simple but a complex operation, resulting in a number of intricate chemical reactions,
which it is necessary to control and many of which are only imperfectly understood. Bread of
the best physical quality and commercial value is made of flour from fully matured, hard wheats,
containing a low per cent of acid, no foreign ferment materials or their products, and at least
12-1/2 per cent of proteids, of which the larger portion is in the form of gliadin. It is believed
that a better quality of bread could be produced from many flours by slight changes or modifications
in the process of bread making. It cannot be expected that the same process will give the best
results alike with all types and kinds of flour. The kind of fermentation process that will
produce the best bread from a given type of flour can be determined only by experimentation.
Poor bread making is due as often to lack of skill on the part of the bread maker, and to poor
yeast, as it is to poor quality of flour. Frequently the flour is blamed when the poor bread
is due to other factors. Lack of control of the fermentation process, and the consequent development
of acid and other organisms which check the activity of the alcoholic ferments, is a frequent
cause of poor bread.

189. Digestibility of Bread.--Extensive experiments have been made by the Office of Experiment
Stations of the United States Department of Agriculture, at the Minnesota and Maine Experiment
Stations, to determine the digestibility and nutritive value of bread. Different kinds and
types of wheat were milled so as to secure from each three flours: graham, entire wheat, and
standard patent. The flours were made into bread, and the bread fed to workingmen, and its
digestibility determined. The experiments taken as a whole show that bread is an exceedingly
digestible food, nearly 98 per cent of the starch or carbohydrate nutrients and about 88 per
cent of the gluten or proteid constituents being assimilated by the body. In the case of the
graham and entire wheat flours, although they contained a larger total amount of protein, the
nutrients were not as completely digested and absorbed by the body as were those of the white
flour. The body secured a larger amount of nutrients from the white than from the other grades
of flour, the digestibility of the three types being as follows: standard patent flour, protein
88.6 per cent and carbohydrates 97.7 per cent; entire wheat flour, protein 82 percent and carbohydrates
93.5 per cent; graham flour, protein 74.9 per cent and carbohydrates 89.2 per cent. The low
digestibility of the protein of the graham and entire wheat flours is supposed to be due to
the coarser granulation; the proteins, being embedded and surrounded with cellular tissue,
escape the action of the digestive fluids. Microscopic examination of the feces showed that
often entire starch grains were still inclosed in the woody coverings and consequently had
failed to undergo digestion.[62], [64], [67], [86]

190. Use of Graham and Entire Wheat in the Dietary.--Entire wheat and graham flours should
be included in the dietary of some persons, as they are often valuable because of their physiological
action, the branny particles stimulating the process of digestion and encouraging peristaltic
action. In the diet of the overfed, they are valuable for the smaller rather than the larger
amount of nutrients they contain. Also they supply bulk and give the digestive tract needed
exercise. For the laboring man, where it is necessary to obtain the largest amount of available
nutrients, bread from white flour should be supplied; in the dietary of the sedentary, graham
and entire wheat flours can, if found beneficial, be made to form an essential part. The kind
of bread that it is best to use is largely a matter of personal choice founded upon experience.

     "When we pass on to consider the relative nutritive values of white
     and whole-meal bread, we are on ground that has been the scene of
     many a controversy. It is often contended that whole-meal is
     preferable to white bread, because it is richer in proteid and
     mineral matter, and so makes a better balanced diet. But our
     examination of the chemical composition of whole-meal bread has
     shown that as regards proteid at least, this is not always true,
     and even were it the case, the lesser absorption of whole-meal
     bread, which we have seen to occur, would tend to annul the
     advantage.... On the whole, we may fairly regard the vexed question
     of whole-meal versus white bread as finally settled and settled
     in favor of the latter."[28]

     "The higher percentage of nitrogen in bran than in fine flour has
     frequently led to the recommendation of the coarser breads as more
     nutritious than the finer. We have already seen that the more
     branny portions of the grain also contain a much larger percentage
     of mineral matter. And, further, it is in the bran that the largest
     proportion of fatty matter--the non-nitrogenous substance of higher
     respiratory capacity which the wheat contains--is found. It is,
     however, we think, very questionable whether upon such data alone
     a valid opinion can be formed of the comparative values of bread
     made from the finer or courser flours ground from one and the same
     grain. Again, it is an indisputable fact that branny particles when
     admitted into the flour in the degree of imperfect division in
     which our ordinary milling processes leave them very considerably
     increase the peristaltic action, and hence the alimentary canal is
     cleared much more rapidly of its contents. It is also well known
     that the poorer classes almost invariably prefer the whiter bread,
     and among some of those who work the hardest and who consequently
     soonest appreciate a difference in nutritive quality (navvies, for
     example) it is distinctly stated that their preference for the
     whiter bread is founded on the fact that the browner passes through
     them too rapidly; consequently, before their systems have extracted
     from it as much nutritious matter as it ought to yield them.... In
     fact, all experience tends to show that the state as well as the
     chemical composition of our food must be considered; in other
     words, that the digestibility and aptitude for assimilation are not
     less important qualities than its ultimate composition.

     "But to suppose that whole-wheat meal as ordinarily prepared is, as
     has generally been assumed, weight for weight more nutritious than
     ordinary bread flour is an utter fallacy founded on theoretical
     text-book dicta, not only entirely unsupported by experience, but
     inconsistent with it. In fact, it is just the poorer fed and the
     harder working that should have the ordinary flour bread rather
     than the whole-meal bread as hitherto prepared, and it is the
     overfed and the sedentary that should have such whole-meal bread.
     Lastly, if the whole grain were finely ground, it is by no means
     certain that the percentage of really nutritive nitrogenous matters
     would be higher than in ordinary bread flour, and it is quite a
     question whether the excess of earthy phosphates would not then be
     injurious."--LAWES AND GILBERT.[68]

       *       *       *       *       *

     "According to the chemical analysis of graham, entire wheat, and
     standard patent flours milled from the same lot of hard Scotch Fife
     spring wheat, the graham flour contained the highest and the
     patent flour the lowest percentage of total protein. But according
     to the results of digestion experiments with these flours the
     proportions of digestible or available protein and available energy
     in the patent flour were larger than in either the entire wheat or
     the graham flour. The lower digestibility of the protein of the
     latter is due to the fact that in both these flours a considerable
     portion of this constituent is contained in the coarser particles
     (bran), and so resists the action of the digestive juices and
     escapes digestion. Thus while there actually may be more protein in
     a given amount of graham or entire wheat flour than in the same
     weight of patent flour from the same wheat, the body obtains less
     of the protein and energy from the coarse flour than it does from
     the fine, because, although the including of the bran and germ
     increases the percentage of protein, it decreases its
     digestibility. By digestibility is meant the difference between the
     amounts of the several nutrients consumed and the amount excreted
     in the feces.

     "The digestibility of first and second patent flours was not
     appreciably different from that of standard patent flour. The
     degree of digestibility of all these flours is high, due largely to
     their mechanical condition; that is, to the fact that they are
     finely ground."--SNYDER.[62]

For a more extended discussion of the subject, the student is referred to Bulletins 67, 101,
and 126, Office of Experiment Stations, United States Department of Agriculture.

191. Mineral Content of White Bread.--Average flour contains from 0.4 to 0.5 of 1 per cent
of ash or mineral matter, the larger portion being lime and magnesia and phosphate of potassium.
It is argued by some that graham and entire wheat flours should be used liberally because of
their larger mineral content and their greater richness in phosphates. In a mixed dietary,
however, in which bread forms an essential part, there is always an excess of phosphates, and
there is nothing to be gained by increasing the amount, as it only requires additional work
of the kidneys for its removal. Few experiments have been made to determine the phosphorus
requirements of the human body, but these indicate that it is unnecessary to increase the phosphate
content of a mixed diet. It is estimated that less than two grams per day of phosphates are
required to meet all of the needs of the body, and in an average mixed ration there are present
from three to five grams and more. A large portion of the phosphate compounds of white bread
is present in organic combinations, as lecithin and nucleated proteids, which are the most
available forms, and more valuable for purposes of nutrition than the mineral phosphates. In
the case of graham and entire wheat flours, a proportionally smaller amount of the phosphates
are digested and assimilated than from the finer grades of flour.

192. Comparative Digestibility of New and Old Bread.--With healthy persons there is no difference
whatever in the completeness of digestibility of old and new bread; one appears to be as thoroughly
absorbed as the other. In the case of some individuals with impaired digestion there may be
a difference in the ease and comfort with which the two kinds of bread are digested, but this
is due mainly to individuality and does not apply generally. The change which bread undergoes
when it is kept for several days is largely a loss of moisture and development of a small amount
of acid and other substances from the continued ferment action.

193. Different Kinds of Bread.--According to variations in method of preparation, there are
different types and varieties of bread, as the "flat bread" of Scandinavian countries, unleavened
bread, Vienna bread, salt rising bread, etc. Bread made with baking powder differs in no essential
way from that made with yeast, except in the presence of the residue from the baking powder,
discussed in Chapter XII. Biscuits, wheat cakes, crackers, and other food materials made principally
from flour, have practically the same food value as bread. It makes but little difference in
what way flour is prepared as food, for in its various forms it has practically the same digestibility
and nutritive value.

194. Toast.--When bread is toasted there is no change in the percentage of total nutrients
on a dry matter basis. The change is in solubility and form, and not in amount of nutrients
available. Some of the starch becomes dextrine, which is more soluble and digestible.[5] Proteids,
on the other hand, are rendered less soluble, which appears to slightly lower the digestion
coefficient. They are somewhat more readily but not quite so completely digested as those of
bread. Digestion experiments show that toast more readily yields to the diastase and other
ferments than does wheat bread. Toasting brings about ease of digestion rather than increased
completeness of the process. Toast is a sterile food, while bread often contains various ferments
which have not been destroyed by baking. These undergo incubation during the process of digestion,
particularly in the case of individuals with diseases of the digestive tract. With normal digestion,
however, these ferment bodies do not develop to any appreciable extent, as the digestive tract
disinfects itself. When the flour is prepared from well cleaned wheat and the ferment substances
which are present mainly in the bran particles have been removed, a flour of higher sanitary
value is secured.

CHAPTER XII

BAKING POWDERS

195. General Composition.--All baking powders contain at least two materials; one of these
has combined carbon dioxid in its composition, the other some acid constituent which serves
to liberate the gas. The material from which the gas is obtained is almost invariably sodium
bicarbonate, NaHCO{3}, commonly known as "soda" or "saleratus." Ammonium carbonate has been
used to some extent, but is very seldom used at the present time. The acid constituent may
be one of several materials, the most common being cream of tartar, tartaric acid, calcium
phosphate, or alum. These may be used separately or in combination. The various baking powders
are designated according to the acid constituent, as "cream of tartar," "phosphate," and "alum"
powders. All of them liberate carbon dioxid gas, but the products left in the food differ widely
in nature and amount[69].

Baking powder is a chemical preparation which, when brought in contact with water, liberates
carbon dioxid gas. The baking powder is mixed dry with flour, and when this is moistened the
carbon dioxid that is liberated expands the dough. The action is similar to that of yeast except
that in the case of yeast the gas is given off much more slowly and no residue is left in the
bread. When baking powder is used, there is a residue left in the food which varies with the
material in the powder. It is the nature and amount of this residue that is important and makes
one baking powder more desirable than another.

196. Cream of Tartar Powders.--The acid ingredient of the cream of tartar powders is tartaric
acid, H{2}C{4}H{4}O{6}. Cream of tartar is potassium acid tartrate, KHC{4}H{4}O{6}; it contains
one atom of replaceable hydrogen, which imparts the acid properties, and it is prepared from
crude argol, a deposit of grape juice when wine is made. The residue from this powder is sodium
potassium tartrate, NaKC{4}H{4}O{6}, commonly known as Rochelle salt. This is the active ingredient
of Seidlitz powders and has a purgative effect when taken into the body. The dose as a purgative
is from one half to one ounce. A loaf of bread as ordinarily made with cream of tartar powder
contains about 160 grains of Rochelle salt, which is 45 grains more than is found in a Seidlitz
powder, but the amount actually eaten at any one time is small and its physiological effect
can probably be disregarded. When a cream of tartar baking powder is used, the reaction takes
place according to the following equation:

          188            84             210              44       18
  HKH{4}C{4}O{6} + NaHCO{3} = KNaC{4}H{4}O{6} + CO{2} + H{2}O.

The crystallized Rochelle salt contains four molecules of water, so that, even allowing for
some starch filler, there is very nearly as much weight of material (Rochelle salt) left in
the food as there was of the original powder. If free tartaric acid were used instead of potassium
acid tartrate, the reaction would be as follows:

          150              168              230                           88
  H{2}C{4}H{4}O{6} + 2NaHCO{3} = Na{2}C{2}H{4}O{6}.2 H{2}O + 2CO{2}.

But the residue, sodium tartrate, is less in proportion. It has physiological properties very
similar to Rochelle salt. Tartaric acid is seldom used alone, but very often in combination
with cream of tartar. It is more expensive than cream of tartar; but not so much is required,
and it is more rapid in action.

197. Phosphate Baking Powders.--Here the acid ingredient is phosphoric acid and the compound
usually employed is mono-calcium phosphate, CaH{4}(PO-{4}){2}. This is made by the action of
sulphuric acid on ground bone (Ca{3}(PO{4}){2} + 2 H{2}SO{4} = CaH{4}(PO{4}){2} + 2 CaSO{4}),
and it is difficult to free it from the calcium phosphate formed at the same time; hence such
powders contain more or less of this inert material. The reaction which occurs with a phosphate
powder is as follows:

       234                 168           136
  CaH{4}(PO{4}){2} + 2 NaHCO{3} = CaHPO{4}

           88         36           142
      + 2 CO{2} + 2 H{2}O + Na{2}HPO{4}.

Sodium phosphate, according to the United States Dispensatory, is "mildly purgative in doses
of from 1 to 2 ounces." The claim is made by the makers of phosphate baking powders that the
phosphates of sodium and calcium, products left after the baking, restore the phosphates which
have been lost from the flour in the bran. This baking powder residue does not restore the
phosphates in the same form in which they are present in grains and it does furnish them in
larger amounts--nearly tenfold. However, the residue from these powders is probably less objectionable
than that from alum powders. The chief drawback to the phosphate powders is their poor keeping
qualities.

198. Alum Baking Powders.--Sulphuric acid is the acid constituent of these powders. The alums
are double sulphates of aluminium and an alkali metal, and have the general formula xAl(SO{4}){2}
in which x may be K, Na, or NH{4}, producing respectively a potash, soda, or ammonia alum.
Potash alum is most commonly used, soda and ammonia alums to a less extent. The reaction takes
place as follows:

           475                 504             157
  2 NH{4}Al(SO{4}){2} + 6 NaHCO{3} = Al{2}(OH){6}

              426                132            264
      + 3 Na{2}SO{4} + (NH{4}){2}SO{4} + 6 CO{2}.

If it is a potash or soda alum, simply substitute K or Na for NH{4} throughout the equation.
The best authorities regard alum baking powders as the most objectionable. Ammonia alum is
without doubt the worst form, since all of the ammonium compounds have an extremely irritating
effect on animal tissue. Sulphates of sodium and potassium are also objectionable. Aluminium
hydroxide is soluble in the slightly acid gastric juice and has an astringent action on animal
tissue, hindering digestion in a way similar to the alum itself. Many of the alum powders contain
also mono-calcium phosphate; the reaction is as follows:

           475                   234                   336
  2 NH{4}Al(SO{4}){2} + CaH{4}(PO{4}){2} + 4 NaHCO{3}

          245              136              132
  = Al{2}(PO{4}){2} + CaSO{4} + (NH{4}){2}SO{4}

           284         176          72
  + 2 Na{2}SO{4} + 4 CO{2} + 4 H{2}O.

These are probably less injurious than the straight alum powders, although the residues are,
in general, open to the same objection.

199. Inspection of Baking Powders.--Many of the states have enacted laws seeking to regulate
the sale of alum baking powders. Some of these laws simply require the packages to bear a label
setting forth the fact that alum is one of the ingredients; others require the baking powder
packages to bear a label naming all the ingredients of the powder.

200. Fillers.--All baking powders contain a filler of starch. This is necessary to keep the
materials from acting before the powder is used. The amount of filler varies from 15 to 50
per cent; the least is found in the tartrate powders and the most in the phosphate powders.
The amount of gas which a powder gives off regulates its value; it should give off at least
1/8 of its weight.

201. Home-made Baking Powders.--Baking powders can be made at home for about one half what
they usually cost and they will give equal satisfaction. The following will make a long-keeping
powder: cream of tartar, 8 ounces; baking soda, 4 ounces; corn starch, 3 ounces. For a quick-acting
powder use but one ounce of starch. The materials should be thoroughly dry. Mix the soda and
starch first by shaking well in a glass or tin can. Add the cream of tartar last and shake
again. Thorough mixing is essential to good results. Cream of tartar is often adulterated,
but it can be obtained pure from a reliable druggist. To insure baking powders remaining perfectly
dry, they should always be kept in glass or tin cans, never in paper.

CHAPTER XIII

VINEGAR, SPICES, AND CONDIMENTS

202. Vinegar.--Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid produced by fermentation, and contains,
in addition to acetic acid, small amounts of other materials in solution, as mineral matter
and malic acid, according to the material from which the vinegar was made. Unless otherwise
designated, vinegar in this country is generally considered to be made from apples. Other substances,
however, are used, as vinegar can be manufactured from a variety of fermentable materials,
as molasses, glucose, malt, wine, and alcoholic beverages in general. The chemical changes
which take place in the production of vinegars are: (1) inversion of the sugar, (2) conversion
of the invert sugars into alcohol, and (3) change of alcohol into acetic acid. All these chemical
changes are the result of ferment action. The various invert ferments change the sugar into
dextrose and glucose sugars; then the alcoholic ferment produces alcohol and carbon dioxid
from the invert sugars, and finally the acetic acid ferment completes the work by converting
the alcohol into acetic acid. It is one of the aerobic ferments, and is present in what is
known as the "mother" of vinegar and is secreted by it. When vinegar is made in quantity, the
process is hastened by allowing the alcoholic solution to pass through a narrow tank rilled
with shavings containing some of the ferment material, and at the same time air is admitted
so as to secure a good supply of oxygen. When vinegar is made by allowing cider or wine to
stand in a warm place until the fermentation process is completed, a long time is required--the
length of time depending upon the supply of air and other conditions affecting fermentation.

In some countries malt vinegar is common. This is produced by allowing a wort made from malt
and barley to undergo acetic acid fermentation, without first distilling the alcohol as is
done in the preparation of spirit vinegar. In various European countries wine vinegar is in
general use and is made by acetification of the juice of grapes. Sometimes spirit vinegar is
made from corn or barley malt. Alcoholic fermentation takes place, the alcohol is distilled
so that a weak solution remains, which is acetified in the ordinary way. Such a vinegar can
be produced very cheaply and is much inferior in flavor to genuine wine or cider vinegar.

Vinegar, when properly made, should remain clear, and should not form a heavy deposit or produce
any large amount of the fungous growth, commonly called the "mother" of vinegar. In order to
prevent the vinegar from becoming cloudy and forming deposits, it should be strained and stored
in clean jugs and protected from the air. So long as air is excluded further acetic acid fermentation
and production of "mother" of vinegar cannot take place. When the vinegar is properly made
and the fermentation process has been completed, the acid already produced prevents all further
development of acetic acid ferments. When vinegar becomes cloudy and produces deposits, it
is an indication that the acetic fermentation has not been completed.

The national standard for pure apple cider vinegar calls for not less than 4 grams acetic acid,
1.6 grams of apple solids, and 0.25 grams of apple ash per 100 cubic centimeters, along with
other characteristics, as acidity, sugar, and phosphoric acid content. Many states have special
laws regarding the sale of vinegar.

203. Adulteration of Vinegar.--Vinegar is frequently adulterated by the addition of water,
or by coloring spirit vinegar, thus causing it to resemble cider vinegar. Formerly vinegar
was occasionally adulterated by the use of mineral acids, as hydrochloric or sulphuric, but
since acetic acid can be produced so cheaply, this form of adulteration has almost entirely
disappeared. Colored spirit vinegar contains merely a trace of solid matter and can be readily
distinguished from cider vinegar by evaporating a small weighed quantity to dryness and determining
the weight of the solids. Occasionally, however, glucose and other materials are added so as
to give some solids to the spirit vinegar, but such a vinegar contains only a trace of ash[18].
Attempts have also been made to carry the adulteration still further by adding lime and soda
to give the colored spirit vinegar the necessary amount of ash. Malt, white wine, glucose,
and molasses vinegars when properly manufactured and unadulterated are not objectionable, but
too frequently they are made to resemble and sell as cider vinegar. This is a fraud which affects
the pocketbook rather than the health. For home use apple cider vinegar is highly desirable.
There is no food material or food adjunct, unless possibly ground coffee and spices, so extensively
adulterated as vinegar.

Vinegar has no food value whatever, and is valuable only for giving flavor and palatability
to other foods, and to some extent for the preservation of foods. It is useful in the household
in other ways, as it furnishes a dilute acid solution of aid in some cooking and baking operations
for liberating gas from soda, and also when a dilute acid solution is required for various
cleaning purposes.

Vinegar should never be kept in tin pails, or any metallic vessel, because the acetic acid
readily dissolves copper, tin, iron, and the ordinary metals, producing poisonous solutions.
Earthenware jugs, porcelain dishes, glassware, or wooden casks are all serviceable for storing
vinegar.

204. Characteristics of Spices.[70]--Spices are aromatic vegetable substances characterized
as a class by containing some essential or volatile oil which gives taste and individuality
to the material. They are used for the flavoring of food and are composed of mineral matter
and the various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous compounds found in all plant bodies. Since
only a comparatively small amount of a spice is used for flavoring purposes, no appreciable
nutrients are added to the food. Some of the spices have characteristic medicinal properties.
Occasionally they are used to such an extent as to mask the natural flavors of foods, and to
conceal poor cooking and preparation or poor quality. For the microscopic study of spices the
student is referred to Winton, "Microscopy of Vegetable Foods," and Leach, "Food Inspection
and Analysis."

205. Pepper.--Black and white pepper are the fruit of the pepper plant (Piper nigrum), a climbing
perennial shrub which grows in the East and West Indies, the greatest production being in Sumatra.
For the black pepper, the berry is picked before thoroughly ripe; for the white pepper, it
is allowed to mature. White pepper has the black pericarp or hull removed. Pepper owes its
properties to an alkaloid, piperine, and to a volatile oil. In the black pepper berries there
is present ash to the extent of about 4.5 per cent, it ought not to be above 6.5 per cent;
ether extract, including piperine and resin, not less than 6.5 per cent; crude fiber not more
than 16 per cent; also some starch and nitrogenous material. The white pepper contains less
ash and cellulose than the black pepper. Ground pepper is frequently grossly adulterated; common
adulterants being: cracker crumbs, roasted nut shells and fruit stones, charcoal, corn meal,
pepper hulls, mustard hulls, and buckwheat middlings. The pepper berries wrinkle in drying,
and this makes it difficult to remove the sand which may have adhered to them. An excessive
amount of sand in the ash should be classed as adulteration. Adulterants in pepper are detected
mainly by the use of the microscope. The United States standard for pepper is: not more than
7 per cent total ash, 15 per cent fiber, and not less than 25 per cent starch and 6 per cent
non-volatile ether extract.[71]

206. Cayenne.--Cayenne or red pepper is the fruit pod of a plant, capsicum, of which there
are several varieties,--the small-fruited kind, used to make cayenne or red pepper; and the
tabasco sort, forming the basis of tabasco sauce. It is grown mainly in the tropics, and was
used there as a condiment before the landing of Columbus, who took specimens back to Europe.
Cayenne pepper contains 25 per cent of oil, about 7 per cent of ash, and a liberal amount of
starch. The adulterants are usually of a starchy nature, as rice or corn meal, and the product
is often colored with some red dye.

207. Mustard.--Mustard is the seed of the mustard plant, and is most often found in commerce
in the ground form. The black or brown mustard has a very small seed and the most aroma. White
mustard is much larger and is frequently used unground. For the ground mustard, only the interior
of the seed is used, the husk being removed in the bolting. Mustard contains a large amount
of oil, part of which is usually expressed before grinding, and this is the form in which spice
grinders buy it. In mustard flour there is: ash from 4 to 6 per cent, volatile oil from 0.5
to 2 per cent, fixed oil from 15 to 25 per cent, crude fiber from 2 to 5 per cent, albuminoids
from 35 to 45 per cent, and a little starch. The principal adulterants are wheat, corn, and
rice flour. When these are used, the product is frequently colored with turmeric, a harmless
vegetable coloring material.

208. Ginger.--Ginger is the rhizome or root of a reed-like plant (Zingiber officinale), native
in tropical Asia, chiefly India. It is cultivated in nearly all tropical countries. When unground
it usually occurs in two forms: dried with the epidermis, or with the epidermis removed, when
it is called scraped ginger. Very frequently a coating of chalk is given, as a protection against
the drug store beetle. Jamaica ginger is the best and most expensive. Cochin, scraped, African,
and Calcutta ginger range in price in the order given. Ginger contains from 3.6 to 7.5 per
cent of ash, from 1.5 to 3 per cent of volatile oil, and from 3 to 5.5 per cent of fixed oil.
There is a large amount of starch. The chief adulterants are rice, wheat, and potato starch,
mustard hulls, exhausted ginger from ginger-ale and extract factories, sawdust and ground peanut-shells,
and turmeric is frequently used for coloring the product. The United States standard for ginger
is not more than 42 per cent starch, 8 per cent fiber, and 6 per cent total ash.[71]

209. Cinnamon and Cassia.--The bark of several species of plants growing in tropical countries
furnishes these spices. True cinnamon is a native of Ceylon, while the cassias are from Bengal
and China. In this country there is more cassia used than cinnamon--cinnamon being rarely found
except in drug stores. Cassia bark is much thicker than cinnamon bark. The ground spice contains
about 1.5 per cent volatile oil and the same amount of fixed oil, 4 per cent of ash, and some
fiber, nitrogenous matter, and starch. Cereals, cedar sawdust, ground nutshells, oil meal,
and cracker crumbs are the chief adulterants.

210. Cloves.--Cloves are the flower buds of an evergreen tree that grows in the tropics. These
are picked by hand and dried in the sun. In the order of value, Penang, Sumatra, Amboyna, and
Zanzibar furnish the chief varieties. Cloves rarely contain more than 8 per cent ash, or less
than 10 per cent volatile oil and 4 per cent fixed oil, and 16 to 20 per cent of tannin-yielding
bodies. No starch is present. The chief adulterants of ground cloves are spent cloves, allspice,
and ground nutshells. Clove stems are also sometimes used and may be detected by a microscopical
examination, since they contain many thick-walled cells and much fibrous tissue.

211. Allspice.--Allspice, or pimento, is the fruit of an evergreen tree common in the West
Indies. It is a small, dry, globular berry, two-celled, each cell having a single seed. Allspice
contains about 2.5 per cent volatile oil, 4 per cent fixed oil, and 4.5 per cent ash. Because
of its cheapness, it is not generally adulterated, cereal starches being the most common adulterants.

212. Nutmeg.--Nutmeg is the interior kernel of the fruit of a tree growing in the East Indies.
The fruit resembles a small pear. A fleshy mantle of crimson color, which is mace, envelopes
the seed. Nutmeg contains about 2.2 per cent ash, 2.5 to 5 per cent volatile oil, and 25 to
35 per cent fixed oil. Mace has practically the same composition. Extensive adulteration is
seldom practiced. The white coating on the surface of the nutmeg is lime, used to prevent sprouting
of the germ.

CHAPTER XIV

TEA, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, AND COCOA

213. Tea is the prepared leaf of an evergreen shrub or small tree cultivated chiefly in China
and Japan. There are two varieties of plants. The Assamese, which requires a very moist, hot
climate, yields in India and Ceylon about 400 pounds per acre, and may produce as high as 1000
pounds. From this plant a number of flushes or pickings are secured in a year. The Chinese
plant grows in cooler climates and has a smaller, tougher, and darker leaf, which is more delicate
than that of the Assamese and is usually made into green tea. The Chinese tea plant yields
only four or five flushes a year. About 40 per cent of the tea used in this country comes from
Japan and 50 per cent from China. The tea industry of India and Ceylon has developed rapidly
in late years, and is now second only to that of China. Tea has been raised upon a small scale
in the United States. The quality or grade of the tea depends upon the leaves used and the
method of curing.

214. Composition of Tea.--Black and green teas are produced from the same species of plant,
but owe their difference in color as well as flavor and odor to methods of preparation. The
same plant may yield several grades of both green and black tea. To produce black tea, the
leaves are bruised to liberate the juices, allowed to ferment a short time, which develops
the color, and then dried.[73] For green tea the fresh leaves are roasted or steamed, then
rolled and dried as quickly as possible to prevent fermentation. The smaller leaves and the
first picking produce the finest quality of tea. The characteristic flavor and odor of tea
are imparted by a volatile oil, although the odor is sometimes altered by the tea being brought
in contact with orange flowers, jessamine, or the fragrant olive. There are also present in
tea an alkaloid, theine, which gives the peculiar physiological properties, and tannin, upon
which depends largely the strength of the tea infusion. The composition of tea is as follows:

  ===========================================
                    |ORIGINAL| GREEN | BLACK
                    |  TEA   |  TEA  |  TEA
  -------------------------------------------
  Tannin, per cent  |  12.91 | 10.64 |  4.89
  Theine, per cent  |   3.30 |  3.20 |  3.30
  Ash, per cent     |   4.97 |  4.92 |  4.93
  Fiber, per cent   |  10.44 | 10.06 | 10.07
  Protein, per cent |  37.33 | 37.43 | 38.90
    (all insoluble) |        |       |
  ===========================================

It will be noticed that green tea contains twice as much tannin as black tea; during the fermentation
which the black tea undergoes, some of the tannin is decomposed. There is a large amount of
protein in tea, but it is of no food value, because of its insolubility. About half of the
ash is soluble. The tannin is readily soluble, and for this reason green tea especially should
be infused for a very short time and never boiled. Tannin in foods in large amounts may interfere
with the normal digestion of the protein compounds, because it coagulates the albumin and peptones
after they have become soluble, and thus makes additional work for the digestive organs.

215. Judging Teas.--Teas are judged according to: (1) the tea as it appears prepared for market,
(2) the infusion, and (3) the out-turn after infusion. The color should be uniform; if a black
tea, it should be grayish black, not a dead black. The leaves should be uniform in size or
grade. The quality and grade are dependent upon flavor, and, with the strength of the infusion,
are determined by tasting. This work is rapidly done by the trained tea taster. The out-turn
should be of one color; no bright green leaves should be present; evenness of make is judged
by the out-turn. The flavor of a tea is largely a matter of personal judgment, but from a physiological
point of view black teas are given the preference.

216. Adulteration of Tea.--A few years ago tea was quite extensively adulterated, but the strict
regulation of the government regarding imported tea has greatly lessened adulteration. The
most common form was the use of spent leaves, i.e. leaves which had been infused. Leaves of
the willow and other plants which resemble tea were also used, as well as large quantities
of tea stems. Facing or coloring is also an adulteration, since it is done to give poor or
damaged tea a brighter appearance. "Facing consists in treating leaves damaged in manufacture
or which from age are inferior, with a mixture containing Prussian blue, turmeric, indigo,
or plumbago to impart color or gloss, and with a fraudulent intent. There is no evidence that
the facing agents are deleterious to health in the small quantities used, but as they are used
for purposes of deception, they should be discouraged."[73] Facing and the addition of stems
are the chief adulterations practiced at present.

217. Food Value and Physiological Properties of Tea.--Tea infusion does not contain sufficient
nutrients to entitle it to be classed as a food. It is with some persons a stimulant. The caffein
or theine in tea is an alkaloid that has characteristic physiological properties. In doses
of from three to five grains, according to the United States Dispensatory, "it produces peculiar
wakefulness." Larger doses produce intense physical restlessness, mental anxiety, and obstinate
sleeplessness. "It has no effect upon the motor nerves, but is believed to have a visible effect
upon the sensatory nerves." (United States Dispensatory.) Experiments with animals show that
it causes elevation of the arterial pressure. It is used as a cardiac stimulant. The quantity
of theine consumed in a cup of tea is about 4/5 of a grain, or 1/4 of a medicinal dose.

218. Composition of Coffee.--The coffee tree is an evergreen cultivated in the tropics. It
grows to a height of 30 feet, but when cultivated is kept pruned to from 6 to 10 feet. The
fruit, which resembles a small cherry, with two seeds or coffee grains embedded in the pulp,
is dried and the seeds removed, cleaned, and graded. Coffee has an entirely different composition
from tea; it is characterized by a high per cent of fat and soluble carbohydrates, and also
contains an essential oil and caffein, an alkaloid identical with theine. Tannic acid, not
as free acid, is combined with caffein as a tannate.

  ======================================
              |RAW COFFEE|ROASTED COFFEE
  --------------------------------------
              | Per Cent | Per Cent
  Water       |  11.23   |   1.15
  Ash         |   3.92   |   4.75

  Protein     |  12.07   |  13.98
  Caffein     |   1.21   |   1.24
  ======================================

The high per cent of sugar and other soluble carbohydrates in roasted coffee is caused by the
action of heat upon the non-nitrogenous compounds. Coffee cannot be considered a food, because
only a comparatively small amount of the nutrients are soluble and available. It is a mildly
stimulating beverage. With some individuals it appears to promote the digestive process, while
with others its effect is not beneficial. Coffee is more extensively used in this country than
tea, and is subject to greater adulteration. It is adulterated by facing and glazing; i.e.
coloring the berries to resemble different grades and coating them with caramel and dextrine.
Spent coffee grains and coffee that has been extracted without grinding are also used as adulterants.
Imitation berries made of rye, corn, or wheat paste, molded, colored with caramel, and baked
have been found mixed with genuine coffee berries. Roasted cereals and chicory are used extensively
to adulterate ground coffee. Chicory is prepared from the root of the chicory plant, which
belongs to the same family as the dandelion. It is claimed by some that a small amount of chicory
improves the flavor of coffee. However, when chicory is added to coffee, it should be so stated
on the label and the amount used given. The dextrine and sugar used in glazing are browned
or caramelized during roasting and impart a darker color to the infusion, making it appear
better than it really is. The glazing also makes the coffee retain moisture which would otherwise
be driven off during roasting. Coffee contains such a large per cent of oil that the berries
generally float when thrown on water, while the imitation berries sink. Chicory also sinks
rapidly and colors the water brown, while the coffee remains floating for some time.

There are three kinds of coffee in general use: Java, Mocha, and Rio or Brazil. The Brazil
coffee has the largest berry and is usually styled by dealers as "low" or "low middlings."
The Java coffee berries are smaller and paler in color, the better grades being brown. Mocha
usually commands the highest price in commerce. The seeds are small and dark yellow before
roasting.

219. Cereal Coffee Substitutes.

     "A few of these preparations contain a little true coffee, but for
     the most part they appear to be made of parched grains of barley,
     wheat, etc., or of grain mixed with pea hulls, ground corncobs, or
     wheat middlings. It is said that barley or wheat parched, with a
     little molasses, in an ordinary oven, makes something
     indistinguishable in flavor from some of the cereal coffees on the
     market. If no coffee is used in the cereal preparations, the claim
     that they are not stimulating is probably true. As for the
     nutritive value, parching the cereals undoubtedly renders some of
     the carbohydrates soluble, and a part of this soluble matter passes
     into the decoction, but the nutritive value of the infusion is
     hardly worth considering in the dietary."[56]

220. Cocoa and Chocolate Preparations.--Cocoa and chocolate are manufactured from the "cocoa
bean," the seed of a tree native to tropical America. The beans are inclosed in a lemon-yellow,
fleshy pod. They are removed from the pulp, allowed to undergo fermentation, and dried by exposure
to the air and light, which hardens them and gives them a red color. This method produces what
is known as the "fermented cocoa." For the "unfermented cocoa," the beans are dried without
undergoing fermentation. Fermentation removes much of the acidity and bitterness characteristic
to the unfermented bean, and when properly regulated develops flavor. The original bean contains
about 50 per cent fat, part of which is removed in preparing the cocoa. This fat is sold as
cocoa butter. In the preparation of some brands of cocoa, alkalies, such as soda and potash,
are used to form a combination with the fat to prevent its separating in oily globules. This
treatment improves the appearance of the cocoa, but experiments show the albumin to be somewhat
less digestible and the soap-like product resulting not as valuable a food as the fat. Such
preparations have a high per cent of ash. There is no objection from a nutritive point of view
to a cocoa in which the fat separates in oily globules.

221. Composition of Cocoa.--The cocoa bean, when dried or roasted and freed from its husk and
ground, is sold as cracked cocoa, or cocoa nibs. From cocoa nibs the various cocoa and chocolate
preparations are made. Cocoas vary in composition according to the extent to which the fat
is removed during the process of manufacture and the nature and extent to which other ingredients
are added. An average cocoa contains about 20 per cent of proteids, and 30 per cent fat, also
starch, sugar, gums, fiber, and ash, as well as theobromine, a material very similar to theine
and caffein in tea and coffee, but not such an active stimulant. Cocoa is not easily soluble,
but it may be ground so fine that a long time is required for its sedimentation; or sugar or
other soluble material may be added during the process of manufacture to increase the specific
gravity of the liquid to such an extent that the same object is attained without such fine
grinding. The first method is to be preferred. Cocoa and its preparations are richer in nutritive
substances than tea and coffee and have this added advantage that both the soluble and insoluble
portions become a part of the beverage. Owing to the small amount used for a cup of cocoa,
independent of the milk it does not add much in the way of nutrients to the ration.

222. Chocolate.--Plain chocolate is prepared from cocoa nibs without "removal of the fat or
other constituents except the germ." It differs in chemical composition from cocoa by containing
more fat and less protein; it has nearly the same chemical composition as the cocoa nibs. It
is officially defined as containing "not more than 3 per cent of ash insoluble in water, 3-1/2
per cent of crude fiber and 9 per cent of starch, and less than 45 per cent cocoa fat."[71]

By the addition of sugar, sweet chocolates are made. They vary widely in composition according
to the flavors and amounts of sugar added during their preparation. The average composition
of cocoa nibs, standard cocoa, and plain chocolate is as follows:

  ==============================================================
                  |  COCOA |  COMPOSITION OF  | COMPOSITION OF
                  |   NIBS |  STANDARD COCOA  |  PLAIN CHOCOLATE

  ============================================================

223. Adulteration of Chocolate and Cocoa.--The various chocolate and cocoa preparations offer
an enticing field for sophistication; they are not, however, so extensively adulterated as
before the enforcement of national and state pure food laws. The most common adulterants are
starch, cocoa shells, and occasionally iron dioxid and other pigments to give color, also foreign
fats to replace the fat removed and to give the required plasticity for molding.

224. Comparative Composition of Beverages.--Tea and coffee as beverages contain but little
in the way of nutrients other than the cream and sugar used in them. The solid matter in tea
and coffee infusions amounts to less than 1.2 per cent. When cocoa is made with milk, it is
a beverage of high nutritive value due mainly to the milk.

CHAPTER XV

THE DIGESTIBILITY OF FOODS

225. Digestibility, How Determined.--The term "digestibility," as applied to foods, is used
in two ways: (1) meaning the thoroughness of the process, or the completeness with which the
nutrients of the food are absorbed and used by the body, and (2) meaning the ease or comfort
with which digestion is accomplished. Cheese is popularly termed indigestible, and rice digestible,
when in reality the nutrients of cheese are more completely although more slowly digested than
those of rice. In this work, unless otherwise stated, digestibility is applied to the completeness
of the digestion process.

The digestibility of a food is ascertained by means of digestion experiments, in which all
of the food consumed for a certain period, usually two to four days, is weighed and analyzed,
and from the weight and composition is determined the amount, in pounds or grams, of each nutrient
consumed.[72] In like manner the nutrients in the indigestible portion, or feces, are determined
from the weight and composition of the feces. The indigestible nutrients in the feces are deducted
from the total nutrients of the food, the difference being the amount digested, or oxidized
in the body. When the food is digested, the various nutrients undergo complete or partial oxidation,
with the formation of carbon dioxid gas, water, urea (CH{4}N{2}O), and other compounds. The
feces consist mainly of the compounds which have escaped digestion. The various groups of compounds
of foods do not all have the same digestibility; for example, the starch of potatoes is 92
per cent digestible, while the protein is only 72 per cent. The percentage amount of a nutrient
that is digested is called the digestion coefficient.

In the following way the digestibility of a two-days ration of bread and milk was determined:
773.5 grams of bread and 2000 grams of milk were consumed by the subject. The dried feces weighed
38.2 grams. The foods and feces when analyzed were found to have the following composition:[62]

  =============================================================================

In this experiment 92 per cent of the crude protein, 93 per cent of the ether extract, and
97.5 per cent of the carbohydrates of the bread and milk ration were digested and absorbed
by the body. In calculating the available energy, correction is made for the unoxidized residue,
as urea and allied forms. It is estimated that for each gram of protein in the ration there
was an indigestible residue yielding 1.25 calories.

226. Available Nutrients.--A food may contain a comparatively large amount of a compound, and
yet, on account of its low digestibility, fail to supply much of it to the body in an available
form. Hence it is that the value of a food is dependent not alone on its composition, but also
on its digestibility. The digestible or available nutrients of a food are determined by multiplying
the per cent of each nutrient which the food contains by its digestion coefficient. For example,
a sample of wheat flour contains 12 per cent protein, 88 per cent of which is digestible, making
10.56 per cent of available or digestible protein (12 × 0.88-10.56). Graham flour made from
similar wheat contains 13 per cent total protein, and only 75 per cent of the protein is digestible,
making 9.75 per cent available (13 × 0.75 = 9.75). Thus one food may contain a larger total
but a smaller available amount of a nutrient than another.

227. Available Energy.--The available energy of a food or a ration is expressed in calories.
A ration for a laborer at active out-of-door work should yield about 3200 calories. The calory
is the unit of heat, and represents the heat required to raise the temperature of a kilogram
of water 1° C., or four pounds of water 1° F. The caloric value of foods is determined by the
calorimeter, an apparatus which measures heat with great accuracy. A pound of starch, or allied
carbohydrates, yields 1860 calories, and a pound of fat 4225 (see Section 13). While a gram
of protein completely burned produces 7.8 calories, digested it yields only about 4.2 calories,
because, as explained in the preceding section, not all of the carbon and oxygen are oxidized.[59]
The caloric value or available energy of a ration can be calculated from the digestible nutrients
by multiplying the pounds of digestible protein and carbohydrates by 1860, the digestible fat
by 4225, and adding the results. For determination of the available energy of foods under different
experimental conditions, and where great accuracy is desired, a specially constructed respiration
calorimeter has been devised, which is built upon the same principle as an ordinary calorimeter,
except it is large enough to admit a person, and is provided with appliances for measuring
and analyzing the intake and outlet of air.[74] The heat produced by the combustion of the
food in the body warms the water surrounding the calorimeter chamber, and this increase in
temperature is determined by thermometers reading to 0.005 of a degree or less.

228. Normal Digestion and Health.--While the process of digestion has been extensively studied,
it is not perfectly understood. Between the initial compounds of foods and their final oxidation
products a large number of intermediate substances are formed, and when digestion fails to
take place in a normal way, toxic or poisonous compounds are produced and various diseases
result. It is probable that more diseases are due to imperfect or malnutrition than to any
other cause. There is a very close relationship between health and normal digestion of the food.

The cells in the different parts of the digestive tract secrete fluids containing substances
known as soluble ferments, or enzymes, which act upon the various compounds of foods, changing
them chemically and physically so that they can be absorbed and utilized by the body. (See
Section 31.) Some of the more important ferments are: ptyolin of the saliva, pepsin of the
stomach, and pancreatin and diastase of the intestines. In order that these ferments may carry
on their work in a normal way, the acidity and alkalinity of the different parts of the digestive
tract must be maintained. The gastric juice contains from 0.1 to 0.25 per cent of hydrochloric
acid, imparting mildly antiseptic properties; and while the peptic ferment works in a slightly
acid solution, the tryptic ferment requires an alkaline solution. To secrete the necessary
amount and quality of digestive fluids, the organs must be in a healthy condition. Many erroneous
ideas regarding the digestion of foods are based upon misinterpretation of facts by persons
suffering from impaired digestion, and attempts are frequently made to apply to normal digestion
generalizations applicable only to diseased conditions.

229. Digestibility of Animal Foods.--The proteids and fats in animal foods, as meats, are more
completely digested than the same class of nutrients in vegetables. In general, about 95 per
cent of the proteids of meats is digestible, while those in vegetables are often less than
85 percent digestible. The amount of indigestible residue from animal foods is small; while
from vegetables it is large, for the cellulose prevents complete absorption of the nutrients
and, as a result, there is much indigestible residue. Animal foods are concentrated, in that
they furnish large amounts of nutrients in digestible forms. There is less difference in the
completeness with which various meats are digested than in their ease of digestion; the proteins
all have about the same digestion coefficients, but vary with individuals as to ease of digestion
and time required. It is generally considered that the digestible proteins, whether of animal
or vegetable origin, are equally valuable for food purposes. This is an assumption, however,
that has not been well established by experimental evidence. In a mixed ration, the proteins
from different sources appear to have the same nutritive value, but as each is composed of
different radicals and separated into dissimilar elementary compounds during the process of
digestion, they would not necessarily all have the same food value.

There is but little difference between the fats and proteins of meats as to completeness of
digestion,--the slight difference being in favor of the proteins. Some physiologists claim
that the fat, which in some meats surrounds the bundles of fiber (protein), forming a protecting
coat, prevents the complete solvent action of the digestive fluid. Very fat meats are not as
completely digested as those moderately fat. It is also claimed that the digestibility of the
meat is influenced by the mechanical character, as toughness of the fiber.

230. Digestibility of Vegetable Foods.--Vegetable foods vary in digestibility with their mechanical
condition and the amount of cellulose or fiber. In some the nutrients are so embedded in cellular
tissue as to be protected from the solvent action of the digestive fluids, and in such cases
the digestibility and availability are low. The starches and sugars are more completely digested
than any other of the nutrients of vegetables; in some instances they are from 95 to 98 per
cent digestible. Some cellular tissue, but not an excess, is desirable in a ration, as it exerts
a favorable mechanical action upon the organs of digestion, encourages peristalsis, and is
an absorbent and dilutant of the waste products formed during digestion. For example, in the
feeding of swine, it has been found that corn and cob meal often gives better results than
corn fed alone. The cob contains but little in the way of nutrients, but it exerts a favorable
mechanical action upon digestion. Occasionally too many bulky foods are combined, containing
scant amounts of nutrients, so that the body receives insufficient protein. This is liable
to be the case in the dietary of the strict vegetarian. Many of the vegetables possess special
dietetic value, due to the organic acids and essential oils, as cited in the chapter on fruits
and vegetables. The value of such foods cannot always be determined from their content of digestible
protein, fat, and carbohydrates. This is particularly evident when they are omitted from the
ration, as in the case of a restricted diet consisting mainly of animal foods. Many vegetables
have low nutritive value on account of their bulky nature and the large amount of water and
cellulose which they contain, which tends to decrease digestibility and lower the amount of
available nutrients. Because of their bulk and fermentable nature, resulting in the formation
of gases, a diet of coarse vegetables has a tendency to cause distention and enlargement of
the intestinal organs. The carbohydrates, which are the chief constituents of vegetables, are
digested mainly in the intestines, and require special mechanical preparation in the stomach,
hence the nutrients of vegetables are not, as a rule, as easily digested as those of animal foods.

231. Factors influencing Digestion.--There are a number of factors which influence completeness
as well as ease of digestion, as: (1) combination of foods; (2) amount of food; (3) method
of preparation; (4) mechanical condition of the food; (5) palatability; (6) physiological properties;
(7) individuality of the consumer; and (8) psychological influences.

232. Combination of Foods.--In a mixed ration the nutrients are generally more completely digested
than when only one food is used. For example, milk is practically all digested when it forms
a part of a ration, and it also promotes digestibility of the foods with which it is combined,
but when used alone it is less digestible.[27] Bread alone and milk alone are not as completely
digested as bread and milk combined. The same in a general way has been observed in the feeding
of farm animals,--better results are secured from combining two or more foods than from the
use of one alone. The extent to which one food influences the digestibility of another has
not been extensively studied.

In a mixed ration, consisting of several articles of food of different mechanical structure,
the work of digestion is more evenly distributed among the various organs. A food often requires
special preparation on the part of the stomach before it can be digested in the intestines,
and if this food is consumed in small amounts and combined with others of different structure,
the work of gastric digestion is lessened so that the foods are properly prepared and normal
digestion takes place. The effect which one food exerts upon the digestibility of another is
largely mechanical.

233. Amount of Food.--Completeness as well as ease of digestion is influenced by the amount
of food consumed. In general, excessive amounts are not as completely digested as moderate
amounts. In digestion experiments with oatmeal and milk, it was found that when these foods
were consumed in large quantities the fat and protein were not as completely absorbed by the
body as when less was used, the protein being 7 per cent and the fat 6 per cent more digestible
in the medium ration. Experiments with animals show that economical results are not secured
from an excess of food.[5] Some individuals consume too much food, and with them a restricted
diet would be beneficial, while others err in not consuming enough to meet the requirements
of the body. Quite frequently it is those who need more food who practice dieting. When there
is trouble with digestion, it is not always the amount or kind of food which is at fault, but
other habits may be such as to affect digestion. The active out-of-door laborer can with impunity
consume more food, because there is greater demand for nutrients, and the food is more completely
oxidized in the body and without the formation of poisonous waste products. The amount of food
consumed should be sufficient to meet all the demands of the body and maintain a normal weight.

234. Method of Preparation of Food.--The extent to which methods of cooking and preparation
influence completeness of digestion has not been extensively investigated. As is well known,
they have great influence upon ease and comfort of digestion. During cooking, as discussed
in Chapter II, extensive physical and chemical changes occur, and these in turn affect digestibility.
When the cooking has not been sufficient to mechanically disintegrate vegetable tissue, the
digestive fluids fail to act favorably upon the food. Cooking is also beneficial because it
renders the food sterile and destroys all objectionable microörganisms which, if they remain
in food, readily undergo incubation in the digestive tract, interfering with normal digestion.
Prolonged heat causes some foods to become less digestible, as milk, which digestion experiments
show to be more completely digested when fresh than when sterilized. Pasteurized milk, which
is not subjected to so high a temperature as sterilized milk, is more completely digested.
See Chapter VII for discussion of sterilizing and pasteurizing milk.[38] The benefits derived
from the destruction of the objectionable bacteria in foods are, however, greater than the
losses attendant on lessened digestibility due to the action of heat. The method of preparation
of a food affects its digestibility mainly through change in mechanical structure, and modification
of the forms in which the nutrients are present.[5]

235. Mechanical Condition of Foods.--The mechanical condition of foods as to density and structure
of the particles and the extent to which they are disintegrated in their preparation for the
table influences digestibility to a great extent. The mechanics of digestion is a subject that
has not been extensively investigated, and it is one of great importance, as biological and
chemical changes cannot take place if the food is not in proper mechanical condition. In general,
the finer the food particles, the more completely the nutrients are acted upon by the digestive
fluids and absorbed by the body. Nevertheless, the diet should not consist entirely of finely
granulated foods. Some foods are valuable mainly because of the favorable action they exert
mechanically upon digestion, rather than for the nutrients they contain.[62] Coarsely granulated
breakfast foods, whole wheat flour, and many vegetables contain sufficient cellular tissue
to give special value from a mechanical rather than a chemical point of view. The extent to
which coarsely and finely granulated foods should enter into the ration is a question largely
for the individual to determine. Experiments with pigs show that if large amounts of coarse,
granular foods are consumed, the tendency is for the digestive tract to become inflamed and
less able to exercise its normal functions. Coarsely granulated foods have a tendency to pass
through the digestive tract in less time than those that are finely granulated, due largely
to increased peristaltic action, and the result is the food is not retained a sufficient length
of time to allow normal absorption to take place. In the feeding of farm animals, it has been
found that the mechanical condition of the food has a great influence upon its economic use.
Rations that are either too bulky or too concentrated fail to give the best results. In the
human ration, the mechanical condition of the food is equally as important as its chemical
composition.

236. Mastication is an important part of digestion, and when foods are not thoroughly masticated,
additional work is required of the stomach, which is usually an overworked organ because of
doing the work of the mouth as well. Although much of the mechanical preparation and mixing
of foods is of necessity done in the stomach, some of it may advantageously be done in the
mouth. The stomach should not be required to perform the function of the gizzard of a fowl.

237. Palatability of Foods.--Many foods naturally contain essential oils and other substances
which impart palatability. These have but little in the way of nutritive value, but they assist
in rendering the nutrients with which they are associated more digestible. Palatability of
a food favorably influences the secretion of the gastric and other digestive fluids, and in
this way the natural flavors of well-prepared foods aid in digestion. In the feeding of farm
animals it has been found that when foods are consumed with a relish better returns are secured
than when unpalatable foods are fed. To secure palatability the excessive use of condiments
is unnecessary. It is possible to a great extent during preparation to develop and conserve
the natural flavors. Some foods contain bitter principles which are removed during the cooking,
while in others pleasant flavors are developed. Palatability is an important factor in the
digestibility of foods.

238. Physiological Properties of Food.--Some food materials, particularly fruits and vegetables,
contain compounds which have definite physiological properties, as tannin which is an astringent,
special oils which exert a cathartic action, and the alkaloids which serve as irritants to
nerve centers. Wheat germ oil is laxative, and it is probable that the physiological properties
of graham and whole wheat breads are due in some degree to the oil which they contain.[67]
The use of fruits, herbs, and vegetables for medicinal purposes is based upon the presence
of compounds possessing well-defined medicinal properties. As a rule food plants do not contain
appreciable amounts of such substances, and the use of food for medicinal effect should be
by the advice of a physician. The physiological properties of some foods are due to bacterial
products. See Chapter XX.
