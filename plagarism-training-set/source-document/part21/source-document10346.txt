 1315 Letter Book R, fos. 41-42; Journal 16, fos. 37, 37b. According to
      Holinshed (iii, 1017, 1018), considerable opposition was made by a
      member of the Common Council named George Stadlow to any force at
      all being sent by the city. He reminded the court of the evils that
      had arisen in former times from the city rendering support to the
      barons against Henry III, and how the city lost its liberties in
      consequence. The course he recommended was that the city should join
      the lords in making a humble representation to the king as to the
      Protector’s conduct.

 1322 For more than a week he had been compelled to lie on nothing but
      straw, his bed having been taken away by order of the knight marshal
      for refusing to pay an extortionate fee.—Grey Friars Chron., p. 65.

 1323 Thomas Thurlby, the last abbot of Westminster, became the first and
      only bishop of the see. Upon the union of the see with that of
      London Thurlby became bishop of Norwich. Among the archives of the
      city there is a release by him, in his capacity as bishop of
      Westminster, and the dean and chapter of the same, to the City of
      London of the parish church of St. Nicholas, Shambles. The document
      is dated 14 March, 1549, and has the seals of the bishopric and of
      the dean and chapter, in excellent preservation, appended.

 1324 For objecting to the prescribed vestments, he was committed to the
      Fleet by order of the Privy Council, 27 Jan., 1551, and was not
      consecrated until the following 8th March.—Hooper to Bullinger, 1

 M689 Charter to the City, 23 April, 1550.

 1329 Letter Book R, fo. 58b.

 1330 Dated 23 April, 1550. A fee of £6 "and odde money" was paid for the
      enrolment of this charter in the Exchequer.—Repertory 12, pt. ii,
      fo. 458. This fee appears to have been paid, notwithstanding the
      express terms of the charter that no fee great or small should be
      paid or made or by any means given to the hanaper to the king’s use.
      According to Wriothesley (ii, 36), the "purchase" of Southwark cost
      the city 1,000 marks, "so that nowe they shall have all the whole
      towne of Southwarke by letters patent as free as they have the City
      of London, the Kinges Place [i.e. Southwark Place or Suffolk
      House] and the two prison houses of the Kinges Bench and the
      Marshalsea excepted."

      there were no means of enforcing the above ordinance it was repealed
      by Act of Co. Co., 16 June, 1558.—Letter Book S., fo. 167b.

 1334 Letter Book R, fo. 71b. The following particulars of Aylyff and his
      family are drawn from the city’s archives.  From Bridge Ward Without
      he removed to Dowgate Ward. At the time of his death, in 1556, he
      was keeper of the clothmarket at Blackwell Hall.  His widow was
      allowed to take the issues and profits of her late husband’s place
      for one week, and was forgiven a quarter’s rent.  Aylyff’s son
      Erkenwald succeeded him at Blackwell Hall. The son died in 1561.
      After his decease he was convicted of having forged a deed.  His
      widow, Dorothy, married Henry Butler, "gentleman."—Repertory 13, pt.

      William Chester, 7 Feb., 1557.  His mansion-house was in Lime
      Street, near the Church of St. Andrew Undershaft. Ob. 29 Aug,
      1582.—Machyn, pp. 125, 353; Index to Remembrancia, p. 37, note.
      Fuller, who erroneously places his death in 1580, describes him as
      the "Zaccheus of London" not "on account of his low stature, but his
      great charity in bestowing half of his estate on the poor."—Fuller’s
      "Worthies," p. 191.
