HOMER'S ODYSSEY.

BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION.

The Odyssey starts by organizing itself; it maps out its own structure in what may be called
a General Introduction. Herein lies a significant difference between it and the Iliad, which
has simply an Invocation to the Muse, and then leaps into the thick of the action. The Iliad,
accordingly, does not formulate its own organization, which fact has been one cause of the
frequent assaults upon its unity. Still the architectonic principle is powerful in the Iliad,
though more instinctive, and far less explicit than in the Odyssey. It is reasonable to suppose,
therefore, that the poet has reached a profounder consciousness of his art in his later poem;
he has come to a knowledge of his constructive principle, and he takes the trouble to unfold
the same at the beginning. To be sure, certain critics have assailed just this structural fact
as not Homeric; without good grounds, in our judgment.

The First Book, accordingly, opens with an Introduction which belongs to the entire poem, and
which embraces 95 lines of the original text. This portion we shall look at separately in some
detail, as it throws a number of gleams forward over the whole action, and, as before said,
suggests the poetic organism. It has three divisions, the Invocation, the Statement of the
Obstacles to the return of the Hero, and the Assembly of the Gods, who are represented as organizing
the poem from Olympus. The Divine thus hovers over the poem from the first, starting with one
grand, all-embracing providential act, which, however, is supplemented by many special interventions
of deities, great and small.

The Invocation. The first line speaks of the man, Ulysses, and designates his main attribute
by a word, which may be translated versatile or resourceful, though some grammarians construe
it otherwise. Thus we are told at the start of the chief intellectual trait of the Hero, who
"wandered much," and who, therefore, had many opportunities to exercise his gift. In the second
line our attention is called to the real starting point of the poem, the taking of Troy, which
is the background of the action of the Odyssey, and the great opening event of the Greek world,
as here revealed. For this event was the mighty shake which roused the Hellenic people to a
consciousness of their destiny; they show in it all the germs of their coming greatness. Often
such a concussion is required to waken a nation to its full energy and send it on its future
career.

Note that Ulysses is here stated to be the taker of Troy, and this view is implied throughout
the Odyssey. Note Achilles is the final Greek hero; he perished without capturing the city,
and in his hands alone the Greek cause would have been lost. The intellectual hero had to come
forward ere the hostile town could be taken and Helen restored. Herein the Odyssey does not
contradict the Iliad, but is clearly an advance beyond it.

But Troy is destroyed and now the second grand question of the Greeks arises: How shall we
get back! Only one half of the cycle is completed by the conquest of the hostile city; the
second half is the restoration. For this disjunction from Hellenic life, brought about by war,
is not only physical but has become spiritual. The theme, therefore, deals with the wise man,
who, through his intelligence, was able to take Troy, but who has now another and greater problem--the
return out of the grand estrangement caused by the Trojan expedition. Spiritual restoration
is the key-note of this Odyssey, as it is that of all the great Books of Literature.

Here at the start we note two things coupled together which hint the nature of the whole poem:
"He saw the cities of many men and knew their mind." Not alone the outer habitations of people
Ulysses beheld, but also their inner essence, their consciousness. This last faculty indeed
is the very vision of the sage; he looks through the external sensuous appearances of men into
their character, into their very soul. The poem will describe many incidents, wanderings, tempests,
calamities; but in them the poetic glance is to behold a great spiritual experience. The reader
of the Odyssey must himself be a Ulysses, to a degree, and not only "see the cities of many
men," but also he must "know their mind." Then he, too, is heroic in his reading of this book.

But not merely knowledge the Hero is to acquire, though this be much; the counterpart to knowledge
must also be his, namely, suffering. "Many things he suffered on the sea in his heart;" alas!
that too belongs to the great experience. In addition to his title of wise man, he will also
be called the much-enduring man. Sorrow is his lot and great tribulation; the mighty sea will
rise up in wrath and swallow all, except that which is mightier, namely his heroic heart. Knowledge
and suffering--are they not the two poles of the universal character? At any rate the old poet
has mated them as counterparts in his hero; the thirst to know drives the latter to reach beyond,
and then falls the avenging blow of powers unseen.

Furthermore, there is a third trait which is still higher, also mentioned here: he sought to
save not only himself but also his companions. That wisdom of his was employed, and that suffering
of his was endured, not for his own good merely, but for the good of others. He must think
and suffer for his companions; a suggestion of vicariousness lies therein, a hint of self-offering,
which has not yet flowered but is certainly budding far back in old Hellas. He must do for
others what he does for himself, if he be truly the universal man, that is, if he be Hero.
For is not the universal man all men--both himself and others in essence? So Ulysses tries
to save his companions, quite as much he tries to save himself.

But he did not do it, he could not do it; herein lies his limitation and theirs also, in fact,
the limitation of the entire Greek world. What did these companions do? "They perished by their
own folly;" they would not obey the counsel of their wise man; they rejected their Hero, who
could not, therefore, rescue them. A greater wisdom and a deeper suffering than that of Ulysses
will be required for their salvation, whereof the time has not yet come. He would bring them
home, but "they ate of the oxen of the sun;" they destroyed the attribute of light in some
way and perished. The fact is certainly far-reaching in its suggestion; a deep glance it throws
into that old heathen world, whose greatest poet in the most unconscious manner hints here
the tragic limitation of his people and his epoch. It is a hint of which we, looking back through
more than twenty-five centuries can see the full meaning, as that meaning has unfolded itself
in the ages. Time is also a commentator on Homer and has written down, in that alphabet of
his, called events, the true interpretation of the old poet. Still the letters of Time's alphabet
have also to be learned and require not only eyesight but also insight.

The Invocation puts all its stress upon Ulysses and his attempt to save his companions. It
says nothing of Telemachus and his youthful experience, nothing of the grand conflict with
the suitors. Hence fault has been found with it in various ways. But it singles out the Hero
and designates three most important matters concerning him: his knowledge, his suffering, his
devotion to his companions. Enough; it has given a start, a light has been put into our hand
which beams forward significantly upon the poem, and illumines the mazes of the Hero's character.

Mark again the emphatic word in this Invocation; it is the Return (nostos), the whole Odyssey
is the Return, set forth in many gradations, from the shortest and simplest to the longest
and profoundest. The idea of the Return dominates the poem from the start; into this idea is
poured the total experience of Ulysses and his companions. The two points between which the
Return hovers are also given: the capture of Troy and the Greek world. Not a mere book of travels
or adventure is this; it contains an inner restoration corresponding to the outer Return, and
the interpreter of the work, if he be true to his function, will trace the interior line of
its movement, not neglecting the external side which has also a right to be.

The Obstacles. Two of these are mentioned and carried back to their mythical sources. All the
returning heroes are home from Troy except the chief one, Ulysses, whom Calypso detains in
her grot, "wishing him to be her husband;" she, the unmarried, keeps him, the married, from
family and country, though he longs to go back to both. She is the daughter of "the evil-minded
Atlas," a hoary gigantesque shape of primitive legend, "who knows the depths of all the sea,"--a
dark knowledge of an unseen region, from which come many fatalities, as shipwreck for the Greek
sailor or earthquake for the volcanic Greek islands; hence he is imagined as "evil-minded"
by the Greek mythical fancy, which also makes him the supporter of "the long columns which
hold Heaven and Earth apart"--surely a hard task, enough to cause anybody to be in a state
of protest and opposition against the happy Gods who have nothing to do but enjoy themselves
on Olympus. Sometimes he refuses to hold the long columns for awhile, then comes the earthquake,
in which what is below starts heavenward. Of this Atlas, Calypso is the offspring, and possibly
her island, "the navel of the sea," is a product of one of his movements underneath the waters.

Here we touch a peculiar vein in the mythical treatment of the Odyssey. The fairy-tale, with
its comprehensive but dark suggestiveness, is interwoven into the very fibre of the poem. This
remote Atlas is the father of Calypso, "the hider," who has indeed hidden Ulysses in her island
of pleasure which will hereafter be described. But in spite of his "concealment," Ulysses has
aspiration, which calls down the help of the Gods for fulfillment. Such is the first obstacle,
which, we can see, lies somewhere in the sensuous part of human nature.

The second obstacle is Neptune, whom we at once think of as the physical sea--certainly a great
barrier. The wrath of Neptune is also set off with a tale of wonder, which gives the origin
of Polyphemus, the Cyclops--a gigantic, monstrous birth of the sea, which produces so many
strange and huge shapes of living things. But Neptune is now far away, outside of the Greek
world, so to speak, among the Ethiopians. This implies a finite element in the Gods; they are
here, there, and elsewhere; still they have the infinite characteristic also; they easily pass
from somewhere into everywhere, and Ulysses will not escape Neptune.

Such, then, are the two obstacles, both connected far back with mythical beings of the sea,
wherein we may note the marine character of the Odyssey, which is a sea-poem, in contrast with
the Iliad, which is a land-poem. The physical environment, in which each of these songs has
its primary setting, is in deep accord with their respective themes--the one being more objective,
singing of the deed, the other being more subjective, singing of the soul.

And even in the two present obstacles we may note that the one, Neptune, seems more external--that
of the physical sea; while the other, Calypso, seems more internal--that of the soul held in
the charms of the senses.

The Assembly of the Gods. The two obstacles to the return of Ulysses are now to be considered
by the Gods in council assembled. This is, indeed, the matter of first import; no great action,
no great poem is possible outside of the divine order. This order now appears, having a voice;
the supreme authority of the world is to utter its decree concerning the work. The poet at
the start summons before us the governing principle of the universe in the persons of the Olympian
deities. On the other hand, note the solitary individual Ulysses, in a lonely island, with
his aspiration for home and country, with his plan--will it be realized? The two sides must
come together somehow; the plan of the individual must fit into the plan of the Gods; only
in the cooperation of the human and divine is the deed, especially the great deed, possible.
Accordingly we are now to behold far in advance the sweep of the poem, showing whether the
man's purpose and hope be in harmony with the government of the Gods.

Zeus is the supreme divinity, and he first speaks: "How sorely mortals blame the Gods!" It
is indeed an alienated discordant time like the primal fall in Eden. But why this blame? "For
they say that evils come from us, the Gods; whereas they, through their own follies, have sorrows
beyond what is ordained." The first words of the highest God concern the highest problem of
the poem and of human life. It is a wrong theology, at least a wrong Homeric theology, to hold
that the Gods are the cause of human ills; these are the consequences of man's own actions.
Furthermore, the cause is not a blind impersonal power outside of the individual, it is not
Fate but man himself. What a lofty utterance! We hear from the supreme tribunal the final decision
in regard to individual free-will and divine government.

Not without significance is this statement put into the mouth of Zeus and made his first emphatic
declaration. We may read therein how the poet would have us look at his poem and the intervention
of the Gods. We may also infer what is the Homeric view concerning the place of divinity in
the workings of the world.

Such being the command of Zeus, the interpreter has nothing to do but to obey. No longer shall
we say that the Gods in this Odyssey destroy human freedom, but that they are deeply consistent
with it; the divine interference when it takes place is not some external agency beyond the
man altogether, but is in some way his own nature, veritably the essence of his own will. Such
is truly the thing to be seen; the poem is a poem of freedom, and yet a poem of providence;
for do we not hear providence at the very start declaring man's free-will, and hence his responsibility?
The God, then, is not to destroy but to secure human liberty in action, and to assert it on
proper occasions. Thus Zeus himself has laid down the law, the fundamental principle of Homer's
religion as well as of his poem.

Have the Gods, then, nothing to do in this world? Certainly they have, and this is the next
point upon which we shall hear our supreme authority, Zeus. He has in mind the case of Ægisthus
whom the Gods warned not to do the wicked deed; still he did it in spite of the warning, and
there followed the penalty. So the Gods admonish the wrong-doer, sending down their bright-flashing
messenger Hermes, and declaring through him the great law of justice: the deed will return
unto the doer. Zeus has now given expression to the law which governs the world; it is truly
his law, above all caprice. Moreover, the God gives a warning to the sinner; a divine mercy
he shows even in the heathen world.

The case of Ægisthus, which Zeus has in mind, is indeed a striking example of a supreme justice
which smites the most exalted and successful criminal. It made a profound impression upon the
Greek world, and took final shape in the sublime tragedy of Æschylus. Throughout the Odyssey
the fateful story peeps from the background, and strongly hints what is to become of the suitors
of Penelope, who are seeking to do to Ulysses what Ægisthus did to Agamemnon. They will perish,
is the decree; thus we behold at the beginning of the poem an image which foreshadows the end.
That is the image of Ægisthus, upon whom vengeance came for the wrongful deed.

The Gods, then, do really exist; they are the law and the voice of the law also, to which man
may hearken if he will; but he can disobey, if he choose, and bring upon himself the consequences.
The law exists as the first fact in the world, and will work itself out with the Gods as executors.
Is not this a glorious starting-point for a poem which proposes to reveal the ways of providence
unto men? The idea of the Homeric world-order is now before us, which we may sum up as follows:
the Gods are in the man, in his reason and conscience, as we moderns say; but they are also
outside of man, in the world, of which they are rulers. The two sides, divine and human, must
be made one; the grand dualism between heaven and earth must be overcome in the deed of the
hero, as well as in the thought of the reader. When the God appears, it is to raise man out
of himself into the universal realm where lies his true being. Again, let it be affirmed that
the deities are not an external fate, not freedom-destroying power, but freedom-fulfilling,
since they burst the narrow limits of the mere individual and elevate him into unity and harmony
with the divine order. There he is truly free.

Thus we hear Zeus in his first speech announcing from Olympus the two great laws which govern
the world, as well as this poem--that of freedom and that of justice. The latter, indeed, springs
from the former; if man be free, he must be held responsible and receive the penalty of the
wicked deed. Moreover, it is the fundamental law of criticism for the Odyssey; freedom and
justice we are to see in it and unfold them in accord with the divine order; woe be to the
critic who disobeys the decree of Zeus, and sees in his poem only an amusing tale, or a sun-myth
perchance.

But here is Pallas Athena speaking to the supreme deity, and noting what seems to be an exception.
It is the case of Ulysses, who always "gave sacrifices to the immortal Gods," who has done
his duty, and wishes to return to family and country. Pallas hints the difficulty; Calypso
the charmer, seeks to detain him in her isle from his wedded wife and to make him forget Ithaca;
but she cannot. Strong is his aspiration, he is eager to break the trance of the fair nymph,
and the Gods must help him, when he is ready to help himself. Else, indeed, they were not Gods.
Then there is the second obstacle, Neptune; he, "only one," cannot hold out "against all,"
for the All now decrees the restoration of the wanderer. Verily it is the voice of the totality,
which is here uttered by Zeus, ordering the return of Ulysses; the reason of the world we may
also call it, if that will help the little brain take in the great thought.

But we must not forget the other side. This divine power is not simply external; the mighty
hand of Zeus is not going to pick up Ulysses from Calypso's island, and set him down in Ithaca.
He must return through himself, yet must fit into the providential order. Both sides are touched
upon by Zeus; Ulysses "excels mortals in intelligence," and he will now require it all; but
he also "gives sacrifices to the Gods exceedingly," that is, he seeks to find out the will
of the Gods and adjust himself thereto. Intellect and piety both he has, often in conflict,
but in concord at last. With that keen understanding of his he will repeatedly fall into doubt
concerning the divine purpose; but out of doubt he rises into a new harmony.

When the decree of the Highest has been given, Pallas at once organizes the return of Ulysses,
and therewith the poem. This falls into three large divisions:--

I. Pallas goes to Ithaca to rouse Telemachus, who is just entering manhood, to be a second
Ulysses. He is to give the divine warning to the guilty suitors; then he is to go to Pylos
and Sparta in order to inquire about his father, who is the great pattern for the son. Thus
we have a book of education for the Homeric youth whose learning came through example and through
the living word of wisdom from the lips of the old and experienced man. This part embraces
the first four Books, which may be called the Telemachiad.

II. Mercury is sent to Calypso to bid the nymph release Ulysses, who at once makes his raft
and starts on his voyage homeward. In this second part we shall have the entire story of the
Hero from the time he leaves Troy, till he reaches Ithaca in the 13th Book. As Telemachus the
youth is to have his period of education (Lehrjahre), so Ulysses the man is to have his experience
of the journey of life (Wanderjahre). Both parts belong together, making a complete work on
the education of man, as it could be had in that old Greek world. This part is the Odyssey
proper, or the Ulyssiad.

III. The third part brings together father and son in Ithaca; then it portrays them uniting
to perform the great deed of justice, the punishment of the suitors. This part embraces the
last twelve Books, but is not distinctly set forth in the plan of Pallas as here given.

Such is the structure of the poem, which is organized in its main outlines from Olympus. It
is Pallas, the deity of wisdom, who has ordered it in this way; her we shall follow, in preference
to the critics, and unfold the interpretation on the same organic lines. Every reader will
feel that the three great joints of the poetical body are truly foreshadowed by the Goddess,
who indeed is the constructive principle of the poem. One likes to see this belief of the old
singer that his work was of divine origin, was actually planned upon Olympus by Pallas in accordance
with the decree of Zeus. So at least the Muses have told him, and they were present. But the
grandest utterance here is that of Zeus, the Greek Providence, proclaiming man's free will.

Very old and still very new is the problem of the Odyssey; with a little care we can see that
the Homeric Greek had to solve in his way what every one of us still has to solve, namely,
the problem of life. Only yesterday one might have heard the popular preacher of a great city,
a kind of successor to Homer, blazoning the following text as his theme: God is not to blame.
Thus the great poem has an eternal subject, though its outer garb be much changed by time.
The soul of Homer is ethical, and that is what makes him immortal. Not till we realize this
fact, can we be said in any true sense, to understand him.

TELEMACHIAD.

The Introduction being concluded, the story of Telemachus begins, and continues till the Fifth
Book. Two main points stand forth in the narrative. The first is the grand conflict with the
suitors, the men of guilt, the disturbers of the divine order; this conflict runs through to
the end of the poem, where they are swept out of the world which they have thrown into discord.
The second point of the Telemachiad is the education of Telemachus, which is indeed the chief
fact of these Books; the youth is to be trained to meet the conflict which is looming up before
him in the distance. Thus we have one of the first educational books of the race, the very
first possibly; it still has many valuable hints for the educator of the present age. Its method
is that of oral tradition, which has by no means lost its place in a true discipline of the
human spirit. Living wisdom has its advantage to-day over the dead lore of the text-books.

Very delightful is the school to which we see Telemachus going in these four Books. Heroes
are his instructors, men of the deed as well as of the word, and the source from which all
instruction is derived is the greatest event of the age, the Trojan War. The young man is to
learn what that event was, what sacrifices it required, what characters it developed among
his people. He is to see and converse with Nestor, famous at Troy for eloquence and wisdom.
Then he will go to Menelaus, who has had an experience wider than the Trojan experience, for
the latter has been in Egypt. Young Telemachus is also to behold Helen, beautiful Helen, the
central figure of the great struggle. Finally, he is to learn much about his father, and thus
be prepared for the approaching conflict with the suitors in Ithaca.

Book First specially. After the total Odyssey has been organized on Olympus, it begins at once
to descend to earth and to realize itself there. For the great poem springs from the Divine
Idea, and must show its origin in the course of its own unfolding. Hence the Gods are the starting-point
of the Odyssey, and their will goes before the terrestrial deed; moreover, the one decree of
theirs overarches the poem from beginning to end, as the heavens bend over man wherever he
may take his stand. Still there will be many special interventions and reminders from the Gods
during this poetical journey.

In accordance with the Olympian plan, Pallas takes her flight down to Ithaca, after binding
on her winged sandals and seizing her mighty spear; thus she humanizes herself to the Greek
plastic sense, and assumes finite form, adopting the shape of a stranger, Mentes, King of the
Taphians. She finds a world full of wrong; violence and disorder rule in the house of the absent
Ulysses; it is indeed high time for the Gods to come down from lofty Olympus and bring peace
and right into the course of things. Let the divine image now be stamped upon terrestrial affairs,
and bring harmony out of strife. Still, it must not be forgotten that the work has to be done
through man's own activity.

The conflict which unfolds before our eyes in a series of clear-drawn classic pictures, lies
between the House of Ulysses on the one hand and the Suitors of Penelope on the other. He who
is the head of the Family and the ruler of State, Ulysses, has been absent for twenty years;
godless men have taken advantage of the youth of his son, and are consuming his substance wantonly;
they also are wooing his wife who has only her cunning wherewith to help herself. The son and
wife are now to be brought before us in their struggle with their bitter lot. Thus we note
the two main divisions in the structure of the present Book: The House of Ulysses and the Suitors.

I.

The Goddess Pallas has already come down to Ithaca and stands among the suitors. She has taken
the form of Mentes, the King of a neighboring tribe; she is in disguise as she usually is when
she appears on earth. Who will recognize her? Not the suitors; they can see no God in their
condition, least of all, the Goddess of Wisdom. "Telemachus was much the first to observe her;"
why just he? The fact is he was ready to see her, and not only to see her, but to hear what
she had to say. "For he sat among the suitors grieved in heart, seeing his father in his mind's
eye," like Hamlet just before the latter saw the ghost. So careful is the poet to prepare both
sides--the divine epiphany, and the mortal who is to behold it.

Furthermore, the young man saw his father "scattering the suitors and himself obtaining honor
and ruling his own house." This is just what the Goddess is going to tell with a new sanction,
and it is just what is going to happen in the course of the poem. Truly Telemachus is prepared
internally; he has already everything within him which is to come out of him. Throughout the
whole interview the two main facts are the example of the parent and the final revenge, both
of which are urged by the Goddess without and by the man within.

Still there is a difference. Telemachus is despondent; we might almost say, he is getting to
disbelieve in any divine order of the world. "The Gods plot evil things" against the House
of Ulysses, whose fate "they make unknown above that of all men." Then they have sent upon
me these suitors who consume my heritage. The poor boy has had a hard time; he has come to
question providence in his misery, and discredits the goodness of the Gods.

Here, now, is the special function of Pallas. She instills courage into his heart. She gives
strong hope of the return of his father, who "will not long be absent from Ithaca;" she also
hints the purpose of the Gods, which is on the point of fulfillment. Be no longer a child;
follow the example of thy father; go and learn about him and emulate his deeds. Therewith the
Goddess furnishes to the doubting youth a plan of immediate action--altogether the best thing
for throwing off his mental paralysis. He is to proceed at once to Pylos and to Sparta "to
learn of his father" with the final outlook toward the destruction of the suitors. She is a
veritable Goddess to the young striver, speaking the word of hope and wisdom, and then turning
him back upon himself.

Here again we must say that the Goddess was in the heart of Telemachus uttering her spirit,
yet she was external to him also. Her voice is the voice of the time, of the reality; all things
are fluid to the hand of Telemachus, and ready to be moulded to his scheme. Still the Goddess
is in him just as well, is his thought, his wisdom, which has now become one with the reason
of the world. Both sides are brought together by the Poet in the most emphatic manner; this
is the supreme fact in his procedure. The subjective and objective elements are one; the divine
order puts its seal on the thought of the man, unites with him, makes his plan its plan. Thus
the God and the Individual are in harmony, and the great fulfillment becomes possible. But
if the thought of Telemachus were a mere scheme of his own, if it had not received the stamp
of divinity, then it could never become the deed, the heroic deed, which stands forth in the
world existent in its own right and eternal.

The Goddess flits away, "like a bird," in speed and silence. Telemachus now recognizes that
the stranger was a divinity. For has he not the proof in his own heart? He is indeed a new
person or the beginning thereof. But hark to this song! It is the bard singing "the sad return
of the Greeks"--the very song which the poet himself is now singing in this Odyssey. For it
is also a sad return, indeed many sad returns, as we shall see hereafter. Homer has thus put
himself into his poem singing his poem. Who cannot feel that this touch is taken from life,
is an echo of his own experience in some princely hall?
