PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

FEBRUARY 5, 1919.

CHARIVARIA.

The Germans refer to the Armistice negotiations as Waffenstillstandeverhandlungen. We hope
it will be worse even than they think.

       ***

There is no truth in the rumour that among the many new performances of Hamlet which are promised
there will be one in aid of the fund for brightening the lives of the clergy, with the Gloomy
Dean as the Gloomy Dane.

       ***

"We Americans do not consider ourselves the salt of the earth," says Senator HENRY. No, but
their bacon certainly is.

       ***

In view of the fact that there is a large quantity of marmalade in the country, it has been
decided to release it. This is such a satisfactory solution of the problem that people are
wondering whether the Food Ministry thought of that one themselves.

       ***

Our heart goes out to the soldier who, when offered, on demobilisation, the option of fifty-two
shillings and sixpence or a standard suit, replied that he would rather pay the fine.

       ***

The only surprising thing about Mr. C.B. COCHRAN'S proposal for a Peace Fair in Hyde Park,
to be arranged largely by himself, is that there is no mention of a Serpentine dance for DELYSIA.

       ***

The Australian Government proposes to send returned Australian soldiers to prospect for minerals
in the Northern Territories. Whether they will be interested in them after their experience
in England in failing to locate quarts is another matter.

       ***

Sir EDWARD ELGAR has dedicated his new orchestral work, "Polonia," to M. PADEREWSKI. The report
that the distinguished pianist-politician is thinking of retorting with a fugue, "Stiltonia,"
is not confirmed.

       ***

The Aircraft Salvage branch announces that not less than one thousand five hundred yards of
the aeroplane linen which is being disposed of to the public will be sold to one purchaser.
In the event of the purchaser deciding to use it as a pocket-handkerchief he can have it hemstitched
for a trifling sum.

       ***

Improvement is reported in the condition of the taxi-cab driver who had a seizure in Piccadilly
Circus while attempting to say "Thank you" to a fare.

       ***

We are pleased to be able to announce that the Kensington man who last week managed to board
a tube train has consented to write a book about it.

       ***

Writing to a contemporary a Leeds correspondent says that he does not think much of an inactive
corporation. As a matter of fact, since the introduction of rationing we didn't think active
ones were being worn.

       ***

As a result of munition work, says a health journal, quite a number of men have given up smoking
tobacco. We suppose the theory is that they have now taken to smoking threepenny cigars.

       ***

Mrs. MAGGIE HATHWAY of Montana is to be congratulated upon running a six-hundred-acre farm
without the help of men's labour. After all we men must admit that her sporting effort is a
distinct score for the second oldest sex in the world.

       ***

Anglesea Police Commission are offering one shilling and sixpence a dozen for rats' tails to
residents of the county. Some difficulty is expected in distinguishing local from imported
tails once they are separated from the rat.

       ***

In connection with the offers for Drury Lane Theatre it appears that one of the would-be purchasers
declares that he was more syndicate than sinning.

       ***

In connection with the epidemic of burglaries in London, The Daily Express has now published
a leader note saying there have been too many of late. It is hoped that this will have the
desired effect.

       ***

We are glad to report that the gentleman who, at the BURNS festival, upon being asked if he
would take a little haggis replied that he wouldn't mind trying a wing, managed to escape with
his life.

       ***

A West Hampstead architect has designed a cottage in which there will be no bricks in the walls,
no timber in the roof, no slates or tiles and no register grates. Too late. Jerry-builders
accomplished that trick years ago.

       ***

While walking in Highams Park, Chingford, says a contemporary, a postman picked up a package
containing one ounce of butter. To his eternal credit let it be said that he at once took it
to the nearest police station.

       ***

The best brains of the country are still exercised by the alleged need of brightening cricket.
One of our own suggestions is that the bowler should be compelled to do three Jazz-steps and
two Fox-trots before delivering the ball.

       ***

A typist recently fell from a moving train on the Isle of Wight railway, but was able to get
up and walk towards her destination. We hear she had a good deal to say to the guard when she
overtook the train.

From a feuilleton:--

    attractive."--Evening News.

There is no accounting for tastes. We should have thought it suggested the Missing Link.

EVICTED.

(A COMMON SCANDAL, INVITING THE ATTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.)

I was amazed the other day to hear that my landlord had called to see me. Hitherto our intercourse
had been by letter and we had had heated differences on the subject of repairs. His standpoint
seemed to be that landlords were responsible for repairs only to lightning conductors and weathercocks.
My house possesses neither of these desirable adjuncts.

I moved an armchair so that no one sitting in it could fail to see the dampest wall and ordered
him to be shown in.

He was a most benevolent-looking old gentleman, and I felt I had done him an injustice in regarding
him as a property shark.

"Glad to see you," he said, shaking me warmly by the hand.

"Do sit down," I said. "That chair is the most comfortable. Don't be afraid. At that distance
from the wall the damp won't affect you."

"So glad to see how comfortable you are here," said the benevolent one.

"If we could occasionally have a hot bath we should be more comfortable, but the kitchen range
is impossible."

"What you need, my friend, is a house of your own so that you can adapt it to your own ideas.
How would you like this house?"

My breath was taken away. Had the kindly one come to present me with a house? Was I to be the
object of an amiable plutocrat's benevolence?

"I should like it very much," I said.

"You shall have it," he said, slapping me amiably on the knee.

I gasped for breath. In my time I had had boxes of cigars given me, but never houses.

"For fifteen hundred pounds, as you are the tenant," continued the benevolent one.

I gasped for breath again.

"But you bought it for five hundred and fifty pounds just before the War," I said when I had
recovered.

"Ah, before the War," chuckled the philanthropist.

"I don't think I can afford fifteen hundred pounds."

The benevolent one looked disappointed in me. "Dear me," he said, "and I wanted so much to
sell it to you. Well, I shall have to give you notice to quit in June. This house must be sold."

"But I can't get another house."

"You can have this house. But surely you have some friend who will advance you fifteen hundred
pounds?"

"You don't know my friends. It would be very awkward to be turned into the street."

"You should have a house of your own and be independent. Every man should own his home. Now
can't you think of some friend who could assist you?"

"Could you lend me fifteen hundred pounds for a rather speculative investment?" I inquired.
