The only similar specimen know in the archaeology of the peninsula is a fragment of a tump
band from the upper or historic level of Metate Cave near Comondú.[6] This fragment is identical
with the tump band from Bahía de Los Angeles in weave, selvage, and cordage. Even the count
is similar: 9 warps and 15 wefts per inch for the Bahía de Los Angeles example, and 10 by 22
for the Metate Cave specimen. Either of these is much coarser than Basketmaker bands, like
those from Segi Canyon with their 24 warps and wefts per inch (Guernsey, 1931, p. 9).

 [6] University of California. Robert H. Lowie Museum of Anthropology,
 specimen 3-13586.

The tump band was used for portage with carrying nets among the historic Indians of central
Baja California (see "Carrying Nets"). The modern Kiliwa of the north supported nets on the
back by a band which passed across the forehead. At the forehead this band consisted of 20
"parallel cords" (Meigs, 1939, p. 38; twined or simple cords are not stipulated). Woven packstraps
were used by all southern California Indians (Drucker, 1937, p. 21). Babies and general burdens
were carried in nets supported by the forehead tumpline in the central and northern areas of
the peninsula (Clavigero, 1937, p. 106).

Cotton Cloth

Since woven cotton (Gossypium sp.) was unknown in aboriginal Baja California at the time of
European contact, its provenience must be beyond the peninsula. Presumably this specimen is
a piece of pre-Columbian trade goods from the mainland of Mexico, and so belongs in the cultural
inventory of the cotton-weaving cultures of the Oasis Area.

The weave of this fragment (139537) is Plain (over-one-under-one) (pl. 17, c). The piece, which
measures 25.5 cm. long (warp) by 30 cm. (weft), consists of one loomstring end and neither
selvage. The warp is white cotton cord, 1 mm. in diameter, in a loosely twisted 2-ply Z-twist.
The weft of the same material has a diameter of 2 mm. of single ply, very loosely Z-twist cord.
This weft is about the equivalent of commercial slub with no tensile strength. The thread count
of the cloth is virtually square (6 x 5 per cm.), although the greater diameter of the tightly
beaten weft makes it the predominant feature of the textile.

The warp ends carry a decorative strengthening feature known to Southwestern textiles, both
ancient and modern. Two whipping cords that are like the weft secure the end warp loops. They
were structural and were probably inserted while the warp was being set up.

One side of the cloth has a whipped edge holding irregularly broken weft ends. This rough mending
was accomplished with the usual native 2-ply cordage. Depth of the stitch into the material
varies considerably--an indication of expedience rather than ornamentation.

Since cotton cloth and cotton are absent from the pre-Columbian archaeology and the historic
ethnography of the peninsula, this specimen must have been obtained through trans-Gulf trade
with mainland Mexico. The Seri of Tiburon Island and Sonora were probably the intermediary
traders. These Indians are well aware of the peninsula opposite them to the west (Griffen, 1959).

Although the weave of this specimen is the simplest of all weaving techniques, it is lacking
among other textile materials of Baja California, such as basketry and matting. The precise
mainland derivation of this specimen must remain in doubt; all the tribes of Sonora--except
the Seri--wove cotton (Driver and Massey, 1957, p. 216). Plain cotton cloth was extremely widely
distributed in the prehistoric Oasis area, and dates at least from Pueblo I times in the American
Southwest (Kent, 1957, p. 491).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This small collection of archaeological materials has a marked diversity of types, with little
duplication. Compared to similar artifacts from habitation caves, the specimens of the Palmer
Collection are complete with the exception of the fragile garments and the netting.

There are few household goods of any variety. Most of the specimens are ornamental or have
a ceremonial significance. A number of artifacts, specifically the tubular stone pipes, human
hair cape, cane whistles, and the probable bull-roarer, were associated with shamans among
the historic peoples of the peninsula. It is most likely that one of the burials was a shaman,
who had been interred with his paraphernalia in this burial cave.

Most of the material from Bahía de Los Angeles can be duplicated from various sites in the
Desert Area; however, a few have been recorded only in the archaeology or ethnography of Baja
California. These include the human hair cape and the exclusive square-knot netting.

The majority of the artifacts and traits occur in the archaeological collections from Baja
California and are mentioned in the ethnographic accounts for that region and for the north
of the peninsula. Only the feathered cape and the specific type of bone awl, or "dagger," are
not recorded. This material bears little resemblance to the collections or ethnographic descriptions
from the extreme south of the peninsula.

There is absolutely nothing in this collection and in the affiliation of its artifacts with
cultural materials from central Baja California to support the contentions of Malcolm Rogers
(1945, p. 191 passim). Without a doubt the Yumans of the peninsula entered long before the
advent of pottery-making in the Colorado Desert region. Neither the Palmer Collection nor identical
materials from historic levels in the central part of the peninsula can be explained as being
due to a post-1450 invasion of Baja California by peoples representing the last phase of the
Yuman sequence in southern California.
