NOTICES

OF THE

LIFE OF LORD BYRON.

"JOURNAL, 1814.

"February 18.

"Better than a month since I last journalised:--most of it out of London and at Notts., but
a busy one and a pleasant, at least three weeks of it. On my return, I find all the newspapers
in hysterics[1], and town in an uproar, on the avowal and republication of two stanzas on Princess
Charlotte's weeping at Regency's speech to Lauderdale in 1812. They are daily at it still;--some
of the abuse good, all of it hearty. They talk of a motion in our House upon it--be it so.

"Got up--redde the Morning Post, containing the battle of Buonaparte, the destruction of the
Custom-house, and a paragraph on me as long as my pedigree, and vituperative, as usual.

"Hobhouse is returned to England. He is my best friend, the most lively, and a man of the most
sterling talents extant.

"'The Corsair' has been conceived, written, published, &c. since I last took up this journal.
They tell me it has great success;--it was written con amore, and much from existence. Murray
is satisfied with its progress; and if the public are equally so with the perusal, there's
an end of the matter.

[Footnote 1: Immediately on the appearance of The Corsair, (with those obnoxious verses, "Weep,
daughter of a royal line," appended to it,) a series of attacks, not confined to Lord Byron
himself, but aimed also at all those who had lately become his friends, was commenced in the
Courier and Morning Post, and carried on through the greater part of the months of February
and March. The point selected by these writers, as a ground of censure on the poet, was one
which now, perhaps, even themselves would agree to class among his claims to praise,--namely,
the atonement which he had endeavoured to make for the youthful violence of his Satire by a
measure of justice, amiable even in its overflowings, to every one whom he conceived he had
wronged.

Notwithstanding the careless tone in which, here and elsewhere, he speaks of these assaults,
it is evident that they annoyed him;--an effect which, in reading them over now, we should
be apt to wonder they could produce, did we not recollect the property which Dryden attributes
to "small wits," in common with certain other small animals:--

    "We scarce could know they live, but that they bite."

The following is a specimen of the terms in which these party scribes could then speak of one
of the masters of English song:--"They might have slept in oblivion with Lord Carlisle's Dramas
and Lord Byron's Poems."--"Some certainly extol Lord Byron's Poem much, but most of the best
judges place his Lordship rather low in the list of our minor poets."]

"Nine o'clock.

"Been to Hanson's on business. Saw Rogers, and had a note from Lady Melbourne, who says, it
is said I am 'much out of spirits.' I wonder if I really am or not? I have certainly enough
of 'that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart,' and it is better they should believe
it to be the result of these attacks than of the real cause; but--ay, ay, always but, to the
end of the chapter.

"Hobhouse has told me ten thousand anecdotes of Napoleon, all good and true. My friend H. is
the most entertaining of companions, and a fine fellow to boot.

"Redde a little--wrote notes and letters, and am alone, which Locke says, is bad company. 'Be
not solitary, be not idle.'--Um!--the idleness is troublesome; but I can't see so much to regret
in the solitude. The more I see of men, the less I like them. If I could but say so of women
too, all would be well. Why can't I? I am now six-and-twenty; my passions have had enough to
cool them; my affections more than enough to wither them,--and yet--and yet--always yet and
but--'Excellent well, you are a fishmonger--get thee to a nunnery.'--'They fool me to the top
of my bent.'

"Midnight.

"Began a letter, which I threw into the fire. Redde--but to little purpose. Did not visit Hobhouse,
as I promised and ought. No matter, the loss is mine. Smoked cigars.

"Napoleon!--this week will decide his fate. All seems against him; but I believe and hope he
will win--at least, beat back the invaders. What right have we to prescribe sovereigns to France?
Oh for a Republic! 'Brutus, thou sleepest.' Hobhouse abounds in continental anecdotes of this
extraordinary man; all in favour of his intellect and courage, but against his bonhommie. No
wonder;--how should he, who knows mankind well, do other than despise and abhor them?

"The greater the equality, the more impartially evil is distributed, and becomes lighter by
the division among so many--therefore, a Republic!

"More notes from Mad. de * * unanswered--and so they shall remain. I admire her abilities,
but really her society is overwhelming--an avalanche that buries one in glittering nonsense--all
snow and sophistry.

"Shall I go to Mackintosh's on Tuesday? um!--I did not go to Marquis Lansdowne's, nor to Miss
Berry's, though both are pleasant. So is Sir James's,--but I don't know--I believe one is not
the better for parties; at least, unless some regnante is there.

"I wonder how the deuce any body could make such a world; for what purpose dandies, for instance,
were ordained--and kings--and fellows of colleges--and women of 'a certain age'--and many men
of any age--and myself, most of all!

    "'Divesne prisco et natus ab Inacho,
    Nil interest, an pauper, et infimâ
      De gente, sub dio moreris,
        Victima nil miserantis Orci.
           *       *       *       *       *
    Omnes eodem cogimur.'

"Is there any thing beyond?--who knows? He that can't tell. Who tells that there is? He who
don't know. And when shall he know? perhaps, when he don't expect, and generally when he don't
wish it. In this last respect, however, all are not alike: it depends a good deal upon education,--something
upon nerves and habits--but most upon digestion.

"Saturday, Feb. 19.

"Just returned from seeing Kean in Richard. By Jove, he is a soul! Life--nature--truth without
exaggeration or diminution. Kemble's Hamlet is perfect;--but Hamlet is not Nature. Richard
is a man; and Kean is Richard. Now to my own concerns.

"Went to Waite's. Teeth all right and white; but he says that I grind them in my sleep and
chip the edges. That same sleep is no friend of mine, though I court him sometimes for half
the twenty-four.

"February 20.

"Got up and tore out two leaves of this Journal--I don't know why. Hodgson just called and
gone. He has much bonhommie with his other good qualities, and more talent than he has yet
had credit for beyond his circle.

"An invitation to dine at Holland House to meet Kean. He is worth meeting; and I hope, by getting
into good society, he will be prevented from falling like Cooke. He is greater now on the stage,
and off he should never be less. There is a stupid and under-rating criticism upon him in one
of the newspapers. I thought that, last night, though great, he rather under-acted more than
the first time. This may be the effect of these cavils; but I hope he has more sense than to
mind them. He cannot expect to maintain his present eminence, or to advance still higher, without
the envy of his green-room fellows, and the nibbling of their admirers. But, if he don't beat
them all, why then--merit hath no purchase in 'these coster-monger days.'

"I wish that I had a talent for the drama; I would write a tragedy now. But no,--it is gone.
Hodgson talks of one,--he will do it well;--and I think M--e should try. He has wonderful powers,
and much variety; besides, he has lived and felt. To write so as to bring home to the heart,
the heart must have been tried,--but, perhaps, ceased to be so. While you are under the influence
of passions, you only feel, but cannot describe them,--any more than, when in action, you could
turn round and tell the story to your next neighbour! When all is over,--all, all, and irrevocable,--trust
to memory--she is then but too faithful.

"Went out, and answered some letters, yawned now and then, and redde the Robbers. Fine,--but
Fiesco is better; and Alfieri and Monti's Aristodemo best. They are more equal than the Tedeschi
dramatists.

"Answered--or, rather acknowledged--the receipt of young Reynolds's Poem, Safie. The lad is
clever, but much of his thoughts are borrowed,--whence, the Reviewers may find out. I hate
discouraging a young one; and I think,--though wild and more oriental than he would be, had
he seen the scenes where he has placed his tale,--that he has much talent, and, certainly,
fire enough.

"Received a very singular epistle; and the mode of its conveyance, through Lord H.'s hands,
as curious as the letter itself. But it was gratifying and pretty.

"Sunday, February 27.

"Here I am, alone, instead of dining at Lord H.'s, where I was asked,--but not inclined to
go anywhere. Hobhouse says I am growing a loup garou,--a solitary hobgoblin. True;--'I am myself
alone.' The last week has been passed in reading--seeing plays--now and then visiters--sometimes
yawning and sometimes sighing, but no writing,--save of letters. If I could always read, I
should never feel the want of society. Do I regret it?--um!--'Man delights not me,' and only
one woman--at a time.

"There is something to me very softening in the presence of a woman,--some strange influence,
even if one is not in love with them,--which I cannot at all account for, having no very high
opinion of the sex. But yet,--I always feel in better humour with myself and every thing else,
if there is a woman within ken. Even Mrs. Mule[2], my fire-lighter,--the most ancient and withered
of her kind,--and (except to myself) not the best-tempered--always makes me laugh,--no difficult
task when I am 'i' the vein.'

"Heigho! I would I were in mine island!--I am not well; and yet I look in good health. At times,
I fear, 'I am not in my perfect mind;'--and yet my heart and head have stood many a crash,
and what should ail them now? They prey upon themselves, and I am sick--sick--'Prithee, undo
this button--why should a cat, a rat, a dog have life--and thou no life at all?' Six-and-twenty
years, as they call them, why, I might and should have been a Pasha by this time. 'I 'gin to
be a weary of the sun.'

"Buonaparte is not yet beaten; but has rebutted Blucher, and repiqued Swartzenburg. This it
is to have a head. If he again wins, 'Væ victis!'

[Footnote 2: This ancient housemaid, of whose gaunt and witch-like appearance it would be impossible
to convey any idea but by the pencil, furnished one among the numerous instances of Lord Byron's
proneness to attach himself to any thing, however homely, that had once enlisted his good nature
in its behalf, and become associated with his thoughts. He first found this old woman at his
lodgings in Bennet Street, where, for a whole season, she was the perpetual scarecrow of his
visiters. When, next year, he took chambers in Albany, one of the great advantages which his
friends looked to in the change was, that they should get rid of this phantom. But, no,--there
she was again--he had actually brought her with him from Bennet Street. The following year
saw him married, and, with a regular establishment of servants, in Piccadilly; and here,--as
Mrs. Mule had not made her appearance to any of the visiters,--it was concluded, rashly, that
the witch had vanished. One of those friends, however, who had most fondly indulged in this
persuasion, happening to call one day when all the male part of the establishment were abroad,
saw, to his dismay, the door opened by the same grim personage, improved considerably in point
of habiliments since he last saw her, and keeping pace with the increased scale of her master's
household, as a new peruke, and other symptoms of promotion, testified. When asked "how he
came to carry this old woman about with him from place to place," Lord Byron's only answer
was, "The poor old devil was so kind to me."]

"Sunday, March 6.

"On Tuesday last dined with Rogers,--Madame de Staël, Mackintosh, Sheridan, Erskine, and Payne
Knight, Lady Donegall and Miss R. there. Sheridan told a very good story of himself and Madame
de Recamier's handkerchief; Erskine a few stories of himself only. She is going to write a
big book about England, she says;--I believe her. Asked by her how I liked Miss * *'s thing,
called * *, and answered (very sincerely) that I thought it very bad for her, and worse than
any of the others. Afterwards thought it possible Lady Donegall, being Irish, might be a patroness
of * *, and was rather sorry for my opinion, as I hate putting people into fusses, either with
themselves or their favourites; it looks as if one did it on purpose. The party went off very
well, and the fish was very much to my gusto. Merivale is luckily a very good-natured fellow,
or, God he knows what might have been engendered from such a malaprop. I did not look at him
while this was going on, but I felt like a coal--for I like Merivale, as well as the article
in question.

"Asked to Lady Keith's to-morrow evening--I think I will go; but it is the first party invitation
I have accepted this 'season,' as the learned Fletcher called it, when that youngest brat of
Lady * *'s cut my eye and cheek open with a misdirected pebble--'Never mind, my Lord, the scar
will be gone before the season;' as if one's eye was of no importance in the mean time.

"Lord Erskine called, and gave me his famous pamphlet, with a marginal note and corrections
in his handwriting. Sent it to be bound superbly, and shall treasure it.

"Sent my fine print of Napoleon to be framed. It is framed; and the Emperor becomes his robes
as if he had been hatched in them.

"March 7.

"Rose at seven--ready by half-past eight--went to Mr. Hanson's, Berkeley Square--went to church
with his eldest daughter, Mary Anne (a good girl), and gave her away to the Earl of Portsmouth.
Saw her fairly a countess--congratulated the family and groom (bride)--drank a bumper of wine
(wholesome sherris) to their felicity, and all that--and came home. Asked to stay to dinner,
but could not. At three sat to Phillips for faces. Called on Lady M.--I like her so well, that
I always stay too long. (Mem. to mend of that.)

"Passed the evening with Hobhouse, who has begun a poem, which promises highly;--wish he would
go on with it. Heard some curious extracts from a life of Morosini, the blundering Venetian,
who blew up the Acropolis at Athens with a bomb, and be d----d to him! Waxed sleepy--just come
home--must go to bed, and am engaged to meet Sheridan to-morrow at Rogers's.

"Queer ceremony that same of marriage--saw many abroad, Greek and Catholic--one, at home, many
years ago. There be some strange phrases in the prologue (the exhortation), which made me turn
away, not to laugh in the face of the surpliceman. Made one blunder, when I joined the hands
of the happy--rammed their left hands, by mistake, into one another. Corrected it--bustled
back to the altar-rail, and said 'Amen.' Portsmouth responded as if he had got the whole by
heart; and, if any thing, was rather before the priest. It is now midnight, and * * *.

"March 10. Thor's Day.

"On Tuesday dined with Rogers,--Mackintosh, Sheridan, Sharpe,--much talk, and good,--all, except
my own little prattlement. Much of old times--Horne Tooke--the Trials--evidence of Sheridan,
and anecdotes of those times, when I, alas! was an infant. If I had been a man, I would have
made an English Lord Edward Fitzgerald.

"Set down Sheridan at Brookes's,--where, by the by, he could not have well set down himself,
as he and I were the only drinkers. Sherry means to stand for Westminster, as Cochrane (the
stock-jobbing hoaxer) must vacate. Brougham is a candidate. I fear for poor dear Sherry. Both
have talents of the highest order, but the youngster has yet a character. We shall see, if
he lives to Sherry's age, how he will pass over the redhot ploughshares of public life. I don't
know why, but I hate to see the old ones lose; particularly Sheridan, notwithstanding all his
méchanceté.

"Received many, and the kindest, thanks from Lady Portsmouth, père and mère, for my match-making.
I don't regret it, as she looks the countess well, and is a very good girl. It is odd how well
she carries her new honours. She looks a different woman, and high-bred, too. I had no idea
that I could make so good a peeress.

"Went to the play with Hobhouse. Mrs. Jordan superlative in Hoyden, and Jones well enough in
Foppington. What plays! what wit!--helas! Congreve and Vanbrugh are your only comedy. Our society
is too insipid now for the like copy. Would not go to Lady Keith's. Hobhouse thought it odd.
I wonder he should like parties. If one is in love, and wants to break a commandment and covet
any thing that is there, they do very well. But to go out amongst the mere herd, without a
motive, pleasure, or pursuit--'sdeath! 'I'll none of it.' He told me an odd report,--that I
am the actual Conrad, the veritable Corsair, and that part of my travels are supposed to have
passed in privacy. Um!--people sometimes hit near the truth; but never the whole truth. H.
don't know what I was about the year after he left the Levant; nor does any one--nor--nor--nor--however,
it is a lie--but, 'I doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth!'

"I shall have letters of importance to-morrow. Which, * *, * *, or * *? heigho!--* * is in
my heart, * * in my head, * * in my eye, and the single one, Heaven knows where. All write,
and will be answered. 'Since I have crept in favour with myself, I must maintain it;' but I
never 'mistook my person,' though I think others have.

"* * called to-day in great despair about his mistress, who has taken a freak of * * *. He
began a letter to her, but was obliged to stop short--I finished it for him, and he copied
and sent it. If he holds out, and keeps to my instructions of affected indifference, she will
lower her colours. If she don't, he will, at least, get rid of her, and she don't seem much
worth keeping. But the poor lad is in love--if that is the case, she will win. When they once
discover their power, finita e la musica.

"Sleepy, and must go to bed.

"Tuesday, March 15.

"Dined yesterday with R., Mackintosh, and Sharpe. Sheridan could not come. Sharpe told several
very amusing anecdotes of Henderson, the actor. Stayed till late, and came home, having drank
so much tea, that I did not get to sleep till six this morning. R. says I am to be in this
Quarterly--cut up, I presume, as they 'hate us youth.' N'importe. As Sharpe was passing by
the doors of some debating society (the Westminster Forum), in his way to dinner, he saw rubricked
on the walls Scott's name and mine--'Which the best poet?' being the question of the evening;
and I suppose all the Templars and would bes took our rhymes in vain, in the course of the
controversy. Which had the greater show of hands, I neither know nor care; but I feel the coupling
of the names as a compliment,--though I think Scott deserves better company.

"W.W. called--Lord Erskine, Lord Holland, &c. &c. Wrote to * * the Corsair report. She says
she don't wonder, since 'Conrad is so like.' It is odd that one, who knows me so thoroughly,
should tell me this to my face. However, if she don't know, nobody can.

"Mackintosh is, it seems, the writer of the defensive letter in the Morning Chronicle. If so,
it is very kind, and more than I did for myself.

"Told Murray to secure for me Bandello's Italian Novels at the sale to-morrow. To me they will
be nuts. Redde a satire on myself, called 'Anti-Byron,' and told Murray to publish it if he
liked. The object of the author is to prove me an atheist and a systematic conspirator against
law and government. Some of the verse is good; the prose I don't quite understand. He asserts
that my 'deleterious works' have had 'an effect upon civil society, which requires,' &c. &c.
&c. and his own poetry. It is a lengthy poem, and a long preface, with a harmonious title-page.
Like the fly in the fable, I seem to have got upon a wheel which makes much dust; but, unlike
the said fly, I do not take it all for my own raising.

"A letter from Bella, which I answered. I shall be in love with her again, if I don't take care.

"I shall begin a more regular system of reading soon.

"Thursday, March 17.

"I have been sparring with Jackson for exercise this morning; and mean to continue and renew
my acquaintance with the muffles. My chest, and arms, and wind are in very good plight, and
I am not in flesh. I used to be a hard hitter, and my arms are very long for my height (5 feet
8-1/2 inches). At any rate, exercise is good, and this the severest of all; fencing and the
broad-sword never fatigued me half so much.

"Redde the 'Quarrels of Authors' (another sort of sparring)--a new work, by that most entertaining
and researching writer, Israeli. They seem to be an irritable set, and I wish myself well out
of it. 'I'll not march through Coventry with them, that's flat.' What the devil had I to do
with scribbling? It is too late to enquire, and all regret is useless. But, an' it were to
do again,--I should write again, I suppose. Such is human nature, at least my share of it;--though
I shall think better of myself, if I have sense to stop now. If I have a wife, and that wife
has a son--by any body--I will bring up mine heir in the most anti-poetical way--make him a
lawyer, or a pirate, or--any thing. But, if he writes too, I shall be sure he is none of mine,
and cut him off with a Bank token. Must write a letter--three o'clock.

"Sunday, March 20.

"I intended to go to Lady Hardwicke's, but won't. I always begin the day with a bias towards
going to parties; but, as the evening advances, my stimulus fails, and I hardly ever go out--and,
when I do, always regret it. This might have been a pleasant one;--at least, the hostess is
a very superior woman. Lady Lansdowne's to morrow--Lady Heathcote's Wednesday. Um!--I must
spur myself into going to some of them, or it will look like rudeness, and it is better to
do as other people do--confound them!

"Redde Machiavel, parts of Chardin, and Sismondi, and Bandello--by starts. Redde the Edinburgh,
44, just come out. In the beginning of the article on 'Edgeworth's Patronage,' I have gotten
a high compliment, I perceive. I have often, since my return to England, heard Jeffrey most
highly commended by those who know him for things independent of his talents. I admire him
for this--not because he has praised me, (I have been so praised elsewhere and abused, alternately,
that mere habit has rendered me as indifferent to both as a man at twenty-six can be to any
thing,) but because he is, perhaps, the only man who, under the relations in which he and I
stand, or stood, with regard to each other, would have had the liberality to act thus; none
but a great soul dared hazard it. The height on which he stands has not made him giddy:--a
little scribbler would have gone on cavilling to the end of the chapter. As to the justice
of his panegyric, that is matter of taste. There are plenty to question it, and glad, too,
of the opportunity.

"Lord Erskine called to-day. He means to carry down his reflections on the war--or rather wars--to
the present day. I trust that he will. Must send to Mr. Murray to get the binding of my copy
of his pamphlet finished, as Lord E. has promised me to correct it, and add some marginal notes
to it. Any thing in his handwriting will be a treasure, which will gather compound interest
from years. Erskine has high expectations of Mackintosh's promised History. Undoubtedly it
must be a classic, when finished.

"Sparred with Jackson again yesterday morning, and shall to-morrow. I feel all the better for
it, in spirits, though my arms and shoulders are very stiff from it. Mem. to attend the pugilistic
dinner:--Marquess Huntley is in the chair.

"Lord Erskine thinks that ministers must be in peril of going out. So much the better for him.
To me it is the same who are in or out;--we want something more than a change of ministers,
and some day we will have it.

"I remember[3], in riding from Chrisso to Castri (Delphos), along the sides of Parnassus, I
saw six eagles in the air. It is uncommon to see so many together; and it was the number--not
the species, which is common enough--that excited my attention. I wonder what put these two
things into my head just now? I have been reading Sismondi, and there is nothing there that
could induce the recollection.

"I am mightily taken with Braccio di Montone, Giovanni Galeazzo, and Eccelino. But the last
is not Bracciaferro (of the same name), Count of Ravenna, whose history I want to trace. There
is a fine engraving in Lavater, from a picture by Fuseli, of that Ezzelin, over the body of
Meduna, punished by him for a hitch in her constancy during his absence in the Crusades. He
was right--but I want to know the story.

[Footnote 3: Part of this passage has been already extracted, but I have allowed it to remain
here in its original position, on account of the singularly sudden manner in which it is introduced.]

"Tuesday, March 22.

"Let me see--what did I see? The only person who much struck me was Lady S* *d's eldest daughter,
Lady C.L. They say she is not pretty. I don't know--every thing is pretty that pleases; but
there is an air of soul about her--and her colour changes--and there is that shyness of the
antelope (which I delight in) in her manner so much, that I observed her more than I did any
other woman in the rooms, and only looked at any thing else when I thought she might perceive
and feel embarrassed by my scrutiny. After all, there may be something of association in this.
She is a friend of Augusta's, and whatever she loves I can't help liking.

"Her mother, the Marchioness, talked to me a little; and I was twenty times on the point of
asking her to introduce me to sa fille, but I stopped short. This comes of that affray with
the Carlisles.

"Earl Grey told me laughingly of a paragraph in the last Moniteur, which has stated, among
other symptoms of rebellion, some particulars of the sensation occasioned in all our government
gazettes by the 'tear' lines,--only amplifying, in its re-statement, an epigram (by the by,
no epigram except in the Greek acceptation of the word) into a roman. I wonder the Couriers,
&c. &c., have not translated that part of the Moniteur, with additional comments.

"The Princess of Wales has requested Fuseli to paint from 'The Corsair,'--leaving to him the
choice of any passage for the subject: so Mr. Locke tells me. Tired, jaded, selfish, and supine--must
go to bed.

"Roman, at least Romance, means a song sometimes, as in the Spanish. I suppose this is the
Moniteur's meaning, unless he has confused it with 'The Corsair.'

"Albany, March 28.

"This night got into my new apartments, rented of Lord Althorpe, on a lease of seven years.
Spacious, and room for my books and sabres. In the house, too, another advantage. The last
few days, or whole week, have been very abstemious, regular in exercise, and yet very unwell.
Yesterday paid him four thousand eight hundred pounds, a debt of some standing, and which I
wished to have paid before. My mind is much relieved by the removal of that debit.

"Augusta wants me to make it up with Carlisle. I have refused every body else, but I can't
deny her any thing;--so I must e'en do it, though I had as lief 'drink up Eisel--eat a crocodile.'
Let me see--Ward, the Hollands, the Lambs, Rogers, &c. &c.--every body, more or less, have
been trying for the last two years to accommodate this couplet quarrel to no purpose. I shall
laugh if Augusta succeeds.

"Redde a little of many things--shall get in all my books to-morrow. Luckily this room will
hold them--with 'ample room and verge, &c. the characters of hell to trace.' I must set about
some employment soon; my heart begins to eat itself again.

"April 8.

"Out of town six days. On my return, find my poor little pagod, Napoleon, pushed off his pedestal;--the
thieves are in Paris. It is his own fault. Like Milo, he would rend the oak[4]; but it closed
again, wedged his hands, and now the beasts--lion, bear, down to the dirtiest jackall--may
all tear him. That Muscovite winter wedged his arms;--ever since, he has fought with his feet
and teeth. The last may still leave their marks; and 'I guess now' (as the Yankees say) that
he will yet play them a pass. He is in their rear--between them and their homes. Query--will
they ever reach them?

[Footnote 4: He adopted this thought afterwards in his Ode to Napoleon, as well as most of
the historical examples in the following paragraph.]

"Saturday, April 9. 1814.

"I mark this day!

"Napoleon Buonaparte has abdicated the throne of the world. 'Excellent well.' Methinks Sylla
did better; for he revenged and resigned in the height of his sway, red with the slaughter
of his foes--the finest instance of glorious contempt of the rascals upon record. Dioclesian
did well too--Amurath not amiss, had he become aught except a dervise--Charles the Fifth but
so so--but Napoleon, worst of all. What! wait till they were in his capital, and then talk
of his readiness to give up what is already gone!! 'What whining monk art thou--what holy cheat?'
'Sdeath!--Dionysius at Corinth was yet a king to this. The 'Isle of Elba' to retire to!--Well--if
it had been Caprea, I should have marvelled less. 'I see men's minds are but a parcel of their
fortunes.' I am utterly bewildered and confounded.

"I don't know--but I think I, even I (an insect compared with this creature), have set my life
on casts not a millionth part of this man's. But, after all, a crown may be not worth dying
for. Yet, to outlive Lodi for this!!! Oh that Juvenal or Johnson could rise from the dead!
'Expende--quot libras in duce summo invenies?' I knew they were light in the balance of mortality;
but I thought their living dust weighed more carats. Alas! this imperial diamond hath a flaw

"I do not know that I am happiest when alone; but this I am sure of, that I never am long in
the society even of her I love, (God knows too well, and the devil probably too,) without a
yearning for the company of my lamp and my utterly confused and tumbled-over library.[5] Even
in the day, I send away my carriage oftener than I use or abuse it. Per esempio,--I have not
stirred out of these rooms for these four days past: but I have sparred for exercise (windows
open) with Jackson an hour daily, to attenuate and keep up the ethereal part of me. The more
violent the fatigue, the better my spirits for the rest of the day; and then, my evenings have
that calm nothingness of languor, which I most delight in. To-day I have boxed one hour--written
an ode to Napoleon Buonaparte--copied it--eaten six biscuits--drunk four bottles of soda water--redde
away the rest of my time--besides giving poor * * a world of advice about this mistress of
his, who is plaguing him into a phthisic and intolerable tediousness. I am a pretty fellow
truly to lecture about 'the sect.' No matter, my counsels are all thrown away.

reading better, and would rather be employed in reading than in the most agreeable conversation."]

the highest and the lowest only,--to the emperor and the beggar, when unsixpenced and unthroned.

upon maps and measurement.

    "'And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death.'

I will keep no further journal of that same hesternal torch-light; and, to prevent me from
returning, like a dog, to the vomit of memory, I tear out the remaining leaves of this volume,
and write, in Ipecacuanha,--'that the Bourbons are restored!!!'--'Hang up philosophy.' To be

further illustrated.

     "Sunday, Jan. 2. 1814.

     "Excuse this dirty paper--it is the penultimate half-sheet of a
     quire. Thanks for your book and the Ln. Chron., which I return. The
     Corsair is copied, and now at Lord Holland's; but I wish Mr.
     Gifford to have it to-night.

     "Mr. Dallas is very perverse; so that I have offended both him
     and you, when I really meaned to do good, at least to one, and
     certainly not to annoy either.[6] But I shall manage him, I
     hope.--I am pretty confident of the Tale itself; but one cannot
     be sure. If I get it from Lord Holland, it shall be sent.

     "Yours," &c.

[Footnote 6: He had made a present of the copyright of "The Corsair" to Mr. Dallas, who thus
describes the manner in which the gift was bestowed:--"On the 28th of December, I called in
the morning on Lord Byron, whom I found composing 'The Corsair.' He had been working upon it
but a few days, and he read me the portion he had written. After some observations, he said,
'I have a great mind--I will.' He then added that he should finish it soon, and asked me to
accept of the copyright. I was much surprised. He had, before he was aware of the value of
his works, declared that he never would take money for them, and that I should have the whole
advantage of all he wrote. This declaration became morally void when the question was about
thousands, instead of a few hundreds; and I perfectly agree with the admired and admirable
author of Waverley, that 'the wise and good accept not gifts which are made in heat of blood,
and which may be after repented of.'--I felt this on the sale of 'Childe Harold,' and observed
it to him. The copyright of 'The Giaour' and 'The Bride of Abydos' remained undisposed of,
though the poems were selling rapidly, nor had I the slightest notion that he would ever again
give me a copyright. But as he continued in the resolution of not appropriating the sale of
his works to his own use, I did not scruple to accept that of 'The Corsair,' and I thanked
him. He asked me to call and hear the portions read as he wrote them. I went every morning,
and was astonished at the rapidity of his composition. He gave me the poem complete on New-year's
day, 1814, saying, that my acceptance of it gave him great pleasure, and that I was fully at
liberty to publish it with any bookseller I pleased, independent of the profit."

Out of this last-mentioned permission arose the momentary embarrassment between the noble poet
and his publisher, to which the above notes allude.]

     "January 6. 1814.

     "I have got a devil of a long story in the press, entitled 'The
     Corsair,' in the regular heroic measure. It is a pirate's isle,
     peopled with my own creatures, and you may easily suppose they do a
     world of mischief through the three cantos. Now for your
     dedication--if you will accept it. This is positively my last
     experiment on public literary opinion, till I turn my thirtieth
     year,--if so be I flourish until that downhill period. I have a
     confidence for you--a perplexing one to me, and, just at present,
     in a state of abeyance in itself.

     "However, we shall see. In the mean time, you may amuse yourself
     with my suspense, and put all the justices of peace in requisition,
     in case I come into your county with 'hackbut bent.'

     "Seriously, whether I am to hear from her or him, it is a pause,
     which I shall fill up with as few thoughts of my own as I can
     borrow from other people. Any thing is better than stagnation; and
     now, in the interregnum of my autumn and a strange summer
     adventure, which I don't like to think of, (I don't mean * *'s,
     however, which is laughable only,) the antithetical state of my
     lucubrations makes me alive, and Macbeth can 'sleep no more:'--he
     was lucky in getting rid of the drowsy sensation of waking again.

     "Pray write to me. I must send you a copy of the letter of
     dedication. When do you come out? I am sure we don't clash this
     time, for I am all at sea, and in action,--and a wife, and a
     mistress, &c.

     "Thomas, thou art a happy fellow; but if you wish us to be so, you
     must come up to town, as you did last year: and we shall have a
     world to say, and to see, and to hear. Let me hear from you.

     "P.S. Of course you will keep my secret, and don't even talk in
     your sleep of it. Happen what may, your dedication is ensured,
     being already written; and I shall copy it out fair to-night, in
     case business or amusement--Amant alterna Camænæ."

     previous notice, I send you two, and I will tell you why two.
     The first, Mr. M., who sometimes takes upon him the critic (and I
     bear it from astonishment), says, may do you harm--God
     forbid!--this alone makes me listen to him. The fact is, he is a
     damned Tory, and has, I dare swear, something of self, which I
     cannot divine, at the bottom of his objection, as it is the
     allusion to Ireland to which he objects. But he be d----d--though a
     good fellow enough (your sinner would not be worth a d----n).

     "Take your choice;--no one, save he and Mr. Dallas, has seen
     either, and D. is quite on my side, and for the first.[8] If I can
     but testify to you and the world how truly I admire and esteem you,
     I shall be quite satisfied. As to prose, I don't know Addison's
     from Johnson's; but I will try to mend my cacology. Pray perpend,
     pronounce, and don't be offended with either.

     "My last epistle would probably put you in a fidget. But the devil,
     who ought to be civil on such occasions, proved so, and took my
     letter to the right place.

     "Is it not odd?--the very fate I said she had escaped from * *, she
     has now undergone from the worthy * *. Like Mr. Fitzgerald, shall I
     not lay claim to the character of 'Vates?'--as he did in the
     Morning Herald for prophesying the fall of Buonaparte,--who, by
     the by, I don't think is yet fallen. I wish he would rally and
     route your legitimate sovereigns, having a mortal hate to all royal
     entails.--But I am scrawling a treatise. Good night. Ever," &c.

     "I had written to you a long letter of dedication, which I
     suppress, because, though it contained something relating to you
     which every one had been glad to hear, yet there was too much about
     politics, and poesy, and all things whatsoever, ending with that
     topic on which most men are fluent, and none very amusing--one's
     self. It might have been re-written--but to what purpose? In
     availing myself of your friendly permission to inscribe this poem
     to you, I can only wish the offering were as worthy your acceptance

in these notes, but frequently on the proof-sheets themselves. Thus, a passage in the dedication
having been printed "the first of her bands in estimation," he writes in the margin, "bards,
not bands--was there ever such a stupid misprint?" and, in correcting a line that had been
curtailed of its due number of syllables, he says, "Do not omit words--it is quite enough to

     "You will be glad to hear of my safe arrival here. The time of my
     return will depend upon the weather, which is so impracticable,
     that this letter has to advance through more snows than ever
     opposed the Emperor's retreat. The roads are impassable, and return
     impossible for the present; which I do not regret, as I am much at
     my ease, and six-and-twenty complete this day--a very pretty age,
     if it would always last. Our coals are excellent, our fire-places
     large, my cellar full, and my head empty; and I have not yet
     recovered my joy at leaving London. If any unexpected turn occurred
     with my purchasers, I believe I should hardly quit the place at
     all; but shut my door, and let my beard grow.

     "I forgot to mention (and I hope it is unnecessary) that the lines
     beginning--Remember him, &c. must not appear with The
     Corsair. You may slip them in with the smaller pieces newly
     annexed to Childe Harold; but on no account permit them to be
     appended to The Corsair. Have the goodness to recollect this
     particularly.

     "The books I have brought with me are a great consolation for the
     confinement, and I bought more as we came along. In short, I never
     consult the thermometer, and shall not put up prayers for a thaw,
     unless I thought it would sweep away the rascally invaders of
     France. Was ever such a thing as Blucher's proclamation?

     "Just before I left town, Kemble paid me the compliment of desiring
     me to write a tragedy; I wish I could, but I find my scribbling
     mood subsiding--not before it was time; but it is lucky to check it
     at all. If I lengthen my letter, you will think it is coming on
     again; so, good-by.

     "I open my letter to thank you for yours just received. The 'Lines
     to a Lady Weeping' must go with The Corsair. I care nothing for
     consequence, on this point. My politics are to me like a young
     mistress to an old man--the worse they grow, the fonder I become of
     them. As Mr. Gilford likes the 'Portuguese Translation[11],' pray
     insert it as an addition to The Corsair.

     "In all points of difference between Mr. Gifford and Mr. Dallas,
     let the first keep his place; and in all points of difference
     between Mr. Gifford and Mr. Anybody-else, I shall abide by the
     former; if I am wrong, I can't help it. But I would rather not be
     right with any other person. So there is an end of that matter.
     After all the trouble he has taken about me and mine, I should be
     very ungrateful to feel or act otherwise. Besides, in point of
     judgment, he is not to be lowered by a comparison. In politics,
     he may be right too; but that with me is a feeling, and I can't
     torify my nature."

to try another version of this ingenious thought, which is, perhaps, still more happy, and
has never, I believe, appeared in print.

     "I need not say that your obliging letter was very welcome, and not
     the less so for being unexpected.

     "It doubtless gratifies me much that our finale has pleased, and
     that the curtain drops gracefully.[12] You deserve it should, for
     your promptitude and good nature in arranging immediately with Mr.
     Dallas; and I can assure you that I esteem your entering so warmly
     into the subject, and writing to me so soon upon it, as a personal
     obligation. We shall now part, I hope, satisfied with each other. I
     was and am quite in earnest in my prefatory promise not to
     intrude any more; and this not from any affectation, but a thorough
     conviction that it is the best policy, and is at least respectful
     to my readers, as it shows that I would not willingly run the risk
     of forfeiting their favour in future. Besides, I have other views
     and objects, and think that I shall keep this resolution; for,
     since I left London, though shut up, snow-bound, thaw-bound,
     and tempted with all kinds of paper, the dirtiest of ink, and the
     bluntest of pens, I have not even been haunted by a wish to put
     them to their combined uses, except in letters of business. My
     rhyming propensity is quite gone, and I feel much as I did at
     Patras on recovering from my fever--weak, but in health, and only
     afraid of a relapse. I do most fervently hope I never shall.

     "I see by the Morning Chronicle there hath been discussion in the
     Courier; and I read in the Morning Post a wrathful letter about
     Mr. Moore, in which some Protestant Reader has made a sad confusion
     about India and Ireland.

     "You are to do as you please about the smaller poems; but I think
     removing them now from The Corsair looks like fear; and if so,
     you must allow me not to be pleased. I should also suppose that,
     after the fuss of these newspaper esquires, they would materially
     assist the circulation of The Corsair; an object I should imagine
     at present of more importance to yourself than Childe Harold's
     seventh appearance. Do as you like; but don't allow the withdrawing
     that poem to draw any imputation of dismay upon me.

     "Pray make my respects to Mr. Ward, whose praise I value most
     highly, as you well know; it is in the approbation of such men that
     fame becomes worth having. To Mr. Gifford I am always grateful,
     and surely not less so now than ever. And so good night to my
     authorship.

     "I have been sauntering and dozing here very quietly, and not
     unhappily. You will be happy to hear that I have completely
     established my title-deeds as marketable, and that the purchaser
     has succumbed to the terms, and fulfils them, or is to fulfil them
     forthwith. He is now here, and we go on very amicably
     together,--one in each wing of the Abbey. We set off on Sunday--I
     for town, he for Cheshire.

     "Mrs. Leigh is with me--much pleased with the place, and less so
     with me for parting with it, to which not even the price can
     reconcile her. Your parcel has not yet arrived--at least the
     Mags. &c.; but I have received Childe Harold and The Corsair.

     "I believe both are very correctly printed, which is a great
     satisfaction.

     "I thank you for wishing me in town; but I think one's success is
     most felt at a distance, and I enjoy my solitary self-importance in
     an agreeable sulky way of my own, upon the strength of your
     letter--for which I once more thank you, and am, very truly, &c.

     "P.S. Don't you think Buonaparte's next publication will be
     rather expensive to the Allies? Perry's Paris letter of yesterday
     looks very reviving. What a Hydra and Briareus it is! I wish they
     would pacify: there is no end to this campaigning."

     "I quite forgot, in my answer of yesterday, to mention that I have
     no means of ascertaining whether the Newark Pirate has been doing
     what you say.[13] If so, he is a rascal, and a shabby rascal too;
     and if his offence is punishable by law or pugilism, he shall be
     fined or buffeted. Do you try and discover, and I will make some
     enquiry here. Perhaps some other in town may have gone on
     printing, and used the same deception.

     "The fac-simile is omitted in Childe Harold, which is very
     awkward, as there is a note expressly on the subject. Pray
     replace it as usual.

     "On second and third thoughts, the withdrawing the small poems from
     The Corsair (even to add to Childe Harold) looks like shrinking and
     shuffling after the fuss made upon one of them by the Tories. Pray
     replace them in The Corsair's appendix. I am sorry that Childe
     Harold requires some and such abetments to make him move off; but,
     if you remember, I told you his popularity would not be permanent.
     It is very lucky for the author that he had made up his mind to a
     temporary reputation in time. The truth is, I do not think that any
     of the present day (and least of all, one who has not consulted the
     flattering side of human nature,) have much to hope from posterity;
     and you may think it affectation very probably, but, to me, my
     present and past success has appeared very singular, since it was
     in the teeth of so many prejudices. I almost think people like to
     be contradicted. If Childe Harold flags, it will hardly be worth
     while to go on with the engravings: but do as you please; I have
     done with the whole concern; and the enclosed lines, written years
     ago, and copied from my skull-cap, are among the last with which
     you will be troubled. If you like, add them to Childe Harold, if
     only for the sake of another outcry. You received so long an answer
     yesterday, that I will not intrude on you further than to repeat
     myself,

     "Yours, &c.

     "P.S. Of course, in reprinting (if you have occasion), you will
     take great care to be correct. The present editions seem very much

     responsible occurs twice nearly together; correct the second into
     answerable."

     Royal hedgehog are those which possess a torpedo property, and may
     benumb some of my friends. I am quite silent, and 'hush'd in grim
     repose.' The frequency of the assaults has weakened their
     effects,--if ever they had any;--and, if they had had much, I
     should hardly have held my tongue, or withheld my fingers. It is
     something quite new to attack a man for abandoning his resentments.
     I have heard that previous praise and subsequent vituperation were
     rather ungrateful, but I did not know that it was wrong to
     endeavour to do justice to those who did not wait till I had made
     some amends for former and boyish prejudices, but received me into
     their friendship, when I might still have been their enemy.

     fortune like Sir Francis Wronghead. It were better if there were
     more merit in my independence, but it really is something nowadays
     to be independent at all, and the less temptation to be
     otherwise, the more uncommon the case, in these times of
     paradoxical servility. I believe that most of our hates and likings

     "The Courier of this evening accuses me of having 'received and
     pocketed' large sums for my works. I have never yet received, nor
     wish to receive, a farthing for any. Mr. Murray offered a thousand
     for The Giaour and Bride of Abydos, which I said was too much, and
     that if he could afford it at the end of six months, I would then
     direct how it might be disposed of; but neither then, nor at any
     other period, have I ever availed myself of the profits on my own
     account. For the republication of the Satire I refused four
     hundred guineas; and for the previous editions I never asked nor
     received a sous, nor for any writing whatever. I do not wish you
     to do any thing disagreeable to yourself; there never was nor shall
     be any conditions nor stipulations with regard to any accommodation
     that I could afford you; and, on your part, I can see nothing

In consequence of this letter, Mr. Dallas addressed an explanation to one of the newspapers,
of which the following is a part;--the remainder being occupied with a rather clumsily managed
defence of his noble benefactor on the subject of the Stanzas.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING POST.

     "Sir,

     "I have seen the paragraph in an evening paper, in which Lord Byron
     is accused of 'receiving and pocketing' large sums for his works.
     I believe no one who knows him has the slightest suspicion of this
     kind; but the assertion being public, I think it a justice I owe
     to Lord Byron to contradict it publicly. I address this letter to
     you for that purpose, and I am happy that it gives me an
     opportunity at this moment to make some observations which I have
     for several days been anxious to do publicly, but from which I have
     been restrained by an apprehension that I should be suspected of
     being prompted by his Lordship.

     "I take upon me to affirm, that Lord Byron never received a
     shilling for any of his works. To my certain knowledge, the profits
     of the Satire were left entirely to the publisher of it. The gift
     of the copyright of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage I have already
     publicly acknowledged in the dedication of the new edition of my
     novels; and I now add my acknowledgment for that of The Corsair,
     not only for the profitable part of it, but for the delicate and
     delightful manner of bestowing it while yet unpublished. With
     respect to his two other poems, The Giaour and The Bride of Abydos,
     Mr. Murray, the publisher of them, can truly attest that no part of
     the sale of them has ever touched his hands, or been disposed of
     for his use. Having said thus much as to facts, I cannot but
     express my surprise that it should ever be deemed a matter of
     reproach that he should appropriate the pecuniary returns of his
     works. Neither rank nor fortune seems to me to place any man above
     this; for what difference does it make in honour and noble
     feelings, whether a copyright be bestowed, or its value employed,
     in beneficent purposes? I differ with my Lord Byron on this subject
     as well as some others; and he has constantly, both by word and
     action, shown his aversion to receiving money for his productions."

LETTER. 163. TO MR. MOORE.

     "February 26. 1814.

     "Dallas had, perhaps, have better kept silence;--but that was his
     concern, and, as his facts are correct, and his motive not
     dishonourable to himself, I wished him well through it. As for his
     interpretations of the lines, he and any one else may interpret
     them as they please. I have and shall adhere to my taciturnity,
     unless something very particular occurs to render this impossible.
     Do not you say a word. If any one is to speak, it is the person
     principally concerned. The most amusing thing is, that every one
     (to me) attributes the abuse to the man they personally most
     dislike!--some say C * * r, some C * * e, others F * * d, &c. &c.
     &c. I do not know, and have no clue but conjecture. If discovered,
     and he turns out a hireling, he must be left to his wages; if a
     cavalier, he must 'wink, and hold out his iron.'

     "I had some thoughts of putting the question to C * * r, but H.,
     who, I am sure, would not dissuade me if it were right, advised me
     by all means not;--'that I had no right to take it upon
     suspicion,' &c. &c. Whether H. is correct I am not aware, but he
     believes himself so, and says there can be but one opinion on that
     subject. This I am, at least, sure of, that he would never prevent
     me from doing what he deemed the duty of a preux chevalier. In
     such cases--at least, in this country--we must act according to
     usages. In considering this instance, I dismiss my own personal
     feelings. Any man will and must fight, when necessary,--even
     without a motive. Here, I should take it up really without much
     resentment; for, unless a woman one likes is in the way, it is some
     years since I felt a long anger. But, undoubtedly, could I, or
     may I, trace it to a man of station, I should and shall do what is
     proper.

     "* * was angerly, but tried to conceal it. You are not called
     upon to avow the 'Twopenny,' and would only gratify them by so
     doing. Do you not see the great object of all these fooleries is to
     set him, and you, and me, and all persons whatsoever, by the
     ears?--more especially those who are on good terms,--and nearly
     succeeded. Lord H. wished me to concede to Lord Carlisle--concede
     to the devil!--to a man who used me ill? I told him, in answer,
     that I would neither concede, nor recede on the subject, but be
     silent altogether; unless any thing more could be said about Lady
     H. and himself, who had been since my very good friends;--and there
     it ended. This was no time for concessions to Lord C.

     ever, my dear Moore," &c.

Another of his friends having expressed, soon after, some intention of volunteering publicly
in his defence, he lost no time in repressing him by the following sensible letter:--

LETTER 169. TO W * * W * *, ESQ.

     "My dear W.,

     "I have but a few moments to write to you. Silence is the only
     answer to the things you mention; nor should I regard that man as
     my friend who said a word more on the subject. I care little for
     attacks, but I will not submit to defences; and I do hope and
     trust that you have never entertained a serious thought of
     engaging in so foolish a controversy. Dallas's letter was, to his
     credit, merely as to facts which he had a right to state; I
     neither have nor shall take the least public notice, nor permit
     any one else to do so. If I discover the writer, then I may act in
     a different manner; but it will not be in writing.

     "An expression in your letter has induced me to write this to you,
     to entreat you not to interfere in any way in such a business,--it
     is now nearly over, and depend upon it they are much more
     chagrined by my silence than they could be by the best defence in

LETTER 170. TO MR. MOORE.

     "March 3. 1814.

     "My dear Friend,

     "I have a great mind to tell you that I am 'uncomfortable,' if
     only to make you come to town; where no one ever more delighted in
     seeing you, nor is there any one to whom I would sooner turn for
     consolation in my most vapourish moments. The truth is, I have 'no
     lack of argument' to ponder upon of the most gloomy description,
     but this arises from other causes. Some day or other, when we are
     veterans, I may tell you a tale of present and past times; and it
     is not from want of confidence that I do not now,--but--but--always
     a but to the end of the chapter.

     "There is nothing, however, upon the spot either to love or
     hate;--but I certainly have subjects for both at no very great
     distance, and am besides embarrassed between three whom I know,
     and one (whose name, at least,) I do not know. All this would be
     very well if I had no heart; but, unluckily, I have found that
     there is such a thing still about me, though in no very good
     repair, and, also, that it has a habit of attaching itself to one
     whether I will or no. 'Divide et impera,' I begin to think, will
     only do for politics.

     "If I discover the 'toad' as you call him, I shall 'tread,'--and
     put spikes in my shoes to do it more effectually. The effect of all
     these fine things I do not enquire much nor perceive. I believe * *
     felt them more than either of us. People are civil enough, and I
     have had no dearth of invitations,--none of which, however, I have
     accepted. I went out very little last year, and mean to go about
     still less. I have no passion for circles, and have long regretted
     that I ever gave way to what is called a town life;--which, of all
     the lives I ever saw (and they are nearly as many as Plutarch's),
     seems to me to leave the least for the past and future.

     "How proceeds the poem? Do not neglect it, and I have no fears. I
     need not say to you that your fame is dear to me,--I really might
     say dearer than my own; for I have lately begun to think my
     things have been strangely over-rated; and, at any rate, whether or
     not, I have done with them for ever. I may say to you what I would
     not say to every body, that the last two were written, The Bride in
     four, and The Corsair in ten days[20],--which I take to be a most
     humiliating confession, as it proves my own want of judgment in
     publishing, and the public's in reading things, which cannot have
     stamina for permanent attention. 'So much for Buckingham.'

     "I have no dread of your being too hasty, and I have still less of
     your failing. But I think a year a very fair allotment of time to
     a composition which is not to be Epic; and even Horace's 'Nonum
     prematur' must have been intended for the Millennium, or some
     longer-lived generation than ours. I wonder how much we should have
     had of him, had he observed his own doctrines to the letter.
     Peace be with you! Remember that I am always and most truly yours,
     &c.

     "P.S. I never heard the 'report' you mention, nor, I dare say, many
     others. But, in course, you, as well as others, have 'damned
     good-natured friends,' who do their duty in the usual way. One
     thing will make you laugh. * * * *"

[Footnote 20: In asserting that he devoted but four days to the composition of The Bride, he
must be understood to refer only to the first sketch of that poem,--the successive additions
by which it was increased to its present length having occupied, as we have seen, a much longer
period. The Corsair, on the contrary, was, from beginning to end, struck off at a heat--there
being but little alteration or addition afterwards,--and the rapidity with which it was produced
(being at the rate of nearly two hundred lines a day) would be altogether incredible, had we
not his own, as well as his publisher's, testimony to the fact. Such an achievement,--taking
into account the surpassing beauty of the work,--is, perhaps, wholly without a parallel in
the history of Genius, and shows that 'écrire par passion,' as Rousseau expresses it, may be
sometimes a shorter road to perfection than any that Art has ever struck out.]

     and whatever years may precede or succeed it, I shall mark it with
     the 'white stone' in my calendar. I am not sure that I shall not
     soon be in your neighbourhood again. If so, and I am alone (as will
     probably be the case), I shall invade and carry you off, and

     think the Tears have a natural right to be bagged, and the editor
     (whoever he may be) might supply a facetious note or not, as he
     pleased.

     "I cannot conceive how the Vault[21] has got about,--but so it
     is. It is too farouche; but, truth to say, my satires are not
     very playful. I have the plan of an epistle in my head, at him

     it. I should say little or nothing of myself. As to mirth and

     accident, I could 'tell him what he is--I know him well.'

     "I meant, my dear M., to write to you a long letter, but I am
     hurried, and time clips my inclination down to yours, &c.

     "P.S. Think again before you shelf your poem. There is a
     youngster, (older than me, by the by, but a younger poet,) Mr. G.
     Knight, with a vol. of Eastern Tales, written since his
     return,--for he has been in the countries. He sent to me last
     summer, and I advised him to write one in each measure, without
     any intention, at that time, of doing the same thing. Since that,
     from a habit of writing in a fever, I have anticipated him in the
     variety of measures, but quite unintentionally. Of the stories, I
     know nothing, not having seen them[22]; but he has some lady in a
     sack, too, like The Giaour:--he told me at the time.

[Footnote 21: Those bitter and powerful lines which he wrote on the opening of the vault that
contained the remains of Henry VIII. and Charles I.]

[Footnote 22: He was not yet aware, it appears, that the anonymous manuscript sent to him by
his publisher was from the pen of Mr. Knight.]

LETTER 172. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "March 12. 1814.

     "I have not time to read the whole MS. [23], but what I have seen
     seems very well written (both prose and verse), and, though I
     am and can be no judge (at least a fair one on this subject),
     containing nothing which you ought to hesitate publishing upon
     my account. If the author is not Dr. Busby himself, I think it
     a pity, on his own account, that he should dedicate it to his
     subscribers; nor can I perceive what Dr. Busby has to do with the
     matter except as a translator of Lucretius, for whose doctrines he
     is surely not responsible. I tell you openly, and really most
     sincerely, that, if published at all, there is no earthly reason
     why you should not; on the contrary, I should receive it as the
     greatest compliment you could pay to your good opinion of my
     candour, to print and circulate that or any other work, attacking
     me in a manly manner, and without any malicious intention, from
     which, as far as I have seen, I must exonerate this writer.

     "He is wrong in one thing--I am no atheist; but if he thinks I
     have published principles tending to such opinions, he has a
     perfect right to controvert them. Pray publish it; I shall never
     forgive myself if I think that I have prevented you.

     "Make my compliments to the author, and tell him I wish him
     success: his verse is very deserving of it; and I shall be the last
     person to suspect his motives. Yours, &c.

     "P.S. If you do not publish it, some one else will. You cannot
     suppose me so narrow-minded as to shrink from discussion. I repeat
     once for all, that I think it a good poem (as far as I have redde);
     and that is the only point you should consider. How odd that
     eight lines should have given birth, I really think, to eight
     thousand, including all that has been said, and will be on the
     subject!"

seriously--that he would give his opinion as to the propriety of publishing it.]

LETTER 174. TO MR. MOORE.

     "2. Albany, April 9. 1814.

     "Viscount Althorp is about to be married, and I have gotten his
     spacious bachelor apartments in Albany, to which you will, I hope,
     address a speedy answer to this mine epistle.

     "I am but just returned to town, from which you may infer that I
     have been out of it; and I have been boxing, for exercise, with
     Jackson for this last month daily. I have also been drinking, and,
     on one occasion, with three other friends at the Cocoa Tree, from
     six till four, yea, unto five in the matin. We clareted and
     champagned till two--then supped, and finished with a kind of
     regency punch composed of madeira, brandy, and green tea, no
     real water being admitted therein. There was a night for you!
     without once quitting the table, except to ambulate home, which I
     did alone, and in utter contempt of a hackney-coach and my own
     vis, both of which were deemed necessary for our conveyance. And
     so,--I am very well, and they say it will hurt my constitution.

     "I have also, more or less, been breaking a few of the favourite
     commandments; but I mean to pull up and marry, if any one will have
     me. In the mean time, the other day I nearly killed myself with a
     collar of brawn, which I swallowed for supper, and indigested for
     I don't know how long: but that is by the by. All this gourmandise
     was in honour of Lent; for I am forbidden meat all the rest of the
     year, but it is strictly enjoined me during your solemn fast. I
     have been, and am, in very tolerable love; but of that hereafter as
     it may be.

     "My dear Moore, say what you will in your preface; and quiz any
     thing or any body,--me if you like it. Oons! dost thou think me of
     the old, or rather elderly, school? If one can't jest with
     one's friends, with whom can we be facetious? You have nothing to
     fear from * *, whom I have not seen, being out of town when he
     called. He will be very correct, smooth, and all that, but I doubt
     whether there will be any 'grace beyond the reach of art;'--and,
     whether there is or not, how long will you be so d----d modest? As
     for Jeffrey, it is a very handsome thing of him to speak well of an
     old antagonist,--and what a mean mind dared not do. Any one will
     revoke praise; but--were it not partly my own case--I should say
     that very few have strength of mind to unsay their censure, or
     follow it up with praise of other things.

     "What think you of the review of Levis? It beats the Bag and my
     hand-grenade hollow, as an invective, and hath thrown the Court
     into hysterics, as I hear from very good authority. Have you heard
     from * * *?

     "No more rhyme for--or rather, from--me. I have taken my leave of
     that stage, and henceforth will mountebank it no longer. I have had
     my day, and there's an end. The utmost I expect, or even wish, is
     to have it said in the Biographia Britannica, that I might perhaps
     have been a poet, had I gone on and amended. My great comfort is,
     that the temporary celebrity I have wrung from the world has been
     in the very teeth of all opinions and prejudices. I have flattered
     no ruling powers; I have never concealed a single thought that
     tempted me. They can't say I have truckled to the times, nor to
     popular topics, (as Johnson, or somebody, said of Cleveland,) and
     whatever I have gained has been at the expenditure of as much
     personal favour as possible; for I do believe never was a bard
     more unpopular, quoad homo, than myself. And now I have
     done;--'ludite nunc alios.' Every body may be d----d, as they seem
     fond of it, and resolve to stickle lustily for endless brimstone.
     Murray would not publish it, for which he was a fool, and so I told
     him; but some one else will, doubtless. 'Something too much of
     this.'

     "Your French scheme is good, but let it be Italian; all the
     Angles will be at Paris. Let it be Rome, Milan, Naples, Florence,
     Turin, Venice, or Switzerland, and 'egad!' (as Bayes saith,) I will
     connubiate and join you; and we will write a new 'Inferno' in our
     Paradise. Pray think of this--and I will really buy a wife and a
     ring, and say the ceremony, and settle near you in a summer-house
     upon the Arno, or the Po, or the Adriatic.

     "Ah! my poor little pagod, Napoleon, has walked off his pedestal.
     He has abdicated, they say. This would draw molten brass from the
     eyes of Zatanai. What! 'kiss the ground before young Malcolm's
     feet, and then be baited by the rabble's curse!' I cannot bear
     such a crouching catastrophe. I must stick to Sylla, for my modern
     favourites don't do,--their resignations are of a different kind.
     All health and prosperity, my dear Moore. Excuse this lengthy
     letter. Ever, &c.

     "P.S. The Quarterly quotes you frequently in an article on America;
     and every body I know asks perpetually after you and yours. When
     will you answer them in person?"

     "I am very glad to hear that you are to be transient from
     Mayfield so very soon, and was taken in by the first part of your
     letter.[24] Indeed, for aught I know, you may be treating me, as
     Slipslop says, with 'ironing' even now. I shall say nothing of the
     shock, which had nothing of humeur in it; as I am apt to take
     even a critic, and still more a friend, at his word, and never to
     doubt that I have been writing cursed nonsense, if they say so.
     There was a mental reservation in my pact with the public[25], in
     behalf of anonymes; and, even had there not, the provocation was
     such as to make it physically impossible to pass over this damnable
     epoch of triumphant tameness. 'Tis a cursed business; and, after
     all, I shall think higher of rhyme and reason, and very humbly of
     your heroic people, till--Elba becomes a volcano, and sends him
     out again. I can't think it all over yet.

     "My departure for the Continent depends, in some measure, on the
     incontinent. I have two country invitations at home, and don't
     know what to say or do. In the mean time, I have bought a macaw and
     a parrot, and have got up my books; and I box and fence daily, and
     go out very little.

     "At this present writing, Louis the Gouty is wheeling in triumph
     into Piccadilly, in all the pomp and rabblement of royalty. I had
     an offer of seats to see them pass; but, as I have seen a Sultan
     going to mosque, and been at his reception of an ambassador, the
     most Christian King 'hath no attractions for me:'--though in some
     coming year of the Hegira, I should not dislike to see the place
     where he had reigned, shortly after the second revolution, and a
     happy sovereignty of two months, the last six weeks being civil
     war.

     "Pray write, and deem me ever," &c.

[Footnote 24: I had begun my letter in the following manner:--"Have you seen the 'Ode to Napoleon
Buonaparte?'--I suspect it to be either F----g----d's or Rosa Matilda's. Those rapid and masterly
portraits of all the tyrants that preceded Napoleon have a vigour in them which would incline
me to say that Rosa Matilda is the person--but then, on the other hand, that powerful grasp
of history," &c. &c. After a little more of this mock parallel, the letter went on thus:--"I
should like to know what you think of the matter?--Some friends of mine here will insist that
it is the work of the author of Childe Harold,--but then they are not so well read in F----g----d
and Rosa Matilda as I am; and, besides, they seem to forget that you promised, about a month
or two ago, not to write any more for years. Seriously," &c. &c.

I quote this foolish banter merely to show how safely, even on his most sensitive points, one
might venture to jest with him.]

to write without fear for five-and-twenty years longer, but write poetry, notwithstanding your

     lines being worth printing; at any rate, I must see them again and
     alter some passages, before they go forth in any shape into the

     then--channel of publication will do.

[Footnote 26: Mr. Murray had requested of him to make some additions to the Ode, so as to save
the stamp duty imposed upon publications not exceeding a single sheet; and he afterwards added,
in successive editions, five or six stanzas, the original number being but eleven. There were
also three more stanzas, which he never printed, but which, for the just tribute they contain
to Washington, are worthy of being preserved:--

    "There was a day--there was an hour,
      While earth was Gaul's--Gaul thine--

      Unsated to resign

     of the Ode separately, but incorporate it with any of the other
     things, and include the smaller poem too (in that case)--which I
     must previously correct, nevertheless. I can't, for the head of me,
     add a line worth scribbling; my 'vein' is quite gone, and my
     present occupations are of the gymnastic order--boxing and
     fencing--and my principal conversation is with my macaw and Bayle.
     I want my Moreri, and I want Athenæus.

     worth a thousand odes of anybody's. I suppose I may keep this
     copy;--after reading it, I really regret having written my own. I
     say this very sincerely, albeit unused to think humbly of myself.

     "I don't like the additional stanzas at all, and they had better
     be left out. The fact is, I can't do any thing I am asked to do,
     however gladly I would; and at the end of a week my interest in a
     composition goes off. This will account to you for my doing no
     better for your 'Stamp Duty' postscript.

     "The S.R. is very civil--but what do they mean by Childe Harold
     resembling Marmion? and the next two, Giaour and Bride, not
     resembling Scott? I certainly never intended to copy him; but, if
     there be any copyism, it must be in the two poems, where the same
     versification is adopted. However, they exempt The Corsair from all
     resemblance to any thing, though I rather wonder at his escape.

     "If ever I did any thing original, it was in Childe Harold, which
     I prefer to the other things always, after the first week.

In a subsequent note to Mr. Murray, Lord Byron says,--"I do not think less highly of 'Buonaparte'
for knowing the author. I was aware that he was a man of talent, but did not suspect him of
possessing all the family talents in such perfection."]

       *       *       *       *       *

A resolution was, about this time, adopted by him, which, however strange and precipitate it
appeared, a knowledge of the previous state of his mind may enable us to account for satisfactorily.
He had now, for two years, been drawing upon the admiration of the public with a rapidity and
success which seemed to defy exhaustion,--having crowded, indeed, into that brief interval
the materials of a long life of fame. But admiration is a sort of impost from which most minds
are but too willing to relieve themselves. The eye grows weary of looking up to the same object
of wonder, and begins to exchange, at last, the delight of observing its elevation for the
less generous pleasure of watching and speculating on its fall. The reputation of Lord Byron
had already begun to experience some of these consequences of its own prolonged and constantly
renewed splendour. Even among that host of admirers who would have been the last to find fault,
there were some not unwilling to repose from praise; while they, who had been from the first
reluctant eulogists, took advantage of these apparent symptoms of satiety to indulge in blame.[28]

The loud outcry raised, at the beginning of the present year, by his verses to the Princess
Charlotte, had afforded a vent for much of this reserved venom; and the tone of disparagement
in which some of his assailants now affected to speak of his poetry was, however absurd and
contemptible in itself, precisely that sort of attack which was the most calculated to wound
his, at once, proud and diffident spirit. As long as they confined themselves to blackening
his moral and social character, so far from offending, their libels rather fell in with his
own shadowy style of self-portraiture, and gratified the strange inverted ambition that possessed
him. But the slighting opinion which they ventured to express of his genius,--seconded as it
was by that inward dissatisfaction with his own powers, which they whose standard of excellence
is highest are always the surest to feel,--mortified and disturbed him; and, being the first
sounds of ill augury that had come across his triumphal career, startled him, as we have seen,
into serious doubts of its continuance.

Had he been occupying himself, at the time, with any new task, that confidence in his own energies,
which he never truly felt but while in the actual exercise of them, would have enabled him
to forget these humiliations of the moment in the glow and excitement of anticipated success.
But he had just pledged himself to the world to take a long farewell of poesy,--had sealed
up that only fountain from which his heart ever drew refreshment or strength,--and thus was
left, idly and helplessly, to brood over the daily taunts of his enemies, without the power
of avenging himself when they insulted his person, and but too much disposed to agree with
them when they made light of his genius. "I am afraid, (he says, in noticing these attacks
in one of his letters,) what you call trash is plaguily to the purpose, and very good sense
into the bargain; and, to tell the truth, for some little time past, I have been myself much
of the same opinion."

In this sensitive state of mind,--which he but ill disguised or relieved by an exterior of
gay defiance or philosophic contempt,--we can hardly feel surprised that he should have, all
at once, come to the resolution, not only of persevering in his determination to write no more
in future, but of purchasing back the whole of his past copyrights, and suppressing every page
and line he had ever written. On his first mention of this design, Mr. Murray naturally doubted
as to its seriousness; but the arrival of the following letter, enclosing a draft for the amount
of the copyrights, put his intentions beyond question.

[Footnote 28: It was the fear of this sort of back-water current to which so rapid a flow of
fame seemed liable, that led some even of his warmest admirers, ignorant as they were yet of
the boundlessness of his resources, to tremble a little at the frequency of his appearances
before the public. In one of my own letters to him, I find this apprehension thus expressed:--"If
you did not write so well,--as the Royal wit observed,--I should say you write too much; at
least, too much in the same strain. The Pythagoreans, you know, were of opinion that the reason
why we do not hear or heed the music of the heavenly bodies is that they are always sounding
in our ears; and I fear that even the influence of your song may be diminished by falling upon
the world's dull ear too constantly."

The opinion, however, which a great writer of our day (himself one of the few to whom his remark
replies) had the generosity, as well as sagacity, to pronounce on this point, at a time when
Lord Byron was indulging in the fullest lavishment of his powers, must be regarded, after all,
as the most judicious and wise:--"But they cater ill for the public," says Sir Walter Scott,
"and give indifferent advice to the poet, supposing him possessed of the highest qualities
of his art, who do not advise him to labour while the laurel around his brows yet retains its
freshness. Sketches from Lord Byron are more valuable than finished pictures from others; nor
are we at all sure that any labour which he might bestow in revisal would not rather efface
than refine those outlines of striking and powerful originality which they exhibit when flung
rough from the hand of a master."--Biographical Memoirs, by SIR W. SCOTT.]

     "2. Albany, April 29. 1814.

     "Dear Sir,

     "I enclose a draft for the money; when paid, send the copyright. I
     release you from the thousand pounds agreed on for The Giaour and
     Bride, and there's an end.

     "If any accident occurs to me, you may do then as you please; but,
     with the exception of two copies of each for yourself only, I
     expect and request that the advertisements be withdrawn, and the
     remaining copies of all destroyed; and any expense so incurred I
     will be glad to defray.

     "For all this, it might be as well to assign some reason. I have
     none to give, except my own caprice, and I do not consider the
     circumstances of consequence enough to require explanation.

     "In course, I need hardly assure you that they never shall be
     published with my consent, directly, or indirectly, by any other
     person whatsoever,--that I am perfectly satisfied, and have every
     reason so to be, with your conduct in all transactions between us
     as publisher and author.

     "It will give me great pleasure to preserve your acquaintance, and
     to consider you as my friend. Believe me very truly, and for much
     attention,

     "Your obliged and very obedient servant,

     "BYRON.

     "P.S. I do not think that I have overdrawn at Hammersley's; but if
     that be the case, I can draw for the superflux on Hoare's. The
     draft is 5l. short, but that I will make up. On payment--not
     before--return the copyright papers."

In such a conjuncture, an appeal to his good nature and considerateness was, as Mr. Murray
well judged, his best resource; and the following prompt reply, will show how easily, and at
once, it succeeded.

LETTER 181. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "May 1. 1814.

     "Dear Sir,

     "If your present note is serious, and it really would be
     inconvenient, there is an end of the matter; tear my draft, and go
     on as usual: in that case, we will recur to our former basis. That
     I was perfectly serious, in wishing to suppress all future
     publication, is true; but certainly not to interfere with the
     convenience of others, and more particularly your own. Some day, I
     will tell you the reason of this apparently strange resolution. At
     present, it may be enough to say that I recall it at your
     suggestion; and as it appears to have annoyed you, I lose no time
     in saying so.

     "Yours truly,

     "B."

       *       *       *       *       *

During my stay in town this year, we were almost daily together; and it is in no spirit of
flattery to the dead I say, that the more intimately I became acquainted with his disposition
and character, the more warmly I felt disposed to take an interest in every thing that concerned
him. Not that, in the opportunities thus afforded me of observing more closely his defects,
I did not discover much to lament, and not a little to condemn. But there was still, in the
neighbourhood of even his worst faults, some atoning good quality, which was always sure, if
brought kindly and with management into play, to neutralise their ill effects. The very frankness,
indeed, with which he avowed his errors seemed to imply a confidence in his own power of redeeming
them,--a consciousness that he could afford to be sincere. There was also, in such entire unreserve,
a pledge that nothing worse remained behind; and the same quality that laid open the blemishes
of his nature gave security for its honesty. "The cleanness and purity of one's mind," says
Pope, "is never better proved than in discovering its own faults, at first view; as when a
stream shows the dirt at its bottom, it shows also the transparency of the water."

The theatre was, at this time, his favourite place of resort. We have seen how enthusiastically
he expresses himself on the subject of Mr. Kean's acting, and it was frequently my good fortune,
during this season, to share in his enjoyment of it,--the orchestra being, more than once,
the place where, for a nearer view of the actor's countenance, we took our station. For Kean's
benefit, on the 25th of May, a large party had been made by Lady J * *, to which we both belonged;
but Lord Byron having also taken a box for the occasion, so anxious was he to enjoy the representation
uninterrupted, that, by rather an unsocial arrangement, only himself and I occupied his box
during the play, while every other in the house was crowded almost to suffocation; nor did
we join the remainder of our friends till supper. Between the two parties, however, Mr. Kean
had no reason to complain of a want of homage to his talents; as Lord J * *, on that occasion,
presented him with a hundred pound share in the theatre; while Lord Byron sent him, next day,
the sum of fifty guineas[29]; and, not long after, on seeing him act some of his favourite
parts, made him presents of a handsome snuff-box and a costly Turkish sword.

Such effect had the passionate energy of Kean's acting on his mind, that, once, in seeing him
play Sir Giles Overreach, he was so affected as to be seized with a sort of convulsive fit;
and we shall find him, some years after, in Italy, when the representation of Alfieri's tragedy
of Mirra had agitated him in the same violent manner, comparing the two instances as the only
ones in his life when "any thing under reality" had been able to move him so powerfully.

The following are a few of the notes which I received from him during this visit to town.

[Footnote 29: To such lengths did he, at this time, carry his enthusiasm for Kean, that when
Miss O'Neil soon after appeared, and, by her matchless representation of feminine tenderness,
attracted all eyes and hearts, he was not only a little jealous of her reputation, as interfering
with that of his favourite, but, in order to guard himself against the risk of becoming a convert,
refused to go to see her act. I endeavoured sometimes to persuade him into witnessing, at least,
one of her performances; but his answer was, (punning upon Shakspeare's word, "unanealed,")
"No--I'm resolved to continue un-Oneiled."

To the great queen of all actresses, however, it will be seen, by the following extract from
one of his journals, he rendered due justice:--

"Of actors, Cooke was the most natural, Kemble the most supernatural,--Kean the medium between
the two. But Mrs. Siddons was worth them all put together."--Detached Thoughts.]

     "Last night we supp'd at R----fe's board, &c.[30]

     "I wish people would not shirk their dinners--ought it not to
     have been a dinner?[31]--and that d----d anchovy sandwich!

     "That plaguy voice of yours made me sentimental, and almost fall in
     love with a girl who was recommending herself, during your song, by
     hating music. But the song is past, and my passion can wait, till
     the pucelle is more harmonious.

     "Do you go to Lady Jersey's to-night? It is a large party, and you
     won't be bored into 'softening rocks,' and all that. Othello is
     to-morrow and Saturday too. Which day shall we go? when shall I see
     you? If you call, let it be after three, and as near four as you
     please.

it better to omit.]

[Footnote 31: We had been invited by Lord R. to dine after the play,--an arrangement which,
from its novelty, delighted Lord Byron exceedingly. The dinner, however, afterwards dwindled
into a mere supper, and this change was long a subject of jocular resentment with him.]

     "Dear Tom,

     "Thou hast asked me for a song, and I enclose you an experiment,
     which has cost me something more than trouble, and is, therefore,
     less likely to be worth your taking any in your proposed
     setting.[32] Now, if it be so, throw it into the fire without
     phrase.

     "BYRON.

        "I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name,
        There is grief in the sound, there is guilt in the fame;
        But the tear which now burns on my cheek may impart
        The deep thoughts that dwell in that silence of heart.

        "Too brief for our passion, too long for our peace
        Were those hours--can their joy or their bitterness cease?
        We repent--we abjure--we will break from our chain--
        We will part,--we will fly to--unite it again!

        "Oh! thine be the gladness, and mine be the guilt!
        Forgive me, adored one!--forsake, if thou wilt;--
        But the heart which is thine shall expire undebased,
        And man shall not break it--whatever thou mayst.

        "And stern to the haughty, but humble to thee,
        This soul, in its bitterest blackness, shall be;
        And our days seem as swift, and our moments more sweet,
        With thee by my side, than with worlds at our feet.

        "One sigh of thy sorrow, one look of thy love,
        Shall turn me or fix, shall reward or reprove;
        And the heartless may wonder at all I resign--
        Thy lip shall reply, not to them, but to mine."

The supper, to which he here looks forward, took place at Watier's, of which club he had lately
become a member; and, as it may convey some idea of his irregular mode of diet, and thus account,
in part, for the frequent derangement of his health, I shall here attempt, from recollection,
a description of his supper on this occasion. We were to have been joined by Lord R * *, who
however did not arrive, and the party accordingly consisted but of ourselves. Having taken
upon me to order the repast, and knowing that Lord Byron, for the last two days, had done nothing
towards sustenance, beyond eating a few biscuits and (to appease appetite) chewing mastic,
I desired that we should have a good supply of, at least, two kinds of fish. My companion,
however, confined himself to lobsters, and of these finished two or three, to his own share,--interposing,
sometimes, a small liqueur-glass of strong white brandy, sometimes a tumbler of very hot water,
and then pure brandy again, to the amount of near half a dozen small glasses of the latter,
without which, alternately with the hot water, he appeared to think the lobster could not be
digested. After this, we had claret, of which having despatched two bottles between us, at
about four o'clock in the morning we parted.

As Pope has thought his "delicious lobster-nights" worth commemorating, these particulars of
one in which Lord Byron was concerned may also have some interest.

Among other nights of the same description which I had the happiness of passing with him, I
remember once, in returning home from some assembly at rather a late hour, we saw lights in
the windows of his old haunt Stevens's, in Bond Street, and agreed to stop there and sup. On
entering, we found an old friend of his, Sir G * * W* *, who joined our party, and the lobsters
and brandy and water being put in requisition, it was (as usual on such occasions) broad daylight
before we separated.

LETTER 182. TO MR. MOORE.

     "May 23. 1814.

     "I must send you the Java government gazette of July 3d, 1813, just
     sent to me by Murray. Only think of our (for it is you and I)
     setting paper warriors in array in the Indian seas. Does not this
     sound like fame--something almost like posterity? It is something
     to have scribblers squabbling about us 5000 miles off, while we are
     agreeing so well at home. Bring it with you in your pocket;--it
     will make you laugh, as it hath me. Ever yours,

     "B.

     "P.S. Oh the anecdote!"

       *       *       *       *       *

To the circumstance mentioned in this letter he recurs more than once in the Journals which
he kept abroad; as thus, in a passage of his "Detached Thoughts,"--where it will be perceived
that, by a trifling lapse of memory, he represents himself as having produced this gazette,
for the first time, on our way to dinner.

"In the year 1814, as Moore and I were going to dine with Lord Grey in Portman Square, I pulled
out a 'Java Gazette' (which Murray had sent to me), in which there was a controversy on our
respective merits as poets. It was amusing enough that we should be proceeding peaceably to
the same table while they were squabbling about us in the Indian seas (to be sure the paper
was dated six months before), and filling columns with Batavian criticism. But this is fame,
I presume."

The following poem, written about this time, and, apparently, for the purpose of being recited
at the Caledonian Meeting, I insert principally on account of the warm feeling which it breathes
towards Scotland and her sons:--

    "Who hath not glow'd above the page where Fame
    Hath fix'd high Caledon's unconquer'd name;
    The mountain-land which spurn'd the Roman chain,
    And baffled back the fiery-crested Dane,
    Whose bright claymore and hardihood of hand
    No foe could tame--no tyrant could command.

    "That race is gone--but still their children breathe,
    And glory crowns them with redoubled wreath:
    O'er Gael and Saxon mingling banners shine,
    And, England! add their stubborn strength to thine.
    The blood which flow'd with Wallace flows as free,
    But now 'tis only shed for fame and thee!
    Oh! pass not by the Northern veteran's claim,
    But give support--the world hath given him fame!

    "The humbler ranks, the lowly brave, who bled
    While cheerly following where the mighty led--
    Who sleep beneath the undistinguish'd sod
    Where happier comrades in their triumph trod,
    To us bequeath--'tis all their fate allows--
    The sireless offspring and the lonely spouse:
    She on high Albyn's dusky hills may raise
    The tearful eye in melancholy gaze,
    Or view, while shadowy auguries disclose
    The Highland seer's anticipated woes,
    The bleeding phantom of each martial form
    Dim in the cloud, or darkling in the storm;
    While sad, she chants the solitary song,
    The soft lament for him who tarries long--
    For him, whose distant relics vainly crave
    The coronach's wild requiem to the brave!

    "'Tis Heaven--not man--must charm away the woe
    Which bursts when Nature's feelings newly flow;
    Yet tenderness and time may rob the tear
    Of half its bitterness for one so dear:
    A nation's gratitude perchance may spread
    A thornless pillow for the widow'd head;
    May lighten well her heart's maternal care,
    And wean from penury the soldier's heir."

     'life's stream.'

pleasantries upon every thing and every one around him, of which the following are the only
parts producible:--

    Walk'd out of his depth and was lost in a calm sea,
    Singing 'Glory to God' in a spick-and-span stanza,
    The like (since Tom Sternhold was choked) never man saw.

     "Your non-attendance at Corinne's is very à propos, as I was on
     the eve of sending you an excuse. I do not feel well enough to go
     there this evening, and have been obliged to despatch an apology. I
     believe I need not add one for not accepting Mr. Sheridan's
     invitation on Wednesday, which I fancy both you and I understood in
     the same sense:--with him the saying of Mirabeau, that 'words are
     things,' is not to be taken literally.

     "Ever," &c.

     "I will call for you at a quarter before seven, if that will suit
     you. I return you Sir Proteus[37], and shall merely add in return,
     as Johnson said of, and to, somebody or other, 'Are we alive after
     all this censure?'

     "Believe me," &c.

[Footnote 37: A satirical pamphlet, in which all the writers of the day were attacked.]

     "Tuesday.

     "Sheridan was yesterday, at first, too sober to remember your
     invitation, but in the dregs of the third bottle he fished up his
     memory. The Staël out-talked Whitbread, was ironed by Sheridan,
     confounded Sir Humphry, and utterly perplexed your slave. The rest
     (great names in the red book, nevertheless,) were mere segments of
     the circle. Ma'mselle danced a Russ saraband with great vigour,
     grace, and expression.

     only let me know, that I may be saved the trouble of copying the
     rest, and put the first part into the fire. I really have no
     anxiety about it, and shall not be sorry to be saved the copying,

     "You could not have made me a more acceptable present than
     Jacqueline,--she is all grace, and softness, and poetry; there is
     so much of the last, that we do not feel the want of story, which
     is simple, yet enough. I wonder that you do not oftener unbend to
     more of the same kind. I have some sympathy with the softer
     affections, though very little in my way, and no one can depict
     them so truly and successfully as yourself. I have half a mind to
     pay you in kind, or rather unkind, for I have just 'supped full
     of horror' in two cantos of darkness and dismay.

     "Do you go to Lord Essex's to-night? if so, will you let me call
     for you at your own hour? I dined with Holland-house yesterday at
     Lord Cowper's; my Lady very gracious, which she can be more than
     any one when she likes. I was not sorry to see them again, for I
     can't forget that they have been very kind to me. Ever yours most
     truly,

     "BN.

     "P.S. Is there any chance or possibility of making it up with Lord
     Carlisle, as I feel disposed to do any thing reasonable or
     unreasonable to effect it? I would before, but for the 'Courier,'
     and the possible misconstructions at such a time. Perpend,

On my return to London, for a short time, at the beginning of July, I found his poem of 'Lara,'
which he had begun at the latter end of May, in the hands of the printer, and nearly ready
for publication. He had, before I left town, repeated to me, as we were on our way to some
evening party, the first one hundred and twenty lines of the poem, which he had written the
day before,--at the same time giving me a general sketch of the characters and the story.

His short notes to Mr. Murray, during the printing of this work, are of the same impatient
and whimsical character as those, of which I have already given specimens, in my account of
his preceding publications: but, as matter of more interest now presses upon us, I shall forbear
from transcribing them at length. In one of them he says, "I have just corrected some of the
most horrible blunders that ever crept into a proof:"--in another, "I hope the next proof will
be better; this was one which would have consoled Job, if it had been of his 'enemy's book:'"
--a third contains only the following words: "Dear sir, you demanded more battle--there it is.

"Yours," &c.

The two letters that immediately follow were addressed to me, at this time, in town.

LETTER 187. TO MR. MOORE.

     "July 8. 1814.

     "I returned to town last night, and had some hopes of seeing you
     to-day, and would have called,--but I have been (though in
     exceeding distempered good health) a little head-achy with free
     living, as it is called, and am now at the freezing point of
     returning soberness. Of course, I should be sorry that our parallel
     lines did not deviate into intersection before you return to the
     country,--after that same nonsuit[38], whereof the papers have
     told us,--but, as you must be much occupied, I won't be affronted,
     should your time and business militate against our meeting.

     "Rogers and I have almost coalesced into a joint invasion of the
     public. Whether it will take place or not, I do not yet know, and I
     am afraid Jacqueline (which is very beautiful) will be in bad
     company.[39] But in this case, the lady will not be the sufferer.

     nothing,--that is, no good,--and am very truly," &c.

musical works), to the trial of which I had been summoned as a witness.]

     "This day have I received information from my man of law of the
     non--and never likely to be--performance of purchase by Mr.
     Claughton, of impecuniary memory. He don't know what to do, or when
     to pay; and so all my hopes and worldly projects and prospects are
     gone to the devil. He (the purchaser, and the devil too, for aught
     I care,) and I, and my legal advisers, are to meet to-morrow, the
     said purchaser having first taken special care to enquire 'whether
     I would meet him with temper?'--Certainly. The question is this--I
     shall either have the estate back, which is as good as ruin, or I
     shall go on with him dawdling, which is rather worse. I have
     brought my pigs to a Mussulman market. If I had but a wife now, and
     children, of whose paternity I entertained doubts, I should be
     happy, or rather fortunate, as Candide or Scarmentado. In the mean
     time, if you don't come and see me, I shall think that Sam.'s bank

     those who have seen it, who are pretty conversant with the
     original, as well as the picture from whence it is taken. I rather
     suspect that it is from the copy and not the exhibited
     portrait, and in this dilemma would recommend a suspension, if not
     an abandonment, of the prefixion to the volumes which you purpose
     inflicting upon the public.

     "With regard to Lara, don't be in any hurry. I have not yet made
     up my mind on the subject, nor know what to think or do till I hear
     from you; and Mr. Moore appeared to me in a similar state of
     indetermination. I do not know that it may not be better to
     reserve it for the entire publication you proposed, and not
     adventure in hardy singleness, or even backed by the fairy

     such a subject: and P * * must be a dunce to agree with them. For
     my own part, I have no objection at all; but Mrs. Leigh and my
     cousin must be better judges of the likeness than others; and they
     hate it; and so I won't have it at all.

     "Mr. Hobhouse is right as for his conclusion: but I deny the
     premises. The name only is Spanish[43]; the country is not Spain,
     but the Morea.

     "Waverley is the best and most interesting novel I have redde
     since--I don't know when. I like it as much as I hate * *, and * *,
     and * *, and all the feminine trash of the last four months.
     Besides, it is all easy to me, I have been in Scotland so much
     (though then young enough too), and feel at home with the people,
     Lowland and Gael.

     feudal system in Spain);--it is not Spain. If he puts a few words
     of prose any where, it will set all right.

LETTER 191. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "August 3. 1814.

     "It is certainly a little extraordinary that you have not sent the
     Edinburgh Review, as I requested, and hoped it would not require a
     note a day to remind you. I see advertisements of Lara and
     Jacqueline; pray, why? when I requested you to postpone
     publication till my return to town.

     "I have a most amusing epistle from the Ettrick bard--Hogg; in
     which, speaking of his bookseller, whom he denominates the
     'shabbiest' of the trade for not 'lifting his bills,' he adds, in
     so many words, 'G----d d----n him and them both.' This is a pretty
     prelude to asking you to adopt him (the said Hogg); but this he
     wishes; and if you please, you and I will talk it over. He has a
     poem ready for the press (and your bills too, if 'liftable'),
     and bestows some benedictions on Mr. Moore for his abduction of
     Lara from the forthcoming Miscellany.[44]

     "P.S. Sincerely, I think Mr. Hogg would suit you very well; and
     surely he is a man of great powers, and deserving of encouragement.
     I must knock out a Tale for him, and you should at all events
     consider before you reject his suit. Scott is gone to the Orkneys
     in a gale of wind; and Hogg says that, during the said gale, 'he
     is sure that Scott is not quite at his ease, to say the best of
     it.' Ah! I wish these home-keeping bards could taste a
     Mediterranean white squall, or 'the Gut' in a gale of wind, or even
     the 'Bay of Biscay' with no wind at all."

[Footnote 44: Mr. Hogg had been led to hope that he should be permitted to insert this poem
in a Miscellany which he had at this time some thoughts of publishing; and whatever advice
I may have given against such a mode of disposing of the work arose certainly not from any
ill will to this ingenious and remarkable man, but from a consideration of what I thought most
advantageous to the fame of Lord Byron.]

LETTER 192. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Hastings, August 3. 1814.

     "By the time this reaches your dwelling, I shall (God wot) be in
     town again probably. I have been here renewing my acquaintance with
     my old friend Ocean; and I find his bosom as pleasant a pillow for
     an hour in the morning as his daughters of Paphos could be in the
     twilight. I have been swimming and eating turbot, and smuggling
     neat brandies and silk handkerchiefs,--and listening to my friend
     Hodgson's raptures about a pretty wife-elect of his,--and walking
     on cliffs, and tumbling down hills, and making the most of the
     'dolce far-niente' for the last fortnight. I met a son of Lord
     Erskine's, who says he has been married a year, and is the
     'happiest of men;' and I have met the aforesaid H., who is also the
     'happiest of men;' so, it is worth while being here, if only to
     witness the superlative felicity of these foxes, who have cut off
     their tails, and would persuade the rest to part with their brushes
     to keep them in countenance.

     "It rejoiceth me that you like 'Lara.' Jeffrey is out with his 45th
     Number, which I suppose you have got. He is only too kind to me, in
     my share of it, and I begin to fancy myself a golden pheasant, upon
     the strength of the plumage wherewith he hath bedecked me. But
     then, 'surgit amari,' &c.--the gentlemen of the Champion, and
     Perry, have got hold (I know not how) of the condolatory address to
     Lady J. on the picture-abduction by our R * * *, and have published
     them--with my name, too, smack--without even asking leave, or
     enquiring whether or no! D----n their impudence, and d----n every
     thing. It has put me out of patience, and so, I shall say no more
     about it.

     "You shall have Lara and Jacque (both with some additions) when
     out; but I am still demurring and delaying, and in a fuss, and so
     is R. in his way.

     "Newstead is to be mine again. Claughton forfeits twenty-five
     thousand pounds; but that don't prevent me from being very prettily
     ruined. I mean to bury myself there--and let my beard grow--and
     hate you all.

     "Oh! I have had the most amusing letter from Hogg, the Ettrick
     minstrel and shepherd. He wants me to recommend him to Murray; and,
     speaking of his present bookseller, whose 'bills' are never
     'lifted,' he adds, totidem verbis, 'God d----n him and them
     both.' I laughed, and so would you too, at the way in which this
     execration is introduced. The said Hogg is a strange being, but of
     great, though uncouth, powers. I think very highly of him, as a
     poet; but he, and half of these Scotch and Lake troubadours, are
     spoilt by living in little circles and petty societies. London and
     the world is the only place to take the conceit out of a man--in
     the milling phrase. Scott, he says, is gone to the Orkneys in a
     gale of wind;--during which wind, he affirms, the said Scott, 'he
     is sure, is not at his ease,--to say the best of it.' Lord, Lord,
     if these homekeeping minstrels had crossed your Atlantic or my
     Mediterranean, and tasted a little open boating in a white
     squall--or a gale in 'the Gut'--or the 'Bay of Biscay,' with no
     gale at all--how it would enliven and introduce them to a few of
     the sensations!--to say nothing of an illicit amour or two upon
     shore, in the way of essay upon the Passions, beginning with simple
     adultery, and compounding it as they went along.

     "I have forwarded your letter to Murray,--by the way, you had
     addressed it to Miller. Pray write to me, and say what art thou
     doing? 'Not finished!'--Oons! how is this?--these 'flaws and
     starts' must be 'authorised by your grandam,' and are unbecoming of
     any other author. I was sorry to hear of your discrepancy with the
     * *s, or rather your abjuration of agreement. I don't want to be
     impertinent, or buffoon on a serious subject, and am therefore at a
     loss what to say.

     "I hope nothing will induce you to abate from the proper price of
     your poem, as long as there is a prospect of getting it. For my own
     part, I have seriously and not whiningly, (for that is not my
     way--at least, it used not to be,) neither hopes, nor prospects,
     and scarcely even wishes. I am, in some respects, happy, but not in
     a manner that can or ought to last,--but enough of that. The worst
     of it is, I feel quite enervated and indifferent. I really do not
     know, if Jupiter were to offer me my choice of the contents of his
     benevolent cask, what I would pick out of it. If I was born, as the
     nurses say, with a 'silver spoon in my mouth,' it has stuck in my
     throat, and spoiled my palate, so that nothing put into it is
     swallowed with much relish,--unless it be cayenne. However, I have
     grievances enough to occupy me that way too;--but for fear of
     adding to yours by this pestilent long diatribe, I postpone the
     reading of them, sine die.

     "Ever, dear M., yours, &c.

     "P.S. Don't forget my godson. You could not have fixed on a fitter
     porter for his sins than me, being used to carry double without
     inconvenience."

     journey to Scotland, I am sorry that you carried your complaisance

     not yet decided. Claughton is to make a grand effort by Saturday
     week to complete,--if not, he must give up twenty-five thousand
     pounds and the estate, with expenses, &c. &c. If I resume the
     Abbacy, you shall have due notice, and a cell set apart for your
     reception, with a pious welcome. Rogers I have not seen, but Larry
     and Jacky came out a few days ago. Of their effect I know nothing.

     "There is something very amusing in your being an Edinburgh
     Reviewer. You know, I suppose, that T * * is none of the placidest,
     and may possibly enact some tragedy on being told that he is only a
     fool. If, now, Jeffery were to be slain on account of an article of
     yours, there would be a fine conclusion. For my part, as Mrs.
     Winifred Jenkins says, 'he has done the handsome thing by me,'
     particularly in his last number; so, he is the best of men and the
     ablest of critics, and I won't have him killed,--though I dare say
     many wish he were, for being so good-humoured.

     "Before I left Hastings I got in a passion with an ink bottle,
     which I flung out of the window one night with a vengeance;--and
     what then? Why, next morning I was horrified by seeing that it had
     struck, and split upon, the petticoat of Euterpe's graven image in
     the garden, and grimed her as if it were on purpose[45]. Only think
     of my distress,--and the epigrams that might be engendered on the
     Muse and her misadventure.

     "I had an adventure almost as ridiculous, at some private
     theatricals near Cambridge--though of a different
     description--since I saw you last. I quarrelled with a man in the
     dark for asking me who I was (insolently enough to be sure), and
     followed him into the green-room (a stable) in a rage, amongst a
     set of people I never saw before. He turned out to be a low
     comedian, engaged to act with the amateurs, and to be a
     civil-spoken man enough, when he found out that nothing very
     pleasant was to be got by rudeness. But you would have been amused
     with the row, and the dialogue, and the dress--or rather the
     undress--of the party, where I had introduced myself in a devil of
     a hurry, and the astonishment that ensued. I had gone out of the
     theatre, for coolness, into the garden;--there I had tumbled over
     some dogs, and, coming away from them in very ill humour,
     encountered the man in a worse, which produced all this confusion.

     who has just spawned a quarto of metaphysical blank verse, which is

LETTER 196. TO MR. MOORE.

     "August 13. 1814.

     "I wrote yesterday to Mayfield, and have just now enfranked your
     letter to mamma. My stay in town is so uncertain (not later than
     next week) that your packets for the north may not reach me; and as
     I know not exactly where I am going--however, Newstead is my most
     probable destination, and if you send your despatches before
     Tuesday, I can forward them to our new ally. But, after that day,
     you had better not trust to their arrival in time.

     "* * has been exiled from Paris, on dit, for saying the Bourbons
     were old women. The Bourbons might have been content, I think, with
     returning the compliment.

     "I told you all about Jacky and Larry yesterday;--they are to be
     separated,--at least, so says the grand M., and I know no more of
     the matter. Jeffrey has done me more than 'justice;' but as to
     tragedy--um!--I have no time for fiction at present. A man cannot
     paint a storm with the vessel under bare poles on a lee-shore. When
     I get to land, I will try what is to be done, and, if I founder,
     there be plenty of mine elders and betters to console Melpomene.

     "When at Newstead, you must come over, if only for a day--should
     Mrs. M. be exigeante of your presence. The place is worth seeing,
     as a ruin, and I can assure you there was some fun there, even
     in my time; but that is past. The ghosts [46], however, and the
     gothics, and the waters, and the desolation, make it very lively
     still.

     "Ever, dear Tom, yours," &c.

[Footnote 46: It was, if I mistake not, during his recent visit to Newstead, that he himself
actually fancied he saw the ghost of the Black Friar, which was supposed to have haunted the
Abbey from the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, and which he thus describes, from
the recollection perhaps of his own fantasy, in Don Juan:--

    "It was no mouse, but, lo! a monk, array'd
      In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,
    Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,
      With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard:
    His garments only a slight murmur made:
      He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
    But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,
      Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye."

It is said, that the Newstead ghost appeared, also, to Lord Byron's cousin, Miss Fanny Parkins,
and that she made a sketch of him from memory.]

LETTER 197. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Newstead Abbey, Septembers. 1814.

     "I am obliged by what you have sent, but would rather not see any
     thing of the kind[47]; we have had enough of these things already,
     good and bad, and next month you need not trouble yourself to
     collect even the higher generation--on my account. It gives me
     much pleasure to hear of Mr. Hobhouse's and Mr. Merivale's good
     entreatment by the journals you mention.

     "I still think Mr. Hogg and yourself might make out an alliance.
     Dodsley's was, I believe, the last decent thing of the kind, and
     his had great success in its day, and lasted several years; but
     then he had the double advantage of editing and publishing. The
     Spleen, and several of Gray's odes, much of Shenstone, and many
     others of good repute, made their first appearance in his
     collection. Now, with the support of Scott, Wordsworth, Southey,
     &c., I see little reason why you should not do as well; and, if
     once fairly established, you would have assistance from the
     youngsters, I dare say. Stratford Canning (whose 'Buonaparte' is
     excellent), and many others, and Moore, and Hobhouse, and I, would
     try a fall now and then (if permitted), and you might coax
     Campbell, too, into it. By the by, he has an unpublished (though
     printed) poem on a scene in Germany, (Bavaria, I think,) which I
     saw last year, that is perfectly magnificent, and equal to himself.
     I wonder he don't publish it.

     "Oh!--do you recollect S * *, the engraver's, mad letter about not
     engraving Phillips's picture of Lord Foley? (as he blundered it;)
     well, I have traced it, I think. It seems, by the papers, a
     preacher of Johanna Southcote's is named Foley; and I can no way
     account for the said S * *'s confusion of words and ideas, but by
     that of his head's running on Johanna and her apostles. It was a
     mercy he did not say Lord Tozer. You know, of course, that S * *
     is a believer in this new (old) virgin of spiritual impregnation.

     "I long to know what she will produce[48]; her being with child at
     sixty-five is indeed a miracle, but her getting any one to beget
     it, a greater.

     "If you were not going to Paris or Scotland, I could send you some
     game: if you remain, let me know.

     "P.S. A word or two of 'Lara,' which your enclosure brings before
     me. It is of no great promise separately; but, as connected with
     the other tales, it will do very well for the volumes you mean to
     publish. I would recommend this arrangement--Childe Harold, the
     smaller Poems, Giaour, Bride, Corsair, Lara; the last completes the
     series, and its very likeness renders it necessary to the others.
     Cawthorne writes that they are publishing English Bards in
     Ireland: pray enquire into this; because it must be stopped."

[Footnote 47: The reviews and magazines of the month.]

[Footnote 48: The following characteristic note, in reference to this passage, appears, in
Mr. Gifford's hand-writing, on the copy of the above letter:--"It is a pity that Lord B. was
ignorant of Jonson. The old poet has a Satire on the Court Pucelle that would have supplied
him with some pleasantry on Johanna's pregnancy."]

LETTER 198. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Newstead Abbey, September 7. 1814.

     "I should think Mr. Hogg, for his own sake as well as yours, would
     be 'critical' as Iago himself in his editorial capacity; and that
     such a publication would answer his purpose, and yours too, with
     tolerable management. You should, however, have a good number to
     start with--I mean, good in quality; in these days, there can be
     little fear of not coming up to the mark in quantity. There must be
     many 'fine things' in Wordsworth; but I should think it difficult
     to make six quartos (the amount of the whole) all fine,
     particularly the pedler's portion of the poem; but there can be no
     doubt of his powers to do almost any thing.

     "I am 'very idle.' I have read the few books I had with me, and
     been forced to fish, for lack of argument. I have caught a great
     many perch and some carp, which is a comfort, as one would not lose
     one's labour willingly.

     "Pray, who corrects the press of your volumes? I hope 'The Corsair'
     is printed from the copy I corrected, with the additional lines in
     the first Canto, and some notes from Sismondi and Lavater, which
     I gave you to add thereto. The arrangement is very well.

     "My cursed people have not sent my papers since Sunday, and I have
     lost Johanna's divorce from Jupiter. Who hath gotten her with
     prophet? Is it Sharpe, and how? * * * I should like to buy one of
     her seals: if salvation can be had at half-a-guinea a head, the
     landlord of the Crown and Anchor should be ashamed of himself for
     charging double for tickets to a mere terrestrial banquet. I am
     afraid, seriously, that these matters will lend a sad handle to
     your profane scoffers, and give a loose to much damnable laughter.

LETTER 199. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Newstead Abbey, September 15. 1814.

     "This is the fourth letter I have begun to you within the month.
     Whether I shall finish or not, or burn it like the rest, I know
     not. When we meet, I will explain why I have not written--why I
     have not asked you here, as I wished--with a great many other
     whys and wherefores, which will keep cold. In short, you must
     excuse all my seeming omissions and commissions, and grant me more
     remission than St. Athanasius will to yourself, if you lop off a
     single shred of mystery from his pious puzzle. It is my creed (and
     it may be St. Athanasius's too) that your article on T * * will get
     somebody killed, and that, on the Saints, get him d----d
     afterwards, which will be quite enow for one number. Oons, Tom! you
     must not meddle just now with the incomprehensible; for if Johanna
     Southcote turns out to be * * *

     "Now for a little egotism. My affairs stand thus. To-morrow, I
     shall know whether a circumstance of importance enough to change
     many of my plans will occur or not. If it does not, I am off for
     Italy next month, and London, in the mean time, next week. I have
     got back Newstead and twenty-five thousand pounds (out of
     twenty-eight paid already),--as a 'sacrifice,' the late purchaser
     calls it, and he may choose his own name. All this, however, depends
     upon an event, which may, or may not, happen. Whether it will, I
     shall know probably to-morrow, and, if it does, I can't well go
     abroad at present.

     "Pray pardon this parenthetical scrawl. You shall hear from me
     again soon;--I don't call this an answer. Ever most
     affectionately," &c.

     The "circumstance of importance," to which he alludes in this
     letter, was his second proposal for Miss Milbanke, of which he was
     now waiting the result. His own account, in his Memoranda, of the
     circumstances that led to this step is, in substance, as far as I
     can trust my recollection, as follows. A person, who had for some
     time stood high in his affection and confidence, observing how
     cheerless and unsettled was the state both of his mind and
     prospects, advised him strenuously to marry; and, after much
     discussion, he consented. The next point for consideration was--who
     was to be the object of his choice; and while his friend mentioned
     one lady, he himself named Miss Milbanke. To this, however, his
     adviser strongly objected,--remarking to him, that Miss Milbanke
     had at present no fortune, and that his embarrassed affairs would
     not allow him to marry without one; that she was, moreover, a
     learned lady, which would not at all suit him. In consequence of
     these representations, he agreed that his friend should write a
     proposal for him to the other lady named, which was accordingly
     done;--and an answer, containing a refusal, arrived as they were,
     one morning, sitting together. "You see," said Lord Byron, "that,
     after all, Miss Milbanke is to be the person;--I will write to
     her." He accordingly wrote on the moment, and, as soon as he had
     finished, his friend, remonstrating still strongly against his
     choice, took up the letter,--but, on reading it over, observed,
     "Well, really, this is a very pretty letter;--it is a pity it
     should not go. I never read a prettier one."--"Then it shall go,"
     said Lord Byron; and in so saying, sealed and sent off, on the
     instant, this fiat of his fate.

     "I have written to you one letter to-night, but must send you this
     much more, as I have not franked my number, to say that I rejoice
     in my god-daughter, and will send her a coral and bells, which I
     hope she will accept, the moment I get back to London.

     "My head is at this moment in a state of confusion, from various
     causes, which I can neither describe nor explain--but let that
     pass. My employments have been very rural--fishing, shooting,
     bathing, and boating. Books I have but few here, and those I have
     read ten times over, till sick of them. So, I have taken to
     breaking soda-water bottles with my pistols, and jumping into the
     water, and rowing over it, and firing at the fowls of the air. But
     why should I 'monster my nothings' to you, who are well employed,
     and happily too, I should hope? For my part, I am happy, too, in my
     way--but, as usual, have contrived to get into three or four
     perplexities, which I do not see my way through. But a few days,
     perhaps a day, will determine one of them.

     "You do not say a word to me of your poem. I wish I could see or
     hear it. I neither could, nor would, do it or its author any harm.
     I believe I told you of Larry and Jacquy. A friend of mine was
     reading--at least a friend of his was reading--said Larry and
     Jacquy in a Brighton coach. A passenger took up the book and
     queried as to the author. The proprietor said 'there were
     two'--to which the answer of the unknown was, 'Ay, ay--a joint
     concern, I suppose, summot like Sternhold and Hopkins.'

     "Is not this excellent? I would not have missed the 'vile
     comparison' to have 'scaped being one of the 'Arcades ambo et

        The girl who gave to song
          What gold could never buy.

     --My dear Moore, I am going to be married--that is, I am
     accepted[49], and one usually hopes the rest will follow. My
     mother of the Gracchi (that are to be) you think too
     strait-laced for me, although the paragon of only children, and
     invested with 'golden opinions of all sorts of men,' and full of
     'most blest conditions' as Desdemona herself. Miss Milbanke is the
     lady, and I have her father's invitation to proceed there in my
     elect capacity,--which, however, I cannot do till I have settled
     some business in London and got a blue coat.

     "She is said to be an heiress, but of that I really know nothing
     certainly, and shall not enquire. But I do know, that she has
     talents and excellent qualities; and you will not deny her
     judgment, after having refused six suitors and taken me.

     "Now, if you have any thing to say against this, pray do; my mind's
     made up, positively fixed, determined, and therefore I will listen
     to reason, because now it can do no harm. Things may occur to break
     it off, but I will hope not. In the mean time, I tell you (a
     secret, by the by,--at least, till I know she wishes it to be
     public,) that I have proposed and am accepted. You need not be in a
     hurry to wish me joy, for one mayn't be married for months. I am
     going to town to-morrow; but expect to be here, on my way there,
     within a fortnight.

     "If this had not happened, I should have gone to Italy. In my way
     down, perhaps, you will meet me at Nottingham, and come over with
     me here. I need not say that nothing will give me greater pleasure.
     I must, of course, reform thoroughly; and, seriously, if I can
     contribute to her happiness, I shall secure my own. She is so good
     a person, that--that--in short, I wish I was a better. Ever," &c.

his gardener came in and presented him with his mother's wedding ring, which she had lost many
years before, and which the gardener had just found in digging up the mould under her window.
Almost at the same moment, the letter from Miss Milbanke arrived; and Lord Byron exclaimed,
"If it contains a consent, I will be married with this very ring." It did contain a very flattering
acceptance of his proposal, and a duplicate of the letter had been sent to London, in case
this should have missed him.--Memoranda.]

     "Dear Lady * *,

     "Your recollection and invitation do me great honour; but I am
     going to be 'married, and can't come.' My intended is two hundred
     miles off, and the moment my business here is arranged, I must set
     out in a great hurry to be happy. Miss Milbanke is the good-natured
     person who has undertaken me, and, of course, I am very much in
     love, and as silly as all single gentlemen must be in that
     sentimental situation. I have been accepted these three weeks; but
     when the event will take place, I don't exactly know. It depends
     partly upon lawyers, who are never in a hurry. One can be sure of
     nothing; but, at present, there appears no other interruption to
     this intention, which seems as mutual as possible, and now no
     secret, though I did not tell first,--and all our relatives are
     congratulating away to right and left in the most fatiguing manner.

     "You perhaps know the lady. She is niece to Lady Melbourne, and
     cousin to Lady Cowper and others of your acquaintance, and has no
     fault, except being a great deal too good for me, and that I
     must pardon, if nobody else should. It might have been two years
     ago, and, if it had, would have saved me a world of trouble. She
     has employed the interval in refusing about half a dozen of my
     particular friends, (as she did me once, by the way,) and has taken
     me at last, for which I am very much obliged to her. I wish it was
     well over, for I do hate bustle, and there is no marrying without
     some;--and then, I must not marry in a black coat, they tell me,
     and I can't bear a blue one.

     "Pray forgive me for scribbling all this nonsense. You know I must
     be serious all the rest of my life, and this is a parting piece of
     buffoonery, which I write with tears in my eyes, expecting to be
     agitated. Believe me most seriously and sincerely your obliged
     servant, BYRON.

     "Notwithstanding the contradictory paragraph in the Morning
     Chronicle, which must have been sent by * *, or perhaps--I know not
     why I should suspect Claughton of such a thing, and yet I partly
     do, because it might interrupt his renewal of purchase, if so
     disposed; in short it matters not, but we are all in the road to
     matrimony--lawyers settling, relations congratulating, my intended
     as kind as heart could wish, and every one, whose opinion I value,
     very glad of it. All her relatives, and all mine too, seem equally
     pleased.

     "Perry was very sorry, and has re-contradicted, as you will
     perceive by this day's paper. It was, to be sure, a devil of an
     insertion, since the first paragraph came from Sir Ralph's own
     County Journal, and this in the teeth of it would appear to him and
     his as my denial. But I have written to do away that, enclosing
     Perry's letter, which was very polite and kind.

     "Nobody hates bustle so much as I do; but there seems a fatality
     over every scene of my drama, always a row of some sort or other.
     No matter--Fortune is my best friend; and as I acknowledge my
     obligations to her, I hope she will treat me better than she
     treated the Athenian, who took some merit to himself on some
     occasion, but (after that) took no more towns. In fact, she, that
     exquisite goddess, has hitherto carried me through every thing, and
     will I hope, now; since I own it will be all her doing.

     "Well, now, for thee. Your article on * * is perfection itself. You
     must not leave off reviewing. By Jove, I believe you can do any
     thing. There is wit, and taste, and learning, and good humour
     (though not a whit less severe for that), in every line of that
     critique.

     "Next to your being an E. Reviewer, my being of the same
     kidney, and Jeffrey's being such a friend to both, are amongst the
     events which I conceive were not calculated upon in Mr.--what's his

     "But, Tom, I say--Oons! Scott menaces the 'Lord of the Isles." Do
     you mean to compete? or lay by, till this wave has broke upon the
     shelves? (of booksellers, not rocks--a broken metaphor, by the
     way.) You ought to be afraid of nobody; but your modesty is
     really as provoking and unnecessary as a * *'s. I am very merry,
     and have just been writing some elegiac stanzas on the death of Sir
     P. Parker. He was my first cousin, but never met since boyhood. Our
     relations desired me, and I have scribbled and given it to Perry,
     who will chronicle it to-morrow. I am as sorry for him as one could
     be for one I never saw since I was a child; but should not have
     wept melodiously, except 'at the request of friends.'

     "I hope to get out of town and be married, but I shall take
     Newstead in my way; and you must meet me at Nottingham and
     accompany me to mine Abbey. I will tell you the day when I know it.

     "Ever," &c.

     "P.S. By the way my wife elect is perfection, and I hear of nothing
     but her merits and her wonders, and that she is 'very pretty.' Her
     expectations, I am told, are great; but what, I have not asked. I

     between my friends and me, particularly in your case, I would 'none
     on't.' My agent sets off for Durham next week, and I shall follow
     him, taking Newstead and you in my way. I certainly did not address
     Miss Milbanke with these views, but it is likely she may prove a
     considerable parti. All her father can give, or leave her, he
     will; and from her childless uncle, Lord Wentworth, whose barony,
     it is supposed, will devolve on Ly. Milbanke (her sister), she has
     expectations. But these will depend upon his own disposition, which
     seems very partial towards her. She is an only child, and Sir R.'s
     estates, though dipped by electioneering, are considerable. Part of
     them are settled on her; but whether that will be dowered now,
     I do not know,--though, from what has been intimated to me, it
     probably will. The lawyers are to settle this among them, and I am
     getting my property into matrimonial array, and myself ready for
     the journey to Seaham, which I must make in a week or ten days.

     "I certainly did not dream that she was attached to me, which it
     seems she has been for some time. I also thought her of a very cold
     disposition, in which I was also mistaken--it is a long story, and
     I won't trouble you with it. As to her virtues, &c. &c. you will
     hear enough of them (for she is a kind of pattern in the north),
     without my running into a display on the subject. It is well that
     one of us is of such fame, since there is sad deficit in the
     morale of that article upon my part,--all owing to my 'bitch of a

LETTER 206. TO MR. COWELL.

     "October 22. 1814.

     "My dear Cowell,

     "Many and sincere thanks for your kind letter--the bet, or rather
     forfeit, was one hundred to Hawke, and fifty to Hay (nothing to
     Kelly), for a guinea received from each of the two former.[50] I
     shall feel much obliged by your setting me right if I am incorrect
     in this statement in any way, and have reasons for wishing you to
     recollect as much as possible of what passed, and state it to
     Hodgson. My reason is this: some time ago Mr. * * * required a bet
     of me which I never made, and of course refused to pay, and have
     heard no more of it; to prevent similar mistakes is my object in
     wishing you to remember well what passed, and to put Hodgson in
     possession of your memory on the subject.

     "I hope to see you soon in my way through Cambridge. Remember me to
     H., and believe me ever and truly," &c.

[Footnote 50: He had agreed to forfeit these sums to the persons mentioned, should he ever marry.]

       *       *       *       *       *

Soon after the date of this letter, Lord Byron had to pay a visit to Cambridge for the purpose
of voting for Mr. Clarke, who had been started by Trinity College as one of the candidates
for Sir Busick Harwood's Professorship. On this occasion, a circumstance occurred which could
not but be gratifying to him. As he was delivering in his vote to the Vice-Chancellor, in the
Senate House, the under-graduates in the gallery ventured to testify their admiration of him
by a general murmur of applause and stamping of the feet. For this breach of order, the gallery
was immediately cleared by order of the Vice-Chancellor.

The truth is, I fear, that rarely, if ever, have men of the higher order of genius shown themselves
fitted for the calm affections and comforts that form the cement of domestic life. "One misfortune
(says Pope) of extraordinary geniuses is, that their very friends are more apt to admire than
love them." To this remark there have, no doubt, been exceptions,--and I should pronounce Lord
Byron, from my own experience, to be one of them,--but it would not be difficult, perhaps,
to show, from the very nature and pursuits of genius, that such must generally be the lot of
all pre-eminently gifted with it; and that the same qualities which enable them to command
admiration are also those that too often incapacitate them from conciliating love.

The very habits, indeed, of abstraction and self-study to which the occupations of men of genius
lead, are, in themselves, necessarily, of an unsocial and detaching tendency, and require a
large portion of indulgence from others not to be set down as unamiable. One of the chief sources,
too, of sympathy and society between ordinary mortals being their dependence on each other's
intellectual resources, the operation of this social principle must naturally be weakest in
those whose own mental stores are most abundant and self-sufficing, and who, rich in such materials
for thinking within themselves, are rendered so far independent of any aid from others. It
was this solitary luxury (which Plato called "banqueting his own thoughts") that led Pope,
as well as Lord Byron, to prefer the silence and seclusion of his library to the most agreeable
conversation.--And not only too, is the necessity of commerce with other minds less felt by
such persons, but, from that fastidiousness which the opulence of their own resources generates,
the society of those less gifted than themselves becomes often a restraint and burden, to which
not all the charms of friendship, or even love, can reconcile them. "Nothing is so tiresome
(says the poet of Vaucluse, in assigning a reason for not living with some of his dearest friends)
as to converse with persons who have not the same information as one's self."

But it is the cultivation and exercise of the imaginative faculty that, more than any thing,
tends to wean the man of genius from actual life, and, by substituting the sensibilities of
the imagination for those of the heart, to render, at last, the medium through which he feels
no less unreal than that through which he thinks. Those images of ideal good and beauty that
surround him in his musings soon accustom him to consider all that is beneath this high standard
unworthy of his care; till, at length, the heart becoming chilled as the fancy warms, it too
often happens that, in proportion as he has refined and elevated his theory of all the social
affections, he has unfitted himself for the practice of them.[52] Hence so frequently it arises
that, in persons of this temperament, we see some bright but artificial idol of the brain usurp
the place of all real and natural objects of tenderness. The poet Dante, a wanderer away from
wife and children, passed the whole of a restless and detached life in nursing his immortal
dream of Beatrice; while Petrarch, who would not suffer his only daughter to reside beneath
his roof, expended thirty-two years of poetry and passion on an idealised love.

It is, indeed, in the very nature and essence of genius to be for ever occupied intensely with
Self, as the great centre and source of its strength. Like the sister Rachel, in Dante, sitting
all day before her mirror,

      "mai non si smaga
    Del suo ammiraglio, e siede tutto giorno."

To this power of self-concentration, by which alone all the other powers of genius are made
available, there is, of course, no such disturbing and fatal enemy as those sympathies and
affections that draw the mind out actively towards others[53]; and, accordingly, it will be
found that, among those who have felt within themselves a call to immortality, the greater
number have, by a sort of instinct, kept aloof from such ties, and, instead of the softer duties
and rewards of being amiable, reserved themselves for the high, hazardous chances of being
great. In looking back through the lives of the most illustrious poets,--the class of intellect
in which the characteristic features of genius are, perhaps, most strongly marked,--we shall
find that, with scarcely one exception, from Homer down to Lord Byron, they have been, in their
several degrees, restless and solitary spirits, with minds wrapped up, like silk-worms, in
their own tasks, either strangers, or rebels to domestic ties, and bearing about with them
a deposit for posterity in their souls, to the jealous watching and enriching of which almost
all other thoughts and considerations have been sacrificed.

"To follow poetry as one ought (says the authority[54] I have already quoted), one must forget
father and mother and cleave to it alone." In these few words is pointed out the sole path
that leads genius to greatness. On such terms alone are the high places of fame to be won;--nothing
less than the sacrifice of the entire man can achieve them. However delightful, therefore,
may be the spectacle of a man of genius tamed and domesticated in society, taking docilely
upon him the yoke of the social ties, and enlightening without disturbing the sphere in which
he moves, we must nevertheless, in the midst of our admiration, bear in mind that it is not
thus smoothly or amiably immortality has been ever struggled for, or won. The poet thus circumstanced
may be popular, may be loved; for the happiness of himself and those linked with him he is
in the right road,--but not for greatness. The marks by which Fame has always separated her
great martyrs from the rest of mankind are not upon him, and the crown cannot be his. He may
dazzle, may captivate the circle, and even the times in which he lives, but he is not for hereafter.

To the general description here given of that high class of human intelligences to which he
belonged, the character of Lord Byron was, in many respects, a signal exception. Born with
strong affections and ardent passions, the world had, from first to last, too firm a hold on
his sympathies to let imagination altogether usurp the place of reality, either in his feelings,
or in the objects of them.

But while the naturally warm cast of his affections and temperament gave thus a substance and
truth to his social feelings which those of too many of his fellow votaries of Genius have
wanted, it was not to be expected that an imagination of such range and power should have been
so early developed and unrestrainedly indulged without producing, at last, some of those effects
upon the heart which have invariably been found attendant on such a predominance of this faculty.
It must have been observed, indeed, that the period when his natural affections flourished
most healthily was before he had yet arrived at the full consciousness of his genius,--before
Imagination had yet accustomed him to those glowing pictures, after gazing upon which all else
appeared cold and colourless. From the moment of this initiation into the wonders of his own
mind, a distaste for the realities of life began to grow upon him. Not even that intense craving
after affection, which nature had implanted in him, could keep his ardour still alive in a
pursuit whose results fell so short of his "imaginings;" and though, from time to time, the
combined warmth of his fancy and temperament was able to call up a feeling which to his eyes
wore the semblance of love, it may be questioned whether his heart had ever much share in such
passions, or whether, after his first launch into the boundless sea of imagination, he could
ever have been brought back and fixed by any lasting attachment. Actual objects there were,
in but too great number, who, as long as the illusion continued, kindled up his thoughts and
were the themes of his song. But they were, after all, little more than mere dreams of the
hour;--the qualities with which he invested them were almost all ideal, nor could have stood
the test of a month's, or even week's, cohabitation. It was but the reflection of his own bright
conceptions that he saw in each new object; and while persuading himself that they furnished
the models of his heroines, he was, on the contrary, but fancying that he beheld his heroines
in them.

There needs no stronger proof of the predominance of imagination in these attachments than
his own serious avowal, in the Journal already given, that often, when in the company of the
woman he most loved, he found himself secretly wishing for the solitude of his own study. It
was there, indeed,--in the silence and abstraction of that study,--that the chief scene of
his mistress's empire and glory lay. It was there that, unchecked by reality, and without any
fear of the disenchantments of truth, he could view her through the medium of his own fervid
fancy, enamour himself of an idol of his own creating, and out of a brief delirium of a few
days or weeks, send forth a dream of beauty and passion through all ages.

While such appears to have been the imaginative character of his loves, (of all, except the
one that lived unquenched through all,) his friendships, though, of course, far less subject
to the influence of fancy, could not fail to exhibit also some features characteristic of the
peculiar mind in which they sprung. It was a usual saying of his own, and will be found repeated
in some of his letters, that he had "no genius for friendship," and that whatever capacity
he might once have possessed for that sentiment had vanished with his youth. If in saying thus
he shaped his notions of friendship according to the romantic standard of his boyhood, the
fact must be admitted: but as far as the assertion was meant to imply that he had become incapable
of a warm, manly, and lasting friendship, such a charge against himself was unjust, and I am
not the only living testimony of its injustice.

To a certain degree, however, even in his friendships, the effects of a too vivid imagination,
in disqualifying the mind for the cold contact of reality, were visible. We are told that Petrarch
(who, in this respect, as in most others, may be regarded as a genuine representative of the
poetic character,) abstained purposely from a too frequent intercourse with his nearest friends,
lest, from the sensitiveness he was so aware of in himself, there should occur any thing that
might chill his regard for them [55]; and though Lord Byron was of a nature too full of social
and kindly impulses ever to think of such a precaution, it is a fact confirmatory, at least,
of the principle on which his brother poet, Petrarch, acted, that the friends, whether of his
youth or manhood, of whom he had seen least, through life, were those of whom he always thought
and spoke with the most warmth and fondness. Being brought less often to the touchstone of
familiar intercourse, they stood naturally a better chance of being adopted as the favourites
of his imagination, and of sharing, in consequence, a portion of that bright colouring reserved
for all that gave it interest and pleasure. Next to the dead, therefore, whose hold upon his
fancy had been placed beyond all risk of severance, those friends whom he but saw occasionally,
and by such favourable glimpses as only renewed the first kindly impression they had made,
were the surest to live unchangingly, and without shadow, in his memory.

To this same cause, there is little doubt, his love for his sister owed much of its devotedness
and fervour. In a mind sensitive and versatile as his, long habits of family intercourse might
have estranged, or at least dulled, his natural affection for her;--but their separation, during
youth, left this feeling fresh and untried.[56] His very inexperience in such ties made the
smile of a sister no less a novelty than a charm to him; and before the first gloss of this
newly awakened sentiment had time to wear off, they were again separated, and for ever.

If the portrait which I have here attempted of the general character of those gifted with high
genius be allowed to bear, in any of its features, a resemblance to the originals, it can no
longer, I think, be matter of question whether a class so set apart from the track of ordinary
life, so removed, by their very elevation, out of the influences of our common atmosphere,
are at all likely to furnish tractable subjects for that most trying of all social experiments,
matrimony. But the fate of the poets in matrimony has but justified the caution of the philosophers.
While the latter have given warning to genius by keeping free of the yoke, the others have
still more effectually done so by their misery under it;--the annals of this sensitive race
having, at all times, abounded with proofs, that genius ranks but low among the elements of
social happiness,--that, in general, the brighter the gift, the more disturbing its influence,
and that in married life particularly, its effects have been too often like that of the "Wormwood
Star," whose light filled the waters on which it fell with bitterness.

Besides the causes already enumerated as leading naturally to such a result, from the peculiarities
by which, in most instances, these great labourers in the field of thought are characterised,
there is also much, no doubt, to be attributed to an unluckiness in the choice of helpmates,--dictated,
as that choice frequently must be, by an imagination accustomed to deceive itself. But from
whatever causes it may have arisen, the coincidence is no less striking than saddening, that,
on the list of married poets who have been unhappy in their homes, there should already be
found four such illustrious names as Dante, Milton[58], Shakspeare[59], and Dryden; and that
we should now have to add, as a partner in their destiny, a name worthy of being placed beside
the greatest of them,--Lord Byron.

I have already mentioned my having been called up to town in the December of this year. The
opportunities I had of seeing Lord Byron during my stay were frequent; and, among them, not
the least memorable or agreeable were those evenings we passed together at the house of his
banker, Mr. Douglas Kinnaird, where music,--followed by its accustomed sequel of supper, brandy
and water, and not a little laughter,--kept us together, usually, till rather a late hour.
Besides those songs of mine which he has himself somewhere recorded as his favourites, there
was also one to a Portuguese air, "The song of war shall echo through our mountains," which
seemed especially to please him;--the national character of the music, and the recurrence of
the words "sunny mountains," bringing back freshly to his memory the impressions of all he
had seen in Portugal. I have, indeed, known few persons more alive to the charms of simple
music; and not unfrequently have seen the tears in his eyes while listening to the Irish Melodies.
Among those that thus affected him was one beginning "When first I met thee warm and young,"
the words of which, besides the obvious feeling which they express, were intended also to admit
of a political application. He, however, discarded the latter sense wholly from his mind, and
gave himself up to the more natural sentiment of the song with evident emotion.

On one or two of these evenings, his favourite actor, Mr. Kean, was of the party; and on another
occasion, we had at dinner his early instructor in pugilism, Mr. Jackson, in conversing with
whom, all his boyish tastes seemed to revive;--and it was not a little amusing to observe how
perfectly familiar with the annals of "The Ring[60]," and with all the most recondite phraseology
of "the Fancy," was the sublime poet of Childe Harold.

The following note is the only one, of those I received from him at this time, worth transcribing:--

     "December 14. 1814.

     "My dearest Tom,

     "I will send the pattern to-morrow, and since you don't go to our
     friend ('of the keeping part of the town') this evening, I shall
     e'en sulk at home over a solitary potation. My self-opinion rises
     much by your eulogy of my social qualities. As my friend Scrope is
     pleased to say, I believe I am very well for a 'holiday drinker.'
     Where the devil are you? With Woolridge[61], I conjecture--for
     which you deserve another abscess. Hoping that the American war
     will last for many years, and that all the prizes may be registered
     at Bermoothes, believe me, &c.

     "P.S. I have just been composing an epistle to the Archbishop for
     an especial licence. Oons! it looks serious. Murray is impatient to
     see you, and would call, if you will give him audience. Your new
     coat!--I wonder you like the colour, and don't go about, like
     Dives, in purple."

[Footnote 51: I had frequently, both in earnest and in jest, expressed these hopes to him;
and, in one of my letters, after touching upon some matters relative to my own little domestic
circle, I added, "This will all be unintelligible to you; though I sometimes cannot help thinking
it within the range of possibility, that even you, volcano as you are, may, one day, cool down
into something of the same habitable state. Indeed, when one thinks of lava having been converted
into buttons for Isaac Hawkins Browne, there is no saying what such fiery things may be brought
to at last."]

[Footnote 52: Of the lamentable contrast between sentiments and conduct, which this transfer
of the seat of sensibility from the heart to the fancy produces, the annals of literary men
afford unluckily too many examples. Alfieri, though he could write a sonnet full of tenderness
to his mother, never saw her (says Mr. W. Rose) but once after their early separation, though
he frequently passed within a few miles of her residence. The poet Young, with all his parade
of domestic sorrows, was, it appears, a neglectful husband and harsh father; and Sterne (to
use the words employed by Lord Byron) preferred "whining over a dead ass to relieving a living
mother."]

[Footnote 53: It is the opinion of Diderot, in his Treatise on Acting, that not only in the
art of which he treats, but in all those which are called imitative, the possession of real
sensibility is a bar to eminence;--sensibility being, according to his view, "le caractere
de la bonté de l'ame et de la médiocrité du génie."]

[Footnote 54: Pope.]

[Footnote 55: See Foscolo's Essay on Petrarch. On the same principle, Orrery says, in speaking
of Swift, "I am persuaded that his distance from his English friends proved a strong incitement
to their mutual affection."]

[Footnote 56: That he was himself fully aware of this appears from a passage in one of his
letters already given:--"My sister is in town, which is a great comfort; for, never having
been much together, we are naturally more attached to each other."]

[Footnote 57: Wife and children, Bacon tells us in one of his Essays, are "impediments to great
enterprises;" and adds, "Certainly, the best works, and of greatest merit for the public, have
proceeded from the unmarried or childless men." See, with reference to this subject, chapter
xviii. of Mr. D'Israeli's work on "The Literary Character."]

[Footnote 58: Milton's first wife, it is well known, ran away from him, within a month after
their marriage, disgusted, says Phillips, "with his spare diet and hard study;" and it is difficult
to conceive a more melancholy picture of domestic life than is disclosed in his nuncupative
will, one of the witnesses to which deposes to having heard the great poet himself complain,
that his children "were careless of him, being blind, and made nothing of deserting him."]

[Footnote 59: By whatever austerity of temper or habits the poets Dante and Milton may have
drawn upon themselves such a fate, it might be expected that, at least, the "gentle Shakspeare"
would have stood exempt from the common calamity of his brethren. But, among the very few facts
of his life that have been transmitted to us, there is none more clearly proved than the unhappiness
of his marriage. The dates of the birth of his children, compared with that of his removal
from Stratford,--the total omission of his wife's name in the first draft of his will, and
the bitter sarcasm of the bequest by which he remembers her afterwards,--all prove beyond a
doubt both his separation from the lady early in life, and his unfriendly feeling towards her
at the close of it.

In endeavouring to argue against the conclusion naturally to be deduced from this will, Boswell,
with a strange ignorance of human nature, remarks:--"If he had taken offence at any part of
his wife's conduct, I cannot believe that he would have taken this petty mode of expressing it."]

[Footnote 60: In a small book which I have in my possession, containing a sort of chronological
History of the Ring, I find the name of Lord Byron, more than once, recorded among the "backers."]

[Footnote 61: Dr. Woolriche, an old and valued friend of mine, to whose skill, on the occasion
here alluded to, I was indebted for my life.]

     improvements.

     the greatest haste.

     "P.S. I have written this most illegibly; but it is to beg you to

     original; and he don't know what to say. But do do it: that is,
     burn the plate, and employ a new etcher from the other picture.

On his arrival in town, he had, upon enquiring into the state of his affairs, found them in
so utterly embarrassed a condition as to fill him with some alarm, and even to suggest to his
mind the prudence of deferring his marriage. The die was, however, cast, and he had now no
alternative but to proceed. Accordingly, at the end of December, accompanied by his friend
Mr. Hobhouse, he set out for Seaham, the seat of Sir Ralph Milbanke, the lady's father, in
the county of Durham, and on the 2d of January, 1815, was married. In that Memoir, he described
himself as waking, on the morning of his marriage, with the most melancholy reflections, on
seeing his wedding-suit spread out before him. In the same mood, he wandered about the grounds
alone, till he was summoned for the ceremony, and joined, for the first time on that day, his
bride and her family. He knelt down, he repeated the words after the clergyman; but a mist
was before his eyes,--his thoughts were elsewhere; and he was but awakened by the congratulations
of the bystanders, to find that he was--married.

The same morning, the wedded pair left Seaham for Halnaby, another seat of Sir Ralph Milbanke,
in the same county. When about to depart, Lord Byron said to the bride, "Miss Milbanke, are
you ready?"--a mistake which the lady's confidential attendant pronounced to be a "bad omen."

It is right to add, that I quote these slight details from memory, and am alone answerable
for any inaccuracy there may be found in them.

from you, who are one of the philocynic sect, whether it is probable, that any dog (out of
a melodrame) could recognise a master, whom neither his own mother or mistress was able to
find out. I don't care about Ulysses's dog, &c.--all I want is to know from you (who are renowned
as 'friend of the dog, companion of the bear') whether such a thing is probable."]

LETTER 211. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Seaham, Stockton-on-Tees, February 2. 1815.

     "I have heard from London that you have left Chatsworth and all the
     women full of 'entusymusy'[66] about you, personally and
     poetically; and, in particular, that 'When first I met thee' has
     been quite overwhelming in its effect. I told you it was one of the
     best things you ever wrote, though that dog Power wanted you to
     omit part of it. They are all regretting your absence at
     Chatsworth, according to my informant--'all the ladies quite,' &c.
     &c. &c. Stap my vitals!

     "Well, now you have got home again--which I dare say is as
     agreeable as a 'draught of cool small beer to the scorched palate
     of a waking sot'--now you have got home again, I say, probably I
     shall hear from you. Since I wrote last, I have been transferred to
     my father-in-law's, with my lady and my lady's maid, &c. &c. &c.
     and the treacle-moon is over, and I am awake, and find myself
     married. My spouse and I agree to--and in--admiration. Swift says
     'no wise man ever married;' but, for a fool, I think it the most
     ambrosial of all possible future states. I still think one ought to
     marry upon lease; but am very sure I should renew mine at the
     expiration, though next term were for ninety and nine years.

     "I wish you would respond, for I am here 'oblitusque meorum
     obliviscendus et illis.' Pray tell me what is going on in the way
     of intriguery, and how the w----s and rogues of the upper Beggar's
     Opera go on--or rather go off--in or after marriage; or who are
     going to break any particular commandment. Upon this dreary coast,
     we have nothing but county meetings and shipwrecks; and I have this
     day dined upon fish, which probably dined upon the crews of several
     colliers lost in the late gales. But I saw the sea once more in all
     the glories of surf and foam,--almost equal to the Bay of Biscay,
     and the interesting white squalls and short seas of Archipelago
     memory.

     tax-meeting; and not only at Durham, but here, several times since,

     So, it may be as well to tell him that it is not mine; but that if
     I did not firmly and truly believe it to be much better than I
     could offer, I would never have troubled him or you about it. You
     can judge between you how far it is admissible, and reject it, if
     not of the right sort. For my own part, I have no interest in the

     "Yesterday I sent off the packet and letter to Edinburgh. It
     consisted of forty-one pages, so that I have not added a line; but
     in my letter, I mentioned what passed between you and me in autumn,
     as my inducement for presuming to trouble him either with my own or
     * *'s lucubrations. I am any thing but sure that it will do; but I
     have told J. that if there is any decent raw material in it, he may
     cut it into what shape he pleases, and warp it to his liking.

     "So you won't go abroad, then, with me,--but alone. I fully
     purpose starting much about the time you mention, and alone, too.

     "I hope J. won't think me very impudent in sending * * only: there
     was not room for a syllable. I have avowed * * as the author, and
     said that you thought or said, when I met you last, that he (J.)
     would not be angry at the coalition, (though, alas! we have not
     coalesced,) and so, if I have got into a scrape, I must get out of
     it--Heaven knows how.

     impression) the packet and epistle to our patron.

     "'Not meet'--pray don't say so. We must meet somewhere or somehow.
     Newstead is out of the question, being nearly sold again, or, if
     not, it is uninhabitable for my spouse. Pray write again. I will

     much shocked by the death of the Duke of Dorset. We were at school
     together, and there I was passionately attached to him. Since, we
     have never met--but once, I think, since 1805--and it would be a
     paltry affectation to pretend that I had any feeling for him worth
     the name. But there was a time in my life when this event would
     have broken my heart; and all I can say for it now is that--it is
     not worth breaking.

     but the recollection of the uselessness and worthlessness of any
     observations on such events prevented me. I shall only now add,
     that I rejoice to see you bear it so well, and that I trust time
     will enable Mrs. M. to sustain it better. Every thing should be
     done to divert and occupy her with other thoughts and cares, and I
     am sure that all that can be done will.

     "Now to your letter. Napoleon--but the papers will have told you
     all. I quite think with you upon the subject, and for my real
     thoughts this time last year, I would refer you to the last pages
     of the Journal I gave you. I can forgive the rogue for utterly
     falsifying every line of mine Ode--which I take to be the last and
     uttermost stretch of human magnanimity. Do you remember the story
     of a certain Abbé, who wrote a treatise on the Swedish
     Constitution, and proved it indissoluble and eternal? Just as he
     had corrected the last sheet, news came that Gustavus III. had
     destroyed this immortal government. 'Sir,' quoth the Abbé, 'the
     King of Sweden may overthrow the constitution, but not my
     book!!' I think of the Abbé, but not with him.

     "Making every allowance for talent and most consummate daring,
     there is, after all, a good deal in luck or destiny. He might have
     been stopped by our frigates--or wrecked in the Gulf of Lyons,
     which is particularly tempestuous--or--a thousand things. But he is
     certainly Fortune's favourite, and

    Once fairly set out on his party of pleasure,
    Taking towns at his liking and crowns at his leisure,
    From Elba to Lyons and Paris he goes,
    Making balls for the ladies, and bows to his foes.

     You must have seen the account of his driving into the middle of
     the royal army, and the immediate effect of his pretty speeches.
     And now if he don't drub the allies, there is 'no purchase in
     money.' If he can take France by himself, the devil's in 't if he
     don't repulse the invaders, when backed by those celebrated
     sworders--those boys of the blade, the Imperial Guard, and the old
     and new army. It is impossible not to be dazzled and overwhelmed by
     his character and career. Nothing ever so disappointed me as his
     abdication, and nothing could have reconciled me to him but some
     such revival as his recent exploit; though no one could anticipate
     such a complete and brilliant renovation.

     "To your question, I can only answer that there have been some
     symptoms which look a little gestatory. It is a subject upon which
     I am not particularly anxious, except that I think it would please
     her uncle, Lord Wentworth, and her father and mother. The former
     (Lord W.) is now in town, and in very indifferent health. You,
     perhaps, know that his property, amounting to seven or eight
     thousand a year, will eventually devolve upon Bell. But the old
     gentleman has been so very kind to her and me, that I hardly know
     how to wish him in heaven, if he can be comfortable on earth. Her
     father is still in the country.

     "We mean to metropolise to-morrow, and you will address your next
     to Piccadilly. We have got the Duchess of Devon's house there, she
     being in France.

     "I don't care what Power says to secure the property of the Song,
     so that it is not complimentary to me, nor any thing about
     'condescending' or 'noble author'--both 'vile phrases,' as
     Polonius says.

     "Pray, let me hear from you, and when you mean to be in town. Your
     continental scheme is impracticable for the present. I have to
     thank you for a longer letter than usual, which I hope will induce
     you to tax my gratitude still further in the same way.

     "It will give me great pleasure to comply with your request, though
     I hope there is still taste enough left amongst us to render it
     almost unnecessary, sordid and interested as, it must be admitted,
     many of 'the trade' are, where circumstances give them an
     advantage. I trust you do not permit yourself to be depressed by
     the temporary partiality of what is called 'the public' for the
     favourites of the moment; all experience is against the permanency
     of such impressions. You must have lived to see many of these pass
     away, and will survive many more--I mean personally, for
     poetically, I would not insult you by a comparison.

     "If I may be permitted, I would suggest that there never was such
     an opening for tragedy. In Kean, there is an actor worthy of
     expressing the thoughts of the characters which you have every
     power of embodying; and I cannot but regret that the part of
     Ordonio was disposed of before his appearance at Drury Lane. We
     have had nothing to be mentioned in the same breath with 'Remorse'
     for very many years; and I should think that the reception of that
     play was sufficient to encourage the highest hopes of author and
     audience. It is to be hoped that you are proceeding in a career
     which could not but be successful. With my best respects to Mr.
     Bowles, I have the honour to be

     "Your obliged and very obedient servant,

       *       *       *       *       *

It was in the course of this spring that Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott became, for the first
time, personally acquainted with each other. Mr. Murray, having been previously on a visit
to the latter gentleman, had been intrusted by him with a superb Turkish dagger as a present
to Lord Byron; and the noble poet, on their meeting this year in London,--the only time when
these two great men had ever an opportunity of enjoying each other's society,--presented to
Sir Walter, in return, a vase containing some human bones that had been dug up from under a
part of the old walls of Athens. The reader, however, will be much better pleased to have these
particulars in the words of Sir Walter Scott himself, who, with that good-nature which renders
him no less amiable than he is admirable, has found time, in the midst of all his marvellous
labours for the world, to favour me with the following interesting communication:[78]--

"My first acquaintance with Byron began in a manner rather doubtful. I was so far from having
any thing to do with the offensive criticism in the Edinburgh, that I remember remonstrating
against it with our friend, the editor, because I thought the 'Hours of Idleness' treated with
undue severity. They were written, like all juvenile poetry, rather from the recollection of
what had pleased the author in others than what had been suggested by his own imagination;
but, nevertheless, I thought they contained some passages of noble promise. I was so much impressed
with this, that I had thoughts of writing to the author; but some exaggerated reports concerning
his peculiarities, and a natural unwillingness to intrude an opinion which was uncalled for,
induced me to relinquish the idea.

"When Byron wrote his famous Satire, I had my share of flagellation among my betters. My crime
was having written a poem (Marmion, I think) for a thousand pounds; which was no otherwise
true than that I sold the copy-right for that sum. Now, not to mention that an author can hardly
be censured for accepting such a sum as the booksellers are willing to give him, especially
as the gentlemen of the trade made no complaints of their bargain, I thought the interference
with my private affairs was rather beyond the limits of literary satire. On the other hand,
Lord Byron paid me, in several passages, so much more praise than I deserved, that I must have
been more irritable than I have ever felt upon such subjects, not to sit down contented, and
think no more about the matter.

"I was very much struck, with all the rest of the world, at the vigour and force of imagination
displayed in the first Cantos of Childe Harold, and the other splendid productions which Lord
Byron flung from him to the public with a promptitude that savoured of profusion. My own popularity,
as a poet, was then on the wane, and I was unaffectedly pleased to see an author of so much
power and energy taking the field. Mr. John Murray happened to be in Scotland that season,
and as I mentioned to him the pleasure I should have in making Lord Byron's acquaintance, he
had the kindness to mention my wish to his Lordship, which led to some correspondence.

"It was in the spring of 1815 that, chancing to be in London, I had the advantage of a personal
introduction to Lord Byron. We met, for an hour or two almost daily, in Mr. Murray's drawing-room,
and found a great deal to say to each other. We also met frequently in parties and evening
society, so that for about two months I had the advantage of a considerable intimacy with this
distinguished individual. Our sentiments agreed a good deal, except upon the subjects of religion
and politics, upon neither of which I was inclined to believe that Lord Byron entertained very
fixed opinions. I remember saying to him, that I really thought, that if he lived a few years
he would alter his sentiments. He answered, rather sharply, 'I suppose you are one of those
who prophesy I will turn Methodist.' I replied, 'No--I don't expect your conversion to be of
such an ordinary kind. I would rather look to see you retreat upon the Catholic faith, and
distinguish yourself by the austerity of your penances. The species of religion to which you
must, or may, one day attach yourself must exercise a strong power on the imagination.' He
smiled gravely, and seemed to allow I might be right.

"On politics, he used sometimes to express a high strain of what is now called Liberalism;
but it appeared to me that the pleasure it afforded him as a vehicle of displaying his wit
and satire against individuals in office was at the bottom of this habit of thinking, rather
than any real conviction of the political principles on which he talked. He was certainly proud
of his rank and ancient family, and, in that respect, as much an aristocrat as was consistent
with good sense and good breeding. Some disgusts, how adopted I know not, seemed to me to have
given this peculiar and, as it appeared to me, contradictory cast of mind: but, at heart, I
would have termed Byron a patrician on principle.

"Lord Byron's reading did not seem to me to have been very extensive either in poetry or history.
Having the advantage of him in that respect, and possessing a good competent share of such
reading as is little read, I was sometimes able to put under his eye objects which had for
him the interest of novelty. I remember particularly repeating to him the fine poem of Hardyknute,
an imitation of the old Scottish Ballad, with which he was so much affected, that some one
who was in the same apartment asked me what I could possibly have been telling Byron by which
he was so much agitated.

I saw Byron, for the last time, in 1815, after I returned from France. He dined, or lunched,
with me at Long's in Bond Street. I never saw him so full of gaiety and good-humour, to which
the presence of Mr. Mathews, the comedian, added not a little. Poor Terry was also present.
After one of the gayest parties I ever was present at, my fellow-traveller, Mr. Scott, of Gala,
and I set off for Scotland, and I never saw Lord Byron again. Several letters passed between
us--one perhaps every half year.

"We had a good deal of laughing, I remember, on what the public might be supposed to think,
or say, concerning the gloomy and ominous nature of our mutual gifts.

"I think I can add little more to my recollections of Byron. He was often melancholy,--almost
gloomy. When I observed him in this humour, I used either to wait till it went off of its own
accord, or till some natural and easy mode occurred of leading him into conversation, when
the shadows almost always left his countenance, like the mist rising from a landscape. In conversation
he was very animated.

"I met with him very frequently in society; our mutual acquaintances doing me the honour to
think that he liked to meet with me. Some very agreeable parties I can recollect,--particularly
one at Sir George Beaumont's, where the amiable landlord had assembled some persons distinguished
for talent. Of these I need only mention the late Sir Humphry Davy, whose talents for literature
were as remarkable as his empire over science. Mr. Richard Sharpe and Mr. Rogers were also present.

"I think I also remarked in Byron's temper starts of suspicion, when he seemed to pause and
consider whether there had not been a secret, and perhaps offensive, meaning in something casually
said to him. In this case, I also judged it best to let his mind, like a troubled spring, work
itself clear, which it did in a minute or two. I was considerably older, you will recollect,
than my noble friend, and had no reason to fear his misconstruing my sentiments towards him,
nor had I ever the slightest reason to doubt that they were kindly returned on his part. If
I had occasion to be mortified by the display of genius which threw into the shade such pretensions
as I was then supposed to possess, I might console myself that, in my own case, the materials
of mental happiness had been mingled in a greater proportion.

"I rummage my brains in vain for what often rushes into my head unbidden,--little traits and
sayings which recall his looks, manner, tone, and gestures; and I have always continued to
think that a crisis of life was arrived in which a new career of fame was opened to him, and
that had he been permitted to start upon it, he would have obliterated the memory of such parts
of his life as friends would wish to forget."

[Footnote 78: A few passages at the beginning of these recollections have been omitted, as
containing particulars relative to Lord Byron's mother, which have already been mentioned in
the early part of this work. Among these, however, there is one anecdote, the repetition of
which will be easily pardoned, on account of the infinitely greater interest as well as authenticity
imparted to its details by coming from such an eye-witness as Sir Walter Scott:--"I remember,"
he says, "having seen Lord Byron's mother before she was married, and a certain coincidence
rendered the circumstance rather remarkable. It was during Mrs. Siddons's first or second visit
to Edinburgh, when the music of that wonderful actress's voice, looks, manner, and person,
produced the strongest effect which could possibly be exerted by a human being upon her fellow-creatures.
Nothing of the kind that I ever witnessed approached it by a hundred degrees. The high state
of excitation was aided by the difficulties of obtaining entrance and the exhausting length
of time that the audience were contented to wait until the piece commenced. When the curtain
fell, a large proportion of the ladies were generally in hysterics.

"I remember Miss Gordon of Ghight, in particular, harrowing the house by the desperate and
wild way in which she shrieked out Mrs. Siddons's exclamation, in the character of Isabella,
'Oh my Byron! Oh my Byron!' A well-known medical gentleman, the benevolent Dr. Alexander Wood,
tendered his assistance; but the thick-pressed audience could not for a long time make way
for the doctor to approach his patient, or the patient the physician. The remarkable circumstance
was, that the lady had not then seen Captain Byron, who, like Sir Toby, made her conclude with
'Oh!' as she had begun with it."]

[Footnote 79: Mr. Murray had, at the time of giving the vase, suggested to Lord Byron, that
it would increase the value of the gift to add some such inscription; but the feeling of the
noble poet on this subject will be understood from the following answer which he returned:--

     "April 9. 1815.

     "Thanks for the books. I have great objection to your proposition
     about inscribing the vase,--which is, that it would appear
     ostentatious on my part; and of course I must send it as it is,
     without any alteration.

LETTER 220. TO MR. MOORE.

     "April 23. 1815.

     "Lord Wentworth died last week. The bulk of his property (from
     seven to eight thousand per ann.) is entailed on Lady Milbanke and
     Lady Byron. The first is gone to take possession in Leicestershire,
     and attend the funeral, &c. this day.

     "I have mentioned the facts of the settlement of Lord W.'s
     property, because the newspapers, with their usual accuracy, have
     been making all kinds of blunders in their statement. His will is
     just as expected--the principal part settled on Lady Milbanke (now
     Noel) and Bell, and a separate estate left for sale to pay debts
     (which are not great) and legacies to his natural son and daughter.

     Mrs. * *'s tragedy was last night damned. They may bring it on
     again, and probably will; but damned it was,--not a word of the
     last act audible. I went (malgré that I ought to have stayed at
     home in sackcloth for unc., but I could not resist the first
     night of any thing) to a private and quiet nook of my private box,
     and witnessed the whole process. The first three acts, with
     transient gushes of applause, oozed patiently but heavily on. I
     must say it was badly acted, particularly by * *, who was groaned
     upon in the third act,--something about 'horror--such a horror' was
     the cause. Well, the fourth act became as muddy and turbid as need
     be; but the fifth--what Garrick used to call (like a fool) the
     concoction of a play--the fifth act stuck fast at the King's
     prayer. You know he says, 'he never went to bed without saying
     them, and did not like to omit them now.' But he was no sooner upon
     his knees, than the audience got upon their legs--the damnable
     pit--and roared, and groaned, and hissed, and whistled. Well, that
     was choked a little; but the ruffian-scene--the penitent
     peasantry--and killing the Bishop and Princes--oh, it was all over.
     The curtain fell upon unheard actors, and the announcement
     attempted by Kean for Monday was equally ineffectual. Mrs. Bartley
     was so frightened, that, though the people were tolerably quiet,
     the epilogue was quite inaudible to half the house. In short,--you
     know all. I clapped till my hands were skinless, and so did Sir
     James Mackintosh, who was with me in the box. All the world were in
     the house, from the Jerseys, Greys, &c. &c. downwards. But it would
     not do. It is, after all, not an acting play; good language, but
     no power. * * * Women (saving Joanna Baillie) cannot write tragedy:
     they have not seen enough nor felt enough of life for it. I think
     Semiramis or Catherine II. might have written (could they have been
     unqueened) a rare play.

     "It is, however, a good warning not to risk or write tragedies. I
     never had much bent that way; but if I had, this would have cured
     me.

LETTER 222. TO MR. MOORE.[81]

     "13. Piccadilly Terrace, June 12. 1815.

     "I have nothing to offer in behalf of my late silence, except the
     most inveterate and ineffable laziness; but I am too supine to
     invent a lie, or I certainly should, being ashamed of the truth.
     K * *, I hope, has appeased your magnanimous indignation at his
     blunders. I wished and wish you were in the Committee, with all my
     heart.[82] It seems so hopeless a business, that the company of a
     friend would be quite consoling,--but more of this when we meet.
     In the mean time, you are entreated to prevail upon Mrs. Esterre to
     engage herself. I believe she has been written to, but your
     influence, in person or proxy, would probably go further than our
     proposals. What they are, I know not; all my new function
     consists in listening to the despair of Cavendish Bradshaw, the
     hopes of Kinnaird, the wishes of Lord Essex, the complaints of
     Whitbread, and the calculations of Peter Moore,--all of which, and
     whom, seem totally at variance. C. Bradshaw wants to light the
     theatre with gas, which may, perhaps (if the vulgar be believed),
     poison half the audience, and all the dramatis personæ. Essex has
     endeavoured to persuade K * * not to get drunk, the consequence of
     which is, that he has never been sober since. Kinnaird, with equal
     success, would have convinced Raymond, that he, the said Raymond,
     had too much salary. Whitbread wants us to assess the pit another
     sixpence,--a d----d insidious proposition,--which will end in an
     O.P. combustion. To crown all, R * *, the auctioneer, has the
     impudence to be displeased, because he has no dividend. The villain
     is a proprietor of shares, and a long lunged orator in the
     meetings. I hear he has prophesied our incapacity,--'a foregone
     conclusion,' whereof I hope to give him signal proofs before we
     are done.

     "Will you give us an opera? No, I'll be sworn; but I wish you
     would.

     "To go on with the poetical world, Walter Scott has gone back to
     Scotland. Murray, the bookseller, has been cruelly cudgelled of
     misbegotten knaves, 'in Kendal green,' at Newington Butts, in his
     way home from a purlieu dinner,--and robbed--would you believe
     it?--of three or four bonds of forty pound a piece, and a seal-ring
     of his grandfather's, worth a million! This is his version,--but
     others opine that D'Israeli, with whom he dined, knocked him down
     with his last publication, 'The Quarrels of Authors,' in a dispute
     about copyright. Be that as it may, the newspapers have teemed with
     his 'injuria formæ,' and he has been embrocated, and invisible to
     all but the apothecary ever since.

     "Lady B. is better than three months advanced in her progress
     towards maternity, and, we hope, likely to go well through with it.
     We have been very little out this season, as I wish to keep her
     quiet in her present situation. Her father and mother have changed
     their names to Noel, in compliance with Lord Wentworth's will, and
     in complaisance to the property bequeathed by him.

     "I hear that you have been gloriously received by the Irish,--and
     so you ought. But don't let them kill you with claret and kindness
     at the national dinner in your honour, which, I hear and hope, is
     in contemplation. If you will tell me the day, I'll get drunk
     myself on this side of the water, and waft you an applauding hiccup
     over the Channel.

     "Of politics, we have nothing but the yell for war; and C * * h is
     preparing his head for the pike, on which we shall see it carried
     before he has done. The loan has made every body sulky. I hear
     often from Paris, but in direct contradiction to the home
     statements of our hirelings. Of domestic doings, there has been
     nothing since Lady D * *. Not a divorce stirring,--but a good many
     in embryo, in the shape of marriages.

     "I enclose you an epistle received this morning from I know not
     whom; but I think it will amuse you. The writer must be a rare
     fellow.[83]

     "P.S. A gentleman named D'Alton (not your Dalton) has sent me a
     National Poem called 'Dermid.' The same cause which prevented my
     writing to you operated against my wish to write to him an epistle
     of thanks. If you see him, will you make all kinds of fine speeches
     for me, and tell him that I am the laziest and most ungrateful of
     mortals?

     "A word more;--don't let Sir John Stevenson (as an evidence on
     trials for copy-right, &c.) talk about the price of your next poem,
     or they will come upon you for the property tax for it. I am
     serious, and have just heard a long story of the rascally tax-men
     making Scott pay for his. So, take care. Three hundred is a devil
     of a deduction out of three thousand."

gone about the middle of the preceding month.]

[Footnote 82: He had lately become one of the members of the Sub-Committee, (consisting, besides
himself, of the persons mentioned in this letter,) who had taken upon themselves the management
of Drury Lane Theatre; and it had been his wish, on the first construction of the Committee,
that I should be one of his colleagues. To some mistake in the mode of conveying this proposal
to me, he alludes in the preceding sentence.]

     Providence keeps as it were in a garrison another potentate, who,
     in the language of Mr. Burke, 'he hurled from his throne.' See if

     every respect, human nature is the same, in every clime and in

     "July 7. 1815.

     "'Grata superveniet,' &c. &c. I had written to you again, but burnt
     the letter, because I began to think you seriously hurt at my
     indolence, and did not know how the buffoonery it contained might
     be taken. In the mean time, I have yours, and all is well.

     "I had given over all hopes of yours. By-the-by, my 'grata
     superveniet' should be in the present tense; for I perceive it
     looks now as if it applied to this present scrawl reaching you,
     whereas it is to the receipt of thy Kilkenny epistle that I have
     tacked that venerable sentiment.

     "Poor Whitbread died yesterday morning,--a sudden and severe loss.
     His health had been wavering, but so fatal an attack was not
     apprehended. He dropped down, and I believe never spoke
     afterwards. I perceive Perry attributes his death to Drury Lane,--a
     consolatory encouragement to the new Committee. I have no doubt
     that * *, who is of a plethoric habit, will be bled immediately;
     and as I have, since my marriage, lost much of my paleness,
     and--'horresco referens' (for I hate even moderate fat)--that
     happy slenderness, to which, when I first knew you, I had attained,
     I by no means sit easy under this dispensation of the Morning
     Chronicle. Every one must regret the loss of Whitbread; he was
     surely a great and very good man.

     "Paris is taken for the second time. I presume it, for the future,
     will have an anniversary capture. In the late battles, like all the
     world, I have lost a connection,--poor Frederick Howard, the best
     of his race. I had little intercourse, of late years, with his
     family, but I never saw or heard but good of him. Hobhouse's
     brother is killed. In short, the havoc has not left a family out of
     its tender mercies.

     "Every hope of a republic is over, and we must go on under the old
     system. From this, however, Wellington
     should be excepted. He is a man,--and the Scipio of our Hannibal.
     However, he may thank the Russian frosts, which destroyed the
     real élite of the French army, for the successes of Waterloo.

     "La! Moore--how you blasphemes about 'Parnassus' and 'Moses!' I am
     ashamed for you. Won't you do any thing for the drama? We beseech
     an Opera. Kinnaird's blunder was partly mine. I wanted you of all
     things in the Committee, and so did he. But we are now glad you
     were wiser; for it is, I doubt, a bitter business.

     "When shall we see you in England? Sir Ralph Noel (late
     Milbanke--he don't promise to be late Noel in a hurry), finding
     that one man can't inhabit two houses, has given his place in the
     north to me for a habitation; and there Lady B. threatens to be
     brought to bed in November. Sir R. and my Lady Mother are to
     quarter at Kirby--Lord Wentworth's that was. Perhaps you and Mrs.
     Moore will pay us a visit at Seaham in the course of the autumn. If
     so, you and I (without our wives) will take a lark to Edinburgh
     and embrace Jeffrey. It is not much above one hundred miles from
     us. But all this, and other high matters, we will discuss at
     meeting, which I hope will be on your return. We don't leave town

     any, they will be trifling, and you shall be duly apprised. I would
     suggest that you should not attend any except the latter

TO MR. SOTHEBY.

     "September 25. 1815.

     "Dear Sir,

     "I think it would be advisable for you to see the acting managers
     when convenient, as there must be points on which you will want to
     confer; the objection I stated was merely on the part of the
     performers, and is general and not particular to this instance.
     I thought it as well to mention it at once--and some of the
     rehearsals you will doubtless see, notwithstanding.

     "Rae, I rather think, has his eye on Naritzin for himself. He is a
     more popular performer than Bartley, and certainly the cast will be
     stronger with him in it; besides, he is one of the managers, and
     will feel doubly interested if he can act in both capacities. Mrs.
     Bartley will be Petrowna;--as to the Empress, I know not what to
     say or think. The truth is, we are not amply furnished with tragic
     women; but make the best of those we have,--you can take your
     choice of them. We have all great hopes of the success--on which,
     setting aside other considerations, we are particularly anxious, as
     being the first tragedy to be brought out since the old Committee.

     "By the way--I have a charge against you. As the great Mr. Dennis
     roared out on a similar occasion--'By G----d, that is my
     thunder!' so do I exclaim, 'This is my lightning!' I allude to
     a speech of Ivan's, in the scene with Petrowna and the Empress,
     where the thought and almost expression are similar to Conrad's in
     the 3d Canto of 'The Corsair.' I, however, do not say this to
     accuse you, but to exempt myself from suspicion[84], as there is a
     priority of six months' publication, on my part, between the
     appearance of that composition and of your tragedies.

     "George Lambe meant to have written to you. If you don't like to
     confer with the managers at present, I will attend to your
     wishes--so state them. Yours very truly, BYRON."

[Footnote 84: Notwithstanding this precaution of the poet, the coincidence in question was,
but a few years after, triumphantly cited in support of the sweeping charge of plagiarism brought
against him by some scribblers. The following are Mr. Sotheby's lines:--

              "And I have leapt
    In transport from my flinty couch, to welcome
    The thunder as it burst upon my roof,
    And beckon'd to the lightning, as it flash'd
    And sparkled on these fetters."

I have since been informed by Mr. Sotheby that, though not published, these lines had been
written long before the appearance of Lord Byron's poem.]

     amused, I have no objection to be the theme of all the ballads he
     can find room for,--provided his lucubrations are confined to me
     only.

     "It is a long time since things of this kind have ceased to 'fright
     me from my propriety;' nor do I know any similar attack which would
     induce me to turn again,--unless it involved those connected with
     me, whose qualities, I hope, are such as to exempt them in the eyes
     of those who bear no good-will to myself. In such a case, supposing
     it to occur--to reverse the saying of Dr. Johnson,--'what the law
     could not do for me, I would do for myself,' be the consequences
     what they might.

     "I return you, with many thanks, Colman and the letters. The poems,
     I hope, you intended me to keep;--at least, I shall do so, till I
     hear the contrary. Very truly yours."

[Footnote 85: Mr. Taylor having inserted in the Sun newspaper (of which he was then chief proprietor)
a sonnet to Lord Byron, in return for a present which his Lordship had sent him of a handsomely
bound copy of all his works, there appeared in the same journal, on the following day (from
the pen of some person who had acquired a control over the paper), a parody upon this sonnet,
containing some disrespectful allusion to Lady Byron; and it is to this circumstance, which
Mr. Taylor had written to explain, that the above letter, so creditable to the feelings of
the noble husband, refers.]

     else from me, I assure you, and may think yourself lucky in having
     got rid of me, for good and all, without more damage. But I'll tell
     you what we will do for you,--act Sotheby's Ivan, which will
     succeed; and then your present and next impression of the dramas of
     that dramatic gentleman will be expedited to your heart's content;
     and if there is any thing very good, you shall have the refusal;
     but you sha'n't have any more requests.

     "Sotheby has got a thought, and almost the words, from the third
     Canto of The Corsair, which, you know, was published six months
     before his tragedy. It is from the storm in Conrad's cell. I have
     written to Mr. Sotheby to claim it; and, as Dennis roared out of
     the pit, 'By G----d, that's my thunder!' so do I, and will I,
     exclaim, 'By G----d that's my lightning!' that electrical fluid
     being, in fact, the subject of the said passage.

     "You will have a print of Fanny Kelly, in the Maid, to prefix,
     which is honestly worth twice the money you have given for the MS.

LETTER 227. TO MR. MOORE.

     "13. Terrace, Piccadilly, October 28. 1815.

     "You are, it seems, in England again, as I am to hear from every
     body but yourself; and I suppose you punctilious, because I did
     not answer your last Irish letter. When did you leave the 'swate
     country?' Never mind, I forgive you;--a strong proof of--I know not
     what--to give the lie to--

        'He never pardons who hath done the wrong.'

     "You have written to * *. You have also written to Perry, who
     intimates hope of an Opera from you. Coleridge has promised a
     Tragedy. Now, if you keep Perry's word, and Coleridge keeps his
     own, Drury Lane will be set up; and, sooth to say, it is in
     grievous want of such a lift. We began at speed, and are blown
     already. When I say 'we,' I mean Kinnaird, who is the 'all in all
     sufficient,' and can count, which none of the rest of the Committee
     can.

     "It is really very good fun, as far as the daily and nightly stir
     of these strutters and fretters go; and, if the concern could be
     brought to pay a shilling in the pound, would do much credit to the
     management. Mr. ---- has an accepted tragedy * * * * *, whose first
     scene is in his sleep (I don't mean the author's). It was forwarded
     to us as a prodigious favourite of Kean's; but the said Kean, upon
     interrogation, denies his eulogy, and protests against his part.
     How it will end, I know not.

     "I say so much about the theatre, because there is nothing else
     alive in London at this season. All the world are out of it, except
     us, who remain to lie in,--in December, or perhaps earlier. Lady B.
     is very ponderous and prosperous, apparently, and I wish it well
     over.

     "There is a play before me from a personage who signs himself
     'Hibernicus.' The hero is Malachi, the Irishman and king; and the
     villain and usurper, Turgesius, the Dane. The conclusion is fine.
     Turgesius is chained by the leg (vide stage direction) to a
     pillar on the stage; and King Malachi makes him a speech, not
     unlike Lord Castlereagh's about the balance of power and the
     lawfulness of legitimacy, which puts Turgesius into a frenzy--as
     Castlereagh's would, if his audience was chained by the leg. He
     draws a dagger and rushes at the orator; but, finding himself at
     the end of his tether, he sticks it into his own carcass, and dies,
     saying, he has fulfilled a prophecy.

     "Now, this is serious downright matter of fact, and the gravest
     part of a tragedy which is not intended for burlesque. I tell it
     you for the honour of Ireland. The writer hopes it will be
     represented:--but what is Hope? nothing but the paint on the face
     of Existence; the least touch of Truth rubs it off, and then we see
     what a hollow-cheeked harlot we have got hold of. I am not sure
     that I have not said this last superfine reflection before. But
     never mind;--it will do for the tragedy of Turgesius, to which I
     can append it.

     "Well, but how dost thou do? thou bard not of a thousand but three
     thousand! I wish your friend, Sir John Piano-forte, had kept that
     to himself, and not made it public at the trial of the song-seller
     in Dublin. I tell you why: it is a liberal thing for Longman to do,
     and honourable for you to obtain; but it will set all the 'hungry
     and dinnerless, lank-jawed judges' upon the fortunate author. But
     they be d----d!--the 'Jeffrey and the Moore together are confident
     against the world in ink!' By the way, if poor C * * e--who is a
     man of wonderful talent, and in distress[86], and about to publish
     two vols. of Poesy and Biography, and who has been worse used by
     the critics than ever we were--will you, if he comes out, promise
     me to review him favourably in the E.R.? Ever yours most affectionately, B.

     "P.S. This is a sad scribbler's letter; but the next shall be 'more
     of this world.'"

[Footnote 86: It is but justice both to "him that gave and him that took" to mention that the
noble poet, at this time, with a delicacy which enhanced the kindness, advanced to the eminent
person here spoken of, on the credit of some work he was about to produce, one hundred pounds.]

       *       *       *       *       *

As, after this letter, there occur but few allusions to his connection with the Drury Lane
Management, I shall here avail myself of the opportunity to give some extracts from his "Detached
Thoughts," containing recollections of his short acquaintance with the interior of the theatre.

"When I belonged to the Drury Lane Committee, and was one of the Sub-Committee of Management,
the number of plays upon the shelves were about five hundred. Conceiving that amongst these
there must be some of merit, in person and by proxy I caused an investigation. I do not think
that of those which I saw there was one which could be conscientiously tolerated. There never
were such things as most of them! Mathurin was very kindly recommended to me by Walter Scott,
to whom I had recourse, firstly, in the hope that he would do something for us himself; and,
secondly, in my despair, that he would point out to us any young (or old) writer of promise.
Mathurin sent his Bertram and a letter without his address, so that at first I could give him
no answer. When I at last hit upon his residence, I sent him a favourable answer and something
more substantial. His play succeeded; but I was at that time absent from England.

"I tried Coleridge too; but he had nothing feasible in hand at the time. Mr. Sotheby obligingly
offered all his tragedies, and I pledged myself, and notwithstanding many squabbles with my
Committed Brethren, did get 'Ivan' accepted, read, and the parts distributed. But, lo! in the
very heart of the matter, upon some tepidness on the part of Kean, or warmth on that of the
author, Sotheby withdrew his play. Sir J.B. Burgess did also present four tragedies and a farce,
and I moved green-room and Sub-Committee, but they would not.

"Then the scenes I had to go through!--the authors, and the authoresses, and the milliners,
and the wild Irishmen,--the people from Brighton, from Blackwall; from Chatham, from Cheltenham,
from Dublin, from Dundee,--who came in upon me! to all of whom it was proper to give a civil
answer, and a hearing, and a reading. Mrs. * * * *'s father, an Irish dancing-master of sixty
years, calling upon me to request to play Archer, dressed in silk stockings on a frosty morning
to show his legs (which were certainly good and Irish for his age, and had been still better,)--Miss
Emma Somebody, with a play entitled 'The Bandit of Bohemia,' or some such title or production,--Mr.
O'Higgins, then resident at Richmond, with an Irish tragedy, in which the unities could not
fail to be observed, for the protagonist was chained by the leg to a pillar during the chief
part of the performance. He was a wild man, of a salvage appearance, and the difficulty of
not laughing at him was only to be got over by reflecting upon the probable consequences of
such cachinnation.

"As I am really a civil and polite person, and do hate giving pain when it can be avoided,
I sent them up to Douglas Kinnaird,--who is a man of business, and sufficiently ready with
a negative,--and left them to settle with him; and as the beginning of next year I went abroad,
I have since been little aware of the progress of the theatres.

"Players are said to be an impracticable people. They are so; but I managed to steer clear
of any disputes with them, and excepting one debate[87] with the elder Byrne about Miss Smith's
pas de--(something--I forget the technicals,)--I do not remember any litigation of my own.
I used to protect Miss Smith, because she was like Lady Jane Harley in the face, and likenesses
go a great way with me. Indeed, in general, I left such things to my more bustling colleagues,
who used to reprove me seriously for not being able to take such things in hand without buffooning
with the histrions, or throwing things into confusion by treating light matters with levity.

"Then the Committee!--then the Sub-Committee!--we were but few, but never agreed. There was
Peter Moore who contradicted Kinnaird, and Kinnaird who contradicted every body: then our two
managers, Rae and Dibdin; and our secretary, Ward! and yet we were all very zealous and in
earnest to do good and so forth. * * * * furnished us with prologues to our revived old English
plays; but was not pleased with me for complimenting him as 'the Upton' of our theatre (Mr.
Upton is or was the poet who writes the songs for Astley's), and almost gave up prologuing
in consequence.

"In the pantomime of 1815-16 there was a representation of the masquerade of 1814 given by
'us youth' of Watier's Club to Wellington and Co. Douglas Kinnaird and one or two others, with
myself, put on masks, and went on the stage with the [Greek: hoi polloi], to see the effect
of a theatre from the stage:--it is very grand. Douglas danced among the figuranti too, and
they were puzzled to find out who we were, as being more than their number. It was odd enough
that Douglas Kinnaird and I should have been both at the real masquerade, and afterwards in
the mimic one of the same, on the stage of Drury Lane theatre."

[Footnote 87: A correspondent of one of the monthly Miscellanies gives the following account
of this incident:--

"During Lord Byron's administration, a ballet was invented by the elder Byrne, in which Miss
Smith (since Mrs. Oscar Byrne) had a pas seul. This the lady wished to remove to a later period
in the ballet. The ballet-master refused, and the lady swore she would not dance it at all.
The music incidental to the dance began to play, and the lady walked off the stage. Both parties
flounced into the green-room to lay the case before Lord Byron, who happened to be the only
person in that apartment. The noble committee-man made an award in favour of Miss Smith, and
both complainants rushed angrily out of the room at the instant of my entering it. 'If you
had come a minute sooner,' said Lord Byron, 'you would have heard a curious matter decided
on by me: a question of dancing!--by me,' added he, looking down at the lame limb, 'whom Nature
from my birth has prohibited from taking a single step.' His countenance fell after he had
uttered this, as if he had said too much; and for a moment there was an embarrassing silence
on both sides."]

     "I have not been able to ascertain precisely the time of duration
     of the stock market; but I believe it is a good time for selling
     out, and I hope so. First, because I shall see you; and, next,
     because I shall receive certain monies on behalf of Lady B., the
     which will materially conduce to my comfort,--I wanting (as the
     duns say) 'to make up a sum.'

     "Yesterday, I dined out with a large-ish party, where were Sheridan
     and Colman, Harry Harris of C. G, and his brother, Sir Gilbert
     Heathcote, Ds. Kinnaird, and others, of note and notoriety. Like
     other parties of the kind, it was first silent, then talky, then
     argumentative, then disputatious, then unintelligible, then
     altogethery, then inarticulate, and then drunk. When we had reached
     the last step of this glorious ladder, it was difficult to get down
     again without stumbling; and to crown all, Kinnaird and I had to
     conduct Sheridan down a d----d corkscrew staircase, which had
     certainly been constructed before the discovery of fermented
     liquors, and to which no legs, however crooked, could possibly
     accommodate themselves. We deposited him safe at home, where his
     man, evidently used to the business, waited to receive him in the
     hall.

     "Both he and Colman were, as usual, very good; but I carried away
     much wine, and the wine had previously carried away my memory; so
     that all was hiccup and happiness for the last hour or so, and I am
     not impregnated with any of the conversation. Perhaps you heard of
     a late answer of Sheridan to the watchman who found him bereft of
     that 'divine particle of air,' called reason, * * *. He, the
     watchman, who found Sherry in the street, fuddled and bewildered,
     and almost insensible. 'Who are you, sir? '--no answer. 'What's
     your name?'--a hiccup. 'What's your name?'--Answer, in a slow,
     deliberate and impassive tone--'Wilberforce!!!' Is not that Sherry
     all over?--and, to my mind, excellent. Poor fellow, his very
     dregs are better than the 'first sprightly runnings' of others.

     leavened with London to keep long out of it.

     tears in my eyes, it is so hot. We have had a devil of a row
     among our ballerinas. Miss Smith has been wronged about a hornpipe.

     Tom--eh, when art thou out? If you think the verses worth it, I

Those embarrassments which, from a review of his affairs previous to the marriage, he had clearly
foreseen would, before long, overtake him, were not slow in realising his worst omens. The
increased expenses induced by his new mode of life, with but very little increase of means
to meet them,--the long arrears of early pecuniary obligations, as well as the claims which
had been, gradually, since then, accumulating, all pressed upon him now with collected force,
and reduced him to some of the worst humiliations of poverty. He had been even driven, by the
necessity of encountering such demands, to the trying expedient of parting with his books,--which
circumstance coming to Mr. Murray's ears, that gentleman instantly forwarded to him 1500l.,
with an assurance that another sum of the same amount should be at his service in a few weeks,
and that if such assistance should not be sufficient, Mr. Murray was most ready to dispose
of the copyrights of all his past works for his use.

This very liberal offer Lord Byron acknowledged in the following letter:--

     intention, I can assure you I would have asked you fairly, and as
     freely as you would give; and I cannot say more of my confidence or
     your conduct.

     "The circumstances which induce me to part with my books, though
     sufficiently, are not immediately, pressing. I have made up my
     mind to them, and there's an end.

     would have been before now; but I am not sorry to have an
     opportunity of declining it, as it sets my opinion of you, and

     have been accustomed to consider it.

The following are the lines alluded to in this note. They are written in the loosest form of
that rambling style of metre which his admiration of Mr. Coleridge's "Christabel" led him,
at this time, to adopt; and he judged rightly, perhaps, in omitting them as the opening of
his poem. They are, however, too full of spirit and character to be lost. Though breathing
the thick atmosphere of Piccadilly when he wrote them, it is plain that his fancy was far away,
among the sunny hills and vales of Greece; and their contrast with the tame life he was leading
at the moment, but gave to his recollections a fresher spring and force.

    "In the year since Jesus died for men,
    Eighteen hundred years and ten,
    We were a gallant company,
    Riding o'er land, and sailing o'er sea.
    Oh! but we went merrily!
    We forded the river, and clomb the high hill,
    Never our steeds for a day stood still;
    Whether we lay in the cave or the shed,
    Our sleep fell soft on the hardest bed;
    Whether we couch'd in our rough capote,
    On the rougher plank of our gliding boat,
    Or stretch'd on the beach, or our saddles spread
    As a pillow beneath the resting head,
    Fresh we woke upon the morrow:
      All our thoughts and words had scope,
      We had health, and we had hope,
    Toil and travel, but no sorrow.
    We were of all tongues and creeds;--
    Some were those who counted beads,
    Some of mosque, and some of church,
      And some, or I mis-say, of neither;
    Yet through the wide world might ye search
      Nor find a mother crew nor blither.

    "But some are dead, and some are gone,
    And some are scatter'd and alone,
    And some are rebels on the hills[89]
      That look along Epirus' valleys
      Where Freedom still at moments rallies,
    And pays in blood Oppression's ills:
      And some are in a far countree,
    And some all restlessly at home;
      But never more, oh! never, we
    Shall meet to revel and to roam.
    But those hardy days flew cheerily;
    And when they now fall drearily,
    My thoughts, like swallows, skim the main
    And bear my spirit back again
    Over the earth, and through the air,
    A wild bird, and a wanderer.
    'Tis this that ever wakes my strain,
    And oft, too oft, implores again
    The few who may endure my lay,
    To follow me so far away.

    "Stranger--wilt thou follow now,
    And sit with me on Acro-Corinth's brow?"

me) state him to be in revolt upon the mountains, at the head of some of the bands common in

LETTER 232. TO MR. MOORE.

     "January 5. 1816.

     "I hope Mrs. M. is quite re-established. The little girl was born
     on the 10th of December last; her name is Augusta Ada (the second
     a very antique family name,--I believe not used since the reign of
     King John). She was, and is, very flourishing and fat, and reckoned
     very large for her days--squalls and sucks incessantly. Are you
     answered? Her mother is doing very well, and up again.

     "I have now been married a year on the second of this
     month--heigh-ho! I have seen nobody lately much worth noting,
     except S * * and another general of the Gauls, once or twice at
     dinners out of doors. S * * is a fine, foreign, villanous-looking,
     intelligent, and very agreeable man; his compatriot is more of the
     petit-maître, and younger, but I should think not at all of the
     same intellectual calibre with the Corsican--which S * *, you know,
     is, and a cousin of Napoleon's.

     "Are you never to be expected in town again? To be sure, there is
     no one here of the 1500 fillers of hot-rooms, called the
     fashionable world. My approaching papa-ship detained us for advice,
     &c. &c. though I would as soon be here as any where else on this
     side of the Straits of Gibraltar.

     "I would gladly--or, rather, sorrowfully--comply with your request
     of a dirge for the poor girl you mention.[90] But how can I write
     on one I have never seen or known? Besides, you will do it much
     better yourself. I could not write upon any thing, without some
     personal experience and foundation; far less on a theme so
     peculiar. Now, you have both in this case; and, if you had neither,
     you have more imagination, and would never fail.

     "This is but a dull scrawl, and I am but a dull fellow. Just at
     present, I am absorbed in 500 contradictory contemplations, though
     with but one object in view--which will probably end in nothing, as
     most things we wish do.

     "Ever," &c.

[Footnote 90: I had mentioned to him, as a subject worthy of his best powers of pathos, a melancholy
event which had just occurred in my neighbourhood, and to which I have myself made allusion
in one of the Sacred Melodies--"Weep not for her."]

       *       *       *       *       *

On reading over the foregoing letter, I was much struck by the tone of melancholy that pervaded
it; and well knowing it to be the habit of the writer's mind to seek relief, when under the
pressure of any disquiet or disgust, in that sense of freedom which told him that there were
homes for him elsewhere, I could perceive, I thought, in his recollections of the "blue Olympus,"
some return of the restless and roving spirit, which unhappiness or impatience always called
up in his mind. I had, indeed, at the time when he sent me those melancholy verses, "There's
not a joy this world can give," &c. felt some vague apprehensions as to the mood into which
his spirits then seemed to be sinking, and, in acknowledging the receipt of the verses, thus
tried to banter him out of it:--"But why thus on your stool of melancholy again, Master Stephen?--This
will never do--it plays the deuce with all the matter-of-fact duties of life, and you must
bid adieu to it. Youth is the only time when one can be melancholy with impunity. As life itself
grows sad and serious we have nothing for it but--to be as much as possible the contrary."

My absence from London during the whole of this year had deprived me of all opportunities of
judging for myself how far the appearances of his domestic state gave promise of happiness;
nor had any rumours reached me which at all inclined me to suspect that the course of his married
life hitherto exhibited less smoothness than such unions,--on the surface, at least,--generally
wear. The strong and affectionate terms in which, soon after the marriage, he had, in some
of the letters I have given, declared his own happiness--a declaration which his known frankness
left me no room to question--had, in no small degree, tended to still those apprehensions which
my first view of the lot he had chosen for himself awakened.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was in a few weeks after this latter communication between us that Lady Byron adopted the
resolution of parting from him. At the time when he had to stand this unexpected shock, his
pecuniary embarrassments, which had been fast gathering around him during the whole of the
last year (there having been no less than eight or nine executions in his house within that
period), had arrived at their utmost; and at a moment when, to use his own strong expressions,
he was "standing alone on his hearth, with his household gods shivered around him," he was
also doomed to receive the startling intelligence that the wife who had just parted with him
in kindness, had parted with him--for ever.

About this time the following note was written:--

TO MR. ROGERS.

     "February 8. 1816.

     "Do not mistake me--I really returned your book for the reason
     assigned, and no other. It is too good for so careless a fellow. Ever yours,

     "BN."

       *       *       *       *       *

The rumours of the separation did not reach me till more than a week afterwards, when I immediately
wrote to him thus:--"I am most anxious to hear from you, though I doubt whether I ought to
mention the subject on which I am so anxious. If, however, what I heard last night, in a letter
from town, be true, you will know immediately what I allude to, and just communicate as much
or as little upon the subject as you think proper;--only something I should like to know, as
soon as possible, from yourself, in order to set my mind at rest with respect to the truth
or falsehood of the report." The following is his answer:--

LETTER 233. TO MR. MOORE.

     "February 29. 1816.

     "I have not answered your letter for a time; and, at present, the
     reply to part of it might extend to such a length, that I shall
     delay it till it can be made in person, and then I will shorten it
     as much as I can.

     "In the mean time, I am at war 'with all the world and his wife;'
     or rather, 'all the world and my wife' are at war with me, and
     have not yet crushed me,--whatever they may do. I have but a very short answer for those whom it
     concerns; and all the activity of myself and some vigorous friends
     have not yet fixed on any tangible ground or personage, on which or
     with whom I can discuss matters, in a summary way, with a fair
     pretext;--though I nearly had nailed one yesterday, but he evaded
     by--what was judged by others--a satisfactory explanation. I speak
     of circulators--against whom I have no enmity, though I must act
     according to the common code of usage, when I hit upon those of the
     serious order.

     "Now for other matters--poesy, for instance. Leigh Hunt's poem is a
     devilish good one--quaint, here and there, but with the substratum
     of originality, and with poetry about it, that will stand the test.
     I do not say this because he has inscribed it to me, which I am
     sorry for, as I should otherwise have begged you to review it in
     the Edinburgh.[91] It is really deserving of much praise, and a
     favourable critique in the E.R. would but do it justice, and set it
     up before the public eye where it ought to be.

     "How are you? and where? I have not the most distant idea what I am
     going to do myself, or with myself--or where--or what. I had, a few
     weeks ago, some things to say that would have made you laugh; but
     they tell me now that I must not laugh, and so I have been very
     serious--and am.

     "I have not been very well--with a liver complaint--but am much
     better within the last fortnight, though still under Iatrical
     advice. I have latterly seen a little of * * * *

     "I must go and dress to dine. My little girl is in the country,
     and, they tell me, is a very fine child, and now nearly three
     months old. Lady Noel (my mother-in-law, or, rather, at law) is
     at present overlooking it. Her daughter (Miss Milbanke that was)
     is, I believe, in London with her father.

     "In all this business, I am the sorriest for Sir Ralph. He and I
     are equally punished, though magis pares quam similes in our
     affliction. Yet it is hard for both to suffer for the fault of one,
     and so it is--I shall be separated from my wife; he will retain
     his.

     "Ever," &c.

[Footnote 91: My reply to this part of his letter was, I find, as follows:--"With respect to
Hunt's poem, though it is, I own, full of beauties, and though I like himself sincerely, I
really could not undertake to praise it seriously. There is so much of the quizzible in all
he writes, that I never can put on the proper pathetic face in reading him."]

       *       *       *       *       *

In my reply to this letter, written a few days after, there is a passage which (though containing
an opinion it might have been more prudent, perhaps, to conceal,) I feel myself called upon
to extract on account of the singularly generous avowal,--honourable alike to both the parties
in this unhappy affair,--which it was the means of drawing from Lord Byron. The following are
my words:--"I am much in the same state as yourself with respect to the subject of your letter,
my mind being so full of things which I don't know how to write about, that I too must defer
the greater part of them till we meet in May, when I shall put you fairly on your trial for
all crimes and misdemeanors. In the mean time, you will not be at a loss for judges, nor executioners
either, if they could have their will. The world, in their generous ardour to take what they
call the weaker side, soon contrive to make it most formidably the strongest. Most sincerely
do I grieve at what has happened. It has upset all my wishes and theories as to the influence
of marriage on your life; for, instead of bringing you, as I expected, into something like
a regular orbit, it has only cast you off again into infinite space, and left you, I fear,
in a far worse state than it found you. As to defending you, the only person with whom I have
yet attempted this task is myself; and, considering the little I know upon the subject, (or
rather, perhaps, owing to this cause,) I have hitherto done it with very tolerable success.
After all, your choice was the misfortune. I never liked,--but I'm here wandering into the
[Greek: aporrêta], and so must change the subject for a far pleasanter one, your last new poems,
which," &c. &c.

The return of post brought me the following answer, which, while it raises our admiration of
the generous candour of the writer, but adds to the sadness and strangeness of the whole transaction.

       *       *       *       *       *

LETTER 234. TO MR. MOORE.

     "March 8. 1816.

     "I rejoice in your promotion as Chairman and Charitable Steward,
     &c. &c. These be dignities which await only the virtuous. But then,
     recollect you are six and thirty, (I speak this enviously--not
     of your age, but the 'honour--love--obedience--troops of friends,'
     which accompany it,) and I have eight years good to run before I
     arrive at such hoary perfection; by which time,--if I am at
     all[92],--it will probably be in a state of grace or progressing
     merits.

     "I must set you right in one point, however. The fault was
     not--no, nor even the misfortune--in my 'choice' (unless in
     choosing at all)--for I do not believe--and I must say it, in the
     very dregs of all this bitter business--that there ever was a
     better, or even a brighter, a kinder, or a more amiable and
     agreeable being than Lady B. I never had, nor can have, any
     reproach to make her, while with me. Where there is blame, it
     belongs to myself, and, if I cannot redeem, I must bear it.

     "Her nearest relatives are a * * * *--my circumstances have been
     and are in a state of great confusion--my health has been a good
     deal disordered, and my mind ill at ease for a considerable period.
     Such are the causes (I do not name them as excuses) which have
     frequently driven me into excess, and disqualified my temper for
     comfort. Something also may be attributed to the strange and
     desultory habits which, becoming my own master at an early age, and
     scrambling about, over and through the world, may have induced. I
     still, however, think that, if I had had a fair chance, by being
     placed in even a tolerable situation, I might have gone on fairly.
     But that seems hopeless,--and there is nothing more to be said. At
     present--except my health, which is better (it is odd, but
     agitation or contest of any kind gives a rebound to my spirits and
     sets me up for the time)--I have to battle with all kinds of
     unpleasantnesses, including private and pecuniary difficulties, &c.
     &c.

     "I believe I may have said this before to you, but I risk repeating
     it.

     "I agree with you (to turn from this topic to our shop) that I
     have written too much. The last things were, however, published
     very reluctantly by me, and for reasons I will explain when we
     meet. I know not why I have dwelt so much on the same scenes,
     except that I find them fading, or confusing (if such a word may
     be) in my memory, in the midst of present turbulence and pressure,
     and I felt anxious to stamp before the die was worn out. I now
     break it. With those countries, and events connected with them, all
     my really poetical feelings begin and end. Were I to try, I could
     make nothing of any other subject, and that I have apparently
     exhausted. 'Wo to him,' says Voltaire, 'who says all he could say
     on any subject.' There are some on which, perhaps, I could have
     said still more: but I leave them all, and too soon.

     "Do you remember the lines I sent you early last year, which you
     still have? I don't wish (like Mr. Fitzgerald, in the Morning Post)
     to claim the character of 'Vates' in all its translations, but were
     they not a little prophetic? I mean those beginning, 'There's not a
     joy the world can,' &c. &c., on which I rather pique myself as
     being the truest, though the most melancholy, I ever wrote.

     "What a scrawl have I sent you! You say nothing of yourself, except
     that you are a Lancasterian churchwarden, and an encourager of
     mendicants. When are you out? and how is your family? My child is
     very well and flourishing, I hear; but I must see also. I feel no
     disposition to resign it to the contagion of its grandmother's
     society, though I am unwilling to take it from the mother. It is
     weaned, however, and something about it must be decided. Ever," &c.

[Footnote 92: This sad doubt,--"if I am at all,"--becomes no less singular than sad when we
recollect that six and thirty was actually the age when he ceased to "be," and at a moment,
too, when (as even the least friendly to him allow) he was in that state of "progressing merits"
which he here jestingly anticipates.]

       *       *       *       *       *

Having already gone so far in laying open to my readers some of the sentiments which I entertained,
respecting Lord Byron's marriage, at a time when, little foreseeing that I should ever become
his biographer, I was, of course, uninfluenced by the peculiar bias supposed to belong to that
task, it may still further, perhaps, be permitted me to extract from my reply to the foregoing
letter some sentences of explanation which its contents seemed to me to require. I have already,
in some observations on the general character of men of genius, endeavoured to point out those
peculiarities, both in disposition and habitudes, by which, in the far greater number of instances,
they have been found unfitted for domestic happiness. Of these defects, (which are, as it were,
the shadow that genius casts, and too generally, it is to be feared, in proportion to its stature,)
Lord Byron could not, of course, fail to have inherited his share, in common with all the painfully-gifted
class to which he belonged. How thoroughly, with respect to one attribute of this temperament
which he possessed,--one, that "sicklies o'er" the face of happiness itself,--he was understood
by the person most interested in observing him, will appear from the following anecdote, as
related by himself.[94]

"People have wondered at the melancholy which runs through my writings. Others have wondered
at my personal gaiety. But I recollect once, after an hour in which I had been sincerely and
particularly gay and rather brilliant, in company, my wife replying to me when I said (upon
her remarking my high spirits), 'And yet, Bell, I have been called and miscalled melancholy--you
must have seen how falsely, frequently?'--'No, Byron,' she answered, 'it is not so: at heart
you are the most melancholy of mankind; and often when apparently gayest.'" Among the few attempts
made by himself towards confuting his calumniators was an appeal (such as the following short
letter contains) to some of those persons with whom he had been in the habit of living familiarly.

[Footnote 94: MS.--"Detached Thoughts."]

[Footnote 95: An anecdote connected with one of these occasions is thus related in the Journal
just referred to:--

"When the bailiff (for I have seen most kinds of life) came upon me in 1815 to seize my chattels,
(being a peer of parliament, my person was beyond him,) being curious (as is my habit), I first
asked him "what extents elsewhere he had for government?" upon which he showed me one upon
one house only for seventy thousand pounds! Next I asked him if he had nothing for Sheridan?
"Oh--Sheridan!" said he; "ay, I have this" (pulling out a pocket-book, &c.); "but, my Lord,
I have been in Sheridan's house a twelvemonth at a time--a civil gentleman--knows how to deal
with us," &c. &c. &c. Our own business was then discussed, which was none of the easiest for
me at that time. But the man was civil, and (what I valued more) communicative. I had met many
of his brethren, years before, in affairs of my friends, (commoners, that is,) but this was
the first (or second) on my own account.--A civil man; fee'd accordingly; probably he anticipated
as much."]

[Footnote 96: For this story, however, there was so far a foundation that the practice to which
he had accustomed himself from boyhood, of having loaded pistols always near him at night,
was considered so strange a propensity as to be included in that list of symptoms (sixteen,
I believe, in number,) which were submitted to medical opinion, in proof of his insanity. Another
symptom was the emotion, almost to hysterics, which he had exhibited on seeing Kean act Sir
Giles Overreach. But the most plausible of all the grounds, as he himself used to allow, on
which these articles of impeachment against his sanity were drawn up, was an act of violence
committed by him on a favourite old watch that had been his companion from boyhood, and had
gone with him to Greece. In a fit of vexation and rage, brought on by some of those humiliating
embarrassments to which he was now almost daily a prey, he furiously dashed this watch upon
the hearth, and ground it to pieces among the ashes with the poker.]

[Footnote 97: Of the abuse lavished upon him, the following extract from a poem, published
at this time, will give some idea:--

    "From native England, that endured too long
    The ceaseless burden of his impious song;
    His mad career of crimes and follies run,
    And grey in vice, when life was scarce begun;
    He goes, in foreign lands prepared to find
    A life more suited to his guilty mind;
    Where other climes new pleasures may supply
    For that pall'd taste, and that unhallow'd eye;--
    Wisely he seeks some yet untrodden shore,
    For those who know him less may prize him more."

In a rhyming pamphlet, too, entitled "A Poetical Epistle from Delia, addressed to Lord Byron,"
the writer thus charitably expresses herself:--

    "Hopeless of peace below, and, shuddering thought!
    Far from that Heav'n, denied, if never sought,
    Thy light a beacon--a reproach thy name--
    Thy memory "damn'd to everlasting fame,"
    Shunn'd by the wise, admired by fools alone--
    The good shall mourn thee--and the Muse disown."

LETTER 235. TO MR. ROGERS.

     "B."

       *       *       *       *       *

In those Memoirs (or, more properly, Memoranda,) of the noble poet, which it was thought expedient,
for various reasons, to sacrifice, he gave a detailed account of all the circumstances connected
with his marriage, from the first proposal to the lady till his own departure, after the breach,
from England. In truth, though the title of "Memoirs," which he himself sometimes gave to that
manuscript, conveys the idea of a complete and regular piece of biography, it was to this particular
portion of his life that the work was principally devoted; while the anecdotes, having reference
to other parts of his career, not only occupied a very disproportionate space in its pages,
but were most of them such as are found repeated in the various Journals and other MSS. he
left behind. The chief charm, indeed, of that narrative, was the melancholy playfulness--melancholy,
from the wounded feeling so visible through its pleasantry--with which events unimportant and
persons uninteresting, in almost every respect but their connection with such a man's destiny,
were detailed and described in it. Frank, as usual, throughout, in his avowal of his own errors,
and generously just towards her who was his fellow-sufferer in the strife, the impression his
recital left on the minds of all who perused it was, to say the least, favourable to him;--though,
upon the whole, leading to a persuasion, which I have already intimated to be my own, that,
neither in kind nor degree, did the causes of disunion between the parties much differ from
those that loosen the links of most such marriages.

With respect to the details themselves, though all important in his own eyes at the time, as
being connected with the subject that superseded most others in his thoughts, the interest
they would possess for others, now that their first zest as a subject of scandal is gone by,
and the greater number of the persons to whom they relate forgotten, would be too slight to
justify me in entering upon them more particularly, or running the risk of any offence that
might be inflicted by their disclosure. As far as the character of the illustrious subject
of these pages is concerned, I feel that Time and Justice are doing far more in its favour
than could be effected by any such gossiping details. During the lifetime of a man of genius,
the world is but too much inclined to judge of him rather by what he wants than by what he
possesses, and even where conscious, as in the present case, that his defects are among the
sources of his greatness, to require of him unreasonably the one without the other. If Pope
had not been splenetic and irritable, we should have wanted his Satires; and an impetuous temperament,
and passions untamed, were indispensable to the conformation of a poet like Byron. It is by
posterity only that full justice is rendered to those who have paid such hard penalties to
reach it. The dross that had once hung about the ore drops away, and the infirmities, and even
miseries, of genius are forgotten in its greatness. Who now asks whether Dante was right or
wrong in his matrimonial differences? or by how many of those whose fancies dwell fondly on
his Beatrice is even the name of his Gemma Donati remembered?

Already, short as has been the interval since Lord Byron's death, the charitable influence
of time in softening, if not rescinding, the harsh judgments of the world against genius is
visible. The utter unreasonableness of trying such a character by ordinary standards, or of
expecting to find the materials of order and happiness in a bosom constantly heaving forth
from its depths such "lava floods," is--now that big spirit has passed from among us--felt
and acknowledged. In reviewing the circumstances of his marriage, a more even scale of justice
is held; and while every tribute of sympathy and commiseration is accorded to her, who, unluckily
for her own peace, became involved in such a destiny,--who, with virtues and attainments that
would have made the home of a more ordinary man happy, undertook, in evil hour, to "turn and
wind a fiery Pegasus," and but failed where it may be doubted whether even the fittest for
such a task would have succeeded,--full allowance is, at the same time, made for the great
martyr of genius himself, whom so many other causes, beside that restless fire within him,
concurred to unsettle in mind and (as he himself feelingly expresses it) "disqualify for comfort;"--whose
doom it was to be either thus or less great, and whom to have tamed might have been to extinguish;
there never, perhaps, having existed an individual to whom, whether as author or man, the following
line was more applicable:--

    "Si non errâsset, fecerat ille minus."[98]

While these events were going on,--events, of which his memory and heart bore painfully the
traces through the remainder of his short life,--some occurrences took place, connected with
his literary history, to which it is a relief to divert the attention of the reader from the
distressing subject that has now so long detained us.

The letter that follows was in answer to one received from Mr. Murray, in which that gentleman
had enclosed him a draft for a thousand guineas for the copyright of his two poems, The Siege
of Corinth and Parisina:--

       *       *       *       *       *

LETTER 236. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "January 3. 1816.

     "Your offer is liberal in the extreme, (you see I use the word
     to you and of you, though I would not consent to your using it
     of yourself to Mr. * * * *,) and much more than the two poems can
     possibly be worth; but I cannot accept it, nor will not. You are
     most welcome to them as additions to the collected volumes, without
     any demand or expectation on my part whatever. But I cannot consent
     to their separate publication. I do not like to risk any fame
     (whether merited or not), which I have been favoured with, upon
     compositions which I do not feel to be at all equal to my own
     notions of what they should be, (and as I flatter myself some have
     been, here and there,) though they may do very well as things
     without pretension, to add to the publication with the lighter
     pieces.

     "I am very glad that the handwriting was a favourable omen of the
     morale of the piece: but you must not trust to that, for my
     copyist would write out any thing I desired in all the ignorance of
     innocence--I hope, however, in this instance, with no great peril
     to either.

     "P.S. I have enclosed your draft torn, for fear of accidents by
     the way--I wish you would not throw temptation in mine. It is not
     from a disdain of the universal idol, nor from a present
     superfluity of his treasures, I can assure you, that I refuse to
     worship him; but what is right is right, and must not yield to
     circumstances."

[Footnote 98: Had he not erred, he had far less achieved.]

       *       *       *       *       *

Notwithstanding the ruinous state of his pecuniary affairs, the resolution which the poet had
formed not to avail himself of the profits of his works still continued to be held sacred by
him; and the sum thus offered for the copyright of The Siege of Corinth and Parisina was, as
we see, refused and left untouched in the publisher's hands. It happened that, at this time,
a well-known and eminent writer on political science had been, by some misfortune, reduced
to pecuniary embarrassment; and the circumstance having become known to Mr. Rogers and Sir
James Mackintosh, it occurred to them that a part of the sum thus unappropriated by Lord Byron
could not be better bestowed than in relieving the necessities of this gentleman. The suggestion
was no sooner conveyed to the noble poet than he proceeded to act upon it; and the following
letter to Mr. Rogers refers to his intentions:--

LETTER 237. TO MR. ROGERS.

     "February 20. 1816.

     "I wrote to you hastily this morning by Murray, to say that I was
     glad to do as Mackintosh and you suggested about Mr. * *. It occurs
     to me now, that as I have never seen Mr. * * but once, and
     consequently have no claim to his acquaintance, that you or Sir J.
     had better arrange it with him in such a manner as may be least
     offensive to his feelings, and so as not to have the appearance of
     officiousness nor obtrusion on my part. I hope you will be able to
     do this, as I should be very sorry to do any thing by him that may
     be deemed indelicate. The sum Murray offered and offers was and is
     one thousand and fifty pounds:--this I refused before, because I
     thought it more than the two things were worth to Murray, and from
     other objections, which are of no consequence. I have, however,
     closed with M., in consequence of Sir J.'s and your suggestion, and
     propose the sum of six hundred pounds to be transferred to Mr. * *
     in such a manner as may seem best to your friend,--the remainder I
     think of for other purposes.

     "As Murray has offered the money down for the copyrights, it may be
     done directly. I am ready to sign and seal immediately, and
     perhaps it had better not be delayed. I shall feel very glad if it
     can be of any use to * *; only don't let him be plagued, nor think
     himself obliged and all that, which makes people hate one another,
     &c. Yours, very truly,

     "B."

       *       *       *       *       *

In his mention here of other "purposes," he refers to an intention which he had of dividing
the residue of the sum between two other gentlemen of literary Celebrity, equally in want of
such aid, Mr. Maturin and Mr. * *. The whole design, however, though entered into with the
utmost sincerity on the part of the noble poet, ultimately failed. Mr. Murray, who was well
acquainted with the straits to which Lord Byron himself had been reduced, and foresaw that
a time might come when even money thus gained would be welcome to him, on learning the uses
to which the sum was to be applied, demurred in advancing it,--alleging that, though bound
not only by his word but his will to pay the amount to Lord Byron, he did not conceive himself
called upon to part with it to others. How earnestly the noble poet himself, though with executions,
at the time, impending over his head, endeavoured to urge the point, will appear from the following
letter:--

LETTER 238. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "February 22. 1815.

     "When the sum offered by you, and even pressed by you, was
     declined, it was with reference to a separate publication, as you
     know and I know. That it was large, I admitted and admit; and
     that made part of my consideration in refusing it, till I knew
     better what you were likely to make of it. With regard to what is
     past, or is to pass, about Mr. M * *, the case is in no respect
     different from the transfer of former copyrights to Mr. Dallas. Had
     I taken you at your word, that is, taken your money, I might have
     used it as I pleased; and it could be in no respect different to
     you whether I paid it to a w----, or a hospital, or assisted a man
     of talent in distress. The truth of the matter seems this: you
     offered more than the poems are worth. I said so, and I think
     so; but you know, or at least ought to know, your own business
     best; and when you recollect what passed between you and me upon
     pecuniary subjects before this occurred, you will acquit me of any
     wish to take advantage of your imprudence.

     "The things in question shall not be published at all, and there is
     an end of the matter.

The letter that follows will give some idea of those embarrassments in his own affairs, under
the pressure of which he could be thus considerate of the wants of others.

LETTER 239. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "March 6. 1816.

     "I sent to you to-day for this reason--the books you purchased are
     again seized, and, as matters stand, had much better be sold at
     once by public auction.[99] I wish to see you to return your bill
     for them, which, thank God, is neither due nor paid. That part,
     as far as you are concerned, being settled, (which it can be, and
     shall be, when I see you to-morrow,) I have no further delicacy
     about the matter. This is about the tenth execution in as many
     months; so I am pretty well hardened; but it is fit I should pay
     the forfeit of my forefathers' extravagance and my own; and
     whatever my faults may be, I suppose they will be pretty well
     expiated in time--or eternity. Ever, &c.

     "P.S. I need hardly say that I knew nothing till this day of the
     new seizure. I had released them from former ones, and thought,
     when you took them, that they were yours.

     "You shall have your bill again to-morrow."

[Footnote 99: The sale of these books took place the following month, and they were described
in the catalogue as the property of "a Nobleman about to leave England on a tour."

From a note to Mr. Murray, it would appear that he had been first announced as going to the Morea.

"I hope that the catalogue of the books, &c., has not been published without my seeing it.
I must reserve several, and many ought not to be printed. The advertisement is a very bad one.
I am not going to the Morea; and if I was, you might as well advertise a man in Russia as going
to Yorkshire.--Ever," &c.

Together with the books was sold an article of furniture, which is now in the possession of
Mr. Murray, namely, "a large screen covered with portraits of actors, pugilists, representations
of boxing-matches," &c.]

During the month of January and part of February, his poems of The Siege of Corinth and Parisina
were in the hands of the printers, and about the end of the latter month made their appearance.
The following letters are the only ones I find connected with their publication.

LETTER 240. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "February 3. 1816.

     "I sent for 'Marmion,' which I return, because it occurred to me,
     there might be a resemblance between part of 'Parisina' and a
     similar scene in Canto 2d of 'Marmion.' I fear there is, though I
     never thought of it before, and could hardly wish to imitate that
     which is inimitable. I wish you would ask Mr. Gifford whether I
     ought to say any thing upon it;--I had completed the story on the
     passage from Gibbon, which indeed leads to a like scene naturally,
     without a thought of the kind: but it comes upon me not very
     comfortably.

     "There are a few words and phrases I want to alter in the MS., and
     should like to do it before you print, and will return it in an
     hour.

     "Yours ever."

LETTER 241. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "February 20. 1816.

     "To return to our business--your epistles are vastly agreeable.
     With regard to the observations on carelessness, &c. I think, with
     all humility, that the gentle reader has considered a rather
     uncommon, and designedly irregular, versification for haste and
     negligence. The measure is not that of any of the other poems,
     which (I believe) were allowed to be tolerably correct, according
     to Byshe and the fingers--or ears--by which bards write, and
     readers reckon. Great part of 'The Siege' is in (I think) what the
     learned call Anapests, (though I am not sure, being heinously
     forgetful of my metres and my 'Gradus',) and many of the lines
     intentionally longer or shorter than its rhyming companion; and
     rhyme also occurring at greater or less intervals of caprice or
     convenience.

     "I mean not to say that this is right or good, but merely that I
     could have been smoother, had it appeared to me of advantage; and
     that I was not otherwise without being aware of the deviation,
     though I now feel sorry for it, as I would undoubtedly rather
     please than not. My wish has been to try at something different
     from my former efforts; as I endeavoured to make them differ from
     each other. The versification of 'The Corsair' is not that of
     'Lara;' nor 'The Giaour' that of 'The Bride;' Childe Harold is
     again varied from these; and I strove to vary the last somewhat
     from all of the others.

     "Excuse all this d----d nonsense and egotism. The fact is, that I
     am rather trying to think on the subject of this note, than really
     thinking on it.--I did not know you had called: you are always
     admitted and welcome when you choose.

     "I am sorry for Sotheby's row. What the devil is it about? I
     thought it all settled; and if I can do any thing about him or Ivan
     still, I am ready and willing. I do not think it proper for me just
     now to be much behind the scenes, but I will see the committee and
     move upon it, if Sotheby likes.

     "If you see Mr. Sotheby, will you tell him that I wrote to Mr.
     Coleridge, on getting Mr. Sotheby's note, and have, I hope, done
     what Mr. S. wished on that subject?"

       *       *       *       *       *

It was about the middle of April that his two celebrated copies of verses, "Fare thee well,"
and "A Sketch," made their appearance in the newspapers:--and while the latter poem was generally
and, it must be owned, justly condemned, as a sort of literary assault on an obscure female,
whose situation ought to have placed her as much beneath his satire as the undignified mode
of his attack certainly raised her above it, with regard to the other poem, opinions were a
good deal more divided. To many it appeared a strain of true conjugal tenderness, a kind of
appeal, which no woman with a heart could resist: while by others, on the contrary, it was
considered to be a mere showy effusion of sentiment, as difficult for real feeling to have
produced as it was easy for fancy and art, and altogether unworthy of the deep interests involved
in the subject. To this latter opinion, I confess my own to have, at first, strongly inclined;
and suspicious as I could not help regarding the sentiment that could, at such a moment, indulge
in such verses, the taste that prompted or sanctioned their publication appeared to me even
still more questionable. On reading, however, his own account of all the circumstances in the
Memoranda, I found that on both points I had, in common with a large portion of the public,
done him injustice. He there described, and in a manner whose sincerity there was no doubting,
the swell of tender recollections under the influence of which, as he sat one night musing
in his study, these stanzas were produced,--the tears, as he said, falling fast over the paper
as he wrote them. Neither, from that account, did it appear to have been from any wish or intention
of his own, but through the injudicious zeal of a friend whom he had suffered to take a copy,
that the verses met the public eye.

The appearance of these poems gave additional violence to the angry and inquisitorial feeling
now abroad against him; and the title under which both pieces were immediately announced by
various publishers, as "Poems by Lord Byron on his domestic Circumstances," carried with it
a sufficient exposure of the utter unfitness of such themes for rhyme. It is, indeed, only
in those emotions and passions, of which imagination forms a predominant ingredient,--such
as love, in its first dreams, before reality has come to embody or dispel them, or sorrow,
in its wane, when beginning to pass away from the heart into the fancy,--that poetry ought
ever to be employed as an interpreter of feeling. For the expression of all those immediate
affections and disquietudes that have their root in the actual realities of life, the art of
the poet, from the very circumstance of its being an art, as well as from the coloured form
in which it is accustomed to transmit impressions, cannot be otherwise than a medium as false
as it is feeble.

To so very low an ebb had the industry of his assailants now succeeded in reducing his private
character, that it required no small degree of courage, even among that class who are supposed
to be the most tolerant of domestic irregularities, to invite him into their society. One distinguished
lady of fashion, however, ventured so far as, on the eve of his departure from England, to
make a party for him expressly; and nothing short, perhaps, of that high station in society
which a life as blameless as it is brilliant has secured to her, could have placed beyond all
reach of misrepresentation, at that moment, such a compliment to one marked with the world's
censure so deeply. At this assembly of Lady J * *'s he made his last appearance, publicly,
in England; and the amusing account given of some of the company in his Memoranda,--of the
various and characteristic ways in which the temperature of their manner towards him was affected
by the cloud under which he now appeared,--was one of the passages of that Memoir it would
have been most desirable, perhaps, to have preserved; though, from being a gallery of sketches,
all personal and many satirical, but a small portion of it, if any, could have been presented
to the public till a time when the originals had long left the scene, and any interest they
might once have excited was gone with themselves. Besides the noble hostess herself, whose
kindness to him, on this occasion, he never forgot, there was also one other person (then Miss
M * *, now Lady K * *,) whose frank and fearless cordiality to him on that evening he most
gratefully commemorated,--adding, in acknowledgment of a still more generous service, "She
is a high-minded woman, and showed me more friendship than I deserved from her. I heard also
of her having defended me in a large company, which at that time required more courage and
firmness than most women possess."

       *       *       *       *       *

As we are now approaching so near the close of his London life, I shall here throw together
the few remaining recollections of that period with which the gleanings of his Memorandum-book,
so often referred to, furnish me.

"I liked the Dandies; they were always very civil to me, though in general they disliked literary
people, and persecuted and mystified Madame de Staël, Lewis, * * * *, and the like, damnably.
They persuaded Madame de Staël that A * * had a hundred thousand a year, &c. &c., till she
praised him to his face for his beauty! and made a set at him for * *, and a hundred fooleries
besides. The truth is, that, though I gave up the business early, I had a tinge of dandyism[100]
in my minority, and probably retained enough of it to conciliate the great ones at five-and-twenty.
I had gamed, and drank, and taken my degrees in most dissipations, and having no pedantry,
and not being overbearing, we ran quietly together. I knew them all more or less, and they
made me a member of Watier's (a superb club at that time), being, I take it, the only literary
man (except two others, both men of the world, Moore and Spenser,) in it. Our masquerade[101]
was a grand one; so was the dandy-ball too, at the Argyle, but that (the latter) was given
by the four chiefs, B., M., A., and P., if I err not.

"I was a member of the Alfred, too, being elected while in Greece. It was pleasant; a little
too sober and literary, and bored with * * and Sir Francis D'Ivernois; but one met Peel, and
Ward, and Valentia, and many other pleasant or known people; and it was, upon the whole, a
decent resource in a rainy day, in a dearth of parties, or parliament, or in an empty season.

"I belonged, or belong, to the following clubs or societies:--to the Alfred; to the Cocoa Tree;
to Watier's; to the Union; to Racket's (at Brighton); to the Pugilistic; to the Owls, or "Fly-by-night;"
to the Cambridge Whig Club; to the Harrow Club, Cambridge; and to one or two private clubs;
to the Hampden (political) Club; and to the Italian Carbonari, &c. &c., 'though last, not least.'
I got into all these, and never stood for any other--at least to my own knowledge. I declined
being proposed to several others, though pressed to stand candidate."

          *          *          *          *

"When I met H * * L * *, the gaoler, at Lord Holland's, before he sailed for St. Helena, the
discourse turned upon the battle of Waterloo. I asked him whether the dispositions of Napoleon
were those of a great general? He answered, disparagingly, 'that they were very simple.' I
had always thought that a degree of simplicity was an ingredient of greatness."

          *          *          *          *

"I was much struck with the simplicity of Grattan's manners in private life; they were odd,
but they were natural. Curran used to take him off, bowing to the very ground, and 'thanking
God that he had no peculiarities of gesture or appearance,' in a way irresistibly ludicrous;
and * * used to call him a 'Sentimental Harlequin.'"

          *          *          *          *

"Curran! Curran's the man who struck me most[102]. He was a machine of imagination, as some
one said that Piron was an epigrammatic machine.

"I did not see a great deal of Curran--only in 1813; but I met him at home (for he used to
call on me), and in society, at Mackintosh's, Holland House, &c. &c. and he was wonderful even
to me, who had seen many remarkable men of the time."

          *          *          *          *

"* * * (commonly called long * * *, a very clever man, but odd) complained of our friend Scrope
B. Davies, in riding, that he had a stitch in his side. 'I don't wonder at it,' said Scrope,
'for you ride like a tailor.' Whoever had seen * * * on horseback, with his very tall figure
on a small nag, would not deny the justice of the repartee."

          *          *          *          *

"When B * * was obliged (by that affair of poor M * *, who thence acquired the name of 'Dick
the Dandy-killer'--it was about money, and debt, and all that) to retire to France, he knew
no French, and having obtained a grammar for the purpose of study, our friend Scrope Davies
was asked what progress Brummell had made in French; he responded, 'that Brummell had been
stopped, like Buonaparte in Russia, by the Elements.'

"I have put this pun into Beppo, which is 'a fair exchange and no robbery; for Scrope made
his fortune at several dinners (as he owned himself) by repeating occasionally, as his own,
some of the buffooneries with which I had encountered him in the morning."

          *          *          *          *

"* * * is a good man, rhymes well (if not wisely), but is a bore. He seizes you by the button.
One night of a rout, at Mrs. Hope's, he had fastened upon me, notwithstanding my symptoms of
manifest distress, (for I was in love, and had just nicked a minute when neither mothers, nor
husbands, nor rivals, nor gossips, were near my then idol, who was beautiful as the statues
of the gallery where we stood at the time,)--* * *, I say, had seized upon me by the button
and the heart-strings, and spared neither. W. Spencer, who likes fun, and don't dislike mischief,
saw my case, and coming up to us both, took me by the hand, and pathetically bade me farewell;
'for,' said he, 'I see it is all over with you.' * * * then went away. Sic me servavit Apollo."

          *          *          *          *

"I remember seeing Blucher in the London assemblies, and never saw any thing of his age less
venerable. With the voice and manners of a recruiting sergeant, he pretended to the honours
of a hero,--just as if a stone could be worshipped because a man had stumbled over it."

[Footnote 100: Petrarch was, it appears, also in his youth, a Dandy. In a note to Mr. Rogers,
written a short time before his departure for Ostend[103], he says,--"My sister is now with
me, and leaves town to-morrow: we shall not meet again for some time, at all events--if ever;
and, under these circumstances, I trust to stand excused to you and Mr. Sheridan for being
unable to wait upon him this evening."

This was his last interview with his sister,--almost the only person from whom he now parted
with regret; it being, as he said, doubtful which had given him most pain, the enemies who
attacked or the friends who condoled with him. Those beautiful and most tender verses, "Though
the day of my destiny's over," were now his parting tribute to her[104] who, through all this
bitter trial, had been his sole consolation; and, though known to most readers, so expressive
are they of his wounded feelings at this crisis, that there are few, I think, who will object
to seeing some stanzas of them here.

On a scrap of paper, in his handwriting, dated April 14. 1816, I find the following list of
his attendants, with an annexed outline of his projected tour:--"Servants, ---- Berger, a Swiss,
William Fletcher, and Robert Rushton.--John William Polidori, M.D.--Switzerland, Flanders,
Italy, and (perhaps) France." The two English servants, it will be observed, were the same
"yeoman" and "page" who had set out with him on his youthful travels in 1809; and now,--for
the second and last time taking leave of his country,--on the 25th of April he sailed for Ostend.

The circumstances under which Lord Byron now took leave of England were such as, in the case
of any ordinary person, could not be considered otherwise than disastrous and humiliating.
He had, in the course of one short year, gone through every variety of domestic misery;--had
seen his hearth eight or nine times profaned by the visitations of the law, and been only saved
from a prison by the privileges of his rank. He had alienated, as far as they had ever been
his, the affections of his wife; and now, rejected by her, and condemned by the world, was
betaking himself to an exile which had not even the dignity of appearing voluntary, as the
excommunicating voice of society seemed to leave him no other resource. Had he been of that
class of unfeeling and self-satisfied natures from whose hard surface the reproaches of others
fall pointless, he might have found in insensibility a sure refuge against reproach; but, on
the contrary, the same sensitiveness that kept him so awake to the applauses of mankind, rendered
him, in a still more intense degree, alive to their censure. Even the strange, perverse pleasure
which he felt in painting himself unamiably to the world did not prevent him from being both
startled and pained when the world took him at his word; and, like a child in a mask before
a looking-glass, the dark semblance which he had, half in sport, put on, when reflected back
upon him from the mirror of public opinion, shocked even himself.

Thus surrounded by vexations, and thus deeply feeling them, it is not too much to say, that
any other spirit but his own would have sunk under the struggle, and lost, perhaps irrecoverably,
that level of self-esteem which alone affords a stand against the shocks of fortune. But in
him,--furnished as was his mind with reserves of strength, waiting to be called out,--the very
intensity of the pressure brought relief by the proportionate re-action which it produced.
Had his transgressions and frailties been visited with no more than their due portion of punishment,
there can be little doubt that a very different result would have ensued. Not only would such
an excitement have been insufficient to waken up the new energies still dormant in him, but
that consciousness of his own errors, which was for ever livelily present in his mind, would,
under such circumstances, have been left, undisturbed by any unjust provocation, to work its
usual softening and, perhaps, humbling influences on his spirit. But,--luckily, as it proved,
for the further triumphs of his genius,--no such moderation was exercised. The storm of invective
raised around him, so utterly out of proportion with his offences, and the base calumnies that
were every where heaped upon his name, left to his wounded pride no other resource than in
the same summoning up of strength, the same instinct of resistance to injustice, which had
first forced out the energies of his youthful genius, and was now destined to give a still
bolder and loftier range to its powers.

It was, indeed, not without truth, said of him by Goethe, that he was inspired by the Genius
of Pain; for, from the first to the last of his agitated career, every fresh recruitment of
his faculties was imbibed from that bitter source. His chief incentive, when a boy, to distinction
was, as we have seen, that mark of deformity on his person, by an acute sense of which he was
first stung into the ambition of being great.[105] As, with an evident reference to his own
fate, he himself describes the feeling,--

                      "Deformity is daring.
    It is its essence to o'ertake mankind
    By heart and soul, and make itself the equal,--
    Ay, the superior of the rest. He appeared, indeed, himself to have had
an instinctive consciousness that it was out of such ordeals his
strength and glory were to arise, as his whole life was passed in
courting agitation and difficulties; and whenever the scenes around him
were too tame to furnish such excitement, he flew to fancy or memory for
"thorns" whereon to "lean his breast."

But the greatest of his trials, as well as triumphs, was yet to come. The last stage of this
painful, though glorious, course, in which fresh power was, at every step, wrung from out his
soul, was that at which we are now arrived, his marriage and its results,--without which, dear
as was the price paid by him in peace and character, his career would have been incomplete,
and the world still left in ignorance of the full compass of his genius. It is, indeed, worthy
of remark, that it was not till his domestic circumstances began to darken around him that
his fancy, which had long been idle, again rose upon the wing,--both The Siege of Corinth and
Parisina having been produced but a short time before the separation.

This buoyancy it was,--this irrepressible spring of mind,--that now enabled him to bear up
not only against the assaults of others, but, what was still more difficult, against his own
thoughts and feelings. The muster of all his mental resources to which, in self-defence, he
had been driven, but opened to him the yet undreamed extent and capacity of his powers, and
inspired him with a proud confidence that he should yet shine down these calumnious mists,
convert censure to wonder, and compel even those who could not approve to admire.

The route which he now took, through Flanders and by the Rhine, is best traced in his own matchless
verses, which leave a portion of their glory on all that they touch, and lend to scenes, already
clothed with immortality by nature and by history, the no less durable associations of undying
song. On his leaving Brussels, an incident occurred which would be hardly worth relating, were
it not for the proof it affords of the malicious assiduity with which every thing to his disadvantage
was now caught up and circulated in England. Mr. Pryce Gordon, a gentleman, who appears to
have seen a good deal of him during his short stay at Brussels, thus relates the anecdote:--

"Lord Byron travelled in a huge coach, copied from the celebrated one of Napoleon, taken at
Genappe, with additions. Besides a lit de repos, it contained a library, a plate-chest, and
every apparatus for dining in it. It was not, however, found sufficiently capacious for his
baggage and suite; and he purchased a calèche at Brussels for his servants. It broke down going
to Waterloo, and I advised him to return it, as it seemed to be a crazy machine; but as he
had made a deposit of forty Napoleons (certainly double its value), the honest Fleming would
not consent to restore the cash, or take back his packing case, except under a forfeiture of
thirty Napoleons. As his Lordship was to set out the following day, he begged me to make the
best arrangement I could in the affair. He had no sooner taken his departure, than the worthy
sellier inserted a paragraph in 'The Brussels Oracle,' stating 'that the noble milor Anglais
had absconded with his calèche, value 1800 francs!'"

In the Courier of May 13., the Brussels account of this transaction is thus copied:--

"The following is an extract from the Dutch Mail, dated Brussels, May 8th,:--In the Journal
de Belgique, of this date, is a petition from a coachmaker at Brussels to the president of
the Tribunal de Premier Instance, stating that he has sold to Lord Byron a carriage, &c. for
1882 francs, of which he has received 847 francs, but that his Lordship, who is going away
the same day, refuses to pay him the remaining 1035 francs; he begs permission to seize the
carriage, &c. This being granted, he put it into the hands of a proper officer, who went to
signify the above to Lord Byron, and was informed by the landlord of the hotel that his Lordship
was gone without having given him any thing to pay the debt, on which the officer seized a
chaise belonging to his Lordship as security for the amount."

It was not till the beginning of the following month that a contradiction of this falsehood,
stating the real circumstances of the case, as above related, was communicated to the Morning
Chronicle, in a letter from Brussels, signed "Pryce L. Gordon."

Another anecdote, of far more interest, has been furnished from the same respectable source.
It appears that the two first stanzas of the verses relating to Waterloo, "Stop, for thy tread
is on an empire's dust[107]," were written at Brussels, after a visit to that memorable field,
and transcribed by Lord Byron, next morning, in an album belonging to the lady of the gentleman
who communicates the anecdote.

"A few weeks after he had written them (says the relater), the well-known artist, R.R. Reinagle,
a friend of mine, arrived in Brussels, when I invited him to dine with me and showed him the
lines, requesting him to embellish them with an appropriate vignette to the following passage:--

      "'Here his last flight the haughty eagle flew,
      Then tore, with bloody beak, the fatal plain;
      Pierced with the shafts of banded nations through,
      Ambition's life, and labours, all were vain--
    He wears the shatter'd links of the world's broken chain.'

Mr. Reinagle sketched with a pencil a spirited chained eagle, grasping the earth with his talons.

"I had occasion to write to his Lordship, and mentioned having got this clever artist to draw
a vignette to his beautiful lines, and the liberty he had taken by altering the action of the
eagle. In reply to this, he wrote to me,--'Reinagle is a better poet and a better ornithologist
than I am; eagles, and all birds of prey, attack with their talons, and not with their beaks,
and I have altered the line thus:--

    "'Then tore, with bloody talon, the rent plain.'

This is, I think, a better line, besides its poetical justice.' I need hardly add, when I communicated
this flattering compliment to the painter, that he was highly gratified."

From Brussels the noble traveller pursued his course along the Rhine,--a line of road which
he has strewed over with all the riches of poesy; and, arriving at Geneva, took up his abode
at the well-known hotel, Sécheron. After a stay of a few weeks at this place, he removed to
a villa, in the neighbourhood, called Diodati, very beautifully situated on the high banks
of the Lake, where he established his residence for the remainder of the summer.

I shall now give the few letters in my possession written by him at this time, and then subjoin
to them such anecdotes as I have been able to collect relative to the same period.

[Footnote 103: Dated April 16.]

[Footnote 104: It will be seen, from a subsequent letter, that the first stanza of that most
cordial of Farewells, "My boat is on the shore," was also written at this time.]

[Footnote 105: In one of his letters to Mr. Hunt, he declares it to be his own opinion that
"an addiction to poetry is very generally the result of 'an uneasy mind in an uneasy body;'
disease or deformity," he adds, "have been the attendants of many of our best. Collins mad--Chatterton,
I think, mad--Cowper mad--Pope crooked--Milton blind," &c. &c.]

LETTER 242. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Ouchy, near Lausanne, June 27. 1816.

     "I am thus far (kept by stress of weather) on my way back to
     Diodati (near Geneva) from a voyage in my boat round the Lake; and
     I enclose you a sprig of Gibbons acacia and some rose-leaves from
     his garden, which, with part of his house, I have just seen. You
     will find honourable mention, in his Life, made of this 'acacia,'
     when he walked out on the night of concluding his history. The
     garden and summer-house, where he composed, are neglected, and
     the last utterly decayed; but they still show it as his 'cabinet,'
     and seem perfectly aware of his memory.

     "My route, through Flanders, and by the Rhine, to Switzerland, was
     all I expected, and more.

     "I have traversed all Rousseau's ground with the Heloise before me,
     and am struck to a degree that I cannot express with the force and
     accuracy of his descriptions and the beauty of their reality.
     Meillerie, Clarens, and Vevay, and the Château de Chillon, are
     places of which I shall say little, because all I could say must
     fall short of the impressions they stamp.

     "Three days ago, we were most nearly wrecked in a squall off
     Meillerie, and driven to shore. I ran no risk, being so near the
     rocks, and a good swimmer; but our party were wet, and incommoded a
     good deal. The wind was strong enough to blow down some trees, as
     we found at landing: however, all is righted and right, and we are
     thus far on our return.

     "Dr. Polidori is not here, but at Diodati, left behind in hospital
     with a sprained ankle, which he acquired in tumbling from a
     wall--he can't jump.

     "I shall be glad to hear you are well, and have received for me
     certain helms and swords, sent from Waterloo, which I rode over
     with pain and pleasure.

     "I have finished a third canto of Childe Harold (consisting of one
     hundred and seventeen stanzas), longer than either of the two
     former, and in some parts, it may be, better; but of course on that
     I cannot determine. I shall send it by the first safe-looking
     opportunity. Ever," &c.

LETTER 243. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Diodati, near Geneva, July 22. 1816.

     "I wrote to you a few weeks ago, and Dr. Polidori received your
     letter; but the packet has not made its appearance, nor the
     epistle, of which you gave notice therein. I enclose you an
     advertisement[108], which was copied by Dr. Polidori, and which
     appears to be about the most impudent imposition that ever issued
     from Grub Street. I need hardly say that I know nothing of all this
     trash, nor whence it may spring,--'Odes to St. Helena,'--'Farewells
     to England,' &c. &c.--and if it can be disavowed, or is worth
     disavowing, you have full authority to do so. I never wrote, nor
     conceived, a line on any thing of the kind, any more than of two
     other things with which I was saddled--something about 'Gaul,' and
     another about 'Mrs. La Valette;' and as to the 'Lily of France,' I
     should as soon think of celebrating a turnip. 'On the Morning of my
     Daughter's Birth,' I had other things to think of than verses; and
     should never have dreamed of such an invention, till Mr. Johnston
     and his pamphlet's advertisement broke in upon me with a new light
     on the crafts and subtleties of the demon of printing,--or rather
     publishing.

     "I did hope that some succeeding lie would have superseded the
     thousand and one which were accumulated during last winter. I can
     forgive whatever may be said of or against me, but not what they
     make me say or sing for myself. It is enough to answer for what I
     have written; but it were too much for Job himself to bear what one
     has not. I suspect that when the Arab Patriarch wished that his
     'enemy had written a book,' he did not anticipate his own name on
     the title-page. I feel quite as much bored with this foolery as it
     deserves, and more than I should be if I had not a headach. I have not even a guess at the
     contents, except from the very vague accounts I have heard.

     "I ought to be ashamed of the egotism of this letter. It is not my
     fault altogether, and I shall be but too happy to drop the subject
     when others will allow me.

     "I am in tolerable plight, and in my last letter told you what I
     had done in the way of all rhyme. I trust that you prosper, and
     that your authors are in good condition. I should suppose your stud
     has received some increase by what I hear. Bertram must be a good
     horse; does he run next meeting? I hope you will beat the Row.
     Yours alway," &c.

LETTER 244. TO MR. ROGERS.

     "Diodati, near Geneva, July 29. 1816.

     "Do you recollect a book, Mathieson's Letters, which you lent me,
     which I have still, and yet hope to return to your library? Well, I
     have encountered at Copet and elsewhere Gray's correspondent, that
     same Bonstetten, to whom I lent the translation of his
     correspondent's epistles, for a few days; but all he could remember
     of Gray amounts to little, except that he was the most 'melancholy
     and gentlemanlike' of all possible poets. Bonstetten himself is a
     fine and very lively old man, and much esteemed by his compatriots;
     he is also a littérateur of good repute, and all his friends have
     a mania of addressing to him volumes of letters--Mathieson, Muller
     the historian, &c.&c. He is a good deal at Copet, where I have met
     him a few times. All there are well, except Rocca, who, I am sorry
     to say, looks in a very bad state of health. Schlegel is in high
     force, and Madame as brilliant as ever.

     "I came here by the Netherlands and the Rhine route, and Basle,
     Berne, Moral, and Lausanne. I have circumnavigated the Lake, and go
     to Chamouni with the first fair weather; but really we have had
     lately such stupid mists, fogs, and perpetual density, that one
     would think Castlereagh had the Foreign Affairs of the kingdom of
     Heaven also on his hands. I need say nothing to you of these parts,
     you having traversed them already. I do not think of Italy before
     September. I have read Glenarvon, and have also seen Ben.
     Constant's Adolphe, and his preface, denying the real people. It is
     a work which leaves an unpleasant impression, but very consistent
     with the consequences of not being in love, which is, perhaps, as
     disagreeable as any thing, except being so. I doubt, however,
     whether all such liens (as he calls them) terminate so wretchedly
     as his hero and heroine's.

     "There is a third Canto (a longer than either of the former) of
     Childe Harold finished, and some smaller things,--among them a
     story on the Château de Chillon; I only wait a good opportunity to
     transmit them to the grand Murray, who, I hope, flourishes. Where
     is Moore? Why is he not out? My love to him, and my perfect
     consideration and remembrances to all, particularly to Lord and
     Lady Holland, and to your Duchess of Somerset.

     "Ever, &c.

     you might like to see the hand of Gray's correspondent."

     "Diodati, Sept. 29. 1816.

     "I am very much flattered by Mr. Gifford's good opinion of the
     MSS., and shall be still more so if it answers your expectations
     and justifies his kindness. I liked it myself, but that must go for
     nothing. The feelings with which most of it was written need not be
     envied me. With regard to the price, I fixed none, but left it
     to Mr. Kinnaird, Mr. Shelley, and yourself, to arrange. Of course,
     they would do their best; and as to yourself, I knew you would make
     no difficulties. But I agree with Mr. Kinnaird perfectly, that the
     concluding five hundred should be only conditional; and for my
     own sake, I wish it to be added, only in case of your selling a
     certain number, that number to be fixed by yourself. I hope
     this is fair. In every thing of this kind there must be risk; and
     till that be past, in one way or the other, I would not willingly
     add to it, particularly in times like the present. And pray always
     recollect that nothing could mortify me more--no failure on my own
     part--than having made you lose by any purchase from me.

     "The Monody[110] was written by request of Mr. Kinnaird for the
     theatre. I did as well as I could; but where I have not my choice
     I pretend to answer for nothing. Mr. Hobhouse and myself are just
     returned from a journey of lakes and mountains. We have been to the
     Grindelwald, and the Jungfrau, and stood on the summit of the
     Wengen Alp; and seen torrents of nine hundred feet in fall, and
     glaciers of all dimensions: we have heard shepherds' pipes, and
     avalanches, and looked on the clouds foaming up from the valleys
     below us, like the spray of the ocean of hell. Chamouni, and that
     which it inherits, we saw a month ago: but though Mont Blanc is
     higher, it is not equal in wildness to the Jungfrau, the Eighers,
     the Shreckhorn, and the Rose Glaciers.

     "We set off for Italy next week. The road is within this month
     infested with bandits, but we must take our chance and such
     precautions as are requisite.

     "Ever, &c.

     "P.S. My best remembrances to Mr. Gifford. Pray say all that can be
     said from me to him.

     "I am sorry that Mr. Maturin did not like Phillips's picture. I
     thought it was reckoned a good one. If he had made the speech on
     the original, perhaps he would have been more readily forgiven by
     the proprietor and the painter of the portrait * * *."

LETTER 246. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Diodati, Sept. 30. 1816.

     "I answered your obliging letters yesterday: to-day the Monody
     arrived with its title-page, which is, I presume, a separate
     publication. 'The request of a friend:'--

        'Obliged by hunger and request of friends.'

     I will request you to expunge that same, unless you please to add,
     'by a person of quality,' or 'of wit and honour about town.' Merely
     say, 'written to be spoken at Drury Lane.' To-morrow I dine at
     Copet. Saturday I strike tents for Italy. This evening, on the lake
     in my boat with Mr. Hobhouse, the pole which sustains the mainsail
     slipped in tacking, and struck me so violently on one of my legs
     (the worst, luckily) as to make me do a foolish thing, viz. to
     faint--a downright swoon; the thing must have jarred some nerve
     or other, for the bone is not injured, and hardly painful (it is
     six hours since), and cost Mr. Hobhouse some apprehension and much
     sprinkling of water to recover me. The sensation was a very odd
     one: I never had but two such before, once from a cut on the head
     from a stone, several years ago, and once (long ago also) in
     falling into a great wreath of snow;--a sort of grey giddiness
     first, then nothingness, and a total loss of memory on beginning to
     recover. The last part is not disagreeable, if one did not find it
     again.

     "You want the original MSS. Mr. Davies has the first fair copy in
     my own hand, and I have the rough composition here, and will send
     or save it for you, since you wish it.

     "With regard to your new literary project, if any thing falls in
     the way which will, to the best of my judgment, suit you, I will
     send you what I can. At present I must lay by a little, having
     pretty well exhausted myself in what I have sent you. Italy or
     Dalmatia and another summer may, or may not, set me off again. I
     have no plans, and am nearly as indifferent what may come as where
     I go. I shall take Felicia Heman's Restoration, &c. with me; it is
     a good poem--very.

     "Pray repeat my best thanks and remembrances to Mr. Gifford for all
     his trouble and good nature towards me.

     "Do not fancy me laid up, from the beginning of this scrawl. I tell
     you the accident for want of better to say; but it is over, and I
     am only wondering what the deuce was the matter with me.

     "I have lately been over all the Bernese Alps and their lakes. I
     think many of the scenes (some of which were not those usually
     frequented by the English) finer than Chamouni, which I visited
     some time before. I have been to Clarens again, and crossed the
     mountains behind it: of this tour I kept a short journal for my
     sister, which I sent yesterday in three letters. It is not all for
     perusal; but if you like to hear about the romantic part, she will,
     I dare say, show you what touches upon the rocks, &c.

     "Christabel--I won't have any one sneer at Christabel: it is a fine
     wild poem.

EXTRACTS FROM A JOURNAL.

"September 18. 1816.

"Yesterday, September 17th, I set out with Mr. Hobhouse on an excursion of some days to the
mountains.

"September 17.

"Rose at five; left Diodati about seven, in one of the country carriages (a char-à-banc), our
servants on horseback. Weather very fine; the lake calm and clear; Mont Blanc and the Aiguille
of Argentières both very distinct; the borders of the lake beautiful. Reached Lausanne before
sunset; stopped and slept at ----. Went to bed at nine: slept till five o'clock.

"September 18.

"Called by my courier; got up. Hobhouse walked on before. A mile from Lausanne, the road overflowed
by the lake; got on horseback and rode till within a mile of Vevay. The colt young, but went
very well. Overtook Hobhouse, and resumed the carriage, which is an open one. Stopped at Vevay
two hours (the second time I had visited it); walked to the church; view from the churchyard
superb; within it General Ludlow (the regicide's) monument--black marble--long inscription--Latin,
but simple; he was an exile two-and-thirty-years--one of King Charles's judges. Near him Broughton
(who read King Charles's sentence to Charles Stuart) is buried, with a queer and rather canting,
but still a republican, inscription. Ludlow's house shown; it retains still its inscription--'Omne
solum forti patria.' Walked down to the Lake side; servants, carriage, saddle-horses--all set
off and left us plantés là, by some mistake, and we walked on after them towards Clarens: Hobhouse
ran on before, and overtook them at last. Arrived the second time (first time was by water)
at Clarens. Went to Chillon through scenery worthy of I know not whom; went over the Castle
of Chillon again. On our return met an English party in a carriage; a lady in it fast asleep--fast
asleep in the most anti-narcotic spot in the world--excellent! I remember, at Chamouni, in
the very eyes of Mont Blanc, hearing another woman, English also, exclaim to her party, 'Did
you ever see any thing more rural?'--as if it was Highgate, or Hampstead, or Brompton, or Hayes,--'Rural!'
quotha.--Rocks, pines, torrents, glaciers, clouds, and summits of eternal snow far above them--and
'rural!'

"After a slight and short dinner we visited the Chateau de Clarens; an English woman has rented
it recently (it was not let when I saw it first); the roses are gone with their summer; the
family out, but the servants desired us to walk over the interior of the mansion. Saw on the
table of the saloon Blair's Sermons and somebody else's (I forget who's) sermons, and a set
of noisy children. Saw all worth seeing, and then descended to the 'Bosquet de Julie,' &c.
&c.; our guide full of Rousseau, whom he is eternally confounding with St. Preux, and mixing
the man and the book. Went again as far as Chillon to revisit the little torrent from the hill
behind it. Sunset reflected in the lake. Have to get up at five to-morrow to cross the mountains
on horseback; carriage to be sent round; lodged at my old cottage--hospitable and comfortable;
tired with a longish ride on the colt, and the subsequent jolting of the char-à-banc, and my
scramble in the hot sun.

"Mem. The corporal who showed the wonders of Chillon was as drunk as Blucher, and (to my mind)
as great a man; he was deaf also, and thinking every one else so, roared out the legends of
the castle so fearfully that H. got out of humour. However, we saw things from the gallows
to the dungeons (the potence and the cachots), and returned to Clarens with more freedom than
belonged to the fifteenth century.

"September 19.

"Rose at five. Crossed the mountains to Montbovon on horseback, and on mules, and, by dint
of scrambling, on foot also; the whole route beautiful as a dream, and now to me almost as
indistinct. I am so tired;--for though healthy, I have not the strength I possessed but a few
years ago. At Montbovon we breakfasted; afterwards, on a steep ascent dismounted; tumbled down;
cut a finger open; the baggage also got loose and fell down a ravine, till stopped by a large
tree; recovered baggage; horse tired and drooping; mounted mule. At the approach of the summit
of Dent Jument[111] dismounted again with Hobhouse and all the party. Arrived at a lake in
the very bosom of the mountains; left our quadrupeds with a shepherd, and ascended farther;
came to some snow in patches, upon which my forehead's perspiration fell like rain, making
the same dints as in a sieve; the chill of the wind and the snow turned me giddy, but I scrambled
on and upwards. Hobhouse went to the highest pinnacle; I did not, but paused within a few yards
(at an opening of the cliff). In coming down, the guide tumbled three times; I fell a laughing,
and tumbled too--the descent luckily soft, though steep and slippery: Hobhouse also fell, but
nobody hurt. The whole of the mountains superb. A shepherd on a very steep and high cliff playing
upon his pipe; very different from Arcadia, where I saw the pastors with a long musket instead
of a crook, and pistols in their girdles. Our Swiss shepherd's pipe was sweet, and his tune
agreeable. I saw a cow strayed; am told that they often break their necks on and over the crags.
Descended to Montbovon; pretty scraggy village, with a wild river and a wooden bridge. Hobhouse
went to fish--caught one. Our carriage not come; our horses, mules, &c. knocked up; ourselves
fatigued; but so much the better--I shall sleep.

"The view from the highest points of to-day's journey comprised on one side the greatest part
of Lake Leman; on the other, the valleys and mountain of the Canton of Fribourg, and an immense
plain, with the lakes of Neuchâtel and Morat, and all which the borders of the Lake of Geneva
inherit; we had both sides of the Jura before us in one point of view, with Alps in plenty.
In passing a ravine, the guide recommended strenuously a quickening of pace, as the stones
fall with great rapidity and occasional damage; the advice is excellent, but, like most good
advice, impracticable, the road being so rough that neither mules, nor mankind, nor horses,
can make any violent progress. Passed without fractures or menace thereof.

"The music of the cow's bells (for their wealth, like the patriarchs', is cattle) in the pastures,
which reach to a height far above any mountains in Britain, and the shepherds shouting to us
from crag to crag, and playing on their reeds where the steeps appeared almost inaccessible,
with the surrounding scenery, realised all that I have ever heard or imagined of a pastoral
existence:--much more so than Greece or Asia Minor, for there we are a little too much of the
sabre and musket order, and if there is a crook in one hand, you are sure to see a gun in the
other:--but this was pure and unmixed--solitary, savage, and patriarchal. As we went, they
played the 'Rans des Vaches' and other airs, by way of farewell. I have lately repeopled my
mind with nature.

[Footnote 111: Dent de Jaman.]

"September 20.

Up at six; off at eight. The whole of this day's journey at an average of between from 2700
to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. This valley, the longest, narrowest, and considered
the finest of the Alps, little traversed by travellers. Saw the bridge of La Roche. The bed
of the river very low and deep, between immense rocks, and rapid as anger;--a man and mule
said to have tumbled over without damage. The people looked free, and happy, and rich (which
last implies neither of the former); the cows superb; a bull nearly leapt into the char-à-banc--'agreeable
companion in a post-chaise;' goats and sheep very thriving. A mountain with enormous glaciers
to the right--the Klitzgerberg; further on, the Hockthorn--nice names--so soft!--Stockhorn,
I believe, very lofty and scraggy, patched with snow only; no glaciers on it, but some good
epaulettes of clouds.

"Passed the boundaries, out of Vaud and into Berne canton; French exchanged for bad German;
the district famous for cheese, liberty, property, and no taxes. Hobhouse went to fish--caught
none. Strolled to the river; saw boy and kid; kid followed him like a dog; kid could not get
over a fence, and bleated piteously; tried myself to help kid, but nearly overset both self
and kid into the river. Arrived here about six in the evening. Nine o'clock--going to bed;
not tired to day, but hope to sleep, nevertheless.

"September 21.

"Off early. The valley of Simmenthal as before. Entrance to the plain of Thoun very narrow;
high rocks, wooded to the top; river; new mountains, with fine glaciers. Lake of Thoun; extensive
plain with a girdle of Alps. Walked down to the Chateau de Schadau; view along the lake; crossed
the river in a boat rowed by women. Thoun a very pretty town. The whole day's journey Alpine
and proud.

"September 22.

"Left Thoun in a boat, which carried us the length of the lake in three hours. The lake small;
but the banks fine. Rocks down to the water's edge. Landed at Newhause; passed Interlachen;
entered upon a range of scenes beyond all description or previous conception. Passed a rock;
inscription--two brothers--one murdered the other; just the place for it. After a variety of
windings came to an enormous rock. Arrived at the foot of the mountain (the Jungfrau, that
is, the Maiden); glaciers; torrents; one of these torrents nine hundred feet in height of visible
descent. Lodged at the curate's. Set out to see the valley; heard an avalanche fall, like thunder;
glaciers enormous; storm came on, thunder, lightning, hail; all in perfection, and beautiful.
I was on horseback; guide wanted to carry my cane; I was going to give it him, when I recollected
that it was a sword-stick, and I thought the lightning might be attracted towards him; kept
it myself; a good deal encumbered with it, as it was too heavy for a whip, and the horse was
stupid, and stood with every other peal. Got in, not very wet, the cloak being stanch. Hobhouse
wet through; Hobhouse took refuge in cottage; sent man, umbrella, and cloak (from the curate's
when I arrived) after him. Swiss curate's house very good indeed--much better than most English
vicarages. It is immediately opposite the torrent I spoke of. The torrent is in shape curving
over the rock, like the tail of a white horse streaming in the wind, such as it might be conceived
would be that of the 'pale horse' on which Death is mounted in the Apocalypse.[112] It is neither
mist nor water, but a something between both; its immense height (nine hundred feet) gives
it a wave or curve, a spreading here or condensation there, wonderful and indescribable. I
think, upon the whole, that this day has been better than any of this present excursion.

[Footnote 112: It is interesting to observe the use to which he afterwards converted these
hasty memorandums in his sublime drama of Manfred.

    "It is not noon--the sunbow's rays still arch
    The torrent with the many hues of heaven,
    And roll the sheeted silver's waving column
    O'er the crag's headlong perpendicular,
    And fling its lines of foaming light along,
    And to and fro, like the pale coursers tail,
    The Giant steed, to be bestrode by Death
    As told in the Apocalypse."
]

"September 23.

"Before ascending the mountain, went to the torrent (seven in the morning) again; the sun upon
it, forming a rainbow of the lower part of all colours, but principally purple and gold; the
bow moving as you move; I never saw any thing like this; it is only in the sunshine. Ascended
the Wengen mountain; at noon reached a valley on the summit; left the horses, took off my coat,
and went to the summit, seven thousand feet (English feet) above the level of the sea, and
about five thousand above the valley we left in the morning. On one side, our view comprised
the Jungfrau, with all her glaciers; then the Dent d'Argent, shining like truth; then the Little
Giant (the Kleine Eigher); and the Great Giant (the Grosse Eigher), and last, not least, the
Wetterhorn. The height of Jungfrau is 13,000 feet above the sea, 11,000 above the valley; she
is the highest of this range. Heard the avalanches falling every five minutes nearly. From
whence we stood, on the Wengen Alp, we had all these in view on one side; on the other, the
clouds rose from the opposite valley, curling up perpendicular precipices like the foam of
the ocean of hell, during a spring tide--it was white, and sulphury, and immeasurably deep
in appearance.[113] The side we ascended was (of course) not of so precipitous a nature; but
on arriving at the summit, we looked down upon the other side upon a boiling sea of cloud,
dashing against the crags on which we stood (these crags on one side quite perpendicular).
Stayed a quarter of an hour; begun to descend; quite clear from cloud on that side of the mountain.
In passing the masses of snow, I made a snowball and pelted Hobhouse with it.

"Got down to our horses again; ate something; remounted; heard the avalanches still; came to
a morass; Hobhouse dismounted to get over well; I tried to pass my horse over; the horse sunk
up to the chin, and of course he and I were in the mud together; bemired, but not hurt; laughed,
and rode on. Arrived at the Grindelwald; dined; mounted again, and rode to the higher glacier--like
a frozen hurricane.[114] Starlight, beautiful, but a devil of a path! Never mind, got safe
in; a little lightning; but the whole of the day as fine in point of weather as the day on
which Paradise was made. Passed whole woods of withered pines, all withered; trunks stripped
and barkless, branches lifeless; done by a single winter[115],--their appearance reminded me
of me and my family.

[Footnote 113:

    "Ye avalanches, whom a breath draws down
    In mountainous o'erwhelming, come and crush me!
    I hear ye momently above, beneath,
    Crash with a frequent conflict. * * *
    The mists boil up around the glaciers; clouds
    Rise curling fast beneath me, white and sulphury,
    Like foam from the roused ocean of deep hell!"
    MANFRED.

[Footnote 114:

                "O'er the savage sea,
    The glassy ocean of the mountain ice,
    We skim its rugged breakers, which put on
    The aspect of a tumbling tempest's foam,

"September 24.

"Set off at seven; up at five. Passed the black glacier, the mountain Wetterhorn on the right;
crossed the Scheideck mountain; came to the Rose glacier, said to be the largest and finest
in Switzerland, I think the Bossons glacier at Chamouni as fine; Hobhouse does not. Came to
the Reichenbach waterfall, two hundred feet high; halted to rest the horses. Arrived in the
valley of Overland; rain came on; drenched a little; only four hours' rain, however, in eight
days. Came to the lake of Brientz, then to the town of Brientz; changed. In the evening, four
Swiss peasant girls of Oberhasli came and sang the airs of their country; two of the voices
beautiful--the tunes also: so wild and original, and at the same time of great sweetness. The
singing is over; but below stairs I hear the notes of a fiddle, which bode no good to my night's
rest; I shall go down and see the dancing.

"September 25.

"The whole town of Brientz were apparently gathered together in the rooms below; pretty music
and excellent waltzing; none but peasants; the dancing much better than in England; the English
can't waltz, never could, never will. One man with his pipe in his mouth, but danced as well
as the others; some other dances in pairs and in fours, and very good. I went to bed, but the
revelry continued below late and early. Brientz but a village. Rose early. Embarked on the
lake of Brientz, rowed by the women in a long boat; presently we put to shore, and another
woman jumped in. It seems it is the custom here for the boats to be manned by women: for of
five men and three women in our bark, all the women took an oar, and but one man.

"Got to Interlachen in three hours; pretty lake; not so large as that of Thoun. Dined at Interlachen.
Girl gave me some flowers, and made me a speech in German, of which I know nothing; I do not
know whether the speech was pretty, but as the woman was, I hope so. Re-embarked on the lake
of Thoun; fell asleep part of the way; sent our horses round; found people on the shore, blowing
up a rock with gunpowder; they blew it up near our boat, only telling us a minute before;--mere
stupidity, but they might have broken our noddles. Got to Thoun in the evening; the weather
has been tolerable the whole day. But as the wild part of our tour is finished, it don't matter
to us; in all the desirable part, we have been most lucky in warmth and clearness of atmosphere.

"September 26.

"Being out of the mountains, my journal must be as flat as my journey. From Thoun to Berne,
good road, hedges, villages, industry, property, and all sorts of tokens of insipid civilisation.
From Berne to Fribourg; different canton; Catholics; passed a field of battle; Swiss beat the
French in one of the late wars against the French republic. Bought a dog. The greater part
of this tour has been on horseback, on foot, and on mule.

"September 28.

"Saw the tree planted in honour of the battle of Morat; three hundred and forty years old;
a good deal decayed. Left Fribourg, but first saw the cathedral; high tower. Overtook the baggage
of the nuns of La Trappe, who are removing to Normandy; afterwards a coach, with a quantity
of nuns in it. Proceeded along the banks of the lake of Neuchâtel; very pleasing and soft,
but not so mountainous--at least, the Jura, not appearing so, after the Bernese Alps. Reached
Yverdun in the dusk; a long line of large trees on the border of the lake; fine and sombre;
the auberge nearly full--a German princess and suite; got rooms.

"September 29.

"Passed through a fine and flourishing country, but not mountainous. In the evening reached
Aubonne (the entrance and bridge something like that of Durham), which commands by far the
fairest view of the Lake of Geneva; twilight; the moon on the lake; a grove on the height,
and of very noble trees. Here Tavernier (the eastern traveller) bought (or built) the château,
because the site resembled and equalled that of Erivan, a frontier city of Persia; here he
finished his voyages, and I this little excursion,--for I am within a few hours of Diodati,
and have little more to see, and no more to say."

       *       *       *       *       *

Among the inmates at Sécheron, on his arrival at Geneva, Lord Byron had found Mr. and Mrs.
Shelley, and a female relative of the latter, who had about a fortnight before taken up their
residence at this hotel. It was the first time that Lord Byron and Mr. Shelley ever met; though,
long before, when the latter was quite a youth,--being the younger of the two by four or five
years,--he had sent to the noble poet a copy of his Queen Mab, accompanied by a letter, in
which, after detailing at full length all the accusations he had heard brought against his
character, he added, that, should these charges not have been true, it would make him happy
to be honoured with his acquaintance. The book alone, it appears, reached its destination,--the
letter having miscarried,--and Lord Byron was known to have expressed warm admiration of the
opening lines of the poem.

There was, therefore, on their present meeting at Geneva, no want of disposition towards acquaintance
on either side, and an intimacy almost immediately sprung up between them. Among the tastes
common to both, that for boating was not the least strong; and in this beautiful region they
had more than ordinary temptations to indulge in it. Every evening, during their residence
under the same roof at Sécheron, they embarked, accompanied by the ladies and Polidori, on
the Lake; and to the feelings and fancies inspired by these excursions, which were not unfrequently
prolonged into the hours of moonlight, we are indebted for some of those enchanting stanzas[116]
in which the poet has given way to his passionate love of Nature so fervidly.

    "There breathes a living fragrance from the shore
    Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear
    Drips the light drop of the suspended oar.
           *       *       *       *       *
    At intervals, some bird from out the brakes
    Starts into voice a moment, then is still.
    There seems a floating whisper on the hill,
    But that is fancy,--for the starlight dews
    All silently their tears of love instil,
    Weeping themselves away."

A person who was of these parties has thus described to me one of their evenings:--"When the
bise or north-east wind blows, the waters of the Lake are driven towards the town, and with
the stream of the Rhone, which sets strongly in the same direction, combine to make a very
rapid current towards the harbour. Carelessly, one evening, we had yielded to its course, till
we found ourselves almost driven on the piles; and it required all our rowers' strength to
master the tide. The waves were high and inspiriting--we were all animated by our contest with
the elements. 'I will sing you an Albanian song,' cried Lord Byron; 'now, be sentimental and
give me all your attention.' It was a strange, wild howl that he gave forth; but such as, he
declared, was an exact imitation of the savage Albanian mode,--laughing, the while, at our
disappointment, who had expected a wild Eastern melody."

Sometimes the party landed, for a walk upon the shore, and, on such occasions, Lord Byron would
loiter behind the rest, lazily trailing his sword-stick along, and moulding, as he went, his
thronging thoughts into shape. Often too, when in the boat, he would lean abstractedly over
the side, and surrender himself up, in silence, to the same absorbing task. From this sort
of self-willed start in the world, an impulse was at once given to his opinions and powers
directly contrary, it would seem, to their natural bias, and from which his life was too short
to allow him time to recover. On such subjects, and on poetry, their conversation generally
turned; and, as might be expected, from Lord Byron's facility in receiving new impressions,
the opinions of his companion were not altogether without some influence on his mind. Here
and there, among those fine bursts of passion and description that abound in the third Canto
of Childe Harold, may be discovered traces of that mysticism of meaning,--that sublimity, losing
itself in its own vagueness,--which so much characterised the writings of his extraordinary
friend; and in one of the notes we find Shelley's favourite Pantheism of Love thus glanced
at:--"But this is not all: the feeling with which all around Clarens and the opposite rocks
of Meillerie is invested, is of a still higher and more comprehensive order than the mere sympathy
with individual passion; it is a sense of the existence of love in its most extended and sublime
capacity, and of our own participation of its good and of its glory: it is the great principle
of the universe, which is there more condensed, but not less manifested; and of which, though
knowing ourselves a part, we lose our individuality, and mingle in the beauty of the whole."

Another proof of the ductility with which he fell into his new friend's tastes and predilections,
appears in the tinge, if not something deeper, of the manner and cast of thinking of Mr. Wordsworth,
which is traceable through so many of his most beautiful stanzas. Being naturally, from his
love of the abstract and imaginative, an admirer of the great poet of the Lakes, Mr. Shelley
omitted no opportunity of bringing the beauties of his favourite writer under the notice of
Lord Byron; and it is not surprising that, once persuaded into a fair perusal, the mind of
the noble poet should--in spite of some personal and political prejudices which unluckily survived
this short access of admiration--not only feel the influence but, in some degree, even reflect
the hues of one of the very few real and original poets that this age (fertile as it is in
rhymers quales ego et Cluvienus) has had the glory of producing.

When Polidori was of their party, (which, till he found attractions elsewhere, was generally
the case,) their more elevated subjects of conversation were almost always put to flight by
the strange sallies of this eccentric young man, whose vanity made him a constant butt for
Lord Byron's sarcasm and merriment. The son of a highly respectable Italian gentleman, who
was in early life, I understand, the secretary of Alfieri, Polidori seems to have possessed
both talents and dispositions which, had he lived, might have rendered him a useful member
of his profession and of society. At the time, however, of which we are speaking, his ambition
of distinction far outwent both his powers and opportunities of attaining it. His mind, accordingly,
between ardour and weakness, was kept in a constant hectic of vanity, and he seems to have
alternately provoked and amused his noble employer, leaving him seldom any escape from anger
but in laughter. Among other pretensions, he had set his heart upon shining as an author, and
one evening at Mr. Shelley's, producing a tragedy of his own writing, insisted that they should
undergo the operation of hearing it. To lighten the infliction, Lord Byron took upon himself
the task of reader; and the whole scene, from the description I have heard of it, must have
been not a little trying to gravity. In spite of the jealous watch kept upon every countenance
by the author, it was impossible to withstand the smile lurking in the eye of the reader, whose
only resource against the outbreak of his own laughter lay in lauding, from time to time, most
vehemently, the sublimity of the verses;--particularly some that began "'Tis thus the goîter'd
idiot of the Alps,'--and then adding, at the close of every such eulogy, "I assure you when
I was in the Drury Lane Committee, much worse things were offered to us."

After passing a fortnight under the same roof with Lord Byron at Sécheron, Mr. and Mrs. Shelley
removed to a small house on the Mont-Blanc side of the Lake, within about ten minutes' walk
of the villa which their noble friend had taken, upon the high banks, called Belle Rive, that
rose immediately behind them. During the fortnight that Lord Byron outstaid them at Sécheron,
though the weather had changed and was become windy and cloudy, he every evening crossed the
Lake, with Polidori, to visit them; and "as he returned again (says my informant) over the
darkened waters, the wind, from far across, bore us his voice singing your Tyrolese Song of
Liberty, which I then first heard, and which is to me inextricably linked with his remembrance."

In the mean time, Polidori had become jealous of the growing intimacy of his noble patron with
Shelley; and the plan which he now understood them to have formed of making a tour of the Lake
without him completed his mortification. In the soreness of his feelings on this subject he
indulged in some intemperate remonstrances, which Lord Byron indignantly resented; and the
usual bounds of courtesy being passed on both sides, the dismissal of Polidori appeared, even
to himself, inevitable. With this prospect, which he considered nothing less than ruin, before
his eyes, the poor young man was, it seems, on the point of committing that fatal act which,
two or three years afterwards, he actually did perpetrate. Retiring to his own room, he had
already drawn forth the poison from his medicine chest, and was pausing to consider whether
he should write a letter before he took it, when Lord Byron (without, however, the least suspicion
of his intention) tapped at the door and entered, with his hand held forth in sign of reconciliation.
The sudden revulsion was too much for poor Polidori, who burst into tears; and, in relating
all the circumstances of the occurrence afterwards, he declared that nothing could exceed the
gentle kindness of Lord Byron in soothing his mind and restoring him to composure.

Soon after this the noble poet removed to Diodati. He had, on his first coming to Geneva, with
the good-natured view of introducing Polidori into company, gone to several Genevese parties;
but, this task performed, he retired altogether from society till late in the summer, when,
as we have seen, he visited Copet. His means were at this time very limited; and though he
lived by no means parsimoniously, all unnecessary expenses were avoided in his establishment.
The young physician had been, at first, a source of much expense to him, being in the habit
of hiring a carriage, at a louis a day (Lord Byron not then keeping horses), to take him to
his evening parties; and it was some time before his noble patron had the courage to put this
luxury down.

The liberty, indeed, which this young person allowed himself was, on one occasion, the means
of bringing an imputation upon the poet's hospitality and good breeding, which, like every
thing else, true or false, tending to cast a shade upon his character, was for some time circulated
with the most industrious zeal. Without any authority from the noble owner of the mansion,
he took upon himself to invite some Genevese gentlemen (M. Pictet, and, I believe, M. Bonstetten)
to dine at Diodati; and the punishment which Lord Byron thought it right to inflict upon him
for such freedom was, "as he had invited the guests, to leave him also to entertain them."
This step, though merely a consequence of the physician's indiscretion, it was not difficult,
of course, to convert into a serious charge of caprice and rudeness against the host himself.

By such repeated instances of thoughtlessness (to use no harsher term), it is not wonderful
that Lord Byron should at last be driven into a feeling of distaste towards his medical companion,
of whom he one day remarked, that "he was exactly the kind of person to whom, if he fell overboard,
one would hold out a straw, to know if the adage be true that drowning men catch at straws."

A few more anecdotes of this young man, while in the service of Lord Byron, may, as throwing
light upon the character of the latter, be not inappropriately introduced. While the whole
party were, one day, out boating, Polidori, by some accident, in rowing, struck Lord Byron
violently on the knee-pan with his oar; and the latter, without speaking, turned his face away
to hide the pain. After a moment he said, "Be so kind, Polidori, another time, to take more
care, for you hurt me very much."--"I am glad of it," answered the other; "I am glad to see
you can suffer pain." In a calm suppressed tone, Lord Byron replied, "Let me advise you, Polidori,
when you, another time, hurt any one, not to express your satisfaction. People don't like to
be told that those who give them pain are glad of it; and they cannot always command their
anger. It was with some difficulty that I refrained from throwing you into the water; and,
but for Mrs. Shelley's presence, I should probably have done some such rash thing." This was
said without ill temper, and the cloud soon passed away.

Another time, when the lady just mentioned was, after a shower of rain, walking up the hill
to Diodati, Lord Byron, who saw her from his balcony where he was standing with Polidori, said
to the latter, "Now, you who wish to be gallant ought to jump down this small height, and offer
your arm." Polidori chose the easiest part of the declivity, and leaped;--but the ground being
wet, his foot slipped, and he sprained his ankle.[117] Lord Byron instantly helped to carry
him in and procure cold water for the foot; and, after he was laid on the sofa, perceiving
that he was uneasy, went up stairs himself (an exertion which his lameness made painful and
disagreeable) to fetch a pillow for him. "Well, I did not believe you had so much feeling,"
was Polidori's gracious remark, which, it may be supposed, not a little clouded the noble poet's
brow.

A dialogue which Lord Byron himself used to mention as having taken place between them during
their journey on the Rhine, is amusingly characteristic of both the persons concerned. "After
all," said the physician, "what is there you can do that I cannot?"--"Why, since you force
me to say," answered the other, "I think there are three things I can do which you cannot."
Polidori defied him to name them. "I can," said Lord Byron, "swim across that river--I can
snuff out that candle with a pistol-shot at the distance of twenty paces--and I have written
a poem[118] of which 14,000 copies were sold in one day."

The jealous pique of the Doctor against Shelley was constantly breaking out; and on the occasion
of some victory which the latter had gained over him in a sailing-match, he took it into his
head that his antagonist had treated him with contempt; and went so far, in consequence, notwithstanding
Shelley's known sentiments against duelling, as to proffer him a sort of challenge, at which
Shelley, as might be expected, only laughed. Lord Byron, however, fearing that the vivacious
physician might still further take advantage of this peculiarity of his friend, said to him,
"Recollect, that though Shelley has some scruples about duelling, I have none; and shall be,
at all times, ready to take his place."

At Diodati, his life was passed in the same regular round of habits and occupations into which,
when left to himself, he always naturally fell; a late breakfast, then a visit to the Shelleys'
cottage and an excursion on the Lake;--at five, dinner[119] (when he usually preferred being
alone), and then, if the weather permitted, an excursion again. He and Shelley had joined in
purchasing a boat, for which they gave twenty-five louis,--a small sailing vessel, fitted to
stand the usual squalls of the climate, and, at that time, the only keeled boat on the Lake.
When the weather did not allow of their excursions after dinner,--an occurrence not unfrequent
during this very wet summer,--the inmates of the cottage passed their evenings at Diodati,
and, when the rain rendered it inconvenient for them to return home, remained there to sleep.
"We often," says one, who was not the least ornamental of the party, "sat up in conversation
till the morning light. There was never any lack of subjects, and, grave or gay, we were always
interested."

Towards the latter end of June, as we have seen in one of the preceding letters, Lord Byron,
accompanied by his friend Shelley, made a tour in his boat round the Lake, and visited, "with
the Heloise before him," all those scenes around Meillerie and Clarens, which have become consecrated
for ever by ideal passion, and by that power which Genius alone possesses, of giving such life
to its dreams as to make them seem realities. In the squall off Meillerie, which he mentions,
their danger was considerable[121]. In the expectation, every moment, of being obliged to swim
for his life, Lord Byron had already thrown off his coat, and, as Shelley was no swimmer, insisted
upon endeavouring, by some means, to save him. This offer, however, Shelley positively refused;
and seating himself quietly upon a locker, and grasping the rings at each end firmly in his
hands, declared his determination to go down in that position, without a struggle.[122]

Subjoined to that interesting little work, the "Six Weeks' Tour," there is a letter by Shelley
himself, giving an account of this excursion round the Lake, and written with all the enthusiasm
such scenes should inspire. In describing a beautiful child they saw at the village of Nerni,
he says, "My companion gave him a piece of money, which he took without speaking, with a sweet
smile of easy thankfulness, and then with an unembarrassed air turned to his play." There were,
indeed, few things Lord Byron more delighted in than to watch beautiful children at play;--"many
a lovely Swiss child (says a person who saw him daily at this time) received crowns from him
as the reward of their grace and sweetness."

Speaking of their lodgings at Nerni, which were gloomy and dirty, Mr. Shelley says, "On returning
to our inn, we found that the servant had arranged our rooms, and deprived them of the greater
portion of their former disconsolate appearance. They reminded my companion of Greece:--it
was five years, he said, since he had slept in such beds."

Luckily for Shelley's full enjoyment of these scenes, he had never before happened to read
the Heloise; and though his companion had long been familiar with that romance, the sight of
the region itself, the "birth-place of deep Love," every spot of which seemed instinct with
the passion of the story, gave to the whole a fresh and actual existence in his mind. Both
were under the spell of the Genius of the place,--both full of emotion; and as they walked
silently through the vineyards that were once the "bosquet de Julie," Lord Byron suddenly exclaimed,
"Thank God, Polidori is not here."

That the glowing stanzas suggested to him by this scene were written upon the spot itself appears
almost certain, from the letter addressed to Mr. Murray on his way back to Diodati, in which
he announces the third Canto as complete, and consisting of 117 stanzas. At Ouchy, near Lausanne,--the
place from which that letter is dated--he and his friend were detained two days, in a small
inn, by the weather: and it was there, in that short interval, that he wrote his "Prisoner
of Chillon," adding one more deathless association to the already immortalised localities of
the Lake.

On his return from this excursion to Diodati, an occasion was afforded for the gratification
of his jesting propensities by the avowal of the young physician that--he had fallen in love.
On the evening of this tender confession they both appeared at Shelley's cottage--Lord Byron,
in the highest and most boyish spirits, rubbing his hands as he walked about the room, and
in that utter incapacity of retention which was one of his foibles, making jesting allusions
to the secret he had just heard. The brow of the Doctor darkened as this pleasantry went on,
and, at last, he angrily accused Lord Byron of hardness of heart. "I never," said he, "met
with a person so unfeeling." This sally, though the poet had evidently brought it upon himself,
annoyed him most deeply. "Call me cold-hearted--me insensible!" he exclaimed, with manifest
emotion--"as well might you say that glass is not brittle, which has been cast down a precipice,
and lies dashed to pieces at the foot!"

In the month of July he paid a visit to Copet, and was received by the distinguished hostess
with a cordiality the more sensibly felt by him as, from his personal unpopularity at this
time, he had hardly ventured to count upon it.[123] In her usual frank style, she took him
to task upon his matrimonial conduct--but in a way that won upon his mind, and disposed him
to yield to her suggestions. He must endeavour, she told him, to bring about a reconciliation
with his wife, and must submit to contend no longer with the opinion of the world. In vain
did he quote her own motto to Delphine, "Un homme peut braver, une femme doit se succomber
aux opinions du monde;"--her reply was, that all this might be very well to say, but that,
in real life, the duty and necessity of yielding belonged also to the man. Her eloquence, in
short, so far succeeded, that he was prevailed upon to write a letter to a friend in England,
declaring himself still willing to be reconciled to Lady Byron,--a concession not a little
startling to those who had so often, lately, heard him declare that, "having done all in his
power to persuade Lady Byron to return, and with this view put off as long as he could signing
the deed of separation, that step being once taken, they were now divided for ever."

Of the particulars of this brief negotiation that ensued upon Madame de Staël's suggestion,
I have no very accurate remembrance; but there can be little doubt that its failure, after
the violence he had done his own pride in the overture, was what first infused any mixture
of resentment or bitterness into the feelings hitherto entertained by him throughout these
painful differences. He had, indeed, since his arrival in Geneva, invariably spoken of his
lady with kindness and regret, imputing the course she had taken, in leaving him, not to herself
but others, and assigning whatever little share of blame he would allow her to bear in the
transaction to the simple and, doubtless, true cause--her not at all understanding him. "I
have no doubt," he would sometimes say, "that she really did believe me to be mad."

Another resolution connected with his matrimonial affairs, in which he often, at this time,
professed his fixed intention to persevere, was that of never allowing himself to touch any
part of his wife's fortune. Such a sacrifice, there is no doubt, would have been, in his situation,
delicate and manly; but though the natural bent of his disposition led him to make the resolution,
he wanted,--what few, perhaps, could have attained,--the fortitude to keep it.

The effects of the late struggle on his mind, in stirring up all its resources and energies,
was visible in the great activity of his genius during the whole of this period, and the rich
variety, both in character and colouring, of the works with which it teemed. Besides the third
Canto of Childe Harold and the Prisoner of Chillon, he produced also his two poems, "Darkness"
and "The Dream," the latter of which cost him many a tear in writing,--being, indeed, the most
mournful, as well as picturesque, "story of a wandering life" that ever came from the pen and
heart of man. Those verses, too, entitled "The Incantation," which he introduced afterwards,
without any connection with the subject, into Manfred, were also (at least, the less bitter
portion of them) the production of this period; and as they were written soon after the last
fruitless attempt at reconciliation, it is needless to say who was in his thoughts while he
penned some of the opening stanzas.

    "Though thy slumber must be deep,
    Yet thy spirit shall not sleep;
    There are shades which will not vanish,
    There are thoughts thou canst not banish;
    By a power to thee unknown,
    Thou canst never be alone;
    Thou art wrapt as with a shroud,
    Thou art gather'd in a cloud;
    And for ever shalt thou dwell
    In the spirit of this spell.

    "Though thou see'st me not pass by,
    Thou shalt feel me with thine eye,
    As a thing that, though unseen,
    Must be near thee, and hath been;
    And when, in that secret dread,
    Thou hast turn'd around thy head,
    Thou shalt marvel I am not
    As thy shadow on the spot,
    And the power which thou dost feel
    Shall be what thou must conceal."

Besides the unfinished "Vampire," he began also, at this time, another romance in prose, founded
upon the story of the Marriage of Belphegor, and intended to shadow out his own matrimonial
fate. The wife of this satanic personage he described much in the same spirit that pervades
his delineation of Donna Inez in the first Canto of Don Juan. While engaged, however, in writing
this story, he heard from England that Lady Byron was ill, and, his heart softening at the
intelligence, he threw the manuscript into the fire. So constantly were the good and evil principles
of his nature conflicting for mastery over him.[124]

The two following Poems, so different from each other in their character,--the first prying
with an awful scepticism into the darkness of another world, and the second breathing all that
is most natural and tender in the affections of this,--were also written at this time, and
have never before been published.

[Footnote 116: Childe Harold, Canto iii.]

[Footnote 117: To this lameness of Polidori, one of the preceding letters of Lord Byron alludes.]

[Footnote 118: The Corsair.]

[Footnote 119: His system of diet here was regulated by an abstinence almost incredible. A
thin slice of bread, with tea, at breakfast--a light, vegetable dinner, with a bottle or two
of Seltzer water, tinged with vin de Grave, and in the evening, a cup of green tea, without
milk or sugar, formed the whole of his sustenance. The pangs of hunger he appeased by privately
chewing tobacco and smoking cigars.]

[Footnote 120: From his remembrance of this sketch, Polidori afterwards vamped up his strange
novel of the Vampire, which, under the supposition of its being Lord Byron's, was received
with such enthusiasm in France. It would, indeed, not a little deduct from our value of foreign
fame, if what some French writers have asserted be true, that the appearance of this extravagant
novel among our neighbours first attracted their attention to the genius of Byron.]

[Footnote 121: "The wind (says Lord Byron's fellow-voyager) gradually increased in violence
until it blew tremendously; and, as it came from the remotest extremity of the Lake, produced
waves of a frightful height, and covered the whole surface with a chaos of foam. One of our
boatmen, who was a dreadfully stupid fellow, persisted in holding the sail at a time when the
boat was on the point of being driven under water by the hurricane. On discovering this error,
he let it entirely go, and the boat for a moment refused to obey the helm; in addition, the
rudder was so broken as to render the management of it very difficult; one wave fell in, and
then another."]

[Footnote 122: "I felt, in this near prospect of death (says Mr. Shelley), a mixture of sensations,
among which terror entered, though but subordinately. My feelings would have been less painful
had I been alone; but I knew that my companion would have attempted to save me, and I was overcome
with humiliation, when I thought that his life might have been risked to preserve mine. When
we arrived at St. Gingoux, the inhabitants, who stood on the shore, unaccustomed to see a vessel
as frail as ours, and fearing to venture at all on such a sea, exchanged looks of wonder and
congratulation with our boatmen, who, as well as ourselves, were well pleased to set foot on
shore."]

[Footnote 123: In the account of this visit to Copet in his Memoranda, he spoke in high terms
of the daughter of his hostess, the present Duchess de Broglie, and, in noticing how much she
appeared to be attached to her husband, remarked that "Nothing was more pleasing than to see
the developement of the domestic affections in a very young woman." Of Madame de Staël, in
that Memoir, he spoke thus:--"Madame de Staël was a good woman at heart and the cleverest at
bottom, but spoilt by a wish to be--she knew not what. In her own house she was amiable; in
any other person's, you wished her gone, and in her own again."]

[Footnote 124: Upon the same occasion, indeed, he wrote some verses in a spirit not quite so
generous, of which a few of the opening lines is all I shall give:--

    "And thou wert sad--yet I was not with thee!
      And thou wert sick--and yet I was not near.

      Where I was not, and pain and sorrow here.

"EXTRACT FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POEM.

    "Could I remount the river of my years
    To the first fountain of our smiles and tears,
    I would not trace again the stream of hours
    Between their outworn banks of wither'd flowers,
    But bid it flow as now--until it glides
    Into the number of the nameless tides. * * *
    What is this Death?--a quiet of the heart?
    The whole of that of which we are a part?
    For Life is but a vision--what I see
    Of all which lives alone is life to me,
    And being so--the absent are the dead,
    Who haunt us from tranquillity, and spread
    A dreary shroud around us, and invest
    With sad remembrances our hours of rest.
      "The absent are the dead--for they are cold,
    And ne'er can be what once we did behold;
    And they are changed, and cheerless,--or if yet
    The unforgotten do not all forget,
    Since thus divided--equal must it be
    If the deep barrier be of earth, or sea;
    It may be both--but one day end it must
    In the dark union of insensate dust.
      "The under-earth inhabitants--are they
    But mingled millions decomposed to clay?
    The ashes of a thousand ages spread
    Wherever man has trodden or shall tread?
    Or do they in their silent cities dwell
    Each in his incommunicative cell?
    Or have they their own language? and a sense
    Of breathless being?--darken'd and intense
    As midnight in her solitude?--Oh Earth!
    Where are the past?--and wherefore had they birth?
    The dead are thy inheritors--and we
    But bubbles on thy surface; and the key
    Of thy profundity is in the grave,
    The ebon portal of thy peopled cave,
    Where I would walk in spirit, and behold
    Our elements resolved to things untold,
    And fathom hidden wonders, and explore
    The essence of great bosoms now no more." * *

       *       *       *       *       *

"TO AUGUSTA.

      "My sister! my sweet sister! if a name
      Dearer and purer were, it should be thine.
      Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim
      No tears, but tenderness to answer mine:
      Go where I will, to me thou art the same--
      A loved regret which I would not resign.
      There yet are two things in my destiny,--
    A world to roam through, and a home with thee.

      "The first were nothing--had I still the last,
      It were the haven of my happiness;
      But other claims and other ties thou hast,
      And mine is not the wish to make them less.
      A strange doom is thy father's son's, and past
      Recalling, as it lies beyond redress;
      Reversed for him our grandsire's[125] fate of yore,--
    He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore.

      "If my inheritance of storms hath been
      In other elements, and on the rocks
      Of perils, overlook'd or unforeseen,
      I have sustain'd my share of worldly shocks,
      The fault was mine; nor do I seek to screen
      My errors with defensive paradox;
      I have been cunning in mine overthrow,
    The careful pilot of my proper woe,

      "Mine were my faults, and mine be their reward.
      My whole life was a contest, since the day
      That gave me being, gave me that which marr'd
      The gift,--a fate, or will that walk'd astray;
      And I at times have found the struggle hard,
      And thought of shaking off my bonds of clay:
      But now I fain would for a time survive,
    If but to see what next can well arrive.

      "Kingdoms and empires in my little day
      I have outlived, and yet I am not old;
      And when I look on this, the petty spray
      Of my own years of trouble, which have roll'd
      Like a wild bay of breakers, melts away:
      Something--I know not what--does still uphold
      A spirit of slight patience; not in vain,
    Even for its own sake, do we purchase pain.

      "Perhaps the workings of defiance stir
      Within me,--or perhaps a cold despair,
      Brought on when ills habitually recur,--
      Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air,
      (For even to this may change of soul refer,
      And with light armour we may learn to bear,)
      Have taught me a strange quiet, which was not
    The chief companion of a calmer lot.

      "I feel almost at times as I have felt
      In happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and brooks,
      Which do remember me of where I dwelt
      Ere my young mind was sacrificed to books,
      Come as of yore upon me, and can melt
      My heart with recognition of their looks;
      And even at moments I could think I see
    Some living thing to love--but none like thee.

      "Here are the Alpine landscapes which create
      A fund for contemplation;--to admire
      Is a brief feeling of a trivial date;
      But something worthier do such scenes inspire:
      Here to be lonely is not desolate,
      For much I view which I could most desire,
      And, above all, a lake I can behold
    Lovelier, not dearer, than our own of old.

      "Oh that thou wert but with me!--but I grow
      The fool of my own wishes, and forget
      The solitude which I have vaunted so
      Has lost its praise in this but one regret;
      There may be others which I less may show;--
      I am not of the plaintive mood, and yet
      I feel an ebb in my philosophy,
    And the tide rising in my alter'd eye.

      "I did remind thee of our own dear lake[126],
      By the old hall which may be mine no more.
      Leman's is fair; but think not I forsake
      The sweet remembrance of a dearer shore:
      Sad havoc Time must with my memory make
      Ere that or thou can fade these eyes before;
      Though, like all things which I have loved, they are
    Resign'd for ever, or divided far.

      "The world is all before me; I but ask
      Of nature that with which she will comply--
      It is but in her summer's sun to bask,
      To mingle with the quiet of her sky,
      To see her gentle face without a mask,
      And never gaze on it with apathy.
      She was my early friend, and now shall be
    My sister--till I look again on thee.

      "I can reduce all feelings but this one;
      And that I would not;--for at length I see
      Such scenes as those wherein my life begun.
      The earliest--even the only paths for me--
      Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to shun,
      I had been better than I now can be;
      The passions which have torn me would have slept;
    I had not suffer'd, and thou hadst not wept.

      "With false ambition what had I to do?
      Little with love, and least of all with fame;
      And yet they came unsought, and with me grew,
      And made me all which they can make--a name.
      Yet this was not the end I did pursue;
      Surely I once beheld a nobler aim.
      But all is over--I am one the more
    To baffled millions which have gone before.

      "And for the future, this world's future may
      From me demand but little of my care;
      I have outlived myself by many a day;
      Having survived so many things that were;
      My years have been no slumber, but the prey
      Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the share
      Of life which might have fill'd a century,
    Before its fourth in time had pass'd me by.

      "And for the remnant which may be to come
      I am content; and for the past I feel
      Not thankless,--for within the crowded sum
      Of struggles, happiness at times would steal,
      And for the present, I would not benumb
      My feelings farther.--Nor shall I conceal
      That with all this I still can look around
    And worship Nature with a thought profound.

      "For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart
      I know myself secure, as thou in mine:
      We were and are--I am, even as thou art--
      Beings who ne'er each other can resign;
      It is the same, together or apart,
      From life's commencement to its slow decline
      We are entwined--let death come slow or fast,
    The tie which bound the first endures the last!"

[Footnote 125: "Admiral Byron was remarkable for never making a voyage without a tempest. He
was known to the sailors by the facetious name of 'Foul-weather Jack.'

    "But, though it were tempest-tost,
    Still his bark could not be lost.

He returned safely from the wreck of the Wager (in Anson's Voyage), and subsequently circumnavigated
the world, many years after, as commander of a similar expedition."]

In the month of August, Mr. M.G. Lewis arrived to pass some time with him; and he was soon
after visited by Mr. Richard Sharpe, of whom he makes such honourable mention in the Journal
already given, and with whom, as I have heard this gentleman say, it now gave him evident pleasure
to converse about their common friends in England. Among those who appeared to have left the
strongest impressions of interest and admiration on his mind was (as easily will be believed
by all who know this distinguished person) Sir James Mackintosh.

Soon after the arrival of his friends, Mr. Hobhouse and Mr. S. Davies, he set out, as we have
seen, with the former on a tour through the Bernese Alps,--after accomplishing which journey,
about the beginning of October he took his departure, accompanied by the same gentleman, for Italy.

The first letter of the following series was, it will be seen, written a few days before he
left Diodati.

LETTER 247. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Diodati, Oct. 5. 1816.

     "Save me a copy of 'Buck's Richard III.' republished by Longman;
     but do not send out more books, I have too many.

     "The 'Monody' is in too many paragraphs, which makes it
     unintelligible to me; if any one else understands it in the present
     form, they are wiser; however, as it cannot be rectified till my
     return, and has been already published, even publish it on in the
     collection--it will fill up the place of the omitted epistle.

     "Strike out 'by request of a friend,' which is sad trash, and must
     have been done to make it ridiculous.

     "Be careful in the printing the stanzas beginning,

        "'Though the day of my destiny,' &c.

     which I think well of as a composition.

     "'The Antiquary' is not the best of the three, but much above all
     the last twenty years, saving its elder brothers. Holcroft's
     Memoirs are valuable as showing strength of endurance in the man,
     which is worth more than all the talent in the world.

     "And so you have been publishing 'Margaret of Anjou' and an
     Assyrian tale, and refusing W.W.'s Waterloo, and the 'Hue and Cry.'
     I know not which most to admire, your rejections or acceptances. I
     believe that prose is, after all, the most reputable, for certes,
     if one could foresee--but I won't go on--that is with this
     sentence; but poetry is, I fear, incurable. God help me! if I
     proceed in this scribbling, I shall have frittered away my mind
     before I am thirty, but it is at times a real relief to me. For the
     present--good evening."

       *       *       *       *       *

LETTER 248. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Martigny, October 9. 1816.

     "Thus far on my way to Italy. We have just passed the 'Fisse-Vache'
     (one of the first torrents in Switzerland) in time to view the iris
     which the sun flings along it before noon.

     "I have written to you twice lately. Mr. Davies, I hear, is
     arrived. He brings the original MS. which you wished to see.
     Recollect that the printing is to be from that which Mr. Shelley
     brought; and recollect, also, that the concluding stanzas of Childe
     Harold (those to my daughter) which I had not made up my mind
     whether to publish or not when they were first written (as you
     will see marked on the margin of the first copy), I had (and have)
     fully determined to publish with the rest of the Canto, as in the
     copy which you received by Mr. Shelley, before I sent it to
     England.

     "Our weather is very fine, which is more than the summer has
     been.--At Milan I shall expect to hear from you. Address either to
     Milan, poste restante, or by way of Geneva, to the care of Monsr.
     Hentsch, Banquier. I write these few lines in case my other letter
     should not reach you: I trust one of them will.

     "P.S. My best respects and regards to Mr. Gifford. Will you tell
     him it may perhaps be as well to put a short note to that part
     relating to Clarens, merely to say, that of course the
     description does not refer to that particular spot so much as to
     the command of scenery round it? I do not know that this is
     necessary, and leave it to Mr. G.'s choice, as my editor,--if he
     will allow me to call him so at this distance."

LETTER 249. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Milan, October 15. 1816.

     "I hear that Mr. Davies has arrived in England,--but that of some
     letters, &c., committed to his care by Mr. H., only half have
     been delivered. This intelligence naturally makes me feel a little
     anxious for mine, and amongst them for the MS., which I wished to
     have compared with the one sent by me through the hands of Mr.
     Shelley. I trust that it has arrived safely,--and indeed not less
     so, that some little crystals, &c., from Mont Blanc, for my
     daughter and my nieces, have reached their address. Pray have the
     goodness to ascertain from Mr. Davies that no accident (by
     custom-house or loss) has befallen them, and satisfy me on this
     point at your earliest convenience.

     "If I recollect rightly, you told me that Mr. Gifford had kindly
     undertaken to correct the press (at my request) during my
     absence--at least I hope so. It will add to my many obligations to
     that gentleman.

     "I wrote to you, on my way here, a short note, dated Martigny. Mr.
     Hobhouse and myself arrived here a few days ago, by the Simplon
     and Lago Maggiore route. Of course we visited the Borromean
     Islands, which are fine, but too artificial. The Simplon is
     magnificent in its nature and its art,--both God and man have done
     wonders,--to say nothing of the devil who must certainly have had a
     hand (or a hoof) in some of the rocks and ravines through and over
     which the works are carried.

     "Milan is striking--the cathedral superb. The city altogether
     reminds me of Seville, but a little inferior. We had heard divers
     bruits, and took precautions on the road, near the frontier,
     against some 'many worthy fellows (i.e. felons) that were out,' and
     had ransacked some preceding travellers, a few weeks ago, near
     Sesto,--or Cesto, I forget which,--of cash and raiment, besides
     putting them in bodily fear, and lodging about twenty slugs in the
     retreating part of a courier belonging to Mr. Hope. But we were not
     molested, and I do not think in any danger, except of making
     mistakes in the way of cocking and priming whenever we saw an old
     house, or an ill-looking thicket, and now and then suspecting the
     'true men,' who have very much the appearance of the thieves of
     other countries. What the thieves may look like, I know not, nor
     desire to know, for it seems they come upon you in bodies of thirty
     ('in buckram and Kendal green') at a time, so that voyagers have no
     great chance. It is something like poor dear Turkey in that
     respect, but not so good, for there you can have as great a body of
     rogues to match the regular banditti; but here the gens d'armes are
     said to be no great things, and as for one's own people, one can't
     carry them about like Robinson Crusoe with a gun on each shoulder.

     "I have been to the Ambrosian library--it is a fine
     collection--full of MSS. edited and unedited. I enclose you a list
     of the former recently published: these are matters for your
     literati. For me, in my simple way, I have been most delighted with
     a correspondence of letters, all original and amatory, between
     Lucretia Borgia and Cardinal Bembo, preserved there. I have
     pored over them and a lock of her hair, the prettiest and fairest
     imaginable--I never saw fairer--and shall go repeatedly to read the
     epistles over and over; and if I can obtain some of the hair by
     fair means, I shall try. I have already persuaded the librarian to
     promise me copies of the letters, and I hope he will not disappoint
     me. They are short, but very simple, sweet, and to the purpose;
     there are some copies of verses in Spanish also by her; the tress
     of her hair is long, and, as I said before, beautiful. The Brera
     gallery of paintings has some fine pictures, but nothing of a
     collection. Of painting I know nothing; but I like a Guercino--a
     picture of Abraham putting away Hagar and Ishmael--which seems to
     me natural and goodly. The Flemish school, such as I saw it in
     Flanders, I utterly detested, despised, and abhorred; it might be
     painting, but it was not nature; the Italian is pleasing, and their
     ideal very noble.

     "The Italians I have encountered here are very intelligent and
     agreeable. In a few days I am to meet Monti. By the way, I have
     just heard an anecdote of Beccaria, who published such admirable
     things against the punishment of death. As soon as his book was
     out, his servant (having read it, I presume) stole his watch; and
     his master, while correcting the press of a second edition, did all
     he could to have him hanged by way of advertisement.

     "I forgot to mention the triumphal arch begun by Napoleon, as a
     gate to this city. It is unfinished, but the part completed worthy
     of another age and the same country. The society here is very oddly
     carried on,--at the theatre, and the theatre only,--which answers
     to our opera. People meet there as at a rout, but in very small
     circles. From Milan I shall go to Venice. If you write, write to
     Geneva, as before--the letter will be forwarded.

     "Yours ever."

LETTER 250. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Milan, November 1. 1816.

     "I have recently written to you rather frequently but without any
     late answer. Mr. Hobhouse and myself set out for Venice in a few
     days; but you had better still address to me at Mr. Hentsch's,
     Banquier, Geneva; he will forward your letters.

     "I do not know whether I mentioned to you some time ago, that I had
     parted with the Dr. Polidori a few weeks previous to my leaving
     Diodati. I know no great harm of him; but he had an alacrity of
     getting into scrapes, and was too young and heedless; and having
     enough to attend to in my own concerns, and without time to become
     his tutor, I thought it much better to give him his congé. He
     arrived at Milan some weeks before Mr. Hobhouse and myself. About a
     week ago, in consequence of a quarrel at the theatre with an
     Austrian officer, in which he was exceedingly in the wrong, he has
     contrived to get sent out of the territory, and is gone to
     Florence. I was not present, the pit having been the scene of
     altercation; but on being sent for from the Cavalier Breme's box,
     where I was quietly staring at the ballet, I found the man of
     medicine begirt with grenadiers, arrested by the guard, conveyed
     into the guard-room, where there was much swearing in several
     languages. They were going to keep him there for the night; but on
     my giving my name, and answering for his apparition next morning,
     he was permitted egress. Next day he had an order from the
     government to be gone in twenty-four hours, and accordingly gone he
     is, some days ago. We did what we could for him, but to no purpose;
     and indeed he brought it upon himself, as far as I could learn, for
     I was not present at the squabble itself. I believe this is the
     real state of his case; and I tell it you because I believe things
     sometimes reach you in England in a false or exaggerated form. We
     found Milan very polite and hospitable[127], and have the same
     hopes of Verona and Venice. I have filled my paper.

     "Ever yours," &c.

[Footnote 127: With Milan, however, or its society, the noble traveller was far from being
pleased, and in his Memoranda, I recollect, he described his stay there to be "like a ship
under quarantine." Among other persons whom he met in the society of that place was M. Beyle,
the ingenious author of "L'Histoire de la Peinture en Italie," who thus describes the impression
their first interview left upon him:--

"Ce fut pendant l'automne de 1816, que je le rencontrai au théâtre de la Scala, à Milan, dans
la loge de M. Louis de Brême. Je fus frappé des yeux de Lord Byron au moment où il écoutait
un sestetto d'un opéra de Mayer intitulé Elena. Je n'ai vu de ma vie, rien de plus beau ni
de plus expressif. Encore aujourd'hui, si je viens à penser à l'expression qu'un grand peintre
devrait donner an génie, cette tête sublime reparaît tout-à-coup devant moi. J'eus un instant
d'enthousiasme, et oubliant la juste répugnance que tout homme un peu fier doit avoir à se
faire présenter à un pair d'Angleterre, je priai M. de Brême de m'introduire à Lord Byron,
je me trouvai le lendemain à dîner chez M. de Brême, avec lui, et le celèbre Monti, l'immortel
auteur de la Basvigliana. On parla poésie, on en vint à demander quels étaient les douze plus
beaux vers faits depuis un siècle, en Français, en Italien, en Anglais. Les Italiens présens
s'accordèrent à designer les douze premiers vers de la Mascheroniana de Monti, comme ce que
l'on avait fait de plus beau dans leur langue, depuis cent ans. Monti voulut bien nous les
réciter. Je regardai Lord Byron, il fut ravi. La nuance de hauteur, ou plutôt l'air d'un homme
qui se trouve avoir à repousser une importunité, qui déparait un peu sa belle figure, disparut
tout-à-coup pour faire à l'expression du bonheur. Le premier chant de la Mascheroniana, que
Monti récita presque en entier, vaincu par les acclamations des auditeurs, causa la plus vive
sensation à l'auteur de Childe Harold. Je n'oublierai jamais l'expression divine de ses traits;
c'était l'air serein de la puissance et du génie, et suivant moi, Lord Byron n'avait, en ce
moment, aucune affectation à se reprocher."]

LETTER 251. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Verona, November 6. 1816.

     "My dear Moore,

     "Your letter, written before my departure from England, and
     addressed to me in London, only reached me recently. Since that
     period, I have been over a portion of that part of Europe which I
     had not already seen. About a month since, I crossed the Alps from
     Switzerland to Milan, which I left a few days ago, and am thus far
     on my way to Venice, where I shall probably winter. Yesterday I was
     on the shores of the Benacus, with his fluctibus et fremitu.
     Catullus's Sirmium has still its name and site, and is remembered
     for his sake: but the very heavy autumnal rains and mists prevented
     our quitting our route, (that is, Hobhouse and myself, who are at
     present voyaging together,) as it was better not to see it at all
     than to a great disadvantage.

     "I found on the Benacus the same tradition of a city, still visible
     in calm weather below the waters, which you have preserved of Lough
     Neagh, 'When the clear, cold eve's declining.' I do not know that
     it is authorised by records; but they tell you such a story, and
     say that the city was swallowed up by an earthquake. We moved
     to-day over the frontier to Verona, by a road suspected of
     thieves,--'the wise convey it call,'--but without molestation. I
     shall remain here a day or two to gape at the usual
     marvels,--amphitheatre, paintings, and all that time-tax of
     travel,--though Catullus, Claudian, and Shakspeare have done more
     for Verona than it ever did for itself. They still pretend to
     show, I believe, the 'tomb of all the Capulets'--we shall see.

     "Among many things at Milan, one pleased me particularly, viz. the
     correspondence (in the prettiest love-letters in the world) of
     Lucretia Borgia with Cardinal Bembo, (who, you say, made a very
     good cardinal,) and a lock of her hair, and some Spanish verses of
     hers,--the lock very fair and beautiful. I took one single hair of
     it as a relic, and wished sorely to get a copy of one or two of the
     letters; but it is prohibited: that I don't mind; but it was
     impracticable; and so I only got some of them by heart. They are
     kept in the Ambrosian Library, which I often visited to look them
     over--to the scandal of the librarian, who wanted to enlighten me
     with sundry valuable MSS., classical, philosophical, and pious. But
     I stick to the Pope's daughter, and wish myself a cardinal.

     "I have seen the finest parts of Switzerland, the Rhine, the Rhone,
     and the Swiss and Italian lakes; for the beauties of which, I refer
     you to the Guidebook. The north of Italy is tolerably free from the
     English; but the south swarms with them, I am told. Madame de Staël
     I saw frequently at Copet, which she renders remarkably pleasant.
     She has been particularly kind to me. I was for some months her
     neighbour, in a country house called Diodati, which I had on the
     Lake of Geneva. My plans are very uncertain; but it is probable
     that you will see me in England in the spring. I have some business
     there. If you write to me, will you address to the care of Mons.
     Hentsch, Banquier, Geneva, who receives and forwards my letters.
     Remember me to Rogers, who wrote to me lately, with a short account
     of your poem, which, I trust, is near the light. He speaks of it
     most highly.

     "My health is very endurable, except that I am subject to casual
     giddiness and faintness, which is so like a fine lady, that I am
     rather ashamed of the disorder. When I sailed, I had a physician
     with me, whom, after some months of patience, I found it expedient
     to part with, before I left Geneva some time. On arriving at Milan,
     I found this gentleman in very good society, where he prospered for
     some weeks: but, at length, at the theatre he quarrelled with an
     Austrian officer, and was sent out by the government in twenty-four
     hours. I was not present at his squabble; but, on hearing that he
     was put under arrest, I went and got him out of his confinement,
     but could not prevent his being sent off, which, indeed, he partly
     deserved, being quite in the wrong, and having begun a row for
     row's sake. I had preceded the Austrian government some weeks
     myself, in giving him his congé from Geneva. He is not a bad
     fellow, but very young and hot-headed, and more likely to incur
     diseases than to cure them. Hobhouse and myself found it useless to
     intercede for him. This happened some time before we left Milan. He
     is gone to Florence.

     "At Milan I saw, and was visited by, Monti, the most celebrated of
     the living Italian poets. He seems near sixty; in face he is like
     the late Cooke the actor. His frequent changes in politics have
     made him very unpopular as a man. I saw many more of their
     literati; but none whose names are well known in England, except
     Acerbi. I lived much with the Italians, particularly with the
     Marquis of Breme's family, who are very able and intelligent men,
     especially the Abate. There was a famous improvvisatore who held
     forth while I was there. His fluency astonished me; but, although I
     understand Italian, and speak it (with more readiness than
     accuracy), I could only carry off a few very common-place
     mythological images, and one line about Artemisia, and another
     about Algiers, with sixty words of an entire tragedy about Etocles
     and Polynices. Some of the Italians liked him--others called his
     performance 'seccatura' (a devilish good word, by the way)--and all
     Milan was in controversy about him.

     "The state of morals in these parts is in some sort lax. A mother
     and son were pointed out at the theatre, as being pronounced by the
     Milanese world to be of the Theban dynasty--but this was all. The
     narrator (one of the first men in Milan) seemed to be not
     sufficiently scandalised by the taste or the tie. All society in
     Milan is carried on at the opera: they have private boxes, where
     they play at cards, or talk, or any thing else; but (except at the
     Cassino) there are no open houses, or balls, &c. &c.

     "The peasant girls have all very fine dark eyes, and many of them
     are beautiful. There are also two dead bodies in fine
     preservation--one Saint Carlo Boromeo, at Milan; the other not a
     saint, but a chief, named Visconti, at Monza--both of which
     appeared very agreeable. In one of the Boromean isles (the Isola
     bella), there is a large laurel--the largest known--on which
     Buonaparte, staying there just before the battle of Marengo, carved
     with his knife the word 'Battaglia.' I saw the letters, now half
     worn out and partly erased.

     "Excuse this tedious letter. To be tiresome is the privilege of old
     age and absence: I avail myself of the latter, and the former I
     have anticipated. If I do not speak to you of my own affairs, it is
     not from want of confidence, but to spare you and myself. My day is
     over--what then?--I have had it. To be sure, I have shortened it;
     and if I had done as much by this letter, it would have been as
     well. But you will forgive that, if not the other faults of

     "Yours ever and most affectionately,

     "B.

     "P.S. November 7. 1816.

     "I have been over Verona. The amphitheatre is wonderful--beats even
     Greece. Of the truth of Juliet's story they seem tenacious to a
     degree, insisting on the fact--giving a date (1303), and showing a
     tomb. It is a plain, open, and partly decayed sarcophagus, with
     withered leaves in it, in a wild and desolate conventual garden,
     once a cemetery, now ruined to the very graves. The situation
     struck me as very appropriate to the legend, being blighted as
     their love. I have brought away a few pieces of the granite, to
     give to my daughter and my nieces. Of the other marvels of this
     city, paintings, antiquities, &c., excepting the tombs of the
     Scaliger princes, I have no pretensions to judge. The gothic
     monuments of the Scaligers pleased me, but 'a poor virtuoso am I,'
     and ever yours."

       *       *       *       *       *

It must have been observed, in my account of Lord Byron's life previous to his marriage, that,
without leaving altogether unnoticed (what, indeed, was too notorious to be so evaded) certain
affairs of gallantry in which he had the reputation of being engaged, I have thought it right,
besides refraining from such details in my narrative, to suppress also whatever passages in
his Journals and Letters might be supposed to bear too personally or particularly on the same
delicate topics. Incomplete as the strange history of his mind and heart must, in one of its
most interesting chapters, be left by these omissions, still a deference to that peculiar sense
of decorum in this country, which marks the mention of such frailties as hardly a less crime
than the commission of them, and, still more, the regard due to the feelings of the living,
who ought not rashly to be made to suffer for the errors of the dead, have combined to render
this sacrifice, however much it may be regretted, necessary.

We have now, however, shifted the scene to a region where less caution is requisite;--where,
from the different standard applied to female morals in these respects, if the wrong itself
be not lessened by this diminution of the consciousness of it, less scruple may be, at least,
felt towards persons so circumstanced, and whatever delicacy we may think right to exercise
in speaking of their frailties must be with reference rather to our views and usages than theirs.

Availing myself, with this latter qualification, of the greater latitude thus allowed me, I
shall venture so far to depart from the plan hitherto pursued, as to give, with but little
suppression, the noble poet's letters relative to his Italian adventures. To throw a veil altogether
over these irregularities of his private life would be to afford--were it even practicable--but
a partial portraiture of his character; while, on the other hand, to rob him of the advantage
of being himself the historian of his errors (where no injury to others can flow from the disclosure)
would be to deprive him of whatever softening light can be thrown round such transgressions
by the vivacity and fancy, the passionate love of beauty, and the strong yearning after affection
which will be found to have, more or less, mingled with even the least refined of his attachments.
Neither is any great danger to be apprehended from the sanction or seduction of such an example;
as they who would dare to plead the authority of Lord Byron for their errors must first be
able to trace them to the same palliating sources,--to that sensibility, whose very excesses
showed its strength and depth,--that stretch of imagination, to the very verge, perhaps, of
what reason can bear without giving way,--that whole combination, in short, of grand but disturbing
powers, which alone could be allowed to extenuate such moral derangement, but which, even in
him thus dangerously gifted, were insufficient to excuse it.

Having premised these few observations, I shall now proceed, with less interruption, to lay
his correspondence, during this and the two succeeding years, before the reader:--

LETTER 252. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Venice, November 17. 1816.

     "I wrote to you from Verona the other day in my progress hither,
     which letter I hope you will receive. Some three years ago, or it
     may be more, I recollect your telling me that you had received a
     letter from our friend Sam, dated 'On board his gondola.' My
     gondola is, at this present, waiting for me on the canal; but I
     prefer writing to you in the house, it being autumn--and rather an
     English autumn than otherwise. It is my intention to remain at
     Venice during the winter, probably, as it has always been (next to
     the East) the greenest island of my imagination. It has not
     disappointed me; though its evident decay would, perhaps, have that
     effect upon others. But I have been familiar with ruins too long to
     dislike desolation. Besides, I have fallen in love, which, next to
     falling into the canal, (which would be of no use, as I can swim,)
     is the best or the worst thing I could do. I have got some
     extremely good apartments in the house of a 'Merchant of Venice,'
     who is a good deal occupied with business, and has a wife in her
     twenty-second year. Marianna (that is her name) is in her
     appearance altogether like an antelope. She has the large, black,
     oriental eyes, with that peculiar expression in them which is seen
     rarely among Europeans--even the Italians--and which many of the
     Turkish women give themselves by tinging the eyelid,--an art not
     known out of that country, I believe. This expression she has
     naturally,--and something more than this. In short, I cannot
     describe the effect of this kind of eye,--at least upon me. Her
     features are regular, and rather aquiline--mouth small--skin clear
     and soft, with a kind of hectic colour--forehead remarkably good:
     her hair is of the dark gloss, curl, and colour of Lady J * *'s:
     her figure is light and pretty, and she is a famous
     songstress--scientifically so; her natural voice (in conversation,
     I mean) is very sweet; and the naïveté of the Venetian dialect is
     always pleasing in the mouth of a woman.

     "November 23.

     "You will perceive that my description, which was proceeding with
     the minuteness of a passport, has been interrupted for several
     days.

     "December 5.

     "Since my former dates, I do not know that I have much to add on
     the subject, and, luckily, nothing to take away; for I am more
     pleased than ever with my Venetian, and begin to feel very serious
     on that point--so much so, that I shall be silent.

     "By way of divertisement, I am studying daily, at an Armenian
     monastery, the Armenian language. I found that my mind wanted
     something craggy to break upon; and this--as the most difficult
     thing I could discover here for an amusement--I have chosen, to
     torture me into attention. It is a rich language, however, and
     would amply repay any one the trouble of learning it. I try, and
     shall go on;--but I answer for nothing, least of all for my
     intentions or my success. There are some very curious MSS. in the
     monastery, as well as books; translations also from Greek
     originals, now lost, and from Persian and Syriac, &c.; besides
     works of their own people. Four years ago the French instituted an
     Armenian professorship. Twenty pupils presented themselves on
     Monday morning, full of noble ardour, ingenuous youth, and
     impregnable industry. They persevered, with a courage worthy of the
     nation and of universal conquest, till Thursday; when fifteen of
     the twenty succumbed to the six-and-twentieth letter of the
     alphabet. It is, to be sure, a Waterloo of an Alphabet--that must
     be said for them. But it is so like these fellows, to do by it as
     they did by their sovereigns--abandon both; to parody the old
     rhymes, 'Take a thing and give a thing'--'Take a king and give a
     king.' They are the worst of animals, except their conquerors.

     "I hear that H----n is your neighbour, having a living in
     Derbyshire. You will find him an excellent-hearted fellow, as well
     as one of the cleverest; a little, perhaps, too much japanned by
     preferment in the church and the tuition of youth, as well as
     inoculated with the disease of domestic felicity, besides being
     over-run with fine feelings about woman and constancy (that small
     change of Love, which people exact so rigidly, receive in such
     counterfeit coin, and repay in baser metal); but, otherwise, a very
     worthy man, who has lately got a pretty wife, and (I suppose) a
     child by this time. Pray remember me to him, and say that I know
     not which to envy most his neighbourhood--him, or you.

     "Of Venice I shall say little. You must have seen many
     descriptions; and they are most of them like. It is a poetical
     place; and classical, to us, from Shakspeare and Otway. I have not
     yet sinned against it in verse, nor do I know that I shall do so,
     having been tuneless since I crossed the Alps, and feeling, as yet,
     no renewal of the 'estro.' By the way, I suppose you have seen
     'Glenarvon.' Madame de Staël lent it me to read from Copet last
     autumn. It seems to me that if the authoress had written the
     truth, and nothing but the truth--the whole truth--the romance
     would not only have been more romantic, but more entertaining. As
     for the likeness, the picture can't be good--I did not sit long
     enough. When you have leisure, let me hear from and of you,
     believing me ever and truly yours most affectionately, B.

     "P.S. Oh! your poem--is it out? I hope Longman has paid his
     thousands: but don't you do as H * * T * *'s father did, who,
     having made money by a quarto tour, became a vinegar merchant;
     when, lo! his vinegar turned sweet (and be d----d to it) and ruined
     him. My last letter to you (from Verona) was enclosed to
     Murray--have you got it? Direct to me here, poste restante. There
     are no English here at present. There were several in
     Switzerland--some women; but, except Lady Dalrymple Hamilton, most
     of them as ugly as virtue--at least, those that I saw."

LETTER 253. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Venice, December 24. 1816.

     "I have taken a fit of writing to you, which portends postage--once
     from Verona--once from Venice, and again from Venice--thrice that
     is. For this you may thank yourself, for I heard that you
     complained of my silence--so, here goes for garrulity.

     "I trust that you received my other twain of letters. My 'way of
     life' (or 'May of life,' which is it, according to the
     commentators?)--my 'way of life' is fallen into great regularity.
     In the mornings I go over in my gondola to babble Armenian with the
     friars of the convent of St. Lazarus, and to help one of them in
     correcting the English of an English and Armenian grammar which he
     is publishing. In the evenings I do one of many nothings--either at
     the theatres, or some of the conversaziones, which are like our
     routs, or rather worse, for the women sit in a semicircle by the
     lady of the mansion, and the men stand about the room. To be sure,
     there is one improvement upon ours--instead of lemonade with their
     ices, they hand about stiff rum-punch--punch, by my palate; and
     this they think English. I would not disabuse them of so
     agreeable an error,--'no, not for Venice.'

     "Last night I was at the Count Governor's, which, of course,
     comprises the best society, and is very much like other gregarious
     meetings in every country,--as in ours,--except that, instead of
     the Bishop of Winchester, you have the Patriarch of Venice, and a
     motley crew of Austrians, Germans, noble Venetians, foreigners,
     and, if you see a quiz, you may be sure he is a Consul. Oh, by the
     way, I forgot, when I wrote from Verona, to tell you that at Milan
     I met with a countryman of yours--a Colonel * * * *, a very
     excellent, good-natured fellow, who knows and shows all about
     Milan, and is, as it were, a native there. He is particularly civil
     to strangers, and this is his history,--at least, an episode of it.

     "Six-and-twenty years ago, Col. * * * *, then an ensign, being in
     Italy, fell in love with the Marchesa * * * *, and she with him.
     The lady must be, at least, twenty years his senior. The war broke
     out; he returned to England, to serve--not his country, for that's
     Ireland--but England, which is a different thing; and she--heaven
     knows what she did. In the year 1814, the first annunciation of the
     Definitive Treaty of Peace (and tyranny) was developed to the
     astonished Milanese by the arrival of Col. * * * *, who, flinging
     himself full length at the feet of Mad. * * * *, murmured forth, in
     half-forgotten Irish Italian, eternal vows of indelible constancy.
     The lady screamed, and exclaimed, 'Who are you?' The Colonel cried,
     'What! don't you know me? I am so and so,' &c. &c. &c.; till, at
     length, the Marchesa, mounting from reminiscence to reminiscence,
     through the lovers of the intermediate twenty-five years, arrived
     at last at the recollection of her povero sub-lieutenant. She
     then said, 'Was there ever such virtue?' (that was her very word)
     and, being now a widow, gave him apartments in her palace,
     reinstated him in all the rights of wrong, and held him up to the
     admiring world as a miracle of incontinent fidelity, and the
     unshaken Abdiel of absence.

     "Methinks this is as pretty a moral tale as any of Marmontel's.
     Here is another. The same lady, several years ago, made an escapade
     with a Swede, Count Fersen (the same whom the Stockholm mob
     quartered and lapidated not very long since), and they arrived at
     an Osteria on the road to Rome or thereabouts. It was a summer
     evening, and, while they were at supper, they were suddenly regaled
     by a symphony of fiddles in an adjacent apartment, so prettily
     played, that, wishing to hear them more distinctly, the Count rose,
     and going into the musical society, said, 'Gentlemen, I am sure
     that, as a company of gallant cavaliers, you will be delighted to
     show your skill to a lady, who feels anxious,' &c. &c. The men of
     harmony were all acquiescence--every instrument was tuned and
     toned, and, striking up one of their most ambrosial airs, the whole
     band followed the Count to the lady's apartment. At their head was
     the first fiddler, who, bowing and fiddling at the same moment,
     headed his troop and advanced up the room. Death and discord!--it
     was the Marquis himself, who was on a serenading party in the
     country, while his spouse had run away from town. The rest may be
     imagined--but, first of all, the lady tried to persuade him that
     she was there on purpose to meet him, and had chosen this method
     for an harmonic surprise. So much for this gossip, which amused me
     when I heard it, and I send it to you, in the hope it may have the
     like effect. Now we'll return to Venice.

     "The day after to-morrow (to-morrow being Christmas-day) the
     Carnival begins. I dine with the Countess Albrizzi and a party, and
     go to the opera. On that day the Phenix, (not the Insurance Office,
     but) the theatre of that name, opens: I have got me a box there for
     the season, for two reasons, one of which is, that the music is
     remarkably good. The Contessa Albrizzi, of whom I have made
     mention, is the De Staël of Venice, not young, but a very learned,
     unaffected, good-natured woman, very polite to strangers, and, I
     believe, not at all dissolute, as most of the women are. She has
     written very well on the works of Canova, and also a volume of
     Characters, besides other printed matter. She is of Corfu, but
     married a dead Venetian--that is, dead since he married.

     "My flame (my 'Donna' whom I spoke of in my former epistle, my
     Marianna) is still my Marianna, and I, her--what she pleases. She
     is by far the prettiest woman I have seen here, and the most
     loveable I have met with any where--as well as one of the most
     singular. I believe I told you the rise and progress of our
     liaison in my former letter. Lest that should not have reached
     you, I will merely repeat, that she is a Venetian, two-and-twenty
     years old, married to a merchant well to do in the world, and that
     she has great black oriental eyes, and all the qualities which her
     eyes promise. Whether being in love with her has steeled me or not,
     I do not know; but I have not seen many other women who seem
     pretty. The nobility, in particular, are a sad-looking race--the
     gentry rather better. And now, what art thou doing?

        "What are you doing now,
          Oh Thomas Moore?

     Are you not near the Luddites? By the Lord! if there's a row, but
     I'll be among ye! How go on the weavers--the breakers of
     frames--the Lutherans of politics--the reformers?

        "As the Liberty lads o'er the sea
        Bought their freedom, and cheaply, with blood,
                  So we, boys, we
          Will die fighting, or live free,
        And down with all kings but King Ludd!

        "When the web that we weave is complete,
        And the shuttle exchanged for the sword,
          We will fling the winding-sheet
          O'er the despot at our feet,
        And dye it deep in the gore he has pour'd.

        "Though black as his heart its hue,
        Since his veins are corrupted to mud,
                  Yet this is the dew
          Which the tree shall renew
        Of Liberty, planted by Ludd!

     "There's an amiable chanson for you--all impromptu. I have
     written it principally to shock your neighbour * * * *, who is all
     clergy and loyalty--mirth and innocence--milk and water.

        "But the Carnival's coming,
          Oh Thomas Moore,
        The Carnival's coming,
          Oh Thomas Moore,
        Masking and humming,
        Fifing and drumming,
        Guitarring and strumming,
          Oh Thomas Moore.

     The other night I saw a new play,--and the author. The subject was
     the sacrifice of Isaac. The play succeeded, and they called for the
     author--according to continental custom--and he presented himself,
     a noble Venetian, Mali, or Malapiero, by name. Mala was his name,
     and pessima his production,--at least, I thought so, and I ought
     to know, having read more or less of five hundred Drury Lane
     offerings, during my coadjutorship with the sub-and-super
     Committee.

     "When does your poem of poems come out? As for me, he's
     welcome--I shall never think less of J * * for any thing he may say
     against me or mine in future.

     "I suppose Murray has sent you, or will send (for I do not know
     whether they are out or no) the poem, or poesies, of mine, of last
     summer. By the mass! they are sublime--'Ganion Coheriza'--gainsay
     who dares! Pray, let me hear from you, and of you, and, at least,
     let me know that you have received these three letters. Direct,
     right here, poste restante.

     "Ever and ever, &c.

     "P.S. I heard the other day of a pretty trick of a bookseller, who
     has published some d----d nonsense, swearing the bastards to me,
     and saying he gave me five hundred guineas for them. He lies--never
     wrote such stuff, never saw the poems, nor the publisher of them,
     in my life, nor had any communication, directly or indirectly, with
     the fellow. Pray say as much for me, if need be. I have written to
     Murray, to make him contradict the impostor."

LETTER 254. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, November 25. 1816.

     "It is some months since I have heard from or of you--I think, not
     since I left Diodati. From Milan I wrote once or twice; but have
     been here some little time, and intend to pass the winter without
     removing. I was much pleased with the Lago di Garda, and with
     Verona, particularly the amphitheatre, and a sarcophagus in a
     convent garden, which they show as Juliet's: they insist on the
     truth of her history. Since my arrival at Venice, the lady of the
     Austrian governor told me that between Verona and Vicenza there are
     still ruins of the castle of the Montecchi, and a chapel once
     appertaining to the Capulets. Romeo seems to have been of Vicenza
     by the tradition; but I was a good deal surprised to find so firm a
     faith in Bandello's novel, which seems really to have been founded
     on a fact.

     "Venice pleases me as much as I expected, and I expected much. It
     is one of those places which I know before I see them, and has
     always haunted me the most after the East. I like the gloomy gaiety
     of their gondolas, and the silence of their canals. I do not even
     dislike the evident decay of the city, though I regret the
     singularity of its vanished costume; however, there is much left
     still; the Carnival, too, is coming.

     "St. Mark's, and indeed Venice, is most alive at night. The
     theatres are not open till nine, and the society is
     proportionably late. All this is to my taste, but most of your
     countrymen miss and regret the rattle of hackney coaches, without
     which they can't sleep.

     "I have got remarkably good apartments in a private house; I see
     something of the inhabitants (having had a good many letters to
     some of them); I have got my gondola; I read a little, and luckily
     could speak Italian (more fluently than correctly) long ago, I am
     studying, out of curiosity, the Venetian dialect, which is very
     naïve, and soft, and peculiar, though not at all classical; I go
     out frequently, and am in very good contentment.

     "The Helen of Canova (a bust which is in the house of Madame the
     Countess d'Albrizzi, whom I know) is, without exception, to my
     mind, the most perfectly beautiful of human conceptions, and far
     beyond my ideas of human execution.

        "In this beloved marble view,
          Above the works and thoughts of man,
        What Nature could, but would not, do,
          And Beauty and Canova can!
        Beyond imagination's power,
          Beyond the bard's defeated art,
        With immortality her dower,
          Behold the Helen of the heart!

     "Talking of the 'heart' reminds me that I have fallen in
     love--fathomless love; but lest you should make some splendid
     mistake, and envy me the possession of some of those princesses or
     countesses with whose affections your English voyagers are apt to
     invest themselves, I beg leave to tell you that my goddess is only
     the wife of a 'Merchant of Venice;' but then she is pretty as an
     antelope, is but two-and-twenty years old, has the large, black,
     oriental eyes, with the Italian countenance, and dark glossy hair,
     of the curl and colour of Lady J * *'s. Then she has the voice of a
     lute, and the song of a seraph (though not quite so sacred),
     besides a long postscript of graces, virtues, and accomplishments,
     enough to furnish out a new chapter for Solomon's Song. But her
     great merit is finding out mine--there is nothing so amiable as
     discernment.

     "The general race of women appear to be handsome; but in Italy, as
     on almost all the Continent, the highest orders are by no means a
     well-looking generation, and indeed reckoned by their countrymen
     very much otherwise. Some are exceptions, but most of them as ugly
     as Virtue herself.

     "If you write, address to me here, poste restante, as I shall
     probably stay the winter over. I never see a newspaper, and know
     nothing of England, except in a letter now and then from my sister.
     Of the MS. sent you, I know nothing, except that you have received
     it, and are to publish it, &c. &c.: but when, where, and how, you
     leave me to guess; but it don't much matter.

     "I suppose you have a world of works passing through your process
     for next year? When does Moore's poem appear? I sent a letter for
     him, addressed to your care, the other day."

LETTER 255. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, December 4, 1816.

     "I have written to you so frequently of late, that you will think
     me a bore; as I think you a very impolite person, for not answering
     my letters from Switzerland, Milan, Verona, and Venice. There are
     some things I wanted, and want, to know, viz. whether Mr. Davies,
     of inaccurate memory, had or had not delivered the MS. as delivered
     to him; because, if he has not, you will find that he will
     bountifully bestow transcriptions on all the curious of his
     acquaintance, in which case you may probably find your publication
     anticipated by the 'Cambridge' or other Chronicles. In the next
     place,--I forget what was next; but in the third place, I want to
     hear whether you have yet published, or when you mean to do so, or
     why you have not done so, because in your last (Sept. 20th,--you
     may be ashamed of the date), you talked of this being done
     immediately.

     "From England I hear nothing, and know nothing of any thing or any
     body. I have but one correspondent (except Mr. Kinnaird on business
     now and then), and her a female; so that I know no more of your
     island, or city, than the Italian version of the French papers
     chooses to tell me, or the advertisements of Mr. Colburn tagged to
     the end of your Quarterly Review for the year ago. I wrote to you
     at some length last week, and have little to add, except that I
     have begun, and am proceeding in, a study of the Armenian language,
     which I acquire, as well as I can, at the Armenian convent, where I
     go every day to take lessons of a learned friar, and have gained
     some singular and not useless information with regard to the
     literature and customs of that oriental people. They have an
     establishment here--a church and convent of ninety monks, very
     learned and accomplished men, some of them. They have also a press,
     and make great efforts for the enlightening of their nation. I find
     the language (which is twin, the literal and the vulgar)
     difficult, but not invincible (at least I hope not). I shall go on.
     I found it necessary to twist my mind round some severer study,
     and this, as being the hardest I could devise here, will be a file
     for the serpent.

     "I mean to remain here till the spring, so address to me directly
     to Venice, poste restante.--Mr. Hobhouse, for the present, is
     gone to Rome, with his brother, brother's wife, and sister, who
     overtook him here: he returns in two months. I should have gone
     too, but I fell in love, and must stay that over. I should think
     that and the Armenian alphabet will last the winter. The lady
     has, luckily for me, been less obdurate than the language, or,
     between the two, I should have lost my remains of sanity. By the
     way, she is not an Armenian but a Venetian, as I believe I told you
     in my last. As for Italian, I am fluent enough, even in its
     Venetian modification, which is something like the Somersetshire
     version of English; and as for the more classical dialects, I had
     not forgot my former practice much during my voyaging.

     "Yours, ever and truly,

LETTER 256. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, Dec. 9. 1816.

     "In a letter from England, I am informed that a man named Johnson
     has taken upon himself to publish some poems called a 'Pilgrimage
     to Jerusalem, a Tempest, and an Address to my Daughter,' &c., and
     to attribute them to me, adding that he had paid five hundred
     guineas for them. The answer to this is short: I never wrote such
     poems, never received the sum he mentions, nor any other in the
     same quarter, nor (as far as moral or mortal certainty can be
     sure) ever had, directly or indirectly, the slightest
     communication with Johnson in my life; not being aware that the
     person existed till this intelligence gave me to understand that
     there were such people. Nothing surprises me, or this perhaps
     would, and most things amuse me, or this probably would not.
     With regard to myself, the man has merely lied; that's natural;
     his betters have set him the example. But with regard to you, his
     assertion may perhaps injure you in your publications; and I desire
     that it may receive the most public and unqualified contradiction.
     I do not know that there is any punishment for a thing of this
     kind, and if there were, I should not feel disposed to pursue this
     ingenious mountebank farther than was necessary for his
     confutation; but thus far it may be necessary to proceed.

     "You will make what use you please of this letter; and Mr.
     Kinnaird, who has power to act for me in my absence, will, I am
     sure, readily join you in any steps which it may be proper to take
     with regard to the absurd falsehood of this poor creature. As you
     will have recently received several letters from me on my way to
     Venice, as well as two written since my arrival, I will not at
     present trouble you further.

     "Ever, &c.

     "P.S. Pray let me hear that you have received this letter. Address
     to Venice, poste restante.

     "To prevent the recurrence of similar fabrications, you may state,
     that I consider myself responsible for no publication from the year
     1812 up to the present date which is not from your press. I speak
     of course from that period, because, previously, Cawthorn and Ridge
     had both printed compositions of mine. 'A Pilgrimage to Jerusalem!'
     How the devil should I write about Jerusalem, never having yet
     been there? As for 'A Tempest,' it was not a tempest when I
     left England, but a very fresh breeze: and as to an 'Address to
     little Ada,' (who, by the way, is a year old to-morrow,) I never
     wrote a line about her, except in 'Farewell' and the third Canto of
     Childe Harold."

LETTER 257. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, Dec. 27. 1816.

     "As the demon of silence seems to have possessed you, I am
     determined to have my revenge in postage; this is my sixth or
     seventh letter since summer and Switzerland. My last was an
     injunction to contradict and consign to confusion that Cheapside
     impostor, who (I heard by a letter from your island) had thought
     proper to append my name to his spurious poesy, of which I know
     nothing, nor of his pretended purchase or copyright. I hope you
     have, at least, received that letter.

     "As the news of Venice must be very interesting to you, I will
     regale you with it.

     "Yesterday being the feast of St. Stephen, every mouth was put in
     motion. There was nothing but fiddling and playing on the
     virginals, and all kinds of conceits and divertissements, on every
     canal of this aquatic city. I dined with the Countess Albrizzi and
     a Paduan and Venetian party, and afterwards went to the opera, at
     the Fenice theatre (which opens for the Carnival on that day),--the
     finest, by the way, I have ever seen: it beats our theatres hollow
     in beauty and scenery, and those of Milan and Brescia bow before
     it. The opera and its sirens were much like other operas and women,
     but the subject of the said opera was something edifying; it
     turned--the plot and conduct thereof--upon a fact narrated by Livy
     of a hundred and fifty married ladies having poisoned a hundred and
     fifty husbands in good old times. The bachelors of Rome believed
     this extraordinary mortality to be merely the common effect of
     matrimony or a pestilence; but the surviving Benedicts, being all
     seized with the cholic, examined into the matter, and found that
     'their possets had been drugged;' the consequence of which was,
     much scandal and several suits at law. This is really and truly the
     subject of the musical piece at the Fenice; and you can't conceive
     what pretty things are sung and recitativoed about the horrenda
     strage. The conclusion was a lady's head about to be chopped off
     by a lictor, but (I am sorry to say) he left it on, and she got up
     and sung a trio with the two Consuls, the Senate in the back-ground
     being chorus. The ballet was distinguished by nothing remarkable,
     except that the principal she-dancer went into convulsions because
     she was not applauded on her first appearance; and the manager came
     forward to ask if there was 'ever a physician in the theatre.'
     There was a Greek one in my box, whom I wished very much to
     volunteer his services, being sure that in this case these would
     have been the last convulsions which would have troubled the
     ballarina; but he would not. The crowd was enormous, and in coming
     out, having a lady under my arm, I was obliged, in making way,
     almost to 'beat a Venetian and traduce the state,' being compelled
     to regale a person with an English punch in the guts, which sent
     him as far back as the squeeze and the passage would admit. He did
     not ask for another, but, with great signs of disapprobation and
     dismay, appealed to his compatriots, who laughed at him.

     "I am going on with my Armenian studies in a morning, and assisting
     and stimulating in the English portion of an English and Armenian
     grammar, now publishing at the convent of St. Lazarus.

     "The superior of the friars is a bishop, and a fine old fellow,
     with the beard of a meteor. Father Paschal is also a learned and
     pious soul. He was two years in England.

     "I am still dreadfully in love with the Adriatic lady whom I spake
     of in a former letter, (and not in this--I add, for fear of
     mistakes, for the only one mentioned in the first part of this
     epistle is elderly and bookish, two things which I have ceased to
     admire,) and love in this part of the world is no sinecure. This is
     also the season when every body make up their intrigues for the
     ensuing year, and cut for partners for the next deal.

     "And now, if you don't write, I don't know what I won't say or do,
     nor what I will. Send me some news--good news. Yours very truly,
     &c. &c. &c.

     "B.

     "P.S. Remember me to Mr. Gifford, with all duty.

     "I hear that the Edinburgh Review has cut up Coleridge's
     Christabel, and me for praising it, which omen, I think, bodes no
     great good to your forthcome or coming Canto and Castle (of
     Chillon). My run of luck within the last year seems to have taken a
     turn every way; but never mind, I will bring myself through in the
     end--if not, I can be but where I began. In the mean time, I am not
     displeased to be where I am--I mean, at Venice. My Adriatic nymph
     is this moment here, and I must therefore repose from this letter."

LETTER 258. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, Jan. 2. 1817.

     "Your letter has arrived. Pray, in publishing the third Canto, have
     you omitted any passages? I hope not; and indeed wrote to you
     on my way over the Alps to prevent such an incident. Say in your
     next whether or not the whole of the Canto (as sent to you) has
     been published. I wrote to you again the other day, (twice, I
     think,) and shall be glad to hear of the reception of those
     letters.

     "To-day is the 2d of January. On this day three years ago The
     Corsair's publication is dated, I think, in my letter to Moore. On
     this day two years I married, ('Whom the Lord loveth he
     chasteneth,'--I sha'n't forget the day in a hurry,) and it is odd
     enough that I this day received a letter from you announcing the
     publication of Childe Harold, &c. &c. on the day of the date of
     'The Corsair;' and I also received one from my sister, written on
     the 10th of December, my daughter's birth-day (and relative chiefly
     to my daughter), and arriving on the day of the date of my
     marriage, this present 2d of January, the month of my birth,--and
     various other astrologous matters, which I have no time to
     enumerate.

     "By the way, you might as well write to Hentsch, my Geneva banker,
     and enquire whether the two packets consigned to his care were or
     were not delivered to Mr. St. Aubyn, or if they are still in his
     keeping. One contains papers, letters, and all the original MS. of
     your third Canto, as first conceived; and the other, some bones
     from the field of Morat. Many thanks for your news, and the good
     spirits in which your letter is written.

     "Venice and I agree very well; but I do not know that I have any
     thing new to say, except of the last new opera, which I sent in my
     late letter. The Carnival is commencing, and there is a good deal
     of fun here and there--besides business; for all the world are
     making up their intrigues for the season, changing, or going on
     upon a renewed lease. I am very well off with Marianna, who is not
     at all a person to tire me; firstly, because I do not tire of a
     woman personally, but because they are generally bores in their
     disposition; and, secondly, because she is amiable, and has a tact
     which is not always the portion of the fair creation; and, thirdly,
     she is very pretty; and, fourthly--but there is no occasion for
     further specification. So far we have gone on very well; as to the
     future, I never anticipate--carpe diem--the past at least is
     one's own, which is one reason for making sure of the present. So
     much for my proper liaison.

     "The general state of morals here is much the same as in the Doges'
     time; a woman is virtuous (according to the code) who limits
     herself to her husband and one lover; those who have two, three, or
     more, are a little wild; but it is only those who are
     indiscriminately diffuse, and form a low connection, such as the
     Princess of Wales with her courier, (who, by the way, is made a
     knight of Malta,) who are considered as overstepping the modesty of
     marriage. In Venice, the nobility have a trick of marrying with
     dancers and singers; and, truth to say, the women of their own
     order are by no means handsome; but the general race, the women of
     the second and other orders, the wives of the merchants, and
     proprietors, and untitled gentry, are mostly bel' sangue, and it
     is with these that the more amatory connections are usually formed.
     There are also instances of stupendous constancy. I know a woman of
     fifty who never had but one lover, who dying early, she became
     devout, renouncing all but her husband. She piques herself, as may
     be presumed, upon this miraculous fidelity, talking of it
     occasionally with a species of misplaced morality, which is rather
     amusing. There is no convincing a woman here that she is in the
     smallest degree deviating from the rule of right or the fitness of
     things in having an amoroso. The great sin seems to lie in
     concealing it, or having more than one, that is, unless such an
     extension of the prerogative is understood and approved of by the
     prior claimant.

     "In another sheet, I send you some sheets of a grammar, English and
     Armenian, for the use of the Armenians, of which I promoted, and
     indeed induced, the publication. (It cost me but a thousand
     francs--French livres.) I still pursue my lessons in the language
     without any rapid progress, but advancing a little daily. Padre
     Paschal, with some little help from me, as translator of his
     Italian into English, is also proceeding in a MS. Grammar for the
     English acquisition of Armenian, which will be printed also, when
     finished.

     "We want to know if there are any Armenian types and letter-press
     in England, at Oxford, Cambridge, or elsewhere? You know, I
     suppose, that, many years ago, the two Whistons published in
     England an original text of a history of Armenia, with their own
     Latin translation? Do those types still exist? and where? Pray
     enquire among your learned acquaintance.

     "When this Grammar (I mean the one now printing) is done, will you
     have any objection to take forty or fifty copies, which will not
     cost in all above five or ten guineas, and try the curiosity of the
     learned with a sale of them? Say yes or no, as you like. I can
     assure you that they have some very curious books and MSS., chiefly
     translations from Greek originals now lost. They are, besides, a
     much respected and learned community, and the study of their
     language was taken up with great ardour by some literary Frenchmen
     in Buonaparte's time.

     "I have not done a stitch of poetry since I left Switzerland, and
     have not, at present, the estro upon me. The truth is, that you
     are afraid of having a fourth Canto before September, and of
     another copyright, but I have at present no thoughts of resuming
     that poem, nor of beginning any other. If I write, I think of
     trying prose, but I dread introducing living people, or
     applications which might be made to living people. Perhaps one day
     or other I may attempt some work of fancy in prose, descriptive of
     Italian manners and of human passions; but at present I am
     preoccupied. As for poesy, mine is the dream of the sleeping
     passions; when they are awake, I cannot speak their language, only
     in their somnambulism, and just now they are not dormant.

     "If Mr. Gifford wants carte blanche as to The Siege of Corinth,
     he has it, and may do as he likes with it.

     "I sent you a letter contradictory of the Cheapside man (who
     invented the story you speak of) the other day. My best respects to
     Mr. Gifford, and such of my friends as you may see at your house. I
     wish you all prosperity and new year's gratulation, and am

     "Yours," &c.

       *       *       *       *       *

To the Armenian Grammar, mentioned in the foregoing letter, the following interesting fragment,
found among his papers, seems to have been intended as a Preface:--

"The English reader will probably be surprised to find my name associated with a work of the
present description, and inclined to give me more credit for my attainments as a linguist than
they deserve.

"As I would not willingly be guilty of a deception, I will state, as shortly as I can, my own
share in the compilation, with the motives which led to it. On my arrival at Venice, in the
year 1816, I found my mind in a state which required study, and study of a nature which should
leave little scope for the imagination, and furnish some difficulty in the pursuit.

"At this period I was much struck--in common, I believe, with every other traveller--with the
society of the Convent of St. Lazarus, which appears to unite all the advantages of the monastic
institution, without any of its vices.

"The neatness, the comfort, the gentleness, the unaffected devotion, the accomplishments, and
the virtues of the brethren of the order, are well fitted to strike the man of the world with
the conviction that 'there is another and a better' even in this life.

"These men are the priesthood of an oppressed and a noble nation, which has partaken of the
proscription and bondage of the Jews and of the Greeks, without the sullenness of the former
or the servility of the latter. This people has attained riches without usury, and all the
honours that can be awarded to slavery without intrigue. But they have long occupied, nevertheless,
a part of 'the House of Bondage,' who has lately multiplied her many mansions. It would be
difficult, perhaps, to find the annals of a nation less stained with crimes than those of the
Armenians, whose virtues have been those of peace, and their vices those of compulsion. But
whatever may have been their destiny--and it has been bitter--whatever it may be in future,
their country must ever be one of the most interesting on the globe; and perhaps their language
only requires to be more studied to become more attractive. If the Scriptures are rightly understood,
it was in Armenia that Paradise was placed--Armenia, which has paid as dearly as the descendants
of Adam for that fleeting participation of its soil in the happiness of him who was created
from its dust. It was in Armenia that the flood first abated, and the dove alighted. But with
the disappearance of Paradise itself may be dated almost the unhappiness of the country; for
though long a powerful kingdom, it was scarcely ever an independent one, and the satraps of
Persia and the pachas of Turkey have alike desolated the region where God created man in his
own image."

LETTER 259. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Venice, January 28. 1817.

     "Your letter of the 8th is before me. The remedy for your plethora
     is simple--abstinence. I was obliged to have recourse to the like
     some years ago, I mean in point of diet, and, with the exception
     of some convivial weeks and days, (it might be months, now and
     then,) have kept to Pythagoras ever since. For all this, let me
     hear that you are better. You must not indulge in 'filthy
     beer,' nor in porter, nor eat suppers--the last are the devil to
     those who swallow dinner.

     "I am truly sorry to hear of your father's misfortune--cruel at any
     time, but doubly cruel in advanced life. However, you will, at
     least, have the satisfaction of doing your part by him, and depend
     upon it, it will not be in vain. Fortune, to be sure, is a female,
     but not such a b * * as the rest (always excepting your wife and my
     sister from such sweeping terms); for she generally has some
     justice in the long run. I have no spite against her, though
     between her and Nemesis I have had some sore gauntlets to run--but
     then I have done my best to deserve no better. But to you, she is
     a good deal in arrear, and she will come round--mind if she don't:
     you have the vigour of life, of independence, of talent, spirit,
     and character all with you. What you can do for yourself, you have
     done and will do; and surely there are some others in the world who
     would not be sorry to be of use, if you would allow them to be
     useful, or at least attempt it.

     "I think of being in England in the spring. If there is a row, by
     the sceptre of King Ludd, but I'll be one; and if there is none,
     and only a continuance of 'this meek, piping time of peace,' I will
     take a cottage a hundred yards to the south of your abode, and
     become your neighbour; and we will compose such canticles, and hold
     such dialogues, as shall be the terror of the Times (including
     the newspaper of that name), and the wonder, and honour, and
     praise of the Morning Chronicle and posterity.

     "I rejoice to hear of your forthcoming in February--though I
     tremble for the 'magnificence' which you attribute to the new
     Childe Harold. I am glad you like it; it is a fine indistinct piece
     of poetical desolation, and my favourite. I was half mad during the
     time of its composition, between metaphysics, mountains, lakes,
     love unextinguishable, thoughts unutterable, and the night-mare of
     my own delinquencies. I should, many a good day, have blown my
     brains out, but for the recollection that it would have given
     pleasure to my mother-in-law; and, even then, if I could have
     been certain to haunt her--but I won't dwell upon these trifling
     family matters.

     "Venice is in the estro of her carnival, and I have been up these
     last two nights at the ridotto and the opera, and all that kind of
     thing. Now for an adventure. A few days ago a gondolier brought me
     a billet without a subscription, intimating a wish on the part of
     the writer to meet me either in gondola, or at the island of San
     Lazaro, or at a third rendezvous, indicated in the note. 'I know
     the country's disposition well'--in Venice 'they do let Heaven see
     those tricks they dare not show,' &c. &c.; so, for all response, I
     said that neither of the three places suited me; but that I would
     either be at home at ten at night alone, or be at the ridotto at
     midnight, where the writer might meet me masked. At ten o'clock I
     was at home and alone (Marianna was gone with her husband to a
     conversazione), when the door of my apartment opened, and in
     walked a well-looking and (for an Italian) bionda girl of about
     nineteen, who informed me that she was married to the brother of my
     amorosa, and wished to have some conversation with me. I made a
     decent reply, and we had some talk in Italian and Romaic (her
     mother being a Greek of Corfu), when lo! in a very few minutes in
     marches, to my very great astonishment, Marianna S * *, in propriâ
     personâ, and after making a most polite courtesy to her
     sister-in-law and to me, without a single word seizes her said
     sister-in-law by the hair, and bestows upon her some sixteen slaps,
     which would have made your ear ache only to hear their echo. I need
     not describe the screaming which ensued. The luckless visiter took
     flight. I seized Marianna, who, after several vain efforts to get
     away in pursuit of the enemy, fairly went into fits in my arms;
     and, in spite of reasoning, eau de Cologne, vinegar, half a pint of
     water, and God knows what other waters beside, continued so till
     past midnight.

     "After damning my servants for letting people in without apprizing
     me, I found that Marianna in the morning had seen her
     sister-in-law's gondolier on the stairs, and, suspecting that his
     apparition boded her no good, had either returned of her own
     accord, or been followed by her maids or some other spy of her
     people to the conversazione, from whence she returned to perpetrate
     this piece of pugilism. I had seen fits before, and also some small
     scenery of the same genus in and out of our island: but this was
     not all. After about an hour, in comes--who? why, Signor S * *, her
     lord and husband, and finds me with his wife fainting upon a sofa,
     and all the apparatus of confusion, dishevelled hair, hats,
     handkerchiefs, salts, smelling bottles--and the lady as pale as
     ashes, without sense or motion. His first question was, 'What is
     all this?' The lady could not reply--so I did. I told him the
     explanation was the easiest thing in the world; but in the mean
     time it would be as well to recover his wife--at least, her senses.
     This came about in due time of suspiration and respiration.

     "You need not be alarmed--jealousy is not the order of the day in
     Venice, and daggers are out of fashion, while duels, on love
     matters, are unknown--at least, with the husbands. But, for all
     this, it was an awkward affair; and though he must have known that
     I made love to Marianna, yet I believe he was not, till that
     evening, aware of the extent to which it had gone. It is very well
     known that almost all the married women have a lover; but it is
     usual to keep up the forms, as in other nations. I did not,
     therefore, know what the devil to say. I could not out with the
     truth, out of regard to her, and I did not choose to lie for my
     sake;--besides, the thing told itself. I thought the best way would
     be to let her explain it as she chose (a woman being never at a
     loss--the devil always sticks by them)--only determining to protect
     and carry her off, in case of any ferocity on the part of the
     Signor. I saw that he was quite calm. She went to bed, and next
     day--how they settled it, I know not, but settle it they did.
     Well--then I had to explain to Marianna about this
     never-to-be-sufficiently-confounded sister-in-law; which I did by
     swearing innocence, eternal constancy, &c. &c. But the
     sister-in-law, very much discomposed with being treated in such
     wise, has (not having her own shame before her eyes) told the
     affair to half Venice, and the servants (who were summoned by the
     fight and the fainting) to the other half. But, here, nobody minds
     such trifles, except to be amused by them. I don't know whether you
     will be so, but I have scrawled a long letter out of these follies.

     "Believe me ever," &c.

LETTER 260. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, January 24. 1817.

     "I have been requested by the Countess Albrizzi here to present her
     with 'the Works;' and wish you therefore to send me a copy, that I
     may comply with her requisition. You may include the last
     published, of which I have seen and know nothing, but from your
     letter of the 13th of December.

     "Mrs. Leigh tells me that most of her friends prefer the two first
     Cantos. I do not know whether this be the general opinion or not
     (it is not hers); but it is natural it should be so. I, however,
     think differently, which is natural also; but who is right, or who
     is wrong, is of very little consequence.

     "Dr. Polidori, as I hear from him by letter from Pisa, is about to
     return to England, to go to the Brazils on a medical speculation
     with the Danish consul. As you are in the favour of the powers that
     be, could you not get him some letters of recommendation from some
     of your government friends to some of the Portuguese settlers? He
     understands his profession well, and has no want of general
     talents; his faults are the faults of a pardonable vanity and
     youth. His remaining with me was out of the question: I have enough
     to do to manage my own scrapes; and as precepts without example are
     not the most gracious homilies, I thought it better to give him his
     congé: but I know no great harm of him, and some good. He is clever
     and accomplished; knows his profession, by all accounts, well; and
     is honourable in his dealings, and not at all malevolent. I think,
     with luck, he will turn out a useful member of society (from which
     he will lop the diseased members) and the College of Physicians. If
     you can be of any use to him, or know any one who can, pray be so,
     as he has his fortune to make. He has kept a medical journal
     under the eye of Vacca (the first surgeon on the Continent) at
     Pisa: Vacca has corrected it, and it must contain some valuable
     hints or information on the practice of this country. If you can
     aid him in publishing this also, by your influence with your
     brethren, do; I do not ask you to publish it yourself, because that
     sort of request is too personal and embarrassing. He has also a
     tragedy, of which, having seen nothing, I say nothing: but the very
     circumstance of his having made these efforts (if they are only
     efforts), at one-and-twenty, is in his favour, and proves him to
     have good dispositions for his own improvement. So if, in the way
     of commendation or recommendation, you can aid his objects with
     your government friends, I wish you would, I should think some of
     your Admiralty Board might be likely to have it in their power."

     "I have received your two letters, but not the parcel you mention.
     As the Waterloo spoils are arrived, I will make you a present of
     them, if you choose to accept of them; pray do.

     "I do not exactly understand from your letter what has been
     omitted, or what not, in the publication; but I shall see probably
     some day or other. I could not attribute any but a good motive to
     Mr. Gifford or yourself in such omission; but as our politics are
     so very opposite, we should probably differ as to the passages.
     However, if it is only a note or notes, or a line or so, it
     cannot signify. You say 'a poem;' what poem? You can tell me in
     your next.

     "Of Mr. Hobhouse's quarrel with the Quarterly Review, I know very
     little except * * 's article itself, which was certainly harsh
     enough; but I quite agree that it would have been better not to
     answer--particularly after Mr. W.W., who never more will trouble
     you, trouble you. I have been uneasy, because Mr. H. told me that
     his letter or preface was to be addressed to me. Now, he and I are
     friends of many years; I have many obligations to him, and he none
     to me, which have not been cancelled and more than repaid; but Mr.
     Gifford and I are friends also, and he has moreover been literally
     so, through thick and thin, in despite of difference of years,
     morals, habits, and even politics; and therefore I feel in a very
     awkward situation between the two, Mr. Gifford and my friend
     Hobhouse, and can only wish that they had no difference, or that
     such as they have were accommodated. The Answer I have not seen,
     for--it is odd enough for people so intimate--but Mr. Hobhouse and
     I are very sparing of our literary confidences. For example, the
     other day he wished to have a MS. of the third Canto to read over
     to his brother, &c., which was refused;--and I have never seen his
     journals, nor he mine--(I only kept the short one of the mountains
     for my sister)--nor do I think that hardly ever he or I saw any of
     the other's productions previous to their publication. Almost all the persons--but two or three--are Spirits of the
     earth and air, or the waters; the scene is in the Alps; the hero a
     kind of magician, who is tormented by a species of remorse, the
     cause of which is left half unexplained. He wanders about invoking
     these Spirits, which appear to him, and are of no use; he at last
     goes to the very abode of the Evil Principle, in propriâ personâ,
     to evocate a ghost, which appears, and gives him an ambiguous and
     disagreeable answer; and in the third act he is found by his
     attendants dying in a tower where he had studied his art.

LETTER 262. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, February 25. 1817.

     "I wrote to you the other day in answer to your letter; at present
     I would trouble you with a commission, if you would be kind enough
     to undertake it.

     "You, perhaps, know Mr. Love, the jeweller, of Old Bond Street? In
     1813, when in the intention of returning to Turkey, I purchased of
     him, and paid (argent comptant) for about a dozen snuff-boxes, of
     more or less value, as presents for some of my Mussulman
     acquaintance. These I have now with me. The other day, having
     occasion to make an alteration in the lid of one (to place a
     portrait in it), it has turned out to be silver-gilt instead of
     gold, for which last it was sold and paid for. This was
     discovered by the workman in trying it, before taking off the
     hinges and working upon the lid. I have of course recalled and
     preserved the box in statu quo. What I wish you to do is, to see
     the said Mr. Love, and inform him of this circumstance, adding,
     from me, that I will take care he shall not have done this with
     impunity.

     "If there is no remedy in law, there is at least the equitable one
     of making known his guilt,--that is, his silver-gilt, and be
     d----d to him.

     "I shall carefully preserve all the purchases I made of him on that
     occasion for my return, as the plague in Turkey is a barrier to
     travelling there at present, or rather the endless quarantine which
     would be the consequence before one could land in coming back. Pray
     state the matter to him with due ferocity.

     "I sent you the other day some extracts from a kind of Drama which
     I had begun in Switzerland and finished here; you will tell me if
     they are received. They were only in a letter. I have not yet had
     energy to copy it out, or I would send you the whole in different
     covers.

     "The Carnival closed this day last week.

     "Mr. Hobhouse is still at Rome, I believe. I am at present a little
     unwell;--sitting up too late and some subsidiary dissipations have
     lowered my blood a good deal; but I have at present the quiet and
     temperance of Lent before me.

     "Believe me, &c.

     "P.S. Remember me to Mr. Gifford--I have not received your parcel
     or parcels.--Look into 'Moore's (Dr. Moore's) View of Italy' for
     me; in one of the volumes you will find an account of the Doge
     Valiere (it ought to be Falieri) and his conspiracy, or the
     motives of it. Get it transcribed for me, and send it in a letter
     to me soon. I want it, and cannot find so good an account of that
     business here; though the veiled patriot, and the place where he
     was crowned, and afterwards decapitated, still exist and are shown.

     "I mean to write a tragedy on the subject, which appears to me very
     dramatic; an old man, jealous, and conspiring against the state of
     which he was the actually reigning chief. The last circumstance
     makes it the most remarkable and only fact of the kind in all
     history of all nations."

LETTER 263. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Venice, February 28. 1817.

     "You will, perhaps, complain as much of the frequency of my letters
     now, as you were wont to do of their rarity. I think this is the
     fourth within as many moons. I feel anxious to hear from you, even
     more than usual, because your last indicated that you were unwell.
     At present, I am on the invalid regimen myself. The Carnival--that
     is, the latter part of it, and sitting up late o'nights, had
     knocked me up a little. But it is over,--and it is now Lent, with
     all its abstinence and sacred music.

     "The mumming closed with a masked ball at the Fenice, where I went,
     as also to most of the ridottos, &c. &c.; and, though I did not
     dissipate much upon the whole, yet I find 'the sword wearing out
     the scabbard,' though I have but just turned the corner of
     twenty-nine.

        "So, we'll go no more a roving
          So late into the night,
        Though the heart be still as loving,
          And the moon be still as bright.
        For the sword out-wears its sheath,
          And the soul wears out the breast,
        And the heart must pause to breathe,
          And Love itself have rest.
        Though the night was made for loving,
          And the day returns too soon,
        Yet we'll go no more a roving
          By the light of the moon.

     I have lately had some news of litteratoor, as I heard the editor
     of the Monthly pronounce it once upon a time. I hear that W.W. has
     been publishing and responding to the attacks of the Quarterly, in
     the learned Perry's Chronicle. I read his poesies last autumn, and,
     amongst them, found an epitaph on his bull-dog, and another on
     myself. But I beg leave to assure him (like the astrologer
     Partridge) that I am not only alive now, but was alive also at the
     time he wrote it. Hobhouse has (I hear, also) expectorated a letter
     against the Quarterly, addressed to me. I feel awkwardly situated
     between him and Gifford, both being my friends.

     "And this is your month of going to press--by the body of Diana! (a
     Venetian oath,) I feel as anxious--but not fearful for you--as if
     it were myself coming out in a work of humour, which would, you
     know, be the antipodes of all my previous publications. I don't
     think you have any thing to dread but your own reputation. You must
     keep up to that. As you never showed me a line of your work, I do
     not even know your measure; but you must send me a copy by Murray
     forthwith, and then you shall hear what I think. I dare say you are
     in a pucker. Of all authors, you are the only really modest one I
     ever met with,--which would sound oddly enough to those who
     recollect your morals when you were young--that is, when you were
     extremely young--don't mean to stigmatise you either with years
     or morality. I have, at intervals,
     exorcised it most devilishly.

     "I have not yet fixed a time of return, but I think of the spring.
     I shall have been away a year in April next. You never mention
     Rogers, nor Hodgson, your clerical neighbour, who has lately got a
     living near you. Has he also got a child yet?--his desideratum,
     when I saw him last.

     ever and truly and affectionately," &c.

LETTER 264. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, March 3. 1817. Such
     things are, however, their own reward; and I even flatter myself
     that the writer, whoever he may be (and I have no guess), will not
     regret that the perusal of this has given me as much gratification
     as any composition of that nature could give, and more than any
     other has given,--and I have had a good many in my time of one kind
     or the other. It is not the mere praise, but there is a tact and
     a delicacy throughout, not only with regard to me, but to
     others, which, as it had not been observed elsewhere, I had
     till now doubted whether it could be observed any where.

     "Perhaps some day or other you will know or tell me the writer's
     name. Be assured, had the article been a harsh one, I should not
     have asked it.

     "I have lately written to you frequently, with extracts, &c.,
     which I hope you have received, or will receive, with or before
     this letter.--Ever since the conclusion of the Carnival I have been
     unwell, (do not mention this, on any account, to Mrs. Leigh; for if
     I grow worse, she will know it too soon, and if I get better, there
     is no occasion that she should know it at all,) and have hardly
     stirred out of the house. However, I don't want a physician, and
     if I did, very luckily those of Italy are the worst in the world,
     so that I should still have a chance. They have, I believe, one
     famous surgeon, Vacca, who lives at Pisa, who might be useful in
     case of dissection:--but he is some hundred miles off. My malady is
     a sort of lowish fever, originating from what my 'pastor and
     master,' Jackson, would call 'taking too much out of one's self.'
     However, I am better within this day or two.

     "I missed seeing the new Patriarch's procession to St. Mark's the
     other day (owing to my indisposition), with six hundred and fifty
     priests in his rear--a 'goodly army.' The admirable government of
     Vienna, in its edict from thence, authorising his installation,
     prescribed, as part of the pageant, 'a coach and four horses.' To
     show how very, very 'German to the matter' this was, you have
     only to suppose our parliament commanding the Archbishop of
     Canterbury to proceed from Hyde Park Corner to St. Paul's Cathedral
     in the Lord Mayor's barge, or the Margate hoy. There is but St.
     Mark's Place in all Venice broad enough for a carriage to move, and
     it is paved with large smooth flag-stones, so that the chariot and
     horses of Elijah himself would be puzzled to manoeuvre upon it.
     Those of Pharaoh might do better; for the canals--and particularly
     the Grand Canal--are sufficiently capacious and extensive for his
     whole host. Of course, no coach could be attempted; but the
     Venetians, who are very naïve as well as arch, were much amused
     with the ordinance.

     "The Armenian Grammar is published; but my Armenian studies are
     suspended for the present till my head aches a little less. I sent
     you the other day, in two covers, the first Act of 'Manfred,' a
     drama as mad as Nat. Lee's Bedlam tragedy, which was in 25 acts and
     some odd scenes:--mine is but in Three Acts.

     must end it, then, at the right.

LETTER 265. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, March 9. 1817.

     "In remitting the third Act of the sort of dramatic poem of which
     you will by this time have received the two first (at least I hope
     so), which were sent within the last three weeks, I have little to
     observe, except that you must not publish it (if it ever is
     published) without giving me previous notice.

     "I have received your two Reviews (but not the 'Tales of my
     Landlord'); the Quarterly I acknowledged particularly to you, on
     its arrival, ten days ago. What you tell me of Perry petrifies me;
     it is a rank imposition. In or about February or March, 1816, I was
     given to understand that Mr. Croker was not only a coadjutor in the
     attacks of the Courier in 1814, but the author of some lines
     tolerably ferocious, then recently published in a morning paper.
     Upon this I wrote a reprisal. The whole of the lines I have
     forgotten, and even the purport of them I scarcely remember; for on
     your assuring me that he was not, &c. &c., I put them into the
     fire before your face, and there never was but that one rough
     copy. Mr. Davies, the only person who ever heard them read, wanted
     a copy, which I refused. If, however, by some impossibility,
     which I cannot divine, the ghost of these rhymes should walk into
     the world, I never will deny what I have really written, but hold
     myself personally responsible for satisfaction, though I reserve to
     myself the right of disavowing all or any fabrications. To the
     previous facts you are a witness, and best know how far my
     recapitulation is correct; and I request that you will inform Mr.
     Perry from me, that I wonder he should permit such an abuse of my
     name in his paper; I say an abuse, because my absence, at least,
     demands some respect, and my presence and positive sanction could
     alone justify him in such a proceeding, even were the lines mine;
     and if false, there are no words for him. I repeat to you that the
     original was burnt before you on your assurance, and there
     never was a copy, nor even a verbal repetition,--very much to
     the discomfort of some zealous Whigs, who bored me for them (having
     heard it bruited by Mr. Davies that there were such matters) to no
     purpose; for, having written them solely with the notion that Mr.
     Croker was the aggressor, and for my own and not party reprisals,
     I would not lend me to the zeal of any sect when I was made aware
     that he was not the writer of the offensive passages. You know,
     if there was such a thing, I would not deny it. I mentioned it
     openly at the time to you, and you will remember why and where I
     destroyed it; and no power nor wheedling on earth should have made,
     or could make, me (if I recollected them) give a copy after that,
     unless I was well assured that Mr. Croker was really the author of
     that which you assured me he was not.

     "I intend for England this spring, where I have some affairs to
     adjust; but the post hurries me. For this month past I have been
     unwell, but am getting better, and thinking of moving homewards
     towards May, without going to Rome, as the unhealthy season comes
     on soon, and I can return when I have settled the business I go
     upon, which need not be long. I should have thought the Assyrian
     tale very succeedable.

     "I saw, in Mr. W.W.'s poetry, that he had written my epitaph; I
     would rather have written his.

     "The thing I have sent you, you will see at a glimpse, could never
     be attempted or thought of for the stage; I much doubt it for
     publication even. It is too much in my old style; but I composed
     it actually with a horror of the stage, and with a view to
     render the thought of it impracticable, knowing the zeal of my
     friends that I should try that for which I have an invincible
     repugnance, viz. a representation.

     "I certainly am a devil of a mannerist, and must leave off; but
     what could I do? Without exertion of some kind, I should have sunk
     under my imagination and reality. My best respects to Mr. Gifford,
     to Walter Scott, and to all friends.

LETTER 266. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Venice, March 10. 1817.

     "I wrote again to you lately, but I hope you won't be sorry to have
     another epistle. I have been unwell this last month, with a kind of
     slow and low fever, which fixes upon me at night, and goes off in
     the morning; but, however, I am now better. In spring it is
     probable we may meet; at least I intend for England, where I have
     business, and hope to meet you in your restored health and
     additional laurels.

     "Murray has sent me the Quarterly and the Edinburgh. When I tell
     you that Walter Scott is the author of the article in the former,
     you will agree with me that such an article is still more
     honourable to him than to myself. I am perfectly pleased with
     Jeffrey's also, which I wish you to tell him, with my
     remembrances--not that I suppose it is of any consequence to him,
     or ever could have been, whether I am pleased or not, but simply in
     my private relation to him, as his well-wisher, and it may be one
     day as his acquaintance.

     "I suppose now I shall never be able to shake off my sables in
     public imagination, more particularly since my moral * * clove down
     my fame. However, nor that, nor more than that, has yet
     extinguished my spirit, which always rises with the rebound.

     "At Venice we are in Lent, and I have not lately moved out of
     doors, my feverishness requiring quiet, and--by way of being more
     quiet--here is the Signora Marianna just come in and seated at my
     elbow.

     "Have you seen * * *'s book of poesy? and, if you have seen it, are
     you not delighted with it? And have you--I really cannot go on:
     there is a pair of great black eyes looking over my shoulder, like
     the angel leaning over St. Matthew's, in the old frontispieces to
     the Evangelists,--so that I must turn and answer them instead of
     you.

     "Ever," &c.

LETTER 267. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Venice, March 25. 1817.

     "I have at last learned, in default of your own writing (or not
     writing--which should it be? for I am not very clear as to the
     application of the word default) from Murray, two particulars of
     (or belonging to) you; one, that you are removing to Hornsey, which
     is, I presume, to be nearer London; and the other, that your Poem
     is announced by the name of Lalla Rookh. I am glad of it,--first,
     that we are to have it at last, and next, I like a tough title
     myself--witness The Giaour and Childe Harold, which choked half the
     Blues at starting. Besides, it is the tail of Alcibiades's
     dog,--not that I suppose you want either dog or tail. Talking of
     tail, I wish you had not called it a 'Persian Tale'[130] Say a
     'Poem' or 'Romance,' but not 'Tale.' I am very sorry that I called
     some of my own things 'Tales,' because I think that they are
     something better. Besides, we have had Arabian, and Hindoo, and
     Turkish, and Assyrian Tales. But, after all, this is frivolous in
     me; you won't, however, mind my nonsense.
     Mind you send to me--that is, make Murray send--the moment you are
     forth.

     "I have been very ill with a slow fever, which at last took to
     flying, and became as quick as need be.[131] But, at length, after
     a week of half-delirium, burning skin, thirst, hot headach,
     horrible pulsation, and no sleep, by the blessing of barley water,
     and refusing to see any physician, I recovered. It is an epidemic
     of the place, which is annual, and visits strangers. Here follow
     some versicles, which I made one sleepless night.

        "I read the 'Christabel;'
            Very well:
        I read the 'Missionary;'
            Pretty--very:
        I tried at 'Ilderim;'
            Ahem;
        I read a sheet of 'Marg'ret of Anjou;'
            Can you?
        I turn'd a page of * *'s 'Waterloo;'
            Pooh! pooh!
        I look'd at Wordsworth's milk-white 'Rylstone Doe:'
            Hillo!
        &c. &c. &c.

     "I have not the least idea where I am going, nor what I am to do. I
     wished to have gone to Rome; but at present it is pestilent with
     English,--a parcel of staring boobies, who go about gaping and
     wishing to be at once cheap and magnificent. A man is a fool who
     travels now in France or Italy, till this tribe of wretches is
     swept home again. In two or three years the first rush will be
     over, and the Continent will be roomy and agreeable.

     "I stayed at Venice chiefly because it is not one of their 'dens of
     thieves;' and here they but pause and pass. In Switzerland it was
     really noxious. Luckily, I was early, and had got the prettiest
     place on all the Lake before they were quickened into motion with
     the rest of the reptiles. But they crossed me every where. I met a
     family of children and old women half-way up the Wengen Alp (by the
     Jungfrau) upon mules, some of them too old and others too young to
     be the least aware of what they saw.

     "By the way, I think the Jungfrau, and all that region of Alps,
     which I traversed in September--going to the very top of the
     Wengen, which is not the highest (the Jungfrau itself is
     inaccessible) but the best point of view--much finer than
     Mont-Blanc and Chamouni, or the Simplon I kept a journal of the
     whole for my sister Augusta, part of which she copied and let
     Murray see. I
     sent him all three acts piece-meal, by the post, and suppose they
     have arrived.

     "I have now written to you at least six letters, or lettered, and
     all I have received in return is a note about the length you used
     to write from Bury Street to St. James's Street, when we used to
     dine with Rogers, and talk laxly, and go to parties, and hear poor
     Sheridan now and then. Do you remember one night he was so tipsy
     that I was forced to put his cocked hat on for him,--for he could
     not,--and I let him down at Brookes's, much as he must since have
     been let down into his grave. Heigh ho! I wish I was drunk--but I
     have nothing but this d----d barley-water before me.

     "I am still in love,--which is a dreadful drawback in quitting a
     place, and I can't stay at Venice much longer. What I shall do on
     this point I don't know. The girl means to go with me, but I do not
     like this for her own sake. I have had so many conflicts in my own
     mind on this subject, that I am not at all sure they did not help
     me to the fever I mentioned above. I am certainly very much
     attached to her, and I have cause to be so, if you knew all. But
     she has a child; and though, like all the 'children of the sun,'
     she consults nothing but passion, it is necessary I should think
     for both; and it is only the virtuous, like * * * *, who can afford
     to give up husband and child, and live happy ever after.

     "The Italian ethics are the most singular ever met with. The
     perversion, not only of action, but of reasoning, is singular in
     the women. It is not that they do not consider the thing itself as
     wrong, and very wrong, but love (the sentiment of love) is not
     merely an excuse for it, but makes it an actual virtue, provided
     it is disinterested, and not a caprice, and is confined to one
     object. They have awful notions of constancy; for I have seen some
     ancient figures of eighty pointed out as amorosi of forty, fifty,
     and sixty years' standing. I can't say I have ever seen a husband
     and wife so coupled.

     "Ever, &c.

     "P.S. Marianna, to whom I have just translated what I have written
     on our subject to you, says--'If you loved me thoroughly, you would
     not make so many fine reflections, which are only good forbirsi i
     scarpi,'--that is, 'to clean shoes withal,'--a Venetian proverb of
     appreciation, which is applicable to reasoning of all kinds."

[Footnote 130: He had been misinformed on this point,--the work in question having been, from
the first, entitled an "Oriental Romance." A much worse mistake (because wilful, and with no
very charitable design) was that of certain persons, who would have it that the poem was meant
to be epic!--Even Mr. D'Israeli has, for the sake of a theory, given in to this very gratuitous
assumption:--"The Anacreontic poet," he says, "remains only Anacreontic in his Epic."]

[Footnote 131: In a note to Mr. Murray, subjoined to some corrections for Manfred, he says,
"Since I wrote to you last, the slow fever I wot of thought proper to mend its pace, and became
similar to one which I caught some years ago in the marshes of Elis, in the Morea."]

LETTER 268. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, March 25. 1817.

     "Your letter and enclosure are safe; but 'English gentlemen' are
     very rare--at least in Venice. I doubt whether there are at present
     any, save, the consul and vice-consul, with neither of whom I have
     the slightest acquaintance. The moment I can pounce upon a witness,
     I will send the deed properly signed: but must he necessarily be
     genteel? Venice is not a place where the English are gregarious;
     their pigeon-houses are Florence, Naples, Rome, &c.; and to tell
     you the truth, this was one reason why I stayed here till the
     season of the purgation of Rome from these people, which is
     infected with them at this time, should arrive. Besides, I abhor
     the nation and the nation me; it is impossible for me to describe
     my own sensation on that point, but it may suffice to say, that,
     if I met with any of the race in the beautiful parts of
     Switzerland, the most distant glimpse or aspect of them poisoned
     the whole scene, and I do not choose to have the Pantheon, and St.
     Peter's, and the Capitol, spoiled for me too. This feeling may be
     probably owing to recent events; but it does not exist the less,
     and while it exists, I shall conceal it as little as any other.

     "I have been seriously ill with a fever, but it is gone. I believe
     or suppose it was the indigenous fever of the place, which comes
     every year at this time, and of which the physicians change the
     name annually, to despatch the people sooner. It is a kind of
     typhus, and kills occasionally. It was pretty smart, but nothing
     particular, and has left me some debility and a great appetite.
     There are a good many ill at present, I suppose, of the same.

     "I feel sorry for Horner, if there was any thing in the world to
     make him like it; and still more sorry for his friends, as there
     was much to make them regret him. I had not heard of his death
     till by your letter.

     "Some weeks ago I wrote to you my acknowledgments of Walter Scott's
     article. Now I know it to be his, it cannot add to my good opinion
     of him, but it adds to that of myself. He, and Gifford, and
     Moore, are the only regulars I ever knew who had nothing of the
     garrison about their manner: no nonsense, nor affectations, look
     you! As for the rest whom I have known, there was always more or
     less of the author about them--the pen peeping from behind the ear,
     and the thumbs a little inky, or so.

     "'Lalla Rookh'--you must recollect that, in the way of title, the
     'Giaour' has never been pronounced to this day; and both it and
     Childe Harold sounded very facetious to the blue-bottles of wit and
     humour about town, till they were taught and startled into a proper
     deportment; and therefore Lalla Rookh, which is very orthodox and
     oriental, is as good a title as need be, if not better. I could
     wish rather that he had not called it 'a Persian Tale;' firstly,
     because we have had Turkish Tales, and Hindoo Tales, and Assyrian
     Tales, already; and tale is a word of which it repents me to have
     nicknamed poesy. 'Fable' would be better; and, secondly, 'Persian
     Tale' reminds one of the lines of Pope on Ambrose Phillips; though
     no one can say, to be sure, that this tale has been 'turned for
     half-a-crown;' still it is as well to avoid such clashings.
     'Persian Story'--why not?--or Romance? I feel as anxious for Moore
     as I could do for myself, for the soul of me, and I would not have
     him succeed otherwise than splendidly, which I trust he will do.

     "With regard to the 'Witch Drama,' I sent all the three acts by
     post, week after week, within this last month. I repeat that I have
     not an idea if it is good or bad. If bad, it must, on no account,
     be risked in publication; if good, it is at your service I value it
     at three hundred guineas, or less, if you like it. Perhaps, if
     published, the best way will be to add it to your winter volume,
     and not publish separately. The price will show you I don't pique
     myself upon it; so speak out. You may put it in the fire, if you
     like, and Gifford don't like.

     "The Armenian Grammar is published--that is, one; the other is
     still in MS. My illness has prevented me from moving this month
     past, and I have done nothing more with the Armenian.

     "Of Italian or rather Lombard manners, I could tell you little or
     nothing: I went two or three times to the governor's conversazione,
     (and if you go once, you are free to go always,) at which, as I
     only saw very plain women, a formal circle, in short a worst sort
     of rout, I did not go again. I went to Academie and to Madame
     Albrizzi's, where I saw pretty much the same thing, with the
     addition of some literati, who are the same blue[132], by ----,
     all the world over. I fell in love the first week with Madame * *,
     and I have continued so ever since, because she is very pretty and
     pleasing, and talks Venetian, which amuses me, and is naïve.

     "Very truly, &c.

     "P.S. Pray send the red tooth-powder by a safe hand, and
     speedily.[133]

        "To hook the reader, you, John Murray,
          Have publish'd 'Anjou's Margaret,'
        Which won't be sold off in a hurry
          (At least, it has not been as yet);
        And then, still further to bewilder 'em,
        Without remorse you set up 'Ilderim;'
          So mind you don't get into debt,
        Because as how, if you should fail,
        These books would be but baddish bail.
        And mind you do not let escape
          These rhymes to Morning Post or Perry,
          Which would be very treacherous--very,
        And get me into such a scrape!
        For, firstly, I should have to sally,
        All in my little boat, against a Gally;
        And, should I chance to slay the Assyrian wight,
        Have next to combat with the female knight.

     "You may show these matters to Moore and the select, but not to the
     profane; and tell Moore, that I wonder he don't write to one now
     and then."

[Footnote 132: Whenever a word or passage occurs (as in this instance) which Lord Byron would
have pronounced emphatically in speaking, it appears, in his handwriting, as if written with
something of the same vehemence.]

[Footnote 133: Here follow the same rhymes ("I read the Christabel," &c.) which have already
been given in one of his letters to myself.]

LETTER 269. TO MR. MOORE.

     "Venice, March 31. 1817.

     "You will begin to think my epistolary offerings (to whatever altar
     you please to devote them) rather prodigal. But until you answer, I
     shall not abate, because you deserve no better. I know you are
     well, because I hear of your voyaging to London and the environs,
     which I rejoice to learn, because your note alarmed me by the
     purgation and phlebotomy therein prognosticated. I also hear of
     your being in the press; all which, methinks, might have furnished
     you with subject-matter for a middle-sized letter, considering that
     I am in foreign parts, and that the last month's advertisements and
     obituary would be absolute news to me from your Tramontane country.

     "I told you, in my last, I have had a smart fever. There is an
     epidemic in the place; but I suspect, from the symptoms, that mine
     was a fever of my own, and had nothing in common with the low,
     vulgar typhus, which is at this moment decimating Venice, and which
     has half unpeopled Milan, if the accounts be true. This malady has
     sorely discomfited my serving men, who want sadly to be gone away,
     and get me to remove. But, besides my natural perversity, I was
     seasoned in Turkey, by the continual whispers of the plague,
     against apprehensions of contagion. Besides which, apprehension
     would not prevent it; and then I am still in love, and 'forty
     thousand' fevers should not make me stir before my minute, while
     under the influence of that paramount delirium. Seriously
     speaking, there is a malady rife in the city--a dangerous one, they
     say. However, mine did not appear so, though it was not pleasant.

     "This is Passion-week--and twilight--and all the world are at
     vespers. They have an eternal churching, as in all Catholic
     countries, but are not so bigoted as they seem to be in Spain.

     "I don't know whether to be glad or sorry that you are leaving
     Mayfield. Had I ever been at Newstead during your stay there,
     (except during the winter of 1813-14, when the roads were
     impracticable,) we should have been within hail, and I should like
     to have made a giro of the Peak with you. I know that country well,
     having been all over it when a boy. Was you ever in Dovedale? I can
     assure you there are things in Derbyshire as noble as Greece or
     Switzerland. But you had always a lingering after London, and I
     don't wonder at it. I liked it as well as any body, myself, now and
     then.

     "Will you remember me to Rogers? whom I presume to be flourishing,
     and whom I regard as our poetical papa. You are his lawful son, and
     I the illegitimate. Has he begun yet upon Sheridan? If you see our
     republican friend, Leigh Hunt, pray present my remembrances. I saw
     about nine months ago that he was in a row (like my friend
     Hobhouse) with the Quarterly Reviewers. For my part, I never could
     understand these quarrels of authors with critics and with one
     another. 'For God's sake, gentlemen, what do they mean?'

     "What think you of your countryman, Maturin? I take some credit to
     myself for having done my best to bring out Bertram; but I must say
     my colleagues were quite as ready and willing. Walter Scott,
     however, was the first who mentioned him, which he did to me,
     with great commendation, in 1815; and it is to this casualty, and
     two or three other accidents, that this very clever fellow owed his
     first and well-merited public success. What a chance is fame!

     "Did I tell you that I have translated two Epistles?--a
     correspondence between St. Paul and the Corinthians, not to be
     found in our version, but the Armenian--but which seems to me very
     orthodox, and I have done it into scriptural prose English.[134]

     "Ever," &c.

[Footnote 134: The only plausible claim of these epistles to authenticity arises from the circumstance
of St. Paul having (according to the opinion of Mosheim and others) written an epistle to the
Corinthians, before that which we now call his first. They are, however, universally given
up as spurious. Though frequently referred to as existing in the Armenian, by Primate Usher,
Johan. Gregorius, and other learned men, they were for the first time, I believe, translated
from that language by the two Whistons, who subjoined the correspondence, with a Greek and
Latin version, to their edition of the Armenian History of Moses of Chorene, published in 1736.

The translation by Lord Byron is, as far as I can learn, the first that has ever been attempted
in English; and as, proceeding from his pen, it must possess, of course, additional interest,
the reader will not be displeased to find it in the Appendix. I had also (he adds) the Latin
text, but it is in many places very corrupt, and with great omissions."]

LETTER 270. TO MR. MURRAY.

     "Venice, April 2. 1817.

     "I sent you the whole of the Drama at three several times, act by
     act, in separate covers. I hope that you have, or will receive,
     some or the whole of it.

     "So Love has a conscience. By Diana! I shall make him take back the
     box, though it were Pandora's. The discovery of its intrinsic
     silver occurred on sending it to have the lid adapted to admit
     Marianna's portrait. Of course I had the box remitted in statu
     quo, and had the picture set in another, which suits it (the
     picture) very well. The defaulting box is not touched, hardly, and
     was not in the man's hands above an hour.

     "I am aware of what you say of Otway; and am a very great admirer
     of his,--all except of that maudlin b--h of chaste lewdness and
     blubbering curiosity, Belvidera, whom I utterly despise, abhor, and
     detest. But the story of Marino Faliero is different, and, I think,
     so much finer, that I wish Otway had taken it instead: the head
     conspiring against the body for refusal of redress for a real
     injury,--jealousy--treason, with the more fixed and inveterate
     passions (mixed with policy) of an old or elderly man--the devil
     himself could not have a finer subject, and he is your only tragic
     dramatist.

     "Maturin's tragedy.--By your account of him last year to me, he
     seemed a bit of a coxcomb, personally. Poor fellow! to be sure, he
     had had a long seasoning of adversity, which is not so hard to bear
     as t'other thing. I hope that this won't throw him back into the
     'slough of Despond.'

     "You talk of 'marriage;'--ever since my own funeral, the word makes
     me giddy, and throws me into a cold sweat. Pray, don't repeat it.

     "You should close with Madame de Staël. This will be her best work,
     and permanently historical; it is on her father, the Revolution,
     and Buonaparte, &c. Bunstetten told me in Switzerland it was
     very great. I have not seen it myself, but the author often.
     She was very kind to me at Copet.

     "There have been two articles in the Venice papers, one a Review of
     Glenarvon * * * *, and the other a Review of Childe Harold, in
     which it proclaims me the most rebellious and contumacious admirer
     of Buonaparte now surviving in Europe. Both these articles are
     translations from the Literary Gazette of German Jena.

     "Tell me that Walter Scott is better. I would not have him ill for
     the world. I suppose it was by sympathy that I had my fever at the
     same time.

     "I joy in the success of your Quarterly, but I must still stick by
     the Edinburgh; Jeffrey has done so by me, I must say, through every
     thing, and this is more than I deserved from him. I have more than
     once acknowledged to you by letter the 'Article' (and articles);
     say that you have received the said letters, as I do not otherwise
     know what letters arrive. Both Reviews came, but nothing more. M.'s

     "It is a considerable time since I wrote to you last, and I hardly
     know why I should trouble you now, except that I think you will
     not be sorry to hear from me now and then. You and I were never
     correspondents, but always something better, which is, very good
     friends.

     "I saw your friend Sharp in Switzerland, or rather in the German
     territory (which is and is not Switzerland), and he gave Hobhouse
     and me a very good route for the Bernese Alps; however we took
     another from a German, and went by Clarens, the Dent de Jamen to
     Montbovon, and through Simmenthal to Thoun, and so on to
     Lauterbrounn; except that from thence to the Grindelwald, instead
     of round about, we went right over the Wengen Alps' very summit,
     and being close under the Jungfrau, saw it, its glaciers, and heard
     the avalanches in all their glory, having famous weather
     therefor. We of course went from the Grindelwald over the
     Sheidech to Brientz and its lake; past the Reichenbach and all that
     mountain road, which reminded me of Albania and Ætolia and Greece,
     except that the people here were more civilised and rascally. I do
     not think so very much of Chamouni (except the source of the
     Arveron, to which we went up to the teeth of the ice, so as to look
     into and touch the cavity, against the warning of the guides, only
     one of whom would go with us so close,) as of the Jungfrau, and the
     Pissevache, and Simplon, which are quite out of all mortal
     competition.

     "I was at Milan about a moon, and saw Monti and some other living
     curiosities, and thence on to Verona, where I did not forget your
     story of the assassination during your sojourn there, and brought
     away with me some fragments of Juliet's tomb, and a lively
     recollection of the amphitheatre. The Countess Goetz (the
     governor's wife here) told me that there is still a ruined castle
     of the Montecchi between Verona and Vicenza. I have been at Venice
     since November, but shall proceed to Rome shortly. For my deeds
     here, are they not written in my letters to the unreplying Thomas
     Moore? to him I refer you: he has received them all, and not
     answered one.

     "Will you remember me to Lord and Lady Holland? I have to thank
     the former for a book which. I have not yet received, but expect to
     reperuse with great pleasure on my return, viz. the 2d edition of
     Lope de Vega. I have heard of Moore's forthcoming poem: he cannot
     wish himself more success than I wish and augur for him. I have
     also heard great things of 'Tales of my Landlord,' but I have not
     yet received them; by all accounts they beat even Waverley, &c.,
     and are by the same author. Maturin's second tragedy has, it seems,
     failed, for which I should think any body would be sorry. My health
     was very victorious till within the last month, when I had a fever.
     There is a typhus in these parts, but I don't think it was that.
     However, I got well without a physician or drugs.

     "I forgot to tell you that, last autumn, I furnished Lewis with
     'bread and salt' for some days at Diodati, in reward for which
     (besides his conversation) he translated 'Goethe's Faust' to me by
     word of mouth, and I set him by the ears with Madame de Staël about
     the slave trade. I am indebted for many and kind courtesies to our
     Lady of Copet, and I now love her as much as I always did her
     works, of which I was and am a great admirer. When are you to begin
     with Sheridan? what are you doing, and how do you do? Ever very
     truly," &c.
