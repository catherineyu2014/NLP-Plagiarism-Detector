~Formic acid~ (H·CHO{2}). The name "formic" is derived from the Latin formica, signifying ant.
This name was given to the acid because it was formerly obtained from a certain kind of ants.
It is a colorless liquid and occurs in many plants such as the stinging nettles. The inflammation
caused by the sting of the bee is due to formic acid.

~Acetic acid~ (H·C{2}H{3}O{2}). Acetic acid is the acid present in vinegar, the sour taste
being due to it. It can be prepared by either of the following methods.

1. Acetic fermentation. This consists in the change of alcohol into acetic acid through the
agency of a minute organism commonly called mother of vinegar. The change is represented by
the following equation:

    C{2}H{5}OH + 2O = HC{2}H{3}O{2} + H{2}O.

The various kinds of vinegars are all made by this process. In the manufacture of cider vinegar
the sugar present in the cider first undergoes alcoholic fermentation; the resulting alcohol
then undergoes acetic fermentation. The amount of acetic acid present in vinegars varies from
3 to 6%.

2. From the distillation of wood. The liquid obtained by heating wood in the absence of air
contains a large amount of acetic acid, and this can be separated readily in a pure state.
This is the most economical method for the preparation of the concentrated acid.

Acetic acid is a colorless liquid and has a strong pungent odor. Many of its salts are well-known
compounds. Lead acetate (Pb(C{2}H{3}O{2}){2}) is the ordinary sugar of lead. Sodium acetate
(NaC{2}H{3}O{2}) is a white solid largely used in making chemical analyses. Copper acetate
(Cu(C{2}H{3}O{2}){2}) is a blue solid. When copper is acted upon by acetic acid in the presence
of air a green basic acetate of copper is formed. This is commonly known as verdigris. All
acetates are soluble in water.

~Butyric acid~ (H·C{4}H{7}O{2}). Derivatives of butyric acid are present in butter and impart
to it its characteristic flavor.

~Palmitic and stearic acids.~ Ordinary fats consist principally of derivatives of palmitic
and stearic acids. When the fats are heated with sodium hydroxide the sodium salts of these
acids are formed. If hydrochloric acid is added to a solution of the sodium salts, the free
palmitic and stearic acids are precipitated. They are white solids, insoluble in water. Stearic
acid is often used in making candles.

~Acids belonging to other series.~ In addition to members of the fatty-acid series, mention
may be made of the following well-known acids.

~Oxalic acid~ (H{2}C{2}O{4}). This is a white solid which occurs in nature in many plants,
such as the sorrels. Its ammonium salt ((NH{4}){2}C{2}O{4}) is used as a reagent for the detection
of calcium. When added to a solution of a calcium compound the white, insoluble calcium oxalate
(CaC{2}O{4}) precipitates.

~Tartaric acid~ (H{2}·C{4}H{4}O{6}). This compound occurs either in a free state or in the
form of its salts in many fruits. The potassium acid salt (KHC{4}H{4}O{6}) occurs in the juice
of grapes. When the juice ferments in the manufacture of wine, this salt, being insoluble in
alcohol, separates out on the sides of the cask and in this form is known as argol. This is
more or less colored by the coloring matter of the grape. When purified it forms a white solid
and is sold under the name of cream of tartar. The following are also well-known salts of tartaric
acid: potassium sodium tartrate (Rochelle salt) (KNaC{4}H{4}O{6}), potassium antimonyl tartrate
(tartar emetic) (KSbOC{4}H{4}O{6}).

     ~Cream of tartar baking powders.~ The so-called cream of tartar
     baking powders consist of a mixture of cream of tartar,
     bicarbonate of soda, and some starch or flour.

     The carbon dioxide evolved escapes through the dough, thus
     making it light and porous.

~Citric acid~ (H{3}·C{6}H{5}O{7}). This acid occurs in many fruits, especially in lemons. It
is a white solid, soluble in water, and is often used as a substitute for lemons in making
lemonade.

~Lactic acid~ (H·C{3}H{5}O{3}). This is a liquid which is formed in the souring of milk.

~Oleic acid~ (H·C{18}H{33}O{2}). The derivatives of this acid constitute the principal part
of many oils and liquid fats. The acid itself is an oily liquid.

ETHEREAL SALTS

When acids are brought in contact with alcohols under certain conditions a reaction takes place
similar to that which takes place between acids and bases. The following equations will serve
as illustrations:

    KOH + HNO{3} = KNO{3} + H{2}O,

    CH{3}OH + HNO{3} = CH{3}NO{3} + H{2}O.

The resulting compounds of which methyl nitrate (CH{3}NO{3}) may be taken as the type belong
to the class known as ethereal salts, the name having been given them because some of them
possess pleasant ethereal odors. It will be seen that the ethereal salts differ from ordinary
salts in that they contain a hydrocarbon radical, such as CH{3}, C{2}H{5}, C{3}H{5}, in place
of a metal.

~The nitrates of glycerin~ (nitroglycerin). Nitric acid reacts with glycerin in the same way
that it reacts with a base containing three hydroxyl groups such as Fe(OH){3}:

    Fe(OH){3} + 3HNO{3} = Fe(NO{3}){3} + 3H{2}O,

    C{3}H{5}(OH){3} + 3HNO{3} = C{3}H{5}(NO{3}){3} + 3H{2}O.

The resulting nitrate (C{3}H{5}(NO{3}){3}) is the main constituent of nitroglycerin, a slightly
yellowish oil characterized by its explosive properties. Dynamite consists of porous earth
which has absorbed nitroglycerin, and its strength depends on the amount present. It is used
much more largely than nitroglycerin itself, since it does not explode so readily by concussion
and hence can be transported with safety.

~The fats.~ These are largely mixtures of the ethereal salts known respectively as olein, palmitin,
and stearin. These salts may be regarded as derived from oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids
respectively, by replacing the hydrogen of the acid with the glycerin radical C{3}H{5}. Since
this radical is trivalent and oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids contain only one replaceable
hydrogen atom to the molecule, it is evident that three molecules of each acid must enter into
each molecule of the ethereal salt. The formulas for the acids and the ethereal salts derived
from each are as follows:

    HC{18}H{33}O{2}                 (oleic acid)
    C{8}H{6}(C{18}H{33}O{2}){3}, (olein)

    HC{16}H{31}O{2}                (palmitic acid)
    C{3}H{5}(C{16}H{31}0{2}){3} (palmitin)

    HC{18}H{35}O{2}                (stearic acid)
    C{3}H{5}(C{18}H{35}O{2}){3} (stearin)

Olein is a liquid and is the main constituent of liquid fats. Palmitin and stearin are solids.

~Butter fat and oleomargarine.~ Butter fat consists principally of olein, palmitin, and stearin.
The flavor of the fat is due to the presence of a small amount of butyrin, which is an ethereal
salt of butyric acid. Oleomargarine differs from butter mainly in the fact that a smaller amount
of butyrin is present. It is made from the fats obtained from cattle and hogs. This fat is
churned up with milk, or a small amount of butter is added, in order to furnish sufficient
butyrin to impart the butter flavor.

~Saponification.~ When an ethereal salt is heated with an alkali a reaction expressed by the
following equation takes place:

    C{2}H{5}NO{3} + KOH = C{2}H{5}OH + KNO{3}.

This process is known as saponification, since it is the one which takes place in the manufacture
of soaps. The ordinary soaps are made by heating fats with a solution of sodium hydroxide.
The reactions involved may be illustrated by the following equation representing the reaction
between palmitin and sodium hydroxide:

    C{3}H{5}(C{16}H{31}O{2}){3} + 3 NaOH
         = 3 NaC{16}H{31}O{2} + C{3}H{5}(OH){3}.

In accordance with this equation the ethereal salts in the fats are converted into glycerin
and the sodium salts of the corresponding acids. The sodium salts are separated and constitute
the soaps. These salts are soluble in water. When added to water containing calcium salts the
insoluble calcium palmitate and stearate are precipitated. Magnesium salts act in a similar
way. It is because of these facts that soap is used up by hard waters.

ETHERS

When ethyl alcohol is heated to 140° with sulphuric acid the reaction expressed by the following
equation takes place:

    2C{2}H{5}OH = (C{2}H{5}){2}O + H{2}O.

The resulting compound, (C{2}H{5}){2}O, is ordinary ether and is the most important member
of the class of compounds called ethers. Ordinarily ether is a light, very inflammable liquid
boiling at 35°. It is used as a solvent for organic substances and as an anæsthetic in surgical
operations.

KETONES

The most common member of this group is acetone (C{3}H{6}O), a colorless liquid obtained when
wood is heated in the absence of air. It is used in the preparation of other organic compounds,
especially chloroform.

ORGANIC BASES

This group includes a number of compounds, all of which contain nitrogen as well as carbon.
They are characterized by combining directly with acids to form salts, and in this respect
they resemble ammonia. They may, indeed, be regarded as derived from ammonia by displacing
a part or all of the hydrogen present in ammonia by hydrocarbon radicals. Among the simplest
of these compounds may be mentioned methylamine (CH{3}NH{2}) and ethylamine (C{2}H{5}NH{2}).
These two compounds are gases and are formed in the distillation of wood and bones. Pyridine
(C{5}H{6}N) and quinoline (C{9}H{7}N) are liquids present in small amounts in coal tar, and
also in the liquid obtained by the distillation of bones. Most of the compounds now classified
under the general name of alkaloids (which see) also belong to this group.

CARBOHYDRATES

The term "carbohydrate" is applied to a class of compounds which includes the sugars, starch,
and allied bodies These compounds contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen the last two elements
generally being present in the proportion in which they combine to form water. The most important
members of this class are the following:

    Cane sugar      C{12}H{22}O{11}.
    Milk sugar      C{12}H{22}O{11}.
    Dextrose        C{6}H{12}O{6}.
    Levulose        C{6}H{12}O{6}.
    Cellulose       C{6}H{10}O{5}.
    Starch          C{6}H{10}0{5}.

~Cane sugar~ (C{12}H{22}O{11}). This is the well-known substance commonly called sugar. It
occurs in many plants especially in the sugar cane and sugar beet. It was formerly obtained
almost entirely from the sugar cane, but at present the greatest amount of it comes from the
sugar beet. The juice from the cane or beet contains the sugar in solution along with many
impurities. These impurities are removed, and the resulting solution is then evaporated until
the sugar crystallizes out. The evaporation is conducted in closed vessels from which the air
is partially exhausted. In this way the boiling point of the solution is lowered and the charring
of the sugar is prevented. It is impossible to remove all the sugar from the solution. In preparing
sugar from sugar cane the liquors left after separating as much of it as possible from the
juice of the cane constitute ordinary molasses. Maple sugar is made by the evaporation of the
sap obtained from a species of the maple tree. Its sweetness is due to the presence of cane
sugar, other products present in the maple sap imparting the distinctive flavor.

This same change is brought about by the action of an enzyme present in the yeast plant. When
yeast is added to a solution of cane sugar fermentation is set up. The cane sugar, however,
does not ferment directly: the enzyme in the yeast first transforms the sugar into dextrose
and levulose, and these sugars then undergo alcoholic fermentation.

When heated to 160° cane sugar melts; if the temperature is increased to about 215°, a partial
decomposition takes place and a brown substance known as caramel forms. This is used largely
as a coloring matter.

~Milk sugar~ (C{12}H{22}O{11}). This sugar is present in the milk of all mammals. The average
composition of cow's milk is as follows:

    Water                        87.17%
    Casein (nitrogenous matter)   3.56
    Butter fat                    3.64
    Milk sugar                    4.88
    Mineral matter                0.75

When rennin, an enzyme obtained from the stomach of calves, is added to milk, the casein separates
and is used in the manufacture of cheese. The remaining liquid contains the milk sugar which
separates on evaporation; it resembles cane sugar in appearance but is not so sweet or soluble.
The souring of milk is due to the fact that the milk sugar present undergoes lactic fermentation
in accordance with the equation

    C{12}H{22}O{11} + H{2}O = 4C{3}H{6}O{3}.

The lactic acid formed causes the separation of the casein, thus giving the well-known appearance
of sour milk.

~Isomeric compounds.~ It will be observed that cane sugar and milk sugar have the same formulas.
Their difference in properties is due to the different arrangement of the atoms in the molecule.
Such compounds are said to be isomeric. Dextrose and levulose are also isomeric.

~Dextrose~ (grape sugar, glucose) (C{6}H{12}O{6}). This sugar is present in many fruits and
is commonly called grape sugar because of its presence in grape juice. It can be obtained by
heating cane sugar with dilute acids, as explained above; also by heating starch with dilute
acids, the change being as follows:

    C{6}H{10}6{5} + H{2}O = C{6}H{12}O{6}.

Pure dextrose is a white crystalline solid, readily soluble in water, and is not so sweet as
cane sugar. In the presence of yeast it undergoes alcoholic fermentation. It is prepared from
starch in large quantities, and being less expensive than cane sugar, is used as a substitute
for it in the manufacture of jellies, jams, molasses, candy, and other sweets. The product
commonly sold under the name of glucose contains about 45% of dextrose.

~Levulose~ (fruit sugar)(C{6}H{12}O{6}). This sugar is a white solid which occurs along with
dextrose in fruits and honey. It undergoes alcoholic fermentation in the presence of yeast.

~Cellulose~ (C{6}H{10}O{5}). This forms the basis of all woody fibers. Cotton and linen are
nearly pure cellulose. It is insoluble in water, alcohol, and dilute acids. Sulphuric acid
slowly converts it into dextrose. Nitric acid forms nitrates similar to nitroglycerin in composition
and explosive properties. These nitrates are variously known as nitrocellulose, pyroxylin,
and gun cotton. When exploded they yield only colorless gases; hence they are used especially
in the manufacture of smokeless gunpowder. Collodion is a solution of nitrocellulose in a mixture
of alcohol and ether. Celluloid is a mixture of nitrocellulose and camphor. Paper consists
mainly of cellulose, the finer grades being made from linen and cotton rags, and the cheaper
grades from straw and wood.

~Starch~ (C{6}H{10}O{5}). This is by far the most abundant carbohydrate found in nature, being
present especially in seeds and tubers. In the United States it is obtained chiefly from corn,
nearly 80% of which is starch. In Europe it is obtained principally from the potato. It consists
of minute granules and is practically insoluble in cold water. These granules differ somewhat
in appearance, according to the source of the starch, so that it is often possible to determine
from what plant the starch was obtained. When heated with water the granules burst and the
starch partially dissolves. Dilute acids, as well as certain enzymes, convert it into dextrose
or similar sugars. When seeds germinate the starch present is converted into soluble sugars,
which are used as food for the growing plant.

~Chemical changes in bread making.~ The average composition of wheat flour is as follows:

    Water.                           13.8%
    Protein (nitrogenous matter)      7.9
    Fats                              1.4
    Starch                           76.4
    Mineral matter                    0.5

In making bread the flour is mixed with water and yeast, and the resulting dough set aside
in a warm place for a few hours. The yeast first converts a portion of the starch into dextrose
or a similar sugar, which then undergoes alcoholic fermentation. The carbon dioxide formed
escapes through the dough, making it light and porous. The yeast plant thrives best at about
30°; hence the necessity for having the dough in a warm place. If the temperature rises above
50°, the vitality of the yeast is destroyed and fermentation ceases. In baking the bread, the
heat expels the alcohol and also expands the bubbles of carbon dioxide caught in the dough,
thus increasing its lightness.

SOME DERIVATIVES OF BENZENE

Attention has been called to the complex nature of coal tar. Among the compounds present are
the hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, naphthalene, and anthracene. These compounds are not only
useful in themselves but serve for the preparation of many other important compounds known
under the general name of coal-tar products.

~Nitrobenzene~ (oil of myrbane) (C{6}H{5}NO{2}). It is a slightly yellowish poisonous liquid,
with a characteristic odor. Its main use is in the manufacture of aniline.

~Aniline~ (C{6}H{5}NH{2}). When nitrobenzene is heated with iron and hydrochloric acid the
hydrogen evolved by the action of the iron upon the acid reduces the nitrobenzene in accordance
with the following equation:

    C{6}H{5}NO{2} + 6H = C{6}H{5}NH{2} + 2H{2}O.

The resulting compound is known as aniline, a liquid boiling at 182°. When first prepared it
is colorless, but darkens on standing. Large quantities of it are used in the manufacture of
the aniline or coal-tar dyes, which include many important compounds.

~Carbolic acid~ (C{6}H{5}OH). This compound, sometimes known as phenol, occurs in coal tar,
and is also prepared from benzene. It forms colorless crystals which are very soluble in water.
It is strongly corrosive and very poisonous.

~Naphthalene and anthracene.~ These are hydrocarbons occurring along with benzene in coal tar.
They are white solids, insoluble in water. The well-known moth balls are made of naphthalene.
Large quantities of naphthalene are used in the preparation of indigo, a dye formerly obtained
from the indigo plant, but now largely prepared by laboratory methods. Similarly anthracene
is used in the preparation of the dye alizarin, which was formerly obtained from the madder root.

THE ALKALOIDS

This term is applied to a group of compounds found in many plants and trees. They all contain
nitrogen, and most of them are characterized by their power to combine with acids to form salts.
This property is indicated by the name alkaloids, which signifies alkali-like. The salts are
soluble in water, and on this account are more largely used than the free alkaloids, which
are insoluble in water. Many of the alkaloids are used in medicine, some of the more important
ones being given below.

~Quinine.~ This alkaloid occurs along with a number of others in the bark of certain trees
which grow in districts in South America and also in Java and other tropical islands. It is
a white solid, and its sulphate is used in medicine in the treatment of fevers.

~Morphine.~ When incisions are made in the unripe capsules of one of the varieties of the poppy
plant, a milky juice exudes which soon thickens. This is removed and partially dried. The resulting
substance is the ordinary opium which contains a number of alkaloids, the principal one being
morphine. This alkaloid is a white solid and is of great service in medicine.

Among the other alkaloids may be mentioned the following: Nicotine, a very poisonous liquid,
the salts of which occur in the leaves of the tobacco plant; cocaine, a crystalline solid present
in coca leaves and used in medicine as a local anæsthetic; atropine, a solid present in the
berry of the deadly nightshade, and used in the treatment of diseases of the eye; strychnine,
a white, intensely poisonous solid present in the seeds of the members of the Strychnos family.

ANNOUNCEMENTS

AN ELEMENTARY STUDY OF CHEMISTRY

By WILLIAM McPHERSON, Professor of Chemistry in Ohio State University, and WILLIAM E. HENDERSON,
Associate Professor of Chemistry in Ohio State University.

12mo. Cloth. 434 pages. Illustrated. List price, $1.25; mailing price, $1.40

This book is the outgrowth of many years of experience in the teaching of elementary chemistry.
In its preparation the authors have steadfastly kept in mind the limitations of the student
to whom chemistry is a new science. They have endeavored to present the subject in a clear,
well-graded way, passing in a natural and logical manner from principles which are readily
understood to those which are more difficult to grasp. The language is simple and as free as
possible from unusual and technical phrases. Those which are unavoidable are carefully defined.
The outline is made very plain, and the paragraphing is designed to be of real assistance to
the student in his reading.

The book is in no way radical, either in the subject-matter selected or in the method of treatment.
At the same time it is in thorough harmony with the most recent developments in chemistry,
both in respect to theory and discovery. Great care has been taken in the theoretical portions
to make the treatment simple and well within the reach of the ability of an elementary student.
The most recent discoveries have been touched upon where they come within the scope of an elementary
text. Especial attention has been given to the practical applications of chemistry, and to
the description of the manufacturing processes in use at the present time.

A LABORATORY COURSE IN PHYSICS

FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS

By ROBERT A. MILLIKAN and HENRY G. GALE 12mo, flexible cloth, 134 pages, illustrated, 40 cents

This one-year course in physics has grown out of the experience of the authors in developing
the work in physics at the School of Education of The University of Chicago, and in dealing
with the physics instruction in affiliated high schools and academies.

The book is a simple, objective presentation of the subject as opposed to a formal and mathematical
one. It is intended for the third-year high-school pupils and is therefore adapted in style
and method of treatment to the needs of students between the ages of fifteen and eighteen.
It especially emphasizes the historical and practical aspects of the subject and connects the
study very intimately with facts of daily observation and experience.

The authors have made a careful distinction between the class of experiments which are essentially
laboratory problems and those which belong more properly to the classroom and the lecture table.
The former are grouped into a Laboratory Manual which is designed for use in connection with
the text. The two books are not, however, organically connected, each being complete in itself.

All the experiments included in the work have been carefully chosen with
reference to their usefulness as effective classroom demonstrations.     Graphite         2.15            --
