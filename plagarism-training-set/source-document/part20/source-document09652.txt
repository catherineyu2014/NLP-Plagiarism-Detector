Matrimony is the ordinary remedy; the civil law will force it; conscience may make it an obligation,
and does make it, unless, in rare cases, there be such absolute incompatibility as to make
such a contract an ineffective and ridiculous one, an inefficient remedy, or none at all. When
such is the case, a pecuniary compensation is the only alternative. A career has been blasted,
a future black with despair stares the victim in the face, if she must face it unaided; a burden
forced upon her that must be borne for years, entailing considerable expense. The man responsible
for such a state of affairs, if he expects pardon for his crime, must shoulder the responsibility
in a manner that will repair at least in part the grave injustice under which his victim labors.

If both share the guilt, then both must share the burden. If one shirks, the other must assume
the whole. The great victim is the child. That child must get a Christian bringing-up, or some
one will suffer for it; its faith must be safeguarded. If this cannot be done at home, then
it must be placed where this can be done. If it is advantageous for the parent or parents that
their offspring be raised in ignorance of its origin, it is far more advantageous for the child
itself. Let it be confided to good hands, but let the money necessary for its support be forthcoming,
since this is the only way to make reparation for the evil of its birth.

I would add a word in regard to the injustice, frequent enough, of too long deferring the fulfilment
of marriage promises. For one party, especially, this period of waiting is precarious, fraught
with danger and dangerous possibilities. Her fidelity makes her sacrifice all other opportunities,
and makes her future happiness depend on the fulfilment of the promise given. Charms do not
last forever; attractions fade with the years. If affection cools, she is helpless to stir
up the embers without unmentionable sacrifice. There is the peril. The man who is responsible
for it, is responsible for a good deal. He is committing an injustice; there is danger of his
not being willing to repair it, danger that he may not be able to repair it. His line of duty
is clear. Unless for reasons of the gravest importance, he cannot in surety of conscience continue
in a line of conduct that is repugnant alike to natural reason and common decency, and that
smacks of moral make-up that would not bear the scrutiny of close investigation.

CHAPTER XCVI. PAYING BACK.

A MAN who has stolen, has nothing more urgent and imperative to perform, on this side of eternity,
than the duty of refunding the money or goods unjustly acquired, or the value thereof. He may
possibly consider something else more important; but if he does, that man has somehow unlearned
the first principles of natural honesty, ignores the fundamental law that governs the universe,
and he will have a difficult time convincing the Almighty that this ignorance of his is not
wholly culpable. The best and only thing for him to do is to make up his mind to pay up, to
disgorge his ill-gotten goods, to make good the losses sustained by his neighbor through his fault.

He may, or may not, have profited to any great extent by his criminal proceedings; but there
is no doubt that his victim suffered injustice; and that precisely is the root of his obligation.
The stolen goods may have perished in his hands and he have nothing to show; the same must
be said of the victim the moment his possessions disappeared; with this difference, however,
that justice was not violated in one case, and in the other, it was. The lawful owner may be
dead, or unfindable among the living; but wherever he may be, he never intended that the thief
should enjoy the fruit of his crime. The latter's title, vitiated in its source, cannot be
improved by any circumstance of the owner's whereabouts. No one may thrive on one's own dishonesty.

You say this is hard; and in so saying, you lend testimony to the truth of the axiom that honesty
is the best policy. There is no one but will agree with you; but such a statement, true though
it be, helps matters very little. It is always hard to do right; blame Adam and Eve for it,
and think of something more practicable. But must I impoverish myself? Not to the extent of
depriving yourself of the necessaries of life. But you must deprive yourself to the extent
of settling your little account, even if you suffer something thereby. But how shall I be able
to refund it all! You may never be able to refund it all; but you may start in immediately
and do the best you can; resolve to keep at it; never revoke your purpose to cancel the debt.
In case your lease of life expires before full justice is done, the Almighty may take into
consideration your motives and opportunities. They do say that hell is paved with good intentions;
but these intentions are of the sort that are satisfied with never coming to a state of realization.

But I shall lose my position, be disgraced, prosecuted and imprisoned. This might happen if
you were to write out a brief of your crime and send the same, signed and sworn to, to your
employer. But this is superfluous. You might omit the details and signature, enclose the sum
and trust luck for the rest. Or you might consult your spiritual adviser; he might have had
some experience in this line of business. The essential is not that you be found out, but that
you refund.

It may happen that several are concerned in a theft. In this case, each and every participant,
in the measure of his guilt, is bound to make restitution. Guilt is the object, restitution
is the shadow; the following is fatal. To order or advise the thing done; to influence efficaciously
its doing; to assist in the deed or to profit knowingly thereby, to shield criminally the culprit,
etc., this sort of co-operation adds to the guilt of sin the burden of restitution. Silence
or inaction, when plain duty would call for words and deeds to prevent crime, incriminates
as well as active participation, and creates an obligation to repair.

There is more. Conspiracy in committing an injustice adds an especial feature to the burden
of restitution. If the parties to the crime had formed a preconcerted plan and worked together
as a whole in its accomplishment, every individual that furnished efficient energy to the success
of the undertaking is liable, in conscience, not for a share of the loss, but for the sum total.
This is what is called solidarity; solidarity in crime begets solidarity in reparation. It
means that the injured party has a just claim for damages, for all damages sustained, against
any one of the culprits, each one of whom, in the event of his making good the whole loss,
has recourse against the others for their share of the obligation. It may happen, and does,
that one or several abscond, and thus shirk their part of the obligation; the burden of restitution
may thus be unevenly distributed. But this is one of the risks that conspirators in sin must
take; the injured party must be protected first and in preference to all others.

No Catholic can validly receive the sacrament of penance who refuses to assume the responsibility
of restitution for injustices committed, and who does not at least promise sincerely to acquit
himself at the first favorable opportunity and to the extent of his capacity. This means that
only on these conditions can the sin be forgiven by God. That man is not disposed sufficiently
to receive absolution who continually neglects opportunities to keep his promise; who refuses
to pay any, because he cannot pay all; who decides to leave the burden of restitution to his
heirs, even with the wherewith to do so. It is better not to go to confession at all than to
go with these dispositions; it is better to wait until you can make up your mind.

CHAPTER XCVII. GETTING RID OF ILL-GOTTEN GOODS.

IT may happen that a person discover among his legitimately acquired possessions something
that does not in reality belong to him. He may have come by it through purchase, donation,
etc.; he kept it in good faith, thinking that he had a clear title to it. He now finds that
there was an error somewhere, and that it is the property of some one else. Of course, he is
not the lawful owner, and does not become such by virtue of his good faith; although, in certain
given circumstances, if the good faith, or ignorance of error, last long enough, a title may
be acquired by prescription, and the possessor become the lawful owner. But we are not considering
the question of prescription.

It is evident, then, that our friend must dispossess himself in favor of the real owner, as
soon as the latter comes upon the scene and proves his claim. But the possessor may in all
innocence have alienated the goods, destroyed or consumed them; or they may have perished through
accident or fatality. In the latter case, nothing remains to refund, no one is to blame, and
the owner must bear the loss. Even in the former case, if the holder can say in conscience
that he in nowise became richer by the possession and use of the goods in question, he is not
bound to make restitution. If, however, there be considerable profits, they rightly belong
to the owner, and the possessor must refund the same.

But the question arises as to how the holder is to be compensated for the expenditure made
in the beginning and in good faith when he purchased the goods which he is now obliged to hand
over to another. Impartial justice demands that when the rightful owner claims his goods, the
holder relinquish them, and he may take what he gets, even if it be nothing. He might claim
a compensation if he purchased what he knew to be another's property, acting in the interests
of that other and with the intention of returning the same to its owner. Otherwise, his claim
is against the one from whom he obtained the article, and not against him to whom he is obliged
to turn it over.

He may, if he be shrewd enough, anticipate the serving of the owner's claim and secure himself
against a possible loss by selling back for a consideration the goods in question to the one
from whom he bought them. But this cannot be done after the claim is presented; besides, this
proceeding must not render it impossible for the owner to recover his property; and he must
be notified as to the whereabouts of said property. This manoeuvre works injustice unto no
one. The owner stands in the same relation to his property as formerly; the subsequent holder
assumes an obligation that was always his, to refund the goods or their value, with recourse
against the antecedent seller.

The moment a person shirks the responsibility of refunding the possessions, by him legitimately
acquired, but belonging rightfully to another, that person becomes a possessor in bad faith
and stands towards the rightful owner in the position of a thief. Not in a thousand years will
he be able to prescribe a just title to the goods. The burden of restitution will forever remain
on him; if the goods perish, no matter how, he must make good the loss to the owner. He must
also disburse the sum total of profits gathered from the illegal use of said goods. If values
fluctuate during the interval of criminal possession, he must compute the amount of his debt
according to the values that prevailed at the time the lawful owner would have disposed of
his goods, had he retained possession.

Finally, there may be a doubt as to whether the object I possess is rightfully mine or not.
I must do my best to solve that doubt and dear the title to ownership. If I fail, I may consider
the object mine and may use it as such. If the owner turn up after the prescribed time, so
much the worse for the owner. An uncertainty may exist, not as to my proprietorship, but as
to whom the thing does belong. If my possession began in good faith and I am unable to determine
the ownership, I may consider myself the owner until further developments shed more light on
the matter.

It is different when the object was originally acquired in bad faith. In such a case, first,
the ill-gotten goods can never be mine; then, there is no sanction in reason, conscience or
law for the conduct of those who run immediately to the first charitable institution and leave
there their conscience money; or who have masses said for the repose of the souls of those
who have been defrauded, before they are dead at all perhaps. My first care must be to locate
the victim; or, if he be certainly deceased or evidently beyond reach, the heirs of the victim
of my fraud. When all means fail and I am unable to find either the owner or his heirs, then,
and not till then, may I dispose of the goods in question. I must assume in such a contingency
as this, that the will of the owner would be to expend the sum on the most worthy cause; and
that is charity. The only choice then that remains with me is, what hospital, asylum or other
enterprise of charity is to profit by my sins, since I myself cannot be a gainer in the premises.

It might be well to remark here that one is not obliged to make restitution for more than the
damages call for. Earnestness is a good sign, but it should not blind us or drive us to an
excess of zeal detrimental to our own lawful interests. When there is a reasonable and insolvable
doubt as to the amount of reparation to be made, it is just that such a doubt favor us. If
we are not sure if it be a little more or a little less, the value we are to refund, we may
benefit by the uncertainty and make the burden we assume as light as in all reason it can be
made. And even if we should happen to err on the side of mercy to ourselves, without our fault,
justice is satisfied, being fallible like all things human.

CHAPTER XCVIII. WHAT EXCUSES FROM RESTITUTION.

THOSE who do not obtain full justice from man in this world will obtain it in the next from
God. If we do not meet our obligations this side of the tribunal of the just Judge, He will
see to it that our accounts are equitably balanced when the time for the final reckoning comes.
This supposes, naturally, that non-fulfilment of obligations is due on our part to unwillingness--a
positive refusal, or its equivalent, wilful neglect, to undo the wrongs committed. For right
reason and God's mercy must recognize the existence of a state of unfeigned and hopeless disability,
when it is impossible for the delinquent to furnish the wherewithal to repair the evils of
which he has been guilty. When this condition is permanent, and is beyond all remedy, all claims
are extinguished against the culprit, and all losses incurred must be ascribed to "an act of
God," as the coroner says. For no mart can be held to what is impossible.

Chief among these moral, as well as legal, bankrupts is the good-for-nothing fellow who is
sorry too late, who has nothing, has no hopes of ever having anything, and who therefore can
give nothing. You cannot extract blood from a beet, nor shekels from an empty purse. Then a
man may lose all his belongings in a catastrophe, and after striving by labor and economy to
pay off his debts, may see himself obliged to give up the task through sickness, misfortune
or other good causes. He has given all he has, he cannot give more. Even though liabilities
were stacked up mountain-high against him, he cannot be held morally responsible, and his creditors
must attribute their losses to the misfortune of life--a rather unsubstantial consolation,
but as good a one as the poor debtor has.

There are other cases where the obligations of restitution are not annulled, but only cancelled
for the time being, until such a time as circumstances permit their being met without grave
disaster to the debtor. The latter may be in such a position that extreme, or great, want would
stare him in the face, if he parted with what he possesses to make restitution. The difficulty
here is out of all proportion with the injustice committed for, after all, one must live, and
charity begins at home, our first duty is toward ourselves. The creditors of this man have
no just claim against him until he improves his circumstances; in the meantime, the burden
of responsibility is lifted from his shoulders.

The same must be said when the paying off of a debt at any particular time, be it long or short,
would cripple a man's finances, wipe out his earnings to such an extent as to make him fall
considerably below his present position in life. We might take a case during the late coal
famine, of a man who, in order to fill his contracts of coal at six dollars a ton, would be
obliged to buy it at fifteen and twenty dollars a ton; and thereby sacrifice his fortune. The
thing could not be expected, it is preposterous. His obligee must wait and hope for better times.

A man's family is a part of himself. Therefore the payment of a just debt may be deferred In
order to shield from want parents, wife, children, brothers or sisters. Life, limb and reputation
are greater possessions than riches; consequently, rather than jeopardize these, one may, for
the time, put aside his obligations to make restitution.

All this supposes, of course, that during the interval of delay the creditor does not suffer
inconveniences greater than, or as great as, those the debtor seeks to avoid. The latter's
right to defer payment ceases to exist the moment it comes into conflict with an equal right
of the former to said payment. It is against reason to expect that, after suffering a first
injustice, the victim should suffer a second in order to spare the guilty party a lesser or
an equal injury. Preference therefore must be given to the creditor over the debtor when the
necessity for sacrifice is equal, and leniency must be refused when it becomes cruelty to the
former.

Outside these circumstances, which are rare indeed, it will be seen at once that the creditor
may act an unjust part in pressing claims that accidentally and temporarily become invalid.
He has a right to his own, but he is not justified in vindicating that right, if in so doing,
he inflicts more damage than equity calls for. The culprit has a right not to suffer more than
he deserves, and it is mock justice that does not respect that right. If the creditor does
suffer some loss by the delay, this might be a circumstance to remember at the final settlement
but for the present, there is an impediment to the working of justice, placed by the fatal
order of things and it is beyond power to remove it.

CHAPTER XCIX. DEBTS.

BEFORE closing our remarks, necessarily brief and incomplete, on this subject, so vast and
comprehensive, we desire in a few words to pay our respects to that particular form of injustice,
more common perhaps than all others combined, which is known as criminal debt, likewise, to
its agent, the most brazen impostor and unconscionable fraud that afflicts society, the man
who owes and will not pay. More people suffer from bad debts than from stealing and destruction
of property. It is easier to contract a debt, or to borrow a trifle, than to steal it outright;
it is safer, too. Imprudence is one of the chief characteristics of this genus of iniquity.
"I would sooner owe you this than cheat you out of it:" this, in word or deed, is the highly
spiritual consolation they offer those whom they fleece and then laugh at.

The wilful debtor is, first of all, a thief and a robber, because he retains unjustly the lawful
possessions of another. There is no difference between taking and keeping what belongs to the
neighbor. The loss is the same to a man whether he is robbed of a certain amount or sells goods
for which he gets nothing in return. The injustice is the same in both cases, the malice identical.
He therefore who can pay his debts, and will not, must be branded as a thief and an enemy to
the rights of property.

The debtor is guilty of a second crime, of dishonesty and fraud against his fellow-man, by
reason of his breaking a contract, entered upon with a party in good faith, and binding in
conscience until cancelled by fulfilment. When a man borrows or buys or runs an account on
credit, he agrees to return a quid pro quo, an equivalent for value received. When he fails
to do so, he violates his contract, breaks his pledge of honor, obtains goods under false pretense.
Even if he is sincere at the time of the making of the contract, the crime is perpetrated the
moment he becomes a guilty debtor by repudiating, in one way or another, his just debts. Now,
to injure a person is wrong; to break faith with him at one and the same time is to incur guilt
of a double dye.

There is likewise an element of contumely and outrage in such dishonest operations; the affront
offered the victim is contemptible. Men have often been heard to say, after being victimized
by imposture of this sort: "I do not mind the loss so much, but I do object to being treated
like a fool and a monkey." One's feelings suffer more than one's purse. Especially is this
the case when the credit is given or a loan made as a favor or service, intended or requested,
only to be requited by the blackest kind of ingratitude.

And let us not forget the extent of damage wrought unto worthy people in hard circumstances
who are shut out from the advantages of borrowing and buying on credit by the nefarious practices
of dishonest borrowers and buyers. A burnt child keeps away from the fire. A man, after being
defrauded palpably a few times, acquires the habit of refusing all credit; and he turns down
many who deserve better, because of the persecution to which he is subjected by rogues and
scoundrels. Every criminal debtor contributes to that state of affairs and shares the responsibility
of causing honest people to suffer want through inability to get credit.

And who are the persons thus guilty of a manifold guilt? They are those who borrow and buy
knowing full well they will not pay, pile debt upon debt knowing full well they cannot pay.
Others, who do not repudiate openly their obligations, put off paying indefinitely for futile
reasons: hard times, that last forever; ships coming in, whose fate is yet unlearned; windfalls
from rich relatives that are not yet born, etc.; and from delay to delay they become not only
less able, but less willing, to settle their accounts. Sometimes you meet a fellow anxious
to square himself for the total amount; half his assets is negotiable, the other half is gall.
He threatens you with the alternative of half or none; he wants you to accept his impudence
at the same figures at which he himself values it. And this schemer usually succeeds in his
endeavor.

Others there are who protest their determination to pay up, even to the last cent; their dun-bills
are always kept in sight, lest they forget their obligations; they treasure these bills, as
one treasures a thing of immense value. But they live beyond their means and income, purchase
pleasure and luxury, refuse to curtail frivolous expenses and extravagant outlay. And in the
meantime their debts remain in status quo, unredeemed and less and less redeemable, their determination
holds good, apparently; and the creditor breaks commandments looking on and hoping.

Some do violence to their thinking faculty by trying to find justification, somehow, for not
paying their debts. The creditor is dead, they say; or he has plenty and can well afford to
be generous. An attempt is often made at establishing a case of occult compensation, its only
merit being its ingenuity, worthy of a better cause. All such lame excuses argue a deeper perversity
of will, a malice well-nigh incurable; but they do not satisfy justice, because they are not
founded on truth.

A debt has a character of sacredness, like all moral obligations; more sacred than many other
moral obligations, because this quality is taken directly from the eternal prototype of justice,
which is God. You cannot wilfully repudiate it therefore without repudiating God. You must
respect it as you respect Him. Your sins and your debts will follow you before the throne of
God. God alone is concerned with your sins; but with your debts a third party is concerned.
And if God may easily waive His claims against you as a sinner, a sterner necessity may influence
His judgment of you as a debtor, through respect for the inviolable rights of that third party
who does not forgive so readily.
