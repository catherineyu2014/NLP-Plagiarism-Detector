  He was destined in after years for situations
which were beyond his power to deal with, and for problems that were beyond his grasp; but
here at least he was supreme, master of himself and of his material, and a ruler over circumstances.
The supreme thing that he had professed to be able to do and which he had guaranteed to do
was, in the sublime simplicity of his own phrase, "to discover new lands," and luck or no luck,
help or hindrance, he did it at the very first attempt and in the space of thirty-five days.
And although it was from the Pinta that the gun was fired, and the first loom of the actual
land seen in the early morning, I am glad to think that, of all the number of eager watching
men, it was Columbus who first saw the dim tossing light that told him his journey was at an end.
