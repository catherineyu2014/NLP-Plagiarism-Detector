As the devil is a deceiver, and hath the knowledge of the virtue of herbs, so he did show the
virtue of this herb, that by the means thereof they might see their imaginations and visions
that he hath represented unto them.

WHISKY.

From official documents it appears that long previous to 1690, there had been a distillery
of aqua vitae, or whisky, on the lands of Farintosh, belonging to Mr. Forbes, of Culloden.

TRAVELLING INCENTIVES.

If there be a sudden accession of fortune, the earliest use of it is in passing over to the
continent; if misfortunes occur, the first suggestion is that of seeking solace in another
land. The assumption of the toga virilis by our youth, may be practically translated, the putting
on of the travelling cloak. Marriage, instead of being the means of more extended family union,
is the plea for immediate separation; and the newly-married pair drive from the church to the
packet-boat. If the elders of a family are snatched away by death, the first idea which occurs
to their successors, is that of distant removal from home. Sorrows are not endured, but fled
from; and misfortune becomes the signal for dispersion to those who survive it.--Q. Rev.

Christoval Acosta, speaking of the pine-apple, says that "no medicinal virtues have been discovered
in it, and it is good for nothing but to eat."

SMOKING.

Joshuah Silvester questioned whether the devil had done more harm in latter ages by means of
fire and smoke, through the invention of guns, or of tobacco-pipes; and he conjectured that
Satan introduced the fashion, as a preparatory course of smoking for those who were to be matriculated
in his own college:

As roguing Gipsies tan their little elves, To make them tann'd and ugly, like themselves.

LAW

Must be kept as a garden, with frequent digging, weeding, turning, &c., for that which was
in one age convenient, and, perhaps, necessary, becomes in another prejudicial.--Roger North.

THE WIFE'S COMPLAINT.

Havard, the actor, (better known from the urbanity of his manners, by the familiar name of
Billy Havard) had the misfortune to be married to a most notorious shrew and drunkard. One
day dining at Garrick's, he was complaining of a violent pain in his side. Mrs. Garrick offered
to prescribe for him. "No, no," said her husband; "that will not do, my dear; Billy has mistaken
his disorder; his great complaint lies in his rib."

HOW TO SECURE A COACH.

A facetious friend of Dr. Kitchiner's, on a very wet night, after several messengers, whom
he had despatched for a coach, had returned without obtaining one; at last, at "past one o'clock,
and a rainy morning," the wag walked himself to the next coach-stand, and politely advised
the waterman to mend his inside lining with a pint of beer, and go home to bed; for said he,
"there will be nothing for you to do to night, I'll lay you a shilling that there's not a coach
out." "Why, will you, your honour? then done," cried Mr. Waterman; "but are you really serious,
'cause, if so be as you be, I must make haste and go and get one." Being assured he would certainly
touch the twelvepenny if he did, he trotted off on his "nag a ten toes," and in ten minutes
returned with a leathern conveyance.

ONION SOUP

Is thought highly restorative by the French. It is considered peculiarly grateful, and gently
stimulating to the stomach, after hard drinking or night-watching, and holds among soups the
place that champagne, soda-water, or ginger-beer, does among liquors.

Lobsters and crabs are in season from March till October; so that they supply the place of
oysters, which come in about the time lobsters go out of season. Lobsters are held in great
esteem by gastrologers for the firmness, purity, and flavour of their flesh. When they find
refuge in the rocky fastnesses of the deep from the rapacity of sharks and fishermen, they
sometimes attain an immense size, and have been found from eighteen inches to upwards of two
feet in length. Apicius, who ought to be the patron saint of epicures, made a voyage to the
coast of Africa on hearing that lobsters of an unusually large size were to be found there,
and, after encountering much distress at sea, met with a disappointment. Very large lobsters
are at present found on the coasts of Orkney. Some naturalists affirm (Olaus Magnus and Gesner,)
that in the Indian seas, and on the wild shores of Norway, lobsters have been found twelve
feet in length, and six in breadth, which seize mariners in their terrible embrace, and, dragging
them into their caverns, devour them. However this may be, the lobsters and crabs for being
devoured are best when of the middle size, and when found on reefs or very rocky shores.

THE INVISIBLE HAIR.

A monk was showing the relics of his convent before a numerous assembly; the most rare, in
his opinion, was a hair of the Holy Virgin, which he appeared to show to the people present,
opening his hands as if he were drawing it through them. A peasant approached with great curiosity,
and exclaimed, "but, reverend father, I see nothing." "Egad, I believe it" replied the monk,
"for I have shown the hair for twenty years, and have not yet beheld it myself."

CURIOSITY CURED.

A servant travelling, was bothered by a super-curious person, who, after several indirect attempts
to discover whence he came, or whither he was going, at last popt the question plainly, "Are
your family before?"--"No."--"Oh! you left them behind, I suppose?"--"No" "No?"--"No, they
are on one side!"

TO GROW A SHOULDER OR LEG OF MUTTON.

This art is well known to the London bakers. Have a very small leg or shoulder; change it upon
a customer for one a little larger, and that upon another for one better still, till by the
dinner hour you have a heavy, excellent joint in lieu of your original small one. FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 1: The grief of Ferdinand, King of Arragon, for the loss of his brother, Don Pedro,
who was killed during the siege of Naples, is affectingly described by the historian Mariana.
It is also the subject of one of the old Spanish ballads, in Lockhart's beautiful collection.]
