  "Two months and two magistrates: I sit alone.
  Well, Clerk, we must halve it--commit him for one."

HUDSON AND HIS PIGS.

The following is extracted from a recent American (private) letter:--

Hudson, who is a general dealer, purchased a cottage, to which pertained amongst other furniture
a sty. As this was of course uninhabited, his first care was to supply it with inmates, and,
having purchased a couple of fine pigs, he set off homewards with his bargains comfortably
lodged in his cart. Upon arriving at Buenos Ayres, a part of the harness broke, down went the
cart, and out shot Hudson and his bristly companions backwards; but unfortunately falling upon
one of the poor animals, he crushed him to death. This was bad, Hudson looked blank, as who
does not upon perceiving Dame Fortune playing him foul? and woeful was it indeed to witness
death amongst his live stock; in this dilemma however, his wits did not utterly forsake him,
and concluding that if he could make the animal bleed, it would probably be marketable and
not prove a dead loss, he proceeded to act on this prudent supposition, and immediately cut
its throat; which sanguinary act so alarmed the companion pig, that taking to his heels, he
instantly made off (like his swinish brethren of old) towards the sea. Poor Hudson, between
the dead and the living pig, was dreadfully distressed, being apprehensive of losing both;
however being fortunate enough to engage a man to pursue the absconded delinquent, he proceeded
home with the defunct, and by dint of ablutions, and scrapings, &c. really made of it "a very
pretty pig." This done, it was hung up in the dairy or beer-cellar, I know not which, ready
for market, and if Hudson plumed himself upon cheating fortune at least in one instance, he
was not to blame; but, lo! in the morning, poor pig, presented a hideous and horrible spectacle,
and poor Hudson stood aghast to behold it! The cats had made during the night so plentiful
a repast upon his new purchase, so that instead of a handsome corpse there remained only a
mangled assemblage of bloody bones, and fragments of flesh! Poor Hudson! but after all, these
misfortunes were mainly attributable to his own carelessness, and as to whether he ever recovered
his truant pig, I cannot say; perhaps the man may be in pursuit of him still.

ON A PERSON SAYING HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON MUSIC.

  On music that you spend your time,
    You surely can't mean what you say,
  For all who know you must allow
    You keep time whilst you sing or play.
