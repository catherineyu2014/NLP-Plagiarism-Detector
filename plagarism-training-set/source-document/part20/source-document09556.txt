It may be that the salt of the coast region is essential to the well-being of the reindeer;
it is not so with the caribou--and the reindeer is nothing but a domesticated caribou--many
herds of which, in the interior of Alaska, never visit the coast at all; but all caribou herds
have their salt-licks, and one wishes that the oft-recommended plan of furnishing salt for
the herds in the interior had been adopted by the government for a season before their removal
was determined upon.

Like most other "resources" of Alaska, the imported reindeer, at first decried and ridiculed,
has now become the slender foundation for extravagant speculations of prosperity. The "millions
of acres waiting for the plough" in the interior have lately been supplemented in this visionary
treasury by the capitalisation of the vast tundras of the coast, the golden wheat-fields of
the one finding counterpart in the multitudinous herds of the other. The growing dearth of
cattle-range in the United States offers, it seems, to Alaska the opportunity of supplying
the American market with meat, and the kindling fancy of the enthusiastic "booster" sees trains
loaded with frozen reindeer meat rolling into Chicago.

While the reindeer will never supersede the dog as a draught animal anywhere, the horse is
rapidly superseding him on good trails in the more settled and peopled regions. In the Fairbanks
and Nome districts, in the Circle and Koyukuk districts, in the Fortymile and in the Iditarod--in
all districts where any extensive mining is carried on--heavy freights are moved by horses,
and this tendency will doubtless increase rather than diminish. The dog team cannot compete
with the horse team when it comes to moving heavy loads over good trails. The grain that the
horse eats is imported, and in the main will probably always be imported, but oats cut green
and properly cared for make excellent fodder, and the native hay, while not nearly as nutritious
as the imported timothy, will sufficiently supplement grain.

We hear a great deal nowadays of the benefits which are to come to Alaska from the railroad
which the United States is expected to build from tide-water to the Yukon, and the clamorous
voices of the journalist and the professional promoter and politician, which seem the only
voices which ever reach the ear of government, are insistent that this is the one great thing
that will bring prosperity to the country. Yet the writer is confident that he expresses almost
the unanimous opinion of those who live in the country, outside of the classes mentioned, when
he says that if the amount of money which this railroad will cost were expended upon good highways
and trails the benefit would be much greater. It is means of intercommunication between the
various parts of the country that is the great need of Alaska; some of its most promising sections
are almost inaccessible now or accessible only at great trouble and expense. Access to the
country itself, for the introduction of merchandise, is furnished easily enough during three
or four months of the year by its incomparable system of waterways. Good highways, well engineered
and well maintained, over which horse teams could be used summer and winter, would remove much
of what at present is the almost prohibitive cost of distributing that merchandise from river
points. Such roads would give an enormous stimulus to prospecting, and would render it possible
to work gold placers all over the country that are of too low grade to be worked at the present
rates of transportation. A really good highway from Valdez to Fairbanks and the making of the
long-ago begun Valdez-Eagle road; a good highway from Fairbanks to the upper Tanana as far
as the Nabesna, connecting with the one from the Copper River country and the coast; another
from the Yukon into the Koyukuk and the Chandalar; another from Fairbanks into the Kantishna,
connecting with one from the lower Kuskokwim and one from the Iditarod; a road from Eagle across
the almost unknown region (save for the line of the 141st meridian) between the Yukon and the
Porcupine Rivers; two or three roads between the Yukon and the Tanana; a road from the Koyukuk
to Kotzebue Sound--these would constitute main arteries of travel and would open up the country
as no trunk railroad will ever do. The expense would be great, both of construction and maintenance,
but it would probably not be greater than the cost of constructing and maintaining the proposed
railroad. Twenty or thirty ordinary freight trains a year would bring in all the goods that
Alaska consumes. Before that amount can be very greatly increased there must be a large development
of the means by which it is to be distributed throughout the country.

Some day, perhaps, these roads will be made, and the horse, not the dog, will be the draught
animal upon them. Yet it would be a rash conclusion that even then the time will be at hand
when there will be no longer use for the work dog in Alaska. Away from these main arteries
of travel he will still be employed. So long as great part of the land remains a noble arctic
wilderness; so long as the prospector strikes farther and farther into the rugged mountains;
so long as quick travel over great stretches of country is necessary or desirable; so long
as the salmon swarm up the rivers to furnish food for the catching; so long as the Indian moves
from fishing camp to village and from village to hunting camp--so long will the dog be hitched
to the sled in Alaska; so long will his joyful yelp and his plaintive whine be heard in the
land; so long will his warm tongue seek his master's hand, even the hand that strikes him,
and his eloquent eyes speak his utter allegiance.
