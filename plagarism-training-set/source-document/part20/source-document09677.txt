Sir Walter Scott was the third son of Walter Scott, Esq., Writer to the Signet, in Edinburgh,
and Anne, daughter of Dr. John Rutherford, Professor of Medicine in the University of the above
city. His ancestry numbers several distinguished persons; though the well-earned fame of Sir
Walter Scott readers his pedigree comparatively uninteresting; inasmuch as it illustrates the
saw of an olden poet, that

  Learning is an addition beyond
  Nobility of birth: honour of blood,
  Without the ornament of knowledge, is
  A glorious ignorance.

SHIRLEY.

Sir Walter was born at Edinburgh, on the 15th of August, 1771--or, on the birthday of Napoleon
Buonaparte. His father was a man of prosperous fortune and good report; and for many years
was "an elder in the parish church of Old Grey Friars, while Dr. Robertson, the historian,
acted as one of the ministers. The other clergyman was Dr. John Erskine, of whom Sir Walter
has given an animated picture in his novel of Guy Mannering."[1] Mrs. Scott is described as
a well-educated gentlewoman, possessing considerable natural talents; though she did not enjoy
the acquaintance of Allan Ramsay, Blacklock, Beattie, and Burns, as has been stated by some
biographers. She, however, advantageously mixed in literary society, and from her superintendence
of the early education of her eldest son, Walter, there is reason to infer that such advantages
may have influenced his habits and taste. He was the third of a family, consisting of six sons
and one daughter. The cleverest of the sons is stated by Sir Walter to have been Daniel, a
sailor, who died young. Thomas, the next brother to Sir Walter, was a man of considerable talent,
and before the avowal of the authorship of the Waverley Novels, report ascribed to him a great
part or the whole of them.

    [2] General Preface to the Waverley Novels, 41 vols.

The house in which Sir Walter Scott was born no longer exists. It was situated at the head
of the College Wynd, at its entrance into North College-street. It was thus described by Sir
Walter in 1825:--"It consisted of two flats above Mr. Keith's, and belonged to my father, Mr.
Walter Scott, Writer to the Signet. There I had the chance to be born, 15th of August, 1771.
My father, soon after my birth, removed to George's Square, and let the house in the College
Wynd, first to Mr. Dundas, of Philipstoun, and afterwards to Mr. William Keith, father of Sir
Alexander Keith. It was purchased by the public, together with Mr. Keith's (the inferior floors),
and pulled down to make way for the new College."

CHILDHOOD.

Mr. Cunningham relates some interesting particulars of this period. Before Sir Walter was two
years old, his nurse let him fall out of her arms, so as to injure his right foot, and render
him lame for life: "This accident did not otherwise affect his health; he was, as I have been
informed by a lady who chanced to live near him, a remarkably active and dauntless boy, full
of all manner of fun, and ready for all manner of mischief. He calls himself, in one of his
introductions to Marmion--

    A self-willed imp; a grondame's child;

and I have heard it averred, that the circumstance of his lame foot prompted him to take the
lead among all the stirring boys in the street where he lived, or the school which he attended:
he desired, perhaps, to show them, that there was a spirit which could triumph over all impediments."[3]
If this statement be correct, it is a somewhat remarkable coincidence with the circumstance
of Lord Byron's lameness; though, happily, the influence of the accident on the temperament
of Scott is not traceable beyond his early years.

Sir Walter was subsequently removed from Edinburgh, for the improvement of his health, to the
farm-house of Sandyknowe, then inhabited by his paternal grandfather, and situated in the loveliest
part of the Vale of Tweed. In the neighbourhood, upon a considerable eminence, stands Smailholm
Tower, a Border fort which the future poet enshrined in his admirable ballad, The Eve of St.
John. The romantic influence of the scenery of the whole district is told with much vigour
and sweetness in the introduction to the third canto of Marmion.

EDUCATION.

Little is known of the schooldom of Scott, that denotes anything like precocious talent. It
is, however better ascertained that his early rambles amidst the Tweed scenery retarded his
educational pursuits. He received the rudiments of knowledge under the home tuition of his
mother; next attended an ordinary school at Edinburgh, and was then placed at the High School,
his name first appearing in the school register in the year 1779. His masters, Mr. Luke Fraser,
and Dr. Adam, were erudite and pains-taking teachers; but, to borrow a phrase from Montaigne,
they could neither lodge it with him, nor make him espouse it, and Chambers illustratively
relates, "apparently, neither the care of the master, nor the inborn genius of the pupil, availed
much in this case; for it is said that the twenty-fifth place was no uncommon situation in
the class for the future Author of the Waverley Novels." Perhaps the only anecdote of any early
indication of talent that can be relied on is that related by Mr. Cunningham, of Burns:--"The
poet, while at Professor Ferguson's one day, was struck by some lines attached to a print of
a Soldier dying in the snow, and inquired who was the author: none of the old or the learned
spoke, when the future author of Marmion answered, 'They are by Langhorne.' Burns, fixing his
large, bright eyes on the boy, and, striding up to him, said, it is no common course of reading
which has taught you this--'this lad,' said he to the company, will be heard of yet."

At school, Sir Walter represents himself to have excelled in what may be termed the art, or,
as Swift calls it, the "knack," of narrating a story, which, by the way, is as companionable
an acquirement at school as elsewhere.

This excellence in tale-telling drew Scott's attention from graver studies; but it was an indication
of genius which may be regarded as the corner-stone of his future fame. This reminds us of
Steele's idea, that "a story-teller is born as well as a poet." Scott, about this time, received
some instructions in music, which was then considered a branch of ordinary education in Scotland;
but the future poet, to use a familiar expression, wanted "an ear." Throughout life he, however,
was highly susceptible of the delights of music, though his own execution was confined to a
single song, with which he attempted to enliven the social board, but, it is stated, with such
unmusical oddity as to content his hearers with a single specimen of his vocal talent. His
early rambles around the "hills and holms of the border," is said to have kindled in Scott
the love of painting landscapes, not strictly in accordance with the rules of art, though certainly
from nature herself. Such attempts in art, by the way, are by no means uncommon in the early
lives of men of genius; and, they are to be regarded, in many instances as their earliest appreciation
of the beauties of nature.

In 1783, Scott was placed at the University of Edinburgh, where his studies were as irregular
as at the High School: at the latter he is said to have made his first attempt at versification
in the description of a thunderstorm in six lines, the recital of which afforded his mother
considerable pleasure and promise; and, on another occasion, he is stated to have remarked,
during a journey over a sterile district of Scotland, in a day of drizzling rain, "It is only
nature weeping for the barrenness of her soil."

LOVE OF READING.

Scott's early love of reading is described to have been of enthusiastic character, and to have
been fostered by an accident at this period of his life.

Upon the re-establishment of his health, Scott returned to Edinburgh, and resumed his studies
in the law, which had been interrupted by illness. He states his progress to have been neither
slow nor unsatisfactory, though by others he is said to have been an indolent student. He speaks
of his "severe studies" occupying the greater part of his time, and amidst their dulness he
seems to have underrated the incidents of his private life, which he afterwards related to
the world with some share of self-satisfaction.

He appears to have succeeded tolerably in his legal lucubrations; for, in 1792, he was called
to the bar as an advocate. He established himself in good style in Edinburgh, but had little
practice; though the accounts of his progress are somewhat contradictory. That he passed much
of his time in acquiring other than professional knowledge is more certain, though he rarely
attempted composition. Mr. Chambers, with all his diligence and advantages for research, (and
they are very meritorious and considerable,) "has not been able to detect any fugitive pieces
of Sir Walter's in any of the periodical publications of the day, nor even any attempt to get
one intruded (?) unless the following notice in Dr. Anderson's Bee for May 9, 1792, refers
to him:--'The Editor regrets that the verses of W.S. are too defective for publication.'"

FIRST LITERARY ATTEMPTS.

About this time Sir Walter employed his leisure in collecting the ballad poetry of the Scottish
Border. His inducement to this task was subsequently described by him as follows:--

"A period," says Sir Walter, "when this particular taste for the popular ballad was in the
most extravagant degree of fashion, became the occasion, unexpectedly indeed, of my deserting
the profession to which I was educated, and in which I had sufficiently advantageous prospects
for a person of limited ambition. * * I may remark that, although the assertion has been made,
it is a mistake to suppose that my situation in life or place in society were materially altered
by such success as I attained in literary attempts. My birth, without giving the least pretension
to distinction, was that of a gentleman, and connected me with several respectable families
and accomplished persons. My education had been a good one, although I was deprived of its
full benefit by indifferent health, just at the period when I ought to have been most sedulous
in improving it." He then describes his circumstances as easy, with a moderate degree of business
for his standing, and "the friendship of more than one person of consideration, efficiently
disposed to aid his views in life." In short, he describes himself as "beyond all apprehension
of want." He then notices the low ebb of poetry in Britain for the previous ten years; the
fashionable but slender poetical reputation of Hayley, then in the wane; "the Bard of Memory
slumbered on his laurels, and he of Hope had scarce begun to attract his share of public attention;"
Cowper was dead, and had not left an extensive popularity; "Burns, whose genius our southern
neighbours could hardly yet comprehend, had long confined himself to song-writing; and the
realms of Parnassus seemed to lie open to the first bold invader." The gradual introduction
of German literature into this country during such a dearth of native talent, now led Sir Walter
to the study of the German language. He also became acquainted with Mr. G. Lewis, author of
The Monk, who had already published some successful imitations of the German ballad school.
"Out of this acquaintance," says Sir Walter, "consequences arose, which altered almost all
the Scottish ballad-maker's future prospects of life. In early youth I had been an eager student
of ballad poetry, and the tree is still in my recollection, beneath which I lay and first entered
upon the enchanting perusal of Percy's Reliques of Ancient Poetry. The taste of another person
had strongly encouraged my own researches into this species of legendary lore; but I had never
dreamed of an attempt to imitate what gave me so much pleasure." He then speaks of some successful
metrical translations which he made at the High School; but in original rhyme he was less fortunate.
"In short," says Sir Walter, "except the usual tribute to a mistress' eyebrow, which is the
language of passion rather than poetry, I had not for ten years indulged the wish to couple
so much as love and dove, when finding Lewis in possession of so much reputation, and, conceiving
that, if I fell behind him in poetical powers, I considerably exceeded him in general information,
I suddenly took it into my head to attempt the style by which he had raised himself to fame."
Sir Walter next hearing a striking passage from Mr. W. Taylor's translation of Bürger's Leonore,
was induced to procure a copy of the original poem from Germany, and "the book had only been
a few hours in my possession, when I found myself giving an animated account of the poem to
a friend, and rashly added a promise to furnish a copy in English ballad verse. I well recollect
that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak the next morning, (it consists
of 66 stanzas,) by which time the ideas which the task had a tendency to summon up, were rather
of an uncomfortable character." This failure did not discourage Sir Walter; for, early in 1799
he published Goetz of Berlinchingen, a tragedy, from the German of Goëthe. We thus see that
Sir Walter did not conceal his obligation to Lewis, for his aid in his translations; but Lord
Byron's assertion that Monk Lewis corrected Scott's verse, and that he understood little then
of the mechanical part of it--is far from true, as a comparison of their productions warrants
us to conclude.

Sir Walter's first attempt at originality was in ballad poetry. He says:--"The ballad called
Glenfinlas was, I think, the first original poem which I ventured to compose. After Glenfinlas,
I undertook another ballad, called The Eve of St. John. The incidents, except the hints alluded
to in the notes, are entirely imaginary; but the scene was that of my early childhood. Some
idle persons had of late years during the proprietor's absence, torn down the iron-grated door
of Smailholm Tower from its hinges, and thrown it down the rock." Sir Walter prevailed on the
proprietor to repair the mischief, on condition that the young poet should write a ballad,
of which the scene should lie at Smailholm Tower, and among the crags where it is situated.
The ballad, as well as Glenfinlas, was approved of, and procured Sir Walter many marks of attention
and kindness from Duke John of Roxburgh, who gave him the unlimited use of the Roxburgh club
library.

MINSTRELSY OF THE SCOTTISH BORDER.

This work, although not original, may be said to be the superstructure of Sir Walter Scott's
fame. It consists, as we have already hinted, of the ballad poetry of the Border district;
but to obtain this vernacular literature was not the work of mere compilation. The editor's
task was not performed in the closet, but in a sort of literary pilgrimage through a land of
song, story, and romance. The farmers and peasantry from whose recitation the ballads were
to be set down, were a primitive race; and the country among which oral traditions, anecdotes,
and legends were to be collected for notes illustrative of the ballads, was of the most romantic
character. Sir Walter found the most fertile field in the pastoral vale of Liddesdale, whither
he travelled in an old gig with Mr. Shortreed, an intelligent observer of the manners of the
people. In these researches, Sir Walter evinced a most retentive memory: he is stated to have
used neither pencil nor pen, but to have made his own memoranda by cutting notches on twigs,
or small sticks.[6] The Minstrelsy was published in 1802, in two volumes; it was reprinted
in the following year with a third volume, of imitations, by Scott and others, of the ancient
ballad; but Sir Walter refers to the second edition as rather a heavy concern.

    [6] Many anecdotes are related in illustration of Sir Walter
        Scott's excellent memory. The Ettrick Shepherd tells of
        his attempting to sing his ballad of Gilmanscleuch,
        which had never been printed or penned, but which the
        Shepherd had sung once over to Sir Walter three years
        previously. On the second attempt to sing it, says the
        Shepherd, "in the eighth or ninth verse, I stuck in it,
        and could not get on with another line; on which he (Sir
        Walter) began it a second time, and recited it every word
        from beginning to the end of the eighty-eighth stanza:"
        and, on the Shepherd expressing his astonishment, Sir
        Walter related that he had recited that ballad and one of
        Southey's, but which ballads he had only heard once from
        their respective authors, and he believed he had recited
        them both without missing a word. Sir Walter also used to
        relate that his friend, Mr. Thomas Campbell, called upon
        him one evening to show him the manuscript of a poem he
        had written--The Pleasures of Hope. Sir Walter happened
        to have some fine old whisky in his house, and his friend
        sat down and had a tumbler or two of punch. Mr. Campbell
        left him, but Sir Walter thought he would dip into the
        manuscript before going to bed. He opened it, read, and
        read again--charmed with the classical grace, purity, and
        stateliness of that finest of all our modern didactic
        poems. Next morning Mr. Campbell again called, when to his
        inexpressible surprise, his friend on returning the
        manuscript to its owner, said he should guard well against
        piracy, for that he himself could repeat the poem from
        beginning to end! The poet dared him to the task, when Sir
        Walter Scott began and actually repeated the whole,
        consisting of more than two thousand lines, with the
        omission of only a few couplets.--Inverness Courier.

MARRIAGE--SHERIFFDOM--LEAVES THE BAR.

Reverting to Sir Walter's domestic life, we should mention that in 1797, he married Miss Carpenter,
a lady of Jersey, with an annuity of 400l.; soon after which he established himself during
the vacations, in a delightful retreat at Lasswade, on the banks of the Esse, about five miles
to the south of Edinburgh. In 1799, he obtained the Crown appointment of sheriff of Selkirkshire,
with a salary of 300l. a year; the duties of which office he is said to have performed with
kindness and justice. Mr. Cunningham relates that Sir Walter had a high notion of the dignity
which belonged to his post, and sternly maintained it when any one seemed disposed to treat
it with unbecoming familiarity. On one occasion, it is said, when some foreign prince passed
through Selkirk, the populace, anxious to look on a live prince, crowded round him so closely,
that Scott, in vain attempted to approach him; the poet's patience failed, and exclaiming "Room
for your sheriff! Room for your sheriff!" he pushed and elbowed the gapers impatiently aside,
and apologised to the prince for their curiosity.[7]

    [7] Memoir in the Athenaeum.

By the death of Sir Walter's father, his income was increased, and this addition, with the
salary of his sheriffdom, left him more at leisure to indulge his literary pursuits. Soon after
this period, about 1803, Sir Walter finding that his attempts in literature had been unfavourable
to his success at the bar, says:--"My profession and I, therefore, came to stand nearly upon
the footing on which honest Slender consoled himself with having established with Mrs. Anne
Page. 'There was no great love between us at the beginning, and it pleased Heaven to decrease
it on farther acquaintance!' I became sensible that the time was come when I must either buckle
myself resolutely to 'the toil by day, the lamp by night,' renouncing all the Dalilahs of my
imagination, or bid adieu to the profession of the law, and hold another course.

"I confess my own inclination revolted from the more severe choice, which might have been deemed
by many the wiser alternative. As my transgressions had been numerous, my repentance must have
been signalized by unusual sacrifices. I ought to have mentioned that, since my fourteenth
or fifteenth year, my health, originally delicate, had been extremely robust. From infancy
I had laboured under the infirmity of a severe lameness, but, as I believe is usually the case
with men of spirit who suffer under personal inconveniences of this nature, I had, since the
improvement of my health, in defiance of this incapacitating circumstance, distinguished myself
by the endurance of toil on foot or horseback, having often walked thirty miles a-day, and
rode upwards of a hundred without stopping. In this manner I made many pleasant journeys through
parts of the country then not very accessible, gaining more amusement and instruction than
I have been able to acquire since I have travelled in a more commodious manner. I practised
most sylvan sports also with some success and with great delight. But these pleasures must
have been all resigned, or used with great moderation, had I determined to regain my station
at the bar." After well weighing these matters, Sir Walter resolved on quitting his avocations
in the law for literature; though he determined that literature should be his staff but not
his crutch, and that the profits of his labour, however convenient otherwise, should not become
necessary to his ordinary expenses.

THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL.

Sir Walter's secession from the law was followed by the production of his noblest poem--the
Lay of the Last Minstrel--the origin of which is thus related by the author:

"The lovely young Countess of Dalkeith, afterwards Harriet, Duchess of Buccleuch, had come
to the land of her husband, with the desire of making herself acquainted with its traditions
and customs. Of course, where all made it a pride and pleasure to gratify her wishes, she soon
heard enough of Border lore; among others, an aged gentleman of property, near Langholm, communicated
to her ladyship the story of Gilpin Horner--a tradition in which the narrator and many more
of that county were firm believers. The young Countess, much delighted with the legend, and
the gravity and full confidence with which it was told, enjoined it on me as a task to compose
a ballad on the subject. Of course, to hear was to obey; and thus the goblin story, objected
to by several critics as an excrescence upon the poem, was, in fact, the occasion of its being
written."

Sir Walter having composed the first two or three stanzas of the poem--taking for his model
the Christabel of Coleridge--showed them to two friends, "whose talents might have raised them
to the highest station in literature, had they not preferred exerting them in their own profession
of the law, in which they attained equal preferment." They were more silent upon the merits
of the stanzas than was encouraging to the author; and Sir Walter, looking upon the attempt
as a failure, threw the manuscript into the fire, and thought as little as he could of the
matter. Sometime afterwards, Sir Walter meeting his two friends, was asked how he proceeded
in his romance;--they were surprised at its fate, said they had reviewed their opinion, and
earnestly desired that Sir Walter would proceed with the composition. He did so; and the poem
was soon finished, proceeding at the rate of about a canto per week. It was finally published
in 1805, and produced to the author 600l.; and, to use his own words, "it may be regarded as
the first work in which the writer, who has been since so voluminous, laid his claim to be
considered as an original author." We thus see that Sir Walter Scott was in his 34th year before
he had published an original work.

MARMION.

Sir Walter's second poem of consequence appeared in 1808, he having published a few ballads
and lyrical pieces during the year 1806. The publishers, emboldened by the success of the Lay
of the Last Minstrel, gave the author 1,000l. for Marmion. Its success was electric, and at
once wrought up the poet's reputation. In his preface to the last edition, April, 1830, he
states 36,000 copies to have been printed between 1808 and 1825, besides a considerable sale
since that period; and the publishers were so delighted with the success, as "to supply the
author's cellars with what is always an acceptable present to a young Scotch house-keeper--namely,
a hogshead of excellent claret."

CLERK OF SESSION.

Between the appearance of the Lay of the Last Minstrel and Marmion, hopes were held out to
him from an influential quarter of the reversion of the office of a Principal Clerk in the
Court of Session; and, Mr. Pitt, having expressed a wish to be of service to the author, of
the Lay of the Last Minstrel, Sir Walter applied for the reversion. His desire was readily
acceeded to; and, according to Chambers, George III. is reported to have said, when he signed
the commission, that "he was happy he had it in his power to reward a man of genius, and a
person of such distinguished merit." The King had signed the document, and the office fees
alone remained to be paid, when Mr. Pitt died, and a new and opposite ministry succeeded. Sir
Walter, however, obtained the appointment, though not from the favour of an administration
differing from himself in politics, as has been supposed; the grant having been obtained before
Mr. Fox's direction that the appointment should be conferred as a favour coming directly from
his administration. The duties were easy, and the profits about 1,200l. a year, though Sir
Walter, according to arrangement, performed the former for five or six years without salary,
until the retirement of his colleague.

EDITIONS OF DRYDEN AND SWIFT.

Sir Walter's next literary labour was the editorship of the Works of John Dryden, with Notes.
Critical and Explanatory, and a Life of the Author: the chief aim of which appears to be the
arrangement of the "literary productions in their succession, as actuated by, and operating
upon, the taste of an age, where they had so predominating an influence," and the connexion
of the Life of Dryden with the history of his publications. This he accomplished within a twelvemonth.
Sir Walter subsequently edited, upon a similar plan, an edition of the Works of Swift.--Neither
of these works can be said to entitle Sir Walter to high rank as a biographer.

THE LADY OF THE LAKE

Was written in 1809, and published in 1810, and was considered by the author as the best of
his poetic compositions. He appears to have taken more than ordinary pains in its accuracy,
especially in verifying the correctness of the local circumstances of the story. In his introduction
to a late edition of the poem, he says--"I recollect, in particular, that to ascertain whether
I was telling a probable tale, I went into Perthshire, to see whether King James could actually
have ridden from the banks of Loch Venachar to Stirling Castle within the time supposed in
the poem, and had the pleasure to satisfy myself that it was quite practicable." The success
of the poem "was certainly so extraordinary, as to induce him for the moment to conclude, that
he had at last fixed a nail in the proverbially inconstant wheel of Fortune, whose stability
in behalf of an individual, who had so boldly courted her favours for three successive times,
had not as yet been shaken."

ABBOTSFORD.--(See the Cuts.)

Since Sir Walter's appointment to the sheriffdom of Selkirkshire, he had resided at Ashiesteel,
on the banks of the Tweed, of which he was but the tenant. He was now desirous to purchase
a small estate, and thereon build a house according to his own taste. He found a desirable
site six or seven miles farther down the Tweed, in the neighbourhood of the public road between
Melrose and Selkirk, and at nearly an equal distance from both of those towns: it was then
occupied by a little farm onstead, which bore the name of Cartley Hole. The mansion is in what
is termed the castellated Gothic style, embosomed in flourishing wood. It takes its name from
a ford, formerly used by the monks of Melrose, across the Tweed, which now winds amongst a
rich succession of woods and lawns. But we will borrow Mr. Allan Cunningham's description of
the estate, written during a visit to Abbotsford, in the summer of 1831:--"On the other side
of the Tweed we had a fine view of Abbotsford, and all its policies and grounds. The whole
is at once extensive and beautiful. The fast rising woods are already beginning to bury the
house, which is none of the smallest; and the Tweed, which runs within gun-shot of the windows,
can only be discerned here and there through the tapestry of boughs. A fine, open-work, Gothic
screen half conceals and half shows the garden, as you stand in front of the house--(see the
Engraving.) It was the offspring of necessity, for it became desirable to mask an unseemly
old wall, on which are many goodly fruit-trees. What we most admired about the estate, was
the naturally useful and elegant manner in which the great poet has laid out the plantations--first,
with respect to the bounding or enclosing line; and secondly, with regard to the skilful distribution
of the trees, both for the contrast of light and shade, and for the protection which the strong
affords to the weak.[8] The horizontal profile of the house is fine, crowded with towers and
clustered chimneys: it looks half castle, half monastery. The workmanship, too, is excellent:
indeed we never saw such well-dressed, cleanly, and compactly laid whinstone course and gage
in our life: it is a perfect picture."[9] "The external walls of Abbotsford, as also the walls
of the adjoining garden, are enriched with many old carved stones, which, having originally
figured in other situations, to which they were calculated by their sculptures and inscriptions,
have a very curious effect. Among the various relics which Sir Walter has contrived to collect,
may be mentioned the door of the old Tolbooth of Edinburgh, which, together with the hewn stones
that composed the gateway, are now made to figure in a base court at the west end of the house."[10]

    [8] Sir Walter possessed a practical as well as theoretical
        knowledge of Landscape Gardening, as may be seen in a
        valuable paper contributed by him to No. 47, of the
        Quarterly Review. The details of this paper were,
        however, disputed by some writers on the subject.

    [9] Communicated to No. 199, of The Athenaeum. The mansion
        was built from designs by Atkinson. Sir Walter may,
        however, be termed the amateur architect of the pile, and
        this may somewhat explain its irregularities. We have been
        told that the earliest design of Abbotsford was furnished
        by the late Mr. Terry, the comedian, who was an intimate
        friend of Sir Walter, and originally an architect by
        profession. His widow, one of the Nasmyths, has painted a
        clever View of Abbotsford, from the opposite bank of the
        Tweed; which is engraved in No. 427, of The Mirror.

    [10] Picture of Scotland, by Chambers.

It would occupy a whole sheet to describe the interior of the mansion; so that we select only
two apartments, as graphic memorials of the lamented owner. First, is the Armoury, (from a
coloured lithograph, published by Ackermann)--an arched apartment, with a richly-blazoned window,
and the walls filled all over with smaller pieces of armour and weapons, such as swords, firelocks,
spears, arrows, darts, daggers, &c. These relics will be found enumerated in a description
of Abbotsford, in the Anniversary, quoted in vol. xv. of the Mirror. The second of the interiors
is the poet's Study--a room about twenty-five feet square by twenty feet high, containing of
what is properly called furniture, nothing but a small writing-table and an antique arm-chair.
On either side of the fire-place various pieces of armour are hung on the wall; but, there
are no books, save the contents of a light gallery, which runs round three sides of the room,
and is reached by a hanging stair of carved oak in one corner. There are only two portraits--an
original of the beautiful and melancholy head of Claverhouse, and a small full-length of Rob
Roy. Various little antique cabinets stand about the room; and in one corner is a collection
of really useful weapons--those of the forest craft, to wit--axes and bills, &c. Over the fire-place,
too, are some Highland claymores clustered round a target. There is only one window, pierced
in a very thick wall, so that the place is rather sombre.

ROKEBY, AND MINOR POEMS.

After the publication of the Lady of the Lake, Sir Walter's poetical reputation began to wane.
In 1811, appeared Don Roderick; and in 1813, Rokeby; both of which were unsuccessful; and the
Lord of the Isles followed with no better fortune. In short, Sir Walter perceived that the
tide of popularity was turning, and he wisely changed with the public taste. The subjects of
these poems were neither so striking, nor the versification so attractive, as in his earlier
poems. The poet himself attributes their failure to the manner or style losing its charms of
novelty, and the harmony becoming tiresome and ordinary; his measure and manner were imitated
by other writers, and, above all Byron had just appeared as a serious candidate in the first
canto of Childe Harold; so that Sir Walter with exemplary candour confesses that "the original
inventor and his invention must have fallen into contempt, if he had not found out another
road to public favour." We shall therefore now part with his poetic fame, and proceed in the
more gratifying task of glancing at his splendid successes in prose fiction.

WAVERLEY.

The first of the author's

    long trails of light descending down,

had its origin in a desire to story the ancient traditions and noble spirit of the Highlands,
aided by the author's early recollections of their scenery and customs; in short, to effect
in prose what he had so triumphantly achieved in the poem of the Lady of the Lake.

The success of Miss Edgeworth's delineations of Irish life, and the author's completion of
Mr. Strutt's romance of Queen Hoo Hall, in 1808, again drew his attention to Waverley. Accident
threw the lost sheets in his way, while searching an old writing-desk for some fishing-tackle
for a friend. Waverley was published in 1814: its progress was for some time slow, but, after
two or three months its popularity began to spread, and, in a short time about 12,000 copies
were disposed of. The name of the author was kept secret from his desire to publish the work
"as an experiment on the public taste.

The success of Waverley led to the production of that series of works, by which the author
established himself "as the greatest master in a department of literature, to which he has
given a lustre previously unknown;--in which he stands confessedly unrivalled, and not approached,
even within moderate limits, except, among predecessors, by Cervantes, and among contemporaries,
by the author of Anastasius." We shall merely enumerate these works, with the date of their
publication, and, as a point of kindred interest, the sums for which the original manuscripts,
in the hand-writing of Sir Walter, were sold in the autumn of last year. Of the merits of these
productions it would be idle to attempt to speak in our narrow space; but, for a finely graphic
paper, (probably the last written previously to the author's death,) on the literary claims
of Sir Walter Scott, as a novelist, we may refer the reader to No. 109 of the Edinburgh Review.

MISCELLANEOUS WORKS.

To particularize Sir Walter's contributions to periodical literature would occupy considerable
space. He wrote a few papers in the early numbers of the Edinburgh Review, and several in the
Quarterly Review, especially during the last ten volumes of that journal, of which his son-in-law,
Mr. Lockhart, is the accredited editor. Sir Walter likewise contributed the articles Chivalry,
Drama, and Romance to the sixth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Paul's Letters to
his Kinsfolk, the fruits of Sir Walter's tour through France and Belgium, in 1815, were published
anonymously; and the Field of Waterloo, a poem, appeared about the same time. We may also here
mention his dramatic poem of Halidon Hill, which appeared in 1822; and two dramas, the Doom
of Devergoil and Auchindrane, in 1830--neither of which works excited more than temporary attention.
Sir Walter likewise contributed a History of Scotland, in two volumes, to Dr. Lardner's Cabinet
Cyclopaedia, in 1830; and in the same year a volume on Demonology and Witchcraft, to Mr. Murray's
Family Library: both which works, of course, had a circulation co-extensively with the series
of which they form portions. We may here notice a juvenile History of Scotland, in three series,
or nine volumes, under the title of Tales of a Grandfather, affectionately addressed to his
grandchild, the eldest son of Mr. Lockhart, as Hugh Littlejohn, Esq.

ABBOTSFORD--BARONETCY. He unostentatiously opened his treasury of relics to all visitors, and
his affability spread far and wide. He usually devoted three hours in the morning, from six
or seven o'clock, to composition, his customary quota being a sheet daily.

    [13] Evelyn's Diary.

In 1820, the poet of Marmion was created a baronet, by George IV., but a few weeks after his
accession--it being the first baronetcy conferred by the King, and standing alone in the Gazette
which announced the honour. In 1822, Sir Walter distinguished himself in the loyal reception
of the King, on his visit to Scotland; and soon afterwards the Baronet was appointed a deputy-lieutenant
for the county of Roxburgh.

EMBARRASSMENTS.

Thus stood the "pure contents" of Abbotsford, when, in January, 1826, the failure of Messrs.
Constable threw a gloom over Sir Walter's affairs. The eminent publisher had been one of his
earliest friends. "Archie Constable," he once said, "was a good friend to me long ago, and
I will never see him at a loss." The sums given by Mr. Constable for the copyright of Sir Walter's
novels were nominally immense; but they were chiefly paid in bills, which were renewed as the
necessities of the publisher increased, till, on his failure, Sir Walter found himself responsible
for various debts, amounting to 102,000l. About this time Lady Scott died, and her loss was
an additional affliction to him. Various modes of settlement were proposed to Sir Walter for
the liquidation of these heavy debts; but, "like the elder Osbaldistone of his own immortal
pages, considering commercial honour as dear as any other honour," he would only consent to
payment in full; and, in the short space of six years, he paid off 60,000l. "by his genius
alone; but he crushed his spirit in the gigantic struggle, or, in plain words, sacrificed himself
in the attempt to repair his broken fortunes." He sold his house and furniture in Edinburgh,
and, says Chambers, "retreated into a humble lodging in a second-rate street (St. David-street,
where David Hume had formerly lived.)" He reduced his establishment at Abbotsford, and retired,
as far as his official duties would permit, from public life, accompanied only by his younger
daughter. In this domestic retreat, at fifty-five years of age, he commenced

THE LIFE OF NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE

--visiting France, in 1826, for some information requisite to the work. In the following summer
the Life appeared in nine volumes, an extent much beyond the original project. As might be
expected, from the aristocratical turn of Sir Walter's political tenets, the opinions on this
work were more various than on any other of his productions: it is, to say the best, the most
faulty and unequal of them all; and, considering how clearly this has been shown, it is somewhat
surprising to hear so clever a critic as Mr. Cunningham pronounce The Life of Napoleon as "one
of the noblest monuments of Scott's genius." We pass from these considerations to the excellence
of the purpose to which the proceeds (12,000l.) of this work were applied--namely, to the payment
of 6s. 8d. in the pound, as the first dividend of the debts of the author.

In parting with the Napoleon, we might notice the conflicting opinions of the French critics
on its merits; but, as that task would occupy too much space we content ourselves with the
following passage from a journal published a few days subsequent to the melancholy intelligence
of the death of Sir Walter Scott being received in Paris. The criticism is in every sense plain-spoken:--

"If Sir Walter Scott's politics did not square with the natural state of things--if upon this
subject he still remained the victim of early prejudices, and, perhaps, of the predilections
of a poetical mind, yet he was fortunate enough to promote, by his writings, the real improvement
of the people. France has reason to reproach him severely for the unaccountable statements
in his "Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk," and in the "History of Bonaparte." But those errors
were imputable to carelessness much more than to malice. A prose writer, a poet, a novelist--he
yielded, during his long and laborious career, to the impulse of a fancy, rich, copious, and
entirely independent of present circumstances, aloof from the agitations of the day, delighting
in the memory of the past, and drawing from the surviving relics of ancient times the traditionary
tale, to revive and embellish it. He was one of those geniuses in romance who may be said to
have been impartial and disinterested, for he gave a picture of ordinary life exactly as it
was. He painted man in all the varieties produced in his nature by passion and the force of
circumstances, and avoided mixing up with these portraits what was merely ideal. Persons gifted
with this power of forgetting themselves, as it were, and of assuming in succession an infinite
series of varied characters, who live, speak, and act before us in a thousand ways that affect
or delight us, such men are often susceptible of feelings the most ardent on their own account,
although they may not directly express as much. It is difficult to believe that Shakspeare
and Moliere, the noblest types of this class of exalted minds, did not contemplate life with
feelings of deep and, perhaps, melancholy emotion. It was not so, however, with Scott, who
certainly belonged not to their kindred, possessing neither the vigour of combination, nor
the style which distinguished those men. Of great natural benevolence, gentle and kind, ardent
in the pursuit of various knowledge, accommodating himself to the manners and sentiments of
his day, good-humoured, and favoured by happy conjunctures of circumstances, Scott came forth
under the most brilliant auspices, accomplishing his best and most durable works almost without
an effort, and without impressing on these productions any sort of character which would connect
them with the personal character of the author. If he be represented, indeed, in any part of
his writings, it is in such characters as that of Morton (one of the Puritans), a sort of ambiguous,
undetermined, unoffending, good sort of person."

"WAVERLEY NOVELS."

Up to this period, the secret of the authorship of the novels was not generally known, though
more extensively so than was at the time imagined. The public had made up their minds to the
fact; but the identity was not proven. The adjustment of Messrs. Constable's affairs, however,
rendered it impossible longer to conceal the authorship, which was revealed by Sir Walter,
at the anniversary dinner of the Edinburgh Theatrical Fund, in February, 1827. Thus he acknowledged
before three hundred gentlemen "a secret which, considering that it was communicated to more
than twenty people, had been remarkably well kept." His avowal was as follows:--

"He had now to say, however, that the merits of these works, if they had any, and their faults,
were entirely imputable to himself." The wand was now broken, and the rod buried. His audience
would allow him further to say, with Prospero, 'Your breath has filled my sails.'"

The copyright of the novels was soon afterwards sold for 8,400l., and they have since been
republished, with illustrations, and notes and introductions by the author, in forty-one volumes,
monthly; the last volume appearing within a few days of the author's death.

FATAL ILLNESS.

Towards the close of 1830, Sir Walter retired from his office, retaining a portion of his salary,
but declining a pension which had been offered to him by the present administration. He was
now in his 60th year; his health broke apace; it was evident that the task of writing to pay
off debts, which were not of his own contracting, was alike too severe for his mental and physical
powers; and in the succeeding winter they became gradually paralyzed. He somewhat rallied in
the spring, and, unfortunately for his health, embroiled himself in the angry politics of the
day, at a county meeting at Jedburgh, upon the Reform question. He was then very feeble, but
spoke with such vehemence as to draw upon him the hisses of some of his auditors: this ebullition
of feeling is said to have much affected him; and he is stated (we know not how truly) to have
been observed on his way home in tears.

In the autumn of last year Sir Walter, at the recommendation of his physicians, resolved to
winter in the more congenial climate of Italy; though it required the most earnest entreaties
of his friends to induce him to consent to the change, so strong was his love of country and
apprehension of dying in a foreign land.

Sir Walter resided at Malta for a short time; thence he proceeded to Naples, where he was received
with almost pageant honours. In the spring he visited Rome; but "the world's chief ornament"
had few charms for one bereft of all hope of healthful recovery. His strength was waning fast,
and he set out to return with more than prudent speed to his native country. He travelled seventeen
hours for six successive days, and, in descending the Rhine, had a second attack of paralysis
which would have carried him off but for the timely presence of mind of his servant, who immediately
bled him. The illustrious Goëthe had looked forward with great pleasure to the meeting with
Sir Walter when he returned through Germany, but the destroyer had fell also on him. On his
arrival in London, Sir Walter was conveyed to the St. James's Hotel, Jermyn-street, and attended
by Sir Henry Halford and Dr. Holland, with Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart. He lay some weeks in a hopeless
condition, and when the flame of life was just flickering out, he entreated to be conveyed
to his own home. The journey was a hazardous one, but, as the dying wish of the poet, was tried
and effected: on July 9th, he was conveyed to Edinburgh, whence he was removed to his fondly-cherished
home on the 11th.

DEATH.

Sir Walter's return to Abbotsford was an afflicting scene. On approaching the mansion he could
scarcely be kept from attempting to raise himself in his carriage, such was his eagerness to
catch a glimpse of his home: he murmured, on his arrival, "that now he knew he was at Abbotsford."
He lingered for two months, during which he recognised and spoke kindly to friends, and was
even pleased in listening to passages read from the poems of Crabbe and Wordsworth: till, on
September 21st, 1832, he died, apparently free from pain, and surrounded by his family.

FUNERAL.

His remains were placed in a coffin of lead, enclosed in another coffin covered with black
cloth, and gilt ornaments. The inscription plate bore the words, "SIR WALTER SCOTT, of ABBOTSFORD,
Bart. AN. AETAT. 62." The funeral took place at Dryburgh, amidst the ruins of the venerable
abbey, at night-fall, on Sept. 25th; the body being borne from the hearse to the grave by his
domestics, and followed by upwards of 300 mourners. A Correspondent has furnished us with the
subjoined note of the funeral.

It has been remarked that at the grave, the burial service of the Episcopal Church was read
by a clergyman of the Church of England (the Rev. John Williams, of Baliol College, Oxford,
Rector of the Edinburgh Academy, and Vicar of Lampeter), although Sir Walter through life adhered
to the persuasion of the Presbyterian or Church of Scotland. In Scotland no prayers are offered
over the dead; when the mourners assemble in the house of the deceased, refreshments are handed
round, previous to which a blessing is implored, (as at meals,) and then only the minister
alludes to the bereavement the family have suffered, and strength and grace are implored to
sustain them under it. This gratuitous custom was adhered to, and previous to the funeral cortège
setting out from Abbotsford, the Rev. Principal Baird, offered up a prayer. And he seizes the
opportunity to applaud the liberal judgment of the present Scottish clergymen who avail themselves
of the advantage of offering a prayer, suitable to make an impression on the living.

The scenery around his burial-place is fraught with melancholy associations--enshrined as have
been its beauties by him that now sought a bourn amidst them.

Eildon Hill, where Sir Walter said he could stand and point out forty-three places famous in
war and verse;[14] and above all, the tower of Smailholm Castle, where once "his careless childhood
strayed,"--the Alpha of his poetic fame.

    [14] Cunningham.

FAMILY.

Sir Walter Scott had two sons and two daughters. The elder daughter, Sophia Charlotte, was
married, April 28, 1820, to Mr. John Gibson Lockhart, advocate, editor of the Quarterly Review.
The eldest son, Walter, who has succeeded to the baronetcy, is now in his thirty-second year,
and Major of the 15th or King's Hussars. In 1825, he married Jane, daughter and sole heiress
of John Jobson, Esq., an opulent Scottish merchant, with which lady, report affirmed at the
time, Major Scott received a fortune of 60,000l. The estate of Abbotsford was also settled
by Sir Walter upon the young pair; but, as the owner is stated not to have been at this time
in a state of solvency, though he thought himself so, and his estate now proves to be encumbered
with heavy debts, the deed of entail, of course, becomes invalid, and the paternal property
must be sold by the creditors of the estate. There is, however, ample reason to hope that such
a step will be averted, by the gratitude of the public, and that Abbotsford will be preserved
for the family. The younger son, Charles, who is, we believe, a junior clerk in the Foreign
Office, is unmarried; as is the younger daughter, Anne. The death of Lady Scott occurred May
15, 1826. Mrs. Lockhart's children are as yet the only descendants of Sir Walter in the second
generation.

PORTRAITS.

The reader may be somewhat familiar with the personal appearance of Sir Walter Scott, through
the several portraits which have from time to time been painted and engraved of the illustrious
Baronet. His height is stated at upwards of six feet; and his frame was strongly knit, and
compactly built. His right leg was shrunk from his boyhood, and required support by a staff.
Mr. Cunningham describes the personal habits of Sir Walter with his usual characteristic force:
"his arms were strong and sinewy; his looks stately and commanding; and his face, as he related
a heroic story, flushed up as a crystal cup when one fills it with wine. His eyes were deep
seated under his somewhat shaggy brow;[15] their colour was a bluish grey--they laughed more
than his lips did at a humorous story. His tower-like head and thin, white hair marked him
out among a thousand, while any one might swear to his voice again who heard it once, for it
had a touch of the lisp and the burr; yet, as the minstrel said, of Douglas, 'it became him
wonder well,' and gave great softness to a sorrowful story: indeed, I imagined that he kept
the burr part of the tone for matters of a facetious or humorous kind, and brought out the
lisp part in those of tenderness or woe. When I add, that in a meeting of a hundred men, his
hat was sure to be the least, and would fit no one's head but his own, I have said all that
I have to say about his appearance."[16]

    [15] Mr. Chambers describes Sir Walter's eyebrows as so shaggy
         and prominent, that, when he was reading or writing at a
         table, they completely shrouded the eyes beneath; and
         the Ettrick Shepherd speaks of Sir Walter's shaggy
         eyebrows dipping deep over his eyes.

    [16] One of the amusements of Sir Walter's retirement was to
         walk out frequently among his plantations at Abbotsford,
         with a small hatchet and hand-saw, with which he lopped
         off superfluous boughs, or removed an entire tree when it
         was marring the growth of others. The author of
         Anastasius delighted in a similar pursuit; he would
         stroll for hours through the winding walks of the
         Deepdene plantation, and with a small hatchet or shears
         lop off the luxuriant twigs or branches that might spoil
         the trim neatness of the path.

Among the accredited portraits of Sir Walter Scott is that painted by the late Sir Henry Raeburn,
which has been engraved in a handsome style; another portrait, by Mr. Leslie, was engraved
in the Souvenir, a year or two since, and was styled in the Noctes of Blackwood's Magazine,
"the vera man himsel;" but the latest, and perhaps the best, was painted not many month's since,
by Mr. Watson Gordon, and admirably engraved by Horsburgh, of Edinburgh, for the revised edition
of the Novels. A whole-length portrait of the Poet in his Study, at Abbotsford, was painted
a few years since, in masterly style, by Allan, and engraved by Goodall for the Anniversary,
edited by Mr. Cunningham, who informs us that "a painting is in progress from the same hand,
showing Sir Walter as he lately appeared--lying on a couch in his principal room: all the windows
are closed save one, admitting a strong central light, and showing all that the room contains--in
deep shadow, or in strong sunshine." A splendid portrait of the Poet was painted by Sir Thomas
Lawrence for the late King, and exhibited at the Royal Academy a few years since; an engraving
of which has been announced by Messrs. Moon, Boys, and Graves, his present Majesty having graciously
granted the loan of the picture for this purpose.[17]

    [17] A portrait of Sir Walter was painted by Knight for the
         late Mr. Terry, in the year 1825: it is described in the
         Literary Gazette as, "particularly excellent," and was
         unfortunately destroyed a short time since by a fire at
         the house of Mr. Harding, Finchley, in whose possession
         it was. This portrait, it is feared, has not been
         engraved.--See Literary Gazette, No. 819.

UNPUBLISHED WORKS.

Report states that there are in the library of Abbotsford, unfinished manuscripts and letters,
which will compose ten volumes of correspondence of Sir Walter with nearly all the distinguished
literary characters of his time. These will, of course, be given to his creditors, as directed
by his will. His son-in-law, Mr. Lockhart, has likewise a great number of letters from Sir
Walter; and Mrs. Terry possesses the baronet's correspondence with the late Mr. Terry, who
was one of Sir Walter's intimate friends. This lady has likewise in her possession a tragedy
written by Sir Walter for her eldest son, Walter Scott Terry, and intended by the author as
a legacy for Walter's first appearance on the stage.

With such materials, and the poet's autobiographical sketches prefixed to his works, a competent
biographer will, doubtless, be found among Sir Walter's personal acquaintance. Mr. Allan Cunningham's
"Account" is, perhaps, the most characteristic that has yet appeared: it is full of truth,
nature, kindly feeling, and tinged throughout with a delightfully poetic enthusiasm. Mr. Ballantyne,
the intelligent printer of nearly the whole of Sir Walter's works, and whom the Poet much respected
for his taste and good sense, has promised a memoir of the deceased. Public expectation, however,
points more decidedly to Mr. Lockhart; although the Ettrick Shepherd will, doubtless, pay his
announced tribute to the talents and virtues of his illustrious contemporary. In his Reminiscences
of Former Days, prefixed to the first volume of the Altrive Tales, published a few months since,
is the following striking passage:--"There are not above five people in the world who, I think,
know Sir Walter better, or understand his character better than I do; and if I outlive him,
which is likely, as I am five months and ten days younger, I shall draw a mental portrait of
him, the likeness of which to the original shall not be disputed."[18]

    [18] Hogg is indebted to Sir Walter for many valuable
         suggestions of subjects for his ballads, &c. There is
         touching gratitude in the following lines by the
         Shepherd, in his dedication of the Mountain Bard to
         Scott:

            Bless'd be his generous heart for aye;
            He told me where the relic lay;
            Pointed my way with ready will,
            Afar on Ettrick's wildest hill;
            Watch'd my first notes with curious eye,
            And wonder'd at my minstrelsy:
            He little ween'd a parent's tongue
            Such strains had o'er my cradle sung.

MEDAL.

A handsome Medal, in bronze, of the lamented Baronet, has been published from the establishment
of Mr. Parker, (medallist, and the originator of some ingenious improvements in the construction
of lamps), in Argyle-place. The obverse is from Chantrey's celebrated Bust of Sir Walter, and
the reverse a graceful female figure, with the inscription, "to great men;"--designed by R.
Stothard, Esq., the venerable Academician, and engraved by his son, A.J. Stothard, Esq. The
profile of the obverse is encircled with a motto chosen by Sir Walter, as will be seen by the
following letter; the date of which shows that the medal was submitted to his approbation some
months since, together with a medal of his present Majesty. The letter is likewise treasurable,[19]
as well for the writer's opinion of the Monarch, as of the productions of his own pen:--

    [19] First printed in the Literary Gazette, No. 819.

"Sir,--I would long ere now have answered your very obliging letter with the medals. That representing
our Sovereign seems most beautifully executed, and is a striking resemblance. I have very little
turn for imagining mottos, it being long since I read the classics, which are the great storehouse
of such things. I think that a figure or head of Neptune upon the reverse, with the motto round
the exergue, Tridens Neptuni sceptrum mundi. I think this better than any motto more personally
addressed to the King himself than to his high kingly office. I cannot, of course, be a judge
of the other medal; but such of my family as are with me think it very like.

"I beg you will excuse the delay which has taken place. Your obliging communication, with the
packet which accompanied it, travelled from country to town, and from town to country, as it
chanced to miss me upon the road.

The likeness of the medal is strikingly correct; and Mr. Parker, with becoming taste, causes
an autograph copy of the letter to be delivered with each medal.

The deference of the latter opinion conveyed in this letter is perhaps one of the most delightful
characteristics of the genius of Sir Walter Scott,--especially if we admit the position of
the writer in the Edinburgh Review, that no writer has ever enjoyed in his life-time so extensive
a popularity as the Author of Waverley. His love of fame and acquisition of honourable distinction
all over the world had not the common effect of making him vain. Hear, in proof, the following
unassuming declaration, from the delightful autobiographic sketch to a late edition of Rokeby:--

"I shall not, I believe, be accused of ever having attempted to usurp a superiority over many
men of genius, my contemporaries; but, in point of popularity, not of actual talent, the caprice
of the public has certainly given me such a temporary superiority over men, of whom, in regard
to poetical fancy and feeling, I scarcely thought myself worthy to loose the shoe-latch. On
the other hand, it would be absurd affectation in me to deny, that I conceived myself to understand
more perfectly than many of my contemporaries, the manner most likely to interest the great
mass of mankind. Yet, even with this belief, I must truly and fairly say, that I always considered
myself rather as one who held the bets, in time to be paid over to the winner, than as having
any pretence to keep them in my own right."

Mr. Cunningham well observes--"Though the most accomplished author of his day, yet he had none
of the airs of authorship." He continues--"He was a proud man; not a proud poet, or historian,
or novelist." His was the pride of ancestry--a weakness, to be sure, but of a venial nature:
"he loved to be looked on as a gentleman of old family, who built Abbotsford, and laid out
its garden, and planted its avenues, rather than a genius, whose works influenced mankind,
and diffused happiness among millions." His own narrative will best illustrate his labours
of leisure at Abbotsford. He writes of that period which men familiarly call the turn of life:--"With
the satisfaction of having attained the fulfilment of an early and long-cherished hope, I commenced
my improvements, as delightful in their progress as those of the child who first makes a dress
for a new doll. The nakedness of the land was in time hidden by woodlands of considerable extent--the
smallest possible of cottages was progressively expanded into a sort of dream of a mansion-house,
whimsical in the exterior, but convenient within. Nor did I forget what was the natural pleasure
of every man who has been a reader--I mean the filling the shelves of a tolerably large library.
All these objects I kept in view, to be executed as convenience should serve; and although
I knew many years should elapse before they could be attained, I was of a disposition to comfort
myself with the Spanish proverb, 'Time and I against any two.'"
