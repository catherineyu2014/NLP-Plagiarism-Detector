Section 14.--The average height of the wall was 10 ft., and the thickness at base was one-half
the height. The stone for the concrete was obtained from the spoil bank of the canal, loaded
into wheelbarrows and wheeled about 100 ft. to the crusher; some was hauled in wagons. An Austin
jaw crusher was used, and it discharged the stone into bins from which it was fed into a Sooysmith
mixer. The crusher and the mixer were mounted on a flat car. Bucket elevators were used to
raise the stone, sand and cement from their bins to the mixer; the buckets were made of such
size as to give the proper proportions of ingredients, as they all traveled at the same speed.
Only two laborers were required to look after the elevators. The sand and cement were hauled
by teams and dumped into the receiving bins. There were 23,568 cu. yds. on Section 14 and the
cost was as follows:

      Total for crushing, mixing and placing     $0.975

The daily costs charged to the mixers and crushers include the cost of coal, at $2 a ton, and
the cost of oil.

The gang "loading stone" apparently did a good deal of sledging of large stones, and they also
wheeled a large part of it in barrows to the crusher.

The plant cost $9,600, distributed as follows:

2 jaw crushers         $3,000
2 mixers                3,000
Track                   1,260
Lumber                    500

                        -----
Total                  $9,600

If this first cost of the plant were distributed over the 23,568 cu. yds. of concrete it would
amount to 41 cts. per cu. yd.

The cost of the concrete was as follows:

                                      Per cu. yd.

Utica cement, at $0.65 per bbl.          $0.863
Portland cement, at $2.25 per bbl.        0.305
Sand, at $1.35 per cu. yd.                0.465
Stone and labor, as above given           0.975
                                         ------
Total                                    $2.608
First cost of plant                      $0.407

Section 15.--The conditions on this section were much the same as on Section 14, just described,
except that the limestone was quarried from the bed of the canal, and was crushed in a stationary
crusher, No. 7 Gates. The stone was hauled 1,000 ft. to the crusher on cars drawn by a cable
from a hoisting engine. The output of this crusher averaged 210 cu. yds. per day of 10 hrs.
The crushed stone was hauled in dump cars, drawn by a locomotive, to the mixers. Spiral screw
mixers mounted on flat cars were used, and they delivered the concrete to belt conveyors which
delivered the concrete into the forms.

The forms on Section 15 (and on Section 14 as well) consisted of upright posts set 8 ft. apart
and 9 ins. in front of the wall, held at the toe by iron dowels driven into holes in the rock,
and held to the rear posts by tie rods. The plank sheeting was made up in panels 2 ft. wide
and 16 ft. long, and was held up temporarily by loose rings which passed around the posts which
were gripped by the friction of the rings. These panels were brought to proper line and held
in place by wooden wedges. After the concrete had set 24 hrs. the wedges were struck, the panels
removed and scraped clean ready to be used again.

It will be noted that 2 mixers were kept busy. Their average output was 100 cu. yds. each per
day, which is the same as for the mixers on Section 14.

The total cost of concrete on Section 15 was as follows:

                                           Per cu. yd.
Labor quarrying, crushing and mixing            $0.991
Explosives                                       0.083
Utica cement, at $0.60 per bbl.                  0.930
Portland cement, at $2.25 per bbl.               0.180
Sand, at $1.35 per cu. yd.                       0.476
                                                ------
Total                                           $2,660
First cost of plant                             $0.567

It is not strictly correct to charge the full first cost of the plant to the work as it possessed
considerable salvage value at the end.

Comparison.--For the purpose of comparing Sections 14 and 15 the following summary is given
of the cost per cubic yard of concrete:

                           Sec. 14.     Sec. 15.
General force              $0.078       $0.082

Total                      $3.015       $3.225

It should be remembered that on Section 14 there was no drilling and blasting of the rock,
but that the "quarry force" not only loaded but hauled the stone to the crusher. The cost of
mixing on Section 15 is higher than on Section 14 because the materials were dumped on platforms
and shoveled into the mixer, instead of being discharged from bins into the mixer as on Section 14.

~GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL, NEW YORK, N. Y.~--In building a retaining wall of the cross-section,
shown in Fig. 108, a traveling tower moving on tracks parallel to the wall contained the concrete
mixing plant. The construction of the tower is shown in Fig. 109. The tower had two platforms,
one at the top carrying two 10-cu. yd. bins for sand and stone and the other directly below
carrying 40 cu. ft. (4 cu. ft. cement, 12 cu. ft. sand and 24 cu. ft. stone) Ransome mixer
driven by a 30 H.P. motor and a Lidgerwood motor hoist. The elevator tower carried two 40-cu.
ft. Ransome dumping buckets traveling in guides and dumping automatically into the bins. These
buckets were operated by the Lidgerwood motor hoist on the mixer platform. Sand and broken
stone on flat cars were brought alongside the tower. The sand was shoveled direct from the
car into the sand bucket, but the broken stone was shoveled into wheelbarrows which were wheeled
over a light bridging from car to bucket and dumped. Wheelbarrows were used for handling the
stone chiefly because the capacity of the plant was so great that enough men could not be worked
in the limited space around the bucket to keep up the supply by shoveling. The wheelbarrow
work added materially to the cost. Cement was carried from the cars to the sand bucket, hoisted
and stored on the mixer platform which provided storage room for 100 bags. A 1-3-6 mixture
was used; the sand and stone were chuted directly from the bins to the charging hopper and
the cement was charged by hand. The mixed concrete was delivered to two 1 cu. yd. dump cars
running on a 2-ft. gage track laid in sections on the cross pieces connecting the uprights
of the forms. The track had no switches, so that one car had to wait for the other. Four men
were required to push each car and two more men assisted in dumping the car and kept the track
clear. The wall was built in sections 51 ft. long, each containing 250 cu. yds. One of these
sections was filled in 8 hours with ease and by a little hustling a section was filled in 6¾
hours, which is at the rate of 37 cu. yds. of concrete per hour. Working 8 hours per day the
cost of mixing, transporting and placing concrete with this mixing plant, with wages for common
labor of $1.50 per day, was as follows:

                                         Total.     Per cu. yd.
2 men carrying cement                  $  3.00        $0.012

           Grand total                 $104.00        $0.416

It will be noted that the cost of shoveling and wheeling the broken stone amounts to 16.4 cts.
per cu. yd., or nearly 40 per cent. of the total cost of mixing and placing. The cost of spading
the concrete is also high for a sloppy mixture, but is probably accounted for by the fact that
the concrete had to be spaded so as to have 2 or 3 ins. of clear mortar next the forms. The
forms used in constructing the wall are shown by Figs. 110 and 111. They were made in panels
51 ft. long and a locomotive crane was used to shift the panels. This crane worked handling
forms only a small part of the time, but a form gang of 10 carpenters was kept busy all of
the time moving and reassembling. Assuming the work of the crane to amount to $5 per day and
the wages of the carpenter gang to amount to $25, we get a cost of 12 cts. per cubic yard of
concrete for shifting forms. It should be noted carefully that the costs given for this work
do not include cost of materials, interest on plant, superintendence and other items.

~WALL FOR RAILWAY YARD.~--For building a retaining wall 7 ft. high, forms were made and placed
by a carpenter and helper at $8 per M., wages being 35 cts. and 20 cts. an hour, respectively.
Concrete materials were dumped from wagons alongside the mixing board. Ramming was unusually
thorough. Foreman expense was high, due to small number in gang; 2 cu. yds. were laid per hour
by the gang.

                                             Per day.     Per cu. yd.

Total labor                                   $17.00        $0.85

The total cost was as follows per cubic yard:

Total, per cubic yard                          $4.29

The sheathing plank for the forms was 2-in. hemlock.

~CONCRETE FOOTING FOR RUBBLE MASONRY RETAINING WALL.~--In constructing a footing for a retaining
wall at Grand Rapids, Mich., a 1-2½-5 natural cement concrete was used. It was found that 1
cu. yd. of concrete was equivalent to 29.8 cu. ft. of material composed of 3.6 cu. ft. or 1.1
bbls. of cement, 8.4 cu. ft. or 2.7 bbls. of sand and 17.8 cu. ft. or 5.5 bbl. of broken stone.
The labor cost of 15.5 cu. yds. of concrete was as follows:

Item.                                   Total.     Per cu. yd.
Foreman, 14 hours at 40 cts.           $ 5.60       $0.3613
Foreman, 20 hours at 22.5 cts.           4.50        0.2903
Laborers, 49 hours at 12.5 cts.          6.11        0.3942
Mason, 2 hours at 35 cts.                0.70        0.0451
                                       ------      --------
Total labor                            $16.91       $1.0909

All material was furnished by the railway company, the contractor furnishing labor only; his
contract price for this was $1 per cu. yd.

~TRACK ELEVATION, ALLEGHENY, PA.~--The wall was 6,100 ft. long and 75 per cent. was on curves.
The first wall built had a top width of 2½ ft. and a bottom width of 0.4 the height with the
back on a smooth batter. Later the back was stepped and last the wall was proportioned as follows:
Calling the height from top of foundation to under coping, then width of base was 0.45 (h +
3), the top measuring 2½ ft. The back was arranged in steps 24 ins., 30 ins. and 36 ins. high,
and the thickness of wall at each step was, calling h equal to height of step from base, 0.45
(h + 3). Several forms of expansion joints were tried. The first was tarred paper extending
through the wall every 50 ft.; the second was ½-in. boards running through the wall every 50
ft.; the third was ½-in. board extending 2 ft. into the wall, with a ¼-in. cove at the angles,
every 25 ft. The third construction gave perfect satisfaction.

A 1-2-5 natural cement and a 1-3-6 Portland cement concrete mixed fairly wet were used. The
concrete was laid in 8-in. courses and faced with a 1-2 mortar. The forms were 2-in. white
pine faced and jack planed on the edges; upon removal of the forms board marks and other defects
were removed and a wash of neat cement was applied. One contractor used hand mixing. The sand
and gravel were measured in wheelbarrows and wheeled onto the platform; the sand and cement
were spread in thin layers, one over the other, and thoroughly mixed dry; the gravel was then
spread over the mixture, the whole was shoveled into barrows or the pit again shoveled into
place and rammed. The other contractor used a cubical mixer. A charging box holding 1¼ cu.
yds. and graduated to show the correct proportions of sand and gravel was filled by shoveling;
cement was placed on top and the box hoisted and dumped into the mixer. A barrel holding the
correct amount of water was emptied into the mixer which was turned 10 or 15 times and discharged
into cars. The costs of mixing by hand and by machine were as follows:

Hand mixing.                               Total.      Per cu. yd.
½ foreman at $3                           $ 1.50        $0.025

CHAPTER XIV.

METHODS AND COST OF CONSTRUCTING CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS FOR PAVEMENTS.

Contractor's skill or want of skill in systematizing and managing labor counts as high in street
work as in any class of concrete construction. As previously demonstrated, the cost of mixing
is a very small portion of the labor cost of concrete in place; the costs of getting the materials
to the mixer and the mixed concrete to the work are the big items, and in street work the opportunity
for increasing the cost of these items through mismanagement is magnified by the large area
of operations involved per cubic yard of concrete placed. One cubic yard of concrete makes
6 sq. yds. of 6-in. pavement foundations and 100 cu. yds. of concrete make a 6-in. foundation
for 300 ft. of 30-ft. street, while 4 to 5 cu. yds. will build 100 ft. of ordinary curb and
gutter. Thus the haulage per cubic yard is considerable at best, and lack of plan in distributing
stock piles and handling the concrete can easily result in such increased haulage expenses
as to change a possible profit into a certain loss. A little thought and skill in planning
street work pays a good profit.

~MIXTURES EMPLOYED.~--A comparatively lean concrete will serve for pavement foundations; mixtures
of 1-4-8 Portland cement or 1-2-5 natural cement are amply good and it is folly, ordinarily,
to employ richer mixtures. Until recently, natural cement has been used almost exclusively;
a 1-2-5 natural cement mixture requires about 1.15 bbls. of cement per cubic yard of concrete.
A 1-4-8 Portland cement mixture requires about 0.7 bbl. of cement per cubic yard. In the opinion
of the authors a considerably leaner mixture of Portland concrete is sufficiently good when
it is well mixed in machine mixers--for a 6-in., foundation 0.5 bbl. per cu. yd. The mixtures
actually employed are proportioned about as stated and their cost, or that of any other common
mixture, may easily be computed from Tables XII and XIII, giving for different mixtures the
quantities of cement, sand and stone per cubic yard of concrete; the product of these quantities
and the local prices of materials in the stock piles gives the cost. When the concrete is mixed
by hand the ordinary labor cost of foundations is 0.4 to 0.5 of a 10-hour day's wages per cubic
yard of concrete; occasionally it may be as low as 0.3 of a day's wages where two mixing gangs
are worked side by side under different foremen and with an exacting contractor. Data for machine
mixing are too few to permit a similar general statement for machine work, but in one case
coming under the authors' observation, the cost figured out to a little less than 0.2 of a
day's wages per cubic yard.

~DISTRIBUTION OF STOCK PILES.~--Assuming a 30-ft. street and a 1-3-5 concrete laid 6 ins. thick,
the quantities of concrete materials required per lineal foot of street are: Cement 0.60 bbl.,
sand 0.27 cu. yd., stone 0.44 cu. yd. The stock piles should be so distributed that each supplies
enough materials for a section of foundation reaching half way to the next adjacent stock pile
on each side, and they should not contain more or less material, otherwise a surplus remains
to be cleaned up or a deficiency to be supplied by borrowing from another pile. A little care
will ensure the proper distribution and it is well paid for in money saved by not rehandling
surplus or borrowed materials. For a given mixture and a given width and thickness of foundation,
the sizes of the stock piles are determined by their distance apart and this will depend upon
whether hand or machine mixing is employed and upon the means adopted for hauling the raw materials
and the mixed concrete. It is worth while always in stock piles of any size, to lay a flooring
of plank particularly under the stone pile; if dumped directly on the ground it costs half
as much again to handle stone. Current practice warrants everything from a continuous bank,
to piles from 1,000 to 1,500 ft. apart, in the spacing of stock piles.

~HINTS ON HAND MIXING.~--All but a small percentage of the concrete annually laid in street
work is hand mixed. The authors are confident that this condition will disappear as contractors
learn more of the advantages of machine mixing, but it prevails at present. The general economics
of hand mixing are discussed in Chapter II; in street work as before stated, the big items
of labor cost are the costs of handling materials and the data in Chapter II on these processes
deserve special attention. It is particularly worth noting that it is seldom economical to
handle materials in shovels where carrying is necessary; it is a common thing in street work
to see an attempt to get the stock piles so close to the mixing board that the material can
be handled with shovels, and this is nearly always an economic error. Street work is readily
measured; in fact, its progress can be seen at a glance, and advantage can often be taken of
this fact to profit by the rivalry of separate gangs. The authors have known of the labor costs
being reduced as much as 25 per cent., due to pitting one gang against another where each could
see the progress made by the other.

~METHODS OF MACHINE MIXING.~--Concrete mixers have been slow to replace handwork in laying
pavement foundations. In explanation of this fact it is asserted: (1) That frequent shifting
of the mixer causes too much lost time, and (2) that the principal item of labor cost in street
work is the conveying of materials to and from the mixer, and this item is the same whether
hand or machine mixing be employed. The records of machine mixer work given elsewhere in this
chapter go far, in the opinion of the authors, toward disproving the accuracy of both assertions.
If the machine used and the methods of work employed are adapted to the conditions of street
work, machine mixing can be employed to decided advantage.

A continuous and large output is demanded in a mixer for street work; the perfection of the
mixing is within limits a minor consideration. This at once admits for consideration types
of mixers whose product is classed as unsuitable for reinforced concrete work, and also admits
of speeding up the output of the better types to a point beyond that at which they turn out
their most perfect product. Keeping these facts in mind either of the following two systems
of work may be employed: (1) Traction plants which travel with the work and deposit concrete
in place, or so nearly in place that little shoveling is necessary; (2) portable plants which
are set up at wide intervals along the work and which discharge the concrete into carts or
dump wagons which distribute it to the work.

The secret of economic work with plants of the class cited first is the distribution of the
stock piles so as practically to eliminate haulage from stock pile to mixer. The mixer backs
away from the work, its discharge end being toward the work and its charging end away from
it. Then deposit the materials so as to form a continuous stock pile along the center of the
street; the mixer moving backward from the completed foundation keeps close to the materials
and if the latter are uniformly distributed in the pile the great bulk of the charging is done
by shoveling direct into the charging bucket. The point to be watched here is that the shovelers
do not have to carry the materials; separate stock piles within moderate hauling distance by
wheelbarrows are a far more economic arrangement than a continuous pile so irregularly distributed
that much of the material has to be carried even a few paces in shovels.

Economic work with plants of the second class depends upon efficient and adequate means of
hauling the mixed concrete to the work. The plant should not be shifted oftener than once in
1,000 to 2,000 ft., or, say, four city blocks. This does away with the possibility of wheelbarrow
haulage; large capacity hand or horse carts must be employed. With 6 cu. ft. hand carts, such
as the Ransome cart, a haul of 500 ft. each way from the mixer is possible and with horse carts,
such as the Briggs, this economic distance is increased to 1,000 ft. each way from the mixer.
The mixer must be close to the stock pile and it will pay to make use of improved charging
devices. A 6-in. foundation for 2,000 ft. of 30-ft. street calls for 667 cu. yds. of concrete,
and if both sides are curbed at the same time, 100 cu. yds. more are added, or 767 cu. yds.
in all; where intersecting streets are to be paved in both directions from the mixer plant
these amounts are doubled. A very small saving per cubic yard due to mechanical handling of
the materials to the mixer amounts to the interest on a considerable investment in such plant.
A point that should not be forgotten is that carts such as those named above spread the concrete
in dumping so that little or no shoveling is required.

In laying 5,167 sq. yds. of granite block pavement on one job in New York City in 1905, the
authors' records show that one laborer mixed and laid 1.3 cu. yds. of concrete per day in a
6-in. foundation; this is a very small output. The work was done by contract and the labor
cost was as follows:

                                                       Per      Per

The average day's wages was $1.86, so that the labor cost was about 0.5 of a day's wages per
cubic yard of concrete.

~FOUNDATION FOR PAVEMENT, NEW ORLEANS. LA.~--Mr. Alfred E. Harley states that in laying concrete
foundations for street pavement in New Orleans, a day's work, in running three mixing boards,
covering the full width of the street, averaged 900 sq. yds., 6 ins. thick, or 150 cu. yds.,
with a gang of 40 men. With wages assumed to be 15 cts. per hour the labor cost was:

                                          Cts. per cu. yd.
6 men wheeling broken stone                       6
3 men wheeling sand                               3

Total labor cost                                 39 cts.

~FOUNDATIONS FOR STREET PAVEMENT, TORONTO, CANADA.~--The following cost of a concrete base
for pavements at Toronto has been abstracted from a report (1892) of the City Engineer, Mr.
Granville C. Cunningham. The concrete was 1-2½-7½ Portland; 2,430 cu. yds. were laid, the thickness
being 6 ins., at the following cost per cubic yard:

0.77 bbl. cement, at $2.78                     $2.14
0.76 cu. yd. stone, at $1.91                    1.45
0.27 cu. yd. sand and gravel, at $0.80          0.22
Labor (15 cts. per hr)                          1.03
                                               -----
Total                                          $4.84

Judging by the low percentage of stone in so lean a mixture as the above, the concrete was
not fully 6 ins. thick as assumed by Mr. Cunningham. Note that the labor cost was 1½ to 2 times
what it would have been under a good contractor.

~MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES OF PAVEMENT FOUNDATION WORK.~--The following records of pavement foundation
work are taken from the note and time books of one of the authors:

Case 1.--Laying 6-in. pavement foundation; stone delivered and dumped upon 2-in. plank laid
to receive it. Sand and stone were dumped along the street, so that the haul in wheelbarrows
to mixing board Was about 40 ft. Two gangs of men worked under separate foremen, and each gang
averaged 4.5 cu. yds. concrete per hour. The labor cost was as follows for 45 cu. yds. per gang:

                                                  Per day.      Per cu. yd.
4 men filling barrows with stone and sand
ready for the mixers, wages 15 cts.
per hour                                            $6.00         $0.13
10 men, wheeling, mixing and shoveling to
place (3 or 4 steps), wages 15 cts. per
hour                                                15.00          0.33

2 men ramming, wages 15 cts. per hour                3.00          0.07
1 foreman at 30 cts. per hour and 1 water
boy, 5 cts                                           3.50          0.08
                                                    -----         -----
Total                                               $27.50        $0.61

Case II.--Sometimes it is desirable to know every minute detail cost, for which purpose the
following is given:

                                                  ----Per cu. yd.----
                                                  Day's labor.  Cost.
3 men loading stones into barrows                     $0.06     $0.09
1 man loading sand into barrows                        0.02      0.03
2 men ramming                                          0.04      0.06
1 foreman and 1 water boy equivalent to                0.035     0.05
Wheeling sand and cement to mixing board               0.02      0.03
Wheeling stone to mixing board                        0.026      0.04
9 men mixing mortar                                   0.013      0.02
Mixing stone and mortar                               0.049      0.07
Placing concrete (walking 15 ft.)                     0.072      0.11
                                                     ------     -----
Total                                                $0.335     $0.50

In one respect this is not a perfectly fair example (although it represents ordinary practice),
for the mortar was only turned over once in mixing instead of three times, and the stone was
turned only twice instead of three or four times. Water was used in great abundance, and by
its puddling action probably secured a very fair mixture of cement and sand, and in that way
secured a better mixture than would be expected from the small amount of labor expended in
actual mixing. About 9 cts. more per cu. yd. spent in mixing would have secured a perfect concrete
without trusting to the water.

Case III.--Two gangs (34 men) working under separate foremen averaged 600 sq. yds., or 100
cu. yds. of concrete per 10-hour day for a season. This is equivalent to 3 cu. yds. per man
per day. The stone and sand were wheeled to the mixing board in barrows, mixed and shoveled
to place. Each gang was organized as follows:

                                 Per day.       Per cu. yd.
4 men loading barrows            $ 6.00          $0.12
9 men mixing and placing          13.50           0.27
2 men tamping                      3.00           0.06
1 foreman                          2.50           0.05
                                 ------          -----
Total                            $25.00          $0.50

These men worked with great rapidity. The above cost of 50 cts. per cu. yd. is about as low
as any contractor can reasonably expect to mix and place concrete by hand in pavement work.

Case IV.--Two gangs of men, 34 in all, working side by side on separate mixing boards, averaged
720 sq. yds., or 120 cu. yds., per 10-hour day. Each gang was organized as follows:

                                 Per day.       Per cu. yd.
6 men loading and wheeling        $ 9.00          $0.15
8 men mixing and placing           12.00           0.20
2 men tamping                       3.00           0.05
1 foreman                           3.00           0.05
                                  ------          -----
Total                             $27.00          $0.45

Instead of shoveling the concrete from the mixing board into place, the mixers loaded it into
barrows and wheeled it to place. The men worked with great rapidity.

Mr. Irving E. Howe gives the cost of a 6-in. foundation of 1-3-5 natural cement at Minneapolis,
Minn., in 1897, as $2.80 per cu. yd., or $0.467 per sq. yd. Cement cost 76 cts. per barrel
and stone and sand cost delivered $1.15 and 30 cts. respectively. Mixers received $1.75 per day.

Mr. Niles Meriwether gives the cost of materials and labor for an 8-in. foundation constructed
by day labor (probably colored) at Memphis, Tenn., in 1893, as follows:

                                        Per sq. yd.
Natural cement at $0.74 per bbl              $0.195
Sand at $1.25 per cu. yd                      0.075
Stone at $1.87 per cu. yd                     0.355
Labor mixing and placing                      0.155
                                              -----
Total                                        $0.780

Labor was paid $1.25 to $1.50 per 8-hour day and 1.16 bbls. of cement were used per cubic yard
of concrete. The cost of materials, as will be noted, was high and the labor seems to have
been inefficient.

~FOUNDATIONS FOR BRICK PAVEMENT, CHAMPAIGN, ILL.~--The concrete foundation for a brick pavement
constructed in 1903 was 6 ins. thick; the concrete used was composed of 1 part natural cement,
3 parts of sand and gravel, and 3 parts of broken stone. All the materials were mixed with
shovels, and were thrown into place from the board upon which the mixing was done. The material
was brought to the steel mixing board in wheelbarrows from piles where it had been placed in
the middle of the street, the length of haul being usually from 30 to 60 ft. The foundation
was 6 ins. thick and it cost as follows for materials and labor:

                                            Cost per
                                             cu. yd.
1.2 bbls. cement, at $0.50                    $0.600
0.6 cu. yd. sand and gravel, at $1             0.600
0.6 cu. yd. broken stone, at $1.40             0.840
6 men turning with shovels, at $2              0.080
4 men throwing into place, at $2               0.053
2 men handling cement, at $1.75                0.023
1 man wetting with hose, at $1.75              0.012
2 men tamping, at $1.75                        0.023
1 man leveling, at $1.75                       0.012
6 men wheeling stone, at $1.75                 0.070
4 men wheeling gravel, at $1.75                0.047
1 foreman, at $4                               0.027
                                              ------
                                              $2.387

This is practically 40 cts. per sq. yd., or $2.40 per cu. yd. of concrete for materials and
labor. It is evident from the above quantities that a cement barrel was assumed to hold about
4.5 cu. ft., hence the cement was measured loose in making the 1-3-3 concrete. The accuracy
of the quantities given is open to serious doubt. It will also be noted that the labor cost
of making and placing the concrete was only 35 cts. per cu. yd., wages being nearly $1.85 per
day. This is so remarkably low that some mistake would seem to have been made in the measurement
of the work. The authors do not hesitate to say that no gang of men ever made any considerable
amount of concrete by hand at the rate of 5.75 cu. yds. per man per day.

~FOUNDATION CONSTRUCTION USING CONTINUOUS MIXERS.~--The following are records of two jobs of
pavement foundation work using continuous mixers with one-horse concrete carts in one instance
and wheelbarrows in the other instance. The mixer used was the Foote mixer, as arranged for
the work being described it is shown by Fig. 112. One particular advantage of this and similar
mixers for street work is that no proportioning or measuring of the materials is required of
the men. The mixers are provided with an automatic measuring device, by means of which any
desired proportion of cement, sand and stone is delivered to the mixing trough. The mixer is
mounted on trucks, and the hoppers that receive the sand and stone are comparatively low down.
The sand can be wheeled in barrows up a run plank and dumped into a hopper on one side of the
mixer, and in like manner the gravel or broken stone can be delivered into a hopper on the
other side. The cement is delivered in bags or buckets to a man who dumps it into a cement
hopper directly over the mixer. All that the operator needs to attend to is to see that the
men keep the hoppers comparatively full. The records of work on the two jobs mentioned are
as follows:

Job I.--The sand was delivered from the stock pile by a team hitched to a drag scraper, and
was dumped alongside the mixer where two men shoveled it into the hopper. On the same job the
concrete was hauled away from the mixer in Briggs' concrete carts. With a gang of 30 men and
2 to 4 horses hauling concrete in Briggs' carts, the contractor averaged 1,200 sq. yds., or
200 cu. yds., per day of 10 hours. With wages of laborers at 15 cts. per hour, and a single
horse at the same rate, the cost of labor was 26 cts. per cu. yd., or less than 4½ cts. per
sq. yd. of concrete base 6 ins. thick. The coal was a nominal item, and did not add 1 ct. per
cu. yd. to the cost. In this case the mixer was set up on a side street and the concrete was
hauled in the carts for a distance of a block each way from the mixer. At first four carts
were used, but as the concreting approached the mixer, less hauling was required, and finally
only two carts were used. An illustration of a Briggs cart is given by Fig. 113; it is hauled
by one horse, which the driver leads, and is dumped by an ingenious device operated from the
horse's head. The cart dumps from the bottom and spreads the load in a layer about 8 or 9 ins.
thick, so that no greater amount of shoveling is necessary than when barrows are used. It took
about 20 seconds for the cart to back up and get its load and about 5 seconds to dump and spread
the load.

Job II.--In this job the mixer was charged with wheelbarrows and wheelbarrows were also employed
to take the mixed concrete to the work, the mixer being moved forward at frequent intervals.
The stock piles were continuous, sand on one side of the street and stone on the other side.
A 1-3-6 Portland cement concrete was used, a very rich mixture for a 6-in. foundation. The
organization of the working gang was as follows:

Men loading and wheeling gravel             8
Men assisting in loading gravel             2
Man dumping barrows into hopper             1
Men loading and wheeling sand               3
Man dumping barrows into hopper             1
Men wheeling concrete in barrows            7
Men spreading concrete                      3
Men tamping concrete                        2
Man pouring cement into hopper              1
Man operating mixer                         1
Man shoveling spilled concrete              1
Man opening cement bags                     1
Engineer                                    1
                                           --
Total men in gang                          32

The average day's output of this gang was 150 cu. yds., or 900 sq. yds. in 8 hours; but on
the best day's work the output was 200 cu. yds., or 1,200 sq. yds. in 8 hours, which is a remarkable
record for 32 men and a mixer working only 8 hours.

The following is the labor cost of 8,896 sq. yds. of 4½-in. concrete foundation for an asphalt
pavement constructed in New York City in 1904:

Item.                          Per sq yd.
Foreman at $3.75                 $0.030
Laborers at $1.50                 0.242
Teams at $5                       0.040
Steam engine at $3.50             0.028
                                 ------
Total                            $0.340

The concrete was a 1-3-6 mixture and was mixed in a Foote mixer. These costs are compiled from
data collected by the authors.

~FOUNDATION CONSTRUCTION FOR STREET RAILWAY TRACK USING CONTINUOUS MIXERS.~--The following
account of the methods and cost of constructing a concrete foundation for street railway track
at St. Louis, Mo., is compiled from information published by Mr. Richard McCulloch. The work
was done by day labor by the United Railways Co., in 1906. Figure 114 shows the concrete construction.
A 1-2½-6½ Portland cement, broken stone concrete mixed by machine was used.

The material for the concrete was distributed on the street beside the tracks in advance of
the machine, the sand being first deposited, then the crushed rock piled on that, and finally
the cement sacks emptied on top of this pile. The materials were shoveled from this pile into
the concrete mixing machine without any attempt at hand mixing on the street. Great care was
taken in the delivery of materials on the street to have exactly the proper quantity of sand,
rock and cement, so that there would be enough for the ballasting of the track to the proper
height and that none would be left over. Each car was marked with its capacity in cubic feet,
and each receiver was furnished with a table by which he could easily estimate the number of
lineal feet of track over which the load should be distributed.

The concrete mixing machines were designed and built in the shops of the United Railways Co.
Three machines were used in this work, one for each gang. The machine is composed of a Drake
continuous worm mixer, fed by a chain dragging in a cast-iron trough. The trough is 36 ft.
long, so that there is room for 14 men to shovel into it. Water is sprayed into the worm after
the materials are mixed dry. This water was obtained from the fire plugs along the route. In
the first machine built, the Drake mixer was 8 ft. long. In the two newer machines the mixer
was 10 ft. long. Both the conveyor and the mixer were motor driven, current being obtained
for this purpose from the trolley wire overhead. Two types of machines were used, one in which
the conveyor trough was straight and 45 in. above the rail, and the other in which the conveyor
trough was lowered back of the mixer, being 25 in. above the rail. The latter type had the
advantage of not requiring such a lift in shoveling, but the trough is so low that a motor
truck cannot be placed underneath it. In the high machine the mixer is moved forward by a standard
motor truck under the conveyor. In the low machine the mixer is moved by a ratchet and gear
on the truck underneath the mixer. A crew of 27 men is required to work each machine, and under
average conditions concrete for 80 lin. ft. of single track, amounting to 22 cu. yds., can
be discharged per hour.

The costs of the concrete materials delivered per cubic yard of concrete were: Cement, per
barrel, $1.70; sand, per cu. yd., $0.675, and stone, per cu. yd., $0.425. The cost of the concrete
work per cubic yard and per lineal foot of track was as follows:

Item.                        Per lin. ft.   Per cu. yd.
Concrete materials             $0.791         $2.92
Labor mixing and placing        0.071          0.26
                               ------         -----

~FOUNDATION CONSTRUCTION USING BATCH MIXERS AND WAGON HAULAGE, ST. LOUIS, MO.~--The following
record of the method and cost of laying a concrete foundation for street pavement using machine
mixing and wagon haulage is given by Mr. D. A. Fisher. The foundation was 6 ins. thick. The
gravel was dumped from wagons into a large hopper, raised by a bucket elevator into bins, and
drawn off through gates into receiving hoppers on the charging platform where the cement was
added. The receiving hoppers discharged into the mixers, which discharged the mixed concrete
into a loading car that dumped into wagons, which delivered it on the street where wanted.
The longest haul in wagons was 30 mins., but careful tests showed that the concrete had hardened
well. The wagons were patent dump wagons of the drop-bottom type. Mr. Fisher says:

"You may consider the following figures a fair average of the plant referred to, working to
its capacity. To these amounts, however, must be added the interest on the investment, the
cost of wrecking the plant and the depreciation of the same, superintendence, and the pay roll
that must be maintained in wet weather. I am assuming the street as already brought to grade
and rolled.

"With labor at $1.75 per day of 10 hours, teams at $4, engineer and foremen at $3, and engine
at $5 per day, concrete mixed and put in place by the above method costs:

                                        Per cu. yd.
To mix                               $0.12 to $0.15
To deliver to street                  0.10 to  0.14
To spread and tamp in place           0.08 to  0.11
                                     --------------
Total                                $0.30 to $0.40

"The mixers are No. 2½ Smith, sold by the Contractors' Supply Co., Chicago, Ill., and a ½ yd.
cube, sold by Municipal Engineering & Contracting Co., Chicago.

"The above figures are on the basis of a batch every 2 minutes, which is easily maintained
by using the loading car, as by this means there will be no delay in the operation of the plant
owing to the irregularity of the arrival of the teams.

"My experience leads me to believe that a better efficiency can be obtained by using mixers
of 1 cu. yd. capacity, and that the batch mixer is the only type of machine where any certainty
of the proportion of the mixture is realized."

~FOUNDATION CONSTRUCTION USING A TRACTION MIXER.~--In laying a 6-in. foundation for an asphalt
pavement in Buffalo, N. Y., an average of 100 sq. yds., or 16.6 cu. yds., of concrete in place
was made per hour using the traction mixer shown by Fig. 115. This mixer was made by the Municipal
Engineering & Contracting Co., of Chicago, Ill., and consisted of one of that company's improved
cube mixers operated by a gasoline engine and equipped with the regulation mechanical charging
device and also with a swinging conveyor to deliver the mixed concrete to the work. The feature
of the apparatus in its application to paving work is the conveyor. This was 25 ft. long and
pivoted at the mixer end so as to swing through an arc of 170°. The mixer discharged into a
skip or bucket traveling on the conveyor frame and discharging over the end spreading its load
anywhere within a radius of 25 ft. In operation the mixer traveled along the center of the
street, backing away from the finished foundation and toward the stock pile, which was continuous
and was deposited along the center of the street. The bulk of the sand and stone was thus shoveled
direct into the charging bucket and the remainder was wheeled to the bucket in barrows. As
the charging bucket is only 14 ins. high the barrows could be dumped directly into it from
the ground. The gang worked was 17 including a foreman and one boy, and with this gang 100
sq. yds. of 6-in. foundation was laid per hour. Assuming an average wage of 20 cts. an hour
the cost of mixing and placing the foundation concrete was 3.4 cts. per sq. yd. or 20.4 cts.
per cu. yd. for labor alone.

~FOUNDATION CONSTRUCTION USING CONTINUOUS MIXER.~--The foundation was 6 ins. thick for an asphalt
pavement and was laid in Chicago, Ill. The concrete used was exceptionally rich for pavement
foundation work, it being a 1-3-6 Lehigh Portland cement, broken stone mixture. The mixing
was done by machine, a mixer made by the Buffalo Concrete Mixer Co., Buffalo, N. Y., being
used. This mixer was equipped with an elevating charging hopper and was operated as a continuous
mixer. The mixer was mounted on wheels and was pulled along the center of the street ahead
of the work with its discharge end toward the work. Moves of about 25 to 30 ft. were made,
the mixer being pulled ahead for this distance each time that the concrete came up to its discharge
end. The stock piles were continuous, sand on one side and stone on the other side of the street.
Cement was stored in a pile at each end of the block. All materials were wheeled from stock
piles to mixer in wheelbarrows. The men wheeling sand and stone loaded their own barrows, wheeled
them to the mixer and discharged them directly into the elevating hopper. No runways were used,
the barrows being wheeled directly on the ground. The cement was brought in barrows, two or
three bags being a load, and dumped alongside a cement box which was located close to and at
one side of the elevating hopper. A man untied the bags and emptied them into the cement box
and another man scooped the cement out of the box in bucketfuls and emptied it over the sand
and stone in the elevating hopper. The mixer discharged onto a sheet iron shoveling board,
and the concrete was carried in shovels from shoveling board to place, the length of carry
being a maximum of 25 to 30 ft. Two men were required to pull down the cone of concrete at
the discharge end of the mixer and to keep the stone from separating and rolling down the sides.
The gang was organized as follows:

                                          No. Men.
Loading and wheeling stone                      10
Loading and wheeling sand                   3 to 4
Loading and wheeling cement                      2
Untieing and emptying cement bags                1
Charging cement to hopper                        1
Operating mixer and hopper                       1

Sweeping concrete                                1
General laborers                                 3
Foreman                                          1
Watchman                                         1
Timekeeper                                       1
                                                --
Total gang                                      40

This gang averaged 1,000 sq. yds. of 6-in. foundation per 10-hour day; a maximum of 1,400 sq.
yds. was laid in a day. We have thus an average of 167 cu. yds. and a maximum of 234 cu. yds.
of concrete foundation mixed and placed per 10-hour day. At an average wage of $2 per day the
average labor cost of mixing and placing concrete was 48 cts. per cu. yd. or 8 cts. per sq.
yd. of 6-in. foundation. It was stated that the gang was larger by three men than was ordinarily
used owing to certain extra work being done at the time that the above figures were collected.
Taking out three extra men and the timekeeper and watchman we get 34 men actually working in
mixing and placing concrete. This reduced gang gives us a labor cost for mixing and placing
of about 41 cts. per cu. yd. or 6.8 cts. per sq. yd. of 6-in. foundation.

~FOUNDATION CONSTRUCTION USING A BATCH MIXER.~--The following figures are an average of several
jobs using a Ransome ½-cu. yd. mixer for constructing 6-in. foundations. The mixer was moved
1,000 ft. at a time and the work conducted 500 ft. in each direction from each station. The
concrete materials were delivered from stock pile to mixer in wheelbarrows and the mixed concrete
was hauled to the work in two-wheeled Ransome carts. Run planks were laid for the carts and
one man readily pushed a cart holding 6 cu. ft. The men had to work fast on the long haul but
had an easy time when the haul was short. The organization of the gang was as follows, wages
being $1.50 per day:

10 men loading and wheeling stone          $15.00
4 men loading and wheeling sand              6.00
2 men handling cement                        3.00
1 fireman                                    2.00
1 man dumping mixer                          1.50
5 men wheeling carts                         7.50
3 men spreading and ramming                  4.50
1 foreman                                    3.50
                                           ------
Total wages per day                        $43.00

This gang averaged 1,080 sq. yds. of 6-in. foundation or 180 cu. yds. of concrete in place
per day which gives a labor cost of 24 cts per cu. yd. or 4 cts. per sq. yd. for mixing and
placing.

Next to pavement foundations the most extensive use of concrete in street work is for cement
walks and concrete curb and gutter. Usually the mixing and placing of the concrete is hand
work, practically the only exceptions being where pavement base, curbing and sidewalks are
built all at once, using machine mixers. The same objections that have been raised to machine
mixers in laying pavement foundation are raised against them for curb and walk construction,
and owing to the much smaller yardage per lineal foot of street in walk and curb work these
objections carry more force than they do in case of paving work. Another argument against the
use of mixers is that both walk and curb and gutter work involve the use of forms and the application
of mortar finish, the placing of which are really the limiting factors in the rate of progress
permissible, and this rate is too slow to consume an output necessary to make a mixer plant
economical as compared with hand mixing where so much transportation is involved. Concrete
sidewalk and curb work are essentially hand mixing work; they, therefore, involve a careful
study of the economies of hand mixing and wheelbarrow haulage which are fully discussed in
Chapter II.

CEMENT SIDEWALKS.

Sidewalk construction consists in molding on a suitably prepared sub-base a concrete slab from
3½ to 7½ ins. thick, depending on practice, and finishing its top surface with a ½ to 1½-in.
wearing surface of cement mortar.

~GENERAL METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION.~--The excavation and preparation of the sub-grade call for
little notice beyond the warning that they should never be neglected. The authors have seen
many thousands of feet of cement walk laid in the middle West in which the sub-base was placed
directly on the natural sod, often covered with grass and weeds a foot high. Such practice
is wholly vicious. The sod should always be removed and the surface soil excavated to a depth
depending upon the climate and nature of the ground and the foundation bed well tamped. From
4 to 6 ins. depth of excavation will serve where the soil is reasonably hard and there are
no heavy frosts; with opposite conditions a 12-in. excavation is none too deep. The thickness
of the broken stone, gravel, cinder or sand sub-base should likewise be varied with the character
of the soil, the conditions of natural drainage and the prevalence of frost. In well drained
sandy soils 6 to 8 ins. of sub-base are sufficient, but in clayey soils with poor natural drainage
the sub-base should be from 10 to 12 ins. thick at least; the local conditions will determine
the thickness of sub-base necessary and in places it may be desirable to provide by artificial
drainage against the accumulation of water under the concrete. Tile drains are better and cheaper
than excessively deep foundations. The thorough tamping of the sub-base is essential to avoid
settling and subsequent cracking of the concrete slab. This is a part of sidewalk work which
is often neglected.

Portland cement concrete, sand and broken stone or gravel mixtures in the proportions of 1-3-5
and 1-3-6 are used for base slabs. For walks up to 7 ft. wide the slab is made 3½ ins. thick
for residence streets and 4½ to 5 ins. thick for business streets; for wider walks the thickness
is increased to 7 ins. for 8-ft. width and 7½ ins. for 9 to 10-ft. width. Roughly the thickness
of the walk in inches (base and top together) is made about equal to its width in feet. The
concrete is deposited in a single layer and tamped thoroughly, either in separate blocks behind
suitable forms or in a continuous slab which is while fresh cut through to make separate blocks.
For walks up to 8 ft. wide the slab is divided by transverse joints spaced about the width
of the walk apart, but for the wider walks the safety of this division depends upon the thickness
of the base; an 8-ft. walk with a 5-in. base can safely be laid with joints 8 ft. apart, but
if the slab is only 4 ins. thick it had better be laid in 4×4-ft. squares. The mode of procedure
in base construction is as follows:

The sub-base being laid, side forms held by stakes are placed as shown by Fig. 116, with the
top edges of the boards exactly to the grade of the top surface of the finished walk. The concrete
is then deposited between these side forms and tamped until it is brought up to the level marked
by the templet A. If the plan is to deposit the base in sections transverse plates of 3/8 to
¼ in. steel are set across the walk between the side boards at proper intervals and the concrete
tamped behind them; sometimes the concreting is done in alternate blocks. When the steel plate
is withdrawn an open joint is left for expansion and contraction. Where the plan is to lay
the base in one piece which is afterwards cut into blocks, the cutting is done with a spade
or cleaver.

Portland cement mortar mixed 1 to 1½ to 1 to 2 is used for the wearing surface, and is laid
from ½ in. to 1½ ins. thick, depending upon the width of the walk and the thickness of the
base. As a rule the mortar is mixed rather stiff; it is placed with trowels in one coat usually,
but sometimes in two coats, and less often by tamping. The mortar coat is brought up flush
with the top edges of the side forms by means of the templet B, and the top finished by floating
and troweling. The wearing coat is next divided into sections corresponding with the sections
into which the base is divided, by cutting through it with a trowel guided by a straight edge
and then rounding the edges of the cut with a special tool called a jointer and shown by Fig.
117. An edger, Fig. 118, is then run around the outside edges of the block to round them. The
laying of the mortar surface must always follow closely the laying of the base so that the
two will set together.

~BONDING OF WEARING SURFACE AND BASE.~--Trouble in securing a perfect bond between the wearing
surface and the base usually comes from one or more of the following causes: (1) Applying the
surface after the base concrete has set. While several means are available for bonding fresh
to old concrete as described in Chapter XXIV, the better practice is not to resort to them
except in case of necessity but to follow so close with the surfacing that the base will not
have had time to take initial set. (2) Poor mixing and tamping of this base concrete. (3) Use
of clayey gravel or an accumulation of dirt on the surface. In tamping clayey gravel the water
flushes the clay to the surface and prevents the best bond. (4) Poor troweling, that is failure
to press and work the mortar coat into the base concrete. Some contractors advocate tamping
the mortar coat to obviate this danger. Conversely, to make the surface coat adhere firmly
to the base it must be placed before the base concrete has set; the base concrete must be thoroughly
cleaned or kept clean from surface dirt; the surface coat must be tamped or troweled forcibly
into the base concrete so as to press out all air and the film of water which collects on top
of the concrete base.

~PROTECTION OF WORK FROM SUN AND FROST.~--Sun and frost cause scaling and hair cracks. For
work in freezing weather the water, sand and gravel should be heated or salt used to retard
freezing until the walk can be finished; it may then be protected from further action of the
frost by covering it first with paper and then with a mattress of sawdust, shavings or sand
and covering the whole with a tarpaulin. Methods of heating concrete materials and rules for
compounding salt solutions are given in Chapter VII. The danger from sun arises from the too
rapid drying out of the surface coating; the task then is to hold the moisture in the work
until the mixture has completely hardened. Portable frames composed of tarpaulin stretched
over 2×4-in. strips may be laid over the finished walk to protect it from the direct rays of
the sun; these frames can be readily removed to permit sprinkling. Practice varies in the matter
of sprinkling, but it is the safe practice in hot weather to sprinkle frequently for several
days. Moisture is absolutely necessary to the perfect hardening of cement work and a surplus
is always better than a scarcity. In California the common practise is to cover the cement
walk, as soon as it has hardened, with earth which is left on for several days.

~CAUSE AND PREVENTION OF CRACKS.~--Cracks in cement walks are of two kinds, fractures caused
by any one of several construction faults and which reach through the surface coating or through
both surface and base, and hair cracks which are simply skin fractures. Large cracks are the
result of constructive faults and one of the most common of these is poor foundation construction;
other causes are poor mixing and tamping of the base, too large blocks for thickness of the
work, failure to cut joints through work. Hair cracks are the result of flushing the neat cement
to the surface by excessive troweling or the use of too wet a mixture. The prevention of cracks
obviously lies in seeing that the construction faults cited do not exist. If expansion joints
are not provided, a long stretch of cement walk will expand on a hot day and bulge up at some
point of weakness breaking the walk.

~COST OF CEMENT WALKS.~--The cost of cement walks is commonly estimated in cents per square
foot, including the necessary excavation and the cinder or gravel foundation. The excavation
usually costs about 13 cts. per cu. yd., and if the earth is loaded into wagons the loading
costs another 10 cts. per cu. yd., wages being 15 cts. per hr. The cost of carting depends
upon the length of haul, and may be estimated from data given in Chapter III. If the total
cost of excavation is 27 cts. per cu. yd., and if the excavation is 12 ins. deep, we have a
cost of 1 ct. per sq. ft. for excavation alone. Usually the excavation is not so deep, and
often the earth from the excavation can be sold for filling lots.

In estimating the quantity of cement required for walks, it is well to remember that 100 sq.
ft. of walk 1 in. thick require practically 0.3 cu. yd. concrete. If the concrete base is 3
ins. thick, we have 0.3 × 3, or 0.9 cu. yd. per 100 sq. ft. of walk. And by using the tables
in Chapter II we can estimate the quantity of cement required for any given mixture. In cement
walk work the cement is commonly measured loose, so that a barrel can be assumed to hold 4.5
cu. ft. of cement. If the barrel is assumed to hold 4.5 cu. ft., it will take less than 1 bbl.
of cement to make 1 cu. yd. of 1-3-6 concrete; hence it will not require more than 0.9 bbl.
cement, 0.9 cu. yd. stone, and 0.45 cu. yd. sand per 100 sq. ft. of 3-in. concrete base. The
1-in. wearing coat made of 1-1½ mortar requires about 3 bbls. of cement per cu. yd., if the
barrel is assumed to hold 4.5 cu. ft., and since it takes 0.3 cu. yd. per 100 sq. ft., 1 in.
thick, we have 0.3 × 3, or 0.9 bbl. cement per 100 sq. ft. for the top coat. This makes a total
of 1.8 bbls. per 100 sq. ft., or 1 bbl. makes 55 sq. ft. of 4-in. walk.

As the average of a number of small jobs, the authors' records show the following costs per
sq. ft. of 4-in. walk such as just described:

                                                     Cts. per sq. ft.

Excavating 8 ins. deep                                           0.65

                                                                 ----
Total cents                                                      9.00

This is 9 cts. per sq. ft. of finished walk. The gangs that built the walk were usually two
masons at $2.50 each per 10-hr. day with two laborers at $1.50 each. Such a gang averaged 500
sq. ft. of walk per day.

~Cost at Toronto, Ont.~--Mr. C. H. Rust, City Engineer, Toronto, Ont., gives the following
costs of constructing concrete sidewalks by day labor. The sidewalks have a 4-in. foundation
of coarse gravel or soft coal cinders, thoroughly consolidated by tamping or rolling, upon
which is placed a 3½-in. layer of concrete composed of 1 part Portland cement, 2 parts clean,
sharp, coarse sand, and 5 parts of approved furnace slag, broken stone or screened gravel.
The wearing surface is 1 in. thick, or 1 part Portland cement, 1 part clean, sharp, coarse
sand, and 3 parts screened pea gravel, crushed granite, quartzite or hard limestone. Costs
are given of a 6-ft. and a 4-ft. walk as follows:

The rates of wages and the number of men employed were as follows: 1 foreman, at $3.50 per
day; 1 finisher, at 30 cts. per hour; 1 helper, at 22 cts. per hour; 15 laborers, at 20 cts.
per hour.

~Cost at Quincy, Mass.~--The following costs are given by Mr. C. M. Saville for constructing
695 sq. yds. of granolithic walk around the top of the Forbes Hill Reservoir embankment at
Quincy, Mass. This walk was laid on a broken stone foundation 12 ins. thick; the concrete base
was 4 ins. thick at the sides and 5 ins. thick at the center; the granolithic finish was 1
in. thick. The walk was 6 ft. wide and was laid in 6-ft. sections, a steel plate being used
to keep adjacent sections entirely separate. The average gang was 6 men and a team on the base
and 2 masons and 1 tender on the finish. The average length of walk finished per day was 60
ft. The cost was as follows:

The two masons received $2.25 per day each and their helper $1.50 per day, and they averaged
360 sq. ft. per day, which made the cost 1-2/3 cts. per sq. ft. for labor laying granolithic
finish. The cost of placing the foundation stone is very high and the cost of concrete base
also runs unusually high, the reasons for these high costs are not evident.

~Cost at San Francisco.~--Mr. George P. Wetmore, of the contracting firm of Cushing & Wetmore,
San Francisco, gives the following figures relating to sidewalk work in that city. The foundations
of cement walks in the residence district of San Francisco are 2½ ins. thick, made of 1-2-6
concrete, the stone not exceeding 1 in. in size. The wearing coat is ½ in. thick, made of 1
part cement to 1 part screened beach gravel. The cement is measured loose, 4.7 cu. ft. per
barrel. The foundation is usually laid in sections 10 ft. long; the width of sidewalks is usually
15 ft. The top coat is placed immediately, leveled with a straight edge and gone over with
trowels till fairly smooth. After the initial set and first troweling, it is left until quite
stiff, when it is troweled again and polished--a process called "hard finishing." The hard
finish makes the surface less slippery. The surface is then covered with sand, and watered
each day for 8 or 10 days. The contract price is 9 to 10 cts. per sq. ft. for a 3-in. walk;
12 to 14 cts. for a 4-in. walk having a wearing coat ¾ to 1-in. thick. A gang of 3 or 4 men
averages 150 to 175 sq. ft. per man per day of 9 hrs. Prices and wages are as follows:

Cement, per bbl.                                $2.50 Crushed rock, per cu. yd.           
1.75 Gravel and sand for foundation, per cu. yd.      1.40 Gravel for top finish, per cu. yd.
1.75 Finisher wages, best, per hr.                    0.40 Finisher helper, best, per hr. 
0.25 Laborer, best, per hr.                           0.20

~Cost in Iowa.~--Mr. L. L. Bingham sent out letters to a large number of sidewalk contractors
in Iowa asking for data of cost. The following was the average cost per square foot as given
in the replies:

                                      Cts. per sq. ft.
Cement, at $2 per bbl.                     3.6
Sand and gravel                            1.5
Labor, at $2.30 per day (average)          2.2
Incidentals, estimated                     0.7
                                           ---
Total per sq. ft                           8.0

This applies to a walk 4 ins. thick, and includes grading in some cases, while in other cases
it does not. Mr. Bingham writes that in this respect the replies were unsatisfactory. He also
says that the average wages paid were $2.30 per man per day. It will be noted that a barrel
of cement makes 55½ sq. ft. of walk, or it takes 1.8 bbls. per 100 sq. ft. The average contract
price for a 4-in. walk was 11½ cts. per sq. ft.

CONCRETE PAVEMENT.

Concrete pavement is constructed in all essential respects like cement sidewalk. The sub-soil
is crowned and rolled hard, then drains are placed under the curbs; if necessary to secure
good drainage a sub-base of gravel, cinders or broken stone 4 to 8 ins. thick is laid and compacted
by rolling. The foundation being thus prepared a base of concrete 4 to 5 ins. thick is laid
and on this a wearing surface 2 to 3 ins. thick. As showing specific practice we give the construction
in two cities which have used concrete pavement extensively.

~Windsor, Ontario.~--The street is first excavated to the proper grade and crown and rolled
with a 15-ton roller. Tile drains are then placed directly under the curb line and a 6×16-in.
curb is constructed, vising 1-2-4 concrete faced with 1-2 mortar. Including the 3-in. tile
drain this curb costs the city by contract 38 cts. per lin. ft. The pavement is then constructed
between finished curbs, as shown by Fig. 119.

The fine profile of the sub-grade is obtained by stretching strings from curb to curb, measuring
down the required depth and trimming off the excess material. The concrete base is then laid
4 ins. thick. A 1-3-7 Portland cement concrete is used, the broken stone ranging from ¼ in.
to 3 ins. in size, and it is well tamped. This concrete is mixed by hand and as each batch
is placed the wearing surface is put on and finished. The two layers are placed within 10 minutes
of each other, the purpose being to secure a monolithic or one-piece slab. The top layer consists
of 2 ins. of 1-2-4 Portland cement and screened gravel, ¼ in. to 1 in., concrete. This layer
is put on rather wet, floated with a wooden float and troweled with a steel trowel while still
wet. Some 20,500 sq. yds. of this construction have been used and cost the city by contract:

                                         Per sq. yd.

Bottom 4-in. layer 1-3-7 concrete           $0.57
Top 2-in. layer 1-2-4 concrete               0.32
Excavation                                   0.10
                                            -----
Total                                       $0.99

This construction was varied on other streets for the purpose of experiment. In one case a
4-in. base of 1-3-7 stone concrete was covered with 2 ins. of 1-2-2 gravel concrete. In other
cases the construction was: 4-in. base of 1-3-7 stone concrete; 1½-in. middle layer of 1-2-4
gravel concrete, and ½-in. top layer of 1-2 sand mortar. All these constructions have been
satisfactory; the pavement is not slippery. The cost to the city by contract for the three-layer
construction has in two cases been as follows:

Church St., 8,000 sq. yds.:                  Per sq. yd.
4-in. base 1-3-7 concrete                       $0.57
1½-in. 1-2-4 and ½-in. 1-2 mixture               0.39
Excavation                                       0.10
                                                -----
Total                                           $1.15

The cost of materials and rates of wages were about as follows:

Portland cement f. o. b. cars Windsor, per bbl.    $2.05 River sand, per cu. yd.          
1.15 River gravel, screened, per cu. yd.                 1.25 Crushed limestone, ¼ to 3 ins.,
per ton             1.15 Labor, per day                              1.75 to 2.00

At these prevailing prices the contractor got a fair profit at the contract price of $1.15;
at 99 cts., any profit is questionable, according to City Engineer George S. Hanes, who gives
us the above records. Expansion joints are located from 20 to 80 ft. apart and are filled with tar.

~Richmond, Ind.~--The first concrete pavement was built in 1896 and since then it has been
used extensively, especially for wide alleys and narrow streets where traffic is heavy and
concentrated in small space. The method of construction has varied from time to time but the
construction shown by Fig. 120 is fairly representative. Usually a 1-3-5 concrete is used for
the base, 5 ins. thick, and a 1-2 mortar for the top coat, 1½ ins. thick. In 1904 this pavement
cost the city by contract 16 cts. per sq. ft. or $1.54 per sq. yd, with wages and prices as
follows: Stone on the work, $1.25 per cu. yd.; gravel and sand, $0.75 per cu. yd.; cement,
$2.25 per barrel; common laborers, 16½ cts. per hour, and cement finishers, 40 cts. per hour.

~CONCRETE CURB AND GUTTER.~

Current practice varies materially in constructing concrete curb and gutter. The more common
practice is to lay the curb and water table in one piece, or as a monolith, but this is by
no means universal practice. In much work the curb wall and the water table slab are constructed
separately, the construction joint being sometimes horizontal where the curb wall sits on the
slab and sometimes vertical where the water table butts against the wall. Again it is the common
practice to construct curb and gutter in sections, laid either alternately or in succession,
separated by sand joints to provide for expansion and contraction, but this is not universal
practice, much of such work being constructed as a continuous wall with no provision for temperature
movements except the natural breaks at driveways. All of these types of construction appear
to have given reasonable satisfaction, but exact data for a final comparison are not available,
so that we are forced to reason on general principles. Such a course of reasoning indicates
that the best results should be expected where the curb and water table are built in one piece
and in sections of reasonable length separated by expansion joints.

~FORM CONSTRUCTION.~--The form construction for curb and gutter work is determined by the general
plan of construction followed,--whether monolithic or two-piece construction. In monolithic
construction two types of forms are employed, sectional or box forms and continuous forms.
A good example of box form is shown by Fig. 121. This form was designed for a curb 14 ins.
high at the back, 6 ins. high in front and 24 ins. from face of curb to outer edge of gutter,
constructed in sections 7 ft. long. The form, it will be observed, is a complete box, in which
alternate sections of curb are molded and after having set are filled between using the same
form but dispensing with the end boards which are replaced by the completed sections of curb.
A fairly representative example of continuous form is shown by Fig. 122; in this construction
a continuous line of plank is set to form the back of the curb and another line to form the
face of the gutter slab, both lines being held in place by stakes. When the gutter slab concrete
has been placed and surfaced the form for the front of the curb is set as shown and the upper
portion of the curb wall concreted behind it. The method in detail of constructing curb and
gutter, with this type of form, at Ottawa, Ont., is described in a succeeding section. Here
the joints were formed by inserting a partition of 3/8-in. boiler plate every 12 ft., which
was withdrawn just previous to finishing up the surface; the sections between partitions were
concreted continuously. Another method is to make the partitions of plank, concrete every other
section, then remove the partition plank and concrete the remaining spaces against the previously
finished work. A different method of supporting the plank forming the face of the curb wall,
is to clamp it to the back form (Fig. 123), spacers being inserted to keep the two their proper
distances apart. The forms shown by Figs. 121 to 123 are for monolithic curb and gutter. In
two-piece construction where the curb wall is constructed on the finished gutter slab practically
the same method of construction is employed as is illustrated by Fig. 122 except that no attempt
is made to concrete the curb wall before the slab concrete has begun to set. The more common
and the preferable method of two-piece construction is illustrated by Fig. 124; the curb proper
is built first using the simple box form shown at the right hand, then the water table is built
using the completed curb as the form for the back and a board held by stakes as a form for
the front. This board is set with its top edge exactly to the grade of the finished water table
so as to serve as a guide for one end of the template, the other end of which rides on the
top of the finished curb wall. Forms for curves at street intersections are best constructed
by driving stakes to the exact arc of the curve and bending a 3/8-in. steel plate around them
or bending and nailing 7/8×1¼-in. strips. Soaking the wood strips thoroughly will make them
bend easily. The cost of form work in constructing curb and gutter is chiefly labor cost in
erecting and taking down the forms.

~CONCRETE MIXTURES AND CONCRETING.~--The curb body is usually made of a 1-3-5 or 6 concrete
and the curb finish of a 1-2 mortar. Portland cement is employed almost exclusively. The concrete
mixture commonly used is of such consistency that thorough ramming is necessary to flush the
cement to the surface. The cubical contents of combined curb and gutter of the forms illustrated
will run from 3 to 5 cu. yds. per 100 ft., and about one-eighth of this will be facing mortar
1 in. thick; thus a curb running 5 cu. yds. per 100 ft. will contain per 100 ft. about 0.83
cu. yd. of mortar and 4.17 cu. yds. of concrete. The usual method of concreting is to erect
the forms for the back of the curb wall and the front of the gutter slab and concrete to the
height of the water table clear across; then shape the exposed top of the water table to section
and place the mortar finish, and then erect the face form for the gutter wall, bring the concrete
backing and vertical face finish up together and, finally, finish the top. The finish coat
is placed by troweling on the horizontal surfaces; on the vertical face of the curb wall it
may be placed in any one of several ways. Frequently the mortar coat is simply plastered against
the face board and filled behind with concrete. Another method is to lay a 1-in. board against
the inside of the form, concrete behind it, then withdraw the board, fill the space with mortar
and tamp concrete and mortar to a thorough bond. The special face forms shown in Chapter VIII
may be used in place of the board. The securing of a good bond between the backing concrete
and the mortar facing is governed by the same conditions that govern sidewalk work.

~COST OF CURB AND GUTTER.~--The cost of concrete curb and gutter is commonly estimated in cents
per lineal foot. The cost of excavating, loading and carting will run about the same per cubic
yard as for sidewalks. Excavating the trench and preparing the sub-grade usually runs from
½ ct. to 2 cts. per foot of curb, but sometimes it amounts to 3 cts. Placing the sub-base will
cost for placing and tamping 1 ct. per ft., to which is to be added the cost of materials;
a 6-in. sub-base 30 ins. wide contains 4.7 cu. yds., tamped measure, of materials per 100 ft.
The amount of materials per foot depends upon the cross-section of the curb; it equals in cubic
yards the area of cross-section in square feet divided by 27, and of this volume about one-eighth
will be 1-2 mortar and seven-eighths 1-3-6 concrete. The tables in Chapter II give the amounts
of materials per cubic yard of these mixtures; the product of these quantities and the cost
of the materials on the ground gives the cost. The labor cost of mixing and placing, including
the form work, will run from 10 to 14 cts. per foot. In round figures curb and gutter of the
section shown in the accompanying illustrations may be estimated to cost in the neighborhood
of 40 cts. per lineal foot. The following sections give records of cost of individual jobs
of curb and gutter construction.

~Cost at Ottawa, Canada.~--The method and cost of constructing 1,326 ft. of concrete curb and
gutter at Ottawa, Ont., are given in some detail by Mr. G. H. Richardson, Assistant City Engineer,
in the annual report of the City Engineer for 1905. We have remodeled the description and rearranged
the figures of cost in the following paragraphs.

The concrete curb was built before doing any work on the roadway, and the first task was the
excavation of a trench 2½ ft. wide and averaging 1 ft. 8 ins. in depth through light red sand.
On the bottom of this trench there was placed a foundation of stone spalls 8 ins. thick; in
width this foundation reached from 3 ins. back of the curb to 6 ins. beyond the front of the
water table. The curb was made 5 ins. thick and ran from 10 ins. to 5½ ins. in height, and
the water table was 14 ins. wide and 4 ins. thick, with a fall of 1¼ ins. from front to back.
The concrete used was a mixture of 1 Portland cement, 3 sand, 3 5/8-in. screened limestone,
and 4 2-in. stone. It was deposited in forms and tamped to bring the water to the face and
then smoothed with a light troweling of stiff mortar.

The forms were constructed by first setting pickets and nailing to them a back board 2 ins.
thick and 12 ins. wide and a front board 2 ins. thick and 6 ins. wide. The concrete for the
water table was deposited in this form in sections and brought to surface by straight edge
riding on wooden strips nailed across the form and properly set to slope, etc. After the water
table had been troweled down and brushed a 1×10-in. board was set to mold the front face of
the curb. This board was sustained by small "knee frames" made of three pieces of 1×2-in. stuff,
one conforming to the slope of the water table and long enough to extend beyond the front of
the 2×6-in. front board, a second standing plumb and bearing against the 1×10-in. face board,
and the third forming a small corner brace between the two former to hold them in their proper
relative positions. The 1×10-in. face board, etc., was separated from the 2×12-in. back board
by a 5-in. block at each end, and then braced by the knee frames every 3 or 4 ft. In this way
it was possible to bring this 1×10-in. board into perfect line by moving the knee braces in
or out, and when correct nailing them to the 2×6-in. front board. The 1×10-in. face board being
in position and braced and lined, the curb material was thoroughly tamped in, and when ready
was troweled and brushed on the top, a small round being worked onto the top front corner with
the trowel.

Expansion joints were provided for by building into the curb every 12 ft., a piece of 3/8-in.
boiler plate, which was afterward withdrawn and the joint filled with sand and faced over.
As soon as the concrete had set sufficiently the face board was taken down and face of curb
finished and brushed, the fillet between curb and water table being finished to 2½ ins. radius.
Circular curb and gutter of same construction was built at each corner, ½-in. basswood being
used for forms, instead of 2×1-in. lumber.

In addition to the actual construction of curb and gutter the cost given below includes the
cleaning up of the street, spreading or removal of all surplus material from excavation, and
the extension of all sidewalks out to the curbs at the corners. It was also necessary to maintain
a watchman on this work, which duty, under ordinary circumstances, would be done by the general
watchman. The total length built was 1,326 ft., of which 1,209 ft. is straight and 117 ft.
curved to a 12-ft. radius.

The rates of wages paid were $2 for horse and cart, $1.65 for watchman, and an average of $1.90
per day for labor, including foreman; all for nine hours' work per day. The working force consisted
of foreman, finisher, handy man. four concrete men, and three laborers.

The labor cost of the work was as follows:

The cost of materials for curb and foundation were as follows:

      Total                                         $41.17

This total, when divided by 1,326 lin. ft. of curb, gives the cost per lineal foot as about
3 cts. We can now summarize as follows:

                                Per lin.   P. C. of
   Item.              Total.       ft.       total.

      Total         $713.06     $0.54        100

As indicated above, on more extensive work the costs of carting, watchman, cleaning up, and
extras would be avoided. They cost on this work 5 cts. and the work could therefore be done
for 49 cts. if no such charges were included. On such work also the charge for supplies would
be lower per foot and on any future work the labor cost could be materially lowered, this curb
having been somewhat of an experiment as to method of construction. It is thought that with
no charges for carting, cleaning, watchman, and extras, and with the experience obtained, this
curb could be built for about 46 cts. The proportions adopted and the method of construction
followed, produce a very strong, dense, homogeneous curb and gutter.

~Cost at Champaign, Ill.~--The following costs were recorded by Mr. Charles Apple, and relate
to work done at Champaign, Ill., in 1903. The work was done by contract, at 45 cts. per lin.
ft. of the curb and gutter shown in Fig. 125.

The concrete curb and gutter was built in a trench as shown in the cut. The earth was removed
from this trench with pick and shovel at a rate of 1 cu. yd. per man per hour. The concrete
work was built in alternate sections, 7 ft. in length. A continuous line of planks was set
on edge to form the front and back of the concrete curb and gutter; and wood partitions staked
into place, were used. The cost of the work was as follows:

labor per 100 ft.                   $38.93

This is the total cost, exclusive of lumber, tools, interest, profits, etc., and it is practically
40 cts. per lin. ft.

In 100 lin. ft. of curb and gutter there were 4.6 cu. yds. of concrete and mortar facing, 4
cu. yds. of which were concrete; hence the 9 men in the concrete gang laid 14 cu. yds. of concrete
per day, whereas the 4 men mixing and placing the mortar finishing laid only 2½ cu. yds. of
mortar per day, assuming that the mortar finishing averaged just 1 in. thick. Since these 4
men (2 mixers and 2 finishers) received $10.50 a day, it cost more than $4 per cu. yd. to mix
and place the 1-2 mortar, as compared with $1.41 per cu. yd. for mixing and placing the concrete.
The concrete was built in alternate sections 7 ft. long. The 3 men placing forms averaged 400
lin. ft. a day, so that the cost of placing the forms was $1 per cu. yd. of concrete. The 2
men placing and tamping cinders averaged 16 cu. yds. of cinders per day, or 8 cu. yds. per
man. This curb and gutter was built by contract at 45 cts. per lin. ft.

For several jobs, in which a curb and gutter essentially the same as shown in Fig. 125 was
built, our records show a general correspondence with the above given data of Mr. Apple. Our
work was done with smaller gangs, 1 mason and 2 laborers being the ordinary gang. Such a gang
would lay 80 to 100 lin. ft. of curb and gutter per 10-hr. day, at the following cost:

1 mason at $2.50              $2.50
2 laborers at $1.50            3.00
                              -----
Total                         $5.50

This made a cost of 5½ to 7 cts. per lin. ft. for labor, and it did not include the cost of
digging a trench to receive the curb and gutter.

CHAPTER XVI.

METHODS AND COST OF LINING TUNNELS AND SUBWAYS.

Tunnel lining work is of two distinct classes: Lining work, done during original construction
and relining of tunnels in service. The methods of work to be adopted and the cost of work
will be different in the two cases. In relining work the costs are increased by the necessity
of providing for the movement of trains and by the delays due to these movements and also by
the labor of removing the old lining and, often, of enlarging the excavation. Comparatively
few published figures are available on the cost of concrete tunnel lining, and such as exist
are commonly incomplete. The common practice is to record the cost as so much per lineal foot
of tunnel. This should be done, but the record should also show the cost per cubic yard of
concrete in the lining. The notions of engineers vary as to the proper thickness of lining
to use and this dimension also varies with the character of the ground. One tunnel lining may
easily contain twice as many cubic yards of concrete per lineal foot of lining as another tunnel
contains.

The two problems in form construction for tunnel work are: First, to construct the form work
so that it does not interfere with train movements, and, second, to construct it so that it
can be taken down, transported and re-erected and thus used over and over. The examples of
practice given in the succeeding sections are the best instructions that can be laid before
the reader in regard to possible ways of solving these problems and, also, the problem of handling
the concrete and other materials to the work.

~METHOD OF LINING CAPITOL HILL TUNNEL, PENNSYLVANIA R. R., WASHINGTON, D. C.~--The tunnel through
Capitol Hill for the Pennsylvania R. R. approach to its new Union Station at Washington, D.
C, is a two-track, double tube tunnel 4,000 ft. long through earth. Figure 126 shows the lining
construction; it consists of stone masonry center wall, mass concrete inverts and side walls
and a brick roof arch backed with concrete. For building the center and side walls the traveling
derrick shown by Fig. 127 was employed. This traveler moved ahead with the work on a 14-ft.
gage track and it handled the stone and concrete buckets from the material cars to the workmen
on the walls. In connection with the derrick in the concrete side wall construction use was
made of steel plate forms for the inside faces of the walls. These forms were made of 4×10
ft. sections of steel plate, constructed as shown by Fig. 128, and connected together by bolting
through the flanges. The steel forms were erected by hand in advance of the derrick, 20 ft.
of form on each side at a time. The concrete buckets were brought into the tunnel on cars hauled
by electric motors from the mixing plant at the portal, and the buckets were lifted by the
derricks and emptied into the forms. The side walls were concreted to the springing line and
then the five-ring brick roof arches were constructed on traveling centers and in 20-ft. sections.
The remainder of the concrete was then placed over the arches by means of the special back-filling
machine, shown by Fig. 129. This machine also handled the earth used to fill behind the masonry.
It consisted of a platform mounted on wheels and of the same general construction as the derrick
platform. On the forward end of this platform a stationary hoist was mounted and behind this
a belt conveyor platform.

The latter structure was pivoted near the forward end so that it could swing right and left
on a circular track under its rear end. It carried a 30-cu. ft. hopper on its forward end,
from under which a belt conveyor ascended an incline toward the rear and was carried back into
the space behind the roof arch on a cantilever arm. In operating the back-filling machine the
material bucket was lifted from the car below, carried back on the trolley beam until over
the hopper and then dumped by hand into the hopper. From the hopper the material dropped onto
the conveyor belt and was carried back over the arch and dumped in place ready for tamping.
The trolley beam of the hoist was so arranged that the hoisting movement was vertical until
the bucket hit the trolley and was then up and backward until the stop at the end of the trolley
beam was reached. This point was directly over the hopper. Hoisting was done by a Lambert engine,
driven by a 15 H.P. electric motor. The conveyor belt was 20 ins. wide and was operated at
a speed of 180 ft. per minute by a 7½ H.P. electric motor. The machine required two men to
operate and was considered to save the labor of twelve shovelers.

~METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING SIDE WALLS IN RELINING THE MULLAN TUNNEL.~--The Mullan Tunnel, 3,850
ft. long, on the Northern Pacific Ry., about 20 miles west of Helena, Mont., had its original
timber lining replaced in 1894 with a lining consisting of concrete side walls and a brick
roof arch. The construction of the old and new linings is shown by Fig. 130. The method of
constructing the side walls was as follows:

The original timbering consisted of sets of 12×12-in. posts carrying five segment arches of
12×12-in. timbers joined by ½-in. dowels. For a portion of the lining the posts carried plates
on which the arches set; elsewhere the arches rested directly on the post tops. The arches
and posts carried 4-in. lagging filled behind with cordwood. The timber lining was removed
to make place for the new work in the manner shown by Fig. 130. When there were no plates a
7-ft. section AB was first prepared by removing one post and supporting the undermined arch
ribs by struts SS. The timbering in this section was cut out and excavation made for the wall
footing. Two temporary posts FF were then set up, fastened by hook bolts L and lagged behind
to make the wall form. Several of these 7-ft. sections were cut out at once, each two being
separated by a 5-ft. section of timbering. The mortar car shown in Fig. 130 was then run alongside
the sections in order and enough 1-3 mortar was run by chute into each to make an 8-in. layer.
As the car moved ahead to succeeding sections enough broken stone was shoveled into the last
preceding section to take up the mortar. The walls were thus built in 8-in. layers and became
hard enough to support the arches in from 10 to 14 days. The arches were then allowed to take
footing on the wall, and the posts of the remaining 5-ft. sections were removed and the concrete
wall built up as for the 7-ft. sections. Where the posts carried wall plates the struts SS
were not needed, the wall plate supporting the undermined post as a beam. English Portland
cement was used and the concrete mixture was about 4 parts mortar to 5 parts broken stone--a
very rich mixture. The average progress was about 30 ft., or 45 cu. yds. of side wall per working
day; the average cost of the walls, including everything, was $8 per cu. yd. of concrete. The
brick arch cost $17 per cu. yd. Mr. H. C. Relf is authority for these figures.

~METHOD AND COST OF LINING A SHORT TUNNEL, PEEKSKILL, N. Y.~--The following methods and costs
of lining a double track railway tunnel 275 ft. long near Peekskill, N.Y., are given by Mr.
Geo. W. Lee. In presenting these data it is important to note that while some of the methods
described are applicable to so short a tunnel they could not be used on a long tunnel. Figure
131 is a cross-section of the tunnel showing the lining. The tunnel was through rock, which
stood up without timbering, and the rock section was excavated from 6 ins. to 3 ft. outside
the lining. A 1-2-4 concrete using crusher run stone below 1 in. in size was used for the lining
and portal head wall coping and a 1-3-6 concrete for the portal head walls proper. The cost
of the portal head walls is included in the costs given further on.

The side wall foundation trenches were first excavated from 1 to 3 ft. deep and footing concreted
and leveled up, the back of the footing being carried up against the rock and the front lined
to forms giving a 12-in. offset to the side wall. The footings contained 200 cu. yds. of concrete.
Platforms 25 ft. square and level with the springing lines were then erected at each end of
the tunnel. A derrick was placed at each platform to handle skips between it and the material
tracks which ran underneath and through the tunnel with a turnout at each end for switching
back empty cars. A 60 H.P. portable boiler supplied steam for the derrick engines and a pump.
The wall forms were built and erected in panels 12 ft. long; these panels had 4×6-in. plates
and sills, 4×4-in. studs 3 ft. on centers and 2-in. dressed and matched spruce sheeting. Four
panels were set up, two on each side, midway of the tunnel and braced to the tunnel track.
Wheelbarrow runways carried on bents were built from the platforms to the forms, one from one
platform to one side, another from the other platform to the opposite side. Temporary bulkheads
were erected to close the ends of the forms and they were filled. Meanwhile carpenters were
setting other panels at each end of the two first erected on each side. After 24 hours the
panels first set were taken down and moved ahead and the processes described continued until
the full length of side wall was completed. The side walls were not concreted back to the rock;
back forms of 1-in. hemlock were used and the space remaining was filled with spalls. The side
walls contained 692 cu. yds. of concrete.

Arch forms were erected for 96 ft. at the center of the tunnel, using 12-ft. lagging, so that
sections of this length could be taken down and moved ahead, nine at each end. The lagging
was first laid to a height of 3 ft. above the springing line on each side and the concrete
dumped directly in place from runways laid on the lower chords of the arch ribs, which were
placed 4 ft. apart. When the concrete reached a height too great for direct discharge into
the forms it was dumped on the runway and passed over with shovels. On the upper portion of
the ring the concrete was first shoveled to a platform erected on the center posts of the ribs
about 2 ft. below the crown and then passed in on the lagging which was laid in 4-ft. instead
of 12-ft. lengths at this stage of the work. As soon as each section of arch ring was completed
it was waterproofed with six layers of tar paper laid in hot tar and then packed behind with
spalls. The arch centers were struck in a comparatively short time; in one instance they were
struck 90 hours after the last concrete was placed and no settlement was apparent. The arch
forms stuck so fast to the concrete, however, that they had to be jacked down by chiseling
out the lagging so as to get a bearing on the arch concrete and by nailing thrust blocks to
the rib posts. The section was then hauled ahead by passing the main fall of the derrick through
a snatch block on the first rib. When hauled clear of the lining all but the first 3-ft. of
lagging on each side was removed; they were then jacked into position. The arch ring contained
932 cu. yds. of concrete.

Including the portal head walls 1,948 cu. yds. of concrete were laid at the following costs
for labor and materials:

~METHOD OF LINING CASCADE TUNNEL, GREAT NORTHERN RY.~--The Cascade Tunnel, 13,813 ft. long,
built in 1897-1900, was lined throughout with concrete from 24 ins. to 3½ ft. thick, mixed
and placed in the following manner: It was necessary to place the lining without interfering
with the transportation of materials and excavated material to and from the work ahead. The
arrangement adopted to secure this end is shown by Fig. 132. A platform 500 ft. long was constructed
at the elevation of the wall plates; the rear end of this platform was reached by an incline,
up which the cars loaded with concrete were hauled by an air hoist and cable and delivered
to any point on this platform. While each 500 ft. of tunnel was being concreted, the next 500
ft. of platform in advance was being built, with its approach incline, so that there was no
delay in the work.

Complete concrete plants were installed at each portal, advantage being taken of the side hills
of the approach into the mountain to handle as much material as possible by gravity. Each plant
was equipped with a No. 6 Gates crusher, 40-in.×8-ft. rock screens, and 16-in.×16-ft. screw
concrete mixers. Large storage bins for the cement, sand and stone were built adjacent to the
mixer plant. A 1-3-5 concrete was used. The stone was crushed from the best rock obtained in
the tunnel excavation. This rock was loaded into the regular muck cars, taken to the portal
by electric motors, and then dumped into other cars below the level of the muck cars. These
cars were hauled by hoisting engine and cable to the crusher floor and then dumped and sorted
to avoid danger from pieces of unexploded dynamite. It was then run through the crushers, washers
and screens to the stone bin and thence to the mixers. The mixed concrete was discharged into
cars on the level of the muck car tracks and these cars were taken by motor into the tunnel
to the incline, up which they were hauled by cable and dumped on the platform. From the platform
the concrete was shoveled into the wall forms or onto the centers as desired.

The walls were concreted in alternate 12-ft. sections, the weight on the timber arch thus being
gradually transferred from the plumb posts to the walls. The roof arch was also built in 12-ft.
sections, the centers being in sections of corresponding length which were moved forward on
dollies and jacked up as the work advanced. Ten sections of centering were used at each end.
An average of 7 bbls. of cement were used per lineal foot of lining. The average monthly progress
of lining was about 600 ft. at each end. The concrete lining cost $44 per lin. ft. of tunnel,
done by company forces. This tunnel is 1,425.8 ft. long and when constructed in 1882 was lined
with timber. The new lining consists of concrete side walls carrying a brick roof arch. Both
the old and the new linings are shown in the drawings. The tunnel is through a variety of rock
and clay strata, and through the soft strata an invert was required. Altogether about one-third
of the length of the tunnel was provided with an invert. It will be noted also that the new
lining occupies materially more space than the old; this made necessary considerable excavation
in enlarging the section.

The work of relining consisted of three operations, viz., the invert construction, the construction
of the side walls and the arch construction.

The form of the invert is shown in Fig. 136. It, of course, had to be constructed without entailing
a break in the track, and the method adopted was as follows: The ties and ballast were removed
from a section of track about 12 ft. long and in their place was substituted the timber frame
shown in Fig. 133. Under the middle portion of this frame a trench reaching clear across the
tunnel and having a width of 6 to 7 ft. in the direction of the track was excavated to sub-grade
of the invert. The concrete was filled into this trench, formed to shape on top, and allowed
to harden. The bridging frame was then taken out and the ties and ballast were replaced. Another
section of track was then bridged, trenched and concreted and so on until the length of invert
required was constructed.

The side wall construction was a more complex operation. It comprised first the removal of
the old lining, the enlarging excavation and the form erection and concreting. Two methods
of performing this task were employed. Both are illustrated in Fig. 134. By the first method,
designated as Plan A, the concreting was done continuously in sections of considerable length.
The forms used are shown in detail by Fig. 135. By the second method, the concreting was done
in alternate short panels. This method is designated Plan B on the drawings, Fig. 134. The
forms used are shown in detail by Fig. 135. The only difference in the form construction for
the two plans is in the connection of the posts at the top.

The construction of the centering for the roof arch is shown by Figs. 136 and 137, Fig. 137
giving detail dimensions of the ribs and lagging. The center, as shown by Fig. 136, consisted
of four ribs spaced 3 ft. on centers. Each rib consists of two side posts and an arch piece.
The side posts on each side are connected at the bottoms by a sill and at the top by a cap.
Jacks between the sill and a mud sill laid on the concrete invert or in the ditch held the
center in place during arch construction. Lowering these jacks dropped the center onto trucks
traveling on the mud sills. Thus the center was moved along as the work progressed. As will
be noted from Figs. 134 and 135, the side wall forms carried the work only to the bottoms of
the old caps. The arch center completed the concrete wall work and the roof arch. Only about
one-third of the new lining had the brick arch, as shown by the drawings; in the remaining
two-thirds the concrete was carried up much further on each side; in fact, the brickwork constituted
only the top third of the arch.

In describing the forms and centers we have left much of the explanation to the drawings. These
show all dimensions and details, and indicate in a measure the mode of procedure. The work
done consisted of excavation enlarging the section, of removing the old timber lining and of
the form work, concreting and bricklaying for the new lining. All of it above convenient reach
from the ground was done from a movable staging formed by a deck fixed on a flat car so as
to be adjustable in height. The concrete was mixed by hand on this car platform and shoveled
directly into the forms, the platform being raised as the work increased in height. The concrete
used was a 1-3-5 mixture of 2½-in. broken stone.

The organization of the working force is not easily stated since the work was done as the traffic
permitted and varied with the conditions. Generally from 12 to 16 men were all that could be
employed to advantage. Complete records of cost were kept, but they were destroyed by fire,
so that the only figures available on this point are the totals. These are as follows:

  Item.               Totals.     Per lin. ft.
Labor                $21,129        $14.81
Materials             13,939          9.77
                      -------      -------
      Total          $35,068        $24.58

These amounts average the cost of the invert, which was required for about one-third of the
length, over the whole tunnel.

~RELINING A SHORT TUNNEL.~--The following figures show the cost of relining with concrete a
timber lined railway tunnel. The concrete side walls were 14 ft. high and had an average thickness
of 2½ ft. Therefore each side wall averaged nearly 1.3 cu. yds. per lin. ft., and the two walls
averaged 2.59 cu. yds. per lin. ft. of tunnel. The concrete was mixed 1-3-5, being, we believe,
unnecessarily rich in cement. The average amount of concrete placed in the walls per day was
50 cu. yds.

In the two side walls there were 2.59 cu. yds. of concrete per lin. ft. of tunnel, hence the
cost of the side walls was $6.04 × $2.59 = $15.64 per lin. ft. of tunnel. The concrete arch
varied in thickness, averaging from 14 to 20 ins. at the springing line to 8 to 14 ins. at
the crown. The arch averaged 1.2 cu. yds. per lin. ft. of tunnel. About 20 cu. yds. of arch
were placed per day. The arch concrete was mixed 1-3-5 and the cost was as follows:

Summing up, we have the following as the cost per lineal foot for lining this single-track
tunnel with concrete: Per lin. ft.

It should be remembered that the higher cost of the arch concrete is due in large measure to
the fact that 1.8 cu. yds. of dry rock packing above the arch are included in the cost of the
concrete. Strictly speaking, this dry rock packing should not be charged against the arch concrete,
and, segregating it, we have the following:

                                                  Per lin. ft.

     Total                                              $28.04

This is a much more rational analysis of the cost and a still further reduction in the cost
of the arch concrete might be made by prorating the train service item ($1.50 per cu. yd. concrete).
At least half of this train service should be charged to the dry rock backing, for there are
1.25 cu. yds. of sand and broken stone to 1.80 cu. yds. of dry rock backing.

The amount of this dry rock backing, or packing, varies greatly in different parts of a tunnel.
In the first half of this tunnel it averaged 1.8 cu. yds. per lin. ft., while in the second
half it averaged nearly 2.4 cu. yds. per lin. ft.

~METHOD OF MIXING AND PLACING CONCRETE FOR A TUNNEL LINING.~--The tunnel known as the Burton
tunnel is located on the Jasper-French Lick extension of the Southern Ry., and about 4 miles
from French Lick, Ind. It is a single track tunnel 2,200 ft. long with 300 ft. at one end on
a 4°-30' curve and 1,900 ft. on tangent. The material penetrated was slate and loose rock,
requiring solid timbering throughout. This timbering is shown by Fig. 138, which also shows
the concrete lining; the timbering was embedded in the concrete lining.

The original timber lining was composed as follows: Posts 10×12 ins. and spaced 3 ft. apart
were set on 3×12-in. sills and carried 10×12-in. wall plates which supported 10×12-in. segmental
arch ribs spaced 3 ft. apart. The lagging behind the posts was 3×6-in. stuff and the lagging
over the arch ribs was 4×6-in. stuff. The section of the concrete lining is shown by Fig. 138,
it required 4,132 cu. yds. of concrete and 161.43 lbs. of reinforcement per lin. ft. The concrete
was a 1-2½-5 crushed stone--between 2 in. and ¼ in. size--mixture; it required 1.16 bbls. of
cement, 0.52 cu. yds. sand and 0.92 cu. yds. of stone per cubic yard of concrete. The amount
of reinforcement per cubic yard of concrete was 39.1 lbs.

All the concrete was mixed and handled from one end of the tunnel. The mixing plant was located
in the approach cut at one end. A standard gage main track ran through the cut. About 20 ft.
in the clear to one side of this track a trestle 500 ft. long was built, carrying an 18-ft.
gage derrick track and a narrow gage 3-cu. yd. dump car track. A stiff leg derrick operating
a 1 cu. yd. orange peel or a 1½ cu. yd. clam-shell Hayward bucket was mounted on a carriage
traveling on the 18-ft. gage track. The side of the trestle nearest the railway track was sheeted
vertically and the space between this sheeting and the track was floored over at track level
for stock piles. Near the end of the trestle toward the tunnel and on the same side of the
track was the mixer plant. This consisted of two 85 cu. yd. bins, one for sand and one for
stone, carried by a tower so that their bottoms were 25 ft. above track level. Below the bins
was a charging platform pierced by a measuring hopper. Below the measuring hopper was a 1½
cu. yd. cubical mixer and below the mixer was a 3-ft. gage track for 1½ cu. yd. Koppel side
dump cars. To the rear of the tower at ground level there was a 20-cu. yd. sand bin and a 20-cu.
yd. stone bin set side by side with a continuous bucket elevator leading from each to the corresponding
bin on the tower. The cement house was located directly across the railway track from the tower.
At the side of the cement house nearest the track there was an inclined bag elevator leading
up to a bridge spanning the railway track at the level of the charging floor of the mixer plant.
On this bridge ran a car for carrying bags of cement. The plant as described is shown by Figs.
139 and 140.

In operation the derrick unloaded the stone and sand cars by means of the Hayward buckets either
into the bins at the feet of the bucket elevators or onto stock piles on the flooring beside
the trestle. When put into stock piles the materials had to be reloaded by derrick into the
3 cu. yd. cars on the trestle narrow gage track and carried by these cars to the elevator boots.
The sand and stone were chuted from the tower bins directly into the charging hopper below.
Here the cement bags, brought across the bridge on the car into which they were loaded directly
by the bag elevator, were opened and the cement added to the sand and stone. The charge was
then dropped into the mixer and from the mixer the batch dropped into the Koppel concrete cars.

In the tunnel a traveling platform was constructed on two standard gage flat cars so coupled
that a platform 100 ft. long and slightly narrower than the clear space between side wall forms
was obtained. Connecting the end of the platform toward the mixing plant was a rampe or inclined
platform mounted on wheels. The Koppel car tracks from the mixer were carried up the incline
and the full length of the level platform. The cars were hauled to the foot of the incline
by a light locomotive. A cable was then hooked to them; this cable was run through a block
on the level platform, its free end coming back to the locomotive, which thus pulled the cars
up the incline by moving back toward the mixer. On the level platform the cars were pushed
by hand and dumped on the floor, whence the concrete was shoveled into the forms.

The platform construction deserves mention in the particular that it provided for adjusting
the platform vertically. At each corner of the car a vertical post some 7 or 8 ft. high was
set up. The side stringers of the platform carried two vertical posts at each end; these two
posts were spaced just far enough apart to slide over the corner post, one on each side of
it. A block at the top of the corner posts with the hoist line connected to the bottoms of
the platform posts and the lead line going to a winch head, thus made it possible to lift the
platform any distance within the height of the vertical post guide and hold it there by blocking
under the posts. The arrangement is shown roughly by the sketch, Fig. 141. There was block
and tackle for each corner post and a winch at each end of the car. The vertical movement of
the platform was between 6 and 7 ft.

The floor was cemented first, then the side walls and finally the roof arch. Floor construction
was begun at the portal farthest from the mixing plant. Koppel car tracks were laid through
the tunnel and the concrete was dumped from them directly on the ground. The cars were hauled
by a light locomotive. As the concreting advanced the dump car track was raised and suspended
from timbers across tunnel so that the concrete could be placed under it. As fast as the floor
hardened the permanent standard gage track was laid and a temporary third rail placed to give
also a dump car track.

When the floor had been finished the side walls were constructed, using the traveling platform
and beginning at the far portal. The wall forms consisted of 4×6-in. studs, spaced 3 ft. apart
and carrying 2×12-in. lagging. A 6×6-in. waling outside the studs at about mid-height held
the studs to the timbering by lag bolts reaching through the wall to the 10×12-in. posts. A
strip of plank nailed across wall between stud and post held the form at the top. Wall forms
were erected for 100 ft. of wall at a time. These forms required about 45 ft. B. M. lumber
per lineal foot of form on one side or 90 ft. B. M. for both sides. Two sets of side wall forms
or 200 ft. of wall forming were built, and used over and over again. The concrete was shoveled
into the wall forms from the traveling platform, the lagging being placed a board at a time
as the work progressed upward and the platform being elevated as required, its final position
being at about springing line level. When 100 ft. of side walls had been completed the traveling
platform was moved ahead for another 100-ft. section.

The centers consisted of 6×12-in. ribs, made up of 3×12-in. plank. The feet of the ribs rested
on folding wedges on 6×12-in. wall plates, supported by 6×6-in. posts setting close against
the finished wall. The ends of the ribs were held from closing in by 6×6-in. walings, one on
each side, lag-bolted through the lining to the timbering. The centering required about 315
ft. B. M. of lumber per lineal foot of center. The method of removing the centers was novel.
A flat car had erected on it a narrow working platform high enough to reach well up into the
arch. Along this platform at the center was erected a sort of "horse," which could be elevated
and lowered by jacks. The sketch, Fig. 142, shows the arrangement. At each end and at the middle
of the platform two guide posts a a were erected and braced upright. Between these guide posts
set plunger posts which were raised and lowered by screw jacks. The three plunger posts carried
a longitudinal timber c. The car was run under the ribs of centering to be removed and the
timber c raised by working the jacks until it came to close bearing under the ribs d. The railings
and the wedges at the foot of the ribs were then removed, leaving the ribs hanging on the timber
c. This timber was then jacked down to clear the lining and the ribs rotated horizontally on
the point of suspension as a pivot until their ends swung in over the platform. The car was
then moved ahead to where the centers were to be used again; the ribs were rotated back to
their normal position across tunnel; the timber c was jacked up, and the wedges and railings
placed at the first of the ribs.

The concreting on the roof arch was begun at the portal. Two shifts were worked and 42 ft.
of arch were concreted each shift.

~METHOD AND COST OF LINING GUNNISON TUNNEL.~--The costs are for concrete in place in the side
walls and the arch of the tunnel, for a length of 440 lin. ft. The quantity of concrete considered
in estimating the cost per cubic yard was 616 cu. yds. The material was mixed and placed in
½ cu. yd. batches, the proportion of the mixtures being 1-2.2-4.4. The final cost includes
the labor of excavating and screening gravel and sand, the hauling of the same from the bins
at the pit to the storage bins at the main shaft, the care of the chutes in the shaft and the
mixing of the concrete in the tunnel at the bottom of the shaft, the transportation of the
concrete from the mixer to the traveler, the deposition of the concrete, the setting up and
taking down of forms and the cost of the cement. It does not include the construction of the
gravel pit chutes that hold the screens, the building of the road from the gravel pit to the
storage bins at the shaft, the concrete mixer and its installation, the traveler and its installation,
the cost of material and labor in the construction of the concrete forms, the requisite power
to run the machinery and other expenses of a similar nature.

The gravel used for the concrete was obtained from a pit situated on top of a hill not far
from the main shaft leading down to the tunnel. This gravel bed contains very closely the proper
proportions of sand and gravel for the concrete aggregates. The gravel was excavated and loaded
by hand into side dump cars of 35 cu. ft. capacity. These cars were run to the edge of the
hill where the gravel was dumped upon a screen from which it ran by gravity, passing thence
into storage bins. From the storage bins the sand and gravel were drawn off into dump wagons
having a capacity of 2 cu. yds. and hauled a distance of one-half mile to a second set of storage
bins located at the top of the shaft leading into the tunnel. The road from the storage bins
at the gravel pit to the storage bins at the head of the shaft was down grade. A two-horse
team could readily haul 2 cu. yds. of gravel over this road. The storage bins at the top of
the shaft leading into the tunnel communicated with the measuring boxes at the bottom of the
shaft by means of chutes. The measuring boxes discharged directly into tram cars. The average
length of haul from the mixer to the place of deposition of concrete was about 4,500 ft.

The concrete was placed in the side walls by means of a traveler, which was so operated in
the tunnel as to allow the passage of the concrete trains beneath it. The traveler was 64 ft.
long and was provided with a slow motion electric hoist, by which the cars containing the concrete
were elevated to the top of the traveler and thence transferred to any desired position. The
concrete was dumped from these cars into boxes where any remixing or tempering that was required
was done, after which the concrete was shoveled directly into the forms. The entire operation
of handling the materials of the concrete, it will be seen, utilized gravity to the greatest
possible degree.

In order to get a good average cost per cubic yard for handling gravel and sand, this analysis
has been based on five months' operation, from November, 1906, to March, 1907. In these five
months there were 4,123 cu. yds. of sand and gravel handled. The concrete considered was placed
during the month of March. Below is given the distribution of the cost of the concrete as to
the specified divisions of the work and as to the class of work involved in each division.
Measurements taken at the mixer show that each cubic yard of concrete contained 0.74 cu. yds.
of gravel, 0.445 cu yds. of sand and 5.6 sacks of Portland cement. The total of the aggregates
is, therefore, 1.185 cu. yds. per cubic yard of concrete. The cement costs $0.62 per sack on
the work, making a cost of $3.472 per cubic yard of concrete.

As there were 1.185 cu. yds. of gravel per cubic yard of concrete the cost of gravel per cubic
yard of concrete was for--

Excavating and screening (1.185 × $0.355)                      $0.421

Adding to this the cost of cement $0.62 × 5.6 = $3.472, we have $0.644 + $3.472 = $4.116, as
the cost of concrete materials per cubic yard of concrete. The cost of labor, mixing and placing
was as follows for 616 cu. yds.:

~COST OF CONCRETE WORK IN LINING NEW YORK RAPID TRANSIT SUBWAY.~--The costs given here refer
alone to the concrete work in constructing the jack arch and steel beam lining of the original
standard subway. Figure 143 shows the character of this construction. Arch panel forms were
set up between the wall beams and hung from the floor beams and filled behind and above with
1-2-4 trap rock concrete. The form panels were used over and over and the concrete was machine
mixed. Common labor was paid $1.50 per 8-hour day; foremen, $3; carpenters, $3; enginemen,
$3.50; and masons, $4. The costs cover three sections and are in each case the averages for
the whole section. They are, we believe, the only itemized costs that have been published for
concrete work on this road.

Two-Track Subway.--In this section of two-track subway there were 8,827 cu. yds. of foundation
concrete and 6,664 cu. yds. of concrete in wall and roof arches. The two classes of work cost
as follows:

~TRAVELING FORMS FOR LINING NEW YORK RAPID TRANSIT RY. TUNNELS.~--In constructing the tunnels
under Park Ave. and under the north end of Central Park for the New York Rapid Transit Ry.,
traveling centers and side wall forms were used for the concrete lining. The mixing plants
were installed in the shafts and consisted generally of gravity mixers charged at the surface
and discharging into skip cars running on the tunnel floor.

The forms used in the Park Ave. tunnel are shown by Figs. 144 and 145; those used in the Central
Park tunnel differed only in details. The method of work was slightly different in the two
tunnels, but was substantially as follows: Three platforms mounted on wheels were used in each
set and two sets were employed. Ahead came a traveler carrying the side wall forms, next came
a shorter traveler carrying a derrick, and last came the traveler carrying the roof centers.
The arrangement as operated in the Central Park tunnel is shown by Fig. 146. In the Park Ave.
tunnel the "bridges" were dispensed with, the skips being hoisted through the open end bays
of the derrick car and set directly on the cars on the center traveler.

The traveler carrying the side wall forms was set in position and blocked, the grade and line
being given by the track rails, which had been set exactly for that purpose. The side wall
forms differed slightly in the two tunnels; those for the Park Ave. tunnel shown by Fig. 144
formed the vertical portion of the wall only so that when the arch forms, Fig. 145, followed
a space A B was left which had to be molded by separate sector-like forms. The side wall forms
for the Central Park work were constructed as shown by Fig. 147, being curved at the top to
merge into the arch centers. In the Park Ave. work the wall studs were adjusted in or out by
means of wedges and slotted bolt holes. In the Central Park work the studs A Fig. 145 were
hung by ¾-in. bolts from the pieces B spiked to line onto the cross-braces. The bottom was
then lined up by means of wedges at D. The side wall studs being lined up, the bottom lagging
boards were placed and filled behind by shoveling the concrete into them direct from skip cars
on the adjacent tracks on the tunnel floor. In this way the side walls were built up to the
tops of the forms.

As soon as the side wall concrete had set the forms were struck and the traveler was moved
ahead and set for another section of wall. The derrick and roof arch travelers were then moved
into position between the finished walls, and the arch traveler was jacked up and aligned.
Skip cars coming from the mixer were run under the derrick traveler, where the skips were lifted
by the derrick and set on the platform cars to be run alongside the work. The arch lagging
was placed a piece at a time and filled behind by shoveling direct from the skips. As the crown
was approached the lagging was placed in short lengths and filled in over the ends, the concrete
being shoveled in two lifts; in Fig. 145 the line C D indicates the position of the shoveling
board. The centers were struck by lowering the jack supported traveler down onto the track rails.

~COST OF MIXING AND PLACING SUBWAY LINING, LONG ISLAND R. R., BROOKLYN, N. Y.~--The subway
carrying the two tracks of the Long Island R. R. under Atlantic Ave., in Brooklyn, New York
city, has a lining consisting of an invert arch 12 ins. thick at the center, side walls 4½
ft. thick at the base and 3 ft. thick at the top, and a roof of jack arches between steel I-beams
5 ft. apart. The dimensions inside the concrete are 16×20 ft. A 1-8 mixture of cement, sand,
gravel and stone was used in the floor and walls and a 1-6 mixture of the same materials in
the jack arches. A bag of cement was called 1 cu. ft., so that a barrel was 4 cu. ft. A Hains
gravity mixer and a batch mixer were used and careful records were kept of all quantities.

General Data.--During 1903, about 13,880 cu. yds. of the 1-8 concrete were placed, 90 per cent.
of which was mixed in the gravity mixer and 10 per cent. in the batch mixer. Of the 1-6 concrete
5,320 cu. yds. were placed, 85 per cent, of which was mixed in the gravity mixer and 15 per
cent, in the batch mixer.

Gravity Mixer Work.--During 1903, there were 16,940 cu. yds. of concrete mixed in gravity mixers,
requiring 2,860 days' labor mixing and 4,000 days' labor placing. Wages were $1.50 a day and
the cost was 26 cts. per cu. yd. for mixing and 33 cts. for placing, making a total of 59 cts.
per cu. yd. During the month of August when 2,800 cu. yds. were mixed the cost was as low as
24 cts. for mixing, plus 22 cts. for placing, or a total of 46 cts. per cu. yd. for mixing
and placing. The mixer averaged about 113 cu. yds. per day with a gang of 19 men mixing and
26 men placing. The average size of batch was 0.46 cu. yd. In 1904, 20,000 cu. yds. were mixed
in 190 days, worked with a gang of 19 men mixing; the gang placing consisted of 25 men. The
cost was as follows:

  Item.                            Total.  Per cu. yd.
2,950 days labor mixing          $ 4,870       24 cts.
4,760 days labor placing           7,300       36 cts.
                               ---------      --------
      Total                      $12,170       60 cts.

During the best month of 1904, the labor cost was 16 cts. for mixing and 29 cts. for placing,
or a total of 45 cts. per cu. yd.

Batch Mixer Work.--During 1903 the batch mixer mixed 2,390 cu. yds. in 970 labor days mixing
and 740 labor days placing at a cost of 59 cts. per cu. yd. for mixing and 55 cts. per cu.
yd. for placing, or a total of $1.04 per cu. yd. During the month of June the cost was as low
as 40 cts. for mixing and 30 cts. for placing, or 70 cts. per cu. yd. for mixing and placing.
The wages paid were $1.50 per day and the average gangs were 11 men mixing and 14 men placing;
the average batch mixed was 0.57 cu. yd. and the average output was 35 cu. yds. per day. During
1904, the mixer worked 153 days and averaged 46 cu. yds. per day; the average size of batch
was 0.44 cu. yd. The average gangs were 13 men mixing and 11 men placing. The labor cost of
7,000 cu. yds. was as follows:

  Item.                             Total.    Per cu. yd.
1,910 days labor mixing            $3,175       45 cts.
1,740 days labor placing            2,660       38 cts.
                                  -------      --------
       Total                       $5,835       83 cts.

Haulage.--The costs given comprise in mixing, the cost of delivering the materials to the mixer,
and, in placing, the cost of hauling the concrete away. A Robins belt conveyor was used to
deliver materials to the gravity mixer and this accounts, in a large measure, for the lower
cost of mixing by gravity. The mixed concrete was hauled from both mixers in dump cars pushed
by men.

Form Work.--The labor cost of forms for 19,300 cu. yds. of concrete placed in 1903 was $16,800,
or 87 cts. per cu. yd. of concrete. The total labor days consumed on form work was 6,340 at
$2.70 per day. The total cost of concrete in place for mixing, placing and form work was $1.46
per cu. yd., not including lumber in forms, fuel, interest and depreciation.

The construction problems in arch and girder bridges of moderate spans are simple, and with
the exception of center construction and arrangement of plant for making and placing concrete,
are best explained by citing specific examples of bridge work. This is the arrangement followed
in this chapter.

~CENTERS.~--The construction of centers is no less important a task for concrete arches than
for stone arches. This means that success in the construction of concrete arches depends quite
as much upon the sufficiency of the center construction as it does upon any other portion of
the work. The center must, in a word, remain as nearly as possible invariable in level and
form from the time it is made ready for the concrete until the time it is removed from underneath
the arch, and, when the time for removal comes, the construction must be such that that operation
can be performed with ease and without shock or jar to the masonry. The problem of center construction
is thus the two-fold one of building a structure which is immovable until movement is desired
and then moves at will. Incidentally these requisites must be obtained with the least combined
expenditure for materials, framing, erection and removal, and with the greatest salvage of
useful material when the work is over. The factors to be taken count of are it, will be seen,
numerous and may exist in innumerable combinations.

Centers may be classified into two types: (1). Centers whose supports must be arranged so as
to leave a clear opening under the center for passing craft or other purposes, and (2) centers
whose supports can be arranged in any way that judgment and economy dictate. Centers of the
first class are commonly called cocket centers. As examples of a cocket and of a supported
center and also as examples of well thought out center design we give the two centers shown
by Figs. 148 and 149, both designed for a 50-ft. span segmental arch by the same engineer.
The development of the center shown by Fig. 148 into the cocket center shown by Fig. 149 is
plainly traceable from the drawings. In respect to the center shown by Fig. 149 which was the
construction actually adopted we are informed that 16,464 ft. B. M. were required for a center
36 ft. long, that the framing cost about $12 per M. ft. B. M., with carpenters' wages at $4
per day, and that the cost of bolts and nuts was about $1.50 per M. ft. B. M. With lumber at
$20 per M. ft. B. M., this center framed and erected would cost about $35 per M. ft. B. M.
As an example of framed centers for larger spans we show by Fig. 158 the centers for the Connecticut
Avenue Bridge at Washington, D. C., with costs and quantities; other references to costs are
contained in the index.

A center of very economical construction is shown by Fig. 159, and is described in detail in
the accompanying text. The distinctive feature of this center is the use of lagging laid lengthwise
of the arch and bent to curve. Another example of this form of construction may be found in
a 3-span arch bridge built at Mechanicsville, N. Y., in 1903. The viaduct was 17 ft. wide over
all, and consisted of two 100-ft. spans and one 50-ft. span. Pile bents were driven to bed
rock, the piles being spaced 6 ft. apart and the bents 10 ft. apart. Each bent was capped with
10×12-in. timber. On these caps were laid four lines of 10×12-in. stringers, and 8×10-in. posts
3 ft. apart were erected on these stringers, and each set of four posts across the arch was
capped with 8×10-in timbers the ends of which projected 3 ft. beyond the faces of the arch.
The tops of these cross caps were beveled to receive the lagging which was put on parallel
with the center line of the viaduct, sprung down and nailed to the caps. This lagging consisted
of rough 1-in. boards for a lower course, on top of which was laid 1-in. boards dressed on
the upper sides. Hardwood wedges were used under the posts for removing the centers. In the
centers, forms and braces for the three arches there were used 140,000 ft. B. M. of lumber.
The structure contained 2,500 cu. yds. of concrete.

Another type of center that merits consideration in many places is one developed by Mr. Daniel
B. Luten and used by him in the construction of many arches of the Luten type of reinforced
concrete arch. The particular feature of this type of arch is that in shallow streams for bridges
of ordinary span the ends of the arch ring are tied together across stream by a slab of concrete
reinforced to take tension. This slab is intended to serve the double purpose of a tie to keep
the arch from spreading and thus reduce the weight of abutments and of a pavement preventing
scour and its tendency to undermine the abutments. Incidentally this concrete slab, which is
built first, serves as a footing for the supports carrying the arch center.

As an illustration of the center we choose a specific structure. In building a 95-ft. span,
11-ft. 1-in. rise arch bridge at Yorktown, Ind., in 1905, the centers were designed so as to
avoid the use of sand boxes or wedges. Ribs of 2×12-in. pieces cut to the arc of the arch soffit
were supported on uprights standing on the concrete stream bed pavement. The uprights were
so proportioned by Gordon's formula for columns that without bracing they would be too light
to support the load of concrete and earth filling that was to come upon them, but when braced
at two points dividing the uprights approximately into thirds they would support their loading
rigidly and without buckling. The design in detail was as follows: The uprights near the middle
of the span were about 15 ft. long and were spaced 7 ft. apart across the stream and 3 ft.
apart across the bridge. Each upright then was to support a loading of concrete of 7 ft.×3
ft.×26 ins. and an earth fill 1 ft.×7 ft.×3 ft., or a total load of about 9,000 lbs. Applying
Gordon's formula for struts with free ends,

                f S
     P = -------------------
                  l²
           I + --------
                 125h²

where P is the total load = 9,000 lbs., f is fibre stress for oak--1,600 lbs., l is length
of strut in inches and h is least diameter of strut in inches, it was found that for a length
of 15 ft. a 7×7-in. upright would be required to satisfy the formula, but for a length of 5
ft., which would result from bracing each strut at two points, a 4×4-in. timber satisfied the
formula. Therefore, 4×4-in. timbers braced at two points were used for the longest uprights.
About 30 days after the completion of the arch the bracing was removed from the uprights, beginning
at the ends of the span and working towards the middle. As the bracing was being removed the
uprights gradually yielded, buckling from 4 to 6 ins. from the vertical and allowing the arch
to settle about ¼ in. at the crown. This type of center has been successfully employed in a
large number of bridges.

Figure 150 shows a center for a 125-ft. span parabolic arch with the amount and character of
the stresses indicated and with a diagram of the actual deflections as measured during the work.

In calculating centers of moderate span there is seldom need of more than the simple formulas
and tables given in Chapter IX. When the spans become larger, and particularly when they become
very large--over 200 ft.--the problem of calculating centers becomes complex. None but an engineer
familiar with statics and the strengths of materials and knowing the efficiency of structural
details should be considered for such a task. Such computations are not within the intended
scope of this book, and the design of large centers will be passed with the presentation of
a single example, the center for the Walnut Lane Bridge at Philadelphia, Pa.

The main arch span of the Walnut Lane Bridge consists of twin arches spaced some 16 ft. apart
at the crowns and connected across by the floor. Each of the twin arch rings has a span of
232 ft. and a rise of 70¼ ft., is 9½ ft. thick and 21½ ft. wide at the skewback and 5½ ft.
thick and 18 ft. wide at the crown. The plan was to build a center complete for one arch ring
and then to shift it along and re-use it for building the other arch ring. The centering used
is shown in diagram by Fig. 151. It consists of five parts: (1) Six concrete piers running
the full width of the bridge upon which the structure was moved; (2) a steel framework up to
E G, called the "primary bent"; (3) a separate timber portion below the heavy lines E I and
W' I'; (4) the "main staging" included in the trapezoid E I W' I', and (5) the "upper trestle"
extending from I I' to the intrados.

The primary bent consists of four I-beam post bents having channel chords, the whole braced
together rigidly by angles. Each bent is carried on 1½ ft.×6 in. steel rollers running on a
track of 19×½ in. plate on top of the concrete piers. Between the primary bents and the main
staging, and also between the main staging and the upper trestles are lifting devices. The
mode of operation planned is as follows: When the center has been erected as shown and the
arch ring concreted the separate stagings under K I and K' I' are taken down. Next the portions
under the lines I E and I' W' will be taken down and erected under the second arch. Finally
the remainder of the center will be shifted sidewise on the rollers to position under the second
arch.

~MIXING AND TRANSPORTING CONCRETE.~--The nature of the plant for mixing and handling the concrete
in bridge work will vary not only with varying local conditions but with the size and length
of the bridge. For single span structures of moderate size the concrete can be handled directly
by derricks or on runways by carts and wheelbarrows. For bridges of several spans the accepted
methods of transport are cableways, cars and cars and derricks. Typical examples of each type
of plant are given in the following paragraphs, and also in the succeeding descriptions of
the Connecticut Avenue Bridge at Washington, D. C., and of a five-span arch bridge.

~Cableway Plants.~--The bridge was 710 ft. long between abutments and 62 ft. wide; it had a
center span of 110 ft., flanked on each side by a 100-ft., a 90-ft. and an 80-ft. span. The
mixing plant was located at one end of the bridge and consisted of a Drake continuous mixer,
discharging one-half at the mixer and one-half by belt conveyor to a point 50 ft. away, so
as to supply the buckets of two parallel cableways. The mixer output per 10-hour day was 400
cu. yds. and the mixing plant was operated at a cost of $27 per day, making the cost of mixing
alone 6¾ cts. per cu. yd. The sand and gravel were excavated from a pit 4½ miles away and delivered
by electric cars to the bridge site at a cost of 50 cts. per cu. yd. Two 930-ft. span Lambert
cableways set parallel with the bridge, one 25 ft. each side of the center axis, were used
to deliver the concrete from mixer to forms. The cableway towers were 70 ft. high and the cables
had a deflection of 35 ft.; they were designed for a load of 7 tons, but the average load carried
was only 3 or 4 tons. These cableways handled practically all the materials used in the construction
of the bridge. They delivered from mixer to the work 400 cu. yds. of concrete 450 ft. in 10
hours at a cost of 2 cts. per cu. yd. for operation.

Another example of cableway arrangement for concreting bridge piers is shown by Fig. 151a.
The river was about 800 ft. wide, about 3 ft. deep and had banks about 20 ft. high. The piers
were about 21 ft. high. The towers for the cableway consisted of a 55-ft. derrick without boom,
placed near the bank on the center line of the piers and well guyed and a two-leg bent placed
in the middle of the river and held in place by four cable guys anchored to the river bottom.
A ¾-in. steel hoisting cable was stretched from a deadman on shore, about 150 ft. back of the
derrick, and followed along the center line of the piers, past the derrick just clearing it,
to the bent in the middle of the river. At the top of this bent was a 16-in. cable block. Through
this block the cable passed down and was made fast to a weight, consisting of a skip loaded
with concrete until the cable had the required tension, and a pitch of 18 to 20 ft. from center
of river to anchor on shore. In order to secure the required pitch from the shore to the river
bent the boom fall of the derrick was hooked onto the cable at the foot of the mast, and then,
by going ahead on the single drum hoisting engine, was raised to the mast head. This gave the
cable a pitch of 18 to 20 ft. from mast head to top of bent in river. The carriage vised on
the cableway consisted of two 16-in. cable sheaves with iron straps, forming a triangle, with
a chain hanging from the bottom point, to which was attached the 5 cu. ft. capacity concrete
bucket. The concrete was mixed on a platform at the foot of the mast. When ready for operation
the chain on the carrier was hooked to the bucket of concrete, the engine started, and both
bucket and cable raised, the former running by gravity to the pier. The speed of descent was
governed by the height to which the cable was raised on the derrick, and as the bucket neared
the dumping point the engine was slacked off and the cable leveled. The bucket was dumped by
a man on a staging erected on the pier form. For the return of the bucket the engine was slacked
off and the weight on the river bent would pull the cable tight so that the pitch would be
toward the shore and the bucket could run down the grade to the mixing platform, the speed
being governed as before by leveling the cable. When the piers were completed to the middle
of the river the engine and derrick were taken over to opposite side of the river, the bent
being left in the middle, and the work continued. By using the extreme grade of the cable it
was found that the bucket would run from the platform to the bent (400 ft.) in less than 35
seconds.

~Car Plant for 4-Span Arch Bridge.~--The bridge had four 110-ft. skew spans, and a total length
of 554 ft. The mixing plant was located alongside one abutment on a side hill so that sand
and stone could be stored on the slope above. The mixer was set on a platform high enough to
clear cars below. Above it and to the rear a charging platform reached back to the stone and
sand piles. Side dump cars running on a track on the charging platform took sand and stone
to the mixer and cement was got from a cement house at charging platform level. The concrete
for the abutment adjacent to the mixer was handled in buckets by a guy derrick. A trestle,
Fig. 152, was then built out from the mixer to the first pier; this trestle was so located
as to clear the future bridge about 20 ft. and was carried out from shore parallel to the bridge
until nearly opposite the pier site, where it was swung toward and across the pier. The concrete
was received from the mixer in bottom dump push cars; these cars were run out over the pier
site and dumped. When the first pier had been concreted to springing line level, the main trestle
was extended to opposite the second pier and the branch track was removed from over the first
pier and placed over the second pier. This operation was repeated for the third pier. The last
extension of the main track was to the far shore abutment, where the bodies of the cars were
hoisted by derrick and dumped into the abutment forms. The derrick was the same one used for
the first abutment having been moved and set up during the construction of the intermediate
piers. To construct the arches a second trestle was built composed partly of new work and partly
of the staging for the arch centers. This trestle rose on an incline from the mixer to the
first pier across which it was carried at approximately crown level of the arch. The concrete
for the portion of the pier above springing line and for the lower portions of the haunches
was dumped direct from the cars. For the upper parts of the arch the concrete was brought to
the pier track in two-wheel carts on push cars and thence these carts were taken along the
arch toward shore on runways. When the first arch had been concreted the second trestle was
extended to pier two and the operation repeated to concrete the second arch.

~Hoist and Car Plant for 21-Span Arch Viaduct.~--The double track concrete viaduct replaced
a single track steel viaduct, being built around and embedding the original steel structure
which was maintained in service. The concrete viaduct consisted of 21 spans of 26 ft., 7 spans
of 16 ft., and 2 spans of 22 ft. With piers it required about 15,000 cu. yds. of concrete.
Two Ransome concrete hoists, one on each side of the original steel structure near one end,
were supplied with concrete by a No. 4 Ransome mixer. The mixer discharged direct into the
bucket of one hoist and by means of a shuttle car and chute into the bucket of the other hoist.

The shuttle car ran from the mixer up an incline laid with two tracks, one narrow gage and
one wide gage, having the same center line. The car was open at the front end and its two rear
wheels rode on the broad gage rails and its two forward wheels rode on the narrow gage rails.
At the top of the incline the narrow gage rails pitched sharply below the grade of the broad
gage rails so that the rear end of the car was tilted up enough to pour the concrete into a
chute which led to the bucket of the hoist. The sand and gravel bins were elevated above the
mixer and received their materials from cars which dumped directly from the steel viaduct.

The hoist buckets discharged into two hoppers mounted on platforms on the old viaduct. These
platforms straddled two narrow gage tracks, one on each side of the old viaduct parallel to
and clearing the main track. These side tracks were carried on the cantilever ends of long
timbers laid across the old viaduct between ties. At street crossings the overhanging ends
of the long timbers were strutted diagonally down to the outside shelf of the bottom chords
of the plate girder spans. Six cars were used and the concrete was dumped by them directly
into the forms; the fall from the track above being in some cases 40 ft. The hoists and shuttle
car were operated by an 8½×12-in. Lambert derrick engine, the boiler of which also supplied
steam to the mixer engine. The concrete cars were operated by cable haulage by two Lambert
7×10-in. engines.

The labor force employed in mixing and placing concrete, including form work, was 45 men, and
this force placed on an average 200 cu. yds. of concrete per day. Assuming wages we get the
following costs of different parts of the work for labor above:

Item.                                          Per day.   Per cu. yd.
1 timekeeper at $2.50                          $ 2.50       $0.0125

1 foreman finishing at $4                        4.00        0.0200
4 laborers finishing at $1.75                    7.00        0.0350
                                               ------       -------
45 men at $2.70                               $120.25       $0.6012

It is probable that the carpenter work includes merely shifting and erecting forms and not
the first cost of framing centers. No materials, of course, are included. It should be kept
in mind that while the output and labor force are exact the wages are assumed.

~Traveling Derrick Plant for 4-Span Arch Bridge.~--The bridge consisted of four 70-ft. arch
spans and was built close alongside an old bridge which it was ultimately to replace. The approach
from the west was across a wide flat; at the east the ground rose more abruptly from the stream.
Conditions prevented the use of a long spur track and also made it necessary to install all
plant at and to handle all material from the west bank. A diagram sketch of the arrangement
adopted is shown by Fig. 153.

The track from the west approached the existing bridge on an embankment 25 ft. high. A spur
track 175 ft. long from clear post to end was built on trestle as shown. The cement house and
mixer platform were placed at the foot of the embankment at opposite ends of the spur track.
Between the two the slope of the embankment was sheeted with 1-in. boards and a timber bulkhead
4 ft. high was built along the toe of the sheeting. Stone, sand and coal were stored behind
the bulkhead on the sheeting. A runway close to the bulkhead connected the cement house with
the mixer platform, all materials to the mixer being wheeled in barrows on this runway. A ¾-cu.
yd. Smith mixer was set on a platform 5 ft. above ground with its discharge end toward the
stream. Beginning under this platform a service track was carried across the flat and stream
to the extreme end of the east abutment. This track consisted of three rails, two rails 4 ft.
apart next to the work and a third rail 25 ft. from the first. The 4-ft. gage provided for
cars carrying concrete buckets from the mixer and the 25-ft. gage provided for a traveling
derrick; 18-lb. rails were used and they proved to be too light, 40-lb. rails are suggested.
The derrick consisted of a triangular platform carrying a stiff leg derrick with a 25-ft. mast
and mounted on five wheels. The wheels were double flange 16 ins. diameter and cost $30 each,
being the most expensive part of the derrick. The derrick was made on the ground and took four
carpenters between 3 and 4 days to build. Derrick and 350 ft. of service track, including pole
trestle across the stream, cost between $600 and $800. The derrick was moved by means of a
cable wrapped around one spool of the Flory double-drum hoisting engine and leading forward
and back to deadmen set at opposite ends of the service track. Cars carrying concrete buckets
were run out on the 4-ft. gage track and the buckets were hoisted by the derrick and dumped
into a ½-cu. yd. car running on a movable transverse track across the bridge. This transverse
track was necessary to handle the concrete to the far side of the work, the derrick being set
too low and the boom being too short to reach. The derrick was used to handle material excavated
from the pier foundations and also to tear down the centers and spandrel forms. Some rather
general figures on the cost of this bridge are given by Mr. H. C. Harrison, the contractor.
They are:

Materials:                                  Total.

6,000 bbls. cement at $2.05                $12,300

Total                                      $13,000

Mr. Harrison states that including plant cost, delays, floods and incidentals the cost per
cubic yard of concrete was $8 and that excluding these items the cost was $6 per cu. yd.

~COST OF CONSTRUCTING CONCRETE HIGHWAY BRIDGE, GREENE COUNTY, IOWA.~--The following is the
itemized cost of constructing a reinforced concrete slab highway bridge, one of several built
by the Highway Commissioners of Greene County, Iowa, in 1906. The figures are given by Messrs.
Henry Haag and D. E. Donovan, the last being the foreman of the concrete gang doing the work.
All bridges consist of 10 to 12-in. slabs reinforced with old steel rails and of abutments
and wing walls reinforced with old rods, bars or angles selected from junk. This junk metal
cost 0.6 cts. per pound and the rails cut to length cost 1.15 cts. per pound f. o. b. cars.
The work was done by a special gang, the men receiving $1.50 per day and board. As a rule the
footings were made 2 ft. wide and as high as need be to get above the water and dirt. Before
the footing concrete set steel rods, bars or angles were placed; they were long enough to reach
the height of the wall and 3 to 6 ins. into the slab. The forms for the abutment and wing walls
and for the floor slab were then erected complete before any more concrete was placed. No carpenter
was employed, every man on the job having been taught to take his certain place in the work,
then, the forms being erected, every man had his particular place in the work of mixing and
placing the concrete. The foreman saw that the reinforcement was properly placed and watched
over the accuracy of the work generally. The concrete was allowed to set on the centers for
from 30 to 40 days; the other form work was taken down after three days and travel over the
bridge permitted after three or four days. The concrete was mixed wet. The bridge whose cost
is given was 22 ft. wide and 16 ft. span with 2-ft. wing walls.

The foundations are 4 ft. deep and 2½ ft. wide. The walls on top of the foundations are 7 ft.
high, 18 ins. wide at the base, and battered up to 14 ins. at the top for wings and 12 ins.
at top for walls. The floor is 22 ft. by 18 ft. and 1 ft. thick. The wheel guard is 12 ins.
thick by 14 ins. wide and 32 ft. long. The itemized cost of this bridge, containing 73 cu.
yds. of concrete, is as follows:

Materials.                                       Total.   Per cu. yd. 70 cu. yds. gravel at

                                                ------      -------
Total cost                                     $431.05      $5.9054

In round figures the cost per cubic yard of concrete in the finished bridge was $5.90. Summarizing
we have the following cost per cubic yard of concrete in place:

Item.                       Per cu. yd.
Cement                         $2.26
Steel                           1.22
Lumber                          0.22
Gravel and stone                0.76
Labor                           1.41
Coal                            0.03
                               -----
Total                          $5.90

The average cost of concrete in place for all the work done in Greene County by day labor was
$6.25 per cu. yd. In the job itemized above the bank caved in, causing an extra expense for
removing the earth. The gravel used in this bridge was very good clean river gravel.

~METHOD AND COST OF CONSTRUCTING TWO HIGHWAY GIRDER BRIDGES.~--The following account of the
methods and costs of constructing two slab and beam highway bridge decks on old masonry abutments
is taken from records kept by Mr. Daniel J. Hauer. The first bridge was a single span 15 ft.
long that replaced wooden stringers and floor that had become unsafe; the second was two short
spans of a steel bridge that was too light for the traffic of the road, and it was torn down
and moved elsewhere, by the county authorities. The work was done by contract, and in each
case consisted of building the reinforced floor and girders on the old masonry walls that were
in good condition. While the work was going on traffic was turned off the bridges, fords being
used instead. Figure 154 shows a sketch of the cross-section of the floor and girders. In Example
I the girders had a depth below the floor of 12 ins. and were of the same width. In Example
II the girders were 14 ins. wide and had a depth below the floor of 18 ins. The floors on both
bridges were 6 ins. thick. Kahn bars were used for reinforcement.

Example I.--This bridge was but little more than 5 ft. above the stream, which was shallow
and not over 7 ft. wide, unless swollen by floods. The bottom for several hundred feet on either
side of the bridge was covered with coarse sand and gravel, that had pebbles in it from the
size of a goose egg down. This was taken from the stream by men with picks and shovels and
hauled to the site of the work with wheelbarrows, and then screened so as to separate the gravel
from the sand. As it was found that the sand was so coarse that it would take more cement than
the specifications called for in a 1-2½-5 mixture, some much finer sand was bought and mixed
with it. For the privilege of taking the sand from the stream $1 was paid the property owner.
This was done to get a receipt and release from him, rather than as an attempt to pay royalty
on the gravel and sand. This dollar is included in the cost of the labor in getting these materials.

The cost of materials per cubic yard for the bridge was as given below, the mixture being as
stated above. The cement cost $1.40 per barrel, delivered at the bridge.

                               Per Cu. Yd.
Steel                             $2.50
Gravel and sand                     .75
Sand (bought)                       .30
Cement                             1.57
                                  -----
Per cubic yard                    $5.12

It is of interest to note the cost of the gravel and sand, as this includes the cost of digging
it, wheeling it in a wheelbarrow an average distance of 100 ft., and then screening it and
putting it in two stock piles. The proportion of bought sand used with the creek sand was one-half.

The old wooden floor and stringers had to be torn down. This was done at a cost of $1.30 per
M. ft. B. M., and furnished 60 per cent. of the lumber needed for forms. The floor boards were
3-in. yellow pine planks, and the stringers 6×12-in. timbers, rather heavy, but money was saved
by using them. The 6×12-in. timbers were used for props for the centering. Additional lumber
was bought, delivered at the site of the bridge, for $20.84 per M. ft. B. M.

In framing and erecting the forms the carpenter had laborers helping him, he doing only carpenter's
work, the laborers carrying and lifting all pieces wherever possible. The carpenter's work
was about 40 per cent. of the total labor cost, which was as follows per cubic yard of concrete:

Tearing down old bridge            $0.08
Lumber                               .85
Nails                                .15
Labor, carpenter                     .77
Labor, laborers                      .96
                                   -----
                                   $2.81

The forms were torn down by laborers, with the assistance of a man and his helper, who were
given the boards for this labor and to haul them away. This reduced this item somewhat, as
it only amounted to 20 cts. per cu. yd.

The cost of the forms per thousand feet board measure was:

New lumber                        $20.82
Nails                               1.44
Labor, carpenter                    7.60
Labor, laborers                     9.50
Tearing down                        2.00
                                  ------
                                  $41.36

All the men, including the carpenter, worked 10 hours per day, and were paid at the following
rates:

Carpenter                           $2.50 Sub-foreman                          2.00 Laborers
1.50

A regular foreman was not employed, but an intelligent and handy workman was given 50 cts.
additional to lead the men and look after them when the contractor was not present.

A gang of six men did the work of mixing and placing, and as the stock piles were close by
the mixing board no extra men were needed to handle materials. Water was secured from the stream
in buckets for mixing. The mixture was made very wet. The cost per cubic yard for the entire
structure was as follows:

Preparing for mixing               $0.04
Cleaning out forms                   .06
Handling steel                       .03

                                  $11.64

Example II.--For this bridge both the stone and sand had to be bought. The bridge floor was
nearly 14 ft. above the bottom of the stream, which was shallow. The wages paid were as follows
for a 10-hour day:

Foreman                            $3.00 Laborers                            1.50

Carpenters were paid $3 for an 8-hour day and time and a half for all overtime, which they
frequently made.

For the girders a 1-2-4 mixture was used. The cement, delivered at the bridge, cost $1.21 per
barrel, there being 8 cts. a barrel storage and 8 cts. a barrel for hauling included in this.
The sand was paid for at an agreed price per cartload delivered, which averaged $1.34 per cu.
yd. The stone was crushed so as to pass a 1½-in. ring in all directions. It was delivered at
the bridge for $2.75 per cu. yd. This makes the cost per cubic yard for materials as follows:

Steel                              $1.41
Cement                              2.18
Sand                                 .67
Stone                               2.75
                                   -----
                                   $7.01

For the floor a 1-3-5 mixture was used, making a cost for material of:

Steel                              $1.02
Cement                              1.69
Sand                                 .67
Stone                               2.75
                                   -----
                                   $6.13

Two-inch rough pine boards were used to make the troughs for the girders, while 1-in. rough
boards were used for the floors. These were all supported by 3×4-in. pine scantlings. This
lumber cost delivered $17.50 per M. ft. B. M. Carpenters did all the framing, and erected it
with the help of laborers. All the carrying of the lumber was done by laborers. This reduced
the cost of the work, as the laborers' wages amounted to one-third of the whole cost. As soon
as the forms were all in place, which was before the mixing of concrete commenced, the carpenters
were discharged. The cost per cubic yard for forms was:

Lumber                      $2.82
Nails                         .05
Labor, carpenters            1.24
Laborers                      .62
                            -----
                            $4.73

The tearing down of the forms was done entirely by laborers at a cost of 61 cts. per cu. yd.

On concrete work it is also advisable to keep the cost of forms per thousand feet board measure,
so as to have such data for estimating on new work. The cost per M. ft. on this job was:

Lumber                      $17.50
Nails                          .30
Labor, carpenters             7.65
Laborers                      3.85

                             ------
                            $33.10

The concrete was mixed by hand, water being carried in buckets from the creek. Ten to twelve
men were worked in the gang under a foreman, and the concrete was wheeled from the mixing board
to the forms in wheelbarrows. The mixture was made wet enough to run. The cost per cubic yard
for the girders in detail was as follows:

This gives a total cost per cubic yard for the concrete in the girders in the completed bridge
as follows:

Included with this is an item for general expense, being expenses of the contractor in bidding
on the work, car fare, and other items of expense in looking after the contract.

It will be noticed that a record is here given of three different mixtures and that the labor
cost of mixing and placing increases with the richness of the mixture. This is because it takes
a greater number of batches to the cubic yard. Record has also been given of cost of preparing
the mixing board and other work necessary to start and clean up each day; also when stock piles
could not be arranged close to the mixing board, of the cost of handling the materials. These
items, it will be noticed, are large enough to be considered in estimating on new work. The
cost of sweeping and cleaning out the forms has also been listed, as this work is extremely
important.

The cost of the reinforcing steel is given in with the materials, but the labor of handling
it and placing it in the forms is listed under labor. This naturally varies with the amount
of steel needed, and with the Kahn bar it will vary from 10 cts. to 75 cts. per cubic yard,
as the prongs of the bar must be bent into proper position and at times straightened, when
bent in shipment. This cost seems large, but it is done with the ordinary labor, while with
round rods a large amount of blacksmith work has to be done and a smith and his helper frequently
must place them. The patent bars are all lettered and numbered as structural steel is, and
can be placed under the direction of the foreman.

One striking lesson can be learned from the forming. It will be noticed that the cost for common
labor for handling and helping to erect the forms was much larger in Example I than in Example
II, although the bridge was higher in the latter instance. This was caused by the heavy timber
that was used, and equaled an extra cost nearly 50 per cent. of the price of new lumber. It
certainly speaks volumes against the use of unnecessarily heavy timber for concrete forms.

In bridge work the height of the floor above the stream to some extent governs the cost of
the forms. This is made so by the extra lumber needed as props or falsework to support the
forming, and also by the fact that men at some height above the ground do not work as quickly
or as readily as they do nearer the ground. For high and long spans a derrick is sometimes
needed for the work of placing the centering.

On these jobs the concrete was made so wet that with the proper tamping and cutting of the
concrete in the forms the surfaces were so smooth that no plastering was needed.

~MOLDING SLABS FOR GIRDER BRIDGES.~--The bridges carry railway tracks across intersecting streets;
the slabs rest on two abutments and three rows of columns so that there are two 24¼-ft. spans
over the street roadway and one 10¾-ft. span over each sidewalk. The larger slabs were 24 ft.
3 ins. long, 33 ins. thick and 7 ft. wide; each contained 16¾ cu. yds. of concrete and weighed
36¾ tons. The smaller slabs were 10 ft. 9 ins. long, 17 ins. thick and 7 ft. wide; each contained
3.65 cu. yds. of concrete and weighed 7.8 tons. The weights were found by actual weighing.
They make the weight of the reinforced slab between 160 and 162 lbs. per cu. ft. The concrete
was generally 1 part cement and 4 parts pit gravel. The reinforcement consisted of corrugated
bars. The method of molding was as follows:

A cinder fill yard was leveled off and tamped, then the forms were set up on both sides of
two lines of railway track arranged as shown by Fig. 155. The exact construction of the forms
for one of the larger slabs is shown by Fig. 156. The side and end pieces were so arranged
as to be easily taken down and erected for repeated use. About 100 floors were used and they
had to be leveled up each time used as the lifting of the hardened slab disarranged them. The
side and end pieces were removed in about a week or ten days, but the slabs stood on the floor
90 days, being wetted each day for two weeks after molding.

The plant for mixing and handling the concrete was mounted on cars. A flat car had a rotary
drum mixer mounted on a platform at its forward end. Beneath the mixer was a hopper provided
with a deflector which directed the concrete to right or left as desired. Under the hopper
were the ends of two inclined chutes extending out sidewise beyond the car--one to the right
and one to the left--and over the slab molds on each side. Above the mixer was another platform
containing a charging hopper, and from the rear of this platform an incline ran down to the
rear end of the car and then down to the track rails. A car loaded with cement and gravel in
the proper proportions was hauled up the incline by cable operated by the mixer engine, until
it came over the topmost hopper into which it was dumped. This hopper directed the charge into
the mixer below; the mixer discharged its batch into the hopper beneath from which it flowed
right or left as desired into one of the chutes and thence into the mold. The chutes reached
nearly the full length of the molds and discharged as desired over the ends into the far end
of the mold or through a trap over the end of the mold nearest the car.

To the rear of the mixer car came a cement car provided with a platform overhanging its forward
end. Two hoppers were set in this platform each holding a charge for one batch. Coupled behind
the cement cars came three or four gravel cars. These were gondola cars and plank runways were
laid along their top outer edges making a continuous runway for wheelbarrows on each side from
rear of train to front of cement car. The sand and gravel were wheeled to the two measuring
hoppers and the cement was handed up from the car below and added, the charge was then discharged
into the dump car below and the car was hauled up the incline to the mixer as already described.
Two measuring hoppers were used so that one was being filled while the other was emptied, thus
making the work continuous.

The molding gang consisted of 33 laborers, two foremen and one engineman. This gang averaged
7 of the large slabs per 10-hour day and at times made as many as 9 slabs. When molding small
slabs an average of 12 were made per day. This record includes all delays, moving train, switching
gravel cars on and off, building runways, etc. The distribution of the men was about as follows:

Handling Materials:                           No. Men.

Shoveling gravel into wheelbarrows                9 Wheeling gravel to measuring hoppers  
9 Emptying cement into measuring hoppers            2 Handling cement to men emptying     
1 In charge of loading dump car                     1 On top of cement car

This gang mixed and placed concrete for 7 blocks or 117¼ cu. yds. of concrete per day. Assuming
an average wage of $2 per day the cost of labor mixing and placing was 61.4 cts. per cu. yd.
or $10.28 per slab. It is stated that the slabs cost $11.80 per cu. yd. on storage pile. This
includes labor and materials (concrete and steel); molds; loading into cars with locomotive
crane, hauling cars to storage yard and unloading with crane into storage piles, and inspection,
incidentals, etc. To load the slabs into cars from storage piles, transport them to the work
and place them in position is stated to have cost $2 per cu. yd. The slabs were placed by means
of a locomotive crane being swung from the flat cars directly into place.

~METHOD AND COST OF CONSTRUCTING CONNECTICUT AVE. BRIDGE, WASHINGTON, D. C.~--The Connecticut
Ave. Bridge at Washington, D. C., consists of nine 150-ft. spans and two 82-ft. spans, one
at each end, all full centered arches of mass concrete trimmed with tool-dressed concrete blocks.
Figure 157 is a part sectional plan and elevation of the bridge, showing both the main and
spandrel arch construction. This bridge is one of the largest concrete arch bridges in the
world, being 1,341 ft. long and 52 ft. wide, and containing 80,000 cu. yds. of concrete. Its
total cost was $850,000 or $638.85 per lin. ft., or $10.63 per cu. yd. of masonry. It was built
by contract, with Mr. W. J. Douglas as engineer in charge of construction. The account of the
methods and cost of construction given here has been prepared from information obtained from
Mr. Douglas and by personal visits to the work during construction.

General Arrangement of the Plant.--The quarry from which the crushed stone for concrete was
obtained was located in the side of the gorge at a point about 400 ft. from the bridge. Incidentally,
it may be added, the fact that the contractor had an option on this quarry gave him an advantage
of some $30,000 over the other bidders. The stone from the quarry was hoisted about 50 ft.
by derricks and deposited in cars which traveled on an incline to a Gates gyratory crusher,
into which they dumped automatically. The stone from the crusher dropped into a 600-cu. yd.
bin under the bottom of which was a tunnel large enough for a dump car and provided with top
gates by which the stone above could be dropped into the cars. The cars were hauled by cable
to the mixer storage bin and there discharged. Sand was brought in by wagons and dumped onto
a platform about 50 ft. higher than the bottom of the main stone bin. A tunnel exactly similar
to that under the stone bin was carried under the sand storage platform. The sand car was hauled
from this tunnel by cable to the mixer storage bin using the same cable as was used for the
stone cars, the cable being shifted by hand as was desired. Cement was delivered to the mixer
platform from the crest of the bluff by means of a bag chute.

The mixer used was one of the Hains gravity type. It had four drops and was provided with four
mixing hoppers at the top. The concrete was made quite wet. The proportions of sand and water
were varied to suit the stone according to its wetness and the percentage of dust carried by
it. The head mixer regulated the proportions and his work was checked by the government inspector.
From the bottom hopper the mixed concrete dropped into a skip mounted on a car.

To distribute the skip cars along the work a trestle was built close alongside the bridge and
at about springing line level. This trestle had a down grade of about 2 per cent. from the
mixer. Derricks mounted along the centering and on the block molding platform lifted the skips
from the cars and deposited them where the concrete was wanted. The skip cars were large enough
for three skips but only two were carried so that the derricks could save time by depositing
an empty skip in the vacant space and take a loaded skip away with one full swing of the boom.
Altogether nine derricks were used in the bridge, four having 70-ft. booms and five having
90-ft. booms. These derricks were jacked up as the work progressed.

Forms and Centers.--The forms for wall and pier work consisted of 1-in. lagging held in place
by studs about 2 ft. on centers and they in turn supported by wales which were connected through
the walls by bolts, the outer portions of which were removed when the forms were taken down.

The centers for the five 150-ft. arches were all erected at one time; those for the 82-ft.
arches were erected separately. The seven centers required 1,500,000 ft. B. M. of lumber or
1,404 ft. B. M. per lineal foot of bridge between abutments, or 1,640 ft. B. M. per lineal
foot of arch span. The centers for the main arch spans are shown in detail by Fig. 158; this
drawing shows the sizes of all members and the maximum stresses to which they were subjected
from the loading indicated, that is the arch ring concrete. The centers as a rule rested on
pile foundations. Four piles to each post were used for the intermediate posts and two piles
for the posts in the two rows next the piers. Concrete foundations, however, were put in Rock
Creek and on the line of Woodley Lane Bridge where it was impracticable to drive piles. As
considerable difficulty was experienced in driving the piles, the ground consisting mostly
of rotten rock, it is thought that it would have cost less if the contractor had used concrete
footings throughout.

Some of the costs of form work and centering are given. The cost of lumber delivered at the
bridge site was about as follows:

                                          M. ft. B. M.
Rough Virginia pine                         $25
Dressed Virginia pine lagging                23
Rough Georgia, sizes up to 12×12 ins.        33
Rough Georgia, sizes over 12×12 ins.         35
Rough oak lumber                             35

The following wages were paid: Foreman carpenter, $3.50; carpenters, $2 to $3; laborers, $1.70,
with a few at $1.50. An 8-hour day was worked.

The cost, of formwork is given in summary as follows:

Total cost erected                     $16.00

The total cost of the main arch span centers to the District of Columbia was $54,000 or $59
per lineal foot of arch span, or $37.33 per M. ft. B. M. The cost of center erection and demolition
was as follows:

Erection below springing line per M. ft.        $15 Erection above springing line per M. ft.
25 Demolition                                        5

Molding Concrete Blocks.--The bridge is trimmed throughout with molded concrete blocks, comprising
belt courses, quoin stones, chain stones, ring stones, brackets and dentils. The blocks were
made of a 1-2-4½ concrete faced with a 1-3 mixture of Dragon Portland cement and bluestone
screenings from 3/8-in. size to dust. They were cast in wooden molds with collapsible sides
held together by iron rods. Each mold was provided with six bottoms so that the molded block
could be left standing on the bottom to harden while the side pieces were being used for molding
another block. The molding was done on a perfectly level and tight floor on mud sills, the
perfect level of the molding platform having been found to be an important factor in securing
a uniform casting. The blocks were molded with the principal showing face down and the secondary
showing faces vertical. The facing mortar was placed first and then the concrete backing. Care
was taken to tamp the concrete so as to force the concrete stone into but not through the facing.
Mr. Douglas remarks that the back of the block should always be at the top in molding since
the laitance or slime always flushes to the surface making a weak skin which will develop hair
cracks. In this work the backs of the blocks were mortised by embedding wooden cubes in the
wet concrete and removing them when the concrete had set. These mortises bonded the blocks
with the mass concrete backing. The blocks were left to harden for at least 30 days and preferably
for 60 days and were then bush hammered on the showing faces, some of the work being done by
hand and some with pneumatic tools.

Some precautions necessary in the molding and handling of large concrete blocks were discovered
in this work and merit mention. In designing blocks for molding it is necessary to avoid thin
flanges or the flanges will crack and break off; blocks molded with a 2¼ in. flange projecting
1¾ ins. gave such trouble from cracking on this work that a flange 5 ins. thick was substituted.
Provide for the method of handling the block so that dog or lewis holes will not come in the
showing faces. Dog holes can be made with a pick when the concrete is three or four weeks old.
When it is not practicable to use dogs, two-pin lewises can be used. The lewis holes should
be cast in the block and should be of larger size than for granite; they should not be located
too near the mortar faces. In turning blocks it is necessary to provide some sort of cushion
for them to turn on or broken arrises will result. When the work will permit, it is desirable
to round the arrises to about a 3/8-in. radius.

The following general figures of the cost of block work are available. Foreman cutters were
paid $5 per day; foreman concrete workers $3 per day; stonecutters $4 per day; concrete laborers
$1.70 per day, and common laborers $1.50 to $1.70 per day. Plain and ornamental blocks cost
about the same, the large size of the ornamental blocks bringing down the cost. The following
is given as the average cost of block work per cubic yard:

Cement                                                         $ 1.95
Sand                                                             0.35
Stone                                                            1.14
Forms, lumber and making                                         0.80
Mixing and placing concrete                                      1.50
Dressing                                                         4.73
Handling and setting                                             2.00
Superintendence, plant, incidentals at 25 per cent.              3.12
Condemnation at 5 per cent.                                      0.78
                                                               ------
Total cost blocks in place                                     $16.37

It will be seen that the largest single item in the above summary of costs is the item of dressing.
This was done, as stated above, partly by hand and partly by pneumatic tools. Hand tooling
cost about twice as much as machine tooling, but its appearance was generally better. The average
cost of tooling the several forms of blocks is shown by Table XIX. For 42,190 sq. ft. the average
cost was 26 cts. per sq. ft. or $2.34 per sq. yd., or $4.73 per cu. yd. of block work. This
tooling was done by stone cutters, and was unusually high in cost.

Mass Concrete Work.--All parts of the bridge except the molded block trim were built of concrete
deposited in place. Briefly, the molded blocks were set first and then backed up with the mass
concrete deposited in forms and on centers. The only features of this work that call for particular
description are those in connection with the main arch ring and the spandrel arch construction.

The main arch rings were concreted in transverse sections; Fig. 158 shows the size and order
of construction of these sections. Back forms were necessary up to an angle of 45° from the
spring line after which the concrete was made somewhat drier and back forms were not used.
After Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 had been concreted they were allowed to set and then the struts
and back forms were taken out and the intervening sections were concreted. The large Sections
6 and 7 were concreted in five sections each, in order to permit the taking out of the timber
struts supporting the sections above. The concrete in all sections was placed in horizontal
layers as a rule and it is the judgment of the engineers in charge of this work that this is
the preferable method.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in building the large arches with a concrete block
facing on account of the fact that the edges of the blocks are liable to chip off when any
concentrated pressure is brought on them. In order to permit the ring of blocks to deform as
the centering settled under its load, sheet lead was placed in the joints between blocks at
the points corresponding with the construction joints between sections of the mass concrete
backing. The deflection of the centers at the crown was a maximum of 3¼ ins. and a minimum
of 2½ ins.

The centering of the main arches was not struck until the spandrel arches and all the work
above the main arches to the bottom of the coping had been completed. The first and third spandrel
arch on each side of the piers was made with an expansion joint in the crown. To permit further
of the adjustment of the portion of the masonry above the backs of the main arches, the crown
of the middle arch of each set of spandrel arches was left unconcreted until the center of
the main arches had been struck. It may be noted here that the expansion joints in the first
and third arches were carried up through the dentils and coping, and observations show that
these joints are about 1/8 in. larger in winter than in summer.

The cost of the mass concrete work is shown in Table XX. These figures are based on the wages
already quoted and the following: Foreman riggers, $4.50; riggers, $1.50 to $1.75 and $2; skilled
laborers, $2; engineers, $3.50. The detail cost of engineering and inspection is shown in Table
XXI.

~ARCH BRIDGES, ELKHART, IND.~--At the new Elkhart, Ind., yards of the Lake Shore & Michigan
Southern Ry. the tracks are carried over a city street by concrete arches 40, 60 and 160 ft.
long. These arches all have a span of 30 ft., a height of 13 ft. and a ring thickness at crown
of 28 ins. The reinforcement consists of arch and transverse bars; the arch bars are spaced
6 ins. on centers 2½ ins. from both extrados and intrados, and the transverse bars are spaced
24 ins. on centers inside both lines of arch bars. The proportions of the concrete were generally
1 cement, 3 gravel and 6 stone. The gravel was a material dug from the foundations and was
about 50 per cent. sand and 50 per cent. gravel, ranging up to the size of pigeons' eggs. The
concrete was machine mixed and was mixed very wet.

The work was done by the railway company's forces, and Mr. Samuel Rockwell, Assistant Chief
Engineer, gives the following figures of cost:

~ARCH BRIDGE, PLAINWELL, MICH.~--The following figures of cost of a reinforced concrete arch
bridge are given by Mr. P. A. Courtright. The bridge crosses the Kalamazoo River at Plainwell,
Mich., and is 446 ft. long over all with seven arches of 54 ft. span and 8 ft. rise. The arch
rings were reinforced with 4-in., 6-lb. channels bent to a radius of 70 ft. and spaced 1.9
ft. c. to c. The contract price of the bridge was $19,900.

The concrete was made of Portland cement and a natural mixture of sand and gravel in the proportions
of 1-8 for the foundations, 1-6 for arches and spandrel walls and 1-4 for the parapet wall.
The proportions were determined by measure; the wagon boxes being built to hold a cubic yard
of sand and gravel. A sack of cement was taken as 1 cu. ft. For foundations the pit mixture
was used without screening; stones over 4 ins. in diameter being thrown out at the pit or on
the mixing board. For the arches and spandrel walls the gravel was passed over a 2-in. mesh
screen on the wagon box. The aggregate for the parapet walls was screened to 1 in. largest
diameter. The concrete was mixed in a McKelvey continuous mixer which turned the material eight
times. The mode of procedure was as follows: The gravel was loaded upon wagons in the pit and
hauled to a platform at the intake of the mixer. Half of the cement required in the concrete
was then spread over the top of the load in the wagon box and the whole was dumped through
the bottom of the wagon box onto the platform and spread with shovels. The remainder of the
cement was spread over the mixture and the whole was shoveled by one man to a second man who
shoveled it into the mixer. Water was added after the mixture had passed about one-third of
the way through the mixer. The mixer delivered the concrete directly into wheelbarrows, by
which it was delivered to the work. The concrete was spread in layers from 2 to 4 ins. in thickness
and thoroughly rammed with iron tampers; two men were employed tamping for each man shoveling.
The arches were concreted in three longitudinal sections, each section constituting a day's
work. The work was done in 1903 and the concrete cost for mixing and placing:

~METHODS AND COST OF CONSTRUCTING A FIVE-SPAN ARCH BRIDGE.~--This bridge consisted of five
elliptical arch spans of 40, 45, 60, 87 and 44 ft., carried on concrete piers. The arch rings
were 12 ins. thick at the crowns and 18 ins. thick 5 ft. from the centers of piers and carried
4-in. spandrel walls; there were 1,000 cu. yds. of concrete in the arches and 600 cu. yds.
in the piers. Each arch ring was reinforced by a grillage of longitudinal and transverse rods.

Forms and Centers.--Figure 159 is an end view of the center arch. It consists of a series of
bents, 6 ft. c. to c., the posts of each bent being 5 ft. c. to c. These posts are made of
2×6-in. Washington fir. Upon the heads of the posts rest 2×6-in. stringers, extending from
bent to bent. Resting on these stringers are wooden blocks, or wedges, which support a series
of cross-stringers, also of 2×6-in. stuff, spaced 2 ft. c. to c. On top of these cross-stringers
rest the sheeting planks, which are 1×6-in. stuff, dressed on the upper side, and bent to the
curve of the arch. This sheeting plank was not tongue and grooved, and a man standing under
it, after it is nailed in place, could see daylight through the cracks. It looked as if it
would leak like a sieve, and let much of the wet concrete mortar flow through the cracks, but,
as a matter of fact, scarcely any escapes. Figure 160 shows a front view of a bent, and indicates
the manner of sway bracing it with 1×4-in. stuff. Figure 161 shows the outer forms for the
parapet wall, or concrete hand railing, and it will be noted that the cross-stringers are allowed
to project about 3 ft. so as to furnish a place to fasten the braces which hold the upright
studs. The inner forms for the parapet wall are shown in dotted lines. They are not put in
place until all the concrete arch is built. Then they are erected and held to the outer forms
by wire, and are sway braced to wooden cleats nailed to the top surface of the concrete arch.

For the five spans the total amount of lumber in the centers was in round figures 28 M. ft.,
distributed about as follows:

Item.                                         Ft. B. M.
1×6-in. sheeting                             5,600
2×6-in. longitudinal stringers               2,600
2×6-in. cross stringers                      2,600
2×6-in. posts                                4,000
3×8-in. sills                                1,500
1×4-in. braces                               3,000
Outer forms for spandrel walls               4,000
Inner forms for spandrel walls               4,000
                                            ------
Total                                       27,300

The aggregate span length of the arches was 276 ft., so that a little less than 100 ft. B.
M. of lumber was used for centering per lineal foot of span. The superintendent at $5 per day
and five carpenters at $3.50 per day erected the five centers in 18 days at a cost of $400,
or a trifle more than $14 per M. ft. B. M.; the cost of taking down the centers was $2 per
M. ft. B. M., and the lumber for the centers cost $24 per M. ft. B. M. making a grand total
of $40 per M. ft. B. M. for materials and labor. As there were 1,000 cu. yds. of concrete in
the arches and spandrels, the cost of centers and forms was $1.12 per cu. yd. This form lumber
was, however, after taking down, used again in erecting a reinforced concrete building. Assuming
that the lumber was used only twice, the cost of centers and forms for these five arches was
less than 80 cts. per cu. yd. of concrete.

Shaping and Placing Reinforcement.--The 60 and 87-ft. spans were reinforced with 32 1½-in.
round longitudinal rods held in place by ½-in. square transverse rods wired at the intersections;
the reinforcement of the smaller spans was exactly the same except that 1-in. diameter rods
were used. To bend the longitudinal rods to curve, planks were laid on the ground roughly to
the curve of the arch; the exact curve was marked on these planks and large spikes were driven
part way into the planks along this mark. The end of a rod was then fastened by spiking it
against the first projecting spike head and three men taking hold of the opposite end and walking
it around until the rod rested against all the spikes on the curve. It took three men two 8-hour
days to bend 46,000 lbs. of rods. Their wages were $2.50 each per day, making the cost of bending
0.03 ct. per pound, or 60 cts. per ton. It took a man 5 mins. to wire a cross rod to a longitudinal
rod. With wages at $2.50 per day the cost of shaping and placing the reinforcement per ton
was as follows:

Item.                                  Per ton.
Bending rods                            $0.60
Shearing rods to lengths                 0.40
Carrying rods onto bridge                0.40
Placing and wiring rods                  2.35
                                        -----
Total                                   $3.75

Including superintendence the labor cost was practically $4 per ton, or 0.2 cts. per lb. Altogether
66,000 lbs. of steel was used for reinforcing 1,000 cu. yds. of concrete, or 66 lbs. per cu.
yd. The cost of steel delivered was 2 cts. per lb., and the cost of shaping and placing it
0.2 ct. per lb., a total of 2.2 cts. per lb. or 2.2 × 66 = $1.45 per cu. yd. of concrete.

Mixing and Placing Concrete.--A Ransome mixer holding a half-yard batch was used. The mixer
was driven by an electric motor. The concrete for the piers was a mixture of 1 part Portland
cement to 7 parts gravel; for the arches, the concrete was mixed 1 to 5. The gravel was piled
near the mixer, a snatch team being used to assist the wagons in delivering the gravel into
a pile as high as possible. Run planks supported on "horses" were laid horizontally from the
mixer to the gravel, so that big wheelbarrow loads could be handled. The barrows were loaded
with long-handled shovels, and the men worked with great vigor, as is shown by the fact that
four men, shoveling and wheeling, delivered enough gravel to the mixer in 8 hrs. to make 100
cu. yds. of concrete. We have, therefore, estimated on a basis of six men instead of four.
The mixer crew was organized as follows:

                                           Per day.
6 men shoveling and wheeling                 $12
2 men handling cement                          4
1 man handling water                           2
1 man dumping concrete                         2
2 men handling dump cars                       4
2 men handling hoisting rope                   4
4 men spreading and ramming concrete           8
1 engineman                                    4
1 foreman                                      5
Fuel, estimated                                3
                                             ---
Total                                        $48

The output of this crew was 100 cu. yds. per day. The concrete was hauled from the mixer in
two small dump cars, each having a capacity of 10 cu. ft. The average load in each car was
¼ cu. yd. Ordinary mine cars were used, of the kind which can be dumped forward, or on either
side. The cars were hauled over tracks having a gage of 18 ins. The rails weighed 16 lbs. per
yard, and were held by spikes ¼×2½ ins. Larger spikes would have split the cross-ties, which
were 3×4 ins. Only one spike was driven to hold each rail to each tie, the spikes being on
alternate sides of the rail in successive ties. No fish plates or splice bars were used to
join the rails, which considerably simplifies the track laying.

Two lines of track were laid over the bridge. The tracks were supported by light bents, the
cross-tie forming the cap of each bent, as shown in Fig. 162. The bents were spaced 3 ft. apart.
There were two posts to each bent, toe-nailed at the top of the tie, and at the bottom to the
arch sheeting plank. Two men framed these crude bents and laid the two rails at the rate of
150 lin. ft. of track per day, at a cost of 4 cts. per lin. ft. of track. As stated, there
were two tracks, one on each side of the bridge, but they converged as they neared the concrete
mixer, so that a car coming from either track could run under the discharge chute of the mixer;
Fig. 163 shows the arrangement of the tracks at the mixer. The part of each rail from A to
B (6 ft. long) was free to move by bending at A, the rail being spiked rigidly to the tie at
A, leaving its end at B free to move. To move the end B, so as to switch the cars, a home-made
switch was improvised, as shown in Figs. 163 and 164.

It will be remembered that this bridge was a series of five arches. There was a steep grade
from the two ends of the bridge to the crown of the center arch. Hence the two railway tracks
ascended on a steep grade from the mixer for about 175 ft., then they descended rapidly to
the other end of the bridge. Hence to haul the concrete cars up the grade by using a wire cable,
it was necessary to anchor a snatch block at the center of the bridge. This was done by erecting
a short post, the top of which was about a foot above the top of the rails. The post stood
near the track, and was guyed by means of wires, and braced by short inclined struts. To the
top of the post was lashed the snatch block through which passed the wire rope. Fig. 165 shows
this post, P. About 10 ft. from the post P, on the side toward the mixer, another post, Q,
was erected, and a snatch block fastened to it. When the hoisting engine, which was set near
the concrete mixer, began hauling the car along the track, a laborer would follow the car.
Just before the car reached the post Q, he would unhook the hoisting rope from the front end
of the car, then push the car past the post Q, and hook the hoisting rope to the rear of the
car. The car would then proceed to descend in the direction T, being always under the control
of the wire rope, except during the brief period when the car was passing the post Q. Each
of the two cars was provided with its own hoisting rope, and one engineer, operating a double
drum hoist, handled the cars. The hoist was belted to an 8 HP. gasoline engine, no electric
motor being available for the purpose.

Where hauling is done in this manner with wire ropes, it is necessary to support the ropes
by rollers wherever they would rub against obstructions. A cheap roller can be made by taking
a piece of 2-in. gas pipe about a foot long, and driving a wooden plug in each end of the gas
pipe. Then bore a hole through the center of the wooden plugs and drive a 1-in. round rod through
the holes, as shown in Fig. 166. The ends of this rod are shoved into holes bored into plank
posts, which thus support the roller. Where the rope must be carried around a more or less
sharp corner, it is necessary to provide two rollers, one horizontal and the other vertical,
as shown in Fig. 167.

When conveying concrete to a point on the bridge about 300 ft. from the mixer, a dump car would
make the round trip in 3 mins., about ¼ min. of its time being occupied in loading and another
¼ min. in dumping. One man always walked along with each car, and another man helped pull the
wire rope back.

Including the cost of laying the track and installing the plant, the cost of mixing and placing
the 1,600 cu. yds. of concrete was only 55 cts. per cu. yd., in spite of the high wages paid.
However, the men were working for a contractor under a very good superintendent.

Summing up the cost of the concrete in the arches of this bridge, we have:

                                       Per cu. yd.
1.35 bbl. cement at $3                    $4.05
1 cu. yd. gravel at $1                     1.00
66 lbs. of steel in place at 2.2 cts.      1.45
Centers in place (lumber used once)        1.12
Labor, mix and place concrete              0.55
                                          -----
Total                                     $8.17

The cost of the nails, wire, excavation and plant rental is not available, but could not be
sufficient to add more than 10 cts. per cu. yd. under the conditions that existed in this case.

~CONCRETE RIBBED ARCH BRIDGE AT GRAND RAPIDS, MICH.~--The bridge consisted of seven parabolic
arch ribs of 75 ft. clear span and 14 ft. rise. The five ribs under the 21-ft roadway were
each 24 ins. thick, 50 ins. deep at skewbacks and 25 ins. deep at crown; the two ribs under
the sidewalks were 12 ins. thick and of the same depth as the main ribs. Each rib carried columns
which supported the deck slab. Columns and ribs were braced together across-bridge by struts
and webs. All structural parts of the bridge were of concrete reinforced by corrugated bars.
The abutments were hollow boxes with reinforced concrete shells tied in by buttresses and filled
with earth. There were in the bridge including abutments 884 cu. yds. of concrete and 62,000
lbs. of reinforcing metal, or about 70 lbs. of reinforcing metal per cu. yd. of concrete. Of
the 884 cu. yds. of concrete 594 cu. yds. were contained in the abutments and wing walls and
290 cu. yds. in the remainder of the structure. (Fig. 168.)

Centers.--The center for the arch consisted of 4-pile bents spaced about 12 ft. apart in the
line of the bridge. The piles were 12×12 in.×24 ft. yellow pine and they were braced together
in both directions by 2×10-in. planks. Each bent carried a 3×12-in. plank cap. Maple folding
wedges were set in these caps over each pile and on them rested 12×12-in. transverse timbers,
one directly over each bent. These 12×12-in. transverse timbers carried the back pieces cut
to the curve of the arch. The back pieces were 2×12-in. plank, two under each sidewalk rib
and four under each main rib of the arch. The back pieces under each rib were X-braced together.
The lagging was made continuous under the ribs but only occasional strips were carried across
the spaces between ribs. This reduced the amount of lagging required but made working on the
centers more difficult and resulted in loss of tools from dropping through the openings. Work
on the centers and forms was tiresome owing both to the difficulty of moving around on the
lagging and to the cramped positions in which the men labored. Carpenters were hard to keep
for these reasons.

Concrete.--A 1-7 bank gravel concrete was used for the abutments and a 1-5 bank gravel concrete
for the other parts of the bridge. The concrete was mixed in a cubical mixer operated by electric
motor and located at one end of the bridge. The mixed concrete was taken to the forms in wheelbarrows.
The mixture was of mushy consistency. No mortar facing was used, but the exposed surfaces were
given a grout wash. In freezing weather the gravel and water were heated to a temperature of
about 100° F.; when work was stopped at night it was covered with tarred felt, and was usually
found steaming the next morning.

Cost of Work.--The cost data given here are based on figures furnished to us by Geo. J. Davis,
Jr., who designed the bridge and kept the cost records. Mr. Davis states that the unit costs
are high, because of the adverse conditions under which the work was performed. The work was
done by day labor by the city, the men were all new to this class of work, the weather was
cold and there was high water to interfere, and work was begun before plans for the bridge
had been completed, so that the superintendent could not intelligently plan the work ahead.
Cost keeping was begun only after the work was well under way. Many of the items of cost are
incomplete in detail.

The following were the wages paid and the prices of the materials used:

METHODS AND COST OF CULVERT CONSTRUCTION.

Culvert work is generally located on the line of a railway or a highway, so that the facilities
for getting plant and materials onto the work are the best, and as culverts are in most cases
through embankment, under trestle or in trench below the ground level the advantage of gravity
is had in handling materials to mixer and to forms. Ordinarily individual culverts are not
long enough for any material economy to be obtained by using sectional forms unless these forms
are capable of being used on other jobs which may occasionally be the case where standard culvert
sections have been adopted by a railway or by a state highway commission. Various styles of
sectional forms for curvelinear sections are given in Chapter XXI, and centers suitable for
large arch culverts are discussed in Chapter XVII. Figure 169 shows an economic form for box
sections; it can be made in panels or with continuous lagging as the prospects of reuse in
other work may determine. For curvelinear sections of small size some of the patented metal
forms have been successfully used.

~BOX CULVERT CONSTRUCTION, C., B. & Q. R. R.~--Mr. L. J. Hotchkiss gives the following data.
Box sections of the type shown by Fig. 169 are used mostly; they range in size from single
4×4-ft. to double 20×20-ft. and triple 16×20-ft. boxes. These boxes are more simple in design
and construction than arches, and for locations requiring piles they are less expensive. The
form work is plain and the space occupied is small as compared with arches, so that excavation,
sheeting and pumping are less and the culvert can be put through an embankment or under a trestle
with less disturbance of the original structure. Finally, less expensive foundations are required.

For small jobs where it does not pay to install a power mixer a hand power mixer mounted on
a frame carried by two large wheels has been found at least as efficient as hand mixing; more
convenient and easier on the men. The machine is turned by a crank driving a sprocket chain;
it is charged at the stock piles and then hauled to the forms to be discharged. Local conditions
determine the capacity of power mixer to be used. Difficulties in supplying material or in
taking away the concrete may readily reduce the output of a large machine to that of one much
smaller, and the small machine is cheaper in first cost and in installation and operation.
Where the yardage is sufficient to justify the installation of equipment for handling the materials
and output of a large mixer it is found preferable to a small one, as the increase in plant
charges is not proportionately so great as the increase in the amount of concrete handled.
Again it may occur on a small job that the concrete must be taken a long distance from the
mixer, that a large batch can be moved as quickly and as easily as a small one and the time
consumed in doing it is sufficient for the charging and turning of a large mixer before the
concrete car or bucket returns to it. Here a large mixer, while it may stand idle part of the
time, is still economic.

The plant lay-outs vary with the local conditions, as the following will show. In one case
of a culvert located under a high, short trestle the following arrangement of plant was employed:
A platform located on each side of the approach embankment about 8 ft. below the ties was built
of old bridge timbers. A track was laid on each platform and ran out over a mixer located on
the end slope of the embankment. Two mixers, one for each platform, were used. From each mixer
a track led out over the culvert form and a track along the top of this form ran the full length
of the culvert. Gravel and sand were dumped from cars onto the side platforms and thence shoveled
into small bottom dump cars, which were pushed out over the mixer and dumped directly into
it. Cars on the short tracks from mixers to culvert form took the mixed concrete and dumped
it into the distributing cars traveling along the form. The cars were all hand pushed.

An entirely different lay-out was required in case of a long box culvert located in a flat
valley some 600 ft. from the track. A platform was built at the foot of the embankment with
its outer edge elevated high enough to clear two tracks carrying 5 cu. yd. dump cars. The sand
and gravel was dumped from cars onto the side of the embankment, running down onto the platform
so that scraper teams moved it to holes in the platform where it fell into the dump cars. These
cars were hauled by cable from the mixer engine and dumped at the foot of an inclined platform
leading to a hopper elevated sufficiently to let a 1½ cu. yd. dump car pass under it. A team
operating a drag scraper by cable moved the material up the inclined platform into the hopper,
whence it fell directly into the car to which cement was added at the same time. The charging
car was then pulled by the mixer engine up another incline, at the top of which it dumped into
the mixer. The concrete car was hauled up another incline to a track carried on the forms and
reaching the full length of the culvert work.

The placing of the reinforcement is given close supervision. When a wet concrete is used it
is found necessary to securely fasten the bars in place to prevent them being swept out of
place by the rush of the concrete. A method of supporting the invert bars is shown by Fig.
169; 2×2-in. stakes are large enough and they need never be spaced closer than 6 ft. The longitudinal
bars are held on the stakes by wire nails bent over and the transverse bars are wired to them
at intersections by stove pipe wire. The vertical wall bars are placed by thrusting the ends
into the soft footing concrete and nailing them to a horizontal timber at the top; the horizontal
wall bars are wired at intersections to the verticals. In the roof slab the stakes are replaced
by metal chairs, or by small notched blocks of concrete.

The form construction is shown by Fig. 169. It is not generally made in panels, since, as the
work runs, the locations of boxes of the same size are usually so far apart that transportation
charges are greater than the saving due to use a second time. No general rule is followed in
removing forms, but they can usually be taken down when the concrete is a week old.

The boxes are built in sections separated by vertical joints, one section being a day's work.
The vertical joints are plain butt joints; tongue and groove joints give trouble by the tenons
cracking off in the planes of the joints. A wet mixture is used and smooth faces obtained by
spading.

~ARCH CULVERT COSTS, N. C. & ST. L. RY.~--The cost of arch culvert construction for the Nashville,
Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. is recorded in a number of cases as follows:

~18-ft. Arch Culvert.~--Mr. H. M. Jones is authority for the following data: An 18-ft. full-centered
arch culvert was built by contract, near Paris, Tenn. The culvert was built under a trestle
65 ft. high, before filling in the trestle. The railway company built a pile foundation to
support a concrete foundation 2 ft. thick, and a concrete paving 20 ins. thick. The contractors
then built the culvert which has a barrel 140 ft. long. No expansion joints were provided,
which was a mistake for cracks have developed about 50 ft. apart. The contractors were given
a large quantity of quarry spalls which they crushed in part by hand, much of it being too
large for the concrete. The stone was shipped in drop-bottom cars and dumped into bins built
on the ground under the trestle. The sand was shipped in ordinary coal cars, and dumped or
shoveled into bins. The mixing boards were placed on the surface of the ground, and wheelbarrow
runways were built up as the work progressed. The cost of the 1,900 cu. yds. of concrete in
the culverts was as follows per cu. yd.:

1.01 bbls. Portland cement                 $2.26
0.56 cu. yds. of sand, at 60 cts.            .32
Loading and breaking stone                   .25
Lumber, centers, cement house and hardware   .64
Hauling materials                            .04
Mixing and placing concrete                 1.17
Carpenter work                               .19
Foreman (100 days at $2.50)                  .13
Superintendent (100 days at $5.50)           .29
                                           ------
Total per cu. yd.                          $5.29

It will be seen that only 19 cu. yds. of concrete were placed per day with a gang that appears
to have numbered about 21 laborers, who were negroes receiving about $1.10 per day. This was
the first work of its kind that the contractors had done. It will be noticed that the cost
of 42 cts. per cu. yd. for superintendence and foremanship was unnecessarily high.

~Six Arch Culverts 5 ft. to 16 ft. Span.~--All these arches were built under existing trestles,
and in all cases, except No. 2, bins were built on the ground under the trestle and the materials
were dumped from cars into the bins, loaded and delivered from the bins in wheelbarrows to
the mixing boards, and from the mixing boards carried in wheelbarrows to place. Negro laborers
were used in all cases, except No. 5, and were paid 90 cts. a day and their board, which cost
an additional 20 cts.; they worked under white foremen who received $2.50 to $3 a day and board.
In culvert No. 5, white laborers, at $1.25 without board, were used. There were two carpenters
at $2 a day and one foreman at $2.50 on this gang, making the average wage $1.47 each for all
engaged. The men were all green hands, in consequence of which the labor on the forms in particular
was excessively high. The high rate of daily wages on culverts Nos. 1 and 3 was due to the
use of some carpenters along with the laborers in mixing concrete. The high cost of mixing
concrete on culvert No. 2 was due to the rehandling of the materials which were not dumped
into bins but onto the concrete floor of the culvert and then wheeled out and stacked to one
side. The cost of excavating and back-filling at the site of each culvert is not included in
the table, but it ranged from 70 cts. to $2 per cu. yd. of concrete.

~14-ft. 9-in. Arch Culvert.~--Mr. W. H. Whorley gives the following methods and cost of constructing
a 12-ft. full centered arch culvert 204 ft. long. The culvert was built in three sections,
separated by vertical transverse joints to provide for expansion; the end sections were each
61 ft. long and the center section was 70 ft. long. Fig. 170 is a cross-section at the center;
for the end sections the height is 14 ft. 9 ins., the crown thickness is 1 ft. 9 ins., and
the side walls at their bases are 5 ft. thick. The concrete was a 1-3-6 mixture, using slag
aggregate for part of the work and stone aggregate for a part. The culvert was built underneath
a trestle which was afterwards filled in.

Mixing and Handling Concrete.--The height of the track above the valley permitted the mixing
plant to be so laid out that all material was moved by gravity from the cars in which it was
shipped until finally placed in the culvert. Sand and aggregate were received in drop bottom
cars and were unloaded into bins in the trestle. These bins had hopper bottoms with chutes
leading to a wheeling platform, which was placed between two trestle bents and extended over
a mixer placed outside the trestle. The cement house was erected alongside the trestle at the
wheeling platform level and a chute from an unloading platform at track level to the opposite
end of the house enabled the bags to be handled directly from the car to the chute and thence
run by gravity to the cement house. Sand and aggregate were chuted from the bins into wheelbarrows,
wheeled about 23 ft., and dumped into a hopper over the mixer. Water was pumped by a gasoline
engine from a well just below the trestle to a tank on the trestle, whence it was fed to the
mixer by a flexible connection, a valve so regulating the flow that the necessary amount was
delivered in the time required to mix a batch.

The mixer was a No. 5 Chicago Improved Cube Mixer, operated by a gasoline engine; a larger
size would have been preferable since a batch required only two-thirds of a bag of cement which
had to be measured which required the services of an additional man. The mixer was in operation
194 hours and mixed 7,702 batches (1,217 cu. yds.), or a batch every 87 seconds, or 6.3 cu.
yds. per hour. During the last ten days it mixed a batch every 78 seconds while running. The
best short record made was 291 batches in five hours, or one batch every 63 seconds, this being
at the rate of 58 batches equal to 9.2 cu. yds. of concrete in place per hour, or nearly 1/6
cu. yd. per batch. It took about ½ minute to mix the concrete and about the same length of
time to charge and discharge the mixer.

To convey the concrete from the mixer to the culvert walls a 1 cu. yd. drop bottom car was
used. This car ran on 30-in. gage tracks carried on a trestle straddling the culvert walls
and having its floor high enough to clear the arch. A track ran lengthwise of the trestle over
each culvert wall, and a cross track intersecting both with turntables ran to the mixer. Three
men handled the car, a round trip to the extreme end of the trestle being made in about 3 minutes.
In the meantime the mixer was discharging into a small hopper which unloaded into the car on
its return. One only of the three sections, of the culvert was built at a time, both walls
being brought up together. After a point had been reached about 2 ft. above the springing on
both walls, one track was removed and the other was shifted to the center of the trestle.

Forms.--There was used in the forms 15,000 ft. B. M. of 2-in. dressed lagging for face work,
21,000 ft. B. M. rough lumber for back work, and old car sills for studding. No charge was
made for studding except the cost of loading, the cost of the remaining lumber was $16 per
M. for dressed and $12.50 per M. for rough. A credit of one-third the cost was allowed for
the old material recovered. The total cost of the labor of erecting the material in forms,
bins and platforms was $666. The work was done by a bridge crew of white men, the average rate
of wages per man, including the bridge foreman's time, being $2.20 per day. In addition a mason
at $3.50 per day and a carpenter at $2.25 per day worked with the bridge crew in erecting forms.

Cost.--The cost of the 1,217 cu. yds. of concrete in the culvert was as follows:

~CULVERTS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION, WABASH RY.~--The following data relate to culvert work carried
out in constructing the Pittsburg extension of the Wabash Ry. in 1903. All the work was done
by contract.

Plant I: This plant was located on a hillside with the crushing bins above the loading floor
or platform which extended over the top of the mixer, so that the crushed stone could be drawn
directly from the chutes of the bins and wheeled to the mixer. The sand was hauled up an incline
in one-horse carts and dumped on this floor, and was also wheeled in barrows to the mixer.
The proportions used were 4 bags of cement, 4 barrows of sand and stone dust and 7 barrows
of crushed stone. A 7/8-cu. yd. mixer was used and it averaged 40 cu. yds. per 10-hour day

Assuming 1/3 ton of coal per day at $3 per ton, we have 2 cts. more per cubic yard for fuel.

Plant II.--At this plant a Smith mixer was used with a loading floor 4 ft. above the ground,
this low platform being made possible by having a hole or sump in which the skip receiving
the concrete was set. A derrick handled the skips between the sump and the work. The batch
was made up of 2 bags of cement, 2 barrows of sand and 4 barrows of stone. The output was 50
cu. yds. per day of 10 hours at the following cost:

Item.                                   Per day.  Per cu. yd.

The cost of fuel would add about 3 cts. per cubic yard to this amount.

~SMALL ARCH CULVERT COSTS, PENNSYLVANIA R. R.~--Mr. Alex. R. Holliday gives the following figures
of cost of small concrete culvert work carried out under his direction. The culvert section
used is shown in Fig. 171. This section gives a slightly larger waterway than a 36-in. cast
iron pipe. Eight culverts, having an aggregate length of 306 ft. were built, using a mixture
of Portland cement and limestone and screenings. Each culvert had a small spandrel wall at
each end.

The work was done by a gang of six men, receiving the following wages:

Foreman, cents per hour    27.5 Assistant  "    "    "     17.5 Laborers   "    "    "    
15.0 Teams      "    "    "     35.0

The materials were hauled about 1 mile from railway to site of work. Cement, including freight
and haulage, cost $1.97 per barrel. Limestone and screenings cost 50 cts. per cu. yd. f. o.
b. at quarry. No freight charges are included in cost of any of the materials except cement.
The cost of the 306 ft. of culvert was as follows:

Item.                   Total.  Per lin. ft.  Per cu. yd.

~12-FT. CULVERT, KALAMAZOO, MICH.~--A portion 1,080 ft. long of a new channel built in 1902-3
for a small stream flowing through the city of Kalamazoo, Mich., was constructed as an arch
culvert of the form shown by Fig. 172. The concrete section is reinforced on the lines indicated
by a double layer of woven steel wire fabric. The concrete was approximately a 1 cement, 6
sand and gravel mixture.

The centers were built in sections 12½ ft. long of the form and construction shown by Fig.
173, and a sufficient number was provided to lay twelve sections of invert and six sections
of arch. The arch centers were arranged to be uncoupled at the crown; this with the hinges
at the quarter points permitted the two halves to be separated and each half to be folded so
that it could be carried from the rear of the work through the forms still in place and erected
again for new work. When in place the center ribs rested on the side forms which set on the
invert concrete and are braced apart by the hinged cross-strut. This cross-strut was the key
that bound the whole structure together; the method of removing this key is indicated by Fig.
174. From his experience with these centers the engineer of the work, Mr. Geo. S. Pierson, remarks:

"In work of this kind it is very important to have the centering absolutely rigid so it will
not spring when concrete is being tamped against it and thus weaken the cohesion of the concrete.
It is also important to have the arrangement such that all the centering can be removed without
straining or jarring the fresh concrete. The centers were generally removed in about three
or four days after the concrete arch was in place."

The invert concrete was brought to form by means of templates, Fig. 173, and straight edges.
The side forms were then placed and braced apart by the struts and concreting continued to
the skewback plane indicated in Fig. 173. The arch form was then placed; it rested at the edges
on the side forms and was further supported by center posts bearing on boards laid on the bottom
of the invert. A template, Fig. 175, was used to get the proper thickness and form of arch
ring. Outside forms were used to confine the concrete at the haunches but nearer the crown
they were not required.

Much of the work was done when the thermometer, during working hours, ranged from 12° to 25°
above zero. When the temperature was below freezing, hot water was used in mixing the concrete
and on a few of the coldest days salt was dissolved in the water. In addition each section
of the work was covered with oiled canvas as soon as completed, and the conduit was kept closed
so far as was practicable to retain the heat. Concreting was never stopped on account of cold
weather.

Account was kept of the cost of all work, and the figures obtained are given in the following
tables:

~METHOD AND COST OF MOLDING CULVERT PIPE, CHICAGO & ILLINOIS WESTERN R. R.~--During 1906, the
Chicago & Illinois Western R. R., Mr. O. P. Chamberlain, Chief Engineer, built a number of
culverts of concrete pipe with an interior diameter of 4 ft., and 6-in. shells. Fig. 176 shows
the forms in which the pipe was molded. Both forms are of ordinary wooden tank construction.
The inner form has one wedge-shaped loose stave which is withdrawn after the concrete has set
for about 20 hours, thus collapsing the inner form and allowing it to be removed. The outer
form is built in two pieces with 2×5/8-in. semi-circular iron hoops on the outside, the hoops
having loops at the ends. The staves are fastened to the hoops by wood screws 1¾ ins. long
driven from the outside of the hoop. When the two sides of the outer form are in position,
the loops on one side come into position just above the loops on the other side, and four ¾-in.
steel pins are inserted in the loops to hold the two sides together while the form is being
filled with concrete and while the concrete is setting. After the inner form has been removed,
the two pins in the same vertical line are removed and the form opened horizontally on the
hinges formed by the loops and pins on the opposite side. The inner and outer forms are then
ready to be set up for building another pipe.

The concrete used in manufacturing these pipes was composed of American Portland cement, limestone
screenings and crushed limestone that has passed through a ¾-in. diameter screen after everything
that would pass through a ½-in. diameter screen had been removed. The concrete was mixed in
the proportions of one part cement to three and one-half parts each of screenings and crushed
stone. All work except the building of the forms was performed by common laborers. In his experimental
work Mr. Chamberlain used two laborers, one of whom set the forms, and filled them and the
other of whom mixed the concrete. The pipes were left in the forms till the morning of the
day after molding. The two laborers removed the forms filled the day before, the first thing
in the morning, and proceeded to refill them. The average time the concrete was allowed to
set before the forms were removed was 16 hours. Mr. Chamberlain believes that with three men
and six forms the whole six forms could be removed and refilled daily. Based on the use of
only two forms with two laborers removing and refilling them each day, and on the assumption
that a single set of forms costing $40 can be used only 50 times before being replaced, Mr.
Chamberlain estimates the cost of molding 4-ft. pipes as follows:

2 per cent, of $40 for forms                  $0.80
1.1 cu. yds. stone and screenings at $1.85     2.04
0.8 bbls. cement at $2.10                      1.68
10 hours' labor at 28 cts.                     2.80
                                              -----
  Total per pipe                              $7.32

This gives a cost of $1.83 per lineal foot of pipe or practically $7 per cu. yd. of concrete.
The pipe actually molded cost $2.50 per lin ft., or $9.62 per cu. yd. of concrete, owing to
the small scale on which the work was carried on--the laborers were not kept steadily at work.

The pipes were built under a derrick and loaded by means of the derrick upon flat cars for
transportation. At the culvert site they were unloaded and put in by an ordinary section gang
with no appliances other than skids to remove the pipes from the cars. As each four-foot section
of this pipe weighs about two tons, it was not deemed expedient to build sections of a greater
length than 4 ft., to be unloaded and placed by hand. On a trunk line, however, where a derrick
car is available for unloading and placing the pipes, there is no reason why they should not
be built in 6 or 8-ft. sections.

If we set aside concrete block construction, virtually all concrete used in building construction
is reinforced; plain monolithic or mass concrete now, as in the past, is one of the secondary
building materials. It is reinforced concrete building construction that is discussed in this
chapter. In no class of concrete work is the contractor's responsibility for the successful
outcome of the work greater than in reinforced concrete building construction. No degree of
excellence in design can make up for incompetent, careless or dishonest work in construction.
This is true not merely in the general way that it is true of all engineering construction--it
is true in a special way peculiar to the material. Except for the reinforcing steel, the contractor
for concrete building work has no guarantee of the quality of any element of his work except
his own faithful care in performing every task that combines to produce that element. The quality
of his concrete depends upon the care with which he has chosen his cement, sand and stone,
and on the perfection with which he has incorporated them into a homogeneous mixture. The quality
of his beam or column, then, depends upon the care with which the concrete is placed in position
with the reinforcement and with which the supporting forms are maintained until the member
is amply strong to do without support. There is no certainty of any detail except the certainty
that is had by performing every part of the work as experience has taught that it should be
performed if perfect results are to be attained. We have dwelt thus emphatically on the responsibility
in concrete building work of the contractor for the reason that in the past it has been upon
the contractor that the burden of failure has been generally shifted.

The construction work of buildings is divided into (1) construction, erection and removal of
forms; (2) fabrication and placing of reinforcement; (3) mixing, transporting and placing concrete.

CONSTRUCTION, ERECTION AND REMOVAL OF FORMS.

The stereotyped text-book statement that forms must be true to dimensions and shape and rigid
enough in construction to maintain this condition under all loads that they have to sustain
mentions only one of the factors that the constructing engineer or the contractor has to keep
in mind in designing such forms. His design must be made true and rigid at the least possible
cost for first construction of lumber and carpenter work; it must be made with the plan in
mind of using either the same forms as a whole or the same form material several times in one
structure; it must be made with a view to convenience in taking down, carrying and re-erecting
the forms the second or third time; and it must be made with the object in sight of securing
the greatest salvage value either in forms fit for use again or in form lumber that can be
sold or worked up for other purposes.

The general conditions governing the computation and design of economic form work are discussed
in Chapter IX.

~COLUMN FORMS.~--Concrete columns are usually square or rectangular in section, with, commonly,
chamfered or beveled corners. The popularity of these sections is due very largely to the simplicity
of the forms required. When hooped reinforcement is used, the column section is always circular
or polygonal. Hollow sections, T-section and channel sections are rarely employed and then
only for wall columns.

Column forms should be made in units which can readily be assembled, taken apart and re-assembled.
The number, arrangement and size of the units are determined by the shape and size of the column
and the means adopted for handling the forms. For square or rectangular columns there will
be usually four units of lagging, one for each side, plus the number of clamps or yokes used
to bind the sides together. Yokes or clamps will seldom be spaced over 3 ft. apart unless very
heavy lagging is used; 2 ft. spacing for yokes is common. For circular columns two units of
lagging are necessary and this is the number commonly used; the yokes or hoops are spaced about
as for rectangular columns. Metal forms can be used to good advantage for cylindrical columns.
Forms for polygonal columns are difficult to construct in convenient units. Forms built complete
a full story high and concreted from the top are essential where wet and sloppy concretes are
used. In Europe, where comparatively dry concretes are employed and where the reinforcement
is commonly placed a piece at a time as concreting progresses, three sides of a rectangular
form are erected full height and the fourth side is built up as the concrete and metal are
placed. This construction is now less common, even abroad, than it was, since wetter mixtures
are coming to be approved by European engineers to a greater extent now than formerly. It is
a time consuming method and with wet mixtures it has nothing to recommend it. For lagging 1¼
and 2-in. plank are commonly used; with yokes spaced 2 ft. apart the lighter plank is amply
strong and reduces the weight of the units to be handled as well as the amount of form lumber
required.

Column forms should always be constructed with an opening at the bottom by means of which the
reinforcement can be adjusted and sawdust, shavings and other material cleaned out.

~Rectangular Columns.~--The form shown in section by Fig. 177 was used in constructing a factory
building at Cincinnati, O. Two 2×4-in. studs at each corner carry the horizontal side lagging
boards and are clamped together by yokes composed of four hardwood corner saddles connected
around the form by a hooked rod with center turnbuckle on each side. No nails are used in assemblying
the parts; the same studding and yokes serve for several sizes of column, the lagging alone
being changed. The lumber required for studding is 5½ ft. B. M. per foot of column length.
The lumber required for lagging, using 1 in. boards, would be 2-2/3 ft. B. M. for a 12-in.
column, and 2/3 ft. B. M. would be added for every 2-in. increase in size of the column. About
3½ ft. B. M. is required for each set of four corner saddles. With the studs rabbeted at the
mill, the carpenter work is reduced to the simple task of sawing the boards and struts to length.
The form is taken down by simply unscrewing the turnbuckles; it can be erected by common labor
in charge of one carpenter to attend to the plumbing and truing-up. The form can be used over
and over and for columns of different sizes without change except in the length of the lagging
boards.

The form shown by Fig. 178 was used in constructing a nine-story warehouse at St. Paul, Minn.;
it is a design which has become almost standard with a number of large building contractors.
In this construction lagging boards the full length of the column are used and are held without
nails by yokes. The yokes consist of two heads of wood held together by threaded rods with
nuts; between the rods and the lagging are struts or blocks serving both as spacers and to
hold the lagging to plane and surface. The yoke proper is adjustable to the extent of the threaded
portions of the tie rods. It is to be noticed that the lagging boards are not connected by
battens or cleats, therefore, two or three widths of stock serve for all ordinary changes in
size of columns and carpenter work is limited to sawing them to length. Furthermore as the
boards are full column length, their salvage value when removed from the forms is high. Common
laborers under a carpenter foreman can assemble and erect the form. For a 12-in. column and
using 3×4-in. yokes spaced 2 ft. apart and 1¼-in. lagging, this form requires about 12 ft.
B. M. of lumber per foot length of column. The column form shown by Fig. 226 for the six-story
building described in a succeeding section differs from the one described only in the details
of the yoke construction. In place of the struts between the wooden heads of the yoke a cleat
is nailed across the projecting ends which has to be pried loose every time the yoke is removed
and nailed into place again every time the yoke is put onto another form; these repeated nailings
soon destroy the yoke heads. This form as constructed requires about 8¾ ft. B. M. of lumber
per foot length of 12-in. column, which is 3¼ ft. B. M. less than is required for the form
shown by Fig. 177. The saving comes entirely in the yoke construction.

The form shown by Fig. 238 is of the same general type as are the two just described, the chief
difference in detail being in the yoke construction and in the forming of the lagging boards
into a panel or unit for each side by means of battens. This panel construction makes a lagging
unit which is more convenient to handle, but less convenient to adapt to changes in size of
column. The salvage value of the lumber is also reduced by the nailing. Assuming 1¼-in. lagging
and a yoke spacing of 2 ft., to permit direct comparison, this form requires 10½ ft. B. M.
of lumber per foot length of 12-in. column as compared with 12 ft. B. M. for the form shown
by Fig. 177 and 8¾ ft B. M. for the form shown by Fig. 178. As actually constructed with 2-in.
lagging the form shown by Fig. 238 requires about 14 ft. B. M. of lumber per foot length of
12-in. column.

The French constructor, Hennebique, uses the column form construction shown by Fig. 179. Three
sides of the forms are built full length of vertical plank and the fourth is built up of horizontal
lagging nailed on a board at a time as concreting progresses. In place of rectangular yokes,
steel clamps of special form are used to hold the lagging in place. To tear down this form
requires drawing the nails in the horizontal lagging and the knocking loose of the clamps.
The vertical lagging is of necessity connected by battens into panels to make it possible to
hold it in place by the form of clamp used. This form seems to offer no particular merits to
American eyes: there is practically no saving in lumber over forms with rectangular yokes and
the clamp shown, while adjustable, is not nearly so rigid and secure a bond for the lagging
as is a good yoke.

The form shown by Fig. 180 is an extreme example of nailed construction throughout, no yokes
or clamps being used. It was used in constructing a factory building in New York City. Horizontal
lagging nailed to vertical studs was used for all four sides; three sides were built up full
height and the fourth side was placed a board at a time as concreting progressed. This form
required 7-1/3 ft. B. M. of lumber per foot length of 12-in. column, which is probably about
as low in lumber as column form construction can be got. The labor of tearing down and re-erecting
the form would be high as also would the waste of lumber. Nailed forms of this type are rarely
used.

The form shown by Fig. 181 was used for molding T-section wall columns for a power station.
It is noteworthy for its section; because of the provision for molding grooves in the two sides
to which the curtain walls join, and because of the manner in which three of the eight sides
were built up as the concreting progressed. The sides a b c, d e and f g h were erected in
full column units and the sides c d, e f and h a were erected in sections 2 ft. high as concreting
progressed. The yokes were spaced 2 ft. apart. Using 1¼-in. stuff for yokes and lagging this
form as built required about 16 ft. B. M. per foot length of column. Except for the beveling
of the mold for the curtain wall recesses, the framing is all plain saw and hammer work.

A corner wall column form is shown by Fig. 182 and as this was an example of hollow column
work the section of the concrete within the form is shown. Forms of this shape and of T-section
are properly classed as special form work so that the examples given here are helpful merely
as indicating general methods that may be followed. This particular form required 15¾ ft-B.
M. of 7/8-in. lagging per foot of column length, and, neglecting the special top frame, about
16 ft. B. M. of "staging" per foot to support the lagging. The core forms for molding the hollow
spaces in the columns of this particular building are shown in Fig. 183. The cross pieces or
keys carried on the 5/8-in. bolts as pivots are revolved a quarter turn to slip clear of the
slots and permit the sides to close together and free the core for withdrawal. In many cases
the contractor will find it preferable to use thin sheet metal core molds or light wooden cores
and leave them in place. In one case known to the authors where hollow wall columns were used
as hot air ducts for a heating system the duct was laid up of one row of bricks, encircled
by the column form and the annular space concreted around the brick duct as a core. The rare
use of irregular columns makes form and core construction for them a special problem requiring
special detailed estimates in each case. The channel section wall column form shown by Fig.
230 is a case in point; here the form became practically a portable mold for duplicating columns
as many times as was desired.

As an example of form work for very large columns or pillars that shown by Fig. 184 is particularly
good; it was used for constructing eight 3-ft. square pillars for a water tank tower. The lagging
consists of four panels made by nailing horizontal boards to vertical studs. The panels are
clamped together by rectangular yokes spaced 3 ft. apart. There are nearly 27½ ft. B. M. of
lumber per foot length of 3-ft. column in this form.

The form shown by Fig. 185 was used by Mr. R. W. Maxton in constructing a large factory building
at St. Louis, Mo., and is notable for the means adopted for centering the forms and for reducing
their lateral dimensions to fit them for molding the decreasingly smaller columns of the upper
floors. To center the forms the short angles A A are molded into the concrete so as to project
slightly above the tops of the floor slab. Also the pieces of wood C are molded into the floor
slab. The form is set over the angles and lined up truly by nailing the blocks B to the blocks
C. It will be noticed also that the column mold bears only at the four corners the lagging
being cut away somewhat on each side so as to afford an opening for cleaning. The lagging for
the sides of the column mold is battened together to form four units or panels which are held
together by iron clamps of the form shown. Lag screws are used everywhere in place of nails.
The notable feature, however, is the piecing out of the lagging panels with 1-in. strips, one
or more of which can be ripped off on each side to reduce the size of the forms as the columns
grow smaller toward the top of the building.

~Polygonal Columns.~--Forms for polygonal columns require more lumber and more carpenter work
and are less susceptible of ready arrangement into units than forms for rectangular columns.
There is no approach to a uniform practice in their construction and the few forms shown here
are merely specific examples.

The form shown by Fig. 186 was used for interior columns of octagonal section with hooped reinforcement
for a factory building. This form for a 12-ft. octagonal column 24 ins. across between sides
requires approximately 325 ft. B. M. of lumber. The form shown by Fig. 187 was used by the
same engineer in another building; it is, as will be noted, in four units coming apart in joints
at diagonally opposite corners. This form for an octagonal column 18 in. across between sides
required about 13 ft. B. M. of lumber per foot of column length, with yokes spaced 3½ ft. apart.

The form shown by Fig. 188 was used in a large warehouse at Chicago, Ill. It will be noted
from the dotted lines that one yoke clamps the sides a a, the next the sides b b and so on.
This does away with triangular blocking to hold the corner boards that is used in the form
shown by Fig. 187. Six pairs of yokes were used for each column so that the yoke spacing was
about 2 ft. With 2×6-in. yokes and 1½-in lagging a form for a column 18 ins. between sides
would require some 17 ft. B. M. per foot of column length.

~Circular Columns.~--Circular columns have been most frequently molded in steel forms, and
these are by all odds the best for general work. Made in two parts of sheet steel and in sections
that are set end to end one on another a form is obtained which is easy to erect, remove and
transport. Wood forms for circular columns are rather clumsy affairs and are expensive to construct.
Such a form, Fig. 190, is described in the succeeding section; another is shown by Fig. 189.
This form was used successfully for filling and encasing steel columns for a fireproof building
in Chicago, Ill., and is a favorite circular form construction in Europe. It is apparent that
the hooping needs to be very heavy and that the form is one that will be hard to handle and
rather expensive to make.

In several instances, where hooped reinforcement has been used, the hooping has been wrapped
with, or made of, expanded metal or other mesh-+work, and the concrete deposited inside the
cylinder thus formed, without other form work. A six-story factory building in Brooklyn, N.
Y., was built with circular interior columns from 28 ins. to 12 ins. in diameter, reinforced
by a cylinder of No. 10 3-in. mesh expanded metal, stiffened lengthwise by four round rods
1 in. in diameter for larger columns to ½ in. in diameter for smaller columns. This reinforcement
was set in place and wrapped with No. 24 ½-in. mesh metal lath, and the cylinder was filled
with concrete and plastered outside. A moderately dry concrete is essential for such construction.

The method of molding shells with the hooping embedded described for the Bush terminal factory
work in another section is another way of avoiding form work of the usual type.

Light steel forms as well as the special construction noted must be supplemented by staging
to hold them in line and to carry the ends of the girder forms that are ordinarily carried
by the column forms. Four uprights arranged around the column so as to come under the connecting
girders are commonly used; they are set close enough to the column to hold the form plumb by
means of blocks or wedges.

~Ornamental Columns.~--Forms for ornamental columns call for special design and construction.
For many purposes, such as porch and portico work, the best plan is to mold the columns separately
and erect them as stone columns of like character are erected. Metal forms of various patterns
are made by firms manufacturing concrete block molds and can be purchased from stock or made
to order. Where the column is to be molded in place form construction becomes a matter of pattern
making, the complexity and cost of which depends entirely upon the architectural form and ornament
to be reproduced. The molding of ornament and architectural forms in concrete is discussed
in Chapter XXIII, and the two examples of ornamental column form work given here from recent
work indicate the task before the builder.

The form shown by Fig. 190 was used for molding in place fluted columns used in a court house
constructed at Mineola, N. Y. The lagging in the form of staves forms a 24-sided polygon and
is held in position by hoops and yokes. The molds for the flutes were formed by inserting screws
from the outside so as to penetrate the staves and molding half-round ribs of plaster of Paris
over them by means of the simple device shown. To dismantle the form the screws were removed
and the lagging taken down leaving the plaster of Paris in place as a protection to the thin
edges until the final finishing of the building.

The methods illustrated by Fig. 191 were employed in molding columns in place for a church
at Oak Park, Ill. The bottom portions of these columns were plain square sections molded in
place in square molds. The top portions were heavily paneled. The four corner segments were
cast in glue molds backed by wood with wires embedded as shown. After becoming hard they were
set on end on the plain column and tied and braced as shown. The side openings were then closed
by wooden forms and the interior space was filled with concrete. The surface facing for these
columns was bird's-eye gravel and cement, with very little sand, mixed very dry and placed
and tamped with the coarse concrete backing.

~SLAB AND GIRDER FORMS.~--Slab and girder construction for roofs and floors is of three kinds:
(1) Concrete slab and steel beam construction in place; (2) concrete slab and girder construction
in place (3) separately molded slab and beam construction. The third method of construction
is distinct from the others in respect to form work as well as other details and is considered
separately in Chapter XX.

~Slab and I-Beam Floors.~--Centers for floor slabs between steel I-beams are made by suspending
joists from the beam flanges and covering them with lagging. Frequently the joists and lagging
are framed together into panels of convenient size for carrying and erecting. The construction
is a simple one in either case where slabs without haunches or plain arches form the filling
between beams. Figure 192 shows an arch slab center; plain hook bolts, with a nut on the lower
end, passing through holes in the joists are more commonly employed. For 1-in. lagging the
joist spacing is 2 ft., for 1½-in lagging, 4 ft., and for 2-in. lagging, 5 ft.

A more complex centering is required where the slab has to be haunched around the I-beams.
The center shown by Fig. 193 was designed by Mr. W. A. Etherton for the floor construction
of the U. S. Postoffice Building erected at Huntington, W. Va., in 1905. The center consists
essentially of the pieces A (2×4 ins. for spans not exceeding 6 ft.) and the 2×3-in. triggers
B, which rest on the lower flanges of the floor beams and thus support the forms. The trigger
is secured at one end to the piece A by a 1×3-in. cleat C and at the other end by 1×3-in. cleats
D on either side of A, which serve also as supports for the batter boards E. The six-penny
nail F is but partly driven and it is to be drawn before removing the forms. When the supports
of the beams are not fireproofed the cleats D extend to the bottom of the trigger B, but otherwise
one cleat extends lower to secure the cross-strip G. To remove the forms, draw the partly driven
nail F; knock off the strip G or loosen it enough to draw the nails in B>; pull the triggers
on one beam, and the forms will drop. If the soffit board H is used it is necessary first to
remove the strip G. For larger beams use the spacing blocks H as shown; for smaller beams omit
the trigger B and extend A to rest on the flange of the beam, then to remove the form A must
be cut preferably near the beam.

No complete records of the cost of these forms were obtained, but the following partial information
is furnished by Mr. Etherton: Considering a panel 6 ft. span by 19 ft. long on 15-in. I-beams,
the lumber consisting of 1-in. boards supported by 2×4-in. cross-pieces on 2×3-in. triggers
spread 3 ft. on centers, soffit of beams not fireproofed, it required one carpenter five hours
at 30 cts. per hour to complete the panel. Figuring from this alone I should say that 10 cts.
per sq. yd. is a fair estimate for carpenter work. In working over the forms for another floor
the 1-in. boards require more time to handle and I should say that the saving in cost of work
over the first floor would be not over 2 cts. per sq. yd. Two laborers moved their scaffolding
and took down the forms from three completed panels of 13 sq. yds. each in one hour. Smaller
panels require a longer time per yard. Counting for the proper piling of lumber I should allow
one hour for one man to take down the forms for a 13-sq. yd. panel when conditions are the
best. We contracted with two laborers to remove the forms from the third floor and roof and
pile them in good shape on the ground just outside of the building for an amount averaging
about 4½ cts. per sq. yd., and the men made but small wages on the contract. The lumber was
used on three floors and the roof, and the best of the 1-in. boards and all of the 2×4-in.
and 2×3-in. stuff were used on a second job. For a safe estimate based on the data secured
I should figure the cost of labor and materials for a three or four-story building about as
follows:

                                       Per sq. yd.
Lumber at $20 per thousand              28 cts.
Carpenter work at 30 cts. per hour      10 cts.
Labor tearing down at 15 cts. per hour   4 cts.
                                        -------
Total per square yard                   42 cts.

Figure 194 shows an arrangement of centering between steel beams which is novel in that it
provides for molding a slab with girders. The form was used in building the roof of a locomotive
roundhouse. This roundhouse was of the usual circular form and had a radial width of 80 ft.
Each radial roof girder, which was an 18-in. I-beam was carried by an outside wall pier and
three I-beam columns encased in concrete. The space between main roof girders was spanned by
reinforced concrete girders and roof slab. The center illustrated was employed for molding
the concrete girders and slab, and carries out the idea of making a stiff and light center
for considerable spans of slab without support by staging. The truss construction of the frames
supporting the girder box will be noted.

~Concrete Slab and Girder Floors.~--The construction of forms for this type of floor should
be such that the slab centers and the sides of the girder molds can be removed without disturbing
the bottoms of the girder molds. This permits the beams to be supported as long as desirable
and at the same time releases the greater part of the form work for use again. It is of advantage
also to lay bare the concrete as soon as possible to the hardening action of the free air.
The slabs may be similarly supported by uprights wedged up against plank caps; no very great
amount of lumber is required for this staging and it gives a large assurance of safety. It
is well also to give the girder molds a camber or to crown them to allow for settling of the
falsework.

The form shown by Fig. 195 was used in constructing girders from 14 to 23 ft. long in a factory
building at Cincinnati, O. The sides are separate from the bottom, being supported at the ends
by cleats on the column form and at intermediate points by struts under the yokes. The floor
lagging is carried by 2×4-in. stringers supported by the yokes. Uprights set under the bottom
plank keep the girder supported after the sides and slab centers are removed. It will be noted
that the form is given a camber of 1-in. The structural details are evident from the drawing.
The form shows a method of molding a bracket for wind bracing; a simple modification fits it
for molding girders without brackets. A rough computation gives 10 ft. B. M. of lumber per
lineal foot of girder form as shown.

The form construction shown in Fig. 196 was employed in building the slab and girder floors
for the United Shoe Machinery Co.'s factory at Beverly, Mass. In these buildings the main girders
cross the building at 20-ft. intervals and midway between the main girders is a bridging beam
also reaching across the building. Floor beams span the 10-ft. spaces between bridging beams
and main girders at intervals of 3 and 4 ft. Referring first to the main girder form, tall
horses are set up at 3-ft. intervals and connected by stringers laid on the caps. These stringers
carry a cross piece, with a cleat at each end, over each horse. The bottom boards of the mold
rest on these cross pieces and the side pieces are set up between verticals wedged tight between
the cleats. The beam molds are a modification of the girder molds. The slab centers consist
of panels just large enough to span the openings between beams and girders and composed of
1-in. boards fastened together by four 1×5-in. cleats. Except in attaching the quarter round
and triangular moldings for fillets no nailing is necessary in erecting and taking down the forms.

The form construction shown by Fig. 197 is one used by a large firm of reinformed concrete
builders. The slab centers can be struck and the sides of the girder mold removed without disturbing
the support for the bottom of the beam. This form runs quite low in lumber, requiring for a
9×12-in. beam box including posts some 9 ft. B. M. per lineal foot of box. The joists and lagging
as shown require about 2 ft. B. M. per square foot of floor slab. The practice is to give these
girder boxes a camber of ½-in. in 10 ft.

The construction shown by Fig. 198 is designed to provide adjustability, to enable quick erection
and removal and to do away with all nailing. The construction is as follows: Wooden posts carry
at their tops steel T-beam cross-arms knee braced to the posts by steel straps. The cross-arms
carry the two jaws of a clamp, each consisting of a vertical plate, and two diagonal braces,
slotted so as to slide on the T-beam. A cut nail or other piece of metal driven into the slots
fastens the jaws on the T-beam. The cross-arms carry the bottom boards of the girder molds
and the vertical plates of the jaws support the side pieces. A blocking piece slipped between
the braces carries the end of the joist for the floor slab centers. This form is the invention
of Mr. W. H. Dillon and was used in constructing the nine-story, 260×150-ft. wholesale hardware
store Of Farwell, Osman & Kirk Co., St. Paul, Minn.

The form shown by Fig. 199 was used in constructing a factory building in Long Island City,
N. Y., and it is given here chiefly for the purpose of exhibiting the unnecessary complexity
of form work. Comparing this form with that of nearly any of the preceding designs will bring
out the point. The design, however, was one of the earlier ones to recognize the advantage
of stripping the slab centers and the sides of the girder boxes without disturbing the bottom
plank of the boxes or the staging. The drawing shows the independent support of the bottom
board and side pieces of the girder mold on the transverse caps of the staging posts. These
posts are 6×8 ins. in section and are spaced from 6 to 8 ft. apart. Briefly described the bottom
board is a single plank from 1 to 3 ins. thick, to which the side pieces are lag-screwed at
the bottom. The side pieces are panels composed of 4×7/8-in. vertical boards nailed to top
and bottom 2×4-in. horizontal timbers. A third horizontal timber near the top serves as a seat
for the ends of the joists carrying the slab lagging and is braced from the bottom horizontal
by vertical stiffeners. The edge boards of the slab lagging are nailed to the top edges of
the side pieces of the girder mold and the tops of these side pieces are connected across the
trough by strips of board; all the slab lagging boards except those at the edges of the girder
molds are laid loose. In the building referred to, after the floor concrete had set about seven
days the joists carrying the slab lagging were turned a quarter over thus dropping the slab
form about 2 ins. A few days later the joists and lagging were taken down and the side pieces
of the girder mold were unscrewed and removed. The bottom board and staging posts were left
in position about three weeks longer and then dropped about 1 in. by removing fillers from
the staging post caps. In another week the bottom boards and staging posts were taken down.
This construction of form and method of removing it permitted the concrete to be stripped so
that the air could get at it as fast as it was safe to take the support from any part and at
the same time kept the supports in such position that they form a safety platform in case of
collapse. A more important advantage is that the form timber can be removed as fast as any
part of it is free and used again. Thus the lagging boards and joists and the side pieces for
the girder molds were free for use again about every two weeks and yet the main supports of
the girders were undisturbed until they were fully a month old.

Other examples of girder and slab forms are shown in the succeeding sections describing the
construction of a six-story building and of a garage constructed at Philadelphia, Pa.

Another type of slab and girder form construction that deserves brief mention because of its
variation from usual practice and also because of its extensive use by one prominent builder
is shown by Fig. 200. Cores, or inverted boxes, with four vertical sides and rounded corners,
are set side by side, with ends on stringers carried by the column forms, at intervals wide
enough to enable the beam to be molded between. A plank resting on cleats on the sides of the
cores forms the bottom of the beam mold. The main girders are molded in similar spaces between
the ends of the cores in one panel and of those in the next panel. To permit the core to be
loosened readily it is hinged; when in place spacers inside the core keep the sides from closing.
These are knocked out, the core sides close together and the core is removed for use in another
place. Cores similar to these were used in molding the ribbed floor for the Bush terminal factory
building described in a succeeding section. These cores are capable of repeated use so that
while they are somewhat expensive to frame they give a very low cost of form work when the
beam and girder spacing is arranged largely in duplicate from floor to floor. It will ordinarily
be cheaper to have these cores made to pattern by regular woodworking shops, and shipped to
the building ready to erect.

~WALL FORMS.~--Wall work in modern commercial and manufacturing buildings, when we come to
eliminate windows and wall columns and girders, is confined very largely to isolated curtain
wall panels between windows and framework. In such buildings, therefore, wall forms consist
merely of wooden panels, one for each face of the wall, constructed to fit the spaces to be
walled up. Where these spaces are duplicated from bay to bay or story to story the same form
panels will serve repeatedly. For residences and other buildings having greater proportionate
area of blank wall the builder has a choice between continuous forms carried by staging and
movable panel forms.

For one and two-story buildings, with the usual variation in architectural detail, panel work
and window work, the continuous form has many advantages, and the superior economy of movable
panels in retaining and other plain wall work is by no means always true here. One good type
of continuous wall form construction is shown by Fig. 201. The gallows frames are spaced about
6 ft. apart along the wall and connected by horizontal stringers nailed to the uprights or
by diagonal bracing. Each frame may be made up of 6×6-in. posts connected by 2×4-in. cross-struts
and diagonals with bolted connections so that the frame can be taken down and put together
easily and so that the bracing can be removed as the wall is built upward. The other details
of the form work are shown by the drawing. This construction leaves a clear space for placing
the concrete and the cross pieces give support to runways; it has been successfully used in
a large amount of low building work.

Movable panel forms are of great variety in detail but are generally of either one or the other
types shown by Figs. 202 to 204.

The form shown by Fig. 202 was used in constructing a church at Oak Park, Ill. For the back
of the wall it consists of continuous lagging held by 2×4 studs. For the face 1×6-in. lagging
12 ft. long was nailed to 2×4-in. studs to form panels. It will be noted that the ends of the
studs are scarfed so as to interlock in succeeding panels. This construction also shows a method
of supporting the reinforcing bars inside the form.

The form shown by Fig. 203 was used in constructing a large factory building, and consisted
of two side pieces or panels 3 ft. high and 16 ft. long, the distance between wall columns.
For the first course these were seated on the carefully leveled and rammed ground and securely
braced by inclined or horizontal struts inside and outside of the building. After the concrete
had set for three days the molds were loosened and lifted until the lower edges were 2 ins.
below the top of the concrete and there they were held by horizontal bolts through their lower
edges and across the top of the concrete by ties nailed across their tops every 3 ft. and by
bracing to the falseworks supporting the column and floor forms. The cross bolts passed through
pasteboard sleeves which were left permanently embedded in the wall. By starting the molds
level and finishing each course level with their tops no difficulty was had in keeping the
forms plumb and to level as they were moved upward. This type of form has to be exteriorly
braced to staging or adjacent column forms, etc.

The type of movable panel form shown by Fig. 204 depends for all support on the wall alone.
The sketch shows the form filled ready to be shifted upward; this operation consists in removing
the bottom bolts and loosening the top bolts enough to permit the studs to be slid upward the
full length of the slots. The lagging boards left free are then removed and placed on top and
the bolts are tightened, completing the form for another section of wall.

A type of wall form construction intended to do away with studding and bracing is illustrated
by Figs. 205 and 206. In both cases metal plank holders are used in place of studs, and practically
the only difference between the two is in the shape and material of the holders. The mode of
procedure is to work in horizontal courses one plank high around the wall, removing the bottom
plank and placing it on top as each new course is begun after the first few courses have been
laid. Using the arrangement shown by Fig. 205 in constructing a building 100×54 ft. in plan
and 36 ft. high with 12-in. walls, a height of two 12×2-in planks was all the form work that
was ever necessary at any one time, so that the amount of form lumber required for the building
was 2,464 ft. B. M. plus 205 ft. B. M. of 2×4-in. flooring strip, or altogether 2,669 ft. B.
M., or 0.24 ft. B. M. per square foot of exterior wall surface, or 6½ ft. B. M. per cubic yard
of concrete. This same form lumber with 16 additional plank was then used to construct a building
100×100 ft.×16 ft. high, so that some 3,000 ft. of form lumber sufficed for 17,548 sq. ft.
(exterior surface) of wall or for 617 cu. yds. of concrete in 12-in. wall, which gives 0.17
ft. B. M. per square foot or 4.8 ft. B. M. per cubic yard of concrete.

~ERECTING FORMS.~--The organization of the erecting gang will depend very largely on the manner
in which the forms have been constructed. If they have been constructed in sections which go
together with wedges and clamps common laborers with a foreman carpenter in charge to direct
and to line and level the work will do the erecting, but if they have to be largely built in
place carpenters are necessary for all the work except carrying and handing. There should be
at least one foreman for every 15 to 20 men and a head foreman in charge of all form work.
The mode of procedure will differ for every job, but the following general directions apply
to all work in greater or less measure.

Clamps, bolts and wedges and not nails should be used wherever possible in assembling parts
of forms in erection; these devices are not only quickly and easily applied in erection but
they are just as quickly and easily loosened in taking down forms and they can be loosened
without jarring the concrete member.

Lining girder forms and lining and plumbing column and wall forms is high-class carpenter work
and should be directed by competent carpenters. A column or girder which is out of line or
plumb not only looks bad but may be required to be removed and corrected by the engineer. The
expense for one such correction will be many times that which would have been involved by proper
care in the first place.

Supports or staging for the forms should be used freely and well braced in both directions.
Uprights should be set on wedges and bear against a cap piece and on a sill piece to distribute
the load.

Erect, line and plumb the column forms first; then erect, line and level the girder forms and
set the girder staging, and finally erect and level the slab centers and their supports.

Leave the foot of each column form open on one side at the bottom so that the column reinforcement
can be adjusted and connected up and so that a clear view can be had through the form to detect
any object that may have fallen into the form and become wedged; this same opening makes it
possible to clean the form.

Give the forms a final inspection before concreting to check line and level, to close open
joints and to tighten up clamps and wedges. Finally clean each form and wet it down thoroughly
before placing the concrete--do this just before placing the concrete.

~REMOVING FORMS.~--Good judgment and extreme care are essential in removing centers. It goes
without saying that forms should never be removed until the concrete has set and hardened to
such strength that it will sustain its own dead weight and such live load as may come upon
it during construction. The determination of this condition is the matter that calls for knowledge
and judgment. Some cements set and harden more rapidly than others, and concrete hardens more
and more slowly as the temperature falls. These and other circumstances must all be taken into
account in deciding upon the safe time for removal. Many large contractors mold a cube of concrete
for each day's work and leave it standing on the finished floor exposed to the same conditions
as the concrete in the forms; examination of this sample block gives a line on the condition
of the concrete in the work and on the probable safety of removing the forms at any time. In
all cases it should be the superintendent's duty to determine when to remove forms, and he
should satisfy himself by personal inspection that the concrete is in condition to stand without
support. It is also wise at least as a matter of precaution for the contractor to secure the
engineer's or the architect's approval before removing any formwork.

Care in removing forms is essential for the reason that green concrete is particularly susceptible
to injury from shock or sudden strain. It is well, therefore, to have a separate gang always
doing the work. These men will in a few days become trained under an experienced foreman so
that they will not only do the work with greater safety but also more rapidly. This gang should,
furthermore, be required to follow a regular system in its work; a system which may not be
departed from without direct orders from the superintendent. An example of such a system is
outlined below.

The time of beginning this work of removal shall be given by the superintendent. In warm, dry
weather, with other conditions favorable, removal may be begun after seven days. Then the following
schedule may be followed: At the end of seven days remove the sides of the column forms. This
gives an opportunity to determine the soundness of the column casting and also serves the further
desirable purpose of baring the concrete to the curing and hardening action of the air. At
the end of 14 days loosen the wedges of the posts supporting the slab centers and drop these
centers a couple of inches: leave the centers in this position for another day, meanwhile examining
the tops of the slabs to note their condition. Then remove the sides of the beam molds and
the slab centers, replacing the latter with temporary uprights supporting a plank bearing against
the underside of the slab. This precaution is often neglected and with very little reason considering
the importance of the safeguard thus secured. Ordinarily the shores need not be left in place
more than a week, so that the amount of lumber thus tied up is small. At the end of three weeks
remove the uprights under the beam and girder molds and strip the bottom plank. In this schedule
it is assumed that the floor is free from any great load and that no unusual loading is put
upon it; if a load of any consequence is to come on the floor the shores and uprights should
be left in place longer. No schedule of removal can be blindly followed, and that given above
is certain only when the conditions are right and as stated.

FABRICATION AND PLACING OF REINFORCEMENT.

The amount of reinforcing steel used varies from 50 lbs. to 275 lbs. per cu. yd. of concrete;
the highest figure will be had only in very heavy work and where very heavily reinforced raft
foundations are employed, and the lowest only in one-story buildings consisting of walls and
roof. A fair average is perhaps 150 lbs. per cu. yd. The cost of fabricating and placing reinforcement
will run from 1/3 ct. to 1½ cts. per pound, but the last figure is exceedingly high; ¾ ct.
per pound for fabricating and placing is a reasonable labor charge.

Contractors frequently have their choice whether the steel shall be fabricated into frames
and placed as units or whether it shall be placed in separate bars. For girders and columns
the difference in cost of the two methods is not so very great for steel in place when the
fabrication is done in the field. The unit frames cost considerably more than separate bars
to fabricate, but the cost of handling and placing them in the forms is materially less; on
an average the differences balance each other. Where the frames are made up in regular mills
unit frames generally cost less to fabricate and place than do separate bars. The use of unit
frames in wall and floor slab reinforcement is generally more expensive than the use of separate
bars. The chief gain that comes from the use of unit frames is the gain due to the certainty
that the reinforcing bars, stirrups, etc., are all there and are properly spaced and placed.

~FABRICATION.~--Fabrication includes all the work necessary to prepare the reinforcement ready
to place in the forms. It amounts to very little where separate bar types of reinforcement
are used. Plain bending and shearing operations comprise the whole task. Where the beam or
column reinforcement has to be made up into complete frames which can be handled and placed
as units this task is more complex and considerable apparatus is essential to rapid and economical
work. For this reason it is wise usually to contract with some metal working shop to assemble
and connect up the various units and to furnish them ready for installation. In many cases
these unit frame types of reinforcement are patented and the proprietors contract to fabricate
and furnish them complete according to the plans of the engineer or architect. Even where the
frame construction is not so controlled it will be economy generally to have the fabrication
done at regular shops where the necessary tools and skilled workmen are had. In any case the
bars should be ordered cut to length at the mill so far as possible.

Assuming the fabrication to be done in the field, the mode of procedure will be as follows:
Order the bars or rods to be shipped in bundles of corresponding sizes and lengths of pieces
with each bundle tagged with its proper shop number or mark. The bundles should weigh about
200 lbs.; this is a load easily handled by two men and so long as possible all handling should
be done in the original package, for when once broken it is very hard to get men to carry a
full load. As received, the bars of each size and length should be stored by themselves. For
ordinary bars not having long prongs a rack of the general form shown by Fig. 207 serves the
purpose excellently. When a great deal of metal must be kept stored for some time it is wise
to roof over the racks, not only to protect the metal from rain and snow, but to enable the
men to work dry shod in stormy weather. Usually it will pay to have one man whose sole duty
it is to receive and check all metal and to attend to its systematic arrangement on the racks;
this same man will also direct the removal of the metal to the shop where it is bent and otherwise
worked up, and can, if he is competent, earn his pay many times over in time saved all along
the line in handling and working up the reinforcement. The authors have seen enough time wasted
in hauling over and rehandling metal in piles to get at what was wanted to pay for shed, racks
and the wages of a storekeeper several times during a moderate sized job. In large work provide
the storekeeper with a schedule showing the order in which the metal is wanted for the work
so that he can arrange it in that order and can check up his receipts from the mills and report
missing items in time for the deficit to be made up before some part of the work has to be
stopped because of material missing. System in receiving and storing the metal is absolutely
essential to rapid and accurate work at the bending and erecting tables.

The work done on the metal consists chiefly of bending. The metal can usually be bent cold,
but for sizes 1½-in. and upward some makes of bars require heating; this can be done by laying
the bars side by side on the ground and arranging sticks and shavings on top of them in a strip
18 ins. to 2 ft. wide across the portion where the bend is to be. Only moderate heating is
usually required. Ordinary bending is a simple process and can be done with very simple apparatus.
Figures 208, 209 and 210 show frequently used devices, any of which can be made by an ordinary
carpenter. For heavy bars, 1½ and 2 ins., the device shown by Fig. 210, with its heavy, swinging
beam, is particularly efficient. An example of more elaborate methods is had in the following
description of the processes employed in fabricating girder frames and hooped column reinforcement
for a large factory building. The building was 500×75 ft., with six stories and a basement,
built for the Bush Terminal Co., Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1905. Three longitudinal rows of round
columns and two rows of rectangular wall columns carry heavy longitudinal girders supporting
floor slabs with corrugated undersides as shown by Fig. 211, which also shows the floor slab
reinforcement. About 12,000 cu. yds. of concrete and 1,000 tons of reinforcing steel were required;
hence 167 lbs. of steel were required for each cubic yard of concrete. The floors, however,
were designed to carry a load of 800 lbs. per sq. ft. The particular feature of interest in
this building was the fabrication of all the column and girder reinforcement into unit frames
and cylinders in temporary workshops on the site.

The circular interior columns, varying from 30 ins. to 12 ins., in diameter were molded in
permanent shells of cinder concrete. The shells were made in sections about 30 ins. long, with
walls 1½ ins. thick, which were set one on another with mortar joints to form the column mold.
In fabricating the shells the first step was to wind a helix of steel wire on a collapsible
mandrel about 4 ft. long; the mandrel was set with the axis horizontal and was revolved by
hand, the wire being fed on also by hand and under a slight tension. After the wire helix was
completed it was wrapped with a sheet of expanded metal, the longitudinal edges of which lapped
a few inches and were tied by wire ties. The expanded metal covering was also wire tied to
the helix. Each of these cylinders of expanded metal and wire was 30 ins. long and formed the
inner mold for making the shell. The outer mold consisted of a sheet metal cylinder in two
parts assembled and supported by wooden yokes and framework. The two molds were assembled on
a plank platform, one inside the other, and about a common center. The annular space was then
filled with a 1-5 cinder concrete mixed moderately dry so that while it would exude slightly
through the expanded metal mesh it would not waste to any extent. After from 18 to 24 hours
the outer mold was removed for reuse and the shell was left standing on the molding platform
until safe to handle. The larger shells, 30×30×1½ ins., weighed about 150 lbs. each.

Some 2,000,000 lbs. of plain round steel rods from ¼ in. to 1½ ins. in diameter were required
for reinforcing the concrete. For the main girders these rods were cut, bent and assembled
into frames or trusses which were placed as units. The main rods were ordered cut to length,
but the stirrup rods were ordered in lengths of 20 ft. and cut to lengths as required. The
rods were brought to the work in carload lots and were stored according to lengths and sizes
in racks under sheds. Another shed was provided for the steelworkers, who cut and bent the
rods and assembled the girder frames ready for the workmen on the building. There were about
50 different patterns of frames required. They were made entirely by hand. For bending large
size rods, heavy compound levers were used; the lighter rods were bent by the device shown
in Fig. 212. The assembling of the trusses was accomplished as shown by Fig. 213, using the
steel framework of the erection shed as a staging. Across the horizontals of the framework
were placed two false temporary top chord bars marked to the stirrup spacing of the truss being
assembled. On these bars, at the spaces marked, were suspended stirrups with their lower ends
hooked. The lower chord bars were then suspended in the stirrup hooks and the whole assemblage
of bars and stirrups was then clamped rigid by the lever bars and intermediate clamps. The
loop ends of the stirrups were then bent by special wrenches to the position shown at 2, then
closed by hammering to the position shown at 3, and finally they were wire tied. The process
was a simple one, and by adopting a regular routine the men became so expert that two of them
could complete many trusses in a working day. The contract price for shaping the steel and
assembling it into frames was 1 ct. per lb.; the cost of the work to the contractor has been
stated by Mr. E. P. Goodrich, Engineer, Bush Terminal Co., to have been about ¾ ct. per lb.
The cost of placing the steel in the building was ¼ ct. per lb.

~PLACING.~--With unit frame reinforcement the number, size and location of the bars have been
made certain in the shops where the frames are fabricated so that the erector has nothing to
do but to line and level up the frames in the forms, place such temporary braces as are needed
to hold them true, and make the end connections with abutting frames. Such frames are usually
provided with "chairs" to hold the bottom bars up from the form so that little bracing or none
is required. With separate bar reinforcement the erector may either place the reinforcement
complete in the form by wire-tying the bars to each other, to temporary braces or templates
and to the forms, or he may insert the various pieces of reinforcement in the concrete as the
pouring advances, depending on the surrounding concrete to retain them where inserted. Generally
a combination of both methods is employed.

The processes in detail of placing reinforcement are particularized in several places in other
sections; they will differ for nearly every job. Here, therefore, general rules only will be given.

(1) See that the correct number and size of reinforcing bars, splices and stirrups are used
and that they are spaced and placed strictly according to the working plans.

(2) Bars must be properly braced, supported and otherwise held in position so that the pouring
of the concrete will not displace them.

(3) Splices are the critical parts of column reinforcement. See that the bars butt squarely
at the ends and are held by pipe sleeves or wired splice bars; see that the longitudinal rods
are straight and vertical; see that the horizontal ties or hooping are tight and accurately
spaced. When the reinforcement is built up inside the form one side is left open for the work;
ordinarily the column reinforcement will be fabricated into unit frames, then an opening in
the form at the bottom to permit splicing will suffice.

(4) Take extreme care that beam and girder reinforcement is placed so that the bottom bars
lie well above the bottom board of the mold; use metal or concrete block chairs for this purpose.

(5) See that the end connections and bearings of beam and girder frames are connected up and
have the bearings called for by the plans.

(6) See that line and level of all bars and of the reinforcement as a whole are accurate; make
particularly certain that expanded metal or other mesh-work reinforcement lies smooth and straight.

(7) Give all reinforcement a final inspection just previous to pouring the concrete; this is
particularly essential where the reinforcement is placed some time in advance of the concreting.

MIXING, TRANSPORTING AND PLACING CONCRETE.

A reinforced concrete building requires from 0.2 to 0.5 cu. yd. of concrete per 100 ft. of
cubical volume of the building, assuming walls, floors and roof to be all of concrete. The
amount of concrete to be mixed, transported and placed is, therefore, large enough, even for
a building of moderate dimensions, to warrant close study of and careful planning for this
portion of the work. A few general principles can be set down, but as a rule there is one best
way for each building and that way must be determined by individual conditions.

~MIXING.~--Concrete for building work has to be of superior quality so that no chances may
be taken either in the process of mixing or with the type of mixer employed. Machine mixing
and batch mixers should always be employed. Machine mixing gives generally a more homogeneous
and uniform concrete than does hand mixing and is cheaper. Batch mixers are generally superior
and more reliable than continuous mixers where a uniformly well mixed concrete is required.
The capacity of the mixing plant is determined by the amount of concrete to be placed and the
time available for placing it. Its division and arrangement is determined by the area of the
work and the type and arrangement of the plant for transporting the materials and the mixed
concrete. The following general principles may be laid down: Make the most use possible of
gravity; it is frequently economy to carry all materials to the top of bins from which point
they can move by gravity down through the mixer to the hoist buckets, and where natural elevations
or basement floors below street level permit gravity handling they should be taken advantage
of. The mixing should be done as near the place of concreting as practicable; in building work
this is the point on the ground which is directly under the forms being filled. It is, of course,
impracticable to secure so direct a route as this from mixer to forms, but it can be more or
less closely approached; using two mixers, for example, one at the front and one at the rear
of a building cuts down the haul from hoist to forms one-half. Other ways will suggest themselves
upon a little thought. In the matter of the mixing itself, it must never be forgotten that
a batch of concrete without cement which goes into a girder or column will result in the failure
of that member and possibly the failure of the building. In massive concrete work a batch without
cement will not endanger the stability of the structure, but in column and floor work in buildings
it is certain disaster. Formanship at the mixer is, therefore, highly important and a cement
man who realizes the responsibility of his task is equally important.

~TRANSPORTING.~--Transporting the mixed concrete is divided into three operations--delivering
concrete from mixer to hoist, hoisting, and delivering hoisted concrete to the forms. The delivery
from mixer to hoist may be by direct discharge into hoist bucket, by carts or wheelbarrows,
or by cars carrying concrete or concrete buckets. Hoisting may be done by platform hoists or
elevators, by bucket hoists, or by derricks. Handling from hoist to form may be direct in buckets,
by carts or wheelbarrows, or by cars. These several methods can be worked in various combinations,
and the following examples of plants show such combinations as are most typical of current
practice.

In any system of transportation it is getting the concrete to the hoist and from hoist to form
that eats up the money. Hoisting makes but a small part of the total transportation cost, and,
moreover, the difference in cost of operation for different hoists is very small. Mr. E. P.
Goodrich states that on three buildings the actual costs for the hoists installed and removed
after the completion of the work were as follows:

Platform hoist  $330 Bucket hoist     465 Derrick          225

In figuring on the form of hoist to be adopted, the capability of the hoist for general service
has to be kept in mind. Platform hoists and derricks can be used for hoisting form lumber and
reinforcing steel as well as for hoisting concrete, while bucket hoists cannot be so used except
where they may be fitted with special carriages for lumber or steel. On the other hand, the
bucket hoist is usually the quickest method of hoisting concrete, and it can readily be extended
upward as the work progresses. The last is true also of platform hoists. The use of derricks
necessitates frequent shifting for high work or else the building of expensive staging to raise
the derrick into a position to command the final height of the building. The probable costs
of moving and extending must be allowed for in choosing the hoist to be used.

Direct discharge of the mixer into the hoisting bucket is, of course, the ideal manner of transporting
the concrete from mixer to hoist, and this can generally be obtained by planning, particularly
where bucket hoists or derricks are employed. For platform hoists direct discharge is impossible;
it can be somewhat closely approached, however, where conditions permit car tracks to be laid
on the floors being built, so that a car holding a batch of concrete can be run onto the platform,
hoisted and then run to shoveling boards near the forms that are being filled. The successful
use of such an arrangement of car tracks is described in Chapter XX, but it was for handling
concrete blocks. A direct discharge from hoisting bucket to forms is frequently possible where
derricks are used for hoisting, but with bucket and platform hoists, wheeling or carting is
necessary.

Where wheeling or carting has to be done either at the bottom or at the top of the hoist, or
at both points, a great factor in the economy of work is the arranging of the operations in
cycles. For example, in wheeling concrete to forms from a hopper fed by a bucket hoist, arrange
the runways so that each man makes a circuit, passing by the form at one end and by the hopper
at the other end, and goes and comes by a different route. The speed gained by avoiding confusion
and delay saves many times the additional cost of runways which is small. In fact it is economy
to employ a few extra men to arrange runways and keep them clean, because of the additional
speed thus gained. Good organization effects more economy than special methods of hoisting
as far as the labor of handling the concrete is concerned.

~Bucket Hoists.~--A bucket hoist construction which has been extensively used in building work
on the Pacific coast is shown by the drawings of Figs. 214 to 216. Two T-bar guides made in
sections connected by fishplates furnish a track for an automatic dumping bucket hoisted and
lowered by steel cable from engine on the ground to head sheaves as shown. The sectional construction
of the T-bar guides permits the hoist to be any height desired, it being lengthened and shortened
by adding and taking out sections. The bucket is dumped automatically at any point desired
by means of a tripping device attached to a chute which receives the contents of the bucket
and delivers them to carts, wheelbarrows, or other receptacle. The hoist is set outside of
the building with the mixer arranged, if possible, to discharge directly into the bucket. By
setting the guide frame in a pit or on blocking any height of edge of bucket can be secured.
The buckets are ordinarily 13½ or 20 cu. ft. capacity. It is recommended, when greater hoisting
capacity is necessary, to use two hoists set side by side and operated by one cable in the
same manner as double wheelbarrow cages; as the weight of one bucket counterbalances the weight
of the other, the power required for hoisting is reduced. To adapt this hoist to handling form
lumber the bucket is replaced by the lumber carriage shown by Fig. 216; this carriage discharges
over the head of the mixer and the spring buffer shown by Fig. 214 is to take the shock of
the rising carriage. This buffer is omitted when concrete only is to be hoisted. In one case
this device has hoisted 520 batches of 12 cu. ft. each to the fourth floor in 8 hours, or nearly
19 cu. yds. per hour. In another case 65 trips per hour were averaged to the fifth floor with
a 12-cu. ft. load each trip; this is nearly 30 cu. yds. per hour. With the lumber carriage
8 men have unloaded 14,000 ft. B. M. of 2×10-in. stuff from car to the second floor and distributed
it in 43 minutes. A ½-cu. yd. combination outfit for concrete and lumber, with 40 ft. of guide
track, weighs 1,750 lbs., without the lumber carriage the outfit weighs 1,600 lbs. This hoist
is made by the Wallace-Lindesmith Co., Los Angeles, Cal.

A popular construction for automatic bucket hoists is that shown by Figs. 217 and 218 by Mr.
E. L. Ransome. The bucket is held upright by guides at its front and rear edges; to dump it
a section of the front guide is removed at the desired dumping point which allows the bucket
to overturn as shown. A friction crab hoist operated from the mixer engine runs the bucket.
The mixer is located as shown. Figure 218 shows the foot of the hoist set in a pit with the
mixer at surface level, but the hoist can be set on the surface and the mixer mounted on a
platform. In the latter case a charging bucket, traveling from stock pile up an inclined track
to the mixer platform, is generally used. A hoist like that illustrated, equipped with a ½-cu.
yd. Ransome mixer, will cost about $1,500 and will deliver 15 cu. yds. of concrete per hour.
Mr. F. W. Daggett gives the following figures of the cost of operation:

  Mixing Gang:
                     Total 1 hr.
1 mixer foreman, also engineer, 25c.         $.25
1 man charging mixer, 20c.                    .20
1 man running hoist, 20c.                     .20
2 men wheeling sand, 17½c.                    .35
4 men wheeling and shoveling stone, 17½c.     .70
1 man helping up runway, 17½c.                .17½
2 men carrying cement, 17½c.                  .35

  Gang Placing Cement:

1 foreman, 25c.                               .25
9 men wheeling concrete, 17½c.               1.57½
3 men tamping concrete, 17½c.                 .52½
1 man filling carts, 17½c.                    .17½
                                            ------

  Total labor cost per hour                 $4.75

Fuel, etc.                                    .50
                                            ------
                                             5.25

This gives a cost of 35 cts. per cu. yd. for mixing and placing concrete.

In this particular case the mixer was charged by wheelbarrows. Frequently the stone and sand
bins can be arranged to chute the materials directly into the charging hopper as shown by Fig.
217. In place of barrows two-wheeled carts of the type shown by Fig. 12 can be used. Mention
has already been made of operating the charging bucket on an incline from stock pile to mixer.
Such arrangements are described in Chapter IV.

In constructing a 9-story store at St. Paul, Minn., the concrete was hoisted by continuous
bucket elevators. A lay-out of the construction plant is shown by Fig. 219. In the alley near
the center of the north side of the building the surface grade was about 6 ft. above the third
story level. A hopper was constructed at grade and provided with two chutes running to the
basement. These chutes discharged on opposite sides of a vertical partition separating the
sand and stone bins, and by closing either chute at its top by a suitably arranged deflector
plate either sand or stone could be dumped into the same hopper and chuted to its proper bin.
Cement was brought to the work in cars over the tracks shown and was wheeled from the cars
over runways leading to the charging platforms near each mixer. Other runways connecting with
these platforms provided for wheeling the sand and stone to the mixers. The runways were placed
at the proper height to permit the barrows to be emptied directly into the charging hoppers.
Two Smith mixers were used, located as shown, and each discharged through a chute into one
of the bucket elevator boots. There were two elevators which were "raised" two stories at a
move as the work progressed. Each elevator discharged into a hopper holding 1½ batches, and
from these hoppers the concrete was fed into wheelbarrows and wheeled to the forms. The bucket
elevators were carried no higher than the eighth floor. When this floor had been completed
the hoppers were moved down to the fifth floor and the wheelbarrows were taken to platform
elevators and carried to the remaining floors and roof. Special 4-cu. ft. wheelbarrows were
used for handling the concrete. A maximum of 155 cu. yds. of concrete was mixed, transported
and placed in a 10-hour day with a gang of 28 men.

~Platform Hoists.~--The common builders' hoist or elevator, operating single or double platforms
or cages, needs no special description. The wheelbarrow, cart or car containing the concrete
is run onto the platform, hoisted and then run to the forms. The chief advantage of this device
in concrete work is that it will handle all classes of material without any change of carriage
or arrangement, it can thus be used for handling form lumber and reinforcing steel as well
as for handling concrete.

~Derricks.~--The use of derricks for hoisting in concrete building work is limited by the necessity
of supporting them independently of the structure being built; the formwork or the completed
concrete work cannot be utilized to carry derricks during construction. For low structures
the derrick can be set on the ground, but for high buildings a supporting tower or staging
is necessary. The arrangement of such falsework can be illustrated best by specific examples.

In constructing a 7-story factory at Cincinnati, O., concrete was mixed on the ground and hoisted
by a derrick with an 80-ft. boom mounted on a tower 55 ft. high. The derrick was located to
one side of the building. For the lower floors the boom swing covered so large an area that
the bucket was dumped at various places, but for the upper floors it was found more economical
to dump buckets into a hopper from which wheelbarrows were filled. By this plan less time was
consumed in placing the bucket and no tag rope man was required, as the engineman could swing
the boom to a certain point on the wall which would bring the bucket directly over the hopper.
A Smith mixer discharged directly into derrick buckets, which rested on a track long enough
to hold two buckets. The buckets were filled and emptied alternately by shuttling the truck
and attaching first one and then the other to the derrick.

In constructing an 11-story and basement office building in New York City a four-legged tower
starting from the bottom of the excavation was erected at about the center of the lot. It was
built of timber and extended upward as the progress of the work demanded until it overtopped
the roof 11 stories above the street. The tower was square in plan and was divided into stories
corresponding approximately to the several stories of the building. A floor was constructed
in the tower at each story to be used in storing materials. For hoisting a 75-ft. boom was
swung from each leg of the tower, each boom being operated by a separate engine and having
a nominal capacity of 5 tons. The four booms covered the whole building area and were kept
about two stories above the work by being shifted upward as the work progressed. This arrangement
of derricks was used to handle the steel, lumber and concrete, the building being built up
around the tower, which was so located that its only interference with the building structure
was in the shape of square holes left in the floor slabs to accommodate the tower legs.

In constructing an 8-story warehouse covering some three acres of ground in Chicago, Ill.,
the derrick plant shown by Figs. 220 to 222 was installed. Some 7,500 tons of reinforcing steel,
125,000 cu. yds. of concrete and 4,000,000 ft. of form lumber had to be handled. Incidentally
it is worth noting that there were about 120 lbs. of reinforcing steel and 32 ft. B. M. of
form lumber used per cubic yard of concrete.

The controlling conditions governing the arrangement and character of the construction plant
were as follows: The building, to be built entirely of reinforced concrete, was 135 ft. high.
Its west front abutted on the river and its south front on the street; at the north end there
was some ground available for plant and along the east front there was a strip about 20 ft.
wide between the building wall and the main line tracks of a railway. At best, therefore, the
area outside of the building and available for plant and storage was limited, while inside
the building area the contractor was confronted by the insistence of the architect that an
unbroken monolithic construction be obtained as nearly as possible, by reducing the floor openings
for construction work to a minimum. The sketch plan, Fig. 220, shows the plant designed to
meet the conditions.

To get the large amount of construction material onto the work a side track was built along
the 20-ft. area on the east side of the building and another was turned into the area at the
north end of the building. These side tracks handled all construction materials coming onto
the work. Over the first there were built two sets of storage bins for sand and gravel and
all concrete materials brought in in carload lots are unloaded at these two points, as will
be described further on. Lumber for forms and steel for reinforcement shipped in similar manner
were taken by the second siding to the lumber yard and steel mill at the north end of the building.

The raw materials after being worked up in the mixer plants and the saw and steel mills were
distributed over the work by an industrial railway. The track system of this railway is shown
by the dotted lines; it was located on the basement floor, with rampes leading to the No. 1
mixer plant and to the saw and steel mill tracks. The two main lines of track passed close
to or under the elevator and stairway shaft openings in the several floors. This permitted
the derrick buckets, lowered and hoisted through the shafts, to be loaded directly from the
car tracks. All mixed concrete, forms and reinforcing frames were distributed by this railway
to the several shafts and thence hoisted and placed by the derrick plant.

The derrick plant consisted of four derricks arranged as shown by the circles in Fig. 220.
The view, Fig. 221 shows the first derrick installed and illustrates the general construction
quite clearly. Briefly the derrick consisted of a vertical steel-work tower 10 ft. square and
85 ft. high, within which operated a steel mast 135 ft. high and carrying an 80-ft. boom connected
just above the tower. The mast was pivoted at the bottom and had rollers turning against a
horizontal ring inside the tower at the top. It was operated by a bull wheel above the top
of the tower, the turning ropes running down inside the mast to the foot block and thence horizontally
to the operating motor. The topping and hoisting lines also followed this route. The top of
the tower was guyed by four ropes to anchorages in the basement floor. The boom commanded a
circle 170 ft. in diameter and could lift 150 ft. above the base of the mast. The derrick was
operated by a 25-HP. double drum electric hoist with a derrick swinging spool; this hoist was
set on the basement floor. It will be noted that the guys are below the bull wheel so that
the boom has a clear swing through a complete circle.

As stated above, four of these derricks were employed. Together they did not cover the entire
building area, but by the use of a derrick bucket so designed that it could be used as a storage
bin for feeding wheelbarrows, it was found possible to keep the number of derricks down to four.

This derrick plant possessed several advantages of importance. In the first place the derricks
would handle all classes of material--concrete, forms, steel frames--equally well and could
be transferred from one class of work to the other with practically no delay. In the second
place, for a large area of the building, they handled the material from the basement direct
to the place it was to occupy in the work, and did it in one operation. Finally they permitted
the handling and erection of the forms and reinforcement in large units. Thus a column form
would be assembled complete at the mill, moved as a unit by car to the proper shaft and then
hoisted and set in place as a unit by the derrick. Girder forms, floor slab forms, girder and
column reinforcing, etc., could be similarly assembled and handled. The derricks occupied only
the area of four floor panels, the remainder of the area of each floor was left unobstructed
for the work to be done. No materials or supplies needed be stored on the floors until they
were in perfect condition to accommodate them, and not then, even, so far as the prosecution
of form erection and concreting were concerned.

The sand and gravel for concrete were brought in by bottom or side dump gondola cars from pits
located about 30 miles out on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. The cars were switched
onto the main side track and unloaded under the bins which straddle this track. A receiving
hopper, with its top at rail level and long enough to permit two cars to be unloaded at once,
received the sand or gravel and distributed it through twelve gate openings onto an 18-in.
horizontal belt conveyor 65 ft. long. This conveyor discharged into a second conveyor, 133
ft. long, which ran up a 22° incline, extending away from the bins and discharged onto a third
conveyor 117 ft. long, which doubled back on a 22° incline reaching to and over the top of
the bins. This third conveyor had two fixed trippers and an end discharge to distribute its
cargo. All three conveyors were operated by a 35-HP. motor located at the junction of the two
inclined conveyors, both of which were driven from the same shaft. A chain belt from the idler
shaft of the first incline conveyor to the driving shaft of the horizontal conveyor operated
that unit of the plant. This belt was operated as a cross belt by reversing alternate links.
No manual labor was required to handle the sand and gravel from the cars to the storage bins.

The mixer arrangement at the two bins differed. At the No. 1 bins the mixer was located as
shown in Fig. 220, close to the bin. Chutes led directly from the sand and gravel bins to the
charging hopper and the bags of cement were stacked alongside this hopper. The mixer discharged
either directly into the bucket of the first derrick or into cars for transportation on the
railways. At the No. 2 bins a belt conveyor took the concrete materials down into the basement
to a mixer located close enough to one of the distribution tracks to permit it to discharge
directly into the cars.

The derrick buckets by which the concrete was hoisted and handled to the work were of special
construction. A bucket was desired which would serve several distinct purposes. It must first
be able to hold a full mixer batch of material, since, with the derrick arrangement, economy
in hoisting necessitated hoisting in large units and also because storage capacity was required
of the bucket for wheelbarrow work. The four derricks did not command the entire area of a
floor; there were corners and other irregular areas outside of the circles covered by the several
booms over which the concrete must be distributed by barrows or carts. A bucket large enough
to supply the barrows, while a second bucket was being lowered, charged from the mixer and
hoisted, was required. In the second place, a bucket was required whose contents could be discharged
all at once or in smaller portion at will. Finally a bucket was desired which could be made
to distribute its load along a narrow girder form or in a thin sheet for a floor slab.

To meet these requirements the bucket shown in Fig. 222 was designed. It held 42 cu. ft., or
about 1.55 cu. yds. of concrete. It had a hopper bottom terminating in a short rectangular
discharge spout closed by a lever operated under cut gate, which could be opened as much or
as little as desired. To the underside of the bucket there was attached a four-leg frame in
which the bucket stood when not suspended. Ordinarily, that is within the circles commanded
by the derricks, the buckets were discharged suspended and directly into the forms, the character
of the discharge gate permitting a thin sheet to be spread for floor slabs or a narrow girder
or wall form to be filled without spilling or shock. For wheelbarrow work outside the reach
of the derricks the mode of procedure was as follows: A timber platform about 3 ft. high and
having room for standing two buckets was set just on the edge of the circle commanded by the
derrick boom. Two buckets were used. A full bucket was hoisted and set on the platform, with
its spout overhanging. This bucket served as a storage bin for feeding the wheelbarrows while
the second bucket was being lowered, charged and hoisted to take its place on the platform,
and serve in turn as a storage hopper.

~PLACING AND RAMMING.~--A wet concrete is usually used in building work except on occasions,
for exterior wall work and except for pitch roof work, where a wet mixture would run down the
slope. Placing and tamping are therefore, essentially pouring and puddling operations. The
pouring should be done directly from the barrows, carts, or buckets if possible; dumping onto
shoveling boards and shoveling makes an extra operation and increases the cost by the wages
of the shoveling gang. Where shoveling boards are necessary, take care that they are placed
close to the forms being filled, as it is wasteful of time to carry concrete in shovels, even
for a half dozen paces. Before pouring any concrete, the inside of the forms should be wet
down thoroughly with a hose or sprinkler, if a hose stream is not available. The final inspection
of forms and reinforcement just before concreting will have made certain that they are ready
for the concrete, so far as line and level of forms and presence and proper arrangement of
the reinforcement are concerned, but the concrete foreman must watch that no displacement occurs
in pouring and puddling, and must make certain particularly that the forms are clean.

In pouring columns it is essential that the operation be continuous to the bottom of the beam
or girder. It is also advisable to pour columns several hours ahead of the girders. Puddling
should be thorough, as its purpose is to work the concrete closely around the reinforcement
and into the angles of the mold and to work out air bubbles. A tool resembling a broad chisel
is one of the best devices for puddling or slicing. In slab and girder construction, the pouring
should be continuous from bottom of girder to top of slab. Work should never be stopped-off
at horizontal planes. As in columns, careful puddling is essential in pouring beams. In slab
work, the concrete is best compacted by tamping or rolling. A broad faced rammer should be
used for tamping wet concrete, or a wooden roller covered with sheet steel, weighing about
250 lbs., and having a 30-in. face.

Theoretically, concreting should be a continuous operation, but practically it cannot be made
so. Bonding fresh concrete to concrete that has hardened, though it has been done with great
perfection by certain methods as described in Chapter XXIV, must still be held as uncertain.
Ordinarily, at least, a plane of weakness exists where the junction is made and in stopping
off work it should be done where these planes of weakness will cause the least harm. Experts
are by no means agreed on the best location of these planes, but the following is recognized
good practice. Work once started, pouring a column, should not be stopped until the column
is completed to the bottom of the girder. For beams and girders; stop concrete at center of
girder with a vertical face at right angles to the girder, or directly over the center of the
columns; in beams connecting with girders, stop concrete at center of span, or directly over
center of connecting girder; stop always with a vertical face and never with a sloping face,
and never with a girder partly filled. For slabs; stop concrete at center of span, or directly
over middle of supporting girder or beam; stop always with vertical joints. If for any cause
work must be stopped at other points, than those stated, the fresh concrete and the hardened
concrete must be bonded by one of the methods described in Chapter XXIV.

~CONSTRUCTING WALL COLUMNS FOR A BRICK BUILDING.~--The columns, 12 in number, were constructed
to strengthen the brick walls of a power station and were built as shown by Figs. 223 and 224,
one at a time. The staging, 50 ft. high and 4×6 ft. in plan, was erected against the wall which
had been shored, a portion of the wall was cut out and forms erected and the concrete column
substituted for the section of wall which was removed. The staging was then moved into position
for another column.

Two men, with sledge and drill, cut out the brick work amounting to about 12 cu. yds. for each
column in 15 hours, at a cost of about 70 cts. per cu. yd., including removal to the street.
The cost of moving and re-erecting the scaffolding was $2.94 per each move. The character of
the reinforcement is shown by Fig. 223; it was erected as the concreting progressed, the main
bars being in sections 15 ft. long, spliced with and distanced by side bars and cross bolts
at the splices.

The concrete was hand mixed in 6-cu. ft. batches at the foot of the column, by three men with
a fourth turning over and filling the buckets. The buckets, 12 ins. in diameter and 16 ins.
high, were hoisted by a pulley line arranged as shown and pulled by a mule driven by a man,
at $1 per day for the mule and $1.50 for the man, the cost of hoisting being 25 to 40 cts.
per cu. yd., depending on the rapidity of the man inside the form. This man tamped the concrete
which was emptied from the buckets by a man on the scaffolding. Each batch raised the level
in the form 15 ins., and between batches a set of ties for the column rods was placed by the
man during the tamping. It took from 1½ to 2 days to concrete a column of 12 cu. yds. The concrete
was a 1-3.8-5.7 limestone screenings mixture, mixed wet enough to be easily pushed into the
forms and worked around the reinforcement. The form construction is shown by Fig. 224. The
form for one column required 650 ft. B. M. of lumber, and on an average, each form was used
twice. As a matter of fact, the side strips and outside braces were used three times, while
much of the 7/8-in. sheathing was destroyed by being used once. The lumber for shoring cost
$23 per M. ft. B. M., and the light lumber for forms cost $18 per M. ft. B. M. All lumber was
yellow pine. All labor was negro, at 15 cts. per hour; foremen who worked. 22½ cts. per hour.
The cost of the several parts of the work compiled from records furnished by Mr. Keith O. Guthrie,
engineer in charge, was as follows:

~FLOOR AND COLUMN CONSTRUCTION FOR SIX-STORY BUILDING.~--The building was 91×112 ft.; 56 columns
spaced 16 ft. apart carried the girder system shown by Fig. 225, which in turn supported a
3½-in. floor slab. The walls and partitions were not concrete. The following records were kept
by the authors:

Forms.--The column forms were built as shown by Fig. 226. The boards were 1½-in. stuff, surfaced
on four sides; the yokes were spaced 2 ft. apart. The 1×6-in. pieces were nailed to the 2×4's
with 8-d. nails with heads left projecting for easy pulling. The girder forms, Fig. 227, rested
on the column forms and on intermediate posts half-way between columns. These intermediate
posts were 3×4's with 4×4×12-in. head blocks nailed to their tops and wedges under their bottoms.
The girder molds were 1½-in. stuff, and to the side pieces were nailed 1×4-in. cleats; the
bottom and side pieces were connected by 3/8×4-in. lag screws spaced 28 ins. apart. The floor
slab stringers were carried on the 1×4-in. cleats; they were spaced 28 ins. apart and were
not nailed; neither were the 1×6-in. lagging boards nailed to the stringers. The point to be
noted is the design and construction of the forms so that they could be put together and taken
apart easily. The lumber required for forms for one floor 91×112 ft., or, say, 10,200 sq. ft.,
was as follows:

Lumber for columns, ft. B. M.             9,000
Lumber for 10×10-in. beams, ft. B. M.     7,600
Lumber for 5×10-in. beams, ft. B. M.      2,700
Intermediate 3×4-in. posts, ft. B. M.     1,000
Lagging, 1×6-in. boards, ft. B. M.        9,000
Stringers, 3×4 ins., ft. B. M.            4,500
                                         ------
  Total ft. B. M.                        33,800

In round numbers, we can say that 34,000 ft. B. M. of lumber were used for 10,000 sq. ft. of
floor area, or 3.4 ft. B. M. per 1 sq. ft. Enough forms were provided to erect two complete
floors; the forms for the lower floor being removed and erected again for the second floor
above, thus using all the lumber three times. With carpenters at $3.50 for 8 hours, the forms
were framed ready for erection for $4 per M. ft. B. M. The lumber framed ready to erect cost them:

Lumber, cost per M. ft. B. M.                       $26.00
Labor, framing per M. ft. B. M.                       4.00
                                                    ------
Total per M. ft. B. M.                              $30.00
