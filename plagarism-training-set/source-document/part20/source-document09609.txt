    All hail! far-seeing and creative power,
    Before whose might the universe bends low
    In silent adoration! Guide my pen
    While from my soul the sounds of music pour
    Towards thy praises! For to thee belongs
    The sounding stream of never-ending song.
    When out of chaos rose the glorious world,
    Sublime with mountains flowing from the skies,
    On lonely seas, sweet with slow-winding vales,
    Clasping the grandeur of the heavenly hills
    With soft and tender arms, or lowly glens
    Shrinking from glowing gaze of searching sun
    Beneath the shade of the high-soaring hills;
    Grand with great torrents roaring o'er fierce crags
    In suicidal madness, sad with seas
    That flash in silver of the gladdening sun,
    Yet ever wail in sadness 'neath the skies
    Of smiling heaven (like a lovely life
    That wears a sunny face, and wintry soul),
    Hopeful with fickle life renewing spring,
    Gladden'd with summer's radiance, autumn's joy,
    And sad and sullen with fierce winter's rain;
    Ruled by the race of God-made men who rush
    Towards eternity with half-shut eyes,
    Blind to the glories of sweet sky and sea,
    Wood-covered earth, and sun-reflecting hill,
    Thou in the mind of God, almighty power!
    Ruled, and directed his creative hand.
    With thee the seas spread and the hills arose
    To do thy Maker's will; the silvery stars
    Like heavenly glow-worms, beautifully cold,
    And gladly silent, gemmed the gloom of night,
    And shed the gladdening glances of their eyes
    On the sad face of the night-darken'd earth.
    Without thy sweetening influence, the soul
    Of nature's bard were like a sunless plain,
    Or summer garden destitute of flowers,
    A winter day ungladden'd by the gleam
    Of flowing sun, or river searching wild
    Through desert lands for ne'er appearing trees,
    Or peaceful flowers that sandy scenes disdain.
    No thought the philosophic mind imparts
    To an enraptured world, but bears thy power,
    And owns thee as the agent of its birth.
    O'er the sweet landscape of the poet's mind
    Thou sunlike shed'st the gladness of thy love,
    Inspiring all the scenes that lie below,
    Sweetening the bowers where Fancy loves to dwell,
    And on the crest of some huge mountain-thought
    Placing the glory of thy fleecy cloud,
    To make its frowning grandeur greater still,
    And heighten all its beauteous mystery.
    Thro' the sweet-coloured plains of Poesy
    Thou flowest like a sweetly-sounding stream,
    Here, rushing furious o'er the rocky crags
    Of wild, original thought, and there, 'neath bowers
    Of imagery, winding on thy way
    Peaceful and still towards the fadeless sea
    Of all enduring immortality.
    Like lightning flash for which no thunder-roar
    Makes preparation, from th' astonished mind
    On an astonished and admiring world
    Thou dartest in thine overwhelming course,
    Leaving a track of splendour in thy train,
    And lighting up the regions of thy way.
    With thee sweet music sings her various song,
    And thrills the soul and elevates the mind
    With "thoughts that often lie too deep for tears,"
    And own a sadness sweeter than the rills,
    A softer sweetness than the sinking sun
    Gives to the sparkling face of pensive sea.
    With thee great genius walketh hand in hand
    Towards the loftiest thought, or sits in pride
    Upon the golden throne of starry Fame.
    Borne on thy wings the pensive poet flies
    To the sweet-smiling land of sunny dreams,
    Or pours his floods of music o'er the world.
    With thy bright gleams his daily deeds are gemmed,
    And by thy balmy influence, his life
    Survives when he is dead!

    MAIDENKIRK.                                       D. R. WILLIAMSON.

LACHLAN MACKINNON,

OR "LACHLAN MAC THEARLAICH OIG," THE SKYE BARD.

AMONG many who have distinguished themselves by their display of poetical talents, the subject
of the present brief memoir, holds a prominent place as a Gaelic poet. It is true that he was
but little known to the world, but he was much admired as a bard, and greatly respected as
a gentleman in his native "Isle of Mist."

Lachlan Mackinnon, patronimically designated "Lachlan Mac Thearlaich Oig," was born in the
parish of Strath, Isle of Skye, in the year 1665. He was son of Charles Mackinnon of Ceann-Uachdarach,
a cadet of the old family of Mackinnon of Mackinnon of Strath. His mother was Mary Macleod,
daughter of John Macleod of Drynoch, in the same island. The poetical genius of Lachlan Mac
Thearlaich showed itself almost in his infancy. His father, like all Skye gentlemen in those
good olden times, was a very social and hospitable man, who seemed never to be contented unless
he had his house at Ceann-Uachdarach full of neighbours to enjoy themselves in his family circle.
The company were often much amused with little Lachlan when a mere child, seeing the facility
with which he composed couplets on any subject prescribed to him. At the age of eight he possessed
a vigour of mind, and a vivacity of imagination rarely to be met with in youths of more than
double his age. A predilection for poetry seemed to have gained an ascendency in his mind,
over all other pursuits and amusements of his tender years. He received the rudiments of his
education, under a tutor in his father's family, and as his native island had not, at that
remote period, the advantage of public schools of any note, the young bard was sent, at the
age of sixteen, to the school of Nairn, which, from its reputation at the time as an excellent
seminary, was much resorted to by gentlemen's sons from all parts of the north. The young Hebridean
remained at Nairn continuously for three years, and was greatly distinguished, not merely by
his bright talents, but by his assiduity and perseverance in improving them. His studious disposition
and diligent application were amply testified by the progress made by him, and no less duly
appreciated by his superiors in the place. His love for study was enthusiastic, particularly
in regard to the languages. He was by far the best Greek and Latin pupil at the Nairn Academy.
His moments of relaxation were spent in the composition of poems in the English language while
at Nairn, although, undoubtedly, the Gaelic was the medium which was most congenial to his
mind for giving expression in rhyme to his sentiments. At Nairn, however, he composed several
beautiful little pieces, and among the rest a song which was much admired, to the air subsequently
immortalized by Burns as "Auld Lang Syne." Although his productions in English were much admired,
yet, as it was to him an acquired language, they could bear no comparison with his truly superior
compositions in Gaelic. It is a matter of much regret that so few of his Gaelic poems are extant.
Like many bards he unfortunately trusted his productions to his memory; and although well qualified,
as a Gaelic writer, to commit them to paper, yet he neglected it, and hence hundreds of our
best pieces in Gaelic poetry are lost for ever. Had they been all preserved, and given to the
public in a collected shape, they would have raised the talented author to that high rank among
the Celtic bards, which his genius so richly merited.

In appearance Lachlan Mac Thearlaich was tall, handsome, and fascinating. He was distinguished
by a winning gentleness and modesty of manners, as well as by his generous sensibility and
steadfast friendship. His presence was courted in every company, and he was everywhere made
welcome. Of most of the chieftains and Highland lairds he was a very acceptable acquaintance,
while no public assembly, or social meeting was considered complete if that object of universal
favour, the bard of Strath, were absent.

When a very young man he was united in marriage to Flora, daughter of Mr Campbell of Strond,
in the Island of Harris. Fondly attached to his native isle, he rented from his chief the farm
of Breakish, with the grazing Island of Pabbay, at 瞿24 sterling annually. And as an instance
of the many changes effected by time, it may be mentioned that the same tenement is now rented
at about 瞿250 a-year. From what has been said of the bard's amiable disposition and gentle
manners, it will seem no wise surprising that he proved to be one of the most affectionate
of husbands, and dutiful of fathers. The happiness of the matrimonial state was to him, however,
but of short duration. His wife, to whom he was greatly attached, died in the prime and vigour
of life. He was rendered so disconsolate by means of his sudden and unexpected bereavement,
that he took a dislike to the scene of his transient happiness, and relinquished his farm in
Strath. Having removed from Skye, he took possession of a new tenement of lands from Mackenzie
in Kintail. Greatly struck by what he considered the unrefined manners of his new neighbours
in that quarter, and contrasting them with the more genial deportment of his own distinguished
clan in Strath, he had the misfortune to exercise his poetic genius in the composition of some
pungent satires and lampoons directed against the unpolished customs of the natives of Kintail.
It is needless to add that by these means he gained for himself many enemies, and forfeited
the good wishes of all around him. Finding himself thus disagreeably situated, after an absence
of four years, he returned to Skye, where he was cordially received by his chief, and put in
possession of his former farm at Breakish. After being twelve years a widower he went to Inverness
for the purpose of visiting some of his schoolfellows who resided there. Previous to his leaving
the capital of the Highlands his acquaintances there urged upon him the propriety of marrying
a widow lady of the name of Mackintosh, whom they represented as being possessed of considerable
means. He reluctantly complied with their wishes, but it became soon too apparent to him that
he did so at the expense of his own happiness. His bride was not only penniless but deeply
involved in debt. Next morning after his marriage he was visited by messengers who served him
with summonses for a heavy debt due by his wife. In the impulse of the moment, while he held
the summons in his hand, he seized a pen, and having taken his bride's Bible, wrote the following
expressive lines on the blank leaf:--

    "Tha'n saoghal air a roinn,
    Tha d� dh�n ann,
    Tha d�n ann gu bhi sona,
    Ach tha d�n an donuis ann."

This marriage proved, in every respect, an unhappy one. The lady, as a stepmother, was peevish,
harsh, and undutiful. Her cruelty to her husband's children was a continual source of grief
to him, and of unhappiness to his domestic circle. On a certain day, the lady quarrelling with
one of her step-daughters, told her she hated to see her face, and that she always considered
the day an unlucky one on which she had the misfortune to meet her first in the morning. The
girl, inheriting no doubt a share of her father's power of repartee, quickly answered her stepmother,
and said, "You have every cause to believe that it is unlucky to meet me, for I was first-foot
to my dear father the unfortunate morning on which he left home to marry you."

Even amid his misfortunes, which he endured with much forbearance, Lachlan Mac Thearlaich was
renowned for his hospitality and genuine Highland friendship. Remote though the period be since
he lived, still his memory is fondly cherished in the place. He was possessed of so endearing
accomplishments, that time itself can hardly wipe away his memory from the minds of his countrymen
and clan. Many fragments of his numerous songs continued for ages to be repeated in the country,
but it is feared, from all the changes which have taken place in the circumstances of the natives,
that these are now irretrievably lost. Many of his witty sayings became proverbial in the island.
He was one of the first sportsmen in the country, and was considered one of the most successful
deer stalkers of his day. Along with his other accomplishments he was an excellent performer
on the violin, and in this respect he had no equal in the Western Isles. Of him it may be justly
said:--

    "To thee harmonious powers belong,
    That add to verse the charm of song;
    Soft melody with numbers join,
    And make the poet half divine!"

As a proof of Lachlan Mackinnon's loyalty, it may be mentioned that, quite contrary to the
wishes of his chief, he went along with some other loyal subjects, all the way from Skye to
Inverness, in the year 1717, to sign a congratulatory address to George I. on his succeeding
to the British throne. He spent the remainder of his days in his native isle and parish, and
died universally regretted in the year 1734, at the age of sixty-nine. His funeral was attended
by most of the Highland chieftains, and their principal vassals. His cousin-german, Alasdair
Dubh of Glengarry, and all his gentlemen tacksmen were then present, as also Macdonald of the
Isles, Macleod of Dunvegan, Mackinnon of Mackinnon, and Mackenzie of Applecross, with their
chief retainers. A numerous band of Highland pipers preceded the bier playing the usual melancholy
coronach. Amidst a vast assemblage of all ranks and classes his remains were consigned to their
kindred dust in the old churchyard of Gillchrist, being the burying-ground of the parish which
gave him birth. A rude flag, with an inscription, still marks the poet's grave; but the memory
of his many virtues will be handed down in the place to generations yet unborn.

Lachlan Mac Thearlaich composed a beautiful and pathetic song which is still preserved, to
"Generosity, Love, and Liberality." He personified those three, and pretended that he met them
as lonely outcasts in a dreary glen, and addressed them:--

    Latha siubhal sl�ibhe dhomh,
      'S mi 'falbh leam fein gu dl羅th,
    A chuideachd anns an astar sin
      Air gunna glaic a's c羅,
    Gun thachair clann rium anns a' ghleann,
      A'gul gu fann chion i羅il;
    Air leam gur h-iad a b' aillidh dreach
      A chunnacas riamh le m' sh羅il.

    Gu'm b' ioghnadh leam mar tharladh dhoibh
      A'm f�sach fad air ch羅l,
    Coimeas luchd an aghaidhean,
      Gu'n tagha de cheann i羅il,
    Air beannachadh neo-fhiata dhomh
      Gu'n d' fhiaraich mi, "C簷 s羅d?"
    'S fhreagair iad gu cianail mi
      A'm br簿athraibh mine ci羅in.

    "Iochd, a's Gr�dh, a's Fiughantas,
      'Nar tri羅ir gur h-e ar n-ainm,
    Clann nan uaislean urramach,
      A choisinn cliu 's gach ball,
    'Nuair a ph�igh an fh�ile cis d'an E贖g
      'Sa chaidh i fein air ch�ll
    'Na thiomnadh dh' fh�g ar n-athair sinn
      Aig maithibh Innse-Gall."

                                                           SGIATHANACH.

FINGAL.

IN the yellow sunset of ancient Celtic glory appear the band of warriors known as the Ossianic
heroes. Under the magnifying and beautifying influence of that sunset they tower upon our sight
with a stature and illustriousness more than human. Of these heroes, the greatest and best
was Fionn or Fingal. Unless our traditions are extensively falsified he was a man in whom shone
all those virtues which are the boast of our race. The unflinching performance of duty, the
high sense of honour, the tenderness more than woman's, and the readiness to appreciate the
virtues of others were among his more conspicuous characteristics. Now that Celtic anthropology
is being so extensively discussed, is it not remarkable that Fingal, who so truly personifies
the character of that race, is not adduced as the representative Celt? He was a Celt to the
very core, and Celtic character has been in no small degree moulded by copying his example.
He was, in truth, not the ultimus but the Primus Gaelorum.

Nevertheless, it must be confessed that to many English readers Fingal is nothing but a name,
and that even to most of them he looms dark and dim through the mist of years. Unhappily, a
nature so transcendently humane and heroic as his is not the sort to win the admiration of
the vulgar. Nay, so far is its simple grandeur removed above the common materialism of modern
life that the most refined cannot, at first sight, appreciate its exalted loveliness.

The fullest and, we believe, the truest account of him is to be found in Ossian's poems. That
the poetry so denominated was, in substance, composed by Ossian we have no doubt. At any rate
the descriptions of Fingal therein contained are not only consistent throughout, but also in
accordance with all that we know of him from other sources. But were we even to adopt the absurd
theory that Fingal is a creation of Macpherson's imagination, the intrinsic beauty of the picture
well deserves our study.

An old man retaining all the energy, but not the rashness of youth; age with vigour instead
of decrepitude, delighting in the words of sound wisdom rather than the usual tattle of second
childhood; and, withal, an old man who is prone to moralise as old men are; a man able and
willing to do his duty in the present though his heart is left in the past; such is the most
prominent figure in these poems. He is pourtrayed as of tall, athletic frame and kingly port,
his majestic front and hoary locks surmounted by the helm and eagle plume of the Celtic kings.

Though the idea of Fingal pervades most of Ossian's poems he is seldom introduced in propria
persona. Even when attention is directed to him the poet merely and meagerly sketches the herculean
outline, and leaves our imagination to do the rest:--

    At intervals a gleam of light afar
    Glanced from the broad, blue, studded shield of war,
    As moved the king of chiefs in stately pride;
    With eager gaze his eye was turned aside
    To where the warriors' closing ranks he sees;
    Half-grey his ringlets floated in the breeze
    Around that face so terrible in fight
    And features glowing now with grim delight.--Tem. B. V.

In order to introduce his hero with the greater eclat, the bard first places his friends in
great straits; represents them, though brave, as overcome by the enemy and without hope, apart
from Fingal. Both friends and foes speak of him in terms of respect, and even the greatest
leaders acknowledge his superiority. When Fingal appears on the scene the poet rouses himself
to the utmost. He piles simile on simile to give an adequate idea of his first charge--
