King's·Historical·Chart

This chart is arranged in three plates and is so planned that the history of any State may
be traced from date of discovery to the present time. Or the important items of history in
any period may be quickly ascertained.

For example, the question is asked, "Name the divisions of this country in the year 1600 in
order of size?" Turning to the circle for this period the answer is easily ascertained, and
is "Province of Louisiana, New Spain, Virginia, Florida."

"What State was named first; give its history?" Answer, "Florida, discovered in 1512 by De
Leon; ceded to England by Spain in 1763; ceded back to Spain 1783; ceded to United States 1819."

To obtain an answer to such questions from any history would necessitate a waste of much time.
This chart is in itself an

=Encyclopedia of U. S. History=

and will prove invaluable to a school. It furnishes material for study, for composition, for
examinations and reviews, for topical work, and an unlimited amount of other work.
