In excuse of what may be considered as a violent infraction of probability in this chapter,
the author is under the necessity of quoting a tradition which many persons may recollect having
heard. It was always said, though with very little appearance of truth, that upon the Coronation
of the late George III, when the champion of England, Dymock, or his representative, appeared
in Westminster Hall, and in the language of chivalry solemnly wagered his body to defend in
single combat the right of the young King to the crown of these realms, at the moment when
he flung down his gauntlet as the gage of battle, an unknown female stepped from the crowd
and lifted the pledge, leaving another gage in room of it, with a paper expressing, that if
a fair field of combat should be allowed, a champion of rank and birth would appear with equal
arms to dispute the claim of King George to the British kingdoms. The story is probably one
of the numerous fictions which were circulated to keep up the spirits of a sinking faction,
The incident was, however, possible, if it could be supposed to be attended by any motive adequate
to the risk, and might be imagined to occur to a person of Redgauntlet's enthusiastic character.
George III, it is said, had a police of his own, whose agency was so efficient, that the sovereign
was able to tell his prime minister upon one occasion, to his great surprise, that the Pretender
was in London. The prime minister began immediately to talk of measures to be taken, warrants
to be procured, messengers and guards to be got in readiness. 'Pooh, pooh,' said the good-natured
sovereign, since I have found him out, leave me alone to deal with him.'--'And what,' said
the minister, 'is your Majesty's purpose, in so important a case?'--'To leave the young man
to himself,' said George III; 'and when he tires he will go back again.' The truth of this
story does not depend on that of the lifting of the gauntlet; and while the latter could be
but an idle bravado, the former expresses George Ill's goodness of heart and soundness of policy.

NOTE 10.--COLLIER AND SALTER

The persons engaged in these occupations were at this time bondsmen; and in case they left
the ground of the farm to which they belonged, and as pertaining to which their services were
bought or sold, they were liable to be brought back by a summary process. The existence of
this species of slavery being thought irreconcilable with the spirit of liberty, colliers and
salters were declared free, and put upon the same footing with other servants, by the Act 15
Geo. III chapter 28th. They were so far from desiring or prizing the blessing conferred on
them, that they esteemed the interest taken in their freedom to be a mere decree on the part
of the proprietors to get rid of what they called head and harigald money, payable to them
when a female of their number, by bearing a child, made an addition to the live stock of their
master's property.
