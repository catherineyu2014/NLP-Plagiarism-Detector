LETTER ATTRIBUTED TO SIR ROBERT WALPOLE.

In Banks's Dormant Peerage, vol. iii. p. 61., under the account of Pulteney, Earl of Bath,
is the following extraordinary letter, said to be from Sir Robert Walpole to King George II.,
which is introduced as serving to show the discernment of Walpole, as well as the disposition
of the persons by whom he was opposed, but evidently to expose the vanity and weakness of Mr.
Pulteney, by exhibiting the scheme which was to entrap him into the acceptance of a peerage,
and so destroy his popularity. It is dated Jan. 24. 1741, but from no place, and has but little
appearance of authenticity.

    "Most sacred,

    "The violence of the fit of the stone, which has tormented me
    for some days, is now so far abated, that, although it will not
    permit me to have the honour to wait on your majesty, yet is
    kind enough to enable me so far to obey your orders, as to write
    my sentiments concerning that troublesome man, Mr. Pulteney; and
    to point out (what I conceive to be) the most effectual method
    to make him perfectly quiet. Your majesty well knows how by the
    dint of his eloquence he has so captivated the mob, and attained
    an unbounded popularity, that the most manifest wrong appears to
    be right, when adopted and urged by him. Hence it is, that he
    has become not only troublesome but dangerous. The inconsiderate
    multitude think that he has not one object but public good in
    view; although, if they would reflect a little, they would soon
    perceive that spleen against those your majesty has honoured
    with your confidence has greater weight with him than
    patriotism. Since, let any measure be proposed, however
    salutary, if he thinks it comes from me, it is sufficient for
    him to oppose it. Thus, sir, you see the affairs of the most
    momentous concern are subject to the caprice of that popular
    man; and he has nothing to do but call it a ministerial project,
    and bellow out the word favourite, to have an hundred pens
    drawn against it, and a thousand mouths open to contradict it.
    Under these circumstances, he bears up against the ministry
    (and, let me add, against your majesty itself); and every useful
    scheme must be either abandoned, or if it is carried in either
    house, the public are made to believe it is done by a corrupted
    majority. Since these things are thus circumstanced, it is
    become necessary for the public tranquility that he should be
    made quiet; and the only method to do that effectually is to
    destroy his popularity, and ruin the good belief the people have
    in him.

    "In order to do this, he must be invited to court; your majesty
    must condescend to speak to him in the most favourable and
    distinguished manner; you must make him believe that he is the
    only person upon whose opinion you can rely, and to whom your
    people look up for useful measures. As he has already several
    times refused to take the lead in the administration, unless it
    was totally modelled to his fancy, your majesty should close in
    with his advice, and give him leave to arrange the
    administration as he pleases, and put whom he chooses into
    office (there can be no danger in that as you can dismiss him
    when you think fit); and when he has got thus far (to which his
    extreme self-love and the high opinion he entertains of his own
    importance, will easily conduce), it will be necessary that your
    majesty should seem to have a great regard for his health;
    signifying to him that your affairs will be ruined if he should
    die; that you want to have him constantly near you, to have his
    sage advice; and that therefore, as he is much disordered in
    body, and something infirm, it will be necessary for his
    preservation for him to quit the House of Commons, where
    malevolent tempers will be continually fretting him, and where,
    indeed, his presence will be needless, as no step will be taken
    but according to his advice; and that he will let you give him a
    distinguishing mark of your approbation, by creating him a peer.
    This he may be brought to, for, if I know anything of mankind,
    he has a love of honour and money; and, notwithstanding his
    great haughtiness and seeming contempt for honour, he may be won
    if it be done with dexterity. For, as the poet Fenton says,
    'Flattery is an oil that softens the thoughtless fool.'

    "If your majesty can once bring him to accept of a coronet, all
    will be over with him; the changing multitude will cease to have
    any confidence in him; and when you see that, your majesty may
    turn your back to him, dismiss him from his post, turn out his
    meddling partizans, and restore things to quiet; the bee will
    have lost his sting, and become an idle drone whose buzzing
    nobody heeds.

    "Your majesty will pardon me for the freedom with which I have
    given my sentiments and advice; which I should not have done,
    had not your majesty commanded it, and had I not been certain
    that your peace is much disturbed by the contrivance of that
    turbulent man. I shall only add that I will dispose several whom
    I know to wish him well to solicit for his establishment in
    power, that you may seem to yield to their entreaties, and the
    finesse be less liable to be discovered.

    "I hope to have the honour to attend your majesty {305} in a few
    days; which I will do privately, that my public presence may
    give him no umbrage.

    (Signed) ROBERT WALPOLE

    "(Dated) 24. January, 1741."

As it seems incredible that Walpole could have written such a letter; and the editor does not
say where it is taken from, or where the original is, I beg to ask any of your readers whether
they have ever seen the letter elsewhere, or attributed by any other writer to Walpole? The
editor adds, "accordingly, the scheme took place very soon after, and Mr. Pulteney was in 1742
dignified with the titles before mentioned, i.e. Earl of Bath, &c."

BISHOPS OF OSSORY.

Acting on "R.R.'s" excellent suggestion (No. 16. p. 243. antè), I beg to solicit from all collectors,
who may chance to see these lines, information relative to the Bishops of Ossory. I am at present
engaged on a work which will comprise that portion of Harris's edition of Sir James Ware's
Bishops of Ireland bearing on the see of Ossory. The following names are those concerning whom,
especially, information, either original or by reference to rare printed books, will be most
thankfully acknowledged:--

Burton's Anatomy of (Religious) Melancholy.--In compliance with the very useful suggestion
of "R.R." (No. 16. p. 243.), I venture to express my intention of reprinting the latter part
of Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy," (viz. that relating to Religious Melancholy), and at the
same time to intimate my hope that any of your readers who may have it in their power to render
me any assistance, will kindly aid me in the work.

MINOR QUERIES.

Master of Methuen--Ruthven and Gowrie Families.--Colonel Stepney Cowell is desirous of inquiring
who was the Master of Methuen, who fell at the Battle of Pinkey, and whose name appears in
the battle roll as killed?

Was he married, and did he leave a daughter? He is presumed to have been the son of Lord Methuen
by Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII.

Who was the wife of Patrick Ruthven, youngest son of William, first Earl of Gowrie, and where
was he married? Any notices of the Gowrie and Ruthven family will be acceptable.

Brooke's Club, St. James's Street, Feb. 18. 1850.

"The Female Captive: a Narrative of Facts which happened in Barbary in the Year 1756. Written
by herself." 2 vols. 12 mo. Lond. 1769.--Sir William Musgrave has written this note in the
copy which is now in the library of the British Museum:--

    "This is a true story. The lady's maiden name was Marsh. She
    married Mr. Crisp, as related in the narrative; but he, having
    failed in business, went to India, when she remained with her
    father, then Agent Victualler, at Chatham, during which she
    wrote and published these little volumes. On her husband's
    success in India, she went thither to him.

    "The book, having, as it is said, been bought up by the lady's
    friends, is become very scarce."

Can any of your readers furnish a further account of this lady?

Parliamentary Writs.--It is stated in Duncumb's History of Herefordshire, 1. 154. that "the
writs, indentures, and returns, from 17 Edw. IV. to 1 Edw. VI., are all lost throughout England,
except one imperfect bundle, 33rd Hen. VIII." This book was published in 1803. Have the researches
since that time in the Record Offices supplied this hiatus; and if so, in which department
of it are these documents to be found?

W.H.C. Temple.

Portraits in the British Museum.--I have often wished to inquire, but knew not where till your
publication met my notice, as to the portraits in the British Museum, which are at present
hung so high above beasts and birds, and everything else, that it requires better eyes than
most people possess to discern their features. I should suppose {306} that if they were not
originals and of value, they would not have been lodged in the Museum, and if they are, why
not appropriate a room to them, where they might be seen to advantage, by those who take pleasure
in such representations of the celebrated persons of former days? Any information on this subject
will be gratefully received.
