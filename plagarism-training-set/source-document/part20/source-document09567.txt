We believe there are few libraries in this country, however small, in which there is not to
be found one shelf devoted to such pet books on Natural History as White's Selborne, the Journal
of a Naturalist, and Waterton's Wanderings. The writings of Mr. Knox are obviously destined
to take their place in the same honoured spot. Actuated with the same love of nature, and gifted
with the same power of patient observation as White, he differs from him in the wider range
over which he extends his observation, and in combining the ardour of the sportsman with the
scientific spirit of inquiry which distinguishes the naturalist. In his Game Birds and Wild
Fowl: their Friends and their Foes, which contains the result of his observations and experience,
not only on the birds described in his title-page, but on certain other animals supposed, oftentimes
most erroneously, to be injurious to their welfare and increase--we have a work which reflects
the highest credit upon the writer, and can scarcely fail to accomplish the great end for which
Mr Knox wrote it, that of "adding new votaries to a loving observation of nature."

L. J. Blackstone (Book iv. cap. 25.; vol. iv. p. 328. ed 1778) supposes that pressing a mute

of mercy to the delinquent, by delivering him sooner from his torment.
