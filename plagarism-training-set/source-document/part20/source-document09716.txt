La Metairie's 'Olighinsipou' suggests another possible derivation which may be worth mention.
The Indian name of the Alleghanies has been said,--I do not now remember on whose authority,--to
mean 'Endless Mountains.' 'Endless' cannot be more exactly expressed in any Algonkin language
than by 'very long' or 'longest,'--in the Delaware, Eluwi-guneu. "The very long or longest
river" would be Eluwi-guneu sipu, or, if the words were compounded in one, Eluwi-gunesipu.]

[Footnote 23: Paper on Indian names, ut supra, p. 367; Historical Account, &c., pp. 29-32.]

[Footnote 24: Morgan's League of the Iroquois, pp. 466, 468.]

From the river, the name appears to have been transferred by the English to a range of the
"Endless Mountains."

3. NIPPE, NIPI (= n'pi; Narr. nip; Muhh. nup; Abn. and Chip. nebi; Del. m'bi;) and its diminutives,
nippisse and nips, were employed in compound names to denote WATER, generally, without characterizing
it as 'swift flowing,' 'wave moved,' 'tidal,' or 'standing:' as, for example, in the name of
a part of a river, where the stream widening with diminished current becomes lake-like, or
of a stretch of tide-water inland, forming a bay or cove at a river's mouth. By the northern
Algonkins, it appears to have been used for 'lake,' as in the name of Missi-nippi or Missinabe
lake ('great water'), and in that of Lake Nippissing, which has the locative affix, nippis-ing,
'at the small lake' north-east of the greater Lake Huron, which gave a name to the nation of
'Nipissings,' or as the French called them, 'Nipissiriniens,'--according to Charlevoix, the
true Algonkins.

Quinnipiac, regarded as the Indian name of New Haven,--also written Quinnypiock, Quinopiocke,
Quillipiack, &c., and by President Stiles[25] (on the authority of an Indian of East Haven)
Quinnepyooghq,--is, probably, 'long water place,' quinni-nippe-ohke, or quin-nipi-ohke. Kennebec
would seem to be another form of the same name, from the Abnaki, k[oo]né-be-ki, were it not
that Râle wrote,[26] as the name of the river, 'Aghenibékki'--suggesting a different adjectival.
But Biard, in the Relation de la Nouvelle-France of 1611, has 'Kinibequi,' Champlain, Quinebequy,
and Vimont, in 1640, 'Quinibequi,' so that we are justified in regarding the name as the probable
equivalent of Quinni-pi-ohke.

[Footnote 25: Ms. Itinerary. He was careful to preserve the Indian pronunciation of local names,
and the form in which he gives this name convinces me that it is not, as I formerly supposed,
the quinnuppohke (or quinuppeohke) of Eliot,--meaning 'the surrounding country' or the 'land
all about' the site of New Haven.]

Win-nippe-sauki (Winnipiseogee) will be noticed hereafter.

4. -PAUG, -POG, -BOG, (Abn. -béga or -bégat; Del. -pécat;) an inseparable generic, denoting
'WATER AT REST,' 'standing water,' is the substantival component of names of small lakes and
ponds, throughout New England.[27] Some of the most common of these names are,--

[Footnote 27: Paug is regularly formed from pe (Abn. bi), the base of nippe, and may be translated
more exactly by 'where water is' or 'place of water.']

Massa-paug, 'great pond,'--which appears in a great variety of modern forms, as Mashapaug,
Mashpaug, Massapogue, Massapog, &c. A pond in Cranston, near Providence, R.I.; another in Warwick,
in the same State; 'Alexander's Lake,' in Killingly; 'Gardiner's Lake,' in Salem, Bozrah and
Montville; 'Tyler Pond,' in Goshen; ponds in Sharon, Groton, and Lunenburg, Mass., were each
of them the 'Massapaug' or 'great pond' of its vicinity.

Quinni-paug, 'long pond.' One in Killingly, gave a name to Quinebaug River and the 'Quinebaug
country.' Endicott, in 1651, wrote this name 'Qunnubbágge' (3 Mass. Hist. Coll., iv. 191).
"Quinepoxet," the name of a pond and small river in Princeton, Mass., appears to be a corruption
of the diminutive with the locative affix; Quinni-paug-es-it, 'at the little long pond.'

Wongun-paug, 'crooked (or bent) pond.' There is one of the name in Coventry, Conn. Written,
'Wangunbog,' 'Wungumbaug,' &c.

Petuhkqui-paug, 'round pond,' now called 'Dumpling Pond,' in Greenwich, Conn., gave a name
to a plain and brook in that town, and, occasionally, to the plantation settled there, sometimes
written 'Petuckquapock.'

Nunni-paug, 'fresh pond.' One in Edgartown, Martha's Vineyard, gave a name (Nunnepoag) to an
Indian village near it. Eliot wrote nunnipog, for 'fresh water,' in James iii. 12.

Sonki-paug or so[n]ki-paug, 'cool pond.' (Sonkipog, 'cold water,' Eliot.) Egunk-sonkipaug,
or 'the cool pond (spring) of Egunk' hill in Sterling, Conn., is named in Chandler's Survey
of the Mohegan country, as one of the east bounds.

Pahke-paug, 'clear pond' or 'pure water pond.' This name occurs in various forms, as 'Pahcupog,'
a pond near Westerly, R.I.;[28] 'Pauquepaug,' transferred from a pond to a brook in Kent and
New Milford; 'Paquabaug,' near Shepaug River, in Roxbury, &c. 'Pequabuck' river, in Bristol
and Farmington, appears to derive its name from some 'clear pond,'--perhaps the one between
Bristol and Plymouth.

[Footnote 28: A bound of Human Garret's land, one mile north-easterly from Ninigret's old Fort.
See Conn. Col. Records, ii. 314.]

Another noun-generic that denotes 'lake' or 'fresh water at rest,' is found in many Abnaki,
northern Algonkin and Chippewa names, but not, perhaps, in Massachusetts or Connecticut. This
is the Algonkin -g[)a]mi, -g[)o]mi, or -gummee. Kitchi-gami or 'Kechegummee,' the Chippewa
name of Lake Superior, is 'the greatest, or chief lake.' Caucomgomoc, in Maine, is the Abn.
kaäkou-gami-k, 'at Big-Gull lake.' Temi-gami, 'deep lake,' discharges its waters into Ottawa
River, in Canada; Kinou-gami, now Kenocami, 'long lake,' into the Saguenay, at Chicoutimi.

There is a Mitchi-gami or (as sometimes written) machi-gummi, 'large lake,' in northern Wisconsin,
and the river which flows from it has received the same name, with the locative suffix, 'Machig[=a]mig'
(for mitchi-gaming). A branch of this river is now called 'Fence River' from a mitchihikan
or mitchikan, a 'wooden fence' constructed near its banks, by the Indians, for catching deer.[29]
Father Allouez describes, in the 'Relation' for 1670 (p. 96), a sort of 'fence' or weir which
the Indians had built across Fox River, for taking sturgeon &c., and which they called 'Mitihikan;'
and shortly after, he mentions the destruction, by the Iroquois, of a village of Outagamis
(Fox Indians) near his mission station, called Machihigan-ing, ['at the mitchihikan, or weir?']
on the 'Lake of the Illinois,' now Michigan. Father Dablon, in the next year's Relation, calls
this lake 'Mitchiganons.' Perhaps there was some confusion between the names of the 'weir'
and the 'great lake,' and 'Michigan' appears to have been adopted as a kind of compromise between
the two. If so, this modern form of the name is corrupt in more senses than one.[30]

[Footnote 29: Foster and Whitney's Report on the Geology of Lake Superior, &c., Pt. II p. 400.]

[Footnote 30: Râle gives Abn. mitsegan, 'fianté.' Thoreau, fishing in a river in Maine, caught
several sucker-like fishes, which his Abnaki guide threw away, saying they were 'Michegan fish,
i.e., soft and stinking fish, good for nothing.'--Maine Woods, p. 210.]

5. -AMAUG, denoting 'A FISHING PLACE' (Abn. a[n]ma[n]gan, 'on pêche là,') is derived from the
root âm or âma, signifying 'to take by the mouth;' whence, âm-aü, 'he fishes with hook and
line,' and Del. âman, a fish-hook. Wonkemaug for wongun-amaug, 'crooked fishing-place,' between
Warren and New Preston, in Litchfield county, is now 'Raumaug Lake.' Ouschank-amaug, in East
Windsor, was perhaps the 'eel fishing-place.' The lake in Worcester, Quansigamaug, Quansigamug,
&c., and now Quinsigamond, was 'the pickerel fishing-place,' qunnosuog-amaug.

6. ROCK. In composition, -PISK or -PSK (Abn. pesk[oo]; Cree, -pisk; Chip. -bik;) denotes hard
or flint-like rock;[31] -OMPSK or O[N]BSK, and, by phonetic corruption, -MSK, (from ompaé,
'upright,' and -pisk,) a 'standing rock.' As a substantival component of local names, -ompsk
and, with the locative affix, -ompskut, are found in such names as--

[Footnote 31: Primarily, that which 'breaks,' 'cleaves,' 'splits:' distinguishing the harder
rocks--such as were used for making spear and arrow heads, axes, chisels, corn-mortars, &c.,
and for striking fire,--from the softer, such as steatite (soap-stone) from which pots and
other vessels, pipe-bowls, &c., were fashioned.]

Petukqui-ompskut, corrupted to Pettiquamscut, 'at the round rock.' Such a rock, on the east
side of Narrow River, north-east from Tower Hill Church in South Kingston, R.I., was one of
the bound marks of, and gave a name to, the "Pettiquamscut purchase" in the Narragansett country.

Wanashqui-ompskut (wanashquompsqut, Ezekiel xxvi. 14), 'at the top of the rock,' or at 'the
point of rock.' Wonnesquam, Annis Squam, and Squam, near Cape Ann, are perhaps corrupt forms
of the name of some 'rock summit' or 'point of rock' thereabouts. Winnesquamsaukit (for wanashqui-ompsk-ohk-it?)
near Exeter Falls, N.H., has been transformed to Swampscoate and Squamscot. The name of Swamscot
or Swampscot, formerly part of Lynn, Mass., has a different meaning. It is from m'squi-ompsk,
'Red Rock' (the modern name), near the north end of Long Beach, which was perhaps "The clifte"
mentioned as one of the bounds of Mr. Humfrey's Swampscot farm, laid out in 1638.[32] M'squompskut
means 'at the red rock.' The sound of the initial m was easily lost to English ears.[33]

[Footnote 32: Mass. Records, i. 147, 226.]

[Footnote 33: Squantam, the supposed name of an Algonkin deity, is only a corrupt form of the
verb m'squantam, = musqui-antam, 'he is angry,' literally, 'he is red (bloody-) minded.']

Penobscot, a corruption of the Abnaki pa[n]na[oo]a[n]bskek, was originally the name of a locality
on the river so called by the English. Mr. Moses Greenleaf, in a letter to Dr. Morse in 1823,
wrote 'Pe noom´ ske ook' as the Indian name of Old Town Falls, "whence the English name of
the River, which would have been better, Penobscook." He gave, as the meaning of this name,
"Rocky Falls." The St. Francis Indians told Thoreau, that it means "Rocky River."[34] 'At the
fall of the rock' or 'at the descending rock' is a more nearly exact translation. The first
syllable, pen- (Abn. pa[n]na) represents a root meaning 'to fall from a height,'--as in pa[n]n-tek[oo],
'fall of a river' or 'rapids;' pena[n]-ki, 'fall of land,' the descent or downward slope of
a mountain, &c.

[Footnote 34: Maine Woods, pp. 145, 324.]

Keht-ompskqut, or 'Ketumpscut' as it was formerly written,[35]--'at the greatest rock,'--is
corrupted to Catumb, the name of a reef off the west end of Fisher's Island.

[Footnote 35: Pres. Stiles's Itinerary, 1761.]

Tomheganomset[36]--corrupted finally to 'Higganum,' the name of a brook and parish in the north-east
part of Haddam,--appears to have been, originally, the designation of a locality from which
the Indians procured stone suitable for making axes,--tomhegun-ompsk-ut, 'at the tomahawk rock.'
In 'Higganompos,' as the name was sometimes written, without the locative affix, we have less
difficulty in recognizing the substantival -ompsk.

[Footnote 36: Conn. Col. Records, i. 434.]

QUSSUK, another word for 'rock' or 'stone,' used by Eliot and Roger Williams, is not often--perhaps
never found in local names. Hassun or Assun (Chip. assin´; Del. achsin;) appears in New England
names only as an adjectival (assuné, assini, 'stony'), but farther north, it occasionally occurs
as the substantival component of such names as Mistassinni, 'the Great Stone,' which gives
its name to a lake in British America, to a tribe of Indians, and to a river that flows into
St. John's Lake.[37]

[Footnote 37: Hind's Exploration of Labrador, vol. ii. pp. 147, 148.]

7. WADCHU (in composition, -ADCHU) means, always, 'mountain' or 'hill.' In Wachuset, we have
it, with the locative affix -set, 'near' or 'in the vicinity of the mountain,'--a name which
has been transferred to the mountain itself. With the adjectival massa, 'great,' is formed
mass-adchu-set, 'near the great mountain,' or 'great hill country,'--now, Massachusetts.

'Kunckquachu' and 'Quunkwattchu,' mentioned in the deeds of Hadley purchase, in 1658,[38] are
forms of qunu[n]kqu-adchu, 'high mountain,'--afterwards belittled as 'Mount Toby.'

[Footnote 38: History of Hadley, 21, 22, 114.]

'Kearsarge,' the modern name of two well-known mountains in New Hampshire, disguises k[oo]wass-adchu,
'pine mountain.' On Holland's Map, published in 1784, the southern Kearsarge (in Merrimack
county) is marked "Kyarsarga Mountain; by the Indians, Cowissewaschook."[39] In this form,--which
the termination ok (for ohke, auke, 'land,') shows to belong to the region, not exclusively
to the mountain itself,--the analysis becomes more easy. The meaning of the adjectival is perhaps
not quite certain. K[oo]wa (Abn. k[oo]é) 'a pine tree,' with its diminutive, k[oo]wasse, is
a derivative,--from a root which means 'sharp,' 'pointed.' It is possible, that in this synthesis,
the root preserves its primary signification, and that 'Kearsarge' is the 'pointed' or 'peaked
mountain.'

[Footnote 39: W.F. Goodwin, in Historical Magazine, ix. 28.]

Mauch Chunk (Penn.) is from Del. machk, 'bear' and wachtschunk, 'at, or on, the mountain,'--according
to Heckewelder, who writes 'Machkschúnk,' or the Delaware name of 'the bear's mountain.'

In the Abnaki and some other Algonkin dialects, the substantival component of mountain names
is -ÁDENÉ,--an inseparable noun-generic. Katahdin (pronounced Ktaadn by the Indians of Maine),
Abn. Ket-ádené, 'the greatest (or chief) mountain,' is the equivalent of 'Kittatinny,' the
name of a ridge of the Alleghanies, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

8. -KOMUK or KOMAKO (Del. -kamik, -kamiké; Abn. -kamighe; Cree, -gómmik; Powhatan, -comaco;)
cannot be exactly translated by any one English word. It denotes 'place,' in the sense of enclosed,
limited or appropriated space. As a component of local names, it means, generally, 'an enclosure,'
natural or artificial; such as a house or other building, a village, a planted field, a thicket
or place surrounded by trees, &c. The place of residence of the Sachem, which (says Roger Williams)
was "far different from other houses [wigwams], both in capacity, and in the fineness and quality
of their mats," was called sachimâ-komuk, or, as Edward Winslow wrote it, 'sachimo comaco,'--the
Sachem-house. Werowocomoco, Weramocomoco, &c. in Virginia, was the 'Werowance's house,' and
the name appears on Smith's map, at a place "upon the river Pamauncke [now York River], where
the great King [Powhatan] was resident."

Kuppi-komuk, 'closed place,' 'secure enclosure,' was the name of a Pequot fastness in a swamp,
in Groton, Conn. Roger Williams wrote this name "Cuppacommock," and understood its meaning
to be "a refuge, or hiding place." Eliot has kuppóhkomuk for a planted 'grove,' in Deut. xvi.
21, and for a landing-place or safe harbor, Acts xxvii. 40.

Nashaue-komuk, 'half-way house,' was at what is now Chilmark, on Martha's Vineyard, where there
was a village of praying Indians[40] in 1698, and earlier.

[Footnote 40: About half-way from Tisbury to Gay Head.]

The Abnaki keta-kamig[oo] means, according to Râle, 'the main land,'--literally, 'greatest
place;' teteba-kamighé, 'level place,' a plain; pépam-kamighek, 'the all land,' 'l'univers.'

Néssa[oo]a-kamíghé, meaning 'double place' or 'second place,' was the name of the Abnaki village
of St. Francis de Sales, on the St. Lawrence,[41]--to which the mission was removed about 1700,
from its first station established near the Falls of the Chaudière in 1683.[42]

[Footnote 41: Râle, s.v. VILLAGE.]

[Footnote 42: Shea's Hist. of Catholic Missions, 142, 145.]

9. Of two words meaning Island, MUNNOHAN or, rejecting the formative, MUNNOH (Abn. menahan;
Del. menatey; Chip. minís, a diminutive,) is the more common, but is rarely, if ever, found
in composition. The 'Grand Menan,' opposite Passammaquoddy Bay, retains the Abnaki name. Long
Island was Menatey or Manati, 'the Island,'--to the Delawares, Minsi and other neighboring
tribes. Any smaller island was menatan (Mass. munnohhan), the indefinite form, or menates (Mass.
munnises, manisses), the diminutive. Campanius mentions one 'Manathaan,' Coopers' Island (now
Cherry Island) near Fort Christina, in the Delaware,[43] and "Manataanung or Manaates, a place
settled by the Dutch, who built there a clever little town, which went on increasing every
day,"--now called New York. (The termination in -ung is the locative affix.) New York Island
was sometimes spoken of as 'the island'--'Manaté,' 'Manhatte;' sometimes as 'an island'--Manathan,
Menatan, 'Manhatan;' more accurately, as 'the small island'--Manhaates, Manattes, and 'the
Manados' of the Dutch. The Island Indians collectively, were called Manhattans; those of the
small island, 'Manhatesen.' "They deeply mistake," as Gov. Stuyvesant's agents declared, in
1659,[44] "who interpret the general name of Manhattans, unto the particular town built upon
a little Island; because it signified the whole country and province."

[Footnote 43: Description of New Sweden, b. ii. c. 8. (Duponceau's translation.)]

[Footnote 44: N.Y. Hist. Soc. Collections, iii. 375.]

Manisses or Monasses, as Block Island was called, is another form of the diminutive,--from
munnoh; and Manhasset, otherwise written, Munhansick, a name of Shelter Island, is the same
diminutive with the locative affix, munna-es-et. So is 'Manusses' or 'Mennewies,' an island
near Rye, N.Y.,--now written (with the southern form of the locative,) Manussing.

Montauk Point, formerly Montauket, Montacut, and by Roger Williams, Munnawtawkit, is probably
from manati, auke, and -it locative; 'in the Island country,' or 'country of the Islanders.'

The other name of 'Island,' in Algonkin languages, is AHQUEDNE or OCQUIDNE; with the locative;
ahquednet, as in Acts xxvii. 16. (Compare, Cree, ákootin, "it suspends, is sit-uate, e.g. an
island in the water," from âkoo, a verbal root "expressive of a state of rest." Howse's Grammar,
p. 152. Micmac, agwitk, "it is in the water;" whence, Ep-agwit, "it lies [sits?] in the water,"[45]
the Indian name of Prince Edward's Island.) This appears to have been restricted in its application,
to islands lying near the main land or spoken of with reference to the main land. Roger Williams
learned from the Narragansetts to call Rhode Island, Aquiday, Aquednet, &c., 'the Island' or
'at the Island,' and a "little island in the mouth of the Bay," was Aquedenesick,[46] or Aquidneset,
i.e. 'at the small island.'

[Footnote 45: Dawson's Acadian Geology, App. p. 673.]

[Footnote 46: 4th Mass. Hist. Collections, vi. 267.]

Chippaquiddick, the modern name of an island divided by a narrow strait from Martha's Vineyard,
is from cheppi-aquidne, 'separated island.'

Abnaki names ending in -ka[n]tti, or -kontee (Mass. -kontu; Etchemin or Maliseet, -kodiah,
-quoddy; Micmac, -ka[n]di, or -aikadee;) may be placed with those of the first class, though
this termination, representing a substantival component, is really only the locative affix
of nouns in the indefinite plural. Exact location was denoted by affixing, to inanimate nouns-singular,
-et, -it or -ut; proximity, or something less than exact location, by -set, (interposing s,
the characteristic of diminutives and derogatives) between the noun and affix. Plural nouns,
representing a definite number of individuals, or a number which might be regarded as definite,
received -ettu, -ittu, or -uttu, in the locative: but if the number was indefinite, or many
individuals were spoken of collectively, the affix was -kontu, denoting 'where many are,' or
'place of abundance.' For example, wadchu, mountain; wadchu-ut, to, on, or at the mountain;
wadchu-set, near the mountain; wadchuuttu (or -ehtu), in or among certain mountains, known
or indicated (as in Eliot's version of Numbers xxxiii. 47, 48); wadchué-kontu, among mountains,
where there are a great many mountains, for 'in the hill country,' Joshua xiii. 6. So, nippe-kontu,
'in the waters,' i.e. in many waters, or 'where there is much water,' Deut. iv. 18; v. 8. In
Deuteronomy xi. 11, the conversion to a verb of a noun which had previously received this affix,
shows that the idea of abundance or of multitude is associated with it: "ohke wadchuuhkontu[oo],"
i.e. wadechué-kontu-[oo], "the land is a land of hills," that is, where are many hills, or
where hills are plenty.

This form of verb was rarely used by Eliot and is not alluded to in his Grammar. It appears
to have been less common in the Massachusetts than in most of the other Algonkin languages.
In the Chippewa, an 'abundance verb,' as Baraga[47] calls it, may be formed from any noun,
by adding -ka or -[)i]ka for the indicative present: in the Cree, by adding -skow or -ooskow.
In the Abnaki, -ka or -k[oo], or -ik[oo], forms similar verbs, and verbals. The final 'tti
of ka[n]tti, represents the impersonal a'tté, eto, 'there belongs to it,' 'there is there,'
il y a. (Abn. meskik[oo]i'ka[n]tti, 'where there is abundance of grass,' is the equivalent
of the Micmac "m'skeegoo-aicadee, a meadow."[48])

[Footnote 47: Otchipwe Grammar, pp. 87, 412.]

[Footnote 48: Mr. Rand's Micmac Vocabulary, in Schoolcraft's Collections, vol. v. p. 579.]

Among Abnaki place-names having this form, the following deserve notice:--

A[n]mes[oo]k-ka[n]tti, 'where there is plenty of alewives or herrings;' from Abn. a[n]ms[oo]ak
(Narr. aumsûog; Mass. ômmissuog, cotton;) literally, 'small fishes,' but appropriated to fish
of the herring tribe, including alewives and menhaden or bony-fish. Râle gives this as the
name of one of the Abnaki villages on or near the river 'Aghenibekki.' It is the same, probably,
as the 'Meesee Contee' or 'Meesucontee,' at Farmington Falls, on Sandy River, Me.[49] With
the suffix of 'place' or 'land,' it has been written Amessagunticook and Amasaquanteg.

[Footnote 49: Coll. Me. Hist. Society, iv. 31, 105.]

'Amoscoggin,' 'Ammarescoggen,' &c., and the 'Aumoughcawgen' of Capt. John Smith, names given
to the Kennebec or its main western branch, the Androscoggin,[50]--appear to have belonged,
originally, to 'fishing places' on the river, from Abn. a[n]m's[oo]a-khíge, or a[n]m's[oo]a-ka[n]gan.
'Amoskeag,' at the falls of the Merrimack, has the same meaning, probably; a[n]m's[oo]a-khíge
(Mass. ômmissakkeag), a 'fishing-place for alewives.' It certainly does not mean 'beavers,'
or 'pond or marsh' of beavers,--as Mr. Schoolcraft supposed it to mean.[51]
