THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN

I

ENTER CHORUS

A dry snow had fallen steadily throughout the still night, so that when a cold, upper wind
cleared the sky gloriously in the morning the incongruous Indiana town shone in a white harmony--roof,
ledge, and earth as evenly covered as by moonlight.  There was no thaw; only where the line
of factories followed the big bend of the frozen river, their distant chimneys like exclamation
points on a blank page, was there a first threat against the supreme whiteness.  The wind passed
quickly and on high; the shouting of the school-children had ceased at nine o'clock with pitiful
suddenness; no sleigh-bells laughed out on the air; and the muffling of the thoroughfares wrought
an unaccustomed peace like that of Sunday. This was the phenomenon which afforded the opening
of the morning debate of the sages in the wide windows of the "National House."

Only such unfortunates as have so far failed to visit Canaan do not know that the "National
House" is on the Main Street side of the Court-house Square, and has the advantage of being
within two minutes' walk of the railroad station, which is in plain sight of the windows--an
inestimable benefit to the conversation of the aged men who occupied these windows on this
white morning, even as they were wont in summer to hold against all comers the cane-seated
chairs on the pavement outside.  Thence, as trains came and went, they commanded the city gates,
and, seeking motives and adding to the stock of history, narrowly observed and examined into
all who entered or departed.  Their habit was not singular.  He who would foolishly tax the
sages of Canaan with a bucolic light-mindedness must first walk in Piccadilly in early June,
stroll down the Corso in Rome before Ash Wednesday, or regard those windows of Fifth Avenue
whose curtains are withdrawn of a winter Sunday; for in each of these great streets, wherever
the windows, not of trade, are widest, his eyes must behold wise men, like to those of Canaan,
executing always their same purpose.

The difference is in favor of Canaan; the "National House" was the club, but the perusal of
traveller or passer by was here only the spume blown before a stately ship of thought; and
you might hear the sages comparing the Koran with the speeches of Robert J. Ingersoll.

In the days of board sidewalks, "mail-time" had meant a precise moment for Canaan, and even
now, many years after the first postman, it remained somewhat definite to the aged men; for,
out of deference to a pleasant, olden custom, and perhaps partly for an excuse to "get down
to the hotel" (which was not altogether in favor with the elderly ladies), most of them retained
their antique boxes in the post-office, happily in the next building.
