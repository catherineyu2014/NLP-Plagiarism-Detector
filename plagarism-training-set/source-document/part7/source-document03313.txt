H. J. (Norwich). Turner's paper is now quite a precarious article; a specimen which has come
to us of his recent make is full of spots, and the negative useless. Towgood's is admirable
for positives, but it does not appear to do well for iodizing. We hope to be soon able to say
something cheering to Photographers upon a good paper!

Errata.--MR. P. H. FISHER wishes to correct an error in his article on "The Court-house of
Painswick." Vol. viii., p. 596., col. 2., for "The lodge, an old wooden house," read "stone
house." Also in his article in Vol. ix., p. 8., col. 2., for "Rev. ---- Hook," read "Rev. ----
Stock."
