ARCHÆOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.

The Central Committee of the Institute have considered a Resolution, passed at a recent meeting
of the British Archæological Association at Manchester, August 24th, in reference to the expediency
of promoting a union between the Association and the Institute. The Committee desire to give
this public notice, that they are ready, as they have always been, to admit members of the
Association desirous of joining the Institute. They have determined accordingly, that, in order
to offer reasonable encouragement to the members of the Association, they shall henceforth
be eligible without the payment of the customary entrance fee, on the intimation of their wish
to the Committee to be proposed for election. Life-members of the Association shall be eligible
as life-members on payment of half the usual composition. All members of the Association thus
elected shall likewise have the privilege of acquiring the previous publications of the Institute
at the price to original subscribers.

Apartments of the Institute,
26. Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, Sept. 9, 1850.
  By order of the Central Committee,
     H. BOWYER LANE, Secretary.
