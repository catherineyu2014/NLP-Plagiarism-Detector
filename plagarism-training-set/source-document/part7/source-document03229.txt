assignats, see Caron, "Tableaux de Dépréciation du papier-monnaie," Paris, 1909, p. 386.]

[Footnote 39: See especially "Discours de Fabre d'Eglantine," in "Moniteur" for August 11,
1793; also debate in "Moniteur" of September 15, 1793; also Prudhomme's "Révolutions de Paris."
For arguments of much the same tenor, see vast numbers of pamphlets, newspaper articles and
speeches during the "Greenback Craze,"--and the craze for unlimited coinage of silver,--in
the United States.]

[Footnote 42: As to the purchasing power of money at that time, see Arthur Young, "Travels
in France during the Years 1787, 1788 and 1789." For notices of the small currency with examples
of satirical verses written regarding it, see Challamel, "Les français sous la Révolution,"
pp. 307, 308. See also Mercier, "Le Nouveau Paris," edition of 1800, chapter ccv., entitled
"Parchemin Monnaie." A series of these petty notes will be found in the White collection of
the Cornell University Library. They are very dirty and much worn, but being printed on parchment,
remain perfectly legible. For issue of quarter-"sou" pieces see Levasseur, p. 180.]

the Library of Cornell University.]

pp. 181, et seq. Original specimens of these notes, bearing the portrait of Louis XVI will
be found in the Cornell University Library (White Collection) and for the whole series perfectly
photographed in the same collection, Dewarmin, "Cent ans de numismatique française," vol. i,
pp. 143-165.]

and also the lists of the condemned, in the White Collection, also the lists given daily in
the "Moniteur." For the spy system, see Levasseur, vol. i, p. 194.]

[Footnote 52: See Levasseur, as above, vol. i, p. 186. For an argument to show that the Convention
was led into this Draconian legislation, not by necessity, but by its despotic tendencies,
see Von Sybel's "History of the French Revolution," vol. iii, pp. 11, 12. For curious examples
of severe penalties for very slight infringements on the law on the subject, see Louis Blanc,
"Histoire de la Révolution française," tome x, p. 144. For Louis XIVth's claim see "Memoirs
of Louis XIV for the Instruction of the Dauphin."]

For a simple exposition of the way in which the exercise of this power became simply confiscation
of all private property in France, see Mallet Du Pan's "Memoirs," London, 1852, vol. ii, p. 14.]

[Footnote 54: See Du Pont's arguments, as given by Levasseur.]

French assignats to the old American Continental currency, See his "Histoire de la Révolution
française," tome xii, p. 98.]

property went on at periods of the rapid depreciation of paper, see Challamel, "Les français
sous la Révolution," p. 309; also Say, "Economic Politique."]

[Footnote 65: For a very complete table of the depreciation from day to day, see "Supplement
to the Moniteur" of October 2, 1797; also Caron, as above. For the market prices of the louis
