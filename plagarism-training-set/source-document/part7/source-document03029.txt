All these notes are uttered with vehemence, and with such strange and various modulations as
to appear near or distant, in the manner of a ventriloquist. In mild weather, during moonlight
nights, his notes are heard regularly, as though the performer were disputing with the echoes
of his own voice.

The nest of the Chat is built in a thicket, usually in a thorny bush or thick vine five feet
above the ground. It is bulky, composed exteriorly of dry leaves, strips of loose grape vine
bark, and similar materials, and lined with fine grasses and fibrous roots. The eggs are three
to five in number, glossy white, thickly spotted with various shades of rich, reddish brown
and lilac; some specimens however have a greenish tinge, and others a pale pink.
