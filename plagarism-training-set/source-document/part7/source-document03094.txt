POPULAR LITERATURE AND SCIENCE.

THE PALACE OF THE LEATHERSTONEPAUGHS.

Every sentimental traveller to Rome must sometimes wonder if to come to the Eternal City is
not, after all, more of a loss than a gain: Rome unvisited holds such a solitary place in one's
imaginings. It is then a place around which sweeps a different atmosphere from that of any
other city under the sun. One sees it through poetic mists that veil every prosaic reality.
It is arched by an horizon against which the figures of its wonderful history are shadowed
with scarcely less of grandeur and glory than those the old gods cast upon the Sacred Hill.

One who has never seen Rome is thus led to imagine that those of his country-people who have
lived here for years have become in a manner purged of all natural commonplaceness. One thinks
of them as refined--sublimated, so to speak--into beings worthy of reverence and to be spoken
of with awed admiration. For have not their feet wandered where the Caesars' feet have trod,
till that famous ground has become common earth to them? Have they not dwelt in the shadow
of mountains that have trembled beneath the tramp of Goth, Visigoth and Ostrogoth, till those
shadows have become every-day shadows to them? Have they not often watched beneath the same
stars that shone upon knightly vigils, till the whiteness of those shining hosts has made pure
their souls as it purified the heroic ones of old? Have they not listened to the singing and
sighing of the selfsame winds that sung and sighed about the spot where kingly Numa wooed a
nymph, till it must be that into the commoner natures has entered some of the sweetness and
wisdom of that half-divine communion?

Thus the dreamer comes to Rome expecting to enter and become enfolded by those poetic mists,
to live an ideal life amid the tender melancholy that broods over stately and storied ruin,
and to forget for evermore, while within the wondrous precincts, that aught more prosaic exists
than the heroes of history, the fairest visions of art and dreams of poesy.

So came the Leatherstonepaughs. And so have the Leatherstonepaughs sometimes wondered if, after
all, to come to Rome is not more of a loss than a gain in the dimming of one of their fairest
ideals. For is there another city in the world where certain of the vulgar verities of life
press themselves more prominently into view than in the Eternal City? Can one anywhere have
a more forcible conviction that greasy cookery is bile-provoking, and that it is because the
sylvan bovine ruminates so long upon the melancholy Campagna that one's dinners become such
a heavy and sorrowful matter in Rome? Is there any city in the universe where fleas dwarf more
colossally and fiendishly Blake's famous "ghosts" of their kind? Does one anywhere come oftener
in from wet streets, "a dem'd moist, unpleasant body," to more tomblike rooms? Is one anywhere
so ceaselessly haunted by the disagreeable consciousness that one pays ten times as much for
everything one buys as a native pays, and that the trousered descendant of the toga'd Roman
regards the Western barbarian as quite as much his legitimate prey as the barbarian's barelegged
ancestors were the prey of his forefathers before the tables of history were turned, Rome fallen
and breeches supplied to all the world? And are any mortal vistas more gorgeously illuminated
by the red guidebook of the Tourist than are the stately and storied ruins where the sentimentalist
seeketh the brooding of a tender melancholy, and findeth it not in the presence of couriers,
cabmen, beggars, photograph-peddlers, stovepipe hats, tie-backs and bridal giggles?

The dreamer thought to find old Rome crystallized amid its glorious memories. He finds a nineteenth-century
city, with gay shops and fashionable streets, living over the heroic scenes of the ancients
and the actual woe and spiritual mysticism of the mediæval age; and he is disappointed--nay,
even sometimes enraged into a gnashing of the teeth at all things Roman.

But after many weeks, after the sights have been "done," the mouldy and mossy nooks of the
old city explored, and the marvellous picturesqueness that hides in strange places revealed--after
one has a speaking acquaintance with all the broken bits of old statues that gather moth and
rust where the tourist cometh not and the guidebook is not known, and has followed the tiniest
thread of legend or tradition into all manner of mysterious regions,--then the sentimentalist
begins to love Rome again--Rome as it is, not Rome as it seemed through the glamours of individual
imagination.

This is what the Leatherstonepaughs did. But first they fled the companionship of the beloved
but somewhat loudly-shrieking American eagle as that proud bird often appears in the hotels
and pensions of Europe, and lived in a shabby Roman palace, where only the soft bastard Latin
was heard upon the stairs, and where, if any mediæval ghost stalked in rusted armor or glided
in mouldering cerements, it would not understand a single word of their foreign, many-consonanted
speech.

This palace stands, gay and grim, at the corner of a gay street and a dingy vicolo, the street
and alley contrasting in color like a Claude Lorraine with a Nicholas Poussin. Past one side
of the palace drifts all day a bright tide of foreign sightseers, prosperous Romans, gay models
and flower-venders, handsome carriages, dark-eyed girls with their sallow chaperones, and olive-cheeked,
huge-checked jeunesse dorée, evidently seeking for pretty faces as for pearls of great price,
as is the manner of the jeunesse dorée of the Eternal City; while down upon the scene looks
a succession of dwelling-houses, a gray-walled convent or two, one of the stateliest palaces
of Rome--now let out in apartments and hiding in obscure rooms the last two impoverished descendants
of a proud race that helped to impoverish Rome--one or two more prosperous palaces, and a venerable
church, looking like a sleepy watchman of Zion suffering the enemy to do as it will before
his closed eyes.

On the other side is the vicolo, dark of wall and dank of pavement, with petticoats and shirts
dangling from numerous windows and fluttering like gibbeted wretches in the air; with frowzy
women sewing or knitting in the sombre doorways and squalid urchins screaming everywhere; with
humble vegetables and cheap wines exposed for sale in dirty windows; with usually a carriage
or two undergoing a washing at some stable-door; and with almost always an amorous Romeo or
two from some brighter region wandering hopefully to and fro amid the unpicturesque gloom of
this Roman lane to catch a wafted kiss or a dropped letter from the rear window of his Juliet's
home. For nowhere else in Europe, Asia, America, the Oceanic Archipelago or the Better Land
can the Romeo-and-Juliet business be more openly and freely carried on than in the by-streets
of the Eternal City, where girls are thought to be as jealously secluded from the monster Man
as are the women of a Turkish seraglio or the nuns of a European convent. These Romeos and
Juliets usually seem quite indifferent to the number of unsympathetic eyes that watch their
little drama, providing only Papa and Mamma Capulet are kept in the dark in the shop below.
Even the observation of Signor and Signora Montague would disturb them little, for it is only
Juliet who is guarded, and Romeo is evidently expected to get all the fun out of life he can.
In their dingy vicolo the Leatherstonepaughs have seen three Romeos watching three windows
at the same twilight moment. One of them stood under an open window in the third story, from
whence a line was dropped down to receive the letter he held in his hand. Just as the letter-weighted
line was drawn up a window immediately below Juliet's was thrown violently open, and an unromantic
head appeared to empty vials of wrath upon the spectacled Romeo below for always hanging about
the windows of the silly pizzicarole girls above and giving the house a ridiculous appearance
in the eyes of the passers-by. Romeo answered audaciously that the signora was mistaken in
the man, that he had never been under that window before in his life, had never seen the Signorina
Juliet, daughter of Capulet the pizzicarole who lived above, but that he was merely accompanying
his friend Romeo, who loved Juliet the daughter of the drochiere who lived a story below, and
who was now wooing her softly two or three windows away. A shriek was his response as the wrathful
head disappeared, while the lying Romeo laughed wickedly and the Leatherstonepaughs immoderately,
in spite of themselves, to see Juliet, daughter of the drochiere, electrically abstracted from
her window as if by the sudden application of a four-hundred-enraged-mother-power to her lofty
chignon from behind, while the three Romeos, evidently all strangers to each other, folded
their tents like the Arab and silently stole away. 

The Leatherstonepaughs always suspected that no lordly race, from father's father to son's
son, had ever dwelt in their immense palace. They suspected rather that it was, like many another
mighty Roman pile, reared by plebeian gains to shelter noble Romans fair and proud whom Fate
confined to economical "flats," and whose wounded pride could best be poulticed by the word
palazzo.

Hans Christian Andersen knew this palace well, and has described it as the early home of his
Improvisatore. In those days two fountains tinkled, one within, the other just outside, the
dusky iron-barred basement. One fountain, however, has ceased to flow, and now if a passer-by
peeps in at the grated window, whence issue hot strong vapors and bursts of merry laughter,
he will see a huge stone basin into whose foaming contents one fountain drips, and over which
a dozen washerwomen bend and pound with all their might and main in a bit of chiaroscuro that
reminds one of Correggio.

Over this Correggio glimpse wide stone stairs lead past dungeon-like doors up five flights
to the skylighted roof. Each of these doors has a tiny opening through which gleams a watchful
eye and comes the sound of the inevitable "Chi è?" whenever the doorbell rings, as if each
comer were an armed marauder strayed down from the Middle Ages, who must be well reconnoitred
before the fortress-gates are unbarred.

It was in the ultimo piano that the Leatherstonepaughs pitched their lodge in a vast wilderness
of colorful tiled roofs, moss-grown and lichen-laden, amid a forest of quaintly-shaped and
smokeless chimneys. Their floors, guiltless of rugs or carpets, were of earthen tiles and worn
into hollows where the feet of the palace-dwellers passed oftenest to and fro. A multitude
of undraped windows opened like doors upon stone balconies, whither the inhabitants flew like
a startled covey of birds every time the king and queen drove by in the street below, and upon
which they passed always from room to room. The outer balcony looks down upon the Piazza Barberini
and its famous Spouting Triton, with an horizon-line over the roofs broken by gloomy stone-pines
and cypresses that seem to have grown from the buried griefs of Rome's dead centuries. The
inner balcony overlooks the court, where through the wide windows of every story, amid the
potted plants and climbing vines that never take on a shade of pallor in an Italian winter,
and that adorn every Roman balcony, one could see into the penetralia of a dozen Roman families
and wrest thence the most vital secrets--even to how much Romano Alfredo drank at dinner or
whether lemon-juice or sour wine gave piquancy to Rosina's salad. Entirely unacquainted with
these descendants of ancient patrician or pleb, the Leatherstonepaughs ventilated original
and individual theories concerning them, and gave them names of their own choosing.

"Rameses the Great has quarrelled with the Sphinx and is flirting with the Pyramid," whispered
young Cain one day as some of the family, leaning over the iron railing, looked into the leafy,
azure-domed vault below, and saw into the dining-room of a family whose mysteriousness of habit
and un-Italian blankness of face gave them a fanciful resemblance to the eternal riddles of
the Orient.

The "Pyramid," whose wide feet and tiny head gave her her triangular title, was evidently a
teacher, for she so often carried exercise-books and dog-eared grammars in her hand. She chanced
at that moment to glance upward. "Lucia," she cried to the Sphinx, speaking with an Italian
accent that she flattered herself was to the down-gazers an unknown tongue, "do look up to
the fifth loggia. If there isn't the Huge Bear, the Middle-sized Bear and the Wee Bear looking
as if they wanted to come down and eat us up!"

"Y' ain't fat 'nuf," yelled the Wee Bear before the elder Bruins had time to squelch him.

The studio-salon of the Leatherstonepaughs amid the clouds and chimneys of the Eternal City
was a chapter for the curious. It was as spacious as a country meeting-house, as lofty as befits
a palace. It was frescoed like some of the modern pseudo-Gothic and pine cathedrals that adorn
the village-greens of New England hamlets, and its pot-pourri of artistic ideas was rich in
helmeted Minervas, vine-wreathed Bacchuses, winged Apollos and nameless classic nymphs, all
staring downward from the spandrels of pointed arches with quite as much at-homeness as Olympian
heroes would feel amid the mystic shades of the Scandinavian Walhalla. This room was magnificent
with crimson upholstery, upon which rested a multitude of scarlet-embroidered cushions that
seemed to the color-loving eye like a dream of plum-pudding after a nightmare of mince-pie.
Through this magnificence had drifted, while yet the Leatherstonepaughs saw Rome in all its
idealizing mists, generations of artists. Sometimes these artists had had a sublime disdain
of base lucre, and sometimes base lucre had had a sublime disdain of them. Some of the latter
class--whose name is Legion--had marked their passage by busts, statuettes and paintings that
served to remind Signora Anina, their landlady, that promises of a remittance can be as fair
and false as the song of the Sirens or the guile of the Loreley. Crusaders in armor brandished
their lances there in evidence that Michael Angelo Bivins never sent from Manhattan the bit
of white paper to redeem them. Antignone--usually wearing a Leatherstonepaugh bonnet--mourned
that Praxiteles Periwinkle faded out of the vistas of Rome to the banks of the Thames without
her. Dancing Floras seemed joyous that they had not gone wandering among the Theban Colossi
with Zefferino, instead of staying to pay for his Roman lodging; while the walls smiled, wept,
simpered, threatened and gloomed with Madonnas, Dolorosas, Beatrices, sprites, angels and fiends,
the authors of whose being had long ago drifted away on the ocean of poverty which sweeps about
the world, and beneath which sometimes the richest-freighted ships go down. In the twenty years
that Signora Anina has let her rooms to artists many such tragedies have written significant
and dreary lines upon her walls.

That studio-salon was rich not alone in painting and sculpture. The whatnot was a museum whither
might come the Northern Goth and Southern Vandal to learn what a Roman home can teach of the
artistic taste that Matthew Arnold declares to be the natural heritage only of the nation which
rocked the cradle of the Renaissance when its old Romanesque and Byzantine parents died. That
whatnot was covered with tiny china dogs and cats, such as we benighted American Goths buy
for ten cents a dozen to fill up the crevices in Billy's and Bobby's Christmas stockings. Fancy
inkstands stood cheek by jowl with wire flower-baskets that were stuffed with crewel roses
of such outrageous hues as would make the Angel of Color blaspheme. Cut-glass spoon-holders
kept in countenance shining plated table-casters eternally and spotlessly divorced from the
purpose of their being. There were gaudy china vases by the dozen and simpering china shepherdesses
by the score. There were plaster casts of the whole of Signora Anina's family of nine children,
from the elder fiery Achilles to the younger hysterical Niobe. There were perfume-bottles enough
to start a coiffeur in business, and woolly lambs enough for a dozen pastoral poems or as many
bucolic butchers. But the piano was piled high with Beethoven's sonatas and Chopin's delicious
dream-music, while a deluge of French novels had evidently surged over that palace of the Leatherstonepaughs.

When the family took possession of their share of the palazzo a corner of this studio-salon
was dedicated to a peculiar member of their family. From that corner she seldom moved save
as she swept away in some such elegant costume as the others wore only upon gala-occasions,
or in some picturesque or wildly-fantastic garb that would have lodged her in a policeman's
care had she ever been suffered to escape thus from the palace. All day long, day after day,
she tarried in her corner mute and motionless, eying all comers and goers with a haughty stare.
Sometimes she leaned there with rigid finger pressed upon her lip, like a statue of Silence;
sometimes her hands were pressed pathetically to her breast, like a Mater Dolorosa; sometimes
both arms hung lax and limp by her side, like those of a heart-broken creature; and sometimes
she wildly clutched empty air, like a Leatherstonepaugh enthusiastically inebriated or gone
stark, staring, raving mad!

Yet never, never, never was Silentia Leatherstonepaugh known to break that dreadful silence,
even though honored guests spoke to her kindly, and although young Cain Leatherstonepaugh repeatedly
reviled her as had she been Abel's wife. One day came an old Spanish monk of whom Leah and
Rachel would learn the language of Castile. Silentia gloomed in her dusky corner unseen of
the monk, who was left with her an instant alone. A few moments before, moved perhaps by a
dawning comprehension of the unspeakable pathos of her fate, young Cain had given her a dagger.
When, two minutes after the monk's arrival, Leah and Rachel entered the room, a black sighing
mass cowered in a corner of the sofa, while Silentia rose spectre-like in the dimness, the
dagger pointed toward her heart.
