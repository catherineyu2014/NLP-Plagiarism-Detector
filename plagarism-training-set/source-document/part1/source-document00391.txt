THE DISCOVERY OF THE SOURCE OF THE NILE

By John Hanning Speke

John Hanning Speke, born 1827. Served in the Punjab but left in 1854 to explore Somaliland.
Discovered Lake Tanganyika with Burton, and Lake Victoria independently. Was, with Grant, the
first European to cross equatorial africa. Died 1864.

Editor's Note

John Hanning Speke was a man of thirty-six, when his Nile Journal appeared. He had entered
the army in 1844, and completed ten years of service in India, serving through the Punjab Campaign.
Already he had conceived the idea of exploring Africa, before his ten years were up, and on
their conclusion he was appointed a member of the expedition preparing to start under Sir Richard
(then Lieutenant Burton) for the Somali country. He was wounded by the Somalis, and returned
to England on sick leave; the Crimean War then breaking out, be served through it, and later,
December 1856, joined another expedition under Burton. Then it was that the possibility of
the source of the Nile being traced to one of the inland lakes seems to have struck him.

Burton's illness prevented him accompanying Speke on the latter's visit to the lake now known
as Victoria Nyanza. During this expedition Speke reached the most southerly point of the lake,
and gave it its present name. Speke arrived back in England in the spring of 1859, Burton being
left behind on account of his illness. The relations between the two had become strained, and
this was accentuated by Speke's hast to publish the account of his explorations. He was given
the command of another expedition which left England in April 1860, in company with Captain
James Augustus Grant, to ascertain still further if the Victoria Nyanza were indeed the source
of the Nile. He met Sir Samuel Baker, to whom he gave valuable assistance, and who with his
clue discovered the third lake, Albert Nyanza.

Speke telegraphed early in 1863, that the Nile source was traced. Returning to England that
year he met with an ovation, and addressed a special meeting of the Geographical Society, and
the same year, 1863, published his "Journal of the Discovery of the Nile." Opposed in his statements
by Burton and M'Queen ("The Nile Basin, 1864"), it was arranged that he and Burton should meet
for a debate, when on the very day fixed, Speke accidentally shot himself while out partridge-shooting.

Sir R. Murchison, addressing the Royal Geographical Society that year, speaks of Speke's discovery
of the source of the Nile as solving the "problem of all ages."

Only two books were published by Speke--the "Journal" of 1863, which follows, and its sequel--"What
Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile," which appeared in the year of his death, 1864.

Introduction.

In the following pages I have endeavoured to describe all that appeared to me most important
and interesting among the events and the scenes that came under my notice during my sojourn
in the interior of Africa. If my account should not entirely harmonise with preconceived notions
as to primitive races, I cannot help it. I profess accurately to describe native Africa--Africa
in those places where it has not received the slightest impulse, whether for good or evil,
from European civilisation. If the picture be a dark one, we should, when contemplating these
sons of Noah, try and carry our mind back to that time when our poor elder brother Ham was
cursed by his father, and condemned to be the slave of both Shem and Japheth; for as they were
then, so they appear to be now--a strikingly existing proof of the Holy Scriptures. But one
thing must be remembered: Whilst the people of Europe and Asia were blessed by communion with
God through the medium of His prophets, and obtained divine laws to regulate their ways and
keep them in mind of Him who made them, the Africans were excluded from this dispensation,
and consequently have no idea of an overruling Providence or a future state; they therefore
trust to luck and to charms, and think only of self-preservation in this world. Whatever, then,
may be said against them for being too avaricious or too destitute of fellow-feeling, should
rather reflect on ourselves, who have been so much better favoured, yet have neglected to teach
them, than on those who, whilst they are sinning, know not what they are doing. To say a negro
is incapable of instruction, is a mere absurdity; for those few boys who have been educated
in our schools have proved themselves even quicker than our own at learning; whilst, amongst
themselves, the deepness of their cunning and their power of repartee are quite surprising,
and are especially shown in their proficiency for telling lies most appropriately in preference
to truth, and with an off-handed manner that makes them most amusing.

With these remarks, I now give, as an appropriate introduction to my narrative--(1.) An account
of the general geographical features of the countries we are about to travel in, leaving the
details to be treated under each as we successively pass through them; (2.) A general view
of the atmospheric agents which wear down and so continually help to reduce the continent,
yet at the same time assist to clothe it with vegetation; (3.) A general view of the Flora;
and, lastly, that which consumes it, (4.) Its Fauna; ending with a few special remarks on the
Wanguana, or men freed from slavery.

Geography

The continent of Africa is something like a dish turned upside down, having a high and flat
central plateau, with a higher rim of hills surrounding it; from below which, exterially, it
suddenly slopes down to the flat strip of land bordering on the sea. A dish, however, is generally
uniform in shape--Africa is not. For instance, we find in its centre a high group of hills
surrounding the head of the Tanganyika Lake, composed chiefly of argillaceous sandstones which
I suppose to be the Lunae Montes of Ptolemy, or the Soma Giri of the ancient Hindus. Further,
instead of a rim at the northern end, the country shelves down from the equator to the Mediterranean
Sea; and on the general surface of the interior plateau there are basins full of water (lakes),
from which, when rains overflow them, rivers are formed, that, cutting through the flanking
rim of hills, find their way to the sea.

Atmospheric Agents

On the east coast, near Zanzibar, we find the rains following the track of the sun, and lasting
not more than forty days on any part that the sun crosses; whilst the winds blow from south-west
or north-east, towards the regions heated by its vertical position. But in the centre of the
continent, within 5° of the equator, we find the rains much more lasting. For instance, at
5° south latitude, for the whole six months that the sun is in the south, rain continues to
fall, and I have heard that the same takes place at 5° north; whilst on the equator, or rather
a trifle to northward of it, it rains more or less the whole year round, but most at the equinoxes,
as shown in the table on the following page. The winds, though somewhat less steady, are still
very determinable. With an easterly tending, they deflect north and south, following the sun.
In the drier season they blow so cold that the sun's heat is not distressing; and in consequence
of this, and the average altitude of the plateau, which is 3000 feet, the general temperature
of the atmosphere is very pleasant, as I found from experience; for I walked every inch of
the journey dressed in thick woollen clothes, and slept every night between blankets.

Flora

From what has been said regarding the condition of the atmosphere, it may readily be imagined
that Africa, in those parts, after all, is not so bad as people supposed it was; for, when
so much moisture falls under a vertical sun, all vegetable life must grow up almost spontaneously.
It does so on the equator in the most profuse manner; but down at 5° south, where there are
six months' drought, the case is somewhat different; and the people would be subject to famines
if they did not take advantage of their rainy season to lay in sufficient stores for the fine:
and here we touch on the misfortune of the country; for the negro is too lazy to do so effectively,
owing chiefly, as we shall see presently, to want of a strong protecting government. One substantial
fact has been established, owing to our having crossed over ten degrees of latitude in the
centre of the continent, or from 5° south to 5° north latitude, which is this: There exists
a regular gradation of fertility, surprisingly rich on the equator, but decreasing systematically
from it; and the reason why this great fertile zone is confined to the equatorial regions,
is the same as that which has constituted it the great focus of water or lake supply, whence
issue the principal rivers of Africa. On the equator lie the rainbearing influences of the
Mountains of the Moon. The equatorial line is, in fact, the centre of atmospheric motion.

Fauna

In treating of this branch of natural history, we will first take man--the true curly-head,
flab-nosed, pouch-mouthed negro--not the Wahuma. [2] They are well distributed all over these
latitudes, but are not found anywhere in dense communities. Their system of government is mostly
of the patriarchal character. Some are pastorals, but most are agriculturalists; and this difference,
I believe, originates solely from want of a stable government, to enable them to reap what
they produce; for where the negro can save his cattle, which is his wealth, by eating grain,
he will do it. In the same way as all animals, whether wild or tame, require a guide to lead
their flocks, so do the negroes find it necessary to have chiefs over their villages and little
communities, who are their referees on all domestic or political questions. They have both
their district and their village chiefs, but, in the countries we are about to travel over,
no kings such as we shall find that the Wahuma have. The district chief is absolute, though
guided in great measure by his "grey-beards," who constantly attend his residence, and talk
over their affairs of state. These commonly concern petty internal matters; for they are too
selfish and too narrow-minded to care for anything but their own private concerns. The grey-beards
circulate the orders of the chief amongst the village chiefs, who are fined when they do not
comply with them; and hence all orders are pretty well obeyed.

One thing only tends to disorganise the country, and that is war, caused, in the first instance,
by polygamy, producing a family of half-brothers, who, all aspiring to succeed their father,
fight continually with one another, and make their chief aim slaves and cattle; whilst, in
the second instance, slavery keeps them ever fighting and reducing their numbers. The government
revenues are levied, on a very small scale, exclusively for the benefit of the chief and his
grey-beards. For instance, as a sort of land-tax, the chief has a right to drink free from
the village brews of pombe (a kind of beer made by fermentation), which are made in turn by
all the villagers successively. In case of an elephant being killed, he also takes a share
of the meat, and claims one of its tusks as his right; further, all leopard, lion, or zebra
skins are his by right. On merchandise brought into the country by traders, he has a general
right to make any exactions he thinks he has the power of enforcing, without any regard to
justice or a regulated tariff. This right is called Hongo, in the plural Mahongo. Another source
of revenue is in the effects of all people condemned for sorcery, who are either burnt, or
speared and cast into the jungles, and their property seized by the grey-beards for their chief.

As to punishments, all irreclaimable thieves or murderers are killed and disposed of in the
same manner as these sorcerers; whilst on minor thieves a penalty equivalent to the extent
of the depredation is levied. Illicit intercourse being treated as petty larceny, a value is
fixed according to the value of the woman--for it must be remembered all women are property.
Indeed, marriages are considered a very profitable speculation, the girl's hand being in the
father's gift, who marries her to any one who will pay her price. This arrangement, however,
is not considered a simple matter of buying and selling, but delights in the high-sounding
title of "dowry." Slaves, cows, goats, fowls, brass wire, or beads, are the usual things given
for this species of dowry. The marriage-knot, however, is never irretrievably tied; for if
the wife finds a defect in her husband, she can return to her father by refunding the dowry;
whilst the husband, if he objects to his wife, can claim half-price on sending her home again,
which is considered fair, because as a second-hand article her future value would be diminished
by half. By this system, it must be observed, polygamy is a source of wealth, since a man's
means are measured by the number of his progeny; but it has other advantages besides the dowry,
for the women work more than the men do, both in and out of doors; and, in addition to the
females, the sons work for the household until they marry, and in after life take care of their
parents in the same way as in the first instance the parents took care of them.

Twins are usually hailed with delight, because they swell the power of the family, though in
some instances they are put to death. Albinos are valued, though their colour is not admired.
If death occurs in a natural manner, the body is usually either buried in the village or outside.
A large portion of the negro races affect nudity, despising clothing as effeminate; but these
are chiefly the more boisterous roving pastorals, who are too lazy either to grow cotton or
strip the trees of their bark. Their young women go naked; but the mothers suspend a little
tail both before and behind. As the hair of the negro will not grow long, a barber might be
dispensed with, were it not that they delight in odd fashions, and are therefore continually
either shaving it off altogether, or else fashioning it after the most whimsical designs. No
people in the world are so proud and headstrong as the negroes, whether they be pastoral or
agriculturalists. With them, as with the rest of the world, "familiarity breeds contempt";
hospitality lives only one day; for though proud of a rich or white visitor--and they implore
him to stop, that they may keep feeding their eyes on his curiosities--they seldom give more
than a cow or a goat, though professing to supply a whole camp with provisions.

Taking the negroes as a whole, one does not find very marked or much difference in them. Each
tribe has its characteristics, it is true. For instance, one cuts his teeth or tattoos his
face in a different manner from the others; but by the constant intermarriage with slaves,
much of this effect is lost, and it is further lost sight of owing to the prevalence of migrations
caused by wars and the division of governments. As with the tribal marks so with their weapons;
those most commonly in use are the spear, assage, shield, bow and arrow. It is true some affect
one, some the other; but in no way do we see that the courage of tribes can be determined by
the use of any particular weapon: for the bravest use the arrow, which is the more dreaded;
while the weakest confine themselves to the spear. Lines of traffic are the worst tracks (there
are no roads in the districts here referred to) for a traveller to go upon, not only because
the hospitality of the people has been damped by frequent communication with travellers, but,
by intercourse with the semi-civilised merchant, their natural honour and honesty are corrupted,
their cupidity is increased, and the show of firearms ceases to frighten them.

Of paramount consideration is the power held by the magician (Mganga), who rules the minds
of the kings as did the old popes of Europe. They, indeed, are a curse to the traveller; for
if it suits their inclinations to keep him out of the country, they have merely to prognosticate
all sorts of calamities--as droughts, famines, or wars--in the event of his setting eyes on
the soil, and the chiefs, people, and all, would believe them; for, as may be imagined, with
men unenlightened, supernatural and imaginary predictions work with more force than substantial
reasons. Their implement of divination, simple as it may appear, is a cow's or antelope's horn
(Uganga), which they stuff with magic powder, also called Uganga. Stuck into the ground in
front of the village, it is supposed to have sufficient power to ward off the attacks of an enemy.

By simply holding it in the hand, the magician pretends he can discover anything that has been
stolen or lost; and instances have been told of its dragging four men after it with irresistible
impetus up to a thief, when it be-laboured the culprit and drove him out of his senses. So
imbued are the natives' minds with belief in the power of charms, that they pay the magician
for sticks, stones, or mud, which he has doctored for them. They believe certain flowers held
in the hand will conduct them to anything lost; as also that the voice of certain wild animals,
birds, or beasts, will insure them good-luck, or warn them of danger. With the utmost complacency
our sable brother builds a dwarf hut in his fields, and places some grain on it to propitiate
the evil spirit, and suffer him to reap the fruits of his labour, and this too they call Uganga
or church.

These are a few of the more innocent alternatives the poor negroes resort to in place of a
"Saviour." They have also many other and more horrible devices. For instance, in times of tribulation,
the magician, if he ascertains a war is projected by inspecting the blood and bones of a fowl
which he has flayed for that purpose, flays a young child, and having laid it lengthwise on
a path, directs all the warriors, on proceeding to battle, to step over his sacrifice and insure
themselves victory. Another of these extra barbarous devices takes place when a chief wishes
to make war on his neighbour by his calling in a magician to discover a propitious time for
commencing. The doctor places a large earthen vessel, half full of water, over a fire, and
over its mouth a grating of sticks, whereon he lays a small child and a fowl side by side,
and covers them over with a second large earthen vessel, just like the first, only inverted,
to keep the steam in, when he sets fire below, cooks for a certain period of time, and then
looks to see if his victims are still living or dead--when, should they be dead, the war must
be deferred, but, otherwise commenced at once.

These extremes, however, are not often resorted to, for the natives are usually content with
simpler means, such as flaying a goat, instead of a child, to be walked over; while, to prevent
any evil approaching their dwellings a squashed frog, or any other such absurdity, when place
on the track, is considered a specific.

How the negro has lived so many ages without advancing, seems marvellous, when all the countries
surrounding Africa are so forward in comparison; and judging from the progressive state of
the world, one is led to suppose that the African must soon either step out from his darkness,
or be superseded by a being superior to himself. Could a government be formed for them like
ours in India, they would be saved; but without it, I fear there is very little chance; for
at present the African neither can help himself nor will he be helped about by others, because
his country is in such a constant state of turmoil he has too much anxiety on hand looking
out for his food to think of anything else. As his fathers ever did, so does he. He works his
wife, sells his children, enslaves all he can lay hands upon, and, unless when fighting for
the property of others, contents himself with drinking, singing, and dancing like a baboon
to drive dull care away. A few only make cotton cloth, or work in wood, iron, copper, or salt;
their rule being to do as little as possible, and to store up nothing beyond the necessities
of the next season, lest their chiefs or neighbours should covet and take it from them.

Slavery, I may add, is one great cause of laziness, for the masters become too proud to work,
lest they should be thought slaves themselves. In consequence of this, the women look after
the household work--such as brewing, cooking, grinding corn, making pottery and baskets, and
taking care of the house and the children, besides helping the slaves whilst cultivating, or
even tending the cattle sometimes.

Now, descending to the inferior order of creation, I shall commence with the domestic animals
first, to show what the traveller may expect to find for his usual support. Cows, after leaving
the low lands near the coast, are found to be plentiful everywhere, and to produce milk in
small quantities, from which butter is made. Goats are common all over Africa; but sheep are
not so plentiful, nor do they show such good breeding--being generally lanky, with long fat
tails. Fowls, much like those in India, are abundant everywhere. A few Muscovy ducks are imported,
also pigeons and cats. Dogs, like the Indian pariah, are very plentiful, only much smaller;
and a few donkeys are found in certain localities. Now, considering this good supply of meat,
whilst all tropical plants will grow just as well in central equatorial Africa as they do in
India, it surprises the traveller there should be any famines; yet such is too often the case,
and the negro, with these bounties within his reach, is sometimes found eating dogs, cats,
rats, porcupines, snakes, lizards, tortoises, locusts, and white ants, or is forced to seek
the seeds of wild grasses, or to pluck wild herbs, fruits, and roots; whilst at the proper
seasons they hunt the wild elephant, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, pigs, and antelopes; or, going
out with their arrows, have battues against the guinea-fowls and small birds.

The frequency with which collections of villages are found all over the countries we are alluding
to, leaves but very little scope for the runs of wild animals, which are found only in dense
jungles, open forests, or praires generally speaking, where hills can protect them, and near
rivers whose marshes produce a thick growth of vegetation to conceal them from their most dreaded
enemy--man. The prowling, restless elephant, for instance, though rarely seen, leaves indications
of his nocturnal excursions in every wilderness, by wantonly knocking down the forest-trees.
The morose rhinoceros, though less numerous, are found in every thick jungle. So is the savage
buffalo, especially delighting in dark places, where he can wallow in the mud and slake his
thirst without much trouble; and here also we find the wild pig.

The gruff hippopotamus is as widespread as any, being found wherever there is water to float
him; whilst the shy giraffe and zebra affect all open forests and plains where the grass is
not too long; and antelopes, of great variety in species and habits, are found wherever man
will let them alone and they can find water. The lion is, however, rarely heard--much more
seldom seen. Hyenas are numerous, and thievishly inclined. Leopards, less common, are the terror
of the villagers. Foxes are not numerous, but frighten the black traveller by their ill-omened
bark. Hares, about half the size of English ones--there are no rabbits--are widely spread,
but not numerous; porcupines the same. Wild cats, and animals of the ferret kind, destroy game.
Monkeys of various kinds and squirrels harbour in the trees, but are rarely seen. Tortoises
and snakes, in great variety, crawl over the ground, mostly after the rains. Rats and lizards--there
are but few mice--are very abundant, and feed both in the fields and on the stores of the men.

The wily ostrich, bustard, and florikan affect all open places. The guinea-fowl is the most
numerous of all game-birds. Partridges come next, but do not afford good sport; and quails
are rare. Ducks and snipe appear to love Africa less than any other country; and geese and
storks are only found where water most abounds. Vultures are uncommon; hawks and crows much
abound, as in all other countries; but little birds, of every colour and note, are discoverable
in great quantities near water and by the villages. Huge snails and small ones, as well as
fresh-water shells, are very abundant, though the conchologist would find but little variety
to repay his labours; and insects, though innumerable, are best sought for after the rains
have set in. [3]

The Wanguana or Freed Men

The Wa-n-guana, as their name implies, are men freed from slavery; and as it is to these singular
negroes acting as hired servants that I have been chiefly indebted for opening this large section
of Africa, a few general remarks on their character cannot be out of place here.

Of course, having been born in Africa, and associated in childhood with the untainted negroes,
they retain all the superstitious notions of the true aborigines, though somewhat modified,
and even corrupted, by that acquaintance with the outer world which sharpens their wits.

Most of these men were doubtless caught in wars, as may be seen every day in Africa, made slaves
of, and sold to the Arabs for a few yards of common cloth, brass wire, or beads. They would
then be taken to the Zanzibar market, resold like horses to the highest bidder, and then kept
in bondage by their new masters, more like children of his family than anything else. In this
new position they were circumcised to make Mussulmans of them, that their hands might be "clean"
to slaughter their master's cattle, and extend his creed; for the Arabs believe the day must
come when the tenets of Mohammed will be accepted by all men.

The slave in this new position finds himself much better off than he ever was in his life before,
with this exception, that as a slave he feels himself much degraded in the social scale of
society, and his family ties are all cut off from him--probably his relations have all been
killed in the war in which he was captured. Still, after the first qualms have worn off, we
find him much attached to his master, who feeds him and finds him in clothes in return for
the menial services which he performs. In a few years after capture, or when confidence has
been gained by the attachment shown by the slave, if the master is a trader in ivory, he will
intrust him with the charge of his stores, and send him all over the interior of the continent
to purchase for him both slaves and ivory; but should the master die, according to the Mohammedan
creed the slaves ought to be freed. In Arabia this would be the case; but at Zanzibar it more
generally happens that the slave is willed to his successor.

The whole system of slaveholding by the Arabs in Africa, or rather on the coast or at Zanzibar,
is exceedingly strange; for the slaves, both in individual physical strength and in numbers,
are so superior to the Arab foreigners, that if they chose to rebel, they might send the Arabs
flying out of the land. It happens, however, that they are spell-bound, not knowing their strength
any more than domestic animals, and they even seem to consider that they would be dishonest
if they ran away after being purchased, and so brought pecuniary loss on their owners.

There are many positions into which the slave may get by the course of events, and I shall
give here, as a specimen, the ordinary case of one who has been freed by the death of his master,
that master having been a trader in ivory and slaves in the interior. In such a case, the slave
so freed in all probability would commence life afresh by taking service as a porter with other
merchants, and in the end would raise sufficient capital to commence trading himself--first
in slaves, because they are the most easily got, and then in ivory. All his accumulations would
then go to the Zanzibar market, or else to slavers looking out off the coast. Slavery begets
slavery. To catch slaves is the first thought of every chief in the interior; hence fights
and slavery impoverish the land, and that is the reason both why Africa does not improve, and
why we find men of all tribes and tongues on the coast. The ethnologist need only go to Zanzibar
to become acquainted with all the different tribes to the centre of the continent on that side,
or to Congo to find the other half south of the equator there.

Some few freed slaves take service in vessels, of which they are especially fond; but most
return to Africa to trade in slaves and ivory. All slaves learn the coast language, called
at Zanzibar Kisuahili; and therefore the traveller, if judicious in his selections, could find
there interpreters to carry him throughout the eastern half of South Africa. To the north of
the equator the system of language entirely changes.
