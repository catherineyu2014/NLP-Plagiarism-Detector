The chairman of the committee is Dr. J. H. Dillard, director of the Jeanes and Slater Funds,
a Virginian, and an LL.D. of three Southern universities, including his alma mater, Washington
and Lee. The other members are Dr. Thomas Jesse Jones, specialist of the U. S. Bureau of Education;
Mrs. Percy V. Pennypacker, of the National Federation of Women's Clubs; the Rt. Rev. Theodore
D. Bratton, D.D., of the Diocese of Mississippi; Messrs. Clark Howell of the Atlanta Constitution;
Arthur B. Krock, of the Louisville Courier-Journal; D. P. Toomey, of the Dallas News; C. P.
J. Mooney of the Memphis Commercial-Appeal; E. E. Britton, formerly of the Raleigh Observer,
private secretary to Secretary Daniels; Jackson Davis of Richmond, general field agent of the
General Education Board; Walter Parker, general manager of the New Orleans Association of Commerce;
the Rev. J. W. Lee, D.D., of St. Louis, the well-known Southern Methodist minister, author
and lecturer; Dr. W. S. Currell, president of the South Carolina State University; Dr. Chas.
L. Crow, of the State university of Florida; Dr. W. D. Weatherford, of Nashville, Tenn., secretary
of the International Y. M. C. A.; and Mrs. John D. Hammond of Georgia, who will act as secretary
for the committee.

The Committee will undertake publicity work in behalf of the best aspects of our inter-racial
relations in no spirit of boastfulness or of self-satisfaction as Southerners. They are aware
of the shadows, the back eddies, the sinister influences in the lives of both races. But they
believe the good outweighs the evil, and deserves at least as wide a hearing; and that to give
publicity to successful constructive work done by their own people will encourage others to
similar efforts, and will further the interests of both races. They ask a hearing from the
Southern public for these aspects of Southern life.

SLAVERY IN KENTUCKY

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

This study is an attempt to give a connected and concise account of the institution of slavery
as it existed in the State of Kentucky from 1792 to 1865. Much has been written of slavery
in other States, but there has not been published a single account which deals adequately with
the institution in Kentucky. A scholarly treatise on The Anti-Slavery Movement in Kentucky,
by Professor Asa E. Martin, of Pennsylvania State College, has appeared but, as this work is
limited to a discussion of the history of the movement to overthrow slavery, our study parallels
and supplements it.

In this study the chief emphasis has been placed upon the legal, economic and social history
of slavery in Kentucky, mention being made of a few of the interesting anti-slavery incidents
when these are known to have influenced the local status of the slave. We have first considered
the inception of the system as based fundamentally upon the type of land settlement and tenure,
followed by a study of the growth of the slave population, which brings in the question of
the local economic value of the slave. An attempt has been made to explain the internal slave
trade; and to consider to what extent Kentucky served as a breeding State for slaves destined
to the market in the lower South.

In the chapter on the legal status of slavery special emphasis has been placed not only upon
the legal position of the institution but upon the general evolution of the rights of the Negro
in servitude. This section is vitally connected with the anti-slavery movement after about
the year 1835. The problem of the fugitive slave and the general rights of emancipation and
of the freed Negro have been approached purely from the legal standpoint.

The chapter on the social status of the slave considers the conditions of slave life that were
more or less peculiar to Kentucky. There has often been made the statement, that in Kentucky
Negro servitude was generally on a higher plane than in the States to the south and the treatment
of slaves was much more humane. Some light has been thrown on these questions.

As a supplement to the discussion of the legal and social status a general summary of public
opinion regarding emancipation and colonization has been added. Although for the most part
consisting of previously published material this section has been treated from the viewpoint
of the existing institution and not from the anti-slavery side which occasioned most of the
original publication.

This study has been made from a consideration of the contemporary evidence as found in newspapers,
statements of slaves, and general evidence of travelers and citizens of Kentucky during the
period before the Civil War. The material for the study of this field is not only scattered
throughout the country but for the most part it is very meager compared with the records of
States like Virginia and Missouri. All the documents, papers, manuscripts and works known to
be of value, however, have been consulted. The most valuable records for this treatise are
to be found in the Durrett Collection at the University of Chicago, the extensive files of
early Kentucky papers in the Library of the American Antiquarian Society, and the documents
in the Kentucky State Library at Frankfort.

To Mr. Clarence S. Brigham, of the American Antiquarian Society, Mr. Edward A. Henry, of the
University of Chicago Library, and Mr. Frank Kavanaugh, of the Kentucky State Library, I am
indebted for invaluable assistance rendered in securing material for this work. The treatment
of the legal status of slavery would have been very meager, were it not for the valuable aid
given by Dr. George E. Wire, of the Worcester County (Massachusetts) Law Library. To Miss Florence
Dillard, of the Lexington (Kentucky) Public Library, I am indebted for assistance given throughout
the period of my studies. To Prof. George H. Blakeslee, of Clark University, I owe more than
to any one else--for his inspiration during my three years of study, for his most valuable
aid in the correction of the manuscript, his candid judgment and judicial reasoning and the
many suggestions which have helped to make this study what it is.

CHAPTER II

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SLAVERY

It is impossible to understand slavery in Kentucky without some knowledge of the method by
which the land was settled in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Between 1782 and 1802
the seven States which had interest in western lands ceded their rights to the United States
and all that territory with the exception of Kentucky and the Connecticut Reserve in Ohio was
made a part of the public domain. Hence, one of the distinguishing features of the settlement
of Kentucky as compared with Ohio was that in the latter State the land was sold by the Federal
Government to settlers coming from all parts of the country but particularly from the northeastern
section. The result of this was that few citizens of Ohio held more than 640 acres.

Kentucky had been reserved by Virginia and consequently the method of settlement was purely
a matter governed by that State and was separate and apart from the system which was employed
by the United States Government. Furthermore, Kentucky lands were all given out by 1790, just
one year after the beginning of our national period. The federal land policy was at that time
just beginning. Virginia gave out the lands in Kentucky by what is known as the patent system,
and all the settlers in Kentucky held their lands by one of three different kinds of rights.

In the first place there were those who were given tracts in the new territory as a reward
for military services which had been rendered in the Revolution. This had been provided for
by the legislature of Virginia as early as December, 1778.[234] No land north of the Ohio River
was to be granted out as a military bounty until all the "good lands" in the Kentucky region
had been exhausted. The size of these tracts was to be governed by the official status of the
recipient in the late war, and the bounties finally granted by Virginia ranged all the way
from one hundred to fifteen thousand acres.[235]

The Virginia legislature of 1779 found it necessary to establish a second method of settlement
in Kentucky in response to the demands of the large number of people who were migrating to
the west of the Alleghenies. Provision was made for the granting of preemption rights to new
settlers and also for the introduction of a very generous system of settlement rights. These
settlement and preemption rights were almost inseparable, as the latter was dependent upon
the former. It was provided that four hundred acres of land would be given to every person
or family who had settled in the region before the first of January, 1778.[236] The word "settlement"
was stated to mean either a residence of one year in the territory or the raising of a crop
of corn. In addition to the above grant every man who had built only a cabin or made any improvement
on the land was entitled to a preemption of one thousand acres, providing such improvements
had been made prior to January 1, 1778. Preference in the grants was to be given to the early
settlers and even the most famous heroes of the Revolution were not allowed to interfere with
the rights of those who held a certificate of settlement.

Thus far provision had been made only for those who had settled before 1778. To them was given
the best of the land. Thereafter all settlement and preemption rights ceased and the further
distribution of land in Kentucky was by means of treasury warrants. A person desiring land
in Kentucky would appear at one of the Virginia land offices and make an entry and pay a fee
amounting to about two cents per acre. The paper he would receive would give the approximate
location of the tract and the recipient would proceed to have the land surveyed at his pleasure.
Within three months after the survey had been made he was to appear at the land office and
have the same recorded. A copy of this record was to be taken to the assistant register of
the land office in Kentucky and there it was to remain six months in order to give prior settlers,
if any, the right to prove their claims to the property. No such evidence being produced a
final record of the patent was to be made and a copy given to the original grantee.[237]

An interesting example of this method of settlement is shown by the experience of Abraham Lincoln,
the grandfather of President Lincoln. On March 4, 1780, soon after the establishment of the
new system, he appeared at the land office in Richmond, Virginia, and was given three treasury
warrants, each for four hundred acres of land in Kentucky. The first and third of these warrants
were not returned for the final recording until May 16, 1787, at which time Beverly Randolph,
Governor of Virginia, issued a final deed of 800 acres of land in Lincoln County, Kentucky,
to Abraham Lincoln.[238] The second treasury warrant was not returned until July 2, 1798, more
than a decade after the death of Abraham Lincoln and six years after Kentucky had become a
State. At that time the warrant was presented with a record of the survey by Mordecai Lincoln,
the eldest son of Abraham. After some period of investigation the deed for the four hundred
acres in Jefferson County was turned over to Mordecai Lincoln on April 26, 1799.[239]

The result of this method of granting land was that Kentucky was settled by a comparatively
few men who rented their property to tenants. A large number of the military bounties were
never settled by the original owners but were farmed by the later incoming tenant class. George
Washington had been given five thousand acres and this land was actually settled by the poorer
white element. In the case of the land warrant property it was true that it was usually granted
to the poorer class of early settlers but as in the instance of the Lincoln family the land
soon passed into the hands of the wealthier settlers either by purchase or through law suits.
It is commonly stated that Daniel Boone thus became landless and was forced to migrate to Missouri.[240]

Thus we see that Kentucky was distinctly different from all the other settlements to the west
of the Alleghenies in the original system of land tenure and she further inherited from her
mother State of Virginia the ancient theory of a landed aristocracy which was based upon tenantry.
The early inhabitants of Kentucky can be easily divided into three classes, the landed proprietors,
their slaves, and the tenant class of whites. The second and third classes tended to keep alive
the status of the former and led to the perpetuation of the landed aristocracy. In Kentucky,
however, the laws of descent were always against primogeniture and this resulted in the division
of the lands of the wealthier class with each new generation.

The institution of slavery in Kentucky, as in every other State, depended for the most part
upon the existence of large plantations. The only reason Kentucky had such large estates was
because of the method by which the land was given out by the mother State. Economically Kentucky
was not adapted to plantation life. The greater part of the State required then, as it still
does, the personal care and supervision of the owner or tenant. The original distribution of
land made this impossible and there grew up a large class of landholders who seldom labored
with their hands, because of the traditional system. A large number of inhabitants as early
as 1805, Michaux found, were cultivating their lands themselves, but those who could do so
had all the work done by Negro slaves.[241]

With passing years, while Kentucky maintained slavery, it came to have a social system not
like that in the South but one more like the typical structure of the middle nineteenth century
West. There were several reasons for this. In the first place, the absence of the policy of
primogeniture in time came to distribute the lands over a much larger population. In the second
place, while all the land in Kentucky had been granted by the year 1790, the patrician land-holding
element was completely submerged by the flood of so-called plebeians who came in soon after
Kentucky became a State. In 1790 there were only 61,133 white people in Kentucky, and although
all the land had been granted, the white population in the next decade nearly tripled, reaching
179,871 in 1800, and this increase, at a slightly smaller rate, continued down to about 1820.
Still further the nature of the soil made it more profitable for the wealthier landed class
to let out their holdings to the incoming whites who did their own work and in time came to
own the property. "Each year increased this element of the state at the expense of the larger
properties."[242]

A study of the growth of the slave and white population of Kentucky from 1790 to 1860 is necessary
to an adequate understanding of the slave problem. It will be found advantageous to deal with
two sets of figures--one relating to the slave population within the State and the other with
the slave increase in Kentucky as compared with the general increase throughout the United
States. It would not be of any value to compare the figures for Kentucky with those of any
other State, for that would involve the discussion of local factors which are beyond the scope
of this investigation.

First of all we shall take the census statistics for the State for all eight of the enumerations
which were taken during the slavery era. The figures for the year 1790 were originally taken
when Kentucky was a part of the State of Virginia, but they are included, since Kentucky became
a State before the census was published. Furthermore they furnish an interesting light upon
the growth of the slave population during the first decade of the new commonwealth. The important
part of this table is in the increases, on a percentage basis, in the slave and white populations.
Another viewpoint of the growth of the slave population may be seen in this little table:

  RATIO OF SLAVES TO THE TOTAL POPULATION

        Per Cent
  1790    16.1
  1800    18.2
  1810    19.18
  1820    22.4
  1830    24.0
  1840    23.3
  1850    21.4
  1860    19.5

Here it will be seen that the proportion of slaves increased down to 1830 and then began to
decline. Most authorities are agreed that this was in a large measure due to the enactment
of the law of 1833 forbidding the importation of slaves into Kentucky. But before dealing with
that question it would be well to have before us the figures for the whole country at the same
period.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

The facts seem more significant, if we compare the slave increase in Kentucky with that of
the Negroes in the country as a whole. Bearing in mind that Kentucky was a comparatively new
region when it became a State and that at that time slavery was firmly established along the
seaboard, we are not surprised to find that the slave increase in Kentucky was much more rapid
for the first three or four decades than it was in the nation as a whole. After the year 1830
the increase in the United States, on a percentage basis, was much greater than in Kentucky.
It seems that the institution started in with a boom and then eventually died down in Kentucky.

There were several reasons for this fact. A glance at the increase of whites in Kentucky for
the last three decades will show that they were forging ahead while the slaves were relatively
declining. This was due to a large amount of immigration of that class of white people who
were not slaveholding. A second factor was the non-importation act of 1833. About the same
time there came to be a conviction among a large portion of the population that slavery in
Kentucky was economically unprofitable. There is abundant ground for the position that the
law of 1833 was passed because of a firm conviction that there were enough slaves in the State.
The only ones who could profit by any amount of importation were the slave dealers and beyond
a certain point even their trade would prove unprofitable. If there was ever a single slaveholder
who defended importation on the ground that more slaves were needed in Kentucky he never spoke
out in public and gave his reasons for such a position.

Unfortunately there are few statistics concerning the number of slaveholders in Kentucky. Cassius
M. Clay in his appeal to the people in 1845 stated that there were 31,495 owners of slaves
in the State.[245] The same year the auditor's tax books showed that there were 176,107 slaves
in Kentucky.[246] This would mean an average of 5.5 slaves for each owner. The accuracy of
these figures is substantiated by those for the census of 1850 which gave 210,981 slaves held
by 38,456 slaveholders or an average of 5.4 to each owner. These holders were classified according
to the number of slaves held as follows:

  Holders of 1 slave                            9,244
  Holders of over 1 and less than 5 slaves     13,284
  Holders of 5 and under 10 slaves              9,579
  Holders of 10 and under 20 slaves             5,022
  Holders of 20 and under 50 slaves             1,198
  Holders of 50 and under 100 slaves               53
  Holders of 100 and under 200 slaves               5
                                               38,385[247]

This distribution shows that, although the average number of slaves held may have been 5.4
for each slaveholder, 21,528 or 50 per cent of them held less than five slaves each, and that
34,129 or 88 per cent held less than 20 each. Of the 132,920 free families in the State only
28 per cent held any slaves at all. This was somewhat below the average for the whole South.
The total number of families holding slaves in the United States, by the census of 1850, was
347,525. With an average of 5.7 persons to each family there were about 2,000,000 persons in
the relation of slave owners, or about one third of the whole white population of the slave
States. In South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana about one half of the white
population was thus classified. As stated above, this percentage in Kentucky was only twenty-eight.

This comparison can be more clearly shown by a table of the slave States from the census of
1850 showing the number of white people, the slaveholders, slaves, and the average number of
slaves for each slaveholder.

Among the fourteen real slaveholding States of the Union Kentucky stood ninth in the number
of slaves in 1850, but was third in the number of slave owners and with the exception of Missouri
had less slaves for each owner than any other State. From the third column of this table, however,
we are rather surprised to find that not only in Missouri but in Arkansas, Maryland and Tennessee
the number of slaveholders was smaller in proportion to the total white population than in
Kentucky.

Helper in his Impending Crisis made the following interesting table from the census figures
for 1850. He set a perfectly arbitrary valuation of $400 on each slave, but, if one takes into
account the infants and the aged unable to work, his general appraisement of the slave group
is fair enough for the time and for a basis of comparison. It will be seen at a glance that
after taking out the value of the slaves in all the States Kentucky was the richest southern
commonwealth.

From the three preceding tables it is apparent that while the Kentucky slaveholders represented
about 28 per cent of the white population of the State, on the average they held less slaves
than in the other Southern States. Slave property in Kentucky was a much smaller part of the
wealth of the commonwealth than in the States to the south. The relatively large number of
holders is to be explained by the type of slavery which existed in the State. Many persons
held a few servants in bondage and those who held many slaves were very few in number.

The question of the sale of slaves from Kentucky into the southern market presents a much more
formidable problem. The chief charge that the anti-slavery people made against Kentucky was
that the State regularly bred and reared slaves for the market in the lower South. What was
the attitude of the Kentucky slaveholder and the people in general on the question of the domestic
slave trade? There is no doubt that in the later years of slavery there were sold in the State
many slaves who ultimately found their way into the southern market notwithstanding the contempt
of the average Kentucky slaveholder for the slave trade. This trend of opinion will be seen
as we proceed. If the sentiment was decidedly against such human commerce how did so many slaves
become victims of the slave trader?

There were five general causes which led to the sale of slaves in Kentucky: (1) When they became
so unruly that the master was forced to sell; (2) when their sale was necessary to settle an
estate; (3) when the master was reduced to the need of the money value in preference to the
labor; (4) when captured runaways were unclaimed after one year; and (5) when the profit alone
was desired by unscrupulous masters. Many other reasons have been given, but a careful investigation
of all available material confines practically every known case of sale to one of the above
classifications. Mrs. Stowe in her Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin[249] maintained that the prevalence
of the slave trade in Kentucky was due to the impoverishment of the soil beyond recovery and
the decrease in the economic value of the slave to its owner. This argument is fallacious,
for the very blue-grass region which held most of the slaves is today the most fertile section
of the State.

As long as a slave conducted himself in accordance with the spirit of the slave code there
was little chance of his owner selling him against his will. The president of the Constitutional
Convention of 1849 stated that in the interior of the State, where slaves were the most numerous,
very few Negroes were sold out of the State and that they were mostly those whose bad and ungovernable
disposition was such that their owners could no longer control them[250]. A true picture of
the average master's attitude has been given us by Prof. N. S. Shaler. "What negroes there
were," said he, "belonged to a good class. The greater number of them were from families which
had been owned by the ancestors of their masters in Virginia. In my grandfather's household
and those of his children there were some two dozen of these blacks. They were well cared for;
none of them were ever sold, though there was the common threat that 'if you don't behave,
you will be sold South.' One of the commonest bits of instruction my grandfather gave me was
to remember that my people had in a century never bought or sold a slave except to keep families
together. By that he meant that a gentleman of his station should not run any risk of appearing
as a 'negro trader,' the last word of opprobrium to be slung at a man. So far as I can remember,
this rule was well kept and social ostracism was likely to be visited on any one who was fairly
suspected of buying or selling slaves for profit. This state of opinion was, I believe, very
general among the better class of slave owners in Kentucky. When negroes were sold it was because
they were vicious and intractable. Yet there were exceptions to this high-minded humor."[251]

When a master had a bad Negro about the only thing that could be done for the sake of discipline
was to sell him. If the owner kept the slave, the latter would corrupt his fellows and if he
were set free, the master would reward where he ought to punish. The human interest which the
owner took in his servant when the demands of the institution necessitated his sale is shown
in the case of the Negro Frank, owned by A. Barnett, of Greensburg. Witness these words of
the master in a runaway advertisement: "His transgressions impelled me, some years since to
take him to New Orleans and sell him, where he became the property of a Spaniard, who branded
him on each cheek thus, (B), which is plain to be seen when said negro is newly shaved. I went
to New Orleans again last May, where, having my feelings excited by the tale Frank told me,
I purchased him again."[252] After the master had gone to all this trouble in the interest
of the slave the latter ran away shortly after his return to Kentucky.

It was often necessary to sell slaves in order to settle an estate. It was seldom possible
for a man to will his property in Negroes without some divisions becoming necessary at the
hands of the executor in the just interest of the heirs. These public auctions usually took
place on court day, at the courthouse door and were conducted by the master commissioner of
the circuit court. The following advertisement reveals the necessity and the procedure:

     SALE OF NEGROES

     By virtue of a decree of the Fayette Circuit, the undersigned
     will, as Commissioner to carry into effect said decree, sell to
     the highest bidder, on the public square in the city of
     Lexington, on Monday the 10th of March next, being county court
     day, the following slaves, to wit:

     Keiser, Carr, Sally, Bob, Susan, Sam, Sarah and Ben; belonging to
     the estate of Alexander Culbertson, deceased. The sale to be on a
     credit of three months, the purchaser to give bond with approved
     security. The sale to take place between the hours of 11 o'clock
     in the morning and 3 o'clock in the evening.

     February 26, 1834         JOHN CLARK, Commissioner[253]

On the same day the sheriff of the county might appear at the courthouse door in accordance
with a previous announcement and auction off any unclaimed runaway that had been lodged in
the county jail or hired out under his authority for a period of a year or more. The slaves
thus sold were usually fugitives from the lower South who had been apprehended on their way
to Ohio or Indiana. Although the utmost publicity would have been given to their capture, in
accordance with the law, few of the planters of the far South seem ever to have claimed their
property. The usual legal code in this matter is shown by the notice below:

     NOTICE: Agreeably to an act of the General Assembly, passed
     January 11, 1845, I will, on the first Monday of May, 1846,
     before the Court House door, in the city of Louisville, sell to
     the highest bidder, on a credit of six months, the purchaser
     giving bond with good security, having the force and effect of a
     replevin bond, JOHN, a runaway slave, 18 or 19 years of age, 5
     feet 3 or 4 inches high, a rather heavy built, supposed to be the
     property of Daniel McCaleb or Calip, residing on the coast some
     twenty miles below New Orleans.

                         F. S. J. RONALD Deputy Sheriff
                  for JAMES HARRISON Sheriff Jefferson Co.[254]
     Feb. 25, 1846.

Under the three causes of sale thus far cited the blame would not be placed upon the master.
In the case of the unruly Negro the owner was according to the ethics of that day not at fault.
In the settlement of an estate the slaveholder was no longer a factor, for his demise alone
had brought the sale. In the case of the runaway the owner was unknown. Mrs. Stowe probably
showed the attitude of the average Kentucky master when she pictured Uncle Tom as being sold
for the southern market only because of the economic necessities of the owner. When in such
a position the master felt called upon to explain the necessities of the case. He was very
careful not to be cast under the suspicion of public opinion as a "slave trader," which, as
Shaler has said, was the "last word of opprobrium." Witness a few instances in evidence:

     NEGROES FOR SALE

     A yellow negro woman of fine constitution, and two children, from
     the country, and sold for no fault but to raise money. Will not
     be sold to go down the river. Her husband, a fine man, can be had
     also. Apply at the store of

                              JARVIS AND TRABUE--3rd & Main[255]

The editor of the Lexington Reporter was very careful not to get under the ban of his constituents
when he was forced to sell a farm hand and his wife.

     FOR SALE

     A negro man, a first rate farm hand, about 27 years of age; and a
     very likely woman, the wife of the man, about 22 years of age, a
     good house servant. They will not be sold separately, or to any
     person wishing to take them out of the State. Enquire at this
     office.[256]

In 1834 Thomas J. Allen, a citizen of Louisville, desired to exchange his property in the city
for 40 or 50 slaves, but he specifically stated that they were to be for his own use and that
he wanted them to be "in families."[257] The same attitude appears in the case of a house servant
for sale with the reasons for such specifically stated:

     FOR SALE

     I wish to sell a negro woman, who has been accustomed to house
     work. She is an excellent cook, washes and scours, and is in
     every respect, an active and intelligent servant. I do not
     require her services, which is my only reason for wishing to
     dispose of her.

                                   MASLIN SMITH[258]

The prevalence of statements giving the reasons for and the restrictions upon these sales should
show beyond any reasonable doubt that public opinion would not tolerate any suspicion of a
heartless traffic in slaves. These sentiments were especially prevalent in the central portion
of the State. The only case known to the writer where a large number of slaves were sold without
any qualification was near Harrodsburg in August, 1845; but in this instance all the man's
property, including 450 acres of land, was sold at the same time.[259]

There were, naturally, some unscrupulous masters who cared little for the fate of their slaves
when sold. They placed no restrictions upon the sale, either in destination or in the break-up
of family ties. We will cite only two, one for the earlier and one for the later period, noticeable
chiefly for the lack of regard for Negro family life.

     NEGROES FOR SALE

     The subscriber has for sale a negro man and woman, each about 24
     years of age, both are excellent plantation hands, together with
     two children. They will be sold separately or altogether.

                                   LUIDORES LUCAS[260]

     FOR SALE

     I wish to sell a negro woman and four children. The woman is 22
     years old, of good character, a good cook and washer. The
     children are very likely, from 6 years down to 1-1/2. I will sell
     them together or separately to suit purchasers.
