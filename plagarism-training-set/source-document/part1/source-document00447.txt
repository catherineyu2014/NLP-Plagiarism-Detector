"But Fatima said, 'To the keyhole let's creep, "There can be no harm just in one little peep!
"We are women--besides, there are none to behold us! "If he wished us to leave it, he shouldn't
have told us!'"

It is these inexcusable lines which have caused the Feminist party to boycott (and perhaps
rightly) any opera-house in which this drama is given, urging that they contain an insult which
can be wiped out only with blood or ballots. I sympathize with this feeling, yet, as I said
before, there are extenuating circumstances. Wagner was born a hundred years ago. In his time
the hand of woman, though white, was flabby and inert from years of darning, patching, stirring
the pot, buttoning and unbuttoning, feeding and spanking man's perennial progeny. He had no
conception how that frail hand would be steadied and strengthened by dropping the ballot into
the box; how curiosity, vanity, parasitic coquetry, lack of logic, overweening interest in
millinery and inability to balance a check-book--how these weaknesses would vanish under the
inspiring influences of municipal politics; therefore I feel disposed to forgive him, and to
attribute to him, not absolute and deliberate insult, so much as a kind of patronizing persiflage.
In this case, however, feminists will say that the great Wagner undoubtedly and regrettably
overreached himself.

Here is just a hint of the theme; a paltry, parasitic, mid-Victorian motive.

CURIOSITY ARIA

Curiosity conquer'd, the Key was applied, And with  thunder most awful the door opened wide.

Now comes the much discussed "Chorus of Headless Wives," which is a distinct prophecy of Debussy.
You have noted in late musical criticisms allusions to the "ghosts of themes" used in "Pelleas
and Melisande,"-- "Sound-wraiths wandering in air." Here we have the same thing and employed
with exquisite appropriateness. The ladies hanging in the secret chamber are mere bodies, their
heads being decidedly off stage. When the door is opened the wives begin to sing ala' Debussy,
the ghostly effect being secured by the fact that it is not, of course, the presentbodies,
but the absentheads that are supposed to be singing. The melodic wraiths float from the key
of G flat--I use "key" in the old-fashioned sense, for the word, like the thing itself, is
fast disappearing--through one and four sharps back to two and three flats, employing all signatures
but that of C major. Six sets of severed vocal organs meandering in space would hardly use
the natural key!

Then we have the opening of the mysterious door; the unexpected return of Bluebeard; the hysterics
of the ill-fated sisters, with plenty of shrieking and swooning motives; and then the celebrated
"Hammelfleisch" or "Mutton" motive, where Sister Anne, from her post in the high tower, observes
for a long time nothing but sheep.

"But, alas! Sister Anne, only saw a few sheep, then, nothing!"

Now  there is the thrilling and opportune arrival of the Brothers on their  high horses; the
mortal combat; the death of the villain by the "SchwertMotiv"; the joyous funeral march; and
then the superb duet between Mustapha, the eldest brother, and Fatima, the ill-fated heroine.
We get astonishing color contrasts in the last scene, as each character is allotted a different
set of instruments as accompaniment. Bluebeard has six sackbuts, a trumpet, a viold'amore,
and a Chinese temple gong; Fatima, three lutes, an arch-lute, and a pianola; Mustapha a bass-drum
and a harpsichord; and Sister Anne a pair of virginals. (An exquisite touch, this!) To Bluebeard's
servants are allotted barrel-organs, accordions, jews'-harps, mandolins, bagpipes, and triangles.
All this gives a tonal splendor that simply beggars description.

When the combat is over and Bluebeard's immense body is prone and lifeless in the dust, Wagner
suddenly leaves tragedy and gives us a melodious duet between the brother and sister on the
theme: "What can equal a brother's love?" This duet and finale unite to form a masterpiece;
a deserved rebuke to any cynic who may consider that Wagner could not adopt the enervating
methods of the Italian school if he desired. His cadenzas here are miracles of compressed technique,
and, although the melody is conventional, the music itself is never for a moment simple or
intelligible.

Fatima, singing actress (whose part here is written almost entirely in appoggiaturas), and
Mustapha, baritone, hold the stage; the one who draws the largest salary occupying the center
and the other standing wherever he can find room. Mustapha, taking care to descend as low in
his scale as Fatima ascends high in hers, and vying with her in exceeding the speed-limit,
sings "Oh ra-ha-ha-hap-ture !" several times, varied by "What can e-he-he-he-qual a brother's
love?" Then, using the same words, they sing as much as possible in unison to the end of the
scene, which closes with a fantasy of capricious arabesques and a series of trills on notes
seldom heard from any but the high-est-priced human lips.

Ah! What joy!.....What rap---ture! What can e---qual a brother's love? Oh joy!........Oh joy!.........Oh,
joy!........ (Cadenza according to the skill of the performer.)

Whether Wagner followed the Italian school in this case in sarcasm, or because he believed
it was fitting, considering the subject, can never be known (though we remember that he was
at one time a great admirer of Bellini); but the result is a melodious and restful ending to
a tragedy which, were it carried to the end in unbroken gloom, mystery, and carnage, would
be too terrible and too vast for human endurance and human comprehension. Yet let us be just!
The libretto is full of barbaric brutalities; it is replete with blood and carnage; but, although
Bluebeard was emphatically not a nice person, and his vices cannot be condoned, and although
Fatima was wrong in marrying for an establishment and most culpable in yielding to her curiosity,
still, virtue triumphs in the end. The story, as a whole, is fairly murmurous with morality,
sending young men and women to their homes impressed with the risks and snares involved in
bigamy and polygamy, and giving them an added sense of the security and gravity of the marriage
tie when sparingly used.
