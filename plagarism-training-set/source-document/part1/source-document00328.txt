The ordering of the George Washington to return to France looked upon here as an act of impatience
and petulance on the President's part and not accepted here in good grace by either friends
or foes. It is considered as an evidence that the President intends to leave the Conference
if his views are not accepted. I think this method of withdrawal most unwise and fraught with
the most dangerous possibilities here and abroad, because it puts upon the President the responsibility
of withdrawing when the President should by his own act place the responsibility for a break
of the Conference where it properly belongs. The President should not put himself in the position
of being the first to withdraw if his 14 points are not accepted. Either he should put himself
in the position of being the one who remained at the Conference until the very last, demanding
the acceptance of his 14 principles. Nothing should be said about his leaving France, but he
ought when the time and occasion arrive to re-state his views in terms of the deepest solemnity
and yet without any ultimatum attached and then await a response from his associates. In other
words, let him by his acts and words place his associates in the position of those who refuse
to continue the Conference because of their unwillingness to live up to the terms of the Armistice.
Then the President can return to this country and justify his withdrawal. He cannot justify
his withdrawal any other way. Up to this time the world has been living on stories coming out
of Paris that there was to be an agreement on the League of Nations. Suddenly out of a clear
sky comes an order for the George Washington and unofficial statements of the President's withdrawal.
A withdrawal at this time would be a desertion.

PRESIDENT WILSON,
  Paris.

A great number of your friends here fear that the interposition of United States in matter
of indemnity and reparation which is a paramount question with European nations and only of
indirect interest to us will solidify the opposition of England, France, Italy, and Belgium
to a league of nations. Our friends believe that any necessary sacrifices to assure a league
of nations should be made. Your supporters would be happy if you could throw upon the other
nations the burden of exacting indemnities and at the same time win their support to a league
of nations.

every attention. I confer with Grasty every day. The President is working too hard following
his recent illness. To know that things are going on and not properly handled, and yet be responsible
for them, causes him more worry and anxiety and does more harm than actual participation. This

Beg to call your attention to following editorial from Springfield Republican. Quote The critical
period in the peacemaking has been reached when progress can win over reaction the very least
of victories only by a resolute stand of the most commanding figure in Paris. France and England
cannot desert the President without branding themselves as hypocrites and ingrates. Worse things
could happen than for the President to come home without a peace treaty, leaving Europe to
wallow in the mire of national rivalries and hates to which reaction would sentence it for
all time. There is no compelling reason why America should sign a treaty that would merely
perpetuate ancient feuds and make new wars a certainty. Our chief interest in the Conference
at Paris, as the President declared at Manchester, is the peace of the world. Unless that can
be made reasonably sure, with Europe's sincere cooperation, the time is near when 'pack up

I think our friends in the Senate ought to be furnished very frankly with the following reason,
which seems to me quite convincing, for not at present publishing the complete treaty: namely,
that if our discussion of the treaty with the Germans is to be more than a sham and a form
it is necessary to consider at least some of the details of the treaty as subject to reconsideration
and that, therefore, it would be a tactical blunder to publish the details as first drafted,
notwithstanding the fact that there is no likelihood that they will be departed from in any
substantial way.

Every Republican member of new Foreign Relations Committee openly opposed to treaty, a majority
in favour of its amendment. Every Democratic member of Committee, including Thomas, for treaty
and against separation. There is a decided reaction evident against the League, caused, in
my opinion, by dissatisfaction of Irish, Jews, Poles, Italians, and Germans. Republicans taking
full advantage and liable, in order to garner disaffected vote, to make absolute issue against
League, Reaction intensified by your absence and lack of publicity from your end and confusion
caused by contradictory statements and explanations of Quote so-called compromises End Quote.
Simonds' article appearing in certain American newspapers Sunday, admirable, explaining reasons
for Saar Valley and French pact and other controversial matters.

There is a tremendous drive against League, resembling German propaganda, backed by Irish and
Jews. Irish openly opposing; Jews attacking along collateral lines. Could not Lansing or perhaps
White, because he is a Republican, or yourself inspire publicity or give interview explaining--
officially or unofficially--the following matters:

  First--America's attitude toward publication of terms of Treaty, along
           lines of your last cable to me.

  Second--That the fourteen points have not been disregarded.

  Third--The underlying reason for French pact emphasizing the point as
           Simonds' says Quote That French pact is merely an
           underwriting of the League of Nations during the period
           necessary for that organization not merely to get to work, but
           to become established and recognized by all nations
           End quote.

I am not at all disturbed by this reaction--it was inevitable. The consummation of your work
in the signing of the Treaty will clear the air of all these distempers. Your arrival in America,
your address to the Congress and some speeches to the country will make those who oppose the
League to-day feel ashamed of themselves. The New York World had a very good editorial favouring

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

The fight against the League in Knox resolution faces utter collapse. Root and Hayes here advising
Republican leaders. I learned that Root is advising Republicans to vote for the League with
reservations. He is advising Republicans to concentrate their forces upon a resolution of ratification,
which would contain specific reservations on the Monroe Doctrine, immigration, tariff, and
other purely American questions. I believe that this is the course the Republicans will finally
adopt. A confidant of Mr. Taft's yesterday wanted to know from me what your attitude was in
this matter, saying that Mr. Taft might favour this reservation plan. I told him I had no knowledge
on the subject. It is a thing that you might consider. To me it looks like cowardice.

The American Federation of Labour adopted a resolution favouring the League of Nations by a
vote of twenty-nine thousand seven hundred fifty against four hundred twenty. Andrew Furuseth
led the fight against it. The resolution supporting the League contained a reservation in favour
of home rule for Ireland.

TUMULTY,

changes in the Treaty seem to me to belong to the powers of negotiation
which belong to the President and that I would be at liberty to withdraw
the Treaty if I did not approve of the ratifications. I do not think it

sail on the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth and suggest that you consider

President's sailing from Brest most auspicious. Most beautiful weather and promise of more
of same. President and Mrs. Wilson showed no ill effects from strenuous activities of past
few days and while both formed sincere attachment for France, they are glad to turn faces homeward.
Contrary to some reports current in America he is in excellent health. While element of novelty
which entered his reception on arrival last December disappeared, there was deeper feeling
manifested toward him last night in Paris than ever before. Thousands of Quote Vive Wilson
End Quote came from French heart and continuous ovation. Paris showed popular recognition of
leadership of American in securing peace. One very old Frenchman sprang in front of President's
carriage in Champs Elysees and shouted in English: Quote Mr. Wilson, thank you for peace End
Quote. That was the keynote and same sentiment was echoed in thousands of ways. Although owing
to different American viewpoints, Wilson has been frequently antagonistic during this month,
at end relations with other governments' heads most cordial. Lloyd George came over to Place
des Etats-Unis last night and told President Quote You've done more to bring English-speaking
people together than ever before done by any man End Quote. Clemenceau looked as if losing

Former President Taft asks if he may cable to you direct, for your consideration only, some

minds of conscientious Americans, who are anxious for a league of nations, whose fears have
been roused by suggested constructions of the League which its language does not justify and
whose fears could be removed without any considerable change of language.

PRESIDENT WILSON,
  Paris.

Following from Wm. H. Taft:

Quote If you bring back the Treaty with the League of Nations in it, make more specific reservations
of the Monroe Doctrine, fix a term for the duration of the League and the limit of armament,
require expressly unanimity of action in Executive Council and Body of Delegates, and add to
Article XV a provision that where the Executive Council of the Body of Delegates finds the
difference to grow out of an exclusively domestic policy, it shall recommend no settlement,
the ground will be completely cut from under the opponents of the League in the Senate. Addition
to Article XV will answer objection as to Japanese immigration as well as tariffs under Article
XXI. Reservation of the Monroe Doctrine might be as follows:

    Any American state or states may protect the integrity of American
    territory and the independence of the government whose territory it
    is, whether a member of the League or not, and may, in the interests
    of American peace, object to and prevent the further transfer of
    American territory or sovereignty to any European or non-American
    power.

Monroe Doctrine reservation alone would probably carry the treaty but others would make it
certain. (signed) Wm.

PRESIDENT WILSON,
  Paris.

The following letter from Hon. Wm. H. Taft. Quote I have thought perhaps it might help more
if I was somewhat more specific than I was in the memorandum note I sent you yesterday, and
I therefore enclose another memorandum End Quote.

    Duration of the Covenant

    Add to the Preamble the following:

    Quote From the obligations of which any member of the League may
    withdraw after July 1, 1829, by two years' notice in writing, duly
    filed with the Secretary General of the League End Quote.

    Explanation

    I have no doubt that the construction put upon the agreement would be
    what I understand the President has already said it should be, namely
    that any nation may withdraw from it upon reasonable notice, which
    perhaps would be a year. I think, however, it might strengthen the
    Covenant if there was a fixed duration. It would completely remove the
    objection that it is perpetual in its operation.

    Duration of Armament Limit

    Add to the first paragraph of Article VIII, the following:

    Quote At the end of every five years, such limits of armament for
    the several governments shall be reexamined by the Executive Council,
    and agreed upon by them as in the first instance End Quote.

    Explanation

    The duration of the obligation to limit armament, which now may only
    be changed by consent of the Executive Council, has come in for
    criticism. I should think this might thus be avoided, without in any
    way injuring the Covenant. Perhaps three years is enough, but I should
    think five years would be better.

    Unanimous Action by the Executive Council or Body of Delegates

    Insert in Article IV, after the first paragraph, the following:

    Quote Other action taken or recommendations made by the Executive
    Council or the Body of Delegates shall be by the unanimous action of
    the countries represented by the members or delegates, unless
    otherwise specifically stated End Quote.

    Explanation

    Great objection is made to the power of the Executive Council by a
    majority of the members and the Body of Delegates to do the things
    which they are authorized to do in the Covenant. In view of the
    specific provision that the Executive Council and the Body of
    Delegates may act by a majority of its members as to their procedure,
    I feel confident that, except in cases where otherwise provided, both
    bodies can only act by unanimous vote of the countries represented. If
    that be the right construction, then there can be no objection to have
    it specifically stated, and it will remove emphatic objection already
    made on this ground. It is a complete safeguard against involving the
    United States primarily in small distant wars to which the United
    States has no immediate relation, for the reason that the plan for
    taking care of such a war, to be recommended or advised by the
    Executive Council, must be approved by a representative of the United
    States on the Board.

    Monroe Doctrine

    Add to Article X.

    (a) Quote A state or states of America, a member or members of the
    League, and competent to fulfil this obligation in respect to American
    territory or independence, may, in event of the aggression, actual or
    threatened, expressly assume the obligation and relieve the European
    or non-American members of the League from it until they shall be
    advised by such American state or states of the need for their aid
    End Quote.

    Explanation

    Objection has been made that under Article X, European governments
    would come to America with force and be concerned in matters from
    which heretofore the United States has excluded them. This is not
    true, because Spain fought Chili, in Seward's time, without objection
    from the United States, and so Germany and England instituted a
    blockade against Venezuela in Roosevelt's time. This fear could be
    removed, however, by the first of the above paragraphs. Paragraph (b)
    is the Monroe Doctrine pure and simple. I forwarded this in my first
    memorandum. It will be observed that Article X only covers the
    integrity and independence of members of the League. There may be some
    American countries which are not sufficiently responsible to make it
    wise to invite them into the League. This second paragraph covers
    them. The expression Quote European or non-American End Quote is
    inserted for the purpose of indicating that Great Britain, though it
    has American dominion, is not to acquire further territory or
    sovereignty.

    Japanese Immigration and Tariffs

    Add to Article XV.

    Quote If the difference between the parties shall be found by the
    Executive Council or the Body of Delegates to be a question which by
    international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction and
    polity of one of the parties, it shall so report and not recommend a
    settlement of the dispute End Quote.

    Explanation

    Objection is made to Article XV that under its terms the United States
    would be found by unanimous recommendation for settlement of a dispute
    in respect to any issue foreign or domestic; that it therefore might
    be affected seriously, and unjustly, by recommendations forbidding
    tariffs on importations. In my judgment, we could only rely on the
    public opinion of the world evidenced by the Body of Delegates, not to
    interfere with our domestic legislation and action. Nor do I think
    that under the League as it is, we covenant to abide by a unanimous
    recommendation. But if there is a specific exception made in respect
    to matters completely within the domestic jurisdiction and legislation
    of a country, the whole criticism is removed. The Republican senators
    are trying to stir up anxiety among Republicans lest this is to be a
    limitation upon our tariff. The President has already specifically met
    the objection as to limitation upon the tariff when the Fourteen
    Points were under discussion. Nevertheless in this respect to the
    present language of the Covenant, it would help much to meet and
    remove objections, and cut the ground under senatorial obstruction.

For Secretary Lansing from Polk.

Following are proposed amendments to the Constitution of the League of Nations which have been
drafted by Mr. Root:

First Amendment: Strike out Article XIII, and insert the following: The high contracting powers
agree to refer to the existing Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, or to the Court
of Arbitral Justice proposed at the Second Hague Conference when established, or to some other
arbitral tribunal, all disputes between them (including those affecting honour and vital interests)
which are of a justiciable character, and which the powers concerned have failed to settle
by diplomatic methods. The powers so referring to arbitration agree to accept and give effect
to the award of the Tribunal.

Any question which may arise as to whether a dispute is of a justiciable character is to be
referred for decision to the Court of Arbitral Justice when constituted, or, until it is constituted,
to the existing Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

Second Amendment. Add to Article XIV the following paragraphs:

The Executive Council shall call a general conference of the powers to meet not less than two
years or more than five years after the signing of this convention for the purpose of reviewing
the condition of international law, and of agreeing upon and stating in authoritative form
the principles and rules thereof.

Thereafter regular conferences for that purpose shall be called and held at stated times.

Third Amendment.

Fourth Amendment. Add to Article X the following:

After the expiration of five years from the signing of this convention any party may terminate
its obligation under this article by giving one year's notice in writing to the Secretary General
of the League.

Fifth Amendment. Add to Article IX the following:

Such commission shall have full power of inspection and verification personally and by authorized
agents as to all armament, equipment, munitions, and industries referred to in Article VIII.

Sixth Amendment. Add to Article XXIV the following:

The Executive Council shall call a general conference of members of the League to meet not
less than five nor more than ten years after the signing of this convention for the revision
thereof, and at that time, or at any time thereafter upon one year's notice, any member may
withdraw from the League.

POLK, Acting.

       *       *       *       *       *

The first suggestion made by Mr. Root is not only substantially expressed in Article XIII of
the Treaty, but almost literally, in its very text, appears in this section of the Covenant.

As will readily be seen, Mr. Root's definition of "disputes of justiciable character" is embodied
literally in Article XIII of the Covenant, Mr. Root's exact language having been appropriated
at the Peace Commission.

In Article XIX of the Covenant it is provided that the Assembly meet from time to time to engage
in "the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace
of the world." If it may be said that this provision of Article XIX does not make it mandatory
upon the council to meet at fixed periods, for the purpose of reviewing international conditions,
on the other hand it may be urged that it empowers the Assembly to advise such a review at
any time, and the Council to make such review at any time and as often as the necessities might
permit. "The consideration of international conditions" certainly comprehends a review of international
law and a rectification of its imperfections, so that substantially the whole of this suggestion
by Mr. Root is in the Covenant.

The third amendment of the Covenant suggested by Mr. Root is exceedingly interesting in several
particulars. Those who would invoke the aid and sympathy of the Government of the United States
in the effort for Irish freedom will observe that Mr. Root herein precludes the United States
from having any interest in, or wish to intrude upon or interfere with, the political policy
of the internal administration of any foreign state. It will be noted that nowhere in his suggested
modifications of the Covenant does Mr. Root suggest any alteration whatsoever of Article X,
as it stands. On the contrary, in Mr. Root's third suggested amendment he proposed to put the
United States definitely on record as acceding "to the wish of the European states that this
nation shall join its powers to theirs for the preservation of general peace."

The final proposition contained in Mr. Root's proposed third amendment is broadly cared for
in Article XXI of the Covenant relating to the Monroe Doctrine, and by implication in paragraph
8 of Article XV, which prohibits any recommendation by the Council as to the settlement of
the matters solely within the domestic jurisdiction of any member of the League.

It may, furthermore, be stated that the President cheerfully agreed to a reservation presented
by Mr. Hitchcock, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, even more specifically withholding
all domestic questions from the jurisdiction of the League.

Mr. Root's fourth suggested amendment proposed to permit any member of the League to terminate
its obligations, under Article X, by giving one year's notice of its desire. While no such
modification of Article X was made, the much broader right was given to any nation to renounce
all of its obligations to the League and to terminate its membership of the League upon two
years' notice at any time after joining.

The fifth suggested amendment by Mr. Root, proposing a modification of Article IX, by empowering
a commission to inspect and verify, either personally or by authorized agents, all armaments,
equipment, munitions, and industries relating to the manufacture of war material, does not
appear to have been adopted, nor can any one rationally insist that it was essential to accept
this suggestion. Article IX provides for the appointment of a permanent commission to advise
the Council of the execution of those provisions of the Covenant. relating to armament, equipment,
munitions, etc., in the military and naval branches of industry.

A sane interpretation of this article would imply that the commission has power to inspect
and verify facts, because in no other way could it possibly function.

Mr. Root's sixth proposed amendment makes it mandatory upon the Executive Council of the League
to call a general conference of members to meet not less than five years or more than ten years
after the signing of the Covenant for purposes of revision, etc. This modification of the Covenant
was not made, but the fact that it was omitted by no manner of means precludes the exercise
of that particular function by the Council. Without Mr. Root's amendment it is perfectly competent
for the Council to convene such a meeting of the members of the League at any time. It might
do this in less time than five years, or it might postpone the doing of it for ten years or
a longer period.

PRESIDENT WILSON,
  Paris.

As we see it from this distance, the selfish designs of Japan are as indefensible as are those
of Italy. The two situations appear to parallel each other in their bearing upon the fate of
weak and helpless nations. Would it not be an opportune time to cast another die, this one
in the direction of Japan, that the whole world may know once and for all where America stands
upon this, the greatest issue of the peace we are trying to make? Now is the time to use your
heavy artillery and emphasize the danger of secret treaties and selfish designs of certain
big nations.

Am very grateful for your message of approval about the Japanese business. It has warmed my
heart mightily. The difficulties here would have been incredible to me before I got here. Your
support kept me in heart.

It appears to me from this end that the Japanese demands will soon produce another crisis.
If such a crisis arises, I hope you will in any statement you make emphasize again America's
purpose and her unwillingness to consent to any imperialistic peace. The whole country will
be with you in this matter as never before. I think that your Italian statement was the beginning
of a real peace and a real league of nations.

The solution of the Kiauchau question is regarded here both generally and by special friends
of China, like Charles R. Crane, as remarkably favourable and fortunate considering its rotten
and complicated past and the tangle of secret treaties in which she was enmeshed and from which
she had to be extricated. It is regarded as a wonderful victory for the President. The Japanese
themselves admit that they have made far greater concessions than they had even dreamed would
be required of them. The Chinese agreed that they have great confidence in their interests
being safeguarded in every way and they appreciate that the League of Nations eventually will
look after them.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

I have not made use of the Japanese statement but am keeping my ear to the ground and waiting.
My feeling is that an attempt to explain the compromise when no demand is made, would weaken
our position instead of strengthening it. I will therefore do nothing about the Japanese matter
unless you insist. It would help if I could unofficially say: First, the date of your probable
return to this country; Second, whether tour country to discuss the League of Nations is possible.
The adoption of the labour programme as part of the peace programme is most important, but
not enough emphasis is being placed upon it. Could you not make a statement of some kind that
we could use here, showing the importance of this programme as helping toward the stabilization
of labour conditions throughout the world?
