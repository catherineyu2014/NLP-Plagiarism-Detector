In presenting this book to the public the writer desires to say that, having in view the great
importance of thorough work in land draining, and believing it advisable to avoid every thing
which might be construed into an approval of half-way measures, he has purposely taken the
most radical view of the whole subject, and has endeavored to emphasize the necessity for the
utmost thoroughness in all draining operations, from the first staking of the lines to the
final filling-in of the ditches.

That it is sometimes necessary, because of limited means, or limited time, or for other good
reasons, to drain partially or imperfectly, or with a view only to temporary results, is freely
acknowledged. In these cases the occasion for less completeness in the work must determine
the extent to which the directions herein laid down are to be disregarded; but it is believed
that, even in such cases, the principles on which those directions are founded should be always
borne in mind.

CHAPTER I. - LAND TO BE DRAINED AND THE REASONS WHY.

Land which requires draining hangs out a sign of its condition, more or less clear, according
to its circumstances, but always unmistakable to the practiced eye. Sometimes it is the broad
banner of standing water, or dark, wet streaks in plowed land, when all should be dry and of
even color; sometimes only a fluttering rag of distress in curling corn, or wide-cracking clay,
or feeble, spindling, shivering grain, which has survived a precarious winter, on the ice-stilts
that have stretched its crown above a wet soil; sometimes the quarantine flag of rank growth
and dank miasmatic fogs.

To recognize these indications is the first office of the drainer; the second, to remove the
causes from which they arise.

If a rule could be adopted which would cover the varied circumstances of different soils, it
would be somewhat as follows: All lands, of whatever texture or kind, in which the spaces between
the particles of soil are filled with water, (whether from rain or from springs,) within less
than four feet of the surface of the ground, except during and immediately after heavy rains,
require draining.

Of course, the particles of the soil cannot be made dry, nor should they be; but, although
they should be moist themselves, they should be surrounded with air, not with water. To illustrate
this: suppose that water be poured into a barrel filled with chips of wood until it runs over
at the top. The spaces between the chips will be filled with water, and the chips themselves
will absorb enough to become thoroughly wet;—this represents the worst condition of a wet soil.
If an opening be made at the bottom of the barrel, the water which fills the spaces between
the chips will be drawn off, and its place will be taken by air, while the chips themselves
will remain wet from the water which they hold by absorption. A drain at the bottom of a wet
field draws away the water from the free spaces between its particles, and its place is taken
by air, while the particles hold, by attraction, the moisture necessary to a healthy condition
of the soil.

There are vast areas of land in this country which do not need draining. The whole range of
sands, gravels, light loams and moulds allow water to pass freely through them, and are sufficiently
drained by nature, provided, they are as open at the bottom as throughout the mass. A sieve
filled with gravel will drain perfectly; a basin filled with the same gravel will not drain
at all. More than this, a sieve filled with the stiffest clay, if not "puddled,"(1) will drain
completely, and so will heavy clay soils on porous and well drained subsoils. Money expended
in draining such lands as do not require the operation is, of course, wasted; and when there
is doubt as to the requirement, tests should be made before the outlay for so costly work is
encountered.

There is, on the other hand, much land which only by thorough-draining can be rendered profitable
for cultivation, or healthful for residence, and very much more, described as "ordinarily dry
land," which draining would greatly improve in both productive value and salubrity.

*The Surface Indications* of the necessity for draining are various. Those of actual swamps
need no description; those of land in cultivation are more or less evident at different seasons,
and require more or less care in their examination, according to the circumstances under which
they are manifested.

If a plowed field show, over a part or the whole of its surface, a constant appearance of dampness,
indicating that, as fast as water is dried out from its upper parts, more is forced up from
below, so that after a rain it is much longer than other lands in assuming the light color
of dry earth, it unmistakably needs draining.

A pit, sunk to the depth of three or four feet in the earth, may collect water at its bottom,
shortly after a rain;—this is a sure sign of the need of draining.

All tests of the condition of land as to water,—such as trial pits, etc.,—should be made, when
practicable, during the wet spring weather, or at a time when the springs and brooks are running
full. If there be much water in the soil, even at such times, it needs draining.

If the water of heavy rains stands for some time on the surface, or if water collects in the
furrow while plowing, draining is necessary to bring the land to its full fertility.

Other indications may be observed in dry weather;—wide cracks in the soil are caused by the
drying of clays, which, by previous soaking, have been pasted together; the curling of corn
often indicates that in its early growth it has been prevented, by a wet subsoil, from sending
down its roots below the reach of the sun’s heat, where it would find, even in the dryest weather,
sufficient moisture for a healthy growth; any severe effect of drought, except on poor sands
and gravels, may be presumed to result from the same cause; and a certain wiryness of grass,
together with a mossy or mouldy appearance of the ground, also indicate excessive moisture
during some period of growth. The effects of drought are, of course, sometimes manifested on
soils which do not require draining,—such as those poor gravels, which, from sheer poverty,
do not enable plants to form vigorous and penetrating roots; but any soil of ordinary richness,
which contains a fair amount of clay, will withstand even a severe drought, without great injury
to its crop, if it is thoroughly drained, and is kept loose at its surface.

Poor crops are, when the cultivation of the soil is reasonably good, caused either by inherent
poverty of the land, or by too great moisture during the season of early growth. Which of these
causes has operated in a particular case may be easily known. Manure will correct the difficulty
in the former case, but in the latter there is no real remedy short of such a system of drainage
as will thoroughly relieve the soil of its surplus water.

*The Sources of the Water* in the soil are various. Either it falls directly upon the land
as rain; rises into it from underlying springs; or reaches it through, or over, adjacent land.

The rain water belongs to the field on which it falls, and it would be an advantage if it could
all be made to pass down through the first three or four feet of the soil, and be removed from
below. Every drop of it is freighted with fertilizing matters washed out from the air, and
in its descent through the ground, these are given up for the use of plants; and it performs
other important work among the vegetable and mineral parts of the soil.

The spring water does not belong to the field,—not a drop of it,—and it ought not to be allowed
to show itself within the reach of the roots of ordinary plants. It has fallen on other land,
and, presumably, has there done its appointed work, and ought not to be allowed to convert
our soil into a mere outlet passage for its removal.

The ooze water,—that which soaks out from adjoining land,—is subject to all the objections
which hold against spring water, and should be rigidly excluded.

But the surface water which comes over the surface of higher ground in the vicinity, should
be allowed every opportunity, which is consistent with good husbandry, to work its slow course
over our soil,—not to run in such streams as will cut away the surface, nor in such quantities
as to make the ground inconveniently wet, but to spread itself in beneficent irrigation, and
to deposit the fertilizing matters which it contains, then to descend through a well-drained
subsoil, to a free outlet.

From whatever source the water comes, it cannot remain stagnant in any soil without permanent
injury to its fertility.
