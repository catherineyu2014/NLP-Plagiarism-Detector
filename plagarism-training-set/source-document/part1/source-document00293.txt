In Canada these successive conflicts had found many echoes.  During the French régime Gallican
principles of the power of the king over the Church had been frequently asserted; governor
or intendant had, in a few notable instances, endeavoured to bridle the Church authorities.
When the English came, the Church lost its place as the state church, but it consolidated its
power, and soon was freer from intervention than it had been under the Most Christian King
of France.  During the French Revolution Canada was kept {28} isolated from contact with France,
but after the Restoration, with ultramontanism in the ascendant, intercourse was favoured;
and the most thoroughgoing principles of clerical supremacy, with the most militant methods
of controversy, found lodgment here.  In both private and public life, among clergy as well
as laity, each of the opposing tendencies was stoutly championed.

When Wilfrid Laurier went to Montreal in 1861, the leaders of the Liberal or Rouge party had
sobered down from the fiery radicalism of their youth, and were content to leave the authorities
of the Church alone.  But leading authorities of the Church remained suspicious of that party.
Bishop Bourget of Montreal, one of the most pious and energetic of ecclesiastics, firm to the
point of obstinacy, seemed determined to crush it out.  And though many eminent churchmen held
out for a broader and more tolerant policy, the ultramontanes, by reason of their crusading
zeal, steadily gained the ascendancy.

The issues raised in Quebec were manifold.  Among them were the right of private judgment,
the authority of canon law in the province, civil or ecclesiastical control over marriage,
clerical immunity from the {29} jurisdiction of civil courts, and the degree of intervention
which was permissible to the clergy in elections.

The first question, that of the right of private judgment, concerned the future leader of Canadian
Liberalism and became acute in connection with the Institut Canadien of Montreal.  This was
a literary and scientific society, founded in 1844 by some members of the same group who later
organized the Rouge party.  It supplied the want of a public library and reading-room in Montreal,
and a hundred branches sprang up throughout the province.  The Institut soon fell under the
suspicion of a section of the clergy.  It was declared by Bishop Bourget that immoral or heretical
books which had been put on the Index were contained in the library.  Rival societies were
founded under the auspices of the Church and many of the members of the Institut were induced
to secede.

Nevertheless young Laurier joined the Institut shortly after coming to Montreal.  In 1863 he
was one of a committee of four who endeavoured in vain to induce Bishop Bourget to specify
what books were under the ban, and in 1865 and 1866 he was a vice-president of the society.
Like his associates, he was {30} placed in a difficult position by the bishop's unyielding
attitude, for he did not wish to quarrel with his Church.  So far as he was concerned, however,
his removal to Arthabaskaville in 1866 ended the episode.

The remaining members of the Institut struggled on until 1868, when they published a Year-Book
containing an address by Mr L. A. Dessaules, president of the Institut, commending toleration.[1]
A nice question of interpretation followed.  Mr Dessaules asserted that he meant to urge personal
toleration and good-will.  Bishop Bourget contended that the address meant dogmatic toleration
or indifference, the attitude that one creed was as good as another.  In spite of an appeal
to Rome by Joseph Doutre the work was placed on the Index, and the announcement followed that
members who persisted in adhering to the Institut would be refused the sacraments of the Church.
After this blow the Institut {31} dwindled away and in time disappeared entirely.

Meanwhile Mr Laurier's weekly newspaper at Arthabaskaville, Le Défricheur, had come under the
ban of Bishop Laflèche of Three Rivers, in whose diocese the little village lay.  Subscribers
refused to take their copies from the postmaster, or quietly called at the office to announce
that, in spite of their personal sympathy, they were too much afraid of the curés--or of their
own wives--to continue their subscriptions.  The editor warmly protested against the arbitrary
action, which threatened at once to throttle his freedom of speech and to wipe out his saved
and borrowed capital.  But the forces arrayed against him were too strong, and some six months
after the first number under his management appeared, Le Défricheur went the way of many other
Liberal journals in Quebec.  It was not likely that Mr Laurier's growing law practice would
have long permitted him to edit the paper, but at the moment the blow was none the less felt.

[1] 'Is it not permissible,' Mr Dessaules asked, 'when Protestants and Catholics are placed
side by side in a country, in a city, for them to join in the pursuit of knowledge? ...  What
is toleration?  It is reciprocal indulgence, sympathy, Christian charity....  It is fraternity,
the spirit, of religion well understood....  It is at bottom humility, the idea that others
are not worthless, that others are as good as ourselves....  Intolerance is pride; it is the
idea that we are better than others; it is egotism, the idea that we owe others nothing.'

CHAPTER III

FIRST YEARS IN PARLIAMENT

In the Provincial Legislature--In federal politics--The Mackenzie government--The Riel question--Protection
or free trade--The Catholic programme--Catholic liberalism--The clergy in politics--Political
liberalism--In the administration

Less than five years had passed after Wilfrid Laurier came to Arthabaskaville, a boyish, unknown
lawyer-editor, when he was chosen by an overwhelming majority as member for Drummond-Arthabaska
in the provincial legislature.  His firmly based Liberalism, his power as a speaker, his widespread
popularity, had very early marked him out as the logical candidate of his party.  On many grounds
he was prepared to listen to the urging of his friends.  His interest in politics was only
second, if second it was, to his interest in his profession.  The ambition to hold a place
in parliament was one which appealed to practically every able young lawyer of his time in
Quebec, and, thanks to the short sessions of the provincial assembly and the nearness of Arthabaska
to Quebec, membership in the legislature would not greatly interfere with his work at home.
Yet his health was still {33} precarious, and it was with much hesitation and reluctance that
he finally consented to stand for the county in 1871, at the second general election since
Confederation.  Though ill throughout the campaign, he was able to make a few speeches, and
the loyal support of his friends did the rest.  His opponent, Edward Hemming, a barrister of
Drummondville, had been the previous member for the riding.  At the close of the polls--those
were still the days of open voting--it was found that, while the Liberal party in the province
was once more badly defeated, Wilfrid Laurier had won his seat by over one thousand majority.

When the legislature met at Quebec in November, there was a lively interest on both sides of
the chamber in the young man of thirty who had scored such a notable victory.  At that time
the legislature had an unusually large number of men of first rank in eloquence and parliamentary
ability, including Cartier, Chapleau, Cauchon, Holton, and Irvine.  All these except Chapleau
were also members of the House of Commons, since at that time no law forbade dual representation,
and the standards were relatively high.  The Government under Chauveau, the prime minister,
{34} was too firmly entrenched to be shaken by any assaults from the Opposition leader, Henri
Joly de Lotbinière, and his scanty following.  In the criticism, however, the member for Arthabaska
took a notable part.  He did not speak often, but when he did his remarks were fresh and constructive.
In the debate on the Address he scored the Government for its backward educational policy,
urged active steps to check the exodus of French Canadians to the mills of New England, praised
the ideals of British Liberalism, and called for a truce in racial and religious quarrels.
In a later speech he presented the keenest constitutional criticism yet made of the system
of dual representation, showing that it tended to bring the provinces too completely within
the orbit of the central power and confuse local with federal issues.  Three years later, it
may be noted, the system was abolished.

The vigour and yet moderation of these first efforts, so aptly phrased and so admirably fitted
to the peculiar requirements of parliamentary speaking, the grace and flair of the orator,
gave the member for Arthabaska at a stroke high rank in the party.  He was very soon urged
to seek the wider opportunities of federal politics.  Ottawa, it was clear, would {35} make
much greater demands upon his time than Quebec, yet his health was now improving.  Accordingly
he determined to make the change, and in the general federal elections of 1874 he was returned
for Drummond-Arthabaska by a majority of two hundred and thirty-eight.

In 1874 the Liberal Government at Ottawa, under Alexander Mackenzie, seemed assured of a long
term of office.  It had been given an overwhelming majority in the election just concluded;
its leaders were able and aggressive; and the Opposition was still crushed by the indignation
which followed on the exposure of the Pacific Scandal.

Yet there were many weaknesses in its situation, which time was to make clear.  The Government's
forces were not closely united: the only bond holding together several of the groups which
made up the majority was that of common opposition to the late administration.  Many stragglers
on the flanks were waylaid and brought back into their old camp by that arch-strategist, Sir
John Macdonald.  The question of leadership was not fully determined.  In Ontario Edward Blake
divided allegiance with {36} Alexander Mackenzie, and Blake's inability to make up his mind
definitely to serve under Mackenzie greatly weakened the party.  In Quebec the situation was
even more serious.  Dorion was the man whose constructive ability, admirable temper, and long
years of fighting against heavy odds marked him out as chief, but family and health considerations
determined him to retire to the quieter if not less heavy labours of the bench.  Fournier soon
followed.  Laflamme, in whose office Laurier had studied, was hardly a man of sufficient weight.
Holton, leader of the small group of English Liberals in Quebec, was also in very poor health.
To fill the gap Mackenzie summoned Joseph Cauchon, a former Conservative who had left his party
on the Pacific Scandal; a man of great ability, active in the campaign for Confederation, but
weakened by an unfortunate record of corruption in earlier days, a record which his Liberal
opponents of those days had painted in startling and unforgettable colours.

======================================================================

======================================================================

These difficulties were, however, not insuperable; and doubtless the party would have drilled
into working cohesion under definitely acknowledged leaders, had it not been for two more serious
sources of {37} weakness.  The first of these was the commercial depression which fell upon
Canada, in common with the rest of the world, in 1873, and made it possible for an Opposition,
itself most courageous in promises, to hold the Government responsible for all the country's
ills.  The other was Mr Mackenzie's high-minded but mistaken idea of his duty. Somewhat lacking
in imagination though he was, Alexander Mackenzie had in him the stuff out of which party leaders
are made.  He was a man of vigour and ability, a hard-hitting debater, a thoroughgoing democrat,
and he had a well-earned reputation for downright frankness and unswerving honesty which could
easily have rallied the country's trust and affection.  But while prime minister he gave to
the details of departmental administration the care and thought and time which should have
gone in part to his other duties as leader in constructive policy and chieftain of the party.
He failed to keep in touch with public opinion, and so was caught unawares.

In spite of these drawbacks the Mackenzie administration left a notable record.  It passed
the law which introduced voting by ballot and required all elections, in a general contest,
to be held on one day. It brought {38} forth the Scott Act, which proved a useful if not a
final measure of temperance reform.  It established the Royal Military College and the Supreme
Court of Canada.  It pushed the Pacific Railway forward steadily, if somewhat slowly, as a
government work.  Had the stars been favourable, the Government might well have thought itself
secure on its record of legislative progress and administrative efficiency.

The questions which roused most debate both in parliament and in the country were the Riel
Amnesty, the National Policy, and, in Quebec, the perennial issue of the relations of church
and state.  These may be noted in turn, particularly in so far as Mr Laurier took part in the
discussions.

For nearly twenty years the Riel question in its various phases bedevilled Canadian politics
and set race against race and province against province.  Had it been only the resistance offered
by the Red River settlers to Canadian authority which was in question in the seventies, time
would soon have brought understanding and forgetfulness.  That the half-breed settlers had
just grievances, that the Canadian authorities bungled badly their first experiment in national
expansion, all {39} would have admitted.  But the shooting in cold blood of Thomas Scott, an
Orangeman of Ontario, by the order of Louis Riel, lit fires of passion that would not easily
die.  And politicians fanned the flames for party ends.  Neither party was guiltless.  At the
outset in Ontario the Liberals played to the Orange gallery, while in Quebec they appealed
to French prejudices.  Sir John Macdonald could attack Blake for frightening Riel out of the
country and beyond the reach of justice, by offers of reward for his arrest, at the very time
that Macdonald himself was paying Riel out of the secret service funds to keep away from Canada.

During the Mackenzie administration the question twice gave rise to full-dress debates.  Early
in 1874 Mackenzie Bowell moved that Riel, who had been elected a member for Provencher, should
be expelled from the House; Holton moved an amendment that action be deferred until the committee,
then inquiring into the whole matter, reported; while Mousseau demanded immediate and unconditional
amnesty.  In the debate that followed Mr Laurier made his first parliamentary speech in English.
He supported Holton's amendment, while making it clear {40} that in his view of the evidence
the country had been pledged to amnesty by the action of the former Government.  It was a forceful
and well-reasoned argument, in both its felicitous phrasing and its moderate tone an appropriate
introduction to the parliamentary career which was just beginning.  Again in 1875, when Mr
Mackenzie moved that full amnesty be given to all concerned in the rebellion save Riel, Lepine,
and O'Donoghue, and that the former two be pardoned, subject to five years' banishment, Mr
Laurier defended this reasonable compromise against both the Quebec extremists who demanded
immediate pardon and the Ontario opponents of any clemency whatever.

Protection was an even more fertile topic of debate in these and following years.  It was only
recently that it had become a party issue.  Both parties had hitherto been content with the
compromise of 'tariff for revenue, with incidental protection,' though in the ranks of both
were advocates of out-and-out protection.  In Ontario the Canada First movement, which looked
to Blake as its leader, had strong protectionist leanings, and in Quebec the Parti National,
under which name the Rouges had been reorganized and made {41} ultra-respectable, were of the
same tendency.  But Mackenzie was a staunch free-trader, while the Liberals from the maritime
provinces were opposed to any increase in the tariff on the many things they consumed but did
not produce.  Accordingly, after much hesitation, the Liberals in 1876 declined to raise the
tariff beyond the existing average of seventeen and a half per cent.  At once the Conservatives,
who, it was alleged, had been prepared to advocate freer trade, came out for protection.  On
this question Laurier was more in agreement with Blake than with Mackenzie.  In early years
he had been influenced by Papineau's crusade for protection, and believed that in the existing
crisis an increase in the tariff to twenty per cent would aid the revenue and would avert a
demand for more extreme duties.  Time proved, however, that the appetites of protectionists
could not so easily be appeased; and all wings of the party presently found themselves in harmony,
in resisting the proposals to set up extremely high barriers.

But it was on the vexed question of the relations of church and state, and particularly of
the Catholic hierarchy and the Liberal party in Quebec, that Mr Laurier gave the most distinctive
service.  This question had become {42} more acute than ever.  In 1870 the ultramontane element
in the Roman Catholic Church had won a sweeping victory by inducing a majority of the Vatican
Council to promulgate the doctrine of Papal Infallibility.  There followed a wave of ultramontane
activity throughout the world, and not least in Quebec.  Bishop Bourget's hands were strengthened
by Bishop Laflèche of Three Rivers, and by other prelates and priests of perhaps less relentless
temper; while a cohort of journalists, in Le Nouveau Monde, La Vérité, Le Journal de Trois
Rivières, and other papers, devoted themselves whole-heartedly to the ultramontane cause. 
On the other hand, Archbishop Baillargeon of Quebec and his successor, Archbishop Taschereau,
the priests of the Quebec Seminary and of Laval University, and the Sulpicians at Montreal,
were disposed to live at peace.  They would all have denied sympathy either with Gallicanism
or with Catholic Liberalism, but they were men of tolerance and breadth of sympathy, very doubtful
whether such militant activity would advance the permanent interests of their Church.

There broke out a violent struggle between the two political parties in 1871, with the issue
{43} of the Catholic Programme.  This famous document was a manifesto prepared by a group of
editors and lawyers, who, in their own words, 'belonged heart and soul to the ultramontane
school'--Trudel, Desjardins, M'Leod, Renault, Beausoleil, and others--and was drawn up by A.
B. Routhier, then a lawyer in Kamouraska.  It sought to lay down a policy to govern all good
Catholics in the coming elections.  The doctrine of the separation of church and state, the
document declared, was impious and absurd.  On the contrary, the authorities of the state,
and the electors who chose them, must act in perfect accord with the teachings of the Church,
and endeavour to safeguard its interests by making such changes in the laws as the bishops
might demand.  To secure this end the Conservative party must be supported.  When two Conservatives
or two Liberals were running, the one who accepted the Programme was to be elected; where a
Conservative and a Liberal were opposed, the former would be supported; if it happened that
a Conservative who opposed the Programme was running against a Liberal who accepted it, 'the
situation would be more delicate'--and Catholics should not vote at all.

{44}

This frank declaration of war on the Liberal party, this attempt to throw the solid Catholic
vote to the Conservatives, at once aroused violent controversy.  Bishops Bourget and Laflèche
announced that they approved the manifesto in every point, while Archbishop Taschereau and
the bishops of St Hyacinthe and Rimouski declared that it had not their authorization.

The Liberal party was sorely pressed.  In the emergency some of its moderate members determined
to throw off the incubus of their anti-clerical traditions by reorganizing and renaming the
party.  So in 1871 Louis Jetté and other leading Quebec Liberals undertook to secure a fresh
start by organizing the Parti National, and the result of the following elections gave some
ground for hope.  'This evolution of the Liberal party,' declared Bishop Laflèche later in
a memorial to the Cardinals of the Sacred Congregation, 'had the success expected from it;
it made a number of dupes not only among our good Catholics but even in the ranks of the clergy,
who had hitherto been united against the Liberal party....  It is from this development that
there dates the division in the ranks of the clergy on the question of politics.'

{45}

But this prudent step did not avert the wrath of the now dominant ultramontane section.  In
1873 a brief pastoral was issued by all the bishops condemning Catholic Liberalism in vague
but sweeping terms. Two years later another joint pastoral, that of September 22, 1875, went
into the whole question elaborately.  Catholic Liberalism, that subtle serpent, was again denounced.
The right of the clergy to intervene in politics was again upheld, whether in neutral matters
in which they, like all other citizens, should have a voice, or in matters affecting faith
or morals or the interests of the Church.  In the latter case the clergy should declare with
authority that to vote in this or that way is a sin, exposing the offender to the penalties
of the Church.  In a letter issued a year later Archbishop Taschereau modified these pretensions,
but the assault went on.  Regarding the identity of the Catholic Liberals in question both
pastorals were silent, but not silent were many of the clergy who interpreted them to their
flocks.  The cap fitted the Liberal party and its chiefs, they averred, and good Catholics
must govern themselves accordingly.

This determined attempt of a section of the {46} clergy to use the influence they possessed
as spiritual guides to crush one political party aroused the most moderate sections of the
Liberals to counter-attacks.  The election law of Canada, copied from that of England, forbade
the use of undue influence in elections, and undue influence had been said to include use by
ecclesiastics of their powers to excite superstitious fears or pious hopes.  Baron Fitzgerald
had declared in the Mayo case in Ireland, in 1857, that the priest must not use threats of
punishment here or hereafter, must not threaten to withhold the sacraments or denounce voting
for any particular candidate as a sin.  The Liberals of Quebec had no desire to deny the priest
the same rights as other citizens enjoyed, of taking part in the discussion of any political
question whatever, and using all the powers of persuasion to secure this end.  But, they insisted,
for a priest to threaten eternal punishment was as much a case of undue influence as for an
employer to threaten to dismiss a workman if he would not vote for a certain candidate, and
as just a ground for voiding an election. The matter was pressed to a decision in appeals against
candidates returned in two federal by-elections, in Chambly and Charlevoix, and {47} in one
provincial election, in Bonaventure.  In these instances the proof of open partisanship and
open use of ecclesiastical pressure was overwhelming.  'The candidate who spoke last Sunday,'
declared one priest in Chambly, 'called himself a moderate Liberal.  As Catholics you cannot
vote for him; you cannot vote for a Liberal, nor for a moderate Liberal, for moderate is only
another term for liar.'  'The Church has condemned Liberalism, and to vote against the direction
of the bishops would be sin,' declared another.  'The sky of heaven is bleu, the fire of hell
is rouge,' another more pointedly urged.  'I was afraid,' one witness testified, 'that if I
voted for Tremblay I should be damned.'  In defence it was urged that, in the first place,
the civil courts had no authority over ecclesiastics, at least for acts done in their spiritual
capacity, and, in the second place, that the Church had a right to defend its interests against
attack, and that in using to this end all the powers at its disposal it was employing no undue
influence.  Judge Routhier, the author of the Catholic Programme, upheld these contentions
in the first trial of the Charlevoix case, but the Supreme Court, in judgments delivered by
Mr Justice Taschereau, brother of {48} the Archbishop, and by Mr Justice Ritchie, denied the
existence of any clerical immunity from civil jurisdiction, and found that the threats which
had been made from the pulpit constituted undue influence of the clearest kind.  Accordingly
they voided the election.  Their action met with violent protests from some of the bishops,
who, when Judge Casault in the Bonaventure case followed this precedent, sought, but in vain,
to have him removed by the Sacred Congregation from his chair in the law faculty of Laval.
But in spite of protests the lesson had been learned, and the sturdy fight of the Liberals
of Quebec for the most elementary rights of a free people had its effect.

======================================================================

======================================================================

It was when matters were at this acute stage that Wilfrid Laurier came forward to do for his
province and his country a service which could be accomplished only by a man of rarely balanced
judgment, of firm grasp of essential principles, of wide reading and familiarity with the political
ideals of other lands, and, above all, of matchless courage. Rarely, if ever, has there been
delivered in Canada a speech of such momentous importance, or one so firmly based on the first
principles with which Canadian statesmen too rarely concern {49} themselves, as that which
he addressed to Le Club Canadien, a group of young Liberals, in Quebec City in June 1877.
