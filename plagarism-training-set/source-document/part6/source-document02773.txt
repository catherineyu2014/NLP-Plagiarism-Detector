PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

VOL. 152.

April 4th, 1917.

CHARIVARIA.

The KAISER has conferred upon the Turkish GRAND VIZIER the Order of the Black Eagle. The GRAND
VIZIER has had persistent bad luck.

       ***

"A few weeks ago," says Mr. ROBERT BLATCHFORD, I asked, "What manner of man is the Tsar? And
now he has abdicated." We understand that the EX-TSAR absolves Mr. BLATCHFORD from all blame.

       ***

The Amsterdam rumour to the effect that eighty thousand German soldiers had surrendered was
followed the next day by the report that it was really ninety thousand. It appears that a recount
was demanded.

       ***

The Evening News, ever ready to assist with economical hints, now throws out suggestions for
renovating last year's suit. No mention is made, however, of the fact that people with fur
coats can now obtain quite cheap butterfly-nets for the moth-chasing season.

       ***

In the Reichstag a member of the Socialist Minority Party has denounced the KAISER as the originator
of the War. The denunciation made little impression on the House, as it was generally felt
that he must have been listening to some idle street-corner gossip.

       ***

A cat's-meat-man informed the Southwark Tribunal at a recent sitting that he served over four
hundred families a day. The unwisdom of permitting cats to have families in war-time has been
made the subject of adverse comment.

       ***

"I swear by Almighty God that I will speak the truth, no nonsense, and won't be foolish," was
the form of oath taken by a witness at a recent case in the Bloomsbury County Court. It was
explained to him that this was only suitable for persons taking office under the Crown.

       ***

It was urged on behalf of a man at the Harrow Tribunal that there would be no boots in the
Army to fit him. If a small enough pair can be found for him it is understood that he will
join the police.

       ***

We fear an injustice has been done to the large number of Mexicans who have lately entered
the United States. It was at first suggested that they were of pro-German sympathies, but it
now appears that they were only fugitives who had fled from the elections in Mexico.

       ***

       ***

A man at Bristol charged as an absentee said that he had been so busy wilting poetry that he
had forgotten all about military matters. His very emphatic assurance that he will now push
on with the War has afforded the liveliest satisfaction to the authorities concerned.

       ***

"Owing to restrictions on the output of beer," says a contemporary, "the passing of the village
inn is merely a question of time." Even before the War it often took hours and hours.

       ***

It is announced that a wealthy American lady with Socialistic leanings will, at the end of
the War, marry a well-known conscientious objector at present undergoing a term of imprisonment.
The American craze for curio-hunting has not abated one bit.

       ***

A woman in North London who two years ago offered her services to the Government in any capacity
has just been informed that her offer is noted. There is good reason to believe that she will
he among the first women called upon for service in our next war.

       ***

Because a man had jilted her fifteen years ago, a Spanish woman shot him while he was being
married to another woman. It is a remarkable thing, but rarely does a marriage ceremony go
off in Spain without some little hitch or other.

       ***

Proper mastication of food is necessary in these times, and we are not surprised to hear that
one large dental firm are advertising double sets of teeth with a two-speed gear attachment.

       ***

Complaint has been made by a brass finisher at Oldham that his fellow-workmen will not speak
to him because he receives less wages than they do. To end an awkward situation it is hoped
that the good fellow may eventually consent to accept a weekly wage on the higher scale.

NOTICE.

The Proprietors of Punch are glad to announce that they find themselves in a position to revert,
for the time being at any rate, to the type and size of Punch as they were before the recent
changes.

PUNCH'S ROLL OF HONOUR.

WE record with deep regret the death from pneumonia of Captain HARRY NEVILLE GITTINS, R.G.A.,
on Active Service. He was a member of the Territorials before the outbreak of war, and, after
serving two years at home, went out to France in August of last year. His light-hearted contributions
to Punch will be greatly missed.

THE HOHENZOLLERN PROSPECT.

REFLECTIONS OF THE HEIR-APPARENT.

  When I've surveyed with half-shut eyes,
    Over the winking Champagne wine,
  What I shall do when Father dies
    And hands me down his right divine,
  Often I've said that, when in God's
    Good time he goes, I mean to show 'em
  How scorpions sting in place of rods,
    Taking my cue from REHOBOAM.

  But now with Liberty on the loose,
    And All the Russias capped in red,
  And Demos hustling like the deuce,
    And Tsardom's day as good as dead--
  When on the Dynasty they dance
    And with the Imperial Orb play hockey,
  I feel that LITTLE WILLIE'S chance
    Looks, at the moment, rather rocky.

  Well, at the worst, I have my loot;
    And if, in search of healthier air,
  We Hohenzollerns do a scoot,
    There's wine and women everywhere;
  And, for myself, I frankly own
    A taste for privacy;  I should rather
  Not face the high light on a throne--
    But O my poor, my poor old Father!

THE MUD LARKS.

THE French are a great people; the more I see of them the more I admire them, and I have been
seeing a lot of them lately.

I seem to have spent the last week eating six-course dinners in cellars with grizzled sky-blue
colonels, endeavouring to reply to their charming compliments in a mixture of Gaelic and CORNELIUS
NEPOS. I myself had no intention of babbling these jargons; it is the fault of my tongue, which
takes charge on these occasions, and seems to be under the impression that, when it is talking
to a foreigner, any foreign language will do.

Atkins, I notice, also suffers from a form of the same delusion. When talking to a Frenchman,
he employs a mangled cross between West Coast and China pidgin, and by placing a long E at
the end of every word imagines he is making himself completely clear to the suffering Gaul.
And the suffering Gaul listens to it all with incredible patience and courtesy, and, what is
more, somehow or other disentangles a meaning, thereby proving himself the most intelligent
creature on earth.

We have always prided ourselves that the teaching of modern languages in our island seminaries
is unique; but such is not the case. Here and there in France, apparently, they teach English
on the same lines. I discovered this, the other day, when we called on a French battery to
have the local tactical situation explained to us. I was pushed forward as the star linguist
of our party; the French produced a smiling Captain as theirs. The non-combatants of both sides
then sat back and waited for their champions to begin. I felt a trifle nervous myself, and
the Frenchman didn't seem too happy. We filled in a few minutes bowing, saluting, kissing and
shaking hands, and then let Babel loose, I in my fourth-form French, and he, to my amazement,
in equally elementary English. The affair looked hopeless from the start; if either of us would
have consented to talk in his own language, the other might have understood him, but neither
of us could, before that audience, with our reputations at stake.

Towards lunch-time things grew really desperate; we had got as far as "the pen of my female
cousin," but the local tactical situation remained as foggy as ever, our backers were showing
signs of impatience, and we were both lathering freely. Then by some happy chance we discovered
we had both been in Africa, fell crowing into each other's arms, and the local tactical situation
was cleared "one time" in flowing Swahili. Our respective reputations as linguists are now
beyond doubt.

We became fast friends, this Captain and I. He bore me off to his cellar, stood me the usual
six-course feed (with wines), and after it was over asked how I would like to while away the
afternoon. I left it in his hands. "Eh bien, let us play on the Bosch a little," he suggested.
It sounded as pleasant a light after-dinner amusement as any, so I bowed and we sallied forth.

He led me to his observation post, spoke down a telephone, and about twenty yards of Hun parapet
were not. "That will spoil his siesta," said my Captain. "By the way, his Headquarters is behind
that ruined farm,"

"Which?" I inquired; there were several farms about, none of them in any great state of repair.

"I will show you--watch," he replied, talked into the 'phone again, and far away a cloud, a
cloud of brick dust, smoked aloft. "Voilà!"

He thereupon pointed out all the objects of local interest in the same fashion.

"We will now give him fifty rounds for luck, and then we will return to my cellar for a cup
of coffee," said he, and a further twenty yards of Hun parapet were removed.

Suddenly there came an answering salvo from Hunland, and a flock of shells whizzed over our heads.

"Tiens!" my Captain exclaimed. "He has lost his little temper, has he? Naughty, naughty! I
must give him a slap. A hundred rounds!" he shouted into the 'phone, and the German lines spouted
like a school of whales blowing.

Again the Bosch slammed across a heavy reply. My Captain leapt to his 'phone. "He would answer
me back, would he? The impudence! Give him a thousand rounds, my children!"

Then for the next hour or so the sky was filled with a screaming tornado of shells, rushing,
bumping, and bursting, and the Bosch lines sagged, bulged, quivered, slopped over, and were
spattered against the blue in small smithereens.

"And now let us see what he says to that," said my Captain pleasantly. We waited, we watched,
we listened; but there came no reply (possibly because there was no one left to make one),
and my Captain turned to me, shoulders shrugged, palms outspread, a grimace of apologetic disgust
on his mobile face--like a circus-master explaining that his clown has got the measles: "Nottin,
see you? Pas d'esprit, l'animal!"

Certainly Hans the Hun does not seem to be enjoying the same high spirits he did of yore. Possibly
he is beginning to regret the day he left the old beer garden, his ample Gretchen, and the
fatty foods his figure demands. The story of Patrick and Goldilocks would tend to prove as much.

The other day Patrick was engaged in one of those little "gains" which straighten out the unsightly
kinks in the "line" and give the War-correspondents a chance to get their names in print.

Patrick and his friends attacked in a snowstorm, dropped into a German post, gave the occupants
every assistance in evacuating, and prepared to make themselves at home. While they were clearing
up the mess, they found they had taken a prisoner, a blond Bavarian hero who had found it impossible
to leave with his friends on account of half-a-ton of sandbags on his chest. They excavated
him, told him if he was a good boy they'd give him a ticket to Donington Hall at nightfall,
christened him Goldilocks for the time being, and threw him some rations, among which was a
tin of butter.

He listened to all they had to say in a dazed sulky fashion, but at the sight of the tin of
butter he gurgled drunkenly and seemed to go light-headed. He spent a perfect day revelling
in the joys of anticipation, crooning over that butter, cuddling it, hiding it in one pocket
after the other. Towards dusk down came the snow again, and under cover thereof the Bosch counter-attacked.

Patrick says he suddenly heard the bull voice of a Hun officer hic-coughing gutturals, and
they were on him. He had no time to send up an S.O.S. rocket, and his machine-gun jammed. In
a minute they were all mixed up, at it tooth and claw as merry as a Galway election, the big
Bosch officer, throwing off a hymn of hate, the life and soul of the party. He came for Patrick
with an automatic, and Patrick thought all was up; and so it would have been but for Goldilocks,
who materialized suddenly out of nowhere, deftly tripped up his officer from behind, and, dancing
on his stomach with inspired hooves, trod him out of sight.

Their moving spirit being wiped out, the Huns lost whatever heart they had had, and went through
their "Kamerad" exercise without further ado.

When the excitement was over Patrick sought out Goldilocks, and, shaking him warmly by the
hand, thanked him for suppressing the officer and saving the situation.

"Situation be damned" (or words to that effect), Goldilocks retorted. "He would have pinched
my butter!"

THE FLOWERLESS FUTURE.

(Notes from a Society newspaper of the coming vegetable epoch.)

PERSONAL PARS.

We regret to learn that Lady Diana Dashweed has returned from Nice suffering from nervous shock.
During a battle of vegetables at the recent carnival Lady Diana, while in the act of aiming
a tomato at a well-known peer, was struck on the head by a fourteen-pound marrow hurled by
some unknown admirer. There is unfortunately a growing tendency at these festivities to use
missiles over the regulation weight.

A daring innovation was made by last Wednesday's bride. One has become so accustomed to the
orthodox cauliflower bouquet at weddings that it came almost as a shock to see her holding
a huge bunch of rich crimson beetroots, tied with old-gold streamers. The effect however was
altogether delightful.

The decorations for a particularly smart "pink-and-white" dinner at one of our smartest restaurants
last evening were charmingly carried out in spring rhubarb and Spanish onions, the table being
softly illuminated by tinted electric lights concealed in hollow turnips, fashioned to represent
the heads of famous statesmen.

FROM THE SERIAL STORY.

"Sick at heart, Adela tottered across the room and, opening her bureau, drew from its secret
hiding-place an old letter. As she tremblingly removed it from the envelope a few faded leaves
fluttered down to the floor. It was the brussels-sprout he had given her on the night they parted."

    "The stream proved treacherous in the extreme, being a succession of
    rapids and whirlpools. Often their magazine rifles and automatic
    revolvers were all that stood between them and death."--Observer.

We always use a Winchester repeater for shooting rapids.

    "Merely as photographs these postcards are remarkable. As ikons for men
    to vow by; as lessons for women to show their children in days to
    come--when the Hun octopus roots himself again in the comity of
    civilised nations, lying in wait at our doorways, stretching out his
    antennæ, like those foul things that lurk at sea-cavern mouths--these
    eight pictures have historical value."--Daily Mail.

Biologists too will be glad to have this description of the habits and characteristics of that
fearsome beast the Octopus Germanicus.

  When good KING ARTHUR ruled this land he was a goodly king,
  He stored ten sacks of barleymeal to last him through the Spring;
  The Food-Controller heard thereof, and said, "This wicked hoarding

CHILDREN'S TALES FOR GROWN-UPS.

v.

THE RIVALS.

The frog challenged the nightingale to a singing contest. "Of course for gurgling and untutored
warbling I know he has it," he said to his friend the toad, "but in technique I shall beat
him hollow."

So the jury was chosen. The nightingale proposed the lark, the thrush, the blackbird and the
bullfinch as experts in singing, and the frog proposed the starling, the linnet, the chaffinch
and the reed-warbler.

The nightingale was overcome with emotion at the generosity of the frog, and insisted on adding
the crow and the toad as experts in croaking.

The nightingale sang first, whilst his trade rivals sat and chattered. They chattered so loud
that the nightingale stopped singing in a huff.

"You are hardly at your best, you know, old thing," said the linnet sympathetically.

"You will find these throat lozenges excellent for hoarseness," said the blackbird.

"His upper register is weak--abominably weak," said the starling to the lark.

"Perhaps if his voice were trained," suggested the lark.

Meanwhile the frog croaked away lustily, but no one listened to him. "The jury must vote by
ballot," he said as he finished the last croak.

"Of course we must," twittered the jury.

The frog won by eight votes to two.

"I voted for the nightingale," whispered the crow to the toad.

"So did I," whispered the toad.

A LOSS.

For many reasons the passing of the poster is to be welcomed. For one thing, it robbed the
papers themselves of that element of surprise which is one of life's few spices; for another,
it added to life's many complexities by forcing the reader into a hunt through the columns
which often ended in disappointment: in other words the poster's promise was not seldom greater
than the paper's performance. Then, again, it was often offensive, as when it called for the
impeachment of an effete "old gang," many of whose members had joined the perfect new; or redundant,
as when it demanded twenty ropes where one would have sufficed. Such as ("reading from left
to right"):--

FRITZ'S APOLOGIA.

  Yes, war is horrible and hideous--
  It jars upon my sense fastidious,
  My "noble instincts," to decline
  To actions that are not divine.
  So, when I mutilate your pictures,
  So far from meriting your strictures,
  Compassion rather is my due
  For doing what I hate to do.
  It grieves my super-saintly soul
  Even to smash a china bowl;
  To carry off expensive clocks
  My tender conscience sears and shocks;
  I really don't enjoy at all
  Hacking to bits a panelled hall,
  Rare books with priceless bindings burning,
  Or boudoirs into cesspools turning.
  My heart invariably bleeds
  When I'm engaged upon these deeds,
  And teardrops of the largest size
  Fall from my heav'n-aspiring eyes.
  But, though my sorrow is unfeigned,
  Still discipline must be maintained;
  And, when the High Command says, "Smash,
  Bedaub with filth, loot, hack and slash,"
  I do it (much against the grain)
  Because, though gentle and humane,
  When dirty work is to be done
  I always am a docile Hun.

 "Sensationing.                          Dramatic.
               MARINKA'S HEART.
  Great drama, in 3 parts, of a poignancy interest,

ADMIRAL DUGOUT.

  He had done with fleets and squadrons, with the restless roaming seas,
    He had found the quiet haven he desired,
  And he lay there to his moorings with the dignity and ease
    Most becoming to Rear-Admirals (retired);
  He was bred on "Spit and Polish"--he was reared to "Stick and String"--
    All the things the ultra-moderns never name;
  But a storm blew up to seaward, and it meant the Real Thing,
    And he had to slip his cable when it came.

  So he hied him up to London for to hang about Whitehall,
    And he sat upon the steps there soon and late,
  He importuned night and morning, he bombarded great and small,
    From messengers to Ministers of State;
  He was like a guilty conscience, he was like a ghost unlaid,
    He was like a debt of which you can't get rid,
  Till the Powers that Be, despairing, in a fit of temper said,
    "For the Lord's sake give him something"--and they did.

  They commissioned him a trawler with a high and raking bow,
    Black and workmanlike as any pirate craft,
  With a crew of steady seamen very handy in a row,
    And a brace of little barkers fore and aft;
  And he blessed the Lord his Maker when he faced the North Sea sprays
    And exceedingly extolled his lucky star
  That had given his youth renewal in the evening of his days
    (With the rank of Captain Dugout, R.N.R.).

  He is jolly as a sandboy, he is happier than a king,
    And his trawler is the darling of his heart
  (With her cuddy like a cupboard where a kitten couldn't swing,
    And a smell of fish that simply won't depart);
  He has found upon occasion sundry targets for his guns;
    He could tell you tales of mine and submarine;
  Oh, the holes he's in and out of and the glorious risks he runs
    Turn his son--who's in a Super-Dreadnought--green.

  He is fit as any fiddle; he is hearty, hale and tanned;
    He is proof against the coldest gales that blow;
  He has never felt so lively since he got his first command
    (Which is rather more than forty years ago);
  And of all the joyful picnics of his wild and wandering youth--
    Little dust-ups from Taku to Zanzibar--
  There was none to match the picnic, he declares in sober sooth,
    That he has as Captain Dugout, R.N.R.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

Monday, March 26th.--Major PRETYMAN NEWMAN has a bright sense of humour much appreciated by
his fellow-countrymen from Ireland. His latest notion is that journals "of a comic and serio-comic
nature" should be deprived of their stocks of paper in order that catalogues and circulars
should continue to appear. Mr. GEORGE ROBERTS expressed his regret at being unable to discriminate
between different classes of publications; but I understand that several Members have offered
to satisfy Major NEWMAN's taste for light literature by lending him their old Stores catalogues.

Housewives who have been economising in their meagre supply of sugar in order to have a stock
for jam-making have been alarmed by a rumour that they would be charged with food-hoarding
and made to disgorge their savings. There is not a word of truth in it, and they may rest assured,
on Capt. BATHURST'S authority, that our non-party Government entirely approves this form of
Conservatism.

Misled by Mr. BRACE's appearance--I have before now noted his likeness to an amiable cat--Mr.
SNOWDEN pressed his advocacy of a certain conscientious objector called PETT to such lengths
as to discover that even this kind of cat has claws. "These conscientious objectors," said
Mr. BRACE at last, "are not the angels he thinks they are, and it is only with the utmost difficulty
that a large number of them will do anything like reasonable work." Thus a PETT illusion has
been shattered. Mr. SNOWDEN, however, has plenty more.

Tuesday, March 27th.--If British artisans, as at Barrow-in-Furness, prefer to strike for Germany,
it seems hardly reasonable to expect German prisoners to work for England. The nature of the
"disciplinary measures" which caused the Germans promptly to return to work on normal conditions
was not disclosed, but it seems a pity that they are not tried in the other case.

"We are getting on," as Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN said on a famous occasion. Formerly it
was considered the height of Parliamentary impropriety to say in so many words that an Hon.
Member was not telling the truth; and all sorts of more or less transparent subterfuges, of
which Mr. CHURCHILL's "terminological inexactitude" is the best remembered, were employed to
evade this breach of good manners. But the present House is thicker-skinned than its predecessors,
and heard without a tremor the following conversation between the MINISTER OF PENSIONS and
Mr. HOGGE:-- Mr. Barnes: "I never said there was a scale." Mr. Hogge: "Yes, you did." Mr. Barnes:
"No, I didn't."

A little later on, Mr. SWIFT MACNEILL always a stickler for constitutional precedent, attacked
the Government for introducing important Bills--including one for extending once more the life
of this immortal Parliament--without vouchsafing any explanation of them. He appealed to the
SPEAKER to condemn this procedure as being contrary to the spirit of the standing order. Mr.
LOWTHER explained that it was his business to carry out the rules of the House, not to express
opinions about the use that was made of them. But he ventured to remind the Hon. Member that
under this rule a Home Rule Bill, a Welsh Disestablishment Bill and a Plural Voting Bill had
all been introduced on a single day. And it is not on record that on that occasion Mr. MACNEILL
entered any protest.

Wednesday, March 28th--Rumours that Mr. ASQUITH was about to make a public recantation of his
hostility to Women's Suffrage caused a large attendance of Members, Peers and the general public.
The interval of waiting was beguiled by, among others, Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING, who, having been
told by Mr. MACPHERSON that the number of accidents during the training of pilots during the
last half-year of 1916 was 1.53 per cent., proceeded to inquire, "What is the percentage based
on? Is it percentage per hundred?" Mr. BILLING may be comforted by the recollection that a
greater than he, Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, confessed that he "never could understand what those
d--d dots meant."

The Editor of The Glasgow High School Magazine must be a proud man this day, for he has been
mentioned in Parliament. It seems that he has been refused permission to post his periodical
to subscribers in neutral countries, and Mr. MACPHERSON explained that this was in pursuance
of a general rule, since "school magazines contain much information useful to the enemy." It
is pleasant to picture the German General Staff laboriously ploughing through reports of football-matches,
juvenile poems and letters to the Editor complaining of the rise in prices at the tuck-shop,
in order to discover that Second-Lieutenant Blank, of the Umptieth Battery, R.F.A., is stationed
in Mesopotamia, and therefrom to deduce the present distribution of the British Army.

The SPEAKER occupied the Chair during the discussion of the recommendations of his Conference
on Electoral Reform, and heard nothing but good of himself. It was, indeed, a notable achievement
to have induced so heterogeneous a collection of Members to present a practically unanimous
report on a bundle of problems acutely controversial.

Only on one point did the Conference fail to agree, and that was in regard to Women's Suffrage.
But, after Mr. ASQUITH'S handsome admission that, by their splendid services in the War, women
had worked out their own electoral salvation, even that topic seemed to have lost most of its
provocative quality; and there is a general desire to forget what the late PRIME MINISTER described
as a detestable campaign and bury the hatchet and all the other weapons employed in it.

Do you recall the distraught lady in Ruddigore, who was always charmed into silence by the
mystic word "Basingstoke"? More than once during Mr. CLAVELL SALTER'S over-elaborated speech
I hoped that he would remember his constituency and take the hint. But he went on and on, occasionally
dropping into a vein of sentiment and working it so hard that I quite expected to hear him
say, "Gentlemen of the Jury" instead of "Mr. Speaker." When it came to the division, however,
he only carried some three-score stalwarts into the Lobby, and the House decided by a majority
of 279 to support the Government's intention to give immediate effect to the recommendations
of the Conference.

Thursday, March 29th.--Employers in want of agricultural labourers should apply to Lord NEWTON,
who has a large selection of interned Austrians, Hungarians and Turks, and undertakes to supply
an alien "almost by return of post." The Turk is specially recommended, as, even if he fails
to give complete satisfaction, the farmer can relieve the monotony of an arduous existence
by "sitting on the Ottoman."

Brave man as he is, the FOOD CONTROLLER is not prepared to prohibit entirely the manufacture
of cakes and confectionery. But he is preparing to do something hardly less daring, namely,
to standardize the types that may be sold.

The unwillingness of some young Scottish Members to volunteer for National Service is now explained.
It seems that by an unpardonable oversight the appeals of the DIRECTOR-GENERAL, as published
in the Scottish newspapers, were addressed "to the men of England." The wording has now been
altered-- not too late, I trust, for the country to obtain the valuable assistance of Messrs.
PRINGLE and HOGGE.

HERBS OF GRACE.

LAVENDER.

    Grey walls that lichen stains,
    That take the sun and the rains,
      Old, stately and wise;
    Clipt yews, old lawns flag-bordered,
    In ancient ways yet ordered;
      South walks where the loud bee plies
      Daylong till Summer flies;--
  Here grows Lavender, here breathes England.

    Gay cottage gardens, glad,
    Comely, unkempt and mad,
      Jumbled, jolly and quaint;
    Nooks where some old man dozes;
    Currants and beans and roses
      Mingling without restraint;
      A wicket that long lacks paint;--
  Here grows Lavender, here breathes England.

    Sprawling for elbow-room,
    Spearing straight spikes of bloom,
      Clean, wayward and tough;
    Sweet and tall and slender,
    True, enduring and tender,
      Buoyant and bold and bluff,
      Simplest, sanest of stuff;--
  Thus grows Lavender, thence breathes England.

CO-OPERATIVE ADVERTISEMENTS.

In view of the restriction of the paper supply it has been suggested that advertisers should
unite in cultivating the available space on a co-operative intensive system.

For example, the various proprietors of three popular brands of cigarettes, instead of having
a page advertisement each, might combine in one single page, like this:--

                   THREE OF THE BEST.

     You cannot consider yourself a connoisseur of
    cigarettes unless you are able to distinguish at
    one and the same time the individually exquisite
    flavours of
                    "THE BRASS HAT"
                    "THE OFFENSIVE."
                    "THE GAS ATTACK."

            THERE IS NO OTHER PERFECT BLEND.

         These cigarettes are smoked in our patent
                "Trident" cigarette-holders.

                   Of all Tobacconists.

You see? Not only does each manufacturer still obtain the same sale for his cigarettes, but
he actually gains a third share in the profits of a new accessory--the triple cigarette-holder.

Of course ingenuity of this sort is not required when the advertisers are not in any sense
rivals. All that is then necessary is what we may call the economic common factor of appeal.
For instance:--

         ARE YOU ON OUR WAITING LIST?

       The War Office | The Cricklewood
            Car.      |   Crematorium.

    As soon as we are through with our urgent
    contracts we shall be happy to serve you.
