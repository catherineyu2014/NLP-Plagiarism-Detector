Preface =======

Many books have been written on Storage Batteries used in stationary work, as in electric power
stations. The storage battery, as used on the modern gasoline car, however, is subjected to
service which is radically different from that of the battery in stationary work. It is true
that the chemical actions are the same in all lead-acid storage batteries, but the design,
construction, and operation of the starting and lighting battery, the radio battery, and the
farm lighting battery are unique, and require a special description.

This book therefore refers only to the lead-acid type of starting and lighting battery used
on the modern gasoline Automobile, the batteries used with Radio sets, and the batteries used
with Farm Lighting Plants. It is divided into two sections. The first section covers the theory,
design, operating conditions, and care of the battery.

The second section will be especially valuable to the battery repairman. All the instructions
given have been in actual use for years, and represent the accumulated experiences of the most
up-to-date battery repair shops in the United States.

The first edition of this book met with a most pleasing reception from both repairmen and battery
manufacturers. It was written to fill the need for a complete treatise on the Automobile Storage
Battery for the use of battery repairmen. The rapid sale of the book, and the letters of appreciation
from those who read it, proved that such a need existed.

The automobile battery business is a growing one, and one in which new designs and processes
are continually developed, and in preparing the second and third editions, this has been kept
in mind. Some of the chapters have been entirely rewritten, and new chapters have been added
to bring the text up-to-date. Old methods have been discarded, and new ones described. A section
on Farm lighting Batteries has been added, as the automobile battery man should familiarize
himself with such batteries, and be able to repair them. A section on Radio batteries has also
been added.

Special thanks are due those who offered their cooperation in the preparation and revision
of the book. Mr. George M. Howard of the Electric Storage Battery Co., and Mr. C. L. Merrill
of the U. S. Light & Heat Corporation very kindly gave many helpful suggestions. They also
prepared special articles which have been incorporated in the book. Mr. Henry E. Peers consulted
with the author and gave much valuable assistance. Mr. Lawrence Pearson of the Philadelphia
Battery Co., Mr. F. S. Armstrong of the Vesta Accumulator Co., Messrs. P. L. Rittenhouse, E.
C. Hicks and W. C. Brooks of the Prest-O-Lite Co., Mr. D. M. Simpson of the General Lead Batteries
Co., Mr. R. D. Mowray and Mr. C. R. Story of the Universal Battery Co., Mr. H. A. Harvey of
the U. S. Light and Heat Corporation, Mr. E. B. Welsh of the Westinghouse Union Battery Co.,
Mr. S. E. Baldwin of the Willard Storage Battery Co., Mr. H. H. Ketcham of the United Y. M.
C. A. Schools, and Messrs. Guttenberger and Steger of the American Eveready Works also rendered
much valuable assistance.

The Chapter on Business Methods was prepared by Mr. G. W. Hafner.
