Quite in the modern spirit is the beautiful lunette which John Sargent placed in the Boston
Library, above his well known frieze of "The Prophets." It represents "Jehovah confounding
the gods of the nations." The naked figure of suppliant Israel stands before an altar of unhewn
stones, on which burns the sacrifice. The smoke ascends to Heaven. On one side stands the mighty
figure of Assyria with uplifted mace ready to strike its awful blow upon the shoulders of helpless
Israel. On the other side the lithe, subtle form of Egypt, clasping the knout, watches its
chance to bring its treacherous thong upon the helpless shoulders of suffering Israel. But
Jehovah may not appear, man may not look on God and live. Jehovah is seen as a glory behind
the cloud of smoke shrouded by winged cherubim. From one side of the cloud comes a mighty hand
meeting with power the force of Assyria. From the other side, a lithe and sinewy hand thwarts
the subtlety of Egypt. But Jehovah is behind the cloud.

Again we understand that we are made in the image of our Maker. Again we understand the power
of the uplift of this idea. From the conflict it has emerged in new and glorified form. Hath
a God eyes that he may see? Hath a God ears that he may hear? Hath a God hands that he may
work? These we know to be but human forms of speaking. Eyes, ears, and hands we may owe to
the brute from whom we have sprung; in our eyes and ears and hands we show the relationship
we bear to them. These are not the image of God. God is a deeper, a finer, a nobler something
than hands, than ears and eyes. The image of God lies within ourselves: the image of God is
that which makes us what we are. In every noble purpose, in every earnest endeavor to uplift
ourselves or our fellowman, in every thought that turns us from the evil of a repented past,
in every desire with which our hearts yearn to strengthen, support and sustain our friends
and even our enemies, shines forth the image of Almighty God. This it is that links us with
the Eternal: this it is that makes it worth while that we should be Eternal. Besides this what
are hands and ears and eyes? We are made, all in us that is noblest and highest, in the image
of our Maker.

A word in closing. The time is ripe for a broader conception of theology and of science on
the part of those who are not trained to be specialists in either. We are becoming more and
more inherently religious. We are becoming more and more enamored of the truth in all its forms.
The times are ripe for us to cease the struggle and to strive for peace. So long as men insist
that the important things in faith are the things on which men differ there will be eternal
strife. So soon as men endeavor to find the common ground between them and each tries to state
his belief in forms acceptable to himself but involving no hostility to his neighbor, we shall
be working for peace.

Some of our finest men of to-day are being trained in modern science and in modern theology.
There is no scorn in their minds for early science or for early theology. Each served its age,
and each taught its truth. But its truth must be restated in terms of to-day. The old creeds
will always be loved. The old creeds will always hold our reverence and allegiance. But each
age must be at liberty to interpret these creeds in the terms in which that age best understands
truth. Each age must be at liberty "to restate the doctrines of the past in accordance with
the newness of the age and with the ancient verity of truth." How feeble my own attempt is
in this matter, I quite understand; I am still a child of the struggle. It has all come in
my lifetime and I have seen and felt not a little of the bitterness of it. I believe the time
is ripe for a definite peace. I believe our children, if we do not hamper them, will never
know the struggle we have had. In every great institution throughout this broad land men of
earnest mind and noble soul are teaching the truth as God gives it to them to know the truth.
Let us not hesitate to entrust our children to their hands. To us they may seem to be teachers
of discord but they are not speaking in terms that we understand. They are using the language
of a new age. Underneath their teaching lies the everlasting truth. Out of their teaching will
come everlasting life. Let us trust God in the world. Let us believe that in this age he is
teaching men's lips and dwelling in men's hearts. Only so can we give to our children the best
their times can give them. If we insist in holding these men back to our conception we but
deny them the privilege of moving with God's great procession. We make them laggards when they
should be in the front ranks, their faces lighted by a nearer and clearer vision of Almighty truth.
