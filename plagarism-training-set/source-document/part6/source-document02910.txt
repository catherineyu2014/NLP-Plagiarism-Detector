THE NAVIGATION OF THE ANTIPODES.[1]

One of the most striking, and perhaps the most intellectual advances of the age, is in the
progress of geographical discovery. It is honourable to England, that this new impulse to a
knowledge of the globe began with her spirit of enterprise, and it is still more honourable
to her that that spirit was originally prompted by benevolence. Cook, with whose voyages this
era may be regarded as originating, was almost a missionary of the benevolence of England,
and of George III.; and the example of both the great discoverer and the good king has been
so powerfully impressed on all the subsequent attempts of English adventurers, that there has
been scarcely a voyage to new regions which has not been expressly devised to carry with it
some benefit to their people.

When the spirit of discovery was thus once awakened, a succession of intelligent and daring
men were stimulated to the pursuit; and the memorable James Bruce, who had begun life as a
lawyer, grown weary of the profession, and turned traveller through the South of Europe at
a period when the man who ventured across the Pyrenees was a hero; gallantly fixed his eyes
on Africa, as a region of wonders, of which Europe had no other knowledge than as a land of
lions, of men more savage than the lions, and of treasures of ivory and gold teeming and unexhausted
since the days of Solomon. The hope of solving the old classic problem, the source of the Nile,
pointed his steps to Abyssinia, and after a six years' preparation in his consulate of Algiers,
he set forward on his dangerous journey, and arrived at the source of the Bahr-el-Azrek, (the
Blue River,) one of the branches of the great river. Unluckily he had been misdirected, for
the true Nile is the Bahr-el-Abiad, (the White River.)

His volumes, published in 1790, excited equal curiosity and censure; but the censure died away,
the curiosity survived, and a succession of travellers, chiefly sustained by the African Association,
penetrated by various routes into Africa.

The discovery of the course of the Niger was now the great object. And Mungo Park, a bold and
intelligent discoverer, gave a strong excitement to the public feeling by his "Travels," published
towards the close of the century. His adventures were told in a strain of good sense and simplicity
which fully gratified the public taste. And on his unfortunate death, which happened in a second
exploration of the Niger in 1805, another expedition was fitted out under Captain Tuckey, an
experienced seaman, to ascertain the presumed identity of the Congo with the Niger. But the
sea-coast of Africa is deadly to Europeans, and this effort failed through general disease.

The next experiment was made by land--from Tripoli across the Great Desert--under Denham, Clapperton,
and Oudney. This effort was partially baffled by sickness, but still more by the arts of the
native chiefs, who are singularly jealous of strangers. In a second attempt Clapperton, the
only survivor of the former, died.
