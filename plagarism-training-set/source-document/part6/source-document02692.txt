            p{nr+m}             a1   a2             ar
  Let un = --------; then un = --   --         ------------, leading
            q{nr+m}             b1 + b2 + ... + br + u{n1}

to an equation of the form Au{n}u{n-1} + Bun + Cu{n-1} + D = 0, where A, B, C, D are independent
of n, which is readily solved.

2. The Convergence of Infinite Continued Fractions.--We have seen that the simple infinite
continued fraction converges. The infinite general continued fraction of the first class cannot
diverge for its value lies between that of its first two convergents. It may, however, oscillate.
We have the relation p{n}q{n-1} - p{n-1}qn = (-1)^{n}b2b3...bn,

             pn   p{n-1}          b2b3 ... bn
  from which --- - ------- = (-1)^n ------------, and the limit of the
             qn   q{n-1}          q{n}q{n-1}

right-hand side is not necessarily zero.

The tests for convergency are as follows:

Let the continued fraction of the first class be reduced to the form

        1    1    1
  d1  + --   --   --      , then it is convergent if at least one of the
        d2 + d3 + d4 + ...

series d3 + d5 + d7 + ..., d2 + d4 + d6 + ... diverges, and oscillates if both these series
converge.

For the convergence of the continued fraction of the second class there is no complete criterion.
The following theorem covers a large number of important cases.

"If in the infinite continued fraction of the second class an [>=] bn + 1 for all values of
n, it converges to a finite limit not greater than unity."

3. The Incommensurability of Infinite Continued Fractions.--There is no general test for the
incommensurability of the general infinite continued fraction.

Two cases have been given by Legendre as follows:--

If a2, a3, ..., an, b2, b3, ...,bn are all positive integers, then

                                     b2   b3         b{n}
  I. The infinite continued fraction --   --         -----       converges
                                     a2 + a3 + ... + a{n} + ...

to an incommensurable limit if after some finite value of n the condition a{n} [not <] b{n}
is always satisfied.

                                      b2   b3         b{n}
  II. The infinite continued fraction --   --         -----
                                      a2 - a3 - ... - a{n} - ...

converges to an incommensurable limit if after some finite value of n the condition a{n} [>=]
b{n} + 1 is always satisfied, where the sign > need not always occur but must occur infinitely
often.

Continuants.

The functions p{n} and q{n}, regarded as functions of a1, ..., a{n}, b2, ..., b{n} determined
by the relations

  p{n} = a{n}p{n-1} + b{n}p{n-2},
  q{n} = a{n}q{n-1} + b{n}q{n-2},

with the conditions p1 = a1, p0 = 1; q2 = a2, q1 = 1, q0 = 0, have been studied under the name
of continuants. The notation adopted is

             /    b2,...,b{n}\
  p{n} = K (                  ),
             \a1, a2,...,a{n}/

and it is evident that we have

             /    b3,...,b{n}\
  q{n} = K (                  ).
             \a2, a3,...,a{n}/

The theory of continuants is due in the first place to Euler. The reader will find the theory
completely treated in Chrystal's Algebra, where will be found the exhibition of a prime number
of the form 4p + 1 as the actual sum of two squares by means of continuants, a result given
by H. J. S. Smith.

The continuant

     /    b2, b3, ..., b{n}\
  K (                        ) is also equal to the determinant
     \a1, a2, a3, ..., a{n}/

is also equal to the determinant

  | a1  b2  0   0   .   .   .        0     |
  | -1  a2  b3  0   .   .   .        0     |
  | 0   -1  a3  b4  .   .   .        0     |
  | 0   0   -1  a4  b5  .   .        --    |
  |                                        |
  |                 u   -1  a{n-1}  b{n} |
  | 0   0   --  --  0   0   -1       a{n} |,

from which point of view continuants have been treated by W. Spottiswoode, J. J. Sylvester
and T. Muir. Most of the theorems concerning continued fractions can be thus proved simply
from the properties of determinants (see T. Muir's Theory of Determinants, chap. iii.).

Perhaps the earliest appearance in analysis of a continuant in its determinant form occurs
in Lagrange's investigation of the vibrations of a stretched string (see Lord Rayleigh, Theory
of Sound, vol. i. chap. iv.).

The Conversion of Series and Products into Continued Fractions.

1. A continued fraction may always be found whose n^{th} convergent shall be equal to the sum
to n terms of a given series or the product to n factors of a given continued product. In fact,
a continued fraction

  b1   b2         b{n}
  --   --         -----        can be constructed having for the
  a1 + a2 + ... + a{n} + ...

numerators of its successive convergents any assigned quantities p1, p2, p3, ..., p{n}, and
for their denominators any assigned quantities q1, q2, q3, ..., q{n} ...

The partial fraction b{n}/a{n} corresponding to the n^{th} convergent can be found from the
relations

  pn = a{n}p{n-1} + b{n}p{n-2}, qn = a{n}q{n-1} + b{n}q{n-2};

and the first two partial quotients are given by

  b1 = p1,  a1 = q1,  b1a2 = p2,  a1a2 + b2 = q2.

If we form then the continued fraction in which p1, p2, p3, ..., p{n} are u1, u1 + u2, u1 +
u2 + u3, ..., u1 + u2 + ..., u{n}, and q1, q2, q3, ..., q{n} are all unity, we find the series
u1 + u2 + ..., u{n} equivalent to the continued fraction

  u1    u2/u1    u3/u2         un/u{n-1}
  --   ------   ------         ----------
  1  -     u2       u3              u{n}
       1 + -- - 1 + -- - ... - 1 + -------
           u1       u2             u{n-1}

which we can transform into

  u1      u2       u1u3      u2u4            u{n-2}u{n}
  --   -------   -------   -------         ---------------,
  1  - u1 + u2 - u2 + u3 - u3 + u4 - ... - u{n-1} + u{n}

a result given by Euler.

2. In this case the sum to n terms of the series is equal to the n^{th} convergent of the fraction.
There is, however, a different way in which a Series may be represented by a continued fraction.
We may require to represent the infinite convergent power series a0 + a1x + a2x² + ... by an
infinite continued fraction of the form

  [beta]0   [beta]1 x   [beta]2 x   [beta]3 x
  -------   ---------   ---------   ---------
     1    -     1     -     1     -     1     - ...

Here the fraction converges to the sum to infinity of the series. Its n^{th} convergent is
not equal to the sum to n terms of the series. Expressions for [beta]0, [beta]1, [beta]2, ...
by means of determinants have been given by T. Muir (Edinburgh Transactions, vol. xxvii.).

A method was given by J. H. Lambert for expressing as a continued fraction of the preceding
type the quotient of two convergent power series. It is practically identical with that of
finding the greatest common measure of two polynomials. As an instance leading to results of
some importance consider the series

                      x                       x²
  F(n,x) = 1 + --------------- + -------------------------------- + ...
               ([gamma] + n)1!   ([gamma] + n)([gamma] + n + 1)2!

We have

                                         x
  F(n + 1,x) - F(n,x) =  - ------------------------------ F(n + 2,x),
                           ([gamma] + n)([gamma] + n + 1)

whence we obtain

  F(1,x)   1    x/[gamma]([gamma] + 1)   x/([gamma] + 1)([gamma] + 2)
  ------ = --   ----------------------   ----------------------------
  F(0,x)   1  +           1            +              1              + ...,

which may also be written

  [gamma]        x             x
  -------   -----------   -----------
  [gamma] + [gamma] + 1 + [gamma] + 2 + ...

By putting ± x²/4 for x in F(0,x) and F(1,x), and putting at the same time [gamma] = 1/2, we obtain

          x    x²   x²   x²                x    x²   x²   x²
  tan x = --   --   --   --       tanh x = --   --   --   --
          1  - 3  - 5  - 7  - ...          1  + 3  + 5  + 7  + ...

These results were given by Lambert, and used by him to prove that [pi] and [pi]² incommensurable,
and also any commensurable power of e.

Gauss in his famous memoir on the hypergeometric series

  F([alpha], [beta], [gamma], x) =

       [alpha]·[beta]    [alpha]([alpha] + 1)[beta]([beta] + 1)
       --------------x + -------------------------------------- x² + ...
         1.[gamma]             1.2.[gamma]·([gamma] + 1)

gave the expression for F([alpha], [beta] + 1, [gamma] + 1, x) ÷ F([alpha], [beta], [gamma],
x) as a continued fraction, from which if we put [beta] = 0 and write [gamma] - 1 for [gamma],
we get the transformation

      [alpha]    [alpha]([alpha] + 1)
  1 + -------x + --------------------x² +
      [gamma]    [gamma]([gamma] + 1)

      [alpha]([alpha] + 1)([alpha] + 2)
      ---------------------------------x³ + ... =
      [gamma]([gamma] + 1)([gamma] + 2)

      1   [beta]1 x  [beta]2 x
      --  ---------  ---------        where
      1  -    1     -    1      - ...

            [alpha]               ([alpha] + 1)[gamma]
  [beta]1 = -------, [beta]3 = --------------------------, ...,
            [gamma]            ([gamma] + 1)([gamma] + 2)

                                   ([alpha] + n - 1)([gamma] + n - 2)
                 [beta]{2n-1}  = ------------------------------------,
                                  ([gamma] + 2n - 3)([gamma] + 2n - 2)

              [gamma] - [alpha]              2([gamma] + 1 - [alpha])
  [beta]2 = --------------------,  [beta]4 = --------------------------,
            [gamma]([gamma] + 1)             ([gamma] + 2)([gamma] + 3)

                                        n([gamma] + n - 1 - [alpha])
                 ..., [beta]{2n} = ------------------------------------. 4).

Ascending Continued Fractions.

There is another type of continued fraction called the ascending continued fraction, the type
so far discussed being called the descending continued fraction. It is of no interest or importance,
though both Lambert and Lagrange devoted some attention to it. The notation for this type of
fraction is

                      b5 +
                 b4 + ----
                       a5
            b3 + ---------
                    a4
       b2 + --------------
                  a3
  a1 + -------------------
               a2

It is obviously equal to the series

       b2    b3      b4        b5
  a1 + -- + ---- + ------ + -------- + ...
       a2   a2a3   a2a3a4   a2a3a4a5

Historical Note.

The invention of continued fractions is ascribed generally to Pietro Antonia Cataldi, an Italian
mathematician who died in 1626. He used them to represent square roots, but only for particular
numerical examples, and appears to have had no theory on the subject. A previous writer, Rafaello
Bombelli, had used them in his treatise on Algebra (about 1579), and it is quite possible that
Cataldi may have got his ideas from him. His chief advance on Bombelli was in his notation.
They next appear to have been used by Daniel Schwenter (1585-1636) in a Geometrica Practica
published in 1618. He uses them for approximations. The theory, however, starts with the publication
in 1655 by Lord Brouncker of the continued fraction

   1    1²  3²  5²
   --   --  --  --       as an equivalent of [pi]/4. This he is supposed
   1  + 2 + 2 + 2 + ...

to have deduced, no one knows how, from Wallis' formula for

               3 . 3 . 5 . 5 . 7 . 7 ...
  4/[pi], viz. -------------------------
               2 . 4 . 4 . 6 . 6 . 8 ...

John Wallis, discussing this fraction in his Arithmetica Infinitorum (1656), gives many of
the elementary properties of the convergents to the general continued fraction, including the
rule for their formation. Huygens (Descriptio automati planetarii, 1703) uses the simple continued
fraction for the purpose of approximation when designing the toothed wheels of his Planetarium.
Nicol Saunderson (1682-1739), Euler and Lambert helped in developing the theory, and much was
done by Lagrange in his additions to the French edition of Euler's Algebra (1795). Moritz A.
Stern wrote at length on the subject in Crelle's Journal (x., 1833; xi., 1834; xviii., 1838).
The theory of the convergence of continued fractions is due to Oscar Schlömilch, P. F. Arndt,
P. L. Seidel and Stern. O. Stolz, A. Pringsheim and E. B. van Vleck have written on the convergence
of infinite continued fractions with complex elements.

CONTOUR, CONTOUR-LINE (a French word meaning generally "outline," from the Med. Lat. contornare,
to round off), in physical geography a line drawn upon a map through all the points upon the
surface represented that are of equal height above sea-level. These points lie, therefore,
upon a horizontal plane at a given elevation passing through the land shown on the map, and
the contour-line is the intersection of that horizontal plane with the surface of the ground.
The contour-line of 0, or datum level, is the coastal boundary of any land form. If the sea
be imagined as rising 100 ft., a new coast-line, with bays and estuaries indented in the valleys,
would appear at the new sea-level. If the sea sank once more to its former level, the 100-ft.
contour-line with all its irregularities would be represented by the beach mark made by the
sea when 100 ft. higher. If instead of receding the sea rose continuously at the rate of 100
ft. per day, a series of levels 100 ft. above one another would be marked daily upon the land
until at last the highest mountain peaks appeared as islands less than 100 ft. high. A record
of this series of advances marked upon a flat map of the original country would give a series
of concentric contour-lines narrowing towards the mountain-tops, which they would at last completely
surround. Contour-lines of this character are marked upon most modern maps of small areas and
upon all government survey and military maps at varying intervals according to the scale of
the map.
