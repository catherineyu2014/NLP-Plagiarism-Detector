Under ordinary conditions the gas burns with a very smoky flame; in burners constructed so
as to secure a large amount of oxygen it burns with a very brilliant white light, and hence
is used as an illuminant.

~Laboratory preparation.~ The gas can be prepared readily in a generator such as is shown in
Fig. 60. The inner tube contains fragments of calcium carbide, while the outer one is filled
with water. As long as the stopcock is closed the water cannot rise in the inner tube. When
the stopcock is open the water rises, and, coming into contact with the carbide in the inner
tube, generates acetylene. This escapes through the stopcock, and after the air has been expelled
may be lighted as it issues from the burner.

Carbon forms two oxides, namely, carbon dioxide (CO{2}) and carbon monoxide (CO).

~Carbon dioxide~ (CO{2}). Carbon dioxide is present in the air to the extent of about 3 parts
in 10,000, and this apparently small amount is of fundamental importance in nature. In some
localities it escapes from the earth in great quantities, and many spring waters carry large
amounts of it in solution. When these highly charged spring waters reach the surface of the
earth, and the pressure on them is removed, the carbon dioxide escapes with effervescence.
It is a product of the oxidation of all organic matter, and is therefore formed in fires as
well as in the process of decay. It is thrown off from the lungs of all animals in respiration,
and is a product of many fermentation processes such as vinegar making and brewing. Combined
with metallic oxides it forms vast deposits of carbonates in nature.

~Preparation.~ In the laboratory carbon dioxide is always prepared by the action of an acid
upon a carbonate, usually calcium carbonate, the apparatus shown in Fig. 39 serving the purpose
very well. This reaction might be expected to produce carbonic acid, thus:

    CaCO{3} + 2HCl = CaCl{2} + H{2}CO{3}.

Carbonic acid is very unstable, however, and decomposes into its anhydride, CO{2}, and water, thus:

    H{2}CO{3} = H{2}O + CO{2}.

The complete reaction is represented by the equation

    CaCO{3} + 2HCl = CaCl{2} + CO{2} + H{2}O.

~Physical properties.~ Carbon dioxide is a colorless, practically odorless gas whose density
is 1.5. Its weight may be inferred from the fact that it can be siphoned, or poured like water,
from one vessel downward into another. At 15° and under ordinary pressure it dissolves in its
own volume of water and imparts a somewhat biting, pungent taste to it. It is easily condensed,
and is now prepared commercially in this form by pumping the gas into steel cylinders (see
Fig. 6) which are kept cold during the process. When the liquid is permitted to escape into
the air part of it instantly evaporates, and in so doing absorbs so much heat that another
portion is solidified, the solid form strikingly resembling snow in appearance. This snow is
very cold and mercury can easily be frozen with it.

~Solid carbon dioxide.~ Cylinders of liquid carbon dioxide are inexpensive, and should be available
in every school. To demonstrate the properties of solid carbon dioxide, the cylinder should
be placed across the table and supported in such a way that the stopcock end is several inches
lower than the other end. A loose bag is made by holding the corners of a handkerchief around
the neck of the stopcock, and the cock is then turned on so that the gas rushes out in large
quantities. Very quickly a considerable quantity of the snow collects in the handkerchief.
To freeze mercury, press a piece of filter paper into a small evaporating dish and pour the
mercury upon it. Coil a flat spiral upon the end of a wire, and dip the spiral into the mercury.
Place a quantity of solid carbon dioxide upon the mercury and pour 10 cc.-15 cc. of ether over
it. In a minute or two the mercury will solidify and may be removed from the dish by the wire
serving as a handle. The filter paper is to prevent the mercury from sticking to the dish;
the ether dissolves the solid carbon dioxide and promotes its rapid conversion into gas.

~Chemical properties.~ Carbon dioxide is incombustible, since it is, like water, a product
of combustion. It does not support combustion, as does nitrogen peroxide, because the oxygen
in it is held in very firm chemical union with the carbon. Very strong reducing agents, such
as highly heated carbon, can take away half of its oxygen:

    CO{2} + C = 2CO.

~Uses.~ The relation of carbon dioxide to plant life has been discussed in a previous chapter.
Water highly charged with carbon dioxide is used for making soda water and similar beverages.
Since it is a non-supporter of combustion and can be generated readily, carbon dioxide is also
used as a fire extinguisher. Some of the portable fire extinguishers are simply devices for
generating large amounts of the gas. It is not necessary that all the oxygen should be kept
away from the fire in order to smother it. A burning candle is extinguished in air which contains
only 2.5% of carbon dioxide.

~Carbonic acid~ (H{2}CO{3}). Like most of the oxides of the non-metallic elements, carbon dioxide
is an acid anhydride. It combines with water to form an acid of the formula H{2}CO{3}, called
carbonic acid:

    H{2}O + CO{2} = H{2}CO{3}.

The acid is, however, very unstable and cannot be isolated. Only a very small amount of it
is actually formed when carbon dioxide is passed into water, as is evident from the small solubility
of the gas. If, however, a base is present in the water, salts of carbonic acid are formed,
and these are quite stable:

    2NaOH + H{2}O + CO{2} = Na{2}CO{3} + 2H{2}O.

~Action of carbon dioxide on bases.~ This conduct is explained by the principles of reversible
reactions. The equation

    H{2}O +CO{2} <--> H{2}CO{3}

is a reversible equation, and the extent to which the reaction progresses depends upon the
relative concentrations of each of the three factors in it. Equilibrium is ordinarily reached
when very little H{2}CO{3} is formed. If a base is present in the water to combine with the
H{2}CO{3} as fast as it is formed, all of the CO{2} is converted into H{2}CO{3}, and thence
into a carbonate.

~Salts of carbonic acid,--carbonates.~ The carbonates form a very important class of salts.
They are found in large quantities in nature, and are often used in chemical processes. Only
the carbonates of sodium, potassium, and ammonium are soluble, and these can be made by the
action of carbon dioxide on solutions of the bases, as has just been explained.

The insoluble carbonates are formed as precipitates when soluble salts are treated with a solution
of a soluble carbonate. Thus the insoluble calcium carbonate can be made by bringing together
solutions of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate:

    CaCl{2} + Na{2}CO{3} = CaCO{3} + 2NaCl.

Most of the carbonates are decomposed by heat, yielding an oxide of the metal and carbon dioxide.
Thus lime (calcium oxide) is made by strongly heating calcium carbonate:

    CaCO{3} = CaO + CO{2}.

~Acid carbonates.~ Like all acids containing two acid hydrogen atoms, carbonic acid can form
both normal and acid salts. The acid carbonates are made by treating a normal carbonate with
an excess of carbonic acid. With few exceptions they are very unstable, heat decomposing them
even when in solution.

~Action of carbon dioxide on calcium hydroxide.~ If carbon dioxide is passed into clear lime
water, calcium carbonate is at first precipitated:

    H{2}O + CO{2} = H{2}CO{3},

    Ca(OH){2} + H{2}CO{3} = CaCO{3} + 2H{2}O.

Advantage is taken of this reaction in testing for the presence of carbon dioxide, as already
explained in the chapter on the atmosphere. If the current of carbon dioxide is continued,
the precipitate soon dissolves, because the excess of carbonic acid forms calcium acid carbonate
which is soluble:

    CaCO{3} + H{2}CO{3} = Ca(HCO{3}){2}.

If now the solution is heated, the acid carbonate is decomposed and calcium carbonate once
more precipitated:

    Ca(HCO{3}){2} = CaCO{3} + H{2}CO{3}.

~Carbon monoxide (CO).~ Carbon monoxide can be made in a number of ways, the most important
of which are the three following:

1. By the partial oxidation of carbon. If a slow current of air is conducted over highly heated
carbon, the monoxide is formed, thus:

    C + O = CO

It is therefore often formed in stoves when the air draught is insufficient. Water gas, which
contains large amounts of carbon monoxide, is made by partially oxidizing carbon with steam:

    C + H{2}O = CO + 2H.

2. By the partial reduction of carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide is conducted over highly
heated carbon it is reduced to carbon monoxide by the excess of carbon:

    CO{2} + C = 2CO.

When coal is burning in a stove or grate carbon dioxide is at first formed in the free supply
of air, but as the hot gas rises through the glowing coal it is reduced to carbon monoxide.
When the carbon monoxide reaches the free air above the coal it takes up oxygen to form carbon
dioxide, burning with the blue flame so familiar above a bed of coals, especially in the case
of hard coals.

3. By the decomposition of oxalic acid. In the laboratory carbon monoxide is usually prepared
by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid upon oxalic acid. The latter substance has the
formula C{2}H{2}O{4}. The sulphuric acid, owing to its affinity for water, decomposes the oxalic
acid, as represented in the equation

    C{2}H{2}O{4} + (H{2}SO{4}) = (H{2}SO{4}) + H{2}O + CO{2} + CO.

~Properties.~ Carbon monoxide is a light, colorless, almost odorless gas, very difficult to
liquefy. Chemically it is very active, combining directly with a great many substances. It
has a great affinity for oxygen and is therefore combustible and a good reducing agent. Thus,
if carbon monoxide is passed over hot copper oxide, the copper is reduced to the metallic state:

    CuO + CO = Cu + CO{2}.

When inhaled it combines with the red coloring matter of the blood and in this way prevents
the absorption of oxygen, so that even a small quantity of the gas may prove fatal.

     ~The reducing power of carbon monoxide.~ Fig. 61 illustrates a
     method of showing the reducing power of carbon monoxide. The
     gas is generated by gently heating 7 or 8 g. of oxalic acid
     with 25 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid in a 200 cc. flask
     A. The bottle B contains a solution of sodium hydroxide,
     which removes the carbon dioxide formed along with the
     monoxide. C contains a solution of calcium hydroxide to show
     that the carbon dioxide is completely removed. E is a
     hard-glass tube containing 1 or 2 g. of copper oxide, which is
     heated by a burner. The black copper oxide is reduced to
     reddish metallic copper by the carbon monoxide, which is
     thereby changed to carbon dioxide. The presence of the carbon
     dioxide is shown by the precipitate in the calcium hydroxide
     solution in D. Any unchanged carbon monoxide is collected
     over water in F.

~Carbon disulphide~ (CS{2}). Just as carbon combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, so
it combines with sulphur to form carbon disulphide (CS{2}). This compound has been described
in the chapter on sulphur.

~Hydrocyanic acid~ (prussic acid)(HCN). Under the proper conditions carbon unites with nitrogen
and hydrogen to form the acid HCN, called hydrocyanic acid. It is a weak, volatile acid, and
is therefore easily prepared by treating its salts with sulphuric acid:

    KCN + H{2}SO{4} = KHSO{4} + HCN.

It is most familiar as a gas, though it condenses to a colorless liquid boiling at 26°. It
has a peculiar odor, suggesting bitter almonds, and is extremely poisonous either when inhaled
or when taken into the stomach. A single drop may cause death. It dissolves readily in water,
its solution being commonly called prussic acid.

The salts of hydrocyanic acid are called cyanides, the cyanides of sodium and potassium being
the best known. These are white solids and are extremely poisonous.

~Solutions of potassium cyanide are alkaline.~ A solution of potassium cyanide turns red litmus
blue, and must therefore contain hydroxyl ions. The presence of these ions is accounted for
in the following way.

Although water is so little dissociated into its ions H^{+} and OH^{-} that for most purposes
we may neglect the dissociation, it is nevertheless measurably dissociated. Hydrocyanic acid
is one of the weakest of acids, and dissociates to an extremely slight extent. When a cyanide
such as potassium cyanide dissolves it freely dissociates, and the CN^{-} ions must come to
an equilibrium with the H^{+} ions derived from the water:

    H^{+} + CN^{-} <--> HCN.

The result of this equilibrium is that quite a number of H^{+} ions from the water are converted
into undissociated HCN molecules. But for every H^{+} ion so removed an OH^{-} ion remains
free, and this will give the solution alkaline properties.

CHAPTER XVIII

FLAMES,--ILLUMINANTS

~Conditions necessary for flames.~ It has been seen that when two substances unite chemically,
with the production of light and heat, the act of union is called combustion. When one of the
substances undergoing combustion remains solid at the temperature occasioned by the combustion,
light may be given off, but there is no flame. Thus iron wire burning in oxygen throws off
a shower of sparks and is brilliantly incandescent, but no flame is seen. When, however, both
of the substances are gases or vapors at the temperature reached in the combustion, the act
of union is accompanied by a flame.

~Flames from burning liquids or solids.~ Many substances which are liquids or solids at ordinary
temperatures burn with a flame because the heat of combustion vaporizes them slowly, and the
flame is due to the union of this vapor with the gas supporting the combustion.

~Supporter of combustion.~ That gas which surrounds the flame and constitutes the atmosphere
in which the combustion occurs is said to support the combustion. The other gas which issues
into this atmosphere is said to be the combustible gas. Thus, in the ordinary combustion of
coal gas in the air the coal gas is said to be combustible, while the air is regarded as the
supporter of combustion. These terms are entirely relative, however, for a jet of air issuing
into an atmosphere of coal gas will burn when ignited, the coal gas supporting the combustion.
Ordinarily, when we say that a gas is combustible we mean that it is combustible in an atmosphere
of air.

~Either gas may be the supporter of combustion.~ That the terms combustible and supporter of
combustion are merely relative may be shown in the following way: A lamp chimney A is fitted
with a cork and glass tubes, as shown in Fig. 62. The tube C should have a diameter of from
12 to 15 mm. A thin sheet of asbestos in which is cut a circular opening about 2 cm. in diameter
is placed over the top of the chimney. The opening in the asbestos is closed with the palm
of the hand, and gas is admitted to the chimney through the tube B. The air in the chimney
is soon expelled through the tube C, and the gas itself is then lighted at the lower end of
this tube. The hand is now removed from the opening in the asbestos, when the flame at the
end of the tube at once rises and appears at the end within the chimney, as shown in the figure.
The excess of coal gas now escapes from the opening in the asbestos and may be lighted. The
flame at the top of the asbestos board is due to the combustion of coal gas in air, while the
flame within the chimney is due to the combustion of air in coal gas, the air being drawn up
through the tube by the escaping gas.

~Appearance of flames.~ The flame caused by the union of hydrogen and oxygen is almost colorless
and invisible. Chlorine and hydrogen combine with a pale violet flame, carbon monoxide burns
in oxygen with a blue flame, while ammonia burns with a deep yellow flame. The color and appearance
of flames are therefore often quite characteristic of the particular combustion which occasions
them.

~Structure of flames.~ When the gas undergoing combustion issues from a round opening into
an atmosphere of the gas supporting combustion, as is the case with the burning Bunsen burner
(Fig. 63), the flame is generally conical in outline. It consists of several distinct cones,
one within the other, the boundary between them being marked by differences of color or luminosity.
In the simplest flame, of which hydrogen burning in oxygen is a good example, these cones are
two in number,--an inner one, formed by unburned gas, and an outer one, usually more or less
luminous, consisting of the combining gases. This outer one is in turn surrounded by a third
envelope of the products of combustion; this envelope is sometimes invisible, as in the present
case, but is sometimes faintly luminous. The lower part of the inner cone of the flame is quite
cool and consists of unburned gas. Toward the top of the inner cone the gas has become heated
to a high temperature by the burning envelope surrounding it. On reaching the supporter of
combustion on the outside it is far above its kindling temperature, and combustion follows
with the evolution of much heat. The region of combustion just outside the inner cone is therefore
the hottest part of the flame.

~Oxidizing and reducing flames.~ Since the tip of the outside cone consists of very hot products
of combustion mixed with oxygen from the air, a substance capable of oxidation placed in this
part of the flame becomes very hot and is easily oxidized. The oxygen with which it combines
comes, of course, from the atmosphere, and not from the products of combustion. This outer
tip of the flame is called the oxidizing flame.

At the tip of the inner cone the conditions are quite different. This region consists of a
highly heated combustible gas, which has not yet reached a supply of oxygen.

If a substance rich in oxygen, such as a metallic oxide, is placed in this region of the flame,
the heated gases combine with its oxygen and the substance is reduced. This part of the flame
is called the reducing flame. These flames are used in testing certain substances, especially
minerals. For this purpose they are produced by blowing into a small luminous Bunsen flame
from one side through a blowpipe. This is a tube of the shape shown in Fig. 64. The flame is
directed in any desired way and has the oxidizing and reducing regions very clearly marked
(Fig. 65). It is non-luminous from the same causes which render the open Bunsen burner flame
non-luminous, the gases from the lungs serving to furnish oxygen and to dilute the combustible gas.

~Luminosity of flames.~ The luminosity of flames is due to a number of distinct causes, and
may therefore be increased or diminished in several ways.

1. Presence of solid matter. The most obvious of these causes is the presence in the flame
of incandescent solid matter. Thus chalk dust sifted into a non-luminous flame renders it luminous.
When hydrocarbons form a part of the combustible gas, as they do in nearly all illuminating
gases and oils, some carbon is usually set free in the process of combustion. This is made
very hot by the flame and becomes incandescent, giving out light. In a well-regulated flame
it is afterward burned up, but when the supply of oxygen is insufficient it escapes from the
flame as lampblack or soot. That it is temporarily present in a well-burning luminous flame
may be demonstrated by holding a cold object, such as a small evaporating dish, in the flame
for a few seconds. This cold object cools the carbon below its kindling temperature, and it
is deposited on the object as soot.

2. Pressure. A second factor in the luminosity of flames is the pressure under which the gases
are burning. Under increased pressure there is more matter in a given volume of a gas, and
the chemical action is more energetic than when the gases are rarefied. Consequently there
is more heat and light. A candle burning on a high mountain gives less light than when it burns
at the sea level.

If the gas is diluted with a non-combustible gas, the effect is the same as if it is rarefied,
for under these conditions there is less combustible gas in a given volume.

3. Temperature. The luminosity also depends upon the temperature attained in the combustion.
In general the hotter the flame the greater the luminosity; hence cooling the gases before
combustion diminishes the luminosity of the flame they will make, because it diminishes the
temperature attained in the combustion. Thus the luminosity of the Bunsen flame is largely
diminished by the air drawn up with the gas. This is due in part to the fact that the burning
gas is diluted and cooled by the air drawn in. The oxygen thus introduced into the flame also
causes the combustion of the hot particles of carbon which would otherwise tend to make the
flame luminous.

~Illuminating and fuel gases.~ A number of mixtures of combustible gases, consisting largely
of carbon compounds and hydrogen, find extensive use for the production of light and heat.
The three chief varieties are coal gas, water gas, and natural gas. The use of acetylene gas
has already been referred to.

~Coal gas.~ Coal gas is made by heating bituminous coal in large retorts out of contact with
the air. Soft or bituminous coal contains, in addition to large amounts of carbon, considerable
quantities of compounds of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur. When distilled the nitrogen
is liberated partly in the form of ammonia and cyanides and partly as free nitrogen gas; the
sulphur is converted into hydrogen sulphide, carbon disulphide, and oxides of sulphur; the
oxygen into water and oxides of carbon. The remaining hydrogen is set free partly as hydrogen
and partly in combination with carbon in the form of hydrocarbons. The most important of these
is methane, with smaller quantities of many others, some of which are liquids or solids at
ordinary temperatures. The great bulk of the carbon remains behind as coke and retort carbon.

~The manufacture of coal gas.~ In the manufacture of coal gas it is necessary to separate from
the volatile constituents formed by the heating of the coal all those substances which are
either solid or liquid at ordinary temperature, since these would clog the gas pipes. Certain
gaseous constituents, such as hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, must also be removed. The method
used to accomplish this is shown in Fig. 66. The coal is heated in air-tight retorts illustrated
by A. The volatile products escape through the pipe X and bubble into the tarry liquid in the
large pipe B, known as the hydraulic main, which runs at right angles to the retorts. Here
is deposited the greater portion of the solid and liquid products, forming a tarry mass known
as coal tar. Much of the ammonia also remains dissolved in this liquid. The partially purified
gas then passes into the pipes C, which serve to cool it and further remove the solid and liquid
matter. The gas then passes into D, which is filled with coke over which a jet of water is
sprayed. The water still further cools the gas and at the same time partially removes such
gaseous products as hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, which are soluble in water. In E the gas
passes over some material such as lime, which removes the last portions of the sulphur compounds
as well as much of the carbon dioxide present. From E the gas passes into the large gas holder
F, from which it is distributed through pipes to the places where it is burned.

     One ton of good gas coal yields approximately 10,000 cu. ft. of
     gas, 1400 lb. of coke, 120 lb. of tar, and 20 gal. of
     ammoniacal liquor.

     Not only is the ammonia obtained in the manufacture of the gas
     of great importance, but the coal tar also serves as the source
     of many very useful substances, as will be explained in Chapter
     XXXII.

~Water gas.~ Water gas is essentially a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. It is made
by passing steam over very hot anthracite coal, when the reaction shown in the following equation
takes place:

    C + H{2}O = CO + 2H.

When required merely to produce heat the gas is at once ready for use. When made for illuminating
purposes it must be enriched, that is, illuminants must be added, since both carbon monoxide
and hydrogen burn with non-luminous flames. This is accomplished by passing it into heaters
containing highly heated petroleum oils. The gas takes up hydrocarbon gases formed in the decomposition
of the petroleum oils, which make it burn with a luminous flame.

Water gas is very effective as a fuel, since both carbon monoxide and hydrogen burn with very
hot flames. It has little odor and is very poisonous. Its use is therefore attended with some
risk, since leaks in pipes are very likely to escape notice.

~Natural gas.~ This substance, so abundant in many localities, varies much in composition,
but is composed principally of methane. When used for lighting purposes it is usually burned
in a burner resembling an open Bunsen, the illumination being furnished by an incandescent
mantle. This is the case in the familiar Welsbach burner. Contrary to statements frequently
made, natural gas contains no free hydrogen.

=====================+================+========+========+==========

     These are analyses of actual samples, and may be taken as about
     the average for the various kinds of gases. Any one of these
     may vary considerably. The nitrogen and oxygen in most cases is
     due to a slight admixture of air which is difficult to exclude
     entirely in the manufacture and handling of gases.

~Fuels.~ A variety of substances are used as fuels, the most important of them being wood,
coal, and the various gases mentioned above. Wood consists mainly of compounds of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen. The composition of coal and the fuel gases has been given. Since these fuels are
composed principally of carbon and hydrogen or their compounds, the chief products of combustion
are carbon dioxide and water. The practice of heating rooms with portable gas or oil stoves
with no provision for removing the products of combustion is to be condemned, since the carbon
dioxide is generated in sufficient quantities to render the air unfit for breathing. Rooms
so heated also become very damp from the large amount of water vapor formed in the combustion,
and which in cold weather condenses on the window glass, causing the glass to "sweat." Both
coal and wood contain a certain amount of mineral substances which constitute the ashes.

~The electric furnace.~ In recent years electric furnaces have come into wide use in operations
requiring a very high temperature. Temperatures as high as 3500° can be easily reached, whereas
the hottest oxyhydrogen flame is not much above 2000°. These furnaces are constructed on one
of two general principles.

1. Arc furnaces. In the one type the source of heat is an electric arc formed between carbon
electrodes separated a little from each other, as shown in Fig. 67. The substance to be heated
is placed in a vessel, usually a graphite crucible, just below the arc. The electrodes and
crucible are surrounded by materials which fuse with great difficulty, such as magnesium oxide,
the walls of the furnace being so shaped as to reflect the heat downwards upon the contents
of the crucible.

2. Resistance furnaces. In the other type of furnace the heat is generated by the resistance
offered to the current in its passage through the furnace. In its simplest form it may be represented
by Fig. 68. The furnace is merely a rectangular box built up of loose bricks. The electrodes
E, each consisting of a bundle of carbon rods, are introduced through the sides of the furnace.
The materials to be heated, C, are filled into the furnace up to the electrodes, and a layer
of broken coke is arranged so as to extend from one electrode to the other. More of the charge
is then placed on top of the coke. In passing through the broken coke the electrical current
encounters great resistance. This generates great heat, and the charge surrounding the coke
is brought to a very high temperature. The advantage of this type of furnace is that the temperature
can be regulated to any desired intensity.

CHAPTER XIX

MOLECULAR WEIGHTS, ATOMIC WEIGHTS, FORMULAS

~Introduction.~ In the chapter on The Atomic Theory, it was shown that if it were true that
two elements uniting to form a compound always combined in the ratio of one atom of one element
to one atom of the other element, it would be a very easy matter to decide upon figures which
would represent the relative weights of the different atoms. It would only be necessary to
select some one element as a standard and determine the weight of every element which combines
with a definite weight (say 1 g.) of the standard element. The figures so obtained would evidently
represent the relative weights of the atoms.

But the law of multiple proportion at once reminds us that two elements may unite in several
proportions; and there is no simple way to determine the number of atoms present in the molecule
of any compound. Consequently the problem of deciding upon the relative atomic weights is not
an easy one. To the solution of this problem we must now turn.

~Dalton's method of determining atomic weights.~ When Dalton first advanced the atomic theory
he attempted to solve this problem by very simple methods. He thought that when only one compound
of two elements is known it is reasonable to suppose that it contains one atom of each element.
He therefore gave the formula HO to water, and HN to ammonia. When more than two compounds
were known he assumed that the most familiar or the most stable one had the simple formula.
He then determined the atomic weight as explained above. The results he obtained were contradictory
and very far from satisfactory, and it was soon seen that some other method, resting on much
more scientific grounds, must be found to decide what compounds, if any, have a single atom
of each element present.

~Determination of atomic weights.~ Three distinct steps are involved in the determination of
the atomic weight of an element: (1) determination of the equivalent, (2) determination of
molecular weights of its compounds, and (3) deduction of the exact atomic weight from the equivalent
and molecular weights.

~1. Determination of the equivalent.~ By the equivalent of an element is meant the weight of
the element which will combine with a fixed weight of some other element chosen as a standard.
It has already been explained that oxygen has been selected as the standard element for atomic
weights, with a weight of 16. This same standard will serve very well as a standard for equivalents.
The equivalent of an element is the weight of the element which will combine with 16 g. of
oxygen. Thus 16 g. of oxygen combines with 16.03 g. of sulphur, 65.4 g. of zinc, 215.86 g.
of silver, 70.9 g. of chlorine. These figures, therefore, represent the equivalent weights
of these elements.

~Relation of atomic weights to equivalents.~ According to the atomic theory combination always
takes place between whole numbers of atoms. Thus one atom unites with one other, or with two
or three; or two atoms may unite with three, or three with five, and so on.

When oxygen combines with zinc the combination must be between definite numbers of the two
kinds of atoms. Experiment shows that these two elements combine in the ratio of 16 g. of oxygen
to 65.4 g. of zinc. If one atom of oxygen combines with one atom of zinc, then this ratio must
be the ratio between the weights of the two atoms. If one atom of oxygen combines with two
atoms of zinc, then the ratio between the weights of the two atoms will be 16: 32.7. If two
atoms of oxygen combine with one atom of zinc, the ratio by weight between the two atoms will
be 8: 65.4. It is evident, therefore, that the real atomic weight of an element must be some
multiple or submultiple of the equivalent; in other words, the equivalent multiplied by 1/2,
1, 2, or 3 will give the atomic weight.

~Combining weights.~ A very interesting relation holds good between the equivalents of the
various elements. We have just seen that the figures 16.03, 65.4, 215.86, and 70.9 are the
equivalents respectively of sulphur, zinc, silver, and chlorine. These same figures represent
the ratios by weight in which these elements combine among themselves. Thus 215.86 g. of silver
combine with 70.9 g. of chlorine and with 2 × 16.03 g. of sulphur. 65.4 g. of zinc combine
with 70.9 g. of chlorine and 2 × 16.03 g. of sulphur.

By taking the equivalent or some multiple of it a value can be obtained for each element which
will represent its combining value, and for this reason is called its combining weight. It
is important to notice that the fact that a combining weight can be obtained for each element
is not a part of a theory, but is the direct result of experiment.

~Elements with more than one equivalent.~ It will be remembered that oxygen combines with hydrogen
in two ratios. In one case 16 g. of oxygen combine with 2.016 g. of hydrogen to form water;
in the other 16 g. of oxygen combine with 1.008 g. of hydrogen to form hydrogen dioxide. The
equivalents of hydrogen are therefore 2.016 and 1.008. Barium combines with oxygen in two proportions:
in barium oxide the proportion is 16 g. of oxygen to 137.4 g. of barium; in barium dioxide
the proportion is 16 g. of oxygen to 68.7 g. of barium.

In each case one equivalent is a simple multiple of the other, so the fact that there may be
two equivalents does not add to the uncertainty. All we knew before was that the true atomic
weight is some multiple of the equivalent.

~2. The determination of molecular weights.~ To decide the question as to which multiple of
the equivalent correctly represents the atomic weight of an element, it has been found necessary
to devise a method of determining the molecular weights of compounds containing the element
in question. Since the molecular weight of a compound is merely the sum of the weights of all
the atoms present in it, it would seem to be impossible to determine the molecular weight of
a compound without first knowing the atomic weights of the constituent atoms, and how many
atoms of each element are present in the molecule. But certain facts have been discovered which
suggest a way in which this can be done.
