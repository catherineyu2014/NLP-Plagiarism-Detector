If the rod and the disc rotate in opposite directions, the phenomena are changed only in so
far as the changed geometrical relations require. For the ratio 1:3 between the two rates,
the strobic system has four bands of each color; for 1:2, three bands of each color; while
when the two rates are equal, there are two bands of each color, forming a diameter. As would
be expected from the geometrical conditions, a system of one band of each color cannot be generated
when rod and disc have opposite motions. For of course the rod cannot now hide two or more
times in succession a sector at any given point, without hiding the same sector just as often
at the opposite point, 180° away. Here, too, the cycle of strobic movements is different. It
is reversed. Let the disc be said to rotate forward, then if the rate of the rod is slightly
less than one fourth, etc., that of the disc, the system will rotate forward; if greater, it
will rotate backward. So that as the rate of the rod increases, any system on its appearance
will move forward, then stand still, and lastly rotate backward. The reason for this will be
seen from an instant's consideration of where the rod will hide a given sector.

It is clear that if, instead of using as 'rod' a single radial sector, one were to rotate two
or more such sectors disposed at equal angular intervals about the axis, one would have the
same strobic phenomena, although they would be more complicated. Indeed, a large number of
rather narrow sectors can be used or, what is the same thing, a second disc with a row of holes
at equal intervals about the circumference. The disc used by the writer had a radius of 11
inches, and a concentric ring of 64 holes, each 3/8 of an inch in diameter, lying 10 inches
from the center. The observer looks through these holes at the color-disc behind. The two discs
need not be placed concentrically.

When produced in this way, the strobic illusion is exceedingly pretty. Instead of straight,
radial bands, one sees a number of brightly colored balls lying within a curving band of the
other color and whirling backward or forward, or sometimes standing still. Then these break
up and another set forms, perhaps with the two colors changed about, and this then oscillates
one way or the other. A rainbow disc substituted for the disc of two sectors gives an indescribably
complicated and brilliant effect; but the front disc must rotate more slowly. This disc should
in any case be geared for high speeds and should be turned by hand for the sake of variations
in rate, and consequently in the strobic movement.

It has been seen that this stroboscope is not different in principle from the illusion of the
resolution-bands which this paper has aimed to explain. The resolution-bands depend wholly
on the purely geometrical relations between the rod and the disc, whereby as both move the
rod hides one sector after the other. The only physiological principles involved are the familiar
processes by which stimulations produce after-images, and by which the after-images of rapidly
succeeding stimulations are summed, a certain number at a time, into a characteristic effect.

Kirkpatrick,[1] in experimenting with 379 school children and college students, found that
3-1/3 times as many objects were recalled as visual words after an interval of three days.
The experiment consisted in showing successively 10 written names of common objects in the
one case and 10 objects in the other at the rate of one every two seconds. Three days later
the persons were asked to recall as many of each series as possible, putting all of one series
together. The averages thus obtained were 1.89 words, 6.29 objects. The children were not more
dependent on the objects than the college students.

Since the experiment just described was performed without laboratory facilities, Calkins[2]
repeated it with 50 college women, substituting lantern pictures for objects. She obtained
in recall, after two days, the averages 4.82 words, 7.45 pictures. The figures, however, are
the number of objects or words remembered out of ten, not necessarily correctly placed. Kirkpatrick's
corresponding figures for college women were 3.22 words, 5.44 objects. The two experiments
substantially agree, Calkins' higher averages being probably due to the shortening of the interval
to two days.

Assuming, thus, that objects are better remembered than names in deferred recall, the question
arises whether this holds true when the objects and names are coupled with strange and arbitrary
symbols--a question which is clearly of great practical interest from the educational point
of view, as it is involved in the pedagogical problem whether a person seeking to acquire the
vocabulary of a foreign language ought to connect the foreign words with the familiar words
or with the objects themselves. And the further question arises: what are the facts in the
case of movements instead of objects, and correspondingly in that of verbs instead of nouns.
Both questions are the problems of the following investigation.

As foreign symbols, either the two-figure numbers were used or nonsense-words of regularly
varying length. As familiar material, nouns, objects, verbs and movements were used. The words
were always concrete, not abstract, by which it is meant that their meaning was capable of
demonstration to the senses. With the exception of a few later specified series they were monosyllabic
words. The nouns might denote objects of any size perceptible to the eye; the objects, however,
were all of such a size that they could be shown through a 14×12 cm. aperture and still leave
a margin. Their size was therefore limited.

Concerning the verbs and movements it is evident that, while still being concrete, they might
be simple or complicated activities consuming little or much time, and further, might be movements
of parts of the body merely, or movements employing other objects as well. In this experiment
complicated activities were avoided even in the verb series. Simple activities which could
be easily and quickly imaged or made were better for the purpose in view.

THE A SET.

The A set contained sixteen series, A^{1}, A^{2}, A^{3}, etc., to A^{16}. They were divided
as follows:

   Numbers and nouns: A^{1}, A^{5}, A^{9}, A^{13}.
   Numbers and objects: A^{2}, A^{6}, A^{10}, A^{14}.
   Numbers and verbs: A^{3}, A^{7}, A^{11}, A^{15}.
   Numbers and movements: A^{4}, A^{8}, A^{12}, A^{16}.

The first week A^{1-4} were given, the second week A^{5-8}, etc., so that each week one series
of each of the four types was given the subject.

In place of foreign symbols the numbers from 1 to 99 were used, except in A^{13-15}, in which
three-figure numbers were used.

Each series contained seven couplets, except A^{13-16}, which, on account of the greater difficulty
of three-figure numbers, contained five. Each couplet was composed of a number and a noun,
object, verb, or movement.

Certain rules were observed in the composition of the series. Since the test was for permanence,
to avoid confusion no number was used in more than one couplet. No two numbers of a given series
were chosen from the same decade or contained identical final figures. No word was used in
more than one couplet. Their vowels, and initial and final consonants were so varied within
a single series as to eliminate phonetic aids, viz., alliteration, rhyme, and assonance. The
kind of assonance avoided was identity of final sounded consonants in successive words, e.g.,
lane, vine.
