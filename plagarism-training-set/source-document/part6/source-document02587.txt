    In a few days the alligator was quite at home. It would eat anything
    which was brought to it, and soon learned to come to a call, seeming
    more delighted with notice than with what there was to eat. It
    whined and barked like a dog, and wagged its big tail when pleased.
    It enjoyed being patted on the head, and would caper around, the
    most awkward thing that ever attempted a frolic.

    In a few months, the pet became so large and familiar as to be a
    nuisance. He would track up sister Lu through the field and about
    the garden, showing his scent to be true and keen. Often when Lu was
    seated, perhaps, at her tatting, he would come to her feet and lie
    as still as if carved out of stone, waiting for a little notice. He
    soon grew to like eating the young goslings and chickens, and began
    to climb the fence, and look longingly at the young pigs. At last
    the scaly, good-natured creature disappeared. He probably made his
    way to a neighboring bayou, and was never seen again by any little
    girl's eyes.

    But Lu has never forgotten him, although probably he remembers
    nothing now of the good times of his youth.--Yours truly,

    G.M.K.

THE WITCHERY OF ARCHERY. By Maurice Thompson. Published by Charles Scribner's Sons.

Archery has become so popular, of late, that this book will be of interest to all boys and
girls, as well as grown people, who practice shooting with bows and arrows. Mr. Thompson, the
author, wrote the articles on Archery in Scribner's Monthly, which have excited such an interest
in bow-shooting, and he probably knows more about the matter than any one else in the country.

There is much in the book about the various pleasures and advantages of archery, which are
very many; but there are also a great many plain and practical directions to those who are
unaccustomed to the use of a bow and arrows. The author tells the young archer just what to
do and how to do it, and, as no one should use a bow who does not know how to use it properly,
such directions are very valuable, and should be carefully read and followed.

CHARADE.

  Darker and darker still, the slow hours creeping,
    Bring to my first the inexorable gloom;
  Silent and soft, the tender skies are weeping
    For all the beauty they no more illume.

  Stay not. O wand'rer, by the hurrying river,
    Nor in the whispering wood, nor where above
  Rises the perilous crag. My second ever,
    With added final, welcomes all who rove.

  Wildly my third over the hill is flying,
    Over the wide moor, and the wider sea,
  Moaning as one whose latest hope, in dying,
    Leaves an eternity of agony.

  Listen! oh, listen! to my whole, while filling
    My shadowy first with ecstasy divine!
  Listen! oh, listen! would ye not be willing
    Ever in gloom to dwell, and not repine,--
  Ever to joy in such melodious gladness,--
  Ever to sorrow in such rapturous sadness?

PICTORIAL ANAGRAM PUZZLE.

The answer--a line from Young's "Night Thoughts"--contains six words.

Each numeral beneath the pictures represents a letter in that word of the line which is indicated
by the numeral--1 denoting that the letter it designates belongs to the first word of the line,
4 to the fourth word, and so on.

Find a word, letters, or a letter, descriptive of each picture, and containing as many letters
as there are numerals beneath the picture itself. This is the first process. Then write down,
some distance apart, the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, to correspond with the words of the answer.
Group beneath figure 1 all the letters designated by the numeral 1 in the numbering beneath
the pictures. You will thus have in a group all the letters that spell the first word of the
line, and these letters, when set in the right order, will spell the word itself. Follow the
same process of grouping and arranging, in making the remaining five words of the answer. Of
course, the re-arrangement of the letters need not be begun until all of them have been set
apart in their proper groups.

RIDDLE.

  A head have I, though never do I think;
  A mouth as well, but with it never drink.
  A body, too, is mine, of giant growth and strength,
  Combining with its force majestic length.
  But, as to feet, of them I have not one,
  Though I am never still, but always run.
  Ne'er was I known to leave my lowly bed,
  Or ope my mouth so that I might be fed.
