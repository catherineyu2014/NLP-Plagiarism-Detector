RIDDLE.

I am a little word of four letters, yet you will find in me a preposition, a negation, and
an exclamation. I am as old as the sun, and he could not possibly fulfill his daily course
without me. I am a rest to the weary laborer, and a delight to school-children, who greet me
with a shout of welcome. I aid in construction and consolation--indeed, they could not exist
without me; and although they break me to pieces, I am never in bad temper. Who can find me out?

PLAIN-SPEAKING.

BY MARGARET EYTINGE.

  A Mullingong met an Echidna one day,
    And he cried, "What a very odd nose!
  So exceedingly sharp. Why, it's funnier far
    Than your porcupine coat and your toes."
  Then most rudely he made all the echoes resound
  With "he-hees!" and "haw-haws!" and "ho-hoes!"
