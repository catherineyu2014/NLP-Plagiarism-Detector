It would be of general service to German authors if they discerned that while a man should,
if possible, think like a great mind, he should speak the same language as every other person.
Men should use common words to say uncommon things, but they do the reverse. We find them trying
to envelop trivial ideas in grand words and to dress their very ordinary thoughts in the most
extraordinary expressions and the most outlandish, artificial, and rarest phrases. Their sentences
perpetually stalk about on stilts. With regard to their delight in bombast, and to their writing
generally in a grand, puffed-up, unreal, hyperbolical, and acrobatic style, their prototype
is Pistol, who was once impatiently requested by Falstaff, his friend, to "say what you have
to say, like a man of this world!"[5]

There is no expression in the German language exactly corresponding to stile empes�; but the
thing itself is all the more prevalent. When combined with unnaturalness it is in works what
affected gravity, grandness, and unnaturalness are in social intercourse; and it is just as
intolerable. Poverty of intellect is fond of wearing this dress; just as stupid people in everyday
life are fond of assuming gravity and formality.

A man who writes in this prezi�s style is like a person who dresses himself up to avoid being
mistaken for or confounded with the mob; a danger which a gentleman, even in his worst clothes,
does not run. Hence just as a plebeian is recognised by a certain display in his dress and
his tir� � quatre �pingles, so is an ordinary writer recognised by his style.

If a man has something to say that is worth saying, he need not envelop it in affected expressions,
involved phrases, and enigmatical innuendoes; but he may rest assured that by expressing himself
in a simple, clear, and na�ve manner he will not fail to produce the right effect. A man who
makes use of such artifices as have been alluded to betrays his poverty of ideas, mind, and
knowledge.

Nevertheless, it is a mistake to attempt to write exactly as one speaks. Every style of writing
should bear a certain trace of relationship with the monumental style, which is, indeed, the
ancestor of all styles; so that to write as one speaks is just as faulty as to do the reverse,
that is to say, to try and speak as one writes. This makes the author pedantic, and at the
same time difficult to understand.

Obscurity and vagueness of expression are at all times and everywhere a very bad sign. In ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred they arise from vagueness of thought, which, in its turn, is almost
always fundamentally discordant, inconsistent, and therefore wrong. When a right thought springs
up in the mind it strives after clearness of expression, and it soon attains it, for clear
thought easily finds its appropriate expression. A man who is capable of thinking can express
himself at all times in clear, comprehensible, and unambiguous words. Those writers who construct
difficult, obscure, involved, and ambiguous phrases most certainly do not rightly know what
it is they wish to say: they have only a dull consciousness of it, which is still struggling
to put itself into thought; they also often wish to conceal from themselves and other people
that in reality they have nothing to say. Like Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, they wish to appear
to know what they do not know, to think what they do not think, and to say what they do not say.

Will a man, then, who has something real to impart endeavour to say it in a clear or an indistinct
way? Quintilian has already said, plerumque accidit ut faciliora sint ad intelligendum et lucidiora
multo, quae a doctissimo quoque dicuntur.... Erit ergo etiam obscurior, quo quisque deterior.

A man's way of expressing himself should not be enigmatical, but he should know whether he
has something to say or whether he has not. It is an uncertainty of expression which makes
German writers so dull. The only exceptional cases are those where a man wishes to express
something that is in some respect of an illicit nature. As anything that is far-fetched generally
produces the reverse of what the writer has aimed at, so do words serve to make thought comprehensible;
but only up to a certain point. If words are piled up beyond this point they make the thought
that is being communicated more and more obscure. To hit that point is the problem of style
and a matter of discernment; for every superfluous word prevents its purpose being carried
out. Voltaire means this when he says: l'adjectif est l'ennemi du substantif. (But, truly,
many authors try to hide their poverty of thought under a superfluity of words.)

Accordingly, all prolixity and all binding together of unmeaning observations that are not
worth reading should be avoided. A writer must be sparing with the reader's time, concentration,
and patience; in this way he makes him believe that what he has before him is worth his careful
reading, and will repay the trouble he has spent upon it. It is always better to leave out
something that is good than to write down something that is not worth saying. Hesiod's πλέον
ἡμισυ πάντος[6] finds its right application. In fact, not to say everything! Le secret pour
�tre ennuyeux, c'est de tout dire. Therefore, if possible, the quintessence only! the chief
matter only! nothing that the reader would think for himself. The use of many words in order
to express little thought is everywhere the infallible sign of mediocrity; while to clothe
much thought in a few words is the infallible sign of distinguished minds.

Truth that is naked is the most beautiful, and the simpler its expression the deeper is the
impression it makes; this is partly because it gets unobstructed hold of the hearer's mind
without his being distracted by secondary thoughts, and partly because he feels that here he
is not being corrupted or deceived by the arts of rhetoric, but that the whole effect is got
from the thing itself. For instance, what declamation on the emptiness of human existence could
be more impressive than Job's: Homo, natus de muliere, brevi vivit tempore, repletus multis
miseriis, qui, tanquam flos, egreditur et conteritur, et fugit velut umbra. It is for this
very reason that the na�ve poetry of Goethe is so incomparably greater than the rhetorical
of Schiller. This is also why many folk-songs have so great an effect upon us. An author should
guard against using all unnecessary rhetorical adornment, all useless amplification, and in
general, just as in architecture he should guard against an excess of decoration, all superfluity
of expression--in other words, he must aim at chastity of style. Everything that is redundant
has a harmful effect. The law of simplicity and na�vet� applies to all fine art, for it is
compatible with what is most sublime.

True brevity of expression consists in a man only saying what is worth saying, while avoiding
all diffuse explanations of things which every one can think out for himself; that is, it consists
in his correctly distinguishing between what is necessary and what is superfluous. On the other
hand, one should never sacrifice clearness, to say nothing of grammar, for the sake of being
brief. To impoverish the expression of a thought, or to obscure or spoil the meaning of a period
for the sake of using fewer words shows a lamentable want of judgment. And this is precisely
what that false brevity nowadays in vogue is trying to do, for writers not only leave out words
that are to the purpose, but even grammatical and logical essentials.[7]

Subjectivity, which is an error of style in German literature, is, through the deteriorated
condition of literature and neglect of old languages, becoming more common. By subjectivity
I mean when a writer thinks it sufficient for himself to know what he means and wants to say,
and it is left to the reader to discover what is meant. Without troubling himself about his
reader, he writes as if he were holding a monologue; whereas it should be a dialogue, and,
moreover, a dialogue in which he must express himself all the more clearly as the questions
of the reader cannot be heard. And it is for this very reason that style should not be subjective
but objective, and for it to be objective the words must be written in such a way as to directly
compel the reader to think precisely the same as the author thought. This will only be the
case when the author has borne in mind that thoughts, inasmuch as they follow the law of gravity,
pass more easily from head to paper than from paper to head. Therefore the journey from paper
to head must be helped by every means at his command. When he does this his words have a purely
objective effect, like that of a completed oil painting; while the subjective style is not
much more certain in its effect than spots on the wall, and it is only the man whose fantasy
is accidentally aroused by them that sees figures; other people only see blurs. The difference
referred to applies to every style of writing as a whole, and it is also often met with in
particular instances; for example, I read in a book that has just been published: I have not
written to increase the number of existing books. This means exactly the opposite of what the
writer had in view, and is nonsense into the bargain.

A man who writes carelessly at once proves that he himself puts no great value on his own thoughts.
For it is only by being convinced of the truth and importance of our thoughts that there arises
in us the inspiration necessary for the inexhaustible patience to discover the clearest, finest,
and most powerful expression for them; just as one puts holy relics or priceless works of art
in silvern or golden receptacles. It was for this reason that the old writers--whose thoughts,
expressed in their own words, have lasted for thousands of years and hence bear the honoured
title of classics--wrote with universal care. Plato, indeed, is said to have written the introduction
to his Republic seven times with different modifications. On the other hand, the Germans are
conspicuous above all other nations for neglect of style in writing, as they are for neglect
of dress, both kinds of slovenliness which have their source in the German national character.
Just as neglect of dress betrays contempt for the society in which a man moves, so does a hasty,
careless, and bad style show shocking disrespect for the reader, who then rightly punishes
it by not reading the book.

ON NOISE.

Kant has written a treatise on The Vital Powers; but I should like to write a dirge on them,
since their lavish use in the form of knocking, hammering, and tumbling things about has made
the whole of my life a daily torment. Certainly there are people, nay, very many, who will
smile at this, because they are not sensitive to noise; it is precisely these people, however,
who are not sensitive to argument, thought, poetry or art, in short, to any kind of intellectual
impression: a fact to be assigned to the coarse quality and strong texture of their brain tissues.
On the other hand, in the biographies or in other records of the personal utterances of almost
all great writers, I find complaints of the pain that noise has occasioned to intellectual
men. For example, in the case of Kant, Goethe, Lichtenberg, Jean Paul; and indeed when no mention
is made of the matter it is merely because the context did not lead up to it. I should explain
the subject we are treating in this way: If a big diamond is cut up into pieces, it immediately
loses its value as a whole; or if an army is scattered or divided into small bodies, it loses
all its power; and in the same way a great intellect has no more power than an ordinary one
as soon as it is interrupted, disturbed, distracted, or diverted; for its superiority entails
that it concentrates all its strength on one point and object, just as a concave mirror concentrates
all the rays of light thrown upon it. Noisy interruption prevents this concentration. This
is why the most eminent intellects have always been strongly averse to any kind of disturbance,
interruption and distraction, and above everything to that violent interruption which is caused
by noise; other people do not take any particular notice of this sort of thing. The most intelligent
of all the European nations has called "Never interrupt" the eleventh commandment. But noise
is the most impertinent of all interruptions, for it not only interrupts our own thoughts but
disperses them. Where, however, there is nothing to interrupt, noise naturally will not be
felt particularly. Sometimes a trifling but incessant noise torments and disturbs me for a
time, and before I become distinctly conscious of it I feel it merely as the effort of thinking
becomes more difficult, just as I should feel a weight on my foot; then I realise what it is.

But to pass from genus to species, the truly infernal cracking of whips in the narrow resounding
streets of a town must be denounced as the most unwarrantable and disgraceful of all noises.
It deprives life of all peace and sensibility. Nothing gives me so clear a grasp of the stupidity
and thoughtlessness of mankind as the tolerance of the cracking of whips. This sudden, sharp
crack which paralyses the brain, destroys all meditation, and murders thought, must cause pain
to any one who has anything like an idea in his head. Hence every crack must disturb a hundred
people applying their minds to some activity, however trivial it may be; while it disjoints
and renders painful the meditations of the thinker; just like the executioner's axe when it
severs the head from the body. No sound cuts so sharply into the brain as this cursed cracking
of whips; one feels the prick of the whip-cord in one's brain, which is affected in the same
way as the mimosa pudica is by touch, and which lasts the same length of time. With all respect
for the most holy doctrine of utility, I do not see why a fellow who is removing a load of
sand or manure should obtain the privilege of killing in the bud the thoughts that are springing
up in the heads of about ten thousand people successively. (He is only half-an-hour on the road.)

Hammering, the barking of dogs, and the screaming of children are abominable; but it is only
the cracking of a whip that is the true murderer of thought. Its object is to destroy every
favourable moment that one now and then may have for reflection. If there were no other means
of urging on an animal than by making this most disgraceful of all noises, one would forgive
its existence. But it is quite the contrary: this cursed cracking of whips is not only unnecessary
but even useless. The effect that it is intended to have on the horse mentally becomes quite
blunted and ineffective; since the constant abuse of it has accustomed the horse to the crack,
he does not quicken his pace for it. This is especially noticeable in the unceasing crack of
the whip which comes from an empty vehicle as it is being driven at its slowest rate to pick
up a fare. The slightest touch with the whip would be more effective. Allowing, however, that
it were absolutely necessary to remind the horse of the presence of the whip by continually
cracking it, a crack that made one hundredth part of the noise would be sufficient. It is well
known that animals in regard to hearing and seeing notice the slightest indications, even indications
that are scarcely perceptible to ourselves. Trained dogs and canary birds furnish astonishing
examples of this. Accordingly, this cracking of whips must be regarded as something purely
wanton; nay, as an impudent defiance, on the part of those who work with their hands, offered
to those who work with their heads. That such infamy is endured in a town is a piece of barbarity
and injustice, the more so as it could be easily removed by a police notice requiring every
whip cord to have a knot at the end of it. It would do no harm to draw the proletariat's attention
to the classes above him who work with their heads; for he has unbounded fear of any kind of
head work. A fellow who rides through the narrow streets of a populous town with unemployed
post-horses or cart-horses, unceasingly cracking with all his strength a whip several yards
long, instantly deserves to dismount and receive five really good blows with a stick. If all
the philanthropists in the world, together with all the legislators, met in order to bring
forward their reasons for the total abolition of corporal punishment, I would not be persuaded
to the contrary.

But we can see often enough something that is even still worse. I mean a carter walking alone,
and without any horses, through the streets incessantly cracking his whip. He has become so
accustomed to the crack in consequence of its unwarrantable toleration. Since one looks after
one's body and all its needs in a most tender fashion, is the thinking mind to be the only
thing that never experiences the slightest consideration or protection, to say nothing of respect?
Carters, sack-bearers (porters), messengers, and such-like, are the beasts of burden of humanity;
they should be treated absolutely with justice, fairness, forbearance and care, but they ought
not to be allowed to thwart the higher exertions of the human race by wantonly making a noise.
I should like to know how many great and splendid thoughts these whips have cracked out of
the world. If I had any authority, I should soon produce in the heads of these carters an inseparable
nexus idearum between cracking a whip and receiving a whipping.

Let us hope that those nations with more intelligence and refined feelings will make a beginning,
and then by force of example induce the Germans to do the same.[8] Meanwhile, hear what Thomas
Hood says of them (Up the Rhine): "For a musical people they are the most noisy I ever met
with" That they are so is not due to their being more prone to making a noise than other people,
but to their insensibility, which springs from obtuseness; they are not disturbed by it in
reading or thinking, because they do not think; they only smoke, which is their substitute
for thought. The general toleration of unnecessary noise, for instance, of the clashing of
doors, which is so extremely ill-mannered and vulgar, is a direct proof of the dulness and
poverty of thought that one meets with everywhere. In Germany it seems as though it were planned
that no one should think for noise; take the inane drumming that goes on as an instance. Finally,
as far as the literature treated of in this chapter is concerned, I have only one work to recommend,
but it is an excellent one: I mean a poetical epistle in terzo rimo by the famous painter Bronzino,
entitled "De' Romori: a Messer Luca Martini" It describes fully and amusingly the torture to
which one is put by the many kinds of noises of a small Italian town. It is written in tragicomic
style. This epistle is to be found in Opere burlesche del Berni, Aretino ed altri, vol. ii.
p. 258, apparently published in Utrecht in 1771.

The nature of our intellect is such that ideas are said to spring by abstraction from observations,
so that the latter are in existence before the former. If this is really what takes place,
as is the case with a man who has merely his own experience as his teacher and book, he knows
quite well which of his observations belong to and are represented by each of his ideas; he
is perfectly acquainted with both, and accordingly he treats everything correctly that comes
before his notice. We might call this the natural mode of education.

On the other hand, an artificial education is having one's head crammed full of ideas, derived
from hearing others talk, from learning and reading, before one has anything like an extensive
knowledge of the world as it is and as one sees it. The observations which produce all these
ideas are said to come later on with experience; but until then these ideas are applied wrongly,
and accordingly both things and men are judged wrongly, seen wrongly, and treated wrongly.
And so it is that education perverts the mind; and this is why, after a long spell of learning
and reading, we enter the world, in our youth, with views that are partly simple, partly perverted;
consequently we comport ourselves with an air of anxiety at one time, at another of presumption.
This is because our head is full of ideas which we are now trying to make use of, but almost
always apply wrongly. This is the result of ὑστερον προτερον (putting the cart before the horse),
since we are directly opposing the natural development of our mind by obtaining ideas first
and observations last; for teachers, instead of developing in a boy his faculties of discernment
and judgment, and of thinking for himself, merely strive to stuff his head full of other people's
thoughts. Subsequently, all the opinions that have sprung from misapplied ideas have to be
rectified by a lengthy experience; and it is seldom that they are completely rectified. This
is why so few men of learning have such sound common sense as is quite common among the illiterate.

       *       *       *       *       *

From what has been said, the principal point in education is that one's knowledge of the world
begins at the right end; and the attainment of which might be designated as the aim of all
education. But, as has been pointed out, this depends principally on the observation of each
thing preceding the idea one forms of it; further, that narrow ideas precede broader; so that
the whole of one's instruction is given in the order that the ideas themselves during formation
must have followed. But directly this order is not strictly adhered to, imperfect and subsequently
wrong ideas spring up; and finally there arises a perverted view of the world in keeping with
the nature of the individual--a view such as almost every one holds for a long time, and most
people to the end of their lives. If a man analyses his own character, he will find that it
was not until he reached a very ripe age, and in some cases quite unexpectedly, that he was
able to rightly and clearly understand many matters of a quite simple nature.

Previously, there had been an obscure point in his knowledge of the world which had arisen
through his omitting something in his early education, whether he had been either artificially
educated by men or just naturally by his own experience. Therefore one should try to find out
the strictly natural course of knowledge, so that by keeping methodically to it children may
become acquainted with the affairs of the world, without getting false ideas into their heads,
which frequently cannot be driven out again. In carrying this out, one must next take care
that children do not use words with which they connect no clear meaning. Even children have,
as a rule, that unhappy tendency of being satisfied with words instead of wishing to understand
things, and of learning words by heart, so that they may make use of them when they are in
a difficulty. This tendency clings to them afterwards, so that the knowledge of many learned
men becomes mere verbosity.

However, the principal thing must always be to let one's observations precede one's ideas,
and not the reverse as is usually and unfortunately the case; which may be likened to a child
coming into the world with its feet foremost, or a rhyme begun before thinking of its reason.
While the child's mind has made a very few observations one inculcates it with ideas and opinions,
which are, strictly speaking, prejudices. His observations and experience are developed through
this ready-made apparatus instead of his ideas being developed out of his own observations.
In viewing the world one sees many things from many sides, consequently this is not such a
short or quick way of learning as that which makes use of abstract ideas, and quickly comes
to a decision about everything; therefore preconceived ideas will not be rectified until late,
or it may be they are never rectified. For, when a man's view contradicts his ideas, he will
reject at the outset what it renders evident as one-sided, nay, he will deny it and shut his
eyes to it, so that his preconceived ideas may remain unaffected. And so it happens that many
men go through life full of oddities, caprices, fancies, and prejudices, until they finally
become fixed ideas. He has never attempted to abstract fundamental ideas from his own observations
and experience, because he has got everything ready-made from other people; and it is for this
very reason that he and countless others are so insipid and shallow. Instead of such a system,
the natural system of education should be employed in educating children. No idea should be
impregnated but what has come through the medium of observations, or at any rate been verified
by them. A child would have fewer ideas, but they would be well-grounded and correct. It would
learn to measure things according to its own standard and not according to another's. It would
then never acquire a thousand whims and prejudices which must be eradicated by the greater
part of subsequent experience and education. Its mind would henceforth be accustomed to thoroughness
and clearness; the child would rely on its own judgment, and be free from prejudices. And,
in general, children should not get to know life, in any aspect whatever, from the copy before
they have learnt it from the original. Instead, therefore, of hastening to place mere books
in their hands, one should make them gradually acquainted with things and the circumstances
of human life, and above everything one should take care to guide them to a clear grasp of
reality, and to teach them to obtain their ideas directly from the real world, and to form
them in keeping with it--but not to get them from elsewhere, as from books, fables, or what
others have said--and then later to make use of such ready-made ideas in real life. The result
will be that their heads are full of chimeras and that some will have a wrong comprehension
of things, and others will fruitlessly endeavour to remodel the world according to those chimeras,
and so get on to wrong paths both in theory and practice. For it is incredible how much harm
is done by false notions which have been implanted early in life, only to develop later on
into prejudices; the later education which we get from the world and real life must be employed
in eradicating these early ideas. And this is why, as is related by Diogenes Laertius, Antisthenes
gave the following answer: έρωτηθεις τι των μαθηματων ἀναγκαιοτατον, έφη, "το κακα ἀπομαθειν."
(Interrogatus quaenam esset disciplina maxime necessaria, Mala, inquit, dediscere.)

       *       *       *       *       *

Children should be kept from all kinds of instruction that may make errors possible until their
sixteenth year, that is to say, from philosophy, religion, and general views of every description;
because it is the errors that are acquired in early days that remain, as a rule, ineradicable,
and because the faculty of judgment is the last to arrive at maturity. They should only be
interested in such things that make errors impossible, such as mathematics, in things which
are not very dangerous, such as languages, natural science, history, and so forth; in general,
the branches of knowledge which are to be taken up at any age must be within reach of the intellect
at that age and perfectly comprehensible to it. Childhood and youth are the time for collecting
data and getting to know specially and thoroughly individual and particular things. On the
other hand, all judgment of a general nature must at that time be suspended, and final explanations
left alone. One should leave the faculty of judgment alone, as it only comes with maturity
and experience, and also take care that one does not anticipate it by inculcating prejudice,
when it will be crippled for ever.

On the contrary, the memory is to be specially exercised, as it has its greatest strength and
tenacity in youth; however, what has to be retained must be chosen with the most careful and
scrupulous consideration. For as it is what we have learnt well in our youth that lasts, we
should take the greatest possible advantage of this precious gift. If we picture to ourselves
how deeply engraven on our memory the people are whom we knew during the first twelve years
of our life, and how indelibly imprinted are also the events of that time, and most of the
things that we then experienced, heard, or learnt, the idea of basing education on this susceptibility
and tenacity of the youthful mind will seem natural; in that the mind receives its impressions
according to a strict method and a regular system. But because the years of youth that are
assigned to man are only few, and the capacity for remembering, in general, is always limited
(and still more so the capacity for remembering of the individual), everything depends on the
memory being filled with what is most essential and important in any department of knowledge,
to the exclusion of everything else. This selection should be made by the most capable minds
and masters in every branch of knowledge after the most mature consideration, and the result
of it established. Such a selection must be based on a sifting of matters which are necessary
and important for a man to know in general, and also for him to know in a particular profession
or calling. Knowledge of the first kind would have to be divided into graduated courses, like
an encyclop�dia, corresponding to the degree of general culture which each man has attained
in his external circumstances; from a course restricted to what is necessary for primary instruction
up to the matter contained in every branch of the philosophical faculty. Knowledge of the second
kind would, however, be reserved for him who had really mastered the selection in all its branches.
The whole would give a canon specially devised for intellectual education, which naturally
would require revision every ten years. By such an arrangement the youthful power of the memory
would be put to the best advantage, and it would furnish the faculty of judgment with excellent
material when it appeared later on.

       *       *       *       *       *

What is meant by maturity of knowledge is that state of perfection to which any one individual
is able to bring it, when an exact correspondence has been effected between the whole of his
abstract ideas and his own personal observations: whereby each of his ideas rests directly
or indirectly on a basis of observation, which alone gives it any real value; and likewise
he is able to place every observation that he makes under the right idea corresponding to it.

Maturity of knowledge is the work of experience alone, and consequently of time. For the knowledge
we acquire from our own observation is, as a rule, distinct from that we get through abstract
ideas; the former is acquired in the natural way, while the latter comes through good and bad
instruction and what other people have told to us. Consequently, in youth there is generally
little harmony and connection between our ideas, which mere expressions have fixed, and our
real knowledge, which has been acquired by observation. Later they both gradually approach
and correct each other; but maturity of knowledge does not exist until they have become quite
incorporated. This maturity is quite independent of that other kind of perfection, the standard
of which may be high or low, I mean the perfection to which the capacities of an individual
may be brought; it is not based on a correspondence between the abstract and intuitive knowledge,
but on the degree of intensity of each.

The most necessary thing for the practical man is the attainment of an exact and thorough knowledge
of what is really going on in the world; but it is also the most irksome, for a man may continue
studying until old age without having learnt all that is to be learnt; while one can master
the most important things in the sciences in one's youth. In getting such a knowledge of the
world, it is as a novice that the boy and youth have the first and most difficult lessons to
learn; but frequently even the matured man has still much to learn. The study is of considerable
difficulty in itself, but it is made doubly difficult by novels, which depict the ways of the
world and of men who do not exist in real life. But these are accepted with the credulity of
youth, and become incorporated with the mind; so that now, in the place of purely negative
ignorance, a whole framework of wrong ideas, which are positively wrong, crops up, subsequently
confusing the schooling of experience and representing the lesson it teaches in a false light.
If the youth was previously in the dark, he will now be led astray by a will-o'-the-wisp: and
with a girl this is still more frequently the case. They have been deluded into an absolutely
false view of life by reading novels, and expectations have been raised that can never be fulfilled.
This generally has the most harmful effect on their whole lives. Those men who had neither
time nor opportunity to read novels in their youth, such as those who work with their hands,
have decided advantage over them. Few of these novels are exempt from reproach--nay, whose
effect is contrary to bad. Before all others, for instance, Gil Blas and the other works of
Le Sage (or rather their Spanish originals); further, The Vicar of Wakefield, and to some extent
the novels of Walter Scott. Don Quixote may be regarded as a satirical presentation of the
error in question.

ON READING AND BOOKS.

Ignorance is degrading only when it is found in company with riches. Want and penury restrain
the poor man; his employment takes the place of knowledge and occupies his thoughts: while
rich men who are ignorant live for their pleasure only, and resemble a beast; as may be seen
daily. They are to be reproached also for not having used wealth and leisure for that which
lends them their greatest value.

When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. It is the
same as the pupil, in learning to write, following with his pen the lines that have been pencilled
by the teacher. Accordingly, in reading, the work of thinking is, for the greater part, done
for us. This is why we are consciously relieved when we turn to reading after being occupied
with our own thoughts. But, in reading, our head is, however, really only the arena of some
one else's thoughts. And so it happens that the person who reads a great deal--that is to say,
almost the whole day, and recreates himself by spending the intervals in thoughtless diversion,
gradually loses the ability to think for himself; just as a man who is always riding at last
forgets how to walk. Such, however, is the case with many men of learning: they have read themselves
stupid. For to read in every spare moment, and to read constantly, is more paralysing to the
mind than constant manual work, which, at any rate, allows one to follow one's own thoughts.
Just as a spring, through the continual pressure of a foreign body, at last loses its elasticity,
so does the mind if it has another person's thoughts continually forced upon it. And just as
one spoils the stomach by overfeeding and thereby impairs the whole body, so can one overload
and choke the mind by giving it too much nourishment. For the more one reads the fewer are
the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over
and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate
what one has read if one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been
read does not take root, but is for the most part lost. Indeed, it is the same with mental
as with bodily food: scarcely the fifth part of what a man takes is assimilated; the remainder
passes off in evaporation, respiration, and the like.

From all this it may be concluded that thoughts put down on paper are nothing more than footprints
in the sand: one sees the road the man has taken, but in order to know what he saw on the way,
one requires his eyes.

No literary quality can be attained by reading writers who possess it: be it, for example,
persuasiveness, imagination, the gift of drawing comparisons, boldness or bitterness, brevity
or grace, facility of expression or wit, unexpected contrasts, a laconic manner, na�vet�, and
the like. But if we are already gifted with these qualities--that is to say, if we possess
them potentia--we can call them forth and bring them to consciousness; we can discern to what
uses they are to be put; we can be strengthened in our inclination, nay, may have courage,
to use them; we can judge by examples the effect of their application and so learn the correct
use of them; and it is only after we have accomplished all this that we actu possess these
qualities. This is the only way in which reading can form writing, since it teaches us the
use to which we can put our own natural gifts; and in order to do this it must be taken for
granted that these qualities are in us. Without them we learn nothing from reading but cold,
dead mannerisms, and we become mere imitators.

The health officer should, in the interest of one's eyes, see that the smallness of print has
a fixed minimum, which must not be exceeded. When I was in Venice in 1818, at which time the
genuine Venetian chain was still being made, a goldsmith told me that those who made the catena
fina turned blind at thirty.

As the strata of the earth preserve in rows the beings which lived in former times, so do the
shelves of a library preserve in a like manner the errors of the past and expositions concerning
them. Like those creatures, they too were full of life in their time and made a great deal
of noise; but now they are stiff and fossilised, and only of interest to the literary palaeontologist.

According to Herodotus, Xerxes wept at the sight of his army, which was too extensive for him
to scan, at the thought that a hundred years hence not one of all these would be alive. Who
would not weep at the thought in looking over a big catalogue that of all these books not one
will be in existence in ten years' time?

It is the same in literature as in life.

There is a more cunning and worse trick, albeit a profitable one. Litt�rateurs, hack-writers,
and productive authors have succeeded, contrary to good taste and the true culture of the age,
in bringing the world elegante into leading-strings, so that they have been taught to read
a tempo and all the same thing--namely, the newest books order that they may have material
for conversation in their social circles. Bad novels and similar productions from the pen of
writers who were once famous, such as Spindler, Bulwer, Eug�ne Sue, and so on, serve this purpose.
But what can be more miserable than the fate of a reading public of this kind, that feels always
impelled to read the latest writings of extremely commonplace authors who write for money only,
and therefore exist in numbers? And for the sake of this they merely know by name the works
of the rare and superior writers, of all ages and countries.

Literary newspapers, since they print the daily smatterings of commonplace people, are especially
a cunning means for robbing from the aesthetic public the time which should be devoted to the
genuine productions of art for the furtherance of culture.

Hence, in regard to our subject, the art of not reading is highly important. This consists
in not taking a book into one's hand merely because it is interesting the great public at the
time--such as political or religious pamphlets, novels, poetry, and the like, which make a
noise and reach perhaps several editions in their first and last years of existence. Remember
rather that the man who writes for fools always finds a large public: and only read for a limited
and definite time exclusively the works of great minds, those who surpass other men of all
times and countries, and whom the voice of fame points to as such. These alone really educate
and instruct.

One can never read too little of bad, or too much of good books: bad books are intellectual
poison; they destroy the mind.

In order to read what is good one must make it a condition never to read what is bad; for life
is short, and both time and strength limited.

Books are written sometimes about this, sometimes about that great thinker of former times,
and the public reads these books, but not the works of the man himself. This is because it
wants to read only what has just been printed, and because similis simili gaudet, and it finds
the shallow, insipid gossip of some stupid head of to-day more homogeneous and agreeable than
the thoughts of great minds. I have to thank fate, however, that a fine epigram of A.B. Schlegel,
which has since been my guiding star, came before my notice as a youth:

  "Leset fleizig die Alten, die wahren eigentlich Alten
  Was die Neuen davon sagen bedeutet nicht viel."

Oh, how like one commonplace mind is to another! How they are all fashioned in one form! How
they all think alike under similar circumstances, and never differ! This is why their views
are so personal and petty. And a stupid public reads the worthless trash written by these fellows
for no other reason than that it has been printed to-day, while it leaves the works of great
thinkers undisturbed on the bookshelves.

Incredible are the folly and perversity of a public that will leave unread writings of the
noblest and rarest of minds, of all times and all countries, for the sake of reading the writings
of commonplace persons which appear daily, and breed every year in countless numbers like flies;
merely because these writings have been printed to-day and are still wet from the press. It
would be better if they were thrown on one side and rejected the day they appeared, as they
must be after the lapse of a few years. They will then afford material for laughter as illustrating
the follies of a former time.

It is because people will only read what is the newest instead of what is the best of all ages,
that writers remain in the narrow circle of prevailing ideas, and that the age sinks deeper
and deeper in its own mire.

There are at all times two literatures which, although scarcely known to each other, progress
side by side--the one real, the other merely apparent. The former grows into literature that
lasts. Pursued by people who live for science or poetry, it goes its way earnestly and quietly,
but extremely slowly; and it produces in Europe scarcely a dozen works in a century, which,
however, are permanent. The other literature is pursued by people who live on science or poetry;
it goes at a gallop amid a great noise and shouting of those taking part, and brings yearly
many thousand works into the market. But after a few years one asks, Where are they? where
is their fame, which was so great formerly? This class of literature may be distinguished as
fleeting, the other as permanent.

It would be a good thing to buy books if one could also buy the time to read them; but one
usually confuses the purchase of books with the acquisition of their contents. To desire that
a man should retain everything he has ever read, is the same as wishing him to retain in his
stomach all that he has ever eaten. He has been bodily nourished on what he has eaten, and
mentally on what he has read, and through them become what he is. As the body assimilates what
is homogeneous to it, so will a man retain what interests him; in other words, what coincides
with his system of thought or suits his ends. Every one has aims, but very few have anything
approaching a system of thought. This is why such people do not take an objective interest
in anything, and why they learn nothing from what they read: they remember nothing about it.

Repetitio est mater studiorum. Any kind of important book should immediately be read twice,
partly because one grasps the matter in its entirety the second time, and only really understands
the beginning when the end is known; and partly because in reading it the second time one's
temper and mood are different, so that one gets another impression; it may be that one sees
the matter in another light.

Works are the quintessence of a mind, and are therefore always of by far greater value than
conversation, even if it be the conversation of the greatest mind. In every essential a man's
works surpass his conversation and leave it far behind. Even the writings of an ordinary man
may be instructive, worth reading, and entertaining, for the simple reason that they are the
quintessence of that man's mind--that is to say, the writings are the result and fruit of his
whole thought and study; while we should be dissatisfied with his conversation. Accordingly,
it is possible to read books written by people whose conversation would give us no satisfaction;
so that the mind will only by degrees attain high culture by finding entertainment almost entirely
in books, and not in men.

There is nothing that so greatly recreates the mind as the works of the old classic writers.
Directly one has been taken up, even if it is only for half-an-hour, one feels as quickly refreshed,
relieved, purified, elevated, and strengthened as if one had refreshed oneself at a mountain
stream. Is this due to the perfections of the old languages, or to the greatness of the minds
whose works have remained unharmed and untouched for centuries? Perhaps to both combined. This
I know, directly we stop learning the old languages (as is at present threatening) a new class
of literature will spring up, consisting of writing that is more barbaric, stupid, and worthless
than has ever yet existed; that, in particular, the German language, which possesses some of
the beauties of the old languages, will be systematically spoilt and stripped by these worthless
contemporary scribblers, until, little by little, it becomes impoverished, crippled, and reduced
to a miserable jargon.

Half a century is always a considerable time in the history of the universe, for the matter
which forms it is always shifting; something is always taking place. But the same length of
time in literature often goes for nothing, because nothing has happened; unskilful attempts
don't count; so that we are exactly where we were fifty years previously.

To illustrate this: imagine the progress of knowledge among mankind in the form of a planet's
course. The false paths the human race soon follows after any important progress has been made
represent the epicycles in the Ptolemaic system; after passing through any one of them the
planet is just where it was before it entered it. The great minds, however, which really bring
the race further on its course, do not accompany it on the epicycles which it makes every time.
This explains why posthumous fame is got at the expense of contemporary fame, and vice vers�.
We have an instance of such an epicycle in the philosophy of Fichte and Schelling, crowned
by Hegel's caricature of it. This epicycle issued from the limit to which philosophy had been
finally brought by Kant, where I myself took it up again later to carry it further. In the
interim the false philosophers I have mentioned, and some others, passed through their epicycle,
which has just been terminated; hence the people who accompanied them are conscious of being
exactly at the point from which they started.

This condition of things shows why the scientific, literary, and artistic spirit of the age
is declared bankrupt about every thirty years. During that period the errors have increased
to such an extent that they fall under the weight of their absurdity; while at the same time
the opposition to them has become stronger. At this point there is a crash, which is followed
by an error in the opposite direction. To show the course that is taken in its periodical return
would be the true practical subject of the history of literature; little notice is taken of
it, however. Moreover, through the comparative shortness of such periods, the data of remote
times are with difficulty collected; hence the matter can be most conveniently observed in
one's own age. An example of this taken from physical science is found in Werter's Neptunian
geology. But let me keep to the example already quoted above, for it is nearest to us. In German
philosophy Kant's brilliant period was immediately followed by another period, which aimed
at being imposing rather than convincing. Instead of being solid and clear, it aimed at being
brilliant and hyperbolical, and, in particular, unintelligible; instead of seeking truth, it
intrigued. Under these circumstances philosophy could make no progress. Ultimately the whole
school and its method became bankrupt. For the audacious, sophisticated nonsense on the one
hand, and the unconscionable praise on the other of Hegel and his fellows, as well as the apparent
object of the whole affair, rose to such a pitch that in the end the charlatanry of the thing
was obvious to everybody; and when, in consequence of certain revelations, the protection that
had been given it by the upper classes was withdrawn, it was talked about by everybody. This
most miserable of all the philosophies that have ever existed dragged down with it into the
abyss of discredit the systems of Fichte and Schelling, which had preceded it. So that the
absolute philosophical futility of the first half of the century following upon Kant in Germany
is obvious; and yet the Germans boast of their gift for philosophy compared with foreigners,
especially since an English writer, with malicious irony, called them a nation of thinkers.

Those who want an example of the general scheme of epicycles taken from the history of art
need only look at the School of Sculpture which flourished in the last century under Bernini,
and especially at its further cultivation in France. This school represented commonplace nature
instead of antique beauty, and the manners of a French minuet instead of antique simplicity
and grace. It became bankrupt when, under Winckelmann's direction, a return was made to the
antique school. Another example is supplied in the painting belonging to the first quarter
of this century. Art was regarded merely as a means and instrument of mediaeval religious feeling,
and consequently ecclesiastical subjects alone were chosen for its themes. These, however,
were treated by painters who were wanting in earnestness of faith, and in their delusion they
took for examples Francesco Francia, Pietro Perugino, Angelico da Fiesole, and others like
them, even holding them in greater esteem than the truly great masters who followed. In view
of this error, and because in poetry an analogous effort had at the same time met with favour,
Goethe wrote his parable Pfaffenspiel. This school, reputedly capricious, became bankrupt,
and was followed by a return to nature, which made itself known in genre pictures and scenes
of life of every description, even though it strayed sometimes into vulgarity.

It is the same with the progress of the human mind in the history of literature, which is for
the most part like the catalogue of a cabinet of deformities; the spirit in which they keep
the longest is pigskin. We do not need to look there for the few who have been born shapely;
they are still alive, and we come across them in every part of the world, like immortals whose
youth is ever fresh. They alone form what I have distinguished as real literature, the history
of which, although poor in persons, we learn from our youth up out of the mouths of educated
people, and not first of all from compilations. As a specific against the present prevailing
monomania for reading literary histories, so that one may be able to chatter about everything
without really knowing anything, let me refer you to a passage from Lichtenberg which is well
worth reading (vol. ii. p. 302 of the old edition).

But I wish some one would attempt a tragical history of literature, showing how the greatest
writers and artists have been treated during their lives by the various nations which have
produced them and whose proudest possessions they are. It would show us the endless fight which
the good and genuine works of all periods and countries have had to carry on against the perverse
and bad. It would depict the martyrdom of almost all those who truly enlightened humanity,
of almost all the great masters in every kind of art; it would show us how they, with few exceptions,
were tormented without recognition, without any to share their misery, without followers; how
they existed in poverty and misery whilst fame, honour, and riches fell to the lot of the worthless;
it would reveal that what happened to them happened to Esau, who, while hunting the deer for
his father, was robbed of the blessing by Jacob disguised in his brother's coat; and how through
it all the love of their subject kept them up, until at last the trying fight of such a teacher
of the human race is ended, the immortal laurel offered to him, and the time come when it can
be said of him

  "Der schwere Panzer wird zum Fl�gelkleide
  Kurz ist der Schmerz, unendlich ist die Freude."

THE EMPTINESS OF EXISTENCE.

This emptiness finds its expression in the whole form of existence, in the infiniteness of
Time and Space as opposed to the finiteness of the individual in both; in the flitting present
as the only manner of real existence; in the dependence and relativity of all things; in constantly
Becoming without Being; in continually wishing without being satisfied; in an incessant thwarting
of one's efforts, which go to make up life, until victory is won. Time, and the transitoriness
of all things, are merely the form under which the will to live, which as the thing-in-itself
is imperishable, has revealed to Time the futility of its efforts. Time is that by which at
every moment all things become as nothing in our hands, and thereby lose all their true value.

       *       *       *       *       *

What has been exists no more; and exists just as little as that which has never been. But everything
that exists has been in the next moment. Hence something belonging to the present, however
unimportant it may be, is superior to something important belonging to the past; this is because
the former is a reality and related to the latter as something is to nothing.

A man to his astonishment all at once becomes conscious of existing after having been in a
state of non-existence for many thousands of years, when, presently again, he returns to a
state of non-existence for an equally long time. This cannot possibly be true, says the heart;
and even the crude mind, after giving the matter its consideration, must have some sort of
presentiment of the ideality of time. This ideality of time, together with that of space, is
the key to every true system of metaphysics, because it finds room for quite another order
of things than is to be found in nature. This is why Kant is so great.

Of every event in our life it is only for a moment that we can say that it is; after that we
must say for ever that it was. Every evening makes us poorer by a day. It would probably make
us angry to see this short space of time slipping away, if we were not secretly conscious in
the furthest depths of our being that the spring of eternity belongs to us, and that in it
we are always able to have life renewed.

Reflections of the nature of those above may, indeed, establish the belief that to enjoy the
present, and to make this the purpose of one's life, is the greatest wisdom; since it is the
present alone that is real, everything else being only the play of thought. But such a purpose
might just as well be called the greatest folly, for that which in the next moment exists no
more, and vanishes as completely as a dream, can never be worth a serious effort.

       *       *       *       *       *

Our existence is based solely on the ever-fleeting present. Essentially, therefore, it has
to take the form of continual motion without there ever being any possibility of our finding
the rest after which we are always striving. It is the same as a man running downhill, who
falls if he tries to stop, and it is only by his continuing to run on that he keeps on his
legs; it is like a pole balanced on one's finger-tips, or like a planet that would fall into
its sun as soon as it stopped hurrying onwards. Hence unrest is the type of existence.

In a world like this, where there is no kind of stability, no possibility of anything lasting,
but where everything is thrown into a restless whirlpool of change, where everything hurries
on, flies, and is maintained in the balance by a continual advancing and moving, it is impossible
to imagine happiness. It cannot dwell where, as Plato says, continual Becoming and never Being
is all that takes place. First of all, no man is happy; he strives his whole life long after
imaginary happiness, which he seldom attains, and if he does, then it is only to be disillusioned;
and as a rule he is shipwrecked in the end and enters the harbour dismasted. Then it is all
the same whether he has been happy or unhappy in a life which was made up of a merely ever-changing
present and is now at an end.

Meanwhile it surprises one to find, both in the world of human beings and in that of animals,
that this great, manifold, and restless motion is sustained and kept going by the medium of
two simple impulses--hunger and the instinct of sex, helped perhaps a little by boredom--and
that these have the power to form the primum mobile of so complex a machinery, setting in motion
the variegated show!

Looking at the matter a little closer, we see at the very outset that the existence of inorganic
matter is being constantly attacked by chemical forces which eventually annihilates it. While
organic existence is only made possible by continual change of matter, to keep up a perpetual
supply of which it must consequently have help from without. Therefore organic life is like
balancing a pole on one's hand; it must be kept in continual motion, and have a constant supply
of matter of which it is continually and endlessly in need. Nevertheless it is only by means
of this organic life that consciousness is possible.

Accordingly this is a finite existence, and its antithesis would be an infinite, neither exposed
to any attack from without nor in want of help from without, and hence ἀεί ὡσαύτως ὄν, in
eternal rest; οὔτε γιγνόμενον, οὔτε ἀπολλύμενον, without change, without time, and without
diversity; the negative knowledge of which is the fundamental note of Plato's philosophy. The
denial of the will to live reveals the way to such a state as this.

       *       *       *       *       *

The scenes of our life are like pictures in rough mosaic, which have no effect at close quarters,
but must be looked at from a distance in order to discern their beauty. So that to obtain something
we have desired is to find out that it is worthless; we are always living in expectation of
better things, while, at the same time, we often repent and long for things that belong to
the past. We accept the present as something that is only temporary, and regard it only as
a means to accomplish our aim. So that most people will find if they look back when their life
is at an end, that they have lived their lifelong ad interim, and they will be surprised to
find that something they allowed to pass by unnoticed and unenjoyed was just their life--that
is to say, it was the very thing in the expectation of which they lived. And so it may be said
of man in general that, befooled by hope, he dances into the arms of death.

Then again, there is the insatiability of each individual will; every time it is satisfied
a new wish is engendered, and there is no end to its eternally insatiable desires.

This is because the Will, taken in itself, is the lord of worlds; since everything belongs
to it, it is not satisfied with a portion of anything, but only with the whole, which, however,
is endless. Meanwhile it must excite our pity when we consider how extremely little this lord
of the world receives, when it makes its appearance as an individual; for the most part only
just enough to maintain the body. This is why man is so very unhappy.

In the present age, which is intellectually impotent and remarkable for its veneration of what
is bad in every form--a condition of things which is quite in keeping with the coined word
"Jetztzeit" (present time), as pretentious as it is cacophonic--the pantheists make bold to
say that life is, as they call it, "an end-in itself." If our existence in this world were
an end-in-itself, it would be the most absurd end that was ever determined; even we ourselves
or any one else might have imagined it.

Life presents itself next as a task, the task, that is, of subsisting de gagner sa vie. If
this is solved, then that which has been won becomes a burden, and involves the second task
of its being got rid of in order to ward off boredom, which, like a bird of prey, is ready
to fall upon any life that is secure from want.

So that the first task is to win something, and the second, after the something has been won,
to forget about it, otherwise it becomes a burden.

That human life must be a kind of mistake is sufficiently clear from the fact that man is a
compound of needs, which are difficult to satisfy; moreover, if they are satisfied, all he
is granted is a state of painlessness, in which he can only give himself up to boredom. This
is a precise proof that existence in itself has no value, since boredom is merely the feeling
of the emptiness of life. If, for instance, life, the longing for which constitutes our very
being, had in itself any positive and real value, boredom could not exist; mere existence in
itself would supply us with everything, and therefore satisfy us. But our existence would not
be a joyous thing unless we were striving after something; distance and obstacles to be overcome
then represent our aim as something that would satisfy us--an illusion which vanishes when
our aim has been attained; or when we are engaged in something that is of a purely intellectual
nature, when, in reality, we have retired from the world, so that we may observe it from the
outside, like spectators at a theatre. Even sensual pleasure itself is nothing but a continual
striving, which ceases directly its aim is attained. As soon as we are not engaged in one of
these two ways, but thrown back on existence itself, we are convinced of the emptiness and
worthlessness of it; and this it is we call boredom. That innate and ineradicable craving for
what is out of the common proves how glad we are to have the natural and tedious course of
things interrupted. Even the pomp and splendour of the rich in their stately castles is at
bottom nothing but a futile attempt to escape the very essence of existence, misery.

       *       *       *       *       *

That the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, which presents itself in the extremely
subtle and complicated machinery of the human organism, must fall to dust and finally deliver
up its whole being to dissolution, is the na�ve way in which Nature, invariably true and genuine,
declares the whole striving of the will in its very essence to be of no avail. If it were of
any value in itself, something unconditioned, its end would not be non-existence. This is the
dominant note of Goethe's beautiful song:

  "Hoch auf dem alten Thurme steht
  Des Helden edler Geist."

That man is nothing but a phenomenon, that he is not-the-thing-in-itself--I mean that he is
not ὄντως ὄν--is proved by the fact that death is a necessity.

And how different the beginning of our life is to the end! The former is made up of deluded
hopes, sensual enjoyment, while the latter is pursued by bodily decay and the odour of death.

The road dividing the two, as far as our well-being and enjoyment of life are concerned, is
downhill; the dreaminess of childhood, the joyousness of youth, the troubles of middle age,
the infirmity and frequent misery of old age, the agonies of our last illness, and finally
the struggle with death--do all these not make one feel that existence is nothing but a mistake,
the consequences of which are becoming gradually more and more obvious?

It would be wisest to regard life as a desenga�o, a delusion; that everything is intended to
be so is sufficiently clear.

Our life is of a microscopical nature; it is an indivisible point which, drawn out by the powerful
lenses of Time and Space, becomes considerably magnified.

Time is an element in our brain which by the means of duration gives a semblance of reality
to the absolutely empty existence of things and ourselves.

How foolish it is for a man to regret and deplore his having made no use of past opportunities,
which might have secured him this or that happiness or enjoyment! What is there left of them
now? Only the ghost of a remembrance! And it is the same with everything that really falls
to our lot. So that the form of time itself, and how much is reckoned on it, is a definite
way of proving to us the vanity of all earthly enjoyment.

Our existence, as well as that of all animals, is not one that lasts, it is only temporary,
merely an existentia fluxa, which may be compared to a water-mill in that it is constantly
changing.

It is true that the form of the body lasts for a time, but only on condition that the matter
is constantly changing, that the old matter is thrown off and new added. And it is the chief
work of all living creatures to secure a constant supply of suitable matter. At the same time,
they are conscious that their existence is so fashioned as to last only for a certain time,
as has been said. This is why they attempt, when they are taking leave of life, to hand it
over to some one else who will take their place. This attempt takes the form of the sexual
instinct in self-consciousness, and in the consciousness of other things presents itself objectively--that
is, in the form of genital instinct. This instinct may be compared to the threading of a string
of pearls; one individual succeeding another as rapidly as the pearls on the thread. If we,
in imagination, hasten on this succession, we shall see that the matter is constantly changing
in the whole row just as it is changing in each pearl, while it retains the same form: we will
then realise that we have only a quasi-existence. That it is only Ideas which exist, and the
shadow-like nature of the thing corresponding to them, is the basis of Plato's teachings.

That we are nothing but phenomena as opposed to the thing-in-itself is confirmed, exemplified,
and made clear by the fact that the conditio sine qua non of our existence is a continual flowing
off and flowing to of matter which, as nourishment, is a constant need. So that we resemble
such phenomena as smoke, fire, or a jet of water, all of which die out or stop directly there
is no supply of matter. It may be said then that the will to live presents itself in the form
of pure phenomena which end in nothing. This nothingness, however, together with the phenomena,
remain within the boundary of the will to live and are based on it. I admit that this is somewhat
obscure.

If we try to get a general view of humanity at a glance, we shall see everywhere a constant
fighting and mighty struggling for life and existence; that mental and bodily strength is taxed
to the utmost, and opposed by threatening and actual dangers and woes of every kind.

And if we consider the price that is paid for all this, existence, and life itself, it will
be found that there has been an interval when existence was free from pain, an interval, however,
which was immediately followed by boredom, and which in its turn was quickly terminated by
fresh cravings.

That boredom is immediately followed by fresh needs is a fact which is also true of the cleverer
order of animals, because life has no true and genuine value in itself, but is kept in motion
merely through the medium of needs and illusion. As soon as there are no needs and illusion
we become conscious of the absolute barrenness and emptiness of existence.

If one turns from contemplating the course of the world at large, and in particular from the
ephemeral and mock existence of men as they follow each other in rapid succession, to the detail
of life, how like a comedy it seems!

It impresses us in the same way as a drop of water, crowded with infusoria, seen through a
microscope, or a little heap of cheese-mites that would otherwise be invisible. Their activity
and struggling with each other in such little space amuse us greatly. And it is the same in
the little span of life--great and earnest activity produces a comic effect.

No man has ever felt perfectly happy in the present; if he had it would have intoxicated him.

These few words of Jouy, Sans les femmes le commencement de notre vie seroit priv� de secours,
le milieu de plaisirs et la fin de consolation, more exactly express, in my opinion, the true
praise of woman than Schiller's poem, W�rde der Frauen, which is the fruit of much careful
thought and impressive because of its antithesis and use of contrast. The same thing is more
pathetically expressed by Byron in Sardanapalus, Act i, Sc. 2:--

                                "The very first
  Of human life must spring from woman's breast,
  Your first small words are taught you from her lips,
  Your first tears quench'd by her, and your last sighs
  Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,
  When men have shrunk from the ignoble care
  Of watching the last hour of him who led them."

Both passages show the right point of view for the appreciation of women.

One need only look at a woman's shape to discover that she is not intended for either too much
mental or too much physical work. She pays the debt of life not by what she does but by what
she suffers--by the pains of child-bearing, care for the child, and by subjection to man, to
whom she should be a patient and cheerful companion. The greatest sorrows and joys or great
exhibition of strength are not assigned to her; her life should flow more quietly, more gently,
and less obtrusively than man's, without her being essentially happier or unhappier. Consider
how a young girl will toy day after day with a child, dance with it and sing to it; and then
consider what a man, with the very best intentions in the world, could do in her place.

With girls, Nature has had in view what is called in a dramatic sense a "striking effect,"
for she endows them for a few years with a richness of beauty and a, fulness of charm at the
expense of the rest of their lives; so that they may during these years ensnare the fantasy
of a man to such a degree as to make him rush into taking the honourable care of them, in some
kind of form, for a lifetime--a step which would not seem sufficiently justified if he only
considered the matter. Accordingly, Nature has furnished woman, as she has the rest of her
creatures, with the weapons and implements necessary for the protection of her existence and
for just the length of time that they will be of service to her; so that Nature has proceeded
here with her usual economy. Just as the female ant after coition loses her wings, which then
become superfluous, nay, dangerous for breeding purposes, so for the most part does a woman
lose her beauty after giving birth to one or two children; and probably for the same reasons.

Then again we find that young girls in their hearts regard their domestic or other affairs
as secondary things, if not as a mere jest. Love, conquests, and all that these include, such
as dressing, dancing, and so on, they give their serious attention.

       *       *       *       *       *

The nobler and more perfect a thing is, the later and slower is it in reaching maturity. Man
reaches the maturity of his reasoning and mental faculties scarcely before he is eight-and-twenty;
woman when she is eighteen; but hers is reason of very narrow limitations. This is why women
remain children all their lives, for they always see only what is near at hand, cling to the
present, take the appearance of a thing for reality, and prefer trifling matters to the most
important. It is by virtue of man's reasoning powers that he does not live in the present only,
like the brute, but observes and ponders over the past and future; and from this spring discretion,
care, and that anxiety which we so frequently notice in people. The advantages, as well as
the disadvantages, that this entails, make woman, in consequence of her weaker reasoning powers,
less of a partaker in them. Moreover, she is intellectually short-sighted, for although her
intuitive understanding quickly perceives what is near to her, on the other hand her circle
of vision is limited and does not embrace anything that is remote; hence everything that is
absent or past, or in the future, affects women in a less degree than men. This is why they
have greater inclination for extravagance, which sometimes borders on madness. Women in their
hearts think that men are intended to earn money so that they may spend it, if possible during
their husband's lifetime, but at any rate after his death.

As soon as he has given them his earnings on which to keep house they are strengthened in this
belief. Although all this entails many disadvantages, yet it has this advantage--that a woman
lives more in the present than a man, and that she enjoys it more keenly if it is at all bearable.
This is the origin of that cheerfulness which is peculiar to woman and makes her fit to divert
man, and in case of need, to console him when he is weighed down by cares. To consult women
in matters of difficulty, as the Germans used to do in old times, is by no means a matter to
be overlooked; for their way of grasping a thing is quite different from ours, chiefly because
they like the shortest way to the point, and usually keep their attention fixed upon what lies
nearest; while we, as a rule, see beyond it, for the simple reason that it lies under our nose;
it then becomes necessary for us to be brought back to the thing in order to obtain a near
and simple view. This is why women are more sober in their judgment than we, and why they see
nothing more in things than is really there; while we, if our passions are roused, slightly
exaggerate or add to our imagination.

It is because women's reasoning powers are weaker that they show more sympathy for the unfortunate
than men, and consequently take a kindlier interest in them. On the other hand, women are inferior
to men in matters of justice, honesty, and conscientiousness. Again, because their reasoning
faculty is weak, things clearly visible and real, and belonging to the present, exercise a
power over them which is rarely counteracted by abstract thoughts, fixed maxims, or firm resolutions,
in general, by regard for the past and future or by consideration for what is absent and remote.
Accordingly they have the first and principal qualities of virtue, but they lack the secondary
qualities which are often a necessary instrument in developing it. Women may be compared in
this respect to an organism that has a liver but no gall-bladder.[9] So that it will be found
that the fundamental fault in the character of women is that they have no "sense of justice."
This arises from their deficiency in the power of reasoning already referred to, and reflection,
but is also partly due to the fact that Nature has not destined them, as the weaker sex, to
be dependent on strength but on cunning; this is why they are instinctively crafty, and have
an ineradicable tendency to lie. For as lions are furnished with claws and teeth, elephants
with tusks, boars with fangs, bulls with horns, and the cuttlefish with its dark, inky fluid,
so Nature has provided woman for her protection and defence with the faculty of dissimulation,
and all the power which Nature has given to man in the form of bodily strength and reason has
been conferred on woman in this form. Hence, dissimulation is innate in woman and almost as
characteristic of the very stupid as of the clever. Accordingly, it is as natural for women
to dissemble at every opportunity as it is for those animals to turn to their weapons when
they are attacked; and they feel in doing so that in a certain measure they are only making
use of their rights. Therefore a woman who is perfectly truthful and does not dissemble is
perhaps an impossibility. This is why they see through dissimulation in others so easily; therefore
it is not advisable to attempt it with them. From the fundamental defect that has been stated,
and all that it involves, spring falseness, faithlessness, treachery, ungratefulness, and so
on. In a court of justice women are more often found guilty of perjury than men. It is indeed
to be generally questioned whether they should be allowed to take an oath at all. From time
to time there are repeated cases everywhere of ladies, who want for nothing, secretly pocketing
and taking away things from shop counters.

       *       *       *       *       *

Nature has made it the calling of the young, strong, and handsome men to look after the propagation
of the human race; so that the species may not degenerate. This is the firm will of Nature,
and it finds its expression in the passions of women. This law surpasses all others in both
age and power. Woe then to the man who sets up rights and interests in such a way as to make
them stand in the way of it; for whatever he may do or say, they will, at the first significant
onset, be unmercifully annihilated. For the secret, unformulated, nay, unconscious but innate
moral of woman is: We are justified in deceiving those who, because they care a little for
us,--that is to say for the individual,--imagine they have obtained rights over the species.
The constitution, and consequently the welfare of the species, have been put into our hands
and entrusted to our care through the medium of the next generation which proceeds from us;
let us fulfil our duties conscientiously.

But women are by no means conscious of this leading principle in abstracto, they are only conscious
of it in concreto, and have no other way of expressing it than in the manner in which they
act when the opportunity arrives. So that their conscience does not trouble them so much as
we imagine, for in the darkest depths of their hearts they are conscious that in violating
their duty towards the individual they have all the better fulfilled it towards the species,
whose claim upon them is infinitely greater. (A fuller explanation of this matter may be found
in vol. ii., ch. 44, in my chief work, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung.)

Because women in truth exist entirely for the propagation of the race, and their destiny ends
here, they live more for the species than for the individual, and in their hearts take the
affairs of the species more seriously than those of the individual. This gives to their whole
being and character a certain frivolousness, and altogether a certain tendency which is fundamentally
different from that of man; and this it is which develops that discord in married life which
is so prevalent and almost the normal state.

It is natural for a feeling of mere indifference to exist between men, but between women it
is actual enmity. This is due perhaps to the fact that odium figulinum in the case of men,
is limited to their everyday affairs, but with women embraces the whole sex; since they have
only one kind of business. Even when they meet in the street, they look at each other like
Guelphs and Ghibellines. And it is quite evident when two women first make each other's acquaintance
that they exhibit more constraint and dissimulation than two men placed in similar circumstances.
This is why an exchange of compliments between two women is much more ridiculous than between
two men. Further, while a man will, as a rule, address others, even those inferior to himself,
with a certain feeling of consideration and humanity, it is unbearable to see how proudly and
disdainfully a lady of rank will, for the most part, behave towards one who is in a lower rank
(not employed in her service) when she speaks to her. This may be because differences of rank
are much more precarious with women than with us, and consequently more quickly change their
line of conduct and elevate them, or because while a hundred things must be weighed in our
case, there is only one to be weighed in theirs, namely, with which man they have found favour;
and again, because of the one-sided nature of their vocation they stand in closer relationship
to each other than men do; and so it is they try to render prominent the differences of rank.

It is only the man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual instinct that could give that stunted,
narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race the name of the fair sex; for the entire
beauty of the sex is based on this instinct. One would be more justified in calling them the
unaesthetic sex than the beautiful. Neither for music, nor for poetry, nor for fine art have
they any real or true sense and susceptibility, and it is mere mockery on their part, in their
desire to please, if they affect any such thing.

This makes them incapable of taking a purely objective interest in anything, and the reason
for it is, I fancy, as follows. A man strives to get direct mastery over things either by understanding
them or by compulsion. But a woman is always and everywhere driven to indirect mastery, namely
through a man; all her direct mastery being limited to him alone. Therefore it lies in woman's
nature to look upon everything only as a means for winning man, and her interest in anything
else is always a simulated one, a mere roundabout way to gain her ends, consisting of coquetry
and pretence. Hence Rousseau said, Les femmes, en g�n�ral, n'aiment aucun art, ne se connoissent
� aucun et n'ont aucun g�nie (Lettre � d'Alembert, note xx.). Every one who can see through
a sham must have found this to be the case. One need only watch the way they behave at a concert,
the opera, or the play; the childish simplicity, for instance, with which they keep on chattering
during the finest passages in the greatest masterpieces. If it is true that the Greeks forbade
women to go to the play, they acted in a right way; for they would at any rate be able to hear
something. In our day it would be more appropriate to substitute taceat mulier in theatro for
taceat mulier in ecclesia; and this might perhaps be put up in big letters on the curtain.

Nothing different can be expected of women if it is borne in mind that the most eminent of
the whole sex have never accomplished anything in the fine arts that is really great, genuine,
and original, or given to the world any kind of work of permanent value. This is most striking
in regard to painting, the technique of which is as much within their reach as within ours;
this is why they pursue it so industriously. Still, they have not a single great painting to
show, for the simple reason that they lack that objectivity of mind which is precisely what
is so directly necessary in painting. They always stick to what is subjective. For this reason,
ordinary women have no susceptibility for painting at all: for natura non facet saltum. And
Huarte, in his book which has been famous for three hundred years, Examen de ingenios para
las scienzias, contends that women do not possess the higher capacities. And further, it is
because they are philistines that modern society, to which they give the tone and where they
have sway, has become corrupted. As regards their position, one should be guided by Napoleon's
maxim, Les femmes n'ont pas de rang; and regarding them in other things, Chamfort says very
truly: Elles sont faites pour commercer avec nos faiblesses avec notre folie, mais non avec
notre raison. Il existe entre elles et les hommes des sympathies d'�piderme et tr�s-peu de
sympathies d'esprit d'�me et de caract�re. They are the sexus sequior, the second sex in every
respect, therefore their weaknesses should be spared, but to treat women with extreme reverence
is ridiculous, and lowers us in their own eyes. When nature divided the human race into two
parts, she did not cut it exactly through the middle! The difference between the positive and
negative poles, according to polarity, is not merely qualitative but also quantitative. And
it was in this light that the ancients and people of the East regarded woman; they recognised
her true position better than we, with our old French ideas of gallantry and absurd veneration,
that highest product of Christian-Teutonic stupidity. These ideas have only served to make
them arrogant and imperious, to such an extent as to remind one at times of the holy apes in
Benares, who, in the consciousness of their holiness and inviolability, think they can do anything
and everything they please.

In the West, the woman, that is to say the "lady," finds herself in a fausse position; for
woman, rightly named by the ancients sexus sequior, is by no means fit to be the object of
our honour and veneration, or to hold her head higher than man and to have the same rights
as he. The consequences of this fausse position are sufficiently clear. Accordingly, it would
be a very desirable thing if this Number Two of the human race in Europe were assigned her
natural position, and the lady-grievance got rid of, which is not only ridiculed by the whole
of Asia, but would have been equally ridiculed by Greece and Rome. The result of this would
be that the condition of our social, civil, and political affairs would be incalculably improved.
The Salic law would be unnecessary; it would be a superfluous truism. The European lady, strictly
speaking, is a creature who should not exist at all; but there ought to be housekeepers, and
young girls who hope to become such; and they should be brought up not to be arrogant, but
to be domesticated and submissive. It is exactly because there are ladies in Europe that women
of a lower standing, that is to say, the greater majority of the sex, are much more unhappy
than they are in the East. Even Lord Byron says (Letters and Papers, by Thomas Moore, vol.
ii. p. 399), Thought of the state of women under the ancient Greeks--convenient enough. Present
state, a remnant of the barbarism of the chivalric and feudal ages--artificial and unnatural.
They ought to mind home--and be well fed and clothed--but not mixed in society. Well educated,
too, in religion--but to read neither poetry nor politics--nothing but books of piety and cookery.
Music--drawing--dancing--also a little gardening and ploughing now and then. I have seen them
mending the roads in Epirus with good success. Why not, as well as hay-making and milking?

In our part of the world, where monogamy is in force, to marry means to halve one's rights
and to double one's duties. When the laws granted woman the same rights as man, they should
also have given her a masculine power of reason. On the contrary, just as the privileges and
honours which the laws decree to women surpass what Nature has meted out to them, so is there
a proportional decrease in the number of women who really share these privileges; therefore
the remainder are deprived of their natural rights in so far as the others have been given
more than Nature accords.

For the unnatural position of privilege which the institution of monogamy, and the laws of
marriage which accompany it, assign to the woman, whereby she is regarded throughout as a full
equivalent of the man, which she is not by any means, cause intelligent and prudent men to
reflect a great deal before they make so great a sacrifice and consent to so unfair an arrangement.
Therefore, whilst among polygamous nations every woman finds maintenance, where monogamy exists
the number of married women is limited, and a countless number of women who are without support
remain over; those in the upper classes vegetate as useless old maids, those in the lower are
reduced to very hard work of a distasteful nature, or become prostitutes, and lead a life which
is as joyless as it is void of honour. But under such circumstances they become a necessity
to the masculine sex; so that their position is openly recognised as a special means for protecting
from seduction those other women favoured by fate either to have found husbands, or who hope
to find them. In London alone there are 80,000 prostitutes. Then what are these women who have
come too quickly to this most terrible end but human sacrifices on the altar of monogamy? The
women here referred to and who are placed in this wretched position are the inevitable counterbalance
to the European lady, with her pretensions and arrogance. Hence polygamy is a real benefit
to the female sex, taking it as a whole. And, on the other hand, there is no reason why a man
whose wife suffers from chronic illness, or remains barren, or has gradually become too old
for him, should not take a second. Many people become converts to Mormonism for the precise
reasons that they condemn the unnatural institution of monogamy. The conferring of unnatural
rights upon women has imposed unnatural duties upon them, the violation of which, however,
makes them unhappy. For example, many a man thinks marriage unadvisable as far as his social
standing and monetary position are concerned, unless he contracts a brilliant match. He will
then wish to win a woman of his own choice under different conditions, namely, under those
which will render safe her future and that of her children. Be the conditions ever so just,
reasonable, and adequate, and she consents by giving up those undue privileges which marriage,
as the basis of civil society, alone can bestow, she must to a certain extent lose her honour
and lead a life of loneliness; since human nature makes us dependent on the opinion of others
in a way that is completely out of proportion to its value. While, if the woman does not consent,
she runs the risk of being compelled to marry a man she dislikes, or of shrivelling up into
an old maid; for the time allotted to her to find a home is very short. In view of this side
of the institution of monogamy, Thomasius's profoundly learned treatise, de Concubinatu, is
well worth reading, for it shows that, among all nations, and in all ages, down to the Lutheran
Reformation, concubinage was allowed, nay, that it was an institution, in a certain measure
even recognised by law and associated with no dishonour. And it held this position until the
Lutheran Reformation, when it was recognised as another means for justifying the marriage of
the clergy; whereupon the Catholic party did not dare to remain behindhand in the matter.

It is useless to argue about polygamy, it must be taken as a fact existing everywhere, the
mere regulation of which is the problem to be solved. Where are there, then, any real monogamists?
We all live, at any rate for a time, and the majority of us always, in polygamy. Consequently,
as each man needs many women, nothing is more just than to let him, nay, make it incumbent
upon him to provide for many women. By this means woman will be brought back to her proper
and natural place as a subordinate being, and the lady, that monster of European civilisation
and Christian-Teutonic stupidity, with her ridiculous claim to respect and veneration, will
no longer exist; there will still be women, but no unhappy women, of whom Europe is at present
full. The Mormons' standpoint is right.

In India no woman is ever independent, but each one stands under the control of her father
or her husband, or brother or son, in accordance with the law of Manu.

It is certainly a revolting idea that widows should sacrifice themselves on their husband's
dead body; but it is also revolting that the money which the husband has earned by working
diligently for all his life, in the hope that he was working for his children, should be wasted
on her paramours. Medium tenuere beati. The first love of a mother, as that of animals and
men, is purely instinctive, and consequently ceases when the child is no longer physically
helpless. After that, the first love should be reinstated by a love based on habit and reason;
but this often does not appear, especially where the mother has not loved the father. The love
of a father for his children is of a different nature and more sincere; it is founded on a
recognition of his own inner self in the child, and is therefore metaphysical in its origin.

In almost every nation, both of the new and old world, and even among the Hottentots, property
is inherited by the male descendants alone; it is only in Europe that one has departed from
this. That the property which men have with difficulty acquired by long-continued struggling
and hard work should afterwards come into the hands of women, who, in their want of reason,
either squander it within a short time or otherwise waste it, is an injustice as great as it
is common, and it should be prevented by limiting the right of women to inherit. It seems to
me that it would be a better arrangement if women, be they widows or daughters, only inherited
the money for life secured by mortgage, but not the property itself or the capital, unless
there lacked male descendants. Women should never have the free disposition of wealth, strictly
so-called, which they may inherit, such as capital, houses, and estates. They need a guardian
always; therefore they should not have the guardianship of their children under any circumstances
whatever. The vanity of women, even if it should not be greater than that of men, has this
evil in it, that it is directed on material things--that is to say, on their personal beauty
and then on tinsel, pomp, and show. This is why they are in their right element in society.
This it is which makes them inclined to be extravagant, especially since they possess little
reasoning power. Accordingly, an ancient writer says, Γυνη το συνολον ἐστι δαπανηρον φυσει.[10]
Men's vanity, on the other hand, is often directed on non-material advantages, such as intellect,
learning, courage, and the like. Aristotle explains in the Politics[11] the great disadvantages
which the Spartans brought upon themselves by granting too much to their women, by allowing
them the right of inheritance and dowry, and a great amount of freedom; and how this contributed
greatly to the fall of Sparta. May it not be that the influence of women in France, which has
been increasing since Louis XIII.'s time, was to blame for that gradual corruption of the court
and government which led to the first Revolution, of which all subsequent disturbances have
been the result? In any case, the false position of the female sex, so conspicuously exposed
by the existence of the "lady," is a fundamental defect in our social condition, and this defect,
proceeding from the very heart of it, must extend its harmful influence in every direction.

FOOTNOTES:

[9] Let me refer to what I have said in my treatise on The Foundation of Morals, �71.

[10] Brunck's Gnomici poetae graeci v. 115.

[11] Bk. I., ch. 9.

THINKING FOR ONESELF.

The largest library in disorder is not so useful as a smaller but orderly one; in the same
way the greatest amount of knowledge, if it has not been worked out in one's own mind, is of
less value than a much smaller amount that has been fully considered. For it is only when a
man combines what he knows from all sides, and compares one truth with another, that he completely
realises his own knowledge and gets it into his power. A man can only think over what he knows,
therefore he should learn something; but a man only knows what he has pondered.

A man can apply himself of his own free will to reading and learning, while he cannot to thinking.
Thinking must be kindled like a fire by a draught and sustained by some kind of interest in
the subject. This interest may be either of a purely objective nature or it may be merely subjective.
The latter exists in matters concerning us personally, but objective interest is only to be
found in heads that think by nature, and to whom thinking is as natural as breathing; but they
are very rare. This is why there is so little of it in most men of learning.

The difference between the effect that thinking for oneself and that reading has on the mind
is incredibly great; hence it is continually developing that original difference in minds which
induces one man to think and another to read. Reading forces thoughts upon the mind which are
as foreign and heterogeneous to the bent and mood in which it may be for the moment, as the
seal is to the wax on which it stamps its imprint. The mind thus suffers total compulsion from
without; it has first this and first that to think about, for which it has at the time neither
instinct nor liking.

On the other hand, when a man thinks for himself he follows his own impulse, which either his
external surroundings or some kind of recollection has determined at the moment. His visible
surroundings do not leave upon his mind one single definite thought as reading does, but merely
supply him with material and occasion to think over what is in keeping with his nature and
present mood. This is why much reading robs the mind of all elasticity; it is like keeping
a spring under a continuous, heavy weight. If a man does not want to think, the safest plan
is to take up a book directly he has a spare moment.

This practice accounts for the fact that learning makes most men more stupid and foolish than
they are by nature, and prevents their writings from being a success; they remain, as Pope
has said,

  "For ever reading, never to be read."--Dunciad iii. 194.

Men of learning are those who have read the contents of books. Thinkers, geniuses, and those
who have enlightened the world and furthered the race of men, are those who have made direct
use of the book of the world.

       *       *       *       *       *

Indeed, it is only a man's own fundamental thoughts that have truth and life in them. For it
is these that he really and completely understands. To read the thoughts of others is like
taking the remains of some one else's meal, like putting on the discarded clothes of a stranger.

The thought we read is related to the thought which rises in us, as the fossilised impress
of a prehistoric plant is to a plant budding out in spring.

       *       *       *       *       *

Reading is merely a substitute for one's own thoughts. A man allows his thoughts to be put
into leading-strings.

Further, many books serve only to show how many wrong paths there are, and how widely a man
may stray if he allows himself to be led by them. But he who is guided by his genius, that
is to say, he who thinks for himself, who thinks voluntarily and rightly, possesses the compass
wherewith to find the right course. A man, therefore, should only read when the source of his
own thoughts stagnates; which is often the case with the best of minds.

It is sin against the Holy Spirit to frighten away one's own original thoughts by taking up
a book. It is the same as a man flying from Nature to look at a museum of dried plants, or
to study a beautiful landscape in copperplate. A man at times arrives at a truth or an idea
after spending much time in thinking it out for himself, linking together his various thoughts,
when he might have found the same thing in a book; it is a hundred times more valuable if he
has acquired it by thinking it out for himself. For it is only by his thinking it out for himself
that it enters as an integral part, as a living member into the whole system of his thought,
and stands in complete and firm relation with it; that it is fundamentally understood with
all its consequences, and carries the colour, the shade, the impress of his own way of thinking;
and comes at the very moment, just as the necessity for it is felt, and stands fast and cannot
be forgotten. This is the perfect application, nay, interpretation of Goethe's

  "Was du ererbt von deinen V�tern hast
   Erwirb es um es zu besitzen."

The man who thinks for himself learns the authorities for his opinions only later on, when
they serve merely to strengthen both them and himself; while the book-philosopher starts from
the authorities and other people's opinions, therefrom constructing a whole for himself; so
that he resembles an automaton, whose composition we do not understand. The other man, the
man who thinks for himself, on the other hand, is like a living man as made by nature. His
mind is impregnated from without, which then bears and brings forth its child. Truth that has
been merely learned adheres to us like an artificial limb, a false tooth, a waxen nose, or
at best like one made out of another's flesh; truth which is acquired by thinking for oneself
is like a natural member: it alone really belongs to us. Here we touch upon the difference
between the thinking man and the mere man of learning. Therefore the intellectual acquirements
of the man who thinks for himself are like a fine painting that stands out full of life, that
has its light and shade correct, the tone sustained, and perfect harmony of colour. The intellectual
attainments of the merely learned man, on the contrary, resemble a big palette covered with
every colour, at most systematically arranged, but without harmony, relation, and meaning.

       *       *       *       *       *

Reading is thinking with some one else's head instead of one's own. But to think for oneself
is to endeavour to develop a coherent whole, a system, even if it is not a strictly complete
one. Nothing is more harmful than, by dint of continual reading, to strengthen the current
of other people's thoughts. These thoughts, springing from different minds, belonging to different
systems, bearing different colours, never flow together of themselves into a unity of thought,
knowledge, insight, or conviction, but rather cram the head with a Babylonian confusion of
tongues; consequently the mind becomes overcharged with them and is deprived of all clear insight
and almost disorganised. This condition of things may often be discerned in many men of learning,
and it makes them inferior in sound understanding, correct judgment, and practical tact to
many illiterate men, who, by the aid of experience, conversation, and a little reading, have
acquired a little knowledge from without, and made it always subordinate to and incorporated
it with their own thoughts.

The scientific thinker also does this to a much greater extent. Although he requires much knowledge
and must read a great deal, his mind is nevertheless strong enough to overcome it all, to assimilate
it, to incorporate it with the system of his thoughts, and to subordinate it to the organic
relative unity of his insight, which is vast and ever-growing. By this means his own thought,
like the bass in an organ, always takes the lead in everything, and is never deadened by other
sounds, as is the case with purely antiquarian minds; where all sorts of musical passages,
as it were, run into each other, and the fundamental tone is entirely lost.

       *       *       *       *       *

The people who have spent their lives in reading and acquired their wisdom out of books resemble
those who have acquired exact information of a country from the descriptions of many travellers.
These people can relate a great deal about many things; but at heart they have no connected,
clear, sound knowledge of the condition of the country. While those who have spent their life
in thinking are like the people who have been to that country themselves; they alone really
know what it is they are saying, know the subject in its entirety, and are quite at home in it.

       *       *       *       *       *

The ordinary book-philosopher stands in the same relation to a man who thinks for himself as
an eye-witness does to the historian; he speaks from his own direct comprehension of the subject.

Therefore all who think for themselves hold at bottom much the same views; when they differ
it is because they hold different points of view, but when these do not alter the matter they
all say the same thing. They merely express what they have grasped from an objective point
of view. I have frequently hesitated to give passages to the public because of their paradoxical
nature, and afterwards to my joyful surprise have found the same thoughts expressed in the
works of great men of long ago.

The book-philosopher, on the other hand, relates what one man has said and another man meant,
and what a third has objected to, and so on. He compares, weighs, criticises, and endeavours
to get at the truth of the thing, and in this way resembles the critical historian. For instance,
he will try to find out whether Leibnitz was not for some time in his life a follower of Spinoza,
etc. The curious student will find striking examples of what I mean in Herbart's Analytical
Elucidation of Morality and Natural Right, and in his Letters on Freedom. It surprises us that
such a man should give himself so much trouble; for it is evident that if he had fixed his
attention on the matter he would soon have attained his object by thinking a little for himself.

But there is a small difficulty to overcome; a thing of this kind does not depend upon our
own will. One can sit down at any time and read, but not--think. It is with thoughts as with
men: we cannot always summon them at pleasure, but must wait until they come. Thought about
a subject must come of its own accord by a happy and harmonious union of external motive with
mental temper and application; and it is precisely that which never seems to come to these people.

One has an illustration of this in matters that concern our personal interest. If we have to
come to a decision on a thing of this kind we cannot sit down at any particular moment and
thrash out the reasons and arrive at a decision; for often at such a time our thoughts cannot
be fixed, but will wander off to other things; a dislike to the subject is sometimes responsible
for this. We should not use force, but wait until the mood appears of itself; it frequently
comes unexpectedly and even repeats itself; the different moods which possess us at the different
times throwing another light on the matter. It is this long process which is understood by
a ripe resolution. For the task of making up our mind must be distributed; much that has been
previously overlooked occurs to us; the aversion also disappears, for, after examining the
matter closer, it seems much more tolerable than it was at first sight.

And in theory it is just the same: a man must wait for the right moment; even the greatest
mind is not always able to think for itself at all times. Therefore it is advisable for it
to use its spare moments in reading, which, as has been said, is a substitute for one's own
thought; in this way material is imported to the mind by letting another think for us, although
it is always in a way which is different from our own. For this reason a man should not read
too much, in order that his mind does not become accustomed to the substitute, and consequently
even forget the matter in question; that it may not get used to walking in paths that have
already been trodden, and by following a foreign course of thought forget its own. Least of
all should a man for the sake of reading entirely withdraw his attention from the real world:
as the impulse and temper which lead one to think for oneself proceed oftener from it than
from reading; for it is the visible and real world in its primitiveness and strength that is
the natural subject of the thinking mind, and is able more easily than anything else to rouse
it. After these considerations it will not surprise us to find that the thinking man can easily
be distinguished from the book-philosopher by his marked earnestness, directness, and originality,
the personal conviction of all his thoughts and expressions: the book-philosopher, on the other
hand, has everything second-hand; his ideas are like a collection of old rags obtained anyhow;
he is dull and pointless, resembling a copy of a copy. His style, which is full of conventional,
nay, vulgar phrases and current terms, resembles a small state where there is a circulation
of foreign money because it coins none of its own.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mere experience can as little as reading take the place of thought. Mere empiricism bears the
same relation to thinking as eating to digestion and assimilation. When experience boasts that
it alone, by its discoveries, has advanced human knowledge, it is as though the mouth boasted
that it was its work alone to maintain the body.

The works of all really capable minds are distinguished from all other works by a character
of decision and definiteness, and, in consequence, of lucidity and clearness. This is because
minds like these know definitely and clearly what they wish to express--whether it be in prose,
in verse, or in music. Other minds are wanting in this decision and clearness, and therefore
may be instantly recognised.

The characteristic sign of a mind of the highest standard is the directness of its judgment.
Everything it utters is the result of thinking for itself; this is shown everywhere in the
way it gives expression to its thoughts. Therefore it is, like a prince, an imperial director
in the realm of intellect. All other minds are mere delegates, as may be seen by their style,
which has no stamp of its own.

Hence every true thinker for himself is so far like a monarch; he is absolute, and recognises
nobody above him. His judgments, like the decrees of a monarch, spring from his own sovereign
power and proceed directly from himself. He takes as little notice of authority as a monarch
does of a command; nothing is valid unless he has himself authorised it. On the other hand,
those of vulgar minds, who are swayed by all kinds of current opinions, authorities, and prejudices,
are like the people which in silence obey the law and commands.

       *       *       *       *       *

The people who are so eager and impatient to settle disputed questions, by bringing forward
authorities, are really glad when they can place the understanding and insight of some one
else in the field in place of their own, which are deficient. Their number is legion. For,
as Seneca says, "Unusquisque mavult credere, quam judicare."

The weapon they commonly use in their controversies is that of authorities: they strike each
other with it, and whoever is drawn into the fray will do well not to defend himself with reason
and arguments; for against a weapon of this kind they are like horned Siegfrieds, immersed
in a flood of incapacity for thinking and judging. They will bring forward their authorities
as an argumentum ad verecundiam and then cry victoria.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the realm of reality, however fair, happy, and pleasant it may prove to be, we always move
controlled by the law of gravity, which we must be unceasingly overcoming. While in the realm
of thought we are disembodied spirits, uncontrolled by the law of gravity and free from penury.

This is why there is no happiness on earth like that which at the propitious moment a fine
and fruitful mind finds in itself.

       *       *       *       *       *

The presence of a thought is like the presence of our beloved. We imagine we shall never forget
this thought, and that this loved one could never be indifferent to us. But out of sight out
of mind! The finest thought runs the risk of being irrevocably forgotten if it is not written
down, and the dear one of being forsaken if we do not marry her.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are many thoughts which are valuable to the man who thinks them; but out of them only
a few which possess strength to produce either repercussion or reflex action, that is, to win
the reader's sympathy after they have been written down. It is what a man has thought out directly
for himself that alone has true value. Thinkers may be classed as follows: those who, in the
first place, think for themselves, and those who think directly for others. The former thinkers
are the genuine, they think for themselves in both senses of the word; they are the true philosophers;
they alone are in earnest. Moreover, the enjoyment and happiness of their existence consist
in thinking. The others are the sophists; they wish to seem, and seek their happiness in what
they hope to get from other people; their earnestness consists in this. To which of these two
classes a man belongs is soon seen by his whole method and manner. Lichtenberg is an example
of the first class, while Herder obviously belongs to the second.

       *       *       *       *       *

When one considers how great and how close to us the problem of existence is,--this equivocal,
tormented, fleeting, dream-like existence--so great and so close that as soon as one perceives
it, it overshadows and conceals all other problems and aims;--and when one sees how all men--with
a few and rare exceptions--are not clearly conscious of the problem, nay, do not even seem
to see it, but trouble themselves about everything else rather than this, and live on taking
thought only for the present day and the scarcely longer span of their own personal future,
while they either expressly give the problem up or are ready to agree with it, by the aid of
some system of popular metaphysics, and are satisfied with this;--when one, I say, reflects
upon this, so may one be of the opinion that man is a thinking being only in a very remote
sense, and not feel any special surprise at any trait of thoughtlessness or folly; but know,
rather, that the intellectual outlook of the normal man indeed surpasses that of the brute,--whose
whole existence resembles a continual present without any consciousness of the future or the
past--but, however, not to such an extent as one is wont to suppose.

And corresponding to this, we find in the conversation of most men that their thoughts are
cut up as small as chaff, making it impossible for them to spin out the thread of their discourse
to any length. If this world were peopled by really thinking beings, noise of every kind would
not be so universally tolerated, as indeed the most horrible and aimless form of it is.[12]
If Nature had intended man to think she would not have given him ears, or, at any rate, she
would have furnished them with air-tight flaps like the bat, which for this reason is to be
envied. But, in truth, man is like the rest, a poor animal, whose powers are calculated only
to maintain him during his existence; therefore he requires to have his ears always open to
announce of themselves, by night as by day, the approach of the pursuer.

SHORT DIALOGUE ON

THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF OUR TRUE BEING BY DEATH.

Thrasymachos. Tell me briefly, what shall I be after my death? Be clear and precise.

Philalethes. Everything and nothing.

Thras. That is what I expected. You solve the problem by a contradiction. That trick is played out.

Phil. To answer transcendental questions in language that is made for immanent knowledge must
assuredly lead to a contradiction.

Thras. What do you call transcendental knowledge, and what immanent? It is true these expressions
are known to me, for my professor used them, but only as predicates of God, and as his philosophy
had exclusively to do with God, their use was quite appropriate. For instance, if God was in
the world, He was immanent; if He was somewhere outside it, He was transcendent. That is clear
and comprehensible. One knows how things stand. But your old-fashioned Kantian doctrine is
no longer understood. There has been quite a succession of great men in the metropolis of German
learning----

Phil. (aside). German philosophical nonsense!

Thras.----such as the eminent Schleiermacher and that gigantic mind Hegel; and to-day we have
left all that sort of thing behind, or rather we are so far ahead of it that it is out of date
and known no more. Therefore, what good is it?

Phil. Transcendental knowledge is that which, going beyond the boundary of possible experience,
endeavours to determine the nature of things as they are in themselves; while immanent knowledge
keeps itself within the boundary of possible experience, therefore it can only apply to phenomena.
As an individual, with your death there will be an end of you. But your individuality is not
your true and final being, indeed it is rather the mere expression of it; it is not the thing-in-itself
but only the phenomenon presented in the form of time, and accordingly has both a beginning
and an end. Your being in itself, on the contrary, knows neither time, nor beginning, nor end,
nor the limits of a given individuality; hence no individuality can be without it, but it is
there in each and all. So that, in the first sense, after death you become nothing; in the
second, you are and remain everything. That is why I said that after death you would be all
and nothing. It is difficult to give you a more exact answer to your question than this and
to be brief at the same time; but here we have undoubtedly another contradiction; this is because
your life is in time and your immortality in eternity. Hence your immortality may be said to
be something that is indestructible and yet has no endurance--which is again contradictory,
you see. This is what happens when transcendental knowledge is brought within the boundary
of immanent knowledge; in doing this some sort of violence is done to the latter, since it
is used for things for which it was not intended.

Thras. Listen; without I retain my individuality I shall not give a sou for your immortality.

Phil. Perhaps you will allow me to explain further. Suppose I guarantee that you will retain
your individuality, on condition, however, that you spend three months in absolute unconsciousness
before you awaken.

Thras. I consent to that.

Phil. Well then, as we have no idea of time when in a perfectly unconscious state, it is all
the same to us when we are dead whether three months or ten thousand years pass away in the
world of consciousness. For in the one case, as in the other, we must accept on faith and trust
what we are told when we awake. Accordingly it will be all the same to you whether your individuality
is restored to you after the lapse of three months or ten thousand years.

Thras. At bottom, that cannot very well be denied.

Phil. But if, at the end of those ten thousand years, some one has quite forgotten to waken
you, I imagine that you would have become accustomed to that long state of non-existence, following
such a very short existence, and that the misfortune would not be very great. However, it is
quite certain that you would know nothing about it. And again, it would fully console you to
know that the mysterious power which gives life to your present phenomenon had never ceased
for one moment during the ten thousand years to produce other phenomena of a like nature and
to give them life.

Thras. Indeed! And so it is in this way that you fancy you can quietly, and without my knowing,
cheat me of my individuality? But you cannot cozen me in this way. I have stipulated for the
retaining of my individuality, and neither mysterious forces nor phenomena can console me for
the loss of it. It is dear to me, and I shall not let it go.

Phil. That is to say, you regard your individuality as something so very delightful, excellent,
perfect, and incomparable that there is nothing better than it; would you not exchange it for
another, according to what is told us, that is better and more lasting?

Thras. Look here, be my individuality what it may, it is myself,

  "For God is God, and I am I."

I--I--I want to exist! That is what I care about, and not an existence which has to be reasoned
out first in order to show that it is mine.

Phil. Look what you are doing! When you say, I--I--I want to exist you alone do not say this,
but everything, absolutely everything, that has only a vestige of consciousness. Consequently
this desire of yours is just that which is not individual but which is common to all without
distinction. It does not proceed from individuality, but from existence in general; it is the
essential in everything that exists, nay, it is that whereby anything has existence at all;
accordingly it is concerned and satisfied only with existence in general and not with any definite
individual existence; this is not its aim. It has the appearance of being so because it can
attain consciousness only in an individual existence, and consequently looks as if it were
entirely concerned with that. This is nothing but an illusion which has entangled the individual;
but by reflection, it can be dissipated and we ourselves set free. It is only indirectly that
the individual has this great longing for existence; it is the will to live in general that
has this longing directly and really, a longing that is one and the same in everything. Since,
then, existence itself is the free work of the will, nay, the mere reflection of it, existence
cannot be apart from will, and the latter will be provisionally satisfied with existence in
general, in so far, namely, as that which is eternally dissatisfied can be satisfied. The will
is indifferent to individuality; it has nothing to do with it, although it appears to, because
the individual is only directly conscious of will in himself. From this it is to be gathered
that the individual carefully guards his own existence; moreover, if this were not so, the
preservation of the species would not be assured. From all this it follows that individuality
is not a state of perfection but of limitation; so that to be freed from it is not loss but
rather gain. Don't let this trouble you any further, it will, forsooth, appear to you both
childish and extremely ridiculous when you completely and thoroughly recognise what you are,
namely, that your own existence is the universal will to live.

Thras. You are childish yourself and extremely ridiculous, and so are all philosophers; and
when a sedate man like myself lets himself in for a quarter of an hour's talk with such fools,
it is merely for the sake of amusement and to while away the time. I have more important matters
to look to now; so, adieu!

RELIGION.

A DIALOGUE.

Demopheles. Between ourselves, dear old friend, I am sometimes dissatisfied with you in your
capacity as philosopher; you talk sarcastically about religion, nay, openly ridicule it. The
religion of every one is sacred to him, and so it should be to you.

Philalethes. Nego consequentiam! I don't see at all why I should have respect for lies and
frauds because other people are stupid. I respect truth everywhere, and it is precisely for
that reason that I cannot respect anything that is opposed to it. My maxim is, Vigeat veritas,
et pereat mundus, the same as the lawyer's Fiat justitia, et pereat mundus. Every profession
ought to have an analogous device.

Demop. Then that of the medical profession would be, Fiant pilulae, et pereat mundus, which
would be the easiest to carry out.

Phil. Heaven forbid! Everything must be taken cum grano salis.

Demop. Exactly; and it is just for that reason that I want you to accept religion cum grano
salis, and to see that the needs of the people must be met according to their powers of comprehension.
Religion affords the only means of proclaiming and making the masses of crude minds and awkward
intelligences, sunk in petty pursuits and material work, feel the high import of life. For
the ordinary type of man, primarily, has no thought for anything else but what satisfies his
physical needs and longings, and accordingly affords him a little amusement and pastime. Founders
of religion and philosophers come into the world to shake him out of his torpidity and show
him the high significance of existence: philosophers for the few, the emancipated; founders
of religion for the many, humanity at large. For φιλοσοφον πληθος ἀδυνατον εἰναι, as your friend
Plato has said, and you should not forget it. Religion is the metaphysics of the people, which
by all means they must keep; and hence it must be eternally respected, for to discredit it
means taking it away. Just as there is popular poetry, popular wisdom in proverbs, so too there
must be popular metaphysics; for mankind requires most certainly an interpretation of life,
and it must be in keeping with its power of comprehension. So that this interpretation is at
all times an allegorical investiture of the truth, and it fulfils, as far as practical life
and our feelings are concerned--that is to say, as a guidance in our affairs, and as a comfort
and consolation in suffering and death--perhaps just as much as truth itself could, if we possessed
it. Don't be hurt at its unpolished, baroque, and apparently absurd form, for you, with your
education and learning, cannot imagine the roundabout ways that must be used in order to make
people in their crude state understand deep truths. The various religions are only various
forms in which the people grasp and understand the truth, which in itself they could not grasp,
and which is inseparable from these forms. Therefore, my dear fellow, don't be displeased if
I tell you that to ridicule these forms is both narrow-minded and unjust.

Phil. But is it not equally narrow-minded and unjust to require that there shall be no other
metaphysics but this one cut out to meet the needs and comprehension of the people? that its
teachings shall be the boundary of human researches and the standard of all thought, so that
the metaphysics of the few, the emancipated, as you call them, must aim at confirming, strengthening,
and interpreting the metaphysics of the people? That is, that the highest faculties of the
human mind must remain unused and undeveloped, nay, be nipped in the bud, so that their activity
may not thwart the popular metaphysics? And at bottom are not the claims that religion makes
just the same? Is it right to have tolerance, nay, gentle forbearance, preached by what is
intolerance and cruelty itself? Let me remind you of the heretical tribunals, inquisitions,
religious wars and crusades, of Socrates' cup of poison, of Bruno's and Vanini's death in the
flames. And is all this to-day something belonging to the past? What can stand more in the
way of genuine philosophical effort, honest inquiry after truth, the noblest calling of the
noblest of mankind, than this conventional system of metaphysics invested with a monopoly from
the State, whose principles are inculcated so earnestly, deeply, and firmly into every head
in earliest youth as to make them, unless the mind is of miraculous elasticity, become ineradicable?
The result is that the basis of healthy reasoning is once and for all deranged--in other words,
its feeble capacity for thinking for itself, and for unbiassed judgment in regard to everything
to which it might be applied, is for ever paralysed and ruined.

Demop, Which really means that the people have gained a conviction which they will not give
up in order to accept yours in its place.

Phil. Ah! if it were only conviction based on insight, one would then be able to bring forward
arguments and fight the battle with equal weapons. But religions admittedly do not lend themselves
to conviction after argument has been brought to bear, but to belief as brought about by revelation.
The capacity for belief is strongest in childhood; therefore one is most careful to take possession
of this tender age. It is much more through this than through threats and reports of miracles
that the doctrines of belief take root. If in early childhood certain fundamental views and
doctrines are preached with unusual solemnity and in a manner of great earnestness, the like
of which has never been seen before, and if, too, the possibility of a doubt about them is
either completely ignored or only touched upon in order to show that doubt is the first step
to everlasting perdition; the result is that the impression will be so profound that, as a
rule, that is to say in almost every case, a man will be almost as incapable of doubting the
truth of those doctrines as he is of doubting his own existence. Hence it is scarcely one in
many thousands that has the strength of mind to honestly and seriously ask himself--is that
true? Those who are able to do this have been more appropriately styled strong minds, esprits
forts, than is imagined. For the commonplace mind, however, there is nothing so absurd or revolting
but what, if inoculated in this way, the firmest belief in it will take root. If, for example,
the killing of a heretic or an infidel were an essential matter for the future salvation of
the soul, almost every one would make it the principal object of his life, and in dying get
consolation and strength from the remembrance of his having succeeded; just as, in truth, in
former times almost every Spaniard looked upon an auto da f� as the most pious of acts and
one most pleasing to God.

We have an analogy to this in India in the Thugs, a religious body quite recently suppressed
by the English, who executed numbers of them. They showed their regard for religion and veneration
for the goddess Kali by assassinating at every opportunity their own friends and fellow-travellers,
so that they might obtain their possessions, and they were seriously convinced that thereby
they had accomplished something that was praiseworthy and would contribute to their eternal
welfare. The power of religious dogma, that has been inculcated early, is so great that it
destroys conscience, and finally all compassion and sense of humanity. But if you wish to see
with your own eyes, and close at hand, what early inoculation of belief does, look at the English.
Look at this nation, favoured by nature before all others, endowed before all others with reason,
intelligence, power of judgment, and firmness of character; look at these people degraded,
nay, made despicable among all others by their stupid ecclesiastical superstition, which among
their other capacities appears like a fixed idea, a monomania. For this they have to thank
the clergy in whose hands education is, and who take care to inculcate all the articles, of
belief at the earliest age in such a way as to result in a kind of partial paralysis of the
brain; this then shows itself throughout their whole life in a silly bigotry, making even extremely
intelligent and capable people among them degrade themselves so that they become quite an enigma
to us. If we consider how essential to such a masterpiece is inoculation of belief in the tender
age of childhood, the system of missions appears no longer merely as the height of human importunity,
arrogance, and impertinence, but also of absurdity; in so far as it does not confine itself
to people who are still in the stage of childhood, such as the Hottentots, Kaffirs, South Sea
Islanders, and others like them, among whom it has been really successful. While, on the other
hand, in India the Brahmans receive the doctrines of missionaries either with a smile of condescending
approval or refuse them with a shrug of their shoulders; and among these people in general,
notwithstanding the most favourable circumstances, the missionaries' attempts at conversion
are usually wrecked. An authentic report in vol. xxi. of the Asiatic Journal of 1826 shows
that after so many years of missionary activity in the whole of India (of which the English
possessions alone amount to one hundred and fifteen million inhabitants) there are not more
than three hundred living converts to be found; and at the same time it is admitted that the
Christian converts are distinguished for their extreme immorality. There are only three hundred
venal and bribed souls out of so many millions. I cannot see that it has gone better with Christianity
in India since then, although the missionaries are now trying, contrary to agreement, to work
on the children's minds in schools exclusively devoted to secular English instruction, in order
to smuggle in Christianity, against which, however, the Hindoos are most jealously on their
guard. For, as has been said, childhood is the time, and not manhood, to sow the seeds of belief,
especially where an earlier belief has taken root. An acquired conviction, however, that is
assumed by matured converts serves, generally, as only the mask for some kind of personal interest.
And it is the feeling that this could hardly be otherwise that makes a man, who changes his
religion at maturity, despised by most people everywhere; a fact which reveals that they do
not regard religion as a matter of reasoned conviction but merely as a belief inoculated in
early childhood, before it has been put to any test. That they are right in looking at religion
in this way is to be gathered from the fact that it is not only the blind, credulous masses,
but also the clergy of every religion, who, as such, have studied its sources, arguments, dogmas
and differences, who cling faithfully and zealously as a body to the religion of their fatherland;
consequently it is the rarest thing in the world for a priest to change from one religion or
creed to another. For instance, we see that the Catholic clergy are absolutely convinced of
the truth of all the principles of their Church, and that the Protestants are also of theirs,
and that both defend the principles of their confession with like zeal. And yet the conviction
is the outcome merely of the country in which each is born: the truth of the Catholic dogma
is perfectly clear to the clergy of South Germany, the Protestant to the clergy of North Germany.
If, therefore, these convictions rest on objective reasons, these reasons must be climatic
and thrive like plants, some only here, some only there. The masses everywhere, however, accept
on trust and faith the convictions of those who are locally convinced.

Demop. That doesn't matter, for essentially it makes no difference. For instance, Protestantism
in reality is more suited to the north, Catholicism to the south.

Phil. So it appears. Still, I take a higher point of view, and have before me a more important
object, namely, the progress of the knowledge of truth among the human race. It is a frightful
condition of things that, wherever a man is born, certain propositions are inculcated in his
earliest youth, and he is assured that under penalty of forfeiting eternal salvation he may
never entertain any doubt about them; in so far, that is, as they are propositions which influence
the foundation of all our other knowledge and accordingly decide for ever our point of view,
and if they are false, upset it for ever. Further, as the influences drawn from these propositions
make inroads everywhere into the entire system of our knowledge, the whole of human knowledge
is through and through affected by them. This is proved by every literature, and most conspicuously
by that of the Middle Age, but also, in too great an extent, by that of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. We see how paralysed even the minds of the first rank of all those epochs were by
such false fundamental conceptions; and how especially all insight into the true substance
and working of Nature was hemmed in on every side. During the whole of the Christian period
Theism lay like a kind of oppressive nightmare on all intellectual effort, and on philosophical
effort in particular, hindering and arresting all progress. For the men of learning of those
epochs, God, devil, angels, demons, hid the whole of Nature; no investigation was carried out
to the end, no matter sifted to the bottom; everything that was beyond the most obvious causal
nexus was immediately attributed to these; so that, as Pomponatius expressed himself at the
time, Certe philosophi nihil verisimile habent ad haec, quare necesse est, ad Deum, ad angelos
et daemones recurrere. It is true that there is a suspicion of irony in what this man says,
as his malice in other ways is known, nevertheless he has expressed the general way of thinking
of his age. If any one, on the other hand, possessed that rare elasticity of mind which alone
enabled him to free himself from the fetters, his writings, and he himself with them, were
burnt; as happened to Bruno and Vanini. But how absolutely paralysed the ordinary mind is by
that early metaphysical preparation may be seen most strikingly, and from its most ridiculous
side, when it undertakes to criticise the doctrines of a foreign belief. One finds the ordinary
man, as a rule, merely trying to carefully prove that the dogmas of the foreign belief do not
agree with those of his own; he labours to explain that not only do they not say the same,
but certainly do not mean the same thing as his. With that he fancies in his simplicity that
he has proved the falsity of the doctrines of the alien belief. It really never occurs to him
to ask the question which of the two is right; but his own articles of belief are to him as
� priori certain principles. The Rev. Mr. Morrison has furnished an amusing example of this
kind in vol. xx. of the Asiatic Journal wherein he criticises the religion and philosophy of
the Chinese.

Demop. So that's your higher point of view. But I assure you that there is a higher still.
Primum vivere, deinde philosophari is of more comprehensive significance than one supposes
at first sight. Before everything else, the raw and wicked tendencies of the masses ought to
be restrained, in order to protect them from doing anything that is extremely unjust, or committing
cruel, violent, and disgraceful deeds. If one waited until they recognised and grasped the
truth one would assuredly come too late. And supposing they had already found truth, it would
surpass their powers of comprehension. In any case it would be a mere allegorical investiture
of truth, a parable, or a myth that would be of any good to them. There must be, as Kant has
said, a public standard of right and virtue, nay, this must at all times flutter high. It is
all the same in the end what kind of heraldic figures are represented on it, if they only indicate
what is meant. Such an allegorical truth is at all times and everywhere, for mankind at large,
a beneficial substitute for an eternally unattainable truth, and in general, for a philosophy
which it can never grasp; to say nothing of its changing its form daily, and not having as
yet attained any kind of general recognition. Therefore practical aims, my good Philalethes,
have in every way the advantage of theoretical.

Phil. This closely resembles the ancient advice of Timaeus of Locrus, the Pythagorean: τας
ψυχας ἀπειργομες ψευδεσι λογοις, εἰ κα μη ἀγηται ἀλαθεσι.[13] And I almost suspect that it
is your wish, according to the fashion of to-day, to remind me--

  "Good friend, the time is near
  When we may feast off what is good in peace."

And your recommendation means that we should take care in time, so that the waves of the dissatisfied,
raging masses may not disturb us at table. But the whole of this point of view is as false
as it is nowadays universally liked and praised; this is why I make haste to put in a protest
against it. It is false that state, justice, and law cannot be maintained without the aid of
religion and its articles of belief, and that justice and police regulations need religion
as a complement in order to carry out legislative arrangements. It is false if it were repeated
a hundred times. For the ancients, and especially the Greeks, furnish us with striking instantia
in contrarium founded on fact. They had absolutely nothing of what we understand by religion.
They had no sacred documents, no dogma to be learnt, and its acceptance advanced by every one,
and its principles inculcated early in youth. The servants of religion preached just as little
about morals, and the ministers concerned themselves very little about any kind of morality
or in general about what the people either did or left undone. No such thing. But the duty
of the priests was confined merely to temple ceremonies, prayers, songs, sacrifices, processions,
lustrations, and the like, all of which aimed at anything but the moral improvement of the
individual. The whole of their so-called religion consisted, and particularly in the towns,
in some of the deorum majorum gentium having temples here and there, in which the aforesaid
worship was conducted as an affair of state, when in reality it was an affair of police. No
one, except the functionaries engaged, was obliged in any way to be present, or even to believe
in it. In the whole of antiquity there is no trace of any obligation to believe in any kind
of dogma. It was merely any one who openly denied the existence of the gods or calumniated
them that was punished; because by so doing he insulted the state which served these gods;
beyond this every one was allowed to think what he chose of them. If any one wished to win
the favour of these gods privately by prayer or sacrifice he was free to do so at his own cost
and risk; if he did not do it, no one had anything to say against it, and least of all the
State. Every Roman had his own Lares and Penates at home, which were, however, at bottom nothing
more than the revered portraits of his ancestors. The ancients had no kind of decisive, clear,
and least of all dogmatically fixed ideas about the immortality of the soul and a life hereafter,
but every one in his own way had lax, vacillating, and problematical ideas; and their ideas
about the gods were just as various, individual, and vague. So that the ancients had really
no religion in our sense of the word. Was it for this reason that anarchy and lawlessness reigned
among them? Is not law and civil order rather so much their work, that it still constitutes
the foundation of ours? Was not property perfectly secure, although it consisted of slaves
for the greater part? And did not this condition of things last longer than a thousand years?

So I cannot perceive, and must protest against the practical aims and necessity of religion
in the sense which you have indicated, and in such general favour to-day, namely, as an indispensable
foundation of all legislative regulations. For from such a standpoint the pure and sacred striving
after light and truth, to say the least, would seem quixotic and criminal if it should venture
in its feeling of justice to denounce the authoritative belief as a usurper who has taken possession
of the throne of truth and maintained it by continuing the deception.

Demop. But religion is not opposed to truth; for it itself teaches truth. Only it must not
allow truth to appear in its naked form, because its sphere of activity is not a narrow auditory,
but the world and humanity at large, and therefore it must conform to the requirements and
comprehension of so great and mixed a public; or, to use a medical simile, it must not present
it pure, but must as a medium make use of a mythical vehicle. Truth may also be compared in
this respect to certain chemical stuffs which in themselves are gaseous, but which for official
uses, as also for preservation or transmission, must be bound to a firm, palpable base, because
they would otherwise volatilise. For example, chlorine is for all such purposes applied only
in the form of chlorides. But if truth, pure, abstract, and free from anything of a mythical
nature, is always to remain unattainable by us all, philosophers included, it might be compared
to fluorine, which cannot be presented by itself alone, but only when combined with other stuffs.
Or, to take a simpler simile, truth, which cannot be expressed in any other way than by myth
and allegory, is like water that cannot be transported without a vessel; but philosophers,
who insist upon possessing it pure, are like a person who breaks the vessel in order to get
the water by itself. This is perhaps a true analogy. At any rate, religion is truth allegorically
and mythically expressed, and thereby made possible and digestible to mankind at large. For
mankind could by no means digest it pure and unadulterated, just as we cannot live in pure
oxygen but require an addition of four-fifths of nitrogen. And without speaking figuratively,
the profound significance and high aim of life can only be revealed and shown to the masses
symbolically, because they are not capable of grasping life in its real sense; while philosophy
should be like the Eleusinian mysteries, for the few, the elect.

Phil. I understand. The matter resolves itself into truth putting on the dress of falsehood.
But in doing so it enters into a fatal alliance. What a dangerous weapon is given into the
hands of those who have the authority to make use of falsehood as the vehicle of truth! If
such is the case, I fear there will be more harm caused by the falsehood than good derived
from the truth. If the allegory were admitted to be such, I should say nothing against it;
but in that case it would be deprived of all respect, and consequently of all efficacy. Therefore
the allegory must assert a claim, which it must maintain, to be true in sensu proprio while
at the most it is true in sensu allegorico. Here lies the incurable mischief, the permanent
evil; and therefore religion is always in conflict, and always will be with the free and noble
striving after pure truth.

Demop. Indeed, no. Care has been taken to prevent that. If religion may not exactly admit its
allegorical nature, it indicates it at any rate sufficiently.

Phil. And in what way does it do that?

Demop. In its mysteries. Mystery is at bottom only the theological terminus technicus for religious
allegory. All religions have their mysteries. In reality, a mystery is a palpably absurd dogma
which conceals in itself a lofty truth, which by itself would be absolutely incomprehensible
to the ordinary intelligence of the raw masses. The masses accept it in this disguise on trust
and faith, without allowing themselves to be led astray by its absurdity, which is palpable
to them; and thereby they participate in the kernel of the matter so far as they are able.
I may add as an explanation that the use of mystery has been attempted even in philosophy;
for example, when Pascal, who was pietest, mathematician, and philosopher in one, says in this
threefold character: God is everywhere centre and nowhere periphery. Malebranche has also truly
remarked, La libert� est un myst�re. One might go further, and maintain that in religions everything
is really mystery. For it is utterly impossible to impart truth in sensu proprio to the multitude
in its crudity; it is only a mythical and allegorical reflection of it that can fall to its
share and enlighten it. Naked truth must not appear before the eyes of the profane vulgar;
it can only appear before them closely veiled. And it is for this reason that it is unfair
to demand of a religion that it should be true in sensu proprio, and that, en passant. Rationalists
and Supernaturalists of to-day are so absurd. They both start with the supposition that religion
must be the truth; and while the former prove that it is not, the latter obstinately maintain
that it is; or rather the former cut up and dress the allegory in such a way that it could
be true in sensu proprio but would in that case become a platitude. The latter wish to maintain,
without further dressing, that it is true in sensu proprio, which, as they should know, can
only be carried into execution by inquisitions and the stake. While in reality, myth and allegory
are the essential elements of religion, but under the indispensable condition (because of the
intellectual limitations of the great masses) that it supplies enough satisfaction to meet
those metaphysical needs of mankind which are ineradicable, and that it takes the place of
pure philosophical truth, which is infinitely difficult, and perhaps never attainable.

Phil. Yes, pretty much in the same way as a wooden leg takes the place of a natural one. It
supplies what is wanting, does very poor service for it, and claims to be regarded as a natural
leg, and is more or less cleverly put together. There is a difference, however, for, as a rule,
the natural leg was in existence before the wooden one, while religion everywhere has gained
the start of philosophy.

Demop. That may be; but a wooden leg is of great value to those who have no natural leg. You
must keep in view that the metaphysical requirements of man absolutely demand satisfaction;
because the horizon of his thoughts must be defined and not remain unlimited. A man, as a rule,
has no faculty of judgment for weighing reasons, and distinguishing between what is true and
what is false. Moreover, the work imposed upon him by nature and her requirements leaves him
no time for investigations of that kind, or for the education which they presuppose. Therefore
it is entirely out of the question to imagine he will be convinced by reasons; there is nothing
left for him but belief and authority. Even if a really true philosophy took the place of religion,
at least nine-tenths of mankind would only accept it on authority, so that it would be again
a matter of belief; for Plato's φιλοσοφον πληθος ἀδυνατον εἰναι will always hold good. Authority,
however, is only established by time and circumstances, so that we cannot bestow it on that
which has only reason to commend it; accordingly, we must grant it only to that which has attained
it in the course of history, even if it is only truth represented allegorically. This kind
of truth, supported by authority, appeals directly to the essentially metaphysical temperament
of man--that is, to his need of a theory concerning the riddle of existence, which thrusts
itself upon him, and arises from the consciousness that behind the physical in the world there
must be a metaphysical, an unchangeable something, which serves as the foundation of constant
change. It also appeals to the will, fears, and hopes of mortals living in constant need; religion
provides them with gods, demons, to whom they call, appease, and conciliate. Finally, it appeals
to their moral consciousness, which is undeniably present, and lends to it that authenticity
and support from without--a support without which it would not easily maintain itself in the
struggle against so many temptations. It is exactly from this side that religion provides an
inexhaustible source of consolation and comfort in the countless and great sorrows of life,
a comfort which does not leave men in death, but rather then unfolds its full efficacy. So
that religion is like some one taking hold of the hand of a blind person and leading him, since
he cannot see for himself; all that the blind person wants is to attain his end, not to see
everything as he walks along.

Phil. This side is certainly the brilliant side of religion. If it is a fraus it is indeed
a pia fraus; that cannot be denied. Then priests become something between deceivers and moralists.
For they dare not teach the real truth, as you yourself have quite correctly explained, even
if it were known to them; which it is not. There can, at any rate, be a true philosophy, but
there can be no true religion: I mean true in the real and proper understanding of the word,
not merely in that flowery and allegorical sense which you have described, a sense in which
every religion would be true only in different degrees. It is certainly quite in harmony with
the inextricable admixture of good and evil, honesty and dishonesty, goodness and wickedness,
magnanimity and baseness, which the world presents everywhere, that the most important, the
most lofty, and the most sacred truths can make their appearance only in combination with a
lie, nay, can borrow strength from a lie as something that affects mankind more powerfully;
and as revelation must be introduced by a lie. One might regard this fact as the monogram of
the moral world. Meanwhile let us not give up the hope that mankind will some day attain that
point of maturity and education at which it is able to produce a true philosophy on the one
hand, and accept it on the other. Simplex sigillum veri: the naked truth must be so simple
and comprehensible that one can impart it to all in its true form without any admixture of
myth and fable (a pack of lies)--in other words, without masking it as religion.

Demop. You have not a sufficient idea of the wretched capacities of the masses.

Phil. I express it only as a hope; but to give it up is impossible. In that case, if truth
were in a simpler and more comprehensible form, it would surely soon drive religion from the
position of vicegerent which it has so long held. Then religion will have fulfilled her mission
and finished her course; she might then dismiss the race which she has guided to maturity and
herself retire in peace. This will be the euthanasia of religion. However, as long as she lives
she has two faces, one of truth and one of deceit. According as one looks attentively at one
or the other one will like or dislike her. Hence religion must be regarded as a necessary evil,
its necessity resting on the pitiful weak-mindedness of the great majority of mankind, incapable
of grasping the truth, and consequently when in extremity requires a substitute for truth.

Demop. Really, one would think that you philosophers had truth lying in readiness, and all
that one had to do was to lay hold of it.

Phil. If we have not got it, it is principally to be ascribed to the pressure under which philosophy,
at all periods and in all countries, has been held by religion. We have tried to make not only
the expression and communication of truth impossible, but even the contemplation and discovery
of it, by giving the minds of children in earliest childhood into the hands of priests to be
worked upon; to have the groove in which their fundamental thoughts are henceforth to run so
firmly imprinted, as in principal matters, to become fixed and determined for a lifetime. I
am sometimes shocked to see when I take into my hand the writings of even the most intelligent
minds of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and especially if I have just left my oriental
studies, how paralysed and hemmed in on all sides they are by Jewish notions. Prepared in this
way, one cannot form any idea of the true philosophy!

Demop. And if, moreover, this true philosophy were discovered, religion would not cease to
exist, as you imagine. There cannot be one system of metaphysics for everybody; the natural
differences of intellectual power in addition to those of education make this impossible. The
great majority of mankind must necessarily be engaged in that arduous bodily labour which is
requisite in order to furnish the endless needs of the whole race. Not only does this leave
the majority no time for education, for learning, or for reflection; but by virtue of the strong
antagonism between merely physical and intellectual qualities, much excessive bodily labour
blunts the understanding and makes it heavy, clumsy, and awkward, and consequently incapable
of grasping any other than perfectly simple and palpable matters. At least nine-tenths of the
human race comes under this category. People require a system of metaphysics, that is, an account
of the world and our existence, because such an account belongs to the most natural requirements
of mankind. They require also a popular system of metaphysics, which, in order for it to be
this, must combine many rare qualities; for instance, it must be exceedingly lucid, and yet
in the right places be obscure, nay, to a certain extent, impenetrable; then a correct and
satisfying moral system must be combined with its dogmas; above everything, it must bring inexhaustible
consolation in suffering and death. It follows from this that it can only be true in sensu
allegorico and not in sensu proprio. Further, it must have the support of an authority which
is imposing by its great age, by its general recognition, by its documents, together with their
tone and statements--qualities which are so infinitely difficult to combine that many a man,
if he stopped to reflect, would not be so ready to help to undermine a religion, but would
consider it the most sacred treasure of the people. If any one wants to criticise religion
he should always bear in mind the nature of the great masses for which it is destined, and
picture to himself their complete moral and intellectual inferiority. It is incredible how
far this inferiority goes and how steadily a spark of truth will continue to glimmer even under
the crudest veiling of monstrous fables and grotesque ceremonies, adhering indelibly, like
the perfume of musk, to everything which has come in contact with it. As an illustration of
this, look at the profound wisdom which is revealed in the Upanishads, and then look at the
mad idolatry in the India of to-day, as is revealed in its pilgrimages, processions, and festivities,
or at the mad and ludicrous doings of the Saniassi of the present time. Nevertheless, it cannot
be denied that in all this madness and absurdity there yet lies something that is hidden from
view, something that is in accordance with, or a reflection of the profound wisdom that has
been mentioned. It requires this kind of dressing-up for the great brute masses. In this antithesis
we have before us the two poles of humanity:--the wisdom of the individual and the bestiality
of the masses, both of which, however, find their point of harmony in the moral kingdom. Who
has not thought of the saying from the Kurral--"Vulgar people look like men; but I have never
seen anything like them." The more highly cultured man may always explain religion to himself
cum grano salis; the man of learning, the thoughtful mind, may, in secret, exchange it for
a philosophy. And yet one philosophy would not do for everybody; each philosophy by the laws
of affinity attracts a public to whose education and mental capacities it is fitted. So there
is always an inferior metaphysical system of the schools for the educated plebeians, and a
higher system for the �lite. Kant's lofty doctrine, for example, was degraded to meet the requirements
of the schools, and ruined by Fries, Krug, Salat, and similar people. In short, Goethe's dictum
is as applicable here as anywhere: One does not suit all. Pure belief in revelation and pure
metaphysics are for the two extremes; and for the intermediate steps mutual modifications of
both in countless combinations and gradations. The immeasurable differences which nature and
education place between men have made this necessary.

Phil. This point of view reminds me seriously of the mysteries of the ancients which you have
already mentioned; their aim at bottom seems to have lain in remedying the evil arising out
of the differences of mental capacities and education. Their plan was to single out of the
great multitude a few people, to whom the unveiled truth was absolutely incomprehensible, and
to reveal the truth to them up to a certain point; then out of these they singled out others
to whom they revealed more, as they were able to grasp more; and so on up to the Epopts. And
so we got μικρα, και μειζονα, και μεγιστα μυστηρια. The plan was based on a correct knowledge
of the intellectual inequality of mankind.

Demop. To a certain extent the education in our lower, middle, and high schools represents
the different forms of initiation into the mysteries.

Phil. Only in a very approximate way, and this only in so far as subjects of higher knowledge
were written about exclusively in Latin. But since that has ceased to be so all the mysteries
are profaned.

Demop. However that may be, I wish to remind you, in speaking of religion, that you should
grasp it more from the practical and less from the theoretical side. Personified metaphysics
may be religion's enemy, yet personified morality will be its friend. Perhaps the metaphysics
in all religions is false; but the morality in all is true. This is to be surmised from the
fact that in their metaphysics they contradict each other, while in their morality they agree.

Phil. Which furnishes us with a proof of the rule of logic, that a true conclusion may follow
from false premises.

Demop. Well, stick to your conclusion, and be always mindful that religion has two sides. If
it can't stand when looked at merely from the theoretical--in other words, from its intellectual
side, it appears, on the other hand, from the moral side as the only means of directing, training,
and pacifying those races of animals gifted with reason, whose kinship with the ape does not
exclude a kinship with the tiger. At the same time religion is, in general, a sufficient satisfaction
for their dull metaphysical needs. You appear to me to have no proper idea of the difference,
wide as the heavens apart, of the profound breach between your learned man, who is enlightened
and accustomed to think, and the heavy, awkward, stupid, and inert consciousness of mankind's
beasts of burden, whose thoughts have taken once and for all the direction of fear about their
maintenance, and cannot be put in motion in any other; and whose muscular power is so exclusively
exercised that the nervous power which produces intelligence is thereby greatly reduced. People
of this kind must absolutely have something that they can take hold of on the slippery and
thorny path of their life, some sort of beautiful fable by means of which things can be presented
to them which their crude intelligence could most certainly only understand in picture and
parable. It is impossible to approach them with subtle explanations and fine distinctions.
If you think of religion in this way, and bear in mind that its aims are extremely practical
and only subordinately theoretical, it will seem to you worthy of the highest respect.

Phil. A respect which would finally rest on the principle that the end sanctifies the means.
However, I am not in favour of a compromise on a basis of that sort. Religion may be an excellent
means of curbing and controlling the perverse, dull, and malicious creatures of the biped race;
in the eyes of the friend of truth every fraus, be it ever so pia, must be rejected. It would
be an odd way to promote virtue through the medium of lies and deception. The flag to which
I have sworn is truth. I shall remain faithful to it everywhere, and regardless of success,
I shall fight for light and truth. If I see religion hostile, I shall--

Demop. But you will not! Religion is not a deception; it is true, and the most important of
all truths. But because, as has already been said, its doctrines are of such a lofty nature
that the great masses cannot grasp them immediately; because, I say, its light would blind
the ordinary eye, does it appear concealed in the veil of allegory and teach that which is
not exactly true in itself, but which is true according to the meaning contained in it: and
understood in this way religion is the truth.

Phil. That would be very probable, if it were allowed to be true only in an allegorical sense.
But it claims to be exactly true, and true in the proper sense of the word: herein lies the
deception, and it is here that the friend of truth must oppose it.

Demop. But this deception is a conditio sine qua non. If religion admitted that it was merely
the allegorical meaning in its doctrines that was true, it would be deprived of all efficacy,
and such rigorous treatment would put an end to its invaluable and beneficial influence on
the morals and feelings of mankind. Instead of insisting on that with pedantic obstinacy, look
at its great achievements in a practical way both as regards morality and feelings, as a guide
to conduct, as a support and consolation to suffering humanity in life and death. How greatly
you should guard against rousing suspicion in the masses by theoretical wrangling, and thereby
finally taking from them what is an inexhaustible source of consolation and comfort to them;
which in their hard lot they need very much more than we do: for this reason alone, religion
ought not to be attacked.

Phil. With this argument Luther could have been beaten out of the field when he attacked the
selling of indulgences; for the letters of indulgence have furnished many a man with irreparable
consolation and perfect tranquillity, so that he joyfully passed away with perfect confidence
in the little packet of them which he firmly held in his hand as he lay dying, convinced that
in them he had so many cards of admission into all the nine heavens. What is the use of grounds
of consolation and peacefulness over which is constantly hanging the Damocles-sword of deception?
The truth, my friend, the truth alone holds good, and remains constant and faithful; it is
the only solid consolation; it is the indestructible diamond.

Demop. Yes, if you had truth in your pocket to bless us with whenever we asked for it. But
what you possess are only metaphysical systems in which nothing is certain but the headaches
they cost. Before one takes anything away one must have something better to put in its place.

Phil. I wish you would not continually say that. To free a man from error does not mean to
take something from him, but to give him something. For knowledge that something is wrong is
a truth. No error, however, is harmless; every error will cause mischief sooner or later to
the man who fosters it. Therefore do not deceive any one, but rather admit you are ignorant
of what you do not know, and let each man form his own dogmas for himself. Perhaps they will
not turn out so bad, especially as they will rub against each other and mutually rectify errors;
at any rate the various opinions will establish tolerance. Those men who possess both knowledge
and capacity may take up the study of philosophy, or even themselves advance the history of
philosophy.

Demop. That would be a fine thing! A whole nation of naturalised metaphysicians quarrelling
with each other, and eventualiter striking each other.

Phil. Well, a few blows here and there are the sauce of life, or at least a very slight evil
compared with priestly government--prosecution of heretics, plundering of the laity, courts
of inquisition, crusades, religious wars, massacres of St. Bartholomew, and the like. They
have been the results of chartered popular metaphysics: therefore I still hold that one cannot
expect to get grapes from thistles, or good from lies and deception.

Demop. How often must I repeat that religion is not a lie, but the truth itself in a mythical,
allegorical dress? But with respect to your plan of each man establishing his own religion,
I had still something to say to you, that a particularism like this is totally and absolutely
opposed to the nature of mankind, and therefore would abolish all social order. Man is an animal
metaphysicum--in other words, he has surpassingly great metaphysical requirements; accordingly
he conceives life above all in its metaphysical sense, and from that standpoint wishes to grasp
everything. Accordingly, odd as it may sound with regard to the uncertainty of all dogmas,
accord in the fundamental elements of metaphysics is the principal thing, in so much as it
is only among people who hold the same views on this question that a genuine and lasting fellowship
is possible. As a result of this, nations resemble and differ from each other more in religion
than in government, or even language. Consequently, the fabric of society, the State, will
only be perfectly firm when it has for a basis a system of metaphysics universally acknowledged.
Such a system, naturally, can only be a popular metaphysical one--that is, a religion. It then
becomes identified with the government, with all the general expressions of the national life,
as well as with all sacred acts of private life. This was the case in ancient India, among
the Persians, Egyptians, Jews, also the Greeks and Romans, and it is still the case among the
Brahman, Buddhist, and Mohammedan nations. There, are three doctrines of faith in China, it
is true, and the one that has spread the most, namely, Buddhism, is exactly the doctrine that
is least protected by the State; yet there is a saying in China that is universally appreciated
and daily applied, the three doctrines are only one--in other words, they agree in the main
thing. The Emperor confesses all three at the same time, and agrees with them all. Europe is
the confederacy of Christian States; Christianity is the basis of each of its members and the
common bond of all; hence Turkey, although it is in Europe, is really not to be reckoned in
it. Similarly the European princes are such "by the grace of God," and the Pope is the delegate
of God; accordingly, as his throne was the highest, he wished all other thrones to be looked
upon only as held in fee from him. Similarly Archbishops and Bishops, as such, had temporal
authority, just as they have still in England a seat and voice in the Upper House; Protestant
rulers are, as such, heads of their churches; in England a few years ago this was a girl of
eighteen. By the revolt from the Pope, the Reformation shattered the European structure, and,
in particular, dissolved the true unity of Germany by abolishing its common faith; this unity,
which had as a matter of fact come to grief, had accordingly to be replaced later by artificial
and purely political bonds. So you see how essentially connected is unity of faith with common
order and every state. It is everywhere the support of the laws and the constitution--that
is to say, the foundation of the social structure, which would stand with difficulty if faith
did not lend power to the authority of the government and the importance of the ruler.

Phil. Oh, yes, princes look upon God as a goblin, wherewith to frighten grown-up children to
bed when nothing else is of any avail; it is for this reason that they depend so much on God.
All right; meanwhile I should like to advise every ruling lord to read through, on a certain
day every six months, the fifteenth chapter of the First Book of Samuel, earnestly and attentively;
so that he may always have in mind what it means to support the throne on the altar. Moreover,
since burning at the stake, that ultima ratio theologorum, is a thing of the past, this mode
of government has lost its efficacy. For, as you know, religions are like glowworms: before
they can shine it must be dark. In Europe the day of knowledge and science dawned towards the
end of the fifteenth century with the arrival of the modern Greek philosophers, its sun rose
higher in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which were so productive, and scattered
the mists of the Middle Age. In the same proportion, both Church and Faith were obliged to
gradually disappear; so that in the eighteenth century English and French philosophers became
direct antagonists, until finally, under Frederick the Great, Kant came and took away from
religious belief the support it had formerly received from philosophy, and emancipated the
ancilla theologiae in that he attacked the question with German thoroughness and perseverance,
whereby it received a less frivolous, that is to say, a more earnest tone. As a result of this
we see in the nineteenth century Christianity very much weakened, almost stripped entirely
of serious belief, nay, fighting for its own existence; while apprehensive princes try to raise
it up by an artificial stimulant, as the doctor tries to revive a dying man by the aid of a
drug. There is a passage from Condorcet's Des Progr�s de l'esprit humain, which seems to have
been written as a warning to our epoch: Le z�le religieux des philosophes et des grands n'�tait
qu'une d�votion politique: et toute religion, qu'on se permet de d�fendre comme une croyance
qu'il est utile de laisser au peuple, ne peut plus esp�rer qu'une agonie plus ou moins prolong�e.
In the whole course of the events which I have pointed out you may always observe that belief
and knowledge bear the same relation to each other as the two scales of a balance: when the
one rises the other must fall. The balance is so sensitive that it indicates momentary influences.
For example, in the beginning of this century the predatory excursions of French robbers under
their leader Buonaparte, and the great efforts that were requisite to drive them out and to
punish them, had led to a temporary neglect of science, and in consequence to a certain decrease
in the general propagation of knowledge; the Church immediately began to raise her head again
and Faith to be revived, a revival partly of a poetical nature, in keeping with the spirit
of the times. On the other hand, in the more than thirty years' peace that followed, leisure
and prosperity promoted the building up of science and the spread of knowledge in an exceptional
degree, so that the result was what I have said, the dissolution and threatened fall of religion.
Perhaps the time which has been so often predicted is not far distant, when religion will depart
from European humanity, like a nurse whose care the child has outgrown; it is now placed in
the hands of a tutor for instruction. For without doubt doctrines of belief that are based
only on authority, miracles, and revelation are only of use and suitable to the childhood of
humanity. That a race, which all physical and historical data confirm as having been in existence
only about a hundred times the life of a man sixty years old, is still in its first childhood
is a fact that every one will admit.

Demop. If instead of prophesying with undisguised pleasure the downfall of Christianity, you
would only consider how infinitely indebted European humanity is to it, and to the religion
which, after the lapse of some time, followed Christianity from its old home in the East! Europe
received from it a drift which had hitherto been unknown to it--it learnt the fundamental truth
that life cannot be an end-in-itself, but that the true end of our existence lies beyond it.
The Greeks and Romans had placed this end absolutely in life itself, so that, in this sense,
they may most certainly be called blind heathens. Correspondingly, all their virtues consist
in what is serviceable to the public, in what is useful; and Aristotle says quite na�vely,
"Those virtues must necessarily be the greatest which are the most useful to others" (ἀναγκη
δε μεγιστας εἰναι ἀρετας τας τοις ἀλλοις χρησιμωτατας, Rhetor. I. c. 9). This is why the ancients
considered love for one's country the greatest virtue, although it is a very doubtful one,
as it is made up of narrowness, prejudice, vanity, and an enlightened self-interest. Preceding
the passage that has just been quoted, Aristotle enumerates all the virtues in order to explain
them individually. They are Justice, Courage, Moderation, Magnificence (μεγαλοπρεπεια), Magnanimity,
Liberality, Gentleness, Reasonableness, and Wisdom. How different from the Christian virtues!
Even Plato, without comparison the most transcendental philosopher of pre-Christian antiquity,
knows no higher virtue than Justice; he alone recommends it unconditionally and for its own
sake, while all the other philosophers make a happy life--vita beata--the aim of all virtue;
and it is acquired through the medium of moral behaviour. Christianity released European humanity
from its superficial and crude absorption in an ephemeral, uncertain, and hollow existence.

Accordingly, Christianity does not only preach Justice, but the Love of Mankind, Compassion,
Charity, Reconciliation, Love of one's Enemies, Patience, Humility, Renunciation, Faith, and
Hope. Indeed, it went even further: it taught that the world was of evil and that we needed
deliverance; consequently it preached contempt of the world, self-denial, chastity, the giving
up of one's own will, that is to say, turning away from life and its phantom-like pleasures;
it taught further the healing power of suffering, and that an instrument of torture is the
symbol of Christianity, I willingly admit that this serious and only correct view of life had
spread in other forms throughout Asia thousands of years previously, independently of Christianity
as it is still; but this view of life was a new and tremendous revelation to European humanity.
For it is well known that the population of Europe consists of Asiatic races who, driven out
from their own country, wandered away, and by degrees hit upon Europe: on their long wanderings
they lost the original religion of their homes, and with it the correct view of life; and this
is why they formed in another climate religions for themselves which were somewhat crude; especially
the worship of Odin, the Druidic and the Greek religions, the metaphysical contents of which
were small and shallow. Meanwhile there developed among the Greeks a quite special, one might
say an instinctive, sense of beauty, possessed by them alone of all the nations of the earth
that have ever existed--a peculiar, fine, and correct sense of beauty, so that in the mouths
of their poets and in the hands of their artists, their mythology took an exceptionally beautiful
and delightful form. On the other hand, the earnest, true, and profound import of life was
lost to the Greeks and Romans; they lived like big children until Christianity came and brought
them back to the serious side of life.

Phil. And to form an idea of the result we need only compare antiquity with the Middle Age
that followed--that is, the time of Pericles with the fourteenth century. It is difficult to
believe that we have the same kind of beings before us. There, the finest development of humanity,
excellent constitutional regulations, wise laws, cleverly distributed offices, rationally ordered
freedom, all the arts, as well as poetry and philosophy, at their best; the creation of works
which after thousands of years have never been equalled and are almost works of a higher order
of beings, whom we can never approach; life embellished by the noblest fellowship, as is portrayed
in the Banquet of Xenophon. And now look at this side, if you can. Look at the time when the
Church had imprisoned the minds, and violence the bodies of men, whereby knights and priests
could lay the whole weight of life on the common beast of burden--the third estate. There you
have club-law, feudalism, and fanaticism in close alliance, and in their train shocking uncertainty
and darkness of mind, a corresponding intolerance, discord of faiths, religious wars, crusades,
persecution of heretics and inquisitions; as the form of fellowship, chivalry, an amalgam of
savagery and foolishness, with its pedantic system of absurd affectations, its degrading superstitions,
and apish veneration for women; the survival of which is gallantry, deservedly requited by
the arrogance of women; it affords to all Asiatics continual material for laughter, in which
the Greeks would have joined. In the golden Middle Age the matter went as far as a formal and
methodical service of women and enjoined deeds of heroism, cours d'amour, bombastic Troubadour
songs and so forth, although it is to be observed that these last absurdities, which have an
intellectual side, were principally at home in France; while among the material phlegmatic
Germans the knights distinguished themselves more by drinking and robbing. Drinking and hoarding
their castles with plunder were the occupations of their lives; and certainly there was no
want of stupid love-songs in the courts. What has changed the scene so? Migration and Christianity.

Demop. It is a good thing you reminded me of it. Migration was the source of the evil, and
Christianity the dam on which it broke. Christianity was the means of controlling and taming
those raw, wild hordes who were washed in by the flood of migration. The savage man must first
of all learn to kneel, to venerate, and to obey; it is only after that, that he can be civilised.
This was done in Ireland by St. Patrick, in Germany by Winifred the Saxon, who was a genuine
Boniface. It was migration of nations, this last movement of Asiatic races towards Europe,
followed only by their fruitless attempts under Attila, Gengis Khan, and Timur, and, as a comic
after-piece, by the gipsies: it was migration of nations which swept away the humanity of the
ancients. Christianity was the very principle which worked against this savagery, just as later,
through the whole of the Middle Age, the Church and its hierarchy were extremely necessary
to place a limit to the savagery and barbarism of those lords of violence, the princes and
knights: it was the ice-breaker of this mighty flood. Still, the general aim of Christianity
is not so much to make this life pleasant as to make us worthy of a better. It looks beyond
this span of time, this fleeting dream, in order to lead us to eternal salvation. Its tendency
is ethical in the highest sense of the word, a tendency which had hitherto been unknown in
Europe; as I have already pointed out to you by comparing the morality and religion of the
ancients with those of Christianity.

Phil. That is right so far as theory is concerned; but look at the practice. In comparison
with the Christian centuries that followed, the ancient world was undoubtedly less cruel than
the Middle Age, with its deaths by frightful torture, its countless burnings at the stake;
further, the ancients were very patient, thought very highly of justice, and frequently sacrificed
themselves for their country, showed traits of magnanimity of every kind, and such genuine
humanity, that, up to the present time, an acquaintance with their doings and thoughts is called
the study of Humanity. Religious wars, massacres, crusades, inquisitions, as well as other
persecutions, the extermination of the original inhabitants of America and the introduction
of African slaves in their place, were the fruits of Christianity, and among the ancients one
cannot find anything analogous to this, anything to counterpoise it; for the slaves of the
ancients, the familia, the vernae, were a satisfied race and faithfully devoted to their masters,
and as widely distinct from the miserable negroes of the sugar plantations, which are a disgrace
to humanity, as they were in colour. The censurable toleration of pederasty, for which one
chiefly reproaches the morality of the ancients, is a trifle compared with the Christian horrors
I have cited, and is not so rare among people of to-day as it appears to be. Can you then,
taking everything into consideration, maintain that humanity has really become morally better
by Christianity?

Demop. If the result has not everywhere corresponded with the purity and accuracy of the doctrine,
it may be because this doctrine has been too noble, too sublime for humanity, and its aim set
too high: to be sure, it was much easier to comply with heathen morality or with the Mohammedan.
It is precisely what is most elevated that is the most open to abuse and deception--abusus
optimi pessimus; and therefore those lofty doctrines have sometimes served as a pretext for
the most disgraceful transactions and veritable crimes. The downfall of the ancient institutions,
as well as of the arts and sciences of the old world, is, as has been said, to be ascribed
to the invasion of foreign barbarians. Accordingly, it was inevitable that ignorance and savagery
got the upper hand; with the result that violence and fraud usurped their dominion, and knights
and priests became a burden to mankind. This is partly to be explained by the fact that the
new religion taught the lesson of eternal and not temporal welfare, that simplicity of heart
was preferable to intellectual knowledge, and it was averse to all worldly pleasures which
are served by the arts and sciences. However, in so far as they could be made serviceable to
religion they were promoted, and so flourished to a certain extent.

Phil. In a very narrow sphere. The sciences were suspicious companions, and as such were placed
under restrictions; while fond ignorance, that element so necessary to the doctrines of faith,
was carefully nourished.

Demop. And yet what humanity had hitherto acquired in the shape of knowledge, and handed down
in the works of the ancients, was saved from ruin by the clergy, especially by those in the
monasteries. What would have happened if Christianity had not come in just before the migration
of nations?

Phil. It would really be an extremely useful inquiry if some one, with the greatest frankness
and impartiality, tried to weigh exactly and accurately the advantages and disadvantages derived
from religions. To do this, it would be necessary to have a much greater amount of historical
and psychological data than either of us has at our command. Academies might make it a subject
for a prize essay.

Demop. They will take care not to do that.

Phil. I am surprised to hear you say that, for it is a bad look-out for religion. Besides,
there are also academies which make it a secret condition in submitting their questions that
the prize should be given to the competitor who best understands the art of flattering them.
If we, then, could only get a statistician to tell us how many crimes are prevented yearly
by religious motives, and how many by other motives. There would be very few of the former.
If a man feels himself tempted to commit a crime, certainly the first thing which presents
itself to his mind is the punishment he must suffer for it, and the probability that he will
be punished; after that comes the second consideration, that his reputation is at stake. If
I am not mistaken, he will reflect by the hour on these two obstacles before religious considerations
ever come into his mind. If he can get away from these two first safeguards against crime,
I am convinced that religion alone will very rarely keep him back from it.

Demop. I believe, however, that it will do so very often; especially when its influence works
through the medium of custom, and thereby immediately makes a man shrink from the idea of committing
a crime. Early impressions cling to him. As an illustration of what I mean, consider how many
a man, and especially if he is of noble birth, will often, in order to fulfil some promise,
make great sacrifices, which are instigated solely by the fact that his father has often impressed
it upon him in childhood that "a man of honour, or a gentleman, or a cavalier, always keeps
his word inviolate."

Phil. And that won't work unless there is a certain innate probitas. You must not ascribe to
religion what is the result of innate goodness of character, by which pity for the one who
would be affected by the crime prevents a man from committing it. This is the genuine moral
motive, and as such it is independent of all religions.

Demop. But even this moral motive has no effect on the masses unless it is invested with a
religious motive, which, at any rate, strengthens it. However, without any such natural foundation,
religious motives often in themselves alone prevent crime: this is not a matter of surprise
to us in the case of the multitude, when we see that even people of good education sometimes
come under the influence, not indeed of religious motives, which fundamentally are at least
allegorically true, but of the most absurd superstitions, by which they are guided throughout
the whole of their lives; as, for instance, undertaking nothing on a Friday, refusing to sit
down thirteen at table, obeying chance omens, and the like: how much more likely are the masses
to be guided by such things. You cannot properly conceive the great limitations of the raw
mind; its interior is entirely dark, especially if, as is often the case, a bad, unjust, and
wicked heart is its foundation. Men like these, who represent the bulk of humanity, must be
directed and controlled meanwhile, as well as possible, even if it be by really superstitious
motives, until they become susceptible to truer and better ones. Of the direct effect of religion,
one may give as an instance a common occurrence in Italy, namely, that of a thief being allowed
to replace what he has stolen through the medium of his confessor, who makes this the condition
of his absolution. Then think of the case of an oath, where religion shows a most decided influence:
whether it be because a man places himself expressly in the position of a mere moral being,
and as such regards himself as solemnly appealed to,--as seems to be the case in France, where
the form of the oath is merely "je le jure"; and among the Quakers, whose solemn "yea" or "nay"
takes the place of the oath;--or whether it is because a man really believes he is uttering
something that will forfeit his eternal happiness,--a belief which is obviously only the investiture
of the former feeling. At any rate, religious motives are a means of awakening and calling
forth his moral nature. A man will frequently consent to take a false oath, but suddenly refuse
to do so when it comes to the point; whereby truth and right come off victorious.

Phil. But false oaths are still oftener sworn, whereby truth and right are trodden underfoot
with the clear knowledge of all the witnesses of the act. An oath is the jurist's metaphysical
pons asinorum, and like this should be used as seldom as ever possible. When it cannot be avoided,
it should be taken with great solemnity, always in the presence of the clergy--nay, even in
a church or in a chapel adjoining the court of justice.... This is precisely why the French
abstract formulary of the oath is of no value. By the way, you are right to cite the oath as
an undeniable example of the practical efficacy of religion. I must, in spite of everything
you have said, doubt whether the efficacy of religion goes much beyond this. Just think, if
it were suddenly declared by public proclamation that all criminal laws were abolished; I believe
that neither you nor I would have the courage to go home from here alone under the protection
of religious motives. On the other hand, if in a similar way all religions were declared to
be untrue; we would, under the protection of the laws alone, live on as formerly, without any
special increase in our fears and measures of precaution. But I will even go further: religions
have very frequently a decidedly demoralising influence. It may be said generally that duties
towards God are the reverse of duties towards mankind; and that it is very easy to make up
for lack of good behaviour towards men by adulation of God. Accordingly, we see in all ages
and countries that the great majority of mankind find it much easier to beg admission into
Heaven by prayers than to deserve it by their actions. In every religion it soon comes to be
proclaimed that it is not so much moral actions as faith, ceremonies, and rites of every kind
that are the immediate objects of the Divine will; and indeed the latter, especially if they
are bound up with the emoluments of the clergy, are considered a substitute for the former.
The sacrifice of animals in temples, or the saying of masses, the erection of chapels or crosses
by the roadside, are soon regarded as the most meritorious works; so that even a great crime
may be expiated by them, as also by penance, subjection to priestly authority, confessions,
pilgrimages, donations to the temple and its priests, the building of monasteries and the like;
until finally the clergy appear almost only as mediators in the corruption of the gods. And
if things do not go so far as that, where is the religion whose confessors do not consider
prayers, songs of praise, and various kinds of devotional exercise, at any rate, a partial
substitute for moral conduct? Look at England, for instance, where the audacious priestcraft
has mendaciously identified the Christian Sunday with the Jewish Sabbath, in spite of the fact
that it was ordained by Constantine the Great in opposition to the Jewish Sabbath, and even
took its name, so that Jehovah's ordinances for the Sabbath--i.e., the day on which the Almighty
rested, tired after His six days' work, making it therefore essentially the last day of the
week--might be conferred on the Christian Sunday, the dies solis, the first day of the week
which the sun opens in glory, the day of devotion and joy. The result of this fraud is that
in England "Sabbath breaking," or the "desecration of the Sabbath," that is, the slightest
occupation, whether it be of a useful or pleasurable nature, and any kind of game, music, knitting,
or worldly book, are on Sundays regarded as great sins. Must not the ordinary man believe that
if, as his spiritual guides impress upon him, he never fails in a "strict observance of the
holy Sabbath and a regular attendance on Divine Service,"--in other words, if he invariably
whiles away his time on a Sunday, and never fails to sit two hours in church to listen to the
same Litany for the thousandth time, and to babble it with the rest a tempo, he may reckon
on indulgence in here and there little sins which he at times allows himself? Those devils
in human form, the slave-owners and slave-traders in the Free States of North America (they
should be called the Slave States), are, in general, orthodox, pious Anglicans, who look upon
it as a great sin to work on Sundays; and confident in this, and their regular attendance at
church, they expect to gain eternal happiness. The demoralising influence of religion is less
problematical than its moral influence. On the other hand, how great and how certain that moral
influence must be to make amends for the horrors and misery which religions, especially the
Christian and Mohammedan religions, have occasioned and spread over the earth! Think of the
fanaticism, of the endless persecutions, the religious wars, that sanguinary frenzy of which
the ancients had no idea; then, think of the Crusades, a massacre lasting two hundred years,
and perfectly unwarrantable, with its war-cry, It is God's will, so that it might get into
its possession the grave of one who had preached love and endurance; think of the cruel expulsion
and extermination of the Moors and Jews from Spain; think of the massacres, of the inquisitions
and other heretical tribunals, the bloody and terrible conquests of the Mohammedans in three
different parts of the world, and the conquest of the Christians in America, whose inhabitants
were for the most part, and in Cuba entirely, exterminated; according to Las Casas, within
forty years twelve million persons were murdered--of course, all in majorem Dei gloriam, and
for the spreading of the Gospel, and because, moreover, what was not Christian was not looked
upon as human. It is true I have already touched upon these matters; but when in our day "the
Latest News from the Kingdom of God" is printed, we shall not be tired of bringing older news
to mind. And in particular, let us not forget India, that sacred soil, that cradle of the human
race, at any rate of the race to which we belong, where first Mohammedans, and later Christians,
were most cruelly infuriated against the followers of the original belief of mankind; and the
eternally lamentable, wanton, and cruel destruction and disfigurement of the most ancient temples
and images, still show traces of the monotheistic rage of the Mohammedans, as it was carried
on from Marmud the Ghaznevid of accursed memory, down to Aureng Zeb, the fratricide, whom later
the Portuguese Christians faithfully tried to imitate by destroying the temples and the auto
da f� of the inquisition at Goa. Let us also not forget the chosen people of God, who, after
they had, by Jehovah's express and special command, stolen from their old and faithful friends
in Egypt the gold and silver vessels which had been lent to them, made a murderous and predatory
excursion into the Promised Land, with Moses at their head, in order to tear it from the rightful
owners, also at Jehovah's express and repeated commands, knowing no compassion, and relentlessly
murdering and exterminating all the inhabitants, even the women and children (Joshua x., xi.);
just because they were not circumcised and did not know Jehovah, which was sufficient reason
to justify every act of cruelty against them. For the same reason, in former times the infamous
roguery of the patriarch Jacob and his chosen people against Hamor, King of Shalem, and his
people is recounted to us with glory, precisely because the people were unbelievers. Truly,
it is the worst side of religions that the believers of one religion consider themselves allowed
everything against the sins of every other, and consequently treat them with the utmost viciousness
and cruelty; the Mohammedans against the Christians and Hindoos; the Christians against the
Hindoos, Mohammedans, Americans, Negroes, Jews, heretics, and the like. Perhaps I go too far
when I say all religions; for in compliance with truth, I must add that the fanatical horrors,
arising from religion, are only perpetrated by the followers of the monotheistic religions,
that is, of Judaism and its two branches, Christianity and Islamism. The same is not reported
of the Hindoos and Buddhists, although we know, for instance, that Buddhism was driven out
about the fifth century of our era by the Brahmans from its original home in the southernmost
part of the Indian peninsula, and afterwards spread over the whole of Asia; yet we have, so
far as I know, no definite information of any deeds of violence, of wars and cruelties by which
this was brought about. This may, most certainly, be ascribed to the obscurity in which the
history of those countries is veiled; but the extremely mild character of their religion, which
continually impresses upon us to be forbearing towards every living thing, as well as the circumstance
that Brahmanism properly admits no proselytes by reason of its caste system, leads us to hope
that its followers may consider themselves exempt from shedding blood to any great extent,
and from cruelty in any form. Spence Hardy, in his excellent book on Eastern Monachism, p.
412, extols the extraordinary tolerance of the Buddhists, and adds his assurance that the annals
of Buddhism furnish fewer examples of religious persecution than those of any other religion.
As a matter of fact, intolerance is only essential to monotheism: an only god is by his nature
a jealous god, who cannot permit any other god to exist. On the other hand, polytheistic gods
are by their nature tolerant: they live and let live; they willingly tolerate their colleagues
as being gods of the same religion, and this tolerance is afterwards extended to alien gods,
who are, accordingly, hospitably received, and later on sometimes attain even the same rights
and privileges; as in the case of the Romans, who willingly accepted and venerated Phrygian,
Egyptian, and other foreign gods. Hence it is the monotheistic religions alone that furnish
us with religious wars, persecutions, and heretical tribunals, and also with the breaking of
images, the destruction of idols of the gods; the overthrowing of Indian temples and Egyptian
colossi, which had looked on the sun three thousand years; and all this because a jealous God
had said: "Thou shalt make no graven image," etc. To return to the principal part of the matter:
you are certainly right in advocating the strong metaphysical needs of mankind; but religions
appear to me to be not so much a satisfaction as an abuse of those needs. At any rate we have
seen that, in view of the progress of morality, its advantages are for the most part problematical,
while its disadvantages, and especially the enormities which have appeared in its train, are
obvious. Of course the matter becomes quite different if we consider the utility of religion
as a mainstay of thrones; for in so far as these are bestowed "by the grace of God," altar
and throne are closely related. Accordingly, every wise prince who loves his throne and his
family will walk before his people as a type of true religion; just as even Machiavelli, in
the eighteenth chapter of his book, urgently recommended religion to princes. Moreover, it
may be added that revealed religions are related to philosophy, exactly as the sovereigns by
the grace of God are to the sovereignty of the people; and hence the two former terms of the
parallel are in natural alliance.

Demop. Oh, don't adopt that tone! But consider that in doing so you are blowing the trumpet
of ochlocracy and anarchy, the arch-enemy of all legislative order, all civilisation, and all
humanity.

Phil. You are right. It was only a sophism, or what the fencing-master calls a feint. I withdraw
it therefore. But see how disputing can make even honest men unjust and malicious. So let us cease.

Demop. It is true I regret, after all the trouble I have taken, that I have not altered your
opinion in regard to religion; on the other hand, I can assure you that everything you have
brought forward has not shaken my conviction of its high value and necessity.

Phil. I believe you; for as it is put in Hudibras:

  "He that complies against his will
  Is of his own opinion still."

I find consolation, however, in the fact that in controversies and in taking mineral waters,
it is the after-effects that are the true ones.

Demop. I hope the after-effect may prove to be beneficial in your case.

Phil. That might be so if I could only digest a Spanish proverb.

Demop. And that is?

Phil. Detras de la cruz est� el Diablo.

Demop. Which means?

Phil Wait--"Behind the cross stands the devil."

Demop. Come, don't let us separate from each other with sarcasms, but rather let us allow that
religion, like Janus, or, better still, like the Brahman god of death, Yama, has two faces,
and like him, one very friendly and one very sullen. Each of us, however, has only fixed his
eyes on one.

Phil. You are right, old fellow.

[13] De Anim. Mundi, p. 104, d. Steph.

PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

Every animal, and especially man, requires, in order to exist and get on in the world, a certain
fitness and proportion between his will and his intellect. The more exact and true this fitness
and proportion are by nature, the easier, safer, and pleasanter it will be for him to get through
the world. At the same time, a mere approximation to this exact point will protect him from
destruction. There is, in consequence, a certain scope within the limits of exactness and fitness
of this so-called proportion. The normal proportion is as follows. As the object of the intellect
is to be the light and guide of the will on its path, the more violent, impetuous, and passionate
the inner force of the will, the more perfect and clear must be the intellect which belongs
to it; so that the ardent efforts of the will, the glow of passion, the vehemence of affection,
may not lead a man astray or drive him to do things that he has not given his consideration
or are wrong or will ruin him; which will infallibly be the case when a very strong will is
combined with a very weak intellect. On the other hand, a phlegmatic character, that is to
say, a weak and feeble will, can agree and get on with little intellect; a moderate will only
requires a moderate intellect. In general, any disproportion between the will and intellect--that
is to say, any deviation from the normal proportion referred to--tends to make a man unhappy;
and the same thing happens when the disproportion is reversed. The development of the intellect
to an abnormal degree of strength and superiority, thereby making it out of all proportion
to the will, a condition which constitutes the essence of true genius, is not only superfluous
but actually an impediment to the needs and purposes of life. This means that, in youth, excessive
energy in grasping the objective world, accompanied by a lively imagination and little experience,
makes the mind susceptible to exaggerated ideas and a prey even to chimeras; and this results
in an eccentric and even fantastic character. And when, later, this condition of mind no longer
exists and succumbs to the teaching of experience, the genius will never feel so much at home
or take up his position in the everyday world or in civic life, and move with the ease of a
man of normal intellect; indeed, he is often more apt to make curious mistakes. For the ordinary
mind is so perfectly at home in the narrow circle of its own ideas and way of grasping things
that no one can control it in that circle; its capacities always remain true to their original
purpose, namely, to look after the service of the will; therefore it applies itself unceasingly
to this end without ever going beyond it. While the genius, as I have stated, is at bottom
a monstrum per excessum; just as conversely the passionate, violent, and unintelligent man,
the brainless savage, is a monstrum per dejectum.

The will to live, which forms the innermost kernel of every living being, is most distinctly
apparent in the highest, that is to say in the cleverest, order of animals, and therefore in
them we may see and consider the nature of the will most clearly. For below this order of animals
the will is not so prominent, and has a less degree of objectivation; but above the higher
order of animals, I mean in men, we get reason, and with reason reflection, and with this the
faculty for dissimulation, which immediately throws a veil over the actions of the will. But
in outbursts of affection and passion the will exhibits itself unveiled. This is precisely
why passion, when it speaks, always carries conviction, whatever the passion may be; and rightly
so. For the same reason, the passions are the principal theme of poets and the stalking-horse
of actors. And it is because the will is most striking in the lower class of animals that we
may account for our delight in dogs, apes, cats, etc.; it is the absolute na�vet� of all their
expressions which charms us so much.

What a peculiar pleasure it affords us to see any free animal looking after its own welfare
unhindered, finding its food, or taking care of its young, or associating with others of its
kind, and so on! This is exactly what ought to be and can be. Be it only a bird, I can look
at it for some time with a feeling of pleasure; nay, a water-rat or a frog, and with still
greater pleasure a hedgehog, a weazel, a roe, or a deer. The contemplation of animals delights
us so much, principally because we see in them our own existence very much simplified.

There is only one mendacious creature in the world--man. Every other is true and genuine, for
it shows itself as it is, and expresses itself just as it feels. An emblematical or allegorical
expression of this fundamental difference is to be found in the fact that all animals go about
in their natural state; this largely accounts for the happy impression they make on us when
we look at them; and as far as I myself am concerned, my heart always goes out to them, particularly
if they are free animals. Man, on the other hand, by his silly dress becomes a monster; his
very appearance is objectionable, enhanced by the unnatural paleness of his complexion,--the
nauseating effect of his eating meat, of his drinking alcohol, his smoking, dissoluteness,
and ailments. He stands out as a blot on Nature. And it was because the Greeks were conscious
of this that they restricted themselves as far as possible in the matter of dress.

       *       *       *       *       *

Much that is attributed to force of habit ought rather to be put down to the constancy and
immutability of original, innate character, whereby we always do the same thing under the same
circumstances; which happens the first as for the hundredth time in consequence of the same
necessity. While force of habit, in reality, is solely due to indolence seeking to save the
intellect and will the work, difficulty, and danger of making a fresh choice; so that we are
made to do to-day what we did yesterday and have done a hundred times before, and of which
we know that it will gain its end.

But the truth of the matter lies deeper; for it can be explained more clearly than appears
at first sight. The power of inertia applied to bodies which may be moved by mechanical means
only, becomes force of habit when applied to bodies which are moved by motives. The actions
which we do out of sheer force of habit occur, as a matter of fact, without any individual
separate motive exercised for the particular case; hence we do not really think of them. It
was only when each action at first took place that it had a motive; after that it became a
habit; the secondary after-effect of this motive is the present habit, which is sufficient
to carry on the action; just as a body, set in motion by a push, does not need another push
in order to enable it to continue its motion; it will continue in motion for ever if it is
not obstructed in any way. The same thing applies to animals; training is a habit which is
forced upon them. The horse draws a cart along contentedly without being urged to do so; this
motion is still the effect of those lashes with the whip which incited him at first, but which
by the law of inertia have become perpetuated as habit. There is really something more in all
this than a mere parable; it is the identity of the thing in question, that is to say of the
will, at very different degrees of its objectivation, by which the same law of motion takes
such different forms.

Viva muchos a�os! is the ordinary greeting in Spain, and it is usual throughout the whole world
to wish people a long life. It is not a knowledge of what life is that explains the origin
of such a wish, but rather knowledge of what man is in his real nature: namely, the will to live.

The wish which every one has, that he may be remembered after his death, and which those people
with aspirations have for posthumous fame, seems to me to arise from this tenacity to life.
When they see themselves cut off from every possibility of real existence they struggle after
a life which is still within their reach, even if it is only an ideal--that is to say, an unreal
one.

We wish, more or less, to get to the end of everything we are interested in or occupied with;
we are impatient to get to the end of it, and glad when it is finished. It is only the general
end, the end of all ends, that we wish, as a rule, as far off as possible.

The deep sorrow we feel on the death of a friend springs from the feeling that in every individual
there is a something which we cannot define, which is his alone and therefore irreparable.
Omne individuum ineffabile. The same applies to individual animals. A man who has by accident
fatally wounded a favourite animal feels the most acute sorrow, and the animal's dying look
causes him infinite pain.

It is possible for us to grieve over the death of our enemies and adversaries, even after the

miss them as witnesses of our brilliant success.

That the sudden announcement of some good fortune may easily have a fatal effect on us is due
to the fact that our happiness and unhappiness depend upon the relation of our demands to what
we get; accordingly, the good things we possess, or are quite sure of possessing, are not felt
to be such, because the nature of all enjoyment is really only negative, and has only the effect
of annulling pain; whilst, on the other hand, the nature of pain or evil is really positive
and felt immediately. With the possession, or the certain prospect of it, our demands instantly
rise and increase our desire for further possession and greater prospects. But if the mind
is depressed by continual misfortune, and the claims reduced to a minimum, good fortune that
comes suddenly finds no capacity for its acceptance. Neutralised by no previous claims, it
now has apparently a positive effect, and accordingly its whole power is exercised; hence it
may disorganise the mind--that is to say, be fatal to it. This is why, as is well known, one
is so careful to get a man first to hope for happiness before announcing it, then to suggest
the prospect of it, then little by little make it known, until gradually all is known to him;
every portion of the revelation loses the strength of its effect because it is anticipated
by a demand, and room is still left for more. In virtue of all this, it might be said that
our stomach for good fortune is bottomless, but the entrance to it is narrow. What has been
said does not apply to sudden misfortunes in the same way. Since hope always resists them,
they are for this reason rarely fatal. That fear does not perform an analogous office in cases
of good fortune is due to the fact that we are instinctively more inclined to hope than to
fear; just as our eyes turn of themselves to light in preference to darkness.

       *       *       *       *       *

Hope is to confuse the desire that something should occur with the probability that it will.
Perhaps no man is free from this folly of the heart, which deranges the intellect's correct
estimation of probability to such a degree as to make him think the event quite possible, even
if the chances are only a thousand to one. And still, an unexpected misfortune is like a speedy
death-stroke; while a hope that is always frustrated, and yet springs into life again, is like
death by slow torture.

He who has given up hope has also given up fear; this is the meaning of the expression desperate.
It is natural for a man to have faith in what he wishes, and to have faith in it because he
wishes it. If this peculiarity of his nature, which is both beneficial and comforting, is eradicated
by repeated hard blows of fate, and he is brought to a converse condition, when he believes
that something must happen because he does not wish it, and what he wishes can never happen
just because he wishes it; this is, in reality, the state which has been called desperation.

That we are so often mistaken in others is not always precisely due to our faulty judgment,
but springs, as a rule as Bacon says, from intellectus luminis sicci non est, sec recipit infusionem
a voluntate et affectibus: for without knowing it, we are influenced for or against them by
trifles from the very beginning. It also often lies in the fact that we do not adhere to the
qualities which we really discover in them, but conclude from these that there are others which
we consider inseparable from, or at any rate incompatible with, them. For instance, when we
discern generosity, we conclude there is honesty; from lying we conclude there is deception;
from deception, stealing, and so on; and this opens the door to many errors, partly because
of the peculiarity of human nature, and partly because of the one-sidedness of our point of
view. It is true that character is always consistent and connected; but the roots of all its
qualities lies too deep to enable one to decide from special data in a given case which qualities
can, and which cannot exist together.

The use of the word person in every European language to signify a human individual is unintentionally
appropriate; persona really means a player's mask, and it is quite certain that no one shows
himself as he is, but that each wears a mask and plays a r�le. In general, the whole of social
life is a continual comedy, which the worthy find insipid, whilst the stupid delight in it greatly.

The ordinary man who has suffered injustice burns with a desire for revenge; and it has often
been said that revenge is sweet. This is confirmed by the many sacrifices made merely for the
sake of enjoying revenge, without any intention of making good the injury that one has suffered.
The centaur Nessus utilised his last moments in devising an extremely clever revenge, and the
fact that it was certain to be effective sweetened an otherwise bitter death. The same idea,
presented in a more modern and plausible way, occurs in Bertolotti's novel, Le due Sorelle
which has been translated into three languages. Walter Scott expresses mankind's proneness
to revenge in words as powerful as they are true: "Vengeance is the sweetest morsel to the
mouth that ever was cooked in hell!" I shall now attempt a psychological explanation of revenge.
All the suffering that nature, chance, or fate have assigned to us does not, ceteris paribus,
pain us so much as suffering which is brought upon us by the arbitrary will of another. This
is due to the fact that we regard nature and fate as the original rulers of the world; we look
upon what befalls us, through them, as something that might have befallen every one else. Therefore
in a case of suffering which arises from this source, we bemoan the fate of mankind in general
more than we do our own. On the other hand, suffering inflicted on us through the arbitrary
will of another is a peculiarly bitter addition to the pain or injury caused, as it involves
the consciousness of another's superiority, whether it be in strength or cunning, as opposed
to our own weakness. If compensation is possible, it wipes out the injury; but that bitter
addition, "I must submit to that from you," which often hurts more than the injury itself,
is only to be neutralised by vengeance. For by injuring the man who has injured us, whether
it be by force or cunning, we show our superiority, and thereby annul the proof of his. This
gives that satisfaction to the mind for which it has been thirsting. Accordingly, where there
is much pride or vanity there will be a great desire for revenge. But as the fulfilment of
every wish proves to be more or less a delusion, so is also the wish for revenge. The expected
enjoyment is mostly embittered by pity; nay, gratified revenge will often lacerate the heart
and torment the mind, for the motive which prompts the feeling of it is no longer active, and
what is left is the testimony of our wickedness.

Moroseness and melancholy are very opposite in nature; and melancholy is more nearly related
to happiness than to moroseness. Melancholy attracts; moroseness repels. Hypochondria not only
makes us unreasonably cross and angry over things concerning the present; not only fills us
with groundless fears of imaginative mishaps for the future; but also causes us to unjustly
reproach ourselves concerning our actions in the past.

Hypochondria causes a man to be always searching for and racking his brain about things that
either irritate or torment him. The cause of it is an internal morbid depression, combined
often with an inward restlessness which is temperamental; when both are developed to their
utmost, suicide is the result.

What makes a man hard-hearted is this, that each man has, or fancies he has, sufficient in
his own troubles to bear. This is why people placed in happier circumstances than they have
been used to are sympathetic and charitable. But people who have always been placed in happy
circumstances are often the reverse; they have become so estranged to suffering that they have
no longer any sympathy with it; and hence it happens that the poor sometimes show themselves
more benevolent than the rich.

On the other hand, what makes a man so very curious, as may be seen in the way he will spy
into other people's affairs, is boredom, a condition which is diametrically opposed to suffering;--though
envy also often helps in creating curiosity.

At times, it seems as though we wish for something, and at the same time do not wish for it,
so that we are at once both pleased and troubled about it. For instance, if we have to undergo
some decisive test in some affair or other, in which to come off victorious is of great importance
to us; we both wish that the time to be tested were here, and yet dread the idea of its coming.
If it happens that the time, for once in a way, is postponed, we are both pleased and sorry,
for although the postponement was unexpected, it, however, gives us momentary relief. We have
the same kind of feeling when we expect an important letter containing some decision of moment,
and it fails to come.

In cases like these we are really controlled by two different motives; the stronger but more
remote being the desire to stand the test, and to have the decision given in our favour; the
weaker, which is closer at hand, the desire to be left in peace and undisturbed for the present,
and consequently in further enjoyment of the advantage that hoping on in uncertainty has over
what might possibly be an unhappy issue. Consequently, in this case the same happens to our
moral vision as to our physical, when a smaller object near at hand conceals from view a bigger
object some distance away.

The course and affairs of our individual life, in view of their true meaning and connection,
are like a piece of crude work in mosaic. So long as one stands close in front of it, one cannot
correctly see the objects presented, or perceive their importance and beauty; it is only by
standing some distance away that both come into view. And in the same way one often understands
the true connection of important events in one's own life, not while they are happening, or
even immediately after they have happened, but only a long time afterwards.

Is this so, because we require the magnifying power of imagination, or because a general view
can only be got by looking from a distance? or because one's emotions would otherwise carry
one away? or because it is only the school of experience that ripens our judgment? Perhaps
all these combined. But it is certain that it is only after many years that we see the actions
of others, and sometimes even our own, in their true light. And as it is in one's own life,
so it is in history.

Why is it, in spite of all the mirrors in existence, no man really knows what he looks like,
and, therefore, cannot picture in his mind his own person as he pictures that of an acquaintance?
This is a difficulty which is thwarted at the very outset by gnothi sauton--know thyself.

This is undoubtedly partly due to the fact that a man can only see himself in the glass by
looking straight towards it and remaining quite still; whereby the play of the eye, which is
so important, and the real characteristic of the face is, to a great extent, lost. But co-operating
with this physical impossibility, there appears to be an ethical impossibility analogous to
it. A man cannot regard the reflection of his own face in the glass as if it were the face
of some one else--which is the condition of his seeing himself objectively. This objective
view rests with a profound feeling on the egoist's part, as a moral being, that what he is
looking at is not himself; which is requisite for his perceiving all his defects as they really
are from a purely objective point of view; and not until, then can he see his face reflected
as it really and truly is. Instead of that, when a man sees his own person in the glass the
egoistic side of him always whispers, It is not somebody else, but I myself, which has the
effect of a noli me tangere, and prevents his taking a purely objective view. Without the leaven
of a grain of malice, it does not seem possible to look at oneself objectively.

No one knows what capacities he possesses for suffering and doing until an opportunity occurs
to bring them into play; any more than he imagines when looking into a perfectly smooth pond
with a mirror-like surface, that it can tumble and toss and rush from rock to rock, or leap
as high into the air as a fountain;--any more than in ice-cold water he suspects latent warmth.

That line of Ovid's,

  "Pronaque cum spectent animalia cetera terram,"

is only applicable in its true physical sense to animals; but in a figurative and spiritual
sense, unfortunately, to the great majority of men too. Their thoughts and aspirations are
entirely devoted to physical enjoyment and physical welfare, or to various personal interests
which receive their importance from their relation to the former; but they have no interests
beyond these. This is not only shown in their way of living and speaking, but also in their
look, the expression of their physiognomy, their gait and gesticulations; everything about
them proclaims in terram prona! Consequently it is not to them, but only to those nobler and
more highly endowed natures, those men who really think and observe things round them, and
are the exceptions in the human race, that the following lines are applicable:

  "Os homini sublime dedit coelumque tueri
  Jussitt et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus."

       *       *       *       *       *

Why is "common" an expression of contempt? And why are "uncommon," "extraordinary," "distinguished,"
expressions of approbation? Why is everything that is common contemptible?

Common, in its original sense, means that which is peculiar and common to the whole species,
that is to say that which is innate in the species. Accordingly, a man who has no more qualities
than those of the human species in general is a "common man" "Ordinary man" is a much milder
expression, and is used more in reference to what is intellectual, while common is used more
in a moral sense.

What value can a being have that is nothing more than like millions of its kind? Millions?
Nay, an infinitude, an endless number of beings, which Nature in secula seculorum unceasingly
sends bubbling forth from her inexhaustible source; as generous with them as the smith with
the dross that flies round his anvil.

So it is evidently only right that a being which has no other qualities than those of the species,
should make no claim to any other existence than that confined to and conditioned by the species.

I have already several times explained[14] that whilst animals have only the generic character,
it falls to man's share alone to have an individual character. Nevertheless, in most men there
is in reality very little individual character; and they may be almost all classified. Ce sont
des esp�ces. Their desires and thoughts, like their faces, are those of the whole species--at
any rate, those of the class of men to which they belong, and they are therefore of a trivial,
common nature, and exist in thousands. Moreover, as a rule one can tell pretty exactly beforehand
what they will say and do. They have no individual stamp: they are like manufactured goods.
If, then, their nature is absorbed in that of the species, must not their existence be too?
The curse of vulgarity reduces man to the level of animals, for his nature and existence are
merged in that of the species only. It is taken for granted that anything that is high, great,
or noble by its very nature stands isolated in a world where no better expression can be found
to signify what is base and paltry than the term which I have mentioned as being generally
used--namely, common.

According as our intellectual energy is strained or relaxed will life appear to us either so
short, petty, and fleeting, that nothing can happen of sufficient importance to affect our
feelings; nothing is of any importance to us--be it pleasure, riches, or even fame, and however
much we may have failed, we cannot have lost much; or vice vers�, life will appear so long,
so important, so all in all, so grave, and so difficult that we throw ourselves into it with
our whole soul, so that we may get a share of its possessions, make ourselves sure of its prizes,
and carry out our plans. The latter is the immanent view of life; it is what Gracian means
by his expression, tomar muy de veras el vivir (life is to be taken seriously); while for the
former, the transcendental view, Ovid's non est tanti is a good expression; Plato's a still
better, οὔτε τι των ἀνθρωπινων ἀξιον ἑστι, μεγαλης σπουδης (nihil, in rebus humanis, magno
studio dignum est).

The former state of mind is the result of the intellect having gained ascendency over consciousness,
where, freed from the mere service of the will, it grasps the phenomena of life objectively,
and so cannot fail to see clearly the emptiness and futility of it. On the other hand, it is
the will that rules in the other condition of mind, and it is only there to lighten the way
to the object of its desires. A man is great or small according to the predominance of one
or the other of these views of life.

It is quite certain that many a man owes his life's happiness solely to the circumstance that
he possesses a pleasant smile, and so wins the hearts of others. However, these hearts would
do better to take care to remember what Hamlet put down in his tablets--that one may smile,
and smile, and be a villain.

People of great and brilliant capacities think little of admitting or exposing their faults
and weaknesses. They regard them as something for which they have paid, and even are of the
opinion that these weaknesses, instead of being a disgrace to them, do them honour. This is
especially the case when they are errors that are inseparable from their brilliant capacities--conditiones
sine quibus non, or, as George Sand expressed it, chacun a les d�fauts de ses vertus.

On the contrary, there are people of good character and irreproachable minds, who, rather than
admit their few little weaknesses, carefully conceal them, and are very sensitive if any reference
is made to them; and this just because their whole merit consists in the absence of errors
and defects; and hence when these errors come to light they are immediately held in less esteem.

Modesty, in people of moderate ability, is merely honesty, but in people of great talent it
is hypocrisy. Hence it is just as becoming in the latter to openly admit the regard they have
for themselves, and not to conceal the fact that they are conscious of possessing exceptional
capabilities, as it is in the former to be modest. Valerius Maximus gives some very good examples
of this in his chapter de fiducia sui.

Man even surpasses all the lower order of animals in his capacity for being trained. Mohammedans
are trained to pray five times a day with their faces turned towards Mecca; and they do it
regularly. Christians are trained to make the sign of the Cross on certain occasions, and to
bow, and so forth; so that religion on the whole is a real masterpiece of training--that is
to say, it trains people what they are to think; and the training, as is well known, cannot
begin too early. There is no absurdity, however palpable it may be, which may not be fixed
in the minds of all men, if it is inculcated before they are six years old by continual and
earnest repetition. For it is the same with men as with animals, to train them with perfect
success one must begin when they are very young.

Noblemen are trained to regard nothing more sacred than their word of honour, to believe earnestly,
rigidly, and firmly in the inane code of knight-errantry, and if necessary to seal their belief
by death, and to look upon a king as a being of a higher order. Politeness and compliments,
and particularly our courteous attitude towards ladies, are the result of training; and so
is our esteem for birth, position, and title. And so is our displeasure at certain expressions
directed against us, our displeasure being proportionate to the expression used. The Englishman
has been trained to consider his being called no gentleman a crime worthy of death--a liar,
a still greater crime; and so, the Frenchman, if he is called a coward; a German, if he is
called a stupid. Many people are trained to be honest in some particular direction, whilst
in everything else they exhibit very little honesty; so that many a man will not steal money,
but he will steal everything that will afford him enjoyment in an indirect way. Many a shopkeeper
will deceive without scruple, but he will on no condition whatever steal.
