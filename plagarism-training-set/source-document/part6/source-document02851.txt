On looking back over the pages of the "Diary" it appears to me that some sort of an amende
honorable is due to those citizens now living, and the relatives and friends of those now dead,
whose names have appeared in the "Diary" and who have, so to speak, been handled without gloves.
That I have been neither mobbed, nor horsewhipped, nor sued, nor prosecuted, but that I have
enjoyed many a good laugh with--and have received many pleasant words from--the victims, and
their friends, is good evidence that they, and their more fortunate brothers who have not been
therein mentioned, have taken the "Diary" in the very spirit in which it was published, that
of affectionate and amusing retrospect. And it is indeed with affection that I recall those
men, at that time in their prime. That I could not then understand the reason why they did
not fully enter into and appreciate the spirit that prompted me and my boon companions to transgress
so many rules, laws, and statutes is not surprising. Boys seldom can understand it. But, although
I now fully appreciate it, I often wonder at the spirit that prompted so many of those men
in after years to show me so many kindnesses, so much encouragement, and such great forbearance.

So many inquiries have been made of me about that cornet, the soul-filling ambition of my early
years, that I feel that the uncertainty in regard to that delightful instrument ought to be
cleared up. I never did save up enough money to buy a cornet. I haven't to this day. But many
years afterwards, when my ambition had been turned into other and equally profitless channels,
upon the death of a dear friend his beautiful cornet was sent me. I have it now, as the neighbors
and the members of my family can testify fully and with deep feeling, if called upon.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE

A good many years ago, during my college days, it was my custom and that of my room-mate, Brown
of Exeter, to make our room the gathering-place for Exeter boys, both "stewdcats" and homesick
Exeter youths then filling positions in Boston. It happened that frequently undergraduates
from other towns and cities came in at these Saturday evening gatherings and it was a matter
of wonder to them that we had so much to talk about in relation to our native town; and it
was their frequent remark that "either Exeter is a remarkable place, or you are a remarkably
loyal set of fellows."

That Exeter is a remarkable place is an axiom, and no better evidence of the fact can be found
(were evidence necessary to sustain an axiom) than in the loyalty that every citizen displays,
and the sincere love that prompts every one who has ever come under the spell of our dear old
town to revisit her at every opportunity.

Where else could a diary of this nature, dealing with actual persons and actual events, be
published and be received with such absolute goodnature and even enthusiasm by the persons
now living who are mentioned therein?

It is therefore with affection as well as amusement that I append the following brief biographical
sketches of persons mentioned in the "Diary," preserving as nearly as possible the order of
their appearance in the book. As many readers of the "Diary" have expressed a desire to know
more of the subsequent histories and achievements of those therein mentioned, it is hoped this
information will satisfy a curiosity and interest which, to a loyal son of Exeter, appear quite
natural:--

1. Father. GEORGE S. SHUTE.

A native of Exeter. For twenty-six years a clerk in the Boston Naval Office. Still living in
Exeter, an old man with a young tongue; in fact, the quickest man at repartee in Exeter.

2. Mother.

N. H. HIRAM BARRUS, of Reading, Mass. deceased; C. C. WHITTEMORE, of Portsmouth, N. H.; CHARLES
MUDGE, of Maiden; MATTHEW F. WHITTIER, of Medford, a brother of the poet Whittier, and a newspaper-writer
of considerable prominence, writing under the pen-name of "Ethan Spike"; and TRISTRAM TALBOT,
of Newburyport, with others whom the writer does not now recall. A few years later the writer
spent several of his college vacations as deputy clerk in the same Naval Office, and made pleasant
acquaintances with all of the above-named men. He found them very competent clerks, courteous
gentlemen, and the best story-tellers that he ever knew, and recollects those vacations as
very pleasant periods in his school life. Some of them still hold positions in the Custom House.
