NOTES

THE AUTHOR OF THE "CHARACTERISTICS."

Lord Shaftesbury's Letters to a young Man at the University, on which Mr. SINGER has addressed
to you an interesting communication (Vol. ii., p. 33.), were reprinted in 1746 in a collection
of his letters, "Letters of the Earl of Shaftesbury, author of the Characteristicks, collected
into one volume: printed MDCCXLVI." 18mo. This volume contains also Lord Shaftesbury's letters
to Lord Molesworth, originally published by Toland, with an introduction which is not reprinted;
a "Letter sent from Italy, with the notion of the Judgment of Hercules, &c., to my Lord ----";
and three letters reprinted from Lord Shaftesbury's life in the General Dicionary, which was
prepared by Dr. Kippis, under the superintendence of Lord Shaftesbury's son, the fourth earl.

In my copy of the original edition of the Letters to a young Man at the University, two letters
have been transcribed by an unknown previous possessor. One is to Bishop Burnet, recommending
young Ainsworth when about to be ordained deacon:--

    "To the Bishop of Sarum.

    "Reigate, May 23. 1710.
