As regards the advantages of the Montaud accumulator we notice, first, its longevity. Dr. D'Arsonval
points out that the accumulators of the Plante class have a great advantage over the Faure
type as regards duration, and that the most striking quality of the Montaud accumulator is
its longevity. The inventor has in his possession positive plates, five to six years old, completely
peroxidized, though there remains in the interior a thin core of metallic lead sufficient to
give passage to the current. The adhesion of the peroxide is such that to detach it, it must
be beaten with a hammer upon an anvil. The next four points--i.e., the rapidity of charge;
the yield, much greater than that of any other system in proportion to its surface; its small
weight in comparison with its yield; and its capacity, which for an equal weight is greater
than that of any other accumulator. In his experiments in September, 1885, Dr. D'Arsonval obtained
with an accumulator of 2 square meters of surface:

    Useful capacity        40 ampere hours.
    Total                  62   "      "
    Surface                 2 square meters
    Charge                 10 amp. per sq. meter.
    Discharge              20  "    "        "
    Useful weight of lead  10 kilos.

Representing a total capacity of six ampere hours per kilo., and of a discharge of 5 amperes
per kilo., or a total capacity of 81 ampere hours per square meter, and a useful capacity of
20 ampere hours per square meter. Subsequently the modification of the negative plate has greatly
improved these figures, which will certainly become much more advantageous in future. The total
capacity of an accumulator having exactly 1¾ meters of surface has become 87 ampere hours,
which if referred to an accumulator of 2 square meters of surface, would give the following
results:

    Useful weight of lead per sq. meter           5½   kilos.
    Total capacity of useful lead per kilo        9.1  amp. hr.
    Total capacity per sq. meter                 50      "
    Useful capacity of per kilo of useful lead    6.23   "
    Useful capacity per square meter             34.30   "
    Current of charge per square meter           10    amp.
    Current of charge per kilo, of useful lead    2     "
    Current of discharge per sq. meter           20     "
    Current of discharge per kilo, of useful lead 4.56  "

The next advantage of the Montaud accumulator is the ease with which it can be taken out of
its box and repaired without special tools and experience. A capital defect in this respect
has hitherto much interfered with the use of accumulators. In case of accidents, several kinds
of which are possible, it is found very difficult to rectify the apparatus. The Montaud accumulator
is much less liable to accidents, on account of the firmness and compactness of its construction,
and if any accident happens, the repairs are simple and easy. Lastly, the stout framework secures
the apparatus from any accident due to a disproportionate charge or discharge. The peculiarities
of the combs and rods already described solve this problem. On September 8, 1885, Dr. D'Arsonval,
professor at the College of France, wrote as follows: "The Montaud accumulator is of the Plante
type, and is extremely well conceived from a mechanical point of view. The wooden combs prevent
the plates from coming in mutual contact, and give the apparatus great solidity. The process
of formation is ingenious and rapid. To give 1 square meter a capacity of 20 ampere hours,
there is required only a quarter of an hour's treatment.
