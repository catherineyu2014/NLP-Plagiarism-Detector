The productions are breadfruit in its proper season, and cocoanuts, which they have throughout
the year; and a kind of fruit different from any that grows in America, which the natives call
Bup--all growing spontaneously. Of the leaves of the trees the women manufacture very elegant
mats, which they wear as blankets and clothing; of the bark of a vine they make men's clothing;
and of the husks of the cocoa they make ropes and rigging for their canoes, and for almost
every other purpose. The waters round the Islands abound with fish, and the natives are very
expert in catching them.

There are no animals on the Islands, excepting rats; and by these little quadrupeds they are
literally overrun.

The number of all the inhabitants, men, women, and children, is probably between five and six
hundred.

The following may be given as prominent characteristics of the natives.--They are in general,
well made and handsome--very indolent and superstitious. They are morose, treacherous, ferociously
passionate, and unfriendly to all other natives. When they are not fishing, or otherwise employed,
they are generally travelling about, and visiting each other. They have no salutations when
they meet, but sit down without exchanging a word of civility for some minutes; but after a
silent pause, the head of the family, if there is any thing in the house to eat, presents it
to his guests, who, when they have eaten sufficiently, if there are any fragments left, are
very careful to secure them and carry them off when they return home; and the host would regard
it as an imposition, if his visitors were to neglect this important trait of politeness, and
fashionable item in etiquette. They accustom themselves to frequent bathing; and commence with
their children on the day of their birth, and continue the practice twice a day, regularly,
till they are two years old. They do this to invigorate the system, and render the skin of
their children thick and tough by exposure. Their living consists simply of breadfruit, cocoanuts,
and bup; but cocoanuts are all they can depend on the year round--the two other articles being
common only a part of the year.

Their diversions consist in singing, dancing, and beating time with their arms, in a manner
similar to the amusements of the natives at the Sandwich Islands; in which they appear to take
great delight.

They wear their hair long, and tie it up in a kind of bow on the top of the head, and this
is all the covering they have for their heads. The men have long beards. One part of their
dress makes a singular and ludicrous appearance, which resembles two horse tails suspended
from the waist, one before and the other behind. The women's dress consists of two mats, about
the size of a small pocket-handkerchief, which they tie round them like an apron.

I never saw any form of marriage among them, but when a couple are desirous of being united,
their parents have a talk together on the subject, and if the parties all agree to the union,
the couple commence living together as man and wife; and I never knew of an instance of separation
between them after they had any family. In a few instances polygamy prevailed.

The following will give a pretty correct idea of their funeral rites and solemnities:

When a person dies, the inhabitants of the village assemble together, and commence drumming
and singing, halloing and yelling; and continue their boisterous lamentations for about 48
hours, day and night, relieving each other as they require. This they do, because they imagine
it is diverting to the person deceased. They bury the body at a particular place back of their
houses, and use mats for a coffin. After the ceremony of interment is performed, they plant
two cocoanut trees, one at the head and the other at the feet of the buried person. But if
the trees ever bear fruit, the women are prohibited from eating thereof, for fear of displeasing
the bad spirit, Anit. And here it may not be inappropriate to remind the reader that Eve ate
of the forbidden fruit, notwithstanding she knew it would displease the GOOD SPIRIT.

In their personal appearance, the natives are about the middle size, with broad faces, flat
noses, black hair and eyes, and large mouths.

In relation to literature, they are as ignorant as it is possible for people to be, having
not the most distant idea of letters.

Concerning the religion of the untaught natives of the Mulgraves, the following remarks will
give all the knowledge I am in possession of:

They believe there is an invisible spirit that rules and governs all events, and that he is
the cause of all their sickness and distress;--consequently they consider him to be a very
bad being.--But they have no belief in a good spirit, nor have they any modes of worship.--It
is a prevalent opinion among them, when any are sick, that the bad spirit rests upon them;
and they believe that particular manoeuvres and a form of words, performed round and said over
the sick, will induce Anit, the bad spirit, to cease from afflicting, and leave the unfortunate
sufferers. With regard to a future state of existence, they believe that the shadow, or what
survives the body, is, after death, entirely happy; that it roves about at pleasure, and takes
much delight in beholding everything that is transacted in this world;--and as they consider
the world as an extensive plain, they suppose the disembodied spirits travel quite to the edge
of the skies, where they think white people live, and then back again to their native Isles;
and at times they fancy they can hear the spirits of departed friends whistling round their
houses, and noticing all the transactions of the living. Singular as some of these notions
and opinions may appear, there is much to be met with in Christendom equally at variance with
reason; and I have heard from the pulpit, in New-England, the following language: "I have no
doubt in my own mind that the blessed in Heaven look down on all the friends and scenes they
left behind, and are fully sensible of all things that take place on earth!"

CHAPTER VIII.

This chapter, and the concluding remarks of the narrative, will be collated from a Journal
kept by Cyrus M. Hussey; and if there appear occasionally some incidents similar to those recorded
in the preceding account, it is believed the value and interest of this history will not be
diminished by them.--Hussey commences thus:

About the last of April, myself and Lay were separated, destined to different Islands, not
knowing whether we should ever see each other again. At night we arrived at an Island, and
hauled up our canoe. We found but few natives, but among the number was the mother of the chief
with whom I lived. She was very inquisitive respecting me, and talked so incessantly through
the night that I could not sleep. The next morning we were employed in gathering breadfruit,
for the purpose of curing it for the winter. This employment continued about three months,
during which time I was very uneasy about my situation. At intervals of leisure, when the old
chief had no particular engagements to engross his attention, he would launch his canoe and
go and search for fish; but my shoes having been taken from me, whenever I was employed round
the rough shores of the Island, my feet were so wounded that I could hardly walk. The natives
now commenced the destruction of my clothing, and not being able to converse with them, I found
it very difficult to preserve my apparel. They often requested me to divest myself of my clothing,
and dress as they did, or rather not dress at all. I made signs that the sun would burn me,
if I should expose myself to its scorching rays. When they found that persuasion would not
induce me to divest myself of clothing, they began to destroy my clothes, by tearing them in
pieces. It was some time before I could understand their language, so as to inform them that
the sun would burn my back; and being robbed of my clothes, the powerful influence of the sun
soon scorched me to such a degree that I could scarcely lie down or take any rest.

About the latter part of July, William Lay and others came to the Island in a canoe, to see
me, being the first interview we had enjoyed since our separation, which was about three months
previous. Lay informed me that the natives had taken his bible from him and torn it up, and
threatened his life. He informed me that it seemed to him as though he was robbed of that comfort
which none in a christian land are deprived of. We were soon parted; he in a canoe was taken
to an Island by the natives called Dilabu, and I went to my employment, repairing a canoe which
was on the stocks. After I had finished the canoe, the natives prepared a quantity of bread
fruit and fish for the chiefs, and on the following morning we set sail for an Island called
Milly, one of the largest in the group, at which resides the principal chief. We arrived just
at night and were cordially received by the natives, who had assembled on the beach in great
numbers, for the purpose of getting some fish which the old chief had brought with him. He
then hauled his canoe on shore; and I had again the pleasure of seeing my fellow sufferer,
William Lay, after a month's separation. Since our first meeting we were not allowed to converse
much together.

The old chief tarried at this Island but a short time, and Lay and myself were once more separated.
The old chief, his family, and myself, returned to the Island which we had left two or three
days before, called, in the language of the natives, Tabarawort; and he and his family commenced
gathering bread fruit. As the old man with whom I lived had charge of several small Islands,
we found it difficult to gather the fruit as fast as it ripened, so that a considerable part
fell to the ground and perished. In the mean time, while we were employed in gathering in the
fruits of the earth, news came to the Island, to inform the chief with whom I lived, that it
was the intention of the highest chiefs to destroy us both, (that is myself and Lay,) because
a severe sickness prevailed among them, and they being superstitious, supposed we were the
occasion of it. I informed them that we could not have been the cause of the sickness, as no
such sickness prevailed in our country, and that I never before had seen a similar disease.
But still they talked very hard about us; and the highest chief sent to the chief I lived with,
to have me brought to the Island of Milly, where Lay lived, in order that we might be killed
together. Preparations having been made, the old chief, whom I called father, with his family
and myself, set sail the next morning for Milly, where we arrived about sun set. He immediately
went to see the chief of Milly, to inquire the circumstances relating to the necessity of taking
our lives, leaving me and the rest of the family in the canoe. I shortly perceived William
Lay and his master coming towards the canoe, which produced sensations hard to be described.
Affectionate and sympathizing reader, what must have been our feelings and conversation at
that moment, when nothing seemingly was presented to our view but death? We were allowed an
interview of only a few minutes, when we were again separated.

My master soon returned to the canoe, and entered into very earnest conversation with his family,
which, at the time, I did not fully understand; but found afterwards it was a relation to his
family of his interview with the natives on the subject of taking our lives; and that if they
killed me, they would first have to kill him, (my master,) which they were unwilling to do.
My kind old master told them he had preserved me, and always should. Night now coming on, I
lay down to sleep, but fear had taken such possession of my mind, that the night was spent
in wakeful anxiety.

The next morning I asked leave of my master to visit Lay, which he readily gave. I set out
for the hut in company with my master's son; but on approaching it, Lay called out to me, to
inform me that I must not come--that the natives did not like to have us together. On my turning
to go back, Lay's master called to me to come. I went and sat down, and entered into conversation
with Lay, to ascertain what the intention of the natives towards us were. He told me it was
the design of the high chief to kill us. I observed to him, that we were in the hands of the
natives; still there was a higher and more powerful Hand that could protect us, if it were
the Divine pleasure so to do. I then bade him farewell, and returned to the canoe, never expecting
to see each other again till we should meet on the tranquil ocean of eternity.

My master being now ready to return to his Island, the canoe was launched, and we set sail,
and arrived the same night, having been absent two days.--The natives expressed much joy on
seeing me return, and asked many questions respecting the chief of Milly; but as I was unable
to speak their language intelligibly, I could give them but little information. We then went
on with our work as usual, which was fishing, &c. &c.

After having been at this Island some time, my master's wife manifested an inclination to go
and visit her friends, who lived at an Island called in their language Luguonewort. After a
successful excursion in fishing, we cooked a part, and took some breadfruit, and embarked,
agreeably to the wishes of my master's wife, and arrived at Luguonewort in two days. The natives
of that Island gave us a cordial reception. We hauled up our canoe and remained some time among
them. After our agreeable visit was ended, we returned to the other Island, found the natives
well, and that good care had been taken by the chief's mother, an old woman to whom the superintendence
of things had been left.

About six months after the massacre of my shipmates, the brother of the native in whose possession
I was, came to the Island, and informed us that a ship had been seen to pass a day or two before,
and that it caused great disturbance among the chiefs--that they thought it was the ship that
left the Islands, (the Globe,) and that she was in search of us. My old master immediately
prepared his canoe to visit the chiefs, and he wanted also to inquire of me what I thought
respecting the ship. We loaded our canoe and made sail for Milly, where the chiefs were. We
arrived at night, and found a great number of natives collected on the beach, to see if we
had any fish. We hauled up our canoe for the night, and the natives began to question me about
the ship.--I told them I did not know, concluding it would be good policy to say but little
on the subject. The natives crowded round me in great numbers; and I did not see Lay till he
came to me. I inquired of him what he had seen, and he informed me that there had been a ship
in sight about half an hour before sun set, and that she was near enough for him to see them
take in their fore and mizen top gallant sails, but could give no definite account of her,
as she was soon out of sight. We were not allowed to be together long; and I went to rest as
usual, but could not sleep.--"Hope springs eternal in the human breast"--and hope that the
ship which had been seen had come to deliver us from savages and transport us to our native
country and dear friends, had an influence on my feelings more powerful than sleep, and imagination
was busy through the night in picturing scenes of future happiness.

But the prospect of our being released from our unpleasant situation was not very flattering.
Early next morning I asked and obtained permission from my master, to pay a visit to Lay, before
passing round to the opposite side of the Island. Accompanied by my master's son and several
others, I went to the hut where Lay lived, and we had the pleasure of another interview; but
it was of short duration, for we were not allowed to be together more than a quarter of an
hour. I returned to my master's canoe, and there continued till the middle of the day; we then
launched and set sail for Tabanawort, where we arrived the fore part of the night.--Early next
morning we prepared for a fishing cruise, had pretty good success, and returned just before
night, made a fire, cooked some fish, and ate a delicious supper.

Our canoe being leaky and very much out of repair, my master and I commenced taking her to
pieces, for the purpose of re-building her; and we were occasionally employed upon her nearly
two months, when we launched her, and commencing fishing business, had alternately good and
bad success. One day we had the good fortune to enclose, in a kind of wear made for the purpose,
a large quantity of fishes, and with a scoopnet we caught a plentiful supply. After cooking
them, we set out with a quantity to dispose of to the chiefs of Milly, where we arrived before
night, on the same day of sailing. Very soon after our arrival I saw Lay and his master approaching
the canoe, and we once more had a short but pleasant interview. I inquired of Lay how he fared,
as to food, &c. His reply was, better than he expected, and that the natives were kind to him,
always giving him his part. I informed him I had a basket of fish reserved for him as a present,
which he requested me to keep till dark, that he might be enabled to carry them home without
having them all begged by the natives. He came at night for the fish, and I retired, agreeably
to my master's wishes to sleep in the canoe, to prevent the natives from stealing the remainder
of the fish that were on board. The next morning my master was highly pleased to find that
nothing was missing; and gave me liberty to go and see Lay. I went to the hut and found him
with his master. They gave me a cordial welcome, and presented me with some cocoanuts in return
for the fish. Lay's master inquired of me very particularly respecting my master, and the quantity
of fish we caught. I then returned to the canoe, carrying the cocoanuts, to deposite in the
hold. My master asked me where I got them; I told him Lay's master gave them to me. If this
minute detail should appear unimportant to the reader, he may draw a moral from it; for it
evinces that my master was like other masters, desirous to know if his servant came honestly
in possession of the cocoanuts. He then ordered me and his son to launch the canoe, which we
did, got under sail for the Island we left the day before, and arrived back at night. We learned
that during our absence the natives had caught a considerable quantity of fish; and in a few
days we caught a large quantity more; loaded our canoe, and embarked for one of the head Islands
to pay a visit, where we stopped some time. On our return, we commenced catching a kind of
fish called by the natives kierick. They are about the size of a small codfish; and the manner
of taking them is very curious--they make a line of the husk of cocoanuts, about the size of
a cod line; they then in the canoe pass round the fish to the windward of the flat, then lie
to till a considerable quantity of them get on the flat, then square away by the wind and run
down and go round the flat with this line, and thus catch them, men, women, and children being
employed. I have known them catch one hundred at a draught. The fish are afraid of the line,
and when enclosed, taken by a scoopnet. After taking a sufficient quantity, they go on shore
to prepare for cooking them, which is done by digging a large hole in the earth, filling it
with wood, covered with stones. The wood is then consumed, which heats the stones--the fish
are wrapped in leaves to prevent them from falling to pieces, then covered with green leaves,
and cooked by the heat of the stones. About an hour is required to cook them sufficient for
eating. Their manner of curing fish, is, to split them and dry them in the sun, without using
salt. Thus cured, they will keep some time. While we were employed in fishing, Lay came to
the Island, in company with a native, to visit me; but did not stay long, for the chief sent
for him, fearing, as I afterwards found out, that they should lose us. From some hints that
had been dropped, a report had got in circulation that my master and Lamawoot, (Lay's master,)
intended to leave their Islands, and embark for an Island to the north west, where the king
lived, and carry us with them as a great curiosity. Lay was carried back to the chiefs--the
head one sent an express to my master and Lay's to come and see him--they made preparations
and set sail for Milly; where they were closely questioned respecting their going to the other
Island, &c. &c. They denied that they had even intimated any such design; which was false,
for I had frequently heard them talking on the subject myself, but kept silent, as it appeared
to be a great crime for any to desert their Islands; and I feared the consequences of making
it known.--They then parted in peace and friendship, and I and my master returned to our habitation.

We then went to an Island to catch fish, and a disagreement taking place between two of the
natives, about some trifling affair, the particulars of which I did not learn, one of them
took a spear belonging to the other, and after breaking it across his knee, with one half of
it killed his antagonist, and left him. The parents of the man killed, being present, laid
him out on some mats, and appeared to regret their loss very much. They kept a continual drumming
over the body of the deceased for two or three days; after which he received a decent burial
on another Island at some distance from the Island where he was killed.

CHAPTER IX.

Having a successful fishing voyage, we loaded our canoe, and carried our cargo to the chiefs
of Luguonewort. I had the satisfaction of an interview with Lay; but our provisions being soon
exhausted, we were obliged to go again in search of fish. At this time there was a severe drought,
and breadfruit trees suffered extremely, many of them entirely died. The superstitious natives
supposed the drought was sent upon them as a judgment, because myself and Lay were allowed
to live. I informed them that we could neither make it rain nor prevent it; but some of them
were so ignorant that they believed we could control the weather. But some of the chiefs thought
the drought was visited upon them because they had killed our shipmates, and I was always ready
to join with them in that opinion. The drought continued about four months with such severity
that most of the breadfruit trees on the small Islands were so completely dried up that they
never sprouted again. Many of the ignorant natives still insisted that their sickness and drought
were occasioned by suffering us to live upon their Islands; but this gross ignorance was counterbalanced
by most of the chiefs, who believed differently, and to their more liberal opinion we are indebted
for our lives.

About this time the Islands were refreshed by plentiful showers of rain, and the natives assembled
at Milly to sing for the breadfruit to come in abundance. They said their singing would please
Anit, and that he would reward them with a very great crop.

A disturbance existed between the high chief and his brother Longerene. The disagreement lasted
about nine months, during which time the two brothers did not see or speak to each other. Luttuon,
the high chief, then sent a canoe to inform his brother Longerene that he wished to see him.
An interview took place, and a treaty of peace was ratified.

During our stay at Milly, I had frequent opportunities of seeing Lay, my fellow sufferer; but
the only relief we could afford each other was derived from a sympathy of feelings, and in
conversations relating to our homes and native country, by blending our mutual wishes for a
safe return, &c. &c. The reader can hardly conceive the unpleasantness of our situation at
this time--the famine was so great that the tender branches of trees were cooked, and the nutricious
juice drank as food. My strength was so reduced in consequence of being deprived of my usual
quantity of provisions, that I was unable to accompany my master on a fishing voyage. When
my master returned, he found me lying in the hut, and asked me what was the matter. I informed
him my indisposition proceeded from hunger; he cooked a fish and gave me, which, though it
afforded me some relief, was not half enough to satisfy the cravings of appetite.

After I had recruited my strength, one day while engaged in fishing, a canoe came to the Island;
and as soon as the canoe was near enough for the natives in her to be heard, they commenced
hallooing and making dreadful noises, which is their practice when war is declared. They informed
us that the high chief had killed several of the lower chiefs who belonged to the Island called
Alloo; that Longerene had fled to Alloo, his own Island; and that the high chief was determined
to pursue and kill him. We were ordered to go immediately to his assistance; accordingly we
set sail for the Island Milly, where we found a great number of natives collected for war.
Again I had the satisfaction of being with Lay; who informed me that they were going to fight
the other party at Alloo; and that the high chief had told him that he and I must prepare two
muskets, and go and fight with them. Luttuon sent for me and Lay, and informed us he was about
to have a battle, and that we must prepare to take a part in it. We asked him if he had any
powder--he said he had a plenty, and showed us a small box, which contained a little powder
and mustard seed mixed together, which, if it had been good powder, would not have made more
than five or six charges. We told him it was good for nothing; but he said we must do the best
we could with it. As we were afraid to offend him, we went to work with the powder, and dried
it in the sun, and prepared our muskets for battle.--The next morning we launched 15 or 16
canoes, containing in all about 200 natives, and set sail for Alloo; where we arrived and landed,
and proceeded to a village in order to give battle to the enemy. On learning that the chief
of Alloo and his family had fled in a canoe, we returned to our canoes, made sail in pursuit
of the chief, but did not overtake him. After returning and spending a day or two at the Island
of Alloo, we launched our canoes and went to our respective homes, and heard no more of the war.

Some time after my master returned to the Island where we usually resided, a canoe came and
brought the information that a vessel was anchored near one of the head Islands--that she carried
guns on each side, and had a hundred men--that they (the natives that brought the news) had
been on board of the vessel, and received presents of beads, which they had on their necks.
The natives said the vessel was not like our ship which we came in, but had only two masts.
I told them we had vessels of all descriptions, some with one mast only. They said the men
on board did not look like us, and that they were very saucy. I informed the natives the vessel
was a war vessel, and that if molested by the natives, they would shoot them. The natives said
they would take the vessel and kill all the men on board. I told them their safety consisted
in friendship, and that any hostile attack on the crew of the schooner would lead to their
own destruction.--They then set sail for Milly, to inform the chiefs of the arrival of the
vessel at the head Island. The chiefs of Milly gave orders to launch the canoes, 15 in number,
to go and take the schooner. These canoes were manned by 200 natives. My master's canoe not
being in perfect repair, we could not join the party. On the night of the 25th, (Nov.) we saw
several of the canoes returning towards the Island where I was. From one of the canoes landed
the high chief, who began to question me respecting the vessel. I told him I had not seen the
vessel, and of course could not tell much about her; but that I expected she had come after
me and Lay, and that she would have us. He then said he had better kill us both, and then there
would be no one to tell that the natives had killed the rest of our crew. I told him that the
people on board the schooner knew there were two alive, and if they killed us, the crew of
the vessel would kill all the natives. This appeared to perplex his mind, and he shortly left
me, and retired to rest.

On the next morning, 26th, the chief again questioned me respecting the vessel, but I could
give him no particular information, as I had not seen her.--The natives then commenced knotting
up leaves to inquire of their god, who, they said, would inform them what was best to be done.
Towards night they departed, leaving me with my master, giving him strict orders not to let
me go to the vessel, fearing that I should not only remain on board, but give information that
my shipmates had been murdered. I was glad to see them depart, for I feared they would kill
me.--The reader can have but a faint idea of my feelings at that time; nor will I attempt to
describe them.

Towards the close of the next day, (27th,) a canoe came to the Island which had been boarded
by a boat from the schooner. The natives offered the men in the boat some cocoanuts, which
they would not accept. The boat then proceeded towards the Island of Milly.--The natives informed
me that the men in the boat inquired after the men who were left there by the ship Globe; but
they would not give any information where they were. The canoe left the Island, and we went
to rest. The next day passed without hearing any thing of the schooner; but the day following,
(29th of Nov.) as I was walking in the woods in the afternoon, I heard a dreadful outcry for
Hussey. I ran to the hut to learn the cause, and to my unspeakable joy, I discovered that one
of the schooner's boats was on the beach, waiting for me, the men all armed and equipped for
battle. As I approached, the Lieutenant spoke to me and told me to come to him. I went and
sat down by him. He asked me several questions, but my feelings were so overcome and agitated,
that I know not whether I replied in English, or the language of the natives. While we were
sitting together, the old man whom I had always called master, but who was now willing to be
considered my servant, asked me if the white people were going to kill him. The Lieutenant
inquired of me to know the purport of the old man's question; I told him he was afraid of being
killed. The Lieutenant replied that he should not be hurt, if he behaved himself properly.

We then walked round the Island, and I collected what few things I had, a musket, &c. and made
preparations for our departure. My old master being unwilling to part with me, asked permission
to go with me. I spoke to the Lieutenant on the subject, and he readily consented. We then
set sail, accompanied by my master and his son. We soon fell in with the 2d Lieutenant, in
another boat, who informed that all the survivors of the Globe's crew were now rescued. The
boats soon lost sight of each other, as night came on, and that in which I was arrived at the
Island about 9 o'clock in the evening. We landed, cooked supper, and anchored our boat at a
little distance from the shore for the night.

The next morning, (30th,) we got under weigh, accompanied by the other boat, beat to the windward,
for the outside passage, and then ran down to the schooner, and got along side at 9 o'clock.
I will leave it for the reader, to picture my feelings on entering once more on board of an
American vessel, after having been among unmerciful savages 22 months. We soon had some breakfast,
after which my hair was cut, which was of two year's growth, and I was furnished with clothing,
and remained on board till the next day.

From this date to the time of our arrival in the United States, all the important incidents
and facts which transpired, will be found in the preceding pages, arranged from the journal
kept by Lay.

After expressing my thanks to all who assisted to rescue us from savage bondage, and my gratitude
to Heaven for a safe return to my friends and native land, I bid the reader a respectful farewell.
