F. M. B. Hicks' Hall was so called from its builder, Sir Baptist Hicks, afterwards Viscount
Camden; and the name of the Old Bailey, says Stow, "is likely to have arisen of some Count
of old time there kept."--See Cunningham's Handbook of London.

GEORGE PETIT. The book called Elegantiæ Latinæ, published under the name of the learned Joh.

H. A. R. Much information concerning the general and social condition of Lunatics before 1828
will be found in Reports of Committees of House of Commons of 1815, 1816, and 1827, and of
the House of Lords of 1828.

A. C. P. The explanation furnished is one about which there can be no doubt, but for obvious
reasons we do not insert it.

disposition to insert it.

Whereshall we go this morning? Such is usually the query over the breakfast table with visitors
to London. Let us answer the question. If you can admire the most beautiful specimens of PAPIER
MACHE MANUFACTURE which are produced in this country, displayed in the most attractive forms--if
you want a handsome or useful dressing-case, work-box, or writing-desk, if you need any requisite
for the work-table or toilet, or if you desire to see one of the most elegant emporiums in
London--then you will go to MECHI'S, 4. Leadenhall-street, near the India-house, in whose show-rooms
you may lounge away an hour very pleasantly.
