The alternative to overpopulation and its remedy emigration is found in preventive checks to
increase. These sometimes take the form of restricted or late marriages, as Malthus found to
be the case in Norway and Switzerland in 1799,[1342] before the introduction of steam or electric
motive power had stimulated the industries of these countries or facilitated emigration thence.
The same end is achieved by the widespread religious celibacy which sometimes characterizes
mountain communities. In the barren Auvergne Plateau of France, the number of younger sons
who become priests is extraordinary. Many daughters become nuns. Celibacy, seconded by extensive
emigration, clears the field for the eldest son and the system of primogeniture which the poverty
of this rugged highland has established as a fixed institution in the Auvergne.[1343] A careful
statistical investigation of the geographical origins of the Catholic priesthood in Europe
might throw interesting light on the influences of environment. The harsh conditions of mountain
life make the monastery a line of least resistance, while geographical isolation nourishes
the religions nature and benumbs the intellectual activities.

It is in the corrugated highland of Tibet, chilled to barrenness by an elevation of 12,000
feet or more (4000 meters), sterile and treeless from aridity, carved by cañon-cutting streams
into deep gorges offering a modicum of arable soil for irrigation, that monasticism has developed
into an effective system to keep down population. Buddhism, with its convents and lamaseries,
naturally recommended itself to a country where asceticism was obviously expedient. The world
shows nowhere else so large a celibate class. In Tibet, monks are estimated at 175,000 to 500,000
in a total population of three millions. Archibald Little estimates their number at one-third
of the total male population.[1344] Derge, which is the most productive district both agriculturally
and industrially of eastern Tibet and is also most densely inhabited, counts at least 10,000
lamas in a total population of about 42,000.[1345] Not less than one-sixth of the inhabitants
of Ladak are in religious houses as monks and nuns.[1346] Families in Tibet are small, yet
each devotes one or more children to convent or monastic life.[1347] In western Tibet, especially
about Taklakot in the Himalayan border, one boy in every family is invariably devoted to the
priesthood, and one or more daughters must become nuns. But the nun generally resides with
her family or lives in some monastery--with unspeakable results.[1348]

[Sidenote: Polyandry.]

The Tibetans seem to be enthusiastic Malthusians, with all the courage of their convictions.
Religious celibacy among them is only an adjunct to another equally effective social device
for restricting population. This is the institution of polyandry, which crops out in widely
distributed mountain regions of limited resources, just as it appears not infrequently in primitive
island societies. Its sporadic occurrence in extensive lowlands, as among the Warraus of Guiana
and certain tribes of the Orinoco, is extremely rare, as also its occasional appearance among
pastoral steppe-dwellers, like the Hottentots and Damaras.[1349] It is often associated with
polygamy where wealth exists, and is never the exclusive form of marriage, yet its frequency
among mountain peoples is striking. Strabo describes fraternal polyandry as it existed in mountainous
Yemen. There among a Semitic people, as to-day in Mongolian Tibet and among the aboriginal
Todas of the Nilgiri Hills in peninsular India, the staff of one husband left at the door of
the house excluded the others.[1350] In modern times the institution is found throughout Tibet,
and in the Himalayan and sub-Himalayan districts adjoining it, as in Ladak, Kunawar, Kumaon,
Garhwal, Spiti, Sirmur, among the Miris, Daphlas, Abors and Bhutias occupying the southern
slope of the Himalayans eastward from Sikkim, and the Murmese tribes of the Khasia Hills just
to the south. The same practice occurs among the Coorgs of the Western Ghats, among the Nairs
at the coastal piedmont of this range, among the Todas of the mountain stronghold known as
the Nilgiri Hills (peaks 8000 feet or 2630 meters), and it crops out sporadically among certain
mountain Bantu tribes of South Africa.[1351]

[Sidenote: Female infanticide.]

There seems little doubt that polyandry, as Herbert Spencer maintains, has been adopted as
an obvious and easy check upon increase of population in rugged countries.[1352] It is generally
coupled with other preventive checks. In the Nilgiri Hills, as we found also to be the case
on many Polynesian islands, it is closely associated with female infanticide.[1353] The Todas
in 1867 showed a proportion of two men to one woman, but later, with the decline of infanticide
under British rule, a proportion of 100 men to 75 women, and a resulting modification of the
institution of polyandry.[1354] It may well be that the paucity of women suggested this form
of marriage, whose expediency as an ally to infanticide in checking population later became
apparent. The Todas are a very primitive folk of herdsmen, living on the produce of their buffaloes,
averse to agriculture, though not inhibited from it by the nature of their country, therefore
prone to seek any escape from that uncongenial employment,[1355] and relying on the protected
isolation of their habitat to compensate for the weakness inherent in the small number of the
tribe.

Throughout Tibet and Ladak polyandry works hand in hand with the lamaseries in limiting population.
The conspicuous fact in Tibetan polyandry is its restriction to the agricultural portion of
the population. The pastoral nomads of the country, depending on their yaks, sheep and goats,
wandering at will over a very wide, if desolate territory, practice monogamy and polygamy.[1356]
The sedentary population, on the other hand, is restricted to tillable lands so small that
each farm produces only enough for one family. Subdivision under a divided inheritance would
be disastrous to these dwarf estates, especially owing to possible complications growing out
of irrigating rights.[1357] Polyandry leaves the estate and the family undivided, and by permitting
only one wife to several fraternal husbands restricts the number of children. It does this
also in another way by diminishing the fertility of the mothers; for all travelers comment
upon the paucity of children in polyandrous families.

Westermarck lays stress upon the fact that polyandry prevails chiefly in sterile countries.
He regards it less as a conscious device to check increase of population than a result of the
disproportion of males to females in polyandrous communities. The preponderance of male births
he attributes to the excessive endogamy bordering on inbreeding which tends to prevail in all
isolated mountain valleys; and also, as a possibility, to the undernourished condition of the
parents caused by scanty food supplies, which Düsing found to be productive of a high percentage
of male births in proportion to female.[1358] The motive of restricting population seems entitled
to more weight than Westermarck concedes to it; for he slurs over the fact that in Tibet polyandry
gives rise to a large number of superfluous women who fill the nunneries,[1359] while in the
Nilgiri Hills redundant females were eliminated by infanticide. The fact seems to be that in
the institution of polyandry we have a social and psychological effect of environment, reinforced
by a physiological effect.

[Sidenote: Effects of polyandry and polygamy.]

A comparison of social conditions in the adjoining provinces of Baltistan and Ladak, which
together comprise the Himalayan valley of the Indus, reveals the character of polyandry as
a response to geographic environment. Both provinces are inhabited by a Mongolian stock, but
the Ladaki living on the uppermost stretch of the basin near Tibet are Buddhists and polyandrists,
while the Baltis farther down the valley are Mussulmen and polygamists. The Baltis, with their
plurality of wives and numerous children, are wretchedly poor and live in squalor on the verge
of starvation; but as the elevation of their valley ranges only from 4000 to 8500 feet, they
are inured to heat, and therefore emigrate in large numbers to the neighboring Mohammedan province
of the Punjab, where they work as coolies and navvies. The Ladakis, on the other hand, living
9000 to 13,000 feet above the sea, die of bilious fever when they reach the lowlands. Cut off
from emigration, they curtail population by means of polyandry and lamaseries. Consequently
they show signs of prosperity, are well fed, well clothed and comfortably housed.[1360] Baltistan's
social condition illustrates in a striking way the power of an idea like an alien creed, assimilated
as the result of close vicinal location, to counteract for a time the influences of local geographic
conditions.

[Sidenote: Marauding tendencies in mountaineers]

The less civilized mountain peoples, whose tastes or low economic status unfit them for emigration,
solve the problem of a deficient food supply by raiding the fields and stores of their richer
neighbors. Predatory expeditions fill the history of primitive mountain peoples, and of the
ancient occupants of highland regions which are now devoted to honest industry. The ancient
Alpine tribes were one and all, from the Mediterranean to the Danube, "poor and addicted to
robbery," as Strabo says. He analyzes their condition with nice discrimination. "The greater
part [of the Alps], especially the summits of the mountains inhabited by robbers, are barren
and unfruitful, both on account of the frost and the ruggedness of the land. Because of the
want of food and other necessaries, the mountaineers have sometimes been obliged to spare the
inhabitants of the plains, that they might have some people to supply them."[1361] The freebooters
usually descended into the lowlands of Italy, Gaul and Helvetia, but the pass peoples lay in
wait for their prey on the mountain roads. Strabo described the same marauding habits arising
from the same cause among the mountaineers of northern Spain,[1362] the Balkan range,[1363]
and the highlands encircling the Mesopotamian plains.[1364]

Hunger is usually the spur. The tribesmen who inhabit the Hunza gorge were notorious robbers
till their recent conquest by the British. Despite the most careful terrace tillage, their
country was much overpopulated. The supply of grain was so inadequate, that during the summer
the people subsisted wholly on fruit, reserving the grain for winter use. Therefore, when early
summer opened the passes of the Karakorum and Himalayan ranges, and caravans began to move
over the trade route between Kashmir and Yarkand, when the Kirghis nomads from the plains sought
the pastures of the Pamir, the Hunza tribesmen found raiding caravans and herds, and pillaging
the Gilgit Valley of Baltistan the easiest means of supplementing their slender resources.
Hardy mountaineers as they were, and born fighters, they always conducted their forays successfully,
and returned to the shelter of their fastnesses, laden with plunder and driving their captive
flocks before them. The perpetual menace of these Hunza raids caused large districts in the
Gilgit Valley to be abandoned by their inhabitants, and cultivated land to lapse into wilderness,[1365]
while the Chilas to the south pillaged the Astor Valley of Baltistan, carrying away crops and
cattle, enslaving women and children.[1366]

[Sidenote: Cattle-lifting.]

Marauding propensities are marked among all retarded mountain peoples of modern times. The
cattle-lifting clans of the Scotch Highlands, who preyed upon the Lowlands, have their counterpart
in the Pathans of the Suleiman and Baluch mountain border who, till curbed by the British power
in India, systematically pillaged the plains of the Sind.[1367] The forest Bhils of the Vindhyan
and Satpura ranges are scarcely yet married to agriculture; so when in time of drought their
crops fail and the game abandons the hill forests to seek water in the lowland jungles, the
Bhils cheerfully revert to their ancestral habit of cattle-lifting.[1368]

The Caucasus was long a breeding place for robber tribes who made their forays into the pastures
and fields of southern Russia. Robbery was part of the education of every Circassian prince,
while one group of the Abassines conferred their chieftainship upon the most successful robber
or the man of largest family.[1369] The Kurdish hillmen of the Armenian ranges descend with
their herds of horses in winter to the warmer plains, where they exhaust the pastures and subject
the Armenian villages to a regular system of blackmail.[1370] The wide grassy plains about
Koukou Nor Lake, near the Chinese border of Tibet, attract numerous Mongol nomads with their
herds; but these rich pastures are exposed to the depredation of Si Fan brigand tribes, who
have their haunts in the deep, impenetrable gorges of the neighboring mountains, and carefully
guard all the approaches to the same. They are Buddhists, but worship a special Divinity of
Brigandage, to whom their lamas offer prayers for the success of every foray.[1371] Hence,
among mountain as among desert peoples, robbery tends to become a virtue; environment dictates
their ethical code.

[Sidenote: Historical results of mountain raiding.]

These depredations reflect to a great degree the complementary relation of highlands and lowlands.
The plains possess what the mountains lack. This is a fundamental fact of economic geography,
and inevitably leads to historical results. The marauding expeditions of mountain peoples first
acquire historical importance, either when the raids after long continuance end in the conquest
of the lowlands, and thus augment the resources and population of the highland state; or, as
is often the case, the raiders call down upon themselves the vengeance of the plainsmen, are
subdued, and embodied in the lowland state. The conquest of ancient Assyria and the destruction
of Nineveh by the mountain Medes seems to have been a process of this kind. Long before their
descent upon Mesopotamia, they were known as the "dangerous Medes," were constantly threatening
the Assyrian frontiers and occupying isolated tracts.[1372] The predatory incursions of the
Samnites of the Apennines into the fertile fields of Campania eventuated in the conquest of
ancient Capua and other cities, and greatly strengthened the Samnite Confederacy. But this
encroachment of the mountain tribes upon the plains aroused the cupidity and alarm of the Romans,
who in turn bent their energies toward the final subjugation of the Samnites.[1373] Himalayan
Nepal, after the unification of its petty Rajah states by the Gurkha conquest between 1768
and 1790, began encroachments and ravages upon the Indian Terai or fertile alluvial lowland
at the foot of the mountains; and finally by 1858 had acquired title to a considerable strip
of it, which by its rice fields and forests greatly strengthened the geographic and economic
base of the highland state.[1374] The Malay Hovas, inhabiting the central plateau of Madagascar,
braced to effort by its temperate climate and not over-generous soil, have almost everywhere
subdued the better fed but sluggish lowlanders of the coast.[1375] There can be little doubt
that the beneficent effects of an invigorating mountain climate, especially in tropical and
subtropical latitudes, have helped the hardy, active hill people to make easy conquest of the
enervated plainsmen.

[Sidenote: Conquest of mountain regions]

It is more often the case, however, that the scant resources, small number, and divided political
condition of the mountain tribes make such conquest impossible. Their depredations provoke
reprisals from the stronger states of the plain, who bring the mountain region under subjection,
merely to police their frontier. Strabo makes it clear that the Romans, having secured certain
passes over the Alps, neglected the conquest of the ranges, till the increase of Roman colonies
along the piedmont rim excited the cupidity of the mountaineers. Muscovite dominion was extended
over the Caucasus, both in order to check the persistent raids of its tribes into the Russian
plains, and to secure control of its passes. The state of Kashmir, guided by a purely local
policy, for years tried to conquer the robber tribes on its northwestern frontier, merely to
protect its own border provinces. Then the British authorities of the Indian Empire began the
same process, but from a radically different motive. They saw the Gilgit and Hunza valleys,
like the Chitral to the west, as highways through a mountain transit land, whose opposite approaches
were held by the Russians.[1376]

Such conquests, whatever be their motive, profit the vanquished in the end more than the victor.
They result in the systematic and intelligent development of the mountain resources, and the
maintenance of ampler social and economic relations between highland and lowland through the
construction of roads, which must always represent the reach of the governing authority. The
conquest of mountain peoples means always expensive and protracted campaigns. The invader has
always two enemies to fight, Nature and the armed foe. There is a saying in India that "In
Gilgit a small army is annihilated and a large army starves to death." Hunger is king in high
altitudes, and comes always to the defense of mountain independence. Moreover, the inaccessibility
of such districts, the difficulty of maintaining lines of communication, ignorance of by-paths
and trails which forever offer strategic opportunities to the natives or escape at a crisis,
all serve to protract the war. The independent spirit of the mountaineer, his endurance of
hardships, his mastery of mountain tactics, and his obstinate resistance after repeated defeat,
give always a touch of heroism to highland warfare. Consequently, history abounds in examples
of unconquered mountain peoples, or of long sustained resistance, like that which for sixty
years under the heroic leadership of Kadi Mulah and Shamyl used up the treasure and troops
of Russia in the impregnable defiles of the Caucasus. In the end, however, the highland tribes
succumb to numbers and the road-making engineer.

[Sidenote: Political dismemberment of mountain peoples.]

Political dismemberment, lack of cohesion due to the presence of physical barriers impeding
intercourse, is the inherent weakness of mountain peoples. Political consolidation is never
voluntary. It is always forced upon them from without, either by foreign conquest or by the
constant menace of such conquest, which compels the mountain clans to combine for common defense
of their freedom. The combination thus made is reluctant, loose, easily broken, generally short-lived.
It becomes close and permanent only under a constant pressure from without, and then assumes
a form allowing to the constituent parts the greatest possible measure of independence. The
Swiss canton and commune are the result of a segregating environment; the Swiss Republic is
the result of threatened encroachments by the surrounding states. It owed its first genuine
federal constitution to Napoleon.

A report on the situation in the Caucasus, addressed to Czar Nicholas in 1829, contains an
epitome of the history of mountain peoples. It runs as follows: "The Circassians bar out Russia
from the south, and may at their pleasure open or close the passage to the nations of Asia.
At present their intestine dissensions, fostered by Russia, hinder them from uniting under
one leader; but it must not be forgotten that, according to traditions religiously preserved
among them, the sway of their ancestors extended as far as to the Black Sea. * * * The imagination
is appalled at the consequence which their union under one leader might have for Russia, which
has no other bulwark against their ravages than a military line, too extensive to be very strong."[1377]
Here we have the whole story--a mountain people pillaging the lowlands, exercising a dangerous
and embarrassing control over the passes, and thereby calling down upon themselves conquest
from without; weakened by a contracting territory within the highlands and a shrinking area
of plunder without, doomed to eventual defeat by the yet more ominous weakness of political
dismemberment.

[Sidenote: Individualism and independence]

Mountain tribes are always like a pack of hounds on the leash, each straining in a different
direction. Wall-like barriers, holding them apart for centuries, make them almost incapable
of concerted action, and restive under any authority but their own. Clan and tribal societies,
feudal and republican rule, always on a small scale, characterize mountain sociology. All these
are attended by an exaggerated individualism and its inevitable concomitant, the blood feud.
Mountain policy tends to diminish the power of the central authority to the vanishing point,
giving individualism full scope. Social and economic retardation, caused by extreme isolation
and encouraged by protected location, tend to keep the social body small and loosely organized.
Every aspect of environment makes against social integration.

The broken relief of ancient Greece produced the small city state; but in the rugged mountains
of Arcadia the principle of physical and political subdivision went farther. Here, for four
centuries after the first Olympiad, the population, poorest and rudest of all Greece, was split
up into petty hill villages, each independent of the other.[1378] The need of resisting Spartan
aggression led for the first time, in 371 B.C., to the formation of a commune Arcadum, a coalescence
of all the fractional groups constituting the Arcadian folk;[1379] but even this union, effected
only by the masterly manipulation of the Theban Epaminondas, proved short-lived and incomplete.
What was true of the Arcadian villages was true of the city states of Greece. The geography
of the land instilled into them the principle of political aloofness, except when menaced by
foreign conquest. Cooperation is efficient only when it springs from a habit of mind. Greek
union against the Persians was very imperfect; and against the Roman, the feeble leagues were
wholly ineffective. The influence of this dismembering environment still persists. As ancient
Greece was a complex of city states, modern Greece is a complex of separate districts, each
of which holds chief place in the minds of its citizens, and unconsciously but steadily operates
against the growth of a national spirit in the modern sense.[1380]

[Sidenote: Types of mountain states.]

A mountain environment encourages political disunion in several forms. Sometimes it favors
the survival of a turbulent feudal nobility, based upon clan organization, as among the medieval
Scotch, who were not less rebellious toward their own kings than toward the English conquerors.[1381]
Feudal rule seems congenial to the mountaineer, whose conservative nature, born of isolation,
clings to hereditary chiefs and a long established order. Feudal communities and dwarf republics
exist side by side in the northern Caucasus,[1382] attended by that primitive assertion of
individual right, the blood feud.[1383] Often the two forms of government are combined, but
the feudal element is generally only a dwindling survival from a remote past. The little Republic
of Andorra, which for a thousand years has preserved its existence in the protection of a high
Pyrenean valley, is a self-governing community, organized strictly along the lines of a Tyrolese
or Swiss commune; but the two viguiers or agents, who in some matters outrank the president,
are official appointments tracing back to feudal days, when Andorra was a seigneurie of the
Comté of Urgel.[1384] Tyrol offers a striking parallel to this. In its local affairs it has
in effect a republican form of government, enjoying as high degree of autonomy as any Swiss
canton; but the great Brenner route, which could confer both power and wealth on its possessor,
made the Tyrol an object of conquest to the feudal nobles of the early Middle Ages. Their hereditary
dominion is now vested in the archdukes of Austria, to whom the Tyrolese have shown unfailing
fidelity, but from whom they have exacted complete recognition of their rights.[1385]

Tyrol's neighbor Switzerland illustrates the pure form of commune, canton and republic, which
is the logical result of a rugged mountain relief. Here commune and canton are the real units
of government. In the federal power at Bern the Swiss peasant takes little interest, often
not even knowing the name of the national president. In the highest ranges a canton coincides
with a mountain-rimmed valley--Valais with the basin of the upper Rhone, Glarus with the upper
Linth, Uri with the Reuss, Graubünden with the upper Rhine, to which is joined by many pass
routes the sparsely peopled Engadine, Ticino with the drainage basin of upper Lake Maggiore,
Unterwalden with the southern drainage valleys of Lake Lucerne. Where the mountains are lower,
or where passes connect valleys of high levels, cantonal boundaries may overstep geographical
barriers. A commune generally consists of the villages strung along a narrow lateral valley,
isolated and sufficient unto itself politically. A close parallel to the Alpine commune is
found among the Kabyles of the Atlas Mountains. Their political structure is based upon the
Jemaa or commune, a small sovereign republic whose independence is fiercely defended. It enjoys
complete local autonomy, is governed by an assembly of all the adult male inhabitants, and
grants this body the usual functions except the administration of justice, which, characteristically,
is replaced by blood feuds as the inalienable right of the individual. Romans, Arabs, Turks
and French have in turn exercised over these mountain Berbers only nominal control, except
when their internal dissensions made them vulnerable.[1386]

[Sidenote: Significance of their small size.]

The mountains, by the segregating power of their ridges and ranges, first produce these little
independent communities, and then, throwing around them strong protecting arms, enfold them
in an embrace which long provides security to them in their weakness. These minute mountain
states, therefore, tend to reflect in their size the isolation of their environment, and indirectly
the weakness of the surrounding nations. The original Swiss Eidgenossensschaft of the four
forest cantons, embedded in the high Alps, braced against a mountain wall, held its own against
the feeble feudal states of Austria and Germany. The rugged relief of Graubünden and the spirit
of freedom cradled there enabled its peasants in the Middle Ages to overthrow the feudal lords,
and to establish a federal republic. This typical mountain state was a league composed of three
other leagues. Each component league consisted of a group of districts, having the power of
sovereign states, and consisting in turn of a group of communes, which were quite independent
in local affairs. This triune league formed in time an alliance with the Swiss Confederation,
but did not become a member of it till the Vienna adjustment of 1815. Similar is the story
of the mountain shepherds of Appenzell, who formed a little peasant republic, despite their
bishop overlord of St. Gall; and who later during the Reformation, on the ground of religious
differences, divided into two yet smaller states.[1387] The relation between size and inaccessibility
is most strikingly illustrated in the high Himalayan ranges west of Kashmir and north of the
Punjab. Here is the Shinaka district, which includes the Chilas, Darel, Tanger and other valleys
branching off from the Indus, and which is inhabited by Dards of Indo-European stock. Each
Shinaka valley is a small cantonal republic, and each village of each republic is a commune
managing its own affairs by an assembly. One settlement of only twelve houses enjoys complete
autonomy. Besides the village assemblies there is a state parliament handling questions of
general policy, to which each village sends representatives. One dissentient vote can defeat
a measure. The majority cannot control the minority; for if one village of a state disagrees
with the others, it is free to carry out its own policy, even in the matter of foreign alliances.[1388]
Here is home rule run to seed.

[Sidenote: Slight power of mountain chiefs.]

Small size is sometimes coupled with monarchical rule, degenerating occasionally into despotism
among aggressive robber tribes. The inaccessible Hunza Valley is occupied on opposite sides
of its deep gorge by two rival states, the Hunzas and the Nagaris, whose combined population
amounts to scarcely 25,000 souls. Hostile to each other, they unite only to resist an invading
force. While the Hunza Thum is a tyrant, the Nagari ruler has little voice in the government.
The Tibeto-Burman hill folk of the eastern Himalayas are divided into clans, and concede a
mild authority to a chief who rules a group of clan villages, but only rarely is able to secure
power over a larger district. The Khasia Hills of Assam are broken up into twenty-three petty
states, each under its own Rajah or chief, who has, however, little authority beyond the administration
of justice.[1389]

Everywhere in mountain regions appears this repugnance to centralized authority. Protection
by environment obviates the necessity of protection through combination. The spirit of clan
exclusiveness, the absence of a common national sentiment, characterize equally the tribesmen
of mountainous Albania, of Persian Luristan,[1390] and highland Kurdistan. Along the rugged
upheaved area which forms the western boundary of India from the Khaibar Pass to the sea, British
officials have had to negotiate with the native Pathan and Baluch "jirgahs," assemblies of
the chief men of the countless clans into which the tribes are divided, as the only visible
form of authority tolerated.[1391] Combination must be voluntary and of a type to exact a modicum
of submission. These requirements are best answered by the confederation, which may gradually
assume a stable and elaborate form among an advanced people like the Swiss; or it may constitute
a loose yet effective union, as in the famous Samnite confederacy of the central Apennines;
or a temporary league like that of the ancient Arcadians, or the group of confederated sheiks
of Bellad el Kobail, the "Country of the Highlanders" in mountainous Yemen, who in 1790 established
a republican form of union for defense against their more powerful neighbors.[1392]

[Sidenote: Mountain isolation and differentiation.]

The power of mountains to protect makes them asylums of refuge for displaced peoples. This
fact explains the confused ethnology which often characterizes these isolated regions, especially
when they lie near or across natural highways of human migration. As a tide of humanity sweeps
around or across the mountains, a branch stream turns into a side valley, where it is caught
and held. There it remains unaltered, crystallizing in its seclusion, subjected for ages to
few modifying influences from without. Its people keep their own language and customs, little
affected by a totally different race stock similarly placed in a neighboring alcove of the
mountains. Lack of communication engenders an endless multiplication of dialects, as we find
them in the Alps, the Caucasus, in Kafirstan of the Hindu Kush and in Nepal. Diversity of speech,
itself a product of isolation, reacts upon that political and social aloofness of mountain
folk, to emphasize and fix it.

[Sidenote: Survival of primitive races in mountains.]

From this principle it follows that the same highland region shows strong differentiation and
marked social individuality from one district to another, and from one valley to the next,
despite a prevailing similarity of local geographic conditions. In fact, the very similarity
of those conditions, strong in their power to isolate, present the conditions for inevitable
variation. A mountain region gets its population from diverse sources, or, which is quite as
important, at different times from the same source. For instance, Nepal received contingents
of Rajput conquerors, dislodged from the Punjab, in the seventh century, the eleventh, and
finally the dominant Gurkhas at the end of the eighteenth. To-day these represent different
degrees of amalgamation with the local Tibetan stock of Nepal. They are distinguished from
each other by a diversity of languages, and a multiplicity of dialects, while the whole piedmont
of the country shows a yet different blend with the Aryan Hindus of the Ganges valley, who
have seeped into the Terai and been drawn up, as if by capillary attraction, into the hill
valleys of the outer range. The Vindhyan Range and its associated highlands, long before the
dawn of Indian history, caught and held in their careful embrace some of the fragile aboriginal
tribes like the Kolarian Ho, Santals and Korkus. Centuries later the Dravidian Bhils and Gonds
sought refuge here before the advancing Indo-Aryans, and found asylums in the secluded valleys.[1393]
Finally those same northern plains whence the Dravidians had come, after the Mohammedan conquest
of central India in the sixteenth century, sent flying to the refuge of the hills a large contingent
of Hindus of mingled Dravidian and Aryan stocks, but stamped with the culture of the Ganges
basin. These occupied the richer valleys and the more accessible plateaus of the highlands,
driving the primitive Gonds and Bhils back into the remoter recesses of the mountains.[1394]
Dravidians and aboriginal Kolarians survive in their purity in the wilder and more inaccessible
regions, but in the lower valleys their upper classes show signs of mixtures with the Rajput
invaders, while the lower classes betray little Aryan blood.[1395]

[Sidenote: Diversity of peoples and dialects.]

Afghanistan, of disordered relief, set as a transit region between the plains of Mesopotamia,
the Oxus and the Indus, has a confused ethnology in keeping with the tangle of dissected plateaus
and mountain systems which constitute its surface. Here we find three distinct branches of
the Indo-European race, divided up into various peoples of diverse tongues and subdivided further
into countless tribes; and two branches of Mongol-Tartars scattered, as if out of a pepper
box, from the Helmund to the Oxus, tossed in among diverse peoples of Iranic and Galcha origin
in hopeless confusion. The various Afghan tribes, separated from each other by natural barriers
and intervening alien stocks, though similar in physical type, speech, religion and culture,
have no sense of unity, no common political aims, while the appalling list of tribes constituting
the population of the country[1396] offers little hope of Afghanistan ever developing national
cohesion. Kafiristan alone, which lies in the Hindu Kush range for the most part at an altitude
of 12,000 feet or more, harbors in its recesses many remnants of primitive peoples, speaking
various languages and dialects, strangers alike to any native affinity or political union.
It is a mere agglomeration of ethnic fragments, in which the people of one village are often
unable to converse with those of the next.[1397] Relief has fashioned the ethnology of the
Caucasus in the same way. No other equally small area in the world contains such a variety
of peoples and tongues, differing from one another in race, language, and customs so fundamentally
as the Caucasus. From the heterogeneous survivals of extremely old ethnic stocks, lodged in
the high valleys, to the intrusive Russians of the lower piedmont, the Caucasus might be called
an ethnographical sample card.[1398]

The rugged configuration of the Alps, from the Rhone to the Danube, has preserved the broad-headed
Alpine race, which was perhaps the primitive stock of Central Europe. The great river valleys
leading into this massive highland, like the Rhine, Aar, Inn and Adige, show the intrusion
of a long-headed race from both north and south; but lofty and remote valleys off the main
routes of travel, like the Hither Rhine about Dissentis, the little Stanzerthal of the upper
Inn, and the Passierthal of the upper Adige above Meran, show the race preserved in its purity
by the isolating environment.[1399] Here each segregated lateral valley becomes an area of
marked linguistic and social differentiation; only where it opens into the wider longitudinal
valleys are its peculiarities of speech and custom diluted by the intrusive current of another
race. Switzerland has received three different streams of language, and broken them up into
numerous rivulets of dialect. On its small area of 16,125 square miles (41,346 square kilometers)
thirty-five dialects of German are spoken, sixteen of French, eight of Italian and five of
Romansch, a primitive and degenerate Latin tongue, surviving from the ancestral days of Roman
occupation.[1400] The yet smaller territory of the Tyrol has all these languages except French,
whose place is taken by various forms of Slavonic speech, which have entered by the western
tributaries of the Danube.[1401]

[Sidenote: Constriction of mountain areas of ethnic survivals.]

Rarely is a polyglot mountain population able to work out its own political salvation, as the
Swiss have done. More often political union must be forced upon them from without. Oftener
still, when the highlanders are primitive survivals, ill-matched against the superior invaders
from the plain, they are doomed to a process of constriction of territory and deterioration
of numbers, which proceeds slowly or rapidly according to the inaccessibility of their environment
and the energy of the intruders. Deliberate, unenterprising nations, like the Chinese, Turks
and Indo-Aryans long tolerate the presence of alien mountain tribes, who remain like enemies
brought to bay in their isolated fortresses. The conquerors throw around them at their leisure
a cordon of settlement, which, slowly ascending the piedmont, draws closer and closer about
the mountaineers. The situation of many mountain tribes reminds one of a besieged stronghold.
Russian wars against the Caucasus have rightly been described as protracted sieges. The heroic
history of Switzerland in relation to its neighbors has been that of a skillfully conducted
defense, both military and diplomatic. The territory of China is dotted over with detached
groups of aborigines, who have survived wherever a friendly mountain has offered them an asylum.
Variously known as Lolos, Mantze or Miaotse, they have preserved everywhere a semi-independence
in pathless mountains, whither Chinese troops do not dare to follow them;[1402] but the more
numerous and patient Chinese agriculturalists are in many sections slowly encroaching upon
their territories, driving them farther and farther into the recesses of their highlands. The
same process goes on in Formosa, where the Chinese have gradually forced the native Malays
into mountain fastnesses among the peaks which rise to 14,000 feet (4500 meters). There, split
up by internecine feuds into numberless clans and tribes, ignorant of one another's languages,
raiding each other's territories and the coastal plains tilled by Chinese colonists, they await
their doom, while the piedmont zone between has already given birth to a typical border race
of halfbreeds, more Chinese than Malay.[1403]

[Sidenote: Isolation and retardation of mountain regions.]

"To have and to hold" is the motto of the mountains. Like remote islands, they are often museums
of social antiquities. Antiquated races and languages abound. The mountaineers of the Southern
Appalachians speak to-day an eighteenth century English. Their literature is the ballad poetry
of old England and Scotland, handed down from parent to child. Clan feuds settle questions
of justice, as in the Caucasus and the Apennines. Religion is orthodox to the last degree,
sectarianism is rigid, and Joshua's power over the sun remains in some lonely valleys undiscounted.[1404]
These are all the marks of isolation and retardation which appear in similar environments elsewhere.
Especially religious dogmas tend to show in mountains a tenacity of life impossible in the
plains. The Kafirs, inhabiting the high Hindu Kush Mountains of Badakshan, and apparently of
Pelasgic, early Greek, or Persian origin, have a religion blended of paganism, Zoroastrianism
and Brahmanism.[1405] One intruding faith has been unable to dislodge the previous incumbent,
so the three have combined. The great historical destiny of the small, barren, isolated Judean
plateau was to hold aloof the chaste religion of the desert-bred Jews from the sensuous agricultural
gods of the Canaanites; to conserve and fix it; if need be, to narrow it to a provincial tribal
faith, to stamp it with exclusiveness, conservatism, and formalism, as its adherents with bigotry,[1406]
for this is always the effect of geographical seclusion. But when all these limitations of
Judaism are acknowledged, the fact remains that that segregated mountain environment performed
the inestimable service for the world of keeping pure and undefiled the first and last great
gift of the desert, a monotheistic faith.

Buddhism, once the official religion of Korea but disestablished three centuries ago, has taken
refuge in the Diamond Mountains, far from the main roads; there a dull, moribund form of the
faith dozes on in the monasteries and monastic shrines of these secluded highlands.[1407] Driven
out of India, Buddhism survives only in the Himalayan border of the country among the local
Tibeto-Burman peoples, and in Ceylon, whose mountain city of Kandy is its stronghold. The persecuted
Waldenses, a heretic sect who fled in 1178 from the cities of France to the Alps, took refuge
in the remote valleys of the Pellice, Chisone, and Augrogne some thirty miles southwest of
Turin. There, protected equally against attack and modification, the Waldenses have maintained
the old tenets and organization of their religion.[1408]

[Sidenote: Conservatism of mountain peoples.]

The mountain-dweller is essentially conservative. There is little in his environment to stimulate
him to change, and little reaches him from the outside world. The "spirit of the times" is
generally the spirit of a past time, when it has penetrated to his remote upland. He is strangely
indifferent to what goes on in the great outstretched plains below him. What filters in to
him from the outside has little suggestion for him, because it does not accord with the established
order which he has always known. Hence innovation is distasteful to him. This repugnance to
change reaches its clearest expression, perhaps, in the development and preservation of national
costumes. Tracht, which is crystallized style in dress, appears nowhere so widespread and so
abundantly differentiated as in mountain districts. In Switzerland, every canton has its distinctive
costume which has come down from a remote past. The peasants of Norway, of the German and Austrian
Alps, of the Basque settlements in the Pyrenees, of mountain-bound Alsace and Bohemia, give
local color to the landscape by the picturesqueness of their national dress.

[Sidenote: Mental and moral qualities.]

With this conservatism of the mountaineer is generally coupled suspicion toward strangers,
extreme sensitiveness to criticism, superstition, strong religious feeling, and an intense
love of home and family. The bitter struggle for existence makes him industrious, frugal, provident;
and, when the marauding stage has been outgrown, he is peculiarly honest as a rule. Statistics
of crime in mountain regions show few crimes against property though many against person. When
the mountain-bred man comes down into the plains, he brings with him therefore certain qualities
which make him a formidable competitor in the struggle for existence,--the strong muscles,
unjaded nerves, iron purpose, and indifference to luxury bred in him by the hard conditions
of his native environment.

CHAPTER XVII

THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE

[Sidenote: Importance of climatic influences.]

Climate enters fundamentally into all consideration of geographic influences, either by implication
or explicitly. It is a factor in most physiological and psychological effects of environment.
It underlies the whole significance of zonal location, continental and insular. Large territorial
areas are favorable to improved variation in men and animals partly because they comprise a
diversity of natural conditions, of which a wide range of climates forms one. This is also
one advantage of a varied relief, especially in the Tropics, where all the zones may be compressed
into a small area on the slopes of high mountains like the Andes and Kilimanjaro. Climate fixes
the boundaries of human habitation in Arctic latitudes and high altitudes by drawing the dead-line
to all organic life. It dominates life in steppes and torrid deserts as in sub-polar wastes.
It encourages intimacy with the sea in tropical Malays and Polynesians, and like a slave-driver,
scourges on the fur-clad Eskimo to reap the harvest of the deep. It is always present in that
intricate balance of geographic factors which produces a given historical result, throwing
its weight now into one side of the scales, now into the other. It underlies the production,
distribution and exchange of commodities derived from the vegetable and animal kingdoms, influences
methods of agriculture, and the efficiency of human labor in various industries.[1409] Hence
it is a potent factor in the beginning and in the evolution of civilization, so far as this
goes hand in hand with economic development.

[Sidenote: Climate in the interplay of geographic factors.]

The foregoing chapters have therefore been indirectly concerned with climate to no small degree,
but they have endeavored to treat the subject analytically, showing climate as working with
or against or in some combination with other geographic factors. This course was necessary,
because climatic influences are so conspicuous and so important that by the older geographers
like Montesquieu[1410] and others, they have been erected into a blanket theory, and made to
explain a wide range of social and historical phenomena which were properly the effect of other
geographic factors.

[Sidenote: Direct and indirect effects of climate.]

For a clear understanding of climatic influences, it is necessary to adhere to the chief characteristics
of the atmosphere, such as heat and cold, moisture and aridity, and to consider the effect
of zonal location, winds and relief in the production and distribution of these; also to distinguish
between direct and indirect results of climate, temporary and permanent, physiological and
psychological ones, because the confusion of these various effects breeds far-fetched conclusions.
The direct modification of man by climate is partly an a priori assumption, because the incontestable
evidences of such modification are not very numerous, however strong the probability may be.
The effect of climate upon plant and animal life is obvious, and immediately raises the assumption
that man has been similarly influenced. But there is this difference: in contrast to the helpless
dependence upon environment of stationary plants and animals, whose range of movement is strictly
determined by conditions of food and temperature, the great mobility of man, combined with
his inventiveness, enables him to flee or seek almost any climatic condition, and to emancipate
himself from the full tyranny of climatic control by substituting an indirect economic effect
for a direct physical effect.

The direct results of climate are various, though some are open to the charge of imperfect
proof. Even the relation of nigrescence to tropical heat, which seems to be established by
the geographical distribution of negroid races in the Old World, fails to find support from
the facts of pigmentation among the American Indians from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Nevertheless
climate undoubtedly modifies many physiological processes in individuals and peoples,[1411]
affects their immunity from certain classes of diseases and their susceptibility to others,
influences their temperament, their energy, their capacity for sustained or for merely intermittent
effort, and therefore helps determine their efficiency as economic and political agents.

While producing these direct effects, climate also influences man indirectly by controlling
the wide range of his life conditions dependent upon the plant and animal life about him. It
dictates what crops he may raise, and has it in its power to affect radically the size of his
harvest. It decides which flocks and herds are best suited to his environment, and therefore
directs his pastoral activities, whether he keeps reindeer, camels, llamas, horses or horned
cattle. By interdicting both agriculture and stock-raising, as in Greenland whose ice cap leaves
little surface free even for reindeer moss, it condemns the inhabitants forever to the uncertain
subsistence of the hunter. Where it encourages the growth of large forests which harbor abundant
game and yield abundant fruits, as in the hot, moist equatorial belt and on rainy mountain
slopes, it prolongs the hunter stage of development, retards the advance to agriculture. Climate
thus helps to influence the rate and the limit of cultural development. It determines in part
the local supply of raw material with which man has to work, and hence the majority of his
secondary activities, except where these are expended on mineral resources. It decides the
character of his food, clothing, and dwelling, and ultimately of his civilization.

[Sidenote: Effect of climate upon relief.]

The very ground under man's feet, moreover, feels the molding hand of climate. In one region
a former age of excessive cold has glaciated the surface and scoured off the fertile loam down
to the underlying rock, or left the land coated with barren glacial drift or more productive
clays. In another, the cold still persists and caps the land with ice and snow, or, as in the
tundra, underlays it with a stratum of frozen earth, which keeps the surface wet and chilled
even in the height of summer. In yet other regions, abundant moisture combined with heat covers
the ground with a pad of fertile humus, while some hundred miles away drying trade winds parch
and crack the steppe vegetation, convert most of its organic substance into gases, and leave
only a small residue to enrich the soil. Rain itself modifies the relief of the land, and therefore
often decides in a slow, cosmic way what shall be the ultimate destination of its precious
store of water. A heavy precipitation on the windward side of a mountain range, by increasing
the mechanical force of its drainage streams, makes them bite their way back into the heart
of the system and decapitate the rivers on the leeward side, thus diminishing the volume of
water left to irrigate the rainless slope. Thus the hydra-headed Amazon has been spreading
and multiplying its sources among the Andean valleys, to the detriment of agriculture on the
dry Pacific slope; thus the torrents of the Western Ghats, gorged by the monsoon rains from
the Indian Ocean, are slowly nipping off the streams of the ill-watered Deccan, [See map page
484.] All these direct and indirect effects of climate may combine to produce ultimate politico-geographical
results which manifest themselves in the expansion, power and permanence of states.

[Sidenote: Climate limits the habitable area.]

Climatic conditions limit the habitable area of the earth. This is their most important anthropo-geographic
effect. At either pole lurks an invincible foe, with whom expanding humanity must always reckon,
and who brooks little encroachment upon his territory. His weapon is the restriction of organic
life, without which man cannot exist. The geographical boundaries of organic life, however,
are wider than those of human life. The consequence of this climatic control, therefore, is
not only a narrowed distribution of the human race, but a concentration which intensifies the
struggle for existence, forces the utilization of all the available area, and thereby in every
locality stimulates adaptation to environment.

[Sidenote: Adaptability of man to climatic extremes.]

Man ranks among the most adaptable organic beings on the earth. No climate is absolutely intolerable
to him. Only the absence of food supply or of all marketable commodities will exclude him from
the most inhospitable region. His dwellings are found from sea level up to an altitude of 5000
meters or more, where the air pressure is little over one half that on the coast.[1412] Seventeen
per cent. of the towns and cities of Bolivia are located at an elevation above 13,000 feet
(4000 meters), while Aullagas occupies a site 15,700 feet or nearly 5000 meters above the sea.[1413]
Mineral wealth explains these high Bolivian settlements, just as it draws the Mexican sulphur
miners to temporary residence in the crater of Popocatepetl at an altitude of 17,787 feet (5420
meters), from their permanent dwellings a thousand meters below.[1414] The laborers employed
in the construction of the Oroya railroad in Peru became rapidly accustomed to work in the
rarefied air at an elevation of 4000 to 4800 meters. The trade routes over the Andes and Himalayan
ranges often cross passes at similar altitudes; the Karakorum road mounts to 18,548 feet (5,650
meters). Yet these great elevations do not prevent men going their way and doing the day's
work, although the unacclimated tenderfoot is liable to attacks of mountain sickness in consequence
of the rarefied air.[1415]

Man makes himself at home in any zone. The cold pole of the earth, so far as recorded temperatures
show, is the town of Verkhoyansk in northeastern Siberia, whose mean January temperature is
54 F. below zero (-48 Centigrade). Massawa, one of the hottest spots in the furnace of Africa
is the capital of the Italian colony of Eritrea. However, extremes both of heat and cold reduce
the density of population, the scale and efficiency of economic enterprises. The greatest events
of universal history and especially the greatest historical developments belong to the North
Temperate Zone. The decisive voyages of discovery emanated thence, though the needs of trade
and the steady winds of low latitudes combined to carry them to the Tropics. The coldest lands
of the earth are either uninhabited, like Spitzenbergen, or sparsely populated, like northern
Siberia. The hottest regions, also, are far from being so densely populated as many temperate
countries.[1416] [See maps pages 8, 9, and 612.] The fact that they are for the most part dependencies
or former colonial possessions of European powers indicates their retarded economic and political
development. The contrast between the Mongol Tunguse, who lead the life of hunters and herders
in Arctic Siberia, and the related Manchus, who conquered and rule the temperate lands of China,
shows how climates help differentiate various branches of the same ethnic stock; and this contrast
only parallels that between the Eskimo and Aztec offshoots of the American Indians, the Norwegian
and Italian divisions of the white race.

0°C = 32°F. 20°C = 68°F. 30°C = 86°F.]

[Sidenote: Temperature as modified by oceans and winds.]

The zonal location of a country indicates roughly the degree of heat which it receives from
the sun. It would do this accurately if variations of relief, prevailing winds and proximity
of the oceans did not enter as disturbing factors. Since water heats and cools more slowly
than the land, the ocean is a great reservoir of warmth in winter and of cold in summer, and
exercises therefore an equalizing effect upon the temperature of the adjacent continents, far
as these effects can be carried by the wind. The ocean is also the great source of moisture,
and this, too, it distributes over the land through the agency of the wind. Where warm ocean
currents, like the Gulf Stream and Kuro Siwa, penetrate into temperate or sub-polar latitudes,
or where cool ones, like the Peruvian and Benguela Currents wash the coasts of tropical regions,
they enhance the power of the ocean and wind to mitigate the extremes of temperature on land.
The warm currents, moreover, loading the air above them with vapor, provide a store of rain
to the nearest wind-swept land. Hence both the rainfall and temperature of a given country
depend largely upon its neighboring water and air currents, and its accessibility to the rain-bearing
winds. If it occupies a marked central position in temperate latitudes, like eastern Russia
or the Great Plains of our semi-arid West, it receives limited moisture and suffers the extreme
temperatures of a typical continental climate. The same result follows if it holds a distinctly
peripheral location, and yet lies in the rain-shadow of a mountain barrier, like western Peru,
Patagonia and Sweden north of the sixtieth parallel. [See map page 484.]

[Sidenote: Effect of the westerlies.]

Owing to the prevalence of westerly winds in the Temperate Zones and particularly in the North
Temperate Zone, the mean annual temperature is high on the western face of the northern continents,
but drops rapidly toward the east.[1417] This is especially true of winter temperatures, which
even near the eastern coast show the severity of a continental climate. Sitka and New York,
Trondhjem and Peking have the same mean January temperatures, though Peking lies in about the
latitude of Madrid, over twenty-three degrees farther south.

Europe's location in the path of the North Atlantic westerlies, swept by winds from a small
and narrow ocean which has been super-heated by the powerful Gulf Stream, secures for that
continent a more equable climate and milder winters than corresponding latitudes on the western
coasts of North America, whose winds from the wide Pacific are not so warm.[1418] Moreover,
a coastal rampart of mountains from Alaska to Mexico restricts the beneficial influences of
the Pacific climate to a narrow seaboard, excludes them from the vast interior, which by reason
of cold or aridity or both must forever renounce great economic or historical significance,
unless its mineral resources developed unsuspected importance. In Europe, the absence of mountain
barriers across the course of these westerly winds from Norway to central Spain, and the unobstructed
avenue offered to them by the Mediterranean Sea during fall and winter, enable all the Atlantic's
mitigating influences of warmth and moisture to penetrate inland, and temper the climate of
Europe as far east as St. Petersburg and Constantinople. Thus several factors have combined
to give the western half of Europe an extraordinarily favorable climate. They have therefore
greatly broadened its zone of historical intensity toward the north, pushed it up to the sixtieth
parallel, while the corresponding zone in eastern Asia finds its northern limit at the fortieth
degree.

[Sidenote: Rainfall.]

Moisture and warmth are essential to all that life upon which human existence depends. Hence
temperature and rainfall are together the most important natural assets of a country, because
of their influence upon its productivity. The grazing capacity and wheat yield of southern
Australia increase almost regularly with every added inch of rainfall.[1419] The map of population
for the Empire of India clearly shows that a high degree of density accompanies a high and
certain rainfall. Exceptions occur only where hilly or mountainous tracts offer scant arable
areas, or where plains and valleys are sparsely populated owing to political troubles or unhealthiness.
Nearly three-tenths of the population are found crowded together on the one-tenth of India's
level territory which is blessed with a rainfall above the average for the country.[1420] Deserts
which yield nothing are purely climatic phenomena. Steppes which facilitate the historical
movement, and forests which block it, are products of scant or ample precipitation. The zonal
distribution of rainfall, with its maxima in the Tropics and the Temperate Zones, and its minima
in the trade-wind belts and polar regions, reinforces and emphasizes the influence of temperature
in determining certain great cultural and economic zones.

In equatorial regions, which have an abundant rainfall throughout the year, agriculture is
directed toward fruits and roots; only in certain districts can it include cereals, and then
only rice and maize. The temperate grains demand some dry summer weeks for their maturity.
Excessive moisture in Ireland has practically excluded wheat-growing, which in England and
Scotland also is restricted chiefly to the drier eastern counties.[1421] It thrives, on the
other hand, in Manitoba and the Red River region even with a short season of scant rainfall,
because this comes in the spring when moisture is most needed.[1422] Most important to man,
therefore, is the question how and when the rainfall is distributed, and with what regularity
it comes. Monsoon and trade-wind districts labor under the disadvantage of a wet and dry season,
and a variability which brings tragic results, since it easily reduces a barely adequate rainfall
to disastrous drought. These are the lands where wind and weather lord it over man. If the
rains hold off too long, or stop too soon, or withhold even a small portion of their accustomed
gift, famine stalks abroad.

[Sidenote: Temperature and zonal location.]

Temperature, the other important element of climate, depends primarily upon zonal location,
which has far different historical results from central and peripheral location, continental
and insular. It determines the amount of heat received from the sun, though air and ocean currents
may redistribute that heat within certain limits, and humidity or aridity modify its effects.
Still zonal distinctions remain. The great climatic regions of the earth, like the hot, wet
equatorial belt or the warm, dry trade-wind belts or the cool, well-watered temperate zones,
constitute, through the medium of their economic products and their climatically imposed methods
of production, so many socio-political areas, regardless of ethnic and political boundaries.
The Berber nomads of the northern Sahara live much as the Semitic Bedouins of the Syrian desert
or the Turkoman stock of arid Turkestan. They have the same tribal government, the same scattered
distribution in small groups, the same economic basis of subsistence, though of different races
and dominated respectively by France, Turkey and Russia. The history of the tropical Antilles
has in both its economic and political features paralleled that of the East Indies since the
early 16th century. Temperate South America promises to follow in the historical footsteps
of temperate North America, South Africa in those of Europe and temperate Australia.

[Sidenote: Reactions of contrasted zones.]

While people of the same latitude live approximately under the same temperature conditions,
those of contrasted zones are subjected to markedly different influences. They develop different
degrees of civilization, wealth, economic efficiency, and density of population; hence they
give rise to great historical movements in the form of migration, conquest, colonization, and
commerce, which, like convection currents, seek to equalize the differences and reach an equilibrium.
Nature has fixed the mutual destiny of tropical and temperate zones, for instance, as complementary
trade regions. The hot belt produces numerous things that can never grow in colder countries,
while a much shorter list of products, coupled, however, with greater industrial efficiency,
is restricted to the Temperate Zone. This explains the enormous importance of the East Indian
trade for Europe in ancient and medieval times, the value of tropical possessions for commercial
countries like England and Holland. It throws light upon the persistence of the tropical plantation
system in the Dutch East Indies and republican Mexico, as formerly in the sugar and cotton
fields of the Southern States, with its relentless grip upon the throat of national life in
hot lands.

[Sidenote: Temperate products from tropical highlands.]

Tropical regions, however, may profit by the fact that their mountains and plateaus permit
the cultivation of temperate crops. India during the last century has introduced tea culture
extensively on the Assam and Nilgiri Hills, and in the Himalayan valleys up to an altitude
of 7000 feet.[1423] Besides this temperate product, it has put large areas into cotton, chiefly
in the peninsular plateau of the Deccan, and by means of these two crops has caused a considerable
readjustment in world commerce.[1424] Nevertheless, here the infringement of the principle
of tropical production in the torrid zone is after all slight. In tropical America, on the
other hand, the case is quite different; this region presents an interesting paradox in relation
to its foreign commerce. Here the highlands are the chief seats of population. They contain,
moreover, the most industrious and intelligent native stock, due to geographical and historical
causes running back into the ancient civilizations, as well as the largest proportions of immigrant
Europeans. This is true not only of the Cordilleran states from northern Mexico to the borders
of Chile, but also of Brazil, whose center of population falls on the plateau behind Rio de
Janeiro and Santos. The isolation of these high plateaus excludes them to a serious extent
from foreign trade, while their great altitude permits only temperate products, with the exception
of sub-tropical coffee, which is their only crop meeting a great demand. The world wants, on
the other hand, the long list of lowland tropical exports which torrid America furnishes as
yet in inadequate amounts, owing to the lack of an industrious and abundant lowland population.
Commerce will eventually experience a readjustment in these localities to the natural basis
of tropical production; but how soon or how effectively this change will take place depends
upon the question of immigration of foreign tropical peoples, or the more difficult problem
of white acclimatization.[1425]

[Sidenote: Isothermal lines in anthropo-geography.]

Despite some purely climatological objections, anthropo-geography finds the division of climatic
zones according to certain isothermal lines of mean annual temperature the most expedient one
for its purpose. The hot zone may be taken as the belt north and south of the equator enclosed
between the annual isotherms of 20° C. (68° F.) These hold a course generally far outside the
two tropics, and in the northern continents frequently reach the thirty-fifth parallel. The
temperate climatic zones extend from the annual isotherm of 20° C. to that of 0° C. (32° F.),
which bears little relation to the polar circles forming the limits of the solar Temperate
Zone. The north temperate climatic zone has been further sub-divided along the annual isotherm
of 5° C. (41° F.), distinguishing thus the warmer southern belt, which forms preëminently the
zone of greatest historical intensity. The areas beyond the annual isotherms of 0°C. belong
to the barren cold zones. [See map page 612.]

[Sidenote: Historical effect of compressed isotherms.]

This isothermal division of the climatic zones is abundantly justified, because the duration
of a given degree of heat or cold in any region is a dominant factor in its human, animal,
and plant life. A map of the mean annual isotherms of the earth is therefore eloquent of the
relation between historical development and this one phase of climate. Where the lines run
far apart, they enclose extensive areas of similar temperature; and where they approach, they
group together regions of contrasted temperatures. The compression of climatic differences
into a small area enlivens and accentuates the process of historical development. It produces
the same sort of effect as the proximity of contrasted reliefs. Nowhere else in the world do
the tropical and frigid climatic areas, as defined on the north and south by the annual isothermal
lines of 20°C. and 0°C. respectively, lie so near together as in Labrador and northern Florida.
Separated here by only twenty degrees of latitude, on the opposite side of the Atlantic they
diverge so sharply as to include the whole western face of Europe, from Hammerfest and the
North Cape down to the Canary Islands and the crest of the Atlas Mountains in Africa, a stretch
of forty-two degrees of latitude. This approximation of contrasted climatic districts in North
America was an immense force in stimulating the early economic development of the Thirteen
Colonies, and in maturing them to the point of political autonomy. It gave New England commerce
command of a nearby tropical trade in the West Indies, of sub-tropical products in the southern
colonies, in close proximity to all the contrasted products of a cold climate--dense northern
forests for naval stores and lumber, and an inexhaustible supply of fish from polar currents,
which met a strong demand in Europe and the Antilles. The sudden southward drop of the 0°C.
annual isothermal line toward the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes brought the northwestern
fur trade to the back gate of New York, where it opened on the Mohawk and upper Hudson, and
brought prosperity to the young colony. Even to-day the center of collection for the Canadian
fur fields is Quebec, located at 47° north latitude, while the corresponding point of concentration
in Europe for the furs of Russia and Siberia is Nizhni-Novgorod, which lies ten degrees farther
north.[1426]

[Sidenote: Effect of slight climatic differences.]

This compression of the isotherms emphasizes the differences of national characters produced
in part by dissimilar climatic conditions. Contrasts in temperament, manner of life, and point
of view, like that between the New Englander and Virginian, Chilean and Bolivian in the Americas,
Breton and Provençal in France, Castilian and Andalusian in Spain, Gurkha and Bengali in India,
seem to bleach out when they are located far apart, owing to many grades of transition between;
but they become striking, stimulating, productive of important economic and political results,
when close juxtaposition enables them to react sharply one upon the other. In effecting these
nice differentiations of local types, climate is nearly always one of the factors at work,
emphasizing perhaps an existing ethnic difference. Even the slight variations of temperature
to be found in the same zone or the same climatic region produce distinct results, especially
where they are harnessed, as is usually the case, with some other geographic condition of relief,
area or soil, pulling in the same direction. Mexico, Peru, Italy, Switzerland, Greece and Asia
Minor, with its high plateau interior and its contrasted Euxine and Aegean coasts, represent
each a complex of climatic differences, which, reinforced by other geographic factors, have
made in these regions a polychrome picture of national life.

[Sidenote: Effect of climate upon distribution of immigration]

Climatic contrasts aid differentiation also by influencing both natural and artificial selection
in the distribution of peoples. This effect is conspicuous in the distribution of immigrants
in all colonial lands like Africa, South America and in every part of the United States.[1427]
The warm, moist air of the Gulf and South Atlantic States is attracting back to the congenial
habitat of the "black belt" the negroes of the North, where, moreover, their numbers are being
further depleted by a harsh climate, which finds in them a large proportion of the unfit. The
presence of a big negro laboring class in the South, itself primarily a result of climate,
has long served to exclude foreign immigration, which sought therefore the unoccupied lands
and the congenial climate of the more bracing North. Hence it is both a direct and indirect
effect of climate that the North shows a large proportion of aliens, and the white population
of the South an almost unadulterated English stock.

[Sidenote: Climate and race temperament.]

The influence of climate upon race temperament, both as a direct and indirect effect, can not
be doubted, despite an occasional exception, like the cheery, genial Eskimos, who seem to carry
in their sunny natures an antidote to the cold and poverty of their environment. In general
a close correspondence obtains between climate and temperament. The northern peoples of Europe
are energetic, provident, serious, thoughtful rather than emotional, cautious rather than impulsive.
The southerners of the sub-tropical Mediterranean basin are easy-going, improvident except
under pressing necessity, gay, emotional, imaginative, all qualities which among the negroes
of the equatorial belt degenerate into grave racial faults. If, as many ethnologists maintain,
the blond Teutons of the north are a bleached out branch of the brunette Mediterranean race,
this contrast in temperament is due to climate. A comparison of northern and southern peoples
of the same race and within the same Temperate Zone reveals numerous small differences of nature
and character, which can be traced back directly or indirectly to climatic differences, and
which mount up to a considerable sum total. The man of the colder habitat is more domestic,
stays more in his home. Though he is not necessarily more moderate or continent than the southerner,
he has to pay more for his indulgences, so he is economical in expenditures. With the southerner
it is "easy come, easy go." He therefore suffers more frequently in a crisis. The low cost
of living keeps down his wages, so that as a laborer he is poorly paid. This fact, together
with his improvidence, tends to swell the proletariat in warm countries of the Temperate Zone;
and though here it does not produce the distressing impression of a proletariat in Dublin or
Liverpool or Boston, it is always degrading. It levels society and economic status downward,
while in the cooler countries of the Temperate Zone, the process is upward. The laborer of
the north, owing to his providence and larger profits, which render small economies possible,
is constantly recruited into the class of the capitalist.

[Sidenote: Contrasted temperaments in the same nation.]

Everywhere a cold climate puts a steadying hand on the human heart and brain. It gives an autumn
tinge to life. Among the folk of warmer lands eternal spring holds sway. National life and
temperament have the buoyancy and thoughtlessness of childhood, its charm and its weakness.
These distinctions and contrasts meet us everywhere. The southern Chinese, and especially the
Cantonese, is more irresponsible and hot-blooded than the Celestial of the north, though the
bitter struggle for existence in the over-crowded Kwangtung province has made him quite as
industrious; but on his holidays he takes his pleasure in singing, gambling, and various forms
of dissipation. The southern Russian is described as more light-hearted than his kinsman of
the bleaker north, though both are touched with the melancholy of the Slav. In this case, however,
the question immediately arises, how far the dweller of the southern wheat lands owes his happy
disposition to the easy conditions of life in the fertile Ukraine, as opposed to the fiercer
struggle for subsistence in the glaciated lake and forest belt of the north. Similar distinctions
of climate and national temperament exist in the two sections of Germany. The contrast between
the energetic, enterprising, self-contained Saxon of the Baltic lowland and the genial, spontaneous
Bavarian or Swabian is conspicuous, though the only geographical advantage possessed by the
latter is a warmer temperature attended by a sunnier sky. He contains in his blood a considerable
infusion of the Alpine stock and is therefore racially differentiated from the northern Teuton,[1428]
but this hardly accounts for the difference of temperament, because the same Alpine stock is
plodding, earnest and rather stolid on the northern slope of the Alps, but in the warm air
and sunshine of the southern slope, it abates these qualities and conforms more nearly to the
Italian type of character. The North Italian, however, presents a striking contrast to the
indolent, irresponsible, improvident citizens of Naples, Calabria and Sicily, who belong to
the contrasted Mediterranean race, and have been longer subjected to the relaxing effects of
sub-tropical heat.

[Sidenote: Complexity of the geographic problem.]

Where the climatic difference is small, it is nevertheless often conspicuous enough to eclipse
other concomitant factors which are at work, and hence to encourage the formation of some easy
blanket theory of climatic influences. But just because the difference is slight, all attending
geographic and ethnic circumstances ought to be scrutinized, to insure a correct statement
of the geographical equation. The contrast between the light-hearted, gracious peasants of
warm, sunny Andalusia and the reserved, almost morose inhabitants of cool and cloudy Asturias
is the effect not only of climate but of the easy life in a fertile river plain, opposed to
the bitter struggle for existence in the rough Cantabrian Mountains. Moreover, a strong infusion
of Alpine blood has given this group of Spanish mountaineers the patience and seriousness which
characterizes the race in other parts of continental Europe.[1429] The conditions which have
differentiated Scotch from English have been climate, relief, location, geologic composition
of the soil, and ethnic composition of the two peoples. The divergent development of Northerners
and Southerners in America arose from contrasts in climate, soil and area. It was not only
the enervating heat and moisture of the Southern States, but also the large extent of their
fertile area which necessitated slave labor, introduced the plantation system, and resulted
in the whole aristocratic organization of society in the South.[1430]

[Sidenote: Monotonous climatic conditions.]

When one type of climate extends monotonously over a vast area, as in Russia. Siberia, Central
Asia or immense tracts of Africa, the differences of temperature which prick and stimulate
national endeavor in small climatic districts here lose much of their force. Their effects
flatten out into insignificance, overwhelmed by the encounter with too large a territory. All
the southern continents are handicapped by the monotony of their zonal location. The map of
annual isotherms shows Africa quite enclosed between the two torrid lines of 20° Centigrade,
except for a narrow sub-tropical belt along the Barbary coast in the north, and in the south
an equally narrow littoral extending east and north from the Cape of Good Hope. At first glance,
the large area of South Africa lying on the temperate side of the Tropic of Capricorn raises
hopes for a rich economic, social and cultural development here; but these are dashed by an
examination of the isotherms. Excessive heat lays its retarding touch upon everything, while
a prevailing aridity (rainfall less than 10 inches or 25 centimeters), except on the narrow
windward slope of the eastern mountains, gives the last touch of climatic monotony. The coastal
belt of Cape Colony and Natal raise tropical and sub-tropical products[1431] like all the rest
of the continent, while the semi-arid interior is committed with little variations to pastoral
life. [See maps pages 484 and 487.] Climatic monotony, operating alone, would have condemned
South Africa to poverty of development, and will unquestionably always avail to impoverish
its national life. South African history has been made by its mines and by its location on
the original water route to India; the first have dominated its economic development, and the
latter has largely determined its ethnic elements--English, Dutch, and French Huguenots, while
the magnet of the mines has drawn other nationalities and especially a large Jewish contingent
into the urban centers of the Rand.[1432] In the background is the native Kaffir and Hottentot
stocks, whose blood filters into the lower classes of the white population. The diversity of
these ethnic elements may compensate in part for the monotony of climatic conditions, which
promise to check differentiation. However, climatic control is here peculiarly despotic. We
see how it has converted the urban merchants of Holland and the skillful Huguenot artisan of
France into the crude pastoral Boer of the Transvaal.

In contrast to South Africa, temperate South America has an immense advantage in its large
area lying outside the 20°C. isotherm, and in the wide range of mean temperatures (from 20°C.
to 5°C.) found between the Tropic of Capricorn and Tierra del Fuego. Climate and relief have
combined to make the mouth of the La Plata River the site of the largest city of the southern
hemisphere. Buenos Ayres, with a population of over a million, reflects its large temperate
hinterland.

[Sidenote: The effects of Arctic cold.]

Frigid zones and the Tropics alike suffer from monotony, of Arctic the one of cold and the
other of heat. The Arctic climatic belt, extending from the isotherm of 0°C. (32°F.) to the
pole, includes inhabited districts where the mean annual temperature is less than -15°C. (or
5°F.), as at the Greenland village of Etah on Smith's Sound and the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk.
Here the ground is covered with, ice or snow most of the year, and permanently frozen below
the surface. Animal and plant life are reduced to a minimum on the land, so that man, with
every poleward advance of his thin-strung settlements, is forced more and more to rely on the
sea for his food. Hence he places his villages on narrow strips of coast, as do the Norse of
Finmarken, the Eskimo and the Tunguse inhabiting the Arctic rim of Asia. Products of marine
animals make the basis of his domestic economy. Farther inland, which means farther south,
all tribes live by hunting and fishing. The Eurasian Hyperboreans find additional subsistence
in their reindeer herds, which they pasture on the starchy lichen (Cladonia rangiferina) of
the tundra. [See maps pages 103, 153.]

[Sidenote: Similarity of cultural development.]

Though these Arctic folk are sprung from diverse race stocks, close vicinal location around
an enclosed sea has produced some degree of blood relationship. But whatever their origins,
the harsh conditions of their life have imposed upon them all a similar civilization. All population
is sparse and more or less nomadic, since agriculture alone roots settlement. They have the
same food, the same clothing, the same types of summer and winter dwellings, whether it is
the earth hut of the Eskimo or of the coast Lapp, the Siberian Yukagirs of the Kolima River,
or the Samoyedes of northeastern Russia.[1433] The spur of necessity has aroused their ingenuity
to a degree found nowhere in the drowsy Tropics of Africa. Dread of cold led the Yakuts of
the Lena Valley to glaze the windows of their huts with slabs of ice, which are better nonconductors
of heat and cold, and can be made more perfectly air-tight than glass. Hence these windows
have been adopted by Russian colonists. The Eskimo devised the oil lamp, an invention found
nowhere else in primitive America, and fishing tackle so perfect that white men coming to fish
in Arctic waters found it superior to their own.

Owing to the inexorable restriction of their natural resources, contact with European commerce
has impoverished the Hyperborean natives. It has caused the rapid and ruthless exploitation
of their meager resources, which means eventual starvation. So long as the Ostyaks, before
the coming of the Russians, were sole masters of the vast forests of the Obi Valley, they commanded
a supply of fish and fur animals which sufficed for their sparse population. But the greed
of the Russian fish dealers and fur traders, and the devastating work of the lumbermen have
made double war upon Ostyak sources of subsistence.[1434] The appearance of the white man in
Alaskan waters was the signal for the indiscriminate killing of seal and other marine animals,
till the Eskimo's supply of food and furs has been seriously invaded, from Greenland to the
outermost Aleutian Islands. In all this wide territory, climatic conditions forbid any substitute
for the original products, except the domesticated reindeer on the tundra of the mainland;
but this would necessitate the transformation of the Eskimo from a hunting to a pastoral people.
This task the government at Washington has undertaken, but with scant success.

[Sidenote: Cold and health]

In contrast to the numerous indirect effects of a frigid climate, no direct physiological effect
can be positively ascribed to intense cold. It lays no bodily handicap on health and energy,
as does the excessive heat of the Tropics. The coldest regions where tillage is possible are
tolerable places of residence, because their winters are intensely dry. That of central Siberia,
which is drier than the driest desert, makes tent life comfortable in the coldest season, provided
the tenter be clad in furs. The low temperatures of the Canadian Northwest for the same reason
have not repelled settlers even from the Southern States. Negroes, however, meet a climatic
barrier in America at the isotherm of 5° Centigrade (41° F.). They are found in New England
and Nova Scotia, generally with a large admixture of white blood; but there and farther north
where the climate is moist as well as cold, they show a fatal tendency to pulmonary diseases.

[Sidenote: The small amount of tropical emigration]

The acclimatization of tropical people in temperate regions will never be a question of widespread
importance. The negroes were involuntary immigrants to America, under conditions that can never
recur. Their concentration in the "black belt," where they find the heat and moisture in which
they thrive, and their climatically conditioned exclusion from the more northern states are
matters of local significance. Economic and social retardation have kept the hot belt relatively
underpopulated. The density map shows much the largest part of it with a population less than
25 to the square mile. Only the small portion contained in India, southernmost China, and Java
shows a density over 125 to the square mile (or 50 to the square kilometer). This density has
to rise to 500 or more to the square mile before emigration begins. The would-be exiles then
have a wide choice of new homes in other tropical lands, where they find congenial climate
and phases of economic development into which they will fit. East Indian coolies are found
in Cape Colony, Natal, Zanzibar, Trinidad, and British Guiana, where they constitute 38 per
cent. of the population.

[Sidenote: Effects of tropical climate.]

The redundant population of crowded western and southern Europe also seek these sparsely inhabited
Tropics, but they come heavily handicapped by the necessity of acclimatization. They leave
their homes from Trondhjem and Stockholm in the north to the Mediterranean in the south, where
the mean annual temperatures vary from 5° to 17° C, (41° to 63° F.), to seek the Torrid Zone
which averages 25° C. or 77° F. over most of its territory. The effects of a tropical climate
are due to intense heat, to its long duration without the respite conferred by a bracing winter
season, and its combination with the high degree of humidity prevailing over most of the Torrid
Zone. These are conditions advantageous to plant life, but hardly favorable to human development.
They produce certain derangements in the physiological functions of heart, liver, kidneys and
organs of reproduction. Bodily temperature rises, while susceptibility to disease and rate
of mortality show an increase ominous for white colonization. The general effect is intense
enervation; this starts a craving for stimulants and induces habits of alcoholism which are
accountable for many bodily ills usually attributed to direct climatic influences. Transfer
to the Tropics tends to relax the mental and moral fiber, induces indolence, self-indulgences
and various excesses which lower the physical tone.[1435] The social control of public opinion
in the new environment is weak, while temptation, due to both climatic and social causes, is
peculiarly strong. The presence of an inferior, more or less servile native population, relaxes
both conscience and physical energy just when both need a tonic. The result is general enervation,
deterioration both as economic and political agents.

[Sidenote: Historical significance of deterioration]

This is the effect of climate which has had the most far-reaching and persistent historical
consequences. Our study of the historical movements of peoples in the northern hemisphere revealed
a steady influx from colder into tropical and sub-tropical lands, followed always by enervation
and loss of national efficiency, due partly to the debilitating heat of the new habitat, partly
to its easier conditions of living, whether the intruders came as conquerors and appropriated
the fat of the land, or as immigrant colonists who dropped into slack methods of agriculture,
because rain and sun and soil made their reluctant labor scarcely necessary. Everywhere in
the Tropics the enervating effects of heat, moisture, and abundance make not only the natives
averse to steady work, but start the energetic European immigrant down the same easy descent
to Avernus. Passing over the deterioration of the Aryans in India, the Persians in Mesopotamia,
and the Vandals in Africa, we find that modern instances show the transformation to be very
rapid. The French who since 1715 have occupied the islands of Réunion and Mauritius have lost
much of their thrift and energy, though their new homes lie just within the southern tropic,
and are blessed with an oceanic climate. Yet the volunteer troops sent by Réunion to aid in
the recent subjugation of the Hovas in Madagascar proved to be utterly useless.[1436] The Spaniards
who come to-day to Mexico have great energy, born of their former hard conditions of life in
Spain. But their children are reared in a country whose mean annual temperature, even on the
plateau, exceeds that of Spain by 10°C. (or 18°F.), a difference equal to that between Mobile
and New York, or Madrid and Christiania. Hence they are less energetic and vigorous, while
the third generation are typical Mexicans in their easy-going way of life.[1437] The Germans
who recently have colonized southern Brazil in great numbers show a similar deterioration under
similar increase of mean annual temperature, combined with somewhat greater humidity, which
intensifies the debilitating effects of the heat. An investigation made in 1900 by the International
Harvester Company of America revealed the fact that the German farmer in the State of Santa
Catharina rarely cultivated over one acre of grain.[1438] Much of the iron in the blood and
conscience of the New England missionary stock which went to Hawaii two generations ago has
been dissolved out by the warm rain and balmy air of the islands.

[Sidenote: The problem of acclimatization.]

In all these instances the white race has been successfully transplanted. It has domiciled
itself on the borders of the Tropics and has propagated its kind, though it has abated some
of the vigorous qualities which characterized it in its temperate fatherland. In the real Tropics
like India, Cochin China, the Malay Archipelago, and Central Africa, the whole perplexing and
urgent problem of European colonization turns on the difficulty or impossibility of acclimatization;
and this in turn affects the whole economic, ethnic and political destiny of present colonial
holdings. If acclimatization is impossible, the alternative is an imported ruling class, constantly
invalided and as constantly renewed, aided by a similar commercial body acting as superintendents
of labor; the whole machine of government and economic exploitation is supported by a permanent
servile native population, doing the preeminently tropical work of agriculture, which is so
fatal to the white man in a torrid climate. This means that the conquering white race of the
Temperate Zone is to be excluded by adverse climatic conditions from the productive but undeveloped
Tropics, unless it consents to hybridization, like the Spaniards and Portuguese of tropical
America. In that national struggle for existence which is a struggle for space, it means an
added advantage for the Mediterranean peoples, that they are more tolerant of a torrid climate
than the blond Teutons, whose disability in this regard is pronounced; it means that the aptitude
of the Chinese for a wide range of climatic accommodation, from the Arctic circle to the equator,
lends color to "the yellow peril."

[Sidenote: Historical importance of the temperate zones.]

In contrast to the monotonous extremes of climate in the hot and cold zones, temperate lands
are characterized by the intermediate degrees of annual temperature and marked seasonal diversity
which are so favorable to human development. In Arctic lands labor is paralyzed by cold as
it is by heat in the enervating and overproductive Tropics. In one, the growing season is too
short and ill-favored; in the other, too long to stimulate man to sustained industry. Hence
the Temperate Zones, whose climate avoids both these extremes and abounds in contrasts, whose
summers are productive enough to supply food for the winter, and whose winters give both motive
and energy for the summer's work, are richer in cultural possibilities and hence in historical
importance.

[Sidenote: Effects of contrasted seasons.]

The advantage of the Temperate Zone is not only its moderate and adequate allowance of heat,
but its contrast of seasons. Beyond the range of a vertical sun, grades of temperature change
rapidly from latitude to latitude and from summer to winter. The seasons bring variety of activities,
which sharply react upon one another. Manufactures were in their origin chiefly winter industries,
as they still are in small isolated communities. The modern factory system flourishes best
in cooler parts of the Temperate Zone, where the agricultural demands of the summer, spreading
over a shorter period, leave a longer time for winter work, and where that once long winter
of the Glacial Period, by the scouring action of the ice cap, has reduced the fertile area
of the northern fields. The factory system is also favored, as Heinrich von Treitschke maintains,
by the predominance of cool or cold weather, which facilitates the concentration of numerous
workmen in large buildings, and renders possible long labor hours the year round,[1439]--conditions
unthinkable in a warm climate. The iron and steel industries which have grown up about Birmingham,
Alabama, find that the long hot summers and mild winters reduce the efficiency of their skilled
labor imported from the North.

[Sidenote: Effects of length of seasons.]

[Sidenote: Effect of long winters.]

The length of the seasons is of conspicuous importance. It determines, for instance, whether
a given climate permits continuous field work with summer and winter crops, whether field work
is possible at all, and how long it is interrupted by excessive cold. Buckle maintains that
climate not only enervates or invigorates man, but affects also the constancy of his work and
his capacity for sustained labor throughout the year. He considers "that no people living in
a very northern latitude have ever possessed that steady and unflinching industry for which
the inhabitants of temperate regions are remarkable" and assigns as a reason "that the severity
of the weather, and, at some seasons, the deficiency of light, render it impossible for the
people to continue their usual out-of-door employments." The result of this he finds to be
desultory habits of work, which help to make the national character fitful and capricious.
He cites in illustration of his principle the people of the Scandinavian and Iberian peninsulas,
whom he finds marked "by a certain instability and fickleness of character," owing to the fact
that in Norway and Sweden agricultural labor experiences long interruptions, due to the severity
of the winter and the shortness of the days; in Spain and Portugal owing to the heat and drought
of summer.[1440] The extreme continental climate of northern of Russia with its violent contrast
of the seasons, its severe and protracted winters, enables Leroy-Beaulieu to make a safer application
of this principle to the empire of the Czars, which, unlike Scandinavia, feels no ameliorating
effect from the mild Atlantic winds and commands no alternative industries like dairy farming,
fisheries, and maritime trade.[1441] Hence Leroy-Beaulieu attributes the unsystematic, desultory
habits of work prevailing among the northern peasants to the long intermission of labor in
winter, and to the alternation of a short period of intense activity with a long period of
enforced idleness. He finds them resembling southern peoples in their capacity for sudden spurts
of energy rather than sustained effort, thinks them benumbed by the sloth of the far north,
which is not unlike the sloth of the south.[1442]

The dominant continental and central location of Russia enables its climatic extremes to operate
with little check. The peripheral location of Scandinavia in the path of the Atlantic winds
modifies its climate to a mild oceanic type, and its dominant maritime situation gives its
people the manifold resources of a typical coast land. Hence Buckle's estimate of national
character in the Scandinavian Peninsula has little basis as to fact or cause. Irregularity
of agricultural labor does not mean here cessation of all labor, and hence does not produce
the far-reaching effect ascribed to it. Only about one-third of the Norwegian population is
engaged in agriculture. The restriction of its arable and meadow land to 3 per cent. of the
whole territory, and the fact that a large proportion of the people are employed in shipping
and the fisheries,[1443] are due to several geographic factors besides climate. The same thing
is true of Sweden in a modified degree.

[Sidenote: Complexity of climatic effects.]

Caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions from climate alone or from only one phase
of its influence. The duration and intensity of the seasons affects not only the manner of
work, but the whole mode of life of a people. On the Yukon, in Iceland, and the high mountain
valleys of the Alps, winter puts a check not only upon out-of-door labor, but upon all public
or community life. Intercourse stops or is greatly restricted. The outside world drops away.
In Iceland, the law courts are in session only in summer when the roads by sea and land are
open. In the Kentucky mountains the district schools close before Christmas, when the roads
become impassable from rain and snow; the summer is the gala time for funeral services, for
only then can the preacher or "circuit-rider" reach the graves made in the winter. Therefore
the funerals in one community accumulate, so to speak, and finally, when leisure comes after
the August harvest, they make the occasion for important social gatherings. Much of the influence
of winter lies in its power to isolate.

It is the economic effects of such periods of enforced idleness which are most obvious, both
in their power to restrict national wealth and keep down density of population. When long,
they limit subsistence to the products of a short growing season, except where local mining
adds considerable sources of revenue. In the Russian government of Yaroslaf, located on the
northernmost bend of the Volga within the agricultural belt, and containing the chief inland
wheat market of the Empire, the field labor of four months must support the population for
the remaining eight months of the year. The half of Russia included in the cold forest zone
of the north maintains meagerly a sparse population, and can hope for an increase of the same
only by the encouragement of Industrial pursuits. Here the long winter leisure has created
the handicrafts on which so many villages rely, and which in turn have given rise to peddling,[1444]
as we have seen it do in high mountain regions where altitude intensifies and prolongs the
winter season. Agricultural and industrial life are still undivorced, just as in primitive
communities. The resulting population has also the primitive mark of great sparsity, so that
modern industry, which depends upon a concentrated labor force, is here inhibited. Hence Russian
manufactures, which are so active in the governments of Vladimir, Moscow, and St. Petersburg,
cease beyond the sixtieth parallel, which defines the northern limit of the agricultural belt
and the beginning of the forest and the fur zone.[1445] [See maps pages 8 and 612.]

[Sidenote: Social effects of long winters.]

The rigorous climate of Russia was undoubtedly one cause for the attachment of the peasants
to the soil in 1593. This measure was resorted to at a time when the Muscovite dominion from
its center in Great Russia had recently been extended at the expense of the Tartars, and had
thus embraced fertile southern lands, which tempted the northern peasant away from his unfruitful
fields.[1446] This attraction, coupled with the free and hopeful life of the frontier, met
the migrant instinct bred in the peasant by the wide plains and far horizon of Russia, so that
the north threatened to be left without cultivators. Later, the harsh climatic conditions of
the north were advanced as an argument against the abolition of serfdom, on the ground that
this system alone secured to the landed proprietor a steady labor supply, and guaranteed to
the peasant his maintenance during the long, idle winter.

The duration and severity of the cold season has put a drag upon the wheel of enterprise in
Canada, as opposed to the warmer United States. The prairies of the Canadian Northwest, whose
fertile soil should early have attracted settlement, were a closed land till railroads could
pour into it every summer from the warmer south and east a seasonal tide of laborers. These
follow the harvest as it advances from point to point, and then withdraw in autumn either to
the lumber camps of eastern Canada, Minnesota and Wisconsin, or to seek other forms of out-door
labor in the more southern states, thus lifting from the Canadian farmer the burden of their
winter support.

In the lower latitudes of the Temperate Zones, where the growing season is long and the dormant
period correspondingly short and mild, we find agriculture based upon clearly distinguished
winter and summer crops, as in the northern Punjab (30° to 34° N. L.);[1447] or producing a
quick succession of valuable crops, where the fertility of the soil can be maintained by manures
or irrigating streams, as in many of the warmer Southern States and in Spain[1448] respectively.
In Argentine, where tillage is extensive, land abundant, and population sparse, where, in fact,
"skimp farming" is the rule, the shrewd cultivator takes advantage of the long growing season
to stretch out his period of sowing and reaping, and thus tills a larger area. The International
Harvester Company of America, investigating the reason for the small number of reaping machines
employed in Argentine in proportion to the area under cultivation, found that the simple climatic
condition of a long growing season enabled one reaper to serve about twice the acreage usual
in the United States, because it could work twice as long.[1449]

[Sidenote: Zones of culture.]

Over and beyond slight local variations of climate and season within the same zone, which contribute
their quota to economic and historical results, it is the fundamental differences between the
hot, cold and temperate climatic zones that produce the most conspicuous and abiding effects.
These broad belts, each with its characteristic climatic conditions and appropriate civilization,
form so many girdles of culture around the earth. They have their dominant features of heat
and cold, variously combined with moisture and aridity, which give a certain zonal stamp to
human temperature and development.

The two cold belts have little claim to the name of cultural zones, since their inability to
support more than an insignificant population has made them almost a negligible factor in history.
[Compare maps pages 8, 9, and 612.] The discoveries and settlements of the Northmen in Greenland
remained a barren historical event, though the vikings' ships reached a new hemisphere. Iceland
is the only land in this sub-arctic region which ever figured upon the stage of history; and
its rôle was essentially passive. Such prominence as it acquired was due to its island nature
and its situation in a swirl of the Gulf Stream, which ameliorates the worst climatic effects
of its far northern location, and brings it just within the upper limit of the temperate belt.
The wide sub-arctic lowlands of Russia and Siberia, which, from the Ural Mountains to the lower
Amur River, stretch the cold zone well below the sixtieth parallel, have at times in the last
three centuries and especially in the past decade thrown their great mass into the scale of
eastern Asiatic history. This has been possible because the hot summer characteristic of continental
climates forces the July isotherm of 20°C. northward over the vast heated surface of Asia nearly
to the sixtieth parallel, well within the borders of Siberia. It gives that belt the short
but warm growing season with protracted hours of sunshine which is so favorable to cereals,
lending to Omsk, Tomsk, Vitimsk and all the stretch of Russian settlements in Siberia, an admirable
summer climate like that of the Canadian Northwest.[1450]

[Sidenote: The cradle of civilization.]

The North Temperate Zone is preëminently the culture zone of the earth. It is the seat of the
most important, most steadily progressive civilizations, and the source of all the cultural
stimuli which have given an upward start to civilization in other zones during the past three
centuries. It contains the Mediterranean basin, which was the pulsing heart of ancient history,
and all the modern historically important regions of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. The
temperate belt of the southern hemisphere also is following its lead, since European civilization
has been transplanted to other parts of the world. This is the zone which least suffers from
the drawbacks of climatic monotony or extremes, and best combines, especially in the northern
hemisphere, the wide range of annual and seasonal variety so favorable to economic and cultural
development, with the incalculable advantage of large land area.
