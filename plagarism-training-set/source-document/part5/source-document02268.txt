THE LAST WOMAN.

(A contemporary Pendant to "The Last Man.")

     [It is stated that the dreaded Crinoline has actually made its
     appearance in one or two quarters.]

  All modish shapes must melt in gloom,
    Great WORTH himself must die,
  Before the Sex again assume
    EVE'S sweet simplicity!
  I saw a vision in my sleep,
  Which made me bow my head and weep
    As one aghast, accurst!
  Was it a spook before me past?
  Of women I beheld the last,
    As ADAM saw the first.

  Regent Street seemed "No Thoroughfare,"
    Bond Street looked weird, inhuman;
  The spectres of past fashions were
    Around that lonely Woman.
  Some were the work of native hands,
  Some had arrived from foreign lands,
    Nondescript jumbles some!
  Pall-Mall had now nor sound nor tread,
  Park Lane was silent as the dead,
    Belgravia was dumb.

  Yet, lighthouse-like, that lone one stood,
    Or whisked her skirts around,
  Like a wild wind that sweeps the wood,
    And strews with leaves the ground.
  Singing, "Our hour is come, O Sun
  Of Fashion! We'll have no more fun.
    Solitude is too slow!
  True thou hast worn ten thousand shapes
  (In spite of man's sour gibes and japes),
    But--now the thing lacks go.

  "What though the grumbler Man put forth
    His pompous power and skill!
  He could not make Woman and WORTH
    The vassals of his will;--
  Fashion, I mourn thy parted sway,
  Thou dim discrownéd Queen! To play
    To empty box and stall;
  To dress--when not another She
  Exists to quicken rivalry--
    No, it won't pay at all!

  "Go, let oblivion's curtain fall
    Upon the works of men!
  Nothing they did that's worth recall,
    With sword, or spade, or pen.
  Their bumptious bunglings bring not back!
  Man always was a noisy quack
    Who thought himself a god;
  But when he fancied he had scored
  Prodigiously, the Sex he bored
    Subdued him with a nod.

  "Now I am weary. No one tries
    The fit of new attire!
  Doom, that the joys of Dress denies,
    Bids Woman's bliss expire.
  But shall La Mode know final death?
  Forbid it Woman's latest breath!
    Death--who is male--shan't boast
  The eclipse of Fashion. Such a pall
  Shall not like Darkness cover all--
    Till I give up the ghost!

  "What would most vex and worry him,
    Dull, modeless Man, whose spark
  Long (beside Woman's) burning dim,
    Has now gone down in dark?
  Ha! He'd kick up the greatest shine
  (If he could kick) at--CRINOLINE.
    Were he recalled to breath,
  I'll have one last man-mocking spree
  By donning hooped skirts. Victory!
    This takes all sting from Death!

  "Go, Sun, while Fashion holds me up,
    Swollen skirt and skimpy waist
  Shall fill--male--sorrow's bitter cup,
    And mortify--male--taste!
  Go, tell the spheres that sweep through space,
  Thou saw'st the last of EVE'S fair race,
    In high ecstatic passion;
  The darkening universe defy,
  To quench her taste for Toggery,
    Or shake her faith in Fashion!"

A PLAINT FROM PARNASSUS.

(By an "Unrecommended" Resident.)

     [Mr. GLADSTONE (replying to Mr. JOHNSTON, of Ballykilbeg) announced
     that no recommendation had been submitted to Her MAJESTY upon the
     subject of the succession to the office of Poet Laureate, and that
     there was no immediate intention of submitting one.]
