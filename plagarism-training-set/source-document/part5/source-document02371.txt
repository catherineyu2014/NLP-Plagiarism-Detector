PART V

CRAMPS, HOW TO SAVE LIFE, RESUSCITATION, ETC.

CRAMPS

To be suddenly seized with cramps is a thing liable to happen to most expert swimmers; it is
caused by various reasons--staying too long in the water and getting chilled, going in after
a heavy meal, stiffening the legs too much, and varicose veins. Preventive: Never remain in
the water after feeling chilled; always swim around and exercise yourself; twenty minutes is
long enough for any one to remain in the water; always turn over on the back when getting a
cramp, and float, at the same time working toward the shore with the hands, and don't lose
your presence of mind.

Don't attempt to rescue a person from drowning unless you are a good swimmer yourself; remember
that a drowning person is generally insane for the time, and is liable to drag you to your
death unless you are capable of swimming with a heavy load.

HOW TO SAVE LIFE

To the person who accidentally falls overboard, or who is compelled to leap into deep water,
as was the case with many victims of the General Slocum, the first essential is to keep one's
presence of mind. Do not feel alarmed if your head should sink below the surface once or twice--you
are bound to come to the surface, and will be able to sustain yourself for a considerable time,
even if you are not a swimmer, if you will but keep your hands under water. The reason so many
people drown is because directly they come to the surface they raise their hands above their
head and shout for help. This is fatal. The moment the hands are raised out of the water the
body will sink below the surface.

Another thing to remember is to keep the mouth closed until the body attains the floating position;
then try and breathe naturally through the mouth and help propel yourself with your hands.
Should you be able to swim, try and take off your outer clothing, as the latter, when water-soaked,
tends to drag the body down, besides retarding the movements of the drowning person.

To risk one's life in order to save a fellow being from drowning is one of the most heroic
acts that one may be called upon to perform, yet how many of us have the presence of mind and
courage to act in such an emergency? To rescue a person from drowning is no child's play, even
for the best swimmers; it requires pluck, nerve and stamina. Of course, I allude to rescues
which take place some distance from shore. Many a daring swimmer has been clutched and dragged
down to death simply because he did not know the safest way to approach a drowning person.

Of the many different ways of saving life, the safest and best method is to swim as near the
person as possible, then dive under and come up behind him; otherwise he is liable to grab
you around the neck with a death clutch, from which it is extremely difficult to escape. When
swimming up behind the person, grab his biceps and force him on his back; the more he struggles
the more he helps himself to keep afloat.

To prevent being clutched by a drowning person the following rules should be carefully studied.
Every action, however, must be prompt and decisive, otherwise this method will be of no avail.

1. If grasped by the wrists, turn both arms simultaneously against the drowning person, thumbs
outward, and attempt to bring your right arms at right angles to your own body. This will dislocate
the thumbs of the drowning person and he must let go his hold.

2. If clutched around the neck, immediately take a deep breath, lean well over your opponent,
place the left hand in the small part of his back and draw your right arm in an upward direction
until in line with his shoulder, and pass it at once over his arm. Then with the thumb and
forefinger catch his nose and pinch the nostrils close, at the same time place the palm of
your hand on his chin and push firmly outward. This will cause him to open his mouth for breathing
purposes, and he, being under you, will swallow water. Choking ensues, and not only is the
rescuer let go, but the other is left so helpless as to be completely under control.

3. If clutched around the body and arms, take a deep breath, lean well over your opponent and
throw the right arm in an upward direction at right angles to the body, or draw it up between
your body and that of your opponent. The sudden motion will press the air out of the other's
lungs, as well as push him off, no matter how tightly he may be holding.

Should the drowning person act sensibly and not try to grab his rescuer, he can be brought
in by placing his hands on his rescuer's shoulders and kicking out his legs behind him while
the rescuer swims in toward shore. Another method is to pull the person on his back by holding
him under the right arm-pit with your right hand and using the left hand and legs to swim with.
Should the rescue be close to shore, swim behind the person and help by pushing him in toward
shallow water. Should the drowning person have sunk for the third time watch when the air-bubbles
rise to the surface. At once dive down perpendicular to the bottom when the air-bubbles show,
seize the drowning person and bring him to the surface by pushing off from the bottom and using
your legs to send you upward to the surface. Before trying to rescue any one get rid of as
much clothing as possible, if time will permit.

RESUSCITATION AFTER RESCUE

After bringing a drowning person ashore your work is only half done; the main thing is to bring
him back to life should he be unconscious. There are several methods for resuscitating the
apparently drowned. The method adopted by the Royal Humane Society of England is, to my knowledge,
the simplest of all. It is as follows:

Begin treatment in the open air as soon as you have brought the unfortunate ashore. Meanwhile
send for medical assistance, blankets and dry clothing. Expose the patient's throat and chest
to the wind, except in very severe weather. Remove all tight clothing from neck and chest.
Take off suspenders.

The result is respiration, or natural breathing, and, if not too late, life.

SYLVESTER'S METHOD

Rule 1. Remove all tight clothing from about the neck and chest.

Rule 2. To Maintain a Free Entrance of Air Into the Windpipe.--Cleanse the mouth and nostrils;
open the mouth; draw forward the patient's tongue, and keep it forward; an elastic band over
the tongue and under the chin will answer this purpose. (Fig. 1.)

Rule 3. To Imitate the Movements of Breathing.--First, Induce inspiration. Place yourself at
the head of the patient, grasp his arms (at the elbow-joints), raise them upward by the sides
of his head, stretch them steadily but gently upward, for two seconds. By this means fresh
air is drawn into the lungs by raising the ribs. (Fig. 2.)

Secondly, Induce Expiration.--Immediately turn down the patient's arms, and press the elbows
firmly but gently downward against the sides of the chest, for two seconds. By this means foul
air is expelled from the lungs by depressing the ribs. By these means an exchange of air is
produced in the lungs similar to that effected by natural respiration.

Rule 4. To Excite Respiration.--During the employment of the above method, excite the nostrils
with snuff or smelling-salts, or tickle the throat with a feather. Rub the chest and face briskly,
and dash cold and hot water alternately on them. Friction of the limbs and body with dry flannel
or cloths should be had recourse to. When there is proof of returning respiration, the individual
may be placed in a warm bath, the movements of the arms above described being continued until
respiration is fully restored. Raise the body in twenty seconds to a sitting position, dash
cold water against the chest and face, and pass ammonia under the nose. Should a galvanic apparatus
be at hand, apply the sponges to the region of the diaphragm and the heart.

To Induce Circulation and Warmth.--Wrap the patient in dry blankets, and rub the limbs upward
energetically.

On the restoration of life, when the power of swallowing has returned, a teaspoonful of warm
water, small quantities of wine, warm brandy and water, or coffee should be given. The patient
should be kept in bed, and a disposition to sleep encouraged. During reaction, large mustard-plasters
to the chest and below the shoulders will greatly relieve the distrest breathing.

NOTE.--In all cases of prolonged immersion in cold water, when the breathing continues, a warm
bath should be employed to restore the temperature.
