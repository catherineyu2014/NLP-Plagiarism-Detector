PREFACE

It is the purpose of this volume to trace the influence of our constitutional system upon the
political conditions which exist in this country to-day. This phase of our political problems
has not received adequate recognition at the hands of writers on American politics. Very often
indeed it has been entirely ignored, although in the short period which has elapsed since our
Constitution was framed and adopted, the Western world has passed through a political as well
as an industrial revolution.

In the eighteenth century the majority was outside of the pale of political rights. Government
as a matter of course was the expression of the will of a minority. Even in the United States,
where hereditary rule was overthrown by the Revolution, an effective and recognized minority
control still survived through the property qualifications for the suffrage and for office-holding,
which excluded a large proportion of the people from participation in political affairs. Under
such conditions there could be but little of what is now known as democracy. Moreover, slavery
continued to exist upon a large scale for nearly three-quarters of a century after the Constitution
was adopted, and was finally abolished only within the memory of many now living.

It could hardly be expected that a political system set up for a community containing a large
slave population and in which the suffrage was restricted, even among the free whites, should
in any large measure embody the aims and ideas of present day democracy. In fact the American
Constitution did not recognize the now more or less generally accepted principle of majority
rule even as applying to the qualified voters. Moreover, it was not until several decades after
the Constitution was adopted that the removal of property qualifications for voting allowed
the people generally to have a voice in political affairs.

The extension of the suffrage was a concession to the growing belief in democracy, but it failed
to give the masses an effective control over the general government, owing to the checks in
the Constitution on majority rule. It had one important consequence, however, which should
not be overlooked. Possession of the suffrage by the people generally led the undiscriminating
to think that it made the opinion of the majority a controlling factor in national politics.

Our political writers have for the most part passed lightly over the undemocratic features
of the Constitution and left the uncritical reader with the impression that universal suffrage
under our system of government ensures the rule of the majority. It is this conservative approval
of the Constitution under the guise of sympathy with majority rule, which has perhaps more
than any thing else misled the people as to the real spirit and purpose of that instrument.
It was by constantly representing it as the indispensable means of attaining the ends of democracy,
that it came to be so generally regarded as the source of all that is democratic in our system
of government. It is to call attention to the spirit of the Constitution, its inherent opposition
to democracy, the obstacles which it has placed in the way of majority rule, that this volume
has been written.

The general recognition of the true character of the Constitution is necessary before we can
fully understand the nature and origin of our political evils. It would also do much to strengthen
and advance the cause of popular government by bringing us to a realization of the fact that
the so-called evils of democracy are very largely the natural results of those constitutional
checks on popular rule which we have inherited from the political system of the eighteenth century.

THE SPIRIT OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT

CHAPTER I

THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY

Constitutional government is not necessarily democratic. Usually it is a compromise in which
monarchical and aristocratic features are retained. The proportion in which the old and the
new are blended depends, of course, upon the progress the democratic movement has made. Every
step toward democracy has been stubbornly opposed by the few, who have yielded to the popular
demand, from time to time, only what necessity required. The constitution of the present day
is the outcome of this long-continued and incessant struggle. It reflects in its form and character
the existing distribution of political power within the state.

If we go back far enough we find government nearly everywhere in the hands of a King and privileged
class. In its earlier stages the constitutional struggle was between monarchy and aristocracy,
the King seeking to make his authority supreme and the nobility seeking to limit and circumscribe
it. Accordingly, government oscillated between monarchy and aristocracy, a strong and ambitious
King getting the reins of government largely in his own hands, while the aristocracy encroached
upon the power and prerogatives of a weak and incompetent one. Thus democracy played no part
in the earlier constitutional struggles. The all-important question was whether the King or
the nobility should control the state. Civil wars were waged to decide it, and government gravitated
toward monarchy or aristocracy according as the monarchical or aristocratic party prevailed.

Under William the Conqueror and his immediate successors the government of England was practically
an absolute monarchy. Only the highest class was consulted in the Great Council and the advice
of these the King was not obliged to follow. Later, as a result of the memorable controversy
between King John and his feudal barons, the Great Council regained the power which it had
lost. Against the King were arrayed the nobility, the church as represented by its official
hierarchy, and the freemen of the realm, all together constituting but a small minority of
the English people. The Great Charter extorted from the King on this occasion, though frequently
referred to as the foundation of English liberty, was in reality a matter of but little immediate
importance to the common people. The benefit of its provisions, while not limited to the nobility,
extended, however, only to those classes without whose aid and support the tyrannical power
of the King could not be successfully opposed. The church, by reason of the great wealth which
it controlled and the powerful influence which it exerted in a superstitious age over the minds
of the people, was a factor that could not be ignored. The freemen also played an important
part in the constitutional struggles, since they carried the sword and formed the rank and
file of the fighting class. The important provisions of the Great Charter relate exclusively
to the rights of the church, the nobility and the freemen. The serfs, while not included within
the benefit of its provisions, were an overwhelming majority of the English people. This conclusion
is irresistible in view of the fact that the Domesday Survey shows that about four-fifths of
the adult male population in the year 1085 were below the rank of freemen.[1]

The Great Charter was, it is true, an important step in the direction of constitutional government,
but it contained no element of democracy. It merely converted the government from one in which
monarchy was the predominant feature, to one in which the aristocratic element was equally
important. The classes represented in the Great Council became a constitutional check on the
power of the King, inasmuch as he could not levy taxes without their consent. The important
constitutional position which this charter assigned to the nobility was not maintained, however,
without repeated struggles under succeeding Kings; but it laid the foundation for the subsequent
development which limited and finally abolished the power of the monarch.

In the course of time the Great Council split up into two separate bodies, the House of Lords,
composed of the greater nobility and the higher dignitaries of the church, and the House of
Commons, representing all other classes who enjoyed political rights. When the House of Commons
thus assumed a definite and permanent form as a separate body, a new check upon the power of
the King appeared. The consent of two separate bodies was now necessary before taxes could
be imposed. The development of these checks was hastened by the fact that the King found it
easier and safer to get the assent of these bodies to measures which involved an exercise of
the taxing power, than to attempt the collection of taxes without their support. In this way
the right of assenting to all measures of taxation came in time to be recognized as belonging
to the two houses of Parliament. But this was a right not easily established. It was claimed
and fought for a long time before it finally became a firmly established principle of the English
Constitution. Around the question of taxation centered all the earlier constitutional struggles.
The power to tax was the one royal prerogative which was first limited. In time Parliament
extended its powers and succeeded in making its assent necessary to all governmental acts which
vitally affected the welfare of the nation, whether they involved an exercise of the taxing
power or not. The law-making power, however, as we understand it now was seldom employed, the
idea of social readjustment through general legislation being a recent growth. But as revenues
were necessary, the taxing power was the one legislative function that was constantly exercised.
It is not strange then that the earlier constitutional development should have turned mainly
upon the relation of the various political classes to the exercise of this power.

That English constitutional development resulted in a parliament composed of two houses may
be regarded as accidental. Instead of this double check upon the King there might conceivably
have been more than two, or there might, as originally was the case, have been only one. Two
distinct elements, the secular nobility and the dignitaries of the church, combined to form
the House of Lords. The House of Commons was also made up of two distinct constituencies, one
urban and the other rural. If each of these classes had deliberated apart and acquired the
right to assent to legislation as a separate body, a four-chambered parliament, such as existed
in Sweden up to 1866 and still survives in Finland, would have been the result.[2]

The essential fact, everywhere to be observed in the development of constitutional government,
is the rise to political power of classes which compete with the King and with each other for
the control of the state. The monopoly of political power enjoyed by the King was broken down
in England when the nobility compelled the signing of Magna Charta. This change in the English
Constitution involved the placing of a check upon the King in the interest of the aristocracy.
Later, with the development of the House of Commons as a separate institution, the power of
the King was still further limited, this time in the interest of what we may call the commercial
and industrial aristocracy.

At this stage of its development the English government contained a system of checks and balances.
The King still retained legislative power, but could not use it without the consent of both
Lords and Commons. Each branch of the government possessed the means of defending itself, since
it had what was in effect an absolute veto on legislation. This is a stage in political evolution
through which governments naturally pass. It is a form of political organization intermediate
between monarchy and democracy, and results from the effort to check and restrain, without
destroying, the power of the King. When this system of checks was fully developed the King,
Lords and Commons were three coordinate branches of the English government. As the concurrence
of all three was necessary to enact laws, each of these could defeat legislation desired by
the other two.

The development of this system of checks limited the irresponsible power of the King only on
its positive side. The negative power of absolute veto the King still retained. While he could
not enact laws without the consent of the other two coordinate branches of the government,
he still had the power to prevent legislation. The same was true of the Lords and Commons.
As each branch of government had the power to block reform, the system was one which made legislation
difficult.

The system of checks and balances must not be confused with democracy; it is opposed to and
can not be reconciled with the theory of popular government. While involving a denial of the
right of the King or of any class to a free hand in political matters, it at the same time
denies the right of the masses to direct the policy of the state This would be the case even
if one branch of the government had the broadest possible basis. If the House of Commons had
been a truly popular body in the eighteenth century, that fact would not of itself have made
the English government as a whole popular in form. While it would have constituted a popular
check on the King and the House of Lords, it would have been powerless to express the popular
will in legislation.

The House of Commons was not, however, a popular body in the eighteenth century. In theory,
of course, as a part of Parliament it represented the whole English people. But this was a
mere political fiction, since by reason of the narrowly limited suffrage, a large part of the
English people had no voice in parliamentary elections. Probably not one-fifth of the adult
male population was entitled to vote for members of Parliament. As the right to vote was an
incident of land ownership, the House of Commons was largely representative of the same interests
that controlled the House of Lords.

That the House of Commons was not democratic in spirit is clearly seen in the character of
parliamentary legislation. The laws enacted during this period were distinctly undemocratic.
While the interests of the land-holding aristocracy were carefully guarded, the well-being
of the laboring population received scant consideration. The poor laws, the enclosure acts
and the corn laws, which had in view the prosperity of the landlord, and the laws against combination,
which sought to advance the interests of the capitalist at the expense of the laborer, show
the spirit of the English government prior to the parliamentary reform of 1832. The landlord
and capitalist classes controlled the government and, as Professor Rogers observes, their aim
was to increase rents and profits by grinding the English workman down to the lowest pittance.
"I contend," he says, "that from 1563 to 1824, a conspiracy, concocted by the law and carried
out by parties interested in its success, was entered into, to cheat the English workman of
his wages, to tie him to the soil, to deprive him of hope, and to degrade him into irremediable
poverty."[3]

But it is not in statute law alone that this tendency is seen. English common law shows the
same bias in favor of the classes which then controlled the state. There is no mistaking the
influences which left their impress upon the development of English law at the hands of the
courts. The effect of wealth and political privilege is seen here as well as in statutory enactment.
Granting all that can justly be said in behalf of the wisdom and reasonableness of the common
law, the fact nevertheless remains, that its development by the courts has been influenced
by an evident disposition to favor the possessing as against the non-possessing classes. Both
the common and the statute law of England reflected in the eighteenth century the political
supremacy of the well-to-do minority.

CHAPTER II

THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD

The American colonists inherited the common law and the political institutions of the mother
country. The British form of government, with its King, Lords and Commons and its checks upon
the people, they accepted as a matter of course. In their political thinking they were not
consciously more democratic than their kinsmen across the Atlantic. Many of them, it is true,
had left England to escape what they regarded as tyranny and oppression. But to the form of
the English government as such they had no objection. The evils which they experienced were
attributed solely to the selfish spirit in which the government was administered.

The conditions, however, were more favorable for the development of a democratic spirit here
than in the mother country. The immigrants to America represented the more active, enterprising
and dissatisfied elements of the English people. Moreover, there was no hereditary aristocratic
class in the colonies and less inequality in the distribution of wealth. This approach to industrial
and social equality prepared the mind for the ideas of political equality which needed only
the stimulus of a favorable opportunity to ensure their speedy development.
