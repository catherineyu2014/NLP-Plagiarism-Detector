Heathen mythology and Scripture history), he ought to go and study the principles of his design

SHAKSPEARE

This selection is from the "Lectures on the English Poets." At the beginning of his lecture
on Shakespeare and Milton, Hazlitt maintains that the arts reach their perfection in the early
periods and are not continually progressive like the sciences--an idea which he frequently
comes back to in his writings, notably in the "Round Table" paper, "Why the Arts are not Progressive."

P. 34. the fault, etc. Cf. "Julius Cæsar," i, 2, 140.

Shakspeare as they would be. Hazlitt may have had in mind Dr. Johnson's comment in his preface
to Shakespeare's works: "the event which he represents will not happen, but if it were possible,
its effect would probably be such as he had assigned; he has not only shewn human nature as
it acts in real exigencies, but as it would be found in trials to which it cannot be exposed."
(Nichol Smith: "Eighteenth Century Essays on Shakespeare," p. 117.)

P. 35. its generic quality. Coleridge applied the epithet "myriad-minded" to Shakespeare. See
also Schlegel's "Lectures on the Drama." ed. Bohn, p. 363: "Never perhaps was there so comprehensive
a talent for characterization as Shakespeare. It not only grasps the diversity of rank, age,
and sex, down to the lispings of infancy; not only do the king and the beggar, the hero and
the pickpocket, the sage and the idiot, speak and act with equal truthfulness ... his human
characters have not only such depth and individuality that they do not admit of being classed
under common names, and are inexhaustible even in conception; no, this Prometheus not merely
forms men, he opens the gates of the magical world of spirits, calls up the midnight ghost,
exhibits before us the witches with their unhallowed rites, peoples the air with sportive fairies
and sylphs; and these beings, though existing only in the imagination, nevertheless possess
such truth and consistency, that even with such misshapen abortions as Caliban, he extorts
the assenting conviction, that were there such beings they would so conduct themselves. In
a word, as he carries a bold and pregnant fancy into the kingdom of nature, on the other hand,
he carries nature into the region of fancy, which lies beyond the confines of reality. We are
lost in astonishment at the close intimacy he brings us into with the extraordinary, the wonderful,
and the unheard-of."

a mind reflecting ages past. "These words occur in the first lines of a laudatory poem on Shakespeare
printed in the second folio (1632). The poem is signed 'J. M. S.' and was attributed by Coleridge
to 'John Milton, Student.' See his 'Lectures on Shakespeare' (ed. T. Ashe), pp. 129-130." Waller-Glover,

When he conceived of a character, etc. Cf. Maurice Morgann, "On the Character of Falstaff":
"But it was not enough for Shakespeare to have formed his characters with the most perfect
truth and coherence; it was further necessary that he should possess a wonderful facility of
compressing, as it were, his own spirit into these images, and of giving alternate animation
to the forms. This was not to be done from without; he must have felt every varied situation,
and have spoken thro' the organ he had formed. Such an intuitive comprehension of things and
such a facility must unite to produce a Shakespeare." (Nichol Smith: "Eighteenth Century Essays
on Shakespeare," p. 247, n.)

It has been ingeniously remarked, by Coleridge, "Seven Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton,"
p. 116: "The power of poetry is, by a single word perhaps, to instil that energy into the mind,
which compels the imagination to produce the picture.... Here, by introducing a single happy
epithet, 'crying,' a complete picture is presented to the mind, and in the production of such
pictures the power of genius consists."

his delights. "Antony and Cleopatra," v, 2, 88.

P. 49. His tragedies are better than his comedies. Hazlitt is here deliberately opposing the
view of Dr. Johnson expressed in the latter's preface to Shakespeare: "In tragedy he often
writes with great appearance of toil and study, what is written at last with little felicity;
but in his comick scenes, he seems to produce without labour, what no labour can improve. In
tragedy he is always struggling after some occasion to be comick, but in comedy he seems to
repose, or to luxuriate, as in a mode of thinking congenial to his nature. In his tragick scenes
there is always something wanting, but his comedy often surpasses expectation or desire." (Nichol
Smith's "Eighteenth Century Essays on Shakespeare," p. 121.) In the second lecture of the "English
Comic Writers," Hazlitt recurs to this opinion of Johnson's with the following comment: "For
my own part, I so far consider this preference given to the comic genius of the poet as erroneous
and unfounded, that I should say that he is the only tragic poet in the world in the highest
sense, as being on a par with, and the same as Nature, in her greatest heights and depths of
action and suffering. There is but one who durst walk within that mighty circle, treading the
utmost bound of nature and passion, showing us the dread abyss of woe in all its ghastly shapes
and colours, and laying open all the faculties of the human soul to act, to think, and suffer,
in direst extremities; whereas I think, on the other hand, that in comedy, though his talents
there too were as wonderful as they were delightful, yet that there were some before him, others
on a level with him, and many close behind him.... There is not only nothing so good (in my
judgment) as Hamlet, or Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, but there is nothing like Hamlet, or
Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth. There is nothing, I believe, in the majestic Corneille, equal
to the stern pride of Coriolanus, or which gives such an idea of the crumbling in pieces of
the Roman grandeur, 'like an unsubstantial pageant faded,' as the Antony and Cleopatra. But
to match the best serious comedies, such as Molière's Misanthrope and his Tartuffe, we must
go to Shakspeare's tragic characters, the Timon of Athens or honest Iago, where we shall more
than succeed. He put his strength into his tragedies and played with comedy. He was greatest
in what was greatest; and his forte was not trifling, according to the opinion here combated,
even though he might do that as well as any one else, unless he could do it better than anybody
else." See also p. 99.

CHARACTERS OF SHAKSPEARE'S PLAYS

CYMBELINE

P. 51. Dr. Johnson is of opinion. "It may be observed that in many of his plays the latter
part is evidently neglected. When he found himself near the end of his work, and in view of
his reward, he shortened the labour to snatch the profit. He therefore remits his efforts where
he should most vigorously exert them, and his catastrophe is improbably produced or imperfectly
represented." (Nichol Smith: "Eighteenth Century Essays on Shakespeare," p. 123.)

It is the peculiar excellence, etc. Cf. Coleridge's Works, IV, 75-76: "In Shakespeare all the
elements of womanhood are holy, and there is the sweet, yet dignified feeling of all that continuates
society, a sense of ancestry and of sex, with a purity unassailable by sophistry, because it
rests not in the analytic process, but in that sane equipoise of the faculties, during which
the feelings are representative of all past experience,--not of the individual only, but of
all those by whom she has been educated, and their predecessors even up to the first mother
that lived. Shakespeare saw that the want of prominence which Pope notices for sarcasm, was
the blessed beauty of the woman's character, and knew that it arose not from any deficiency,
but from the exquisite harmony of all the parts of the moral being constituting one living
total of head and heart. He has drawn it indeed in all its distinctive energies of faith, patience,
constancy, fortitude,--shown in all of them as following the heart, which gives its results
by a nice tact and happy intuition, without the intervention of the discursive faculty, sees
all things in and by the light of the affections, and errs, if it ever err, in the exaggerations
of love alone."

P. 52. Cibber, in speaking. See "Apology for the Life of Mr. Colley Cibber" (1740), I, iv.

the principle of analogy. This point is enforced by Hazlitt in connection with "Lear," "The
Tempest," "Midsummer Night's Dream," and "As You Like It." Coleridge had previously remarked,
"A unity of feeling and character pervades every drama of Shakespeare" (Works IV, 61), and
Schlegel had written in the same manner concerning "Romeo and Juliet": "The sweetest and the
bitterest love and hatred, festive rejoicings and dark forebodings, tender embraces and sepulchral
horrors, the fulness of life and self-annihilation, are here all brought close to each other;
and yet these contrasts are so blended into a unity of impression, that the echo which the
whole leaves behind in the mind resembles a single but endless sigh." (ed. Bohn, p. 401).

P. 68. He is as distinct a being, etc. Cf. Pope (Nichol Smith's "Eighteenth Century Essays,"
p. 48): "Every single character in Shakespeare is as much an individual as those in life itself;
it is impossible to find any two alike; and such as from their relation or affinity appear
most to be twins, will upon comparison be found remarkably distinct." Beattie also had commented
on "that wonderfully penetrating and plastic faculty, which is capable of representing every
species of character, not as our ordinary poets do, by a high shoulder, a wry mouth, or gigantic
stature, but by hitting off, with a delicate hand, the distinguishing feature, and that in
such a manner as makes it easily known from all others whatsoever, however similar to a superficial
eye." (Quoted in Drake's "Memorials of Shakespeare," 1828, p. 255.) Richard Cumberland had
developed a parallel between Macbeth and Richard III in the Observer, Nos. 55-58, but it is
to the suggestion of Thomas Whateley that Hazlitt is chiefly indebted. Both Richard III and
Macbeth, says Whateley, "are soldiers, both usurpers; both attain the throne by the same means,
by treason and murder; and both lose it too in the same manner, in battle against the person
claiming it as lawful heir. Perfidy, violence, and tyranny are common to both; and these only,
their obvious qualities, would have been attributed indiscriminately to both by an ordinary
dramatic writer. But Shakespeare, in conformity to the truth of history as far as it led him,
and by improving upon the fables which have been blended with it, has ascribed opposite principles
and motives to the same designs and actions, and various effects to the operation of the same
events upon different tempers. Richard and Macbeth, as represented by him, agree in nothing
but their fortunes." (See the Variorum edition of "Richard III," p. 549.) Hazlitt makes similar
discriminations between the characters of Iago and Richard III, between Henry VI and Richard
II, and between Ariel and Puck.

P. 78. There is no attempt to force an interest. Professor Saintsbury ("History of Criticism,"
III, 258) calls this utterance an apex of Shakespearian criticism. Hazlitt makes a similar
comment in the character of "Troilus and Cressida": "He has no prejudice for or against his
characters: he saw both sides of a question; at once an actor and a spectator in the scene."
Dr. Johnson had observed this attitude in Shakespeare, but he had seen in it a violation of
the demands of poetic justice: "he carries his persons indifferently through right and wrong,
and at the close dismisses them without further care, and leaves their examples to operate
by chance. This fault the barbarity of his age cannot extenuate; for it is always a writer's
duty to make the world better, and justice is a virtue independent on time or place." (Nichol
Smith's "Eighteenth Century Essays on Shakespeare," p. 123.)

English dramatists as "those noble and liberal casuists." (Works, ed. Lucas, I, 46.)

Academy of Compliments, or the Whole Duty of Courtship, being the nearest or most exact way
of wooing a Maid or Widow, by the way of Dialogue or Complimental Expressions (1655, 1669).

The neglect of punctilious exactness, etc. The entire passage follows pretty closely the interpretation
of Lamb: "Among the distinguishing features of that wonderful character, one of the most interesting
(yet painful) is that soreness of mind which makes him treat the intrusions of Polonius with
harshness, and that asperity which he puts on in his interviews with Ophelia. These tokens
of an unhinged mind (if they be not mixed in the latter case with a profound artifice of love,
to alienate Ophelia by affected discourtesies, so to prepare her mind for the breaking off
of that loving intercourse, which can no longer find a place amidst business so serious as
that which he has to do) are parts of his character, which to reconcile with our admiration
of Hamlet, the most patient consideration of his situation is no more than necessary; they
are what we forgive afterwards, and explain by the whole of his character, but at the time
they are harsh and unpleasant.... [His behavior toward Ophelia] is not alienation, it is a
distraction purely, and so it always makes itself to be felt by that object: it is not anger,
but grief assuming the appearance of anger,--love awkwardly counterfeiting hate, as sweet countenances
when they try to frown." "On the Tragedies of Shakespeare." (Works, ed. Lucas, I, 103-104)

He may be said to be amenable, etc. Cf. Coleridge (Works, IV, 145): "His thoughts, and the
images of his fancy, are far more vivid than his actual perceptions, and his very perceptions,
instantly passing through the medium of his contemplations, acquire, as they pass, a form and
a colour not naturally their own. Hence we see a great, an almost enormous, intellectual activity,
and a proportionate aversion to real action, consequent upon it, with all its symptoms and
accompanying qualities."

in which we were brought up." Works, VIII, 345.

Kean, Edmund (1787-1833), the great English tragic actor whom Hazlitt was instrumental in discovering
for the London public. Shylock and Othello were his most successful roles. For accounts of
his various performances, see "A View of the English Stage" (Works, VIII). Most of the points
in this essay are reproduced from the notice of Kean's Hamlet (VIII, 185-189).

ROMEO AND JULIET

This extract is the opening paragraph of the sketch.

P. 84. a great critic, A. W. Schlegel. The passage alluded to by Hazlitt appears in Coleridge's
Works (IV, 60-61) in what is little more than a free translation: "Read 'Romeo and Juliet';--all
is youth and spring;--youth with its follies, its virtues, its precipitancies;--spring with
its odors, its flowers, and its transiency; it is one and the same feeling that commences,
goes through, and ends the play. The old men, the Capulets and the Montagues, are not common
old men; they have an eagerness, a heartiness, a vehemence, the effect of spring; with Romeo,
his change of passion, his sudden marriage, and his rash death, are all the effects of youth;--whilst
in Juliet love has all that is tender and melancholy in the nightingale, all that is voluptuous
in the rose, with whatever is sweet in the freshness of the spring; but it ends with a long
deep sigh like the last breeze of the Italian evening."

a celebrated person, Sir Humphry Davy; see p. 342. Cf. Coleridge (Works, IV, 66): "Shakespeare
was not only a great poet, but a great philosopher."

P. 87. Poetry and the stage. Cf. Lamb, "On the Tragedies of Shakespeare" (ed. Lucas, I, 110):
"Spirits and fairies cannot be represented, they cannot even be painted,--they can only be
believed. But the elaborate and anxious provision of scenery, which the luxury of the age demands,
in these cases works a quite contrary effect to what is intended. That which in comedy, or
plays of familiar life, adds so much to the life of the imitation, in plays which appeal to
the higher faculties, positively destroys the illusion which it is introduced to aid."

HENRY IV

Hazlitt's interpretation of Falstaff is worth comparing with that of Maurice Morgann in "An
Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff," although Hazlitt does not allude to
Morgann's essay and is supposed to have had no knowledge of it. "To me then it appears that
the leading quality in Falstaff's character, and that from which all the rest take their colour,
is a high degree of wit and humour, accompanied with great natural vigour and alacrity of mind....
He seems, by nature, to have had a mind free of malice or any evil principle; but he never
took the trouble of acquiring any good one. He found himself esteemed and beloved with all
his faults; nay for his faults, which were all connected with humour, and for the most part
grew out of it. As he had, possibly, no vices but such as he thought might be openly confessed,
so he appeared more dissolute thro' ostentation. To the character of wit and humour, to which
all his other qualities seem to have conformed themselves, he appears to have added a very
necessary support, that of the profession of a Soldier.... Laughter and approbation attend
his greatest excesses; and being governed visibly by no settled bad principle or ill design,
fun and humour account for and cover all. By degrees, however, and thro' indulgence, he acquires
bad habits, becomes an humourist, grows enormously corpulent, and falls into the infirmities
of age; yet never quits, all the time, one single levity or vice of youth, or loses any of
that cheerfulness of mind which had enabled him to pass thro' this course with ease to himself
and delight to others; and thus, at last, mixing youth and age, enterprize and corpulency,
wit and folly, poverty and expence, title and buffoonery, innocence as to purpose, and wickedness
as to practice; neither incurring hatred by bad principle, or contempt by cowardice, yet involved
in circumstances productive of imputation in both; a butt and a wit, a humourist and a man

is very remarkable that in no part of his writings does Milton take any notice of the great
painters of Italy, nor, indeed, of painting as an art; while every other page breathes his
love and taste for music.... Adam bending over the sleeping Eve, in Paradise Lost, and Dalilah

P. 115. Longinus preferred the Iliad. "Whereas in the Iliad, which was written when his genius
was in its prime, the whole structure of the poem is founded on action and struggle, in the
Odyssey he generally prefers the narrative style, which is proper to old age. Hence Homer in
his Odyssey may be compared to the setting sun; he is still as great as ever, but he has lost
his fervent heat. The strain is now pitched in a lower key than in the 'Tale of Troy Divine':
we begin to miss that high and equable sublimity which never flags or sinks, that continuous
current of moving incidents, those rapid transitions, that force of eloquence, that opulence
of imagery which is ever true to Nature. Like the sea when it retires upon itself and leaves
its shores waste and bare, henceforth the tide of sublimity begins to ebb, and draws us away
into the dim region of myth and legend. In saying this I am not forgetting the fine storm-pieces
in the Odyssey, the story of the Cyclops, and other striking passages. It is Homer grown old
I am discussing, but still it is Homer." On the Sublime, IX, trans. Havell.

POPE

This selection begins with the second paragraph of the fourth lecture on the "English Poets."

P. 118. The question whether Pope was a poet. Hazlitt had written a paper in answer to this
question in the Edinburgh Magazine for February, 1818 (Works, XII, 430-432), from which the
following paragraphs down to "Such at least is the best account" are copied. The question had
been previously answered by Dr. Johnson with the same common sense as by Hazlitt: "It is surely
superfluous to answer the question that has once been asked, Whether Pope was a poet? otherwise
than by asking in return, If Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found? To circumscribe
poetry by a definition will only shew the narrowness of the definer, though a definition which
shall exclude Pope will not easily be made." ("Life of Pope," ed. B. Hill, III, 251). In their
edition of Pope (II, 140), Elwin and Courthope express the opinion that the doubt which both
Johnson and Hazlitt felt called upon to refute "was never maintained by a single person of
reputation." Yet there is something very close to such a doubt implied in the utterances of
Coleridge: "If we consider great exquisiteness of language and sweetness of metre alone, it
is impossible to deny to Pope the character of a delightful writer; but whether he was a poet,
must depend upon our definition of the word.... This, I must say, that poetry, as distinguished
from other modes of composition, does not rest in metre, and that it is not poetry, if it make
no appeal to our passions or our imagination." (Works, ed. Shedd, IV, 56.) Pope's verse was
made the occasion of a long-winded controversy as to the relative value of the natural and
artificial in poetry, lasting from 1819 to 1825, with William Bowles and Lord Byron as the
principal combatants. Hazlitt contributed an article to the London Magazine for June, 1821,
"Pope, Lord Byron and Mr. Bowles" (Works, XII, 486-508), in which he pointed out the fallacies
in Byron's position and censured the clerical priggishness of Bowles in treating of Pope's
life. The chief points in the discussion are best summed up in Prothero's edition of Byron's
"Letters and Journals," Vol. V, Appendix III.

Arbuthnot, John (1667-1735), physician and man of letters, whom Thackeray introduced in attendance
at the death-bed of Francis Esmond. "He had a very notable share in the immortal History of
John Bull, and the inimitable and praiseworthy Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus.... Arbuthnot's
style is distinguished from that of his contemporaries, even by a greater degree of terseness
and conciseness. He leaves out every superfluous word; is sparing of connecting particles,
and introductory phrases; uses always the simplest forms of construction; and is more a master
of the idiomatic peculiarities and internal resources of the language than almost any other
writer." "English Poets," Lecture VI.

allusion to this incident "a titter arose from some who were struck by the picture as ludicrous,
and a murmur from others who deemed the allusion unfit for ears polite: he paused for an instant,
and then added, in his sturdiest and most impressive manner--'an act which realizes the parable
of the Good Samaritan'--at which his moral, and his delicate hearers shrank, rebuked, into
deep silence."

THE ENGLISH NOVELISTS

From the sixth lecture on the "Comic Writers." Most of the matter had appeared in the Edinburgh
Review for February, 1815, as a review of Madame D'Arblay's "Wanderer." (See Works, X, 25-44.)
In "A Farewell to Essay-Writing" (Works, XII, 327) Hazlitt harks back to his days with Charles
and Mary Lamb: "I will not compare our hashed mutton with Amelia's; but it put us in mind of
it, and led to a discussion, sharply seasoned and well sustained, till midnight, the result
of which appeared some years after in the Edinburgh Review."

Cervantes, Miguel (1547-1616), Spanish novelist whose most famous work is "Don Quixote."

Le Sage, Alain René (1668-1747), French novelist, author of "Gil Blas."

Fielding, Henry (1707-1754). His most important novels are "Joseph Andrews" (1742), "Tom Jones"
(1749), "Amelia" (1751), "Jonathan Wild" (1743).

Smollett, Tobias (1721-1771), wrote "Roderick Random" (1748), "Peregrine Pickle" (1751), "Ferdinand
Count Fathom" (1753), "Launcelot Greaves" (1762), "Humphrey Clinker" (1771).

Richardson, Samuel (1689-1761), wrote "Pamela" (1740), "Clarissa Harlowe" (1747-48), "Sir Richard
Grandison" (1753).

Sterne, Laurence (1713-1768), wrote "Tristram Shandy" (1759-67), "A Sentimental Journey Through
France and Italy" (1768).

P. 158. in these several writers. A few paragraphs are here omitted treating of "Don Quixote,"
"Lazarillo de Tormes" (1553), "Guzman d'Alfarache" by Mateo Aleman (1599), and "Gil Blas."

They are thoroughly English. In the review of Walpole's Letters (Works, X, 168), Hazlitt says:
"There is nothing of a tea inspiration in any of his [Fielding's] novels. They are assuredly
the finest thing of the kind in the language; and we are Englishmen enough to consider them
the best in any language. They are indubitably the most English of all the works of Englishmen."

Hogarth, William (1697-1764), painter and engraver of moral and satirical subjects. His two
most famous series of paintings are "The Rake's Progress" and "Marriage à la Mode." Lamb in
his "Essay on the Genius and Character of Hogarth" observes: "Other pictures we look at,--his
prints we read." Hazlitt, sharing this view, includes an account of Hogarth in the seventh
lecture of the "Comic Writers," which opens as follows: "If the quantity of amusement, or of
matter for more serious reflection which their works have afforded, is that by which we are
to judge of precedence among the intellectual benefactors of mankind, there are, perhaps, few
persons who can put in a stronger claim to our gratitude than Hogarth. It is not hazarding
too much to assert, that he was one of the greatest comic geniuses that ever lived."

"There is not a single thing that Sir Charles Grandison does or says all through the book from
liking to any person or object but himself, and with a view to answer to a certain standard
of perfection for which he pragmatically sets up. He is always thinking of himself, and trying
to show that he is the wisest, happiest, and most virtuous person in the whole world. He is
(or would be thought) a code of Christian ethics; a compilation and abstract of all gentlemanly
accomplishments. There is nothing, I conceive, that excites so little sympathy as this inordinate
egotism; or so much disgust as this everlasting self-complacency. Yet this self-admiration,
brought forward on every occasion as the incentive to every action and reflected from all around
him, is the burden and pivot of the story."

CHARACTER OF MR. BURKE

First published in the "Eloquence of the British Senate" and republished in "Political Essays."

P. 172. The following speech. Hazlitt refers to the speech On the Economic Reform (February
11, 1780). See Burke's Works, ed. Bohn, II, 55-126.

P. 174. the elephant to make them sport. "Paradise Lost" IV, 345.

native and endued. "Hamlet," iv, 7, 180.

Lord Chatham. William Pitt, Earl of Chatham (1708-1778), the great English statesman.

P. 176. a new creation. Goldsmith's "Traveler," 296.

P. 178. All the great changes. Cf. Morley's "Life of Burke," ch. 8: "All really profound speculation
about society comes in time to touch the heart of every other object of speculation, not by
directly contributing new truths or directly corroborating old ones, but by setting men to
consider the consequences to life of different opinions on these abstract subjects, and their
relations to the great paramount interests of society, however those interests may happen at
the time to be conceived. Burke's book marks a turning-point in literary history, because it
was the signal for that reaction over the whole field of thought, into which the Revolution
drove many of the finest minds of the next generation, by showing the supposed consequences
of pure individualistic rationalism."

P. 179. Alas! Leviathan. Cowper's "Task," II, 322.

the corner stone. Psalms, cxvii, 22.

to the Jews. 1 Corinthians, i, 23.

P. 183. the consequences of his writings. In this view Hazlitt has the full support of Lord Morley.

P. 184. How charming. Milton's "Comus," 476.

He was one of the severest writers we have. The description of Burke's style which follows
should be compared with that given on pp. 344-5 and with the splendid passage in the "Plain
Speaker" essay "On the Prose Style of Poets," beginning: "It has always appeared to me that
the most perfect prose-style, the most powerful, the most dazzling, the most daring, that which
went the nearest to the verge of poetry, and yet never fell over, was Burke's. It has the solidity,
and sparkling effect of the diamond; all other fine writing is like French paste or Bristol-stones
in the comparison. Burke's style is airy, flighty, adventurous, but it never loses sight of
the subject; nay, is always in contact with, and derives its increased or varying impulse from
it. It may be said to pass yawning gulfs 'on the unsteadfast footing of a spear:' still it
has an actual resting-place and tangible support under it--it is not suspended on nothing.
It differs from poetry, as I conceive, like the chamois from the eagle: it climbs to an almost
equal height, touches upon a cloud, overlooks a precipice, is picturesque, sublime--but all
the while, instead of soaring through the air, it stands upon a rocky cliff, clambers up by
abrupt and intricate ways, and browzes on the roughest bark, or crops the tender flower."

P. 186. the set or formal style. See pp. 147-8.

P. 187. Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770), a criticism of the ministerial
policy of the English government under George III.

Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), a severe arraignment of the principles which
inspired the revolution and a prophetic warning of its consequences.

Letter to the Duke of Bedford. A Letter from the Right Hon. Edmund Burke, to a Noble Lord,
on the attacks made upon him and his pension, in the House of Lords, by the Duke of Bedford
and the Earl of Lauderdale, early in the present session of Parliament. (1706.)

Regicide Peace. Three Letters addressed to a Member of the Present Parliament, on the proposals
for peace with the regicide Directory of France. (1796.)

P. 188. Fox, Charles James (1749-1806), the famous Whig statesman who was frequently the opponent
of Burke and of the younger Pitt.

P. 189. Dr. Johnson observed, in his "Life of Pope" (ed. Birkbeck Hill, III, 230): "In their
similes the greatest writers have sometimes failed; the ship-race, compared with the chariot-race,
is neither illustrated nor aggrandised; land and water make all the difference: when Apollo
running after Daphne is likened to a greyhound chasing a hare, there is nothing gained; the
ideas of pursuit and flight are too plain to be made plainer, and a god and the daughter of
a god are not represented much to their advantage by a hare and a dog."

a person. Conjecturally Joseph Fawcett. In the essay "On Criticism" ("Table Talk") Hazlitt
says: "The person of the most refined and least contracted taste I ever knew was the late Joseph
Fawcett, the friend of my youth. He was almost the first literary acquaintance I ever made,
and I think the most candid and unsophisticated. He had a masterly perception of all styles
and of every kind and degree of excellence, sublime or beautiful, from Milton's Paradise Lost
to Shenstone's Pastoral Ballad, from Butler's Analogy down to Humphrey Clinker."

P. 189, n. the comparison of the British Constitution. "Letter to a Noble Lord," Works, ed.
Bohn, V, 137.

MR. WORDSWORTH

From "The Spirit of the Age." Characterizations of Wordsworth also occur in the lecture "On
the Living Poets" and in the Essay "On Genius and Common Sense" in "Table Talk."

P. 191. lowliness is young ambition's ladder. "Julius Cæsar," ii, 1, 22.

no figures. Cf. "Julius Cæsar," ii, 1, 231: " Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy
care draws in the brains of men."

skyey influences. "Measure for Measure," iii, 1, 9.

P. 192. nihil humani. Terence: "Heautontimoroumenos." i, 1, 25.

the cloud-capt towers. "Tempest," iv, 1, 151.

P. 193. the judge's robe. Cf. "Measure for Measure," ii, 2, 59;

  "No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
  Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
  The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe."

Pindar and Alcæus. Greek lyric poets.

a sense of joy. Wordsworth's "To My Sister."

P. 194. Beneath the hills. Cf. Wordsworth's "Excursion," VI, 531:

  "Amid the groves, under the shadowy hills
  The generations are prepared...."

P. 195. To him the meanest flower. "Ode on the Intimations of Immortality."

P. 196. Grasmere was the residence of Wordsworth between 1799 and 1813.

Cole-Orton was the residence of Wordsworth's friend, Sir George Beaumont, to whom he dedicated
the 1815 edition of his poems: "Some of the best pieces were composed under the shade of your
own groves, upon the classic ground of Cole-Orton."

P. 197. Calm contemplation. Cf. "Laodamia": "Calm pleasures there abide, majestic pains."

Fall blunted "from each indurated heart." Goldsmith's "Traveler," 232.

and fit audience. Wordsworth quotes this line from "Paradise Lost," VII, 31, in "The Recluse," 776:

  "'Fit audience let me find though few!'
  So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard--
  In holiest mood."

P. 198. The Excursion. Hazlitt wrote a review of this poem for the Examiner which not only
aroused Wordsworth's resentment but led to one of his disagreements with Lamb. The review appears
in the "Round Table."

toujours perdrix, "always partridges," alluding to a story of a French king, who, on being
reproved by his confessor for faithlessness to his wife, punished the offender by causing him
to be fed on nothing but his favorite dish, which was partridge. See Notes and Queries, Series
IV, Vol. III, p. 336.

In his person. In 1803, while on a visit to the Lake Country, Hazlitt had painted a portrait
of Wordsworth. "He has painted Wordsworth," writes Southey, "but so dismally, though Wordsworth's
face is his idea of physiognomical perfection, that one of his friends, on seeing it, exclaimed,
'At the gallows--deeply affected by his deserved fate--yet determined to die like a man;' and
if you saw the picture, you would admire the criticism." "Life and Correspondence," II, 238.

His manner of reading. See p. 295.

a man of no mark. 1 "Henry IV," iii, 2, 45.

P. 199. He finds fault with Dryden's description. Hazlitt adopted this criticism in his lecture
"On Pope and Dryden."

P. 200. Titian (c. 1477-1576), the great Venetian painter.

Chaucer. Wordsworth's modernizations of Chaucer are "The Prioress's Tale," "The Cuckoo and
the Nightingale," and a part of "Troilus and Cressida."

a tragedy. "The Borderers" was written in 1795-96 but not published till 1842. The quotation
which follows is from Act iii, 1, 405, and should read:

  "Action is transitory--a step, a blow,
  The motion of a muscle--this way or that--
  'Tis done, and in the after-vacancy
  We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed;
  Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,
  And shares the nature of infinity."

Wordsworth quoted these lines after the dedication to "The White Doe of Rylstone" and later
added a note: "This and the five lines that follow were either read or recited by me more than
thirty years since, to the late Mr. Hazlitt, who quoted some expressions in them (imperfectly
remembered) in a work of his published several years ago."

P. 201. Let observation. Cf. De Quincey's "Rhetoric" (Works, ed. Masson, X, 128): "We recollect
a little biographic sketch of Dr. Johnson, published immediately after his death, in which,
among other instances of desperate tautology, the author quotes the well-known lines from the
Doctor's imitation of Juvenal--'Let observation,' etc., and contends with some reason that
this is saying in effect,--'Let observation with extensive observation observe mankind extensively.'"
Coleridge somewhere makes the same remark.

Drawcansir. A character in "The Rehearsal" by the Duke of Buckingham.

  "Let petty kings the names of Parties know:
  Where'er I am, I slay both friend and foe."   v, 1.

Walton's Angler. In the fifth lecture of the "English Poets" Hazlitt writes: "Perhaps the best
pastoral in the language is that prose-poem, Walton's Complete Angler. That well-known work
has a beauty and romantic interest equal to its simplicity, and arising out of it. In the description
of a fishing-tackle, you perceive the piety and humanity of the author's mind. It is to be
doubted whether Sannazarius's Piscatory Eclogues are equal to the scenes described by Walton
on the banks of the river Lea. He gives the feeling of the open air: we walk with him along
the dusty roadside, or repose on the banks of a river under a shady tree; and in watching for
the finny prey, imbibe what he beautifully calls 'the patience and simplicity of poor honest
fishermen.' We accompany them to their inn at night, and partake of their simple, but delicious
fare; while Maud, the pretty milkmaid, at her mother's desire, sings the classical ditties
of the poet Marlow; 'Come live with me, and be my love.'"

Paley, William (1743-1805), a noted theologian. Cf. "On the Clerical Character" in "Political
Essays" (Works, III, 276): "This same shuffling divine is the same Dr. Paley, who afterwards
employed the whole of his life, and his moderate second-hand abilities, in tampering with religion,
morality, and politics,--in trimming between his convenience and his conscience,--in crawling
between heaven and earth, and trying to cajole both. His celebrated and popular work on Moral
Philosophy, is celebrated and popular for no other reason, than that it is a somewhat ingenious
and amusing apology for existing abuses of any description, by which any thing is to be got.
It is a very elaborate and consolatory elucidation of the text, that men should not quarrel
with their bread and butter. It is not an attempt to show what is right, but to palliate and
find out plausible excuses for what is wrong. It is a work without the least value, except
as a convenient commonplace book or vade mecum, for tyro politicians and young divines, to
smooth their progress in the Church or the State. This work is a text-book in the University:
its morality is the acknowledged morality of the House of Commons." See also Coleridge's opinion
of Paley on p. 288.

Bewick, Thomas (1753-1828), a well-known wood-engraver.

Waterloo, Antoine (1609?-1676?), a French engraver, painter, and etcher.

Rembrandt, Harmans van Rijn (1606-1669.), Dutch painter, whose mastery of light and shade was
the object of Hazlitt's special admiration.

P. 202. He hates conchology, etc. See the lecture "On the Living Poets": "He hates all science
and all art; he hates chemistry, he hates conchology; he hates Voltaire; he hates Sir Isaac
Newton; he hates wisdom; he hates wit; he hates metaphysics, which he says are unintelligible,
and yet he would be thought to understand them; he hates prose; he hates all poetry but his
own; he hates the dialogues in Shakespeare; he hates music, dancing, and painting; he hates
Rubens, he hates Rembrandt; he hates Raphael, he hates Titian; he hates Vandyke; he hates the
antique; he hates the Apollo Belvidere; he hates the Venus of Medicis."

Where one for sense. Butler's "Hudibras," II, 29.

P. 203. take the good. Plautus's "Rudens," iv, 7.

MR. COLERIDGE

From the "Spirit of the Age."

P. 207. and by the force. Cf. "Macbeth," iii, 5, 28: "As by the strength of their illusion
Shalt draw him on to his confusion."

rich strond. "Faërie Queene," III, iv, 18, 29, 34.

goes sounding. "Hazlitt seems to have had a hazy recollection of two passages in Chaucer's
Prologue. In his essay on 'My First Acquaintance with Poets,' he says, 'the scholar in Chaucer
is described as going "sounding on his way,"' and in his Lectures on the English Poets he says,
'the merchant, as described in Chaucer, went on his way "sounding always the increase of his
winning."' The scholar is not described as 'sounding on his way,' but Chaucer says of him,
'Souninge in moral vertu was his speche,' while the merchant, though 'souninge alway th' encrees
of his winning,' is not described as going on his way. Wordsworth has a line ('Excursion,'
Book III), 'Went sounding on a dim and perilous way,' but it seems clear that Hazlitt thought
he was quoting Chaucer." Waller-Glover, IV, 412.

P. 208. his own nothings. "Coriolanus," ii, 2, 81.

letting contemplation. Cf. Dyer's "Grongar Hill," 26: "till contemplation have its fill."

Sailing with supreme dominion. Gray's "Progress of Poesy."

He lisped. Pope's "Prologue to the Satires," 128.

Ode on Chatterton. "Monody on the Death of Chatterton," written by Coleridge in 1790, at the
age of eighteen.

P. 209. gained several prizes. "At Cambridge Coleridge won the Browne Gold Medal for a Greek
Ode in 1792." Waller-Glover.

At Christ's Hospital, a London school which Leigh Hunt and Lamb attended about the same time
as Coleridge. The former has left a record of its life in his "Autobiography," and Lamb has
written of it, with special reference to Coleridge, in his "Recollections of Christ's Hospital"
and "Christ's Hospital Five-and-Thirty Years Ago."

Struggling in vain. "Excursion," VI, 557.

P. 210. Hartley, David (1705-1757), author of "Observations on Man" (1749), and identified
chiefly with the theory of association. Cf. Coleridge's "Religious Musings," 368: "and he of
mortal kind Wisest, he first who marked the ideal tribes Up the fine fibres through the sentient
brain."

Dr. Priestley, Joseph (1733-1804), scientist and philosopher of the materialistic school, author
of "The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated" (1777). "See! Priestley there, patriot,
and saint, and sage." "Religious Musings," 371.

Bishop Berkeley's fairy-world. George Berkeley (1685-1753), idealistic philosopher. Cf. p. 287.

Malebranche, Nicholas (1638-1715), author of "De la Recherche de la Vérité" (1674).

Cudworth, Ralph (1617-1688), author of "The True Intellectual System of the Universe" (1678).

Lord Brook's hieroglyphical theories. Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke (1554-1628), friend and biographer
of Sir Philip Sidney.

Bishop Butler's Sermons. Joseph Butler (1692-1752), author of "Fifteen Sermons Preached at
the Rolls Chapel" (1726), and "The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution
and Course of Nature" (1736).

Duchess of Newcastle. Margaret Cavendish (1624?-1674), published about a dozen folio volumes
of philosophical fancies, poems, and plays. In "Mackery End in Hertfordshire" Lamb refers to
her as "the thrice noble, chaste, and virtuous, but again somewhat fantastical and original-brained,
generous Margaret Newcastle."

Clarke, Samuel (1675-1729), English theologian of latitudinarian principles.

South, Robert (1634-1716), controversial writer and preacher.

Tillotson, John (1630-1694), a popular theological writer of rationalistic tendency.

Leibnitz's Pre-established Harmony. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716), a German philosopher,
represented the world as consisting of an infinite number of independent substances or monads
related to each other in such a way (by the pre-established harmony) as to form one universe.
Cf. Coleridge's "Destiny of Nations," 38 ff.:

                      "Others boldlier think
  That as one body seems the aggregate
  Of atoms numberless, each organized;
  So by a strange and dim similitude
  Infinite myriads of self-conscious minds
  Are an all-conscious spirit, which informs
  With absolute ubiquity of thought
  (His own eternal self-affirming act!)
  All his involved Monads, that yet seem
  With various province and apt agency
  Each to pursue its own self-centering end."

P. 210, n. And so by many. "Two Gentlemen of Verona," ii, 7, 30.

P. 211. hortus siccus [dry garden] of Dissent. Burke's "Reflections on the French Revolution,"
Works, ed. Bohn, II, 287.

John Huss (1373?-1415), Bohemian reformer and martyr.

Jerome of Prague, a follower of Huss who was burnt for heresy in 1416.

doctrine of the Trinity.

John Zisca (1370?-1424), a leader of the extreme Hussite party.

Neal's History. Daniel Neal (1648-1743) published his "History of the Puritans" 1732-38.

Calamy, Edmund (1671-1732) published an "Account of the Ministers, Lecturers, Masters and Fellows
of Colleges, and Schoolmasters who were Ejected or Silenced after the Restoration of 1660"
(1702 and 1713).

Spinoza, Baruch (1632-1677), a Dutch philosopher of Jewish parentage, the chief representative
of Pantheism, "the doctrine of one infinite substance, of which all finite existences are modes
or limitations."

When he saw. Cf. Coleridge's "Remorse," iv, 2, 100:

  "When we saw nought but beauty; when we heard
  The voice of that Almighty One who loved us
  In every gale that breathed, and wave that murmur'd!"

Proclus (410-485) and Plotinus (204-270), philosophers of the Neo-Platonic school. In "Biographia
Literaria" (chap. 9) Coleridge refers to his "early study of Plato and of Plotinus, with the
commentaries and the 'Theologia Platonica' of the illustrious Florentine; of Proclus, and Gemistius
Pletho."

Duns Scotus (1265 or 1275-1308) and Thomas Aquinas (1227-1274), two great theologians of the
Catholic Church.

Jacob Behmen or Böhme (1575-1624), a German religious mystic who exerted considerable influence
on English religious thought in the eighteenth century. In the "Biographia Literaria" (chap.
9) Coleridge writes: "A meek and shy quietist, his intellectual powers were never stimulated
into feverous energy by crowds of proselytes, or by the ambition of proselyting. Jacob Behmen
was an enthusiast in the strictest sense, as not merely distinguished, but as contradistinguished
from a fanatic.... The writings of these Mystics acted in no slight degree to prevent my mind
from being imprisoned within the outline of any single dogmatic system."

Swedenborg, Emanuel (1688-1772), the Swedish scientist and mystic from whom have sprung some
of the modern theosophical cults.

Religious Musings, published in his "Poems on Various Subjects" (1796).

the glad prose of Jeremy Taylor. Cf. "Literature of the Age of Elizabeth," Lecture VII: "In
his writings, the frail stalk of human life reclines on the bosom of eternity. His Holy Living
and Dying is a divine pastoral. He writes to the faithful followers of Christ, as the shepherd
pipes to his flock. He introduces touching and heartfelt appeals to familiar life; condescends
to men of low estate; and his pious page blushes with modesty and beauty. His style is prismatic.
It unfolds the colours of the rainbow; it floats like the bubble through the air; it is like
innumerable dew-drops that glitter on the face of morning, and tremble as they glitter. He
does not dig his way underground, but slides upon ice, borne on the winged car of fancy. The
dancing light he throws upon objects is like an Aurora Borealis, playing betwixt heaven and
earth.... In a word, his writings are more like fine poetry than any other prose whatever;
they are a choral song in praise of virtue, and a hymn to the Spirit of the Universe."

Bowles, William Lisle (1762-1850), published "Fourteen Sonnets" in 1789, and a second edition
containing twenty-one in the same year. In the first chapter of the "Biographia Literaria,"
Coleridge credits the sonnets of Bowles with saving him from a premature absorption in metaphysics
and theology and with introducing him to the excellences of the new school of poetry. In his
enthusiasm he went about making proselytes for Bowles and "as my school finances did not permit
me to purchase copies, I made, within less than a year and a half, more than forty transcriptions,
as the best presents I could offer to those, who had in any way won my regard. And with almost
equal delight did I receive the three or four following publications of the same author." Coleridge
also addressed a "Sonnet to Bowles," opening

  "My heart hath thanked thee, Bowles! for those soft strains,
  That on the still air floating tremblingly,
  Wak'd in me Fancy, Love, and Sympathy!"

P. 212. John Bull. Croker's John Bull was a scurrilous newspaper edited by Theodore Hook, the
first number of which appeared December 17, 1820.

Mr. Croker, John Wilson (1780-1857), politician and man of letters, one of Hazlitt's pet aversions,
and the same who comes in for such a severe chastisement in Macaulay's review of his edition
of Boswell's "Johnson."

Junius, the mysterious author of a famous series of political letters which appeared in the
London Public Advertiser from January 21, 1769, to January 21, 1772, collected as the "Letters
of Junius" in 1772. The name of Sir Philip Francis is the one most persistently associated
with the composition of these letters.

Godwin, William (1756-1836), leader of the philosophical radicals in England and a believer
in the perfectibility of man, wrote "An Enquiry concerning Political Justice" (1793), "Caleb
Williams" (1794), and other novels and miscellaneous works. Godwin was the husband of Mary
Wolstonecraft, and the father-in-law of Shelley. Hazlitt wrote a sketch of him in the "Spirit
of the Age" and reviewed his last novel, "Cloudesley," in the Edinburgh Review. Coleridge has
a Sonnet to William Godwin:

  "Nor will I not thy holy guidance bless,
  And hymn thee, Godwin! with an ardent lay;
  For that thy voice, in Passion's stormy day
  When wild I roam'd the bleak Heath of Distress,
  Bade the bright form of Justice meet my way--
  And told me that her name was Happiness."

Sorrows of Werter, a sentimental novel of Goethe's, the work by which he was most generally
known to English readers in Hazlitt's day.

laugh'd with Rabelais. Cf. Pope's "Dunciad," I, 22: "Or laugh and shake in Rab'lais easy chair."

spoke with rapture of Raphael. Coleridge had visited Italy in 1806 on his return from a stay
in Malta, and had devoted his time there to a study of Italian art. See p. 298 n.

Giotto (d. 1337), Ghirlandaio, whose real name was Domenico Bigardi (1449-1494), and Massaccio
(1402-1429) were early Florentine painters.

wandered into Germany. Coleridge's visit to Germany and his introduction to the leading German
philosophers dates back to 1798-99.

Kantean philosophy. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was the leader of modern philosophy. "The writings
of the illustrious sage of Königsberg, the founder of the Critical Philosophy, more than any
other work, at once invigorated and disciplined my understanding. The originality, the depth,
and the compression of the thoughts; the novelty and subtlety, yet solidity and importance
of the distinctions; the adamantine chain of the logic; and I will venture to add--(paradox
as it will appear to those who have taken their notion of Immanuel Kant from Reviewers and
Frenchmen)--the clearness and evidence, of the Critique of Pure Reason; and Critique of the
Judgment; of the Metaphysical Elements of Natural Philosophy; and of his Religion within the
bounds of Pure Reason, took possession of me as with a giant's hand. After fifteen years' familiarity
with them, I still read these and all his other productions with undiminished delight and increasing
admiration." "Biographia Literaria," chap. IX.

Schelling, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph (1775-1829). "In Schelling's Natur-Philosophie, and the
System des Transcendentalen Idealismus, I first found a genial coincidence with much that I
had toiled out for myself, and a powerful assistance in what I had yet to do.... Many of the
most striking resemblances, indeed all the main and fundamental ideas, were born and matured
in my mind before I had ever seen a single page of the German Philosopher; and I might indeed
affirm with truth, before the most important works of Schelling had been written, or at least
made public. Nor is this coincidence at all to be wondered at. We had studied in the same school;
been disciplined by the same preparatory philosophy, namely, the writings of Kant; we had both
equal obligations to the polar logic and dynamic philosophy of Giordano Bruno; and Schelling
has lately, and, as of recent acquisition, avowed that same affectionate reverence for the
labors of Behmen, and other mystics, which I had formed at a much earlier period." Ibid.

The same passage had been singled out for praise by Hazlitt in his lecture "On the Living Poets"
and in the review of "Christabel" which had appeared in the Examiner of June 2, 1816. The authorship
of this review has been disputed but should on internal evidence, despite its failure in appreciation,
be ascribed to Hazlitt. See Works, XI, 580-582.

The sketch in the Spirit of the Age concludes with a contrast between Coleridge and William Godwin.

MR. SOUTHEY

This selection forms the conclusion of a sketch of Southey in the "Spirit of the Age." It illustrates,
even more strikingly than the "Character of Burke," Hazlitt's power of dissociating his judgments
from his prejudices, inasmuch as there had been exchanges of rancorous personalities between
the two men.

his theory that poets turned out inferior prose. "I have but an indifferent opinion of the
prose-style of poets: not that it is not sometimes good, nay, excellent; but it is never the
better, and generally the worse from the habit of writing verse."

"The Cid."

P. 219. Pindaric or Shandean, i.e., whimsical. Pindaric should of course be understood as a
reference to Peter Pindar, the name under which John Wolcot (1738-1819) wrote his coarse and
whimsical satires. Hazlitt mentions him at the end of his lectures "On the Comic Writers":
"The bard in whom the nation and the king delighted, is old and blind, but still merry and
wise:--remembering how he has made the world laugh in his time, and not repenting of the mirth
he has given; with an involuntary smile lighted up at the mad pranks of his Muse, and the lucky
hits of his pen." Shandean is derived from Sterne's novel, "Tristram Shandy."

And follows so. "Henry V," iv, 1, 293.

his political inconsistency. This is the subject of Hazlitt's attacks on Southey. See "Political
Essays" (Works, III, 109-120, 192-232).

ELIA

The last essay in the "Spirit of the Age" is entitled "Elia and Geoffrey Crayon." An edition
published at Paris by Galignani in 1825 omits the account of Washington Irving, and this text,
as it is in all respects unexceptionable, has been here adopted for the sake of coherence.
In a letter to Bernard Barton, February 10, 1825, Lamb refers to Hazlitt's sketch: "He has
laid too many colours on my likeness, but I have had so much injustice done me in my own name,
that I make a rule of accepting as much over-measure to 'Elia' as Gentlemen think proper to
bestow."

do not in broad rumor lie, and the two following quotations are free renderings of "Lycidas,"

Mr. Lamb rather affects. Hazlitt had Lamb in his eye when he described the Occult School in
the essay "On Criticism" ("Table Talk"): "There is another race of critics who might be designated
as the Occult School--verè adepti. They discern no beauties but what are concealed from superficial
eyes, and overlook all that are obvious to the vulgar part of mankind. Their art is the transmutation
of styles. By happy alchemy of mind they convert dross into gold--and gold into tinsel. They
see farther into a millstone than most others. If an author is utterly unreadable, they can
read him for ever: his intricacies are their delight, his mysteries are their study. They prefer
Sir Thomas Brown to the Rambler by Dr. Johnson, and Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy to all the
writers of the Georgian Age. They judge of works of genius as misers do of hid treasure--it
is of no value unless they have it all to themselves. They will no more share a book than a
mistress with a friend. If they suspected their favourite volumes of delighting any eyes but
their own, they would immediately discard them from the list. Theirs are superannuated beauties
that every one else has left off intriguing with, bed-ridden hags, a 'stud of night-mares.'
This is not envy or affectation, but a natural proneness to singularity, a love of what is
odd and out of the way. They must come at their pleasures with difficulty, and support admiration
by an uneasy sense of ridicule and opposition. They despise those qualities in a work which
are cheap and obvious. They like a monopoly of taste, and are shocked at the prostitution of
intellect implied in popular productions. In like manner, they would chuse a friend or recommend
a mistress for gross defects; and tolerate the sweetness of an actress's voice only for the
ugliness of her face. Pure pleasures are in their judgment cloying and insipid--

  'An ounce of sour is worth a pound of sweet!'

Nothing goes down with them but what is caviare to the multitude. They are eaters of olives
and readers of black-letter. Yet they smack of genius, and would be worth any money, were it
only for the rarity of the thing!"

a certain writer. Hazlitt himself. It is known to everybody that the friendship of Lamb for
Hazlitt suffered certain strains, and various attempts have been made to guess at the provocations.
Mutual recriminations in regard to literary borrowings have been thought to be responsible
for more than one breach. So Mr. Bertram Dobell, in his "Sidelights on Lamb," 212-14, imagines
that the mystery is solved in a letter of Hazlitt's to the editor of the London Magazine (April
12, 1820) charging Lamb with appropriating his ideas: "Do you keep the Past and Future? You
see Lamb argues the same view of the subject. That 'young master' will anticipate all my discoveries
if I don't mind." The similarity of idea between Hazlitt's "Past and Future" and Lamb's "New
Year's Eve," and the appearance in Lamb's essay of the phrase "young masters" makes it clear
enough what Hazlitt is referring to, but that either man should have taken the matter very
seriously is hard to believe. It is easier to look upon Hazlitt's expression as banter of the
same kind that Lamb allowed himself in connection with the essay on "Guy Faux" alluded to in
the present sketch. This subject had been proposed by Lamb, as we are informed in "Of Persons
One Would Wish to Have Seen," and had been written up by Hazlitt in the Examiner in 1821 (Works,
XI, 317-334). Two years later Lamb contributed a paper on the same subject to the London Magazine,
founded partly on an essay in the Reflector (1811), entitled "On the Probable Effects of the
Gunpowder Treason." The essay in the London Magazine (Lamb's Works, ed. Lucas, I, 236 ff.)
opens with a facetious thrust at Hazlitt: "A very ingenious and subtle writer, whom there is
good reason for suspecting to be an ex-Jesuit, not unknown at Douay some five-and-twenty years
since (he will not obtrude himself at M--th again in a hurry), about a twelvemonth back, set
himself to prove the character of the Powder Plot conspirators to have been that of heroic
self-devotedness and true Christian martyrdom. Under the mask of Protestant candour, he actually
gained admission for his treatise into a London weekly paper, not particularly distinguished
for its zeal towards either religion. But, admitting Catholic principles, his arguments are
shrewd and incontrovertible. [Then follows a quotation from Hazlitt setting forth the Catholic
standpoint.] It is impossible, upon Catholic principles, not to admit the force of this reasoning;
we can only not help smiling (with the writer) at the simplicity of the gulled editor, swallowing
the dregs of Loyola for the very quintessence of sublimated reason in England at the commencement
of the nineteenth century. We will just, as a contrast, show what we Protestants (who are a
party concerned) thought upon the same subject, at a period rather nearer to the heroic project
in question." This is the kind of resentment we would expect Lamb to show at the appropriation
of his ideas. That there were not wanting grounds for real grievance against Hazlitt may be
gathered from a letter to Wordsworth, September 23, 1816 (Lamb's Works, ed. Lucas, VI, 491):
"There was a cut at me a few months back by the same hand.... It was a pretty compendium of
observation, which the author has collected in my disparagement, from some hundred of social
evenings which we had spent together,--however in spite of all, there is something tough in
my attachment to H---- which these violent strainings cannot quite dislocate or sever asunder.
I get no conversation in London that is absolutely worth attending to but his." To one of his
quarrels with Lamb Hazlitt owes the finest compliment he ever received, and happily it marks
the termination of all differences between them. It occurs in the well-known "Letter of Elia
to Robert Southey" which Lamb published in the London Magazine when Southey reproached him
with his friendship for Hazlitt (Works, I, 233): "I stood well with him for fifteen years (the
proudest of my life), and have ever spoke my full mind of him to some, to whom his panegyric
must naturally be least tasteful. I never in thought swerved from him, I never betrayed him,
I never slackened in my admiration for him, I was the same to him (neither better nor worse)
though he could not see it, as in the days when he thought fit to trust me. At this instant,
he may be preparing for me some compliment, above my deserts, as he has sprinkled many such
among his admirable books, for which I rest his debtor; or, for any thing I know, or can guess
to the contrary, he may be about to read a lecture on my weaknesses. He is welcome to them
(as he was to my humble hearth), if they can divert a spleen, or ventilate a fit of sullenness.
I wish he would not quarrel with the world at the rate he does; but the reconciliation must
be effected by himself, and I despair of living to see that day. But, protesting against much
that he has written, and some things he chooses to do; judging him by his conversation which
I enjoyed so long, and relished so deeply; or by his books, in those places where no clouding
passion intervenes--I should belie my own conscience, if I said less, than that I think W.
H. to be, in his natural and healthy state, one of the wisest and finest spirits breathing.
So far from being ashamed of that intimacy, which was betwixt us, it is my boast that I was
able for so many years to have preserved it entire; and I think I shall go to my grave without
finding, or expecting to find, such another companion."

Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy was published in 1621. Its quaint prose was often imitated by
Lamb and had a direct effect on his style.

Parnell, Thomas (1679-1717). In the sixth lecture on the "English Poets" Hazlitt says: "Parnell,
though a good-natured, easy man, and a friend to poets and the Muses, was himself little more
than an occasional versifier."

Gay, John (1685-1732), is best known by his "Beggar's Opera" (1728) and "Fables" (1727 and
1738). Hazlitt writes of Gay in the sixth lecture on the "English Poets" and has a paper on
"The Beggar's Opera" in the "Round Table."

His taste in French and German. Cf. "On Old English Writers and Speakers" in the "Plain Speaker":
"Mr. Lamb has lately taken it into his head to read St. Evremont, and works of that stamp.
I neither praise nor blame him for it. He observed, that St. Evremont was a writer half-way
between Montaigne and Voltaire, with a spice of the wit of the one and the sense of the other.
I said I was always of the opinion that there had been a great many clever people in the world,
both in France and England, but I had been sometimes rebuked for it. Lamb took this as a slight
reproach; for he had been a little exclusive and national in his tastes."

SIR WALTER SCOTT

This selection forms the latter half of the sketch of Scott in the "Spirit of the Age." The
following dialogue between Northcote and Hazlitt, "Conversations of Northcote," XVI, represents
Hazlitt's feelings for Scott: "N. 'You don't know him, do you? He'd be a pattern to you. Oh!
he has a very fine manner. You would learn to rub off some of your asperities. But you admire
him, I believe.' H. 'Yes; on this side of idolatry and Toryism.' N. 'That is your prejudice.'
H. 'Nay, it rather shows my liberality, if I am a devoted enthusiast notwithstanding. There
are two things I admire in Sir Walter, his capacity and his simplicity; which indeed I am apt
to think are much the same.'"

P. 242. Lord Byron does not exhibit a new view of nature. In the paper on "Pope, Lord Byron
and Mr. Bowles," Hazlitt's tone is more generous: "His Lordship likes the poetry, the imaginative
part of art, and so do we.... He likes the sombre part of it, the thoughtful, the decayed,
the ideal, the spectral shadow of human greatness, the departed spirit of human power. He sympathizes
not with art as a display of ingenuity, as the triumph of vanity or luxury, as it is connected
with the idiot, superficial, petty self-complacency of the individual and the moment (these
are to him not 'luscious as locusts, but bitter as coloquintida'); but he sympathizes with
the triumphs of Time and Fate over the proudest works of man--with the crumbling monuments
of human glory--with the dim vestiges and countless generations of men--with that which claims
alliance with the grave, or kindred with the elements of nature." Works, XI, 496.

Did the latter ever acknowledge the obligation? Scott wrote to Byron's publisher, John Murray,
December 17, 1821: "I accept with feelings of great obligation, the flattering proposal of
Lord Byron to prefix my name to the very grand and tremendous drama of 'Cain.' I may be partial
to it, and you will allow I have cause; but I do not think that his Muse has ever taken so

Poetry, according to Lord Bacon. Cf. Bacon's "Advancement of Learning," Book II: "Because true
Historie representeth Actions and Euents more ordinarie and lesse interchanged, therefore Poesie
endueth them with more Rarenesse and more vnexpected and alternatiue Variations: So as it appeareth
that Poesie serueth and conferreth to Magnanimitie, Moralitie, and to delectation. And therefore
it was euer thought to haue some participation of diuinesse, because it doth raise and erect
the Minde, by submitting the shewes of things to the desires of the Mind, whereas reason doth
buckle and bowe the Mind unto the Nature of things."

To be discarded thence!

Impassioned poetry is an emanation of the moral and intellectual part of our nature. Cf. "On
People of Sense" in "Plain Speaker": "Poetry acts by sympathy with nature, that is, with the
natural impulses, customs, and imaginations of men, and is, on that account, always popular,
delightful, and at the same time instructive. It is nature moralizing and idealizing for us;
inasmuch as, by shewing us things as they are, it implicitly teaches us what they ought to
be; and the grosser feelings, by passing through the strainers of this imaginary, wide-extended
experience, acquire an involuntary tendency to higher objects. Shakspeare was, in this sense,
not only one of the greatest poets, but one of the greatest moralists that we have. Those who
read him are the happier, better, and wiser for it."

Moore, Edward (1712-1757), author of "The Gamester" (1753).

P. 259. As Mr. Burke observes, in "A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of
the Sublime and Beautiful," Part I, Section 15: "Choose a day on which to represent the most
sublime and affecting tragedy we have; appoint the most favourite actors; spare no cost upon
the scenes and decorations; unite the greatest efforts of poetry, painting, and music; and
when you have collected your audience, just at the moment when their minds are erect with expectation,
let it be reported that a state criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in
the adjoining square; in a moment the emptiness of the theatre would demonstrate the comparative
weakness of the imitative arts, and proclaim the triumph of the real sympathy."

Masterless passion. Cf. "Merchant of Venice," iv, 1, 51: "For affection, Mistress of passion,
sways it to the mood," etc.

P. 260. satisfaction to the thought. "Othello," iii, 3, 97.

the "Round Table" with the change of poetic to prophetic. "This couplet occurs in a letter
from Gray to Walpole ('Letters,' ed. Tovey I, 7-8). The lines are apparently a translation

Macbeth ... for the sake of the music. Some copies of the first edition misprint Macheath,
the name of the leading character in Gay's "Beggar's Opera." In writing "On Commonplace Critics,"
in the "Round Table," Hazlitt represents the commonplace critic as questioning whether any
one of Shakespeare's plays, "if brought out now for the first time, would succeed. He thinks
that 'Macbeth' would be the most likely, from the music which has been introduced into it."
The reference is to the music written for D'Avenant's version of the play, produced in 1672.
According to Waller-Glover (I, 436), "this music, traditionally assigned to Matthew Locke,
is now attributed to Purcell"; but Furness, in the Variorum edition of "Macbeth," accepts the
conclusion of Chappell in Grove's "Dictionary of Music," "that Purcell could not have been
the composer of a work which appeared when he was in his fourteenth year," especially as "the
only reason that can be assigned why modern musicians should have doubted Locke's authorship
is that a manuscript of it exists in the handwriting of Henry Purcell."

except poets. Cf. "On the Prose Style of Poets" in the "Plain Speaker": "What is a little extraordinary,
there is a want of rhythmus and cadence in what they write without the help of metrical rules.
Like persons who have been accustomed to sing to music, they are at a loss in the absence of
the habitual accompaniment and guide to their judgment. Their style halts, totters, is loose,
disjointed, and without expressive pauses or rapid movements. The measured cadence and regular
sing-song of rhyme or blank verse have destroyed, as it were, their natural ear for the mere
characteristic harmony which ought to subsist between the sound and the sense. I should almost
guess the Author of Waverley to be a writer of ambling verses from the desultory vacillation
and want of firmness in the march of his style. There is neither momentum nor elasticity in
it; I mean as to the score, or effect upon the ear. He has improved since in his other works:
to be sure, he has had practice enough. Poets either get into this incoherent, undetermined,
shuffling style, made up of 'unpleasing flats and sharps,' of unaccountable starts and pauses,
of doubtful odds and ends, flirted about like straws in a gust of wind; or, to avoid it and
steady themselves, mount into a sustained and measured prose (like the translation of Ossian's
Poems, or some parts of Shaftesbury's Characteristics) which is more odious still, and as bad
as being at sea in a calm." Hazlitt's views on this question are peculiar, though his examples
are well chosen. The more common opinion is that voiced by Coleridge in his remarks "On Style":
"It is, indeed, worthy of remark that all our great poets have been good prose writers, as
Chaucer, Spenser, Milton; and this probably arose from their just sense of metre. For a true
poet will never confound verse and prose; whereas it is almost characteristic of indifferent
prose writers that they should be constantly slipping into scraps of metre." Works, IV, 342.

P. 268. Addison's Campaign (1705), written in honor of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim, was
described as "that gazette in rhyme" by Joseph Warton (1722-1800) in his "Essay on the Writings
and Genius of Pope," I, 29.

Chaucer. Cf. A. W. Pollard's "Chaucer," p. 35: "To Boccaccio's 'Teseide' and 'Filostrato,'
he was indebted for something more than the groundwork of two of his most important poems;
and he was also acquainted with three of his works in Latin prose. If, as is somewhat hardily
maintained, he also knew the Decamerone, and took from it, in however improved a fashion, the
idea of his Canterbury Pilgrimage and the plots of any or all of the four tales (besides that
of Grisilde) to which resemblances have been traced in his own work, his obligations to Boccaccio
become immense. Yet he never mentions his name, and it has been contended that he was himself
unaware of the authorship of the poems and treatises to which he was so greatly indebted."

"Cymon and Iphigenia."

Ossian. James Macpherson (1736-1796) published between 1760 and 1765 what he alleged to be
a translation of the ancient Gaelic hero-bard, Oisin or Ossian. The poems fed the romantic
appetite of the generation and were translated into practically every European language. In
Germany especially the influence of "Ossian" wrought powerfully through the enthusiasm it aroused
in the young Goethe and in Schiller. In England, the poems, immediately upon their appearance,
gave rise to a long controversy as to their authenticity, Dr. Johnson being among the first
to attack the belief in their antiquity. The truth seems to be that, though there really is
a legendary hero answering to Ossian, no such poems as Macpherson attributed to him were ever
transmitted. The whole work is to all intents the original creation of Macpherson himself.
The supposed Gaelic originals, which were published by the Highland Society of London in 1807,
have been proved by philologists to be spurious, to be nothing in fact but translations into
bad Gaelic from Macpherson's good English. This conclusion is further supported by the mass
of borrowings from the Bible and the classics which have been found in "Ossian." See J. C.
Smart: "James Macpherson, An Episode in Literature" (1905).

MY FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH POETS

[The identification of quotations has been omitted for this essay in order to allow students
an opportunity to try it for themselves.]

The third and fourth paragraphs of this essay had appeared in a letter of Hazlitt's to the
Examiner (Works, III, 152). The entire essay was first published in the third number of the
Liberal (see note to p. 244).

P. 277. W--m. Wem.

P. 281. Murillo (1617-1682) and Velasquez (1599-1660) are the two greatest Spanish painters.

nothing--like what he has done. In the essay "On Depth and Superficiality" ("Plain Speaker"),
Hazlitt characterizes Coleridge as "a great but useless thinker."

P. 282. Adam Smith (1723-1790), founder of the science of political economy, author of "The
Wealth of Nations" (1776).

huge folios. In the essay "On Pedantry" ("Round Table") Hazlitt writes: "In the library of
the family where we were brought up, stood the Fratres Poloni; and we can never forget or describe
the feeling with which not only their appearance, but the names of the authors on the outside
inspired us. Pripscovius, we remember, was one of the easiest to pronounce. The gravity of
the contents seemed in proportion to the weight of the volumes; the importance of the subjects
increased with our ignorance of them."

P. 283, n. Hazlitt's father was the author of "Discourses for the Use of Families on the Advantages
of a Free Enquiry and on the Study of the Scriptures" (1790) and of "Sermons for the Use of
Families" in two volumes (1808).

P. 284. Mary Wolstonecraft (1759-1797), author of the "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792).

Mackintosh, Sir James (1765-1832), wrote "Vindiciæ Gallicæ, a Defence of the French Revolution
and its English Admirers against the Accusations of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke." Hazlitt writes
of Mackintosh in the "Spirit of the Age" as "one of the ablest and most accomplished men of
the age, both as a writer, a speaker, and a converser," and comparing him with Coleridge, he
remarks, "They have nearly an equal range of reading and of topics of conversation; but in
the mind of the one we see nothing but fixtures, in the other every thing is fluid."

Tom Wedgwood (1771-1805) was an associate of some of the literary men of his day.

P. 285. Holcroft, Thomas (1745-1809), actor, dramatist, novelist, a member of Godwin's group
of radicals. His chief writings are "The Road to Ruin" (1792), "Anna St. Ives" (1792), and
"Hugh Trevor" (1794-97). Holcroft's "Memoirs," written by himself, were edited and completed
by Hazlitt and published in 1816 (Works, II).

P. 286. Hume, David (1711-1776), historian and sceptic philosopher, described by Hazlitt as
"one of the subtlest and most metaphysical of all metaphysicians." His chief writings are "A
Treatise on Human Nature, being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning
into Moral Subjects" (1739-40), "Philosophical Essays" (1748), "Four Dissertations" (1757).

P. 287. Essay on Vision. Hazlitt calls this "the greatest by far of all his works and the most
complete example of elaborate analytical reasoning and particular induction joined together
that perhaps ever existed." (Works, XI, 108).

Tom Paine (1737-1809), an influential revolutionary writer, author of "Common Sense" (1776),
a pamphlet advocating American independence, "Rights of Man" (1791), a reply to Burke's "Reflections
on the French Revolution," and "The Age of Reason" (1795). He also took an active part in both
the American and French revolutions.

prefer the unknown to the known. Cf. the first essay "On the Conversation of Authors": "Coleridge
withholds his tribute of applause from every person, in whom any mortal but himself can descry
the least glimpse of understanding. He would be thought to look farther into a millstone than
any body else. He would have others see with his eyes, and take their opinions from him on
trust, in spite of their senses. The more obscure and defective the indications of merit, the
greater his sagacity and candour in being the first to point them out. He looks upon what he
nicknames a man of genius, but as the breath of his nostrils, and the clay in the potter's
hands. If any such inert, unconscious mass, under the fostering care of the modern Prometheus,
is kindled into life,--begins to see, speak, and move, so as to attract the notice of other
people,--our jealous patroniser of latent worth in that case throws aside, scorns, and hates
his own handy-work; and deserts his intellectual offspring from the moment they can go alone
and shift for themselves."

a discovery on the same subject. Hazlitt's first publication, "On the Principles of Human Action."

P. 288. I sat down to the task, etc. Cf. "On Application to Study" ("Plain Speaker"): "If what
I write at present is worth nothing, at least it costs me nothing. But it cost me a great deal
twenty years ago. I have added little to my stock since then, and taken little from it. I 'unfold
the book and volume of the brain,' and transcribe the characters I see there as mechanically
as any one might copy the letters in a sampler. I do not say they came there mechanically--I
transfer them to the paper mechanically." See also p. 345.

P. 289. which ... he has somewhere told himself. "Biographia Literaria," ch. 10.

that other Vision of Judgment. Byron's.

Bridge-Street Junto. "The Constitutional Association or, as it was called by its opponents,
'The Bridge Street Gang,' founded in 1821 'to support the laws for suppressing seditious publications,
and for defending the country from the fatal influence of disloyalty and sedition.' The Association
was an ill-conducted party organisation and created so much opposition by its imprudent prosecutions
that it very soon disappeared. See an article in the Edinburgh Review for June, 1822." Waller-Glover,
VI, 487.

P. 290. at Tewkesbury. In the essay "On Going a Journey," Hazlitt refers to this episode as
occurring at Bridgewater: "I remember sitting up half the night to read Paul and Virginia,
which I picked up at an inn in Bridgewater, after being drenched in the rain all day; and at
the same place I got through two volumes of Madame D'Arblay's Camilla."

Paul and Virginia (1788), a sentimental novel by Bernardin St. Pierre (1737-1814).

P. 291. Camilla (1796), a novel by Fanny Burney (1752-1840).

a friend of the poet's. "This is a mistake. Wordsworth paid £23 a year for Alfoxden. The agreement
is given in Mrs. Henry Sandford's 'Thomas Poole and His Friends,' I, 225." Waller-Glover.

P. 292. In the outset of life. Alongside of this paragraph should be read the essay "On the
Feeling of Immortality in Youth," Works, XII, 150.

P. 294. Chantrey, Sir Francis (1781-1842). His bust of Wordsworth is now at Cole-Orton.

Haydon, Benjamin Robert (1786-1846), a celebrated English painter who was intimate with many
literary men. In the picture referred to Haydon also introduced a portrait of Hazlitt.

Monk Lewis. Matthew Gregory Lewis (1775-1818) wrote among other things a sensational novel,
"The Monk" (1795), which gained him his nickname. "The Castle Spectre" was originally produced
at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1797.

P. 295. Tom Poole (1765-1837), friend and patron of Coleridge.

P. 296. Sir Walter Scott's, etc. Probably a reference to the banquet given to George IV by
the Magistrates of Edinburgh and attended by Scott, August 24, 1822.

Blackwood, William (1776-1834), the Edinburgh publisher.

Gaspar Poussin (1613-1675). His real name was Dughet, but he changed it out of respect to his
brother-in-law, Nicholas Poussin.

Domenichino or Domenico Zampieri (1581-1641), a painter of Bologna.

P. 297. Death of Abel (1758), an idyllic-pastoral poem by Solomon Gessner (1730-1788), a German
poet of the Swiss school who enjoyed a wide popularity in the eighteenth century.

P. 298. since the days of Henry II. As Henry II lived in the twelfth century, and as neither
Coleridge nor Wordsworth ever refer to the language of Henry II as their standard, the statement
in the text may probably be considered as a blunder of Hazlitt's.

He spoke with contempt of Gray and with intolerance of Pope. Cf. "Biographia Literaria," ch.
2: "I felt almost as if I had been newly couched, when, by Mr. Wordsworth's conversation, I
had been induced to re-examine with impartial strictness Gray's celebrated Elegy. I had long
before detected the defects in The Bard; but the Elegy I had considered as proof against all
fair attacks; and to this day I can not read either without delight, and a portion of enthusiasm.
At all events whatever pleasure I may have lost by the clearer perception of the faults in
certain passages, has been more than repaid to me by the additional delight with which I read
the remainder." In his "Table Talk," October 23, 1833, Coleridge says again: "I think there
is something very majestic in Gray's Installation Ode; but as to the Bard and the rest of his
lyrics, I must say I think them frigid and artificial." Of Pope and his followers he writes
("Biographia Literaria," ch. 1): "I was not blind to the merits of this school, yet, as from
inexperience of the world, and consequent want of sympathy with the general subjects of these
poems, they gave me little pleasure, I doubtless undervalued the kind, and with the presumption
of youth withheld from its masters the legitimate name of poets. I saw that the excellence
of this kind consisted in just and acute observations on men and manners in an artificial state
of society, as its matter and substance, and in the logic of wit, conveyed in smooth and strong
epigrammatic couplets, as its form; that even when the subject was addressed to the fancy,
or the intellect, as in the Rape of the Lock, or the Essay on Man; nay, when it was a consecutive
narration, as in that astonishing product of matchless talent and ingenuity, Pope's Translation
of the Iliad; still a point was looked for at the end of each second line, and the whole was,
as it were, a sorites, or, if I may exchange a logical for a grammatical metaphor, a conjunction
disjunctive, of epigrams. Meantime, the matter and diction seemed to me characterized not so
much by poetic thoughts, as by thoughts translated into the language of poetry."

he thought little of Junius as a writer. Cf. Coleridge's "Table Talk," July 3, 1833: "The style
of Junius is a sort of metre, the law of which is a balance of thesis and antithesis. When
he gets out of his aphorismic metre into a sentence of five or six lines long, nothing can
exceed the slovenliness of the English."

dislike for Dr. Johnson. Cf. "Table Talk," July 4, 1833: "Dr. Johnson's fame now rests principally
upon Boswell. It is impossible not to be amused with such a book. But his bow-wow manner must
have had a good deal to do with the effect produced.... As to Burke's testimony to Johnson's
powers, you must remember that Burke was a great courtier; and after all, Burke said and wrote
more than once that he thought Johnson greater in talking than in writing, and greater in Boswell
than in real life."

opinion of Burke. Cf. "Table Talk," April 8, 1833: "Burke was indeed a great man. No one ever
read history so philosophically as he seems to have done.... He would have been more influential
if he had less surpassed his contemporaries, as Fox and Pitt, men of much inferior minds, in
all respects."

He liked Richardson, but not Fielding. On this subject Coleridge evidently changed his mind.
Cf. "Table Talk," July 5, 1834: "What a master of composition Fielding was! And how charming,
how wholesome, Fielding always is! To take him up after Richardson is like emerging from a
sickroom heated by stoves into an open lawn on a breezy day in May."

Caleb Williams, the chief novel of William Godwin.

P. 298, n. He had no idea of pictures. See p. 212.

ON THE CONVERSATION OF AUTHORS

This is the title of Essays III and IV of the "Plain Speaker." Our selection begins with the
last paragraph of the first, which forms a fitting introduction to the account of one of Lamb's
celebrated Wednesday evenings. Lamb tells us that his sister was accustomed to read this essay
with unmixed delight.

P. 301. When Greek meets Greek. Nathaniel Lee's "Alexander the Great," iv, 2.

C----. Coleridge.

P. 302. small-coal man. Thomas Britton (1654?-1714), a dealer in small coal, who on the floor
of his hut above the coal-shop held weekly concerts of vocal and instrumental music, at which
the greatest performers of the day, even Handel, were to be heard.

And, in our flowing cups. Cf. "Henry V," iv, 3, 51:

                      "then shall our names
  Familiar in his mouth as household words ...
  Be in their flowing cups freely remember'd."

P. 303. the cartoons. See Hazlitt's account of Raphael's cartoons in "The Pictures at Hampton
Court" (Works, IX, 43).

Donne, John (1573-1631), poet and divine. Hazlitt in the "Lectures on the English Poets" confesses
that he knows nothing of him save "some beautiful verses to his wife, dissuading her from accompanying
him on his travels abroad (see p. 318), and some quaint riddles in verse, which the Sphinx
could not unravel." V, 83.

P. 304. Ned P----. Edward Phillips. Lamb speaks of him as "that poor card-playing Phillips,
that has felt himself for so many years the outcast of Fortune." (Works, ed. Lucas, VII, 972.)

Captain ----. Rear-Admiral James Burney (1750-1821), brother of Fanny Burney the novelist,
author of a "Chronological History of the Voyages and Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific
Ocean" in five volumes (1803-1817). "The captain was himself a character, a fine, noble creature--gentle,
with a rough exterior, as became the associate of Captain Cook in his voyages round the world,
and the literary historian of all these acts of circumnavigation." Crabb-Robinson's Diary, 1810.

Jem White. James White (1775-1820), of whom Lamb has left us a sketch in the essay "On the
Praise of Chimney-Sweepers": "He carried away half the fun of the world when he died." He wrote,
it is supposed with some cooperation from Lamb, the "Original Letters, etc., of Sir John Falstaff
and his Friends" (1796), which were described by Lamb as "without exception the best imitations
I ever saw." (Works, ed. Lucas, VI, 2.) A review of this book by Lamb, consisting chiefly of
specimens, appeared in the Examiner in 1819 (Works, ed. Lucas, I, 191 ff).

turning like the latter end. This phrase occurs in one of the extracts in Lamb's review of
Falstaff's Letters just mentioned (p. 194).

A----. William Aryton (1777-1858), a musical critic and director of the King's Theatre in the
Haymarket. In the letter of Elia to Robert Southey (Lamb's Works, I, 230) he is spoken of as
"the last and steadiest left me of that little knot of whist-players, that used to assemble
weekly, for so many years, at the Queen's Gate."

Mrs. R-----. Mrs. Reynolds, who had been Lamb's schoolmistress.

M. B. Martin Charles Burney, son of Admiral Burney. "Martin Burney is as odd as ever.... He
came down here, and insisted on reading Virgil's 'Æneid' all through with me (which he did,)
because a Counsel must know Latin. Another time he read out all the Gospel of St. John, because
Biblical quotations are very emphatic in a Court of Justice. A third time, he would carve a
fowl, which he did very ill-favoredly, because 'we did not know how indispensable it was for
a Barrister to do all those sort of things well. Those little things were of more consequence
than we supposed.' So he goes on, harassing about the way to prosperity, and losing it. With
a long head, but somewhat wrong one--harum-scarum. Why does not his guardian angel look to
him? He deserves one--: may be, he has tired him out." Lamb's Works, VII, 855.

Author of the Road to Ruin. Thomas Holcroft.

P. 305. Critique of Pure Reason, by Kant.

Biographia Literaria. Coleridge's account of his literary life, published in 1817.

Those days are over! The event here referred to may be Waterloo. Mr. Lucas thinks that Hazlitt's
share in Lamb's gatherings "ceased after an unfortunate discussion of Fanny Burney's Wanderer,
which Hazlitt condemned in terms that her brother, the Admiral, could not forgive." (Lamb's
Works, I, 482.) It is likely that Mr. Lucas has been led astray by the statement in Crabb-Robinson's
Diary to the effect that Hazlitt used to attend Captain Burney's whist-parties "till he affronted
the Captain by severe criticisms on the works of his sister," presumably by his article in
the Edinburgh Review in 1814. Hazlitt commemorates Lamb's evenings in the "Pleasure of Hating"
("Plain Speaker"): "What is become of 'that set of whist players,' celebrated by Elia in his
notable Epistle to Robert Southey, Esq. ... 'that for so many years called Admiral Burney friend?'
They are scattered, like last year's snow. Some of them are dead--or gone to live at a distance--or
pass one another in the street like strangers; or if they stop to speak, do it as coolly and
try to cut one another as soon as possible. Some of us have grown rich--others poor. Some have
got places under Government--others a niche in the Quarterly Review. Some of us have dearly
earned a name in the world; whilst others remain in their original privacy. We despise the
one, and envy and are glad to mortify the other."

Like angels' visits. Cf. Blair's "The Grave," 582: "Like those of angels, short and far between."
Hazlitt was fond of pointing out this source for Campbell's famous line "Like angels' visits
few and far between," and of insisting that the alteration spoiled the sense. Thereby he is
said to have incurred Campbell's bitter hostility.

P. 306. Mr. Douce, Francis (1757-1834), Shakespearian scholar and keeper of the manuscripts
in the British Museum.

L. H----. Leigh Hunt. There is a sketch of him in the "Spirit of the Age."

aliquando sufflaminandus erat. "He sometimes had to be checked." This is a quotation from Seneca
which Ben Jonson in "Timber" (ed. Schelling, p. 23) had applied to Shakespeare.

P. 307. The Indicator. Leigh Hunt's most successful series of essays, which began their run
in 1819.

Mr. Northcote, James (1746-1831), the painter of whose talk Hazlitt has left an entertaining
record in the "Conversations of James Northcote" (1830), a book which inspired Crabb-Robinson
to say, "I do not believe that Boswell gives so much good talk in an equal quantity of his
life of Johnson."

P. 308. Sir Joshua's. Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), the famous English painter.

P. 309. Horne Tooke (1736-1812), politician and author of a celebrated philological volume,
"The Diversions of Purley" (1786, 1805). His portrait is included in the "Spirit of the Age":
"He was without a rival (almost) in private conversation, an expert public speaker, a keen
politician, a first-rate grammarian, and the finest gentleman (to say the least) of his own
party. He had no imagination (or he would not have scorned it!)--no delicacy of taste, no rooted
prejudices or strong attachments: his intellect was like a bow of polished steel, from which
he shot sharp-pointed poisoned arrows at his friends in private, at his enemies in public."

P. 310. silenced a learned professor. Cf. "Spirit of the Age": "He used to plague Fuseli by
asking him after the origin of the Teutonic dialects, and Dr. Parr, by wishing to know the
meaning of the common copulative, Is."

Curran, John Philpot (1750-1817), member of Parliament from Ireland, orator and wit.

P. 311. Mrs. Inchbald, Elizabeth (1753-1821), a well-known actress, dramatist, and novelist.
In literature she is associated with the group of William Godwin, and her best-known works
are "A Simple Story" and "Nature and Art."

Mrs. M----. Mrs. Montagu, wife of Basil Montagu. In the "Pleasure of Hating" ("Plain Speaker")
there is another allusion to Mrs. Montagu "whose dark raven locks made a picturesque background
to our discourse."

bodie's, and god bless him, any bodie's as good as his own, for I do not think he has the most
distant guess of the possibility of one poem being better than another. The Gods by denying
him the very faculty itself of discrimination have effectually cut off every seed of envy in
his bosom." Letter to Wordsworth (Lamb's Works, ed. Lucas, VI, 519).

This, like the preceding essay, is a record of one of Lamb's Wednesday evenings. It was originally
published in the New Monthly Magazine for January, 1826, from which the present text is reproduced.
It was republished by Hazlitt's son in "Literary Remains" (1836) and "Winterslow" (1850).

Kit Marlowe (1564-1593), the most brilliant writer of tragedy before Shakespeare. He wrote
"Tamburlaine the Great," "The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus," "The Jew of Malta," and "Edward
the Second." In the "Age of Elizabeth" Hazlitt says of him, "There is a lust of power in his
writings, a hunger and thirst after unrighteousness, a glow of the imagination, unhallowed
by any thing but its own energies."

Webster, John, wrote during the first quarter of the seventeenth century. His chief plays are
"The White Devil" and the "Duchess of Malfy." Dekker, Thomas (c. 1570-1641). "The Shoemaker's
Holiday," "The Honest Whore," and "Old Fortunatus" are his best plays. In the third lecture
of the "Age of Elizabeth" Hazlitt thus compares Webster and Dekker: "Webster would, I think,
be a greater dramatic genius than Deckar, if he had the same originality; and perhaps is so,
even without it. His White Devil and Duchess of Malfy, upon the whole perhaps, come the nearest
to Shakspeare of anything we have upon record; the only drawback to them, the only shade of
imputation that can be thrown upon them, 'by which they lose some colour,' is, that they are
too like Shakspeare, and often direct imitations of him, both in general conception and individual
expression.... Deckar has, I think, more truth of character, more instinctive depth of sentiment,
more of the unconscious simplicity of nature; but he does not, out of his own stores, clothe
his subject with the same richness of imagination, or the same glowing colours of language.
Deckar excels in giving expression to certain habitual, deeply-rooted feelings, which remain
pretty much the same in all circumstances, the simple uncompounded elements of nature and passion:--Webster
gives more scope to their various combinations and changeable aspects, brings them into dramatic
play by contrast and comparison, flings them into a state of fusion by a kindled fancy, makes
them describe a wider arc of oscillation from the impulse of unbridled passion, and carries
both terror and pity to a more painful and sometimes unwarrantable excess. Deckar is content
with the historic picture of suffering; Webster goes on to suggest horrible imaginings. The
pathos of the one tells home and for itself; the other adorns his sentiments with some image
of tender or awful beauty. In a word, Deckar is more like Chaucer or Boccaccio; as Webster's
mind appears to have been cast more in the mould of Shakespeare's, as well naturally as from
studious emulation."

Heywood, Thomas (d. c. 1650), a prolific dramatist who excelled in the homely vein. His best-known
play is "The Woman Killed with Kindness."

Beaumont, Francis (1584-1616), and Fletcher, John (1579-1625), composed their dramas in collaboration.
In the "Age of Elizabeth" Hazlitt calls them lyric and descriptive poets of the first order,
but as regards drama "the first writers who in some measure departed from the genuine tragic
style of the age of Shakspeare. They thought less of their subject, and more of themselves,
than some others. They had a great and unquestioned command over the stores both of fancy and
passion; but they availed themselves too often of commonplace extravagances and theatrical
trick.... The example of preceding or contemporary writers had given them facility; the frequency
of dramatic exhibition had advanced the popular taste; and this facility of production, and
the necessity for appealing to popular applause, tended to vitiate their own taste, and to
make them willing to pamper that of the public for novelty and extraordinary effect. There
wants something of the sincerity and modesty of the older writers. They do not wait nature's
time, or work out her materials patiently and faithfully, but try to anticipate her, and so
far defeat themselves. They would have a catastrophe in every scene; so that you have none
at last: they would raise admiration to its height in every line; so that the impression of
the whole is comparatively loose and desultory. They pitch the characters at first in too high
a key, and exhaust themselves by the eagerness and impatience of their efforts. We find all
the prodigality of youth, the confidence inspired by success, an enthusiasm bordering on extravagance,
richness running riot, beauty dissolving in its own sweetness. They are like heirs just come
to their estates, like lovers in the honeymoon. In the economy of nature's gifts, they 'misuse
the bounteous Pan, and thank the Gods amiss.' Their productions shoot up in haste, but bear
the marks of precocity and premature decay. Or they are two goodly trees, the stateliest of
the forest, crowned with blossoms, and with the verdure springing at their feet; but they do
not strike their roots far enough into the ground, and the fruit can hardly ripen for the flowers!"

Jonson, Ben (1573-1637), was the originator of the "comedy of humors." Hazlitt, in discussing
him at length in the second lecture on the "Comic Writers," confesses a disrelish for his style.
"He was a great man in himself, but one cannot readily sympathise with him. His works, as the
characteristic productions of an individual mind, or as records of the manners of a particular
age, cannot be valued too highly; but they have little charm for the mere general reader. Schlegel
observes, that whereas Shakspeare gives the springs of human nature, which are always the same,
or sufficiently so to be interesting and intelligible; Jonson chiefly gives the humours of
men, as connected with certain arbitrary and conventional modes of dress, action, and expression,
which are intelligible only while they last, and not very interesting at any time. Shakspeare's
characters are men; Ben Jonson's are more like machines, governed by mere routine, or by the
convenience of the poet, whose property they are.... His portraits are caricatures by dint
of their very likeness, being extravagant tautologies of themselves; as his plots are improbable
by an excess of consistency; for he goes thoroughstitch with whatever he takes in hand, makes
one contrivance answer all purposes, and every obstacle give way to a predetermined theory....
Old Ben was of a scholastic turn and had dealt a little in the occult sciences and controversial
divinity. He was a man of strong crabbed sense, retentive memory, acute observation, great
fidelity of description and keeping in character, a power of working out an idea so as to make
it painfully true and oppressive, and with great honesty and manliness of feeling, as well
as directness of understanding: but with all this, he wanted, to my thinking, that genial spirit
of enjoyment and finer fancy, which constitute the essence of poetry and wit.... There was
nothing spontaneous, no impulse or ease about his genius: it was all forced, up-hill work,
making a toil of pleasure. And hence his overweening admiration of his own works, from the
effort they had cost him, and the apprehension that they were not proportionably admired by
others, who knew nothing of the pangs and throes of his Muse in child-bearing." Works, VIII,
39-41. Of Ben Jonson's tragedies Hazlitt held a higher opinion than of his comedies. "The richer
the soil in which he labours, the less dross and rubbish we have.... His tenaciousness of what
is grand and lofty, is more praiseworthy than his delight in what is low and disagreeable.
His pedantry accords better with didactic pomp than with illiterate and vulgar gabble; his
learning engrafted on romantic tradition or classical history, looks like genius.... His tragedy
of the Fall of Sejanus, in particular, is an admirable piece of ancient mosaic.... The depth
of knowledge and gravity of expression sustain one another throughout: the poet has worked
out the historian's outline, so that the vices and passions, the ambition and servility of
public men, in the heated and poisonous atmosphere of a luxurious and despotic court, were
never described in fuller or more glowing colours." Works, V, 262-3.

a vast species alone. Cowley's "The Praise of Pindar."

G----. Godwin, according to "Literary Remains."

Drummond of Hawthornden. William Drummond (1585-1649), the poet who recorded his conversation
with Ben Jonson on the occasion of a visit paid to him by the latter in 1618. "He has not done
himself or Jonson any credit by his account of their conversation," says Hazlitt in the "Lectures
on the Age of Elizabeth." Works, V, 299.

Eugene Aram was hanged in 1759 for a murder he had committed several years earlier.

Admirable Crichton. James Crichton (1560?-1582), a Scotchman of noble birth who, in a brief
life, gained the reputation of universal genius and concerning whose powers many legends arose.

P. 327. H----. Hunt, according to "Literary Remains."

Hobbes, Thomas (1588-1679), the English philosopher. His chief work is "Leviathan, or the Matter,
Form, and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil" (1651). Hazlitt vindicated the
superiority of Hobbes as a thinker at a time when his fame was overshadowed by other reputations.
He calls him the founder of the modern material philosophy and maintains that "the true reason
of the fate which this author's writings met with was that his views of things were too original
and comprehensive to be immediately understood, without passing through the hands of several
successive generations of commentators and interpreters. Ignorance of another's meaning is
a sufficient cause of fear, and fear produces hatred." Works, XI, 25-48.

Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758). In writing "On the Tendency of Sects" in the "Round Table," Hazlitt
had alluded to Edwards as an Englishman and had spoken of his work on the Will as "written
with as much power of logic, and more in the true spirit of philosophy, than any other metaphysical
work in the language."

P. 327, n. Lord Bacon, Francis (1561-1626), statesman, scientist, and man of letters. His chief
works are the "Essays" (1597), the "Advancement of Learning" (1604), "Novum Organum" (1620),
"History of Henry VII" (1622).

P. 328. Dugald Stewart (1753-1828), Scotch philosopher.

Duchess of Bolton. Lavinia Fenton (1708-1760), the original Polly in Gay's "Beggar's Opera,"
married the Duke of Bolton in 1751.

P. 329. Raphael, Sanzio (1483-1520), the greatest of all the Italian painters.

Lucretia Borgia with calm golden locks. This sounds like a striking anticipation of Landor's
fine line, "Calm hair meandering in pellucid gold" in his poem "On Lucretia Borgia's Hair."
Or had Hazlitt seen the poem before it was published?

Michael Angelo (1475-1564), poet, painter, architect, and sculptor, the most famous of the
great Italian artists.

Correggio (1494-1534), Giorgione (1477-1510), Guido (1575-1642), Cimabue (1240-1302), Vandyke
(1599-1641). The other painters are mentioned elsewhere in this volume.

whose names on earth. In his review of Sismondi's "Literature of the South" (Works, X, 62)
Hazlitt cites among the proofs of Dante's poetic power "his description of the poets and great
men of antiquity, whom he represents 'serene and smiling,' though in the shades of death, 'because
on earth their names in fame's eternal records shine for aye.'" As these lines have not been
located in Dante, they have been ascribed to the lying memory of Lamb, from whose lips Hazlitt
learned them.

P. 330. Mrs. Hutchinson, Lucy (b. 1620), whose life of her Puritan husband, Colonel Hutchinson,
had appeared in 1806, presumably shortly before the conversation recorded in this essay.

one in the room. Mary Lamb, the sister of the essayist.

Ninon de Lenclos (1615-1705), for a long time the leader of fashion in Paris and the patroness
of poets.

Voltaire (1694-1778), the sceptical philosopher of the Enlightenment; Rabelais (1490-1553),
the greatest French humorist, author of "Gargantua and Pantagruel"; Molière (1622-1673), the
master of French comedy; Racine (1639-1699), the master of French classic tragedy; La Fontaine
(1621-1695), author of the "Fables"; La Rochefoucauld (1613-1680), celebrated for his book
of cynical "Maxims" which Hazlitt imitated in his "Characteristics"; St. Evremont (1610-1703),
a critic.

P. 331. Your most exquisite reason. Cf. "Twelfth Night," ii, 3, 155.

Oh, ever right. "Coriolanus," ii, 1, 208.

H----. This speech is attributed to Lamb in "Literary Remains," but wrongly so according to
Waller and Glover "because, in the first place, the speech seems more characteristic of Hunt
than of Lamb, and, secondly, because the volume of the New Monthly in which the essay appeared
contains a list of errata in which two corrections (one of them relating to initials) are made
in the essay and yet this 'H----' is left uncorrected."

ON READING OLD BOOKS

This essay was first published in the London Magazine for February, 1821, and republished in
the "Plain Speaker."

P. 333. I hate to read new books. It would take too long to recall all the passages in which
Hazlitt voices his sentimental attachment to the writers with whom he first became acquainted.
"The greatest pleasure in life," he says in one essay, "is that of reading when we are young,"
and at the conclusion of his lectures on the "Age of Elizabeth" he remarks: "Were I to live
much longer than I have any chance of doing, the books which I read when I was young, I can
never forget." Patmore's statement concerning Hazlitt's later reading may be exaggerated, but
it is interesting in this connection: "I do not believe Hazlitt ever read the half of any work
that he reviewed--not even the Scotch novels, of which he read more than of any other modern
productions, and has written better perhaps, than any other of their critics. I am certain
that of many works that he has reviewed, and of many writers whose general pretensions he has
estimated better than anybody else has done, he never read one tithe." "My Friends and Acquaintances,"
III, 122.

Lady Morgan (1783?-1859), a writer of Irish stories, of which the best-known is "The Wild Irish
Girl" (1806). She is also the author of certain miscellaneous productions, among which is a

276-310.

writes of her in the lecture "On the English Novelists."

and educational systems of the nineteenth. His other important works are "The Social Contract"
and "Émile" (1762) and the "Confessions" (1782). Hazlitt has a "Character of Rousseau" in the

Name of Barry Cornwall."

P. 341. Keats. Hazlitt shared the popular conception of Keats as an effeminate poet. He concludes
the essay "On Effeminacy of Character" in "Table Talk" with a reference to Keats: "I cannot
help thinking that the fault of Mr. Keats's poems was a deficiency in masculine energy of style.
He had beauty, tenderness, delicacy, in an uncommon degree, but there was a want of strength
and substance. His Endymion is a very delightful description of the illusions of a youthful
imagination, given up to airy dreams--we have flowers, clouds, rainbows, moonlight, all sweet
sounds and smells, and Oreads and Dryads flitting by--but there is nothing tangible in it,
nothing marked or palpable--we have none of the hardy spirit or rigid forms of antiquity. He
painted his own thoughts and character; and did not transport himself into the fabulous and
heroic ages. There is a want of action, of character, and so far, of imagination, but there
is exquisite fancy. All is soft and fleshy, without bone or muscle. We see in him the youth,
without the manhood of poetry. His genius breathed 'vernal delight and joy.'--'Like Maia's
son he stood and shook his plumes,' with fragrance filled. His mind was redolent of spring.
He had not the fierceness of summer, nor the richness of autumn, and winter he seemed not to
have known, till he felt the icy hand of death!" Again in the introduction to the "Select British
Poets" (Works, V, 378), he says that Keats "gave the greatest promise of genius of any poet
of his day. He displayed extreme tenderness, beauty, originality, and delicacy of fancy; all
he wanted was manly strength and fortitude to reject the temptations of singularity in sentiment
and expression. Some of his shorter and later pieces are, however, as free from faults as they
are full of beauties."

An Essay on Marriage. "No such essay by Wordsworth is at present known to exist. It would seem
either that 'Marriage' is a misprint for some other word, or that Hazlitt was mistaken in the
subject of the essay referred to by Coleridge. Hazlitt is probably recalling a conversation
with Coleridge in Shropshire at the beginning of 1798 (cf. 'My First Acquaintance with Poets'),
at which time A Letter to the Bishop of Llandaff (1793) was the only notable prose work which
Wordsworth had published." Waller-Glover.
