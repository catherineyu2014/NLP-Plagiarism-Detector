About 150 years since, there was in France one Captain Coney, a gallant gentleman of ancient
extraction, and Governor of Coney Castle. Hereupon Captain Coney quitted France in discontent,
and went to the wars in Hungary against the Turks, where he received a mortal wound, near Buda.
The old servant did as his master had commanded him, and so went to France; and coming one
day to Monsieur Fayel's house, he suddenly met him with one of his servants, who knowing him
to be Captain Coney's servant, examined him; and finding him timorous, and to falter in his
speech, he searched him, and found the said box in his pocket, with the note which expressed
what it contained; then he dismissed the bearer, with injunction that he should come no more
thither. She then went to bed, where in the morning she was found dead.

A Singing Paganini.--In the year 1760, La Paganini, an admirable singer and actress, came to
London from Berlin. Her reputation was so great, that when she had her benefit at the Opera,
such a crowd assembled as was never before witnessed on a like occasion, not one third of the
company that presented themselves at the Opera House doors being able to obtain admission.
Caps were lost, and gowns torn to pieces, without number or mercy, in the struggle to get in.
Ladies in full dress, who had sent away their servants and carriages were obliged to appear
in the streets, and walk home in great numbers without caps or attendants. Luckily the weather
was fine, and did not add to their distress by rain or wind, though their confusion was greatly
augmented by its being broad daylight, and the streets full of spectators, who (says her biographer)
could neither refrain from looking nor laughing at such splendid and uncommon street-walkers.

The old Teutonic word rick is still preserved in the termination of our English bishoprick.

has the kingrick in her own power."--Notes to Pennie's Britain's Historical Drama.

On Friendship.

  "I love a friend that's frank and just,
  To whom a tale I can entrust,
  But when a man's to slander given,
  From such a friend protect me heaven."

Sea Coal.--In the reign of Edward the First, dyers and brewers began to use sea coal. In consequence
of an application from the nobility, &c. he published a proclamation against it, as a public
nuisance. And afterwards, under a commission of Oyer and Terminer, the commission ordered that
all who had "contumaceously" disobeyed the proclamation, should be punished by "pecuniary mulcts."

Witty Optics.--A Jew went into a coffee-house to offer some spectacles for sale: one of the
company, after trying several pairs, wishing to amuse himself at the Jew's expense, exclaimed,
"Oh, these suit me very well; I see through them very well, and through you too, friend, and
discern that you are a rogue." The Jew taking them from him and clapping them on his own nose,
very composedly replied, "then our eyes are alike, for I see that you are the same."
