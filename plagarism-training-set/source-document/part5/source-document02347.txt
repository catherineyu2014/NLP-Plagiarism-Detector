                                 PREFACE.

The letters of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford, as hitherto published, have consisted of,-

1. The letters contained in the quarto edition of his works, published in the year 1798.

2. His letters to George Montagu, Esq. from 1738 to 1770, which formed one quarto volume, published
in 1818.

3. His letters to the Rev.  William Cole and others, from 1745 to 1782, published in the same
form and year.

4. His letters to the Earl of Hertford, during his lordship's embassy to Paris, and also to
the Rev.  Henry Zouch, which appeared in quarto, in 1825.

And 5. His letters to Sir Horace Mann, British Envoy at the Court of Tuscany, from 1741 to
1760, first published in 1833, in three volumes octavo, from the originals in the possession
of the Earl of Waldegrave; edited by Lord Dover, with an original memoir of the author.

To the above are now added several hundred letters, which have hitherto existed Only in manuscript,
or made their appearance singly and incidentally in other works.  In this new collection, besides
the letters to Miss Berry, are some to the Hon.  H. S. Conway, and John Chute, Esq. omitted
In former editions; and many to Lady Suffolk, his brother-in-law, Charles Churchill, Esq.,
Captain Jephson, Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, the Earl of Buchan, the Earl of Charlemont,
Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham, George Hardinge, Esq., Mr. Pinkerton, and
other distinguished characters.  The letters to the Rev. William Cole have been carefully examined
with the originals, and many explanatory notes added, from the manuscript collections of that
indefatigable antiquary, deposited in the British museum.

Besides being the only complete edition ever published of the incomparable letters of this
"prince of epistolary writers," as he has been designated by an eminent critic, the present
work possesses the further advantage of exhibiting the letters themselves in chronological
order.  Thus the whole series forms a lively and most interesting commentary on the events
of the age, as well as a record of the most important transactions, invaluable to the historian
and politician, from 1735 to 1797-a period of more than sixty years.

To Lord Dover's description of these letters (1) little need be added.  Of Horace Walpole it
is not too much to say, that he knew more of the Courts of George I., George II., and George
III., during the early years of the last monarch, than any other individual; and, though he
lived to an extreme age, the perpetual youthfulness of his disposition rendered him as lively
a chronicler when advanced in life, as when his brilliant career commenced.  It is to this
unceasing spring, this unfading juvenility of spirit, that the world is indebted for the gay
colours with which Walpole invests every thing he touches.  If the irresistible court beauties-the
Gunnings, the Lepels, and others-have been compelled, after their hundred conquests, to yield
to the ungallant liberties of Time, and to Death, the rude destroyer, it is a delight to us
to know that their charms are destined to bloom for ever in the sparkling graces of the patrician
letter-writer.  In his epistles are to be seen, even in more vivid tints than those of Watteau,
these splendid creatures in all the pride of their beauty and of their wardrobe, pluming themselves
as if they never could grow old, and casting around them their piercing glances and no less
poignant raillery.  But Horace Walpole is not content with thus displaying his dazzling bevy
of heroines; he reveals them in their less ostentatious moments, and makes us as familiar with
their weaknesses as with the despotic power of their beauty.  Nothing that transpired in the
great world escaped his knowledge, nor the trenchant sallies of his wit, rendered the more
cutting by his unrivalled talent as a raconteur.  Whatever he observed found its way into his
letters, and thus is formed a more perfect narrative of the Curt-of its intrigues, political
and otherwise-of the manoeuvres of statesmen, the cabals of party, and of private society among
the illustrious and the fashionable of the last century, at home and on the continent-than
can elsewhere be obtained.  And how piquant are his disclosures!  how much of actual truth
do they contain! how perfectly, in his anecdotes, are to be traced the hidden and often trivial
sources of some of the most important public events!

As a suitable introduction, prefixed to the whole collection of letters, are the author's admirable
"Reminiscences of the Courts of George the First and Second," which were first narrated to,
and, in 1788, written for the amusement of Miss Mary and Miss Agnes Berry.  To the former of
these ladies the public is indebted for a curious commentary on the Reminiscences, contained
in extracts from the letters of Sarah Duchess of Marlborough, to the Earl of Stair, now first
published from the original manuscripts.  Of the Reminiscences themselves it has been truly
observed, that, both in manner and matter, they are the very perfection of anecdote writing,
and make us better acquainted with the manners of George the First and Second and their Courts,
than we should be after perusing a hundred heavy historians.

Of the most valuable of all Walpole's correspondence-his letters to Sir Horace Mann-the history
will appear in the following Preface to that work, from the pen of the lamented editor, the
late Lord Dover:-

"In the Preface to the 'Memoires of the last Ten Years of the Reign of George II. by Horace
Walpole, Earl of Orford,' published in the year 1822, is the following statement:-

"'Among the papers found at Strawberry Hill, after the death of Lord Orford, was the following
memorandum, wrapped in an envelope, on which was written, Not to be opened till after my will."

"'In my library at Strawberry Hill are two wainscot chests or boxes, the larger marked with
an A, the lesser with a B:- I desire, that as soon as I am dead, my executor and executrix
will cord up strongly, and sell the larger box, marked A, and deliver it to the Honourable
Hugh Conway Seymour, to be kept by him unopened and unsealed till the eldest son of Lady Waldegrave,
or whichever of her sons, being Earl of Waldegrave, shall attain the age of twenty-five years;
when the said chest, with whatever it contains, shall be delivered to him for his own.  And
I beg that the Honourable Hugh Conway Seymour, when be shall receive the said chest, will give
a promise in writing, signed by him, to Lady Waldegrave, that he or his representatives will
deliver the said chest, unopened and unsealed, by my executor and executrix, to the first son
of Lady Waldegrave who shall attain the age of' twenty-five years.  The key of the said chest
is in one of the cupboards of the green closet, within the blue breakfast room, at Strawberry
Hill; and that key, I desire, may be delivered to Laura, Lady Waldegrave, to be kept by her
till her son shall receive the chest.' "'March 21st, 1790.'"

(Signed) HON. HORACE WALPOLE, EARL OF ORFORD.' Aug. 19, 1796.'

"In obedience to these directions, the box described in the preceding memorandum was corded
an(] sealed with the seals of the Honourable Mrs. Damer and the late Lord Frederick Campbell,
the executrix and executor of Lord Orford, and by them delivered to the late Lord Hugh Seymour,
by whose representatives it was given up, unopened and unsealed, to the present Earl of Waldegrave,
when he attained the age of twenty-five.  On examining the box, it was found to contain a number
of manuscript volumes and other papers, among which were the Memoires now published.' "

"The correspondence of Horace Walpole with Sir Horace Mann,
now first published, was also contained in the same box.  It
appears that Walpole, after the death of Sir Horace, became
again the possessor of his own letters.  He had them copied
very carefully in three volumes, and annotated them with short
notes, explanatory of the persons mentioned in them, with an
evident view to their eventual publication.
 "It is from these volumes that the present publication is
taken.  The notes of the author have also been printed
verbatim.  As, however, in the period of time which has
elapsed since Walpole's death, many of the personages
mentioned in the letters, whom he appears to have thought
sufficiently conspicuous not to need remark, have become
almost forgotten, the Editor has deemed it necessary to add,
as shortly as possible, some account of them; and he has taken
care, whenever he has done so, to distinguish his notes from
those of the original author, by the letter D. placed at the
end of them.

"This correspondence is perhaps the most interesting one of Walpole's that has as yet appeared;
as, in addition to his usual merit as a letter-writer, and the advantage of great ease, which
his extreme intimacy with Sir Horace Mann gives to his style, the letters to him are the most
uninterrupted series which has thus far been offered to the public.  They are also the only
letters of Walpole which give an account of that very curious period when his father, Sir Robert
Walpole, left office.  In his letters hitherto published, there is a great gap at this epoch;
probably in consequence of his other correspondents being at the time either in or near London.
A Single letter to Mr. Conway, dated 'london, 1741,'-one to Mr. West, dated 'May 4th, 1742,'-(none
in 1743,) and one to Mr. Conway, dated 'Houghton: Oct. 6th, 1744,' are all that appear till
'may 18th, 1745,' when his letters to George Montagu recommence, after an interval of eight
years.  Whereas, in the correspondence now published, there are no less than one hundred and
seventeen letters during that interval.

The letters of Walpole to Sir Horace Mann have also another advantage over those of the same
author previously published, namely, that Sir Horace's constant absence from home, and the
distance of his residence from the British Islands, made every occurrence that happened acceptable
to him as news.  It) consequence, his correspondent relates to him every thing that takes place,
both in the court and in society,-whether the anecdotes are of a public or private nature,-hence
the collection of' letters to him becomes a most exact chronicle of the events of the day,
and elucidates very amusingly both the manners of the time, and the characters of the persons
then alive.  In the sketches, however, of character, which Walpole has thus left us, we must
always remember that, though a very quick and accurate observer, he was a man of many prejudices;
and that, above all, his hostility was unvarying and unbounded with regard to any of his contemporaries,
who had been adverse to the person or administration of Sir Robert Walpole.  This, though an
amiable feeling, occasionally carries him too far in his invectives, and renders him unjust
in his judgments.

"The answers of Sir Horace Mann are also preserved at Strawberry Hill: they are very voluminous,
but particularly devoid of interest, as they are written in a dry heavy style, and consist
almost entirely of trifling details of forgotten Florentine society, mixed with small portions
of Italian political news of the day, which are even still less amusing than the former topic.
They have, however, been found useful to refer to occasionally, in order to explain allusions
in the letters of Walpole.

"Sir Horace Mann was a contemporary and early friend of Horace Walpole. (2) He was the second
son of Robert Mann, of Linton, in the county of Kent, Esq.  He was appointed in 1740 minister
plenipotentiary from England to the court of Florence-a post he continued to occupy for the
long period of forty-six years, till his death, at an advanced age, November 6, 1786.  In 1755
he was created a baronet, with remainder to the issue of his brother Galfridus Mann, and, in
the reign of George the Third, a knight of the Bath.  It will be observed that Walpole calls
his correspondent Mr. Mann, whereas the title-pages of' these volumes, and all the notes which
have been added by the editor designate him as Sir Horace Mann.  This latter appellation is
undoubtedly, in the greater part of the correspondence, an anachronism, as Sir Horace Mann
was not made a baronet till the year 1755; but, as he is best known to the world under that
designation, it was considered better to allow him the title, by courtesy, throughout the work.

"As the following letters turn much upon the politics of the day, and as the ignoble and unstable
Governments which followed that of Sir Robert Walpole are now somewhat forgotten, it may not
be unacceptable to the reader to be furnished with a slight sketch of the political changes
which took place from the year 1742 to the death of George the Second.

"At the general election of 1741, immense efforts were made by the Opposition to the Walpole
administration to strengthen their phalanx-great sums were spent by their leaders in elections,
and an union was at length effected between the Opposition or 'Patriots,' headed by Pulteney,
and the Tories or Jacobites, who had hitherto, though opposed to Walpole, never acted cordially
with the former.

"Sir Robert, upon the meeting of Parliament, exerted himself with almost more than his usual
vigour and talent, to resist this formidable band of opponents; but the chances were against
him.  The timidity of his friends, and, if we may believe Horace Walpole, the treachery of
some of his colleagues, and finally the majority in the House of Commons against him, compelled
him at length to resign; which he did in the beginning of February, 1742.  Upon this step being
taken, and perhaps even before it, the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Hardwicke, the two most influential
members of Sir Robert Walpole's cabinet, entered into communication with Mr. Pulteney and Lord
Carteret, the leaders of the regular Opposition, with a view of forming a government, to the
exclusion of the Tories and Jacobites, and even of part of Mr. Pulteney's own party.  The negotiation
was successful; but it was so at the expense of the popularity, reputation, and influence of
Pulteney, who never recovered the disgrace of thus deserting his former associates.

"In consequence of these intrigues, the King agreed to send for Lord Wilmington, and to place
him at the head of the ministry.  It is remarkable that this man, who was a mere cipher, should
have been again had recourse to, after his failure in making a government at the very commencement
of the reign of George the Second, when his manifest incapacity, and the influence of Queen
Caroline, had occasioned the remaining of his opponent Sir Robert Walpole in power.  With Lord
Wilmington came in Lord Harrington, as president of the council; Lord Gower, as privy seal;
Lord Winchilsea, as first lord of the admiralty; Lord Carteret as secretary of state; the other
secretary being the Duke of Newcastle, who had been so under Walpole; Lord Hardwicke continued
chancellor; and Samuel Sandys was made chancellor of the exchequer.  Several of the creatures
of Pulteney obtained minor offices: but he himself, hampered by his abandonment of many of
his former friends, took no place; but Only obtained a promise of an earldom, whenever he might
wish for it.

"These arrangements produced, as was natural, a great schism in the different parties, which
broke out at a meeting at the Fountain Tavern, on the 12th of February, where the Duke of Argyll
declared himself in opposition to the new government, upon the ground of the unjust exclusion
of the Tories.  The Duke of Argyll subsequently relented, and kissed hands for the master-generalship
of the ordnance, upon the understanding, that Sir John Hinde Cotton, a notorious Jacobite,
was to have a place.  This the King refused; upon which the Duke finally subsided into Opposition.
Lord Stair had the ordnance, and Lord Cobham was made a field-marshal and commander of the
forces in England.  This latter event happened at the end of the session of 1742, when Lord
Gower and Lord Bathurst, and one or two other Jacobites, were promoted.  It was at this period
(July, 1742), that the King, by the advice of Sir Robert Walpole, who saw that such a step
would complete the degradation Of Pulteney, insisted upon his taking out the patent for his
earldom and quitting the House of Commons; which he did with the greatest unwillingness.

"On the death of Lord Wilmington, in July 1743, Mr.  Pelham was made first lord of the treasury
and chancellor of the exchequer (from which office Sandys was dismissed), by the advice of
Sir Robert Walpole, and instead of Lord Bath, who now found that his adversary had really turned
the key upon him, (3) and that the door of the cabinet was never to be unlocked to him.  The
ministry was at this time, besides its natural feebleness, rent by internal dissensions; for
Lord Carteret, who, as secretary of state, had accompanied the King abroad in 1743, had acquired
great influence over his royal master,-and trusting to this, and to the superiority of his
talents over his colleagues, his insolence to them became unbounded.  The timid and time-serving
Pelhams were quite ready to humble themselves before him; but Lord Carteret was not content
with this: he was not content, unless he showed them, and made them feel, all the contempt
he entertained for them.  In addition to these difficulties, Lord Gower resigned the privy-seal
in December 1743, upon the plea that no more Tories were taken into office; but probably more
from perceiving that the administration could not go on.  Lord Cobham also resigned, and went
again into opposition.

"Finally, in November 1744, the greater part of the cabinet having previously made their arrangements
with the Opposition) joined in a remonstrance to the King against Lord Carteret, and offered,
if he was not dismissed, their own resignations. After some resistance, the King, again by
the advice of Lord Orford, yielded.  Lord Carteret and his adherents, and those of Lord Bath,
were dismissed, and a mixed government of Whigs and Tories was formed.  Mr. Pelham continued
first minister; the Duke of Dorset was made president of the council; Lord Gower again took
the privy-seal, which had been held for a few months by Lord Cholmondeley; the Duke of Bedford
became first lord of' the admiralty; Lord Harrincton secretary of state; Lord Chesterfield,
Lord Sandwich, George Grenville, Doddington, and Lyttelton, and Sir John Hinde Cotton, Sir
John Philipps, and some other Tories, had places.  But though the King had dismissed Lord Carteret
(now become Earl of Granville) from his councils, he had not from his confidence. He treated
his new ministers with coldness and incivility, and consulted Lord Granville secretly upon
all important points.

"At length, in the midst of the Rebellion, in August 1746, the ministry went to the King, and
gave him the option of taking Pitt into office, which he had previously refused, or receiving
their resignations.  After again endeavouring in vain to form an administration through the
means of Lord Granville and Lord Bath, the King was obliged to consent to the demands of his
ministers-and here may be said to commence the leaden rule of the Pelhams, which continued
to influence the councils of this country, more or less, for so many years. Pitt took the inferior,
but lucrative office of paymaster; and from this time no material change took place till the
death of Mr. Pelham, in March 1754, unless we except the admission of Lord Granville to the
cabinet in 1751, as president of the council; an office which he contrived, with an interested
prudence very unlike his former conduct, to retain during all succeeding ministries-and the
getting rid of the Duke of Bedford and Lord Sandwich, of whom the Pelhams had become jealous.

The death of Pelham called into evidence the latent divisions and hatreds of public Men, who
had been hitherto acting in concert.  Fox and Pitt were obviously the two persons, upon one
of whom the power of Pelham must eventually fall.  But the intriguing Duke of Newcastle hated,
and was jealous of both. He, therefore, placed Sir Thomas Robinson in the House of Commons,
as secretary of state and leader, and made Henry Bilson Legge chancellor of the exchequer,
while he himself took the treasury-leaving Fox (4) and Pitt in the subordinate situations they
had hitherto held.  The incapacity of Sir Thomas Robinson became, however, soon so apparent,
that a change was inevitable.  This was hastened by a temporary coalition between Fox and Pitt,
which was occasioned, naturally enough, by the ill-treatment they had both received from the
Duke of Newcastle.

"At length the latter reluctantly consented to admit Fox into the cabinet, in 1755.  Upon this,
Pitt again broke with Fox, and went with his friends into opposition, with the exception of
Sir George Lyttelton, who became chancellor of the exchequer.  The new government, however,
lasted but one session of parliament-its own dissensions, the talents of its opponents, and
the dissatisfaction of the King, who had been thwarted in his German subsidiary treaties, aiding
in its downfall.

"The Duke of Devonshire, who had been very active in the previous political negotiations, was
now commissioned, in 1756, by the King to form a government.  The Duke of Newcastle and Fox
were turned out, and Pitt became lord of the ascendant.  But the King's aversion to his new
ministers was even greater than it had been to his old; and in February 1757, he commissioned
Lord Waldegrave to endeavour to form a government, with the assistance of Newcastle and Fox.
In this undertaking he failed, very mainly through the irresolutions and jealousies of Newcastle.
Thus circumstanced, the King, however unwillingly, was obliged to deliver himself up into the
hands of Pitt, Who (in June, 1757) succeeded in forming that administration, which was destined
to be one of the most glorious ones England has ever seen.  He placed himself at the head of
it, holding the situation of secretary of state and leader of the House of Commons, leaving
the Duke of Newcastle at the head of the treasury, and placing Legge again in the exchequer.
This administration lasted till the reign of the succeeding sovereign."

To his edition of the Letters to Sir Horace Mann, Lord Dover appended illustrative notes, which
are retained in the present.

It remains only to add, that the original notes of Horace Walpole are throughout retained,
undistinguished by any signature; whereas, those of the various editors are indicated by a
characteristic initial, which is explained in the progress of the work.

(2) The coincidence of remarkable names in the two families of Mann and Walpole, would lead
one to imagine that there was also some connection of relationship between them-and yet none
is to be traced in the pedigree of either family.  Sir Robert Walpole had two brothers named
Horace and Galfridus-and Sir Horace Mann's next brother was named Galfridus Mann.  If such
a relationship did exist, it probably came through the Burwells, the family of Sir Robert Walpole's
mother. (3) "Sir Robert Walpole's expression, when he found that Pulteney had consented to

To the first edition of Lord Orford's works, which was
published the year after he died, no memoir of his life was
prefixed: his death                     was too recent, his
life and character was too well known, his works
     too popular, to require it.  His political Memoirs, and
the collections of his Letters which have been subsequently
published, were edited by persons, who, though well qualified
for their task in every other respect, have failed in their
account of his private life, and their
appreciation of his individual character, from the want of a
personal acquaintance with their author.

The life contained in Sir Walter Scott's Biographical Sketches of the English Novelists labours
under the same disadvantages. He had never seen Lord Orford, nor even lived with such of his
intimates and contemporaries in society as survived him.

Lord Dover, who has so admirably edited the first part of his correspondence with Sir Horace
Mann, knew Lord Orford only by having been carried sometimes, when a boy, by his father Lord
Clifden to Strawberry Hill.  His editorial labours with these letters were the last occupation
of his accomplished mind, and were pursued while his body was fast sinking under the complication
of disease, which so soon after deprived Society Of One Of its most distinguished members,
the arts of an enlightened patron, and his intimates of an amiable and attaching friend.  Of
the meagreness and insufficiency of his memoir of Lord Orford's life prefixed to the letters,
he was himself aware, and expressed to the author of these pages his inability then to improve
it, and his regret that circumstances had deprived him, while it was yet time, of the assistance
of those who could have furnished him with better materials.  His account of the latter part
of Lord Orford's life is deficient in details, and sometimes erroneous as to dates.  He appears
likewise to have been unacquainted with some of his writings, and the circumstances which led
to and accompanied them.  In the present publication those deficiencies are supplied from notes,
in the hands of the writer, left by Lord Orford, of the dates of the principal events of his
own life, and of the writing and publication of all his works.  It is only to be regretted
that his autobiography is so short, and so entirely confined to dates. In estimating the character
of Lord Orford, and in the opinion which he gives of his talents, Lord Dover has evinced much
candour and good taste.  He praises with discrimination, and draws no unfair inferences from
the peculiarities of a character with which he was not personally acquainted.

It is by the Review of the Letters to Sir Horace Mann, that the severest condemnation has been
passed and the most unjust impressions given, not only of the genius and talents, but of the
heart and character, of Lord Orford.  The mistaken opinions of the eloquent and accomplished
author (5) of that review are to be traced chiefly to the same causes which defeated the intentions
of the two first biographers.  In his case, these causes were increased, not only by no acquaintance
with his subject, but by still farther removal from the fashions, the social habits, the little
minute details, of the age to which Horace Walpole belongs,-an age so essentially different
from the business, the movement, the important struggles, of that which claims the critic as
one of its most distinguished ornaments.  A conviction that these reasons led to his having
drawn up, from the supposed evidence of Walpole's works alone, a character of their  author
so entirely and offensively unlike the original, has forced the pen into the feeble and failing
hand of the writer of these pages,-has imposed the pious duty of attempting to rescue, by incontrovertible
facts, acquired in long intimacy, the memory of an old and beloved friend, from the giant grasp
of an author and a critic from whose judgment, when deliberately formed, few can hope to appeal
with success.  The candour, the good-nature of this critic,-the inexhaustible stores of his
literary acquirements, which place him in the first rank of those most distinguished for historical
knowledge and critical acumen,-will allow him, I feel sure, to forgive this appeal from his
hasty and general opinion, to the judgment of his better informed mind, on the peculiarities
of' a character often remarkably dissimilar from that of his works.

Lord Dover has justly and forcibly remarked, "that what did the most honour both to the head
and the' heart of Horace Walpole, was the friendship which he bore to Marshal Conway; a man
who, according to all the accounts of him that have come down to us, was so truly worthy of
inspiring such a decree of affection." (6) He then quotes the character given of him by the
editor of Lord Orford's works in 1798.  This character of Marshal Conway was a portrait drawn
from the life, and, as it proceeded from the same pen which now traces these lines, has some
right to be inserted here.  "It is only those who have had the opportunity of penetrating into
the most secret motives of his public conduct, and into the inmost recesses of his private
life, who can do real justice to the unsullied purity of his character;-who saw and knew him
in the evening of his days, retired from the honourable activity of a soldier and of a statesman,
to the calm enjoyments of private -life; happy in the resources of his own mind, and in the
cultivation of useful science, in the bosom of domestic peace-unenriched by pensions or places-undistinguished
by titles or ribbons-unsophisticated by public life, and unwearied by retirement."

To this man, Lord Orford's attachment, from their boyish days
at Eton school to the death of Marshal Conway in 1795, is
already a circumstance of sufficiently rare occurrence among
men of the world.  Could such a man, of whom the foregoing
lines are an unvarnished sketch-of whose character, simplicity
was one of the distinguished ornaments-could such a man have
endured the intimacy of such an individual as the reviewer
describes Lord Orford to have been?  Could an intercourse of
uninterrupted friendship and undiminished confidence have
existed between them during a period of nearly sixty
             years, undisturbed by the business and bustle of
middle life, so apt to cool, and often to terminate, youthful
friendships? Could such an intercourse ever have existed, with
the supposed selfish indifference, and artificial coldness and
conceit of Lord Orford's character?

The last correspondence included in the present publication will, it is presumed, furnish no
less convincing proof, that the warmth of his feelings, and his capacity for sincere affection,
continued unenfeebled by age.  It is with this view, and this alone, that the correspondence
alluded to is now, for the first time, given to the public.  It can add nothing to the already
established epistolary fame of Lord Orford, and the public can be as little interested in his
sentiments for the two individuals addressed.  But, in forming a just estimate of his character,
the reader will hardly fail to observe that those sentiments were entertained at a time of
life when, for the most part, the heart is too little capable of expansion to open to new attachments.
The whole tone of these letters must prove the unimpaired warmth of his feelings, and form
a striking contrast to the cold harshness of which he has                         been accused,
in his intercourse with Madame du Deffand, at an earlier period of his life.  This harshness,
as was noticed by the editor of Madame du Deffand's letters, in the preface to that publication,
proceeded solely from a dread of ridicule, which formed a principal feature of Mr. Walpole's
character, and which, carried, as in his case, to excess, must be called a principal weakness.
It pervades all his thoughts and all his expressions.  If it were taken away, nothing would
be left." (8)

He affected nothing; he played no part; he was what he appeared to be.  Aware that he was ill
qualified for politics, for public life, for parliamentary business, or indeed for business
of any sort, the whole tenor of his life was consistent with this opinion of himself.  Had
he attempted to effect what belongs only to characters of another stamp -had he endeavoured
to take a lead in the House of Commons-had he sought for place, dignity, or office-had he aimed
at intrigue, or attempted to be a tool for others-then, indeed, he might have deserved the
appellation of artificial, eccentric, and capricious.

>From the retreat of his father, which happened the year after he entered parliament, the only
real interest he took in politics was when their events happened immediately to concern the
objects of his private friendships.  He occupied himself with what really amused him.  If he
had affected any thing, it would certainly not have been a taste for the trifling occupations
with which he is reproached.  Of no person can it be less truly said, that "affectation was
the essence of the man."  What man, or even what woman, ever affected to be the frivolous being
he is described?  When his critic says, that he had "the soul of a gentleman-usher," he was
little aware that he only repeated what Lord Orford often said of himself-that from his knowledge
of old ceremonials and etiquettes, he was sure that in a former state of existence, he must
have been a gentleman-usher,-about the time of Elizabeth.

In politics, he was what he professed to be, a Whig, in the sense which that denomination bore
in his younger days,-never a Republican.

In his old and enfeebled age, the horrors of the first French revolution made him a Tory; while
he always lamented, as one of the worst effects of its excesses, that they must necessarily
retard to a distant period the progress and establishment of civil liberty.  But why are we
to believe his contempt for crowned heads should have prevented his writing a memoir of "Royal
and Noble Authors?"  Their literary labours, when all brought together by himself, would not,
it is believed, tend much to raise, or much to alter his opinion of them.

In his letters from Paris, written in the years 1765, 1766, 1767 and 1771, it will be seen,
that so far from being infinitely more occupied with "the fashions and gossip of Versailles
and Marli than with a great moral revolution which was taking place in his sight," he was truly
aware of the state of the public mind, and foresaw all that was coming on.

Of Rousseau he has proved that he knew more, and that he judged him more accurately, than Mr.
Hume, and many others who were then duped by his mad pride and disturbed understanding.

Voltaire had convicted himself of the basest of vain lies in the intercourse he sought with
Mr. Walpole.  The details of this transaction, and the letters which passed at the time, are
already printed in the quarto edition of his works.     In the short notes of his life left
by himself, and from which all the dates in this notice are taken, it is thus mentioned:

"Although Voltaire, with whom I had never had the least acquaintance, had voluntarily written
to me first, and asked for my book, he wrote a letter to the Duchesse de Choiseul, in which,
without saying                              a syllable of his having written to me first, he
told her I had officiously   sent him my works, and declared war with him in defence  'de ce
bouffon de Shakspeare,' whom in his reply to me he pretended so much to admire.  The Duchesse
sent me Voltaire's letter; which gave me such a contempt for his disingenuity, that I dropped
all correspondence with him."

When he spoke with contempt of d'Alembert, it was not of his abilities; of which he never pretended
to judge.  Professor Saunderson had long before, when he was a lad at Cambridge, assured him,
that it would be robbing him to pretend teaching him mathematics, of which his mind was perfectly
incapable, so that any comparison of the intellectual powers of the two men" would indeed be
as "exquisitely ridiculous" as the critic declares it.  But lord Orford, speaking of d'Alembert,
complains of the overweening importance which he, and all the men of letters of those days
in France, attributed to their squabbles and disputes. (9)  It may surely be asked, whether
France will subscribe to this assertion of superiority, in the whole range of science!  If
she does, her character has undergone an even greater change, than any she has yet experienced
in the course of all her revolutions.

lord Orford is believed by his critic to have "sneered" at every body. sneering was not his
way of showing dislike.  He had very strong prejudices, sometimes adopted on very insufficient
grounds, and he therefore often made great mistakes in the appreciation of character; but when
influenced by such impressions, he always expressed his opinions directly, and often too violently.

The affections of his heart were bestowed on few; for in early life they had never been cultivated,
but they were singularly warm, pure, and constant; characterized not by the ardour of passion,
but by the constant preoccupation of real affection. He had lost his mother, to whom he was
fondly attached, early in life; and with his father, a man of coarse feelings and boisterous
manners, he had few sentiments in common.  Always feeble in constitution, he was unequal to
the sports of the field, and to the drinking which then accompanied them, so that during his
father's retreat at Houghton, however much he respected his abilities and was devoted to his
fame, he had little sympathy in his tastes, or pleasure in his society.  To the friends of
his own selection his devotion was not confined to professions or words: on all occasions of
difficulty, of whatever nature, his active affection came forward in defence of their character,
or assistance in their affairs.

When his friend Conway, as second in command under Sir John Mordaunt, in the expedition to
St. Maloes, partook in some degree of the public censure called forth by the failure of these
repeated ill-judged attempts on the coasts of France, Walpole's pen was immediately employed
in rebutting the accusations of the popular pamphlet of the day on this subject, And establishing
his friend's exemption from any responsibility in the failure.  When, on a more important occasion,
Mr. Conway was not only dismissed from being Equerry to the King, George III., but from the
command of his regiment, for his constitutional conduct and votes in the House of Commons,
in the memorable affair of the legality of General Warrants for the seizure of persons and
papers, Walpole immediately stepped forward, not with cold commendations of his friend's upright
and spirited conduct, but with all the confidence Of long-tried affection, and all the security
of noble minds incapable of misunderstanding each other, he insisted on being allowed to share
in future his fortune with his friend, and thus more than repair the pecuniary loss he had
incurred. (10) thus proving the justice he did to Walpole's sentiments and intentions.

In the case of General Conway's near relationship and intimacy from childhood, the cause in
which his fortunes were suffering might have warmed a colder heart, and opened a closer hand,
than Mr. Walpole's: but Madame du Deffand was a recent acquaintance, who had no claim on him,
but the pleasure he received from her society, and his desire that her blind and helpless old
age might not be deprived of any of the comforts and alleviations of which it was capable.
When by the financial arrangements of the French government, under the unscrupulous administration
of the Abb`e Terray, the creditors of the state were considerably reduced in income, Mr. Walpole,
in the most earnest manner, begged to prevent the unpleasantness of his old friend's exposing
her necessities, and imploring aid from the minister of the day, by allowing him to make up
the deficit in her revenue, as a loan, Or in any manner that would be most satisfactory to
her.  The loss, after all, did not fall on that stock from which she derived her income, and
the assistance was not accepted; but Madame du Deffand's confidence in, and opinion of, the
offer, we see in her letters.

During his after life, although no ostentatious contributor to public charities and schemes
of improvement, the friends in whose opinion he knew he could confide, had always more difficulty
to repress than to excite his liberality.

That he should have wished his friend Conway to be employed as commander on military expeditions,
which, as a soldier fond of his profession, he naturally coveted, although Mr. Walpole might
disapprove of the policy of the minister in sending out such expeditions, surely implies neither
disguise, nor contradiction in his opinions.

The dread which the reviewer supposes him to have had, lest he should lose caste as a gentleman,
by ranking as a wit and an author, he was much too     fine a gentleman to have believed in
the possibility of feeling.  He knew he had never studied since he left college; he knew that
he was not at all a learned man: but the reputation he had acquired by his wit and by his writings,
not only among fine gentlemen, but with society in general, made him nothing loath to cultivate
every opportunity of increasing it.  The account he gave of the idleness of his life to Sir
Horace Mann, when he disclaims the title of "the learned gentleman," was literally true; and
it is not easy to imagine any reason why a man at the age of forty-three, who admits that he
is idle, and who renounces being either a learned man or a politician, should be "ashamed"
of playing loo in good company till two or three o'clock in the morning, if he neither ruins
himself nor others. (11)  He wrote his letters as rapidly as his disabled fingers would allow
him to form the characters of a remarkably legible hand.  No rough draughts or sketches of
familiar letters were found amongst his papers at Strawberry Hill: but he was in the habit
of putting down on the backs of letters or on slips of paper, a note of facts, of news, of
witticisms, or of any thing he wished not to forget, for the amusement of his correspondents.

After reading "The Mysterious Mother," who will accede to the opinion, that his works are "destitute
of every charm that is derived from elevation, or from tenderness of sentiment?" (12)

But, with opinions as to the genius, the taste, or the talents of Lord Orford, this little
notice has nothing to do.  It aims solely at rescuing his individual character from misconceptions.
Of the means necessary for this purpose, its writer, by the "painful preeminence" of age, remains
the sole depositary, and being so, has submitted to the task of repelling such misconceptions.
It is done with the reluctance which must always be experienced in differing from, or calling
in question, the opinions of a person, for whom is felt all the admiration and respect due
to super-eminent abilities, and all the grateful pride and affectionate regard inspired by
personal friendship.

                           Second Advertisement

THE last volume will be found to contain upwards of one hundred letters, introduced into no
former edition of the Correspondence of Horace Walpole.  The greater part of them were written
between the years 1789 and 1797, and were addressed to the Miss Berrys, during their residence
in Italy.  They embrace most of the leading events of the first five years of the French Revolution;
and wherever the facts detailed in the letters have appeared to require elucidation or confirmation,
the Editor has generally had recourse to M. Thiers's useful "History" of that great event;
which has recently appeared in an English dress, accompanied with notes and illustrations,
drawn from the most authentic sources.

While the last volume was at press, the Editor was favoured with a letter from the Right Honourable
Sir Charles Grey, relative to the share which he considers Mr. Walpole to have had in the composition
and publication of the Letters of Junius.

Albany Street, Regent's Park, October 28, 1840.

             TO THE EDITOR OF THE LETTERS OF HORACE WALPOLE,
                             EARL OF ORFORD.

Sir,

1. Before your last volume is published, I am desirous of stating to you some of the considerations
which, more than seventeen years ago, led me to the belief I still entertain, that Walpole
had a principal share in the composition and publication of the Letters of Junius: though I
think it likely that Mason, or some other friend corrected the style, and gave precision and
force to the most striking passages.

2. It was in 1823, whilst I was residing in India, that Lord Holland's edition of Walpole's
Memoires of the Last Ten Years of the Reign of George the Second suggested to me this notion;
and it was shortly afterwards communicated to several of my friends. The edition of Junius
which I had with me, was that of Mr. Woodfall the younger, in three volumes; and I am not at
present by any means satisfied that all the letters which the editor assigns to Junius were
written by him: but in this hasty notice I must proceed upon the supposition that they were.

3. It will be remembered that the Memoires were composed by Walpole in secrecy, and that he
left them in a sealed box, which, by his will, was forbidden to be opened till many years after
his death.  The letters from which the corresponding passages are given below are all published
as Letters of Junius by Mr. Woodfall, and are of dates later than the time when Walpole wrote
his Memoires; but half a century earlier than the time when they were printed.

Note by the transcriber: there follows a table, in which letters of Junius are presented for
comparisons side by side with writings of Walpole.  I have changed the format to present them
in sequence.  Return to text.

Junius: I own, my lord, that yours is not an uncommon character.  Women, and men like women,
are timid, vindictive, and irresolute. Woodfall's Junius, vol. ii, p. 168.

Walpole: As it is observed that timorous natures like those of women are generally cruel, Lord
mansfield might easily slide into rigour, etc.-Walpole's Memoires, vol. ii. p. 175.

Junius: Without openly supporting the person, you (Lord Mansfield) have done essential service
to the cause; and consoled yourself for the loss of a favourite family by reviving and establishing
the maxims of their government.-vol. ii, p. 182.

Walpole: The occasions of the times had called him (Lord Mansfield) off from principles that
favoured an arbitrary king-he still leaned towards an arbitrary government.-vol. ii. p. 266.

Junius: You (Lord Mansfield) would fain be thought to take no share in government, while in
reality you are the mainspring of the machine.-vol. ii. p. 179.

Walpole: Pitt liked the dignity of despotism; Lord Mansfield the reality.-Vol. ii. p. 274.

Junius: You secretly engross the power, while you decline the title of minister.-vol. ii. p.179.

Walpole: He was timid himself, and always waving what he was always courting.-Vol. ii. p. 336.

Junius: In council he generally affects to take a moderate part.-vol. ii. p. 354. At present
there is something oracular in the delivery of my opinion.  I speak from a recess which no
human curiosity can penetrate.-vol. i. p. 314.

Walpole: The conduct was artful, new and grand: secluded from all eyes, his (Lord Chatham's)
orders were received as oracles.-vol. ii. p. 347.

Junius: Our enemies treat us as the cunning trader does the unskilful Indian.  they magnify
their generosity when they give us baubles of no proportionate value for ivory and gold.-vol.
ii. p. 359.

Walpole: They made a legal purchase to all eternity of empires and posterity, from a parcel
of naked savages, for a handful of glass beads and baubles.-Vol. i. p. 343.

Junius: If you deny him the cup, there will be no keeping him within the pale of the ministry.-vol.
ii. p. 249.

Walpole: Where I believe the clergy do not deny the laity the cup.-Letter to Montague. He took
care to regulate his patron's warmth within the pale of his own advantage.-Memoires, vol. ii.
p. 197. Come over to the pale of loyalty.-vol. i. p. 282.

Junius: Honour and justice must not be renounced although a thousand modes of right and wrong
were to occupy the degrees of morality between Zeno and Epicurus.  The fundamental principles
of Christianity may still be preserved.-vol. ii. p. 346.

Walpole: The modes of Christianity were exhausted.-Vol. ii. p. 282 To mark how much the modes
of thinking change, and that fundamentals themselves can make no impression.-vol. ii. p. 265.

Junius: He (the duke of Bedfor) would not have betrayed such ignorance or such contempt of
the constitution as openly to avow in a court of judicature the purchase and sale of a borough.
Note.- In an answer in chancery in a suit against him to recover a large sum paid him by a
person whom he had undertaken to return to parliament for one of his Grace's boroughs.  He
was compelled to repay the money.-vol. i. p. 576.

Walpole: Corruption prevailed in the House of Commons.  Instances had been brought to our courts
of judicature how much it prevailed in our elections. Note.-The Duke of Bedford had received
1500 pounds for electing Jefrery French at one of his boroughs in the west; but he dying immediately,
his heir sued the Duke for the money, who paid it, rather than let the cause be heard.

Junius: The Princess Dowager made it her first care to inspire her son with horror against
heresy, and with a respect for the church. His mother took more pains to form his beliefs than
either his morals or his understanding.-vol. iii. p. 408.

Walpole: >From the death of the Prince the object of the Princess Dowager had been the government
of her son; and her attention had answered.  She had taught him great devotion, and she had
taken care that he should be taught nothing else.-Vol. i. p. 396.

Junius: That prince had strong natural parts, and used frequently to blush for his own ignorance
and want of education, which had been wilfully neglected by his mother and her minion.

Walpole: Martin spoke for the clause, and said, "The King could not have a separate interest
from his people, the Princess might; witness Queen Isabella and her minion Mortimer."-Vol.
i. p. 118.

Transcriber's note: the following paragraph is surrounded by asterisks.  it appears to be a
comment by the letter writer, sir charles Grey, rather than either Junius or Walpole.

Our great Edward, too, at an early period, had sense enough to understand the nature of the
connexion between his abandoned mother and the detested Mortimer.

Junius: when it was proposed to settle the present King's household as Prince of Wales, it
is well known that the Earl of Bute was forced into it in direct contradiction to the late
King's inclination. vol. ii. .-

Walpole: Fox had an audience.  The monarch was sour, but endeavoured to keep his temper, yet
made no concessions; no request to the retiring minister to stay.  At last he let slip the
true cause of his indignation: "You," said he, "have made me make that puppy Bute groom of
the stole."-Vol. ii. p. 92.

Though too long to be cited in these hurried notes, there are several other passages in which
the coincidence of sentiment and expression and of the order in which the thoughts and arguments
are ranged, is very remarkable: and the difficulty of accounting otherwise for such coincidences
between the Letters of Junius and the unpublished and secret Memoires of Walpole, first made
me suspect that the two names might belong to one and the same person-Horace Walpole the younger.

4. Being led by this conjecture to examine the other works of Walpole, I found, in them also,
many echoes, as it were, of the voice of Junius, which it is singular should not have been
more observed.  No One, I think, can collate the concluding portion of Walpole's letter to
Lord Bute, of February 15, 1762, and the latter part of the eulogium of Junius on Lord Chatham,
without being struck by the similarity of manner and tone; and by the identity of that feeling,
which, in both cases, prompts the writer, whilst he is elaborating compliments, to defend himself
jealously against all suspicion of flattery or interested motives.

Transcriber's note: there follows a comparison of material from Junius and Walpole, set out
in parallel columns.  I have changed these to a sequential arrangement.

Junius: I did not intend to make a public declaration of the respect I bear Lord Chatham. 
I well knew what unworthy conclusions would be drawn from it.  But I am called upon to deliver
my opinion, and surely it is not in the little censure of Mr. Home to deter me from doing signal
justice to a man who, I confess, has grown upon my esteem.  As for the common, sordid views
of avarice, or any purpose of vulgar ambition, I question whether the applause of Junius would
be of service to Lord Chatham.  My vote will hardly recommend him to an increase of his pension,
or to a seat in the Cabinet.  But if his ambition be upon a level with his understanding; if
he judges of what is truly honourable for himself with the same superior genius which animates
and directs him to eloquence in debate, to wisdom in decision, even the pen of Junius shall
contribute to reward him.  Recorded honour shall gather round his monument, and thicken over
him.  It is a solid fabric, and will support the laurels that adorn it.  I am not conversant
in the language of panegyric.  These praises are extorted from me; but they will wear well,
for they have been dearly earned.-Vol. ii. p. 310.

WALPOLE.

I have neither time nor space for going much farther into this part of the subject; but there
is one circumstance which, in its application to the supposition that Francis was Junius, is
too remarkable to be passed over.  Sir Philip Francis supplied Mr. Almon with reports of two
speeches of Lord Chatham, in one of which there is this passage, "The Americans had Purchased
their liberty at a dear rate, since they had quitted their native country and gone in search
of freedom to a desert."  Junius, about three weeks before, had said, "They left their native
land in search of freedom, and found it in a desert;" and it has been inferred from this, that
the words in the speech were not Lord Chatham's, but the reporter's, and that Sir Philip Francis
was Junius.  But it happens that Walpole, in his Royal and Noble Authors, some years earlier
than either the letter of Junius or the speech of Lord Chatham, had said of Lord Brooke, that
he was on the point "Of seeking liberty in the forests of America."

5. If we turn from a recollection of the words to a consideration of the peculiarities of the
style of Junius, I think it will be agreed that the most remarkable of all is that species
of irony which consists in equivocal compliment.  Walpole also excelled in this; and prided
himself upon doing so.  Are we not justified in saying, that of all who, in the eighteenth
century, cast their thoughts on public occurrences into the form of letters, Junius and Walpole
are the most distinguished! that the works of no other prose writer of their time exhibit a
zest for political satire equal to that which is displayed in the Letters of Junius, and in
the Memoires and Political Letters of Walpole  and that the sarcasm of equivocal praise was
the favourite weapon in the armoury of each, though it certainly appears to have been tempered,
and sharpened, and polished with additional care for the hand of Junius?  When did Francis
ever deal in compliment or in equivoque?  In his vituperation there was always more of fury
than of malice: but Junius and Walpole were cruel.  Madame du Deffand says to the latter, "Votre
plume est de fer tremp`e dans de fiel."  I have sometimes thought that clever old woman either
knew or suspected him to be Junius.  She uses in one place the unusual expression, "Votre `ecrit
de Junius:" and if Walpole was Junius, some of the most carefully composed letters in 1769
and 1771 were written in Paris ; where, indeed, it would seem that Junius, whoever he was,
collected the materials for the accusation with which he threatened the Duke of Bedford, and
which he evidently knew to be untrue.

6. It has sometimes been said, that the Letters of Junius must have been written by a lawyer,
and they were at one time attributed even to Mr. Dunning.  The mistakes which I am about to
notice, trifling as they may be, make it impossible that any lawyer should have been the author;
and it appears to me that not only is there a considerable resemblance in those mistakes which
I adduce of Walpole's, but that the affectation in both of employing legal terms with which
they were not familiar, and of which they did not distinctly apprehend the meaning, is very
remarkable.  Junius thought De Lolme's Essay deep," (13) and talks of property which "savours
of the reality:" (14) he misapplies that trite expression of the courts, bona fide: (15) misunderstands
mortmain, (16) and supposes that an inquisitio post mortem was an inquiry how the deceased
came by his death. (17)  Walpole talks of "the purparty of a wife's lands;" of "tenures against
which, of all others, quo warrantos are sure to take place;" (18) of the days of soccage,"
which he supposes to be obsolete; and of a fera naturae.

Transcriber's note: Again there are a few passages from Junius and Walpole compared in parallel
columns, which I present below in sequence.

Junius: You say the facts on which you reason are universally admitted: a gratis dictum which
I flatly deny.-vol. ii. p. 143.

Walpole: This circumstance is alleged against them as an incident contrived to gain belief,
as if they had been in danger of their lives.  The argument is gratis dictum.-Works, vol. ii.
p. 568.

Junius: They are the trustees, not the owners of the estate.  the fee simple is in us.- vol.-vol.
i. p. 345.

Walpole: Do you think we shall purchase the fee simple of him for so many years?-Letters, vol. ii.

7. Walpole's time of life, his station in society, means of information, and habits of writing
much, and anonymously, and in concealment, all tally with the supposition of his being Junius.
So do his places of residence, when that part of the subject is carefully examined.

8. It is an odd circumstance that Walpole, who makes remarks on every thing, makes no remark
on Junius.  If he ever expressed an opinion of him in his letters to any of his numerous correspondents,
those letters have been suppressed.  There are fewer letters of his in the years during which
Junius was writing, than in any others.

9. Walpole's quarrel with the Duke and Duchess of Bedford, and The party whom he calls "the
Bedford court," and Junius "the Bloomsbury gang," would account for the rancour of the letters
of the latter to the Duke.

10. Walpole's dislike and opinion of the Duke of Grafton, which is nowhere more remarkably
expressed than in a letter published for the first time in your third volume, coupled with
his friendship for the first Duchess of Grafton, fall in with the attacks of Junius on the Duke.

11. The Memoires of Walpole show an enmity to Lord Mansfield almost equal to that of Junius.

12. Turning from these to a person in a different station, we find, on the part of Walpole,
(and, by-the-by, of Mason too,) a sort of spite against Dr. Johnson; and in the works of Walpole,
selected by himself for publication after his death,' there is a high-wrought criticism and
condemnation of the style of Johnson, which I cannot help believing to have been conceived
in revenge of the well-known handling of Junius in Johnson's pamphlet on the Falkland Islands.
"Let not injudicious admiration mistake the venom of the shift for the vigour of the bow,"
is said by Johnson of Junius: and Walpole says of Johnson, that "he destroys more enemies by
the weight of his shield, than with the point of his spear."

13. There is a host of small facts which might be adduced in support of what I have advanced.
Any one who has leisure to examine the voluminous works of Walpole, and who can lend his mind
to the inquiry, will find them crowd upon him.  Let me mention one well known occurrence.

Junius says, in the postscript of a private note to Mr. Woodfall, Beware of David Garrick.
He was sent to pump you, and went directly to Richmond to tell the King I should write no more."
He then directed Woodfall to send the following note to Garrick, but not in the handwriting
of Junius:-"I am very exactly informed of your impertinent inquiries, and of the information
you so busily sent to Richmond, and with what triumph and exultation it was received.  I knew
every particular of it the next day.  Now, mark me, vagabond!  Keep to your pantomimes, or
be assured you shall hear of it.  Meddle no more, thou busy informer! It is in my power to
make you curse the hour in which you dared to interfere with Junius." (19)

Mr. Woodfall remarks on this, that Garrick had received a letter from Woodfall, (the editor
of the newspaper in which the letters of Junius first appeared,) before the above-note of Junius
was sent to the printer, in which Garrick was told, in confidence, that there were some doubts
whether Junius would continue to write much longer.  Garrick flew with the intelligence to
Mr. Remus, one of the pages to the King, who immediately conveyed it to his Majesty, at that
time residing at Richmond; and from the peculiar sources of information that were open to this
extraordinary writer, Junius was apprised of the whole transaction on the ensuing morning,
and wrote the above postscript, and the letter that follows it, in consequence.  Now all that
appears to Mr. Woodfall the younger. to be so wonderful in these circumstances is very easily
explained, if we suppose Walpole to have been Junius.  Strawberry Hill is very near Richmond
Park, and Walpole had many acquaintances amongst those who were about the King; whilst his
friend, Mrs. Clive, the actress, who lived in the adjoining house to his own, and her brother,
Mr. Raftor, who frequently visited her, both belonged to Garrick's company.

But I have extended this letter too far.  My purpose was merely to invite your attention to
a subject of some literary interest, which you have peculiar opportunities of examining; and
to enable you, if you should think fit, to draw to it the attention of the public also.  I
am, Sir, Your obedient servant, CHAS. EDW. GREY. 20. Albemarle Street, October 24, 1840.

Any one who attempts to become a biographer of Horace Walpole must labour under the disadvantage
of following a greater master in the art; namely, Sir Walter Scott, whose lively and agreeable
account of this Author, contained in his "Lives of the Novelists," is well known and deservedly
admired.  As, however, the greater part of Walter Scott's pages is devoted to a very able criticism
of the only work of fiction produced by Walpole, "The Castle of Otranto," it has been thought,
that a more general sketch of his life and writings might not prove unacceptable to the reader.

Horace Walpole was the third and youngest son (21) of that eminent minister, Sir Robert Walpole-the
glory of the Whigs, the preserver of the throne of these realms to the present Royal Family,
and under whose fostering rule and guidance the country flourished in peace for more than twenty
years.  The elder brothers of Horace were, Robert, Lord Walpole, so created in 1723, who succeeded
his father in the Earldom of Orford in 1745, and died in 1751; and Sir Edward Walpole, Knight
of the Bath, whose three natural daughters were, Mrs. Keppel, wife to the Honourable Frederick
Keppel, Bishop of Exeter; the Countess of Waldegrave, afterwards Duchess of Gloucester; and
the Countess of Dysart.  Sir Edward Walpole died in 1784.  His sisters were, Catherine, who
died of consumption at the age of nineteen; and Mary, married to George, Viscount Malpas, afterwards
third Earl of Cholmondeley: she died in 1732.  The mother of Horace, and of his brothers and
sisters here mentioned, was Catherine Shorter, daughter of John Shorter, Esq. of Bybrook, in
Kent, and grand- daughter of Sir John Shorter, Lord Mayor of London in 1688. (22) She died
in 1736; and her youngest son, who always professed the greatest veneration for her memory,
erected a monument to her in Westminster Abbey, in one of the side aisles of Henry the Seventh's
Chapel.  Horace Walpole had also a half-sister, the natural daughter of his father, by his
mistress, Maria Skerrett, whom he afterwards married.  She also was named Mary Walpole, and
married Colonel Charles Churchill, the natural son of General Churchill; who was himself a
natural son of an older brother of the great Duke of Marlborough.

Horace Walpole was born October 5th, 1717 (23) and educated a Eton School, and at King's College,
Cambridge.  Upon leaving the latter place, he set out on his travels on the Continent, in company
with Gray the poet, with whom he had formed a friendship at school.  They commenced their journey
in March 1739, and continued abroad above two years.  Almost the whole of this time was spent
in Italy, and nearly a year of it was devoted to Florence; where Walpole was detained by the
society of his friends, Mr. Mann, Mr. Chute, and Mr. Whithed.  It was in these classic scenes,
that his love of art, and taste for elegant and antiquarian literature, became more developed;
and that it took such complete possession of him as to occupy the whole of his later life,
diversified only by the occasional amusement of politics, or the distractions of society. Unfortunately,
the friendship of Walpole and his travelling companion could not survive two years of constant
intercourse: they quarrelled and parted at Reggio, in July 1741, and afterwards pursued their
way homewards by different routes. (24)

Walpole arrived in England in September 1741, at which time his correspondence with Sir Horace
Mann commences.  He had been chosen member for Callington, in the parliament which was elected
in June of that year, and arrived in the House of Commons just in time to witness the angry
discussions which preceded and accompanied the downfall of his father's administration.  He
plunged at once into the excitement of political partisanship with all the ardour of youth,
and all the zeal which his filial affection for his father inspired.  His feelings at this
period are best explained by a reference to his letters in the following collection.  Public
business and attendance upon the House of Commons, apart from the interest attached to peculiar
questions, he seems never to have liked.  He consequently took very little part either in debates
or committees.  In March 1742, on a motion being made for an inquiry into the conduct of Sir
Robert Walpole for the preceding ten years, he delivered his maiden speech; (25) on which he
was complimented by no less a judge of oratory than Pitt.  This speech he has preserved in
his letter to Sir Horace Mann, of March 24th, 1742.  He moved the Address in 1751; and in 1756
made a speech on the question of employing Swiss regiments in the colonies.  This speech he
has also himself preserved in the second volume of his "Memoires."  In 1757 he was active in
his endeavours to save the unfortunate Admiral Byng.  Of his conduct upon this occasion he
has left a detailed account of his "Memoires."  This concludes all that can be collected of
his public life, and at the general election of 1768 (26) he finally retired from parliament.

Upon this occasion he writes thus to George Montagu,-" Will George Grenville cease to be the
most tiresome of beings?" (27)

>From this time Walpole devoted himself more than ever to his literary and antiquarian pursuits;
though the interest he still, in society at least, took in politics, is obvious, from the frequent
reference to the subject in his letters.

In the course of his life, his political opinions appear to have undergone a great change.
In his youth, and indeed till his old age, he was not only a strenuous Whig, but, at times,
almost a Republican.  How strong his opinions were in this sense may be gathered, both from
the frequent confessions of his political faith, which occur in his letters, and from his reverence
for the death-warrant of Charles the First, of which he hung up the engraving in his bed-room,
and wrote upon it with his own hand the words "Major Charta."  The horrors of the French Revolution
drove him, in the latter period of his life, into other views of politics; and he seems to
have become, in theory at least, a Tory, though he probably would have indignantly repudiated
the appellation, had it been applied to him.

Even during the earlier part of his career, his politics had varied a good deal (as, indeed,
in a long life, whose do not?); but, in his case, the cause of variation was a most amiable
one. His devoted attachment to Marshal Conway, which led him, when that distinguished man was
turned out of his command of a regiment, and of his place at court, in 1764, (28) to offer,
with much earnestness, to divide his fortune with him caused him also to look with a favourable
eye upon the government of the day, whenever Mr. Conway was employed, and to follow him implicitly
in his votes in the House of Commons. (29)  Upon another occasion he writes again in a similar
strain:-"My only reason for writing is, to repeat to you, that whatever you do, I shall act
with you.  I resent any thing done to you as to myself. My fortunes shall never be separated
from yours, except that, some day or other, I hope yours will be great, and I am content with
mine." (30)

Upon one political point Horace Walpole appears to have entertained from the first the most
just views, and even at a time when such were not sanctioned by the general opinion of the
nation.  From its very commencement, he objected to that disastrous contest the American war,
which, commenced in ignorant and presumptuous folly, was prolonged to gratify the wicked obstinacy
of individuals, and ended, as Walpole had foretold it would, in the discomfiture of its authors,
and the national disgrace and degradation, after a profuse and useless waste of blood and treasure.
Nor must his sentiments upon the Slave Trade be forgotten-sentiments which he held, too, in
an age when, far different from the present one, the Assiento Treaty, and other horrors of
the same kind, were deemed, not only justifiable, but praiseworthy.  "We have been sitting,"
he writes, on the 25th of February 1750, "this fortnight on the African Company.  We, the British
Senate, that temple of Liberty, and bulwark of Protestant Christianity, have, this fortnight,
been considering methods to make more effectual that horrid traffic of selling negroes.  It
has appeared to us, that six-and-forty thousand of these wretches are sold every year to our
plantations alone! It chills one's blood-I would not have to say I voted for it, for the continent
of America!  The destruction of the miserable inhabitants by the Spaniards was but a momentary
misfortune that flowed from the discovery of the New World, compared to this lasting havoc
which it brought upon Africa.  We reproach Spain, and yet do not even pretend the nonsense
of butchering the poor creatures for the good of their souls." (31)

One of the most favourite pursuits of Walpole was the building and decoration of his Gothic
villa of Strawberry Hill.  It is situated at the end of the village of Twickenham, towards
Teddington, on a slope, which gives it a fine view of the reach of the Thames and the opposite
wooded hill of Richmond Park.  He bought it in 1747, of Mrs. Chenevix, the proprietress of
a celebrated toy-shop.  He thus describes it in a letter of that year to Mr. Conway. (33)

He commenced almost immediately adding to the house, and Gothicizing it, assisted by the taste
and designs of his friend Mr. Bentley; till, in the end, the cottage of Mrs. Chenevix had increased
into the castellated residence we now behold.  He also filled it with collections of various
sorts-books, prints, pictures, portraits, enamels, and miniatures, antiquities, and curiosities
of all kinds.  Among these miscellaneous hoards are to be found some fine works of art, and
many things most valuable in an historical and antiquarian point of view.  For these various
expenses he drew upon his annual income, which arose from three patent places conferred on
him by his father, of which the designations were, Usher of the Exchequer, Comptroller of the
Pipe, and Clerk of the Estreats.  As early as the year 1744, these sinecures produced to him,
according to his own account, nearly two thousand a-year; and somewhat later, the one place
of Usher of Exchequer rose in value to double this sum.  This income, with prudent management,
sufficed for the gratification of his expensive tastes of building and collecting, to which
his long life was devoted.

With regard to the merits of Strawberry Hill, as a building, it is perhaps unfair, in the present
age, when the principles of Gothic architecture have been so much studied, and so often put
in practice, to criticise it too severely.  Walpole himself, who, in the earlier part of his
life, seems to have had an unbounded admiration for the works of his own hands, appears in
later times to have been aware of the faults in style of which he had been guilty; for, in
a letter to Mr. Barrett, in 1788, he says, "If Mr. Matthews was really entertained" (with seeing
Strawberry Hill), "I am glad.  But Mr. Wyatt has made him too correct a Goth not to have seen
all the imperfections and bad execution of my attempts; for neither Mr. Bentley nor my workmen
had studied the science, and I was always too desultory and impatient to consider that I should
please myself more by allowing time, than by hurrying my plans into execution before they were
ripe.  My house, therefore, is but a sketch for beginners; yours (34) is finished by a great
master; and if Mr. Matthews liked mine, it was en virtuose, who loves the dawnings of an art,
or the glimmerings of its restoration." (35)

In fact, the building of Strawberry Hill was "the glimmering of the restoration" of gothic
architecture, which had previously, for above a century, been so much neglected that its very
principles seemed lost.  If we compare the Gothic of Strawberry Hill with that of buildings
about the same period, or a little anterior to it, we shall see how vastly superior it is to
them, both in its taste and its decorations.  If we look at some of the restorations of our
churches of the beginning of the eighteenth century , we shall find them a most barbarous mixture
of Gothic forms and Grecian and Roman ornaments.  Such are the western towers of Westminster
Abbey, designed by Wren; the attempts at Gothic, by the same architect, in one or two of his
City churches; Gibbs's quadrangle of All Souls' College, Oxford; and the buildings in the same
style of Kent, Batty, Langley, etc.  To these Strawberry is greatly superior: and it must be
observed, that Walpole himself, in his progressive building, went on improving and purifying
his taste.  Thus the gallery and round-tower at Strawberry Hill, which were among his latest
works, are incomparably the best part of the house; and in their interior decorations there
is very little to be objected to, and much to be admired.

It were to be wished, indeed, that Walpole's haste to finish, to which he alludes in the letter
just quoted, and perhaps also, in some degree, economy, had not made him build his castle,
which, with all its faults, is a curious relic of a clever and ingenious man, with so little
solidity, that it is almost already in a state of decay.  Lath and plaster, and wood, appear
to have been his favourite materials for construction; which made his friend Williams (36)
say of him, towards the end of his life, "that he had outlived three sets of his own battlements."
It is somewhat curious, as a proof of the inconsistency of the human mind, that, having built
his castle with so little view to durability, Walpole entailed the perishable possession with
a degree of strictness, which would have been more fitting for a baronial estate.  And that,
too, after having written a fable entitled "The Entail," in consequence, of some one having
asked him whether he did not intend to entail Strawberry Hill, and in ridicule of such a proceeding.

Whether Horace Walpole conferred a benefit upon the public by setting the fashion of applying
the Gothic style of architecture to domestic purposes, may be doubtful; so greatly has the
example he gave been abused in practice since.  But, at all events, he thus led the professors
of architecture to study with accuracy the principles of the art, which has occasioned the
restoration and preservation in such an admirable manner of so many of our finest cathedrals.
colleges, and ancient Gothic and conventual buildings.  This, it must be at least allowed,
was the fortunate result of the rage for Gothic, which succeeded the building of Strawberry
Hill.  For a good many years after that event, every new building was pinnacled and turreted
on all sides, however little its situation, its size, or its uses might seem to fit it for
such ornaments.  Then, as fashion is never constant for any great length of' time, the taste
of the public rushed at once upon castles; and loopholes, and battlements, and heavy arches,
and buttresses appeared in every direction.  Now the fancy of the time has turned as madly
to that bastard kind of architecture, possessing, however, many beauties, which compounded
of the Gothic, Castellated, and Grecian or Roman, is called the Elizabethan, or Old English.
No villa, no country-house, no lodge in the outskirts of London, no box of a retired tradesman
is now built, except in some modification of this style.  The most ludicrous situations and
the most inappropriate destinations do not deter any one from pointing his gables, and squaring
his bay-windows, in the most approved Elizabethan manner.  And this vulgarizing and lowering
Of the Old English architecture, by over use, is sure, sooner or later, to lose its popularity,
and to cause it to be contemned and neglected, like its predecessors. All these different styles,
if properly applied, have their peculiar merits.  In old English country-houses, which have
formerly been conventual buildings, the gothic style may be, with great propriety, introduced.
On the height of Belvoir or in similar situations, nothing could be devised so appropriate
as the castellated; and in additions to, or renovations of old manor-houses the Elizabethan
may be, with equal advantage, adopted.  It is the injudicious application of all three which
has been, and is sure to be, the occasion of their fall in public favour.

The next pursuit of Walpole, to -which it now becomes desirable to advert, are his literary
labours, and the various publications with which, at different periods of his life, he favoured
the world.  His first effort appears to have been a copy of verses, written at Cambridge. 
His poetry is generally not of a very high order; lively, and with happy turns and expressions,
but injured frequently by a sort of quaintness, and a somewhat inharmonious rhythm.  Its merits,
however, exactly fitted it for the purpose which it was for the most part intended for; namely,
as what are called vers de soci`et`e."  (37) Among the best of his verses may be mentioned
those "On the neglected Column in the Place of St. Mark, at Florence," which contains some
fine lines; his "Twickenham Register;" and "The Three Vernons."

In 1752 he published his "Edes Walpolianae," or description of the family seat' of Houghton
Hall, in Norfolk, where his father had built a palace, and had made a fine collection of pictures,
which were sold by his grandson George, third Earl of Orford, to the Empress Catherine of Russia.
This work, which is, in fact, a mere catalogue of pictures, first showed the peculiar talent
of Horace Walpole for enlivening, by anecdote and lightness of style, a dry subject.  This
was afterwards still more exemplified in his "Anecdotes of Painting in England," of which the
different volumes were published in 1761, 1763, and 1771; and in the "Catalogue of Engravers,"
published in 1763.  These works were compiled from papers of Vertue, the engraver; but Walpole,
from the stores of his own historical knowledge, from his taste in the fine arts, and his happy
manner of sketching characters, rendered them peculiarly his own.  But his masterpiece in this
line was his "Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors," originally published in 1758. It is very
true, as Walter Scott observes, that "it would be difficult, by any process or principle of
subdivision, to select a list of so many plebeian authors, containing so very few whose genius
was worthy of commemoration." (38)  But this very circumstance renders the merit of Walpole
the greater, in having, out of such materials, composed a work which must be read with amusement
and interest, as long as liveliness of diction and felicity in anecdote are considered ingredients
of amusement in literature.

In 1757 Walpole established a private printing-press at Strawberry Hill, and the first work
he printed at it was the Odes of Gray, with Bentley's prints and vignettes.  Among the handsomest
and most valuable volumes which subsequently issued from this press, in addition to Walpole's
own Anecdotes of Painting, and his description of Strawberry Hill, must be mentioned the quarto
lucan, with the notes of Grotius and Bentley; the Life of Lord Herbert of Cherbury by himself,
flentzner's Travels, and Lord Whitworth's account of Russia.  Of all these he printed a very
limited number.  It does not, however, appear, as stated in the Biographical Dictionary, (39)
he reserved all the copies as presents; on the contrary, it would seem that in most instances
he sold a certain portion of the copies to the booksellers, probably with a view of defraying
the expenses of his printing establishment.  As, however, the supply in the book-market of
the Strawberry Hill editions was very small, they generally sold for high prices, and a great
interest was created respecting them.

In 1764 Walpole published one of the most remarkable of his works, "The Castle of Otranto;"
and in 1768 his still more remarkable production, "The Mysterious Mother." (41)

In speaking Of "The Castle of Otranto," it may be remarked as a singular coincidence in the
life of Walpole, that as he had been the first person to lead the modern public to seek for
their architecture in the Gothic style and age, so he also opened the great magazine of the
tales of Gothic times to their literature. "The Castle of Otranto" is remarkable," observes
an eminent critic, "not only for the wild interest of its story, but as the first modern attempt
to found a tale of amusing fiction upon the basis of the ancient romances of chivalry." (42)
"This romance," he continues, "has been justly considered not only as the original and model
of a peculiar species of composition, attempted and successfully executed by a man of great
genius, but as one of the standard works of our literature.' (43)

The account which Walpole himself gives of the circumstances which led to the composition of
"The Castle of Otranto," of his fancy of the portrait of Lord Deputy Falkland, in the gallery
at Strawberry Hill, walking Out of its frame; and of his dream of a gigantic hand in armour
on the banister of a great staircase, are well known.  Perhaps it may be objected to him, that
he makes too frequent use of supernatural machinery in his romance; but, at the time it was
written, this portion of his work was peculiarly acceptable to the public.  We have since,
from the labours of the immense tribe of his followers and imitators of different degrees of
merit, "supped so full of horrors," that we are become more fastidious upon these points; and
even, perhaps, unfairly so, as at the present moment the style of supernatural romances in
general is rather fallen again Into neglect and disfavour. "If," concludes Walter Scott, in
his criticism on this work, (and the sentiments expressed by him are so fair and just, that
it is impossible to forbear quoting them,) "Horace Walpole, who led the way in this new species
of literary composition, has been surpassed by some of his followers in diffuse brilliancy
of composition, and perhaps in the art of detaining the mind of the reader in a state of feverish
and anxious suspense through a protracted and complicated narrative, more will yet remain with
him than the single merit of originality and invention.  The applause due to chastity of style--to
a happy combination of supernatural agency with human interest-to a tone of feudal manners
and language, sustained by characters strongly marked and well discriminated,-and to unity
of action, producing scenes alternately of interest and grandeur,-the applause, in fine, which
cannot be denied to him who can excite the passions of fear and pity must be awarded to the
author of the Castle of Otranto." (44)

"The Mysterious Mother," is a production of higher talent and more powerful genius than any
other which we owe to the pen of Horace Walpole; though, from the nature of its subject, and
the sternness of its character, it is never likely to compete in popularity with many of his
other writings.  The story is too horrible almost for tragedy.  It is, as Walpole himself observes,"more
truly horrid even than that of Oedipus." He took it from a history which had been told him,
and which he thus relates: "I had heard, when very Young, that a gentlewoman, under uncommon
agonies of mind, had waited on Archbishop Tillotson, and besought his counsel.  Many years
before, a damsel that served her, had acquainted her that she was importuned by the gentlewoman's
son to grant him a private meeting.  The mother ordered the maiden to make the assignation,
when, she said, she would discover herself, and reprimand him for his criminal passion: but,
being hurried away by a much more criminal passion herself, she kept the assignation without
discovering herself. The fruit of this horrid artifice was a daughter, whom the gentlewoman
caused to be educated very privately in the country: but proving very lovely, and being accidentally
met by her father-brother, who had never had the slightest suspicion of the truth, he had fallen
in love with and actually married her.  The wretched, guilty mother, learning what had happened,
and distracted with the consequence of her crime, had now resorted to the archbishop, to know
in what manner she should act.  The prelate charged her never to let her son or daughter know
what had passed, as they were innocent of any criminal intention.  For herself he bade her
almost despair." (45) Afterwards, Walpole found out that a similar story existed in the Tales
of the Queen of Navarre, and also in Bishop Hall's works.  In this tragedy the dreadful interest
is well sustained throughout, the march of the blank verse is grand and imposing, and some
of the scenes are worked up with a vigour and a pathos, which render it one of the most powerful
dramatic efforts of which our language can boast.

The next publication of Walpole, was his "Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard
the Third," one of the most ingenious historical and antiquarian dissertations which has ever
issued from the press.  He has collected his facts with so much industry, and draws his arguments
and inferences from them with so much ability, that if he has not convinced the public of the
entire innocence of Richard, he has, at all events, diminished the number of his crimes, and
has thrown a doubt over his whole history, as well as over the credibility of his accusers,
which is generally favourable to his reputation.  This work occasioned a great sensation in
the literary world, and produced several replies, from F. Guydickens, Esq., Dean Milles, and
the Rev. Mr. Masters, and others.  These works, however, are now gathered to "the dull of ancient
days;" while the book they were intended to expose and annihilate remains an instructive and
amusing volume; and, to say the least of it, a most creditable monument of its author's ingenuity.

The remainder of the works of Walpole, published or printed in his lifetime, consist of minor,
or, as he calls them, Fugitive pieces."  Of these the most remarkable are his papers in "The
World," and other periodicals; " A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher, in London," on
the politics of the day; the "Essay on Modern Gardening;" the pamphlet called "A Counter Address,"
on the dismissal of Marshal Conway from his command of a regiment; the fanciful, but lively
"Hieroglyphic Tales;" and "The Reminiscences," or Recollections of Court and Political Anecdotes;
which last he wrote for the amusement of the Miss Berrys.  All of these are marked with those
peculiarities, and those graces of style, which belonged to him; and may still be read, however
various their subjects, with interest and instruction.  The Reminiscences are peculiarly curious;
and may, perhaps, be stated to be, both in manner and matter, the very perfection of anecdote
writing.  We may, indeed, say, with respect to Walpole, what can be advanced of but few such
voluminous authors, that it is impossible to open any part of his works without deriving entertainment
from them; so much do the charms and liveliness of his manner of writing influence all the
subjects he treats of.

Since the death of Walpole, a portion of his political Memoires, comprising the History of
the last ten years of the Reign of George the Second, has been published, and has made a very
remarkable addition to the historical information of that period. At the same time it must
be allowed, that this work has not entirely fulfilled the expectation which the public had
formed of it.  Though full of curious and interesting details; it can hardly be said to form
a very interesting whole; while in no other of the publications of the author do his prejudices
and aversions appear in so strong and unreasonable a light.  His satire also, and we might
even call it by the stronger name of abuse, is too general, and thereby loses its effect. 
Many of the characters are probably not too severely drawn; but some evidently are, and this
circumstance shakes our faith in the rest.  We must, however, remember that the age he describes
was one of peculiar corruption; and when the virtue and character of public men were, perhaps,
at a lower ebb than at any other period since the days of Charles the Second.  The admirably
graphic style of Walpole, in describing particular scenes and moments, shines forth in many
parts of the Memoires: and this, joined to his having been an actor in many of the circumstances
he relates and a near spectator of all, must ever render his book one of extreme value to the
politician and the historian.

But, the posthumous works of Walpole, upon which his lasting fame with posterity will probably
rest, are his "incomparable LETTERS." (46) Of these, a considerable portion was published in
the quarto edition of his works in 1798: since which period two quarto volumes, containing
his letters to George Montagu, Esq. and the Rev. William Cole; and another, containing those
to Lord Hertford and the Rev. Henry Zouch, have been given to the world; and the present publication
of his correspondence with Sir Horace Mann completes the series, which extends from the year
1735 to the commencement of 1797, within six weeks of his death-a period of no less than fifty-seven
years.

A friend of Mr. Walpole's has observed, that "his epistolary talents have shown our language
to be capable of all the grace and all the charms of the French of Madame de S`evign`e;" (47)
and the remark is a true one, for he is undoubtedly the author who first proved the aptitude
of our language for that light and gay epistolary style, which was before supposed peculiarly
to belong to our Gallic neighbours.  There may be letters of a higher order in our literature
than those of Walpole.  Gray's letters, and perhaps Cowper's, may be taken as instances of
this; but where shall we find such an union of taste, humour, and almost dramatic power of
description and narrative, as in the correspondence of Walpole? Where such happy touches upon
the manners and characters of the time?  Where can we find such graphic scenes, as the funeral
of George the Second; as the party to Vauxhall with Lady Harrington; as the ball at Miss Chudleigh's,
in the letters already published; or as some of the House of Commons' debates and many of the
anecdotes of society in those now offered to the world?  Walpole's style in letter-writing
is occasionally quaint, and sometimes a little laboured; but for the most part he has contrived
to throw into it a great appearance of ease, as if he wrote rapidly and without premeditation.
This, however, was by no means the case, as he took great pains with his letters, and even
collected, and wrote down beforehand, anecdotes, with a view to their subsequent insertion.
Some of these stores have been discovered among the papers at Strawberry Hill. The account
of the letters of Walpole leads naturally to some mention of his friends, to whom they were
addressed.  These were, Gray the poet, Marshal Conway, his elder brother, Lord Hertford, George
Montagu, Esq., the Rev. William Cole, Lord Strafford, Richard Bentley, Esq., John Chute, Esq.,
Sir Horace Mann, Lady Hervey, and in after-life, Mrs. Hannah More, Mrs. Damer, and the two
Miss Berrys.  His correspondence with the three latter ladies has never been published; but
his regard for them, and intimacy with them, are known to have been very great.  Towards Mrs.
Damer, the only child of the friend of his heart, Marshal Conway, he had an hereditary feeling
of affection; and to her he bequeathed Strawberry Hill.  To the Miss Berrys he left, in conjunction
with their father, the greater part of his papers, and the charge of collecting and publishing
his works, a task which they performed with great care and judgment.  To these friends must
be added the name of Richard West, Esq., a young man of great promise, (only son of Richard
West, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, by the daughter of Bishop Burnet,) who died in 1742, at the
premature age of twenty-six.

Gray had been a school friend of Walpole, as has been before mentioned, they travelled together,
and quarrelled during the Journey.  Walter Scott suggests as a reason for their differences,
"that the youthful vivacity, and perhaps aristocratic assumption, of Walpole, did not agree
with the somewhat formal opinions and habits of the professed man of letters." (48) This conjecture
may very possibly be the correct one; but we have no clue to guide us with certainty to the
causes of their rupture.  In after-life they were reconciled, though the intimacy of early
friendship never appears to have been restored between them.  (49) Scott says of Walpole, that
, his temper was precarious;" and we may, perhaps, affirm the same of Gray.  At all events,
they were persons of such different characters, that their not agreeing could not be surprising.
What could be more opposite than "the self-sequestered, melancholy Gray," and the eager, volatile
Walpole, of whom Lady Townshend said, when some one talked of his good spirits, "Oh, Mr. Walpole
is spirits of hartshorn."  When Mason was writing the life of Gray, Walpole bade him throw
the whole blame of the quarrel upon him.  This might be mere magnanimity, as Gray was then
dead; what makes one most inclined to think it was the truth, is the fact, that Gray was not
the only intimate friend of Walpole with whom he quarrelled.  He did so with Bentley, for which
the eccentric conduct of that man of talent might perhaps account.  But what shall we say to
his quarrel with the good-humoured, laughing George Montagu, with whom for the last years of
the life of the latter, he held no intercourse?  It is true, that in a letter to Mr. Cole,
Walpole lays the blame upon Montagu, and says, "he was become such an humourist;" but it must
be remembered that we do not know Montagu's version of the story; and that undoubtedly three
quarrels with three intimate friends rather support the charge, brought by Scott against Walpole,
of his having "a precarious temper."

The friendship, however, which does honour both to the head and heart of Horace Walpole, was
that which he bore to Marshal Conway; a man who, accordant to all the accounts of him that
have come down to us, was so truly worthy of inspiring such a degree of affection.  Burke's
panegyric (50)upon his public character and conduct is well-known; while the Editor of Lord
Orford's Works thus most justly eulogizes his private life. The offer of Walpole to share his
fortune with Conway, when the latter was dismissed from his places, an offer so creditable
to both parties, has been already mentioned; and if we wish to have a just idea of the esteem
in which Marshal Conway was held by his contemporaries, it is only necessary to mention, that
upon the same occasion, similar offers were pressed upon him by his brother Lord Hertford,
and by the Duke of Devonshire, without any concert between them.

The rest of' Walpole's friends and correspondents it is hardly necessary to dwell upon; they
are many of them already well known to the public from various causes. it may, however, be
permitted to observe, that, they were, for the most part, persons distinguished either by their
taste in the fine arts, their love of antiquities, their literary attainments, or their conversational
talents.  To the friends already mentioned, but with whom Walpole did not habitually correspond,
must be added, Mason the poet, George Selwyn, Richard second Lord Edgecumbe, George James Williams,
Esq.  Lady Suffolk, and Mrs. Clive the actress.

With the Marquise du Deffand, the old, blind, but clever leader of French society, he became
acquainted at Paris late in her life.  Her devotion for him appears to have been very great,
and is sometimes expressed in her letters with a warmth and tenderness, which Walpole, who
was most sensitive of ridicule, thought so absurd in a person of her years and infirmities,
that he frequently reproves her very harshly for it; so much so, as to give him the appearance
of a want of kindly feeling towards her, which his general conduct to her, and the regrets
he expressed on her death, do not warrant us in accusing him of. (51)

In concluding the literary part of the character of Walpole, it is natural to allude to the
transactions which took place between him and the unfortunate Chatterton; a text upon which
so much calumny and misrepresentation have been embroidered.  The periodicals of the day, and
the tribe of those "who daily scribble for their daily bread," and for whom Walpole had, perhaps
unwisely, frequently expressed his contempt, attacked him bitterly for his inhumanity to genius,
and even accused him as the author of the subsequent misfortunes and untimely death of that
misguided son of genius; nay, even the author of "The Pursuits of Literature," who wrote many
years after the transaction had taken place, and who ought to have known better, gave in to
the prevailing topic of abuse. (52) It therefore becomes necessary to state shortly what really
took place upon this occasion, a task which is rendered easier by the clear view of the transaction
taken both by Walter Scott in his "Lives of the Novelists," and by Chalmers in his "Biographical
Dictionary," which is also fully borne out by the narrative drawn up by Walpole himself, and
accompanied by the correspondence.

it appears then, that in March
 1769, Walpole-received a letter from Chatterton, enclosing a few
specimens of the pretended poems of Rowley, and announcing his
discovery of a series of ancient painters at Bristol.  To this
communication Walpole, naturally enough, returned a very civil
answer.  Shortly afterwards, doubts arose in his mind as to the
authenticity of the poems; these were confirmed by the opinions
of some friends, to whom he showed them; and he then wrote an
expression of these doubts to Chatterton.  This appears to have
excited the anger of Chatterton, who, after one or two short
notes, wrote Walpole a very impertinent one, in which he
redemanded his manuscripts.  This last letter Walpole had
intended to have answered with some sharpness; but did not do so.
He only returned the specimens on the 4th of August 1769; and
this concluded the intercourse between them, and as Walpole
observes, "I never saw him then, before, or since."  Subsequently
to this transaction, Chatterton acquired other patrons more
credulous than Walpole, and proceeded with his forgeries.  In
April 1770 he came to London, and committed suicide in August of
that year; a fate which befell him, it is to be feared, more in
consequence of his own dissolute and profligate habits, than from
any want of patronage.  However this may be, Walpole clearly had
nothing to say to it.

In addition to the accusation of crushing, instead of fostering his genius, Walpole has also
been charged with cruelty in not assisting him with money.  Upon this, he very truly says himself,
"Chatterton was neither indigent nor distressed, at the time of his correspondence with me.
He was maintained by his mother and lived with a lawyer.  His only pleas to my assistance were,
disgust to his profession, inclination to poetry, and communication of some suspicious MSS.
His distress was the consequence of quitting his master, and coming to London, and of his other
extravagances.  He had depended on the impulse of the talents he felt for making impression,
and lifting him to wealth, honours, and faine.  I have already said, that I should have been
blamable to his mother and society, if I had seduced an apprentice from his master to marry
him to the nine Muses;' and I should have encouraged a propensity to forgery, which is not
the talent most wanting culture in the present age." (53) Such and so unimportant was the transaction
with Chatterton, which brought so much obloquy on Walpole, and seems really to have given him
at different times great annoyance.

There remains but little more to relate in the life of Walpole. His old age glided on peacefully,
and, with the exception of his severe sufferings from the gout, apparently contentedly, in
the pursuit of his favourite studies and employments.  In the year 1791, he succeeded his unhappy
nephew, George, third Earl of Orford, who had at different periods of his life been insane,
in the family estate and the earldom.  The accession of this latter dignity seems rather to
have annoyed him than otherwise.  He never took his seat in the House of Lords, and his unwillingness
to adopt his title was shown in his endeavours to avoid making use of it in his signature.
He not unfrequently signed himself, "The Uncle of the late Earl of Orford." (54)

He retained his faculties to the last, but his limbs became helpless from his frequent attacks
of gout: as he himself expresses it,

"Fortune, who scatters her gifts out of season, Though unkind to my limbs, has yet left me
my reason." (55)

As a friend of his, who only knew him in the last years of his life, speaks of "his conversation
as singularly brilliant as it was original," (56) we may conclude his liveliness never deserted
him; that his talent for letter-writing did not, we have a proof in a letter written only six
weeks before his death, in which, with all his accustomed grace of manner he entreats a lady
of his acquaintance not to show "the idle notes of her ancient servant."-Lord Orford died in
the eightieth year `of his life, at his house in Berkeley Square, on the 2d of March 1797,
and was buried with his family in the church at Houghton and with him concluded the male line
of the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole.

(20) Originally prefixed to his lordship's edition of Walpole's Letters to Sir Horace Mann,
first published in 1833.

(21) In a MS. note by Walpole, in his own copy of collins's Peerage, it is stated, that Sir
Robert Walpole had, by his first wife, "another son, William, who died young, and a daughter,
Catherine, who died of a consumption at Bath, aged nineteen."-E.

(22) The occasion of the death of sir John Shorter was a curious one.  It is thus related in
the Ellis Correspondence:-"Sir John Shorter, the present Lord Mayor. is very ill with a fall
off his horse, under Newgate, as he was going to proclaim Bartholomew Fair.  The city custom
is, it seems, to drink always under Newgate when the Lord Mayor passes that way; and at this
time the Lord Mayor's horse, being somewhat skittish,-started at the sight of the large glittering
tankard which was reached to his lordship."  Letter of Aug. 30th, 1688.

"On Tuesday last died the Lord Mayor, Sir John Shorter: the occasion of his distemper was his
fall under Newgate, which bruised him a little, and put him into a fever."  Letter of September
6th, 1688.

(23 )birthdate)  In Chalmers's Biographical Dictionary it is stated, that Horace Walpole was
born in 1718; and Sir Walter Scott says he was born in 1716-17, which, according to the New
Style, would mean that he was born in one of the three first months of the year 1717.  Both
these statements are, however, erroneous, as he himself fixes the day of his birth, in a letter
to Mr. Conway, dated October 5th, 1764, where he says "What signifies what happens when one
is seven-and-forty, as I am to-day?  They tell me 'tis my birthday," And again, in a letter
to the same correspondent, dated October 5th, 1777, he says, "I am three-score to-day."

(24) The exact cause of this quarrel," says Mr. Mitford, in his Life of Gray, " has been passed
over by the delicacy of his biographer, because Horace Walpole was alive when the Memoirs of
Gray were written.  The former, however, charged himself with the chief blame, and lamented
that he had not paid more attention and deference to Gray's superior judgment and prudence."
See Works of Gray, vol. i. p. 9, Pickering's edition 1836.  In the "Walpolianae" is the following
passage:-"The quarrel between Gray and me arose from his being too serious a companion.  I
had just broke loose from the restraints of the University with as much money as I could spend,
and I was willing to indulge myself. Gray was for antiquities, etc. while I was for perpetual
balls and plays: the fault was mine."-E.

(25) Sir Walter Scott says that Walpole, on one occasion, " vindicated the memory of his father
with great dignity and eloquence" in the House of Commons; but, as I cannot find any trace
of a speech of this kind made by him after Sir Robert Walpole's death, I am inclined to think
Sir Walter must have made a mistake as to the time of delivery of the speech mentioned in the
text.  [Secker, at that time Bishop of Oxford, says that Walpole "spoke well against the motion."
See post, letter to Sir Horace Mann, dated March 24, 1742.

(26) Sir Walter Scott is in error when he says that Walpole retired from the House of Commons
in 1758, "at the active age of forty-one."  This event occurred, as is here stated, in March,
1768, and when Walpole was consequently in his fifty-first year.

(27) Letter, dated Arlington Street, March 12th, 1768.  It is but fair to mention, in opposition
to the opinion respecting George Grenville, here delivered by Walpole, that of no less an authority
than Burke, who says, "Mr. Grenville was a first-rate figure in this country,"

(28) He had also offered to share his fortune with Mr. Conway in the year 1744 (see letter
of July 20th of that year), in order to enable Mr. Conway to marry a lady he was then in love
with.  He ends his very pressing entreaties by saying, "For these reasons, don't deny me what
I have set my Heart on-the making your fortune easy to you." Nor were these the only instances
of generosity to a friend, which we find in the life of Walpole.  In the year 1770, when the
Abb`e Terrai was administering the finances of France, (or, to use the more expressive language
of Voltaire, "Quand Terrai nous mangeait,") his economical reductions occasioned the loss of
a portion of her pension, amounting to three thousand livres, to Madame du Deffand.  Upon this
occasion Walpole wrote thus to his old blind friend, who had presented a memorial of her case
to M. de St. Florentin, a course of proceeding which Walpole did not approve of:-"Ayez assez
d'amiti`e pour moi pour accepter les trois mille livres de ma part.  Je voudrais que la somme
ne me f`ut pas aussi indiferente qu'elle l'est, mais je vous jure qu'elle ne retranchera rien,
pas m`eme sur mes amusemens.  La prendriez vous de la main de la grandeur, et la refuseriez
vous de moi?  Vous me connaissez: faites ce sacrifice `a mon orgueil, qui serait enchants de
vous avoir emp`ech`ee de vous abaisser jusqu'`a la sollicitation. Votre m`emoire me blesse.
Quoi! vous, vous, r`eduite `a repr`esenter vos malheurs!  Accordez moi, je vous conjure, la
grace que je vous demande `a genoux, et jouissez de la satisfaction de vous dire, J'ai un ami
qui ne permettra jamais que je me jette aux pieds des grands.  Ma Petite, j'insiste. Voyez,
si vous aimez mieux me faire le plaisir le plus sensible, ou de devoir une grace qui, ayant
`et`e sollicit`ee, arrive toujours trop tard pour contanter l'amiti`e.  Laissez moi go`uter
la joie la plus pure, de vous avoir mise `a votre aise, et que cette joie soit un secret profond
entre nous deux."  See Letters of the Marquise de Deffand to the Honourable Horace Walpole.-It
was impossible to make a pecuniary offer with more earnestness or greater delicacy; and Madame
du Deffand's not having found it necessary subsequently to accept it, in no degree diminishes
the merit of the proffered gift.

(49) "In 1744, the difference between Walpole and Gray was adjusted by the interference of
a lady, who wished well to both parties.  The lapse of three years had probably been sufficient,
in some degree, to soften down, though not entirely obliterate, the remembrance of supposed
injustices on both sides; natural kindness of temper had resumed their place, and we find their
correspondence again proceeding on friendly and familiar terms." Mitford's Gray, vol. i. p.

(51) "Vanity, when it unfortunately gets possession of a wise man's head, is as keenly sensible
of ridicule, as it is impassible to its shafts when more appropriately lodged with a fool.
Of the sensitiveness arising out of this foible Walpole seems to have had a great deal, and
it certainly dictated those hard-hearted reproofs that repelled the warm effusions of friendship
with which poor Madame du Deffand (now old and blind) addressed him, and of which he complained
with the utmost indignation, merely because, if her letters were opened by a clerk at the post-office,
such expressions of kindness might expose him to the ridicule of which he had such undue terror."

REMINISCENCES OF THE COURTS OF GEORGE THE FIRST AND SECOND: WRITTEN IN 1788, FOR THE AMUSEMENT
OF MISS MARY AND MISS AGNES BERRY.

Il ne faut point d'esprit pour s'occuper des vieux `ev`enements.-Voltaire.

                                CHAPTER 1.                                                     '

You were both so entertained with the old stories I told you one evening lately, of what I
recollected to have seen and heard from my childhood of the courts of King George the First,
and of his son the Prince of Wales, afterwards George the Second, and of the latter's princess,
since Queen Caroline; and you expressed such wishes that I would commit those passages (for
they are scarce worthy of the  title even of anecdotes) to writing, that, having no greater
pleasure than to please you both, nor any more important or laudable occupation, I will begin
to satisfy the repetition of your curiosity.  But observe, I promise no more than to begin;
for I not only cannot answer that I shall have patience to continue, but my memory is still
so fresh, or rather so retentive of trifles which first made impression on it, that it is very
possible my life (turned of seventy-one) may be exhausted before my stock of remembrances;
especially as I am sensible of the garrulity of old age, and of its eagerness of relating whatever
it recollects, whether of moment or not.  Thus, while I fancy I am complying with you, I may
only be indulging myself, and consequently may wander into many digressions for which you will
not care a straw, and which may intercept the completion of my design.  Patience, therefore
young ladies; and if you coin an old gentleman into narratives, you must expect a good deal
of alloy.  I engage for no method, no regularity, no polish.  My narrative will probably resemble
siege-pieces, which are struck of any promiscuous metals; and, though they bear the impress
of some sovereign's name, only serve to quiet the garrison for the moment, and afterwards are
merely hoarded by collectors and virtuosos, who think their series not complete, unless they
have even the coins of base metal of every reign.  As I date from my nonage, I must have laid
up no state secrets. Most of the facts I am going to tell you though new to you and to most
of the present age, were known perhaps at the time to my nurse and my tutors.  Thus, my stories
will have nothing to do with history.

Luckily, there have appeared within these three months two publications, that will serve as
precedents for whatever I am going to say: I mean Les Fragments of the Correspondence of the
Duchess of Orleans, (57) and those of the M`emoires of the Duc de St. Simon. (58) Nothing more
d`ecousu than both: they tell you what they please; or rather, what their editors have pleased
to let them tell.  In one respect I shall be less satisfactory. They knew and were well acquainted,
or thought they were, with their personages.  I did not at ten years old, penetrate characters;
and as George 1. died at the period where my reminiscence begins, and was rather a good sort
of man than a shining king; and as the Duchess of Kendal was no genius, I heard very little
of either when he and her power were no more.  In fact, the reign of George 1. was little more
than the proem to the history of England Under the House of Brunswick.  That family was established
here by surmounting a rebellion; to which settlement perhaps the phrensy of the South Sea scheme
contributed, by diverting the national attention from the game of faction to the delirium of
stockjobbing; and even faction was split into fractions by the quarrel between the king and
the heir apparent-another interlude, which authorizes me to call the reign of George 1. a proem
to the history of the reigning House of Brunswick, so successively agitated by parallel feuds.

Commen`cons.

As my first hero was going off the stage before I ought to have come upon it, it will be necessary
to tell you why the said two personages happened to meet just two nights before they were to
part for ever; a rencounter that barely enables me to give you a general idea of the former's
person and of his mistress's-or, as has been supposed, his wife's.

As I was the youngest by eleven years of Sir Robert Walpole's children by his first wife, and
was extremely weak and delicate, as you see me still, though with no constitutional complaint
till I had the gout after forty, and as my two sisters were consumptive and died of consumptions,
the supposed necessary care of me (and I have overheard persons saying, "That child cannot
possibly live") so engrossed the attention of my mother, that compassion and tenderness soon
became extreme fondness; and as the infinite good-nature of my father never thwarted any of
his children, he suffered me to be too much indulged, and permitted her to gratify the first
vehement inclination that I ever expressed, and which, as I have never since felt any enthusiasm
for royal persons, I must suppose that the female attendants in the family must have put into
my head, to long to see the king. This childish caprice was so strong, that my mother solicited
the Duchess of Kendal to obtain for me the honour of kissing his Majesty's hand before he set
out for Hanover. A favour so unusual to be asked for a boy of ten years old, was still too
slight to be refused to the wife of the first minister for her darling child; yet not being
proper to be made a precedent, it was settled to be in private, and at night.

Accordingly, the night but one before the king began his last journey, my mother carried me
at ten at night to the apartment of the Countess of Walsingham, (59) on the ground floor, towards
the garden at St. James's, which opened into that of her aunt, the Duchess of Kendal's: apartments
occupied by George II. after his queen's death, and by his successive mistresses, the Countesses
of Suffolk and Yarmouth.

Notice being given that the king was come down to supper, Lady Walsingham took me alone into
the duchess's ante-room, where we found alone the king and her.  I knelt down, and kissed his
hand.  So entirely was he my object that I do not believe I once looked at the duchess; but
as I could not avoid seeing her on entering the room, I remember that just beyond his Majesty
stood a very tall, lean, ill-favoured old lady but I did not retain the least idea of her features,
nor know what the colour of her dress was.

My childish loyalty, and the condescension in gratifying it, were, I suppose, causes that contributed,
very soon afterwards, to make me shed a flood of tears for that sovereign's death, when, with
the other scholars at Eton college, I walked in procession to the proclamation of the successor;
and which (though I think they partly felt because I imagined it became the son of a prime-minister
to be more concerned than other boys) were no doubt imputed by many of the spectators who were
politicians, to fears of my father's most probable fall, but of which I had not the smallest
conception, nor should have met with any more concern than I did when it really arrived, in
the year 1742; by which time I had lost all taste for courts and princes and power, as was
natural to one who never felt an ambitious thought for himself.

It must not be inferred from her obtaining this grace for me, that the Duchess of Kendal was
a friend to my father; on the contrary, at that moment she had been labouring to displace him,
and introduce Lord Bolingbroke (61) into the administration; on which I shall say more hereafter.

It was an instance of Sir Robert's singular fortune, or evidence of his talents, that he not
only preserved his power under two successive monarchs, but in spite of the efforts of both
their mistresses (62) to remove him.  It was perhaps still more remarkable, and an instance
unparalleled, that Sir Robert governed George the First in Latin, the King not speaking English,
(63) and his minister no German, nor even French. (64) It was much talked of, that Sir Robert,
detecting one of the Hanoverian ministers in some trick or falsehood before the King'S face,
had the firmness to say to the German, "Mentiris, impudentissime!"  The good-humoured monarch
only laughed, as he often did when Sir Robert complained to him of his Hanoverians selling
places, nor would be persuaded that it was not the practice of the English court; and which
an incident must have planted in his mind with no favourable impression of English disinterestedness.
"This is a strange country!" said his Majesty; "the first morning after my arrival at St. James's,
I looked out of the window, and saw a park with walks, a canal, etc. which they told me were
mine.  The next day, Lord Chetwynd, the ranger of my park, sent me a fine brace of carp out
of my canal; and I was told I must give five guineas to Lord Chetwynd's servant for bringing
me my own carp out of my own canal in my own park!" I have said, that the Duchess of Kendal
was no friend of Sir Robert, and wished to make Lord Bolingbroke minister in his room. I was
too young to know any thing of that reign, nor was acquainted with the political cabals of
the court, which, however, I might have learnt from my father in the three years after his
retirement; but being too thoughtless at that time, nor having your laudable curiosity, I neglected
to inform myself of many passages and circumstances, of which I have often since regretted
my faulty ignorance.

By what I can at present recollect, the Duchess seems to have been jealous of Sir Robert's
credit with the King, which he had acquired, not by paying court, but by his superior abilities
in the House of Commons, and by his knowledge in finance, of which Lord Sunderland and Craggs
had betrayed their ignorance in countennancing the South Sea scheme; and who, though more agreeable
to the King, had been forced to give way to Walpole, as the only man capable of repairing that
mischief.  The Duchess, too, might be alarmed at his attachment to the Princess of Wales; from
whom, in case of the King's death, her grace could expect no favour.  Of her jealousy I do
know the following instance; Queen Anne had bestowed the rangership of Richmond New Park on
her relations the Hydes for three lives, one of which was expired. King George, fond of shooting,
bought out the term of the last Earl of Clarendon, and of his son Lord Cornbury, and frequently
shot there; having appointed my eldest brother, Lord Walpole, ranger nominally, but my father
in reality, wished to hunt there once or twice a week.  The park had run to great decay under
the Hydes, nor was there any mansion (65) better than the common lodges of the keepers.  The
King ordered a stone lodge designed by Henry, Earl of Pembroke, to be erected for himself,
but merely as a banqueting-house, (66) with a large eating-room, kitchen, and necessary offices,
where he might dine after his sport. Sir Robert began another of brick for himself, and the
under-ranger, which by degrees, he much enlarged; usually retiring thither from business, or
rather, as he said himself, to do more business than he could in town, on Saturdays and Sundays.
On that edifice, on the thatched-house, and other improvements, he laid out fourteen thousand
pounds of his own money.  In the meantime, he hired a small house for himself on the hill without
the park; and in that small tenement the King did him the honour of dining with him more than
once after shooting.  His Majesty, fond of private joviality, (67) was pleased with punch after
dinner, and indulged in it freely.  The Duchess, alarmed at the advantage the minister might
make of the openness of the King's heart in those convivial, unguarded hours, and at a crisis
when she was conscious Sir Robert was apprised of her inimical machinations in favour of Lord
Bolingbroke, enjoined the few Germans who accompanied the King at those dinners to prevent
his Majesty from drinking too freely.  Her spies obeyed too punctually, and without any address.
The King was offended, and silenced the tools by the coarsest epithets in the German language.
He even, before his departure, ordered Sir Robert to have the stone lodge finished against
his return: no symptom of a falling minister, as has since been supposed Sir Robert then was,
and that Lord Bolingbroke was to have replaced him, had the King lived to come back.  But my
presumption to the contrary is more strongly corroborated by what had recently passed: the
Duchess had actually prevailed on the King to see Bolingbroke secretly in his closet.  That
intriguing Proteus, aware that he might not obtain an audience long enough to efface former
prejudices, and make sufficient impression on the King against Sir Robert, and in his own favour,
went provided with a memorial, which he left in the closet. and begged his Majesty to peruse
coolly at his leisure. The King kept the paper, but no longer than till he saw Sir Robert,
to whom he delivered the poisoned remonstrance.  If that communication prognosticated the minister's
fall, I am at a loss to know what a mark of confidence is.

Nor was that discovery the first intimation that Walpole had received of the measure of Bolingbroke's
gratitude.  The minister, against the earnest representations of his family and Most intimate
friends, had consented to the recall of that incendiary from banishment, (68) excepting only
his readmission into the House of Lords, that every field of annoyance might not be open to
his mischievous turbulence.  Bolingbroke, it seems, deemed an embargo laid on his tongue would
warrant his hand to launch every envenomed shaft against his benefactor, who by restricting
had paid him the compliment of avowing that his eloquence was not totally inoffensive.  Craftsmen,
pamphlet, libels, combinations, were showered on or employed for years against the prime-minister,
without shaking his power or ruffling his temper; and Bolingbroke had the mortification of
finding his rival had abilities to maintain his influence against the mistresses of two kings,
with whom his antagonist had plotted in vain to overturn him. (69)

(57) Charlotte Elizabeth, daughter of the Elector of Bavaria.  In 1671 she became the second
wife (his first being poisoned) of the brother of Louis XIV. by whom she was the mother of
the regent, Duke of Orleans.  She died in 1722.  A collection of her letters, addressed to
Prince Ulric of Brunswick, and to the Princess of Wales, afterwards Queen Caroline, was published
at Paris in 1788.-E.

(58) These celebrated M`emoires of the Court of Louis XIV. were first published, in a mutilated
state, in 1788.  A complete edition, in thirteen volumes, appeared in 1791.-E.

(59) Melusina Schulemberg, niece of the Duchess of Kendal, created Countess of Walsingham and
-,afterwards married to the famous Philip Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield.

(60) The following is the account of this introduction given in "Walpoliana:"-"I do remember
something of George the First.  My father took me to St. James's while I was a very little
boy; after waiting some time in an anteroom, a gentleman came in all dressed in brown, even
his stockings, and with a riband and star. He took me up in his arms, kissed me, and chatted
some time,"-E.

(61) The well-known Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, secretary of state to Queen Anne;
on whose death he fled, and was attainted. ["We have the authority of Sir Robert Walpole himself,"
says Coxe, "that the restoration of Lord Bolingbroke was the work of the Duchess of Kendal.
He gained the duchess by a present of eleven thousand pounds, and obtained a promise to use
her influence over the King, for the purpose of forwarding his complete restoration."]

(62) The Duchess of Kendal and Lady Suffolk.

(63) Sir Robert was frequently heard to say, that during the reign of the first George, he
governed the kingdom by means of bad Latin: it is a matter of wonder that, under such disadvantages.
the King should take pleasure in transacting business with him: a circumstance which was principally
owing to the method and perspicuity of his calculations, and to the extreme facility with which
he arranged and explained the most abstruse and difficult combinations of finance." Coxe.-E.

(64) Prince William, afterwards Duke of Cumberland, then a child, being carried to big grandfather
on his birthday, the King asked him at what hour he rose.  The Prince replied, "when the chimney-sweepers
went about."  "Vat is de chimney-sweeper?" said the King.  "Have you been so long in England,"
said the boy, "and do not know what a chimney-sweeper is?  Why, they are like that man there;"
pointing to Lord Finch, afterwards Earl of Winchilsea and Nottingham, of a family uncommonly
swarthy and dark-"the black funereal Finches"-Sir Charles Williams's Ode to a Number of Great
Men, 1742.

(65) The Earl of Rochester, who succeeded to the title of Clarendon on the extinction of the
elder branch, had a villa close without the park; but it had been burnt down, and only one
wing was left.  W. Stanhope, Earl of Harrington, purchased the ruins, and built the house,
since bought by Lord Camelford.

(66) It was afterwards enlarged by Princess Amelia; to whom her rather, George II. had granted
the reversion of the rangership after Lord Walpole.  Her Royal Highness sold it to George III.
for a pension on Ireland of twelve hundred pounds a-year, and his Majesty appointed Lord Bute
ranger for life.

(67) The King Hated the parade of royalty.  When he went to the opera, it was in no state;
nor did he sit in the stage-box, nor forwards, but behind the Duchess of Kendal and Lady Walsingham,
in the second box, now allotted to the maids of honour.

(68) Bolingbroke at his return could not avoid waiting on Sir Robert to thank him, and was
Invited to dine with him at Chelsea; but whether tortured at witnessing Walpole's serene frankness
and felicity, or suffocated with indignation and confusion at being forced to be obliged to
one whom be hated and envied, the first morsel he put into his mouth was near choking him,
and he was reduced to rise from table and leave the room for some minutes. I never heard of
their meeting more.

(69) George II. parted with Lady Suffolk, on Princess Amelia informing Queen Caroline from
Bath, that the mistress had interviews there with Lord Bolingbroke.  Lady Suffolk, above twenty
years after, protested to me that she had not once seen his lordship there; and I should believe
she did not, for she was a woman of truth: but her great intimacy and connexion with Pope and
Swift, the intimate friends of Bolingbroke, even before the death of George I. and her being
the channel through whom that faction had flattered themselves they should gain the ear of
the new King, can leave no doubt of Lady Suffolk's support of that party.  Her dearest friend
to her death was William, afterwards Lord Chetwynd, the known and most trusted confidant of
Lord Bolingbroke.  Of those political intrigues I shall say more in these Reminiscences.

George the First, while Electoral Prince, had married his cousin, the Princess Dorothea (70)
only child of the Duke of Zell; a match of convenience to reunite the dominions of the family.
Though she was very handsome, the Prince, who was extremely amorous, had several mistresses;
which provocation, and his absence in the army of the confederates, probably disposed the Princess
to indulge some degree of coquetry.  At that moment arrived at Hanover the famous and beautiful
Count Konigsmark, (71) the charms of whose person ought not to have obliterated the memory
of his vile assassination of Mr. Thynne.(72)His vanity, the beauty of the Electoral Princess,
and the neglect under which he found her, encouraged his presumption to make his addresses
to her, not covertly; and she, though believed not to have transgressed her duty, did receive
them too indiscreetly.  The old Elector flamed at the insolence of so stigmatized a pretender,
and ordered him to quit his dominions the next day. The Princess, surrounded by women too closely
connected with her husband, and consequently enemies of the lady they injured, was persuaded
by them to suffer the count to kiss her hand before his abrupt departure and he was actually
introduced by them into her bedchamber the next morning before she rose.  From that moment
he disappeared nor was it known what became of him, till on the death of George I., on his
son the new King's first journey to Hanover, some alterations in the palace being ordered by
him, the body of Konigsmark was discovered under the floor of the Electoral Princess's dressing-room-the
Count having probably been strangled there the instant he left her, and his body secreted.
The discovery was hushed up; George II. entrusted the secret to his wife, Queen Caroline, who
told it to my father: but the King was too tender of the honour of his mother to utter it to
his mistress; nor did Lady Suffolk ever hear of it, till I informed her of it several years
afterwards.  The disappearance of the Count made his murder suspected, and various reports
of the discovery of his body have of late years been spread, but not with the authentic circumstances.
The second George loved his mother as much as he hated his father, and purposed, as was said,
had the former survived, to have brought her over and declared her Queen Dowager. (73)  Lady
Suffolk has told me her surprise, on going to the new Queen the morning after the news arrived
of the death of George I., at seeing hung up in the Queen's dressing-room a whole length of
a lady in royal robes; and in the bedchamber a half length of the same person, neither of which
Lady Suffolk had ever seen before.  The Prince had kept them concealed, not daring to produce
them during the life of his father.  The whole length he probably sent to Hanover: (74) the
half length I have frequently and frequently seen in the library of Princess Amelia, who told
me it was the portrait of her grandmother. she bequeathed it, with other pictures of her family,
to her nephew, the Landgrave of Hesse.

Of the circumstances that ensued on Konigsmark's disappearance I am ignorant; nor am I acquainted
with the laws of Germany relative to divorce or separation: nor do I know or suppose that despotism
and pride allow the law to insist on much formality when a sovereign has reason or mind to
get rid of his wife. Perhaps too much difficulty of untying the Gordian not of matrimony thrown
in the way of an absolute prince would be no kindness to the ladies, but might prompt him to
use a sharper weapon, like that butchering husband, our Henry VIII. Sovereigns, who narrow
or let out the law of God according to their prejudices and passions, mould their own laws
no doubt to the standard of their convenience.  Genealogic purity of blood is the predominant
folly of Germany; and the code of Malta seems to have more force in the empire than the ten
commandments.  Thence was introduced that most absurd evasion of the indissolubility of marriage,
espousals with the left hand-as if the Almighty had restrained his ordinance to one half of
a man's person, and allowed a greater latitude to his left side than to his right, or pronounced
the former more ignoble than the latter.  The consciences both of princely and noble persons
in Germany are quieted, if the more plebeian side is married to one who would degrade the more
illustrious moiety-but, as if the laws of matrimony had no reference to the children to be
thence propagated, the children of a left-handed alliance are not entitled to inherit.  Shocking
consequence of a senseless equivocation, that only satisfies pride, not justice; and calculated
for an acquittal at the herald's Office, not at the last tribunal.

Separated the Princess Dorothea certainly was, and never admitted even to the nominal honours
of her rank, being thenceforward always styled Duchess of Halle.  Whether divorced (75) is
problematic, at least to me; nor can I pronounce, as, though it was generally believed, I am
not certain that George espoused the Duchess of Kendal with his left hand.  As the Princess
Dorothea died only some months before him, that ridiculous ceremony was scarcely deferred till
then; and the extreme outward devotion of the Duchess, who every Sunday went seven times to
Lutheran chapels, seemed to announce a realized wife.  As the genuine wife was always detained
in her husband's power, he seems not to have wholly dissolved their union; for, on the approach
of the French army towards Hanover, during Queen Anne's reign, the Duchess of Halle was sent
home to her father and mother, who doted on their only child, and did retain her for a whole
year, and did implore, though in vain that she might continue to reside with them.  As her
son too, George II., had thoughts of bringing her over and declaring her Queen Dowager, one
can hardly believe that a ceremonial divorce had passed, the existence of which process would
have glared in the face of her royalty.  But though German casuistry might allow her husband
to take another wife with his left hand, because his legal wife had suffered her right hand
to be kissed in bed by a gallant, even Westphalian or Aulic counsellors could not have pronounced
that such a momentary adieu constituted adultery; and therefore of a formal divorce I must
doubt-and there I must leave that case of conscience undecided, till future search into the
Hanoverian chancery shall clear up a point of little real importance.

I have said that the disgraced Princess died but a short time before the King. (76) It is known
that in Queen Anne's time there was much noise about French prophets.  A female of that vocation
(for we know from Scripture that the gift of prophecy is not limited to one gender) warned
George I. to take care of his wife, as he would not survive her a year.  That oracle was probably
dictated to the French Deborah by the Duke and Duchess of Zell, 'who might be apprehensive
lest the' Duchess of Kendal should be tempted to remove entirely the obstacle to her conscientious
union with their son-in-law.  Most Germans are superstitious, even such as have few other impressions
of religion.  George gave such credit to the denunciation, that on the eve of his last departure
he took leave of his son and the Princess of Wales with tears, telling them he should never
see them more.  It was certainly his own approaching fate that melted him, not the thought
of quitting for ever two persons he hated.  He did sometimes so much justice to his son as
to say, "Il est fougueux, mais il a de l'honneur."-For Queen Caroline, to his confidants he
termed her "cette diablesse Madame la Princesse."

I do not know whether it was about the same period, that in a tender mood he promised the Duchess
of Kendal, that if she survived him, and it were possible for the departed to return to this
world, he would make her a visit.  The Duchess, on his death, so much expected the accomplishment
of that engagement, that a large raven, or some black fowl, flying into one of the windows
of her villa at Isteworth, she was persuaded it was the soul of her departed monarch so accoutred,
and received and treated it with all the respect and tenderness of duty, till the royal bird
or she took their last flight.

George II., no more addicted than his father to too much religious credulity, had yet implicit
faith in the German notion of vampires, and has more than once been angry with my father for
speaking irreverently of those imaginary bloodsuckers.

the Duchess of Kendal, of whom I have said so much, was when Mademoiselle Schulemberg, maid
of honour to the Electress Sophia, mother of King George I. and destined by King William and
the Act of Settlement to succeed Queen Anne.  George fell in love with Mademoiselle Schulemberg,
though by no means an inviting object-so little, that one evening when she was in waiting behind
the Electress's chair at a ball, the Princess Sophia, who had made herself mistress of the
language of her future subjects, said in English to Mrs. Howard, afterwards Countess of Suffolk,
then at her court, "Look at that mawkin, and think of her being my son's passion!"  Mrs. Howard,
who told me the story, protested that she was terrified, forgetting that Mademoiselle Schulemberg
did not understand English.

The younger Mademoiselle Schulemberg, who came over with her and was created Countess Walsingham,
passed for her niece; but was so like to the King that it is not very credible that the Duchess,
who had affected to pass for cruel, had waited for the left-handed marriage.

The Duchess under whatever denomination, had attained and preserved to the last her ascendant
over the king: but notwithstanding that influence, he was not more constant to her than he
had been to his avowed wife; for another acknowledged mistress, whom he also brought over,
was Madame Kilmansegge, Countess of Platen, who was created Countess of Darlington, and by
whom he was indisputably father of Charlotte, married to Lord Viscount Howe, and mother of
the present earl. (77) Lady Howe was never publicly acknowledged as the Kings daughter; but
Princess Amelia, (78) treated her daughter, Mrs. Howe, (79) upon that foot, and one evening,
when I was present, gave her a ring, with a small portrait of George I, with a crown of diamonds.

Lady Darlington, whom I saw at my mother's in my infancy, and whom I remember by being terrified
at her enormous figure, was as corpulent and ample as the Duchess was long and emaciated. 
They were food from all the venom of the Jacobites; and, indeed nothing could be grosser than
the ribaldry that was vomited out in lampoons, libels, and every channel of abuse, against
the sovereign and the new court, and chaunted even in their hearing about the public streets. (81)

On the other hand, it was not till the last year or two of his reign that their foreign sovereign
paid the nation the compliment of taking openly an English mistress.  That personage was Anne
Brett, eldest daughter by her second husband, (82) of the repudiated wife of the Earl Of Macclesfield,
the unnatural mother of Savage the poet.  Miss Brett was very handsome, but dark enough by
her eyes, complexion, and hair, for a Spanish beauty. Abishag was lodged in the palace under
the eyes of Bathsheba, who seemed to maintain her power, as other favourite sultanas have done,
by suffering partners in the sovereign's affections.  When his Majesty should return to England,
a countess's coronet was to have rewarded the young lady's compliance, and marked her secondary
rank.  She might, however, have proved a troublesome rival, as she seemed SO confident of the
power of her charms, that whatever predominant ascendant the Duchess might retain, her own
authority in the palace she thought was to yield to no one else.  George I., when his son the
Prince of Wales and the Princess had quitted St. James's on their quarrel with him, had kept
back their three eldest daughters, who lived with him to his death, even after there had outwardly
been a reconciliation between the King and Prince.  Miss Brett, when the King set out, ordered
a door to be broken out of her apartment into the royal garden.  Anne, the eldest of the Princesses,
offended at that freedom, and not choosing such a companion in her walks, ordered the door
to be walled up again.  Miss Brett as imperiously reversed that command. The King died suddenly,
and the empire of the new mistress and her promised coronet vanished.  She afterwards married
Sir William Leman, and was forgotten before her reign had transpired beyond the confines of
Westminster! (70)  Her names were Sophia Dorothea ; but I call her by the latter, to distinguish
her from the Princess Sophia, her mother-in-law, on whom the crown of Great Britain was settled.
(71) Konigsmark behaved with great intrepidity, and was wounded at a bull-feast in Spain. 
See Letters from Spain of the Contesse D'Anois, vol. ii.  He was brother of the beautiful Comtesse
de Konigsmark, mistress of Augustus the Second, King of Poland. (72) It was not this Count
Konigsmark, but an elder brother, who was accused of having suborned Colonel Vratz, Lieutenant
Stern, and one George Boroskey, to murder Mr. Thynne in Pall-Mall, on the 12th of February,
1682, and for which they were executed in that street on the 10th of March.  For the particulars,
see Howell's State Trials, vol. ix. p. 1, and Sir John Reresby's Memoirs, p. 135. "This day,"
says Evelyn, in his Diary of the 10th of March, "was executed Colonel Vrats, for the execrable
murder of Mr. Thynne, set on by the principal, Konigsmark: he went to execution like an undaunted
hero, as one that had done a friendly office for that base coward, Count Konigsmark, who had
hopes to marry his widow, the rich Lady Ogle, and was acquitted by a corrupt jury, and so got
away: Vrats told a friend of mine, who accompanied him to the gallows, and gave him some advice,
that he did not value dying of a rush, and hoped and believed God would deal with him like
a gentleman." Mr. Thynne was buried in Westminster Abbey; the manner of his death being represented
on his monument.  He was the Issachar of Absalom and Achitophel; in which poem Dryden, describing
the respect and favour with which Monmouth was received upon his progress in the year 1691,
Says: "Hospitable hearts did most commend Wise Issachar, his wealthy, western friend."

Reresby states, that Lady Ogle, immediately after the marriage, "repenting herself of the match,
fled from him into Holland, before they were bedded." This circumstance added to the fact,
that Mr. Thynne had formerly seduced Miss Trevor, one of the maids of honour to Catherine of
Portugal, wife of Charles II., gave birth to the following lines:

"Here lies Tom Thynne, of Longleat Hall, Who never would have miscarried, Had he married the
woman he lay withal, Or lain with the woman he married."

On the 30th of May, in the same year, Lady Ogle was married to Charles Seymour, Duke of Somerset.-E.

(73) Lady Suffolk thought he rather would have her regent of Hanover; and she also told me,
that George I. had offered to live again with his wife, but she refused, unless her pardon
were asked publicly.  She said, what most affected her was the disgrace that would be brought
on her children; and if she were only pardoned, that would not remove it. Lady Suffolk thought
she was then divorced, though the divorce was never published; and that the old Elector consented
to his son's marrying the Duchess of Kendal with the left hand-but it seems strange, that George
I. should offer to live again with his wife, and yet be divorced front her.  Perhaps George
II. to vindicate his mother, supposed that offer and her spirited refusal.

(74) George II. was scrupulously exact in separating and keeping in each country whatever belonged
to England or Hanover.  Lady Suffolk told me, that on his accession he could not find a knife,
fork, and spoon of gold which had belonged to Queen Ann(@, and which he remembered to have
seen here at his first -arrival.  He found them at Hanover on his first journey thither after
he came to the crown, and brought them back to England.  He could not recollect much of greater
value; for, on Queen Anne's death, and in the interval before the arrival of the new family,
such a clearance had been made of her Majesty's jewels, or the new King so instantly distributed
what he found amongst his German favourites, that, as Lady S. told me, Queen Caroline never
obtained of the late Queen's.jewels but one pearl necklace.

(75) George I., says Coxe, who never loved his wife, gave implicit credit to the account of
her infidelity, as related by his father; consented to her imprisonment, and obtained from
the ecclesiastical consistory a divorce, which was passed on the 28th of December 1694." Memoirs
of Walpole.-E.

(76) "the unfortunate Sophia was confined in the castle of Alden, situated on the small river
Aller, in the duchy of Zell.  She terminated her miserable existence, after a long captivity
of thirty-two years, on the 13th of November 1726, only seven months before the death of George
the First; and she was announced in the Gazette, under the title of the Electress Dowager of
Hanover. During her whole confinement she behaved with no less mildness than dignity; and,
on receiving the sacrament once every week, never omitted making the most solemn asseverations,
that she was not guilty of the crime laid to her charge." Coxe, vol. i. p. 268.-E.

(78) Second daughter of George the Second; born in 1711, died October the 31st, 1786.

(79) Caroline, the eldest of Lady Howe's children, had married a gentleman of her own name,
John Howe, Esq, of Honslop, in the county of Bucks.

(80) According to Coxe, she was, when young, a woman of great beauty, but became extremely
corpulent as she advanced in years. "Her power over the King," he adds, "was not equal to that
of the Duchess of Kendal, but her character for rapacity was not inferior." On the death of
her husband, in 1721, she was created Countess of Leinster in the kingdom of Ireland, Baroness
of Brentford, and Countess of Darlington.-E.

(81)  One of the German ladies, being abused by the mob, was said to have put her head out
of the coach, and cried in bad English, "Good people, why you abuse us?  We come for all your
goods." "Yes, damn ye," answered a fellow in the crowd, "and for all our chattels too." I mention
this because on the death of Princess Amelia the newspapers revived the story and told it of
her, though I had heard it threescore years before of one of her grandfather's mistresses.

(82) Colonel Brett, the companion of Wycherley, Steele, Davenant, etc. and of whom the following
particulars are recorded by Spence, on the authority of Dr. Young:-"The Colonel was a remarkably
handsome man.  The Countess looking out of her window on a great disturbance in the street,
saw him assaulted by some bailiffs, who were going to arrest him.  She paid his debt, released
him from their pursuit, and soon after married him. When she died, she left him more than he
expected; with which he bought an estate in the country, built a very handsome house upon it,
and furnished it in the highest taste; went down to see the finishing of it, returned to London
in hot weather and in too much hurry; got a fever by it, and died.  Nobody had a better taste
of what would please the town, and his opinion was much regarded by the actors and dramatic
poets." Anecdotes, p. 355.-E.

                               CHAPTER III.

One of the most remarkable occurrences in the reign of George I. was the open quarrel between
him and his son the Prince of Wales. Whence the dissension originated; whether the prince's
attachment to his mother embittered his mind against his father, or whether hatred of' his
father occasioned his devotion to her, I do not pretend to know.  I do suspect front circumstances,
that the hereditary enmity in the House of Brunswick between the parents and their eldest sons
dated earlier than the divisions between the first two Georges.  The Princess Sophia was a
woman of parts and great vivacity: in the earlier part of her life she had professed much zeal
for the deposed House of Stuart, as appeared by a letter of hers in print, addressed to the
Chevalier de St. George.  It is natural enough for all princes,-who have no prospect of being
benefited by the deposition of a crowned head, to choose to think royalty an indelible character.
The Queen of Prussia, daughter of George I. lived and died an avowed Jacobite. The Princess
Sophia, youngest child of the Queen of Bohemia, was consequently the most remote from any pretensions
to the British crown; (83) but no sooner had King William procured a settlement of it after
Queen Anne on her Electoral Highness, than nobody became a stancher Whig than the Princess
Sophia, nor could be more impatient to mount the throne of the expelled Stuarts.  It is certain,
that during the reign of Anne, the Elector George was inclined to the Tories, though-after
his mother's death and his own accession he gave himself to the opposite party.  But if be
and his mother espoused different factions, Sophia found a ready partisan in her grandson,
the Electoral prince; (84) and it is true, that the demand made by the Prince of his writ of
summons to the House of Lords as Duke of Cambridge, which no wonder was so offensive to Queen
Anne, was made in concert with his grandmother, without the privity of the Elector his father.
Were it certain, as was believed, that Bolingbroke and the Jacobites prevailed on the Queen
*85) to consent to her brother coming secretly to England, and to seeing him in her closet;
she might have been induced to that step, when provoked by an attempt to force a distant and
foreign heir upon her while still alive. The Queen and her heiress being dead, the new King
and his son came over in apparent harmony; and on his Majesty's first visit to his electoral
dominions, the Prince of Wales was even left Regent; but never being trusted afterwards with
that dignity on like occasions, it is probable that the son discovered too much fondness for
acting the king, or that the father conceived a jealousy of his son having done so.  Sure it
is, that on the King's return great divisions arose in the court; and the Whigs were divided-some
devoting themselves to the wearer of the crown, and others to the expectant.  I shall not enter
into the detail of those squabbles, of which I am but superficially informed. The predominant
ministers were the Earls of Sunderland and Stanhope.  The brothers-in-law, the Viscount Townshend
and Mr. Robert Walpole, adhered to the Prince.  Lord Sunderland is said to have too much resembled
as a politician the earl his father, who was so principal an actor in the reign of James II.
and in bringing about the Revolution.  Between the earl in question and the Prince of Wales
grew mortal antipathy; of which -,in anecdote told me by my father himself will leave no doubt.
When a reconciliation had been patched up between the two courts, and my father became first
lord of the treasury a second time, Lord Sunderland in a t`ete-`a-t`ete with him said, "Well,
Mr. Walpole, we have settled matters for the present; but we must think whom we shall have
next" (meaning in case of the King's demise). Walpole said, "Your lordship may think as you
please, but my part is taken;" meaning to support the established settlement.

Earl Stanhope was a man of strong and violent passions, and had dedicated himself to the army;
and was so far from thinking of any other line, that when Walpole, who first suggested the
idea of appointing him secretary of state, proposed it to him, he flew into a furious rage,
and was on the point of a downright quarrel, looking on himself' as totally unqualified for
the post, and suspecting it for a plan of mocking him.  He died in one of those tempestuous
sallies, being pushed in the House of Lords on the explosion of the South Sea scheme.  That
iniquitous affair, which Walpole had early exposed, and to remedy the mischiefs of which he
alone was deemed adequate, had replaced him at the head of affairs, and obliged Sunderland
to submit to be only a coadjutor of the administration.  The younger Craggs, (86) a showy vapouring
man, had been brought forward by the ministers to oppose Walpole; but was soon reduced to beg
his assistance on one (87) of their ways and means.  Craggs caught his death by calling at
the gate of Lady March, (88) who was ill of the small-pox; and being told so by the porter,
went home directly, fell ill of the same distemper, and died.  His father, the elder Craggs,
whose very good sense Sir R. Walpole much admired, soon followed his son, and his sudden death
was imputed to grief; but having been deeply dipped in the iniquities of the South Sea, and
wishing to prevent confiscation and save his ill-acquired wealth for his daughters, there was
no doubt of his having despatched himself. When his death was divulged, Sir Robert Owned that
the unhappy man had in an oblique manner hinted his resolution to him. The reconciliation of
the royal family was so little cordial, that I question whether the Prince did not resent Sir
Robert Walpole's return to the King's service.  Yet had Walpole defeated a plan of Sunderland
that @would in future have exceedingly hampered the successor, as it was calculated to do;
nor do I affect to ascribe Sir Robert's victory directly to zeal for the Prince: personal and
just views prompted his opposition, and the commoners of England were not less indebted to
him than the Prince.  Sunderland had devised a bill to restrain the crown from ever adding
above six peers to a number limited., (89) The actual peers were far from disliking the measure;
but Walpole, taking fire, instantly communicated his dissatisfaction to all the great commoners,
who might for ever be excluded from the peerage.  He spoke, he wrote, (90) he persuaded, and
the bill was rejected by the Commons with disdain, after it had passed the House of Lords. (91)

But the hatred of some of the junta at court had gone farther, horribly farther.  On the death
of George 1. Queen Caroline found in his cabinet a proposal of the Earl of Berkeley, (92) then,
I think, first lord of the admiralty, to seize the Prince of Wales, and convey him to America,
whence he should never be heard of more.  This detestable project copied probably from the
Earl of Falmouth's offer to Charles II. with regard to his Queen, was in the handwriting of
Charles Stanhope, elder brother of the Earl of Harrington: (93) and so deep was the impression
deservedly made on the mind of George II. by that abominable paper, that all the favour of
Lord Harrington, when secretary of state, could never obtain the smallest boon to his brother,
though but the subordinate transcriber. (94) George I. was too humane to listen to such an
atrocious deed.  It was not very kind to the conspirators to leave such an instrument behind
him; and if virtue and conscience will not check bold bad men from paying court by detestable
offers, the King's carelessness or indifference in such an instance ought to warn them of the
little gratitude that such machinations can inspire or expect.

Among those who had preferred the service of the King to that of the heir apparent, was the
Duke of Newcastle;, (95) Who, having married his sister to Lord Townshend, both his royal highness
and the viscount had expected would have adhered to that connexion-and neither forgave his
desertion.-I am aware of the desultory manner in which I have told my story, having mentioned
the reconciliation of the King and Prince before I have given any account of their public rupture.
The chain of my thoughts led me into the preceding details, and, if I do not flatter myself,
will have let you into the motives of my dramatis personae better than if I had 'more exactly
observed chronology.- and as I am not writing a regular tragedy, and profess but to relate
facts as I recollect them; or (if you will allow me to imitate French writers of tragedy) may
I not plead that I have unfolded my piece as they do, by introducing two courtiers to acquaint
one another, and by bricole the audience, with what had passed in the penetralia before the
tragedy commences?

The exordium thus duly prepared, you must suppose, ladies, that the second act opens with a
royal christening The Princess of Wales had been delivered of a second son.  The Prince had
intended his uncle, the Duke of York, Bishop of Osnaburg, should with his Majesty be godfathers.
Nothing could equal the indignation of his Royal Highness when the King named the Duke of Newcastle
for second sponsor, and would hear of no other.  The christening took place as usual in the
Princess's bedchamber. Lady Suffolk, then in waiting as woman of the bedchamber, and of most
accurate memory painted the scene to me exactly.  On one side of the bed stood the godfathers
and godmother; on the other the Prince and the Princess's ladies.  No sooner had the Bishop
closed the ceremony, than the Prince, crossing the feet of the bed in a rage, stepped up to
the Duke of Newcastle, and, holding up his hand and fore-finger in a menacing attitude, said,
"You are a rascal, but I shall find you," meaning, in broken English, "I shall find a time
to be revenged."-"What was my astonishment," continued Lady Suffolk, "when going to the Princess's
apartment the next morning, the yeOMen in the guard-chamber pointed their halberds at my breast,
and told me I must not pass! I urged that it was my duty to attend the Princess.  They said,
'No matter; I must not pass that way.'"

In one word, the King had been so provoked at the Prince's outrage in his presence, that it
had been determined to inflict a still greater insult on his Royal Highness.  His threat to
the Duke was pretended to be understood as a challenge; and to prevent a duel he had actually
been put under arrest-as if a Prince of Wales could stoop to fight with a subject.  The arrest
was soon taken off; but at night the Prince and Princess were ordered to leave the palace,
(96) and retired to the house of her chamberlain, the Earl of Grantham, in Albemarle Street.

(83) It is remarkable, that either the weak propensity of the Stuarts to popery, or the visible
connexion between regal and ecclesiastic power, had such operation on many of the branches
of that family, who were at a distance from the crown of England, to wear which it is necessary
to be a Protestant, that two or three of the daughters of the king and Queen of Bohemia, though
their parents had lost every thing in the struggle between the two religions, turned Roman
Catholics; and so did one or more of the sons of the Princess Sophia, brothers of the Protestant
candidate, George I.

(84) Afterwards George II.

(85) I believe it was a fact, that the poor weak Queen, being disposed even to cede the crown
to her brother, consulted Bishop Wilkins, called the Prophet, to know what would be the consequence
of such a step.  He replied, "Madam, you would be in the Tower in a month, and dead in three."
This Sentence, dictated by common sense, her Majesty took for inspiration, and dropped all
thoughts of resigning the crown.

*86) James Craggs, Jun, buried in Westminster Abbey, with an epitaph by Pope.  [Craggs died
on the 16th of February, 1721. His monument was executed by Guelphi, whom Lord Burlington invited
into the kingdom.  Walpole considered it graceful and simple, but that the artist was an indifferent
sculptor.  Dr. Johnson objects to Pope's inscription, that it is partly in Latin and partly
in English.

(88) Sarah Cadogan, afterwards Duchess of Richmond.

(89) Queen Anne's creation of twelve peers at once, to obtain a majority in the House of Lords,

of the Lower House, in relation to a project for restraining and limiting the powers of the
Crown in the future creation of Peers." On the other side, Addison's pen was employed in defending
the measure, in a paper called "The Old Whig," against Steele, who attacked it in a pamphlet
entitled "The Plebeian."-E.

(91) The effect of Sir Robert's speech on the House," says Coxe, "exceeded the sanguine expectations:
it fixed those who had before been wavering and irresolute, brought over many who had been
tempted by the speciousness of the measure to favour introduction, and procured its rejection,
by a triumphant majority of 269 against 177."  Memoirs, Vol. i.-E.

(93) William Stanhope, first Earl of Harrington of that family.

(94) Coxe states, that such was the indignation which the perusal of this paper excited, that,
when Sir Robert espoused Charles Stanhope's interest, the King rejected the application with
some expressions of resentment, and declared that no consideration should induce him to assign
to him any place of trust or honour.- E.

                                CHAPTER IV.

As this trifling work is a miscellany of detached recollections, I will, ere I quit the article
of George I., mention two subjects of very unequal import, which belong peculiarly to his reign.
The first was the deprivation of Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester. Nothing more offensive to
men of priestly principles could easily have happened: yet, as in a country of which the constitution
was founded on rational and liberal grounds, and where thinking men had so recently exerted
themselves to explode the prejudices attached to the persons of Kings and churchmen, it was
impossible to defend the Bishop's treason but by denying it; or to condemn his condemnation,
but by supposing illegalities in the process: both were vehemently urged by his faction, as
his innocence was pleaded by himself.  That punishment and expulsion from his country may stagger
the virtue even of a good man, and exasperate him against his country, is perhaps natural,
and humanity ought to Pity it.  But whatever were the prepossessions of his friends in his
favour, charity must now believe that Atterbury was always an ambitious, turbulent priest,
attached to the House of Stuart, and consequently no friend to the civil and religious liberties
of his country; or it must be acknowledged, that the disappointment of his ambition by the
Queen's death, and the proscription of his ministerial associates, had driven on attempts to
restore the expelled family in hopes of realizing his aspiring views.  His letters published
by Nichols breathe the impetuous spirit of his youth.  His exclamation on the Queen's death,
when he offered to proclaim the Pretender at Charing Cross in pontificalibus, and swore, on
not being supported, that there was the best cause in England lost for want of spirit, is now
believed also.  His papers, deposited with King James's in the Scottish College at Paris, proclaimed
in what sentiments he died; and the facsimiles of his letters published by Sir David Dalrymple
leave no doubt of his having in his exile entered into the service of the Pretender.  Culpable
-is he was, who but must lament that so classic a mind had only assumed so elegant and amiable
a semblance as he adopted after the disappointment of his prospects and hopes? His letter in
defence of the authenticity of Lord Clarendon's History, is one of the most beautiful and touching
specimens of eloquence in our language.

It was not to load the character of the bishop, nor to affect candour by applauding his talents,
that I introduced mention of him, much less to impute to him -,my consciousnesses of the intended
crime that I am going to relate.  The person against whom the blow was supposed to be meditated
never, in the most distant manner, suspected the bishop of being privy to the plot-No: animosity
of parties, and malevolence to the champions of the House of Brunswick, no doubt suggested
to some blind zealots the perpetration of a crime which would necessarily have injured the
bishop's cause, and could by no means have prevented his disgrace.

Mr. Johnstone, an ancient gentleman, who had been secretary of state for Scotland, his country,
in the reign of King William, was a zealous friend of my father, Sir Robert, and who, in that
period of assassination plots, had imbibed such a tincture of suspicion that he was continually
notifying similar machinations to my father, and warning him.  to be on his guard against them.
Sir Robert, intrepid and unsuspicious, (97) used to rally his good monitor; and, when serious,
told him that his life was too constantly exposed to his enemies to make it of any use to be
watchful on any particular occasion; nor, though Johnstone often hurried to him with intelligence
of such designs, did he ever see reason, but once, to believe in the soundness of the information.
That once arrived thus: a day or two before the bill of pains and penalties was to pass the
House of Commons against the Bishop of Rochester, Mr. Johnstone advertised Sir Robert to be
circumspect, for three or four persons meditated to assassinate him as he should leave the
house at night.  Sir Robert laughed, and forgot the notice.  The morning after the debate,
Johnstone came to Sir Robert with a kind of good-natured insult, telling him, that though he
had scoffed his advice, he had for once followed it, and by so doing preserved his life.  Sir
Robert understood not what he meant, and protested he had not given more credit than usual.
to his warning.  "Yes," said Johnstone, "but you did; for you did not come from the House last
night in your own chariot." Walpole affirmed that he did; but his friend persisting in his
asseveration, Sir Robert called one of the footmen, who replied, "I did call up your honour's
carriage; but Colonel Churchill being with you, and his chariot driving up first, your honour
stepped into that, and your own came home empty." Johnstone, triumphing on his own veracity,
and pushing the examination farther, Sir Robert's coachman recollected that, as he left Palace-yard,
three men, much muffled, had looked into the empty chariot.  The mystery was never farther
cleared up; and my father frequently said it was the only instance of the kind in which he
had ever seen any appearance of a real design.

The second subject that I promised to mention, and it shall be very briefly, was the revival
of the Order of the Bath.  It was the measure of Sir Robert Walpole, and was an artful bank
of thirty-six ribands to supply a fund of favours in lieu of places. He meant, too, to stave
off the demand for garters, and intended that the red should be a step to the blue, and accordingly
took one of the former himself.  He offered the new order to old Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough,
for her grandson the duke, and for the Duke of Bedford, who had married one of her grand-daughters.
(98) She haughtily replied, they should take nothing but the garter. "Madam," said Sir Robert
coolly, "they who take the bath will the sooner have the garter." The next year he took the
latter himself with the Duke of Richmond, both having been previously installed knights of
the revived institution.

Before I quit King George I. I will relate a story, very expressive of his good-humoured presence
of mind.

On one of his journeys to Hanover his coach broke.  At a distance in view was the chateau of
a considerable German nobleman.  The king sent to borrow assistance.  The possessor came, conveyed
the king to his house, and begged the honour of his Majesty's accepting a dinner while his
carriage was repairing; and, while the dinner was preparing, begged leave to amuse his Majesty
with a collection of pictures which he had formed in several tours to Italy.  But what did
the king see in one of the rooms but an unknown portrait of a person in the robes and with
the regalia of the sovereigns of Great Britain!  George asked whom it represented.  The nobleman
replied, with much diffident but decent respect, that in various journeys to Rome he had been
acquainted with the Chevalier de St. George. who had done him the honour of sending him that
picture. "Upon my word," said the king instantly, "it is very like to the family." It was impossible
to remove the embarrassment of the proprietor with more good breeding.

(97) At the time of the Preston rebellion, a Jacobite, who sometimes furnished Sir Robert with
intelligence, sitting alone with him one night, suddenly putting his hand into his bosom and
rising, said, "Why do not I kill you now?"  Walpole starting up, replied, "Because I am a younger
man and a stronger."  They sat down again, and discussed the person's information But Sir Robert
afterwards had reasons for thinking that the spy had no intention of assassination, but had
hoped, by intimidating, to extort money from him.  Yet if no real attempt was made on his life,
it was not from want of suggestions to it: one of the weekly journals pointed out Sir Robert's
frequent passing a Putney bridge late at night, attended but by one or two servants, on his
way to New Park, as a proper place; and after Sir Robert's death, the second Earl of Egmont
told me, that he was once at a consultation of the Opposition, in which it was proposed to
have Sir Robert murdered by a mob, of which the earl had declared his abhorrence.  Such an
attempt was actually made in 1733, at the time of the famous excise bill.  As the minister
descended the stairs of the House of commons on the night he carried the bill, he was guarded
on one side by his second son Edward, and on the other by General Charles Churchill; but the
crowd behind endeavoured to throw him down, as he was a bulky man, and trample him to death;
and that not succeeding, they tried to strangle him by pulling his red cloak tight-but fortunately
the strings broke by the violence of the tug.

(98) Wriothesly, Duke of Bedford, had married Lady Anne Egerton, only daughter of Scroop, Duke
of Bridgewater, by Lady Elizabeth Churchill, daughter of John, Duke of Marlborough.  See VOL. I. 8.

The unexpected death of George I. on his road to Hanover was instantly notified by Lord Townshend,
secretary of state, who attended his Majesty, to his brother Sir Robert Walpole, who as expeditiously
was the first to carry the news to the successor and hail him King.  The next step was, to
ask who his Majesty would please should draw his speech to the Council.  "Sir Spencer Compton,"
replied the new monarch.  The answer was decisive, and implied Sir Robert's dismission.  Sir
Spencer Compton was Speaker of the House of Commons, and treasurer, I think, at that time,
to his Royal Highness, who by that first command, implied his intention of making Sir Spencer
his prime-minister.  He was a worthy man, of exceedingly grave formality, but of no parts,
as his conduct immediately proved.  The poor gentleman was so little qualified to accommodate
himself to the grandeur of the moment, and to conceive how a new sovereign should address himself
to his ministers, and he had also been so far from meditating to supplant the premier,(99)
that, in his distress, it was to Sir Robert himself that he had recourse, and whom he besought
to make the draught of the Kin(,'s speech for him.  The new Queen, a better judge than her
husband of the capacities of the two candidates, and who had silently watched for a moment
proper for overturning the new designations, did not lose a moment in observing to the King
how prejudicial it would be to his affairs to prefer to the minister in possession a man in
whose own judgment his predecessor was the fittest person to execute his office.  From that
moment there was no more question of Sir Spencer Compton as prime-minister.  He was created
an earl, soon received the garter, and became president of that council, at the head of which
he was much fitter to sit than to direct.  Fourteen years afterwards, he was again nominated
by the same Prince to replace Sir Robert as first lord of the treasury on the latter's forced
resignation, but not -.is prime-minister; the conduct of affairs being soon ravished from him
by that dashing genius the Earl of Granville, who reduced him to a cipher for the little year
in which he survived, and in which his incapacity had been obvious.

The Queen, impatient to destroy all hopes of change, took the earliest opportunity of declaring
her own sentiments.  The instance I shall cite will be a true picture of courtiers.  Their
Majesties had removed from Richmond to their temporary palace in Leicester-fields(100)on the
very evening of their receiving notice of their accession to the Crown, and the next day all
the nobility and gentry in town crowded to kiss their hands; my mother amongst the rest, who,
Sir Spencer Compton's designation, and not its evaporation, being known, could not make her
way between the scornful backs and elbows of her late devotees, nor could approach nearer to
the Queen than the third or fourth row; but no sooner was she descried by her Majesty than
the Queen said aloud, "There, I am sure, I see a friend!"  The torrent divided and shrunk to
either side; "and as I came away," said my mother, "I might have walked over their heads if
I had pleased."

The preoccupation of the Queen in favour of Walpole must be explained.  He had early discovered
that, in whatever gallantries George Prince of Wales indulged or affected, even the person
of his Princess was dearer to him than any charms in his mistresses; and though Mrs. Howard
(afterwards Lady Suffolk) was openly his declared favourite, as avowedly as the Duchess of
Kendal was his father's, Sir Robert's sagacity discerned that the power would be lodged with
the wife, not with the mistress; and he not only devoted himself to the Princess; but totally
abstained from even visiting Mrs. Howard; while the injudicious multitude concluded. that the
common consequences of an inconstant husband's passion 'for his concubine would follow, and
accordingly warmer, if not public vows were made to the supposed favourite, than to the Prince's
consort.  They, especially, who in the late reign had been out of favour at court, had, to
pave their future path to favour, and to secure the fall of Sir Robert Walpole, sedulously,
and no doubt zealously, dedicated themselves to the mistress: Bolingbroke secretly, his friend
Swift openly, and as ambitiously, cultivated Mrs. Howard; and the neighbourhood of Pope's villa
to Richmond facilitated their intercourse, though his religion forbade his entertaining views
beyond those of serving his friends.  Lord Bathurst, another of that connexion, and Lord Chesterfield,
too early for his interest, founded their hopes on Mrs. Howard's influence; but astonished
and disappointed at finding Walpole not shaken from his seat, they determined on an experiment
that should be the touchstone of Mrs. Howard's credit.  They persuaded her to demand of the
new King an Earl's coronet for Lord Bathurst.  She did-the Queen put in her veto, and Swift,
in despair, returned to Ireland, to lament Queen Anne, and curse Queen Caroline, under the
mask of patriotism, in a country he abhorred and despised.(101)

To Mrs. Howard, Swift's ingratitude was base.  She, indubitably, had not only exerted all her
interest to second his and his faction's interests, but loved Queen Caroline and the minister
as little as they did; yet, when Swift died, he left behind him a Character of Mrs. Howard
by no means flattering, which was published in his posthumous works.

On its appearance, Mrs. Howard (become Lady Suffolk) said to me, in her calm, dispassionate
manner, "All I can say is, that it is very different from one that he drew of me, and sent
to me, many years ago, and which I have, written by his own hand."(102

Lord Chesterfield, rather more ingenuous-as his character of her, but under a feigned name,
was printed in his life, though in a paper of which he was not known to be the author-was not
more consistent.  Eudosia, described in the weekly journal called Common Sense, for September
10, 1737, was meant for Lady Suffolk: yet was it no fault of hers that he was proscribed at
court; nor did she perhaps ever know, as he never did till the year before his death, when
I acquainted him with it by his friend Sir John Irwin, why he had been put into the Queen's
Index expurgatorius.(102)  The queen had an obscure window at St. James's that looked into
a dark passage, lighted only by a single lamp at night, which looked upon Mrs. Howard's apartment.
Lord Chesterfield, one Twelfth-night at court, had won so large a sum of money, that he thought
it imprudent to carry it home in the dark, and deposited it with the mistress. Thence the queen
inferred great intimacy, and thenceforwards Lord Chesterfield could obtain no favour from court-
and finding himself desperate, went into opposition.  My father himself long afterwards told
me the story, and had become the principal object of the peer's satiric wit, though he had
not been the mover of his disgrace.  The weight of that anger fell more disgracefully on the
king, as I shall mention in the next chapter.

I will here interrupt the detail of what I have heard of the commencement of that reign, and
farther anecdotes of the queen and the mistress, till I have related the second very memorable
transaction of that era; and which would come in awkwardly, if postponed till I have despatched
many subsequent particulars.

(99) Sir Spencer Compton, afterwards Earl of Wilmington, was so far from resenting Sir Robert's
superior talents, that he remained steadfastly -,attached to him; and when the famous motion
for removing Sir Robert was made in both Houses, Lord Wilmington, though confined to his bed,
and with his head blistered, rose and went to the House of Lords, to vote against a measure
that avowed its own injustice, by being grounded only on popular clamour.

(100) It was the town residence of the Sidneys, Earls of Leicester, of whom it was hired, as
it was afterwards by Frederick, Prince of Wales, on a similar quarrel with his father.  He
added to it Savile House, belonging to Sir George Savile, for his children.

(101) Mr. Croker, in his biographical notice of Lady Suffolk, prefixed to the edition of her
Letters, thus satisfactorily confutes this anecdote: "On this it is to be observed, that George
the Second was proclaimed on the 14th of June 1727, that Swift returned to Ireland in the September
of the same year, and that the first creation of peers in that reign did not take place till
the 28th of May 1728.  Is it credible, that Mrs. Howard should have made such a request of
the new King, and suffered so decided a refusal ten or eleven months before any peers were
made?  But, again, upon this first creation of peers Mrs. Howard's brother is the second name.
Is it probable that, with so great an object for her own family in view, she risked a solicitation
for Lord Bathurst? But that which seems most convincing, is Swift's own correspondence.  In
a letter to Mrs.  of the 9th of July 1727, in which, rallying her on the solicitation to which
the new King would be exposed, he says, - 'for my part, you may be secure, that I will never
venture to recommend even a mouse to Mrs. Cole's cat, or a shoe-cleaner to your meanest domestic.'"
Vol. i. p. xxv-E.

(102) "This," says her biographer, "is a complete mistake, to give it no harsher name.  The
Character which Swift left behind, and which was published in his posthumous works, is the
very same which Lady Suffolk had in her possession.  If it be not flattering, it is to Swift's
honour that he 'did not condescend to flatter her in the days of her highest favour; and the
accusation of having written another less favourable, is wholly false." Ibid. vol. i. p. xxxviii.-E.

(103) "It certainly would have been extraordinary," observes Mr. Croker, "that Lord Chesterfield,
in 1137, when he was on terms of the most familiar friendship with Lady Suffolk, should have
published a deprecatory character of her, and in revenge too, for being disgraced at court-Lady
Suffolk being at the same time in disgrace also.  But, unluckily for Walpole's conjecture,
the character of Eudosia (a female savant, as the name imports,) has not the slightest resemblance
to Lady Suffolk, and contains no allusion to courts or courtiers." Ibid. vol. ii. p. xxxiii-E.

                                CHAPTER VI.

Destruction of George the First's will.

At the first council held by the new sovereign, Dr. Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, produced
the will of the late King, and delivered it to the successor, expecting it would be opened
and read in council.  On the contrary, his Majesty put it into his pocket, and stalked out
of the room without uttering a word on the subject.  The poor prelate was thunderstruck, and
had not the presence of mind or the courage to demand the testament's being opened, or at least
to have it registered.  No man present chose to be more hardy than the person to whom the deposit
had been trusted-perhaps none of them immediately conceived the possible violation of so solemn
an act so notoriously existent; still, as the King never mentioned the will more, whispers
only by degrees informed the public that the will was burnt; at least that its injunctions
were never fulfilled.

What the contents were was never ascertained.  Report said, that forty thousand pounds had
been bequeathed to the Duchess of Kendal; and more vague rumours spoke of a large legacy to
the Queen of Prussia, daughter of the late King.

The legacy to the ]Duchess was some time after on the brink of coming to open and legal discussion.
Lord Chesterfield marrying her niece and heiress, the Countess of Walsingham, and resenting
his own proscription at court, was believed to have instituted, or at least to have threatened,
a suit for recovery of the legacy to the Duchess, to which he was then become entitled; and
it was as confidently believed that he was quieted by the payment of twenty thousand pounds.

But if the Archbishop had too timidly betrayed the trust reposed in him from weakness and want
of spirit, there were two other men who had no such plea of imbecility, and who, being independent,
and above being awed, basely sacrificed their honour and their integrity for positive sordid
gain.  George the First had deposited duplicates of his will with two sovereign German princes:
I will not specify them, because at this distance of time I do not, perfectly recollect their
titles; but I was actually, some years ago, shown a copy of a letter from one of our ambassadors
abroad to-a secretary of state at that period, in which the ambassador said, one of the princes
in question would accept the proffered subsidy, and had delivered, or would deliver, the duplicate
of the King's will. The other trustee, was no doubt, as little conscientious and as corrupt.
It is pity the late King of Prussia did not learn their infamous treachery.

Discoursing once with Lady Suffolk on that suppressed testament, she made the only plausible
shadow of an excuse that could be made for George the Second.  She told me that George the
First had burnt two wills made in favour of his son.  They were, probably, the wills of the
Duke and Duchess of Zell; or one of them might be that of his mother, the Princess Sophia.
The crime of the first George could only palliate, not justify, the criminality of the second;
for the second did -not punish the maturity, but the innocent.  But bad precedents are always
dangerous, and too likely to be copied. (104)

(104) On the subject of the royal will, Walpole, in his Memoires, vol. ii. p. 458, relates
the following anecdote:-"The morning after the death of George the Second, Lord Waldegrave
showed the Duke of Cumberland an extraordinary piece: it was endorsed, 'very private paper,'
and was a letter from the Duke of Newcastle to the first Earl of Waldegrave; in which his Grace
informed the Earl, then our ambassador in France, that he had received by the messenger the
copy of the will and codicil of George the First; that he had delivered it to his Majesty,
who put it into the fire without opening it: 'So,' adds the Duke, 'we do not know whether it
confirms the other or not;' and he proceeds to say, 'Despatch a messenger to the Duke Of Wolfenbuttle
with the treaty, in which he is granted all he desired; and we expect, by return of the messenger,
the original will from him.'  George the First had left two wills; one in the hands of Dr.
Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, the other with the Duke of Wolfenbuttle.  He had been in the
right to take these precautions: he himself had burned his wife's testament, and her and her
father's, the duke of Zell; both of whom had made George the Second their heir--a paliative
of the latter's obliquity, if justice would allow of any violation." See vol. v. p. 284, ed.
1835.-E.

                               CHAPTER VII.

I will now resume the story of Lady Suffolk whose history, though she had none of that influence
on the transactions of the cabinet that was expected, will still probably be more entertaining
to two young ladies than a magisterial detail of political events, the traces of which at least
may be found in journals and brief chronicles of the times.  The interior of courts, and the
lesser features of history, are precisely those with which we are least acquainted,-I mean
of the age preceding our own.  Such anecdotes are forgotten in the multiplicity of those that
ensue, or reside only in the memory of idle old persons, or have not yet emerged into publicity
from the portefeuilles of such garrulous Brant`omes as myself.  Trifling I will not call myself;
for, while I have such charming disciples as you two to inform; and though acute or plodding
politicians, for whom they are not meant, may condemn these pages; which is preferable, the
labour of an historian who toils for fame and for applause from he knows not whom; or my careless
commission to paper of perhaps insignificant passages that I remember, but penned for the amusement
of a pair of such sensible and cultivated minds as I never met at so early an age, and whose
fine eyes I do know will read me With candour, and allow me that mite of fame to which I aspire,
their approbation of my endeavours to divert their evenings in the country?  O Guicciardin!
is posthumous renown so valuable as the satisfaction of reading these court-tales to the lovely
Berrys?

Henrietta Hobart was daughter of Sir Henry, and sister of Sir John Hobart, Knight of the Bath
on the revival of the order, and afterwards by her interest made a baron; and since created
Earl of Buckinghamshire.

She was first married to Mr. Howard, the younger brother of more than one Earl of Suffolk;
to which title he at last succeeded himself, and left a son by her, who was the last earl of
that branch.  She had but the slender fortune of an ancient baronet's daughter; and Mr. Howard's
circumstances were the reverse of opulent.  It was the close of Queen Anne's reign: the young
couple saw no step more prudent than to resort to Hanover, and endeavour to ingratiate themselves
with the future sovereigns of England.  Still so narrow was their fortune, that Mr. Howard
finding it expedient to give a dinner to the Hanoverian ministers, Mrs. Howard is said to have
sacrificed her beautiful head of hair to pay for the expense.  It must be recollected, that
at that period were in fashion those enormous full-bottomed wigs, which often cost twenty and
thirty guineas.  Mrs. Howard was extremely acceptable to the intelligent Princess Sophia; but
did not at that time make farther impression on the Electoral Prince, than, on his father's
succession to the crown, to be appointed one of the bedchamber-women to the new Princess of Wales.

The elder Whig politicians became ministers to the King.  The most promising of the young lords
and gentleman of that party, and the prettiest and liveliest of the young ladies, formed the
new court of the Prince and Princess of Wales.  The apartment of the bedchamber-woman in waiting
became the fashionable evening rendez-vous of the most distinguished wits and beauties.  Lord
Chesterfield, then Lord Stanhope, Lord Scarborough, Carr Lord Hervey, elder brother of the
more known John Lord Hervey, and reckoned to have superior parts, General (at that time only
Colonel) Charles Churchill, and others not necessary to rehearse, were constant attendants:
Miss Lepelle, afterwards Lady Hervey, my mother, Lady Walpole, Mrs. Selwyn, mother of the famous
George, and herself of much vivacity and pretty, Mrs. Howard, and above all for universal admiration,
Miss Bellenden, one of the maids of honour.  Her face and person were charming; lively she
was almost to `etourderie; (105) and so agreeable she was, that I never heard her mentioned
afterwards by one of her contemporaries who did not prefer her as the most perfect creature
they ever knew.  The Prince frequented the waiting-room, and soon felt a stronger inclination
for her than he ever entertained but for his Princess.  Miss Bellenden by no means felt a reciprocal
passion. The Prince's gallantry was by no means delicate; and his avarice disgusted her.  One
evening sitting by her, he took out his purse and counted his money.  He repeated the numeration:
the giddy Bellenden lost her patience, and cried out, "Sir, I cannot bear it! if you count
your money any more, I will go out of the room." The chink of the gold did not tempt her more
than the person of his Royal Highness.  In fact, her heart was engaged; and so the Prince,
finding his love fruitless, suspected.  He was even so generous as to promise her, that if
she would discover the object of her Choice, and would engage not to marry without his privity,
he would consent to the match, and would be kind to her husband. She gave him the promise he
exacted, but without acknowledging the person; and then, lest his Highness should throw any
obstacle in the way, married, without his knowledge, Colonel Campbell, one of the grooms of
his bedchamber, and who long afterwards succeeded to the title of Argyle at the death of Duke
Archibald. (106)  The Prince never forgave the breach of her word; and whenever she went to
the drawing-room, as from her husband's situation she was sometimes obliged to do, though trembling
at what she knew she was to undergo, the Prince always stepped up to her, and whispered some
very harsh reproach in her ear.  Mrs. Howard was the intimate friend of Miss Bellenden; had
been the confidante of the Prince's passion; and, on Mrs. Campbell's eclipse, succeeded to
her friend's post of favourite, but not to her resistance.

>From the steady decorum of Mrs. Howard, I should conclude that she would have preferred the
advantages of her situation to the ostentatious `eclat of it: but many obstacles stood in the
way of total concealment; nor do I suppose that love had any share in the sacrifice she made
of her virtue.  She had felt poverty, and was far from disliking power.  Mr. Howard was probably
as little agreeable to her as he proved worthless.  The King, though very amorous, was certainly
more attracted by a silly idea he had entertained of gallantry being becoming, than by a love
of variety; and he added the more egregious folly of fancying that inconstancy proved he was
not governed; but so awkwardly did he manage that artifice, that it but demonstrated more clearly
the influence of the Queen.  With such a disposition, secrecy would by no means have answered
his Majesty's views; yet the publicity of the intrigue was especially owing to Mr. Howard,
who, far from ceding his wife quietly, went one night into the quadrangle of St. James's, and
vociferously demanded her to be restored to him before the guards and other audience.  Being
thrust out, he sent a letter to her by the Archbishop of Canterbury, reclaiming her, and the
Archbishop by his instructions consigned the summons to the Queen, who had the malicious pleasure
of delivering the letter to her rival. (107)

Such intemperate proceedings by no means invited the new mistress to leave the asylum of St.
James's.  She was safe while under the royal roof: even after the rupture between the King
and Prince (for the affair commenced in the reign of the first George), and though the Prince,
on quitting St. James's, resided in a private house, it was too serious an enterprise to attempt
to take his wife by force out of the palace of the Prince of Wales.  The case was altered,
when, on the arrival of summer, their Royal Highnesses were to remove to Richmond.  Being only
woman of the bedchamber, etiquette did not allow Mrs. Howard the entr`ee of the coach with
the Princess.  She apprehended that Mr. Howard might seize her on the road.  To baffle such
an attempt, her friends, John, Duke of Argyle, and his brother, the Earl of Islay, called for
her in the coach of one of them by eight o'clock in the morning of the day, at noon of which
the Prince and Princess were to remove, and lodged her safely in their house at Richmond. 
During the summer a negotiation was commenced with the obstreperous husband, and he sold his
own noisy honour and the possession of his wife for a pension of twelve hundred a-year. (108)

These now little-known anecdotes of Mr. Howard's behaviour I received between twenty and thirty
years afterwards, from the mouth of Lady Suffolk herself.  She had left the court about the
year 1735, and passed her summers at her villa of Marble Hill, at Twickenham, living very retired
both there and in London.  I purchased Strawberry Hill in 1747; and being much acquainted with
the houses of Dorset, Vere, and others of Lady Suffolk's intimates, was become known to her;
though she and my father had been at the head of two such hostile factions at court.  Becoming
neighbours, and both, after her second husband's death, living single and alone, our acquaintance
turned to intimacy.  She was extremely deaf, (109) and consequently had more satisfaction in
narrating than in listening; her memory both of remote and of the most recent facts was correct
beyond belief. I, like you, was indulgent to, and fond of old anecdotes.  Each of us knew different
Parts of many court stories, and each was eager to learn what either could relate more; and
thus, by comparing notes, we sometimes could make out discoveries of a third circumstance,
(110) before unknown to both.  Those evenings, and I had many of them in autumnal nights, were
extremely agreeable; and if this chain of minutiae proves so to you, you owe perhaps to those
conversations the fidelity of my memory, which those repetitions recalled and stamped so lastingly.

In this narrative will it be unwelcome to you, if I subjoin a faithful portrait of the heroine
of this part?  lady Suffolk was of a just height, well made, extremely fair, with the finest
light brown hair; was remarkably genteel, and always well dressed with taste and simplicity.
Those were her personal charms, for her face was regular and agreeable rather than beautiful
and those charms she retained with little diminution to her death at the age of seventy-nine.
(111) Her mental qualifications were by no means shining; her eyes and countenance showed her
character, which was grave and mild.  Her strict love of truth and her accurate memory were
always in unison, and made her too circumstantial on trifles.  She was discreet without being
reserved; and having no bad qualities, and being constant to her connexions, she preserved
uncommon respect to the end of her life; and from the propriety and decency of her behaviour
was always treated as if her virtue had never been questioned; her friends even affecting to
suppose, that her connexion with the King had been confined to pure friendship.  Unfortunately,
his Majesty's passions were too indelicate to have been confined to Platonic love for a woman
who was deaf, (112)-sentiments he had expressed in a letter to the Queen, who, however jealous
of Lady Suffolk, had latterly dreaded the King's contracting a new attachment to a younger
rival, and had prevented Lady Suffolk from leaving the court as early as she had wished to
do.  "I don't know," said his Majesty, "why you will not let me part with an old deaf woman,
of whom I am weary."

Her credit had always been extremely limited by the Queen's superior influence, and by the
devotion of the minister to her Majesty.  Except a barony, a red riband, and a good place for
her brother, Lady Suffolk could succeed but in very subordinate recommendations.  Her own acquisitions
were so moderate, that, besides Marble Hill, which cost the King ten or twelve thousand pounds,
her complaisance had not been too dearly purchased.  She left the court with an income so little
to be envied, that, though an economist and not expensive, by the lapse of some annuities on
lives not so prolonged as her own she found herself straitened; and, besides Marble Hill, did
not at most leave twenty thousand pounds to her family.  On quitting court, she married Mr.
George Berkeley, and outlived him. (113)

No established mistress of a sovereign ever enjoyed less of the brilliancy of the situation
than Lady Suffolk.  Watched and thwarted by the Queen, disclaimed by the minister, she owed
to the dignity of her own behaviour, and to the contradiction of their enemies, the chief respect
that was paid to her, and which but ill compensated for the slavery of her attendance, and
the mortifications she endured.  She was elegant; her lover the reverse, and most unentertaining,
and void of confidence in her. His motions too were measured by etiquette and the clock.  He
visited her every evening at nine; but with such dull punctuality, that he frequently walked
about his chamber for ten minutes with his watch in his hand, if the stated minute was not arrived.

But from the Queen she tasted yet more positive vexations.  Till she became Countess of Suffolk,
she constantly dressed the Queen's bead, who delighted in subjecting her to such servile offices,
though always apologizing to her good Howard.  Often her Majesty had more complete triumph.
It happened more than once, that the King, coming into the room while the Queen was dressing,
has snatched off the handkerchief, and, turning rudely to Mrs. Howard, has cried, "Because
you have an ugly neck yourself, you hide the Queen's."

It is certain that the King always preferred the Queen's person to that of any other woman;
nor ever described his idea of beauty, but he drew the picture of his wife.

Queen Caroline is said to have been very handsome at her marriage, soon after which she had
the small-pox; but was little marked by it, and retained a most pleasing countenance.  It was
full of majesty or mildness as she pleased, and her penetrating eyes expressed whatever she
had a mind they should.  Her voice too was captivating, and her hands beautifully small, plump,
and graceful.  Her understanding was uncommonly strong; and so was her resolution.  From their
earliest connexion she had determined to govern the King, and deserved to do so; for her submission
to his will was unbounded, her sense much superior, and his honour and interest always took
place of her own: so that her love of power that was predominant, was dearly bought, and rarely
ill employed.  She was ambitious too of fame; but, shackled by her devotion to the King, she
seldom could pursue that object.  She wished to be a patroness of learned men but George had
no respect for them or their works; and her Majesty's own taste was not very exquisite, nor
did he allow her time to cultivate any studies. Her Generosity would have displayed itself,
for she valued money but as the instrument of her good purposes: but he stinted her alike in
almost all her passions; and though she wished for nothing more than to be liberal, she bore
the imputation of his avarice, as she did of others of his faults.  Often, when she had made
prudent and proper promises of preferment, and could not persuade the King to comply, she suffered
the breach of word to fall on her, rather than reflect on him.  Though his affection and confidence
in her were implicit, he lived in dread of being supposed to be governed by her; and that silly
parade was extended even to the most private moments of business with my father.  Whenever
he entered, the Queen rose, courtesied, and retired or offered to retire.  Sometimes the King
condescended to bid her stay-on both occasions she and Sir Robert. had previously settled the
business to be discussed.  Sometimes the King would quash the proposal in question, and yield
after retalking it over with her-but then he boasted to Sir Robert that he himself had better
considered it.

One of the Queen's delights was the improvement of the garden at Richmond; and the King believed
she paid for all with her own money-nor would he ever look at her intended plans, saying he
did not care how she flung away her own revenue.  He little suspected the aids Sir Robert furnished
to her from the treasury.  When she died, she was indebted twenty thousand pounds to the King.

Her learning I have said was superficial; her knowledge of languages as little accurate.  The
King, with a bluff Westphalian accent, spoke English correctly.  The Queen's chief study was
divinity, and she had rather weakened her faith than enlightened it.  She was at least not
orthodox; and her confidante, Lady Sundon, an absurd and pompous simpleton, swayed her countenance
towards the less-believing clergy.  The Queen, however, was so sincere at her death, that when
Archbishop Potter was to administer the sacrament to her, she declined taking it, very few
persons being in the room.  When the prelate retired, the courtiers in the ante-room crowded
round him, crying, "My lord, has the queen received?"  His grace artfully eluded the question,
only saying most devoutly , "Her Majesty was in a heavenly disposition"-and the truth escaped
the public.

She suffered more unjustly by declining to see her son, the Prince of Wales, to whom she sent
her blessing and forgiveness; but conceiving the extreme distress it would lay on the King,
should he thus be forced to forgive so impenitent a son, or to banish him again if once recalled,
she heroically preferred a meritorious husband to a worthless child.

The Queen's greatest error was too high an opinion of her own address and art; she imagined
that all who did not dare to contradict her were imposed upon; and she had the additional weakness
of thinking that she could play off @any persons without being discovered.  That mistaken humour,
and at other times her hazarding very offensive truths, made her many enemies; and her duplicity
in fomenting jealousies between the ministers, that each might be more dependent on herself,
was no sound wisdom.  It was the Queen who blew into a flame the ill-blood between Sir Robert
Walpole and his brother-in-law, Lord Townshend.  Yet though she disliked some of the cabinet,
she never let her own prejudices disturb the King's affairs, provided the obnoxious paid no
court to the mistress.  Lord Islay was the only man, who, by managing Scotland for Sir Robert
Walpole, was maintained by him in spite of his attachment to Lady Suffolk.

The Queen's great secret was her own rupture, which, till her last illness, nobody knew but
the King, her German nurse, Mrs. Mailborne, and one other person.  It was great shrewdness
in Sir Robert Walpole, who, before her distemper broke out, discovered her secret.  On my mother's
death, who was of the Queen's age, her Majesty asked Sir Robert many physical questions; but
he remarked that she oftenest reverted to a rupture, which had not been the illness of his
wife.  When he came home, he said to me, "Now, Horace, I know by possession of what secret
Lady Sundon (115)has preserved such an ascendant over the Queen." He was in the right.  How
Lady Sundon had wormed herself into that mystery was never known.  As Sir Robert maintained
his influence over the clergy by Gibson, Bishop of London, he often met with troublesome obstructions
from Lady Sundon, who espoused, as I have said, the heterodox clergy; and Sir Robert could
never shake her credit.

Yet the Queen was constant in her protection of Sir Robert, and the day before she died gave
a strong mark of her conviction that he was the firmest supporter the King had.  As they two
alone were standing by the Queen's bed, she pathetically recommended, not the minister to the
sovereign, but the master to the servant. Sir Robert was alarmed, and feared the recommendation
would leave a fatal impression; but a short time after, the King reading with Sir Robert some
intercepted letters from Germany, which said that now the Queen was 'gone, Sir Robert would
have no protection: "On the contrary," said the King, "you know she recommended me to you."
This marked the notice he had taken of the expression; and it was the only notice he ever took
of it: nay, his Majesty's grief was so excessive and so sincere, that his kindness to his minister
seemed to increase for the Queen's sake.

The Queen's dread of a rival was a feminine weakness; the behaviour of her elder son was a
real thorn.  He early displayed his aversion to his mother, who perhaps assumed too much at
first; yet it is certain that her good sense, and the interest of her family, would have prevented,
if possible, the mutual dislike of the father and son, and their reciprocal contempt.  As the
Opposition gave into all adulation towards the Prince, his ill-poised head and vanity swallowed
all their incense.  He even early after his arrival had listened to a high act of disobedience.
Money he soon wanted: old Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, (116) e ever proud and ever malignant,
was persuaded to offer her favourite Granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer, afterwards Duchess
of Bedford, to the Prince of' Wales, with a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds.  He accepted
the proposal, and the day was fixed for their being secretly married at the Duchess's lodge
in the Great park at Windsor.  Sir Robert Walpole got intelligence of the project, prevented
it, and the secret was buried in silence.

Youth, folly, and indiscretion, the beauty of the young lady, and a large sum of ready money,
might have offered something like a plea for so rash a marriage, had it taken place; but what
could excuse, what indeed could provoke, the senseless and barbarous insult offered to the
King and Queen, by Frederick's taking his wife out of the palace of Hampton Court in the middle
of the night, when she was in actual labour, and carrying her, at the imminent risk of the
lives of her and the child, to the unaired palace and bed at St. James's?  Had he no way of
affronting his parents but by venturing to kill his wife and the heir of the crown? A baby
that wounds itself to vex its nurse is no more void of reflection.  The scene which commenced
by unfeeling idiotism closed with paltry hypocrisy.  The Queen on the first notice of her son's
exploits, set out for St. James's to visit the Princess by seven in the morning.  The gracious
Prince, so far from attempting an apology, spoke not a word to his mother; but on her retreat
gave her his hand, led her into the street to her coach-still dumb!-but a crowd being assembled
at the gate, he kneeled down in the dirt, and humbly kissed her Majesty's hand. Her indignation
must have shrunk into contempt.

After the death of the Queen, Lady Yarmouth (117) came over, who had been the King's mistress
at Hanover during his latter journeys-and with the Queen's privity, for he always made her
the of his amours; which made Mrs. Selwyn once tell him, he should be the last man with whom
she would have an intrigue, for she knew he would tell the Queen.  In his letters to the latter
from Hanover, he said, "You must love the Walmoden, for she loves me." She was created a countess,
and had much weight with him; but never employed her credit but to assist his ministers, or
to convert some honours and favours to her own advantage.  She had two sons, who both bore
her husband's name; but the younger, though never acknowledged, was supposed the King's, and
consequently did not miss additional homage from the courtiers. That incense being one of the
recommendations to the countenance of Lady Yarmouth, drew Lord Chesterfield into a ridiculous
distress.  On his being made secretary of state, be found a fair young lad in the antechamber
at St. James's, -who seeming much at home, the earl, concluding it was the mistress's son,
was profuse of attentions to the boy, and more prodigal still of his prodigious regard for
his mamma.  The shrewd boy received all his lordship's vows with indulgence, and without betraying
himself: at last he said, "I suppose your lordship takes me for Master Louis; but I am only
Sir William Russel, one of the pages."

The King's last years passed as regularly as clockwork.  At nine at night he had cards in the
apartment of his daughters, the Princesses Amelia and Caroline, with Lady Yarmouth, two or
three of the late Queen's ladies, and as many of the most favoured officers of his own household.
Every Saturday in summer he carried that uniform party, but without his daughters, to dine
at Richmond: they went in coaches and six in the middle of the day , with the heavy horse-guards
kicking up the dust before them-dined, walked an hour in the garden, returned in the same dusty
parade; and his Majesty fancied himself the most gallant and lively prince in Europe.

His last year was glorious and triumphant beyond example; and his death was most felicitous
to himself, being without a Pang, without tasting a reverse, and when his sight and hearing
were so nearly extinguished that any prolongation could but have swelled to calamities. (118)

(105) She is thus described in a ballad, made upon the quarrel between George the First and
the Prince of Wales, at the christening recorded at p. 83 when the Prince and all his household
were ordered to quit St. James's:-

"But Bellenden we needs must praise, Who, as down the stairs she jumps, Sings over the hills
and far away, Despising doleful dumps."-E.

(106) Colonel John Campbell succeeded to the dukedom in 1761: Mrs. Campbell died in 1736. 
She was the mother of the fifth Duke of Argyle and three other sons, and of Lady Caroline,
who married, first, the Earl of Aylesbury, and, secondly, Walpole's bosom friend, Marshal Conway.-E.

(107) "The letter which Walpole alludes to," says Mr. Croker, "is in existence.  It is not
a letter from Mr. Howard to his lady, but from the Archbishop to the Princess; and although
his grace urges a compliance with Mr. Howard's demand of the restoration of his wife, he treats
it not as a matter between them, but as an attack on the Princess herself, whom the Archbishop
considers as the direct protectress of Mrs. Howard, and the immediate cause of her resistance.
So that in this letter at least there is no ground for imputing to Mrs. Howard any rivalry
with the Princess, or to the Princess any malicious jealousy of Mrs. Howard." Vol. i. p. xiv.-E.

(108) Mr. Croker asserts, that "neither in Mrs. Howard's correspondence with the King, nor
in the notes of her conversation with the Queen, nor in any of her most confidential papers,
has he found a single trace of the feeling which Walpole so confidently imputes."  Upon this
assertion, Sir Walter Scott, in a review of the Suffolk Correspondence, pleasantly remarks,-"We
regret that the editor's researches have not enabled him to state, whether it is true that
the restive husband sold his own noisy honour and the possession of his lady for a pension
of twelve hundred a-year.  For our own parts, without believing all Walpole's details, we substantially
agree in his opinion, that the King's friendship was by no means Platonic or refined; but that
the Queen and Mrs. Howard, by mutual forbearance, good sense, and decency, contrived to diminish
the scandal: after all, the question has no great interest for the present generation, since
scandal is only valued when fresh, and the public have generally enough of that poignant fare,
without ripping up the frailties of their grandmothers."  Sir Walter sums up his notice of
the inaccuracies occurring in these Reminiscences, with the following just and considerate
reflection: "When it is recollected that the noble owner of Strawberry Hill was speaking of
very remote events, which he reported on hearsay, and that hearsay of old standing, such errors
are scarcely to be wondered at, particularly when they are found to correspond with the partialities
and prejudices of the narrator.  These, strengthening as we grow older, gradually pervert or
at least alter, the accuracy of our recollections, until they assimilate them to our feelings,
while,

"As beams of warm imagination play, The memory's faint traces melt away.  A passage lately
read has recalled some other formerly perused; and both together have opened to me, or cleared
up some third fact, which neither separately would have expounded.

(111) Lady Suffolk died in July, 1767.-E.

(112) Lady Suffolk was early affected with deafness.  Cheselden, the surgeon, then in favour
at court, persuaded her that he had hopes of being able to cure deafness by some operation
on the drum of the ear, and offered to try the experiment on a condemned convict then in Newgate,
who was deaf.  If the man could be pardoned, he would try it; and, if he succeeded, would practise
the same cure on her ladyship.  She obtained the man's pardon, who was cousin to Cheselden,
who had feigned that pretended discovery to save his relation-and no more was heard of the
experiment.  The man saved his ear too-but Cheselden was disgraced at court.

(113) Lady Suffolk formally retired from court in 1734, and in the following year married the
Honourable George Berkeley, youngest son of the second Earl of Berkeley.  He was Master of
St. Catherine's, in the Tower, and had served in two parliaments as member for Dover.  He died
in 1746.-E.

(114) While the Queen dressed, prayers used to be read in the outward room, where hung a naked
Venus.  Mrs. Selwyn, bedchamber-woman in waiting, was one day ordered to bid the chaplain,
Dr. Maddox, afterwards Bishop of Worcester, begin the service.  He said archly, "And a very
proper altar-piece is here, Madam!"  Queen Anne had the same custom; and once ordering the
door to be shut while she shifted, the chaplain stopped.  The Queen sent to ask why he did
not proceed.  He replied, "he would not whistle the word of God through the keyhole."

(115) Mrs. Clayton, wife of Robert Clayton, Esq. of the Treasury, bedchamber-woman to the Queen.
This lady, who had the art to procure her husband to be created Lord Sundon, possessed over
her royal mistress an influence of which even Sir Robert Walpole was jealous.-E.

(116) That woman, who had risen to greatness and independent wealth by the weakness of another
Queen, forgot, like Duc d'Epernon, her own unmerited exultation, and affected to brave successive
courts, though sprung from the dregs of one.  When the Prince of Orange came over to marry
the Princess Royal, Anne, a boarded gallery with a penthouse roof was erected for the procession
from the windows of the great drawing-room at St. James's cross the garden to the Lutheran
chapel in the friary. The Prince being indisposed, and going to Bath, the marriage was deferred
for some weeks, and the boarded gallery remained, darkening the windows of Marlborough House.
The Duchess cried, "I wonder when my neighbour George will take away his orange-chest!"--which
it did resemble.  She did not want that sort of wit,* which ill-temper, long knowledge of the
world, and insolence can sharpen-and envying the favour which she no longer possessed, Sir
R. Walpole was often the object of her satire. Yet her great friend, Lord Godolphin, the treasurer,
had enjoined her to preserve very different sentiments.  The Duchess and my father and mother
were standing by the Earl's bed at St. Albans as he was dying.  Taking Sir Robert by the hand,
Lord Godolphin turned to the Duchess, and said, "Madam, should 'you ever desert this young
man, and there should be a possibility of returning from the grave, I shall certainly appear
to you." Her grace did not believe in spirits.

* Baron Gleicken, minister from Denmark to France, being at Paris soon after the King his master
had been there, and a French lady being so ill-bred as to begin censuring the King to him,
saying, "Ah! Monsieur, c'est une t`ete!"-"Couronn`ee," replied he instantly, stopping her by
so gentle a hint.

(118) For an interesting account of the death of George the Second, on the 24th of October,
1760, and also of his funeral in Westminster Abbey, see Walpole's letters to Mr. Montagu on
the 25th of that month, and of the 13th of November.-E.

                               CHAPTER VIII.

I am tempted to drain my memory of all its rubbish, and will set down a few more of my recollections,
but with less method than I have used in the foregoing pages.

I have said little or nothing of the King's two unmarried daughters.  Though they lived in
the palace with him, he never admitted them to any share in his politics; and if any of the
ministers paid them the compliment of seeming attachment, it was more for the air than for
the reality.  The Princess Royal, Anne, married in Holland, was of a most imperious and ambitious
nature; and on her mother's death, hoping to succeed to her credit, came to Holland on pretence
of ill health; but the King, aware of her plan, Was so offended that he sent her to Bath as
soon as she arrived, and as peremptorily back to Holland-I think, without suffering her to
pass two nights in London.

Princess Amelia, as well disposed to meddle, was confined to receiving court from the Duke
of Newcastle, who affected to be in love with her; and from the Duke of Grafton, in whose connexion
with her there was more reality.

Princess Caroline, one of the most excellent of women, was devoted to the Queen, who, as well
as the King, had such confidence in her veracity, that on any disagreement among their children,
they said, "Stay, send for Caroline, and then we shall know the truth."

The memorable Lord Hervey had dedicated himself to the Queen, and certainly towards her death
had gained great ascendance with her. She had made him privy-seal; and as he took care to keep
as well with Sir Robert Walpole, no man stood in a more prosperous light.

But Lord Hervey, who handled all the weapons of a court, (119) had also made a deep impression
on the heart of the virtuous Princess Caroline; and as there was a mortal antipathy between
the Duke of Grafton and Lord Hervey, the court was often on the point of being disturbed by
the enmity of the favourites of the two Princesses.  The death of the Queen deeply affected
her daughter Caroline; and the change of the ministry four years after, dislodged Lord Hervey
whom for the Queen's sake the King would have saved, and who very ungratefully satirized the
King in a ballad, as if he had sacrificed him voluntarily. Disappointment, rage, and a distempered
constitution carried Lord Hervey off, and overwhelmed his Princess - she never appeared in
public after the Queen's death; and, being dreadfully afflicted with the rheumatism, never
stirred out of her apartment, and rejoiced at her own dissolution some years before her father.

Her sister Amelia leagued herself with the Bedford faction during the latter part of her father's
life.  When he died, she established herself respectably; but enjoying no favour with her nephew,
and hating the Princess-dowager, she made a plea of her deafness, and soon totally abstained
from St. James's.

The Duke of Cumberland, never, or very rarely, interfered in politics.  Power he would have
liked, but never seemed to court it.  His passion would have been to command the army, and
he would, I doubt, have been too ready to aggrandize the crown by it: but successive disgusts
weaned his mind from all pursuits, and the grandeur of his sense, (120) and philosophy made
him indifferent to a world that had disappointed all his views.  The unpopularity which the
Scotch and Jacobites spread against him for his merit in suppressing the rebellion, his brother's
jealousy, and the contempt he himself felt for the Prince, his own ill success in his battles
abroad, and his father's treacherous sacrifice of him on the convention of Closterseven, the
dereliction of his two political friends, Lord Holland and Lord Sandwich, and the rebuffing
spite of the Princess-dowager; all those mortifications centring on a constitution evidently
tending to dissolution, made him totally neglect himself, and ready to shake off being, as
an encumbrance not worth the attention of a superior understanding.

>From the time the Duke first appeared on the stage of the public, all his father's ministers
had been blind to his Royal Highness's capacity, or were afraid of it.  Lord Granville, too
giddy himself to sound a young Prince, had treated him arrogantly when the King and the Earl
had projected a match for him with the Princess of Denmark.  The Duke, accustomed by the Queen
and his governor, Mr. Poyntz, to venerate the wisdom of Sir Robert Walpole, then on his death-bed,
sent Mr. Poyntz, the day but one before Sir Robert expired, to consult him how to avoid the
match. Sir Robert advised his Royal Highness to stipulate for an ample settlement.  The Duke
took the sage counsel, and heard no more of his intended bride.

The low ambition of Lord Hardwicke, the childish passion for power of the Duke of Newcastle,
and the peevish jealousy of Mr. Pelham, combined on the death of the Prince of Wales, to exclude
the Duke of Cumberland from the regency (in case of minority,) and to make them flatter themselves
that they should gain the favour of the Princess-dowager by cheating her with the semblance
of power.  The Duke resented the slight, but scorned to make any claim.  The Princess never
forgave the insidious homage; and, in concurrence with Lord Bute, totally estranged the affection
of the young King from his uncle, nor allowed him a shadow of influence.

(119) He had broken with Frederick, Prince of Wales, on having shared the favours of his mistress,
Miss Vane, one of the Queen's maids of honour.  When she fell in labour at St. James's, and
was delivered of a son, which she ascribed to the Prince, Lord Hervey and Lord Harrington each
told Sir Robert Walpole that he believed himself father of the child.

(120) the Duke, in his very childhood, gave a mark of his sense and firmness.  He had displeased
the Queen, an(f she sent him up to his chamber.  When he appeared again, he was sullen. "William,"
said the Queen, "what have you been doing?"-- "Reading."--"Reading what?"--"The Bible."--"And
what did you read there?"--"About Jesus and Mary.=--"And what about them?"--"Why, that Jesus
said to Mary, Woman! what hast thou to do with me?"

                                CHAPTER IX.

Anecdotes of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough-and of Catherine Duchess of Buckingham.

I have done with royal personages: shall I add a codicil on some remarkable characters that
I remember? As I am writing for young ladies, I have chiefly dwelt on heroines of your own
sex; they, too, shall compose my last chapter: enter the Duchesses of Marlborough and Buckingham.

Those two women were considerable personages in their day.  The first, her own beauty, the
superior talents of her husband in war, and the caprice of a feeble princess, raised to the
highest pitch of power; and the prodigious wealth bequeathed to her by her lord, and accumulated
in concert with her, gave her weight in a free country.  The other, proud of royal, though
illegitimate birth, was, from the vanity of that birth, so zealously attached to her expelled
brother, the Pretender, that she never ceased labouring to effect his restoration; and, as
the opposition to the House of Brunswick was composed partly of principled Jacobites-of Tories,
who either knew not what their own principles were, or dissembled them to themselves, and of
Whigs, who, from hatred of the minister, both acted in concert with the Jacobites and rejoiced
in their assistance-two women of such wealth, rank, and enmity to the court, were sure of great
attention from all the discontented.

The beauty of the Duchess of Marlborough had always been of the scornful and imperious kind,
and her features and air announced nothing that her temper did not confirm; both together,
her beauty and temper, enslaved her heroic lord.  One of her principal charms was a prodigious
abundance of fine fair hair. One day at her toilet, in anger to him, she cut off those commanding
tresses, and flung them in his face.  Nor did her insolence stop there, nor stop till it had
totally estranged and worn out the patience of the poor Queen, her mistress.  The Duchess was
often seen to give her Majesty her fan and gloves, and turn away her own head, as if the Queen
had offensive smells.

Incapable of due respect to superiors, it was no wonder she treated her children and inferiors
with supercilious contempt. Her eldest daughter (121) and she were long at variance, and never
reconciled.  When the young Duchess exposed herself by placing a monument and silly epitaph,
of her own composition and bad spelling, to Congreve, in Westminster Abbey, her mother, quoting
the words, said, "I know not what pleasure she might have in his company, but I am sure it
was no honour."(122)  With her youngest daughter, the Duchess of Montagu, old Sarah agreed
as ill.  "I wonder," said the Duke of Marlborough to them, "that you cannot agree, you are
so alike!"  Of her granddaughter, the Duchess of Manchester, daughter of the Duchess of Montagu,
she affected to be fond.  One day she said to her, "Duchess of Manchester, you are a good creature,
and I love you mightily-but you have a mother!"-"And she has a mother!" answered the Duchess
of Manchester, who was all spirit, justice, and honour, and could not suppress sudden truth.

One of old Marlborough's capital mortifications sprang from a granddaughter.  The most beautiful
of her four charming daughters, Lady Sunderland,(123) left two sons,(124) the second Duke of
Marlborough, and John Spencer, who became her heir, and Anne Lady Bateman, and Lady Diana Spencer,
whom I have mentioned, and who became Duchess of Bedford.  The Duke and his brother, to humour
their grandmother, were in opposition, though the eldest she never loved.  He had good sense,
infinite generosity, and not more economy than was to be expected from a young man of warm
passions and such vast expectations.  He was modest and diffident too, but could not digest
total dependence on a capricious and avaricious grandmother.  HIS sister, Lady Bateman, had
the intriguing spirit of her father and grandfather, Earls of Sunderland.  She was connected
with Henry Fox, the first Lord Holland, and both had great influence over the Duke of Marlborough.
What an object would it be to Fox to convert to the court so great a subject as the Duke! Nor
was it much less important to his sister to give him a wife, who, with no reasons for expectation
of such shining fortune, should owe the obligation to her.  Lady Bateman struck the first stroke,
and persuaded her brother to marry a handsome young lady, who, unluckily, was daughter of Lord
Trevor, who had been a bitter enemy to his grandfather, the victorious Duke.  The grandam's
rage exceeded all bounds.  Having a portrait of Lady Bateman, she blackened the face, and wrote
on it, "Now her outside is as black as her inside." The duke she turned out of the little lodge
in Windsor Park; and then pretending that the new Duchess and her female cousins (eight Trevors)
had stripped the house and gardens, she had a puppet-show made with waxen figures, representing
the Trevors tearing up the shrubs, and the Duchess carrying off the chicken-coop under her arm.

Her fury did but increase when Mr. Fox prevailed on the Duke to go over to the court.  With
her coarse intemperate humour, she said, "that was the Fox that had stolen her goose."  Repeated
injuries at last drove the Duke to go to law with her.  Fearing that even no lawyer would come
up to the Billingsgate with which she was animated herself, she appeared in the court of justice,
and with some wit and infinite abuse, treated the laughing public with the spectacle of a woman
who had held the reigns of empire, metamorphosed into the widow Black-acre.  Her grandson,
in his suit, demanded a sword set with diamonds, given to his grandsire by the Emperor. "I
retained it," said the beldam, " lest he should pick out the diamonds and pawn them."

I will repeat but one more instance of her insolent asperity, which produced an admirable reply
of the famous Lady Mary -Wortley Montague.  Lady Sundon had received a pair of diamond ear-rings
as a bribe for procuring a considerable post in Queen Caroline's family for a certain peer;
and, decked with those jewels, paid a visit to the old Duchess; who, as soon as she was gone,
said, "What an impudent creature, to come hither with her bribe in her ear!"  "Madam," replied
Lady Mary Wortley, who was present, "how should people know where wine' is sold, unless a bush
is hung out?"

The Duchess of Buckingham was as much elated by owing her birth to James II.(125) as the Marlborough
was by the favour of his daughter.  Lady Dorchester,(126) the mother of the former, endeavoured
to curb that pride, and, one should have thought, took an effectual method, though one few
mothers would have practised.  "You need not be so vain," said the old profligate, "for you
are not the King's daughter, but Colonel Graham's." Graham was a fashionable man of those days
and noted for dry humour.  His legitimate daughter, the Countess of Berkshire, was extremely
like to the Duchess of Buckingham: "Well! well!" said Graham, "Kings are all powerful, and
one must not complain; but certainly the same man begot those two women."  To discredit the
wit of both parents, the Duchess never ceased labouring to restore the House of Stuart, and
to mark her filial devotion to it.  Frequent were her journeys to the Continent for that purpose.
She always stopped at Paris, visited the church where lay the unburied body of James, and wept
over it.  A poor Benedictine of the convent, observing her filial piety, took notice to her
grace that the velvet pall that covered the coffin was become threadbare-and so it remained.

Finding all her efforts fruitless, and perhaps aware that her plots were not undiscovered by
Sir Robert Walpole, who was remarkable for his intelligence, she made an artful double, and
resolved to try what might be done through him himself.  I forget how she contracted an acquaintance
with him: I do remember that more than once he received letters from the Pretender himself,
which probably were transmitted through her.  Sir Robert always carried them to George II.
who endorsed and returned them.  That negotiation not succeeding. the Duchess made a more home
push. Learning his extreme fondness for his daughter, (afterwards Lady Mary Churchill,) she
sent for Sir Robert, and asked him if he recollected what had not been thought too great a
reward to Lord Clarendon for restoring the royal family? He affected not to understand her.
"Was not he allowed," urged the zealous Duchess, "to match his daughter to the Duke of York?"
Sir Robert smiled, and left her.

Sir Robert being forced from court, the Duchess thought the moment (127) favourable, and took
a new journey to Rome; but conscious of the danger she might run of discovery, she made over
her estate to the famous Mr. Pulteney (afterwards Earl of Bath), and left the deed in his custody.
What was her astonishment, when on her return she redemanded the instrument!-It was mislaid-he
could not find it-he never could find it! The Duchess grew clamorous.  At last his friend Lord
Mansfield told him plainly,- he could never show his face unless he satisfied the Duchess.
Lord Bath did then sign a release to her of her estate. The transaction was recorded in print
by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, in a pamphlet that had great vogue, called a Congratulatory
Letter, with many other anecdotes of the same personage, and was not less acute than Sir Charles's
Odes on the same here.  The Duchess dying not long after Sir Robert's entrance into the House
of Lords, Lord Oxford, one of her executors, told him there, that the Duchess had struck Lord
Bath out of her will, and made him, Sir Robert, one of her trustees in his room. "Then," said
Sir Robert, laughing, @ I see, my lord, that I have got Lord Bath's place before he has got
mine." Sir Robert had artfully prevented the last.  Before he quitted the King, he persuaded
his Majesty to insist, as a preliminary to the change, that Mr. Pulteney should go into the
House of Peers, his great credit lying in the other house; and I remember my father's action
when he returned from court and told me what he had done-,, I have turned the key of the closet
on him,"-making that motion with his hand.  Pulteney had jumped at the proffered earldom, but
saw his error when too late; and was so enraged at his own oversight, that, when he went to
take the oaths in the House of Lords, he dashed his patent on the floor, and vowed he would
never take it up-but he had kissed the King's hand for it, and it was too late to recede.

But though Madam of Buckingham could not effect a coronation to her will, she indulged her
pompous mind with such puppet-shows as were appropriate to her rank.  She had made a funeral
for her husband as splendid as that of the great Marlborough: she renewed that pageant for
her only son, a weak lad, who died under age; and for herself; and prepared and decorated -waxen
dolls of him and of herself to be exhibited in glass-cases in Westminster Abbey.  It was for
the procession at her son's burial that she wrote to old Sarah of Marlborough to borrow the
triumphal car that had transported the corpse of the Duke. "It carried my Lord Marlborough,"
replied the other, and shall never be used for any body else."  "I have consulted the undertaker,"
replied the Buckingham, and he tells me I may have a finer for twenty pounds."

One of the last acts of Buckingham's life was marrying a grandson she had to a daughter of
Lord Hervey.  That intriguing man, sore, as I have said, at his disgrace, cast his eyes every
where to revenge or exalt himself.  Professions or recantations of any principles cost him
nothing: at least the consecrated day which was appointed for his first interview with the
Duchess made it presumed, that to obtain her wealth, with her grandson for his daughter, he
must have sworn fealty to the House of Stuart.  It was on the martyrdom of her grandfather:
she received him in the great drawing-room of Buckingham House, seated in a chair of state,
in deep mourning, attended by her women in like weeds, in memory of the royal martyr.

It will be a proper close to the history of those curious ladies to mention the anecdote of
Pope relative to them.  Having drawn his famous character of Atossa, he communicated it to
each Duchess, pretending it was levelled at the other.  The Buckingham believed him: the Marlborough
had more sense, and knew herself, and gave him a thousand pounds to suppress it;-and yet he
left the copy behind him!(128)

Bishop Burnet, from absence of mind, had drawn as strong a picture of herself to the Duchess
of Marlborough, as Pope did under covert of another lady.  Dining with the Duchess after the
Duke's disgrace, Burnet was comparing him to Belisarius: "But how," said she, "could so great
a general be so abandoned?" "Oh! Madam," said the Bishop, "do not you know what a brimstone
of a wife he had'!"

Perhaps you know this anecdote, and perhaps several others that I have been relating.  No matter;
they will go under the article of my dotage-and very properly-I began with tales of my nursery,
and prove that I have been writing in my second childhood.

H. W. January 13th, 1789.

(121) The Lady Henrietta, married to Lord Godolphin, who, by act of Parliament, succeeded as
Duchess of Marlborough.

(124) She had an elder son, who died young, while only Earl of Sunderland.  He had parts, and
all the ambition of his parents and of his family (which his younger brother had not); but
George II. had conceived such an aversion to his father, that he would not employ him.  The
young Earl at last asked Sir Robert Walpole for an ensigncy in the Guards.  The minister, astonished
at so humble a request from a man of such consequence, expressed his surprise.  "I ask it,"
said the young lord, "to ascertain whether it is determined that I shall never have any thing."
He died soon after at Paris.

(125) By Catherine Sedley, created by her royal lover Countess of Dorchester for life.-E.

(126) Lady Dorchester is well known for her wit, and for saying that she wondered for what
James chose his mistresses: "We are none of us handsome," said she; "and if we have wit, he
has not enough to find it out." But I do not know whether it is as public, that her style was
gross and shameless.  Meeting the Duchess of Portsmouth and Lady Orkney, the favourite of King
William, at the drawing-room of George the First, "God!" said she, "who would have thought
that we three whores should have met here?"  Having, after the King's abdication, married Sir
David Collyer, by whom she had two sons, she said to them, " If any body should call you sons
of a whore, you must bear it; for you are so: but if they call you bastards, fight till you
die; for you are an honest man's sons." Susan, Lady Bellasis, another of King James's mistresses,
had wit too, and no beauty.  Mrs. Godfrey had neither.  Grammont has recorded why she was chosen.

(127) I am not quite certain that, writing by memory at the distance of fifty years, I place
that journey exactly at the right period, nor whether it did not take place before Sir Robert's
fall.  Nothing material depends on the precise period.

(128) The story is thus told by Dr. Warton:-" These lines were shown to her grace, as if they
were intended for the portrait of the Duchess of Buckingham; but she soon stopped the person
who was reading them to her, as the Duchess of Portland informed me, and called out aloud,
"I cannot be so imposed upon; I see plainly enough for whom they are designed;" and abused
Pope most plentifully on the subject: though she was afterwards reconciled to him, and courted
him, and gave him a thousand pounds to suppress this portrait, which he a accepted, it is said,
by the persuasion of Mrs. M. Blount; and, after the Duchess's death, it was printed in a folio
sheet, 1746, and afterwards inserted in his Moral Essays.  This is the greatest blemish on
our poet's moral character."-E.

The following extracts from Letters of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, were copied by me from
the original letters addressed to the Earl of Stair, left by him to Sir David Dalrymple, his
near relative, and lent to me by Sir David's brother, Mr. Alexander Dalrymple, long employed
as Geographer in the service of the East India company.  They formed part of a large volume
of ms. letters, chiefly from the same person.

The Duchess of Marlborough's virulence, her prejudices, her style of writing, are already well
known, and every line of these extracts will only serve to confirm the same opinion of all
three.  But it will, probably, be thought curious thus to be able to compare the notes of the
opposite political parties, and their different account of the same trifling facts, magnified
by the prejudices of both into affairs of importance. As to Norfolk House, (129) I have heard
there is a great deal of company, and that the Princess of Wales, tho' so very young, behaves
so as to please every body; and I think her conversation is much more proper and decent for
a drawing-room than the wise queen Caroline's was, who never was half an hour without saying
something shocking to some body or other, even when she intended to oblige, and generally very
improper discourse for a public room.

London, December 24th, 1737. My Lord, I received the favour of yours of the 17th December yesterday.
I have nothing material to say to you since my last.  His Majesty saw the Queen's women servants
first, which was a very mournful sight, for they all cried extremely; and his Majesty was so
affected that he began to speak, but went out of the room to recover himself.  And yesterday
he saw the foreign ministers and his horses, which I remember Dean Swift gives a great character
of; and was very sorry to leave them for the conversation of his countrymen in England.; and
I think he was much in the right.

[See P. 98. Reminiscences, Chapter Vii)

Marlborough House, Nov. 15, 1737. It is not many days since I wrote to your lordship by post,
but one can't be sure those letters are sent.  However, I have a mind to give you an account
of what, perhaps, you may not have so particularly from any other hand.  This day, se'nnight
the Queen was taken extremely ill; the physicians were sent for, and from the account that
was given, they treated her as if she had the gout in her stomach: but, upon a thorough investigation
of the matter, a surgeon desired that she would put her hand where the pain was that she complained
of, which she did; and the surgeon, following her hand with his, found it was a very large
rupture, which had been long Concealed.  Upon this, immediately they cut it, and some little
part of the gut, which was discoloured.  Few of the knowing people have had any hopes for many
days; for they still apprehend a mortification, and she can't escape it unless the physicians
can make something pass thro' her, which they have not yet been able to do in so many days.
The King and the Royal Family have taken leave of her more than once; and his Majesty has given
her leave to make her will, which she has done; but I fancy it will be in such a manner that
few, if any, will know what her money amounts to.  Sir Robert Walpole was in Norfolk, and came
to -London but last night.  I can't but think he must be extremely uneasy at this misfortune;
for I have a notion that many of his troops will slacken very much, if not quite leave him,
when they see he has lost his sure support.  But there is so much folly, and mean corruption, etc.

London, December 1st, 1737. . . . . As to what has passed in the Queen's illness, and since
her death, one can't depend on much one hears; and they are things that it is no great matter
whether they are true or false. But one thing was odd: whether out of folly, or any thing else,
I can't say, but the Duke of Newcastle did not send Sir Robert Walpole news of her illness,
nor of her danger, as soon as he might have done; and after he came to town, which was but
a few days before she died, and when she could no more live than she can now come out of her
coffin, the physicians, and all that attended her, were ordered to say she was better, and
that they had some hopes.  What the use of that was I cannot conceive.  And the occasion of
her death is still pretended to be a secret: yet it is known that she had a rupture, and had
it for many years; that she had imposthumes that broke, and that some of the guts were mortified.
This is another mystery which I don't comprehend; for what does it signify what one dies of,
except the pain it gives more than common dissolutions? etc.

[See p. 100. Reminiscences, Chapter Vii)

I AM Of the opinion, from woful experience, that, from flattery and want of understanding,
most princes are alike; and, therefore, it is to no purpose to argue against their passions,
but to defend ourselves, at all events, against them.

[See P. 100. Reminiscences, Chapter VII]

Wimbledon, 17th Aug. 1737. There has been a very extraordinary quarrel at court, which, I believe,
nobody will give you so exact an account of as myself. The 31st of last month the Princess
fell in labour.  The King and Queen both knew that she was to lie in -,it St. James's, where
every thing was prepared.  It was her first child, and so little a way to London, that she
thought it less hazard to go immediately away from Hampton Court to London, where she had all
the assistance that could be, and every thing prepared, than to stay at Hampton Court, where
she had nothing, and might be forced to make use of a country midwife.  There was not a minute's
time to be lost in debating this matter, nor in ceremonials; the Princess begging earnestly
of the Prince to carry her to St. James's, in such a hurry that gentlemen went behind the coach
like footmen.  They got to St. James's safe, and she was brought to bed in one hour after.
Her Majesty followed them as soon as she could, but did not come till it was all over.  However,
she expressed a great deal of anger to the Prince for having carried her away, tho' she and
the child were very well.  I should have thought it had been most natural for a grandmother
to have said she had been mightily frightened, but was glad it was so well over.  The Prince
said all the respectful and dutiful things imaginable to her and the King, desiring her Majesty
to support the reasons which made him go away as he did without acquainting his Majesty with
it: and, I believe, all human creatures will allow that this was natural, for a man not to
debate a thing of this kind, nor to lose a minute's time in ceremony, which was very useless,
considering that it is a great while since the King has spoke to him, or taken the least notice
of him.  The Prince told her Majesty he intended to go that morning to pay his duty to the
King, but she advised him not.  This was Monday morning, and she said Wednesday was time enough;
and, indeed, in that I think her Majesty was in the right.  the Prince submitted to her counsel,
and only writ a most submissive and respectful letter to his Majesty, giving his reasons for
what he had done.  And this conversation ended, that he hoped his Majesty would do him the
honour to be godfather to his daughter, and that he would be pleased to name who the godmothers
should be; and that he left all the directions of the christening to his Majesty's pleasure.
The queen answered that it would be thought the asking the King to be godfather was too great
a liberty, and advised him not to do it.  When the Prince led the Queen to her coach, which
she would not have had him done, there was a great concourse of people; and, notwithstanding
all that had passed before, she expressed so much kindness that she hugged and kissed him with
great passion.  the King, after this, sent a message in writing, by my Lord Essex, in the following
words:-that his Majesty looked upon what the Prince had done, in carrying the Princess to London
in such a manner, as a deliberate indignity offered to himself and to the Queen, and resented
it in the highest degree, and forbid him the Court.  I must own I cleared Sir Robert in my
own mind of this counsel, thinking he was not in town: but it has proved otherwise, for he
was in town; and the message is drawn up in such a manner that nobody doubts of its being done
by sir Robert.  All the sycophants and agents of the court spread millions of falsities on
this occasion; and all the language there was, that this was so great a crime that even those
who went with the Prince ought to be proscribed.  How this will end nobody yet knows; at least
I am sure I don't; but I know there was a council today held at Hampton court.  I have not
heard yet of any christening being directed, but for that I am in no manner of pain: for, if
it be never christened, I think 'tis in a better state than a great many devout people that
I know.  Some talk as if they designed to take the child away from the Princess, to be under
the care of her Majesty, who professes vast kindness to the Princess; and all the anger is
at the Prince.  Among common subjects I think the law is, that nobody that has any interest
in an estate is to have any thing to do with the person who is heir to it.  What prejudice
this sucking child can do to the crown I don't see; but, to be sure, her Majesty will be very
careful of it.  What I apprehend most. is, that the crown will be lost long before this little
Princess can possibly enjoy it; and, if what I have heard to-day be true, I think the scheme
of France is going to open; for I was told there was an ambassador to come from France whose
goods had been landed in England, and that they have been sent back.  But I won't answer for
the truth of that, as I will upon every thing else in this letter.

[See p. 100. Reminiscences, Chapter VII]

June 20th, 1738. My Lord, I write to you this post, to give you an account of what I believe
nobody else will so particularly, that Madame Walmond (130) was presented in the drawing-room
to his Majesty on Thursday.  As she arrived some days before, there can be no doubt that it
was not the first meeting, tho' the manner of her reception had the appearance of it; for his
Majesty went up to her and kissed her on both sides, which is an honour, I believe, never any
lady had from a king in public.  And when his Majesty went away, Lord Harrington presented
the great men in the ministry and the foreign ministers in the drawing-room; the former of
which performed their part with the utmost respect and submission.  This is, likewise, quite
new; for, though all kings have had mistresses, they were attended at their own lodgings, and
not in so public a manner.  I conclude they performed that ceremony too; but they could not
lose the first opportunity of paying their respects, though ever so improperly.

These great men were, the Duke of Newcastle, Sir Robert Walpole, my Lord Wilmington, my Lord
Harrington, and Mr. Pelham.  My Lord Hervey had not the honour to be on the foot of a minister.
. . .

I have nothing more to say, but that this Madame Walmond is at present in a mighty mean dirty
lodging in St. James's Street. Her husband came with her, but he is going away; and that house
that was Mr. Seymour's, in Hyde Park, which opens into the King's garden, is fitting up for
her; -and the Duchess of Kendal's lodgings are making ready for her at St. James's.  There
is nothing more known at present as to the settlement, but that directions are given for one
upon the establishment of Ireland. perhaps that mayn't exceed the Duchess of Kendal's, which
was three thousand pounds a-year.  But 'tis easy for the first minister to increase that as
she pleases.

[See p. 101.]

London, December 3rd, 1737. I saw one yesterday that dined with my Lord Fanny, (131) who, as
soon as he had dined, was sent for to come up to his Majesty, and there is all the appearance
that can be of great favour to his lordship.  I mentioned him in my last, and I will now give
you an account of some things concerning his character, that I believe you don't know.  What
I am going to say I am sure is as true as if I had been a transactor in it myself.  And I will
begin the relation with Mr. Lepelle, my Lord Fanny's wife's father, having made her a cornet
in his regiment as soon as she was born, which is no more wrong to the design of an army than
if she had been a son: and she was paid many years after she was a maid of honour. She was
extreme forward and pert; and my Lord Sunderland got her a pension of the late King, it being
too ridiculous to continue her any longer an officer in the army.  And into the bargain, she
was to be a spy; but what she could tell to deserve a pension, I cannot comprehend.  However,
King George the First used to talk to her very much; and this encouraged my Lord Fanny and
her to undertake a very extraordinary project: and she went to the drawing-room every night,
and publicly attacked his Majesty in a most vehement manner, insomuch that it was the diversion
of all the town; which alarmed the Duchess of Kendal, and the ministry that governed her, to
that degree, lest the King should be put in the opposers' hands, that they determined to buy
my Lady H- off; and they gave her 4000 pounds to desist, which she did, and my Lord Fanny bought
a good house with it, and furnished it very well.

[See p. 106. Reminiscences, Chapter IX]

London, March 19th, 1738. My Lord, I have received the favour of yours of the 11th by the post,
but not that which you mention by another hand.  And since you can like such sort of accounts
as I am able to give you, I will continue to do it.  I think it is very plain now that Sir
Robert don't think it worth his while to make any proposals where it was once suspected he
would.  And his wedding was celebrated as if he had been King of France, and the apartments
furnished in the richest manner: crowds of people of the first quality being presented to the
bride, who is the daughter of a clerk that sung the psalms in a church where Dr. Sacheverell
was.  After the struggle among the court ladies who should have the honour of presenting her,
which the Duchess of Newcastle obtained, it was thought more proper to have her presented by
one of her own family; otherwise it would look as if she had no alliances: and therefore that
ceremony was performed by Horace Walpole's wife, who was daughter to my tailor, Lumbar.  I
read in a print lately, that an old gentleman, very rich, had married a maiden lady with two
fatherless children but the printer did not then know the gentleman's name.

March 27th, 1738. 'I think I did not tell you that the Duke of Dorset waited on my Lady Walpole
to congratulate her marriage, with the same ceremony as if it had been one of the Royal Family,
with his white staff, which has not been used these many years, but when they attend the Crown.
But such a wretch as he is I hardly know; and his wife, whose passion is only money, assists
him in his odious affair with Lady Betty Jermyn, who has a great deal to dispose of; who, notwithstanding
the great pride of the Berkeley family, married an innkeeper's son.  But indeed there was some
reason for that; for she was ugly, without a portion, and in her youth had an unlucky accident
with one of her father's servants; and by that match she got money to entertain herself all
manner of ways. I tell you these things, which did not happen in your time of knowledge, which
is a melancholy picture of what the world is come to; for this strange woman has had a great
influence over many.

Feb. 24th. 1738. Monday next is fixed for presenting Mrs. Skerrit at court: and there has been
great solicitation from the court ladies who should do it, in which the Duchess of Newcastle
has succeeded, and all the apartment is made ready for Sir Robert's lady, at his house at the
Cockpit. (132)  I never saw her in my life, but at auctions; but I remember I liked her as
to behaviour very well, and I believe she has a great deal of sense: and I am not one of the
number that wonder so much at this match; for the King of France married Madame de Maintenon,
and many men have done the same thing.  But as to the public, I do believe never was any man
so great a villain as Sir Robert.

Wednesday, Feb. 16th, 1741. .....Some changes are made as to employments; but very few are
brought in but such as will be easily governed, and brought to act so as to keep their places.
I have inquired often about your lordship, who I have not yet heard named in this alteration.
And I have been told that Lords Chesterfield and Gower are to have nothing in the government,
which I think a very ill sign of what is intended;  because that can be for no reason but because
you are all such men as are incapable of ever being prevailed on by any arts to act any thing
contrary to honour and the true interests of our country.

                     Correspondence of Horace walpole
                              Earl of Orford

121 Letter 1 To Richard West, Esq. (133) King's College, Nov 9, 1735,

Dear West, You expect a long letter from me, and have said in verse all that I intended to
have said in far inferior prose.  I intended filling three or four sides with exclamations
against a University life; but you have showed me how strongly they may be expressed in three
or four lines.  I can't build without straw; nor have I the ingenuity of the spider, to spin
fine lines out of dirt: a master of a college would make but a miserable figure as a hero of
a poem, and Cambridge sophs are too low to introduce into a letter that aims not at punning:

Haud equidem invideo vati, quem pulpita pascunt.

But why mayn't we hold a classical correspondence? I can never forget the many agreeable hours
we have passed in reading Horace and Virgil; and I think they are topics will never grow stale.
Let us extend the Roman empire, and cultivate two barbarous towns o'er -run with rusticity
and Mathematics.  The creatures are so used to a circle, that they Plod on in the same eternal
round, with their whole view confined to a punctum, cujus nulla est pars: "Their time a moment,
and a point their space."

Orabunt causas melius, coelique meatus Describent radio, et surgentia sidera dicent Tu coluisse
novem Musas, Romane, memento; Hae tibi crunt artes. . . .

We have not the least poetry stirring here; for I can't call verses on the 5th of November
and 30th of January by that name, more than four lines on a chapter in the New Testament is
an epigram.  Tydeus (134) rose and set at Eton: he is only known here to be a scholar of King's.
Orosmades  and Almanzor are just the same; that is, I am almost the only person they are acquainted
with, and consequently the only person acquainted with their excellencies.  Plato improves
every day; so does my friendship with him.  These three divide my whole time, though I believe
you will guess there is no quadruple alliance; (135) that was a happiness which I only enjoyed
when you was at Eton.  A short account of the Eton people at Oxford would much oblige, my dear
West, your faithful friend, H. WALPOLE.

(133) Richard West was the only son of the Right Honourable Richard West, Lord Chancellor of
Ireland, by Elizabeth, daughter of the celebrated Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury.  When this
correspondence commences, Mr. West was nineteen years old, and Mr. Walpole one year younger.
[West died on the 1st of January, 1742, at the premature age of twenty-six.  He had a great
genius for poetry.  His correspondence with Gray, and several of his poems, are included in
the collection of letters published by Mr. Mason. West's father published an able discourse
of treasons and bills of attainder, and a tract on the manner of creating peers.  He also wrote
several essays in "The Freethinker;" and was the reputed author of a tragedy called "Hecuba;"
which was performed at Drury Lane theatre in 1726.]

(134) Tydeus, Orosmades, Almanzor, and Plato, were names which had been given by them to some
of their Eton schoolfellows.

(135) Thus as boys they had called the intimacy formed at Eton between Walpole, Gray, West,
and Ashton.

122 Letter 2 To George Montagu, Esq.

(136) George Montagu was the son of Brigadier-General Edward Montagu, and nephew to the Earl
of Halifax.  He was member of parliament for Northampton, usher of the black rod in Ireland
during the lieutenancy of the Earl of Halifax, ranger of Salsey Forest, and private secretary
to Lord North when chancellor of the exchequer.

(138) Colonel Charles Montagu, afterwards Lieutenant-General, and Knight of the Bath, and brother
of George Montagu.  He married Elizabeth Villiers, Viscountess Grandison, daughter of the Earl
of Grandison.

124 Letter 4 To George Montagu, Esq. King's College, May 20, 1736.

Dear George: You will excuse my not having written to you, when you hear I have been a jaunt
to Oxford.  As you have seen it, I shall only say I think it one of the most agreeable places
I ever set my eyes on.  In our way thither we stopped at the Duke of Kent's, (139) at Wrest.
(140)  On the great staircase is a picture of the duchess; (141) I said it was very like; oh,
dear sir! said Mrs. Housekeeper, it's too handsome for my lady duchess; her grace's chin is
much longer than that.

In the garden are monuments in memory of Lord Harold (142) Lady Glenorchy, (143) the late duchess,(144)
and the present duke.  At Lord Clarendon's (145) at Cornbury,(146) is a prodigious quantity
of Vandykes; but I had not time to take down any of their dresses.  By the way, you gave me
no account of the last masquerade. Coming back, we saw Easton Neston,(147) a seat of Lord Pomfret,
where in an old greenhouse is a wonderful fine statue of Tully, haranguing a numerous assembly
of decayed emperors, vestal virgins with new noses, Colossuses, Venuses, headless carcases,
and carcaseless heads, pieces of tombs, and hieroglyphics.(148)  I saw Althorp(149) the same
day, where are a vast many pictures-some mighty good; a gallery with the Windsor beauties,
and Lady Bridgewater(150) who is full as handsome as any of them; a bouncing head of, I believe,
Cleopatra, called there the Duchess of Mazarine.  The park is enchanting.  I forgot to tell
you I was at Blenheim, where I saw nothing but a cross housekeeper, and an impertinent porter,
except a few pictures, a quarry of stone that looked at a distance like a great house, and
about this quarry, quantities of inscriptions in honour of the Duke of Marlborough, and I think
of her grace too.

Adieu! dear George, Yours ever.

The verses are not published.

(139) Henry de Grey, Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Kent, son of Anthony Earl of Kent, and Mary,
daughter of Lord Lucas. [The duke, who had been so created in 1710, having lost all his sons
during his lifetime, obtained a new patent in 1740, creating him Marquis Grey, with remainder
to his grand-daughter Jemima Campbell, daughter of his eldest daughter, Lady amabel Grey, by
her husband John, third Earl of Breadalbane.  On the death of the duke, in June 1740, the marquisate
of Grey and barony of Lucas, together with the Wrest House and all the vast estates of the
duke, devolved upon his grand-daughter, Lady Jemima Campbell, then Lady Jemima Royston, she
having married Philip Viscount Royston, eldest son of the Earl of Hardwicke, by whom she had
two daughters, Amabel married in July 1772, to Lord Polwarth, only son of the Earl of Marchmont,
created a peer of Great Britain by the title of Baron Hume of Berwick, and who died in 1781
without issue: her ladyship was advanced to the dignity of Countess de Grey by letters patent,
in 1816, with remainder of that earldom to her sister Mary Jemima, wife of Thomas second Lord
Grantham, and that lady's male issue.  Lady Grantham died in 1830; and upon the death of the
countess, in 1833, she was succeeded under the patent by her nephew Lord Grantham, the present
Earl de Grey.]

(140) Wrest House in Bedfordshire. [It is remarkable that, from the death of the Duke of Kent,
Wrest House has never remained a second generation in the same family, but has descended successively

now vested in that of Robinson Lord Grantham, the great-great-grandson of the duke.)

126 Letter 5 To George Montagu, Esq. King's College, May 30, 1736.

Dear George, You show me in the prettiest manner how much you like Petronius Arbiter; I have
heard you commend him, but I am more pleased with your tacit approbation of writing like him,
prose interspersed with verse: I shall send you soon in return some poetry interspersed with
prose; I mean the Cambridge congratulation with the notes, as you desired.  I have transcribed
the greatest part of what was tolerable at the coffee-houses; but by most of what you will
find, you will hardly think I have left any thing worse behind.  There is lately come out a
new piece, called A Dialogue between Philemon and Hydaspes on false religion, by one Mr. Coventry,(151)
A.M., and fellow, formerly fellow-commoner, of Magdalen.  He is a young man, but 'tis really
a pretty thing.  If you cannot get it in town, I will send it with the verses.  He accounts
for superstition in a new manner, and I think a Just One; attributing it to disappointments
in love.  He don't resolve it all into that bottom; ascribes it almost wholly as the source
of female enthusiasm; and I dare say there's ne'er a girl from the age of fourteen to four-and-twenty,
but will subscribe to his principles, and own, if the dear man were dead that she loves, she
would settle all her affection on heaven, whither he was gone.

Who would not be an Artemisia, and raise the stately mausoleum to her lord; then weep and watch
incessant over it like the Ephesian matron!

I have heard of one lady, who had not quite so great a veneration for her husband's tomb, but
preferred lying alone in one, to lying on his left hand; perhaps she had an aversion to the
German custom of left-handed wives.  I met yesterday with a pretty little dialogue on the subject
of constancy tis between a traveller and a dove

LE PASSANT. Que fais tu dans ce bois, plaintive Tourturelle?

LA ToURTURELLE. Je g`emis, j'ai perdu ma compagne fidelle.

LE PASSANT. Ne crains tu pas que l'oiseleur Ne te fasse mourir comme elle?

La Tourturelle. Si ce n'est lui, ce sera ma douleur.

'Twould have been a little more apposite, if she had grieved for her lover.  I have ventured
to turn it into that view, lengthened it, and spoiled it, as you shall see.

P.-Plaintive turtle, cease your moan; Hence away; In this dreary wood alone Why d'ye stay?

T.-These tears, alas! you see flow For my mate! P.-Dread you not from net or bow His sad fate?

T.-If, ah! if they neither kill, Sorrow will.

You will excuse this gentle nothing, I mean mine, when I tell you, I translated it out of pure
good-nature for the use of a disconsolate wood-pigeon in our grove, that was made a widow by
the barbarity of a gun.  She coos and calls me so movingly, 'twould touch your heart to hear
her. I protest to you it grieves me to pity her.  She is so allicholy as any thing.  I'll warrant
you now she's as sorry as one of us would be.  Well, good man, he's gone, and he died like
a lamb.  She's an unfortunate woman, but she must have patience; tis what we must all come
to, and so as I was saying, Dear George, good bye t'ye, Yours sincerely.

P. S. I don't know yet when I shall leave Cambridge.

is transcribed from the MSS. of the Rev.  W. Cole:-

"When Henry Coventry first came to the University, he was of a religious turn of mind, as was
Mr. Horace Walpole; even so much so as to go with Ashton, his then great friend, to pray with
the prisoners in the Castle.  Afterwards, both Mr. Coventry and Mr. Walpole took to the infidel
side of the question."-E.

127 Letter 6 To Richard West, Esq. King's College, Aug. 17, 1736.

Dear West, Gray is at Burnham,(152) and, what is surprising, has not been at Eton.  Could you
live so near it without seeing it? That dear scene of our quadruple-alliance would furnish
me with the most agreeable recollections.  'Tis the head of our genealogical table, that is
since sprouted out into the two branches of Oxford and Cambridge.  You seem to be the eldest
son, by having got a whole inheritance to yourself; while the manor of Granta is to be divided
between your three younger brothers, Thomas of Lancashire, [153] Thomas of London [154] and
Horace.  We don't wish you dead to enjoy your seat, but your seat dead to enjoy you.  I hope
you are a mere elder brother, and live upon what your father left you, and in the way you 'were
brought up in, poetry: but we are supposed to betake ourselves to some trade, as logic, philosophy,
or mathematics. If I should prove a mere younger brother, and not turn to any Profession, would
you receive me, and supply me out of your stock, where you have such plenty? I have been so
used to the delicate food of Parnassus, that I can never condescend to apply to the grosser
studies of Alma Mater.  Sober cloth of syllogism colour suits me ill; or, what's worse, I hate
clothes that one must prove to be of no colour at all.  If the Muses coelique vias et sidera
monstrent, and qua vi maria alta lumescant.  why accipiant: but 'tis thrashing, to study philosophy
in the abstruse authors.  I am not against cultivating these studies, as they are certainly
useful; but then they quite neglect all polite literature, all knowledge of this world. Indeed,
such people have not much occasion for this latter; for they shut themselves up from it, and
study till they know less than any one.  Great mathematicians have been of great use; but the
generality of them are quite unconversible: they frequent the stars, sub pedibusque vident
nubes, but they can't see through them.  I tell you what I see; that by living amongst them,
I write of nothing else: my letters are all parallelograms, two sides equal to two sides; and
every paragraph an axiom, that tells you nothing but what every mortal almost knows.  By the
way, your letters come under this description; for they contain nothing but what almost every
mortal knows too, that knows you-that is, they are extremely agreeable, which they know you
are capable of making them:-no one is better acquainted with it than Your sincere friend.

off his horse, under Newgate, as he was going to proclaim Bartholomew Fair.  Lady Walpole died
in the August of the year in which the present letter was written, and Sir Robert soon afterwards
married @Miss Skerrit.  Walpole's well-known fondness for his mother is alluded to by Gray,
in a letter to West, dated 22d August, 1737:-" But while I write to you, I hear the bad news
of lady Walpole's death, on Saturday night last.  Forgive me if the thought of what my poor
Horace must feel on that account obliges me to have done."]

129 Letter 8 To George Montagu, Esq. Christopher Inn, Eton.

The Christopher.  Lord! how great I used to think anybody just landed at the Christopher! But
here are no boys for me to send for-here I am, like Noah, just returned into his old world
again, with all sorts of queer feels about me.  By the way, the clock strikes the old cracked
sound-I recollect so much, and remember so little-and want to play about-and am so afraid of
my playfellows-and am ready to shirk Ashton and can't help making fun of myself-and envy a
dame over the way, that has just locked in her boarders, and is going to sit down in a little
hot parlour to a very bad supper, so comfortably!  and I could be so jolly a dog if I did not
fat, which, by the way, is the first time the word was ever applicable to me.  In short, I
should be out of all bounds if I was to tell you half I feel, how young again I am one minute,
and how old the next.  But do come and feel with me, when you will-to-morrow-adieu! If I don't
compose myself a little more before Sunday morning, when Ashton is to preach, I shall certainly
be in a bill for laughing at church; but how to belt it, to see him in the pulpit, when the
last time I saw him here, was standing up funking at a conduit to be catechised.  Good night;
yours.

134 Letter 11 To Richard West, Esq. Rheims, (163) June 18, 1739, N. S.

Dear West, How I am to fill up this letter is not easy to divine.  I have consented that Gray
shall give an account of our situation and proceedings; (164) and have left myself at the mercy
of my own' invention--a most terrible resource, and which I shall avoid applying to if I can
possibly help it.  I had prepared the ingredients for a description of a ball, and was just
ready to serve it up to you, but he has plucked it from me.  However, I was resolved to give
you an account of a particular song and dance in it, and was determined to write the words
and Sing the tune just as I folded up my letter: but as it would, ten to one, be opened before
it gets to you, I am forced to lay aside this thought, though an admirable one.  Well, but
now I have put it into your head, I suppose you won't rest without it.  For that individual
one, believe me 'tis nothing without the tune and the dance; but to stay your stomach, I -will
send you one of their vaudevilles or Ballads, (165) which they sing at the comedy after their
petites pi`eces.

You must not wonder if all my letters resemble dictionaries, with French on one side and English
on t'other; I deal in nothing else at present, and talk a couple of words of each language
alternately, from morning till night.  This has put my mouth a little out of tune at present
but I am trying to recover the use of it by reading the newspapers aloud at breakfast, and
by shewing the title-pages of all my English books.  Besides this, I have paraphrased half
of the first act of your new GustavUS (166) which was sent us to Paris: a most dainty performance,
and just what you say of it.  Good night, I am sure you must be tired: if you are not, I am.
yours ever.

(163) Mr. Walpole, with his cousin Henry Seymour Conway and Mr. Gray, resided three months
at Rheims, principally to acquire the French language.

(164) Gray's letter to West has not been preserved; but one addressed to his mother, on the
21 st of June, containing an account of Rheims and the society, is printed in his Works, vol.
ii. p. 50.-E.

(165) This ballad does not appear.

(166) The tragedy of "Gustavus Vasa," by Henry Brooke, author of "The Fool of Quality."  It
was rehearsed at Drury Lane; but, as it was supposed to satirize Sir Robert Walpole, it was
prohibited to be acted.  This, however, did Brooke no injury, as he was encouraged to publish
the play by subscription.-E.

134 Letter 12 To Richard  West, Esq. Rheims, July 20, 1739.

Gray says, Indeed you ought to write to West.-Lord, child, so I would, if I knew what to write
about.  If I were in London and he at Rheims, I would send him volumes about peace and war,
Spaniards, camps, and conventions; but d'ye think he cares sixpence to know who is gone to
Compiegne, and when they come back, or who won and lost four livres at quadrille last night
at Mr. Cockbert's?--No, but you may tell him what you have heard of Compiegne; that they have
balls twice a week after the play, and that the Count d'Eu gave the king a most flaring entertainment
in the camp, where the Polygone was represented in flowering shrubs.  Dear West, these are
the things I must tell you; I don't know how to make 'em look significant, unless you will
be a Rhemois for a little moment.(167)  I wonder you can stay out of the city so long, when
we are going to have all manner of diversions.  The comedians return hither from Compiegne
in eight days, for example; and in a very little of time one attends the regiment of the king,
three battalions and an hundred of officers; all men of a certain fashion, very amiable, and
who know their world.  Our women grow more gay, more lively, from day to day, in expecting
them; Mademoiselle la Reine is brewing a wash of a finer dye, and brushing up her eyes for
their arrival.  La Barone already counts upon fifteen of them: and Madame Lelu, finding her
linen robe conceals too many beauties, has bespoke one of gauze.

I won't plague you any longer with people you don't know, I mean French ones; for you must
absolutely hear of an Englishman that lately appeared at Rheims.  About two days ago, about
four o'clock in the afternoon, and about an hour after dinner,-from all which you may conclude
we dine at two o'clock,-as we were picking our teeth round a littered table and in a crumby
room, Gray in an undress, Mr. Conway in a morning gray coat, and I in a trim white night-gown
and slippers, very much out of order, with a very little cold, a message discomposed us all
of a sudden, with a service to Mr. Walpole from Mr. More, and that, if he pleased, he would
wait on him.  We scuttled upstairs in great confusion, but with no other damage than the flinging
down two or three glasses and the dropping a slipper by the way.  Having ordered the room to
be cleaned out, and sent a very civil response to Mr. More, we began to consider who Mr. More
should be.  Is it Mr. More of Paris! No.  Oh, 'tis Mr. More, my Lady Teynham's husband?  No,
it can't be he.  A Mr. More, then, that lives in the Halifax family?  No. In short, after thinking
of ten thousand more Mr. Mores, we concluded it could never be a one of 'em.  By this time
Mr.  More arrives; but such a Mr. More!  a young gentleman out of the wilds of Ireland, who
has never been in England, but has got all the ordinary language of that kingdom; has been
two years at Paris, where he dined at an ordinary with the refugee Irish, and learnt fortification-,,
which he does not understand at all, and which yet is the only thing he knows.  In short, he
is a young swain of very uncouth phrase, inarticulate speech, and no ideas. This hopeful child
is riding post into Lorrain, or any where else, he is not certain; for if there is a war he
shall go home again: for we must give the Spaniards another drubbing, you know; and if the
Dutch do but join us, we shall blow up all the ports in Europe; for our ships are our bastions,
and our ravelines, and our hornworks; and there's a devilish wide ditch for 'em to pass, which
they can't fill up with things-Here Mr. Conway helped him to fascines.  By this time I imagine
you have laughed at him as much, and were as tired of him as we were; but he's gone.  This
is the day that Gray and I intended for the first of a southern circuit; but as Mr. Selwyn
and George Montagu design us a visit here, we have put off our journey for some weeks.  When
we get a little farther, I hope our memories will brighten: at present they are but dull, dull
as Your humble servant ever.

P. S. I thank you ten thousand times for your last letter: when I have as much wit and as much
poetry in me, I'll send you as good an one.  Good night, child!

136 Letter 13 To Richard West, Esq. >From a Hamlet among the Mountains of Savoy, Sept. 28,
1739, N. S.

Precipices, mountains, torrents, wolves, rumblings, Salvator Rosa-the pomp of our park and
the meekness of our palace!  Here we are, the lonely lords of glorious, desolate prospects.
I have kept a sort of resolution which I made, of not writing to you as long as I staid in
France: I am now a quarter of an hour out of it, and write to you.  Mind, 'tis three months
since we heard from you.  I begin this letter -among the clouds; where I shall finish, my neighbour
Heaven probably knows: 'tis an odd wish in a mortal letter, to hope not to finish it on this
side the atmosphere.  You will have a billet tumble to you from the stars hen you least think
of it; and that I should write it too!  Lord, how potent that sounds! But I am to undergo many
transmigrations before I come to "yours ever." Yesterday I was a shepherd of Dauphin`e; to-day
an Alpine savage; to-morrow a Carthusian monk; and Friday a Swiss Calvinist.  I have one quality
which I find remains with me in all worlds and in all aethers; I brought it with me from your
world, and am admired for it in this-'tis my esteem for you: this is a common thought among
you, and you will laugh at it, but it is new here: as new to remember one's friends in the
world one has left, as for you to remember those you have lost.

Aix in Savoy, Sept. 30th.

We are this minute come in here, and here's an awkward abb`e this minute come in to us.  I
asked him if he would sit down.  Oui, oui, oui.  He has ordered us a radish soup for supper,
and has brought a chess-board to play with Mr. Conway.  I have left 'em in the act, and am
set down to write to you.  Did you ever see any thing like the prospect we saw yesterday? I
never did.  We rode three leagues to see the Grande Chartreuse; (168) expected bad roads and
the finest convent in the kingdom.  We were disappointed pro and con.  The building is large
and plain, and has nothing remarkable but its primitive simplicity; they entertained us in
the neatest manner, with eggs, pickled salmon, dried fish, conserves, cheese, butter, grapes,
and figs, and pressed us mightily to lie there.  We tumbled into the hands of a lay-brother,
who, unluckily having the charge of the meal and bran, showed us little besides.  They desired
us to set down our names in the list of strangers, where, among others, we found two mottos
of our countrymen, for whose stupidity and brutality we blushed.  The first was of Sir j *
* * D * * *, who had wrote down the first stanza of justum et tenacem, altering the last line
to Mente quatit Carthusiana.  The second was of one D * *, Coelum ipsum petimus stultitia;
et hic ventri indico bellum.  The Goth!-But the road, West, the road!  winding round a prodigious
mountain, and surrounded with others, all shagged with hanging woods, obscured with pines,
or lost in clouds!  Below, a torrent breaking through cliffs, and tumbling through fragments
of rocks! Sheets of @cascades forcing their silver speed down channelled precipices, and hasting
into the roughened river at the bottom! Now and then an old foot-bridge, with a broken rail,
a leaning cross, a cottage, or the ruin of an hermitage!  This sounds too bombast and too romantic
to one that has not seen it, too cold for one that has.  If I could send you my letter post
between two lovely tempests that echoed each other's wrath you might have some idea of this
noble roaring scene, as you were reading it. Almost on the summit, upon a fine verdure, but
without any prospect, stands the Chartreuse.  We staid there two hours, rode back through this
charming picture, wished for a painter, wished to be poets! Need I tell you we wished for you?
Good night!

Geneva, Oct. 2.

By beginning a new date, I should begin a new letter; but I have seen nothing yet, and the
Post is going Out: 'tis a strange tumbled dab, and dirty too, I am sending you; but what can
I do? There is no possibility of writing such a long history over again.  I find there are
many English in the town; Lord Brook, (169) Lord Mansel, (170) Lord Hervey's eldest son,(171)
and a son of-of Mars and Venus, or of Antony and Cleopatra, or, in short, of-.  This is the
boy, in the bow of whose hat Mr. Hedges pinned a pretty epigram.  I don't know if you ever
heard it; I'll suppose you never did, because it will fill up my letter:

"Give but Cupid's dart to me, Another Cupid I shall be: No more distinguish'd from the other,
Than Venus would be from my mother."

Scandal says, Hedges thought the two last very like; and it says too, that she was not his
enemy for thinking so.

Adieu! Gray and I return to Lyons in three days.  Harry stays here.  Perhaps at our return
we may find a letter from you: it ought to be very full of excuses, for you have been a lazy
creature: I hope you have, for I would not owe your silence to any other reason. Yours ever.

(168) It was on revisiting it, when returning to England after his unfortunate quarrel with
Walpole, that Gray inscribed his beautiful "Alcaic Ode" in the album of the fathers of this
monastery.  Gray's account of this grand scene, where "not a precipice, not a torrent, not
a cliff, but is pregnant with religion and poetry," will be found in his letter to West, dated
Turin, Nov. 16, N. S. 1739. Works, vol. ii. p. 69.-E.

138 Letter 14 To Richard West, Esq. Turin, Nov. 11, 1739, N. S.

So, as the song says, we are in fair Italy! I wonder we are; for on the very highest precipice
of Mount Cenis, the devil of discord, in the similitude of sour wine, had got amongst our Alpine
savages, and set them a-fighting with Gray and me in the chairs: they rushed him by me on a
crag, where there was scarce room for a cloven foot.  The least slip had tumbled us into such
a fog, and such an eternity, as we should never have found our way out of again.  We were eight
days in coming hither from Lyons; the four last in crossing the Alps.  Such uncouth rocks,
and such uncomely inhabitants!  My dear West, I hope I shall never see them again!  At the
foot of Mount Cenis we were obliged to quit our chaise, which was taken all to pieces and loaded
on mules; and we were carried in low arm-chairs on poles, swathed in beaver bonnets, beaver
gloves, beaver stockings, muffs, and bear-skins.  When we came to the top, behold the snows
fallen! and such quantities, and conducted by such heavy clouds that hung glouting, that I
thought we could never have waded through them. The descent is two leagues, but steep and rough
as O * * * * father's face, over which, you know, the devil walked with hobnails in his shoes.
But the dexterity and nimbleness of the mountaineers are inconceivable: they run with you down
steeps and frozen precipices, where no man, as men are now, could possibly walk. We had twelve
men and nine mules to carry us, our servants, and baggage, and were above five hours in this
agreeable jaunt The day before, I had a cruel accident, and so extraordinary an one, that it
seems to touch upon the traveller.  I had brought with me a little black spaniel of King Charles's
breed; but the prettiest, fattest, dearest creature!  I had let it out of the chaise for the
air, and it was waddling along close to the head of the horses, on the top of the highest Alps,
by the side of a wood of firs. There darted out a young wolf, seized poor dear Tory (172) by
the throat, and, before we could possibly prevent it, sprung up the side of the rock and carried
him off.  The postilion jumped off and struck at him with his whip, but in vain.  I saw it
and screamed, but in vain; for the road was so narrow, that the servants that were behind could
not get by the chaise to shoot him.  What is the extraordinary part is, that it was but two
o'clock, and broad sunshine.  It was shocking to see anything one loved run away with to so
horrid a death.  .... .

Just coming out of Camber, which is a little nasty old hole, I copied an inscription set up
at the end of a great road, which was practised through an immense solid rock by bursting it
asunder with gunpowder.  The Latin is pretty enough, and so I send it you:

"Carolus Emanuel II.  Sab. dux, Pedem. princeps, Cypri
rex,public`a felicitate part`a, singulorum commodis intentus,
breviorem securioremque viam regiam, natur`a occlusam, Romanis
intentatam, mteris desperatam, dejectis scopulorum repagulus,
aquata montiuminiquitate, quae cervicibus imminebant precipitia
pedibus substernens, aeternis populorum commerciis patefecit.
 A.D. 1670."

We passed the Pas de Suze, where is a strong fortress on a rock, between two very neighbouring
mountains; and then, through a fine avenue of three leagues, we at last discovered Tturin:--

"E l'un k l'altro mostra, ed in tanto oblia La noia, e'l mal 'delta passata via."'

'Tis really by far one of the prettiest cities I have seen; not one of your large straggling
ones that can afford to have twenty dirty suburbs, but, clean and compact, very new and very
regular. The king's palace is not of the proudest without, but of the richest within; painted,
gilt, looking-glassed, very costly, but very tawdry; in short, a very popular palace.  We were
last night at the Italian comedy-the devil of a house and the devil of actors! Besides this,
there is a sort of an heroic tragedy, called "La rapprentatione dell' Anima Damnata."(173)
A woman, a sinner, comes in and makes a solemn prayer to the Trinity: enter Jesus Christ and
the Virgin: he scolds, and exit: she tells the woman her son is very angry, but she don't know,
she will see what she can do.  After the play we were introduced to the assembly, which they
call the conversazione: there were many people playing at ombre, pharaoh, and a game called
taroc, with cards so high, (174) to the number of seventy-eight.  There are three or four English
here Lord Lincoln,(175) with Spence,(176) your professor of poetry; a Mr. B*** and a Mr. C***
a man that never utters a syllable.  We have tried all stratagems to make him speak.  Yesterday
he did at last open his mouth, and said Bec.  all laughed so at the novelty of the thing that
he shut it again, and will never speak more.  I think you can't complain now of my not writing
to you.  What a volume of trifles!  I wrote just the fellow to it from Geneva; had it you?
Farewell! Thine.

(172) This incident is described also by Gray in one of his letters to his mother. "If the
dog," he adds, "had not been there, and the creature had thought fit to lay hold of one of
the horses, chaise and we, and all, must inevitably have tumbled above fifty fathoms perpendicularly
down the precipice."-E.

(173) This representation is also mentioned by Spence, in a letter to his mother:-"In spite
of the excellence," he says, "of the actors, the greatest part of the entertainment to me was
the countenances of the people in the pit and boxes.  When the devils were like to carry off
the Damned Soul, every body was in the utmost consternation and when St. John spoke so obligingly
to her, they were ready to cry out for joy.  When the Virgin appeared on the stage, every body
looked respectful; and, on several words spoke by the actors, they pulled off, their hats,
and crossed themselves.  What can you think of a people, where their very farces are religious,
and where they are so religiously received?  It was from such a play as this (called Adam and
Eve) that Milton when he was in Italy, is said to have taken the first hint for his divine
poem of "Paradise Lost." What small beginnings are there sometimes to the greatest things!-E.

(174) In the manuscript the writing of this word is extraordinary tall.

(175) Henry ninth Earl of Lincoln, who having, in 1744, married Catherine, eldest daughter
and heiress of the Right Honourable Henry Pelham, inherited, in 1768, the dukedom of Newcastle-under-Line
at the demise of the countess's uncle, Thomas Pelham Holles, who, in 1756, had been created
Duke of Newcastle-under-Line, with special remainder to the Earl of Lincoln.-E.

140 Letter 15 To Richard West, Esq. >From Bologna, 1739.

I don't know why I told Ashton I would send you an account of what I saw: don't believe it,
I don't intend it.  Only think what a vile employment 'tis, making catalogues!  And then one
should have that odious Curl (177) get at one's letters, and publish them like Whitfield's
Journal, or for a supplement to the Traveller's Pocket Companion.  Dear West, I protest against
having seen any thing but what all the world has seen; nay, I have not seen half that, not-some
of the most common things; not so much as a miracle. Well, but you don't expect it, do you?
Except pictures.  and statues, we are not very fond of sights; don't go a-staring after crooked
towers and conundrum staircases.  Don't you hate, too, a jingling epitaph (178) of one Procul
and one Proculus that is here?  Now and then we drop in at a procession, or a high-mass, hear
the music, enjoy a strange attire, and hate the foul monkhood.  Last week, was the feast of
the Immaculate Conception.  On the eve we went to the Franciscans' church to hear the academical
exercises.  There were moult and moult clergy, about two dozen dames, that treated one another
with illustrissima and brown kisses, the vice-legate, the gonfalonier, and some senate.  The
vice-legate, whose conception was not quite so immaculate, is a young personable person, of
about twenty, and had on a mighty pretty cardinal-kind of habit; 'twould make a delightful
masquerade dress.  We asked his name: Spinola.  What, a nephew of the cardinal-legate?  Signor,
no: ma credo che gli sia qualche cosa.  He sat on the right hand with the gonfalonier in two
purple fauteuils.  Opposite was a throne of crimson damask, with the device of the Academy,
the Gelati; and trimmings of gold.  Here sat at a table, in black, the head of' the academy,
between the orator and the first poet At two semicircular tables on either hand sat three poets
and three; silent among many candles.  The chief made a little introduction, the orator a long
Italian vile harangue.  Then the chief, the poet, and the poets,-who were a Franciscan, an
Olivetan, an old abb`e, and three lay,-read their compositions; and to-day they are pasted
up in all parts of the town.  As we came out of the church, we found all the convent and neighbouring
houses lighted all over with lanthorns of red and yellow paper, and two bonfires.  But you
are sick of this foolish ceremony; I'll carry you to no more -. I will only mention, that we
found the Dominicans' church here in mourning for the inquisitor: 'twas all hung with black
cloth, furbelowed and festooned with yellow gauze.  We have seen a furniture here in a much
prettier taste; a gallery of Count Caprara's: in the panels between the windows are pendent
trophies of various arms taken by one of his ancestors from the Turks. They are whimsical,
romantic, and have a pretty effect.  I looked about, but could not perceive the portrait of
the lady at whose feet they were indisputably offered. In coming out of Genoa we were more
lucky; found the very spot where Horatio and Lothario were to have fought, "west of the town,
a mile among the rocks."

My dear West, in return for your epigrams of Prior, I will transcribe some old verses too,
but which I fancy I can show you in a sort of a new light.  They are no newer than Virgil,
and what is more odd, are in the second Georgic.  'Tis, that I have observed that he not only
excels when he is like himself, but even when he is very like inferior poets: you will say
that they rather excel by being like him: but mind, they are all near one another:

"Si non ingenter oribus domus alta superbis Mane sa@atame totis vomit Eedibus uridam:"

And the four next lines; are they not just like Martial? In the following he is as much Claudian"

"Illum non populi fasces, non purpura regum Flexit, et infidos agitans discordia fratres; Aut
conjurato descendens Dacus ab Istro."

Then who are these like?

"nec ferrea jura, insanumque forum, aut populi tabularia vidit. Sollicitant alii remis freta
ceca, ruuntque In ferrum, penetrant aulas et limina regum. Hic petit excidiis urbem miseresque
Penates, Ut gemma, bibat, et Sarrano indormiat ostro."

Don't they seem to be Juvenal's?-There are some more, which to me resemble, Horace; but perhaps
I think so from his having some on a parallel subject.  Tell me if I am mistaken; these are they:

"Interea dulces pendent eircum oscula nati: Casta pudicitiam servat domus-"

inclusively to the end of these:

"Hanc olim veteres vitam colti`ere Sabini Hanc Remus et frater: sic fortis Etruria crevit,
Scilicet et retum facta est pulcherrima Roma."

If the imagination is whimsical; well at least, 'tis like me to have imagined it.  Adieu, child!
We leave Bologna to-morrow.  You know 'tis the third city in Italy for pictures: knowing that,
you know all.  We shall be three days crossing the Apennine to Florence: would it were over!

My dear West, I am yours from St. Peter's to St. Paul's!

falling into Curll's hands, they were by him  printed and sold.  As the volume contained some
letters from noblemen,  Pope incited a prosecution against him in the House of Lords for breach

been infringed: Curll went away triumphant, and Pope was left to seek some other remedy.-E.

142 Letter 16 To Richard West, Esq. Florence, Jan. 24, 1740, N. S.

Dear West, I don't know what volumes I may send you from Rome; from Florence I have little
inclination to send you any.  I see several things that please me calmly, but `a force d'en
avoir vu I have left off screaming Lord! this! and Lord! that!  To speak sincerely, Calais
surprised me more than any thing I have seen since.  I recollect the joy I used to propose
if I could but once see the great duke's gallery; I walk into it now with as little emotion
as I should into St. Paul's.  The statues are a congregation of good sort of people, that I
have a great deal of unruffled regard for.  The farther I travel the less I wonder at any thing:
a few days reconcile one to a new spot, or an unseen custom; and men are so much the same every
where, that one scarce perceives any change of situation.  The same weaknesses, the same passions
that in England plunge men into elections, drinking, whoring, exist here, and show themselves
in the shapes of Jesuits, Cicisbeos, and Corydon ardebat Alexins.  The most remarkable thing
I have observed since I came abroad, is, that there are no people so obviously mad as the English.
The French, the Italians, have great follies, great faults; but then they are so national,
they cease to be striking.  In England, tempers vary so excessively, that almost every one's
faults are peculiar to himself.  I take this diversity to proceed partly from our climate,
partly from our government: the first is changeable, and makes us queer; the latter permits
our queernesses to operate as they please.  If one could avoid contracting this queerness,
it must certainly be the most entertaining to live in England, where such a variety of incidents
continually amuse.  The incidents of a week in London would furnish all Italy with news for
a twelvemonth.  The only two circumstances of moment in the life of an Italian, that ever give
occasion to their being mentioned, are, being married, and in a year after taking a cicisbeo.
Ask the name, the husband, the wife, or the cicisbeo, of any person, et voila qui est fini.
Thus, child, 'tis dull dealing here! Methinks your Spanish war is little more livel By the
gravity of the proceedings, one would think both nations were Spaniard.  Adieu! Do you remember
my maxim, that you used to laugh at? Every body does every thing, and nothing comes on't. 
I am more convinced of it now than ever.  I don't know whether S***w,'s was not still better,
Well, gad, there is nothing in nothing.  You see how I distil all my speculations and improvements,
that they may lie in a small compass.  Do you remember the story of the prince, that, after
travelling three years, brought home nothing but a nut? They cracked it: in it was wrapped
up a piece of silk, painted with all the kings, queens, kingdoms. and every thing in the world:
after many unfoldings, out stepped a little dog, shook his ears, and fell to dancing a saraband.
There is a fairy tale for you.  If I had any thing as good as your old song, I would send it
too; but I can only thank you for it, and bid you good night. Yours ever.

P. S. Upon reading my letter, I perceive still plainer the sameness that reigns here; for I
find I have said the same thing ten times over.  I don't care, I have made out a letter, and
that was all my affair.

145 Letter 18 To The Hon. Henry Seymour Conway, (181) Florence, March 6, 1740, N. S.

Harry, my dear, one would tell you what a monster you are, if one were not sure your conscience
tells you so every time you think of me.  At Genoa, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven
hundred and thirty-nine, I received the last letter from you; by your not writing to me since,
I imagine you propose to make this a leap year.  I should have sent many a scold after you
in this long interval, had I known where to have scolded; but you told me you should leave
Geneva immediately.  I have despatched sundry inquiries into England after you, all fruitless.
At last drops in a chance letter to Lady Sophy Farmor, (182) from a girl at Paris, that tells
her for news, Mr. Henry Conway is here.  Is he, indeed? and why was I to know it only by this
scrambling way? Well, I hate you for this neglect, but I find I love you well enough to tell
you so.  But, dear now, don't let one fall into a train of excuses and reproaches; if the god
of indolence is a mightier deity with you than the god of caring for one, tell me, and I won't
dun you; but will drop your correspondence as silently as if I owed you money.

If my private consistency was of no weight with you, yet, is a man nothing who is within three
days' journey of a conclave? Nay, for what you knew, I might have been in Rome.  Harry, art
thou so indifferent, as to have a cousin at the election of a pope (183) without courting him
for news? I'll tell you, were I any where else, and even Dick Hammond were at Rome, I think
verily I should have wrote to him.  Popes, cardinals, adorations, coronations, St. Peter's!
oh, what costly sounds! and don't you write to one yet?  I shall set out in about a fortnight,
and pray then think me of consequence.

I have crept on upon time from day to day here; fond of Florence to a degree: 'tis infinitely
the most agreeable of all the places I have seen since London: that you know one loves, right
or wrong, as one does one's nurse.  Our little Arno is not bloated and swelling like the Thames,
but 'tis vastly pretty, and, I don't know how, being Italian, has something visionary and poetical
in its stream.  Then one's unwilling to leave the gallery, and-but-in short, one's unwilling
to get into a postchaise.  I am surfeited with mountains and inns, as if I had eat them.  I
have many to pass before I see England again, and no Tory to entertain me on the road?  Well,
this thought makes me dull, and that makes me finish.  Adieu! Yours ever.

P. S. Direct to me, (for to be sure you will not be so outrageous as to leave me quite off),

commences when Mr. Walpole was twenty-three years old, and Mr. Conway two years younger.  They

146 Letter 19 To Richard West, Esq. Siena, March 22, 1740, N. S.

Dear West, Probably now you will hear something of the Conclave: we have left Florence, and
are got hither on the way to a pope.  In three hours' time we have seen all the good contents
of this city: 'tis old, and very snug, with very few inhabitants.  You must not believe Mr.
Addison about the wonderful Gothic nicety of the dome: the materials are richer, but the workmanship
and taste not near so good as in several I have seen.  We saw a college of the Jesuits, where
there are taught to draw above fifty boys: they are disposed in long chambers in the manner
of Eton, but cleaner. N. B. We were not bolstered; (184) so we wished you with us.  Our Cicerone,
who has less classic knowledge, and more superstition than a colleger, upon showing 147 us
the she-wolf, the arms of Siena, told us that Romolus and Remus were nursed by a wolf, per
la volonta di Dio, si pu`o dire; and that one might see by the arms, that the same founders
built Rome and Siena.  Another dab of Romish superstition, not unworthy of Presbyterian divinity,
we met with in a book of drawings: 'twas the Virgin standing on a tripod composed of Adam,
Eve, and the Devil, to express her immaculate conception.

You can't imagine how pretty the country is between this and Florence; millions of little hills
planted with trees, and tipped with villas or convents.  We left unseen the great Duke's villas
and several palaces in Florence, till our return from Rome: the weather has been so cold, how
could one go to them?  In Italy they seem to have found out how hot their climate is, but not
how cold; for there are scarce any chimneys, and most of the apartments painted in fresco so
that one has the additional horror of freezing with imaginary marble.  The men hang little
earthen pans of coals upon their wrists, and the women have portable stoves under their petticoats
to warm their nakedness, and carry silver shovels in their pockets, with which their Cicisbeos
stir them-Hush! by them, I mean their stoves.  I have nothing more to tell you; I'll carry
my letter to Rome and finish it there.

R`e di Coffano, March 23, where lived one of the three kings. The King of Coffano carried presents
of myrrh, gold, and frankincense, I don't know where the devil he found them; for in all his
dominions we have not seen the value of a shrub.  We have the honour of lodging under his roof
to-night.  lord! such a place, such an extent of ugliness! A lone inn upon a black mountain,
by the side of an old fortress!  no curtains or windows, only shutters! no testers to the beds!
no earthly thing to eat but some eggs and a few little fishes! This lovely spot is now known
by the name of Radi-cofani.  Coming down a steep hill with two miserable hackneys, one fell
under the chaise; and while we were disengaging him, a chaise came by with a person in a red
cloak, a white handkerchief on its head, and a black hat: we thought it a fat old woman; but
it spoke in a shrill little pipe, and proved itself to be Senesini. (185) I forgot to tell
you an inscription I copied from the portal of the dome of Siena:

Annus centenus Roma seraper est jubilenus: Crimina laxantur si penitet ista dortantur; Sic
ordinavit Bonifacius et roboravit.

Rome, March 26

We are this instant arrived, tired and hungry! O! the charming city-I believe it is-for I have
not seen a syllable yet, only the Pons Milvius and an obelisk.  The Cassian and Flaminian ways
were terrible disappointments; not one Rome tomb left; their very ruins ruined.  The English
are numberless.  My dear West, I know at Rome you will not have a grain of pity for one; but
indeed 'tis dreadful, dealing with schoolboys just broke loose, or old fools that are come
abroad at forty to see the world, like Sir Wilful Witwould.

I don't know whether you will receive this, or any other I write; but though I shall write
often, you and Ashton must not wonder if none come to you; for though I am harmless in my nature,
my name has some mystery in it.(186)  Good night! I have no more time or paper.  Ashton, child,
I'll write to you next post.  Write us no treasons, be sure!

(184) An Eton phrase.

(185) Francesco Bernardi, better known by the name of Senesino, a celebrated singer, who, having
been engaged for the opera company formed by Handel in 17@20, remained here as principal singer
until 1726, when the state of his health compelled him to return to Italy.  In 1730 he revisited
England, where he remained until about 1734.  He was the contemporary, if not the rival of
Farinelli; and Mr. Hogarth, in his "Memoirs of the Musical Drama," (i. 431,) tells us, that
when Senesino and Farinelli were in England together, they had not for some time the opportunity
of hearing each other, in consequence of their engagements at different theatres.  At last,
however, they were both engaged to sing on the same stage.  Senesino had the part of a furious
tyrant, and Farinelli the part of an unfortunate hero in chains; but, in the course of the
first act, the captive so softened the heart of the tyrant, that Senesino, forgetting his stage
character, ran to Farinelli, and embraced him in his own.-E.

(186) He means the name of Walpole at Rome, where the Pretender and many of his adherents then
resided.

148 letter 20 To                     Richard West, Esq. Rome, April 16th, 1740, N. S.

I'll tell you, West, because one is amongst new things, you think one can always write new
things.  When I first came abroad, every thing struck me, and I wrote its history: but now
I am grown so used to be surprised, that I don't perceive any flutter in myself when I meet
with any novelties; curiosity and astonishment wear off, and the next thing is, to fancy that
other people nnow as much of places as One's Self; or, at least, one does not remember that
they do not.  It appears to me as odd to write to you of St. Peter's, as it would do to you
to write of Westminster Abbey. Besides, as one looks at churches, etc. with a book of travels
in one's hand, and sees every thing particularized there, it would appear transcribing, to
write upon the same subjects.  I know you will hate me for this declaration; I remember how
ill I used to take it when any body served me so that was travelling.  Well, I will tell you
something, if you will love me: You have seen prints of the ruins of the temple of Minerva
Medica; you shall only hear its situation, and then figure what a villa might be laid out there.
'Tis in the middle of a garden: at a little distance are two subterraneous grottos, which were
the burial-places of the liberti of Augustus. There are all the niches and covers of the urns
and the inscriptions remaining; and in one, very considerable remains of an ancient stucco
Ceiling with paintings in grotesque.  Some of the walks would terminate upon the Castellum
Aquae Martioe, St. John Lateran, and St. Maria Maggiore, besides other churches; the walls
of the garden would be two aqueducts. and the entrance through one of the old gates of Rome.
This glorious spot is neglected, and only serves for a small vineyard and kitchen-garden.
