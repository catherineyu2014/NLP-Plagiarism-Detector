Mr. HENRY IRVING proved, by his perfect recital of CLEMENT SCOTT's verses, how thoroughly "by
heart" he had got them. HENRY's "heart is" not "dead" when JOHNNIE is concerned. Sir EDWARD
CLARKE, as we learnt from the speeches made by himself, Mr. IRVING, and Mr. TOOLE, seems to
have been at school with all the leading Actors; and it was a miracle that he escaped the attractions
of the sock and buskin. Pity that the song, "When we were boys, Merry merry boys, When we were
boys together," had not been arranged as a trio for them. JOHNNIE was in his best form; very
detached, casual, and uncommonly funny. Lord ROSEBERY apologised by letter for not being able
to be in Scotland and London at the same time; and the Wicked Abbé BANCROFT in replying to
the toast of the Drama, pathetically represented his hard case of being called upon to make
an after-dinner speech, when he hadn't had any dinner. The Actor's lot is evidently, not always
a happy one. He wanted a "feeding-part" and didn't get it. The dinner was excellent, and the
waiting of the waiters was, as far as I could ascertain, exceptionally good. Certainly the
Métropole, or the New "Holland" House,--as it might be termed, after its manager,--holds first
rank for this sort of business. We present Mr. HOLLAND, the Métropole Caterer, with this suggestion:--

THE INCANTATION SCENE.

Freely Adapted from "Der Freischütz."

                  Caspar, Mr. L-B-CH-RE.
                   Zamiel, Mr. P-RN-LL.

    SCENE--Stage in complete shadow. An Irish Glen surrounded by bare
    mountains covered with dwarf oaks, overhanging a big bog. The Moon
    is shining dimly. CASPAR discovered with a pouch and hanger,
    busily engaged in making a Circle of fairy lanterns, in the middle
    of which is placed a turnip-skull, a shillelagh, a bunch of
    shamrock, a crucible, and a bullet-mould. Distant mutterings
    heard.

    Chorus of Distant Party-Spirits.

  Shindy now would be a boon,
      ("Hear, hear! Hear, hear!")
    Interest in M-tch-llst-wn hath died,
      ("Hear, hear! Hear, hear!")
  Mischief must be stirred up soon.
      ("Hear, hear! Hear, hear!")
    And Obstruction once more tried.
      ("Hear, hear! Hear, hear!")
  Ere this S-ss-n's course is run
  We must really have some fun.
      ("Hear, hear! Hear, hear!")

    [At the end of chorus, a Big Bell booms twelve times; the Circle
    being finished, CASPAR within it, draws his hanger round the
    lanterns, and at the twelfth stroke strikes it into the
    turnip-skull.

  Caspar (kneeling, and raising the skull on the hanger at arm's length).
  ZAMIEL, ZAMIEL, hear me, hear!
  By this bogey-skull appear!
  ZAMIEL, rise, for things look queer!

    [A confused noise is heard, a Meteor (looking rather like a
    long-expected Blue-Book) falls on the Circle, and ZAMIEL,
    looking coldly triumphant, appears.

  Zamiel. Why callest thou?

  Caspar.     Well, hang it! I like that!
  But, by St. Patrick's beard, your advent's pat,
  Our foes boast three years longer they may live.

  Zamiel. No!

  Caspar. Then good reason you and I must give.

  Zamiel. Who says so?

  Caspar. One who hardly dared--till now--
  To face thy really rayther freezing brow;
  But, moved by reason, and a late Report,
  He's on the job; and we shall have some sport.

  Zamiel. What doth he seek?

  Caspar.                   To be supplied
  With bullets which thy skill shall guide.

  Zamiel. Six shall obey,
  The seventh--who'll say?

  Caspar. Lord of the mystic League,
  I hope, by sly intrigue,
  To rule the seventh also,
  And let it kill--you know!

  Zamiel. Too risky.

  Caspar.            Oh, I say,
  Let's have no more delay.
  Three long years yet to sway?
  Pooh, ZAMIEL! It's child's-play.

  Zamiel. Enough--no more! I'll tell thee now
  By this day month there'll be--a row?

    [More mutterings are heard and repeated in chorus. The skull and
    hanger sink, and in their place a hearth with lighted coals and
    faggots, rise out of the earth, within the Circle. The Moon
    becomes red.

  Caspar. Well served! Bless thee, ZAMIEL!
  The day will be ours!

    [CASPAR moves to and fro, places faggots on the coals, blows the
    fire, which blazes and fumes. In the smoke certain cabalistic
    letters appear.

Now for it! Every moment is precious. "Every bullet hath its billet," saith the old saw. Rather!
Black C-C-L, beware! Bland WILLIAM H., look out! Brutal B-LF-R, mind your eye! Shrewish G-SCH-N,
be warned! Haughty H-RT-NGT-N, take care! Perfidious J-S-PH, watch it! That accounts for Six
out of the fatal Seven. 'Twill suffice, even if the seventh--bah! that's silly superstition.
Here goes! First this lead--heavy as SM-TH's speeches; then this glass, brittle as the bond
between the Unionists; some quicksilver of Randolphian shiftiness; three charmed balls which
have already hit their mark. See, they are marked. "P-G-TT," "P-RN-LL," "C-mm-ss-n"!!! Probatum
est! Now for the blessing of the balls.

    [CASPAR bowing down his head three separate times (as to three
    Judges) before he commences his incantation.

  Thou who hast Fate's mystic dower,
  ZAMIEL, ZAMIEL, work thy power!
  Spirit of the evil dead
  (At Madrid), bless, bless the lead!
  May they be as featly sped
  As the one that pierced his head.
  I am sick of shilly-shally,
  May they--metaphorically,
  For, of course, I don't mean murder,
  Nothing could be--well, absurder--
  May they spifflicate our foes.
  Neither progress nor repose,
  On Bench or in Cabinet,
  May they any of them get
  Till they get their last quietus
  From these bullets (That will seat us
  Comfortably in their places,
  To the rapture of three races)
  How the fire fumes! There'll be ruction.
  Characters look like OBSTRUCTION!
  But they mean--and that's their beauty!--
  Merely, simply, purely DUTY!
  Therefore, 'tis my occupation
  So at present, Incantation!
  G. O. M. won't take a part;
  He objects to the Black Art.
  Though he rather shirks my cult,
  He will relish the result.
  ZAMIEL! you're the chap I like,
  Charm the bullets that they strike.
  ZAMIEL, lend thy might to kill
  To each burning drop we spill!
  Now then for it! Out on fear!
  ZAMIEL, ZAMIEL, be thou near!

    [Sets to work at--THE CASTING OF THE BULLETS. Music.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

Leaves of a Life. So MONTAGU WILLIAMS, Q.C., and Worthy Beak, styles his Reminiscences. The
Leaves are fresh, and will be Evergreen. Nothing in his Life has become him so well as his
leave-ing it. I fancy that the most popular part of it will be the early days--his salad days--when
his leaves were at their greenest. Certainly, to all old Etonians, the opening of Volume One
must prove the most interesting part of the two books; and after this, in point of interest
to the general reader, will rank all the stories about persons whose names, for evident reasons,
the learned Reminiscenser cannot give in full. When you read about what enormities "C----"
committed, and what an unmitigated scoundrel "D----'s" brother was, there is in the narrative
a delightful element of mystery, and an inducement to guess, which will excite in many a strong
desire for a private key, which, of course, could not be placed in any publisher's hands, except
under such conditions as hamper the trustee of the Talleyrand Memoirs.

Mr. WILLIAMS has better stories of Sergeant BALLANTINE than the latter had of himself in his
own book. But I should like more of the MONTAGU out of Court--more of the behind-the-scenes
of the cases in which he was engaged or interested. All his book is written in a dashing style,
and there would be an enormous demand for a third volume, which might be all dash--C---- D----
E----; every letter of the alphabet dash--a dash'd good book, in fact, giving us the toothsome
fond d'artichaut after the "leaves" have been disposed of. But that this should be the strong
feeling expressed not alone by the Baron DE B.-W., but by very many readers, is proof sufficient
of the art with which these Reminiscences have been compiled, so as, according to Sam Weller's
prescription for a love-letter, to make us "wish there was more of it." By the way, I doubt
whether WHATELEY'S Evidences of Christianity was the work that MONTAGU WILLIAMS was dozing
over during "Sunday Private" in pupil-room; doesn't he mean PALEY's Evidences? Also, wasn't
the old College Fellow's name spelt PLUMTRE, or PLUMPTRE, not PLUMPTREE? However, the Baron
is less likely to be right than the Magistrate, who is evidently blessed with a wonderfully
retentive memory.

My faithful Co. reports that he has read On the Children, a not very interesting novel, by
ANNIE THOMAS, otherwise Mrs. PENDER CUDLIP. The story deals with a young girl, who, after serving
in a village newspaper shop, marries the local nobleman, and no doubt lives happily ever afterwards.
Persons who are interested in the doings of the class JEAMES calls the "hupper suckles," will
perhaps be a little disappointed, as, truth to tell, the narrative is rather homely. Many of
the characters seem to have that exaggerated awe of rank which used to be characteristic of
the tales in the London Journal. The book should, however, be welcome in the homes of some
of the lower middle class.

MR. PARKER SMITH, the recently elected M.P., appeared in the House looking Partickularly happy.

They were locked up in a room adjoining OLD MORALITY'S private apartment, at back of SPEAKER's
chair. Both dressed in warlike costumes, both uniforms new, unaccustomed, and uncomfortable.
Both warriors had waked in the morning full of joy and proud anticipation. "If you're waking
call me early," Quartermaster-General Lord BROOKE had said to his man; "this is the happiest
day of all the bright new year; for I'm to Second the Address. Yes, I'm to Second the Address."
