It was a curious theory, and I will not be responsible for its truth. But there is no doubt
that in every German town artistic and literary society has its centre amongst the educated
Jews. They are most generous hosts, and it is their pleasure to gather round them an aristocracy
of genius. The aristocracy that is perfectly happy without genius would as a rule not enter
a Jew's house; though the poorer members of the aristocracy often marry a Jew's daughter. Where
there is inter-marriage some social intercourse is presumably inevitable. But the social crusade
against Jews is carried on in Germany to an extent we do not dream of here. The Christian clubs
and hostels exclude them, Christian families avoid them, and Christian insults are offered
to them from the day of their birth. "What do you use those long lances for?" said the wife
of a Jewish professor to a young man in a cavalry regiment. "Damit hetzen wir die Juden," said
he, with the snarl of his kind; and he knew very well that the lady's husband was a Jew. I
have been told a story of a Jewish girl being asked to a Court ball by the Emperor Frederick,
and finding that none of the men present would consent to dance with her. I have heard of girls
who wished to ask a Jewish schoolmate to a dance, and discovered that their Christian friends
flatly refused to meet anyone of her race. How any Christians contrive to avoid it I do not
understand, for wherever you go in Germany some of the great scholars, doctors, men of science,
art, and literature, are men of Jewish blood. The press is almost entirely in their hands,
and when there is a scurrilous artist or a coarse picture your friends explain it by saying
that the tone of that special paper is jüdisch. The modern campaign against Jews began nearly
thirty years ago, when a Court chaplain called Stöcker startled the world by the violence of
his invective. But the fire he stirred to flame must have been smouldering. He and his followers
gave the most ingenuous reasons for curtailing Jewish rights and privileges in Germany, one
of which was the provoking fact that Jewish boys did more brilliantly at school than Christians.
The subject bristles with difficulties, and no one who knows the German Jew intimately will
wish to pose him as a persecuted saint. The Christian certainly makes it unpleasant for him
socially, but in one way or the other he holds his own. I have seen him vexed and offended
by some brutal slight, but his keen sense of humour helps him over most stiles. So no doubt
does his sense of power. "They will not admit me to their clubs or ask my daughters to their
dances," said a Jewish friend, "but they come to me for money for their charities." And I knew
that half the starving poor in the town came to his wife for charity, and that she never sent
one empty away.

When a very clever, sensitive, numerically small race has lived for hundreds of years cheek
by jowl with a dense brutal race that has never ceased to insult and humiliate it, you cannot
be surprised if those clever but highly sensitive ones become imbued in course of time with
a painful undesirable conviction that the brutes are their superiors. So you have the spectacle
in Germany of Jews seeking Christian society instead of avoiding it; and you hear them boast
quite artlessly of their christlicher Umgang. They would really serve their people and even
themselves more if they refused all christlicher Umgang until the Christians had learned to
behave themselves. An Englishwoman living in Berlin told me that once as she came out of a
concert hall an officer standing in the crowd stared at her and said, so that everyone could
hear: "At last! a single face that is not a jüdischer Fratz." The concert, you will understand,
must have been a good one, and therefore largely attended by a Jewish audience. Possibly the
officer who so much disliked his surroundings had married a Jewish heiress and was waiting
for his wife. Such things happen. During the worst times of Stöcker's campaign a woman with
Jewish features could hardly go out unescorted; and even now, though it is not openly expressed,
you can hardly fail to catch some note of sympathy with the Russian persecution of the Jews.
The deep helpless genuine horror felt in England at the pogroms is felt in a fainter way in
Northern Germany.

Meanwhile the Jewish woman of the upper classes takes her revenge by knowing how to dress.
In German cities, when you see a woman who is "exquisite," slim that is and graceful, dainty
from head to foot and finely clad, then you may vow by all the gods that she has Jewish blood
in her.

  THE FREE SHOOTER

    The bridal wreath for thee we bind,
      With silken thread of azure;
    In wedded days, oh, mayst thou find

    I've planted thyme and myrtle sweet,
      They grew in my garden;
    But when shall I my true love meet,
      How long will he delay yet?

    Full seven years the maiden span,
      The snow-white web augmenting;
    The veil is clear like a web,
      And green the wreath in her hair.

    When lo! her true love came at last,
      When seven years had passed,
    Because her lover married her
      She has deserved her wreath.

    Early a woman should learn to serve, for that is her calling;
    Since through service alone she finally comes to governing,
    Comes to the due command that is hers of right in the household.
    Early the sister must wait on her brother, and wait on her parents;
    Life must be always with her a perpetual coming and going,
    Or be a lifting and carrying, making and doing for others.
    Happy for her be she accustomed to think no way is too grievous,
    And if the hours of the night be to her as the hours of the daytime;
    If she find never a needle too fine, nor a labour too trifling;
    Wholly forgetful of self, and caring to live but in others!

  Page 117, l. 31. "Par une recontre," etc.: "By a strange
    chance," says Monsieur Taine, "women are more feminine and men
    more masculine here than elsewhere. The two natures go to
    extremes, the one to boldness, to a spirit of enterprise and
    opposition, to a character that is warlike, imperious, and
    rough; the other to gentleness, self-denial, patience,
    inexhaustible affection. Here woman yields completely, a thing
    unknown in foreign lands, especially in France, and looks upon
    obedience, pardon, adoration as an honour and a duty, without
    desiring or striving for anything beyond subordinating herself
    and becoming daily more absorbed in him whom she has chosen of
    her own accord and for all time. It is this instinct, an old
    Germanic instinct, that those great delineators of instinct all
    paint in a high light!... The spirit of this race is at once
    primitive and serious. Among women simplicity lasts longer than
    it does elsewhere. They are slower in losing respect, and in
    weighing values and characters; they are less ready to suspect
    evil and to analyse their husbands.... They have not the
    cleverness, the advanced ideas, the assured behaviour, the
    precocity which with us turns a young girl into a sophisticated
    woman and a queen of society in six months. A secluded life and
    obedience are easier for them. More yielding and more sedentary,
    they are at once more reserved, more self-centred, more disposed
    to gaze upon the noble dream that they call duty."

  Page 118, l. 28. "Voir la peinture," etc.: "Depiction of this
    character is to be seen in all English and German literature,"
    he says in a footnote. "The closest of observers, Stendhal,
    thoroughly impregnated with Italian and French ideas and
    customs, is amazed at sight of it. He understands nothing of
    this kind of devotion, 'of this slavery which English husbands
    have had the cleverness to impose upon their wives under the
    name of duty.' These are 'customs of the seraglio.'"
