PLAIN SERMONS. addressed to Country Congregations.

By the same Author, fcap. 8vo., 7s. 6d.

PLAIN SERMONS. Second Series. Second Edition.

     "Plain, short, and affectionate discourse."--English Review.

     "We say willingly of these Sermons, what we can seldom say of
     sermons published at the request of parishioners, that they justify
     the respect paid to them; and appear to us in somewhat the same
     light as we should suppose they seemed to those who listened to and
     admired them.

     "When the first edition of theses Sermons appeared, we noticed them
     as a series of plain and practical, but close and scholarly
     discourses. The appearance of a second edition, in a short time,
     justifies our recommendation."--Spectator.

     "In the effective simplicity with which Mr. Gatty applies the
     incidents and precepts of the Gospel to the every-day concerns of
     life he has no superior."--Britannia.

8vo., price 7s. 6d. THE UNITY OF GOD'S MORAL LAW, AS REVEALED IN THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT.

     "We can recommend it not only as an answer to charges and
     insinuations, but also as an able and clear exposition of the
     meeting point of the Jewish and Christian dispensations; a distinct
     and lucid delineation, amidst apparent divergencies, of the
     coincidences of the animating principles of the law and the
     gospel."--Christian Observer.

8vo., cloth, 8s. THE SEVEN AGES OF THE CHURCH; or, THE SEVEN APOCALYPTIC EPISTLES INTERPRETED
BY CHURCH HISTORY. By the Rev. HENRY COTTERILL, M.A., Vice-President; and Theological Tutor
of Brighton College, and late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

     "Clearly and thoughtfully written."--English Review.

SERMONS for SCHOOLS and FAMILIES.

     "This volume of sermons is of a different stamp from the generality
     of those which come under our notice. There is a vigour of thought
     and language throughout, without the slightest extravagance or
     exaggeration. There is no far-fetched strain of reasoning, nor any
     attempt at fine writing in these discourses; but the mind of the
     reader is directed, by a well-managed series of divisions, to the
     principal doctrines and duties derivable from the passages under
     consideration. These sermons will afford to the young clergyman
     excellent examples of the kind of composition which is calculated
     to render his pulpit-ministration effectual."--English Review.
