The same prefix or its equivalent occurs in the name of a lake in Maine, near the source of
the Alligash branch of St. John's River. Mr. Greenleaf, in a list of Indian names made in 1823,[83]
gave this as "BAAM´CHEnun´gamo or AhP´MOOJEE`negmook." Thoreau[84] was informed by his Penobscot
guide, that the name "means 'Lake that is crossed;' because the usual course lies across, not
along it." There is another "Cross Lake," in Aroostook county, near the head of Fish River.
We seem to recognize, and with less difficulty, the same prefix in Pemigewasset, but the full
composition of that name is not clear.

PEMI- denotes, not a crossing of but deviation from a straight line, whether vertical or horizontal.
In place-names it may generally be translated by 'sloping' or 'aslant;' sometimes by 'awry'
or 'tortuous.' Pemadené, which Râle gives as the Abnaki word for 'mountain,' denotes a sloping
mountain-side (pemi-adené), in distinction from one that is steep or precipitous. 'Pemetiq,'
the Indian name of Mount Desert Island, as written by Father Biard in 1611, is the Abnaki peme'teki,
'sloping land.' Pemaquid appears to be another form of the word which Râle wrote 'Pemaa[n]kke,'
meaning (with the locative suffix) 'at the place where the land slopes;' where "le terre penche;
est en talus."[85] Pymatuning, in Pennsylvania, is explained by Heckewelder, as "the dwelling
place of the man with the crooked mouth; Pihmtónink" (from pimeu and 't[oo]n).

[Footnote 85: Abnaki Dictionary, s.v. PENCHER. Compare, p. 545, "bimk[oo]é, il penche naturellement
la tête sur un côte."]

WANASHQUE, ANASQUI, 'at the extremity of,' 'at the end;' Abn. [oo]anask[oo]i[oo]i, 'au bout;'
Cree, wánnusk[oo]tch; Chip. ishkuè, eshqua. See (pp. 18, 19,) Wanashqu-ompsk-ut, Wonnesquam,[86]
Winnesquamsaukit, Squamscot. Wonasquatucket, a small river which divides North Providence and
Johnston, R.I., retains the name which belonged to the point at which it enters an arm of Narragansett
Bay (or Providence River), 'at the end of the tidal-river.' A stream in Rochester, Mass., which
empties into the head of an inlet from Buzzard's Bay, received the same name. Ishquagoma, on
the upper Embarras River, Minnesota, is the 'end lake,' the extreme point to which canoes go
up that stream.

[Footnote 86: Wonnesquam (as should have been mentioned on the page referred to) may possibly
represent the Abnaki [oo]anask[oo]a[n]a[n]mi[oo]i or -mek 'at the end of the peninsula' ('au
bout de la presqu'ile.' Râle).]

Names of fishes supply the adjectival components of many place-names on the sea-coast of New
England, on the lakes, and along river-courses. The difficulty of analyzing such names is the
greater because the same species of fish was known by different names to different tribes.
The more common substantivals are -amaug, 'fishing place; -tuk or sipu, 'river;' ohke, 'place;'
Abn. -ka[n]tti, 'place of abundance;' and -keag, -keke, Abn. -khigé, which appears to denote
a peculiar mode of fishing,--perhaps, by a weir;[87] possibly, a spearing-place.

[Footnote 87: Schoolcraft derives the name of the Namakagun fork of the St. Croix river, Wisc.,
from Chip. "namai, sturgeon, and kagun, a yoke or weir."]

From the generic namaus (namohs, El.; Abn. namés; Del. namees;) 'a fish'--but probably, one
of the smaller sort, for the form is a diminutive,--come such names as Nameoke or Nameaug (New
London), for namau-ohke, 'fish country;' Namasket or Namasseket (on Taunton River, in Middleborough,
Mass.) 'at the fish place,' a favorite resort of the Indians of that region; Namaskeak, now
Amoskeag, on the Merrimack, and Nam'skeket or Skeekeet, in Wellfleet, Mass.

M'squammaug (Abn. mesk[oo]amék[oo]), 'red fish,' i.e. salmon, gave names to several localities.
Misquamacuck or Squamicut, now Westerly, R.I., was 'a salmon place' of the Narragansetts. The
initial m often disappears; and sometimes, so much of the rest of the name goes with it, that
we can only guess at the original synthesis. 'Gonic,' a post office and railroad station, near
Dover, N.H., on the Cocheco river, was once 'Squammagonic,'--and probably, a salmon-fishing place.

Kaúposh (Abn. kabassé, plu. kabassak), 'sturgeon,' is a component of the name Cobbosseecontee,
in Maine (page 26, ante), 'where sturgeons are plenty;' and Cobscook, an arm of Passamaquoddy
Bay, Pembroke, Me., perhaps stands for kabassakhigé, 'sturgeon-catching place.'

Aumsuog or Ommissuog (Abn. a[n]ms[oo]ak), 'small fish,'--especially alewives and herrings,--is
a component of the name of the Abnaki village on the Kennebec, A[n]mes[oo]k-ka[n]tti; of Mattammiscontis,
a tributary of the Kennebec (see p. 25, ante), and probably, of Amoscoggin and Amoskeag.

Qunnôsu (pl. -suog; Abn. k[oo]n[oo]sé; Old Alg. kino[n]jé; Chip. keno´zha;) is found in the
name of Kenosha, a town and county in Wisconsin; perhaps, in Kenjua or Kenzua creek and township,
in Warren county, Pa. Quinshepaug or Quonshapauge, in Mendon, Mass., seems to denote a 'pickerel
pond' (qunnosu-paug). Maskinongé, i.e. massa-kino[n]jé, 'great pike' or maskelunge, names a
river and lake in Canada.

Pescatum, said to mean 'pollock,' occurs as an adjectival in Peskadamioukka[n]tti, the modern
Passamaquoddy (p. 26).

Naha[n]m[oo], the Abnaki name of the 'eel,' is found in "Nehumkeag, the English of which is
Eel Land, ... a stream or brook that empties itself into Kennebec River," not far from Cobbissecontee.[88]
This brook was sometimes called by the English, Nehumkee. The Indian name of Salem, Mass.,
was Nehumkeke or Naümkeag, and a place on the Merrimac, near the mouth of Concord River (now
in Lowell, I believe,) had the same name,--written, Naamkeak.
