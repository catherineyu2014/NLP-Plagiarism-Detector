Miscellaneous stone artifacts.--There are few stone artifacts besides the pipes. Among these
is a worked piece of pumice (139613), 8 cm. by 4 cm., which has a bowl-like concavity ground
through from one side to the other (pl. 12, c). There are two fragments of gypsum which have
been roughly chipped along one or more edges (139568, pl. 13, f; 139569).

BONE

Bone awls or "daggers."--Two bone awls or "daggers" of identical type are included in the collection
(139589, a and b; pl. 12, a, b). Both specimens are made of the sawed and ground metapodials
of some large mammal, presumably deer. The shorter of the two (139589a) retains vestiges of
a black adhesive for half the length of its convex surface. This is probably the result of
hafting. Nothing precisely comparable to these specimens has been reported so far in the archaeology
of the peninsula; however, similar artifacts do occur in near-by regions. They have been reported
from southern California (Gifford, 1940, p. 161), from Basketmaker sites in Arizona (Kidder
and Guernsey, 1919, p. 128), and from Ventana Cave, where they are concentrated in Level 4
(Haury, 1950, fig. 86J, p. 376, table 30).

Other bone artifacts comprise two parts to flakers (139556, 139557), for which see "Wooden
Artifacts."

SHELL

A number of shell ornaments and a piece of coral were recovered from the cave. At the same
time unworked specimens were found and collected both from the cave and from the midden which
occupies the bay shore just east of the cave.

Abalone ornaments.--Three abalone shell ornaments (139551-139553), identified as Haliotis splendens,
were found. Two are complete, one (139553) is fragmental. They all appear to be examples of
a single type. They are oval to circular, with the following dimensions: 139551 (pl. 13, c)
is 4.8 cm. in diameter; 139552 (pl. 13, a) is 5.3 by 4.3 cm.; and 139553 (pl. 13, b) appears
to have been 3.9 cm. in diameter. Thickness varies between 2 and 3 mm. In manufacture the original
external surface of the shell has been ground and polished to a nacreous surface. In decoration
of the two complete specimens there is a central conically drilled hole from which short incisions
radiate, and an additional hole is drilled on one edge, probably for stringing. The fragmental
specimen (139553) has these holes, but in addition has three other holes drilled near the original
central hole. The original description of the artifacts suggests that these holes may have
been intended as repairs (Annual Report, 1888, p. 129). All three shell specimens are edge-incised,
and two have punctate designs.

Until the present, few shell ornaments have been noted in the archaeology of Baja California.
No specimens identical to those from Bahía de Los Angeles are known; however, all of the decorative
elements and techniques recorded here can be duplicated among specimens of oyster (Pinctada
mazatlanica) shell ornaments from the Cape Region far to the south (Massey, MS 1). Since abalone
do not occur in the Gulf of California, these shells must have been obtained by the Bahía de
Los Angeles people from the Pacific Coast, either directly or in trade. Specific mention of
the use of abalone among the historic Indians of the peninsula is rare in the documents; however,
contemporary Kiliwa women use pieces of the shell for ornamentation (Meigs, 1939, p. 35).

Abalone shell was commonly used by peoples of adjacent California. Both the shell and, probably,
the ornaments themselves were widely traded into the Southwest. Ornaments very similar to the
Bahía de Los Angeles specimens have been found in Basketmaker caves in Arizona (Guernsey and
Kidder, 1921, p. 49).

Olivella shell.--Four broken strings of Olivella shell beads (O. biplicata) (139546) were found
with the burials. Two types are represented. There are three short strands, totaling 17 beads,
in which only the spires have been ground from the shells for stringing (pl. 13, e). The fourth
strand held 9 Olivella shells, somewhat larger than the others, from which both the spires
and bases had been ground (pl. 13, d).

In addition to the strings of beads, Olivella shell is recorded in use with two other specimens
in the collection. Fragments of shells are found as inlay on a wooden artifact (139565); for
a description see the section on "Wooden Artifacts." They are also found tied in with bundles
of human hair in a garment (139539).

The use of Olivella shells, with spires, bases, or both removed by grinding in order to make
beads, is known throughout Baja California archaeologically. Similar occurrences are even more
frequent in the archaeology of southern and central California (Gifford, 1947, p. 11). Olivella
shells inlaid in asphaltum have been found in southern California (ibid., p. 36). The inlaid
fragments of the shell from Bahía de Los Angeles duplicate this type of decoration.

Coral.--There is a piece of coral (139566) which may have been purposefully smoothed into an
elongate object, 10.5 cm. in length.

Unworked shell.--Dr. Palmer collected sample specimens of unworked shell from the open midden
on the bay to the east of the burial site, as well as unworked shell in association with the
burials in the cave (Annual Report, 1888, p. 129). These are listed below:

MIDDEN POTSHERDS

In addition to the unworked shells there are body and rim sherds from at least two pottery
vessels which came from a shell midden on the bay.

There is a single rim sherd (139614a) which comes from a shallow bowl with a direct flat-topped
rim. Color of both the interior and exterior surfaces is buff. The paste is fairly coarse,
with a granitic sand temper which has also some pumice inclusions. There is also evidence of
vegetable-fiber inclusions. There is no mica in the paste. The fragment is 5 mm. thick.

The second fragment (139614b) is a large rim and body sherd from a large bowl which would have
been 27 cm. in diameter and 17 cm. high. The rim is direct, with a grooved lip (pl. 18, a,
b). The surface color is black to dark gray. The paste is coarse, with sand and quartz inclusions,
some of which are as large as 5 mm. in diameter. No mica is present. The surface is scarred
by burned-away vegetable inclusions. The specimen is about 9 mm. thick.

This pottery could have been native-made pottery from the Mission period, or it could have
been derived from pottery-making Indians to the north. Neither source has been adequately studied
on the peninsula. Comparable pieces have been seen, however, from mission ruins in central
and northern Baja California.

WOOD

Flakers.--Two compound flakers, made by securing pieces of ground bone to short wooden shafts,
were found in the collection. In one specimen (139556) the entire flaker measures 12 cm., and
the projecting bone 3.4 cm. (pl. 14, b). The other specimen (139557) is 13.1 cm. long, with
a bone piece 5.6 cm. long (pl. 14, c). In both specimens the ground pieces of bone were laid
in grooves in the round wooden shafts, and secured to them with 2-ply Z-twist cordage (see
"Haftings" for details). Both of the wood shafts are incised with lines encircling the handle
area. These lines may have been decorative, or they may have been intended to supply friction
to the grasp.

Flakers of bone have been reported for the northern part of Baja California (Sales, 1794, I:49)
and must have been known to all peoples on the peninsula despite the absence of direct evidence
in the archaeology and most of the historical sources. They were known throughout adjacent
regions, although usually in the form of simple antler tines. Specimens identical to those
from Bahía de Los Angeles, except for the use of sinew lashing in place of the cordage, have
been reported from Basketmaker caves in Arizona (Guernsey and Kidder, 1921, p. 96; fig. 15c).

Cane whistles.--Two cane, or carrizo, whistles were found in the cave. They are identical in
form and mode of construction, but they differ in decorative details. In both the whistle hole
is cut into the cane at a node, and is reinforced with a black adhesive, possibly asphaltum.

Around the whistle hole of the longer of the two specimens (139588a; pl. 15, h) are five pits
which have been burned in; two are at one end of the hole, three at the other. As added decoration
a series of incisions encircles the shaft of the whistle, some of which, at the mouth end,
are joined by pairs of cut lines. All of these incisions are blackened, either by carbon or
through handling.

The shorter whistle (139588b; pl. 15, g) has no burned pits at the hole, but the encircling
incisions, minus the connecting lines, are present. At the end of the whistle opposite the
mouth is the remnant of a hole in which there is a fragment of knotted cordage.

No other whistles have been recorded for the archaeology of the peninsula. Spanish documentary
sources are unrefined in the differentiation of flutes and whistles; either or both were known
to the historic tribes of Baja California. Use was restricted to ceremonial occasions in all
recorded instances.

Directly to the north of Bahía de Los Angeles, in the 18th century, shamans used whistles in
ceremonies performed several days after a death (Sales, 1794, I:79), just as the modern Kiliwa
use a reed flute at the ñiwey ceremony (Meigs, 1939, p. 45). In neighboring southern California,
the use of flutes was nearly universal, while whistles were used infrequently (Drucker, 1937,
p. 25).

Bull-roarer (?).--One highly polished wooden artifact (139565) may have been used as a bull-roarer.
This artifact, with a length of 23.5 cm., a diameter of 5.1 cm., and a thickness of 6 mm. (pl.
15, i), is made of a very hard dark wood--probably ironwood, Olneva tesota. It is concave on
both faces. At each end, and at a right angle to the main axis of the specimen, is a groove
filled with a hardened black substance inlaid with fragments of Olivella shell (O. biplicata).
The hole at one end is biconically drilled. This artifact has been tentatively called a "bull-roarer"
because no other purpose can be conjectured. It is too large for a net-gauge, which it somewhat
resembles because of its concave ends.

There is no mention of bull-roarers in the Spanish sources for the peninsula; however, one
archaeological specimen has been recovered from the surface of a cave in the San Julio Basin,
to the east of Comondú. This wooden bull-roarer has a conventional shape; it is a long oval-shaped
piece of hardwood which is double-convex or lenticular in cross section and has a length of
21.5 cm.[2]

 [2] This specimen (3-10308) is in the University of California Robert H.
 Lowie Museum of Anthropology, Berkeley. Location is from field notes,
 Massey, 1946.

The use of bull-roarers for ceremonial purposes was nearly universal in southern California
(Drucker, 1937, p. 25). They have also been reported for the Kiliwa of northern Baja California,
where they were used by shamans in the ñiwey ceremony, and for placating ghosts by anyone in
an emergency (Meigs, 1939, p. 45).

Projectiles.--A single compound arrow (139587) or dart is in the Palmer Collection. Although
it is broken, there can be no doubt that the two pieces of cane shaft form a single piece,
92.5 cm. in length (pl. 15, a). There is no foreshaft. The sting-ray spine, which makes an
excellent natural projectile point, was let directly into the split end of the cane, and was
secured by cord binding (see "Haftings"). Instead of the usual nock in the butt end of the
shaft for a bowstring, there is a cuplike depression (fig. 1). This suggests, of course, that
this may have been a dart for use with a thrower or atlatl. Although that weapon is unreported
in the Spanish sources on central and northern Baja California, dart-throwers were reported
by Spanish explorers for the first quarter of the 17th century for the southern Cape Region;
they are also known archaeologically from the same area (Massey, 1957, pp. 55-62).

One smoothed wooden specimen (139560) appears to have been a foreshaft. It is sharply pointed
at one end, and has a cuplike depression in the opposite, thicker end. It is straight and tapered,
with a length of 38 cm. (pl. 15, f). Similar specimens are common in historic levels of caves
in the Sierra de La Giganta (Massey and Tuohy, MS).

Viznaga spines.--A bundle of seven spines of the Viznaga cactus (Echinocactus wislizeni) was
found (139547; pl. 14, a). These spines had all been straightened from their natural curved
condition. They could have served a variety of piercing purposes.

Miscellaneous wooden artifacts.--In addition to the artifacts of vegetable origin that can
be identified with certainty, there are several fragments and whole specimens which remain
to be considered.

There is a round straight piece of wood (139559), measuring 30.5 cm. in length and 8 mm. in
diameter, which has both ends blunted and rounded, apparently from use in grinding and pounding
(pl. 15, e). Its exact use is unknown.

Two sticks, lashed together in two places, were found (139585a). Together they measure 50 cm.
in length (pl. 15, c). The longer pointed stick has a notched end as for an arrow butt (see
"Haftings" for details of the tying).

There is also a round, sharply pointed, and tapered fragment of hardwood with a length of 8.8
cm. The shape suggests that it may have been part of a digging stick; however, the specimen
is very highly polished on all of its preserved surfaces.

Two wooden fragments (139586) are listed in the catalogue of the United States National Museum
as parts of a bow. Actually there is little about their shape to suggest such a use (pl. 15,
b). Both are round in cross section, and they do not fit together. One piece (139586a), which
is 58 cm. in length, is slightly curved, with a knob carved on the complete end. There are
faint indications that there had previously been wrappings at this end. The other specimen
(139586b), with a length of 56.5 cm. and a diameter of 1.3 cm., is fragmental at both ends.
It has two places in which the shaft has been carved around. Incised diagonal lines mark the
surface in several places.

CORDAGE AND TEXTILES

In addition to the cordage used in the fabrication of articles of apparel, household utensils,
and for the hafting of tools, the cave contained the usual miscellany of prepared fibers and
knots (139544) usually of agave fiber. There is also a bundle of unspun hair tied in the center
with an overhand knot (139543). The bulk of the miscellaneous cordage is 2-ply cord--each single
S-twisted with a final Z-twist. Since the spinning is so uniformly of this twisting, it is
highly probable that manufacture of the cordage followed that described by Kissell for the
Papago, and noted in many other places. This method of "down movement" followed by an "up movement"
to make the 2-ply gives a preliminary S-twist and a final Z-twist (Kissell, 1916, p. 229).

Under the microscope, one of the specimens shows a single fiber, used as a tie at a position
where a new bundle of fibers is added, weaving in and out of the old and new bundles. This
gives the fibers much stronger binding than does twisting together alone. The twist is normally
medium-hard to hard with an occasional crêpe twist.

Fur-wrapped cord, of which only fragments were recovered, consists of strips of hide with fur
attached, about 1 cm. wide, wrapped around (S-twist) already prepared 2-ply agave fiber cord.
No articles were found which had been constructed with fur-wrapped cord.

Since these fragments are undoubtedly bits broken from finished articles or remnants from the
construction of articles, it is not surprising that, with one notable exception, they cover
the range of prepared cordage for the other specimens. The exception is cotton cord, of which
no fragments were recovered. This strengthens the hypothesis that the cotton cloth (139537)
was brought to the peninsula in its manufactured state.

Both human-hair cord and palm-fiber cordage, common to cave collections from the Cape Region
of southern Baja California, are missing here at Bahía de Los Angeles.

Square knots are most common in the collection of miscellaneous cordage. This is to be expected,
in view of the square-knot construction of the hairnets and carrying nets found in the cave.

Identifiable vegetal fibers include those of Apocynum sp. (probably cannabinum) and Agave sp.[3]

 [3] Identifications were made by Dr. Herbert Mason and Miss Annetta
 Carter, University of California Herbarium.

On a comparative basis the cordage and miscellaneous knots from Bahía de Los Angeles are most
like historic-period materials from central Baja California. Excavated sites and large private
collections there contain an overwhelming amount of cordage that is 2-ply Z-twist; both square
and overhand knots were found. Again like Bahía de Los Angeles, nets were made by the square-knot
technique (Massey and Tuohy, MS).

The southern part of the peninsula, on the contrary, exhibits 2-ply Z-twist cordage only in
slightly over 50 per cent of collected specimens. Both knots were known, but netting was made
entirely by lark's-head knotting (Massey, MS 1).

Simplest Uses of Prepared Cord

Four-warp weaving.--Many samples of 4-warp weaving were found in the miscellaneous fiber collection
(139544) and in a group of woven fragments (139554). None was found in connection with the
finished articles of the collection, so that their use is purely conjectural. The warp is generally
2-ply, Z-twist, medium- to hard-twist cordage; the weft is the same, but generally lighter
in weight than the warp.

Cord-wrapped sticks (bobbins?).--There are two kinds of sticks wrapped with cordage: single
short sticks loosely wrapped around the midsection (bobbins?), and pairs of sticks tied together
end-to-end tightly in two places. The cord on these specimens is invariably of the common 2-ply
Z-twist agave fiber.

One of the pairs of sticks (139585a), with a total length of 50 cm., consists of a pointed
stick with a nocked butt end lashed tightly to the second stick in two places (pl. 15, c).
The stick with the nock appears to be the butt end of a projectile shaft. If it were, it would
be unusual for Baja California, where projectile shafts are usually of cane. The second specimen
(139558d) consists of two lengths of cane, 10.3 and 5.4 cm. long, which are loosely bound with
a single-strand fiber (pl. 14, f).
