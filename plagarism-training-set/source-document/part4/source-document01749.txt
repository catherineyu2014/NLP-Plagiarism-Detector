By Writ of Privy Seal, PIGOTT.

SUPPLEMENTAL CHARTER, 9th September, 1884.

And whereas, in addition to the above provisions complained of, the absence of any power in
the said original charter enabling the Governor, Deputy-Governor, or any member of the Committee,
to resign office, or enabling votes to be taken by proxy, and the absence of several other
powers usually given to trading companies for the better regulation of their internal affairs,
has been found in practice to be very inconvenient and detrimental to the interests of the Company.

And whereas the Company is desirous that the provisions in the original charter above complained
of should be cancelled or modified, and has applied to us for a supplemental charter embodying
more suitable provisions.

Now know ye that We by these presents do will and ordain that the several provisions contained
in the said original charter relating to the election to the office of Governor, Deputy-Governor,
or Committee, and to the filling up of any vacancy in any such office, and requiring corporal
oaths to be taken, and the other provisions contained in the said original charter, shall,
so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions contained in this our charter, on and after
the day of the date of this our charter, cease to be in force and be annulled.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything contained in the original
charter, the presence of the Governor or Deputy-Governor at any general court or at any meeting
of the Governor, Deputy-Governor, and Committee (who are hereinafter collectively referred
to as the Board) shall not be essential for the proper holding of such court or Board meeting,
and that nothing done at any general court or meeting of the Board shall be questioned or disputed
on the ground of the absence of the Governor or Deputy-Governor from such general court or
meeting of the Board, and that in case neither the Governor nor Deputy-Governor happen to be
present at any such general court or meeting of the Board, at the appointed time for holding
such general court or meeting of the Board, the members of the Committee present or the major
part of them shall nominate and appoint one of themselves Chairman or President of such court
or Board, and that the general powers of management and other powers given by the said original
charter to any three members of the Committee, together with the Governor or Deputy-Governor,
shall be exerciseable by any four members of the Board, whether the Governor or Deputy-Governor
shall form one of such four or not.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything contained in the original
charter, a general court for the Company shall be held every year at such place and on such
day in November or December as may be appointed by the Board.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that every question submitted to a general court shall
be decided by a show of hands, unless before or upon the declaration of the result of the show
of hands, a poll is demanded by at least five members present at such general court, and holding
in the aggregate not less than One hundred shares, and unless a poll is so demanded a declaration
by the Chairman that the motion has been carried or lost, or carried or lost by a particular
majority, shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or the
proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against the motion, and that if a poll is
demanded as aforesaid, it shall be taken in such manner and at such time and place and either
at once or after an interval or adjournment, as the Chairman of the general court directs,
and the result of such poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the general court at which
the poll was demanded. In case of an equality of votes, the Chairman shall, whether on a show
of hands or at the poll, have a casting vote in addition to the vote or votes to which he may
be entitled as a member.

In computing the majority when a poll is demanded, reference shall be had to the number of
votes to which each member is entitled by this our charter.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything contained in the original
charter, every member of the Company shall have one vote for every five shares in the Company
held by him, and that any of those members who hold less than five shares may join their respective
shares, so as to make up five or more shares, and have one vote jointly for the same; provided
nevertheless that no member shall be entitled to vote, or to join with any other member or
members in making up a joint vote at any general Court in respect of any shares or share, unless
he shall have been the holder of such shares or share for at least six months prior to such
general Court.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that votes may be given at every general court either
personally or by proxy, but such proxy must be a proprietor in the Company, and himself entitled
to vote, and the appointment of every such proxy must be in writing and must be in the form
following or to the like effect, that is to say:

  I (or we) appoint  my (our) proxy to vote and act for
  me (us) and in my (our) name (names) on all questions at
  the general court of the Hudson's Bay Company to be held
  on the  day of  and every adjournment thereof whereat
  I (we) shall not be present in person. Dated this  of .

And We do hereby further will and ordain that the Chairman may, with the consent of the meeting,
adjourn any general court from time to time and place to place, but that no business shall
be transacted at any adjourned general court other than the business left unfinished at the
general court from which the adjournment took place.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything contained in the original
charter, the Governor, Deputy-Governor, and Committeemen shall, after the year One thousand
eight hundred and eighty-four, hold their respective offices subject to retirement by rotation
as hereinafter provided, that is to say, at the general court to be held in the year One thousand
eight hundred and eighty-five, and at every succeeding general court, three members of the
Board shall retire from office, and that, until all the present Board shall in turn have retired,
the members of the Board to retire shall from time to time be determined by ballot or otherwise
amongst the members of the present Board, or such of them as for the time being shall not have
retired, but afterwards the members of the Board to retire shall be those who shall have been
longest in office since their last election, and as between members of the Board of equal seniority
the member or members to retire shall be determined by lot; provided always that the Governor
and Deputy-Governor shall not both retire at the same time, and that in the ballot for determining
who shall retire in the year One thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, the Governor and Deputy-Governor
shall not both be included, but only one of them, such one to be determined by lot; and in
the event of neither the Governor nor the Deputy-Governor being selected by ballot to retire
in the year One thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, one of them to be determined by lot
shall retire in the year One thousand eight hundred and eighty-six. And provided always that
a retiring member of the Board shall be eligible for re-election, and that, if the retiring
member be the Governor or Deputy-Governor of the Company, he shall be eligible for re-election,
or any other member of the Board shall be eligible for election as Governor or Deputy-Governor
respectively; and in the event of any member of the Board being elected to the office of Governor
or Deputy-Governor, in the place of the retiring Governor or Deputy-Governor such member shall
be deemed to have retired from his former office.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything contained in the original
charter, the Company at any general court at which any members of the Board retire in manner
aforesaid shall if it be the turn for the Governor or Deputy-Governor to retire first fill
up that office, and then shall fill up the other vacated offices, including any office rendered
vacant by the election of any member of the Board to the office of Governor or Deputy-Governor
as aforesaid, by electing a like number of persons to be members of the Board; and that every
election or re-election to the office of Governor, Deputy-Governor, or Committee shall be conducted
in the manner and according to the forms from time to time to be prescribed by the bye-laws
of the Company, and that such notice of the names of every candidate for election or re-election
to any such office shall be given as may be required by the bye-laws for the time being in force.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that notwithstanding anything contained in the original
charter, any member of the Board may at any time give notice to the Board in writing of his
wish to resign, and on the acceptance of his resignation by the Board, but not before, his
office shall be vacant.

Nothing in this our charter contained shall affect the power given by the original charter
to the Company to remove any Governor, Deputy-Governor, or member of the Committee who should
not demean himself well in his respective office.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything in the original charter
contained, any casual vacancy occurring among the members of the Board through death, resignation,
removal, or other cause, except the expiration of the period of office, may be filled up by
the Board or the remaining members of the Board, whatever there number may be, and if the casual
vacancy occur in the office of Governor or Deputy-Governor, such vacancy may be filled by electing
any one of the remaining members of the Board; and if so filled up a casual vacancy shall be
deemed to have occurred in the office of the member of the Board so elected to the office of
Governor or Deputy-Governor; provided always that any person so chosen to fill up any casual
vacancy shall retain his office until the next general court held for the election of members
of the Board, and at such general court the Company shall either confirm such person in his
office or shall elect some other person to hold such office in his place, and provided always
that the person so chosen and confirmed as aforesaid or the person elected by the Company in
his stead (as the case may be) shall retain his office so long only as the vacating member
of the Board would have retained the same if no vacancy had occurred, and provided always that,
notwithstanding any vacancy in the Board, the continuing members of the Board may act so long
as there remains not less than four members of the Board.

And We do hereby further will and ordain that, notwithstanding anything contained in the original
charter, the corporal oath thereby required to be taken on the occasions and by the persons
therein mentioned shall no longer be required to be taken by any person on any occasion whatsoever.

BY WARRANT UNDER THE QUEEN'S SIGN MANUAL.
