In this same building the roof was composed of 12×6¼ ft.×4-in. slabs molded in tiers; a slab
was molded and when hard was carpeted with paper and the form moved up and a second slab molded
on top of the first. This operation was repeated until a tier of slabs had been molded. By
molding each slab with a 3-in. overlap, as shown by Fig. 245, they could be easily separated
by lifting on hooks inserted under the overhanging ends. Each slab contained 0.925 cu. yd.
of concrete and about 116¾ lbs. of reinforcement. The cost of molding one roof slab, including
materials, forms and labor, was as follows:

  Materials:                     Per slab.      Per cu. yd.
1 bbl. cement, at $1                $1.000        $1.081

  Grand totals                      $6.7335      $7.277

The roof slabs were raised from the casting beds by means of the locomotive crane and hooks,
as shown by Fig. 245, and loaded onto cars; eight slabs made a carload. The cars were run to
the work, where the gin poles hoisted the slabs one at a time to cars running on a track built
on timbers laid on top of the roof girders. A small derrick on rafters picked the slabs from
the hand car and set them in place. A gang of 15 men erected from 18 to 20 slabs per 10-hour
day. With average wages at 21 cts. per hour the cost of erection was (15 × $2.10) ÷ 19 = $1.66
per slab, or $1.79 per cu. yd. The total cost of slabs in place was thus:

  Item.    Per slab.      Per cu. yd.
Molding       $6.73         $7.27
Erecting       1.66          1.79
              -----         -----
Total         $8.39         $9.06

In studying these cost figures their limitations must be kept in mind. Because of the character
of the available data quantities had in several cases to be estimated from the working drawings.
The cost of lumber for and of framing column and girder forms is not included, but this is
partly balanced at least by the assumption that each form was erected complete for each column
and girder, which was not the case, as has been stated. Cost of plant is not included nor is
cost of shoring the columns until girders and struts were placed, nor are several minor miscellaneous
items.

~HOLLOW BLOCK WALL CONSTRUCTION.~--Three general processes of molding hollow wall blocks of
concrete are employed: (1) A dry mixture is heavily tamped into a mold and the block is immediately
released and set aside for curing; (2) a liquid is poured into molds, where the block remains
until hard: (3) a medium wet mixture is compressed into a mold by hydraulic presses or other
means of securing great pressure. The molds used may be simple wooden boxes with removable
sides or mechanical molds of comparative complexity. Generally mechanical molds, or concrete
block machines as they are commonly called, will be used. There are a score or more kinds of
block machines all differing in construction and mode of operation. None of them will be described
here, but those interested may consult "Concrete Block Manufacture" by H. H. Rice or "Manufacture
of Concrete Blocks and Their Use in Building Construction" by H. H. Rice, Wm. M. Torrance and
others.

~Factory Buildings, Grand Rapids, Mich.~--The buildings ranged from one to four stories high
and altogether occupied some 74,000 sq. ft. of ground. The owners installed a block making
plant fully equipped with curing racks, two Ideal machines, two National concrete mixers, 5
h.p. gasoline engine, platens, tools and a Chase industrial railway.

The walls were constructed of 24-in. square pilasters of blocks arranged as shown by Fig. 246,
connected by curtain wall belt courses of single blocks. The blocks were 8×8×16 ins., and after
molding the faces were bush hammered and the edges tooled. The pilasters, consisting of four
blocks laid around an 8×8-in. hollow space, were solidified by pouring the 8×8-in. space and
all but the three outside block cavities with wet concrete. The interior of the building was
of regulation mill construction, and as the pilasters reached the heights for beam supports
cast iron plates with downward flanges were set in the concrete. These plates had a cast pin
projecting upward to fasten the beam end.

The materials used for the block were Sandusky Portland cement and ¾-in. bank gravel well balanced
from fine to coarse. The blocks were molded with 1-3 mortar faces, the mortar being waterproofed
by a mixture of Medusa waterproofing compound. All concrete was machine mixed. The men operating
the block machines were paid 1 ct. for each block molded, so that their pay depended upon the
energy with which they worked. The men handling materials and engaged in handling and curing
the blocks were paid $1.75 per day. The gravel was shoveled from the railway cars onto the
screens and from the screen piles to the mixers. The gang was organized as follows:

Item.                                                 Per day.
8 men handling materials, at $1.75                      $14.00
5 men operating molds, at 1 ct. per block                15.00
1 man mixing facing mortar, at $1.75                      1.75
2 men loading blocks onto trucks, at $1.75                3.50
2 men unloading blocks from trucks, at $1.75              3.50
3 men sprinkling blocks, at $1.75                         5.25
                                                        ------
Total, 21 men molding and curing blocks                 $43.00

The average daily run was 1,500 blocks, or 300 blocks per machine.

This output was easily maintained after the gang got broken in; sometimes it ran higher and
sometimes lower, but the average was as given. The men operating the block machines thus earned
$3 each per day. The labor cost of molding and curing per block was thus 2.87 cts. As the blocks
had about 25 per cent. hollow space, each block 8×8×16 ins. contained 0.45 cu. ft. of concrete;
a cubic yard of concrete, therefore, made 60 blocks, so that the labor cost of making the blocks
was 60 × 2.87 cts. = $1.72 per cubic yard. This cost does not include foreman's time, materials,
interest, depreciation or general expenses. It was estimated by the owners that the blocks
cost them 9 cts. apiece cured, or about $5.40 per cubic yard of concrete. This 9 cts. evidently
includes materials and labor alone.

Upon removal from the molds the blocks were loaded onto cars, taken to a large shed and there
unloaded onto shelving arranged to hold five rows of blocks one above the other, two blocks
opposite each other on each shelf. The blocks were left in the shed 24 to 48 hours to get the
preliminary set, then they were loaded on small cars and taken to the yard, where they were
removed from the cars and stacked. They were sprinkled every day for six days, being kept covered
meanwhile with oiled cotton cloth. The labor costs given above include molding, sprinkling
and handling the blocks up to this point.

To lay the blocks they were again loaded on cars and run to an elevator in a wooden tower outside
the building. The elevator lifted the car to the floor on which the blocks were to be used,
where it was run off onto a track reaching the full length of the building. The blocks were
unloaded directly behind the masons. Where the walls were high enough for scaffolding the blocks
were unloaded directly onto the first scaffold and, when necessary, handed up to the scaffolds
above. The masons employed were regular stone masons receiving the regular scale of wages of
$3.50 per day. The number of blocks laid by each mason was 125 per day in building pilasters
and 200 per day in building plain wall. Sometimes 250 blocks per day per man were laid in plain
wall work. The cost per block of laying above was thus 2.8 cts. pilasters and 1.75 cts. in
plain wall. This cost does not include transporting the blocks from yard or of handling them
to the scaffold behind the masons, nor does it include the cost of materials and labor for
mixing and delivering mortar.

One of the features of this work was the method of transporting the blocks by cars. A complete
system of tracks was provided covering the block plant and yard, the building sites and the
several floors of the buildings themselves. All blocks and other materials were transported
by cars running on these tracks, both cars and tracks being of the type made by the Chase Foundry
& Manufacturing Co. of Columbus, Ohio.

~Residence, Quogue, N. Y.~--The following record of methods and cost of constructing a concrete
block residence is furnished by Mr. Noyes F. Palmer: A mixture of sand and pebbles was had
on the site; screening was necessary merely to sort out the odd size stones. A mixture of 1
cement and 5 sand was really a 1-2-3 mixture, the 2 being the finest grades of sand and the
3 being various gravel sizes--none too large, none too small--so that the proportion was 2/5
fine sand and 3/5 gravel.

The concrete was hand mixed, and as the gravel had always just been excavated it contained
moisture and did not have to be wetted. The sand and gravel were mixed and turned three or
four times and spread out thin, and the cement was carefully spread over them in a uniform
layer. The mass was then turned three or four times until the eye could detect no difference
in color; that is, each grain large enough for the eye to discern seemed to be coated with
cement. After this dry mixing, water was added in a fine spray--not a deluge from a pail--but
only enough to moisten the mixture. The mass was then turned three or four times. The mixture
was then shoveled into the mold, no special face mixture being used, so as to about half fill
it, and was then tamped by two men, one standing on each side of the machine. Altogether three
layers of material were so placed and tamped and then a shovelful of sand and cement mixture
was spread over the top to permit an even "strike-off."

As each block was molded it was carried on the working plate and set down on skids properly
spaced to fit the marks on the plate. This is an important detail and Mr. Palmer comments on
it as follows: "The writer saw inexperienced men careless about it and who would break the
backs of many blocks by not having the skids properly placed. After the blocks have been at
rest for half an hour commence to spray them with a revolving garden sprinkler or by carefully
wetting with a sprinkling pot on the center of the block only. The blocks should not be allowed
to dry out for at least ten days after removal from the working plate. The removal from the
working plate can be done the morning after molding and should never be done before even if
the block was made in the morning. In removing the green block from the skids let there be
cones of sand between the rows of blocks and up-end each working plate so as to let the end
of the block come upon the sand cushion. Don't twist and turn the block, and to remove the
working plate pass a stick through the core holes in both block and plate so that the plate
will not fall when loosened. A slight rap on the center of the plate will loosen it. As soon
as the blocks are up-ended commence the spraying and soak the sand underneath the block. It
may seem unnecessary to dwell on these points so long, but barrels of cement and barrels of
money have been wasted by neglecting to supply the hardening block with water. Curing is just
as important as molding in making concrete blocks."

The block construction had been detailed by the architect from cellar to roof, so that it was
known beforehand how many blocks of given size were to be made. The unit of length was 32 ins.;
this afforded fractional parts of 8 ins., 16 ins. and 24 ins., therefore all openings were
in multiples of 8 ins. Odd sizes were made, by inserting "blanks" in the mold box, to inches
or fractions of an inch if desired. This unit length was less mortar joints, while the unit
of height was 9 ins., or the same as four ordinary bricks with joints. The floor levels were
calculated in multiples of 9 ins., so that the wall could be finished all around where the
beams were to be seated. This beam course was made of solid blocks; that is, no cores were
used in molding them. With the machine used no change was required to mold these solid blocks
except to remove the cores. The core holes in the working plate were simply covered with pieces
of tin. The shape of the block was the same and the same materials were used.

The best record in making blocks for this work was 30 blocks, 8×9×32 ins., in one hour, working
six men, three mixing and three on the machine, and using one barrel of cement for 16 blocks.
This was a record run, however, a fair average being 20 blocks per hour, or 200 per ten hours,
which was the day worked. We have then the cost of making blocks as follows:

 1 foreman, at $2.50                               $ 2.50
 5 helpers, at $2                                   10.00
13 barrels cement, at $2                            26.00
10 cu. yds. sand and gravel, at $1                  10.00
Interest and depreciation on machine                 2.00
                                                   ------
Total for 200 blocks                               $50.50

This gives a cost per block of $50.50 ÷ 200 = 25¼ cts. The displacement in the wall of each
block is 1.75 cu. ft., or the same as 30 bricks.

The cost of laying blocks is the most uncertain item in the whole industry. Mr. Palmer states
that he has known of instances where it cost only 5 cts. per block and of other instances where,
because of the difficulty of getting help and its inexperience, it cost 15 cts. per block.
In this particular building one mason and three helpers laid 100 blocks per day. The building
had no long walls, but it did have many turns. The cost of laying, then, was as follows:

1 mason, at $4                                      $ 4.00
3 helpers, at $2                                      6.00
                                                     -----
      Total for 100 blocks                          $10.00

This gives a cost for laying of 10 cts. per block. We have, then:

Making 2,000 blocks                                    $505
Laying 2,000 blocks                                     200
                                                       ----
      Total                                            $705

This gives a cost of 35¼ cts. per block for making and laying.

The use of a derrick for laying the blocks proved a considerable item of economy in this work.
This derrick cost $50 and two men could mount and move it on the floor beams. It had a boom
reaching out over the wall and was operated by a windlass. A plug and feather to fit the center
6-in. hole in the block was used for hoisting the blocks. By this means blocks only seven days
old were laid without trouble. It may be noted that the walls were kept drenched with water
to make sure that the blocks did not dry out until they were at least 28 days old. In laying
the blocks a thin lath was used to keep the mortar back about one inch from the face. This
precaution will prevent much labor in cleaning the walls from mortar slobber.

~Two-Story Building, Albuquerque, N. M.~--The following record of cost of making 9×10×32-in.
hollow blocks in a Palmer machine and of laying 2,000 of them in two-story building walls is
given by Mr. J. M. Ackerman. Sand cost 60 cts. per cu. yd., and cement cost $3 per barrel.
Lime cost 30 cts. per bushel. One barrel of cement made 20 blocks, using a 1-4 sand mixture.
In making 2,000 blocks about 100 blocks, or 5 per cent., were lost by blocks breaking in hauling
from yard to building or by cutting blocks to fit the work. The blocks were molded by piece
work for 5 cts per block, all materials, tools and plant being supplied to the molders. Three
men with one machine made from 100 to 150 blocks per day. The cost was as follows:

    Item.                                        Per block.
Cement, at $3 per bbl.                                $0.15
Molding, at 5 cts. per block                           0.05
Sand, at 60 cts. per cu. yd.                           0.03
Carting, yard to building                              0.02
Lime and sand for mortar                               0.03
Laying in wall                                         0.10
Loss in making and cutting                             0.01
                                                      -----
      Total                                           $0.39

As each block gave 9 × 32 = 288 sq. ins., or 2 sq. ft., of wall surface, the cost of the wall
per square foot was 19.5 cts. Assuming 40 per cent. hollow space, each block contained 1 cu.
ft. of concrete, which cost 23 cts., or $6.21 per cu. yd., for materials and molding. Blocks
in the wall cost $10.55 Per cu. yd. of concrete.

~General Cost Data.~--The following data are given by Prof. Spencer B. Newberry. The average
weights of three sizes of hollow blocks are as follows:

  Size, ins.             P. C. Hollow Space.    Weight, lbs.
 8×9×32                      33-1/3            120
10×9×32                      33-1/3            150
12×9×32                      33-1/3            180

Costs of materials are assumed as follows:

Item.                                          Per 100 lbs. Cement, at $1.50 per bbl.     
$0.40 Hydrated lime, at $5 per ton                        $0.25 Sand, gravel or screenings,
at 25 cts. per ton      $0.012

Mixed in batches of 750 lbs., sufficient for six 8-in. or four 12-in. blocks, the cost of materials
per batch and per block will be for a 1-4 mixture as follows:

Item.                    Per Batch.   8-in. Block.   12-in. Block.
150 lbs. cement            $0.60         $0.10         $0.15
600 lbs. sand               0.072         0.012         0.018
                           ------        ------        ------
      Total                $0.672        $0.112        $0.168

In general a factory producing 600 8-in. blocks per day will require 25 men to operate it.
At an average wage of $1.80 per day the following is considered as a fair estimate of cost:

Item.                                Per Day.    Per Block.
Materials for 600 blocks               $ 60        $0.10
25 men, at $1.80                         45         0.075
Repairs                                  10         0.017
Office and miscellaneous                 20         0.034
                                       ----        ------
Total                                  $135        $0.226

This gives for 8×9×32-in. blocks a cost of about $6.78 per cu. yd. of concrete for materials
and molding or of 11.3 cts. per sq. ft. of face.

Mr. L. L. Bingham gives the following as the average cost per square foot of face for 10-in.
wall from data collected from a large number of block manufacturers operating in Iowa in 1905:

Cement at $1.60 per bbl.                         4.5 cts.
Sand                                             2.0 cts.
Labor at $1.83 per day                           3.8 cts.
                                                ---------
Total cost per square foot                      10.3 cts.

Assuming one-third hollow space, the cost for materials and molding was $5.05 per cu. yd. of
concrete not including interest, depreciation, repairs, superintendence or general expenses.

CHAPTER XXI.

METHODS AND COST OF AQUEDUCT AND SEWER CONSTRUCTION.

Aqueducts and sewers in concrete are of three kinds: (1) Continuous monolithic conduits, (2)
conduits laid up with molded concrete blocks, and (3) conduits made up of sections of molded
pipe. Block conduits and conduits of molded pipe are rare in America compared with monolithic
construction; examples of each are, however, given in succeeding sections, where forms, methods
of molding, etc., are described. The following discussion refers to monolithic construction alone.

~FORMS AND CENTERS.~--Forms and centers for conduit work have to meet several requirements.
They have to be rigid enough not only to withstand the actual loads coming on them, but to
keep from being warped by the alternate wetting and drying to which they are subjected. They
have also to be constructed to give a smooth surface to the conduit. To be economical, they
have to be capable of being taken down, moved ahead and re-erected quickly and easily. The
carpenter costs run high in constructing conduit forms, so that each form has to be made the
most of by repeated use.

Three different constructions of traveling forms are described in the succeeding sections.
For small work, such forms appear to offer certain advantages, but for conduits of considerable
size their convenience and economy are uncertain. The experience with the large traveling form
employed on the Salt River irrigation works in Arizona was, when all is said, rather discouraging.
The authors believe that for work of any size where the concrete must be supported for 24 hours
or more, forms of sectional construction will prove cheaper and more expeditious than any traveling
form so far devised.

No class of concrete work, perhaps, offer so good an opportunity for the use of metal forms
as does conduit work. The smooth surface left by metal forms is particularly advantageous,
and there is a material reduction in weight and a large increase in durability due, both to
the lack of wear and to freedom from warping. Steel forms of the Blaw type shown by Fig. 247,
have been used for conduits up to 25 ft. in diameter. The form illustrated, Fig. 247, was for
a 12-ft. 3-in. sewer; in this case a roof form alone was used, but full circular and egg-shape
forms are made. The Blaw collapsible Steel Centering Co., of Pittsburg, Pa., make and lease
steel forms of this type.

Sectional wooden forms for conduits of large diameters are shown by the drawings in several
of the succeeding sections. Figures 248 and 249 show such forms for small diameters. The form
shown by Fig. 248 is novel in the respect that after being assembled a square timber was passed
through it lengthwise, occupying the holes B and having its ends projecting and rounded to
form gudgeons. The form was mounted with these gudgeons resting on horses, so that it could
be rotated and thus wound with a narrow strip of thin steel plate. Thus sheathed, the form
was lowered into the trench and the concrete was placed around it. When the arch had been turned,
the wedges A were driven in until the ribs C dropped into the slots a and clear of the steel
shell; the arch form was then pulled out and finally the invert form, leaving the steel shell
in place to hold the concrete until hard. The strip of steel was then removed by pulling on
one end until it unwound like cord from the inside of a ball of twine. Steel strips 6 ins.
wide and 1/24 in. thick were used successfully in constructing a 5-ft. egg-shaped sewer in
Washington, D. C. The forms were made in sections 16 ft. long, and were taken out as soon as
the concrete had been placed.

The form shown by Fig. 249, is an invert form, used in constructing the sewer shown by Fig.
249, built at Medford, Mass., in 1902, by day labor. The concrete was 1-3-6 gravel. The forms
for the invert were made collapsible and in 10-ft. lengths. The two halves were held together
by iron clamps and hook rods. The morning following the placing of the concrete the hook rods
were removed and turnbuckle hooks were put in their places, so that by tightening the turnbuckle
the forms were carefully separated from the concrete. The concrete was then allowed to stand
24 hours, when the arch centers were set in place. These centers were made of 7/8×1½-in. lagging
on 2-in. plank ribs 2 ft. apart, and stringers on each side. Wooden wedges on the forward end
of each section supported the rear end of the adjoining section. The forward end of each section
was supported by a screw jack placed under a rib 2 ft. from the front end. To remove the centers,
the rear end of a small truck was pushed under the section about 18 ins.; an adjustable roller
was fastened by a thumb screw to the forward rib of the center; the screw jack was lowered
allowing the roller to drop on a run board on top of the truck; the truck was then pulled back
by a tail rope until the adjustable roller ran off the end of the truck; whereupon the truck
was pulled forward drawing the center off the supporting wedges of the rear section. Each lineal
foot of sewer required 1¼ cu. yds. of excavation which cost 74.2 cts. per foot, and 1 cu. ft.
of brick arch which cost $12.07 per cu. yd., or 44.2 cts. per lineal foot of sewer. The invert
required 4 cu. ft. of concrete per foot, which cost as follows:

  Item.                             Per cu. yd.
Portland cement at $2.15 per bbl.     $2.292
Labor mixing and placing               3.017
Cost of forms                          0.187
Labor screening gravel                 0.471
Carting                                0.592
Miscellaneous                          0.146
                                      ------
  Total                               $6.705

The cost of the invert was thus $1.002 per lin. ft. of sewer.

Collapsible metal forms for manholes and catch basins are made by several firms which make
block and pipe molds. A cylindrical wooden form construction is shown by Fig. 250. The outside
form consists of three segments of a cylinder made of 2-in. lagging bolted to hoops. Bent lugs
on the ends of the hoops, were provided with open top slots and were bolted together through
1×3/8-in. bars which extended the full length of the form between lugs. The assembled form
was collapsed by pulling up on the bars, thus lifting the bolts out of the slots. The inner
mold is also made in three sections with strap hinges at two of the joints and at the third
joint a wedge-shaped stave. The other details are shown by the drawing. To mold the top of
the basin two cone-shaped forms are used, an outer form made in one piece and an inner form
made in sections. Some 26 catch basins were built in Keney Park, Hartford, Conn., by Mr. H.
G. Clark, at a cost of $7 apiece for concrete in place, and there was closely 1 cu. yd. of
concrete in each.

~CONCRETING.~--Except for pipes of small diameter, the concreting is done in sections, each
section being a day's work. Continuity of construction has not proved successful, except for
pipes of moderate size, in the few cases where it has been tried. Examples of continuous construction
methods are given in succeeding sections. Methods of molding and laying cast concrete pipe
are also best shown by the specific examples given further on. In concreting large diameters,
the work may be done by molding successive full barrel sections, or by molding first the invert
and then the roof arch, each in sections. The engineer's specifications generally stipulate
which plan is to be followed. Construction joints between sections are molded by bulkhead forms
framed to produce the type of joint designed by the engineer; the most common type is the tongue
and groove joint.

For small diameters built with traveling forms, a comparatively dry concrete is essential,
but when the centers are left in place until the concrete has set, a wet mixture is preferable,
as it is more easily placed and worked around the reinforcement in the thin shells. Mixers
are commonly specified even for small work, because of their generally more uniform and homogeneous
product. Portable mixers hauled along the bank and discharging into the forms through chutes,
furnish a cheap and rapid arrangement where the section being built has a considerable yardage.
The examples given in succeeding sections present various methods of mixing and placing concrete
in conduit work.

~REINFORCED CONDUIT, SALT RIVER IRRIGATION WORKS, ARIZONA.~--The pipe had the cross-section
shown by Fig. 251, and formed a syphon carrying water under the bed of a creek. The concrete
was a 1-2½-4 fine gravel mixture, mixed by hand on boards 150 ft. apart along the line. The
shell was reinforced as shown.

The forms consisted of an outside form constructed as shown by Fig. 251, by inserting 2½-in.×5½
ft. lagging strips in the metal ribs. The inside form was designed to permit continuous work
by moving the form ahead as the concreting progressed. It consisted as shown by Fig. 252, of
an invert form on which an arch form was carried on rollers. The invert form was pulled along
by cable from a horsepower whim set ahead, being steered, aligned and kept to grade by being
slid on a light wooden track. It had the form of a long half cylinder, with its forward end
beveled off to form a scoop-like snout. The arch center consisted of semi-circular rings 2
ft. long, set one at a time as the work required. Each ring, when set, was flange-bolted to
the one behind, and each was hinged at three points on the circumference to make it collapsible.
In operation, the invert form was intended to be pulled ahead and the arch rings to be placed
one after another in practically a continuous process. So that the arch rings might continue
supported after the invert form was drawn out from under them, invert plates similar to the
arch plates were inserted one after another in place of the shell of the invert form. The plan
provided very nicely for continuous work, but continuous work was found impracticable for all
but about 2,500 ft. of the 6,000 ft. of conduit built. The reason for this seems to have been
at least in a great measure, the slow setting cement made at the cement works established by
the Government, at Roosevelt. In building the first 300 ft. of conduit, a commercial cement
was used and a progress of 120 lin. ft. of pipe per 24 hours was easily made. This work was
done in June. Later, but still in warm weather, using the Government cement and 70 ft. of arch
plates, not more than 70 ft. of pipe could be completed in 24 hours; if the plates were taken
down sooner, patches of concrete fell out or peeled off with them. As the weather grew colder,
this difficulty increased, until finally, the idea of continuous work was abandoned and for
some 3,500 ft. of conduit only one 8-hour shift per day was worked. In December and January
the plates had to remain in place three days, so that the progress was only 24 ft. per day;
in warm weather this rate was increased to 40 ft. per day.

Costs were kept on two sections of one of the lines and the figures shown in the accompanying
table were obtained.

A gang consisted of a foreman at $175 per month, a sub-foreman at $3.50 per day, and the following
laborers at $2.50 per day: one bending the reinforcement rings; two placing the reinforcement;
four taking down, moving and erecting the stationary plates; four placing the concrete and
outside lagging; two wheeling concrete; six mixing concrete; one wheeling sand and gravel;
one watering the finished pipe; four laying track for the steering apparatus, moving the superstructure
and hangers, mixing boards, runways, etc.; one pointing and finishing inside the pipe; and
one on the whim and doing miscellaneous work. The labor was principally Mexican, and only fairly
efficient.

It is important to note that the costs given in the table are labor costs only of mixing and
placing concrete and moving forms; they do not include engineering, first cost of forms, concrete
materials, reinforcement or grading.

~CONDUITS, TORRESDALE FILTERS, PHILADELPHIA, PA.~--At the Torresdale plant of Philadelphia
filtration system the clear water conduits are reinforced concrete. The following description
is composed from information furnished the authors in 1904 by the Bureau of Filtration, Mr.
John W. Hill, then chief engineer. The lengths of the several conduits are as follows: 576
ft. of 7½-ft., 782 ft. of 8-ft., 1,050 ft. of 9-ft., and 1,430 ft. of 10-ft. horseshoe conduit.
All sizes of conduit have the same cross-sectional form--the cross-section of the 9-ft. conduit
is shown by Fig. 253, and all are reinforced by expanded metal arranged as indicated. The concrete
is a 1-3-5, ¾-in. stone mixture. The conduits were first designed with circular sections, but
before construction had been begun on these plans, experience had been obtained in building
a circular sewer that made a change to the horseshoe section appear desirable. In the circular
sewer work, great difficulty had been found in properly placing and ramming the concrete in
the lower quarters of the circular section.

Forms.--The forms used for the several sizes of conduit were all of the same general type,
but improvements in detail were made as successive sizes were built. The last form to be designed
was that for the 9-ft. section and this was the best one; it is shown by Fig. 254. The forms
were built in sections from 12 ft. to 13½ ft. long. They were covered with No. 27 galvanized
sheet iron, and this covering was found of advantage both in giving a smooth finish and in
prolonging the life of the centers. The important feature is the construction in sections which
could be set up and broken down by simply inserting and removing the connecting bolts. Three
sets of forms were made for each size of conduit.

Procedure of Work.--The first operation in building a section of conduit was to set to exact
line and grade and the length of the form in advance of the finished work the bulkhead shown
by Fig. 255. In this space the invert concrete was deposited and formed to a plane 1 in. below
the finished invert bottom. The two bottom sections of the form were then assembled and located
by bolting one end to the last preceding form and inserting the other end into the bulkhead.
About two tons of pig iron were then placed on the invert form to keep it from floating while
the liquid granolithic mixture was being poured into the 1-in. space between the form and the
invert concrete. In building up the sides a facing form was used for placing the granolithic
finish. This consisted of "boards" of sheet steel ribbed transversely on one side with ¾-in.
pipe and on the other side with 1½-in. pipe. Two boards were used on each haunch, slightly
lapping in the center, as follows: The board was placed with the small ribs against the form
and the larger ribs kept the expanded metal just 3 ins. from the face of the form. A 6-in.
depth of concrete was placed between the metal board and the outside form or planks, then 6
ins. of granolithic was poured into the 1-in. space between the center and the board and finally
the board was raised 6 ins. and the concrete and granolithic mixture tamped together. With
the board in its new position, another layer of concrete and granolithic was placed. Toward
the crown the granolithic mixture was made stiff and simply plastered onto the mold. The expanded
metal was cut into sheets corresponding to the length of the sides of the form and lapped 6
ins. in all directions; the bulkhead having a slot as shown to permit the metal to project
6 ins. from the face of the concrete in order to tie two sections together and also having
a rib which formed a mortise in the face of the shell of concrete to key it to the succeeding
section.

All the conduits were built in sections from 12 ft. to 13½ ft. long, and there was very little,
if any, difference in the labor required to build a section, in from eight to ten hours, of
any of the three sizes. One foreman and 18 men on the top of the trench mixed and handled the
concrete and granolithic mortar while one foreman, one carpenter and seven men in the trench
set the forms and placed and rammed the concrete for one section in generally eight hours.
About one-third of the concrete for the whole work was mixed in a portable cubical mixer of
½ cu. yd. capacity, and the remainder was mixed by hand. Owing to the relatively small amount
of concrete used per day, about 20 cu. yds., it was found that there was practically no difference
in the cost of machine mixing and of hand mixing. The 9-ft. conduit as an average of the three
sizes, contained 20 cu. yds. of concrete, 1,200 sq. ft. of expanded and required 125 bags of
cement for a section 13½ ft. long. The cost of the work excluding excavation and profit, but
including forms, metal, concrete materials and labor, was about $10.50 per cu. yd.

~CONDUIT, JERSEY CITY WATER SUPPLY.~--In constructing the 8½-ft. reinforced concrete conduit
for the Jersey City water supply, use was made of forms without bottoms. Each form was made
of segmental sections 12½ ft. long of wood covered with sheet steel. They were set end to end
in the trench, resting on 6-in. concrete cubes which were finally permanently embedded in the
invert concrete. In each form there was a scuttle about 2 ft. square at the crown, and the
bottom was open between the curves of the invert haunches. The form being set and greased and
the reinforcement placed, the concrete was deposited on the outside and forced by means of
tamping bars down the curve of the invert haunches until it filled the whole space between
the form and the earth and appeared at the edges of the bottom opening in the form. Concrete
was then thrown through the scuttle and the invert screeded into shape. The concreting of the
sides and crown of the arch was then completed, using outside forms except for about 5 ft.
of the crown, the scuttle, of course, being closed by a fitted cover. The centers were left
in place about 48 hours. The concrete was a 1 cement 7 sand and run of the crusher 2-in. broken
stone mixture, and was made so wet that it would flow down an incline of 1 on 8. The mixing
was done in portable Ransome mixers, set on the trench bank alongside the work and discharging
by chute into dished shoveling boxes provided with legs to set on the erected forms. Coal scoops
were used in shoveling from the box into the forms and were found superior to shovels in keeping
the relative proportions of water and solids constant.

~TWIN TUBE WATER CONDUIT AT NEWARK, N. J.~--In constructing the Cedar Grove Reservoir, at Newark,
N. J., two conduits side by side were built across the bottom from gate house to tunnel outlet.
A section of one of the conduits showing the form construction and the arrangement of the reinforcement
is given by Fig. 256. The concrete was a 1-2-5 1½-in. stone mixture and the reinforcement was
No. 10 3-in. mesh expanded metal. The method and cost of construction are given as follows,
by Mr. G. C. Woollard, the engineer for the contractors.

"The particular thing that was insisted upon by both Mr. M. R. Sherrerd, the chief engineer
of the Newark Water Department and Mr. Carlton E. Davis, the resident engineer at Cedar Grove
Reservoir, in connection with these conduits, was that they be built without sections in their
circumference, that the whole of the circumference of any one section of the length should
be constructed at one time. They were perfectly willing to allow us to build the conduit in
any length section we desired, so long as we left an expansion joint occasionally which did
not leak.

"The good construction of these conduits was demonstrated later, when the section stood 40
lbs. pressure to the square inch, and, in addition, I may say that these conduits have not
leaked at all since their construction. This shows the wisdom of building the conduit all round
in one piece, that is, in placing the concrete over the centers all at one time, instead of
building a portion of it, and then completing that portion later, after the lower portion had
had an opportunity to set.

"The centers which I designed on this work were very simple and inexpensive, as will be gathered
from the cost of the work, when I state that this conduit, which measured only 0.8 cu. yd.
of concrete to the lineal foot of single conduit, cost only $6.14 per cu. yd., built with Atlas
cement, including all labor and forms and material, and expanded metal. The forms were built
in 16 ft. lengths, each 16 ft. length having five of the segmental ribbed centers such as are
shown in Fig. 256, viz., one center at each end and three intermediate centers in the length
of 16 ft. These segments were made by a mill in Newark and cost 90 cts. apiece, not including
the bolts. We placed the lagging on these forms at the reservoir, and it was made of ordinary
2×4 material, surfaced on both sides, with the edges beveled to the radius of the circle. These
pieces of 2×4 were nailed with two 10d. nails to each segment. The segments were held together
by four ½-in. bolts, which passed through the center, and 1½-in. wooden tie block. There was
no bottom segment to the circle. This was left open, and the whole form held apart by a piece,
B, of 3×2 spruce, with a bolt at each end bolted to the lower segment on each side.

"The outside forms consisted of four steel angles to each 16 ft. of the conduit, one on each
end, and two, back to back, in the middle of each 16 ft. length. These angles were 2×3, with
the 2-in. side on the conduit, and the 3-in. side of the angle had small lugs bolted on it
at intervals, to receive the 2×12 plank, which was slipped down on the outside of the conduit,
as it was raised in height. The angles were held from kicking out at the bottom by stakes driven
into the ground, and held together at the top by a 2½-in. tie-rod.

"The conduit was 8 ins. thick, save at the bottom, where it was 12 ins. The reason for the
12 ins. at the bottom was that the forms had to have a firm foundation to rest on, in order
to put all the weight required by the conduit on them in one day or at one time, without settling.
We therefore excavated the conduit to grade the entire length, and deposited a 4-in. layer
of concrete to level and grade over the entire length of the conduit line. This gave us a good,
firm foundation, true and accurate to work from, and this is the secret of the good work which
was done on these conduits. If you examine them, you will say that they are one of the neatest
jobs of concrete in this line that has been built, especially with regard to the inside, which
is true, level and absolutely smooth. [The authors can confirm this statement.] When the conduit
is filled with water, it falls off with absolutely no point where water stands in the conduit,
owing to its being out or the proper amount of concrete not being deposited.

"The centers were placed in their entirety on a new length of conduit to be built, resting
upon four piles of brick, two at each end as shown. The first concrete was placed in the forms
at the point marked X and the next concrete was dropped in through a trap door cut in the roof
of the conduit form at the point marked Y. This material was dropped in to form the invert,
and this portion was shaped by hand with trowels and screeded to the exact radius of the conduit.
The concrete was then placed continuously up the sides, and boards were dropped in the angles
which I have mentioned, and which served as outside form holders till the limit was reached
at the top, where it was impossible to get the concrete in under the planking and thoroughly
tamped. At this point the top was formed by hand and with screeds.

"Each 16-ft. length of this conduit was made with opposite ends male and female respectively,
that is, we had a small form which allowed the concrete to step down at one end to 3 ins. in
thickness for 8 ins. back from the end of the section, and on the other end of the section
it allowed it to step down to 3 ins. in thickness in exactly the opposite way, making a scarf
joint. This was not done at every 16 ft. length, unless only 16 ft. were placed in one day.
We usually placed 48 ft. a day at one end of the conduit with one gang of men. This was allowed
to set 24 hours, and, whatever length of conduit was undertaken in a day, was absolutely completed,
rain or shine, and the gang next day resumed operations at the other end of the conduit on
another 48 ft. length. This was completed, no matter what the weather conditions were, and,
towards the close of this day the forms placed on the preceding day were being drawn and moved
ahead.

"The method used in moving these forms ahead for another day's work is probably one of the
secrets of the low cost of this work, and it is one which we have never seen employed before.
The bolt at A, Fig. 256, was taken out, and the tie brace B thrown up. We had hooks at the
points C. A turnbuckle was thrown in, catching these hooks, and given several sharp turns,
causing the entire form to spring downward and inwards, which gave it just enough clearance
to be carried forward, without doing any more striking of forms than pulling the bolt at A.
This method of pulling the forms worked absolutely satisfactorily, and never gave any trouble,
and we were able to move the forms very late in the day and get them all set for next day's
work, giving all the concrete practically 24 hours' set, as we always started concreting in
the morning at the furthest end of the form set up and at the greatest distance from the old
concrete possible in the 48 ft. length, as the furthest form had, of course, to be moved first,
it being impossible to pass one form through the other.

"Six 16-ft. sections of these forms were built, and three were used each day on each end, as
shown by the diagram MN, Fig. 256, which gives the day for the month for the completion of
each of seven 48-ft. sections.

"A gang of men simply shifted on alternate days from end to end of the conduit, although several
sections were in progress at one time; and of course, finally, when a junction was made between
any division, say of 1,000 ft. to another 1,000 ft., one small form was left in at this junction
inside of the conduit, and had to be taken down and taken out the entire length of the conduit.

"The centers for a 16-ft. length of this conduit cost complete for labor and material, $18.30,
but they were used over and over again; and, after this conduit was completed, they were taken
away for use at other points, so that the cost is hardly appreciable, and the only charge to
centers that we made after the first cost of building the centers, was on account of moving
them daily. Part of this conduit was built double (two 6-ft. conduits) and part single, the
only difference being that, where the double conduit was built, two forms were placed side
by side, and not so much was undertaken in one day.

"These conduits, when completed and dried out, rung exactly like a 60-in. cast-iron pipe, when
any one walked through them or stamped on the bottom."

Mr. Woollard gives the following analysis of the cost per cubic yard of the concrete-steel
conduit above described:

                                   Per cu. yd.
1.3 bbl. cement                          $1.43
10 cu. ft. sand                           0.35
25 cu. ft. stone                          1.10
26 sq. ft. expanded metal, at 3 cts.      0.78
Loading and hauling materials 2,000 ft.
  to the mixing board (team at $4.50)     0.50
Labor mixing, placing, and ramming        1.38

                                         -----
Total                                    $6.14

Wages were 17½ cts. per hr. for laborers and 50 cts. per hr. for foremen. The concrete was
1-2-5, a barrel being assumed to be 3.8 cu. ft. The concrete was mixed by hand on platforms
alongside the conduit. The cost of placing and ramming was high, on account of the expanded
metal, the small space in which to tamp, and to the screeding cost. When forms were moved they
were scraped and brushed with soft soap before being used again.

From Mr. Morris R. Sherrerd, Engineer and Superintendent, Department of Water, Newark, N. J.,
we have received the following data which differ slightly from those given by Mr. Woollard.
The differences may be explained by the fact that the cost records were made at different times.
Mr. Sherrerd states (Sept. 26, 1904,) that each batch contains 4 cu. ft. of cement, 8 cu. ft.
of sand, and 20 cu. ft. of stone, making 22 cu. ft. of concrete in place. One bag of cement
is assumed to hold 1 cu. ft. He adds that a 10-hour day's work for a gang is 63 lin. ft. of
single 6-ft. conduit containing 47.4 cu. yds. of concrete and 1,260 sq. ft. of expanded metal.
This is equivalent to ¾ cu. yd. of concrete per lin. ft. The total cost of material for one
complete set of forms 64 ft. long was $160; and there were 7 of these sets required to keep
two gangs of men busy, each gang building 63 lin. ft. of conduit a day. Since the total length
of the conduit was 3,850 ft., the first cost of the material in the forms was 18 cts. per lin. ft.

Cost of Labor on 6-ft. Conduit:

                                       Per day.     Per cu. yd.

It will be noted that it required two men to bend and place the 700 lbs., or 1,260 sq. ft.,
of expanded metal required for 63 lin. ft. of conduit per day, which is equivalent to ½c per
lb., or 3 cts. per sq. ft., for the labor of shaping, placing and fastening the metal.

~CIRCULAR SEWER, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA.~--In building 2,464 ft. of 66-in. circular reinforced
concrete sewer at South Bend, Ind., in 1906, the method of construction illustrated in Figs.
257, 258 and 259 was employed. The sewer has a 9-in. shell buttressed on the sides and is reinforced
every 12 ins. by a 3/16×1-in. peripheral bar in the sides and roof and 3 ins. in from the soffit.
Each bar is composed of three pieces, two side pieces from 15 ins. below to 6 ins. above springing
lines and a connecting roof bar attached to the side bars by cotter pins. Two grades of concrete
were used, a 1-3-6 bank gravel concrete for the invert and a 1-2-4 bank gravel concrete for
the arch. The invert was given a ½-in. plaster coat of 1-1 mortar as high as the springing lines.

Forms and Concreting.--In constructing the sewer the trench was excavated so as to give a clearance
of 1 ft. on each side and was sheeted as shown by Fig. 257. The sewer was built in 12 ft. sections
as follows: The bottom of the trench was shaped as nearly as possible to the grade and shape
of the base of the sewer. Four braces to each 12 ft. section were then nailed across the trench
between the lowest rangers on the trench sheeting. A partial form consisting of a vertical
row of lagging was set on each of the outside lines of the sewer barrel as shown by Fig. 257.
Each section of this lagging was held by stakes driven into the trench bottom and nailed at
their tops to the cross braces as shown by Fig. 258. A template for the invert was then suspended
from the cross braces by pieces nailed to the four ribs of the template and to the cross braces
as shown by Fig. 257. The concrete was now placed and carried to the top of the template, which
was then removed. The side pieces of the reinforcing bars were then set and fastened as shown
by Fig. 258. The side forms extending up to the springing lines were then placed. They were
held in position by braces nailed to their ribs at the tops and by other braces fitting into
notches in the ends of their ribs at the bottom. The concrete was then carried up to the springing
lines, the arch centers in two pieces were placed; the arch bar of the reinforcement was placed
and the extrados forms erected up to the 45° lines, all as shown by Fig. 259. The placing of
the arch concrete completed the sewer barrel. The outside forms and bracing were removed about
24 hours after the completion of the arch and back filling the trench was begun immediately,
but the inside forms were left in place for two weeks; they were then removed by the simple
process of knocking out the notched braces. By building several lengths of invert first and
following in succession by the side wall construction and then by the arch construction, the
form erection and the concreting proceeded without interruption by each other. It was also
found that, by making bends in the form of polygons with 10 ft. sides instead of in the form
of curves, there was a material saving in expensive form work. To overcome the friction of
the angles in such bends an additional fall was provided at these places. All concrete was
made in a Smith mixer mounted on trucks so that it could be moved along the bank of the trench
and discharging into a trough leading to the work.

Labor Force and Cost.--With a gang of 12 men from 24 to 36 ft. of sewer was built per 10-hour
day, working only part of the time on actual concreting. The disposition of the force mixing
and laying concrete and the wages were as follows:

  Item.                                Per day.
Six wheelers, at 18.5 cts. per hour      $11.10
One mixer, at 22.5 cts. per hour           2.25
One dumper, at 18.5 cts. per hour          1.85
Four placers, at 22.5 cts. per hour        9.00

  Total                                  $24.20

There were 0.594 cu. yd. of concrete per lineal foot of sewer and its cost is given as follows:

~SEWER INVERT, HAVERHILL, MASS.~--In constructing sewers with concrete inverts at Haverhill,
Mass., in 1905, use was made of the traveling form or mold shown by Fig. 260. The form consists
of an inner and an outer shell, the annular space between which forms the mold; in operation
the annular space is filled with concrete, then the outer shell is pulled ahead from underneath,
leaving the inner shell in place. A second inner shell is then adjusted to the outer shell
in its new position, the annular mold is concreted and the outer shell again pulled ahead.
Continued repetition of the operations described completes the invert. The merit of the device
lies in the fact that the inner shell is not moved until the concrete has attained some degree
of rigidity; when, in such devices, the inner mold is slid ahead on the green concrete it is
likely so to "drag" forward the material that a rough and pitted surface results.

Mold Construction.--Referring to the drawings of Fig. 260, A is the outer mold of sheet steel
bent to the required shape of the outer surface of the conduit to be constructed. A rib, or
angle, B, is riveted to the inside of the mold at its front end and a diaphragm C of plank
is securely fastened to the rear side of the rib. The opposite or rear end of the mold is open.
Angles D forming tracks are riveted inside the mold a short distance below the edges and reaching
their full length. The inner mold comprises a steel shell E curved to the form of the inside
of the conduit; inside this steel shell is a reinforcing lagging, and at each end there is
a wooden diaphragm F. Passing through both end diaphragms and having its ends flush with the
end planes of the mold is a timber G. Rearward projecting lips e are secured to the lagging
at the rear end of the mold and on each side of the timber G. The diaphragms F have each two
arms f which project horizontally beyond the surface of the inner mold and engage the tracks
D; locking dogs H are pivoted to the arms f so as to hook under the track angles D and hold
the inner form from rising. Setting on the inner mold is an inverted V-shaped deflector I;
its edges are flush with the sides of the mold and its purpose is to facilitate the placing
of the concrete. There is also a movable diaphragm K, fitting loosely inside the outer mold
A and bearing against the end of the inner mold E. The length of the inner mold E is about
one-half that of the outer mold A; as a rule several inner molds are provided with one outer mold.

Mode of Operation.--In using the device described the outer mold A is first placed in the trench
with its rear end at the end of the trench. An inner mold E is then suspended on the tracks
of the outer mold and locked therein by the dogs H, with its rear end flush with the rear end
of the outer mold. The partition K is then placed in position against the forward end of the
inner mold and a jack J of any suitable form is interposed between diaphragms K and C, the
jack being extended sufficiently to press diaphragm K firmly against the front end of the inner
mold. The deflector I is next placed in position on the inner mold and the concrete is forced
down with an iron rammer between the two molds, so as to fill completely the annular space.
The deflector aids in directing the concrete into this space, as will be obvious. After the
mold has been filled and the concrete compacted as much as possible, the jack is operated to
separate the diaphragms K and C, and as the partition K is pressed against one end of the mass
of concrete which has been laid, the opposite end of which abuts against the end of the trench,
it follows that any backward movement of the diaphragm K will compress the concrete. This movement
will be practically inappreciable in distance, but enough to compact thoroughly the concrete
and fill any voids. The action of the jack will also push forward the diaphragm C and the outer
mold A, the latter being withdrawn from beneath the inner mold and the newly laid concrete,
the tracks D of the outer mold being drawn from beneath the arms f of the inner mold, leaving
the latter behind resting on the freshly laid concrete. Further compression of the concrete
after it has been left by the outer mold will fill the spaces between the inner mold and the
surface of the trench. The outer mold is moved forward in this manner a distance equal to the
length of the inner mold, and then the diaphragm K is drawn forward and another inner mold
is lowered into the outer mold exactly as was the first one. The jack is then placed, the concrete
deposited and the outer mold again advanced exactly as before. As the outer mold advances,
the inner molds become disengaged one after another and are set ahead; in practice, enough
inner molds are provided to enable the concrete to harden sufficiently to keep its position
when it becomes necessary to take up successively the rearmost molds and place them ahead.

Haverhill Sewer Work.--The work at Haverhill, Mass., previously mentioned in which the form
just described was used, was a 24-in. circular sewer with 6-in. walls. The outer form was 36
ins. in diameter and 6 ft. 2 ins. long; the inner form was 24 ins. in diameter and 3 ft. long.
Angle B was 3 ins. and the track angles D were 1½ ins.; diaphragm K was made of two thicknesses
of 3-in. plank and diaphragm C of one thickness of 3-in. plank, the other diaphragms were of
2-in. plank. The shells of the molds were of ¼-in. steel plate; the jack was an ordinary screw
jack. Eight inner molds were used.

The form used at Haverhill was built by the city carpenter, the metal portions being made in
a boiler shop. Its cost was not ascertained, but was, it is thought, about $75. The concrete
used was a 1-3-5 stone mixture, with cement costing $2 per barrel, sand $1.50 per load of 36
cu. ft., and stone $2.50 per load of 36 cu. ft. The men were paid 25 cts. per hour. Records
kept on 265 ft. of invert, or, theoretically, 19.3 cu. yds. of concrete, gave the following
figures:

                                      Per       Per
                                    lin. ft.  cu. yd.
Labor, setting and moving
  forms, 42 hours, at 25 cts.          $0.05    $0.67
Labor, mixing, placing and wheeling
  concrete, 179 hours, at 25 cts.       0.16     2.19
                                       -----    -----
  Total labor cost                     $0.21    $2.86

With the ordinary 1-3-5 mixture the cost of materials would run about as follows:

                                 Per cu. yd.
Cement, 0.96 bbl., at $2.           $1.92
Sand, 0.47 cu. yd., at $1.13         0.53
Stone, 0.78 cu. yd., at $1.88        1.47
                                    -----
  Total cost materials              $3.92

Two men were worked in the trench, one alternately ramming the concrete into place and working
the jack, and the other shaping the trench ahead and assisting in bringing the rear forms ahead.

The form described was invented by Mr. Robert R. Evans, of Haverhill, Mass., and has been patented
by him.

~29-FT. SEWER, ST. LOUIS, MO.~--The following account of the method and cost of constructing
162 ft. of very large sewer section at St. Louis, Mo., is compiled from information furnished
by Mr. Curtis Hill.

The cross-section of the sewer is given by Fig. 261, which also shows the arrangement of the
reinforcing bars. Johnson corrugated bars, old style, are used for reinforcement. The sections
of the various reinforcing bars are: Longitudinal bars, 0.18 sq. in.; invert bars, 0.7 sq.
in., and arch bars, 0.7 sq. in. The spacing of the bars and the arrangement of the splices
are indicated on the drawings of Fig. 261. All splices have a lap of 36 ins. Some gravel concrete
has been used in the invert, but most of the concrete has been crushed limestone and Mississippi
River channel sand. The proportions were 1-3-6 in the invert and 1-2-5 in the arch. The arch
was computed by Prof. Greene's method. The ultimate strength of concrete in compression was
taken as 2,000 lbs. per sq. in. and the working strength at 500 lbs. per sq. in. The elastic
limit of the reinforcing bars was taken at 50,000 lbs.

The trenching was done by wheel scrapers to the amount of waste. Then a cableway was erected
spanning the entire length of the section and the remainder of the material taken out. The
last 4 or 5 ft. in depth were in limestone and the excavated rock was taken by cableway to
dump carts which took it to the crusher and returned with crushed rock to be used for concrete.
This rock foundation was taken advantage of to reduce the amount of invert concrete.

In constructing the sewer proper the invert was first concreted to template to the height shown
in Fig. 262. The arch forms were then placed as shown in Fig. 262, and the roof arch concreted.
Both templates and arch forms were constructed of wood. The arch forms were moved ahead on
iron rails and jacked into place. The ribs were 2×10-in. pieces and were spaced 4 ft. on centers;
the lagging was 2-in. tongue and grooved stuff and was smeared with crude oil. The reinforcing
bars shown in Fig. 261 were bent to proper radius by means of a wagon tire bender and were
held in place by templates. The concrete was all mixed by two Chicago Improved Cube mixers
operated by electric power.

The cost records of constructing the section of 29-ft. sewer so far built are not susceptible
of complete analysis, but the following figures can be given. The prices of materials were
as follows:

Cement, per barrel               $1.80 Sand, per cubic yard              0.75 Broken stone,
per cubic yard      1.00 Reinforcing bars, per pound       0.02 Vitrified brick, per 1,000

  Total for forms and labor     $3,580      $2.2375

For reinforcing the concrete 86,600 lbs. of steel, or about 55 lbs. per cu. yd. were used.
The cost of placing and bending this steel was as follows:

                   Total.      Per lb.
Cost of placing    $172      0.1986 ct.
Cost of bending      52      0.06   ct.

We can now summarize the cost of the concrete work proper of this sewer as follows:

  Total labor and materials            $7.15

To get the total cost of the sewer proper we must add the cost of the vitrified brick invert
paving. There were 71 cu. yds. of this paving and its cost was as follows:

                                     Per cu. yd.
0.6 bbls. cement at $1.80                 $1.08
0.25 cu. yd. sand at 75 cts.              0.19
450 bricks at $12 per M.                  5.40
Labor laying, 71 cu. yds. at $180.33      2.54

Total                                    $9.21

None of the preceding figures includes the plant charges. The plant cost $12,000 and the cost
of running it during the work described was $2,000. In explanation it should be noted that
the plant served for building some 1,340 lin. ft. of 27-ft. sewer as well as for the section
described.

~SEWER AT MIDDLESBOROUGH, KY.~--In constructing an oval sewer 4 ft. high at Middlesborough,
Ky., two steel forms in 10-ft. sections were used. As shown in Fig. 263, T-iron ribs were spaced
5 ft. apart, fastened together at the top by longitudinal angle irons, and at the bottom by
a sheet of steel 22 ins. wide, forming the bottom of the invert. The lagging for the sides
consists of movable 5-ft. lengths of channel iron, secured by sliding bolts. After the bottom
of the trench has been roughly shaped with concrete, a 10-ft. section of invert forms is lowered
and suspended by the cross-beams, and the space beneath packed with concrete; then a channel
iron is slid into place and bolted, and concrete packed behind it, and so on until the invert
is made. The next 10-ft. section is then built while the first is hardening. Upon the completion
of the second section, the channel iron sides of the first section are removed, and then the
rib framework is lifted out. Wood arch centers are then put in place and an inch of 1:2 plaster
spread over the lagging before placing the concrete for the arch, which is 6 ins. thick.

The cost per 100 ft. of this sewer was as follows (prices being assumed for cement and labor):

  Bottom concrete.               Cost per 100 ft.
18.5 bbls. cement, at $1.50          $ 27.75
2.7 cu. yds. sand, at $1.00.            2.70
15 cu. yds. stone, at $1.00            15.00

~INTERCEPTING SEWERS, CLEVELAND, O.~--An intercepting sewer some 3½ miles long, of the form
and construction shown in Fig. 264, was built at Cleveland, Ohio, in 1904. The construction
consists of a plain concrete invert lined with two courses of shale bricks, and having two
rows of anchor bars set in the side walls so that the bars of one row are staggered with respect
to those of the other row. The anchor bars are 2×½-in. steel, and are spaced 30 ins. apart
in each row. To the anchor bars are bolted arch reinforcing bars arranged as shown, and these
arch bars have bolted to them eight lines of 1½×¼-in. longitudinal bars. A natural cement concrete
is used for the invert and side walls. The arch is Portland cement concrete of normally a 1-3-7½,
1½-in. screened stone mixture, but where the voids in the broken stone exceeded 40 per cent.,
it is a 1-3-6 mixture. The invert bricks are laid in Portland cement mortar and the arch has
a mortar lining and is waterproofed with 1-in. of mortar on top.

Forms.--Separate forms were used for the invert and for the arch ring. Regarding these, the
engineer, Mr. Walter C. Parmley, remarks:

One of the first forms used in the sewer was like a piece of segmental arch centering inverted,
and with the lagging nailed fast to the ribs. The trouble with this form is that it is difficult
to tamp concrete under the bottom portion of the form, and hence a very rough surface is produced.
Much better results were obtained by omitting the lagging boards on the bottom and at the sides
till a point was reached where the inclination of the concrete surface was about 45°. The concrete
for the bottom could then be worked down between the ribs, thorough tamping done, and a good
surface obtained. The ribs serve as a guide, so that the workman produces the proper shape.
From this point up to the vertical, good results can be secured with the ribs attached to the
lagging. Some contractors found it more convenient to use ribs that were connected with each
other by a skeleton framework only, and then to slip the lagging in, one piece at a time. For
some of the sewers, in which the brick lining was not carried quite up to the spring line,
a separate side form of skeleton ribs and loose lagging was set upon brace legs bearing on
the bottom of the invert. This form carried the concrete from about 2 ft. below to about 2
ft. above the springing line. The arch ribs then became segmental and rested upon the middle
braces. This method has the advantage of using ribs that are lighter and more easily handled
than those that are semi-circular. For arch centering, it is necessary and convenient to use
independent ribs and loose lagging, for the centers can then be carried forward piece-meal,
the falsework upholding the green arch and re-erected at the advance end of the work. In these
matters each contractor prefers to use his own ingenuity, and so long as the work is properly
built, the engineer can well give him considerable latitude as to use of methods. One thing,
however, the engineer must insist upon--that all centering and falsework be as nearly rigid
as possible. Even a slight settlement of the centers at the crown under the load of concrete
and back-fill will cause the arch to kick out at the quarters, and if the green concrete arch
is not cracked at the crown, it will be crushed on the inside, about half way between the crown
and springing line. A reinforced arch is no more immune to this danger than is a plain concrete
arch. However, with a few days of hardening, although the damage may be serious, the danger
of actual collapse is less. A point to be guarded against, especially in reinforced construction,
is any foolish act on the part of contractor or workman, due to his overconfidence in the strength
of the structure because it contains embedded steel.

The mode of procedure in constructing the arch ring was to erect the centers with lagging complete.
The lagging was then covered with building paper waterproofed with paraffine. The arch reinforcing
bars were then bolted to the anchor bars and the longitudinals connected up. The lining of
Portland cement mortar was first laid on the lagging. Before this mortar had set, concrete
was rammed in between it and the sheeting to a height of 18 ins. above the springing line,
and then the remainder of the concrete placed without outside forms. The top of the arch ring
was finally finished with a 1-in. mortar coat. In regard to the concrete, Mr. Parmley remarks:

"Concrete will flush up to the forms and produce a better surface, and the voids in the stone
will be much better filled if it is so wet as to require but little tamping; moreover there
is less danger of obtaining a weak, porous wall should a workman neglect thorough tamping,
than there is where only a moist mixture is used. It is also to the contractor's interest to
use wet concrete for much less labor is required in mixing and placing it. Small broken stone
or gravel is preferable in concrete for sewers. The walls being comparatively thin, unless
there be a considerable excess of mortar, if coarse stones are used, the concrete will be honeycombed
with voids. The stones should be well graded in size from large to fine, but the largest fragments
should not exceed 1½ ins. in greatest dimension."

Cost.--A number of records of cost of constructing short sections of the sewer described are
given by Mr. Parmley, as follows:

  Labor placing anchor bars.                   Per day.
1 man, at $3.50                                   $3.50
1 man, at $1.75                                    1.75
4 hours carrying steel at 20 cts.                  0.80
                                                  -----
                                                  $6.05

The anchor bars were placed for 40 lin. ft. of sewer, or about 1,504 lbs. of metal at a cost
of 0.4 ct. per lb.

The concreting gang for the sides consisted of:

5 men wheeling and mixing at $1.75                   $8.75
1 man tamping                                         1.75
2/3 time man lowering brick and concrete at $2.25     1.50
1 man carrying concrete                               1.75
                                                    ------
                                                    $13.75

This gang built the side wall for 40 ft. of sewer daily, or 13 cu. yds. Cost of labor per cu.
yd. was, therefore, $1.06. The concrete was tamped behind the brick lining as the latter was
built up by the mason.

Cost of single ring brick lining at sides:

2 masons at 70 cents per hour                        $1.20
1 man mixing mortar                                   2.25
1/3 time man lowering at $2.25                        0.75
3 men wheeling sand, filling buckets and dumping      5.25
                                                    ------
  Total labor for 40 lin. ft. of sewer              $19.45
Quantity of brick masonry laid, cu. yd.               6.38
Labor per cu. yd.                                     3.05

An account was kept of labor performed on 85 lin. ft. of arch work, or 14 1-6 ft. daily. The
force was as follows:

1 man putting mortar lining on centering             $1.75
2 men mixing mortar, screening and wheeling sand      3.50
1 man tamping concrete                                1.75
8 men on mixing board at $1.75                       14.00
                                                    ------
                                                    $21.00
No. cu. yd. placed daily                             25.64
Labor per cu. yd.                                     0.82
  Placing centering and arch bars:
2 men at $1.75                                       $3.50
1 man at $3.50                                        3.50
                                                     -----
                                                     $7.00

Costs, for 14 1-6 ft. daily, $0.49 per lin. ft.

As nearly as could be judged, about two-thirds of the labor was used in erecting the centering
and one-third in putting the steel in place. The amount of steel placed daily was 785 lbs.,
at cost, therefore, of 0.3 of a cent per lb., and the cost of erecting and moving centers,
$0.33 per lin. ft. of arch.

Another record of 39.27 ft. on a curve, gave for the cost of the brick work at sides the same
result as above, but the inspector's record of men working on concrete backing at sides showed
a less cost, as follows:

4 men mixing at $1.75                             $7.00
2/3 time man lowering at $2.25                     1.50
1 man in bottom                                    1.75
                                                  -----
                                                 $10.25

They placed 12.7 cu. yd. at a cost of $0.81 per cu. yd. This figure probably more nearly represents
the average cost than the $1.06 reported in the first instance.

The cost of placing the anchor bars on straight sewer, representing average progress, at another
time, was found to be:

1 man                                             $3.50
1 man                                              1.75
                                                  -----
                                                  $5.25

They placed the steel for 44 ft. of sewer or 1,650 lb. at a cost of 0.32 of a cent per lb.

Further notes for 6 days' work, when it seemed to represent as nearly as possible the general
average for the whole were:

Labor on arch concrete:

Daily progress was 13 1-6 ft.

  The force employed was:
7 men making concrete, at $1.75      $12.25
1 man plastering the center            1.75
1 man mixing mortar                    2.00
1 man tamping                          1.75
                                      -----
                                     $17.75

On straight arch work they placed 24.1 cu. yd. daily at a cost of $0.74 per cu. yd. In three
days' work on a curve, the same gang placed 26.37 cu. yd. daily at a cost of $0.675 per cu. yd.

On centering and steel for arch, three men kept up with the regular progress of the arch-concreting
gang. The cost, therefore, is:

1 man                             $3.50
2 men at $1.75                     3.50
                                  -----
                                  $7.00

They averaged 13 ft. daily, or at a total cost of about $0.54 per lin. ft. of sewer.

Two-thirds of this labor was on the centering or $0.36 per lin. ft. of arch; $0.18 per lin.
ft. placed the steel ready for embedding, or about 55.5 lb. per ft. of arch, at a cost of 0.32
of a cent per lb.

For the double ring brick lining at the bottom, the regular daily rate of progress was 28 ft.
or 11.15 cu. yd. with:

2 bricklayers                    $11.20
5 men at $1.75                     8.75
1 man at $2.25                     2.25
                                  -----
                                 $22.20

or at a cost of $1.98 per cu. yd. This is given only because it is of interest in connection
with the cost of the concrete.

Other observations on cost of placing steel skeleton and concrete did not vary materially from
the figures given. It will be observed that no charge for superintendence or anything for the
general expenses is included in the estimates of cost. These charges were, of course, impossible
to obtain. On another contract with machine mixing, as high as 36 lin. ft. of 13 ft. 6 in.
arch were built in a day, but no data as to cost were taken, though it was evidently less than
for the work with hand-mixed concrete.

~REINFORCED CONCRETE SEWER AT WILMINGTON, DEL.~--Records of a notable job of sewer construction
at Wilmington, Del., in 1903, are furnished by Mr. T. Chalkley Hatton. The sewer was built
by day labor for the city; its cross-section at various points is shown by Fig. 265. The cross-section
of sewers in trenches deep enough to cover the arch are marked "deep cutting"; the sections
where the arch projects above the ground surface are marked "light cutting." The section through
the marsh was 700 ft. long, the cutting being 8 ft. deep, and at high tide the marsh was flooded
1 to 4 ft. The material was a soft mud that would pull a tight rubber boot from a workman's
foot. The cost of this marsh excavation including cofferdams, underdraining, pumping, etc.,
was $4.60 per cu. yd. For 1,100 ft. the 9¼ ft. sewer was through a cut 22 to 34 ft. deep, the
material being clay underlaid by granite. A Carson-Lidgerwood cableway was used. Although the
crown of the arch was but 8 ins. thick, it withstood the shock of dumping 1 cu. yd. buckets
of earth and rock from heights of 3 to 10 ft.; and the weight of 25 ft. of loose filling caused
no cracks in the concrete.

Concrete was placed in 4-in. layers (the depth of the lagging) and well rammed, since it was
found that "wet" concrete left small honeycombed spaces on the inner surface. Concrete for
the invert was 1-2-6, the stone being 1½-in. and smaller, and the sand being crusher dust.
The arch was 1-2-5.

The reinforcing metal used in the 9½-ft. sewer was No. 6 expanded metal, 6-in. mesh, in sheets
8×5½ ft., supplied by Merritt & Co., of Philadelphia. A single layer was placed around the
sewer, 2 ins. from the inner surface, its position being carefully maintained by the men ramming,
and with but little difficulty as the sheets were first bent to the radius of the circle. Each
sheet was lapped one mesh (6 ins.) over its neighbor at both ends and sides, and no sheets
were wired except the top ones, which were liable to displacement by men walking over them.

The metal used on the rest of the work was a wire-woven fabric furnished by the Wight-Easton-Townsend
Co., of New York. This fabric comes in rolls 5½ ft. wide and 100 ft. to the roll. The wire
is No. 8, with a 6×4-in. mesh. This fabric was placed by first cutting the sheets to the required
length to surround the sewer entirely, embedding it in the concrete as fast as concrete was
placed, in the same manner as was done with the expanded metal except over the center where,
on account of its pliability, the fabric was held the proper distance from the lagging by a
number of 2-in. blocks which were removed as the concrete was placed. The wire cloth, being
all in one sheet, can be placed a little more expeditiously than expanded metal, but, on the
other hand, the expanded metal holds its position better in the concrete, since it is more rigid.

We quote now from Mr. Hatton's letter: "The major portion of concrete was mixed by machine
at a cost of 66 cts. per yard, including wheeling to place, coal and running of mixing machine,
wages being $1.50 per day of 8 hrs, Stone was delivered alongside of machine and all material
had to be wheeled in barrows upon the platform, and after mixing to the sewer. Placing and
ramming concrete around the forms cost 39 cts. per cu. yd., additional. Setting forms in invert
cost 2 cts. per cu. yd., setting centers 7 cts. per cu. yd. Cost of setting forms and centers
includes placing steel metal. Each lineal foot of 9¼ ft. sewer contained 1 cu. yd. of concrete,
although the section only calls for 0.94 cu. yd. The excess was usually wasted by falling over
sides of forms or being made too thick at crown.

"This yard of 1-2-5 concrete cost in place as follows (record taken as an average of several-days'
run):

Cement, 1.31 bbls. at $1.30                            $1.703
Stone, 0.84 cu. yds. at $1.21                           1.016
Stone dust, 0.42 cu. yd. at $1.21                       0.508
Labor at 18¾ cts. per hour                              0.987
Labor setting forms and setting metal                   0.045
Cost of forms (distributed over 1,800 ft. of sewer)     0.082
40 sq. ft. expanded metal at 4¼ cts.                    1.700
Labor plastering invert                                 0.070
                                                       ------
  Cost per ft., or per cu. yd.                         $6.111

"The forms for the invert were made of 2-in. rough hemlock boards cut out 4 ins. less diameter
than the diameter of the sewer, except for 18 ins. at the bottom of the form which coincided
with the inside form of sewer. The bottom of the sewers was laid to the bottom of this form
before it was set. Then the lagging, consisting of 2×6-in.×16-ft. hemlock planed, was placed
against each side of the form, one at a time, and the concrete brought to the line of this
top in 6-in. layers until the whole invert was finished. These forms were set in 16-ft. sections,
five to each section.

"The centers consisted of seven ribs of 2-in. hemlock upon which was nailed 1½-in. lagging,
2 ins. wide, tongued and grooved, and were 16 ft. long, non-collapsible, but had one wing on
each side, 9 ins. wide, which could be wedged out to fit any inaccuracies in the invert. We
used four of these centers setting two at each operation and worked from two ends. We left
the centers in for 18 hours before drawing.

"The cost of the concrete on the smaller sewers was the same as are the larger sewers, but
the steel metal cost less, as it was wire woven metal that cost 2½ cts. per sq. ft. It was
much easier handled and cut to no waste as it came in long rolls and was very pliable.

"After training our men, which occupied about one week or 10 days, we had no difficulty in
getting the concrete well placed around the metal, preserving the proper location of the latter,
which, however, bore constant watching, as a careless workman would often take the temporary
supporting blocks and allow the metal to rest against the wooden center, in which case the
metal would show through the surface inside of the sewer. The metal was kept 2 ins. away from
the inside forms and the arch. To keep it at this location we had several 2-in. wooden blocks
cut which were slipped under the wire or expanded metal and as soon as some concrete was pushed
under the wire at this point the block was removed.

"After the forms were removed the invert needed plastering, but the arch was practically like
a smoothly plastered wall except where it joined the invert, where it frequently showed the
result of too much hurry in depositing the first loads of concrete on the arch. We remedied
this by requiring less concrete to be deposited at the start, thus giving the rammers time
to place the material properly.

"An interesting result was obtained in the smoothness of the inside surface by using a mixture
of different sized stones. When ¾-in. stones or smaller were used in the arch, the inside was
honeycombed; but, where 1 to 1½-in. stones (nothing smaller) were used, the inside was perfectly
smooth, and the same was true of the invert, showing that the use of larger stones is an advantage
and secures more monolithic work. When the run of the crusher from 1½ to ¾-in. stones was used
the work was not at all satisfactory.

"The difference in cost of mixing by hand and machine is practically nothing on this kind of
work. As the moving of the machine to keep pace with the progress of the work equals the extra
cost of mixing by hand when the mixing can be done close to the point where the cement is being
placed."

The total cost of the sewers, including excavation, etc., was:

                                         Cost per lin. ft.
9¼-ft. sewer through marsh                      $32.00
9¼-ft. sewer in cut averaging 24½ ft.            24.00
6½-ft. sewer in cut averaging 12 ft.             10.00
5-ft. sewer in cut averaging 11½ ft.              6.70

~SEWER WITH MONOLITHIC INVERT AND BLOCK ARCH.~--The following records of construction for a
sewer built at Coldwater, Mich., in 1901, are given by Mr. H. V. Gifford. The sewer had a monolithic
invert and a block arch.

The sewer was circular, having an inner diameter of 42 ins., the thickness of the invert and
the arch alike was 8 ins. Figure 266 is a cross-section. The concrete was 1 of Portland cement
to 6 of gravel. There were 11 concrete blocks in the ring of the arch, each block being 24
ins. long, 8 ins. thick, 8 ins. wide on the outside of the arch and 5¾ ins. wide on the inside
of the arch. A block weighed 90 lbs. which was too heavy for rapid laying; blocks 18 ins. long
would have been better. Some 8,500 blocks were made. Molds were of 2-in. lumber, lined with
tin, for after a little use it was found the concrete would stick to the wood when the mold
was removed. The four sides of the mold formed the extrados, the intrados, and the two ends
of the block; the other two sides being left open. When put together the mold was laid upon
a 1-in. board, 12×30 ins., reinforced by cleats across the bottom. The sides of the molds were
held together with screws or wedge clamps. When the blocks had set, the sides of the molds
were removed, and the blocks were left on the 12×30-in. boards for 3 days, then piled up, being
watered several times each day for a week.

A gang of 14 men made the blocks; 2 screening gravel through 1-in. mesh screen; 4 mixing concrete;
4 molders; 3 shifting and watering blocks, and 1 foreman. With a little practice each molder
could turn out 175 blocks a day; and since each block measured ¾ cu. ft., the output of the
14 men was 19½ cu. yds. a day. Mr. Gifford informs us that the wages were $1.50 a day for all
the men, except the foreman. The daily wages of the 14 men were $22, so that the labor of making
the blocks was $1.10 per cu. yd.

Each batch of concrete, containing ½ bbl. of Portland cement costing $1.35 per bbl., made 18
blocks. (1 bbl. per cu. yd.) Since the gravel cost nothing, except the labor of screening it,
the total cost of each block was 11 to 12 cts., which includes 0.85 cent for use of molds and
mold boards, which were an entire loss. At 12 cts. per block the cost was $4.32 per cu. yd.

The contract price was $3 per lin. ft. of this sewer, as against a bid of $3.40 per ft. for
a brick sewer.

When the trenching had reached to the level of the top of the invert, two rows of stakes were
driven in the bottom, stakes being 6 ft. apart in each row, and rows being a distance apart
¼-in. greater than the outer diameter of the sewer. These stakes were driven to such a grade
that the top of a 2×4-in. cap or "runner" set edgewise on top of them was at the proper grade
of the top of the invert. The excavation for the invert was then begun, and finished to the
proper curve by the aid of a templet drawn along the 2×4-in. runners. In gravel it was impossible
to hold the true curve of the invert bottom. Concrete was then placed for the invert. To hold
up the sides of the invert concrete, a board served as a support for the insides, but regular
forms were more satisfactory in every respect except that they were in the way of the workmen.
A form was tried, its length being 6 ft. It was built like the center for an arch, except that
the sheeting was omitted on the lower part of the invert. It was suspended from the cross-pieces
resting on the "runners." After the concrete had been rounded in place, the form was removed
and the invert trued up. This form worked well in soil that could be excavated a number of
feet ahead, so that the forms could be drawn ahead instead of having to be lifted out; but
in soil, where the concreting must immediately follow the excavation for the invert, the form
is in the way. The invert was trued up by drawing along the runners a semi-circular templet
having a radius of 21½ ins. Then a ½-in. coat of 1-2 mortar was roughly troweled on the green
concrete. Another templet having a 21-in. radius was then drawn along the runners to finish
the invert.

When the plaster had hardened, two courses of concrete blocks were laid on each shoulder of
the invert, using a 1-2-¼ mortar, the ¼ part being lime paste. The lime made the mortar more
plastic and easier to trowel. Then the form for the arch was placed, and as each 8-ft. section
of the arch was built, a grout of 1-1 mortar was poured over the top to fill the joints. Earth
was thrown on each shoulder and tamped, and the center moved ahead.

Common laborers were used for all the invert work, except the plastering which was done by
masons who were paid 30 cts. per hr. Masons were also used to lay the concrete blocks in the
arch. Mr. Gifford states that two masons would lay at the rate of 100 lin. ft. of arch per
day, if enough invert were prepared in advance. As there were 11 blocks in the ring of the
arch, this rate would be equivalent to 7½ cu. yds. of arch laid per mason per day.

~COST OF BLOCK MANHOLES.~--The following costs of constructing concrete block manholes for
electric conduit at Rye, N. Y., were recorded by Mr. Hugh C. Baker, Jr. The arrangement of
the blocks, their size and shape and the dimensions of the completed manholes are shown by
Fig. 267. The blocks were molded of 1-2-5¾-in. broken stone concrete in 30 wooden molds made
by a local carpenter at a cost of from $3.50 to $12 each. The concrete was placed in the molds
very wet, with very little tamping, and was allowed to set for seven days before the blocks
were moved to the work. The molds were left in place from 24 to 36 hours. With the facilities
at hand six complete sets of top blocks were made each day by four men, when no wall blocks
were being made, and half a set (15) wall blocks and two sets of top blocks were made each
day by four men. The cost of the block manholes complete was as follows, per manhole:

30 wall blocks, 2½ cu. yds.                        $21.00
6 cover blocks, 1½ cu. yds. reinforced               4.27
I-beams for cover, in place                          5.40
Supervision, freight, hauling 5.6 tons concrete      9.38
Labor placing cover, 3 hrs. at 15 cts.               0.45
Labor placing walls, 20 hrs. at 15 cts.              3.00
                                                   ------
  Total, exclusive of iron cover                   $43.50

~CEMENT PIPE, CONSTRUCTED IN PLACE.~--In constructing 8-in. cement sewer for the Foster Armstrong
Piano Co.'s works at Rochester, N. Y., a gang of seven men averaged 300 ft. of pipe per 10-hour
day, using a Ransome pipe mold. The mold is shown by Fig. 268. It is made of sheet steel, with
an inner core 10 ft. long, the front end of which is surrounded with a sheet steel shell that
serves as an outer form for the pipe. The mortar mixed rather dry was packed into the annular
space between core and shell by one man, using a short wooden rammer. A second man kept the
mold slowly moving forward by operating the lever, which by means of a ratchet and drum winds
up a wire rope stretched ahead to a deadman in the trench bottom. As the mold moves ahead it
leaves behind it the cement pipe. A third man carefully filled under the invert and over the
haunches of the green pipe with earth to give it support. The following was the itemized cost
per day, 300 ft. of pipe laid:

6 men at $1.70 per 10-hour day     $10.20
1 foreman                            3.00
3 bbls. cement at $1.25              3.75
3.3 cu. yds. sand at 85 cts.         2.80
Water                                0.15
                                   ------
  Total for 300 lin. ft.           $19.90

This is equivalent to 6.63 cts. per lin. ft. of pipe.

In Trans. C. E., Vol. 31, 1894, p. 153, James D. Schuyler gives the cost of cement pipe made
by the Ransome system for the Denver Water Works. There is a wrought iron shell of the size
of the inner diameter of the pipe forming the inner mold. To this shell is attached a "leader"
and "saddle" of larger diameter forming the outer mold. These molds are drawn slowly along
the trench by a cable and horse whim, and the concrete is shoveled continuously into the core
space between the molds and rammed on a long incline. The top half, or arch, of the pipe is
supported by sheet iron plates (2 ft. wide), placed one after another on the forward end of
the mold; and, being clamped together at the top and sides, remain in position after the mold
is slid out from under them. After the mold has passed along, these iron plates are supported
by upright sticks and by horizontal clamping rods. The plates are left in place for 24 to 48
hrs. The concrete, made 1-3½, river sand and gravel, was machine mixed. A gang of 30 men mixed,
wheeled, shoveled and tamped the concrete, attended to the plates, cleaning and greasing them,
etc. This gang would make short runs at the rate of 900 lin. ft. of pipe a day, but counting
stoppages, the average rate was 300 ft. a day. The inner diameter of the pipe was 38 ins.,
and its bottom was molded flat for a width of 18 ins. The concrete shell was 2½ to 3 ins. thick.
The pipe was washed with pure cement grout, applied with brushes after removing the iron plates.
With cement at $3.75 per bbl., gravel at $1.25 per cu. yd., and labor at $1.75 to $2 per day,
the cost of this pipe was $1.35 to $1.50 per ft., after the gang was well organized.

~PIPE SEWER, ST. JOSEPH, MO.~--In constructing extensions to 36-in., 42-in., 48-in. and 72-in.
sewers at St. Joseph, Mo., reinforced concrete pipe of the form shown by Fig. 269 was employed.
The thickness of shell for the various sizes was 4 ins., 4½ ins., 5 ins., and 7 ins. All sizes
were made in 3-ft. lengths, one end of which is rebated and beveled to form a spigot and the
other end of which is chamfered on the inner edge to receive the bevel of the spigot. This
jointing leaves a circumferential groove, into which the hooked ends of the longitudinal reinforcing
bars project in such a way that a circular hoop can be threaded through them to connect successive
lengths. The reinforcement is of the same form for all sizes of pipe, but seven longitudinals
were used in the 72-in. size and five for all smaller sizes; the circumferential bars were
in all cases spaced one 9 ins. from each end. The pipe, as described, is the standard pipe
made by the Reinforced Concrete Pipe Co., of Jackson, Mich., and is covered by patents. The
practice of this company is to manufacture the pipe itself on the ground and furnish it to
the contractor. It does not contract to build sewers nor does it dispose of rights to manufacture
to contractors.

Pipe Molding.--The pipe is molded endwise. A bottom plate so shaped as to form the hub or receiving
end of the pipe is set up. On the upper or inner flange of this cast iron bottom plate is set
the core defining the inside diameter of the pipe; this core is in four segments of sheet steel.
The longitudinal reinforcing bars are next inserted in slots in the bottom plate and the outside
form of sheet steel is then set up on the lower and outer flange of the bottom plate. Spacing
clips on the top edge of the outer shell hold the tops of the reinforcing bars in position.
The concrete is then shoveled into the annular mold and tamped until it reaches the level for
the first circumferential reinforcing bar; this is then placed by removing the spacing clips,
threading the hoop over the longitudinal bars and sliding it down to position. Filling and
tamping then proceeds until the second hoop is to be placed; this is placed exactly like the
first, and filling and tamping then proceeds until the mold is filled. At the St. Joseph work
a 1-2-3 mixture, with crushed limestone aggregate ranging from pea size to 1-in. stone was
used. The molding was done in tents which were heated by coke fires in salamanders in freezing
weather.

Pipe Laying.--In laying, the pipes are handled and lowered into position just as are cast iron
water pipe. Successive lengths are placed by inserting the spigot ends into the chamfered hub
ends and then threading the tie hoop through the hooked ends of the projecting longitudinal
reinforcing bars. A strip of galvanized iron is then passed under the pipe and bent up so as
to girdle the circumferential groove except for a space at the top; the groove is then poured
with a wet 1-2 cement mixture, which, when hardened, completes the joint.

~COST OF MOLDING SMALL CEMENT PIPE.~--Mr. Albert E. Wright gives the following account of the
method and cost of molding and laying 6 to 12-in. cement pipe for irregular work at Irrigon,
Ore.: The pipe was 6 to 12 ins. inside, made of Portland cement and clean, sharp sand of all
sizes up to very coarse. The mortar was mixed rather dry, but very thoroughly, using 14.1 cu.
ft. of sand to 1 bbl. of cement, or very closely a 1 to 4 mixture. From six to seven buckets
of water were used to each barrel of cement, except for the 6-in. pipe, for which the mortar
had to be made somewhat stiffer in order to remove the inner form, which was not made collapsible
as in the larger sizes.

The forms were sheet iron cylinders with a longitudinal lap joint that could be expanded after
molding the pipe, and removed without injuring the soft mortar. The inner form was self-centering,
so that there was little variation in the thickness of the pipe.

Four men were required in making cement pipe by hand; one mixed the mortar, and wheeled it
to the place of work; another threw it into the form a little at a time with a hand scoop;
a third rammed it with a tamping iron, and a fourth kept the new pipe sprinkled, and applied
a coat of neat cement slurry to the inside when it was sufficiently hard. In molding, the form
of the bell at the bottom was secured by an iron ring that was first dropped into the form,
and the reverse or convex form at the top was made with a second ring. While still in its form
the pipe was rolled or lifted into its place in the drying yard, and the form was then carefully
removed. A very slight blow in removing the form would destroy the pipe, and a considerable
number, especially of the larger sizes, collapsed in this way, and had to be remolded. To avoid
handling, the pipe was stacked on end a few feet from the place of mixing, the form being moved
as the yard filled with pipe. One crew of four men could make about 250 joints or 500 lin.
ft. of pipe a day.

As soon as hard enough, the pipe was turned end for end, and was then kept wet for several
weeks before being laid. The coating of neat cement on the inside was applied with a short
whitewash brush, and was a small item in the cost.

In laying, the trench was carefully finished to grade in order to have the joints close nicely,
and the ends were well wet with a brush. The mason then spread mortar, mixed 1 to 2, on the
end of the pipe, and laid a bed of mortar at the bottom of the joint. He then jammed the section
into place, and swabbed out the inside of the joint with a stiff brush, to insure a smooth
passage for the water. A band or ring of mortar was spread round the outside of the joint as
an additional reinforcement. One barrel of cement would joint about 300 sections of pipe. The
materials cost as follows: Portland cement, per bbl., $4.45; labor, per day, $2; foremen, per
day. $2.50 to $3; hauling, per load mile (1 cu. yd.), 20 cts.; sand, free at pit; water, free.

The pipe was all of a 1-4 sand and cement mortar, and the amount of cement in one foot of pipe
was arrived at by assuming that where the sand has voids in excess of the cement used, the
mortar will occupy 1.1 (see Chapter II) times the space of the dry sand, which yields the following
formula:

Where--

     c = cost per bbl. of cement, or $4.45.
     n = cu. ft. in one bbl. (taken at 3.5 here).
     s = ratio of sand to cement, or 4.
     d = inside diameter in inches.
     t = thickness of pipe in inches.
     l = length of pipe considered, or 1 ft. here.

Then:

                             c × l × [pi] × (dt + t²)
     Cement-cost per foot = --------------------------,
                                n × s × 1.1 × 144

         which gives here =

                4.45 × 1 × 3.142(dt + t²)
             -------------------------------   =  0.00631(dt + t²).
                  3.5 × 4 × 1.1 × 144

This gave the following cement costs per lineal foot:

Diameter, Thickness,    Cost
  ins.       ins.     per foot.
   6         1¼       $0.0571
   8         1¼        0.0730
  10         1-3/8     0.0998
  12         1½        0.1278

The sand cost was based on 15 cts. per cubic yard for loading, and a haul of two miles of 1
cu. yd. to the load, making five trips per day, at $4 for man and team. It bears a constant
ratio to cement cost, being 11.2 per cent. of the cement cost. The labor cost of making was
based on the foreman's estimate that a foreman, tamper, mortar mixer, and water man should
finish 250 joints a day of 6 or 8-in. pipe. For the 10 and 12-in. pipe, the labor was assumed
to be greater in proportion to the material. The foreman was taken at $3, one man at $2.50
and two at $2. The cement for painting the inside was neglected. Hauling the pipe to place
was taken at twice the cost of hauling the sand per mile, and a haul of 4 miles was assumed.
The cost of laying was based on a foreman's estimate of 2 cts. per foot for trench, and that
one man to lay, one man to plaster the joints, one helper and one man to back-fill would lay
600 ft. per day of 6 or 8-in. pipe. The larger sizes were assumed to cost more in proportion
to their material.

These various costs gave the following results for small size pipe:

                               --Cost per foot for--
           6-in.    8-in.   10-in.   12-in.
           pipe.    pipe.    pipe.    pipe.

Cement    $0.057   $0.073   $0.099   $0.128
Sand       0.006    0.008    0.011    0.014
Labor      0.019    0.019    0.026    0.034
Hauling    0.024    0.032    0.044    0.056
Laying     0.024    0.024    0.032    0.042
Trench     0.020    0.020    0.020    0.020
          ------   ------   ------   ------
Totals.   $0.15    $0.176   $0.232   $0.294

The above costs show that the pipe in place costs about twice as much as pipe in the yard,
even with cement at $4.45.

~MOLDED PIPE WATER MAIN, SWANSEA, ENGLAND.~--As a good example of foreign practice in molded
pipe conduit work a water main constructed at Swansea, England, has been selected. This pipe
line had to operate under a head of 185 ft.; it was constructed under the patents of the French
engineer, Mr. R. Bordenave, who has built many miles of the same type of conduit on the Continent.

Fig. 270 shows the construction of the pipe, the drawing being a part longitudinal section
through the shell at the joint. The pipe consists of an inner and an outer reinforcement separated
by a sheet steel tube and all embedded in a 1-2 mortar. Both inner and outer reinforcements
consists of longitudinal bins of cruciform (+) section wound by a spiral bar of the same section
wired to them at every intersection. Only the outer reinforcement and the steel tube are considered
in calculating the strength of the pipe, the inner reinforcement being considered as simply
supporting the mortar.

Fabrication of Reinforcement.--The steel tube is made of 1 mm. (0.04 in.) thick sheets of steel
bent to a cylinder and jointed longitudinally by welded butt joints, welded by a blow pipe
using acetylene and oxygen. Tests of this welded joint by R. H. Wyrill, Waterworks Engineer,
Swansea, showed it to be quite as strong as the unwelded steel cut from the shell. The circumferential
joints of the tube were made by turning up the edges of the sheets and welding them; this gives
a flexible watertight joint. The tube was made in lengths of 9 ft. 9½ ins. and its ends were
turned up all around; just back from the turned-up ends a vertical sheet steel collar was welded
to the tube to form a strip end for the external coating. These details are shown in Fig. 270.
When the tube for a length of pipe is completed the inside shell reinforcement previously made
is slipped into it and the outside shell reinforcement is formed on it as a mandril, as shown
by Fig. 271.

Molding.--When the three positions of the steel skeleton were completed, as shown by Fig. 271,
they were set on curved wooden curbs made to the exact shape necessary to center them and preserve
the correct thickness of cement coating. A collapsible core was lowered into position in the
inside, and a two-part sheet steel mold was erected outside; the space between core and mold
was then poured with a thin mortar of one part Portland cement to two parts clean river sand.
During the process of pouring, the outer steel mold is sharply struck with wooden mallets to
facilitate the escape of air bubbles. The mortar was mixed on an elevated traveling platform
which is shown in Fig. 272, which also shows a completed pipe, a core being withdrawn, a filled
mold and a section of reinforcement set up. The difficult feature of the molding process was
found to be the determination of the time for withdrawing the core and removing the exterior
mold; the time of setting of the mortar was different in warm and in cool weather and varied
with the wetness of the mixture, the brand of cement, etc. By using a single brand of cement
that ran very uniform in quality and time of setting it was possible, however, for the workmen,
after a little practice, to gage very accurately the correct time for removing the molds. With
four sets of molds a gang of eight men would curb 16 pipes per day under favorable conditions,
but when the temperature was low it was not possible to make more than six or eight pipes.
The pipes were allowed to stand four or five days after the removal of the mold; they could
then be removed by a crane and laid in stock until used. It was found advisable to let the
pipes age about four weeks before laying; by this time, it is stated, they would stand as much
rough usage as cast iron pipe.

Laying.--The pipes were laid much in the same way as cast-iron pipes are laid; they were each
9 ft. 9½ ins. long and weighed each about 12 cwt., and were handled by ordinary tackle. In
laying, the pipes were adjusted end to end and the joint enclosed by a temporary steel ring
inside which the bitumen seal, Fig. 270, was run and allowed to set when the steel ring was
removed. The joint was then encircled by a collar of similar construction to the pipe itself
and the space between collar and pipe was poured with cement mortar. About ten lengths of pipe
were laid per day by one gang of men, one jointer and his assistant making all the cement and
bitumen joints as fast as the gang could lay the pipes.

CHAPTER XXII.

METHODS AND COST OF CONSTRUCTING RESERVOIRS AND TANKS.

Floor, wall and roof work of structurally very simple character sum up the task of the constructor
in reservoir and tank construction. The only intricacy involved lies in form design and construction
for cylindrical tank work. Several examples of such work are given in this chapter, and in
each the construction and handling of the forms are described. To repeat details here would
serve no purpose, but one general instruction may be enunciated. No care is too great which
ensures rigidity and invariable form, both in the construction of the individual form units
and in the assembling of these units into the complete form. This is particularly true of cylindrical
tank work and especially high cylindrical tank work where the forms are moved upward as the
work progresses. To the designer it may be suggested that any beauty he may gain by giving
the walls of his standpipe a batter is paid in the extra cost of form work.

Concreting in tank work is expensive. The reasons are two. The work has to be done in a narrow
space, commonly pretty well filled with a network of steel rods or bars. Again the work has
to be done uniformly well, not only for appearance sake but because of the necessity of watertightness.
Making a reservoir watertight is, when all things are said, the one difficult constructional
task in tank work and the contractor who accepts the task lightly courts trouble. Exceptionally
good concreting is essential in tank work if watertightness is to be secured.

The illustration of these general admonitions will be found in the specific examples of tank
and reservoir work which follow.

~SMALL COVERED RESERVOIR.~--The reservoir was designed to hold 75,000 gallons of water for
fire purposes. As it is of a type which is certain to be frequently constructed and as we have
personal knowledge of the costs recorded we describe the work in some detail. The specifications
stipulated that the reservoir must be absolutely watertight and that the roof should be capable
of sustaining a load of 300 tons evenly distributed and a live load of 5,000 lbs. on two wheels.
Figure 273 shows a plan, Fig. 274 a longitudinal section, Fig. 275 a transverse section and
Fig. 276 the column construction.

Quantities of Work.--The excavation called for the removal of 579 cu. yds. of earth. There
were 83 cu. yds. of concrete in the structure, although the plans called for less, the additional
amount being used in increasing the two 4-in. walls to 6-in. and increasing the bottom and
top, on one end, so as to give perfect drainage. The yardage was divided as follows:

                                                  Cu. yds.
Footings                                               3.5
Columns                                                6.8
Sides                                                 22.6
Girders                                               11.0
Top                                                   20.0
Floor                                                 19.1
                                                      ----
      Total                                           83.0

A manhole had to be put in the top and a sump in the bottom. Several pipes also had to be placed
in the concrete. None of these details is shown on the plan. The structure had to be waterproofed.

Excavation.--The excavation was made with pick and shovel and the material hauled away in carts,
the distance to the dump being 700 ft. The top was shoveled directly into the carts, while
the rest was handled two and three times. When the reservoir was finished dirt had to be filled
in around the sides and puddled.

Wages.--The following rates of wages were paid on the job:

Foreman                                           $3.00 Carpenter                         
3.50 Carts and driver                                   3.50 Laborers                     
1.50

The carpenters worked 8 hours a day and were paid time and a half for overtime. The rest worked
ten hours per day and were paid regular rates for overtime.

Forms.--Carpenters framed and erected the forms, but laborers did all the carrying for them.
Laborers also tore down the forms. For the girders and columns 2-in. boards were used, but
for the sides 1-in. boards with 3×4-in. scantlings were used. The props for supporting the
girder and top forms were 3×4. Except for columns and girders and some props, all the forming
was used three times. The lumber cost:

400 ft. B. M. at $24      $ 9.60
8,000 ft. B. M. at $18    144.00
                         -------
  Total                  $153.60

This makes an average price per 1,000 ft. of about $18.30, which price we shall use in giving
costs.

The cost of framing and erecting the forms was $167.27 for the sides, columns, girders and
top. In the forms for the sides, forming was only used on one side of the concrete for two
sides, the earth bank being used for the other side of the forms, but on the other two sides
the banks had caved in, and forming was used on both sides of the wall. The cost per cubic
yard for forms was:

Lumber                     $2.54
Framing and erecting        2.77
Tearing down                 .54
                           -----
  Total                    $5.85

This cost is for the yardage of 60.4 on which forms were actually used. For the total yardage
in the tank the cost was:

Lumber                     $1.85
Framing and erecting        2.01
Tearing down                 .40
                           -----
  Total                    $4.26

The common labor cost of assisting to erect the forms was 15 per cent of the total. Nothing
is allowed for foreman, for the contractor acted as his own foreman.

The cost of forms per 1,000 ft. for the amount of lumber purchased was:

Lumber                    $18.30
Framing and erecting       19.90
Tearing down                4.00
                          ------
Total                     $42.20

As the lumber was used three times, the cost per thousand for all work and materials on the
forms would be just one-third of this--namely: $14.06.

Since the framing, erecting and tearing down cost $19.90 plus $4, or $23.90 per M. ft. B. M.
purchased, and since the lumber was used three times, the labor cost nearly $8 per M. each
time that the lumber was used. It will be noted that 8,400 ft. B. M. were required for the
83 cu. yds. of concrete, or a trifle more than 100 ft. B. M. per cubic yard.

It will be of interest to see the labor costs of forms for the various parts of the structure.

For the sides the cost of framing and erecting the forms was $4.19 per cubic yard. Of this
cost 4 per cent. was for common labor and the rest for carpenters. The tearing down cost 47
cts. per cubic yard. For the columns the erecting was $2.35, of which 1 per cent. was for common
labor. The tearing down cost 47 cts. For the girders and top the erecting cost $1.83, of which
35 per cent. was common labor. The tearing down cost 61 cts. per cubic yard. A summary would show:

                                          Girders
                      Sides     Columns     and
                       per        per     top per
                     cu. yd.    cu. yd.   cu. yd.
Framing and erecting   $4.19      $2.35    $1.83
Tearing down             .47        .47      .61
                       -----      -----    -----
  Total                $4.66      $2.82    $2.44

The greater cost of the columns forms over the girders and top was due to the fact that the
columns forms were handled almost exclusively by the carpenters, and also in setting them great
care and much time had to be used to get them plumb and in line. The cost of the forms for
the sides was about twice as great as that for the top and girders. The reasons for this are
evident. The walls had forms on both sides, while the top needed forming only underneath it,
the area covered on the forms being about 2,200 sq. ft. as compared to 1,000 sq. ft. The side
forms had to be set plumb and kept so. The framing was done ahead, but nearly half of the lumber
in the sides was erected as the concrete was being put in place. The forms for the top were
all put in place before any concreting was done on the top, and the carpenters discharged.
A much larger per cent. of common labor could be used in placing forms for top and girders
than on the sides. The props were nearly all put in place by laborers. The extra cost of tearing
down the forms for the top was due to the fact that the lumber all had to be handled one piece
at a time through a small manhole in the top, and carried about 150 ft. to be piled.

To all the costs for forming should be added 6 cts. per cubic yard for nails, wire and lines
used on the forms.

Concrete.--The mixtures varied for the different members. The cost of materials was as follows:

Cement, 110 bbls. @ $1.12           $123.20 ¾-in. stone, 80 cu. yds., @ $1.86    148.80 Gravel,
3 cu. yds., @ $1.33            4.00 Sand, 42 cu. yds., @ $1.20            50.40

The sides were first put in place, then the center columns were built, following which the
bottom was placed. Then the forms were erected for the top and the girders, and these cast.
In building the sides, one side and half of the two ends were built at one time, and then forms
erected for the other half of the sides. For the sides the mixing was done in the bottom of
the reservoir. For the rest of the structure it was done on the ground, the mixing board being
along side of the reservoir. The labor cost of the concrete work for the various members and
the average per cubic yard was as follows:

                                   Columns
                                     and
                           Sides.  Footings.  Bottom.  Girders.  Top.  Average.
Cubic yards                 22.6     10.3      19.1      11      20.0    83.
Preparing and cleaning up  $0.166   $0.060             $0.095           $0.065
Handling materials          1.022     .306    $0.070     .198   $0.187    .404

Handling steel               .890     .020               .395     .083    .324
                           ------   ------    ------   ------   ------  ------
Total                      $4.750   $1.654    $0.878   $2.000   $2.000  $2.450

The total cost of labor was $203.35. The mixing was done entirely by hand. Some plastering
was done to the walls after the forms were taken off, and the sides and bottom were washed
with a brush with cement and water. The plastering cost $6.60, including a barrel of cement
and the washing or grouting, two coats, cost $9.10, including a barrel of cement. This added
a cost of 19 cts. per cubic yard to the concrete work, making the total cost per cubic yard $2.65.

It was a mistake to have mixed the concrete for the sides in the bottom of the reservoir, as
it made two handlings of the materials and compelled all the concrete to be raised by hand
to place it in the forms. This accounts for the high cost of these two items.

The handling of the steel was high for the side walls, as it was all separated and put into
piles for the different panels and members in getting it out of the pile for the sides. The
rammers not only rammed the concrete but they also bent down the prongs of the steel to get
them in place in the narrow forms, and afterwards had to pull out these prongs. This had to
be done for every piece of steel used, and readily doubled the cost of ramming. The high cost
of ramming the top was caused by the fact that the 6 ins. of concrete had to be placed in three
layers and each rammed. The steel handling was high on account of the prongs entangling the
pieces with others, making them hard to handle. The cost of handling steel per ton was about
$4, or 0.2 ct. per pound. The steel was all handled by common laborers.

The stock piles of material had to be made along a street and alley and thus caused the material
to be handled in wheelbarrow several hundred feet.

The preparing to mix concrete, the cleaning up afterwards and the cleaning out of forms are
items that are seldom kept separate from the others.

The cost of mixing and placing is high, owing to the fact that working space was small and
the mixers had to wait until the concrete was taken off the board and placed in the forms before
starting another batch. This also meant an increased cost in the ramming, as the rammers were
idle some time waiting for a new batch to be mixed.

The total cost of concrete, including labor and materials, per cubic yard on a basis of the
83 cu. yds. was:

                               Per cu. yd.

Cement, 1-1/3 bbls., @ $1.12     $ 1.49
Stone, 1 cu. yd.                   1.86
Sand ½ cu. yd.                      .60
Steel                              4.76
Forms, 100 ft. B. M., @ $18.30     1.85
Labor on forms                     2.41
Labor on concrete and steel        2.65
                                 ------
  Total                          $15.62

The cost of a foreman is not included in this, as the contractor looked after the men himself.

Waterproofing.--The waterproofing of the structure proved a serious problem. It was thought
at first that the concrete itself would be nearly water tight, but the tank leaked like a sieve.
After considering several methods, an agent of a European waterproofing mixture prevailed upon
those interested to try his compound. To apply it, the walls had to be dry, so a large coal
burning stove was put in the reservoir and a fire kept up day and night. While this drying
process was going on several light falls of snow occurred, and this had to be cleared away
to make the walls and roof dry. Two coats of the mixture were applied according to the agent's
instructions, and the reservoir was tested. The water fell nearly half a foot in an hour's time.

Then a waterproofing contractor agreed to make the reservoir water tight with paper and tar,
by applying it on the inside. Three thicknesses of paper were laid on the bottom and run well
up on the sides, each layer of paper being well covered with a preparation of tar. Upon testing
it, it was found that the leaking had been reduced about 50 per cent. A preparation of asphalt
was then placed over this, but upon a third test the tank still leaked. As the sub-contractor
had verbally agreed to make it water tight for $125, only this amount was paid him. After this
last test he refused to do any more work.

After these attempts the sides of the reservoir were exposed on the outside by excavating around
it, and a one-brick-wall built up a few inches from the concrete. This space was filled in
with rich cement mortar and the ground once more filled in around the structure. This work
and the materials used in it cost $1,240. Upon a fourth test the reservoir was found to be
water tight. Thus more than a third of the cost of the entire work was in waterproofing the
structure, and this made the contract a money losing one, as this heavy cost was not anticipated.

Several items of miscellaneous work are listed in the total cost of the reservoir, such as
filling in and puddling around reservoir and replacing cobble paving. The top of the structure
was used as a bin for the storage of coal. For this purpose eight I-beams were embedded in
concrete around the top to be used as posts for the sides of the bin. The cost of placing these
is given.

~COVERED RESERVOIR, AT FORT MEADE, SOUTH DAKOTA.~--The following account of the method and
cost of constructing a 500,000-gallon reservoir is compiled from information furnished by Mr.
Samuel H. Lea, M. Am. Soc. C. E. As shown by Fig. 277, the reservoir consists of two equal
compartments, each 50×60 ft. inside dimensions, with rounded corners. Both compartments are
covered with a 3-in. slab roof carried on the walls and interior columns.

The concrete was a 1-2-4 Portland cement, sand and broken stone mixture, mixed by hand on a
movable platform. A concrete gang consisted of four men who were each paid $2.75 per day. They
wheeled the materials from the supply piles to the mixing platform, mixed the concrete and
deposited it in place. During the construction of the footings and floor two concrete gangs
were employed, but after the walls were started, one gang only was required for concrete work;
the other gang was then put to work assisting the carpenters.

The sand and stone were wheeled to the platform in iron wheelbarrows of 2½ cu. ft. capacity.
The cement was in ¼-bbl. sacks and each sack was taken as 1 cu. ft. Each batch of concrete
contained the following quantity of material:

2½ sacks of cement          2½ cu. ft. 2 wheelbarrows of sand        5 cu. ft. 4 wheelbarrows
of stone     10 cu. ft.

The quantities of sand and stone were adjusted so as to form the proper proportion for making
a dense concrete. From time to time, as the work progressed, experiments were made to determine
the percentage of voids both in the sand and the crushed stone; and, in this way, uniformity
in composition was secured. The mixture was made quite wet in order to insure a free flow around
the reinforcing bars. On account of the narrow space inside the forms and the number of reinforcing
bars therein care was taken to cause the mixture to be well distributed throughout. The wet
concrete was well spaded in an effort to secure a smooth surface next to the forms. This was
generally accomplished, but some rough places which showed after the removal of the forms required
patching up.

In constructing the footings some concrete was first deposited in place and the metal reinforcement
was embedded therein. For the floor reinforcement the lower bars were carefully embedded in
the concrete after it had been brought to a suitable height; the upper bars were then placed
crosswise upon the lower ones and kept in position until the remainder of the concrete had
been deposited around and over them. In the wall footings a depression or groove, several inches
deep, was left under the wall space for its entire length. This ensured a good bond between
the wall proper and the footing.

The concrete floor in each compartment was built in one continuous operation, the object being
to secure a practically monolithic construction. The lower reinforcing bars in the floor were
embedded at the proper depth in the fresh concrete and the upper bars were then placed crosswise
upon the lower ones; the two sets were then wired together at a sufficient number of places
to prevent displacement while the remaining concrete was being deposited around and over them.

The reinforcement for the walls and columns was erected in place upon the footings and formed
a steel skeleton around which the forms were erected. The upright bars in the walls were held
together and at the proper distance apart by means of templates consisting of wooden strips
in which holes were bored at suitable intervals to receive the bars. The templates were maintained
in a horizontal position and were moved upward as the concrete advanced in height. The horizontal
reinforcing bars were wired in place to the upright bars; they were placed in position ahead
of the concreting as the wall was built up.

The corrugated bars in beam and girders were placed in position in the forms and held up by
blocks which were removed as the forms were filled with concrete. The expanded metal reinforcement
for the roof slab was placed so as to be close to the lower face of the slab, but far enough
up to be entirely enveloped in the concrete.

The wall forms were made of 2-in. planks, surfaced on the inner side and placed horizontally
on edge. They were held in place by 4×4-in. posts spaced at intervals of about 4 ft., in pairs
on opposite sides of the wall. The posts were firmly braced on the outside; they were prevented
from spreading by connecting wires passing through the wall space between the edges of adjacent
planks. At the rounded corners of the reservoir the pairs of posts were spaced about two feet
apart and the curve was made by springing thin boards into place to fit the curve and nailing
them to the posts. The posts were high enough to reach to the top of the wall; the siding was
built up one plank at a time as the concrete work progressed. Column forms were made of 2-in.
planks on end, extending from floor to girder. Three sides were enclosed and one side was left
open to receive the concrete; this side was closed up as the concreting advanced in height.

The beam and girder forms were open troughs of the required dimensions, made of 2-in. plank,
surfaced on inner faces. The form of centering for the roof slab consisted of a smooth, tight
floor of 2-in. planks, extending between the open tops of column, beam and girder forms over
the entire area between enclosing walls of the reservoir. The centering and the beam and girder
forms were supported by 6×6-in. posts resting upon the floor below.

The regular carpenter gang consisted of a foreman carpenter at $5 per day, a carpenter at $3.50
per day, and two helpers at $2.75 per day. During the early concrete work of making footings
and floor, where forms were not required, the carpenter force was employed in erecting the
steel skeleton for the walls. The upright bars were placed in position and secured by temporary
wooden stays extending from the upper portion of bars to the surface of ground outside of excavation.
These stays were removed after concreting had advanced to a sufficient height to hold the steel
securely in place.

The wages paid the concrete gang which mixed and placed all the concrete and the carpenter
gang which constructed and erected the forms and placed the reinforcement have been given above.
The costs of construction materials on the site were:

Cement, per barrel            $2.57 Sand, per cu. yd.              1.80 Stone, per cu. yd.
3.15 Lumber, per M. ft. B. M.      27.50

The quantities in the completed concrete structure were as follows:

Total volume of concrete in reservoir                   704.71 cu. yds.
Total volume of steel reinforcement in reservoir.         5.57 cu. yds.
                                                        ------
Total volume of material in completed structure.        710.28 cu. yds.

The steel was, therefore, about 0.8%.

Volume of material in structure exclusive of roof slab     648.35 cu. yds.
Volume of material in roof slab                             61.93 cu. yds.
                                                           ------
  Total                                                    710.28 cu. yds.

The cost of the structure per cubic yard of concrete, exclusive of the roof slab, was as follows:

  Item.                          Per cu. yd.
Crushed stone                        $ 3.168
Sand                                    .842
Cement                                 3.859
Reinforcement                          4.959
Labor, mixing and placing concrete     1.721
Forms, labor and material              2.960
                                     -------
  Total                              $17.509

In constructing the roof slab the expanded metal reinforcement raised the unit cost. For this
portion of the work the costs were:

  Item.                        Per cu. yd.
Expanded metal reinforcement    $ 5.241
Other items, same as above       12.550
                                -------
Total                           $17.791

The floor and the inside surface of reservoir walls were covered with a coating of cement mortar
composed of one part Portland cement and one part sand. The wall plastering was from ½ in.
to ¾ in. thick; it was applied in two coats. The floor finish was laid in alternate strips
about 1 in. thick and 3 ft. wide. After the strips first laid had hardened the remaining strips
were laid, the edges being grouted to ensure tight joints.

The outside of walls and roof was covered with a coating of tar which was heated in an open
kettle to a temperature of about 360º F. and then applied with a brush or mop.

The cost of wall and floor plastering was 44.4 cts. per square yard, itemized as follows:

Cement      26.4 cts.
Sand         2.6 cts.
Labor       15.4 cts.
            -----
  Total     44.4 cts.

The cost of outside waterproofing was 4 cts. per square yard, distributed as follows:

Material    2.5 cts.
Labor       1.5 cts
            ---
  Total     4.0 cts.

While some of the cost items are apparently high when compared with the cost of similar work
in other places, it should be remembered that the isolated locality and the local conditions
were unfavorable for low cost. Owing to the isolated location of the reservoir with respect
to large markets and also to local sources of supply the cost of material and labor was quite
high. All construction material, except some of the stone for crushing, had to be hauled over
a mountain road from 3 to 4 miles to the top of the hill selected for the reservoir site. Labor
was scarce and commanded a wage of $2.50 per day for ordinary work; the laborers mixing concrete
were paid $2.75 per day. Another source of much relative expense was the high cost of lumber
and carpenter work on the forms. On account of the thinness of the walls and roof, the cost
of lumber and labor required per cubic yard of concrete was considerable. A part of the lumber
was used the second time in forms, but it was found impracticable to delay the work by waiting
for the concrete to harden before beginning the new portions of the walls. This lumber was
sold after the completion of the work, but the salvage was inconsiderable, amounting to less
than 10 per cent. of the original cost.

~CIRCULAR RESERVOIR, BLOOMINGTON, ILL.~--An open circular reinforced concrete reservoir was
constructed in 1905-6 for the water-works of Bloomington, Ill. This reservoir is 300 ft. in
diameter, 15 ft. deep at the circular wall and 25 ft. deep at the center of the spherical bottom.
The wall construction is shown clearly by Fig. 278, and the floor is a 6-in. spherical slab
reinforced by a mat of ¼-in. round rods placed 6 ins. on centers in both directions. The wall
reinforcement is corrugated bars. Neither the wall nor the bottom has expansion joints.

Concrete.--The specifications required not less than 1 part Portland cement to 2 parts sand
and 5 parts clean gravel, and stipulated that there should always be more than enough cement
to fill the voids in the sand more than enough mortar to fill the voids in the gravel. The
proportions were varied, depending on the character of the available material and on the location
the concrete was to occupy. The stipulations regarding the minimum quantities of cement and
mortar were, however, always at least fulfilled. A 1-3-4 mixture of cement, broken stone and
gravel was largely used in the footing and wall. The gravel was fine and contained 40 to 50%
of sand; the broken stone was the crusher-run, with the dust screened out, and the maximum-sized
pieces not larger than those which would pass a 2-in. screen. The mortar facing on the front
face of the wall was made of 1 part cement to 4 parts fine gravel, containing sand. Some gravel
from the excavation was used in the concrete for the floor. This gravel was so fine that about
one-quarter of it was replaced with broken stone and the mixture made 1-6. Both faces of the
wall were painted with a 1-1 mixture of cement and sand; the inner face was also painted with
a 1-1 mixture of waterproof Star Stettin Portland cement and sand. The sidewalk finish on the
surface of the floor consisted of 1-1½ mortar.

Mixing and Handling.--The concrete mixing plant was set up outside of the site of the reservoir
along a side track from the railroad. The concrete materials were delivered on the side track,
except some gravel from the excavation that was used. A Foote portable continuous mixer was
used in making the concrete for the wall footings and the wall. It was mounted so it could
discharge into dump cars on a service track laid on the ground. A double hopper was built up
over the mixer, one compartment for sand and one for broken stone. The end of a service track
leading from the side track was laid on an inclined trestle up to a floor level with the top
of this double hopper, the materials being hauled in dump cars from the side track to the hopper.
The service track from the mixer extended entirely around the wall, and 10 ft. from it, on
the embankment made there with earth from the trench for the wall-footing. The concrete was
dumped from the cars on the service track to portable shoveling platforms near the point where
work on the wall was in progress. It was shoveled by hand from these platforms to place in
the forms as the presence of the reinforcement bars in the narrow forms precluded dumping in
large quantities. The footing was built without forms up to the right-angle joint between it
and the base of the wall at the front, and to the top of the 45° slope on its rear face. A
layer of concrete 2.5 in. thick was first placed in the completed trench. The reinforcement
bars near the bottom were then laid on this green concrete, the vertical bars near the front
face of the wall usually being erected at the same time. The concrete in the toe of the footing
and in the footing proper up to the top layer of reinforcement was then laid. After the top
layer of reinforcing bars had been laid, the footing was completed, except for a top layer
about 2 ins. thick at the base of the front face of the wall and 15 ins. thick at the toe of
the footing. This left a strip of surface about 6 ft. wide, sloping at about 1 in 6 from the
wall toward the center of the reservoir, and furnished the widest and best possible bond for
the joint which had to be made when floor was laid.

Location and Construction of Forms and Wall.--The design of the wall of the reservoir, although
simple in itself, required unusually accurate work in the location and construction of the
forms for it. The location was made with very little difficulty, however, by an arrangement
devised by the contractor which enabled the foreman, without the aid of an engineer, to set
the necessary grade and reference stakes. A post, 10 ins. in diameter, was set very accurately
and firmly in the ground at the center of the reservoir. This post was sawed off squarely on
top so that the line of collimation of an engineer's transit set on it without a tripod would
be exactly at the grade of the top of the completed wall of the reservoir. A 200-ft. steel
tape was used to measure the radial distance from a nail in the center post to the posts of
the back, or outside forms for the wall. In the form for the back face of the wall 2×6-in.
posts, spaced one one-hundredth of the circumference apart, were set considerably in advance
of any concrete work, and were made the basis of all measurement in building the forms. The
forms as originally planned are shown in Fig. 278.

The wall, when started, was built continuously in both directions from the starting point.
The back forms consisted of planks for lagging nailed to vertical posts, which were accurately
set and firmly braced. The front forms were made in lengths equal to one one-hundredth of the
circumference of the reservoir, and when set up were fastened to the back forms. Twenty-one
of these front form sections were built and all set up at once. Concrete was filled in between
the front and back forms, starting at the central form, and was rammed in inclined layers,
sloping, at about 1 on 6, both ways towards the end forms. This method was adopted in order
that the concrete might be laid continuously and without joints. The lagging of 1-in. boards
on the vertical portion of the sections was nailed to the vertical posts, and was carried up
just ahead of the concrete filling.

When the concrete had reached the top of the central one of the 21 sections of the forms, and
the concrete in that section had set sufficiently, the section was broken up and removed, leaving
two sets of 10 sections of the forms. Subsequently the other forms could be removed in turn
as desired without being broken up. As the filling-in proceeded between the two sets of 10
forms each, the form in each set nearest the starting point was removed, carried forward, and
put in place at the other end of its set of forms. Twelve men were required to take down and
transport one of the front form sections.

In setting up a front form, its inner toe was firmly supported by a stake driven into the ground
and by the horizontal board, nailed transversely under the bottom 4×4-in. horizontal stringers,
which rested on the ground. The upper part of the form was then securely fastened to the 2×6-in.
posts of the back forms by temporary wooden connecting strips, which were removed as the concrete
filling was carried up. The sections of the front forms were also securely tied to each other.

A facing of gravel concrete, rich in cement and with no pebbles larger than ½-in. was placed
on the front face of the wall, extending from the back edges of the vertical reinforcing bars
to the surface. A sheet-iron plate, about 8 ins. wide by 5 ft. long, was placed vertically
just back of those bars. The concrete was shoveled in loose to the top of these iron plates,
and then the mortar was poured in between the latter and the front face forms from buckets.
The iron plates were next drawn by handles attached to them, and the mortar and concrete tamped
together before either had set. In making joints, the old concrete surfaces were always brushed
and wet down, and, if necessary slushed with a grout of neat cement before new concrete was
laid on them.

Construction of Floor.--The excavation over the site of the reservoir floor was brought accurately
to grade 6 ins. below the surface of the finished concrete by hand after the scoop-bucket excavator
had passed over. In making the excavation the levels were given on radial lines drawn from
the ends of the 10-ft. sections of the wall to the center. A rod, on which the elevations of
the sub-grade at every 10 ft. from the wall to the center of the reservoir were clearly marked,
was used in connection with a transit on the center post in locating the elevations of different
points in the reservoir floor. By using this method the elevations required were easily found
by the foreman in charge without the assistance of an engineer. When the work approached the
center, the post was removed and the transit was placed on a portable pedestal which was set
on points of known elevation on the finished concrete.

The slanting surface left on the top of the footing inside the wall formed, together with the
projecting reinforcement rods, an excellent bond between the concrete of the wall and that
of the floor, when the latter was laid. A circular strip of the floor, 16 ft. wide, was put
down next to the wall first, and the remainder of the floor was laid according to the progress
of the excavation. The lower 3½ ins, of the concrete was usually first spread out over an area
12 or 16 ft. square, then the reinforcement was placed, and after that the top 2 ins. of concrete
and a ½-in. sidewalk finish surface were laid.

The ¼-in. rods in the bottom are 6-ins. on centers in both directions. They were in 12 and
16-ft. lengths and were partly woven together in mats before being placed. The rods in one
direction were all laid out and woven with four or five of those in the other direction, the
joints being tied with small wire. The remaining cross rods were laid after the mat had been
placed. The mats were overlapped 1 ft. This method of placing proved economical and efficient,
giving at the same time something permanent on which to lay the remaining concrete.

~STANDPIPE AT ATTLEBOROUGH, MASS.~--The stand pipe was 50 ft. in diameter and 106 ft. high
inside, with walls 18 ins. thick at the bottom and 8 ins. thick at the top. Figure 279 shows
the general arrangement of the reinforcement. Round bars of 0.4 carbon steel were used; the
bars came in 56½-ft. lengths, so that three lengths with laps of 30 ins., made a complete ring
around the tank. The concrete was a 1-2-4 mixture of ¼ to 1½-in. broken stone with screenings
used as portion of sand.

The floor was built first, and on it was erected a tower to a height of 60 ft. and a derrick
with a 40-ft. boom was set on its top. The derrick was operated by an engine on the ground
which also had a revolving gear attached. When the work had reached the top of this tower,
the tower was raised to 110 ft. in height and the derrick shifted to the new elevation. The
forms were convex and concave sections 7½ ft. high and about 11 ft. long. The concave or outside
forms were made in 16 panels, with horizontal ribs and vertical lagging; two complete rings
of panels were used. The panels were joined into a ring by clamps across the joints, this clamping
action and the friction of the concrete holding them in place. The inside forms consisted of
vertical ribs carrying horizontal lagging put in place a piece at a time as the filling proceeded.
They were supported by staging from the derrick tower. The remaining plant comprised a Sturtevant
roll jaw crusher feeding to screens which discharged fines below ¼-in. into one bin, medium
stone into another bin and coarse stone into a third bin. These bins fed to the measuring hopper
of a Smith mixer, which discharged into the derrick bucket.

The mode of procedure was as follows: The reinforcing rings were erected to a height of 7½
ft. The bars were bent by being pulled through a tire binder and around a curved templet by
a steam engine. The bending gave some trouble, due, it was thought, to the stiffness of the
high carbon steel. Vertical channels 4 ins. deep were set with webs in radial planes or across
wall at four points in the circumference. The flanges of these channels were punched exactly
to the vertical spacing of the reinforcing rings. Through the punched holes were passed short
bars on the opposite ends of which the reinforcing rings were supported and wired. The three
sections of rod of which each ring was composed, were lapped 30 ins. and connected by Crosby
clips. Considerable difficulty was had in holding the reinforcing rings in line by the method
employed; it is stated by the engineer that a greater number than four channels would have
been much better.

The reinforcement being in place, an inside and an outside ring of forms was erected. Concreting
was then carried on simultaneously from four points on the circumference and a ring 7½ ft.
high was concreted in one operation. Several facts were brought out in the concreting; careful
and conscientious spading was necessary to get a smooth dense surface; a too wet mixture allowed
the stone to settle and segregate; care was necessary in this thin wall containing two rings
of bars to keep the stone from wedging among and around the bars and thus causing voids. The
engineer states that for this reason the substitution of mortar for concrete in tank walls
is worth considering. He estimates that in this work, costing $35,000, that the use of a 1-2
mortar in place of the 1-2-4 concrete would have increased the cost by $2,300, a 1-2½ mortar
by $1,500, and a 1-3 mortar by $750. It was also found that there was danger from a movement
of the reinforcement in the concrete and of the forms in placing the concrete.

When a ring of wall 7½ ft. high had been concreted, the reinforcement was placed as before
described for another ring. The two rings of forms below those just filled were removed from
the wall, hoisted up and set in place on top. These two operations of placing reinforcement
and setting forms for another ring of wall took three days, so that the top surface of the
wall to which new concrete was to be added, had become hard. This hard surface was very thoroughly
washed and then coated with neat cement immediately before depositing the fresh concrete. Water
was admitted to the tank as the work progressed, being kept about 20 ft. below the work in
progress. Numerous small leaks developed, but only two were large enough for the water to squirt
beyond the face of the wall. These leaks appeared to grow smaller as time went on. To do away
with them entirely, the inside wall was plastered. The first coat of plaster was not successful
in stopping the leaks, so the standpipe was emptied and replastered, five coats being used
in the lower 20 ft. This did not serve so resort was had to a Sylvester wash. A boiling hot
solution of 12 ozs. to the gallon of water of pure olive oil castile soap was applied to the
dry wall. In 24 hours this was followed with a 2 ozs. to the gallon solution of alum applied
at normal temperature. Four coats of each solution were applied, which reduced the leakage
to a small amount. To do away with all leakage another four-coat application of Sylvester wash
was used.

Details of the cost of the work are not available. There were 770 cu. yds. of concrete in the
walls and 185 tons of steel bars. Altogether 3,000 Crosby clips, costing $1,100 were used.
The cost of the concrete in place was about as follows:

Cement, per cu. yd. of concrete          $ 4.80
Sand and stone, per cu. yd. of concrete    3.90
Mixing, per cu. yd. of concrete            0.40
Placing, per cu. yd. of concrete           2.20
Forms, per cu. yd. of concrete             2.65
                                         ------
  Total per cu. yd. of concrete          $13.95

~GAS HOLDER TANK, DES MOINES, IOWA.~--The tank was 84 ft. in diameter and 21 ft. 5 ins. deep.
It had a horizontal floor 16 ins. thick 5 ft. below ground level and a wall 21 ft. high, 18
ins. thick at base and 12 ins. thick at top under coping and with alternate pilasters and piers
around the outside. The concrete for the floor was a 1-2½-5 2-in. stone mixture and the concrete
for the walls was a 1-2-4 1-in. stone mixture. The floor was constructed first, with a circular
channel for the wall footing, and then the wall was constructed.

Piles were driven in the bottom and their heads cut to level and filled around with tamped
cinders. Two circumferential rows of posts were driven around the edge so that a pair of posts,
one inner and one outer, came on each radius through a wall pilaster or pier. These posts served
primarily to carry the frames for the wall forms and secondarily for holding the forms for
the circular wall footing channel as shown by the sketch Fig. 280. The floor concrete was put
in in diamond-shaped panels between forms, whose top edges were set to floor level. Each form
was designed to make a groove in the edge of the slab so that adjacent slabs would bond with
it. The concrete was wheeled to place in barrows, thoroughly tamped, roughly floated to surface
and finally given a trowel finish.

To construct the walls, the posts before mentioned, were cut off to exact level 6 ins. above
the finished floor. A bent for the wall forms was then erected on each radial pair as shown
by Fig. 281. The bents were erected by hand and carefully plumbed and lined up, both radially
and circumferentially. The pier and pilaster forms were then erected across wall opposite each
bent as shown by Fig. 281. The forms for the wall between pilasters and piers consisted of
panels 4 ft. high.

A panel for the inner face of the wall is shown by Fig. 282, the panel for the outer face was
similar in construction but was, of course, concave instead of convex. Enough panels of each
kind were made to reach entirely around the tank. The inside panels were bolted at the ends
to the uprights of the bents; the outside panels were similarly lag screwed to the uprights
of the pier and pilaster forms; Fig. 281 shows the holes for bolts and lag screws. The spaces
between ends of inside panels in front of the bents was closed by a ½×6-in. steel plate the
full height of the wall; this plate was bolted to the bents and had anchor bolts every 3 ft.,
reaching into the wall. This anchoring of the plate to the wall permitted the diagonal bracing
of the bents to be removed to allow runways to be laid on the cross-pieces, since the plate
held firmly the bent post to which it was bolted as indicated by Fig. 283. A complete circle
of inside and outside forms was erected and filled, then the forms were raised 3 ft. by block
and tackle from cross timbers across wall between bent and pilaster form, and this depth concreted
and the forms raised again. The forms were oiled on the faces coming against the concrete.
It took about half a day to raise and set a complete circle of forms. The concrete was mixed
outside the tank and was wheeled up inclines and dumped onto runways laid on the cross pieces
of the bents and then loaded and wheeled to place. The runway was raised to successive horizontals
as the work progressed.

Only a few general cost figures are available. The labor for mixing and placing concrete was
as follows:

For floor, per cu. yd.      3.4 hrs. For walls, per cu. yd.      5.2 hrs. For cornice, per
cu. yd.    5.4 hrs.

The cost of unloading the reinforcing steel from cars and placing it in the structure was $7
per ton, or 0.35 ct. per lb. The cost of form lumber, framing, erecting and taking down forms
was 9 cts. per square foot of wall covered.

~GAS HOLDER TANK, NEW YORK CITY.~--The tank for the Central Union Gas Co.'s gas holder at 136th
St. and Locust Ave. has an interior diameter of 189 ft. and a depth of 41 ft. 6 ins. The exterior
wall is 42 ft. 6 ins. deep, 5 ft. 6 ins. thick at the base and 4 ft. 6 ins. thick at the top;
concentric with it and 11 ft. 6 in. away is the interior wall 166 ft. in external diameter
and 16 ft. 6 ins. high with a uniform thickness of 2 ft. 6 ins. The bottom of the tank enclosed
by the interior wall is a truncated cone whose base is at the level of the wall top. Fig. 284
shows the arrangement.

It was specified that the diameter of this tank should not vary more than 2 ins. and that the
exterior wall should not vary more than 1 in. from the vertical. The main form was a circular
drum whose exterior face formed the inner face of the main wall. Its framework consisted of
40 vertical trusses or radial frames 6 ft. deep and 42 ft. high set equidistant around the
tank, these trusses being braced together on both edges by circumferential timbers. Radial
horizontal pieces nailed across the radial frames and projecting beyond their faces carried
vertical iron guide strips against which the movable panels of lagging were seated. These panels
were cylindrical segments 5 ft. high and long enough to span between two radial frames or 14
ft. 11-5/8 ins. The panels were adjusted radially by wedges to give 1/8 in. clearance in respect
to inner face of wall; enough of them were made to form a complete circle and they were set
with 1-in. clearance between vertical edges of adjacent panels to allow for swelling when wetted.

The concrete bottom of the annular space between walls was first constructed. On this floor
were set 6×6-in.×8-ft. sills for the radial frames; these were located accurately by transit.
The radial frames were then set on the sills by a derrick, adjusted to exact radial position
by a measuring wire swiveled to the center point of the tank and plumbed by transit. A complete
circle of lagging panels was then adjusted to the frames at the bottom of the trench. For concreting,
the wall was divided circumferentially into three sections. These sections were separately
concreted to the top of the lagging panels, that is to a height of 5 ft. After the concrete
had set 48 hours the panels were hoisted 4 ft., so that their lower edges still overlapped
the concrete 12 ins., and another ring of wall was concreted. This procedure was repeated until
the wall was completed. The back of the wall was formed against the side of the trench where
possible and in other places against rough board lagging held in position in any convenient way.

For handling the concrete, four equidistant panels of the form framework were converted into
double compartment elevator shafts providing for two balanced cars controlled by a sheave provided
with a friction brake. Three mixers supplied concrete to these elevators. Considering a single
elevator, two barrows of concrete were wheeled from the mixer onto the car at the top of the
elevator frame, the friction brake was released and the loaded car descended to the work hoisting
at the same time its twin car loaded with two empty barrows. The elevators distributed to wheeling
platforms cantilevered out from the outer face of the framework and located successively 5
ft., 15 ft., 20 ft., etc., above the bottom of the trench. On these platforms the concrete
was distributed as required, the maximum wheeling distance being never over one-eighth the
circumference of the tank. The concrete was mixed very wet and deposited in 6-in. layers.

The inner and outer surfaces of the wall were both painted with two coats of stiff cement grout
neat, and in addition the inner surface was rubbed smooth by carborundum brick. Regarding this
finishing work Mr. Howard Bruce, Engineer of Construction, writes:

"The scouring was done on each section of the wall immediately after the forms supporting these
sections had been removed. The object was to rub this interior surface with carborundum before
the surface of the concrete had taken its final set. By rubbing the concrete at this stage
and at the same time applying with a brush a coating of neat cement grout, we believe the face
of the concrete was made more or less impermeable, as examination shows the pores of the concrete
are very largely filled up. We have no accurate figures as to the cost per square yard of this
treatment, but one can readily see that this cost would be insignificant as compared with the
possible improvement of the work. The carborundum brick was selected on account of its hardness.
I believe practically any stone would answer the same purpose. In addition to filling the pores
of the concrete, this treatment gives the surface a good smooth finish."

~LINING A RESERVOIR, QUINCY, MASS.~--The following methods and costs are given by Mr. C. M.
Saville, M. Am. Soc. C. E., for lining the Forbes Hill Reservoir at Quincy, Mass. This reservoir
is 100×280 ft. on the floor, with side slopes of 1 on 1.75, and was built by contract in 1900-1901.

Figure 285 is a section of the concrete lining; the bottom layer for the floor was a 1-2-5
natural cement concrete, and for the sides a 1-2½-6½ Portland cement concrete; the top layer
on both floor and sides was a 1-2½-4 Portland cement concrete; 2½-in. stone was the maximum
size allowed in any concrete and 1½-in. the maximum allowed in the top layer. Smaller stone
was used for special surface work, as noted further on. The stone was cobbles turned up in
the excavation work and had to be gathered from scattered piles and washed before crushing.
A 9×15 Farrel crusher, operated by a 12 HP. engine did the crushing; it was rated at 125 tons
a day, but averaged only about 40 tons. The fine dust was screened out and the remainder discharged
into a 30-cu. yd., three-compartment bin, one compartment for stone less than 1½ ins., another
for 1½ to 2½-in. stone and a third for returns. The stone had 46 per cent. voids and weighed
95 lbs. per cu. ft. The sand was of excellent quality. Atlas and Beach's Portland and Hoffman
natural cement were used.

All concrete was mixed and placed by hand, the concrete gang consisting generally of 1 sub-foreman,
2 men measuring materials, 2 men mixing mortar, 3 men turning concrete three times, 3 men wheeling
concrete, 1 man placing concrete and 2 men ramming concrete. Two gangs were ordinarily employed,
each mixing and placing about 20 cu. yds. per day, or 1.43 cu. yds. per man per day. The materials
(sand and stone) were measured in bottomless boxes, the following sizes being used:

                     --Sand Box--                --Stone Box--

Prop. of Mix.    Size.      Vol. cu. ft.       Size.     Vol. cu. ft.

18.5 1-2½-6½        2'9"×2'×1'8"       9.25        5'×7'2½"        24.05

[Footnote H: These mixtures were used for gate house and standpipe foundation work.]

The bottom layer was placed in a continuous sheet; the top layer was laid in 10-ft. squares
on the floor and in 8×10-ft. squares on the sides; these squares alternated in both directions,
one-half being first laid and allowed to set. In laying the sides the surface was left 1 in.
low and then before the concrete had set was brought to plane by a 1-in. layer of 1-2½-4 mixture
using stone and stone dust less than 3/8 in. The concrete for the floor was mixed rather wet
and rammed until it quaked; on the sides a drier mixture was necessary to prevent flow. The

The side finish with 1-2½-4 concrete of 3/8-in. stone cost $0.154 per sq. yd. 1 in. thick.
This work was done by a gang of 3 plasterers and 3 helpers.

The layer of plaster between the concrete layers was put down on 4-ft. strips and finished
similarly to the surface of a granolithic walk. This layer consisted of 1-2 mortar finished
with a 4-1 mortar. To keep the plaster from cracking it was covered with strips of coarse burlap
soaked in water; this precaution was not entirely successful, some cracks appeared and had
to be grouted. Three gangs, each consisting of 1 plasterer and 1 helper, did the plastering,
each gang laying about 700 sq. yds. per day. The cost of the plaster layer was as follows:

  Item.         Per 100 sq. ft.   Per sq. yd.   Per cu. yd.

It will be noted that it took over 5 bbls. of cement per cubic yard, and that the labor cost
was $6 per cubic yard.

~RELINING A RESERVOIR, CHELSEA, MASS.~--The following account of relining the Powder Horn Hill
Reservoir at Chelsea, Mass., is taken from a paper by Mr. C. M. Saville. This reservoir which
holds about 1,000,000 gallons is oval in shape, 98×175 ft. at the top, 68×148 ft. at the bottom
and 15 ft. deep, with side slopes about 1 on 1. The work was done by day labor. For sake of
completeness the costs of excavation and back-filling are given here as well as the concrete costs.

The top of the bank was too narrow to allow the use of carts and an 18-in. gage railroad was
decided upon as most convenient for handling materials. A 65-ft. boom derrick with a 70-ft.
mast was used for removing the excavated material and for depositing concrete. The derrick
was operated by a 15-h.p. double drum hoisting engine, was held in place by six wire guy ropes,
and had a reach such that only one moving was necessary after it was placed. The engine and
derrick were set up on the floor of the reservoir, and the work of excavation was begun at
about the middle of the south side. In order to facilitate the work, a platform supported on
A frames was set up. These frames were spaced about 15 ft. apart and rested on the bottom and
slope of the reservoir, being held in place by bolts driven into the floor.

The paving blocks on the top of the slope were removed and piled up to be taken away. The old
lining and the material excavated from the bank were shoveled into the scale pan of the derrick,
hoisted to the cars on the top of the bank, and then run by gravity to a dump a short distance
down the hillside. Here the cars were run out on a rough trestle, the load dumped, and the
empties hauled back to the work by a rope carried through pulleys to the winch head on the
hoisting drum of the engine.

For the storage of some of the materials, two small portable storehouses were set up--one 8×10×7
ft., the other 11×16 x 7 ft. The bulky portions, such as cement, sand, and stone, were delivered
as necessary, a few days' supply only being kept on hand. A branch from the railroad was so
arranged that it passed the storehouses and stone piles, while the sand was piled close to
the concrete mixing board. The intention on the work was to do nothing by hand that could possibly
be done by steam, except that all of the concrete was mixed by hand. As great a proportion
of water was used as could be done without causing the material to slide when rammed in place.

The lower layer of concrete was of the proportion by volume of 1 cement, 2½ sand, and 6½ crushed
stone (sizes from ¾ to 1½ ins.). This was rather a lean mixture, and as it could not be rammed
enough to flush all over, the surface was finished where necessary by a thick mortar made in
the proportion of 1 cement to 6 sand, and applied with heavy brushes. Before placing any of
the concrete, the bank back of the old concrete left in place was thoroughly rammed with iron
railroad tampers, and the edge of the old concrete was scrubbed with water and a stiff brush
and then coated with 1 to 4 grout, which was allowed to fill in the angle between the concrete
and the slope. Just before placing the concrete the earth bank was well wet in order that moisture
might not be drawn from the concrete while it was soft.

In order to make the new lining as waterproof as possible, a layer of asphalt was placed on
top of the lower layer of concrete and brought up on the exposed edge of the old layer at the
bottom of the new work. This, it was expected would make an elastic and watertight joint between
the new and the old work.

Venezuela asphalt, "Crystal Brand," was used, being poured upon the top of the concrete layer
and allowed to run down the slope, care being taken that the concrete was entirely and perfectly
covered. After the first layer of asphalt was cool, a second layer was similarly applied, and
the resulting sheet was about ¼ in. thick. Any inclination to crawl down the slope when exposed
to the sun was readily stopped by throwing on a pailful of cold water. A most particular part
of this work was to get the asphalt as hot and liquid as possible and yet not burn it. All
of the concrete was protected from the sun and kept damp by being covered with strips of burlap,
which were moistened by sprinkling.

The upper layer of concrete was composed of a much richer mixture of concrete than that used
in the bottom layer, the proportions by volume being 1 cement, 1¼ sand, 1¼ stone dust, and
4 broken stone of the sizes mentioned above. On account of the steep slope it was possible
to do only a little ramming, and the material was laid as wet as possible. To make this layer
more impervious and also to obtain a smooth surface, the concrete was left about an inch below
and a finish coat applied by expert granolithic finishers. This coating was applied as soon
as it was possible to do so after the main layer was in place, but on account of the steepness
and the liability of the wet concrete to flow, care had to be taken not to begin work too soon.

The top finishing coat was made in the proportion of 1 part cement, 1-2/3 part sand, and 3-1/3
parts stone dust. In order to help in bonding, the last ramming on the concrete was done with
rammers studded with pieces of iron about 1 in. long and ½ in. deep.

The finishing was done in three operations: The material was spread on the concrete and thoroughly
worked into it by the finishers, using rough wooden floats; after this it was gone over and
partially smoothed down with a thin steel float; and finally it was worked to give the finished
appearance and an impervious surface.

The under layer of concrete was placed in a continuous sheet. The upper layer was put down
in alternate strips, 10 ft, long (the whole length of the layer) and 5 ft. wide. These blocks
were built up in forms, which were not removed until the concrete had set. Finally, the back
or edge of the block toward the bank was well wet and thoroughly plastered, to prevent, as
far as possible, the infiltration of any water. The plaster was mixed in the proportion of
1 part cement to 4 parts sand. When the forms were wholly removed, the space between the concrete
and the bank was refilled, to within about 6 ins. of the top, with a clayey material previously
excavated, and the space was filled and graded to the top of the bank with loam. During the
work two holidays intervened; the men were also transported to and from the work. Charges were
made for these items, amounting to $209.77, and this sum, together with the cost of installing
the plant ($716.03) are proportionally charged against the work as follows:

                            Per cent.   Total.   Per cu. yd.

~LINING JEROME PARK RESERVOIR.~--The bottom of the reservoir that was lined covered 250 acres,
and the concrete lining was 6 ins. thick. The lining was laid in alternate strips 16 ft. wide
between forms set to grade. The concrete was mixed in 18 Ransome mixers provided with charging
hoppers and mounted on trucks without boilers. Steam was supplied to the mixer engines from
the boilers of the contractor's locomotives. One locomotive supplied steam for three or four
mixers. Tracks were laid in parallel lines across the reservoir bottom from 150 to 200 ft.
apart. Sand and stone were hauled in on these tracks. The sand was dumped in stock piles at
intervals; the stone was shoveled from the cars directly into the charging hopper and the sand
was delivered by wheelbarrows to the same hopper. Four men shoveled the stone for each mixer.
To deliver the concrete from the mixer to the work required six men with wheelbarrows. Two
men leveled off the concrete discharged by the barrows and two other men floated the surface
by means of a straight-edge spanning the 16-ft. strips and riding on the forms. By using a
wet but not sloppy concrete and moving the straight-edge back and forth a good surface was
secured. The gang mixing and placing consisted of 20 men for each mixer and 18 gangs laid approximately
1½ acres per 10-hour day. The gang organization and wages were as follows:

   Item.                                          Per 10 hours.
4 men shoveling stone at $1.50                       $ 6.00

      Total per day                                  $33.00

These costs do not include the fraction of a day's labor for fireman or the cost of fuel.

~RESERVOIR FLOOR, CANTON, ILL.~--The following costs are given by Mr. G. W. Chandler for lining
the bottom of a 160×80-ft. reservoir with corners of 20-ft. radius and vertical brick sidewalls.
A 1-3½-7½ crushed stone concrete was used; it was mixed by hand in batches of 2.7 cu. ft. cement,
9 cu. ft. sand and 20¼ cu. ft. stone. The sand and stone were measured separately, the sand
and cement mixed dry, then shoveled into a pile with the rock, well wetted, shoveled over again
and then shoveled into wheelbarrows. The stone had 40 per cent. voids and the sand 30 per cent.
voids. The lining was 10 ins. thick including a ¾-in. coat of 1-2¼ mortar spread and worked
smooth with a trowel. The cost per cubic yard of the lining in place was as follows:

0.856 bbl. cement at $2.50                            $2.14
10.1 bu. sand (100 lbs. per bu.) at 5¾ cts             0.58
0.857 cu-yd-stone at $2.17                             1.86

                                                      -----
      Total                                           $5.38

~RESERVOIR FLOOR, PITTSBURG, PA.~--The following methods and costs of laying a reservoir floor
are given by Mr. Emile Low, M. Am. Soc. C. E., for the Hiland Reservoir constructed at Pittsburg,
Pa., in 1884, by contract. There were 7,681 cu. yds. of concrete in the floor which was 5 ins.
thick and laid on a clay puddle foundation.

Natural cement costing $1.35 per barrel was used. The broken stone varied in weight from 147
to 152 lbs. per cu. ft.; it was quarried and hauled 20 miles by rail and then unloaded into
small cars and hauled ½ mile to the reservoir. The cost of the stone per cubic yard delivered was:

Quarrying, per cu. yd.                                  $0.45 Breaking, per cu. yd.       
0.35 Transporting, per cu. yd.                                0.50

        Total                                           $1.30

The sand was obtained on the site at the cost of excavation, or 1¼ cts. per bushel.

The method of proportioning and mixing the concrete was as follows: Platforms 10×16 ft. of
2-in. plank were laid on the puddle foundation and by these were set 5×4×1½-ft. boxes on legs.
Into these boxes 1 bbl. of cement and 2 bbls. of sand were emptied and thoroughly mixed dry,
then mixed with water to a thin grout. Five barrels of stone were placed on the platform and
thoroughly wetted; the grout was then emptied over the stone and the two turned over three
times with shovels. The concrete was rammed until the mortar flushed to the surface. The following
costs cover various periods as follows:

  Two Days Work (101 cu. yds.):         Total.   Per cu. yd.

~CONSTRUCTING A SILO.~--The form construction shown in Fig. 286 was employed in building a
silo 28 ft. high, 22 ft. 3 ins. interior diameter, and having 6-in. walls. The bottom of the
silo was made 9 ins. thick and set 2 ft. below the surface. The reinforcement consisted of
ten 2½×3/16-in. rings spaced equally in the lower half and of woven wire fencing in the upper
half. The iron rings were hoops removed from an old wooden silo. The concrete was a 1-6 mixture
of Portland cement and sandy gravel. Figure 286 is a section through the forms. There were
twenty T-shaped posts, which extended perpendicularly from the ground to a height of 28 ft.,
being secured at top and bottom by a system of guy ropes and posts. The rings, of which there
are four, two inside and two outside, were built of weather boards with their edges reversed.
Four thicknesses of board were used in each ring. The curbing consisted of 2×8-in. sticks 4
ft. long. Wedges driven between the vertical posts and the rings held the latter in place.
When the forms were to be removed the wedges were knocked out and the rings sprung enough to
permit the removal of the curbing. The rings were then pushed up and fastened in place for
another section. The average rate of progress was one 4-ft. section per day. The forms were
filled in the afternoon and moved up the following forenoon. Five-foot sections could have
been built just as readily.

The work was all done by farm laborers hired by the month and 100 man-days of such labor were
required, excluding seven days work of a mason brushing and troweling the surface. The cost
of the work, not including the old hoop iron or the old lumber used in forms, was as follows:

  Item.                          Total.  Per cu. yd.
Cement                          $100.00        $2.62
Gravel and sand                   35.00         0.92
1 20-rod roll of fencing           5.20         0.01
New lumber                        18.00         0.47
100 days labor at $1.75          175.00         4.60
7 days mason troweling at $3.50   24.50         0.64
                                -------        -----
  Total, 38.2 cu. yds.          $357.70        $9.26

The external area of the silo is 1,950 sq. ft., which makes the cost of brushing and troweling
1¼ cts. per sq. ft. There were about 2,300 ft. B. M. of lumber used in the forms, or about
61 ft. B. M. per cu. yd. of concrete.

~GROINED ARCH RESERVOIR ROOF.~--The following data are given by Mr. Allen Hazen and Mr. William
B. Fuller, in Trans. Am. Soc. C. E. 1904. The concrete was mixed in 5-ft. cubical mixers in
batches of 1.6 cu. yds. at the rate of 200 cu. yds. per mixer day. One barrel of cement, 380
lbs. net, assumed to be 3.8 cu. ft., was mixed with three volumes of sand weighing 90 lbs.
per cu. ft., and five volumes of gravel weighing 100 lbs. per cu. ft. and having 40 per cent
voids. On the average 1.26 bbls. of cement were required per cu. yd. The conveying plant consisted
of two trestles (each 900 ft. long) 730 ft. apart, supporting four cableways. The cables were
attached to carriages, which ran on I-beams on the top of the trestles. Rope drives were used
to shift the cableways along the trestle. Three-ton loads were handled in each skip. The installation
of this plant was slow, and its carrying capacity was less than expected. It was found best
to deliver the skips of concrete to the cableway on small railway track, although the original
plan had been to move the cableways horizontally along the trestle at the same time that the
skip was traveling.

The cost of mixing and placing the concrete was as follows:

                                                       Per cu. yd.
Measuring, mixing and loading                                $0.20
Transporting by rail and cables                               0.12
Laying and tamping floors and walls including setting forms   0.22
                                                             -----
  Total                                                      $0.54

The cost of laying and tamping the concrete on the vaulting was 14 cts. per cu. yd. The vaulting
is a groined arch 6 ins. thick at the crown and 2½ ft. thick at the piers.

The lumber of the centering for the vaulting was spruce for the ribs and posts, and 1-in. hemlock
for the lagging. The centering was all cut by machinery, the ribs put together to a template,
and the lagging sawed to proper bevels and lengths. The centers were made so that they could
be taken down in sections and used again. The cost of centering was as follows:

These centers covered two filters, each having an area of 121-1/3×258 ft. There were six more
filters of the same size, for which the same centers were used. The cost of taking down, moving
and putting up these centers (313 M.) three times was as follows:

  Total cost of moving centers to cover 196,660 sq. ft.  $7,629.30

The cost of moving the centers each time was $8.10 per M., showing that they were practically
rebuilt; for the first building of the centers, as above shown, cost only $6.37 per M. In other
words, the centers were not designed so as to be moved in sections as they should have been.
Although the centers were used four times in all, the lumber was in fit condition for further
use. The cost of the labor and lumber for the building and moving of these centers for the
8 filter beds, having a total area of 259,220 sq. ft., was $15,438, or 6 cts. per sq. ft.

~GRAIN ELEVATOR BINS.~--In constructing cylindrical bins 30 ft. in diameter and 90 ft. high
for a grain elevator the forms shown by Fig. 287 were used. For the inside wall a complete
ring of lagging 4 ft. high nailed to circular horizontal ribs of 2×8-in. planks was used. For
the outside wall two, three or four segments fitting the clear spaces between adjoining tanks
were used, these panel segments being also 4 ft. high. The inside and outside rings were held
together by yokes constructed as shown, and bolted to the inner and outer ribs. A staging built
up inside the tank carried jack screws, on which were seated the inner legs of the yokes.

CHAPTER XXIII.

METHODS AND COST OF CONSTRUCTING ORNAMENTAL WORK.

The safest rule for ornamental work is to leave its construction to those who make a specialty
of such work. This is perfectly practicable in most concrete structures having ornament. Bridge
railings can be and usually are made up of separately molded posts, balusters, bases and rail.
Ornamental columns in building work, keystones, medallions, brackets, dentils, rosettes, and
cornice courses can be similarly molded and placed in the structure as the monolithic work
reaches the proper points. The general constructor, therefore, can readily delegate these special
parts of his concrete bridge or building to specialists at frequently less cost to himself
and nearly always with greater certainty of good results than if he installed molds and organized
a trained gang for doing the work.

Good concrete ornament is not alone a matter of good design. It is also a matter of skilled
construction. Nearly anyone can mold an ornament, but few can mold an ornament which is durable.
To produce clean, sharp lines and arises which will endure, the molder must have special knowledge
and familiarity with the action of cement and of concrete mixtures, both in molding and on
exposure to the elements. This is knowledge that the general concrete worker rarely possesses
but which the ornament molder does possess if he knows his business. Special work is always
best left to the specialist.

While the more intricate ornamental work is best done by sub-contract, so far at least as the
actual molding of the ornaments is concerned, there is a large amount of simple paneling and
molding which the general practitioner not only can do but must do. Knowledge of the best methods
of doing such work is essential and it is also essential that the constructor should know in
a general way of the special methods of molding intricate ornaments.

~SEPARATELY MOLDED ORNAMENTS.~--The cement for ornamental work must be strong and absolutely
sound. Where an especially light color is wished a light colored cement is desirable. So called
white cements are now being manufactured. Lafarge cement, a light colored, non-staining cement
made in France, gives excellent results. Of American cements, Vulcanite cement has a light
color, and next to it in this respect comes Whitehall cement. A light colored ornament can,
however, be secured with any cement by using white sand or marble or other white stone screenings.
Some authorities advocate this method of securing light colored blocks as always cheaper and
usually superior to the use of special cements. The choice between the two methods will be
governed by the results sought; where as nearly as possible a pure white is desired it stands
to reason that a white or nearly white cement will give the better results.

In the matter of sand and aggregate for ornamental work, the kinds used will ordinarily be
the kinds that are available. They must conform in quality to the standard requirements of
such materials for concrete work. Where special colors or tints are wanted they can be secured
by using for sand and aggregate screenings from stones of the required color. This is in all
respects the best method of securing colored blocks, as the color will not fade and the concrete
is not weakened. A great variety of pigments are made for coloring concrete; these colors all
fade in time, and with few exceptions they all weaken the concrete. The mixtures used in ornamental
work will depend upon the detail of the ornament and upon whether color is or is not required.
Generally a rich mixture of cement and sand or fine stone screenings will be used for the surface
and will be backed with the ordinary concrete mixture. A surface mixture of fine material is
necessary where clear, sharp lines and edges or corners are demanded.

The molds used for ornament are wooden molds, iron molds, sand molds and plaster of Paris and
special molds. Each kind has its field of usefulness, and its advantages over the others. They
will be considered briefly in the order named.

~Wooden Molds.~--Wooden molds are perhaps the best for general work where plain shapes and
not too delicate ornamentation are wanted. They give the best results only with a quite dry
and rather coarse grained surface mixture. If a wet mixture is used such water as flushes to
the surface cannot escape and small pits and holes are formed, which necessitates grout or
other finishing. The following are examples of wooden mold work:

In constructing a five-span reinforced concrete arch bridge at Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1904,
the railings and ornamental parts of the bridge, such as keystones, brackets, consols, dentiles
and panels, were cast in molds and set in place much as cut stone would be. Special molds were
employed for each of these different shapes. These molds were plastered with an earth damp
mortar composed of 1 part cement and 2½ parts fine sand, which was followed up with a backing
of wet concrete composed of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts broken stone passing a
¾-in. ring. The facing mortar was made 1½ ins. thick. The castings cannot be told from dressed
stone at a few feet distance.

The part elevation and sections in the drawings of Fig. 288 show the arrangement of the various
castings to form the completed railing, coping, etc. To specify, A is the arch ring, B the
brackets, C the coping, and D, E, F, respectively, the base, balusters and rail of the bridge
railing. The blocks G and H show the keystone and railing post. The forms or molds for each
of these parts are shown by the other drawings of Fig. 288. A description of each of these
forms follows:

The keystones were molded in wooden forms, consisting of one piece, a, forming the top and
front; of two side pieces, f, of a bottom consisting of two parts, b and c; and of a back piece,
g. The back and side pieces are stiffened with 2×3½-in. pieces, and the front, sides and back
are held together by yokes or clamps. The front of the mold was the only portion calling for
particular work, and this was made of boards laminated together.

The bracket molds consisted of two side pieces provided with grooves for receiving the front
and back pieces, and with slots for tie rods clamping the whole mold together. It will be noted
also that the side pieces had nailed to them inside a beveled strip to form a groove in each
side of the cast block. The purpose of this groove was to provide a bond to hold the bracket
more firmly in the adjoining concrete of the wall. The bottom of the mold was formed by a 2-in.
plank, and when the concrete had been tamped in place the forms were removed, and the bracket
was left on the bottom to set. It may be noted here that a goodly number of the brackets showed
a crack at the joint marked x caused by tamping at the point y. In construction the bracket
castings were set at proper intervals on the spandrel walls, which had been completed up to
the level of the line X Y. The coping course was then built up around the bracket blocks to
the level of the bottom of the railing base.

The mold or form for the coping course was designed to build the coping in successive sections,
and was built up around the bracket blocks, and supported from the centers as shown by the
drawings. To form the expansion joints in the coping course there were inserted across the
mold at proper intervals a short iron plate ¼ in. thick, cut to fit. The cutting of this plate
was found to be a slow operation.

The forms for the base of the railing (Section D) consisted of 1¾-in. stock for the sides,
and ¾-in. stock for the slopes. They extended across the arch, and were held together by a
very simple though very efficient clamp. This consisted of two 2×3×33-in. pieces nailed to
a 2×3×17-in. piece by means of galvanized iron strips. About half-way down the long pieces,
a ½-in. rod was run through, and secured up against blocks, h, placed about 56 ins. apart.
These blocks were removed as the concrete was put in place. It will be noticed from the cross-section
of the railing that the balusters are set into sockets formed in the top of the base course.
These sockets were formed by means of the mold shown at W and Z.

In casting the balusters, Section (E), a 3/8-in. cast iron mold, consisting of four iron sides
and an iron top, was used. Originally there were two end plates of iron, but it was found more
convenient to have the bottom one of wood and allow the cast spindle to stand and set. The
mold was held together by ½-in. bolts. It would have been more practical to have had the side
casting composed of two parts.

The form for the railing is built up around the tops of the spindles. The bottom piece is 1×9
ins., to which 4¼-in. ogee molding is nailed. The sides are of 1-in. stock, and are clamped
together. The top is finished off with a trowel.

The mold for the posts is made in four parts, which fit together at the top and bottom by a
bevel joint, as shown in the one-fourth section. The broad sides rest against the narrow ones,
and are held against the same by means of ½-in. rods running through 2×3-in. stock: 2-in. projections
of the broad sides facilitate the removal of the form from the completed post.

In constructing a concrete facade for a plate girder bridge at St. Louis. Mo., the railing
above the base was constructed of separately molded blocks as follows: The balusters were cast
in plaster molds. To make these molds a box square in plan and the height of the baluster was
constructed of wood and cut vertically into three sections. The inside lateral dimensions of
this box were made 6 ins. greater than the largest dimension of the baluster. A full size wooden
pattern of the baluster was set up and the three sections of the box were set around it. Sheets
of thin galvanized metal, with their inner edges cut to conform to the curves of the baluster,
were inserted in the joints of the assembled box so as to divide the vacant space between the
pattern and the box into vertical sections.

A mixture of 1 part Portland cement and 1 part plaster of Paris, made wet, was then poured
around the pattern until the box was filled. When this mixture had become hard, the box was
taken down, leaving a plaster and cement casing separated into three parts by the sheets of
galvanized metal. This casing was separated from the pattern and given a coat of shellac on
the inside. Four or five molds of this description were cast. To cast a baluster, the sections
were assembled and a ½-in. corrugated bar was set vertically in the center. A mixture of 1
part Portland cement and 3 parts sand was then poured into the mold and allowed to harden.
The molds for the urns on the railing post and the balls on the end posts were made in exactly
the same manner as the baluster molds. The construction of the railing posts is shown by the
drawings of Fig. 289. Referring first to the end posts, it will be seen that they were molded
in place in seven sections marked A, B, C, E, F, and G. The construction of the mold for each
section is shown by the correspondingly lettered detail. The intermediate posts were built
up of the separately molded pieces I, K and H. The costs of molding the several parts were:
Balusters, 60 cts. each; hand rail, 40 cts. per lin. ft. The six intermediate posts cost $12
each, and the four end or newel posts cost $75 each.

In constructing the 72-ft. span-ribbed arch bridge over Deer Park Gorge, near La Salle, Ill.,
a hand railing of the design shown by Fig. 290, was used. In constructing this railing, the
posts were molded in place, but the open work panels between posts and the hand rail proper
were molded separately and set in place between the posts as indicated. For molding the panels
a number of boxes constructed as shown by Fig. 291, were used. These were simple rectangular
boxes on the bottom boards of which were nailed blocks of the proper shape and in the proper
position to form the openings in the railing. The bottom of the form was first plastered with
mortar, then the concrete was filled in and plastered on top. As soon as the concrete had begun
to set the blocks were removed so that final setting could take place without danger of cracking.
When the concrete had set so that the panel could be safely handled, it was removed from the
form and stored until wanted. The hand rail for each side was molded in two pieces in forms
constructed as shown by Fig. 292. The total cost of the railing in place was about $2 per lineal
foot. The concrete was a 1-2-4 mixture of screenings and 7/8-in. broken stone.

~Iron Molds.~--Iron molds have the same disadvantages as wooden molds in the use of wet mixtures.
They can be made to mold more intricate ornaments, and in the matter of durability, are, of
course, far superior to wood. Iron molds can be ordered cast to pattern in any well equipped
foundry. Many firms making block machines also make standard column, baluster, ball and base,
cornice, and base molds of various sizes and patterns. These molds are made in two, three or
more sections which can be quickly locked together and taken apart. A column mold, for example,
will consist of a mold for the base, another for the shaft, and a third for the capitol, each
in collapsible sections. Where the pattern of the shaft changes in its height, two shaft molds
are commonly used, one for each pattern. Prices of iron molds are subject to variation, but
the following are representative figures: Plain baluster molds 14 to 18 ins. high, $7.50 to
$10 each; fluted square balusters, 14 to 18 ins. high, $10, each; ball and base, 10 to 18-in.
balls, $15 to $25 each; fluted Grecian column, base, capitol and one shaft molds, $30; Renaissance
column, base, capitol and two shaft molds, $45.
