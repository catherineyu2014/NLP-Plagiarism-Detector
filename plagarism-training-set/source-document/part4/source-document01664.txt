A line from Kasan, on the main central Russian line, through Georgia and Circassia, along the
western shore of the Caspian Sea, to Teheran, the capital of Persia, thence to the Tigris,
at Bagdad, thence descending along the banks of that river to the head of the Persian Gulf,
there to be connected with the Oriental telegraph system of India.

The line from Irkoutsk to Pekin American citizens residing in China are now soliciting, with
good prospect of success, permission from the Chinese Government to extend through the Empire,
with the needful branches, connecting the principal ports along the Pacific coast, opposite
California. A company to carry out this project has been organized under the laws of the State
of New York. The wires of this company are first to be put up from Canton to Macao and Hong
Kong, a distance of 140 miles,--Canton having a population of 1,000,000, Hong-Kong of 40,000,
and the trade of both cities world-famous. Lying 245 miles north is Amoy, with 250,000 inhabitants;
and 120 miles farther in the same direction is Foochow, a city with a population of 600,000,
and within 70 miles of the black-tea districts, with large commerce, and with numerous manufactures
of great value. Beyond it 250 miles is Ningpo, with 300,000 inhabitants, and thriving manufactures
of silks. Eighty miles north is Shanghai, a city of not less than 200,000 inhabitants, and
possessing a larger inland or native trade than any other in China. Yet between these great
marts there is no telegraphic communication whatever,--nor, indeed, is there a line in any
part of the whole Chinese Empire. The company proposes, therefore, to connect these great commercial
cities, and, having done that, to carry on its line to Nankin, with its 400,000 inhabitants,
and thence to Pekin, which has a population of 2,000,000, and is the capital of an empire spread
over an area of 5,000,000 square miles, and containing more than 420,000,000 souls, who pay
to the Government an annual revenue of $120,000,000. It may well be understood, that, for Government
purposes alone, a line of telegraph thus extending between the chief cities of China will prove
of incalculable value, alike in its use, and in its profits to those who erect it and receive
its income. The enterprise is a great one, but its reward will be great. Its successful accomplishment
seems to be well assured; and New York may expect presently to claim the honor of first giving
to the oldest of existing empires the beneficent invention which the newest of nations created,
and at the same time of taking the final step for the completion of the one great line which
is to put all the countries of the earth in instant communication.

A line from Calcutta to Canton is already undertaken by an English company, with due authority
from the British Government.

In Australia there are now in operation twelve thousand miles of telegraph-wire. This Australian
system, which is at present so purely local and isolated, is nevertheless expected to be brought
into combination, by alternating submarine and island wires, with the Chinese and Russian line
above described.

The statistics of the telegraph-lines in Great Britain show not only an increase in the number
of lines, but a great augmentation in the amount of business transacted. In 1861 there were
11,528 miles of line open for public use; in 1862, 12,711 miles; and in 1863, 13,892 miles,
comprising 65,012 miles of wire. Last year, the number of stations was augmented in like proportion;
and facilities were offered for the transmission of telegraphic dispatches at no fewer than
1,755 stations, containing 6,196 instruments, through which about 3,400,000 telegrams were
sent. In addition to the lines on British soil, the Submarine Telegraph Company has cables
stretching to Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, Jersey, Ostend, Hanover, and Denmark, with which the
other lines are more or less in connection, covering 887 miles with 2,683 miles of wire. This
company has upwards of 3,000 stations on the Continent. The messages sent by it to and from
foreign countries were, in 1861, 230,000; in 1862, 310,595; and in 1863, 345,784.

France possesses a system comprising 71,034 miles of wire and 1,301 stations, which transmit
about 1,500,000 private dispatches annually, and nearly 175,000 official ones. Russia has 36,663
miles of wire; Austria, 22,230; Italy, 20,120; Prussia, 24,149; Spain, 17,743; Belgium, 3,773;
Switzerland, 3,720; Turkey, 6,571; Persia, 2,500; Greece, 3,000; India, 10,994, and 136 stations;
Australia, 12,000; South Australia, 2,000; the United States, 120,000; the British Provinces
in America, 20,000;--making a total of upwards of 440,000 miles of aërial wire in operation
in all parts of the world.

The following tables give the details of the principal cables hitherto laid by all makers.
They are divided into three heads: 1st, Those which have been wholly successful, and are now
working (September, 1865); 2d, Those which were partially successful, having worked for a time;
3d, Those which wholly failed, or never worked after their submergence.

It will be seen from the above list of failures, that the great extension and success of submarine
cables has been attained through many great failure,--among the most prominent being the old
and new Atlantic, the Red Sea and India, (which was laid in five sections, that worked from
six to nine months each, but was never in working order from end to end,) the Singapore and
Batavia, and Sardinia and Corfu. None of these cable, with the exception of the new Atlantic,
were tested under water after manufacture, and every one of them was covered with a sheathing
of light iron wire, weighing in the aggregate only about fifteen hundred pounds per mile.

These two peculiarities are sufficient to account for every failure which has occurred, with
the exception of the new Atlantic. No electrical test will show the presence of flaws in the
insulating cover of a wire, unless water, or some other conductor, enters the flaws and establishes
an electrical connection between the outside and inside of the cable. All cables now manufactured
are tested under water before being laid.

Communication between the Ottoman capital and Western Europe passes through Vienna. From this
city to Constantinople there are two distinct lines,--one passing by Semlin and Belgrade to
Adrianople, the other by Toultcha, Kustendji, and Varna. There is a third line to Adrianople
by Bucharest; and by the opening of the submarine line between Avlona and Otranto, in Italy,
the Turkish telegraph service will be in direct communication with the West, without going
through Servia or the Moldo-Wallachian Principalities.

Communication between Constantinople and India is maintained over the following route:--To
Ismid, 55 miles; thence to Mudurli, 104 miles; thence to Angora, 111 miles; thence to Guzgat,
113 miles; thence to Sivas, 140 miles; Kharpoot, 178 miles; Diarbekir, 77 miles; Mardeen, 61
miles; Djezireh, 104 miles; Mosul, (Nineveh,) 91 miles; Kerkook, 114 miles; Bagdad, 189 miles.
From Bagdad to Fao, at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, on the Persian Gulf, is 400 miles. From
Fao to Kurrachee the submarine cable stretches along the bottom of the Persian Gulf for 1,450
miles; and thence are 500 miles of aërial line across a portion of British India to Bombay.

The accounts of the successful opening of this line tell of the astonishment of the savage
Beloochees and Arabs along the Mekran coast at the marvel of a blue spark flashing for the
Sahib to the Indus and back again in less time than it takes to smoke a hookah. At Gwadur,
no sooner was the cable landed than the people of the surrounding country flocked down to hear
and talk of the Feringhee witchcraft. Chiefs of the Beloochees, Muscatees, and Heratees, with
their retainers, trod upon each other's toes in their eagerness to see it work. Gwadur has
given up the idea that Mahomet taught everything that could be known, and now sits upon the
carpet of astonishment and chews the betel-nut of meditation.

The establishment of the electric telegraph in India presented some curious as well as difficult
problems. In the first place, it was discovered that the air of India is in a state of constant
electrical perturbation of the strongest kind, so that the instruments there mounted went into
a high fever and refused to work. Along the north and south lines a current of electricity
was constantly passing, which threw the needles out of gear and baffled the signallers. Moreover,
the tremendous thunder-storms ran up and down the wires and melted the conductors; the monsoon
winds tore the teak-posts out of the sodden ground; the elephants and buffaloes trampled the
fallen lines into kinks and tangles; the Delta aborigines carried off the timber supports for
fuel, and the wires or iron rods upon them to make bracelets and to supply the Hindoo smitheries;
the cotton- and rice-boats, kedging up and down the river, dragged the subaqueous wires to
the surface. In addition to these graver difficulties were many of an amusing character. Wild
pigs and tigers scratched their skins against the posts in the jungle, and porcupines and bandicoots
burrowed them out of the ground. Kites, fishing-eagles, and hooded-crows came in hundreds and
perched upon the line to see what on earth it could mean, and sometimes after a thunder-storm,
when the wires were wet, were found dead by dozens, the victims of their curiosity, Monkeys
climbed the posts and ran along the lines, chattering, and dropping an interfering tail from
one wire to another, which tended to confound the conversations of Calcutta. Parrots, with
the same contempt for electrical insulation, fastened upon one string by the beak and another
by the leg; and in one village, the complacent natives hung their fishing-lines to dry upon them.

In 1856 there were four thousand miles of telegraph-wire stretched over India: some upon bamboo
posts, which bent to the storms and thus defied them; some, as in the Madras Presidency, upon
monoliths of granite,--these, during the Mutiny, proving worth ten times their cost.

       *       *       *       *       *

Whilst the telegraph has been thus rapidly encircling the globe with its iron threads, great
improvement has been made in the apparatus for transmitting the electrical signals over them.
Instruments called translators, or repeaters, have been devised, by which aërial lines may
be operated, without repetition, over distances of many thousands of miles. Through the use
of this valuable invention upon the California line, operators in New York and San Francisco
are able to converse as readily and rapidly as those situated at the extremities of a line
only a hundred miles in length.

The enormous increase in the amount of matter to be transmitted over the wires has stimulated
the inventive genius of our own country and Europe to produce an apparatus by which the capacity
of a wire may be greatly increased. Mr. M. G. Farmer of Boston, Mr. J. G. Smith of Portland,
Maine, Dr. Gintl of Germany, and one or two other persons, have solved the problem of the simultaneous
transmission of messages over a single wire in opposite directions. But while their apparatus,
with the proper arrangement of batteries, will unquestionably permit the accomplishment of
this apparent paradox, the natural disturbances upon a wire of any considerable length, together
with the inequalities of the current caused by escape in wet weather, have precluded its practical
use.

In this country, General Lefferts of New York, and in Europe, Professor Bonelli, have devoted
much time and expense to the perfection of apparatus for securing greater rapidity of transmission
over the aërial lines.

General Lefferts owns several patents covering inventions of great ingenuity and value, which
are now being perfected and will shortly be brought into operation. The apparatus consists
of an instrument, operated by keys similar to those of a piano-forte, for punching characters,
composed of dots and lines, upon a narrow strip of paper. The paper, when thus prepared, is
passed rapidly through an instrument attached to a telegraph-wire, at the other end of which
is a similar instrument which runs in unison. The first instrument is provided with a flexible
metallic comb, which presses through the perforations in the paper and thus closes the circuit
at each dot and line, while the second instrument is provided with a metallic stylus, or pointer,
which rests upon a fillet of paper prepared with chemicals, and produces, whenever the circuit
is closed, dots and lines of a dark blue color upon the prepared paper. When the paper is prepared
by the perforating apparatus, it can be run through the instrument at any rate of speed that
is desirable, and it is estimated that with this apparatus one wire may easily perform as much
work in a day as ten can under the ordinary arrangement.

In Professor Bonelli's system the dispatch is set up in printing-type, and placed on a little
carriage, which is made to pass beneath a comb with five teeth, which are in communication
with five aërial wires of the line, at the extremity of which these same wires are joined to
the five teeth of a second comb, under which passes a chemically prepared paper, carried along
on a little carriage similar to the one at the other end on which the printing-type is placed.
If under this arrangement the electric circuit of a battery composed of a sufficient number
of elements, and distributed in a certain order, be completed, then, at the same time that
the first comb is passing over the printing-type at the one end, the second comb at the other
end will trace the dispatch on the prepared paper in beautiful Roman letters, and with so great
a rapidity that it may be expected that five hundred messages of twenty words each will be
transmitted hourly.

On Wednesday, April 19th, the day of Mr. Lincoln's funeral, eighty-five thousand words of reports
were transmitted between Washington and New York, between the hours of 7, P. M., and 1, A.
M., being at the rate of over fourteen thousand words per hour. Nine wires were employed for
the purpose. Thirteen thousand six hundred words were transmitted by the House printing instruments
on a single wire after half past seven o'clock.

A telegraphic message was recently received in London from India in eight hours and a half.
This message was forwarded by the Indo-European Telegraph Company, viâ Kurrachee and the Persian
Gulf, crossing one half of Asia and the whole of Europe.

During the late Rebellion in this country the telegraph was extensively employed both by the
Government and the Insurgents. In the course of the past year, there have been in the service
of the Government thirty field-trains, distributed as follows:--In the Army of the Potomac,
five; in the Department of the Cumberland, five; in the Department of the Gulf, three; in the
Department of North Carolina and Virginia, three; in the Department of the South, two; in the
Department of the Tennessee, six; in the Department of the Ohio, two; at the Signal Camp of
Instruction, Georgetown, D. C., three; at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New
York, one. Of these trains, some were equipped with five, and others with ten miles of insulated
wire. There were carried in the trains lances for setting up the wire, when necessary,--reels,
portable by hand, carrying wire made purposely flexible for this particular use,--and various
minor appliances, which experience has proved useful. A military organization was directed
for each train.

In duty of this kind, the construction of the trains, the equipment to be carried by them,
and the military organization to be provided for their use, to enable them to be most rapidly
and anywhere brought into action, are the subjects for study: the particular instrument to
be equipped is a secondary consideration. The soldiers drilled to the duty of construction
acquire in a short time a remarkable skill in the rapid extension of these lines. As was anticipated,
they have proved valuable auxiliaries to the services of the corps, and have sometimes rendered
them available when they would have been otherwise useless. The greatest distance at which
the instruments are reported to have worked is twenty miles. The average distances at which
they are used are from five to eight miles. The average speed of the most rapid construction
is reported to be at the rate of a slow walk.

At the first Battle of Fredericksburg field-trains were for the first time in the history of
the war used on the battle-field, under the fire of the enemy's batteries. The movements to
be made on the day of that battle were of the first magnitude. The movements of the retreat
were perilous to the whole army. The trains in use contributed something to the success of
those movements.

Many incidents are recorded of operators accompanying raiding parties into the enemy's territory
and tapping the telegraph-lines, sometimes obtaining valuable information. One is related by
the "Selma Rebel." The operator at that place was called to his instrument by some one up the
Tennessee and Alabama Road, who desired information as to the number of the forces and supplies
at Coosa Bridge. After getting all the information he could, regarding the location and strength
of the Rebel forces, he informed the Selma operator that he was attached to the expedition
under General Wilson, and that, at that particular time, he was stationed with his instruments
up a tree near Monticello, in the hardest rain he ever saw! Permission being given, he sent
a dispatch to a young lady in Mobile, and another to a telegraph-operator in the Rebel lines,
telling him he loved him as much as before the war. After some other conversation, the Yankee
operator clambered down from the tree, mounted his horse, and rode away.

THE FIELD OF GETTYSBURG.

In the month of August, 1865, I set out to visit some of the scenes of the great conflict through
which the country has lately passed.

On the twelfth, I reached Harrisburg,--a plain, prosaic town of brick and wood, with nothing
especially attractive about it, except its broad-sheeted, shining river, flowing down from
the Blue Ridge, around wooded islands, and between pleasant shores.

It is in this region that the traveller from the North first meets with indications of recent
actual war. The Susquehanna, on the eastern shore of which the city stands, forms the northern
limit of Rebel military operations. The "highwater mark of the Rebellion" is here: along these
banks its uttermost ripples died. The bluffs opposite the town are still crested with the hastily
constructed breastworks, on which the citizens worked night and day in the pleasant month of
June, 1863, throwing up, as it were, a dike against the tide of invasion. These defences were
of no practical value. They were unfinished when the Rebels appeared in force in the vicinity.
Harrisburg might easily have been taken, and a way opened into the heart of the North. But
a Power greater than man's ruled the event. The Power that lifted these azure hills, and spread
out the green valleys, and hollowed a passage for the stream, appointed to treason also a limit
and a term. "Thus far, and no farther."

The surrounding country is full of lively reminiscences of those terrible times. Panic-stricken
populations flying at the approach of the enemy; whole families fugitive from homes none thought
of defending; flocks and herds, horses, wagon-loads of promiscuously heaped household stuffs
and farm produce; men, women, children, riding, walking, running, driving or leading their
bewildered four-footed chattels,--all rushing forward with clamor and alarm under clouds of
dust, crowding every road to the river, and thundering across the long bridges regardless of
the "five-dollars-fine" notice (though it is to be hoped that the toll-takers did their duty):--such
were the scenes which occurred to render the Rebel invasion memorable. The thrifty German farmers
of the lower counties did not gain much credit either for courage or patriotism at that time.
It was a panic, however, to which almost any community would have been liable. Stuart's famous
raid of the previous year was well remembered. If a small cavalry force had swept from their
track through a circuit of about sixty miles over two thousand horses, what was to be expected
from Lee's whole army? Resistance to the formidable advance of one hundred thousand disciplined
troops was of course out of the question. The slowness, however, with which the people responded
to the State's almost frantic calls for volunteers was in singular contrast with the alacrity
each man showed to run off his horses and get his goods out of Rebel reach.

From Harrisburg, I went, by the way of York and Hanover, to Gettysburg. Having hastily secured
a room at a hotel in the Square, (the citizens call it the "Di'mond,") I inquired the way to
the battle-ground.

"You are on it now," said the landlord, with proud satisfaction,--for it is not every man that
lives, much less keeps a tavern, on the field of a world-famous fight. "I tell you the truth,"
said he; and, in proof of his words, (as if the fact were too wonderful to be believed without
proof,) he showed me a Rebel shell imbedded in the brick wall of a house close by. (N. B. The
battle-field was put into the bill.)

Gettysburg is the capital of Adams County: a town of about three thousand souls,--or fifteen
hundred, according to John Burns, who assured me that half the population were Copperheads,
and that they had no souls. It is pleasantly situated on the swells of a fine undulating country,
drained by the headwaters of the Monocacy. It has no special natural advantages,--owing its
existence, probably, to the mere fact that several important roads found it convenient to meet
at this point, to which accident also is due its historical renown. The circumstance which
made it a burg made it likewise a battle-field.

About the town itself there is nothing very interesting. It consists chiefly of two-story houses
of wood and brick, in dull rows, with thresholds but little elevated above the street. Rarely
a front yard or blooming garden-plot relieves the dreary monotony. Occasionally there is a
three-story house, comfortable, no doubt and sufficiently expensive, about which the one thing
remarkable is the total absence of taste in its construction. In this respect Gettysburg is
but a fair sample of a large class of American towns, the builders of which seem never once
to have been conscious that there exists such a thing as beauty.

John Burns, known as "the hero of Gettysburg," was almost the first person whose acquaintance
I made. He was sitting under the thick shade of an English elm in front of the tavern. The
landlord introduced him as "the old man who took his gun and went into the first day's fight."
He rose to his feet and received me with sturdy politeness,--his evident delight in the celebrity
he enjoys twinkling through the veil of a naturally modest demeanor.

"John will go with you and show you the different parts of the battle-ground," said the landlord.
"Will you, John?"

"Oh, yes, I'll go," said John, quite readily; and we set out at once.

A mile south of the town is Cemetery Hill, the head and front of an important ridge, running
two miles farther south to Round Top,--the ridge held by General Meade's army during the great
battles. The Rebels attacked on three sides,--on the west, on the north, and on the east; breaking
their forces in vain upon this tremendous wedge, of which Cemetery Hill may be considered the
point. A portion of Ewell's Corps had passed through the town several days before, and neglected
to secure that very commanding position. Was it mere accident, or something more, which thus
gave the key to the country into our hands, and led the invaders, alarmed by Meade's vigorous
pursuit, to fall back and fight the decisive battle here?

With the old "hero" at my side pointing out the various points of interest, I ascended Cemetery
Hill. The view from the top is beautiful and striking. On the north and east is spread a finely
variegated farm country; on the west, with woods and valleys and sunny slopes between, rise
the summits of the Blue Ridge.

It was a soft and peaceful summer day. There was scarce a sound to break the stillness, save
the shrill note of the locust, and the perpetual click-click of the stone-cutters, at work
upon the granite headstones of the soldiers' cemetery. There was nothing to indicate to a stranger
that so tranquil a spot had ever been a scene of strife. We were walking in the time-hallowed
place of the dead, by whose side the martyr-soldiers, who fought so bravely and so well on
those terrible first days of July, slept as sweetly and securely as they.

"It don't look here as it did after the battle," said John Burns. "Sad work was made with the
tombstones. The ground was all covered with dead horses, and broken wagons, and pieces of shells,
and battered muskets, and everything of that kind, not to speak of the heaps of dead." But
now the tombstones have been replaced, the neat iron fences have been mostly repaired, and
scarcely a vestige of the fight remains. Only the burial-places of the slain are there. Thirty-five
hundred and sixty slaughtered Union soldiers lie on the field of Gettysburg. This number does
not include those whose bodies have been claimed by friends and removed.

The new cemetery, devoted to the patriot slain, and dedicated with fitting ceremonies on the
19th of November, 1863, adjoins the old one. In the centre is the spot reserved for the monument,
the corner-stone of which was laid on the 4th of July, 1865. The cemetery is semicircular,
in the form of an amphitheatre, except that the slope is reversed, the monument occupying the
highest place. The granite headstones resemble rows of semicircular seats. Side by side, with
two feet of ground allotted to each, and with their heads towards the monument, rest the three
thousand five hundred and sixty. The name of each, when it could be ascertained, together with
the number of the company and regiment in which he served, is lettered on the granite at his
head. But the barbarous practice of stripping such of our dead as fell into their hands, in
which the Rebels indulged here as elsewhere, rendered it impossible to identify large numbers.
The headstones of these are lettered, "Unknown." At the time when I visited the cemetery, the
sections containing most of the unknown had not yet received their headstones, and their resting-places
were indicated by a forest of stakes. I have seen few sadder sights.

The spectacle of so large a field crowded with the graves of the slain brings home to the heart
an overpowering sense of the horror and wickedness of war. Yet, as I have said, not all our
dead are here. None of the Rebel dead are here. Not one of those who fell on other fields,
or died in hospitals and prisons in those States where the war was chiefly waged,--not one
out of those innumerable martyred hosts lies on this pleasant hill. The bodies of once living
and brave men, slowly mouldering to dust in this sanctified soil, form but a small, a single
sheaf from that great recent harvest reaped by Death with the sickle of war.

Once living and brave! How full of life, how full of unflinching courage and fiery zeal, they
marched up hither to fight the great fight, and to give their lives! And each man had his history;
each soldier resting here had his interests, his loves, his darling hopes, the same as you
or I. All were laid down with his life. It was no trifle to him, it was as great a thing to
him as it would be to you, thus to be cut off from all things dear in this world, and to drop
at once into a vague eternity. Grown accustomed to the waste of life through years of war,
we learn to think too lightly of such sacrifices. "So many killed,"--with that brief sentence
we glide over the unimaginably fearful fact, and pass on to other details. We indulge in pious
commonplaces,--"They have gone to a better world, they have their reward," and the like. No
doubt this is true; if not, then life is a mockery, and hope a lie. But the future, with all
our faith, is vague and uncertain. It lies before us like one of those unidentified heroes,
hidden from sight, deep-buried, mysterious, its headstone lettered "Unknown." Will it ever
rise? Through trouble, toils, and privations,--not insensible to danger, but braving it,--these
men--and not these only, but the uncounted thousands represented by these--confronted, for
their country's sake, that awful uncertainty. Did they believe in your better world? Whether
they did or not, this world was a reality, and dear to them.

I looked into one of the trenches in which workmen were laying foundations for the headstones,
and saw the ends of the coffins protruding. It was silent and dark down there. Side by side
the soldiers slept, as side by side they fought. I chose out one coffin from among the rest,
and thought of him whose dust it contained,--your brother and mine, although we never knew
him. I thought of him as a child, tenderly reared--for this. I thought of his home, his heart-life:--

    "Had he a father?
      Had he a mother?
    Had he a sister?
      Had he a brother?
    Or was there a nearer one
    Still, and a dearer one
      Yet, than all other?"

I could not know: in this world, none will ever know. He sleeps with the undistinguishable
multitude, and his headstone is lettered, "Unknown."

Eighteen loyal States are represented by the tenants of these graves. New York has the greatest
number,--upwards of eight hundred; Pennsylvania comes next in order, having upwards of five
hundred. Tall men from Maine, young braves from Wisconsin, heroes from every state between,
met here to defend their country and their homes. Sons of Massachusetts fought for Massachusetts
on Pennsylvania soil. If they had not fought, or if our armies had been annihilated there,
the whole North would have been at the mercy of Lee's victorious legions. As Cemetery Hill
was the pivot on which turned the fortunes of the battle, so Gettysburg itself was the pivot
on which turned the destiny of the nation. Here the power of aggressive treason culminated;
and from that memorable Fourth of July when the Rebel invaders, beaten in the three days' previous
fight, stole away down the valleys and behind the mountains on their ignominious retreat,--from
that day, signalized also by the fall of Vicksburg in the West, it waned and waned, until it
was swept from the earth.

Cemetery Hill should be the first visited by the tourist of the battle-ground. Here a view
of the entire field, and a clear understanding of the military operations of the three days,
are best obtained. Looking north, away on your left lies Seminary Ridge, the scene of the first
day's fight, in which the gallant Reynolds fell, and from which our troops were driven back
in confusion through the town by overwhelming numbers, in the afternoon. Farther south spread
the beautiful woods and vales that swarmed with Rebels on the second and third day, and from
which they made such desperate charges upon our lines. On the right as you stand is Culp's
Hill, the scene of Ewell's furious, but futile, attempts to flank us there. You are in the
focus of a half-circle, from all points of which was poured in upon this now silent hill such
an artillery fire as has seldom been concentrated upon one point of an open field in any of
the great battles upon this planet. From this spot extend your observations as you please.

Guided by the sturdy old man, I proceeded first to Culp's Hill, following a line of breastworks
into the woods. Here are seen some of the soldiers' devices hastily adopted for defence. A
rude embankment of stakes and logs and stones, covered with earth, forms the principal work;
aside from which you meet with little private breastworks, as it were, consisting of rocks
heaped up by the trunk of a tree, or beside a larger rock, or across a cleft in the rocks,
where some sharpshooter stood and exercised his skill at his ease.

The woods are of oak chiefly, but with a liberal sprinkling of chestnut, black-walnut, hickory,
and other common forest-trees. Very beautiful they were that day, with their great, silent
trunks, all so friendly, their clear vistas and sun-spotted spaces. Beneath reposed huge, sleepy
ledges and boulders, their broad backs covered with lichens and old moss. A more fitting spot
for a picnic, one would say, than for a battle.

Yet here remain more astonishing evidences of fierce fighting than anywhere else about Gettysburg.
The trees in certain localities are all seamed, disfigured, and literally dying or dead from
their wounds. The marks of balls in some of the trunks are countless. Here are limbs, and yonder
are whole tree-tops, cut off by shells. Many of these trees have been hacked for lead, and
chips containing bullets have been carried away for relics.

Past the foot of the hill runs Rock Creek, a muddy, sluggish stream, "great for eels," said
John Burns. Big boulders and blocks of stone lie scattered along its bed. Its low shores are
covered with thin grass, shaded by the forest-trees. Plenty of Rebel knapsacks and haversacks
lie rotting upon the ground; and there are Rebel graves in the woods near by. By these I was
inclined to pause longer than John Burns thought it worth the while. I felt a pity for these
unhappy men which he could not understand. To him they were dead Rebels, and nothing more;
and he spoke with great disgust of an effort which had been made by certain "Copperheads" of
the town to have all the buried Rebels, now scattered about in the woods and fields, gathered
together in a cemetery near that dedicated to our own dead.

"Yet consider, my friend," I said, "though they were altogether in the wrong, and their cause
was infernal, these, too, were brave men; and under different circumstances, with no better
hearts than they had, they might have been lying in honored graves up yonder, instead of being
buried in heaps, like dead cattle, down here."

Is there not a better future for these men also? The time will come when we shall at least
cease to hate them.

The cicada was singing, insects were humming in the air, crows were cawing in the tree-tops,
the sunshine slept on the boughs or nestled in the beds of brown leaves on the ground,--all
so pleasant and so pensive, I could have passed the day there. But John reminded me that night
was approaching, and we returned to Gettysburg.

That evening I walked alone to Cemetery Hill to see the sun set behind the Blue Ridge. A quiet
prevailed there still more profound than during the day. The stonecutters had finished their
day's work and gone home. The katydids were singing, and the shrill, sad chirp of the crickets
welcomed the cool shades. The sun went down, and the stars came out and shone upon the graves,--the
same stars which were no doubt shining even then upon many a vacant home and mourning heart
left lonely by the husbands, the fathers, the dear brothers and sons, who fell at Gettysburg.

The next morning, according to agreement, I went to call on the old hero. I found him living
in the upper part of a little whitewashed two-story house, on the corner of two streets, west
of the town. A flight of wooden steps outside took me to his door. He was there to welcome
me. John Burns is a stoutish, slightly bent, hale old man, with a light blue eye, a long, aggressive
nose, a firm-set mouth, expressive of determination of character, and a choleric temperament.
His hair, originally dark brown, is considerably bleached with age; and his beard, once sandy,
covers his face (shaved once or twice a week) with a fine crop of silver stubble. A short,
massy kind of man; about five feet four or five inches in height, I should judge. He was never
measured but once in his life. That was when he enlisted in the War of 1812. He was then nineteen
years old, and stood five feet in his shoes. "But I've growed a heap since," said the old hero.

He introduced me to his wife, a slow, somewhat melancholy old lady, in ill health. "She has
been poorly now for a good many years." They have no children.

At my request he told me his story. He is of Scotch parentage; and who knows but he may be
akin to the ploughman-poet whose "arrowy songs still sing in our morning air"? He was born
and bred in Burlington, New Jersey. A shoemaker by trade, he became a soldier by choice, and
fought the British in what used to be the "last war." I am afraid he contracted bad habits
in the army. For some years after the war he led a wandering and dissipated life. Forty years
ago he chanced to find himself in Gettysburg, where he married and settled down. But his unfortunate
habits still adhered to him, and he was long looked upon as a man of little worth. At last,
however, when there seemed to be no hope of his ever being anything but a despised old man,
he took a sudden resolution to reform. The fact that he kept that resolution, and still keeps
it so strictly that it is impossible to prevail upon him to taste a drop of intoxicating liquor,
attests a truly heroic will. He was afterwards a constable in Gettysburg, in which capacity
he served some six years.

On the morning of the first day's fight he sent his wife away, telling her that he would take
care of the house. The firing was near by, over Seminary Ridge. Soon a wounded soldier came
into the town and stopped at an old house on the opposite corner. Burns saw the poor fellow
lay down his musket, and the inspiration to go into the battle seems then first to have seized
him. He went over and demanded the gun.

"What are you going to do with it?" asked the soldier.

"I'm going to shoot some of the damned Rebels!" replied John.

He is not a swearing man, and the strong adjective is to be taken in a strictly literal, not
a profane, sense.

Having obtained the gun, he pushed out on the Chambersburg Pike, and was soon in the thick
of the skirmish.

"I wore a high-crowned hat, and a long-tailed blue; and I was seventy years old."

The sight of so old a man, in such costume, rushing fearlessly forward to get a shot in the
very front of the battle, of course attracted attention. He fought with the Seventh Wisconsin
Regiment, the Colonel of which ordered him back, and questioned him, and finally, seeing the
old man's patriotic determination, gave him a good rifle in place of the musket he had brought
with him.

"Are you a good shot?"

"Tolerable good," said John, who is an old fox-hunter.

"Do you see that Rebel riding yonder?"

"I do."

"Can you fetch him?"

"I can try."

The old man took deliberate aim and fired. He does not say he killed the Rebel, but simply
that his shot was cheered by the Wisconsin boys, and that afterwards the horse the Rebel rode
was seen galloping with an empty saddle. "That's all I know about it."

He fought until our forces were driven back in the afternoon. He had already received two slight
wounds, and a third one through the arm, to which he paid little attention: "only the blood
running down my hand bothered me a heap." Then, as he was slowly falling back with the rest,
he received a final shot through the leg. "Down I went, and the whole Rebel army ran over me."
Helpless, nearly bleeding to death from his wounds, he lay upon the field all night. "About
sun-up, next morning, I crawled to a neighbor's house, and found it full of wounded Rebels."
The neighbor afterwards took him to his own house, which had also been turned into a Rebel
hospital. A Rebel surgeon dressed his wounds; and he says he received decent treatment at the
hands of the enemy, until a Copperhead woman living opposite "told on him."

"That's the old man who said he was going out to shoot some of the damned Rebels!"

Some officers came and questioned him, endeavoring to convict him of "bushwhacking"; but the
old man gave them little satisfaction. This was on Friday, the third day of the battle; and
he was alone with his wife in the upper part of the house. The Rebels left, and soon after
two shots were fired. One bullet entered the window, passed over Burns's head, and struck the
wall behind the lounge on which he was lying. The other shot fell lower, passing through a
door. Burns is certain that the design was to assassinate him. That the shots were fired by
the Rebels there can be no doubt; and as they were fired from their own side, towards the town,
of which they held possession at the time, John's theory was plainly the true one. The hole
in the window, and the bullet-marks in the door and wall remain.

Burns went with me over the ground where the first day's fight took place. He showed me the
scene of his hot day's work,--pointed out two trees, behind which he and one of the Wisconsin
boys stood and "picked off every Rebel that showed his head," and the spot where he fell and
lay all night under the stars and dew.

This act of daring on the part of so aged a citizen, and his subsequent sufferings from wounds,
naturally called out a great deal of sympathy, and caused him to be looked upon as a hero.
But a hero, like a prophet, has not all honor in his own country. There's a wide-spread, violent
prejudice against Burns among that class of the townspeople termed "Copperheads." The young
men, especially, who did not take their guns and go into the fight as this old man did, but
who ran, when running was possible, in the opposite direction, dislike Burns. Some aver that
he did not have a gun in his hand that day, and that he was wounded by accident, happening
to get between the two lines. Others admit the fact of his carrying a gun into the fight, but
tell you, with a sardonic smile, that his "motives were questionable." Some, who are eager
enough to make money on his picture, sold against his will, and without profit to him, will
tell you in confidence, after you have purchased it, that "Burns is a perfect humbug."

After studying the old man's character, conversing both with his friends and enemies, and sifting
evidence, during four days spent in Gettysburg, I formed my conclusions. Of his going into
the fight, and fighting, there is no doubt whatever. Of his bravery, amounting even to rashness,
there can be no reasonable question. He is a patriot of the most zealous sort; a hot, impulsive
man, who meant what he said, when he started with the gun to go and shoot some of the Rebels
qualified with the strong adjective. A thoroughly honest man, too, I think; although some of
his remarks are to be taken with considerable allowance. His temper causes him to form immoderate
opinions and to make strong statements. "He always goes beyant," said my landlord, a firm friend
of his, speaking of this tendency to overstep the bounds of calm judgment.

Burns is a sagacious observer of men and things, and makes occasionally such shrewd remarks
as this:--

"Whenever you see the marks of shells and bullets on a house all covered up, and painted and
plastered over, that's the house of a Rebel sympathizer; but when you see them all preserved
and kept in sight, as something to be proud of, that's the house of a true Union man."

Well, whatever is said or thought of the old hero, he is what he is, and has satisfaction in
that, and not in other people's opinions; for so it must finally be with all. Character is
the one thing valuable. Reputation, which is a mere shadow of the man, what his character is
reputed to be, is, in the long run, of infinitely less importance.

I am happy to add that the old man has been awarded a pension.

The next day I mounted a hard-trotting horse and rode to Round Top. On the way I stopped at
the historical peach-orchard, known as Sherfy's, where Sickles's Corps was repulsed, after
a terrific conflict, on Thursday, the second day of the battle. The peaches were green on the
trees then; but they were ripe now, and the trees were breaking down with them. One of Mr.
Sherfy's girls--the youngest, she told me--was in the orchard. She had in her basket rareripes
to sell. They were large and juicy and sweet,--all the redder, no doubt, for the blood of the
brave that had drenched the sod. So calm and impassive is Nature, silently turning all things
to use! The carcass of a mule, or the godlike shape of a warrior cut down in the hour of glory,--she
knows no difference between them, but straightway proceeds to convert both alike into new forms
of life and beauty.

Between fields made memorable by hard fighting I rode eastward, and, entering a pleasant wood,
ascended Little Round Top. The eastern slope of this rugged knob is covered with timber. The
western side is steep, and wild with rocks and bushes. Near by is the Devil's Den, a dark cavity
in the rocks, interesting henceforth on account of the fight that took place here for the possession
of these heights. A photographic view, taken the Sunday morning after the battle, shows eight
dead Rebels tumbled headlong, with their guns, among the rocks below the Den.

A little farther on is Round Top itself, a craggy tusk of the rock-jawed earth pushed up there
towards the azure. It is covered all over with broken ledges, boulders, and fields of stones.
Among these the forest-trees have taken root,--thrifty Nature making the most of things even
here. The serene leafy tops of ancient oaks tower aloft in the bluish-golden air. It is a natural
fortress, which our boys strengthened still further by throwing up the loose stones into handy
breastworks.

Returning, I rode the whole length of the ridge held by our troops, realizing more and more
the importance of that extraordinary position. It is like a shoe, of which Round Top represents
the heel, and Cemetery Hill the toe. Here all our forces were concentrated on Thursday and
Friday, within a space of three miles. Movements from one part to another of this compact field
could be made with celerity. Lee's forces, on the other hand, extended over a circle of seven
miles or more around, in a country where all their movements could be watched by us and anticipated.

At a point well forward on the foot of this shoe, Meade had his head-quarters. I tied my horse
at the gate, and entered the little square box of a house which enjoys that historical celebrity.
It is scarcely more than a hut, having but two little rooms on the ground-floor, and I know
not what narrow, low-roofed chambers above. Two small girls, with brown, German faces, were
paring wormy apples under the porch; and a round-shouldered, bareheaded, and barefooted woman,
also with a German face and a strong German accent, was drawing water at the well. I asked
her for a drink, which she kindly gave me, and invited me into the house.

The little box was whitewashed outside and in, except the floor and ceilings and inside doors,
which were neatly scoured. The woman sat down to some mending, and entered freely into conversation.
She was a widow, and the mother of six children. The two girls cutting wormy apples at the
door were the youngest, and the only ones that were left to her. A son in the army was expected
home in a few days. She did not know how old her children were,--she did not know how old she
herself was, "she was so forgetful."

She ran away at the time of the fight, but was sorry afterwards she did not stay at home. "She
lost a heap." The house was robbed of almost everything; "coverlids and sheets and some of
our own clo'es, all carried away. They got about two ton of hay from me. I owed a little on
my land yit, and thought I'd put in two lots of wheat that year, and it was all trampled down,
and I didn't get nothing from it. I had seven pieces of meat yit, and them was all took. All
I had when I got back was jest a little bit of flour yit. The fences was all tore down, so
that there wa'n't one standing, and the rails was burnt up. One shell come into the house and
knocked a bedstead all to pieces for me. One come in under the roof and knocked out a rafter
for me. The porch was all knocked down. There was seventeen dead horses on my land. They burnt
five of 'em around my best peach-tree, and killed it; so I ha'n't no peaches this year. They
broke down all my young apple-trees for me. The dead horses sp'iled my spring, so I had to
have my well dug."

I inquired if she had ever got anything for the damage.

"Not much. I jest sold the bones of the dead horses. I couldn't do it till this year, for the
meat hadn't rotted off yit. I got fifty cents a hundred. There was seven hundred and fifty
pounds. You can reckon up what they come to. That's all I got."

Not much, indeed!

This poor woman's entire interest in the great battle was, I found, centred in her own losses.
That the country lost or gained she did not know nor care, never having once thought of that
side of the question.

The town is full of similar reminiscences; and it is a subject which everybody except the "Copperheads"
likes to talk with you about. There were heroic women here, too. On the evening of Wednesday,
as our forces were retreating, an exhausted Union soldier came to Mr. Culp's house, near Culp's
Hill, and said, as he sank down,--

"If I can't have a drink of water, I must die."

Mrs. Culp, who had taken refuge in the cellar,--for the house was now between the two fires,--said,--

"I will go to the spring and get you some water."

It was then nearly dark. As she was returning with the water, a bullet whizzed past her. It
was fired by a sharpshooter on our own side, who had mistaken her for one of the advancing
Rebels. Greatly frightened, she hurried home, bringing the water safely. One poor soldier was
made eternally grateful by this courageous womanly deed. A few days later the sharpshooter
came to the house and learned that it was a ministering angel in the guise of a woman he had
shot at. Great, also, must have been his gratitude for the veil of darkness which caused him
to miss his aim.

Shortly after the battle, sad tales were told of the cruel inhospitality shown to the wounded
Union troops by the people of Gettysburg. Many of these stories were doubtless true; but they
were true only of the more brutal of the Rebel sympathizers. The Union men threw open their
hearts and their houses to the wounded.

One day I met a soldier on Cemetery Hill, who was in the battle, and who, being at Harrisburg
for a few days, had taken advantage of an excursion-train to come over and revisit the scene
of that terrible experience. Getting into conversation, we walked down the hill together. As
we were approaching a double house with high wooden steps, he pointed out the farther one,
and said,--

"Saturday morning, after the fight, I got a piece of bread at that house. A man stood on the
steps and gave each of our fellows a piece. We were hungry as bears, and it was a godsend.
I should like to see that man and thank him."

Just then the man himself appeared at the door. We went over, and I introduced the soldier,
who, with tears in his eyes, expressed his gratitude for that act of Christian charity.

"Yes," said the man, when reminded of the circumstance, "we did what we could. We baked bread
here night and day to give to every hungry soldier who wanted it. We sent away our own children,
to make room for the wounded soldiers, and for days our house was a hospital."

Instances of this kind are not few. Let them be remembered to the honor of Gettysburg.

Of the magnitude of a battle fought so desperately during three days by armies numbering not
far from two hundred thousand men no adequate conception can be formed. One or two facts may
help to give a faint idea of it. Mr. Culp's meadow, below Cemetery Hill,--a lot of near twenty
acres,--was so thickly strown with Rebel dead, that Mr. Culp declared he "could have walked
across it without putting foot upon the ground." Upwards of three hundred Confederates were
buried in that fair field in one hole. On Mr. Gwynn's farm, below Round Top, near five hundred
sons of the South lie promiscuously heaped in one huge sepulchre. Of the quantities of iron,
of the wagon-loads of arms, knapsacks, haversacks, and clothing, which strewed the country,
no estimate can be made. Government set a guard over these, and for weeks officials were busy
in gathering together all the more valuable spoils. The harvest of bullets was left for the
citizens to glean. Many of the poorer people did a thriving business, picking up these missiles
of death, and selling them to dealers; two of whom alone sent to Baltimore fifty tons of lead
collected in this way from this battle-field.

ALEXANDER HAMILTON.

The greatest name in American history is that of ALEXANDER HAMILTON, if we consider the versatility
of the man who bore it, the early age at which he began a great public career, the success
which attended all his labors, the impression which he made on his country and its government,
and the rare foresight by which he was enabled to understand that our political system would
encounter that very danger through which it has just passed,--and passed not without receiving
severe wounds, which have left it scarcely recognizable even by its warmest admirers. Talleyrand,
who had a just appreciation of Hamilton's talents and character, said that he had divined Europe.
An American need not be possessed of high powers or position to venture the assertion that
Hamilton divined American history, and foresaw all that we have suffered because our predecessors
would build the national edifice on sand, so that it could not stand against the political
storm which it was in the breath of selfish partisans to send against it, but has, as it were,
to be buttressed by mighty fleets and armies. A system, which, had it been rightly formed in
the first place, would have been self-sustaining, was saved from destruction solely by the
uprising of the people, who had to operate with bullets and bayonets, when it had been fondly
hoped that the ballot would ever be a sufficiently formidable weapon in the hand of the American
citizen, and that he never would have to become the citizen-soldier in a civil contest. Had
Hamilton been allowed to shape our national polity, it would have worked as successfully for
ages as that financial system which he formed has ever worked, and which has never been departed
from without the result being most injurious to the country. At this day, when events have
so signally justified the views of Alexander Hamilton, and are daily justifying them,[F] it
may not be unprofitable to glance over the career of one whose virtues, services, and genius
are constantly rising in the estimation of his countrymen and of the world, "the dead growing
visible from the shades of time."

To be born at all is to be well born is the general belief in this very liberal-minded age:
but even the most determined of democrats is not averse to a good descent; and Hamilton, who
was a democrat in no sense, had one of the noblest ancestries in Europe, though himself of
American birth. His family was of Scotland, a country which, the smallness of its population
considered, has produced more able and useful men than any other. The Hamiltons of Scotland,
and we may add of France, were one of the noblest of patrician houses, and they had a great
part in the stormy history of their country. Walter de Hamilton, of Cambuskeith, in the County
of Ayr,--Burns's county,--second son of Sir David de Hamilton, Dominus de Cadyow, was the founder
of that branch of the Hamilton family to which the American statesman belonged. He flourished
temp. Robert III., second of the Stuart kings, almost five hundred years ago. Many noble Scotch
names are very common, because it was the custom of the families to which they belonged to
extend them to all their retainers; but Alexander Hamilton obtained his name in no such way
as that. His descent from the Lord of Cadyow is made up with the nicest precision. The family
became of Grange in the sixteenth century. The names of the ladies married by the heads of
the Hamiltons of Cambuskeith and Grange all belong to those of the ingenuous classes. The same
Christian names are continued in the line, that of Alexander appearing as early as the latter
part of the fifteenth century, and reappearing frequently for three hundred years. Alexander
Hamilton of Grange, fourteenth in descent from Sir David de Hamilton, had three sons, the third
bearing his father's name; and that son's fifth child was James Hamilton, who emigrated to
the West Indies, settling in the Island of Nevis. Mr. James Hamilton married a French lady,
whose maiden name was Faucette, and whose father was one of many persons of worth who were
forced to leave France because of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, through the bigotry
of that little man who is commonly called the Grand Monarch, and whose bigotry was made active
by the promptings of Madame de Maintenon, who was descended from a fierce Huguenot, as was
the monarch himself.

Alexander Hamilton was born on the 11th of January, 1757. His mother died in his early childhood,
a more than usually severe loss, for she was a superior woman. He was the only one of her children
who survived her. His father soon became poor, and the child was dependent upon the relatives
of his mother for support and education. They resided at Santa Cruz, where he was brought up.
Just before completing his thirteenth year he entered the counting-house of Mr. Cruger, a merchant
of Santa Cruz. Young as he was, his employer left him in charge of his business while he made
a visit to New York, and had every reason to be satisfied with the arrangement. He read all
the books he could obtain, and read them understandingly. Even at that early age he was remarkable
for the manliness of his mind. He wrote, too; and an account of the hurricane of 1772, which
he contributed to a public journal, attracted so much attention that he was sought out, and
it was determined to send him to New York to be regularly educated. He left Santa Cruz, and
sailed for Boston, which port he reached in October, 1772. Proceeding to New York, he was sent
to school at Elizabethtown, New Jersey; and in 1773 entered King's College, in the city of
New York, where he pursued his studies with signal success. But events were happening that
were to place him in a very different school from that in which he was preparing to become
a physician. He was to be the physician of the State, and to that end he was thrown among men,
and appointed to do the work of men of the highest intellect, at an age when most persons have
not half completed the ordinary training which is to fit them to begin the common routine of
common life.

Hamilton's connection with the history of his country, as one of those who were making material
for it, began at the age of seventeen. The American Revolution was moving steadily onward when
he arrived at New York, and by the summer of 1774 it had assumed large proportions. He first
spoke at "the Great Meeting in the Fields," July 6th, and astonished those who heard him by
the fervor of his eloquence and the closeness of his logic. His fame dates from that day. He
sided with the people of his new home from the time that he came among them, and never had
any doubt or hesitation as to the course which duty required him to adopt and pursue. As a
writer he was even more successful than as a speaker. A pamphlet which he wrote in December,
1774, vindicating the Continental Congress, attracted much attention, and that and another
from his pen were attributed to veteran Whigs, particularly to John Jay; but the evidence of
Hamilton's authorship is perfect, or we might well agree with the Tories, and believe that
works so able could not have been written by a youth of eighteen. Other writings of his subsequently
appeared, and were most serviceable to the patriots. Young as he was, he was already regarded
by the country as one of its foremost champions with the pen. The time was fast coming when
it was to be made known that the holder of the pen could also hold the sword, and hold it to
effective purpose.

He had joined a volunteer corps while in college, and was forward in all its doings. The first
time he was under fire was when this corps was engaged in removing guns from the Battery. The
fire of a man-of-war was opened on it, doing some injury. This was the first act of war in
New York, and it is interesting to know that Hamilton had part in it. In the commotion that
followed, he was zealous in his efforts to prevent the triumph of a mob, and not more zealous
than successful. From the very beginning of his career, he never thought of liberty, save as
the closest associate of law. Diligently devoting himself to the study of the military art,
and particularly to gunnery, he asked for the command of an artillery company, and obtained
it after a thorough examination, being made captain on the 14th of March, 1776, when but two
months beyond his nineteenth year. He completed his company, and expended the very last money
he received from his relatives in making it fit for the field. Even at that time he advocated
promotion from the ranks, and succeeded in having his first sergeant made a commissioned officer:
a fact worthy of mention, when it is recollected that his enemies have always represented him
as an aristocrat, there being nothing less aristocratical than the placing of the sword of
command in the hands of men who have carried the musket. While pursuing his military duties,
he did not neglect the study of politics; and his notes show that before the Declaration of
Independence he had thought out a plan of government for the nation that was so soon to come
into existence. This, as his son says, "is the intuitive idea of a general government, truly
such, which he first proposed to Congress, and earnestly advocated." He was in his twentieth
year when he showed himself capable of understanding the nature of the situation, and the wants
of the country. Probably no other person had got so far at that time, and it required years
for the people to reach the point at which Hamilton had arrived intuitively. With them it was
a conclusion reached through bitter experience. The lesson has not been perfectly acquired
even at this time.

Hamilton's company belonged to that army which Washington commanded, in 1776, in New England
and New Jersey; and it was while the army was on the heights of Haerlem, in the autumn of 1776,
that he attracted the notice of Washington. The General inspected an earthwork which the Captain
was constructing, conversed with him, and invited him to his tent. This was the beginning of
an acquaintance that was destined to have memorable consequences and lasting effects on the
American nation. On the 1st of March, 1777, Hamilton was appointed to a place on Washington's
staff, becoming one of his aides, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel,--his "principal and
most confidential aide," to use Washington's language. It was not without much hesitation that
Hamilton accepted this post. He had already made a name, and his promotion in the line of the
army was secured; and had he remained to take that promotion, he would have won the highest
distinction, supposing him to have escaped the casualties of war. His military genius was unquestioned;
and what Washington required of him was service that would not secure promotion or opportunity
to show that he deserved it. He required the mind and the pen of Hamilton. These he obtained;
and the amount of labor performed by the youthful aide-de-camp with his pen was enormous. He
was something more than an aide and a private secretary. He was the commander's trusted friend,
and he proved that he deserved the trust reposed in him, not less by his high-minded conduct
than by the talent which he brought to the discharge of the duties of a most difficult post,--duties
which were of an arduous and highly responsible character. The limits of a sketch like the
present do not admit of more than the general mention of his great services. Those who would
know them in full should consult the work in which Mr. John C. Hamilton has done justice to
the part which his father had, first in the Revolutionary contest, and then in the creation
of the American Republic, and the settlement of its policy.[G] There was no event with which
Washington was concerned for more than four years with which Hamilton was not also concerned.
The range of his business and his labors was equal to his talents, and it is not possible to
say more of them. He was but twenty years old when Washington thus really placed him next to
himself in the work of conducting the American cause. In what estimation his services were
held by the commander-in-chief may be inferred from the fact that he was selected by him, in
1780, being then in his twenty-fourth year, as a special minister to France, to induce the
French Government to grant more aid to this country. Hamilton did not take the office, because
it was desired by his friend, Colonel Laurens, whose father was then a prisoner in England.

Colonel Hamilton was married on the 14th of December, 1780, to Miss Elizabeth Schuyler, second
daughter of General Philip Schuyler, one of the most distinguished soldiers of the Revolution,
to whom was due the defeat of General Burgoyne, and head of one of those old families of which
New York possessed so many. This lady was destined to survive her husband half a century, and
to be associated with two ages of the country,--her death occurring in 1854, in her ninety-eighth
year. She was a woman of exalted character, and worthy to be the wife of Alexander Hamilton.

The relations between Washington and Hamilton were briefly interrupted early in 1781, and Hamilton
left the commander's military family. He had a command in that allied army which Washington
and Rochambeau led to Yorktown, the success of which put an end to the "great war" of the Revolution
on this continent. When the British redoubts were stormed, Hamilton commanded the American
column, and carried the redoubt he assailed before the French had taken that which it fell
to their lot to attack. Shortly afterward he retired from the service, and, taking up his residence
in Albany, devoted himself to the study of the law. In 1782 he was elected a member of the
Continental Congress by the Legislature of New York, and took his seat on the 25th of November.
He proved an energetic member, his attention being largely directed to the financial state
of the country, than which nothing could be more dreary. At an early day he had been convinced
that something sound must be attempted in relation to our finances; and in 1780 he had addressed
a letter on the subject to Robert Morris, which showed that his ideas regarding money and credit
were those of a great statesman. But the time had not come in which he was to mould the country
to his will, and make it rich in spite of itself, and against its own exertions. More suffering
was necessary before the people could be made to listen to the words of truth, though uttered
by genius. Military matters also commanded the attention of the young member, as was natural,
he having been so distinguished as a soldier, and retaining that interest in the army which
he had acquired from six years' connection with it. His Congressional career was brilliant,
and added much to his reputation. It seemed that he was destined to succeed in everything he
attempted. Yet at that time he thought of retiring altogether from public life, and of devoting
himself entirely to his profession, in which he had already become eminent. In November, 1783,
he removed to the city of New York, which then had entered on that astonishing growth which
has since been so steadily maintained.

The first of the law labors of this great man were in support of those national principles
which are more closely identified with his name than with that of any other individual. In
advocating the cause of his client, he had to argue that the terms of the treaty of peace with
England and the law of nations were of more force than a statute passed by the Legislature
of the State of New York. He carried the court as decidedly with him as public opinion was
against him; and he had to defend himself in several pamphlets, which he did with his usual
success. As time went on, it became every day more apparent that the country's great need was
a strong central government, and that, until such a government should be adopted, prosperity
could not be looked for, nor order, nor anything like national life; and had not something
been done, North America would doubtless have presented very much the same spectacle that has
long been afforded by South America, and from which that rich land is but now slowly recovering.
Of those who most earnestly and effectively advocated the action necessary to save the country
from anarchy, Hamilton was among the foremost. As we have seen, he had thought soundly on this
subject as early as 1776, and years and events had confirmed and strengthened the impression
formed before independence had been resolved upon.

Appointed a delegate from New York to the commercial convention held at Annapolis in 1786,
Colonel Hamilton wrote the address put forth by that body to the States, out of which grew
the Convention of 1787, which made the Federal Constitution. To that Convention he was sent
by the New York Legislature, and his part in the work done was of the first order, though the
Constitution formed was far from commanding his entire approbation. Like a wise statesman,
who does not insist that means of action shall be perfect, but makes the best use he can of
those that are available, Hamilton accepted the Constitution, and became the strongest advocate
for its adoption, and its firmest supporter after its adoption. This part of his life--a part
as honorable to him as it was useful to his country--has been systematically misrepresented,
so that many Americans have been taught to believe that he was an enemy of freedom, and would
have established an arbitrary government. He was accused of being opposed to any republican
polity, and of seeking the annihilation of the State Governments. He was called a monarchist
and a consolidationist. These misrepresentations of his opinions and acts were forever dispelled,
according to the views of honest and unprejudiced men, by the publication of a letter which
he wrote to Timothy Pickering, in 1803. In that letter he said,--"The highest-toned propositions
which I made to the Convention were for a President, Senate, and Judges, during good behavior,
and a House of Representatives for three years. Though I would have enlarged the legislative
power of the General Government, yet I never contemplated the abolition of the State Governments;
but, on the contrary, they were, in some particulars, constituent parts of my plan. This plan
was, in my conception, conformable with the strict theory of a government purely republican;
the essential criteria of which are, that the principal organs of the executive and legislative
departments be elected by the people, and hold the office by a responsible and temporary or
defeasible nature.... I may truly, then, say that I never proposed either a President or Senate
for life, and that I neither recommended nor meditated the annihilation of State Governments....
It is a fact that my final opinion was against an executive during good behavior, on account
of the increased danger to the public tranquillity incident to the election of a magistrate
of his degree of permanency. In the plan of a constitution which I drew up while the Convention
was sitting, and which I communicated to Mr. Madison about the close of it, perhaps a day or
two after, the office of President has no longer duration than for three years. This plan was
predicated upon these bases: 1. That the political principles of the people of this country
would endure nothing but a republican government; 2. That, in the actual situation of the country,
it was itself right and proper that the republican theory should have a full and fair trial;
3. That to such a trial it was essential that the government should be so constructed as to
give it all the energy and the stability reconcilable with the principles of that theory. These
were the genuine sentiments of my heart; and upon them I then acted. I sincerely hope that
it may not hereafter be discovered, that, through want of sufficient attention to the last
idea, the experiment of republican government, even in this country, has not been as complete,
as satisfactory, and as decisive as could be wished."

Such were the views of Hamilton in 1787, and which had undergone no change in the sixteen years
that elapsed between that time and the date of his letter to Colonel Pickering. Yet this man,
so true a republican that his only desire was to have the republican polity that he knew must
here exist so framed and constituted as to become permanent, has been drawn as a bigoted monarchist
and as the enemy of freedom! In the eyes of good democrats he was the Evil Principle incarnate;
and even to this day, in the more retired portions of the country, they believe, that, if he
had lived a few years longer, he would have made himself king, and married one of the daughters
of George III. They had, and some of them yet have, about as clear conceptions of Hamilton's
career and conduct as Squire Western and his class had of the intentions of the English Whigs
of George II.'s time, whom they suspected of the intention of seizing and selling their estates,
with the purpose of sending the proceeds to Hanover, to be invested in the funds.

The leaders of the great party which triumphed in 1801, and who had libelled Hamilton while
they were in opposition, found it for their interest to continue their misrepresentations long
after the fall of the Federalists, and when the ablest of all the Federalists had been for
years in his grave. Many of them could overlook Burr's party treachery, as well as his supposed
treason, because he had been the rival of Hamilton; though probably it would be unjust to them
to suppose that they approved of his conduct in murdering the man whose talents and influence
caused them so much alarm. So far was Hamilton from pursuing a course in the Convention of
1787 that would have embarrassed that body, because it did not adopt all his plans, that Dr.
W. S. Johnson, one of Connecticut's delegates, said, that, if "the Constitution did not succeed
on trial, Mr. Hamilton was less responsible for that result than any other member, for he fully
and frankly pointed out to the Convention what he apprehended were the infirmities to which
it was liable,--and that, if it answered the fond expectations of the public, the community
would be more indebted to Mr. Hamilton than to any other member, for, after its essential outlines
were agreed to, he labored most indefatigably to heal those infirmities, and to guard against
the evils to which they might expose it." M. Guizot, who understands our politics, who knows
our history, and whose practical statesmanship and lofty talents render his opinion most valuable,
when he declared that "there is not in the Constitution of the United States an element of
order, of force, of duration, which Hamilton has not powerfully contributed to introduce into
it and to give it a predominance," stated but the simplest truth. Equally correct is his remark,
that "Hamilton must be classed among the men who have best known the vital principles and fundamental
conditions of a government." Alone of all the New York delegates Hamilton subscribed the Constitution.

In the discussions that followed the labors of the Convention, Hamilton had the principal part
in urging the adoption of the Constitution. "The Federalist," that first of all American political
works, and the excellence of which was quickly recognized by foreign statesmen, was his production.
Not only did he write most of it, but the least of what he wrote for it excels the best that
was contributed to it by men so able as Jay and Madison. Every attempt that has been made to
take from him any portion of the honor of this masterly work has failed, and it is now admitted
that it can fairly be associated only with his name. "The total number of these essays," says
Mr. John C. Hamilton, "by Hamilton's enumeration, approved by Madison, is seen to be eighty-five.
Of this enumeration, an abbreviated copy by Hamilton from his original minute, both in Hamilton's
autograph, ascribes to himself the sole authorship of sixty-three numbers, and the joint authorship
with Madison of three numbers, leaving to the latter the sole authorship of fourteen numbers,
and to Jay of five numbers."[H] "The Federalist" had a powerful influence on the public mind,
and contributed vastly to the success of the Constitutionalists; and other writings of Hamilton
had scarcely less effect. Had he not been a friend of the Constitution, and had he sought only
the creation of a powerful central government, he never would have labored for the success
of the Constitutional party; for the surest road to despotism would have been through that
anarchy which must have followed a refusal by the people to ratify the action of the Convention
of 1787. As a member of the Convention of the State of New York, Hamilton most ably supported
the ratification of the Constitution made at Philadelphia.

The Constitution was adopted, and the new government was organized on the 30th of April, 1789,
on which day General Washington became President of the United States. It was not until the
2d of September that the Treasury Department was created; and on the 11th Alexander Hamilton
was made Secretary of the Treasury. Writing to Robert Morris, Washington had asked, "What are
we to do with this heavy debt?" To which Morris answered, "There is but one man in the United
States who can tell you: that is Alexander Hamilton. I am glad you have given me this opportunity
to declare to you the extent of the obligations I am under to him." Hamilton had thought of
the station for himself, but his warmest personal friends objected to his taking it Robert
Troup says,--"I remonstrated with him: he admitted that his acceptance of it would be likely
to injure his family, but said there was a strong impression on his mind that in the financial
department he would essentially promote the welfare of the country; and this impression, united
with Washington's request, forbade his refusal of the appointment." Having said, in conversing
with Gouverneur Morris, that he was confident he could restore public credit, "Morris remonstrated
with him for thinking of so perilous a position, on which calumny and persecution were the
inevitable attendants. 'Of that,' Hamilton answered, 'I am aware; but I am convinced it is
the situation in which I can do most good.'" He had the same just self-confidence that Cromwell
felt, when he said to John Hampden that he would effect something for the Parliamentary cause,
and that William Pitt felt in 1757, when he said to the Duke of Devonshire, "My Lord, I am
sure that I can save this country, and that nobody else can." As with Cromwell and with Pitt,
Hamilton's self-confidence was to be conclusively justified by the event.

Hamilton's career as the first finance minister of the United States is the greatest evidence
of statesmanship in American history; nor is it likely ever to be surpassed, so complete is
the change in the country's condition,--a change due in great measure to his policy and conduct.
The world's annals show no more striking example of the right man in the right place than is
afforded by Hamilton's Secretaryship of the Treasury. Lofty as this praise is, it is literally
true. American Public Credit was a dead corpse in 1789; and in 1790 it was living and erect,
as it has ever since remained, in spite of the utmost exertions of all political parties to
reduce it to the state in which Hamilton found it, in the hope of injuring their rivals. All
that has been good in our financial history for three quarters of a century is due to Alexander
Hamilton; and all that has been evil in it can be traced directly to violation of his principles
or disregard of his modes of action. That we were enabled to preserve the Union against the
attacks of the Secessionists must be attributed to Hamilton's genius and exertions. He is one
of those "dead, but sceptred sovereigns, who still rule our spirits from their urns."

Ten days after his appointment to office, Secretary Hamilton was required by Congress to report
a plan for the support of the public credit. His report is admitted, even by those who do not
agree with its views, to be an able state paper. Besides upholding the payment of the foreign
debt, on which all parties were of one mind, he recommended that the domestic debt should be
treated in the same spirit. As the revival and maintenance of the public credit was the object
which the Secretary had in view, he advocated the fulfilment of original contracts, no matter
by whom claims might be held. His recommendations were adopted; and the famous "funding system"
dates from that time, and with it the prosperity of the United States. He had recommended the
assumption of the State debts; but in this he was only partially successful. The measures suggested
for the carrying out of his system were adopted. Among these was the creation of a national
bank, at the beginning of 1791. Other measures concerned the raising of revenue, and were extraordinarily
successful. And yet others for the advancement of trade, both foreign and domestic, were not
less successful: there being no subject that came properly within his department to which he
did not give his entire attention; and as he was laboring for a new nation, it necessarily
happened that all the machinery had to be improvised, To the demands made on his intellect,
his time, and his industry, the Secretary was found to be more than equal. His triumphs astonished
and gratified the friends of good government throughout the world, and carried his name to
all nations. In only eighteen months, a change had been effected such as it well might have
taken as many years to accomplish, and which thoroughly justified the new polity, and the measures
which had been adopted under it. Foreign commerce flourished, and also the domestic trade.
The agricultural interest prospered, and manufactures steadily increased. "The waste lands
in the interior were being rapidly settled; towns were springing up in every direction; the
seaports were increasing in wealth and population; and that great career of internal improvement,
by numerous highways, with which the United States have amazed the world, was begun." Fisher
Ames wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury that the national bank and the Federal Government
possessed more popularity than any institution or government could long maintain. "The success
of the government, and especially of the measures proceeding from your department," he said,
"has astonished the multitude; and while it has shut the mouths, it has stung the envious hearts,
of the State leaders." American credit was raised so high in Europe, that, at the opening of
1791, a great loan was taken in Holland in two hours, on better terms than any European government
but one could have obtained. The subscriptions to the national bank were filled in a day, and
could easily have been doubled. Such another instance of successful statesmanship it would
be difficult, if not impossible, to find.

It is sometimes said that the success of the Hamiltonian system was due to European events,--that
the great wars which grew out of the French Revolution created so extensive demands for our
productions that we must have prospered, no matter what should have been the course of American
political life. What might have been, had the Constitution failed of adoption, it is not necessary
to discuss; but this we know, that the success of Secretary Hamilton's plans was pronounced
and complete before the European wars alluded to began. That success was seen in the early
days of 1791, and war did not commence until 1792; and then it was not waged on that grand
scale to which it subsequently reached. The war between France and England, which affected
this country most, broke out in 1793, two years after Ames had written so encouragingly to
Hamilton, and yet warning him to prepare for the inevitable Nemesis, that "envy of the gods,"
which, according to the Hellenic superstition, but fairly justifiable by innumerable historical
facts, waits on all prosperity and rebukes human wisdom. To us it seems that the most that
can be said of the effect of the wide-spread and long-continued European quarrel on our business
was this,--that it gave to it much of its peculiar character, but did not create it, and was
not necessary to its creation or its continuance. What Hamilton did was to remove depressing
influences from American life and the American mind,--to substitute order for disorder, hope
for fear, and confidence and security for dread and distrust. This was what was done by Hamilton
and his associates; and this done, the native energies of the people did all the rest. It is
all but certain that the extraordinary career of material prosperity that began immediately
after it was seen what was to be our policy under the new polity, would have been essentially
the same, as to the general result, had Europe remained quiet for twenty years longer, and
had there been no downfall of the old French monarchy. The details of American business life
would have been different, but the result would have been pretty much the same as what we have
seen.

Events soon justified the apprehensions of the sensitive, but sagacious Ames. Hamilton's prosperity
bred its natural consequences, and he became the target at which many aspiring men directed
their attacks,--Thomas Jefferson standing at their head. The cause of this, which has been
sought in the French Revolution, in opposition to the supposed centralizing tendencies of the
Hamiltonian policy, and so forth, really lies on the surface. It grew out of men's ambition,
and their desire for power. It was plain to Southern men, that, if Hamilton were permitted
to accomplish his purpose entire, he must become the man of men, and that his influence would
become equal to that of Washington, whose influence they bowed to most unwillingly. Not less
plain was it that power would be with the North. Hence their determination to "break him down,"
which they would have pursued with all their might, had the French Revolution been postponed,
though its occurrence furnished them with means of attack,--the larger part of the American
people sympathizing with the French, while Hamilton shared with Edmund Burke opinions which
time has done much to show were sound; and he was a strenuous supporter of that policy of neutrality
which Washington wisely adopted. The Secretary of the Treasury was assailed by those who envied
and hated him, in various ways. His official integrity was called in question, but the investigations
which he courted led to the confounding of his enemies, while his personal character stood
brighter than ever. So bitter became the opposition that some of their number wished for the
success of the Whiskey Insurrection in Pennsylvania, as Mr. Jefferson's correspondence shows;
and the part which Hamilton had in suppressing that outbreak did not increase their regard
for him. The presence of two such men in Washington's Cabinet as Hamilton and Jefferson made
it the scene of dissension until Jefferson retired.

Hamilton remained in office some time longer; and when he left it, he did so only for personal
reasons. He was poor. He had expended, not only his salary, but almost all the property he
possessed when he took office. The man who had made his country rich had made himself poor
by his devotion to her interests, and had received nothing but vindictive abuse in requital
of his unrivalled labors. He resolved to return to the practice of his profession, which he
never would have left, had he consulted merely his individual interests and those of his family.
Some weeks before he retired, he addressed a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
announcing his purpose, in order that inquiry might be made into the state of his department,
should Congress see fit to make it; but his foes had been so humiliated by the results of the
two inquiries undertaken at their instance, that they would not venture upon a third. In January,
1795, he sent a letter to Congress on the subject of the public credit, which is one of his
ablest productions, full of sound financial doctrine, and showing that he was in advance of
most men on those economical questions the proper settlement of which so closely concerns the
welfare of nations. This letter affords a complete view of the financial history of the government,
and may be considered as Secretary Hamilton's statement of his case to the world. The debt
exceeded $76,000,000, a sum that bore as great a proportion to the revenues of the country
seventy years since as the debt of to-day bears to our present resources. As Hamilton was no
believer in the absurd doctrine that "a national debt is a national blessing," we need say
no more than that he dwelt with emphasis on the necessity of providing for the debt's payment.
It is important to mention that he declared government could not rightfully tax its promises
to pay.

Though Hamilton, as Madison wrote to Jefferson, went to New York "with the word Poverty as
his label," his great reputation rapidly secured for him abundant professional employment.
But he was too important a personage to be able to refrain altogether from political pursuits,
and was forced to defend some of the measures of government, though no longer responsible for
them. He advocated Jay's Treaty, one of the most unpopular measures that ever were carried
through by an honest government in face of the most vehement opposition. Had the treaty been
rejected, war with England would probably have followed, which would have been a profound calamity.
While living in retirement, Hamilton was assailed by his Southern enemies, who were supported
by their Northern allies, their object being to show that he had acted corruptly while at the
head of the Treasury. His reply was as complete a refutation as their earlier calumnies had
encountered. He wrote the celebrated Farewell Address of President Washington. On all occasions
he was ready with pen and tongue to defend and uphold those political principles in the triumph
of which he had that interest which a statesman must ever have in the advancement of truth.

When it was supposed that the French might attempt the invasion of this country, in 1798, preparations
were made to meet them. Washington was made Commander-in-Chief, with the rank of Lieutenant-General;
but he stipulated that he should not be required to take the field save for active service,
and that Hamilton should have the post next to his own, which made the latter actually commander
of the army. He was indefatigable in discharging the duties of this station; but, fortunately,
hostilities with France were confined to the ocean, and the seizure of power in that country
by Bonaparte led to a settlement of the points in dispute. Hamilton again returned to private
life. He could not, however, altogether give up politics, but was forced to take some part
in the exciting political contests of those days. When the Presidential election of 1801 devolved
upon the House of Representatives, he exerted his influence against Burr, whom the Federalists
were inclined to support, preferring him to Jefferson. In 1804 he again labored to defeat Burr's
political aspirations, and prevented his being chosen Governor of New York. Burr was then on
the verge of ruin, and he resolved upon being revenged, and on the destruction of so powerful
a political foe. He required from Hamilton the disavowal of language which there was no evidence
that he ever had used, and so managed the dispute that a duel became inevitable,--reference
being had to the state of public sentiment then prevalent on the subject of honor, and to the
circumstance that duelling was almost as common in New York at that time as it was in any Southern
State just before the Secession War.

The death of Alexander Hamilton was as much the work of assassination as was that of Abraham
Lincoln, in all save the forms that were observed on the occasion. Aaron Burr, of whose actions
he had sometimes spoken with severity,--but not with more severity than is common in all high
party times,[I]--was determined that so bold and able an enemy should be removed from his political
path; and to that end he fastened a duel upon him, and in the meeting that ensued deliberately
shot him. It has been said, that Burr, who was "a good shot" from his youth, and whose nerves
were as brazen as his brow, practised with the pistol for some days before the fatal encounter
took place; and the story is perfectly in character, and helps sustain the position that Hamilton
was assassinated. That Hamilton should have consented to meet such a man, knowing as he did
what was his purpose, and that he was capable of any crime, has often been remarked upon; and
probably his decision will serve to point many a moral for ages, and all the more emphatically
when the force of that opinion in regard to duelling which once was so strong shall not only
have utterly passed away, but have been forgotten, and have become quite incomprehensible to
men who shall live in the light of sounder opinion than prevailed at the beginning of this
century. A soldier, it was reasonable that Hamilton should feel very differently on the point
of honor from a mere civilian, and that he should not have felt himself at liberty to decline
Burr's challenge. He believed that his ability to be useful thereafter in public life would
be greatly lessened, should he not fight. He was particularly thinking of his power to contend
against a scheme for a dissolution of the Union which had been formed in the North, the existence
of which he knew, and also that it was known to Burr, who, had he not committed suicide by
the same act which made him a murderer, would soon have been seen at the head of a rebellion.
The result of the duel was to deprive Burr of all power and influence. He killed Hamilton,
but he fell himself by the same shot that carried death to his opponent; and so complete was
his fall that he never could rise again, though he continued to cumber the earth for more than
thirty-two years. Hamilton's quarrel with Burr, as his son and biographer truly observes, "was
the quarrel of his country. It was the last act in the great drama of his life. It was the
deliberate sacrifice of that life for his country's welfare,--a sacrifice which, by overwhelming
his antagonist with the execrations of the American people, prevented a civil war, and saved
from 'dismemberment' this great republic."

What strikes us most forcibly, in considering Hamilton's career, is the remarkably, early development
of his powers. At thirteen, he was found competent to take charge of a mercantile establishment.
At fifteen, his writings win for him public applause and the aid of friends. At seventeen,
he addresses with success a great public meeting. At eighteen, his anonymous productions are
attributed to some of the leading men of America. At nineteen, he has thought out that principle
of government which is indelibly associated with his name. At twenty, he has not only approved
himself a skilful and courageous soldier, but he has won the esteem of the grave and reserved
Washington, and is placed by that great man in a post of the closest confidence, and which
really makes him the second man in the American service. At twenty-three, he has shown that
he is master of the intricate subject of finance. At twenty-five, after an active military
life that had allowed no time for study, he is known as a lawyer of the first order. At twenty-six,
he is distinguished as a member of Congress. At thirty, he takes a leading part in framing
the Constitution of the United States. And in his thirty-third year, he becomes the most extraordinary
finance minister the world has ever seen. He was statesman, soldier, writer, and orator, and
first in each department; and he was as ready for all the parts which he filled as if he had
been long and studiously trained for each of them by the best of instructors. When Mr. Webster
so happily compared the instantaneousness and perfection of his financial system to "the fabled
birth of Minerva," he did but allude to what is to be remarked of all Hamilton's works. All
that he did was perfect, and no one seems to have been aware of his power until he had established
the fact of its existence. Such a combination of precocity and versatility stands quite unparalleled.
Octavius, William the Third, Henry St. John, Charles James Fox, and William Pitt the younger,
all showed various powers at early periods of their lives; but not one of them was the equal
of Hamilton in respect to early maturity of intellect, or in ability to command success in
every department to which he turned his attention. The historical character of whom he most
reminds us is the elder Africanus. In the early development of his faculties, in his self-reliant
spirit, in his patriotism, in his kingliness of mind, in his personal purity, in his generosity
of thought and of action, and in the fear and envy that he excited in inferior minds, he was
a repetition of the most majestic of all the Romans. But, unlike the Roman soldier-statesman,
he did not desert the land he had saved, but which had proved ungrateful; and the grave only
was to be his Liternum. He died at not far from the same age as that to which Africanus reached.
In comparing him with certain other men who achieved fame early, it should be remembered that
they all were regularly prepared for public life, and were born to it as to an inheritance;
whereas he, though of patrician blood, was possessed of no advantages of fortune, and had to
fight the battle of life while fighting the battles of the nation.

FOOTNOTES:

[F] Mr. Riethmüller, in his volume on "Hamilton and his Contemporaries," coolly assumes that
Hamilton would have opposed the late war for the maintenance of the Union, had he been living!
Anything more absurd than such a view of Hamilton's probable course, under circumstances like
those which occurred in 1861, it would be impossible to imagine. Hamilton would have been the
firmest supporter of the war, had he lived to see it, or had such a war broken out in his time.
His principles would have led him to be for extreme measures. It is easy to see why Mr. Riethmüller
thus misrepresents Hamilton's opinions. Living in London, where it is thought that every foreign
nation should submit to destruction, if that be desirable to England, he wrote under the influence
of the place. The English do not take the same view of Secession, when it comes home to them.
They think as unfavorably of that repeal of the Union which the Irish demand as we thought
of that dissolution of our Union which South Carolinians demanded; and they moved against the
Fenians much earlier than we moved against the Carolinians. Mr. Riethmüller's assumption is
pointedly disclaimed by General Hamilton's representatives, who declare that it is a palpable
misrepresentation of their father's views: and no one who is familiar with Hamilton's writings
and history can honestly say that they are wrong. To say that Andrew Jackson, who crushed Nullification,
would have been a Secessionist, had he been living in 1861, would be a moderate assertion,
compared to that which places Alexander Hamilton in the list of possible Secessionists, had
he survived to Secession times. Seven Volumes. 8vo. New York: D. Appleton & Co. A work in every
respect deserving of the closest and most attentive study, replete as it is with valuable and
well-arranged matter and able writing.

[H] The Federalist: a Commentary on the Constitution of the United States. A Collection of
Essays, by Alexander Hamilton, Jay, and Madison. Also, The Continentalist and other Papers,
by Hamilton. Edited by John C. Hamilton, Author of "The Republic of the United States." 1 vol.
8vo. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co.--This is by far the best edition of "The Federalist"
that has appeared, and should alone be consulted and read by Hamilton's admirers. The Historical
Notice with which Mr. Hamilton has prefaced it is a noble production, and worthy of the subject
and of his name. This has been called affectation; but we have no doubt that Burr uttered the
truth in the sentences quoted. He was exactly the man to observe the rules of decorum, and
those of honor, as he understood them, in political warfare. The strong language that is so
common in political disputes is proof as much of the abundance of men's sincerity as it is
of their want of good breeding. They are honestly moved by the evil words or deeds, or both,
or what they consider such, of their opponents, and speak of them coarsely. The man who is
indifferent to all opinions, principles, and actions, but who is nevertheless ambitious, is
never tempted to the utterance of disparaging language concerning his political foes. He may
laugh at their zeal, but he cannot be offended by it. Burr was utterly indifferent to all political
principle. He never really belonged to any party, and was as ready to act with Federalists
as with Democrats; and it was only through the force of circumstances that he did act generally
with the latter. A party man never would have done as Burr saw fit to do when the Presidential
election of 1801 devolved on the House of Representatives. The party to which he professed
to belong intended, as everybody knew, that Jefferson should be President; and yet Burr allowed
himself to be used against Jefferson. That "all is fair in politics" was his creed. He may
have been "a man of honor," but what Lord Macaulay says of Avaux is strictly applicable to
him, namely,--"that of the difference between right and wrong he had no more notion than a brute."

REVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES.

Memoirs of the Life of William Shakespeare, with an Essay toward the Expression of his Genius,
and an Account of the Rise and Progress of the English Drama to the Time of Shakespeare. By
RICHARD GRANT WHITE. Boston: Little, Brown, & Co.

Mr. White's closing-up of his Shakespeare labors has been long in coming, but comes good and
acceptable at last. The volume now in hand, however, does not form a part of his edition of
the poet; it stands by itself; though a portion of its contents is repeated in the first volume
(the last published) of this edition. It is rich in matter, and the workmanship, for the most
part, capital. All Shakespearians are bound to relish it; and if any general reader does not
find it delectable, he may well suspect some fault in himself.

In his "Memoirs," the author of course adds nothing to what was already known of the poet's
life. But his presentation of the matter is eminently readable, and, in parts, decidedly interesting;
which is as much as can fairly be looked for in any writing on that subject. Some readers may
think, we do think, that the author is a little at fault on one or two points. For instance,
he overworks certain questions touching the poet's wife, worrying up the matter against her
to the utmost, and, in fact, tormenting the poor woman's memory in such a way as to indicate
something very like spite. Now this is not fair; and Mr. White's general fairness on other
subjects makes his proceeding the less excusable in this case.

Of course everybody knows that Mrs. Anne Shakespeare was some eight years older than her husband;
that the circumstances of the marriage were not altogether what they should have been; and
that the oldest daughter was born a little too soon for the credit of either parent. This is
all, all, there is known about the matter. And if conjecture or inference must be at work on
these facts, surely it had better run in the direction of charity, especially of charity towards
the weaker vessel. We say weaker vessel, because in this case the man must, in all fairness,
be supposed to have had the advantage, at least as much in strength of natural understanding
as the woman had in years. And as Shakespeare was, by all accounts, a very attractive person,
it does not well appear but that the woman had as good a right to lose her heart in his company
as he had to lose his head in hers. Yet our author insinuates, perhaps we should say more than
insinuates, that the lady immodestly angled for and seduced the youthful lover, and entangled
his honor in an obligation of marriage; and he seems quite positive that the poet afterwards
hated her, and took refuge in London partly to escape from her society. Now all this is sheer
conjecture; it has no basis of fact or of fair likelihood to stand upon; there is not so much
as a particle even of tradition to support it. Rowe hints nothing of the sort; and surely his
candor would not have spared the parties, if he had found anything: it was the very point of
all others on which scandal would have been most apt to fasten and feed; and yet even Aubrey,
arrant old gossip as he was, supplies nothing to justify it.

In default of other grounds, resort has been had to certain passages in the poet's dramas.
And Mr. White, though knowing, none better, the poet's wonderful self-aloofness from his representations,
thinks it worth the while to make an exception in this particular case. Presuming such and
such things to be true in his own experience, the poet, our author observes, must have thought
of them while writing certain passages. Our answer is, To be sure, he must have thought of
them, and he must have known that others would think of them too; and a reasonable delicacy
on his part would have counselled the withholding of anything that he was conscious might be
applied to his own domestic affairs. Does not Mr. White see that his inferences in this are
just the reverse of what they should be?

But we are dwelling too long on this point; and we confess something of impatience at Mr. White's
treatment of it. His animus in the thing is shown, perhaps, in one slight mistake he has made.
Speaking of the lady's haste to "provide herself with a husband," he says, "In less than five
months after she obtained one she was delivered of a daughter." The bishop's license for the
marriage was dated November 28th, 1582, and Susannah Shakespeare was baptized May 26th, 1583;
thus leaving an interval of but two days short of six months between the marriage and the birth.
As Sir Hugh observes, "I like not when a 'oman has a great peard." But are not the men of his
later plays quite as much superior to the men of his first? Unquestionably they are. Are not
his later plays as much better every way, as in respect of the female characters? Mr. White
is too wise and too ripe in the theme to question it. But if there must be any conjecturing
about it, we prefer to conjecture that the poet caught his ideas of womanhood, or at least
the rudiments of them, from his mother, and other specimens of the sex in his native town.
The poet's mind did not stay on the surface of things. He had the head to know, and the heart
to feel, the claims of humble, modest worth; for, as he was the wisest, so was he also the
most human-hearted of men. And, indeed, if his great social heart had found all the best delights
of society in London, how should he have been so desirous, as Mr. White allows he was, to escape
from the city, and set up his rest in his Stratford home?

Mr. White's history of the Drama, though far from copious, supplies enough, perhaps, to put
the reader right as regards Shakespeare's historical relations to that great branch of English
literature. From what is there given, any one can, with reasonable attention, learn that the
English drama, as we have it in Shakespeare, was the well-ripened fruit of centuries of preparation:
the form, structure, and order of the thing being settled long before his time. The attentive
reader will also see, though this point is not emphasized so much as it might be, that the
national mind and taste were ready and eager to welcome the right man as soon as the right
man came; so that, in catering wisely for the public taste, the poet could hardly fail of the
supremacy due to his transcendent genius; which infers, of course, that the public taste had
nearly as much to do in forming him as he had in forming it. On one or two points, as, for
instance, in the matter of Shakespeare's senior contemporaries, we should have preferred a
somewhat larger outlay of the author's learned and well-practised strength; while, again, in
reference to the old plays of "Jeronimo" and "The Spanish Tragedy," he might well have used
more economy of strength, as the matter is neither interesting in itself nor helpful to his
purpose. Here is a specimen of his felicity, referring to the plays of old John Lily, the euphuist.

"They are in all respects opposed to the genius of the English drama. They do not even pretend
to be representations of human life and human character, but are pure fantasy pieces, in which
the personages are a heterogeneous medley of Grecian gods and goddesses, and impassible, colorless
creatures, with sublunary names, all thinking with one brain, and speaking with one tongue,--the
conceitful, crotchety brain, and the dainty, well-trained tongue of clever, witty John Lily."

This is, indeed, the exact truth of the matter, and it could hardly be better said. On divers
points, however, the little that he gives us just sets the reader on fire for more: that is,
he does not satisfy the desire quite enough in proportion as he stimulates it. But he probably
goes on the safe principle, that in such cases an intelligent reader is apt to crave more than
he will justify a writer in giving; or, in other words, that he does not seem to have enough,
until he has too much.

But the "Essay" is most decidedly the jewel of the volume: not, however, to disparage the other
parts; for it is worthy to be the jewel of anybody's volume. A single reading of the "Essay,"
as it ought to be read, will suffice to make any one glad to own the book, and will almost
certainly induce him to mark it down for a second reading, as the second also will for a third.
The work, indeed, is a positive, and we think it will prove a permanent addition to our already
opulent inheritance of Shakespearian criticism. It is weighty throughout with fresh, yet sober
and well-considered thought, expressed in tight and sinewy English,--every part being highly
elaborate, but nothing over-labored. The author discusses a large number of topics, all in
"a manly style, fitted to manly ears," but is particularly full and instructive in regard to
the poet's language and style: a rich field, indeed, which has not been proportionably cultivated
by the poet's later critics, who have put their force mainly on what may be called his dramatic
architecture, and on his development of character, where there is more room to be philosophical,
but less chance of determinate results. Over this field Mr. White walks with the firm, yet
graceful step of a master: his current of thought running deep, strong, and clear, and carrying
us through page after page full of nice and subtile discrimination, without over-refinement,
and of illustrations apt and luminous, yet without a touch of false brilliancy or mere smartness;
which is saying a good deal, in these days of high-pressure rhetoric.

We commend the "Essay" to all lovers of solid and well-proportioned critical discourse.
