The little honesty that exists among authors is discernible in the unconscionable way they
misquote from the writings of others. I find whole passages in my works wrongly quoted, and
it is only in my appendix, which is absolutely lucid, that an exception is made. The misquotation
is frequently due to carelessness, the pen of such people has been used to write down such
trivial and banal phrases that it goes on writing them out of force of habit. Sometimes the
misquotation is due to impertinence on the part of some one who wants to improve upon my work;
but a bad motive only too often prompts the misquotation--it is then horrid baseness and roguery,
and, like a man who commits forgery, he loses the character for being an honest man for ever.

Style is the physiognomy of the mind. It is a more reliable key to character than the physiognomy
of the body. To imitate another person's style is like wearing a mask. However fine the mask,
it soon becomes insipid and intolerable because it is without life; so that even the ugliest
living face is better. Therefore authors who write in Latin and imitate the style of the old
writers essentially wear a mask; one certainly hears what they say, but one cannot watch their
physiognomy--that is to say their style. One observes, however, the style in the Latin writings
of men who think for themselves, those who have not deigned to imitate, as, for instance, Scotus
Erigena, Petrarch, Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, etc.

Affectation in style is like making grimaces. The language in which a man writes is the physiognomy
of his nation; it establishes a great many differences, beginning from the language of the
Greeks down to that of the Caribbean islanders.

We should seek for the faults in the style of another author's works, so that we may avoid
committing the same in our own.

In order to get a provisional estimate of the value of an author's productions it is not exactly
necessary to know the matter on which he has thought or what it is he has thought about it,--this
would compel one to read the whole of his works,--but it will be sufficient to know how he
has thought. His style is an exact expression of how he has thought, of the essential state
and general quality of his thoughts. It shows the formal nature--which must always remain the
same--of all the thoughts of a man, whatever the subject on which he has thought or what it
is he has said about it. It is the dough out of which all his ideas are kneaded, however various
they may be. When Eulenspiegel was asked by a man how long he would have to walk before reaching
the next place, and gave the apparently absurd answer Walk, his intention was to judge from
the man's walking how far he would go in a given time. And so it is when I have read a few
pages of an author, I know about how far he can help me.

In the secret consciousness that this is the condition of things, every mediocre writer tries
to mask his own natural style. This instantly necessitates his giving up all idea of being
na�ve, a privilege which belongs to superior minds sensible of their superiority, and therefore
sure of themselves. For instance, it is absolutely impossible for men of ordinary intelligence
to make up their minds to write as they think; they resent the idea of their work looking too
simple. It would always be of some value, however. If they would only go honestly to work and
in a simple way express the few and ordinary ideas they have really thought, they would be
readable and even instructive in their own sphere. But instead of that they try to appear to
have thought much more deeply than is the case. The result is, they put what they have to say
into forced and involved language, create new words and prolix periods which go round the thought
and cover it up. They hesitate between the two attempts of communicating the thought and of
concealing it. They want to make it look grand so that it has the appearance of being learned
and profound, thereby giving one the idea that there is much more in it than one perceives
at the moment. Accordingly, they sometimes put down their thoughts in bits, in short, equivocal,
and paradoxical sentences which appear to mean much more than they say (a splendid example
of this kind of writing is furnished by Schelling's treatises on Natural Philosophy); sometimes
they express their thoughts in a crowd of words and the most intolerable diffuseness, as if
it were necessary to make a sensation in order to make the profound meaning of their phrases
intelligible--while it is quite a simple idea if not a trivial one (examples without number
are supplied in Fichte's popular works and in the philosophical pamphlets of a hundred other
miserable blockheads that are not worth mentioning), or else they endeavour to use a certain
style in writing which it has pleased them to adopt--for example, a style that is so thoroughly
Kat' e'xochae'u profound and scientific, where one is tortured to death by the narcotic effect
of long-spun periods that are void of all thought (examples of this are specially supplied
by those most impertinent of all mortals, the Hegelians in their Hegel newspaper commonly known
as Jahrb�cher der wissenschaftlichen Literatur); or again, they aim at an intellectual style
where it seems then as if they wish to go crazy, and so on. All such efforts whereby they try
to postpone the nascetur ridiculus mus make it frequently difficult to understand what they
really mean. Moreover, they write down words, nay, whole periods, which mean nothing in themselves,
in the hope, however, that some one else will understand something from them. Nothing else
is at the bottom of all such endeavours but the inexhaustible attempt which is always venturing
on new paths, to sell words for thoughts, and by means of new expressions, or expressions used
in a new sense, turns of phrases and combinations of all kinds, to produce the appearance of
intellect in order to compensate for the want of it which is so painfully felt. It is amusing
to see how, with this aim in view, first this mannerism and then that is tried; these they
intend to represent the mask of intellect: this mask may possibly deceive the inexperienced
for a while, until it is recognised as being nothing but a dead mask, when it is laughed at
and exchanged for another.

We find a writer of this kind sometimes writing in a dithyrambic style, as if he were intoxicated;
at other times, nay, on the very next page, he will be high-sounding, severe, and deeply learned,
prolix to the last degree of dulness, and cutting everything very small, like the late Christian
Wolf, only in a modern garment. The mask of unintelligibility holds out the longest; this is
only in Germany, however, where it was introduced by Fichte, perfected by Schelling, and attained
its highest climax finally in Hegel, always with the happiest results. And yet nothing is easier
than to write so that no one can understand; on the other hand, nothing is more difficult than
to express learned ideas so that every one must understand them. All the arts I have cited
above are superfluous if the writer really possesses any intellect, for it allows a man to
show himself as he is and verifies for all time what Horace said: Scribendi recte sapere est
et principium et fons.

But this class of authors is like certain workers in metal, who try a hundred different compositions
to take the place of gold, which is the only metal that can never have a substitute. On the
contrary, there is nothing an author should guard against more than the apparent endeavour
to show more intellect than he has; because this rouses the suspicion in the reader that he
has very little, since a man always affects something, be its nature what it may, that he does
not really possess. And this is why it is praise to an author to call him na�ve, for it signifies
that he may show himself as he is. In general, na�vet� attracts, while anything that is unnatural
everywhere repels. We also find that every true thinker endeavours to express his thoughts
as purely, clearly, definitely, and concisely as ever possible. This is why simplicity has
always been looked upon as a token, not only of truth, but also of genius. Style receives its
beauty from the thought expressed, while with those writers who only pretend to think it is
their thoughts that are said to be fine because of their style. Style is merely the silhouette
of thought; and to write in a vague or bad style means a stupid or confused mind.

Hence, the first rule--nay, this in itself is almost sufficient for a good style--is this,
that the author should have something to say. Ah! this implies a great deal. The neglect of
this rule is a fundamental characteristic of the philosophical, and generally speaking of all
the reflective authors in Germany, especially since the time of Fichte. It is obvious that
all these writers wish to appear to have something to say, while they have nothing to say.
This mannerism was introduced by the pseudo-philosophers of the Universities and may be discerned
everywhere, even among the first literary notabilities of the age. It is the mother of that
forced and vague style which seems to have two, nay, many meanings, as well as of that prolix
and ponderous style, le stile empes�; and of that no less useless bombastic style, and finally
of that mode of concealing the most awful poverty of thought under a babble of inexhaustible
chatter that resembles a clacking mill and is just as stupefying: one may read for hours together
without getting hold of a single clearly defined and definite idea. The Halleschen, afterwards
called the Deutschen Jahrb�cher, furnishes almost throughout excellent examples of this style
of writing. The Germans, by the way, from force of habit read page after page of all kinds
of such verbiage without getting any definite idea of what the author really means: they think
it all very proper and do not discover that he is writing merely for the sake of writing. On
the other hand, a good author who is rich in ideas soon gains the reader's credit of having
really and truly something to say; and this gives the intelligent reader patience to follow
him attentively. An author of this kind will always express himself in the simplest and most
direct manner, for the very reason that he really has something to say; because he wishes to
awaken in the reader the same idea he has in his own mind and no other. Accordingly he will
be able to say with Boileau--

  "Ma pens�e au grand jour partout s'offre et s'expose,
  Et mon vers, bien ou mal, dit toujours quelque chose;"

while of those previously described writers it may be said, in the words of the same poet,
et qui parlant beaucoup ne disent jamais rien. It is also a characteristic of such writers
to avoid, if it is possible, expressing themselves definitely, so that they may be always able
in case of need to get out of a difficulty; this is why they always choose the more abstract
expressions: while people of intellect choose the more concrete; because the latter bring the
matter closer to view, which is the source of all evidence. This preference for abstract expressions
may be confirmed by numerous examples: a specially ridiculous example is the following. Throughout
German literature of the last ten years we find "to condition" almost everywhere used in place
of "to cause" or "to effect." Since it is more abstract and indefinite it says less than it
implies, and consequently leaves a little back door open to please those whose secret consciousness
of their own incapacity inspires them with a continual fear of all definite expressions. While
with other people it is merely the effect of that national tendency to immediately imitate
everything that is stupid in literature and wicked in life; this is shown in either case by
the quick way in which it spreads. The Englishman depends on his own judgment both in what
he writes and what he does, but this applies less to the German than to any other nation. In
consequence of the state of things referred to, the words "to cause" and "to effect" have almost
entirely disappeared from the literature of the last ten years, and people everywhere talk
of "to condition." The fact is worth mentioning because it is characteristically ridiculous.
Everyday authors are only half conscious when they write, a fact which accounts for their want
of intellect and the tediousness of their writings; they do not really themselves understand
the meaning of their own words, because they take ready-made words and learn them. Hence they
combine whole phrases more than words--phrases banales. This accounts for that obviously characteristic
want of clearly defined thought; in fact, they lack the die that stamps their thoughts, they
have no clear thought of their own; in place of it we find an indefinite, obscure interweaving
of words, current phrases, worn-out terms of speech, and fashionable expressions. The result
is that their foggy kind of writing is like print that has been done with old type. On the
other hand, intelligent people really speak to us in their writings, and this is why they are
able to both move and entertain us. It is only intelligent writers who place individual words
together with a full consciousness of their use and select them with deliberation. Hence their
style of writing bears the same relation to that of those authors described above, as a picture
that is really painted does to one that has been executed with stencil. In the first instance
every word, just as every stroke of the brush, has some special significance, while in the
other everything is done mechanically. The same distinction may be observed in music. For it
is the omnipresence of intellect that always and everywhere characterises the works of the
genius; and analogous to this is Lichtenberg's observation, namely, that Garrick's soul was
omnipresent in all the muscles of his body. With regard to the tediousness of the writings
referred to above, it is to be observed in general that there are two kinds of tediousness--an
objective and a subjective. The objective form of tediousness springs from the deficiency of
which we have been speaking--that is to say, where the author has no perfectly clear thought
or knowledge to communicate. For if a writer possesses any clear thought or knowledge it will
be his aim to communicate it, and he will work with this end in view; consequently the ideas
he furnishes are everywhere clearly defined, so that he is neither diffuse, unmeaning, nor
confused, and consequently not tedious. Even if his fundamental idea is wrong, yet in such
a case it will be clearly thought out and well pondered; in other words, it is at least formally
correct, and the writing is always of some value. While, for the same reason, a work that is
objectively tedious is at all times without value. Again, subjective tediousness is merely
relative: this is because the reader is not interested in the subject of the work, and that
what he takes an interest in is of a very limited nature. The most excellent work may therefore
be tedious subjectively to this or that person, just as, vice vers�, the worst work may be
subjectively diverting to this or that person: because he is interested in either the subject
or the writer of the book.
