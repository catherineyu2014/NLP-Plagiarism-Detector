BEING AN

EXCITEMENT TO READING.

FOR

YOUNG PEOPLE.

A NEW AND CONDENSED EDITION.

PREFACE.

The object of this Volume is that of inducing young people to read, to cultivate in them a
habit of reading and reflection, and to excite the imagination, the feelings, and the better
emotions of their nature in a pleasurable and judicious manner.

The pieces selected are such as will be likely to exert a beneficial influence upon the reader,
to inspire him with heroic enthusiasm, and to lead him to despise danger.

In our perpetually migrating population, no one can tell who will not be called upon to brave
the vicissitudes of "flood and field;" and to show how perils may be surmounted, and privations
endured with energy and patience, is to teach no unimportant lesson.

Nothing whatever has been introduced into this Volume, but such subjects as will teach a dependence
upon Divine Providence, in aid of self-reliance and self-sacrifice, while details of war and
bloodshed have been studiously avoided.

~Arabian Hospitality--African Warfare, &c.~

The following three extracts are from a work of considerable merit, intitled "The Crescent
and the Cross." It contains, not only much valuable matter relative to Egypt and Abyssinia,
but many interesting anecdotes, of which we give a specimen.

HOSPITALITY OF THE ARAB.

In 1804, Osman Bardissy was the most influential of the Mameluke Beys, and virtually governed
Egypt. Mehemet Ali, then rising into power, succeeded in embroiling this powerful old chief
with Elfy Bey, another of the Mamelukes. The latter escaped to England, where he was favourably
received, and promised assistance by our government against Osman, who was in the French interests.
At this time a Sheikh of Bedouin stood high in Osman's confidence, and brought him intelligence
that Elfy had landed at Alexandria. "Go, then," said the old Bey, "surprise his boat, and slay
him on his way up the river; his spoil shall be your reward." The Sheikh lay in wait upon the
banks of the Delta, and slew all the companions of the rival Bey: Elfy himself escaped in the
darkness, and made his way to an Arab encampment before sunrise. Going straight to the Sheikh's
tent, which is known by a spear standing in front of it, he entered, and hastily devoured some
bread that he found there. The Sheikh was absent; but his wife exclaimed, on seeing the fugitive,
"I know you, Elfy Bey, and my husband's life, perhaps at his moment, depends upon his taking
yours. Rest now and refresh yourself, then take the best horse you can find, and fly. The moment
you are out of our horizon, the tribe will be in pursuit of you." The Bey escaped to the Thebaid,
and the disappointed Sheikh presented himself to his employer. Osman passionately demanded
of him if it was true that his wife had saved the life of his deadliest enemy, when in her
power. "Most true, praised be Allah!" replied the Sheikh, drawing himself proudly up, and presenting
a jewel-hilted dagger to the old Bey; "this weapon," he continued, "was your gift to me in
the hour of your favour; had I met Elfy Bey, it should have freed you from your enemy. Had
my wife betrayed the hospitality of the tent, it should have drank her blood; and now, you
may use it against myself," he added, as he flung it at the Mameluke's feet. This reverence
for hospitality is one of the wild virtues that has survived from the days of the patriarchs,
and it is singularly contrasted, yet interwoven with other and apparently opposite tendencies.
The Arab will rob you, if he is able; he will even murder you, if it suits his purpose; but,
once under the shelter of his tribe's black tents, or having eaten of his salt by the wayside,
you have as much safety in his company as his heart's blood can purchase for you. The Bedouins
are extortionate to strangers, dishonest to each other, and reckless of human life. On the
other hand, they are faithful to their trust, brave after their fashion, temperate, and patient
of hardship and privation beyond belief. Their sense of right and wrong is not founded on the
Decalogue, as may be well imagined, yet, from such principles as they profess they rarely swerve.
Though they will freely risk their lives to steal, they will not contravene the wild rule of
the desert. If a wayfarer's camel sinks and dies beneath its burden, the owner draws a circle
round the animal in the sand, and follows the caravan. No Arab will presume to touch that lading,
however tempting. Dr. Robinson mentions that he saw a tent hanging from a tree near Mount Sinai,
which his Arabs said had then been there a twelvemonth, and never would be touched until its
owner returned in search of it.
