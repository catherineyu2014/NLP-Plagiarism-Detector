CHARIVARIA.

WILLIAM HOHENZOLLERN is reported to be busy sawing trees. Some declare that his energy is due
to an hallucination that they are German generals. Others say the whole story is a clumsy attempt
to discredit him with the Labour party.

       ***

Dublin Corporation has decided to increase its revenue by eight thousand pounds by raising
the charge on water. Citizens are urged to put patriotism before prejudice and give the stuff
a trial.

       ***

The inconveniences that attend influenza reached their climax a few days ago when an occupant
of a crowded tube train blew the nose of the man next to him in mistake for his own.

       ***

The beggar who has been going about telling a pitiful story of being wounded by a trench-mortar
during the Jutland battle is now regarded by the police as an impostor.

       ***

A defendant in a County Court case at Liverpool last week stated in his evidence that he had
been on the telephone for the last twenty years. In fairness to the Postal authorities he should
have admitted that it was a trunk call.

       ***

       ***

A lady-correspondent, writing to a daily paper, laments the fact that the War has changed a
great many husbands. Surely the wife who receives the wrong husband can get some sort of redress
from the War Office.

       ***

All the main-line railways are to be electrified, Sir ERIC GEDDES told the House of Commons.
Meanwhile he has successfully electrified all the old buffers.

       ***

A number of women are doing good work as mates on Medway sailing barges. The denial of the
report that one of them recently looked at a Wapping policeman for five minutes on end without
once repeating herself may be ascribed to professional jealousy.

       ***

"The small car," says a trade contemporary, "has come to stop." We can well believe it. It
is an old habit.

       ***

It has been discovered that the new Education Act, which prohibits boys under twelve being
worked for more than two hours on Sunday, may apply to choir-boys. A Commission, we understand,
is to be called upon to decide finally whether they are really boys or just little demons.

       ***

A man who applied to the Bloomsbury County Court for relief against an eviction order stated
that he could find no other suitable house, as he had nine children under fourteen years of
age. His residential problem remains unsolved, but we understand, with regard to the other
difficulty, that the Board of Works has offered to sell him a card index at considerably below
cost.

       ***

"Bridegrooms," says a contemporary, "are discovering that weddings cost more." The growing
practice among fathers-in-law of delivering their daughters "free at rail," instead of, as
formerly, "from house to house," may have something to do with it.

       ***

"Ramsgate," says The Daily Mail, "is racing Margate in Thanet's reconstruction." At present
Margate still claims to lead by one nigger and two winkle-barrows.

       ***

The Colorado Legislature has passed a resolution in favour of Irish independence. The remark
attributed to Mr. A.J. BALFOUR, that he always thought Colorado was the name of a twopenny
cigar, has failed to make the situation easier.

       ***

"A pupil at a West London 'out-of-work' school," says a news item, "daily attends his studies
in an opera-hat." On being informed of this fact, Sir THOMAS BEECHAM is reported to have expressed
the opinion that its significance was obvious.

       ***

President WILSON, it is announced, hopes to visit Scotland shortly for some golf. He believes
that some adjustment of the dispute as to the respective merits of the running-up and pitch-and-stop
methods of approach should be embodied in the Peace terms if international harmony is to be
really secured.

       ***

Primroses and crocuses are blooming in North London. Pending an official announcement by The
Daily Mail people are requested to accept this as a preliminary Spring.

       ***

Concrete ships, says a Government official, can be made in moulds. But of course you must not
forget to grease the tin.

       ***

A Sinn Feiner, arriving home in Crossgar, Co. Down, last week, had a very hearty welcome. Thirteen
spectators and seven policemen were injured.

       ***

Many members of the Bar are greatly afraid that some learned judge will ask, "What is the Jazz-step?"
before the question has really been settled by the dancers themselves.

       ***

The young lady who, on receiving a proposal of marriage over the telephone last week, replied,
"Yes, who's speaking?" turns out to be an ex-typist recently demobilised from the Air Ministry.

       ***

It is interesting to note that to-day is the anniversary of the day that was not a Flag-day
last year.

    ----), ship agent. Last heard of 30 years ago."--Glasgow Paper.

THE PRELIMINARY DOVE: ITS PROSPECTS.

  Within a little week or two,
    So all our sanguine prints declare,
  The Dove (or Bird of Peace) is due
    To spread its wings and take the air,
      Like Mr. THOMAS when he flew
      Across the firmamental blue
      To join the PREMIER in communion
      Touching the Railway Workers' Union.

  We've waited many a weary week
    With bulging eyes and fevered brow,
  While WILSON pressed upon its beak
    His League-of-Nations' olive bough,
      Wondering what amount of weight
      Its efforts could negotiate,
      How much, in fact, the bird would stand
      Without collapsing on the land.

  And, even though it should contrive
    To keep its pinions on the flap,
  And by a tour de force survive
    This devastating handicap,
      Yet are there perils in the skies
      Whereon we blandly shut our eyes,
      But which are bound to be incurred,
      And, notably, the Bolshy-bird.

  This brand of vulture, most obscene,
    May have designs upon the Dove;
  Its carrion taste was never keen
    On the Millennial reign of Love;
      And I, for one, am stiff with fear
      About our little friend's career,
      Lest that disgusting fowl should maul
      And eat it, olive-branch and all.

  I mention this to mark the quaint
    Notion of "Peace" the public has,
  That wants to smear the Town with paint,
    To whoop and jubilate and jazz;
      And while our flappers beat the floor
      There's Russia soaked in seas of gore,
      And LENIN waxing beastly fat;
      Nobody seems to think of that.

O.S.

Reminiscences.

"You do things so sketchily and casually," said FRITH to WHISTLER one day. "Now when I paint
a picture I take pains. 'The Derby Day' cost me weeks and months of sleeplessness. I did nothing
else; I gave my whole mind to it." "Oh," said WHISTLER, "that's where it's gone to, is it?"

When Mr. BERNARD SHAW made his tour of the ports in order to popularise Socialism in the Navy,
he was courteously received at Portsmouth by Sir HEDWORTH MEUX. The talk happened to turn on
the theatre, and the Admiral was candid enough to confess himself somewhat at sea with regard
to the merits of contemporary writers. "Now, Mr. SHAW," he said in his breezy way, "I wish
you would tell me who is the most eminent of the playwrights of to-day?" "Ay, ay, Sir," said
Mr. SHAW promptly.
