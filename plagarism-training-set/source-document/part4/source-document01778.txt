The amount of absolutely new information in this work is very large. Thus we are telling for
the first time the history of Burton's friendships with Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot, Mr. John Payne,
and others; and we are giving for the first time, too, a complete and accurate history of the
translation of The Arabian Nights, The Scented Garden, and other works. Hundreds of new facts
are recorded respecting these and other absorbing topics, while the citations from the unpublished
letters of Burton and Lady Burton will, we are sure, receive a welcome. We are able to give
about fifty entirely new anecdotes--many of them extremely piquant and amusing. We also tell
the touching story of Burton's brother Edward. In our accounts of Burton's travels will be
found a number of interesting facts and some anecdotes not given in Burton's works.

The new material has been derived from many sources--but from ten in particular.

   (1) From two hundred unpublished letters of Sir Richard Burton
and Lady Burton.

   (2) From interviews with Mrs. E. J. Burton [3] and
Mr. F. Burton (Burton's cousins), Mr. John Payne, Mrs. Arbuthnot,
Mr. Watts-Dunton, Mr. W. F. Kirby, Mr. A. G. Ellis, Dr. Codrington,
Professor James F. Blumhardt, Mr. Henry R. Tedder (librarian and
secretary of The Athenaeum, Burton's club), Mrs. Baddeley (mother of
Burton's friend, St. Clair Baddeley), Madame Nicastro (sister of the
late Mr. Albert Letchford, illustrator of The Arabian Nights), Dr.
Grenfell Baker (Burton's medical attendant during the last three years
of his life), and many other ladies and gentlemen.

   (3) From letters received from Major St. George Burton (to whom
I have the pleasure of dedicating this work), Lady Bancroft, Mr. D.
MacRitchie, Mr. E. S. Mostyn Pryce (representative of Miss Stisted),
Gunley Hall, Staffordshire, M. Charles Carrington, of Paris, who sent me
various notes, including an account of Burton's unfinished translation
of Apuleius's Golden Ass, the MS. of which is in his possession, the
Very Rev. J. P. Canon McCarthy, of Ilkeston, for particulars of
"The Shrine of our Lady of Dale," Mr. Segrave (son of Burton's "dear
Louisa"), Mrs. Agg (Burton's cousin), and Mr. P. P. Cautley (Burton's
colleague at Trieste). Nor must I omit reference to a kind letter
received from Mrs. Van Zeller, Lady Burton's only surviving sister. [4]

   (4) From the Burton collections in the Free Libraries of
Camberwell and Kensington.

   (5) From unpublished manuscripts written by Burton's friends.

   (6) From the church registers of Elstree.  By examination of
these and other documents I have been able to correct many mistakes.

   (7) From the manuscripts of F. F. Arbuthnot and the Oriental
scholar, Edward Rehatsek. These are now in the possession of the Royal
Asiatic Society.

   (8) From Mr. Arbuthnot's typewritten and unpublished Life of
Balzac now in my possession. This contains many notes throwing light on
the Burton and Arbuthnot friendship.

   (9) From the Genealogical Table of the Burtons of Shap,
very kindly sent me by Mr. E. S. Mostyn Pryce.

   (10) From various persons interviewed during many journeys.
One of these journeys (June 1905) took me, of course, to the Tomb of
Mortlake, and I was gratified to find that, owing to the watchfulness of
the Arundell family, it is kept in perfect repair. [5]

Let me first speak of the unpublished letters. These were lent me by Mr. John Payne (40 letters),
Mr. W. F. Kirby (50 letters), Major St. George Burton, Mrs. E. J. Burton, Mrs. Agg, Mr. Mostyn
Pryce, Dr. Tuckey, Mr. D. MacRitchie, and Mr. A. G. Ellis. Many of the letters reveal Burton
in quite a new light. His patriotism and his courage were known of all men, but the womanly
tenderness of his nature and his intense love for his friends will come to many as a surprise.
His distress, for example, on hearing of the death of Drake, [6] is particularly affecting.

Of the friends of Sir Richard Burton who have been interviewed I must mention first of all
Mr. John Payne. But for Mr. Payne's generous assistance, this work I must frankly admit, could
not have been written. He, and he alone, held the keys to whole chambers of mystery. Mr. Payne
was at first extremely reluctant to give me the material required. Indeed, in his first letter
of reply to my request for information (7th August 1904) he declined positively either to enter
the lists against Burton, with whom, he said, he had been on terms of intimate friendship,
or to discuss the matter at all. "As for what," he said, "it pleases the public to think (save
the mark!) of the relative merits of my own and Burton's translations, I have long ceased to
care a straw." But this led me to write even more pressingly. I assured Mr. Payne that the
public had been unjust to him simply because nobody had hitherto set himself the great task
of comparing the two translations, and because the true history of the case had never been
laid before them. I assured him that I yielded to nobody in admiration of Sir Richard Burton--that
is, on account of what he (Sir Richard) did do, not on account of what he did not do; and I
gave it as my opinion that Mr. Payne owed it both to the public and to himself to lay bare
the whole story. After several letters and interviews I at last induced him to give way; and
I think the public will thank me for my persistency.

My revelations, which form an astonishing story, will no doubt come as a complete surprise
to almost everybody. I can imagine them, indeed, dropping like a bombshell into some circles;
but they are founded, not only upon conversations with Mr. Payne, but upon Burton's own letters
to Mr. Payne, all of which have been in my hands, and careful study of the two translations.
The public, however, cannot possibly be more surprised than I myself was when I compared the
two translations page by page, I could scarcely believe my own eyes; and only one conclusion
was possible. Burton, indeed, has taken from Payne at least three-quarters of the entire work.
He has transferred many hundreds of sentences and clauses bodily. Sometimes we come upon a
whole page with only a word or two altered. [7] In short, amazing to say, the public have given
Burton credit for a gift which he did not possess [8]--that of being a great translator. If
the public are sorry, we are deeply sorry, too, but we cannot help it. Burton's exalted position,
however, as ethnologist and anthropologist, is unassailable. He was the greatest linguist and
traveller that England ever produced. And four thrones are surely enough for any man. I must
mention that Mr. Payne gave me an absolute free hand--nay, more than that, having placed all
the documents before me, he said--and this he repeated again and again--"Wherever there is
any doubt, give Burton the benefit of it," and I have done so.

In dealing with the fight [9] over The Arabian Nights I have endeavoured to write in such a
way as to give offence to nobody, and for that reason have made a liberal use of asterisks.
I am the more desirous of saying this because no one is better aware than myself of the services
that some of Burton's most bitter opponents--those ten or twelve men whom he contemptuously
termed Laneites--have rendered to literature and knowledge. In short, I regard the battle as
fought and won. I am merely writing history. No man at the present day would dream of mentioning
Lane in the same breath with Payne and Burton. In restoring to Mr. Payne his own, I have had
no desire to detract from Burton. Indeed, it is impossible to take from a man that which he
never possessed. Burton was a very great man, Mr. Payne is a very great man, but they differ
as two stars differ in glory. Burton is the magnificent man of action and the anthropologist,
Mr. Payne the brilliant poet and prose writer. Mr. Payne did not go to Mecca or Tanganyika,
Burton did not translate The Arabian Nights, [10] or write The Rime of Redemption and Vigil
and Vision. He did, however, produce the annotations of The Arabian Nights, and a remarkable
enough and distinct work they form.

I recall with great pleasure an evening spent with Mr. Watts-Dunton at The Pines, Putney. The
conversation ran chiefly on the Gipsies, [11] upon whom Mr. Watts-Dunton is one of our best
authorities, and the various translations of The Arabian Nights. Both he and Mr. A. C. Swinburne
have testified to Burton's personal charm and his marvellous powers. "He was a much valued
and loved friend," wrote Mr. Swinburne to me [12], "and I have of him none but the most delightful
recollections." Mr. Swinburne has kindly allowed me to give in full his magnificent poem on
"The Death of Richard Burton." Dr. Grenfell Baker, whom I interviewed in London, had much to
tell me respecting Sir Richard's last three years; and he has since very kindly helped me by
letter.

The great object of this book is to tell the story of Burton's life, to delineate as vividly
as possible his remarkable character--his magnetic personality, and to defend him alike from
enemy and friend. In writing it my difficulties have been two. First, Burton himself was woefully
inaccurate as an autobiographer, and we must also add regretfully that we have occasionally
found him colouring history in order to suit his own ends. [13] He would have put his life
to the touch rather than misrepresent if he thought any man would suffer thereby; but he seems
to have assumed that it did not matter about keeping strictly to the truth if nobody was likely
to be injured. Secondly, Lady Burton, with haughty indifference to the opinions of everyone
else, always exhibited occurrences in the light in which she herself desired to see them. This
fact and the extreme haste with which her book was written are sufficient to account for most
of its shortcomings. She relied entirely upon her own imperfect recollections. Church registers
and all such documents were ignored. She begins with the misstatement that Burton was born
at Elstree, she makes scarcely any reference to his most intimate friends and even spells their
names wrongly. [14] Her remarks on the Kasidah are stultified by the most cursory glance at
that poem; while the whole of her account of the translating of The Arabian Nights is at variance
with Burton's own letters and conversations. I am assured by several who knew Burton intimately
that the untrustworthiness of the latter part of Lady Burton's "Life" of her husband is owing
mainly to her over-anxiety to shield him from his enemies. But I think she mistook the situation.
I do not believe Burton had any enemies to speak of at the time of his death.

If Lady Burton's treatment of her husband's unfinished works cannot be defended, on the other
hand I shall show that the loss as regards The Scented Garden was chiefly a pecuniary one,
and therefore almost entirely her own. The publication of The Scented Garden would not--it
could not--have added to Burton's fame. However, the matter will be fully discussed in its
proper place.

It has generally been supposed that two other difficulties must confront any conscientious
biographer of Burton--the first being Burton's choice of subjects, and the second the friction
between Lady Burton and the Stisteds. But as regards the first, surely we are justified in
assuming that Burton's studies were pursued purely for historical and scientific purposes.
He himself insisted in season and out of season that his outlook was solely that of the student,
and my researches for the purposes of this work have thoroughly convinced me that, however
much we may deprecate some of these studies, Burton himself was sincere enough in his pursuit
of them. His nature, strange as it may seem to some ears, was a cold one [15]; and at the time
he was buried in the most forbidding of his studies he was an old man racked with infirmities.
Yet he toiled from morning to night, year in year out, more like a navvy than an English gentleman,
with an income of £700 a year, and 10,000 "jingling, tingling, golden, minted quid," as R.
L. Stevenson would have said, in his pocket. In his hunger for the fame of an author, he forgot
to feed his body, and had to be constantly reminded of its needs by his medical attendant and
others. And then he would wolf down his food, in order to get back quickly to his absorbing
work. The study had become a monomania with him.

I do not think there is a more pathetic story in the history of literature than that which
I have to tell of the last few weeks of Burton's life. You are to see the old man, always ailing,
sometimes in acute pain--working twenty-five hours a day, as it were--in order to get completed
a work by which he supposed he was to live for ever. In the same room sits the wife who dearly
loves him, and whom he dearly loves and trusts. A few days pass. He is gone. She burns, page
by page, the work at which he had toiled so long and so patiently. And here comes the pathos
of it--she was, in the circumstances, justified in so doing. As regards Lady Burton and the
Stisteds, it was natural, perhaps, that between a staunch Protestant family such as the Stisteds,
and an uncompromising Catholic like Lady Burton there should have been friction; but both Lady
Burton and Miss Stisted are dead. Each made, during Lady Burton's lifetime, an honest attempt
to think well of the other; each wrote to the other many sweet, sincere, and womanly letters;
but success did not follow. Death, however, is a very loving mother. She gently hushes her
little ones to sleep; and, as they drop off, the red spot on the cheek gradually fades away,
and even the tears on the pillow soon dry.

Although Miss Stisted's book has been a help to me I cannot endorse her opinion that Burton's
recall from Damascus was the result of Lady Burton's indiscretions. Her books give some very
interesting reminiscences of Sir Richard's childhood and early manhood, [16] but practically
it finishes with the Damascus episode. Her innocent remarks on The Scented Garden must have
made the anthropological sides of Ashbee, Arbuthnot, and Burton's other old friends shake with
uncontrollable laughter. Unfortunately, she was as careless as Lady Burton. Thus on page 48
she relates a story about Burton's attempt to carry off a nun; but readers of Burton's book
on Goa will find that it had no connection with Burton whatever. It was a story someone had
told him.

In these pages Burton will be seen on his travels, among his friends, among his books, fighting,
writing, quarrelling, exploring, joking, flying like a squib from place to place--a 19th century
Lord Peterborough, though with the world instead of a mere continent for theatre. Even late
in life, when his infirmities prevented larger circuits, he careered about Europe in a Walpurgic
style that makes the mind giddy to dwell upon.

Of Burton's original works I have given brief summaries; but as a writer he shines only in
isolated passages. We go to him not for style but for facts. Many of his books throw welcome
light on historical portions of the Bible. [17]

Of those of his works which are erotic in the true sense of the word I have given a sufficient
account, and one with which I am convinced even the most captious will not find fault. [18]
When necessity has obliged me to touch upon the subject to which Sir Richard devoted his last
lustrum, I have been as brief as possible, and have written in a way that only scholars could
understand. In short I have kept steadily in view the fact that this work is one which will
lie on drawing-room tables and be within the reach of everyone. I have nowhere mentioned the
subject by name, but I do not see how I could possible have avoided all allusion to it. I have
dwelt on Burton's bravery, his tenderness, his probity, his marvellous industry, his encyclopaedic
learning--but the picture would not have been a true one had I entirely over-passed the monomania
of his last days. Hamlet must be shown, if not at his maddest, at any rate mad, or he would
not be Hamlet at all.

As regards Burton's letters, I have ruthlessly struck out every sentence that might give offence.
[19] While I have not hesitated to expose Sir Richard's faults, I have endeavoured to avoid
laying too much stress upon them. I have tried, indeed, to get an idea of the mountain not
only by climbing its sides, but also by viewing it from a distance. I trust that there will
be found nothing in this book to hurt the feelings of any living person or indeed of any body
of persons. I have certainly tried my utmost to avoid causing pain, and if the reader will
kindly bear in mind that it is as much a Christian duty to avoid taking offence as to avoid
giving offence, we shall amble along pleasantly together to the very last page. Out of consideration
for Catholics I have suppressed a number of passages; and if I have allowed Sir Richard in
one or two instances to make a lunge at their church, I trust they will notice that I have
permitted him the same licence with regard to the Church of England and Exeter Hall. Finally,
my impartiality is proved by my allowing him to gird at the poet Cowper.

Wherever possible, that is to say, when I could do it without ambiguity I have also out of
courtesy used the term Catholic instead of Roman Catholic; and in order to meet what I believe
to be the wishes of Lady Burton's executors, I have omitted all mention of certain events that
occurred after Sir Richard's death.

The various works of Mr. W. H. Wilkins have been of great help to me, and I cannot avoid paying
a passing tribute to the excellent opening passages [20] of the Preface of his edition of Lady
Burton's Life of her husband.

The illustrations in this book are of exceptional interest. They include the Burton family
portraits, the originals of which are in the possession of Mr. Mostyn Pryce and Mrs. Agg. During
the lifetime of Sir Richard and Lady Burton they were the property of Lady and Miss Stisted;
but, owing to her difference with these ladies, Lady Burton was not able to use them in the
life of her husband; and Miss Stisted's own scheme did not include illustrations. So they are
now reproduced for the first time. The most noticeable are the quaint picture of Burton, his
brother and sister as children, and the oil painting of Burton and Lady Stisted made by Jacquand
about 1851. Of great interest, too, is the series of photographs taken at Trieste by Dr. Grenfell
Baker; while the portraits of Burton's friends, Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot, Mr. John Payne, Major
St. George Burton, Dr. Baker, Mr. W. F. Kirby, Mr. A. G. Ellis, Professor J. F. Blumhardt,
and others, will no doubt be appreciated by the public.

The writing of this book has been a thorough pleasure to me, not only on account of the infinite
charm of the subject, but also because everyone whom I have approached has treated me with
studied kindness. The representatives of Sir Richard Burton, of Lady Burton (through Mr. W.
H. Wilkins) and of Miss Stisted have not only helped and permitted me to use the unpublished
letters, [21] but have generously given me a free hand. I am deeply indebted to them, and I
can only trust that these pages will prove that their confidence in my judgment has not been
misplaced.

To everyone who has assisted me I tender my sincere thanks, and I assure them that I shall
never forget their abundant kindness.

Finally, in writing this work every possible care has been taken to ensure accuracy [22]; but
that absolute perfection has been attained is improbable. It is hoped, however,--to borrow
the quaint expression of the Persian poet Jami--"that the noble disposition of the readers
will induce them to pass over defects." [23]
