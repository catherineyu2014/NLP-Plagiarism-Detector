     I thought you might like to know about "Dr. Pruitt's boys," so I
     concluded to write you a letter. I am Will, aged twelve; then there
     are Fred, Edward, and Charley. Papa takes HARPER'S MONTHLY, and
     mamma takes the BAZAR, and when YOUNG PEOPLE was advertised papa
     proposed that each of us give something and take that too. We four
     boys earned just one hundred dollars picking cotton last fall, so
     we all contributed. We like the paper very much, and watch for its
     coming; and we read everything in it.

  WILL E. PRUITT.

  GRAND ISLAND, NEBRASKA.

     I am ten years old. My uncle takes YOUNG PEOPLE for me, and I can
     hardly wait until it comes. I have got the elephant on his four
     legs, and he looks well. I have a little prairie-dog named Jenny.
     It lives in a hole in the yard, where I think it must have a good
     nest, for I gave it lots of rags last fall to put in the hole. It
     comes to the house almost every day to get something to eat, and
     seems glad to see us. I have also a little dog named Frisk, only I
     sold one-half interest in him yesterday for twenty-five cents to a
     doctor who lives next door. He wanted him for his baby to play
     with. Can you tell me what kind of a place a junk-shop is?

  HARRY K. HEFFLEMAN.

A junk-shop is where old ropes, old anchors, old iron, and cast-off odds and ends of all kinds
are kept for sale. There are many such shops to be found in every large city, and if it is
a seaport, they are generally located near the waterfront, as a vast quantity of such rubbish
is picked up along the wharves. In New York city junk dealers drive wagons round the streets,
and buy old stoves or any worn-out household goods.

  LONOKE, ARKANSAS.

     I found in mamma's front yard, near a brick wall, a little pansy,
     which I send you. It bloomed out the 29th of January.

  SARAH F. S.

It was fortunate for the little pansy that it was picked and pressed, for Katie Black writes,
also from Arkansas: "There was a very pretty snow-storm here on the 2d of February. It began
in the morning, and snowed all day."

ANSWERS TO PUZZLES IN NO. 14.

The following solution to "A Latin Word Square," on page 155, is from a correspondent in Pennsylvania:

  R O M A
  O L I M
  M I L O
  A M O R

  The square is made of magic spells
    That speak of Horace and of Homer;
  The third the glory that was Greece,
    The first the grandeur that was Roma.

      Tales of eating and of drinking,
      And of falling roofs upholden,
            Call up Milo;
      Milo backward murmurs Olim,
      These, all these, were in the olden
            Time long ago.

  Lo! in yon brilliant window niche
    My fourth--how statue-like he stands!
    His bow and arrow in his hands,
  Ah, Amor, from the regions which
        Are Holy Lands.

Answer to "Throwing Light," on page 168--"Draught, draft."

       *       *       *       *       *

We have received numerous answers to the Puzzle Picture on page 168, which are correct with
the exception that more beasts are there than any one has yet discovered. A great many little
folks have found seven. Only one has found eight. There are nine concealed in the picture,
and we give one more week in which to hunt for them before publishing the answer.

THE FIRE-FLY GAME.

The game of fire-fly is very graceful and amusing for dull days or winter evenings in the house.
Out of a piece of Bristol-board (an old playing-card will do) cut a figure in the shape of
the annexed diagram. If you have water-colors, and can paint it brightly in red and green or
red and yellow stripes, all the better. Lay it flat on the cover of a book so that part of
one of the wings projects over the edge; hold the book at a slight angle, pointing toward the
ceiling, and then with a pencil or pen-holder give the projecting wing a smart blow, so as
to send it flying upward; it will go twirling through the air toward the ceiling, and then
return twirling back to the neighborhood of your feet. The game consists in trying to catch
it on the cover of the book when it comes back. If you succeed, it counts you ten points; if
you fail, you allow the fly to lie where it has fallen. Your adversary now takes his turn,
and if he fails to catch his fly, then you see which fly has fallen nearest to a certain line
on the floor on which you have previously agreed, and the owner of the nearest fly scores five.
Whoever first scores one hundred wins the game.

=A School in Morocco.=--If one, happening to be in the south of Spain some day, should run
across the Straits of Gibraltar in a southwesterly direction, he would come to the ancient
city of Tangier, in Morocco. Here he would see many curious sights, but none more picturesque
than the schools for children, of which there are several. A row of tiny slippers at the door
and a hum of childish voices inside prompt the passer-by to look in. He sees a room, empty
of furniture, and lit only by the open door. The school-master, a veritable Moses in appearance,
is squatted on his haunches in the centre, and around him squat his pupils. Each has his slate
before him, and repeats his lesson with monotonous chant, keeping his body moving backward
and forward as if he were rowing hard the whole time against stream. The school-master's whip
is of sufficient length to reach every boy around him, and now and then, without rising from
his seat, he touches one or other up in the same manner as the driver of a mail-coach takes
a fly off his leader's ear. The imperturbable gravity of the master, and the comical looks
and quaint attire of the boys, form a picture which could not be transferred to canvas.

THE CHICKEN PUZZLE.

Here is an orange. With four cuts of the scissors and the prick of a pin transform it into
a chicken.

CHARADE.

  My first belongs to an ancient race;
  They say his pedigree he can trace
    To the time of the ark, and before;
  But this I know, though his family tree
  Be spread as wide as the sounding sea,
    He was not a companion of Noah.

  My next in death plays a cruel part,
  And yet 'tis dear to a woman's heart,
    And sets her pulse beating high.
  Of all sizes and shapes, it can fly or bound;
  When most 'tis inflated it trails on the ground;
    When base, then it soars in the sky.

  My whole is extracted from earth and from sea;
  Compounded with care, from obstacles free,
    'Tis dear to the Yankee, I own.
  'Tis famous in song, and famous in story,
  And yet 'tis indebted for most of its glory
    To the time when 'twas taken alone.
