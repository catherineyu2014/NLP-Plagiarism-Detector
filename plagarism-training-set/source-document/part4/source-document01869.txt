BIBLIOGRAPHY.

A. MANUSCRIPT SOURCES.

1. The Flinders Papers, in the Melbourne Public Library, consisting of a letter-book of Flinders
(August 31, 1807, to May 31, 1814); manuscript narrative of the voyage of the Francis; miscellaneous
notes and memoranda by friends and relatives, a short manuscript memoir, and a large quantity
of transcripts of journals, family letters, etc. This material is not at present numbered,
and allusions to it in the text of the book are therefore made by the general reference, "Flinders
Papers."

2. Decaen Papers, in the Municipal Library of Caen, Normandy. General Decaen's manuscripts
fill 149 volumes. The documents relating to Flinders, including a translation of portions of
the Cumberland's log, are principally in volumes 10, 84, 92, and 105. Peron's important report
upon the British colony at Port Jackson is also in this collection, which includes many original
letters of Flinders.

3. Archives Nationales, Paris, Marine BB4, 996 to 999, contains a quantity of manuscripts relative
to Baudin's expeditions, including reports and letters by him, and many miscellaneous papers.

4. The Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, nouveaux acquisitions, France, contains many documents
relative to Baudin's expedition, including the diary of the commander.

5. The Archives du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris contain reports and documents concerning
the scientific work of Baudin's expedition.

6. The Depot de la Marine, service hydrographique, Paris, cartons 6, 22, and 23, contains many
reports upon the Australian coast made to Captain Baudin by his officers.

7. The Library of the Royal Colonial Institute, London, contains Westall's original drawings
executed on the Investigator voyage. Photographed copies are in the Mitchell Library, Sydney.

8. The Mitchell Library, Sydney, contains Smith's manuscript journal of the Investigator voyage,
and many Flinders and Franklin papers, as cited in the text.

B. PRINTED DOCUMENTS.

Most of the Flinders material contained in the Record Office, London, and the British Museum,
is printed in Volumes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the Historical Records of New South Wales, edited
by F.M. Bladen (Sydney, 1893 to 1901). Copies of other letters and documents, mainly from the
same source, are in course of publication by the Commonwealth Government, under the direction
of the Commonwealth Library Committee, edited by Dr. F. Watson.

vollenden unter nommen in den Jaksen, 1801, 1802 and 1803. Aus dem Englischen, von F. Gotze.
Weimar, 1816. A German translation of the Voyage to Terra Australis. An accompanying map is
of great interest, as it essays for the first time to indicate by colours the portions of the
Australian coast discovered by the English, the Dutch and the French. The map errs with regard
to Kangaroo Island, in attributing the discovery of the north to the French and the south to
the English. The reverse was the case.

MATTHEW FLINDERS, Ontdekkings-reis naar het Groote Zuidland anders Nieuw Holland; besigtiging
van het zelve in 1801, 1802 en 1803; noodlottige schipbreak, en gevangenschap van 6 1/2 jaar

translation of the Voyage to Terra Australis.

D. OTHER PRINTED BOOKS.

BARROW, SIR JOHN, articles in Quarterly Review, 1810 and 1817, strongly condemning the work

edition, with additions by Freycinet, 1824. Very important, but the historical statements have
to be checked by reference to Baudin's manuscript diary and letters (see reference to manuscripts
above).

Victorian Geographical Journal, Volume 28 (1910 and 1911) prints a biographical sketch of Flinders
from a manuscript found in a copy of A Voyage to Terra Australis in Donington vicarage in 1903.
It is printed with an Introduction (by G. Gordon McCrae) wherein it is stated to be "hitherto
unpublished." But it is simply the Naval Chronicle sketch, with a few paragraphs added, and
it is from the same pen as the manuscript sketch mentioned above.
