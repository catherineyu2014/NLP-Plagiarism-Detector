The sons of Dartmouth have performed honorable service in the field. More than a score were
soldiers of the Revolution. Among them John S. Sherburne, who lost one of his limbs; Absalom
Peters, whose efficient service in Vermont contributed largely to the protection of our Northern
frontier; and Ebenezer Mattoon, who by forced marches with his gallant men furnished cannon
which "told" at Saratoga.

In the War of 1812-1815 they acted well their part. Eleazer Wheelock Ripley, at Lundy's Lane,
after General Scott had been disabled (with the aid of the gallant Miller), wrested victory
from an almost triumphant foe, on the bloodiest field of the war.

In that War, too, Sylvanus Thayer gained a measure of the renown which has rendered the name
of the most efficient founder of the Military Academy at West Point illustrious in both hemispheres.

In the late War one of the most valuable coadjutors of two of its leading captains--Grant and
Sherman--was Joseph Dana Webster.

In letters of living light we write many other names, among them Charles and Daniel Foster--par
nobile fratrum--Samuel Souther, Charles Augustine Davis, Isaac Lewis Clarke, Calvin Gross Hollenbush,
Valentine B. Oakes, Franklin Aretas Haskell, Arthur Edwin Hutchins, Lucius Stearns Shaw, Horace
Meeker Dyke, Edwin Brant Frost, William Lawrence Baker, Charles Whiting Carroll, George Washington
Quimby, George Ephraim Chamberlin, Charles Lee Foster, Henry Mills Caldwell, and Stark Fellows,
who at Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and elsewhere, gave
their lives in defense of the American Union.

No aggregation of volumes would adequately portray the whole work of Dartmouth's alumni. In
quiet places, the great majority, day by day, and year by year, have performed their allotted
tasks. In such places all over America, and in other lands, they have built their most enduring
monuments. The calm lustre of their lives is almost as widely diffused as the morning light.

Eleazer Wheelock founded the college, in faith and hope, for the enlightenment and evangelization
of future generations in that mighty storehouse of thought and action, central New England.

John Wheelock carried forward the work with energy and zeal, and a large measure of success.

Francis Brown gave a valuable life for the protection of his still youthful Alma Mater.

Daniel Dana was a man of kindred spirit, and not less devoted to his work.

Bennet Tyler magnified his office, and, laboring in season and out of season, added "goodly
ornaments."

Nathan Lord added new halls, new departments and modes of instruction, gave larger prestige,
and left the impress of a great mind upon two thousand pupils.

Asa D. Smith added yet other halls, secured new endowments, and provided a long line of scholarships,
for the development of latent talent, and the encouragement of genuine worth.

Samuel C. Bartlett brings to the accomplishment of his task the name of an ancient and honored
family, and the experiences of an earnest and fruitful life.

Dartmouth has blessed New England and Old England, North America and the whole world.

Her location, unrivaled in many respects by that of any sister institution, her history, so
full of romance and of reality, and her work, recorded first in the history of the eighteenth
century, and indelibly impressed upon the history of the nineteenth, all warrant the hope that
her walls may stand, through all the ages of the future, strong as the everlasting hills, and
beautiful as the celestial dome.
