There is no clear record of the origin of St. Valentine's Day. St. Valentine himself was a
priest of Rome who was martyred some time during the third century, but he had nothing to do
with the peculiar observance of his day. In ancient Rome a great part of the month of February
was devoted to feasts in honor of Pan and Juno, during which the young men drew by lot the
name of their companion for the festivities. It is supposed that this ancient custom changed
gradually into the present observance of the day. Many allusions to St. Valentine's Day are
found in English poetry of the earliest date, as the festival was much more generally observed
four centuries ago than now.

     I am a little boy eight years old. I want to tell you that papa
     heard a bluebird sing in a chestnut-tree on January 11. I have six
     cats and three ducks. One of my cats died last week, and I buried
     her. Poor Susie!

  S. B. H.

The little bluebird must have left its winter-quarters in the Southern States, and travelled
with the warm wave which swept northward in January. It is to be hoped it will escape being
frozen to death, and live to sing its sweet spring song at a more seasonable time.

     I send you some flowers which grew in the front yard. The
     buttercups and purple magnolias are blooming also, but I could not
     press them to send them to you. I have seen some bluebirds and
     redbirds. Many of our flowers are blooming. It is just like summer
     out-doors.

     I have a little rabbit I like very much. It lives with the hens in
     winter. Papa bought two in Chicago. They travelled to Washington in
     a peach basket. When papa brought them home he gave one to me. The
     other was drowned last summer in a hard storm. My rabbit likes
     apples, potato skins, clover, grass, hay, and corn, and I must not
     give it oats nor anything greasy.

     I have a little dog named Fanny, who shakes rats, and cats too when
     she gets a chance. She talks, and she shows her teeth when she
     laughs, and sneezes when she is pleased.

     As you have asked us to write about household pets, I thought I
     would tell you about a pet fish we kept in a stone basin about
     three feet square and two feet deep. We caught the fish in Cross
     Creek, and brought it home in a bucket, and placed it in the basin.
     It was a yellow bass about ten inches long and very pretty. It soon
     got very tame, and would take a fishing-worm out of my fingers. It
     committed suicide one night by jumping out on the floor and killing
     itself. I have a sunfish in the basin now, but I don't expect it
     will ever get so tame. There are four or five pretty redbirds
     staying in our yard, and lots of snowbirds.

  NEW YORK CITY.

     In YOUNG PEOPLE No. 11 there is an article on the Dead-letter
     Office at Washington which mentions some curious things to go
     through the mail. There are three more very queer things I would
     like to mention. The first is two centipedes, which are on the
     shelf with the snake; the second is an iron hitching post; and the
     third is a live alligator about a foot and a half long. There is an
     old record in the office of 1778, which lasted at that time eleven
     years, but which, a clerk said, would last now about fifteen
     minutes.

GEORGE B. WEBSTER.--Coons are very fond of fish, and you might bait your trap with salt cod-fish
roasted to give it a strong smell. The sense of smell of a coon is very acute, and it will
rarely pass a trap baited with any provender it can scent.

"GOLDEN," M. E. B., AND OTHERS.--We can not print puzzles unless accompanied with full name
and address, as guarantee that they are original. Correspondents will please pay attention
to this, as we have been compelled to reject some very pretty puzzles because they came without
address. Never send old puzzles, as some have done, for they are worthless. Be very careful
to give a clear and correct definition of words used in word squares, diamond puzzles, beheadings,
acrostics, and charades. One poor definition will spoil an otherwise excellent puzzle. Do not
take a name little known, like that of some Western town, to form an enigma, for children in
some other part of the country will find it difficult to solve.

  HARPER'S YOUNG PEOPLE.

6 months for 10 cents, on trial.

Depuy's Monthly Miscellany, a large 8 page newspaper. Sample free.

Here are some of the answers to the Wiggle published in No. 10 of HARPER'S YOUNG PEOPLE. So
many were sent in that it was impossible to publish them all, and so our artist selected those
that he considered the best. Those that he used were sent in by J. R. S., J. B. G., M. E.,
A. T. Jones, Paul, D. C. Gilmore, H. and B., and Bert W. S., several of whom sent a number
of different figures.

Others, and some of them very good, were sent in by W. B. B., Ethel M., S. A. W., Jun., John
Peddle, C. F., Nettie S. H., Willie H. S., Mabel M., E. H. S., Hetty, M. Ward, Philip M., Amenio
E. A., Willy H., H. W. P., J. L., Mary P., Archie H. L., C. B. F., R. S. M., W. A. Burr, Percy
B. M., Paul. B. T., E. S., C. F. C., Gracie C., Eva M., and Anita R. N. Figure No. 8 is what
our artist made of the Wiggle; and Figure No. 9 is a new Wiggle in two parts, which must be
combined in one drawing, though they must retain their relative positions.

THE LONG-EARED BAT.

      A long-eared bat
      Went to buy a hat.
  Said the hatter, "I've none that will do,
      Unless with the shears
      I shorten your ears,
  Which might be unpleasant to you."

      The long-eared bat
      Was so mad at that
  He flew over lands and seas,
      Till in Paris (renowned
      For its fashions) he found
  A hat that he wore with great ease.

=Another Sagacious Dog.=--In No. 11 of HARPER'S YOUNG PEOPLE a story was told of a sagacious
newspaper dog. Having read this, a Western editor sends the following story of his dog, in
which he says: "My dog is a beautiful Gordon setter, and has been so well trained that while
the carrier is delivering papers on one side of the street, Bob, the dog, delivers on the other.
He receives his papers folded, half a dozen at a time, and going to the first place, lays the
whole bundle down, and then picks it up, all but one, and so on till they are all gone."
