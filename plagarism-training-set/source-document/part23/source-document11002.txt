A NEW ATLANTIS.

The New Year's debts are paid, the May-day moving is over and settled, and still a remnant
of money is found sticking to the bottom of the old marmalade pot. Where shall we go?

There is nothing like the sea. Shall it be Newport?

But Newport is no longer the ocean pure and deep, in the rich severity of its sangre azul.
We want to admire the waves, and they drag us off to inspect the last new villa: we like the
beach, and they bid us enjoy the gardens, brought every spring in lace-paper out of the florist's
shop. We like to stroll on the shore, barefooted if we choose, and Newport is become an affair
of toilette and gold-mounted harness, a bathing-place where people do everything but bathe.

Well, Nahant, then, or Long Branch?

Too slow and too fast. Besides, we have seen them.

Suppose we try the Isles of Shoals? Appledore and Duck Island and White Island, now? Or Nantucket,
or Marblehead?

Too stony, and nothing in particular to eat. You ask for fish, and they give you a rock.

In truth, under that moral and physical dyspepsia to which we bring ourselves regularly every
summer, the fine crags of the north become just the least bit of a bore. They necessitate an
amount of heroic climbing under the command of a sort of romantic and do-nothing Girls of the
Period, who sit about on soft shawls in the lee of the rocks, and gather their shells and anemones
vicariously at the expense of your tendon achilles. We know it, for we have suffered. We calculate,
and are prepared to prove, that the successful collection of a single ribbon of ruffled seaweed,
procured in a slimy haystack of red dulse at the beck of one inconsiderate girl, who is keeping
her brass heels dry on a safe and sunny ledge of the Purgatory at Newport, may require more
mental calculation, involve more anguish of equilibrium, and encourage more heartfelt secret
profanity than the making of a steam-engine or the writing of a proposal.

No, no, we would admire nothing, dare nothing, do nothing, but only suck in rosy health at
every pore, pin our souls out on the holly hedge to sweeten, and forget what we had for breakfast.
Uneasy daemons that we are all winter, toiling gnomes of the mine and the forge--"O spent ones
of a workday age"--can we not for one brief month in our year be Turks?

Our doctors, slowly acquiring a little sense, are changing their remedies. Where the cry used
to be "drugs," it now is "hygiene." But hygiene itself might be changed for the better. We
can imagine a few improvements in the materia medica of the future. Where the physician used
to order a tonic for a feeble pulse, he will simply hold his watch thoughtfully for sixty seconds
and prescribe "Paris." Where he was wont to recommend a strong emetic, he will in future advise
a week's study of the works of art at our National Capital. For lassitude, a donkey-ride up
Vesuvius. For color-blindness, a course of sunrises from the Rigi. For deafness, Wachtel in
his song of "Di quella Pira." For melancolia, Naples. For fever, driving an ice-cart. But when
the doctor's most remunerative patient comes along, the pursy manufacturer able to afford the
luxury of a bad liver, let him consult the knob of his cane a moment and order "Atlantic City."

--Because it is lazy, yet stimulating. Because it is unspoilt, yet luxurious. Because the air
there is filled with iodine and the sea with chloride of sodium. Because, with a whole universe
of water, Atlantic City is dry. Because of its perfect rest and its infinite horizons.

But where and what is Atlantic City? It is a refuge thrown up by the continent-building sea.
Fashion took a caprice, and shook it out of a fold of her flounce. A railroad laid a wager
to find the shortest distance from Penn's treaty-elm to the Atlantic Ocean: it dashed into
the water, and a City emerged from its freight-cars as a consequence of the manoeuvre. Almost
any kind of a parent-age will account for Atlantis. It is beneath shoddy and above mediocrity.
It is below Long Branch and higher up than Cape May. It is different from any watering-place
in the world, yet its strong individuality might have been planted in any other spot; and a
few years ago it was nowhere. Its success is due to its having nothing importunate about it.
It promises endless sea, sky, liberty and privacy, and, having made you at home, it leaves
you to your devices.

Two of our best marine painters in their works offer us a choice of coast-landscape. Kensett
paints the bare stiff crags, whitened with salt, standing out of his foregrounds like the clean
and hungry teeth of a wild animal, and looking hard enough to have worn out the painter's brush
with their implacable enamel. From their treeless waste extends the sea, a bath of deep, pure
color. All seems keen, fresh, beautiful and severe: it would take a pair of stout New England
lungs to breathe enjoyably in such an air. That is the northern coast. Mr. William Richards
gives us the southern--the landscape, in fact, of Atlantic City. In his scenes we have the
infinitude of soft silver beach, the rolling tumultuousness of a boundless sea, and twisted
cedars mounted like toiling ships on the crests of undulating sand-hills. It is the charm,
the dream, the power and the peace of the Desert.

And here let us be indulged with a few words about a section of our great continent which has
never been sung in rhyme, and which it is almost a matter of course to treat disparagingly.
A cheap and threadbare popular joke assigns the Delaware River as the eastern boundary of the
United States of America, and defines the out-landers whose homes lie between that current
and the Atlantic Ocean as foreigners, Iberians, and we know not what. Scarcely more of an exile
was Victor Hugo, sitting on the shores of Old Jersey, than is the denizen of New Jersey when
he brings his half-sailor costume and his beach-learned manners into contrast with the thrift
and hardness of the neighboring commonwealth. The native of the alluvium is another being from
the native of the great mineral State. But, by the very reason of this difference, there is
a strange soft charm that comes over our thoughts of the younger Jersey when we have done laughing
at it. That broad, pale peninsula, built of shells and crystal-dust, which droops toward the
south like some vast tropical leaf, and spreads its two edges toward the fresh and salt waters,
enervated with drought and sunshine--that flat leaf of land has characteristics that are almost
Oriental. To make it the sea heaved up her breast, and showed the whitened sides against which
her tides were beating. To walk upon it is in a sense to walk upon the bottom of the ocean.
Here are strange marls, the relics of infinite animal life, into which has sunk the lizard
or the dragon of antiquity--the gigantic Hadrosaurus, who cranes his snaky throat at us in
the museum, swelling with the tale of immemorial times when he weltered here in the sunny ooze.
The country is a mighty steppe, but not deprived of trees: the ilex clothes it with its set,
dark foliage, and the endless woods of pine, sand-planted, strew over that boundless beach
a murmur like the sea. The edibles it bears are of the quaintest and most individual kinds:
the cranberry is its native condiment, full of individuality, unknown to Europe, beautiful
as a carbuncle, wild as a Tartar belle, and rife with a subacid irony that is like the wit
of Heine.

Here is the patate douce, with every kind of sweet-fleshed gourd that loves to gad along the
sand--the citron in its carved net, and the enormous melon, carnation-colored within and dark-green
to blackness outside. The peaches here are golden-pulped, as if trying to be oranges, and are
richly bitter, with a dark hint of prussic acid, fascinating the taste like some enchantress
of Venice, the pursuit of whom is made piquant by a fancy that she may poison you. The farther
you penetrate this huge idle peninsula, the more its idiosyncrasy is borne in on your mind.
Infinite horizons, "an everlasting wash of air," the wild pure warmth of Arabia, and heated
jungles of dwarf oaks balancing balmy plantations of pine. Then, toward the sea, the wiry grasses
that dry into "salt hay" begin to dispute possession with the forests, and finally supplant
them: the sand is blown into coast-hills, whose crests send off into every gale a foam of flying
dust, and which themselves change shape, under pressure of the same winds, with a slower imitation
of the waves. Finally, by the gentlest of transitions, the deserts and the quicksands become
the ocean.

The shore melts into the sea by a network of creeks and inlets, edging the territory (as the
flying osprey sees it) with an inimitable lacework of azure waters; the pattern is one of looping
channels with oval interstices, and the dentellated border of the commonwealth resembles that
sort of lace which was made by arranging on glass the food of a silk-spinning worm: the creature
ate and wove, having voracity always before him and Fine Art behind him. Much of the solider
part of the State is made of the materials which enter into glass-manufacture: a mighty enchanter
might fuse the greater portion of it into one gigantic goblet. A slight approximation to this
work of magic is already being carried on. The tourist who has crossed the lagoons of Venice
to see the fitful lights flash up from the glass-furnaces of Murano, will find more than one
locality here where leaping lights, crowning low banks of sand, are preparing the crystal for
our infant industries in glass, and will remind him of his hours by the Adriatic. Every year
bubbles of greater and greater beauty are being blown in these secluded places, and soon we
hope to enrich commerce with all the elegances of latticinio and schmelze, the perfected glass
of an American Venice.

But our business is not with the land, but the sea. Here it lies, basking at our feet, the
warm amethystine sea of the South. It does not boom and thunder, as in the country of the "cold
gray stones." On the contrary, saturating itself with sunny ease, thinning its bulk over the
shoal flat beach with a succession of voluptuous curves, it spreads thence in distance with
strands and belts of varied color, away and away, until blind with light it faints on a prodigiously
far horizon. Its falling noises are as soft as the sighs of Christabel. Its colors are the
pale and milky colors of the opal. But ah! what an impression of boundlessness! How the silver
ribbon of beach unrolls for miles and miles! And landward, what a parallel sea of marshes,
bottoms and dunes! The sense of having all the kingdoms of the world spread out beneath one,
together with most of the kingdoms of the mermen, has never so come to one's consciousness
before. And again, what an artist is Nature, with these faint washes and tenderest varied hues--varied
and tender as the flames from burning gases--while her highest lights (a painter will understand
the difficulty of that) are still diaphanous and profound!

One goes to the seaside not for pomp and peacock's tails, but for saltness, Nature and a bite
of fresh fish. To build a city there that shall not be an insult to the sentiment of the place
is a matter of difficulty. One's ideal, after all, is a canvas encampment. A range of solid
stone villas like those of Newport, so far as congruity with a watering-place goes, pains the
taste like a false note in music. Atlantic City pauses halfway between the stone house and
the tent, and erects herself in woodwork. A quantity of bright, rather giddy-looking structures,
with much open-work and carved ruffling about the eaves and balconies, are poised lightly on
the sand, following the course of the two main avenues which lead parallel with the shore,
and the series of short, straight, direct streets which leap across them and run eagerly for
the sea. They have a low, brooding look, and evidently belong to a class of sybarites who are
not fond of staircases. Among them, the great rambling hotel, sprawling in its ungainly length
here and there, looks like one of the ordinary tall New York houses that had concluded to lie
over on its side and grow, rather than take the trouble of piling on its stories standing.
In this encampment of wooden pavilions is lived the peculiar life of the place.

We are sure it is a sincere, natural, sensible kind of life, as compared with that of other
bathing-shores. Although there are brass bands at the hotels, and hops in the evening, and
an unequal struggle of macassar oil with salt and stubborn locks, yet the artificiality is
kept at a minimum. People really do bathe, really do take walks on the beach for the love of
the ocean, really do pick up shells and throw them away again, really do go yachting and crab-catching;
and if they try city manners in the evening, they are so tired with their honest day's work
that it is apt to end in misery. On the hotel piazzas you see beauties that surprise you with
exquisite touches of the warm and languid South. That dark Baltimore girl, her hair a constellation
of jessamines, is beating her lover's shoulders with her fan in a state of ferocity that you
would give worlds to encounter. That pair of proud Philadelphia sisters, statues sculptured
in peach-pulp and wrapped in gauze, look somehow like twin Muses at the gates of a temple.
Whole rows of unmatched girls stare at the sea, desolate but implacable, waiting for partners
equal to them in social position. In such a dearth a Philadelphia girl will turn to her old
music-teacher and flirt solemnly with him for a whole evening, sooner than involve herself
with well-looking young chits from Providence or New York, who may be jewelers' clerks when
at home. Yet the unspoiled and fruity beauty of these Southern belles is very striking to one
who comes fresh from Saratoga and the sort of upholstered goddesses who are served to him there.

Some years ago the Surf House was the finest place of entertainment, but it has now many rivals,
taller if not finer. Congress Hall, under the management of Mr. G.W. Hinkle, is a universal
favorite, while the Senate House, standing under the shadow of the lighthouse, has the advantage
of being the nearest to the beach of all the hotels. Both are ample and hospitable hostelries,
where you are led persuasively through the Eleusinian mystery of the Philadelphia cuisine.
Schaufler's is an especial resort of our German fellow-citizens, who may there be seen enjoying
themselves in the manner depicted by our artist, while concocting--as we are warned by M. Henri
Kowalski--the ambitious schemes which they conceal under their ordinary enveloppe débonnaire.

There is another feature of the place. With its rarely fine atmosphere, so tonic and bracing,
so free from the depressing fog of the North, it is a great sanitarium. There are seasons when
the Pennsylvania University seems to have bred its wealth of doctors for the express purpose
of marshaling a dying world to the curative shelter of Atlantic City. The trains are encumbered
with the halt and the infirm, who are got out at the doors like unwieldy luggage in the arms
of nurses and porters. Once arrived, however, they display considerable mobility in distributing
themselves through the three or four hundred widely-separated cottages which await them for
hire. As you wander through the lanes of these cunning little houses, you catch strange fragments
of conversation. Gentlemen living vis-à-vis, and standing with one leg in the grave and the
other on their own piazzas, are heard on sunny mornings exciting themselves with the maddest
abuse of each other's doctor. There are large boarding-houses, fifty or more of them, each
of which has its contingent of puling valetudinarians. The healthy inmates have the privilege
of listening to the symptoms, set forth with that full and conscientious detail not unusual
with invalids describing their own complaints. Or the sufferers turn their batteries on each
other. On the verandah of a select boarding-house we have seen a fat lady of forty lying on
a bench like a dead harlequin, as she rolled herself in the triangles of a glittering afghan.
On a neighboring seat a gouty subject, and a tropical sun pouring on both.

"Good-morning! You see I am trying my sun-bath. I am convinced it relieves my spine." The same
remark has introduced seven morning conversations.

"And my gout has shot from the index toe to the ring toe. I feared my slipper was damp, and
I am roasting it here. But, dear ma'am, I pity you so with your spine! Tried acupuncture?"

The patient probably hears the word as Acapulco. For she answers, "No, but I tried St. Augustine
last winter. Not a morsel of good."

Among these you encounter sometimes lovely, frail, transparent girls, who come down with cheeks
of wax, and go home in two months with cheeks of apple. Or stout gentlemen arriving yellow,
and going back in due time purple.

Once a hardened siren of many watering-places, large and blooming, arrived at Atlantic City
with her latest capture, a stooping invalid gentleman of good family in Rhode Island. They
boated, they had croquet on the beach, they paced the shining sands. Both of them people of
the world and past their first youth, they found an amusement in each other's knowing ways
and conversation that kept them mutually faithful in a kind of mock-courtship. The gentleman,
however, was evidently only amusing himself with this travesty of sentiment, though he was
never led away by the charms of younger women. After a month of it he succeeded in persuading
her for the first time to enter the water, and there he assisted her to take the billows in
the gallant American fashion. Her intention of staying only in the very edge of the ocean he
overruled by main force, playfully drawing her out where a breaker washed partially over her.
As the water touched her face she screamed, and raised her arm to hide the cheek that had been
wet. She then ran hastily to shore, and her friend, fearing some accident, made haste to rejoin
her. His astonishment was great at finding one of her cheeks of a ghastly, unhealthy white.
Her color had always been very high. That afternoon she sought him and explained. She was really
an invalid, she said calmly, and had recently undergone a shocking operation for tumor. But
she saw no reason for letting that interfere with her usual summer life, particularly as she
felt youth and opportunity making away from her with terrible strides. Having a chance to enjoy
his society which might never be repeated, fearing lest his rapid disease should carry him
away from before her eyes, she had concluded to make the most of time, dissemble her suffering,
and endeavor to conceal by art the cold bloodlessness of her face. This whimsical, worldly
heroism happened to strike the gentleman strangely. He was affected to the point of proposing
marriage. At the same time he perceived with some amazement that his disease had left him:
the, curative spell of the region had wrought its enchantment upon his system. They were wedded,
with roles reversed--he as the protector and she as the invalid--and were truly happy during
the eighteen months that the lady lived as his wife.

There are prettier and more innocent stories. Every freckle-nosed girl from the Alleghany valleys
who sweeps with her polka-muslin the floors of these generous hotels has an idyl of her own,
which she is rehearsing with young Jefferson Jones or little Madison Addison. In the golden
afternoons they ride together--not in the fine turn-outs supplied by the office-clerks, nor
yet on horse-back, but in guiltless country wagons guided by Jersey Jehus, where close propinquity
is a delightful necessity. Ten miles of uninterrupted beach spread before them, which the ocean,
transformed for the purpose into a temporary Haussmann, is rolling into a marble boulevard
for their use twice a day. On the hard level the wheels scarcely leave a trace. The ride seems
like eternity, it lapses off so gentle and smooth, and the landscape is so impressively similar:
everywhere the plunging surf, the gray sand-hills, the dark cedars with foliage sliced off
sharp and flat by the keen east wind--their stems twisted like a dishclout or like the olives
around Florence.

Or she goes with Jefferson and Madison on a "crabbing" hunt. Out in a boat at the "Thoroughfare,"
near the railroad bridge, you lean over the side and see the dark glassy forms moving on the
bottom. It is shallow, and a short bit of string will reach them. The bait is a morsel of raw
beefsteak from the butcher's, and no hook is necessary. They make for the titbit with strange
monkey-like motions, and nip it with their hard skeleton ringers, trying to tuck it into their
mouths; and so you bring them up into blue air, sprawling and astonished, but tenacious. You
can put them through their paces where they roost under water, moving the beef about, and seeing
them sidle and back on their aimless, Cousin Feenix-like legs: it is a sight to bring a freckle-nosed
cousin almost into hysterics. But one day a vivacious girl had committed the offence of boasting
too much of her skill in crab-catching, besides being quite unnecessarily gracious to Mr. Jefferson
Jones. Then Mr. Madison Addison, who must have been reading Plutarch, did a sly thing indeed.
The boat having been drawn unnoted into deeper water, a cunning negro boy who was aboard contrived
to slide down one side without remark, and the next trophy of the feminine chase was a red
boiled crab, artificially attached to a chocolate caramel, and landed with mingled feelings
by the pretty fisherwoman. Then what a tumult of laughter, feigned anger and becoming blushes!
It is said that that crimson shell, carved into a heart-shape of incorrect proportions, is
worn over Mr. Jones's diaphragm to this day.

At the Inlet, which penetrates the beach alongside the lighthouse, is draught for light vessels,
and the various kinds of society which focus at Atlantic City may be seen concentrated there
on the wharf any of these bright warm days. A gay party of beauties and aristocrats, with a
champagne-basket and hamper of lunch, are starting thence for a sail over to Brigantine Beach.
Two gentlemen in flannel, with guns, are urging a little row-boat up toward the interior country.
They will return at night laden with rail or reed-birds, with the additional burden perhaps
of a great loon, shot as a curiosity. Others, provided with fishing-tackle, are going out for
flounder. Laughing farewells, waving handkerchiefs and the other telegraphic signs of departure,
are all very gay, but the tune may be changed when the great sailing-party comes back, wet
and wretched, and with three of the principal beauties limp as bolsters on the gentlemen's
hands with sea-sickness.

Another spirited scene takes place at five in the morning--an hour when the city beauties are
abed with all that tenacity of somnolence which characterizes Kathleen Mavourneen in the song.
The husbands and brothers, who are due in the city before business hours, are out for a good,
royal, irresponsible tumble in the surf. There is the great yeasty bath-tub, full of merry
dashing figures, dipping the sleek shoulder to the combing wave. On the shore, active humanities
hastily undressing. Then the heavens are filled with a new glory, and the dazzling sun leaves
his bath at the same time with all these merry roisterers who have shared it with him. He takes
up his line of business for the day, and so do the good husbands and brothers, first going
through a little ceremony of toilet from which he is exempt.

Thus does the New Atlantis provide for her republic, holding health to her children with one
hand, and shaking from the other an infinity of toys and diversions; while for those of more
thoughtful bent the sea turns without ceasing its ancient pages, written all over with inexhaustible
romance.

The great architect of the city was the Power who graded those streets of immaculate sand,
and who laid out that park of mellow, foam-flowered ocean. Its human founders have done what
seemed suitable in providing shelter for a throng of fitful sojourners, not forgetting to put
up six neat and modest churches, where suitable praise and adoration may be chanted against
the chanting of the sea. In several respects the place grows somewhat curiously. For instance,
a lawn of turf is made by the simple expedient of fencing off the cattle: the grass then grows,
but if the cows get in they pull up the sod by the roots, and the wind in a single season excavates
a mighty hollow where the grassy slope was before. So much for building our hopes on sand.
An avenue of trees is prepared by the easy plan of thrusting willow-stems into the ground:
they sprout directly, and alternate with the fine native cedars and hollies in clothing the
streets with shadow. Several citizens, as Mr. Richard Wright and Mr. Thomas C. Hand, whose
handsome cottages are tasteful specimens of our seaside architecture, have been tempted by
this facility of vegetable life at Atlantic City to lay out elaborate gardens, which with suitable
culture are successful. Fine avenues of the best construction lead off to Shell Beach or to
the single hill boasted by the locality. Finally, remembering the claims of the great democracy
to a wash-basin, the aediles invited Tom, Dick and Harry, and set up the Excursion or Sea-View
House, with its broad piazzas, its numberless facilities for amusement, and its enormous dining-hall,
which can be changed on occasion into a Jardin Mabille, with flowers and fountains.

To a great city all the renovating and exhilarating qualities of sea-breezes and sea-bathing
are but as the waters of Tantalus, unless the place which offers these advantages be easy of
access. In this respect Atlantic City has for Philadelphia a superiority over all its rivals.
The Camden and Atlantic Railroad, to whose secretary and treasurer, Mr. D.M. Zimmermann, we
are indebted for much information, has simply drawn a straight line to the coast, which may
be reached in an hour and three-quarters from Vine street wharf. The villages on the route,
like the seaside terminus, owe their existence to the road, which is now reaping the reward
of a far-sighted enterprise.

THE ROUMI IN KABYLIA.

CONCLUDING PAPER.

A noble life, whose course belongs to the subject of these pages, is, while they are preparing,
apparently drawing to a close. The severe illness now reported of Abd-el-Kader, coming upon
old age, disappointment, war and the lassitude of a great purpose foiled, can have but one
result. Dimmed to-day, as our hurrying century so rapidly dims her brightest renowns, Abd-el-Kader's
existence has only to cease and his memory will assume the sacred splendor of the tomb.

Hapless Washington of a betrayed revolution! In these latter days of enforced quiet in Palestine
how his early scenes of African experience must have flooded his mind!--his birth, sixty-six
years ago, in a family group of Moslem saints; the teachings of his beautiful mother Leila
and of his marabout father; his pilgrimage when eight years old to Mecca, and his education
in Italy; his visions among the tombs, and the crown of magic light which was seen on his brows
when he began to taste the enchanted apple; then, with adolescence, the burning sense of infidel
tyranny that made his home at Mascara seem only a cage, barred upon him by the unclean Franks;
and soon, while still a youth, his amazing election as emir of Mascara and sultan of Oran,
at a moment when the prophet-chief had just four oukias (half-dimes) tied into the corner of
his bornouse!

"God will send me others," said young Abd-el-Kader.

The tourist remembers the trinity-portrait of him, by Maxime David, in the Luxembourg Gallery
at Paris, where his face, framed in its white hood, is seen in full, in profile and in three-quarters
view. The visage is aquiline, olive-tinted, refined; but we can describe it more authentically
in the terms of one of his enemies, Lieutenant de France, who became his prisoner in 1836,
and who followed his movements for five months, taking down his daily talk and habits like
a Boswell, but leaving nothing in his narrative that is not to the sultan's credit. Of Abd-el-Kader
at twenty-eight the lieutenant says: "His face is long and deadly pale, his large black eyes
are soft and languishing, his mouth small and delicate, and his nose rather aquiline: his beard
is thin, but jet-black, and he wears a small moustache, which gives a martial character to
his soft, delicate face, and becomes him vastly. His hands are small and exquisitely formed,
and his feet equally beautiful." Every interlocutor leaves a similar portrait, impressing upon
the mind the image of some warrior-saint of the Middle Ages, born too late, and beating out
his noble fanaticism against our century of machines and chicanery.

Himself, according to some accounts, a Berber, the young marabout early saw the importance
of inducing the Kabyles to join with him and his Arabs in expelling the French. He affiliated
himself with the religious order of Ben-abd-er-Rhaman, a saint whose tomb is one of the sacred
places of Kabylia; and it is certain that the college of this order furnished him succor in
men and money. He visited the Kabyles in their rock-built villages, casting aside his military
pomp and coming among them as a simple pilgrim. If the Kabyles had received him better, he
could have shown a stouter front to the enemy. But the mountain Berbers, utterly unused to
co-operation and subordination, met him with surprise and distrust.

At least, such is the account of General Daumas: in this interesting relation we are forced
to depend on the French. Daumas, amply provided with documents, letters and evidence, has arranged
in his work on La Grande Kabylie the principal evidence we possess of this epoch of Abd-el-Kader's
life.

The chief appeared in 1836 at Bordj-Boghni and at Si-Ali-ou-Moussa among the mountains. The
Kabyle tribes visited him in multitudes. He addressed them at the door of his tent, and these
rude mountaineers found themselves face to face with that saintly sallow visage, those long
gazelle eyes and the prophetic countenance framed in its apostolic beard. Raising his arms
in the attitude of Raphael's Paul at Lystra, he said simply, "I am the thorn which Allah has
placed in the eye of the Franks. And if you will help me I will send them weeping into the sea."

But when it came to a demand for supplies, the Kabyles, says Daumas, utterly refused.

"You have come as a pilgrim," said their amins, "and we have fed you with kouskoussu. If you
were to come as a chief, wishing to lay his authority on us, instead of white kouskoussu we
should treat you to black kouskoussu" (gunpowder).

Abd-el-Kader, without losing the serenity of the marabout, argued with the Kabyles, and succeeded
in obtaining their reverence and adhesion; but when he mounted his horse to go the amins significantly
told him to come among them always as a simple pilgrim, demanding hospitality and white kouskoussu.

At Thizzi-Ouzzou he met the tribe of Ameraouas, who promised to submit to his authority as
soon as the fractions surrounding that centre should do so. The Sons of Aicha received him
with honor and games of horsemanship. At the camp of Ben Salem the chiefs of several tribes
came to render homage to the noble marabout, descendant of Berber ancestry and of the Prophet.
From thence he sought tribes still more wild, discarding his horse and appearing among the
villagers as a simple foot-pilgrim. The natives approached him in throngs, each family bearing
a great dish of rancid kouskoussu. Laying the platters before his tent and planting their clubs
in them, all vociferated, "Eat! thou art our guest;" and the chieftain was constrained to taste
of each. Finally, near Bougie he happened to receive a courier sent by the French commandant.
The Kabyles immediately believed him to be in treasonable communication with the enemy, and
he was forced to retire.

The young chief was in fact at that time in peaceful communication with the French, having
made himself respected by them in the west, while they were attending to the subjugation of
Constantina and founding of Philippeville in the east. Protected by the treaty of Taafna in
1837, Abd-el-Kader was at leisure to attempt the consolidation of his little empire and the
fusion of the jealous tribes which composed it. The low moral condition of his Arabs, who were
for the most part thieves and cowards, and the rude individuality of his Kabyles, who would
respect his religious but scoff at his political claims, made the task of the leader a difficult
one. To the Kabyles he confided the care of his saintly reputation, renouncing their contributions,
and asking only for their prayers as a Berber and as a khouan of the order of Ben-abd-er-Rhaman.
For a few years his power increased, without one base measure, without any soilure on the blazon
of increasing prosperity. In 1840 the sultan of Oran, at the zenith of his influence, swept
the plains beneath the Atlas with his nomad court, defended by two hundred and fifty horsemen.
Passing his days in reviewing his troops and in actions of splendid gallantry, he resumed the
humility of the saint at evening prayers: his palace of a night received him, watched by thirty
negro tent-guards; and here he sheltered his lowly head, whose attitude was perpetually bowed
by the habitual weight of his cowl. The French soon became jealous, and encroached upon their
treaty. The duke of Orleans, we are told, had Abd-el-Kader's seal counterfeited by a Jewish
coiner at Oran, and with passports thus stamped sent scouting-parties toward the sultan's dominions,
protected by the sultan's forged safe-conduct. Open conflict followed, and a succession of
French razzias. In 1845, Colonels Pelissier and St. Arnaud, under Marshal Bugeaud, conducted
that expedition of eternal infamy during which seven hundred of Abd-el-Kader's Arabs were suffocated
in a cave-sanctuary of the Dahra. This sickening measure was put in force at a cul-de-sac,
where a few hours' blockade would have commanded a peaceful surrender.

"The fire was kept up throughout the night, and when the day had fully dawned the then expiring
embers were kicked aside, and as soon as a sufficient time had elapsed to render the air of
the silent cave breathable, some soldiers were directed to ascertain how matters were within.
They were gone but a few minutes, and then came back, we are told, pale, trembling, terrified,
hardly daring, it seemed, to confront the light of day. No wonder they trembled and looked
pale! They had found all the Arabs dead--men, women, children, all dead!--had beheld them lying
just as death had found and left them--the old man grasping his gray beard; the dead mother
clasping her dead child with the steel gripe of the last struggle, when all gave way but her
strong love."

Abd-el-Kader's final defeat in 1848 was due less to the prowess of Lamoricière and Bugeaud
than to the cunning of his traitorous ally, the sultan of Morocco, who, after having induced
many of the princely saint's adherents to desert, finally drove him by force of numbers over
the French frontier. Confronting the duke of Aumale on the Morocco borders, he made a gallant
fight, but lost half his best men in warding off an attack of the Mencer Kabyles. Fatigued
now with a long effort against overwhelming pressure, and world-weary, he met the duke at Nemours,
on the sea-coast close to the Morocco line. Depositing his sandals, Arab-fashion, outside the
French head-quarters, he awaited the duke's signal to sit down.

"I should have wished to do this sooner," said the broken chief, "but I have awaited the hour
decreed by Allah. I ask the aman (pardon) of the king of the French for my family and for myself."

Louis Philippe could not come in contact with this pure spirit without an exhibition of Frankish
treachery, like tinder illuminating its foulness at the striking of steel. The sultan's surrender
was conditioned on the freedom to retire to Egypt. The French government no sooner secured
him than it treacherously sent him to prison, first to the castle of Pau, then to that of Amboise
near Blois, where he was kept from 1848 to 1852, when the late emperor made an early use of
his imperial power to set him at liberty. Since his freedom, at Constantinople, Broussa and
Damascus the ex-sultan has continued to practice the rigors and holiness of the Oriental saint,
proving his catholic spirit by protecting the Christians from Turkish injustice, and awaiting
with the deep fatigue of a martyr the moment destined to unite his soul with the souls of Washington,
Bozzaris and L'Ouverture.

This noble life, which impinges a moment on our course through Kabylia, is surely the most
epical of our century, which can never be reproached for the lack of a hero while Abd-el-Kader's
name is remembered.

The descent from the rock-perched city of Kalaa having been made in safety, and the animals
being remounted at the first plateau, our Roumi traveler and his guides arrive in a few hours
at the modern, fortified, but altogether Kabylian stronghold of Akbou. Here a letter from a
French personage of importance gives us the acquaintance of a Kabyle family of the highest rank.

The ancestors of Ben-Ali-Cherif, remotely descended from Mohammed through one of his sisters,
were of Kabylian race, and one of them, settled in Chellata, near Akbou, founded there a prosperous
college of the Oriental style. Ben-Ali-Cherif, born in Chellata and residing at Akbou, receives
the tourist with a natural icy dignity which only a czar among the sovereigns of Europe could
hope to equal: those who have but seen Arabs of inferior class can form no notion of the distinction
and lofty gravity of the chiefs of a grand house (or of a grand tent, as they are called):
the Kabyle noble is quite as superb as the Arab.

Ben-Ali seats us at a rich table covered with viands half French and half Oriental: a beautiful
youth, his son, resembling a girl with his blue head-drapery and slim white hands, places himself
at table, and attracts the conversation of the guest. The young man answers in monosyllables
and with his large eyes downcast, and the agha significantly observes, "You will excuse him
if he does not answer: he is not used to talk before his father."

The host, disposing of the time of his guests, has arranged a series of diversions. The valley
of the river Sahel is full of boars, and panthers and monkeys abound in the neighboring spurs
of the Zouaouas. While the Roumi are examining his orchards of oranges and pomegranates the
agha's courtyard fills with guests, magnificent sheikhs on Barbary horses, armed with inlaid
guns. These are all entertained for the night, together with the usual throng of parasites,
who choke his doors like the clients of the rich Roman in Horace.

At sunrise the party is mounted. The mare of the agha, a graceful creature whose veins form
an embroidery over her coat of black satin, is caparisoned with a slender crimson bridle, and
a saddle smaller than the Arab saddles and furnished with lighter stirrups. The Christian guests
are furnished with veritable arquebuses of the Middle Ages; that is to say, with Kabyle guns,
the stock of which, flattened and surmounted with a hammer of flints, is ignited by a wheel-shaped
lock, easier to be managed by a Burgundian under Charles the Bold than by an unpretending modern
Roumi.

The usual features of an Algerian hunt succeed. A phantom-like silence pervades the column
of galloping horsemen up to the moment when the boar is beaten up. Then, with a formidable
clamor of "Haou! haou!" from his pursuers, the tusked monster bursts through the tamarinds
and dwarf palms: after a long chase he suddenly stops, and then his form instantly disappears
under the gigantic African hounds who leap upon him and hang at his ears. A huntsman dismounts
and stabs his shoulder with the yataghan. After a rest the chase is resumed, but this time
under the form of a hawking-party.

Only the djouads and marabouts--that is to say, the religious or secular nobles--have the privilege
of hunting with the falcon. The patrician bird, taken by the agha from the shoulder of his
hawk-bearer, is about as large as a pigeon, the head small, beak short and strong, the claws
yellow and armed with sharp talons. The bird rides upon his master's leather glove until a
hare is started: then, unhooded and released, his first proceeding is to dart into the zenith
as if commissioned to make a hole in the sky. No fear, however, that the poor panting quarry
is lost for an instant from the vision of that infallible eye, which follows far aloft in the
blue, invisible and fatal. Soon the cruel bird drops like an aërolite, and, as the deed is
explained to us, doubles up his yellow hand into a fist, and deals the animal a sharp blow
on the skull. Directly, as the horsemen approach, he is found with his obtuse head bent over
his prey, digging out its eyes by the spoonful.

By noontide the troop is naturally famished. A luncheon, has, however, been prepared by the
thoughtfulness of the agha. Riding up to a tent which appears as by magic in the wilderness,
the provisions for a sumptuous repast are discovered. Two fires are burning in the open air,
and are surrounded by a host of servants or followers. The Roumi and their host adjourn from
the neighborhood of the preparations, and are served under a plane tree beautiful as that whose
limbs were hung by Xerxes with bracelets. A soup, absolutely set on fire with red pepper, introduces
the repast: pancakes follow, and various meats smothered with eggs or onions. Then two half-naked
cooks stagger up bearing on a wooden dish, under a gold-bordered napkin, a sheep roasted entire
and still impaled with the spit. The chief cook takes hold of the skewer and draws it violently
toward himself, applying a smart stroke with his naked heel to the tail of the creature--a
contact which would seem almost as trying as the ancient ordeal of the ploughshares, or as
the red-hot horseshoes which the fire-eating marabouts are accustomed to dance upon. The Roumi
travelers taste the succulent viand, taste again, eat till ashamed, and are ready to declare
that never was mutton properly dressed before. If possible, they vow to introduce the undissected
roast, the bonfire, the spit and the cook with imperturbable heel into the cuisine of less-favored
lands more distant from the sun.

Champagne, which the cunning Mussulmans do not consider as wine, washes the meal, and coffee
and pale perfumed tobacco supplement it. But when the appetite has retired and permitted some
sharpness to the ordinary senses, the travelers are amazed at the gradual and silent increase
which has taken place in their numbers. Every group of guests is augmented by a circle of prone
and creeping forms that, springing apparently from the earth, are busily breaking the fragments
of the feast under the care of the servitors, who appear, rather to encourage than repel them.
Ben-Ali-Cherif, being interrogated, replies calmly, "They are Tofailians."

The Tofailian is a parasite on system, an idler who elevates his belly into a divinity, or
at least a principle. His prophet or exemplar is a certain Tofail, whose doctrine is expressed
in a few practical rules, respectfully observed and numerously followed. "Let him who attends
a wedding-feast," says one of his apophthegms, "having no invitation, avoid glancing here and
there dubiously. Choose the best place. If the guests are numerous, pass through boldly without
saluting any one, to make the guests of the bride think you a friend of the bridegroom, and
those of the groom a friend of the bride."

An Arab poet said of Tofail: "If he saw two buttered pancakes in a cloud, he would take his
flight without hesitation."

A Tofailian of marked genius once learned that a festival was going on at a grand mansion.
He ran thither, but the door was closed and entrance impossible. Inquiring here and there,
he learned that a son of the house was absent on the Mecca pilgrimage. Instantly he procured
a sheet of parchment, folded it, and sealed it as usual with clay: he rolled his garments in
the dust and bent his spine painfully over a long staff. Thus perfect in what an actor would
call his reading, he sent word to the host that a messenger had arrived from his son. "You
have seen him?" said the delighted Amphitryon, "and how did he bear his fatigues?" "He was
in excellent health," answered the Tofailian very feebly. "Speak, speak!" cried the eager father,
"and tell me every detail: how far had he got?" "I cannot, I am faint with hunger," said the
simple fellow. Directly he was seated at the highest place of the feast, and every guest admired
that splendid appetite--an appetite quite professional, and cultivated as poulterers cultivate
the assimilative powers of livers. "Did my son send no letter?" asked the poor father in a
favorable interval caused by strangulation. "Surely," replied the good friend, and, comprehending
that the critical moment had arrived, he drew to himself a chine of kid with one hand while
he unwound the letter from his turban with the other. The seal was still moist, and the pilgrim
had not found time to write anything on the parchment. "Are you a Tofailian?" asked the host
with the illumination of a sudden idea. "Yea, in truth, verily," said the stranger, struggling
with his last mouthful. "Eat, then, and may Sheytan trouble thy digestion!" The parasite was
shown the door, but he had dined.

Men of rank and wealth, like Ben-Ali-Cherif, turn the Tofailian into a proverb, and thus laugh
at a plague they cannot cure.

The Algerine coast has enriched our language with at least two words, respectively warlike
and peaceful--razzia and fantasia. The latter is applied to a game of horsemanship, used to
express joy or to honor a distinguished friend. A spirited fantasia is organized by the guests
of the agha on returning to Akbou. Twenty of the best-mounted horsemen having gone on before,
and being completely lost to sight in the whirlwind of dust created by their departure, all
of a sudden reappear. Menacing their host and his companions like an army, they gallop up,
their bornouses flying and their weapons flashing, until at a few paces they discharge their
long guns under the bodies of the horses opposite, and take flight like a covey of birds. Loading
as they retire and quickly forming, again they dash to the charge, shouting, galloping, and
shooting among the legs of their host's fine horses: this sham attack is repeated a score or
two of times, up to the door of the agha's house. The Bedouins, in their picturesque expression,
are making the powder talk. Finer horsemanship can nowhere be seen. Their horses, accustomed
to the exercise, enter into the game with spirit, and the riders, secure in their castellated
saddles, sit with ease as they turn, leap or dance on two feet. Used, too, from infancy to
the society of their mares, they move with them in a degree of unity, vigor and boldness which
the English horseman never attains. The Arab's love for his horse is not only the pride of
the cavalier: it is an article of faith, and the Prophet comprehended the close unity between
his nation and their beasts when he said, "The blessings of this world, up to the day of judgment,
shall be suspended to the locks which our horses wear between their eyes."

Truly the Oriental idea of hospitality has its advantages--on the side of the obliged party.
This haughty ruler, on the simple stress of a letter from a French commandant, has made himself
our servant and teased his brain for devices to amuse us. His chief cook precedes us to his
birthplace at Chellata, to arrange a sumptuous Arab supper. After a ride made enervating by
the simoom, we descend at the arcaded and galleried Moorish house where Ben-Ali-Cherif was
born, and are visited by the sheikh of the college which the agha maintains. It is a strange,
peaceful, cloistered scene, consecrated to study and hospitality. Chellata, white and silent,
sleeps in the gigantic shadow of the rock Tisibert, and in its graveyard, among the tombs of
sacred marabouts, walk the small bald-headed students reciting passages of law or of the Koran.
Algeria is dotted over with institutions (zaouias) similar to this, which, like monasteries
of old, combine the functions of seminaries and gratuitous inns. That of Ben-Ali-Cherif, to
which he contributes from his own purse a sum equal to sixteen thousand dollars a year, is
enshrined in buildings strewn around the resting-place of his holy ancestors. The sacred koubba
(or dome) marking the bones of the marabout is swept by shadows of oak and tamarind trees:
professors stray in the shadow, and the pupils con their tasks on the adjoining tombstones.

Every impression of Chellata is silvered over, as with a moonlight of beneficence, by the attentions
of Ben-Ali's house-steward, who rains upon our appetites a shower of most delicious kouskoussu,
soothes us with Moorish coffee, and finishes by the politeness of lighting and taking the first
whiff of our cigarette--a bit of courtesy that might be spared, but common here as in parts
of Spain.

With daybreak we find the town of Chellata preparing to play its rôle as a mart or place of
industry. The labor seems at first sight, however, to be confined to the children and the women:
the former lead the flocks out at sunrise to pasture in the mountain, the women make the town
ring with their busy work, whether of grinding at the mill, weaving stuff or making graceful
vases in pottery. The men are at work in the fields, from which they return at nightfall, sullen,
hardy and silent, in their tattered haiks. These are never changed among the poor working-people,
for the scars of a bornouse are as dignified as those of the body, and are confided with the
garment by a father to his son. The women, as we have remarked before, are in a state of far
greater liberty than are the female Arabs, but it is more than anything else the liberty to
toil. Among these mountaineers the wife is a chattel from whom it is permissible to extract
all the usefulness possible, and whom it is allowable to sell when a bargain can be struck.
The Kabyle woman's sole recreation is her errand to the fountain. This is sometimes situated
in the valley, far from the nodding pillar or precipice on which the town is built. There the
traveler finds the good wives talking and laughing together, bending their lively--sometimes
blonde and blue-eyed--faces together over their jars, and gossiping as in Naples or as in the
streets around Notre Dame in Paris. The Kabyles--differing therein from the Arabs--provide
a fountain for either sex; and a visit by a man to the women's fountain is charged, in their
singular code of penal fines, "inspired by Allah," a sum equal to five dollars, or half as
much as the theft of an ox.

By the white light of day-dawn we quit Chellata, with the naked crests of the Djurjura printing
themselves on the starry vault behind us and the valley below bathed in clouds. As we descend
we seem to waken the white, red-roofed villages with our steps. The plateaus are gradually
enlivened with spreading herds and men going forth to labor. We skirt the precipice of Azrou-n'hour,
crowned with its marabout's tomb. The plains at our feet are green and glorious, pearled with
white, distant villages. Opposite the precipice the granite rocks open to let us pass by a
narrow portal where formerly the Kabyles used to stand and levy a toll on all travelers. This
straitened gorge, where snow abounds in winter, and which has various narrow fissures, is named
the Defile of Thifilkoult: it connects the highways of several tribes, but is impassable from
December to April from the snow and the storms which rage among the cliffs. We are still four
thousand feet above the plain, whose depth the swimming eye tries in vain to fathom, yet the
snowy peaks above us are inaccessible. Descending chains of rocks mingled with flint and lime,
we attain a more clement landscape. Kabyle girls crowd around a well called the Mosquitoes'
Fountain, a naked boy plays melancholy tunes on a reed, and the signs of a lower level are
abundant in the fields of corn and orchards of olive. But the rugged mountains, in whose grasp
we have found so many wonders, are not left without regret. The most picturesque part of our
course is now behind us, and as day dies upon our crossing through Iferaouenen, we turn back
to behold the fine line of the mountains, half sad and regretful,

  While Jove's planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.

Fourteen expeditions were found necessary by the French between 1838 and 1857 to subdue the
Kabyles, who under leaders such as Ben-Salem, Ben-Kassim, the Man-with-the-Mule, the Man-with-the-She-Ass,
and other chiefs less celebrated, defended their territory step by step. In the great chastisement
of 1857, Marshal Randon, after subduing this part of the Djurjura ridge in detail, determined
to preserve the fruits of victory by two new constructions--a fort and a military road. France
was to reside among her unwilling colonists, and she was to possess an avenue of escape. The
building of these two conveniences, as we may call them, over the smoking ruins of victory,
was a conspicuous example of the excellent engineering genius of the nation. An English officer,
Lieutenant-colonel Walmsley, witnessed, and has left a spirited account of, the great conquest,
and the immediate improvement of it. The strongholds of the Djurjura (it being May, 1857) were
taken: the most difficult, Icheriden, was soon to fall, yielding only to the assault of the
Foreign Legion--that troop of Arabs and of Kabyles from the Zouaoua plain wherefrom we derive
the word zouave. Marshal Randon selected for his fort the key of the whole district: it was
a place known as the Souk-el-Arba ("Market of Wednesday"). It was in the heart of the Beni
Raten land, and in a spot where three great mountain-ridges ran down into the plain of the
Sebaou. These ridges, subdued and friendly, would be held in respect by the garrison of the
fort, and the other ridge of Agacha, still rebellious, would likewise terminate at the fort.
The works were immediately laid out and quickly built. As the road sprang into its level flight
like magic, the peeping Kabyles, perfectly unaware that they were conquered, laughed in derision.
"It is to help the cowards to run away," they said. In due time rose the pale walls of the
citadel, with mountains above and hills below. The Kabyles call it the White Phantom. Their
songs, the "traditions" of illiterate tribes, recite the building of the terrible stronghold:
"The Roumi has arrived at the Market: he is building there. Weep, O my eyes! tears of blood.
The children of Raten are valiant men: they are known as masters of the warlike art. They fell
upon the enemy at Icheriden. The Franks fell like lopped branches. Glory to those brave men!
But the Roumi has peeled us like seeds. The powder talks no more. The warlike men are fainting.
Cover thyself with mourning, O my head!"

As the tourist turns the summit of Aboudid suddenly appears, like an ornamental detail in a
panorama, this vast fortress, originally named Fort Napoléon, and since the collapse of the
empire called Fort National. During the French troubles of 1871, in the month of August, General
Cérès was obliged to inspire terror by burning the village of Thizzi-Ouzzou beneath, and then
went on to relieve the fort. When the next opportunity will occur for the Beni Raten to assert
their rights it is impossible to tell. We descend from the fort, and all becomes commonplace.
The charred ruins of Thizzi-Ouzzou in its valley-bed are being replaced by new buildings. All
wears a look of every-day thrift. The Arab, moving his household goods, drives before him his
poor dingy wife, loaded down with worthless valuables and also with copper jewels, in which
she clanks like a fettered slave. A negro musician from the Desert, a true African minstrel,
capers before us and beats the tom-tom, until, distracted with his noise, we pay him and bombard
him off the face of the road with projectiles.

From Thizzi-Ouzzou to Algiers it is but four hours' journey, and the four hours are passed
in a diligence. Yes, our circumstances are subdued to the conditions of the diligence! Adieu,
our spahi guides, like figures from Lalla Rookh! Adieu, our dream of an African Switzerland!
The Roumi, outside of Kabylia, quickly fades into the light of common day, and becomes plain
Tom or Harry.

A REMINISCENCE OF THE EXPOSITION OF 1867.

"And you traveled alone?"

"There were two of us--Annie Foster and I."

"You found no difficulty?"

"Not a bit," she replied laughing.

"But you had adventures: I see it in your face."

"Who would travel without adventures?" and she made an expressive gesture.

"Romantic?"

"Hm!--tant soit peu."

"I am all attention: begin."

"You promise not to tell?"

"Not for the world: torture could not induce me to divulge a single word."

"Well, the way it came about was this: Annie and I had been sent from England to a small French
town on the coast, for the benefit of the warm sea-water baths. It was a quaint little port;
all the houses reminded you of ships in their fitting up; the beds were set into the wall like
berths; closets were stowed away in all sorts of impossible places; the floors were uncarpeted
and white as a main deck; and articles from distant countries hung about the walls or stood
in the corners--East Indian sugar-cane, cotton from America, Chinese crockery and piles of
sea-shells. The great sea by which we lodged was represented everywhere. Our food was fish,
shrimps and water-fowl--our acquaintance, fishermen, shrimpers and sailors. The leading event
of the day was the coming in and going out of the tide, and ducks and geese were the chief
domestic animals. On one side was a prospect of wind-tossed waves and the sails of ships, on
the other wind-beaten fields and the sails of mills: the few cabins that had rashly ventured
beyond the protection of the village shortly lost courage, and, with their thatched roofs not
a yard from the earth, seemed crouching low to avoid the continuous blasts. The church alone
on the high sea-wall raised itself fearlessly against the tyrant, and though his baffled voice
still howled without, within the pious prayed securely before a faith-inspiring altarpiece
of Christ stilling the tempest.

"In a few weeks, after we had exhausted every amusement that the dull town afforded, become
intimate with all the old gossips, tired of listening to the yarns of the pilot-tars off duty,
driven the donkeys over the country until they instinctively avoided us whenever we appeared,
sailed in the bay and suffered periodic attacks of sea-sickness therefrom, finished the circulating
library, and half learned some barbarous sentences of Norman patois, we sat down disconsolate
one afternoon to devise some means of employing the remainder of our time. It was then that
the bright idea struck Annie, and she exclaimed, 'Let us go to the Paris Exposition!'

"'Just the thing!' I answered with enthusiasm. 'I wonder when the next train starts?'

"'I'll go and inquire: you begin and pack the trunks. If we can get off to-day, by to-morrow
morning we can begin seeing it;' and she left the room in great excitement.

"The result was, that by seven o'clock that evening we had made our hasty preparations, and
were ready to set out. It was raining terribly when the only hack of the village (which, by
the by, was an omnibus) called for us at the door. The dripping fluid oozed and sparkled over
the blinking lamps, the ribbed sides of the antiquated machine were varnished with moisture,
and the horses looked as if each hair was a water-spout to drain the sky. Noah's patriarchal
mansion might have presented a similar appearance during the first days of that celebrated
wet season.

"The motherly woman with whom we had been boarding turned dismally from the weather to her
invalids and tried to dissuade us from leaving that night, little understanding that we considered
it 'fun.' As a parting advice she told us to call each other madame: it would procure us more
consideration. 'For you know, young ladies,' she remonstrated mildly, 'it is not quite proper
for you to travel alone.' After this prudent counsel and many warm adieus we sallied forth.

"The omnibus was crowded, and I had perforce to sit on Annie's knees. This, with the jolting,
the queer effect of the half-light in the rickety interior, together with the expression of
the good people, who evidently could see no fun in rain, excited my risibility so strongly
that I indulged in a smothered laugh, tempered to fit the publicity of the occasion.

"'You must not laugh in France,' whispered Nan, pulling my dress.

"'I thought the French admired gayety,' I answered in the same tone.

"'Be quiet: it isn't proper.'

"The rest of the way was accomplished in silence. We soon arrived at the station and bought
our tickets. Of course we had half a dozen bundles: in gathering them up a most gentlemanly
person accosted us and asked, 'Avez vous perdu quelque chose, mademoiselle?'

"Annie replied in the negative with great dignity, and so cut off any chance of adventure in
that quarter.

"On came the train. In France there is fortunately a provision made for women traveling without
an escort. In your country they have, I believe, smoking-cars especially for the gentlemen:
in that blessed land there is a compartment for 'ladies alone,' or Dames Seules, as it is called.
A good American once read this inscription with much commiseration, D---- souls, and returning
told his friends that the 'wicked' French allowed His Satanic Majesty the right of running
a special car on their roads for his greater accommodation.

"As we were hastening to this most desired refuge I noticed two very student-looking young
men walking near us, and caught a bit of their conversation.

"'They will.'

"'They won't: a bottle of wine on it we go up in the same car with them.'

"'I told you so!'

"As we found our car and entered the students passed on, not daring to ignore the magic words
on the door; so Adventure No. 2 was nipped in the bud.

"Nan and I were the only lady-passengers, and we sank back into the soft cushions with the
pleasant sense that no further effort would be needed during the journey. We had been told
that the train would arrive in Paris about midnight, but the lateness of the hour caused us
no uneasiness, as we had been there before and remembered the city pretty well; and, besides,
we thoroughly believed in our ability to take care of ourselves.

"In an interval of wakefulness we discussed our plans, and concluded to spend the night at
some hotel near the station, the next morning looking up our friends (several of whom we knew
to be in town) and consulting them about our future proceedings, feeling that a midnight visit
from us would scarcely be welcome to any one. Annie recalled a fine-looking hotel just opposite
the terminus, and, having made our selection in its favor, we dozed off again very comfortably.

"I think we had been on the way some four hours when the welcome lights began to appear--first
in the sky above the city, as if the earth in this favored spot threw out rays like the sun;
next through the darkness over the country below; and then we plunged tunnel-wise into the
earth under the busy streets and fortifications, to emerge at the end of our route.

"We gathered up our bundles in haste, thanking the stars that we had accomplished our ride
so safely, and were walking off to the hotel when we suddenly thought of the trunks. Another
consultation was held, and we decided to leave them in the baggage-room until morning.

"'But we must go and see that they are safe,' suggested Annie.

"'Where is the baggage-room?' I asked of a porter.

"'This way, mademoiselle.'

"'Madame!' I ventured to correct in a weak voice.

"'Vos clefs, s'il vous plait,' said a polite official as we entered the door, and another laid
hands on the satchels we carried, to examine them.

"We had entirely forgotten the octroi officers. 'Oh my! this affair may keep us another half
hour,' thought I, 'and I am so sleepy!' I have often found (I confide this to you as an inviolable
secret) that to be unreasonable is a woman's strongest weakness: it is a shield against which
man's sharpest logic is invariably turned aside. The next thing to there not being a necessity,
is not seeing a necessity, and this I prepared in the most innocent manner to do.

"'Gracious me!' I exclaimed--or its French equivalent, which I suppose is 'Mon Dieu'--'you
don't mean to detain us here opening those bags, and we so tired, and they packed so full that
we could scarcely shut them; and if you do open them, we cannot get all the things into them
again, and shall have no end of trouble!' Then I looked as injured as if they had been thieves
or highway-men.

"Had a man made this speech they would have mistrusted him, but as women have a reputation
for shallowness, such talk is never thought suspicious in them.

"'What do they contain?' asked the officer, hesitating.

"'I don't know what all: we have been at the sea-side, and they are full of trash. There are
some shells and an old hat in mine, and--and things.'

"He tried to conceal a smile, and looked toward the other, who nodded, and we saw the welcome
'O' put on in chalk, upon which the bags were given back to us.

"'Now the trunks,' said the first who had spoken, holding out his hand for the keys.

"'Oh, we are going to leave them here till to-morrow: they are all right--you can mark them
too;' and without further ceremony we moved toward the door. One of the men stepped after us.
I thought it was to make us return, but it was only to ask if he should get us a carriage.

"We thanked him and replied that we were going to the hotel opposite, and did not need one:
he then turned to a person who seemed to be the porter of the establishment, and told him to
carry our satchels for us. Now we felt our journey was well at an end, for the windows of our
welcome asylum were blazing not more than a hundred feet off.

"We crossed the street, rang at the ladies' entrance and asked for rooms. After a few moments
the servant returned, and, much to our chagrin, said that there were none to be had, every
corner was full.

"'Do let us see the clerk. We must have a room: you can surely find us one somewhere.'

"The man shook his head.

"'Please go and try,' we insisted: 'we shall be satisfied with anything for the night. Won't
you go and ask again?'

"'It is of no use,' he answered obstinately, à cause de l'Exposition;' and he opposed a shrug
of his shoulders to every other effort at persuasion that we made.

"Just then a chambermaid passed. 'Do come here,' I called. 'Can't you find us a room? I will
pay you;' and I put my hand significantly in my pocket.

"'Very sorry, ladies, but it is impossible,'

"This was a contingency we had not provided for: we looked at each other blankly, and, though
loath to do so, we both came to the conclusion that they were telling the truth.

"'What shall we do?' asked Annie, speaking to me in English.

"'I suppose we shall have to take a carriage and go down town, after all,'

"'They may be full there too,' she said in a rueful tone.

"Just then the porter with our satchels spoke: 'There is another hotel near, ladies, and if
you will come I will show you to it,'

"I consulted Annie with a look, and she assented. Any prospect was better than a midnight drive
of several miles, with no certainty as to our lot at the end of it. So we turned from the inhospitable
door and followed our guide.

"The latter walked quickly for perhaps a square, stopped before a neat-looking house and rang.
Our courage rose as the door opened and revealed a clean-looking court surrounded by orange
trees in boxes, with small coffee-tables under them for the convenience of the guests.

"'Rooms for two ladies!' demanded our attendant with the voice of a herald.

"The trim but sleepy servant looked at us a moment, as if not comprehending the situation,
then slowly pronounced our sentence in two words, 'No rooms!' and as if to emphasize them threw
up the palms of his hands, shook his head and added 'Full!' after which he closed the door
with a hasty click and returned to his nap.

"Our night-errant was visibly disappointed with this reception--not more so than we were--but
without allowing us time to speak he said in his most reassuring voice, 'Never mind, ladies:
there are plenty of hotels about here, and we shall soon find lodgings for you.' Having undertaken
the task, he seemed to think it his duty to comfort and provide for us.

"Alas! this was not soon accomplished. Two other hotels were successively tried in vain, and
still our indefatigable guide went on. It appeared as if we had walked a considerable distance,
but the streets cut each other at odd angles, and we had been turning so often that I confess
I had but little idea where we were, or how far we had come, when we entered a quarter where
the ways became narrower, passed into a dingy alley, thence plunged through a still darker
court, from that to another alley, and the next moment our porter was ringing at the door of
a tall, sombre house. I truly hoped that we should not find rooms here, and was turning to
Annie to advise a cab and an attempt in a more civilized-looking locality, when the bell was
answered and the old question repeated.

"To my surprise and dismay the servant said they could accommodate us. Should we stay? I knew
that in the older parts of Paris the best of houses are sometimes found in the poorer streets,
and that in no city is a person less able to judge of the interior comfort of a building by
its external aspect. We were very tired, and should we turn away from this open door where
should we find another open for us? The porter, however good-natured, could not continue to
run about with us all night, and our faith in ourselves was considerably diluted since we left
the cars: even a cab might be difficult to get at this hour of the night. Annie did not object:
indeed, she looked too worn out to have an opinion in the matter, and as I could think of nothing
better to do, I began to make the usual inquiries: 'Have you two adjoining rooms?'

"'Yes, mademoiselle.'

"I remembered the advice that had been given us on starting: here surely was a place to use
it, so I said to the servant in a marked tone, 'Take madame's bag and show us to our chambers.'

"'This way, mesdemoiselles,' he answered with the most provoking coolness.

"I dismissed our faithful porter with regret, and followed the other up stairs. While ascending
I racked my brain to determine what peculiarity of manner we could adopt that would give us
a more matronly air while traveling, but I could think of nothing. I may as well tell you now
that we never for an instant deceived any one on this subject during our stay, and we soon
ceased trying to do so.

"Our rooms were much better than I had expected to find them, but even this caused in me a
feeling of doubt. They had a hypocritical air, a grasping after appearances that I believe
always accompanies deceit and imposition--a sleek shabbiness that I detest. I knew by instinct
that if I examined I should find the carpets worn out under the mats, and the chairs faded
beneath their smart chintz covers. There was not a candid-looking piece of furniture in the
apartment: the table was an impostor with one short leg; the drawers of the bureau would not
open; the glasses were all askew, and twisted your face to such a degree that it frightened
you to catch a glimpse of yourself in passing. But this was not the worst: from the moment
I entered the rooms I felt that they had been waiting for us.

"I did not venture to mention my suspicions to Annie, and tried to keep up a cheery sort of
conversation while we undressed, but I could see that she too began to be uneasy. We carefully
inspected our doors, and found the locks were good, then looked to see that there was no one
lurking under the beds. It would be difficult to tell you exactly what I feared, but somehow
everything impressed me as mysterious--the quiet of the streets through which we had come,
and the quiet of the house. It was such a lonely, eerie kind of place: our feet echoed on the
stairways as if human feet seldom ascended them; the shadows appeared especially dark; our
candles' small light made little impression on the gloom; the very air seemed harder to breathe
than ordinary; and on recalling the face of the impertinent servant I thought that it had a
sinister look.

"I tried to recall whether we were in a good or bad faubourg, but could not; and then I remembered
that Paris was now divided into arrondissements, which had a much less ill-omened sound. I
went to the window to reconnoitre the locality, but, though the rain had ceased, darkness covered
all so thickly that I could see nothing. As I stood there the clock on the station struck,
first the quarters, and then one, in a doleful, muffled tone. It told me one thing I was glad
to know--namely, that we could not have wandered very far during our walk; but there was little
comfort in that, after all, since the walk had terminated here.

"Stories that I had read of strange adventures and accidents to midnight guests now trooped
into my head. I thought of one in particular, in which the tester of the bed slowly descended
to smother the sleeping inmate for purposes of robbery; whereupon I minutely examined mine,
and found to my satisfaction that it was scarcely able to discharge the single duty of holding
up the curtains, and looked most innocent of further intentions. Finding myself again peering
into corners I had already searched, and feeling this general unrest to be growing upon me,
I began to think I must be nervous from over-exertion, and determined to get rid of my silly
fancies in sleep. Then, as if to take myself by surprise, I suddenly blew out the light, sprang
under the covers and shut my eyes tight, afraid that something hateful might glare upon me
in the dark.

"Just then Annie came to the communicating doorway, and with an effort to speak in her natural
voice she said, 'Jane, I am going to sleep here.' And as if this endeavor had consumed her
last bit of resistance, she closed and locked the door quickly, ran to my bed and threw herself
shivering beside me.

"'What is the matter?' I whispered, feeling my presentiment of evil confirmed.

"She put her lips to my ear and answered, 'I found a door in my room behind the bed-curtains,
and it leads I don't know where."

"'Did you open it?'

"'No indeed! I would not open it for the world. There might be something horrible in it;' and
she shuddered.

"'You have left your light burning.'

"'I don't care. I won't go back: no indeed, I could not.' There was silence for a few minutes:
neither of us moved, when Nan again whispered, 'Do you think this room quite safe?'

"'I looked all around before I blew out the light.'

"'Did you look behind your curtains?'

"'No!' I answered with an uncomfortable sensation.

"'You are next the wall: feel along it,' in her most persuasive voice.

"The very idea made me creep. Put my hand behind those curtains and touch--what? Even the cold
wall would be sufficient to terrify me. For reply I remarked suggestively, 'If we had the light
we could see.'

"'Yes, that would be just the thing. Go bring it--do!'

"I felt that something must be done, and soon, or I should be in no state to accomplish it.
If Nan would not go, I must: when we had the light half our trouble would be over, and, after
all, she might have been mistaken.

"'Did the door move?' I ventured to ask.

"'No, it didn't do anything--at least I don't think it did--but it looked so awful that it
frightened me.'

"'That light in there may set something on fire,' I remarked.

"'Go fetch it: it will only take you a minute. Do go!'

"'You are sure the door didn't open?' I asked, far from liking my task.

"'I will go with you half-way,' she volunteered, 'and stand there while you run in quick. Come
on, and don't let us talk any more about it: we shall only get more and more frightened.' You
will see that Annie's gifts lay more in persuasion than in action.

"Thus adjured, I went with her to the communicating door, cautiously listened, then looked
through the keyhole. The silence within was oppressive, but the flickering bougie warned me
that I must make an effort, and without allowing myself time to think I hastily turned the
key and opened the door.

"At that moment it seemed to me that I heard distant footsteps. I rushed for the light and
turned to go back, when I ran against some one: the candle was extinguished by being jerked
from the holder to the floor, and a hand which I vainly tried to shake off clasped my arm.
My blood grew thick and still with sudden terror. I tried to speak, but could not. What increased
my dread was that I could not tell whether the Thing by my side was a reality or a spectre.
I had caught a glimpse of something white as the light disappeared, and I believe that a pistol
at my head would have caused me less alarm than this horrible idea of the supernatural. I began
to feel that I could endure it no longer, that I should stifle, should die, when Annie's voice
spoke in the darkness quite near, and I found it was she who had grasped my arm.

"'I could not stay in that room alone,' she whispered. 'Don't you hear?--footsteps! They are
coming.'

"'You have half frightened me to death,' I murmured trembling: 'I thought you were something.'

"'No, I ain't anything, but something is coming. Don't you hear?'

"It was true enough. Through the quiet of the house came stealthy footsteps. Nearer, nearer.
They were ascending the stairs, at times delaying an instant, as if groping for the way, then on.

"'Come into your room,' said Annie convulsively: 'come, and we can lock ourselves in. Oh, where
is your door? I cannot find it, and they are coming. What shall we do? what shall we do?'

"We were in total darkness: not a ray of light came from the window, and in our confusion we
had lost our bearings. Neither of us had the least idea in what direction the other room lay.

"'Let us creep along the floor, perhaps we may find it. Do try,' said I.

"'No, no, I cannot move. I wish we had never come. I am dying.' She was shaking with fright,
and would not leave my arm for an instant.

"Just then, from somewhere near us, we could not tell from what side, came a long low whistle,
so mournful and unearthly, with such a summons in its tone, that I shivered: then a faint movement
followed from the same place.

"'It is a signal for the other,' gasped Annie: 'it is in that door: they are coming, they are
here. Shall I scream murder? shall I?' giving my arm an emphasizing grip.

"'No, no, wait: it will do no good.'

"She groaned, slipped down on her knees, with one arm still round me, her face pressed against
my side, holding her other hand over the unprotected ear, so that she should hear no more;
and in this position she began to repeat 'Now I lay me down to sleep' just as fast as she could
gabble it.

"I was no less frightened, and would willingly have crouched down also, but she held me so
tight that I could not without a struggle, and above all things I did not want to make a noise.

"It was thus we awaited the crisis. The steps were certainly coming to our room, but whether
by the door we had entered or by the one Annie had seen behind the bed, I could not tell. I
was too bewildered to locate the sound, nor did I know whether the bed was at my right or left
hand. I had a slight hope that the steps might pass on.

"It was for that I waited.

"They came--near, nearer. For a time my heart ceased beating. Annie slipped lower, until she
lay on the floor, and I could no longer hear her breathe. My whole being was merged in listening
to that step. I could feel that now it was on a level with our room--was there almost beside
us. Lightly though distinctly a hand passed over the door, as if fumbling for the latch. This
was the intense moment. Had the person paused or hesitated an instant, I think it would have
killed us both. But no, he did not falter. Steadily on, the step, guided by the hand, went
as it had come, and as I stood, not daring to move, I heard it receding in the distance of
the great house. Then all was silence.

"When sensation returned to me I felt as if I had awakened from a nightmare, and found myself
shaking from the nervous reaction and the cold. I stooped to find poor Nan on the floor, and
said through my chattering teeth, 'It must have been only a late boarder. Don't be afraid.
It is all over: come, get up.'

"'Can't you get a light?' she begged. 'I cannot move until you have a light. I am still afraid.'

"I now remembered that the bureau must be behind me, for I had merely turned when I encountered
Annie and dropped the candle. There were probably matches upon it: yes, there they were. I
struck one and easily found the candle: then Annie rose with the meekest air possible, and,
without looking at the obnoxious corner where the bed stood, we walked into the other room
and locked the door.

"It was not until the gray morning light crept into the window that we felt quite safe. Every
crack in the floor or nibbling mouse caused us to start, and at each quarter the clock of the
station would strike as if to warn us to be on the alert. But the bed was not bad, and the
house remained quiet; and as soon as the dawn made our candle useless, we began to think we
had been very foolish, and the result was a sound sleep.

"When we awoke it was ten o'clock: the morning was bright and clear, and the terrors of the
night had all departed during our refreshing rest. The room certainly looked shabby, but if
that were a crime, half the houses in the world would be sent to prison. There was nothing
in the least mysterious about it. Our courage rose with the day, and we teased and joked each
other about our fright. Then, anticipating the glories of the Exposition, we congratulated
ourselves that we had come.

"'We won't breakfast here,' said Annie as she was dressing: 'we will go down town to a nice
restaurant, and sit at a window and see the people go by. Afterward we will look up our friends
and find a good hotel or boarding-house; and we must go to the Exposition this very day. We
shall have a famous time. We can make up parties to drive out, and go monument-hunting and
sight-seeing, and to the theatre. Ain't you glad you came?'

"'The first thing we do must be to go back to the station and leave these bags with our trunks
until we find lodgings,' I remarked.

"Nan went into the next room to get some of the clothing she had left there. When she returned,
lowering her voice she said, 'Jane, there is a door behind my curtains.'

"'Very well, let it alone: I suppose it is a closet.'

"'No such thing: it don't look like a closet; and why would they hide a closet, I should like
to know? Come in and see it.'

"She walked back, and as I followed drew the curtain aside, and there in fact it was.

"'I am going to open it before I leave the room,' she said in a determined tone: 'there is
something not right about it.'

"'I wouldn't,' I remonstrated: 'some one may be in there.'

"'I am going to see: I must look into it. It is daylight, you know, and we sha'n't be much
frightened. Help me to push away the bed.'

"'I won't do anything so absurd. This is a hotel, Annie, and there must be plenty of adjoining
rooms in it. Suppose that room is now occupied by a boarder?'

"'If it is occupied they will lock the door on the other side, and I will try the latch softly
to see; but I know it is not. Don't you see that the only entrance must be from here? There
is the entry. opposite, and here is the court: now, how could any one get into it but through
this room? It must be a small place, too, for here is the corner of the house, and it has been
evidently planned to be kept concealed."

"'No matter: we have no right to any rooms but these we are in. Come away, and let well enough
alone.'

"'It is not "well enough," as you call it. I am going to see into it, and why they hide it.
I declare,' and she examined the door critically, 'it looks like the entrance to Bluebeard's
chamber. Look at these queer marks, these dents and stains, as if there had been a struggle.
It is our duty to investigate;' and her voice grew impressive. 'Perhaps we have been brought
here for that very purpose, and, Jane, if there is a dead body in there, I shall inform the
police.' Annie was very brave in daylight.

"'Fiddle-de-dee!' I replied to this fine speech. 'What you call duty, I call curiosity. I am
ravenously hungry, and I wish you would finish dressing and let us get to breakfast.'

"'I will just tell you this,' she answered indignantly, and yet with a quiver in her voice,
'I never in my life felt as I did last night when I saw that door. It was quite like what people
write of a mysterious influence, or the presence of some one unseen; and that whistle or voice
or moan, as if a soul was calling, came from here; and you must help me to find out what it
really was, for I can't go away without knowing.'

"I saw it was useless to try longer to dissuade her. The bed moved easily: she took my hand
and led me behind it; then warily tried the latch. It rose, but she was obliged to lean all
her weight against the door before it would give way, and finally it opened so unexpectedly
that she almost fell forward.

"What did I see? At the first glimpse a faint light from a cobwebbed window, a narrow room
and a floor--red. Was it blood? A sickening mouldy smell came forth, but as I forced myself
to look again I saw that it was only red tiles that had startled me. There was an upright brick
range in a corner, an old water-tank, some shelves and a cupboard. A missing pane of glass
left a space through which the air had entered and moaned up the broad-mouthed flue that opened
above the range. This was the ominous 'signal' we had heard in answer to the footsteps. The
dust was thick over everything, and the only signs of life were the rat-tracks on the floor.
We stood still for a few moments, overwhelmed at this solution of the occult 'influence' that
had so subtly acted on Annie's nerves, and filled me with no less terror.

"The house had been built for a hôtel garni; that is, a house with furnished rooms or apartments,
something like a tenement-house in your country. This was the kitchen of the suite, and belonged
to the two rooms we had taken. Being unused for its proper object, and too small for a bed-chamber,
it had been closed, and appeared as if it had been unentered for years. I turned to Annie to
see how she would bear this prosaic explanation of our alarm, but with the air of one who had
expected nothing but this from the beginning, she remarked, 'Now you see how much better it
is to look into such things. This room would have furnished me with bad dreams for the remainder
of my life, and here I find it is only a commonplace kitchen. Think how ludicrous to have the
horrors over a kitchen! Sha'n't I tell of your fright when we get home--how you didn't want
to open the door, and wanted to 'let well enough alone'? The place might be haunted by the
ghost of a chicken or a rabbit, but, my dear, you should not allow that to terrify you.'

"'Perhaps it was the ghost of a chicken that you feared last night, and that caused your presentiments
this morning. I hope you will inform the police of what you have discovered here,' I remarked
quietly.

"'A truce, a truce, good Jane! I will say no more. We were both boobies. But wouldn't it be
'cute to live here, you and me, and make our own breakfast? Look at the hole for charcoal,
and the little cupboard, the nails for the pots and pans to hang on: everything is complete.
That room could be for dining, the other a parlor, and--'

"'The only drawback would be that, except at the North Pole, the night comes once in twenty-four
hours.'

"'Don't be mean, Jane! Do come in here a minute: it's a dear little place.'

"'You will certainly make a housekeeper if a kitchen gives you such ecstasy. Come out, I am
so hungry. Put on your bonnet and leave this elysium: I have had enough of it.'

"'You come in for a second: it will shake the terror off and you won't dream of it. That is
a cure my old nurse once gave me for laying ghosts.'

"'It may be a good plan to shake off the terror, but the dust on you will not be shaken off
so easily.'

"'Suppose,' and she stamped her foot--'suppose that the floor should be hollow, and that this
were only a pretended kitchen after all, or that there was a trap-door painted to resemble
tiles, or a sliding panel.' Here she felt over the surface of the wall. 'Why should I feel
so queer last night if this was really nothing but a kitchen?'

"'Because you are a goose,' I answered impatiently, 'and if you don't come I will leave you.
If you like, you can engage boarding here for a week, and raise the tiles one by one with a
knife and fork. As for me, I am going to breakfast.'

"'But don't you think it really has an uncanny look?' she asked, giving a last glance over
her shoulder as she came out.

"'If you call dirt uncanny, there is plenty of that. Shut the door, and I will push back the bed.'

"'Jane,' she again remarked as she was trying on her bonnet before the crooked glass, 'if ever
I tell of this night, I think I will say that there was a trap-door in the kitchen: you know
there might be one and we not see it.'

"'Oh yes,' I answered as patiently as I could, 'I suppose a fib more or less will make but
little difference in your lifetime. While you are at it, however, you may as well make a few
more additions.'

"'Now you are unkind.'

"'A person is not accountable for temper when famishing. Take up your satchel.'

"We found the house a most every-day-looking house, seen by sunlight; but there had lain the
difficulty. The clerk in the office did not particularly resemble a cutthroat, or even a cutpurse,
and, strange to say, did not overcharge us: in fact, he behaved very civilly. We found we were
not far from the station, and depositing our bags there, we walked down the beautiful Rue La
Fayette.

"'It is a great deal pleasanter to travel alone in this way,' said Nan gayly, her spirits rising
in the delightful air. 'When I was here before with all the family, it was not near so jolly;
and I think we manage well, don't you? Oh, there is an omnibus not complet: let us get in.
I am too hungry to walk.'

"After we were seated she continued: 'I wonder what will happen to us to-night. Suppose we
find every place full, and have to sleep in a garden or on the steps of a church, or something?
Isn't it delightful not to know in the least what is going to happen next?--just as in fairy-land.
Don't you hope we may have an adventure every night?'

"'I should not call last night an adventure: it seems to me it was more like a panic,' I said
drily.

"'You will never let anything be agreeable,' in a hurt tone: then recovering her good temper,
she went on: 'Well, call it a panic if you like. Now, suppose we had one every night, and we
stayed here two weeks, there would be fourteen panics before we go home. Wouldn't that be glorious?'

"'You did not appear to enjoy it so much last night.'

"'At the time I did not,' she admitted frankly. 'Weren't we frightened? But then, you know,
how nice it will be to talk of it afterward!'

"We arrived at a restaurant in the Palais Royal, and found a seat by the window, and a breakfast.
We had already finished the latter, and were playing with our fruit, when a party entered who
attracted our attention by speaking English.

"'One of them is Miss Rodgers,' Annie whispered excitedly. 'I know her well: hadn't we better
run away? What will she think of our being here alone?'

"'Nonsense! You had better ask her where she is staying. Remember, we are houseless as yet.'

"'I don't like to ask her.'

"'Introduce me: I will ask.' The idea of spending the night in a garden or on a church-step
did not possess the same charms for me as for Nan. Thus prompted, she walked forward and spoke
to her friend, afterward presenting me. We chatted a few minutes, when Miss Rodgers asked Annie
where she was staying, and how her mamma was.

"'Mamma is not with us,' was Nan's embarrassed reply.

"I went to her rescue, and diverted the questions by asking some myself: 'Miss Rodgers, where
are you staying? We do not like our hotel and want to change.'

"'There is not a room in our house that is unoccupied, and you won't find good accommodation
anywhere. You had better not change if you have a place to lay your head. Paris is so crowded
that everything has been taken up long ago. You can ask at a dozen hotels or boarding-houses
and not find a garret to let. You have no idea of the difficulty.'

"Yes, we had an idea, and believed every word she said: in fact, we would rather have felt
less convinced on the subject. Even Annie seemed to think that traveling alone might present
some disagreeable features, and looked quite unhappy, notwithstanding her love of adventure.
But before our mental anguish had time to become unbearable a young girl, a niece of Miss Rodgers,
spoke: 'Auntie, if the young ladies would like, I know of just the place that would suit them.'
Then turning to us, she continued: 'I am at school a few miles out of the city, and madame
told me that if I knew of any one, she had room for a few parlor-boarders. It is a lovely spot,
and no end of trains coming and going all day; so that it would be just as convenient as living
here, and you would have excellent accommodation. Then, too, I could speak English to you sometimes.
I am so tired of talking for ever without half knowing what I am saying.'

"I could have embraced the chatterbox on the spot for this opportune proposal, but controlled
my feelings and looked at Nan to see if she approved. She was consenting with every one of
her expressive features, and did not appear at all anxious to enjoy one of her fourteen delightful
panics this evening if it could be avoided. Being spokesman, I said, 'I would willingly try
the school on your recommendation, Miss Ada, if you think madame could be ready for us this
evening.'

"'Of course she could: come out with me now and see her. I must go at one, and can show you
the way. Will you meet me at the station? or shall we call for you at your hotel?'

"'We will meet at the station,' I replied, glad to settle it so quickly, 'if you are quite
sure that your madame will like our unceremonious arrival.'

"'That will be all right, I know. She has several empty rooms, and will be happy to have them
filled. You can leave your trunks until to-morrow if you don't like to come bag and baggage.'

"We needed no further pressing. Here was deliverance and safety, and we bade good-morning to
the party with light hearts.

"We found the school all that Miss Ada had promised, and thus ended the nearest approach to
an adventure that we had during the two weeks that we remained."

"And now tell me about the Exposition."

"Well, we saw it."

"Saw what?"

"Why, everything."

"Describe it to me."

"Certainly. In the first place, it was very big, and everybody was there, so it was crowded;
and you met your friends and you talked; and--and you got fearfully tired; and it was wonderful;
and there were ever so many restaurants, and a soda-water fountain, and queer things that you
never expected to see there, like the Mexican techcatl and Russian horses; and everything was
real--real lace and cashmeres and diamonds, and nothing but what was very nice. But, after
all, I think you had better get a file of old newspapers and read about it, for I really have
no talent for description--or, better still, go and see the one in Vienna this summer."

ITA ANIOL PROKOP.

SLAINS CASTLE.

In traveling over the old lands of Europe one is sometimes apt to think more of historical
and genealogical traditions than of the natural beauties or peculiarities of the country. The
old landmarks of a nation, whether monuments built by the hand of man or archives carefully
preserved by him, tell us of its growth, just as the strata of the mountain tell of its progress
to the geologist; and as every successive layer has some relation both to its predecessor and
its successor, so the traditions of each generation have a perceptible influence upon the moral
development of the generation following. Every nation is thus the growing fruit of its own
history, and every visible step of the grand ladder of facts that has led up to the present
result must needs have for a student of human nature an intrinsic interest.

This comes very clearly before my mind as I think of Slains Castle (Aberdeen), a massive crown
of granite set on the brow of the rocks of the German Ocean, and the seat of one of those old
Scottish families whose origin is hidden away among the suggestive mists of tradition.

Slains Castle stands alone, a giant watchman upon giant cliffs, built up only one story high,
on account of the tremendous winds that prevail there in spring and autumn, and cased with
the gray Aberdeen granite of the famous quarries near by. The surrounding country is as bare
and uninviting as one could imagine; the road from Aberdeen (twenty miles) is bleak and stony;
the young trees near the castle are stunted, and in many cases disfigured by the inroads of
hungry cows among their lower branches, and a damp veil of mist hangs perpetually over the
scene, softening the landscape, but sometimes depressing the spirits. As the hours pass the
place grows on you: a weird beauty begins to loom up from among the mist-wreaths, the jagged
rocks, the restless waves, and you forget the desolate moor, which in itself displays attractions
you will realize later, in the grandeur of the desolate sea.

The original building is of the time of James VI. (of Scotland), and is due to Francis, earl
of Erroll, whose more ancient castle, bearing the same name, was destroyed by the king to punish
his vassal for the part he had taken in a rebellion. In the seventeenth century Earl Gilbert
made great improvements in it, and early in the eighteenth Earl Charles added the front. In
1836 it was rebuilt by Earl William George, the father of the present owner, with the exception
of the lower part of the original tower. In this there used to be in olden times an oubliette
in which unhappy prisoners were let down. All at first appeared dark around them, but when
they had thankfully assured themselves that they at last stood upon solid ground, they would
look about them and presently descry a line of fitful light coming from a door ajar in their
dungeon. The poor victims would then go in haste to this door, pull it open and, blinded by
the sudden light, step out upon the green slope terminating quickly in a precipice, which went
sheer down to the sea.

The rest of the house is built around a large covered piazza, intersected by corridors where
pictures, armor and all kinds of old family relics decorate the walls. The drawing-room is
on the very edge of the rock, and on stormy days the flocks of uneasy sea-gulls almost flap
their wings against its window-panes, while the clouds of spray dash up against them in miniature
waterfalls. The rocks in the immediate neighborhood of the castle are rugged in the extreme,
here and there rent by a gigantic fissure reaching far inland, and up which the foaming waters
gurgle continually as if in impatience of their narrow bounds, now jutting far into the sea
like a Titanic staircase and thickly matted with coarse sea-weed, and again reared up on high,
a sheer glistening wall, with not a cranny for the steadiest foot, and with Niagaras of spray
for ever veiling its smooth, unchanging face. In wonderful hollows you will come upon pools
of green water with sea-anemones, delicate sea-weed of pink, yellow or purple hue, and gem-like
shells resting on a bottom of clearest sand; and while the waves are roaring on every side,
and flinging their dampness into your very face, these fairy pools will lie at your feet without
a breath or ripple on their surface.

The most magnificent of these rocks is one called in Gaelic "Dun-Bug" ("Yellow Rock"), the
favorite haunt of the white sea-gulls. It stands alone, as if torn from the land and hurled
into the tossing waves by some giant hand. Two hundred feet in height and a thousand in circumference,
it forms a natural arch, being pierced from its base upward by an opening that widens as it
ascends. The waves dash through it with terrific violence, and the very sight of its grim splendor
conjures up a vision of shipwreck and danger. Scott has made mention of it in The Antiquary,
and Johnson in his Journey to the Hebrides, recalling the grandeur of the rocky coast of Slains,
has said that though he could not wish for a storm, still as storms, whether wished for or
not, will sometimes happen, he would prefer to look at them from Slains Castle. These rocks
and the caves that alternate with them were once famous as a smuggling rendezvous, and as such
Scott has again immortalized them in his Guy Mannering. The Crooked Mary, a noted lugger, had
many an adventure along this coast during the last century. The skipper's arrival was eagerly
looked for at certain stated times, the preconcerted signal was given by him, and the inhabitants
bestirred themselves with commendable haste. All ordinary business was immediately suspended:
men might be seen stealing along from house to house, or a fisher-girl, bareheaded and barefooted,
would hurry to the neighboring village, and deliver a brief message which to a bystander would
sound very like nonsense, but which nevertheless was well understood by the person to whom
it was given. Soon after a plaid or blanket might be seen spread out, as if to dry, upon the
top of a peat-stack. Other beacons, not calculated to draw general notice, but sufficiently
understood by the initiated, soon made their appearance, telegraphing the news from place to
place. As soon as the evening began to close in the Crooked Mary would be observed rapidly
approaching the land, and occasionally giving out signals indicating the creek into which she
meant to run. Both on sea and land hairbreadth escapes were the rule rather than the exception,
and it is related of one of the Crooked Mary's confederates on shore, poor Philip Kennedy,
that one night, while clearing the way for the cargo just landed from the contraband trader's
hold, he was simply murdered by the excise-officers. The heavy cart laden with the cargo was
yet some distance behind, and Kennedy with some dastardly companions was slowly going forward
to ascertain if all was safe, when three officers of the customs suddenly made their unwelcome
appearance. Brave as a lion, Kennedy attacked two of them, and actually succeeded for a time
in keeping them down in his powerful grasp, while he called to his party to secure the third.
They, however, thinking prudence the better part of valor, decamped ignominiously, and the
enemy remained master of the brave man's life. Anderson, the third officer, was observed to
hold up his sword to the moon, as if to ascertain if he were using the edge, and then to bring
it down with accurate aim and tremendous force upon the smuggler's skull. Strange to say, Kennedy,
streaming with blood, actually succeeded in reaching Kirkton of Slains, nearly a quarter of
a mile away, but expired a few moments after his arrival. His last words were: "If all had
been true as I was, the goods would have been safe, and I should not have been bleeding to
death." The brave fellow was buried in the churchyard of Slains, where a plain stone marks
his grave, and bears the simple inscription, "To the memory of Philip Kennedy, in Ward, who
died the 19th of December, 1798. Aged 38."

My own earliest recollections of the grand, desolate old castle are derived, not from my first
visit to it made in infancy, but from the descriptions of one whose home it was during a brief
but intensely observant period of childhood. There came one day a storm such as seldom even
on that coast lashes up the gray, livid ocean. The waves, as far out as sight could reach,
were one mass of foam, and the ghastly lightning flashed upon the torn sails of a ship as near
destruction as it well could be. Cries came up from below in the brief pauses of the storm,
and above lanterns were quickly carried to and fro, while pale attendants hurriedly and silently
obeyed the signals of a more collected master. The occupants of the castle hardly knew to what
its chambers might be destined--whether to receive the dead or to afford rest to the saved.
Beds, fires and cordials were in readiness, and strong men bore dread burdens up dizzy paths
leading from beneath. The ship broke in pieces on the merciless rocks, and many a drowned sailor
went down to meet the army of his fellow-victims of all times who no doubt lay sleeping in
the submarine caves of Slains. Those who survived soon disappeared, full of gratitude for the
timely relief offered them at the castle, but one old man remained. He was never known by any
other name than "Monsieur," and was beloved by every individual member of the household. A
French émigré of the old school, with the dainty, gallant ways of the ancien régime, he still
clung to the dress of his earlier days, and wore a veritable queue, silk stockings and buckled
shoes. For some time he remained a welcome guest in the "red chamber," where the host's little
children would sometimes join him and play with his watch and jeweled baubles. But one day
poor little "Monsieur" sickened, and the tiny feet that had made such haste to run to him,
now trod the corridor softly and bore a baby-nurse to the gentle invalid. It was a high and
coveted reward for the little girls to carry "Monsieur's" medicine to his bedside, and everything
that kindness and hospitality could suggest was equally lavished on him; but his feeble life,
which had no doubt received a shock from the shipwreck it had barely escaped, went out peacefully
like the soft flame of a lamp.

Slains Castle had many gentle and pleasant memories about it, as well as its traditional horrors,
and among these were many connected with the history of the old family that owned it. In one
of the corridors hangs the picture of James, Lord Hay, a fair-haired, sunny-faced boy, tall
and athletic, standing with a cricket-bat in his hand. He would have been earl of Erroll had
he lived, but if we follow him in his short life from classic Eton to the field of Quatre-Bras,
we shall find him again, on a bright June day in 1815, lying as if asleep, as fair and noble-looking
as before, but silent in death. Simple Flemish peasants stand in a group around him, awed and
admiring, asking each other if this beautiful youth is an angel fallen from heaven, or only
a mortal man slain for the Honor of his country. His was a noble death, and worthy of the suggestive
memento of his early boyhood before which we stood just now in the corridor of Slains Castle.

A little farther down this corridor, which to all intents and purposes is a family picture-gallery,
we shall be forced to stop before the portrait of a dark woman, masculine and resolute, not
beautiful nor like the handsome race of the Hays, of which she was yet the last direct representative.
This is the famous Countess Mary, one of the central figures of the family traditions. The
Hays were hereditary lords high constable of Scotland, and also one of the few Scottish families
in which titles and offices, as well as lands, are transmitted through the female line. So
this Countess Mary found herself, at the death of her brother, countess of Erroll in her own
right and lord high constable of Scotland. In one of the two pictures of her at Slains, if
I remember right, she is represented with the bâton of her office, with which badge she also
appeared at court before her marriage (after this it was borne by her husband in the character
of her deputy). Her husband was a commoner, a Mr. Falconer of Dalgaty, whose reported history
in connection with her is curious and deserves to be told, though the old tradition is moulded
into so many different forms that it is very difficult to disentangle the truth from its manifold
embellishments. Toward the beginning of the eighteenth century this intrepid and independent
lady fell in love with Mr. Falconer, who at first did not seem eager to return or notice her
affection. High-strung and chivalric by nature, she did not droop and pine under her disappointment,
but vowed to herself that she would bring him to her feet. Mr. Falconer coner left the country
after some time, and went to London. The Countess Mary also traveled south the same year, and
no news of her was heard at Slains for some time. Meanwhile, she and Mr. Falconer met, but
unknown to the latter, who about the same time became acquainted with a very dashing young
cavalier, evidently a man of high birth and standing, but resolutely bent on mystifying his
friends as to his origin. The two saw each other frequently, and were linked by that desultory
companionship of London life which sometimes indeed ripens into friendship, but as often ends
in a sudden quarrel. Such was the end of this acquaintance, and one day some trifling difference
having occurred between the friends, a cartel reached Mr. Falconer couched in very haughty
though perfectly courteous language. These things were every-day matters in such times, and
very nonchalantly the challenged went in the early morning to the appointed place to meet the
challenger. Here the versions of the story differ. Some say that Mr. Falconer and his antagonist
fought, but without witnesses; that the former got the worst of the encounter, and remained
at the other's mercy; that then, and not before, the Countess Mary made herself known to him
and gave him his choice--a thrust from her sword or a speedy marriage with herself. Others
say that it was before the duel that she astonished her lover by this discovery, and that the
choice she gave him was between marriage and ridicule.[A]

The fact of her marriage, and that it proved a happy one, is certain. Mr. Falconer dropped
his own name to assume that of Hay. The countess was a devoted Jacobite and an earnest churchwoman.
When Presbyterianism had got the upper hand in Scotland, and was repaying church persecutions
with terrible interest, a Mr. Keith was appointed to the Anglican parish of Deer. This was
within the Erroll jurisdiction, and it was not long before the zealous Countess Mary came to
the rescue of the congregation, who had assembled for some time in an old farmhouse. In 1719
or '20 she had the upper floor of a large granary fitted up for their accommodation, and this
afforded them a grateful shelter for more than a quarter of a century. Of this same parish
of Deer a curious story is told in the local annals, showing how conservative and tenacious
of traditions the north of Scotland still was in 1711. The skirmish to which it relates goes
by the quaint title of the "Rabbling of Deer," and is thus reported: "Some people of Aberdeen,
in conjunction with the presbytry of Deer, to the number of seventy horse or thereby, assembled
on the twenty-third of March, 1711, to force in a Presbyterian teacher in opposition to the
parish; but the presbytry and their satellites were soundly beat off by the people, not without
blood on both sides."

There was little of the martyr about the Scot of that warlike day, and most emphatically and
literally did he show himself a "soldier of the Lord."

The aisle of the old church of Slains contains the graves of Countess Mary and her husband,
with an epitaph in Latin, of which the following is a translation: "Beneath this tombstone
there are buried neither gold nor silver, nor treasures of any kind, but the bodies of the
most chaste wedded pair, Mary, countess of Erroll, and Alexander Hay of Dalgaty, who lived
peaceably and lovingly in matrimony for twenty-seven years. They wished to be buried here beside
each other, and pray that this stone may not be moved nor their remains disturbed, but that
these be allowed to rest in the Lord until He shall call them to the happy resurrection of
that life which they expect from the mercy of God and the merits of the Saviour and Lord Jesus
Christ."

The central figure, however, in the history of the Hays of Erroll, and that which no one who
bears the name of Hay can think of without a thrill of pride, is the Lord Kilmarnock who fell,
in 1746, a victim to the last unsuccessful but heroic rising in favor of the Stuarts. I have
heard it whispered as an instance of "second sight" that some years before he had any reason
to anticipate such a death he was once startled by the ghostly opening of a door in the apartment
where he was sitting alone, and by the apparition, horribly distinct and realistic, of a bloody
head rolling slowly toward him across the room; till it rested at his feet. The glassy eyes
were upturned to his, and the bonny locks were clotted with blood: it was as if it had just
rolled from under the axe of the executioner; and the features, plainly discerned, were his own!

His part in the rising of 1745 belongs to history, but his personal demeanor concerns my narrative
more closely. All the contemporary accounts are loud in praise of his beauty and elegance of
person, his refinement of manner, his variety of accomplishments; and Scott, in his Tales of
a Grandfather, relates a curious circumstance concerning his fine presence at the moment of
his execution. A lady of fashion who had never seen him before, and who was herself, I believe,
the wife of one who had much to do with Lord Kilmarnock's death-warrant, seeing him pass on
his way to the block, formed a most violent attachment for his person, "which in a less serious
affair would have, been little less than a ludicrous frenzy."

The grace and dignity of his appearance, together with the resignation and mildness of his
address, melted all the spectators to tears as they gathered round the fatal Tower prison to
witness his death: the chaplain who attended him says his behavior was so humble and resigned
that even the executioner burst into tears, and was obliged to use strong cordials to support
him in his terrible duty. Lord Kilmarnock himself was deeply impressed by the sight of the
block draped in funereal black, the plain coffin placed just beside it, the sawdust that was
so disposed as speedily to suck up the bloody traces of the execution, and the sea of faces
surrounding the open enclosure kept for this his last earthly ordeal. It was certainly not
from fear that he recoiled, but his proud, sensitive, melancholy nature was thrilled through
every nerve by this dread publicity, and we cannot wonder that, leaning heavily on the arm
of a trusty friend, he should have whispered, almost with his last breath, the simple words,
"Home, this is dreadful!"

One who was the lineal descendant of this earl of Kilmarnock, and whose only brother long bore
the same blood-stained and laurel-wreathed title, has often told me of the strange link that
bridged the chasm of four generations from 1746 to 1829, and bound her recollections to those
of a living witness of the scene. She was so young as not to have any distinct impression of
other events that happened at the same time, but this lived in her mind because of the importance
and solemnity with which her own parents had purposely invested it in her eyes. One day, at
Brighton, this little great-great-grand-daughter of the Lord Kilmarnock of 1745 was brought
down from the nursery to see an old, more than octogenarian, soldier who had distinguished
himself in recent wars, and reached the rank of general. This tottering old man, more than
fourscore years of age, took the wee maiden of hardly four upon his knee, and told her in simple
words the story she was never to forget--how he had been a tiny boy running to school on the
day of the execution of the "rebel lords," and how, seeing a vast, eager crowd all setting
toward the Tower quarter, he was tempted to play truant, and flinging his satchel of books
over his shoulder, had pushed his way as far as the great state prison. Then of his frantic
efforts to secure a point of vantage whence to see the great death-pageant--of his childish
admiration for the handsome, manly form of Lord Kilmarnock, of his enthusiasm when Lord Balmerino,
the other victim, had cried in a loud voice, "Long live the king!" and of the fascination he
could not resist which led his eyes from the shining axe and the draped block to the auburn
locks of the prisoner, and soon after to his bleeding head laid low in the sawdust around the
coffin. All this the old veteran told thrillingly, the shadow of a boy's awed recollection
mingling with his Scottish exultation as a compatriot of the victim, and even with a touch
of humor as he recalled the domestic scolding which marked the truant's return.

In the charter-room at Slains Castle, where the records, genealogies, private journals, official
deeds, etc. of the family are kept, one might find ample material for curious investigation
of our forefathers' way of living. Among other papers is a kind of inventory headed, "My Ladies
Petition anent the Plenissing within Logg and Slanis." The list of things wanted for Slains
speaks chiefly of brass pots, pewter pans and oil barrels, but, the "plenissing" of Logg (another
residence of the Errolls), "quhilk my Ladie desyris as eftir followis, quhilk extendis skantlie
(scantily) to the half," contains an ample list of curtains of purple velvet, green serge,
green-and-red drugget and other stuffs hardly translatable to the modern understanding, and
shows that in those days women were not more backward than now in plaguing their liege lords
about upholstery and millinery. But the most amusing and natural touch of all is in the endorsement,
hardly gallant, but very conjugal, made by the fair petitioner's husband: "To my Ladyes gredie
(greedy) and vnressonable (unreasonable) desyris it is answerit...." Here follows a distinct
admission that the furniture of both houses, put together, is too little to furnish the half
of each of them, and therefore nothing can be spared from Logie to "pleniss" Slains.

The family coat-of-arms commemorates to this day the poetical genealogy of the Hays. Its supporters
are two tall, naked peasants bearing plough-yokes on their shoulders: the crest is a falcon,
while the motto is also significant--"Serva jugum." Scottish tradition tells us that in 980,
when the Danes had shamefully routed the Scots at Loncarty, a little village near Perth, and
were pursuing the fugitives, an old man and his two stalwart sons, who were ploughing in a
field close by, were seized with indignation, and, shouldering their plough-yokes, placed themselves
resolutely in a narrow defile through which their countrymen must pass to evade a second slaughter
by the victors. As the Scots came on the three patriots opposed their passage, crying shame
upon them for cowards and no men, and exhorting them thus: "Why! would ye rather be certainly
killed by the heathen Danes than die in arms for your own land?" Ashamed, and yet encouraged,
the fugitives rallied, and with the three dauntless peasants at their head fell upon their
astonished pursuers, and fought with such desperation that they turned defeat into victory.
Kenneth III., the Scottish king, instantly sent for the saviors of his army, gave them a large
share of the enemy's spoils, and made them march in triumph into Perth with their bloody plough-yokes
on their shoulders. More than that, he ennobled them, and gave them a fair tract of land, to
be measured, according to the fashion of that day, by the flight of a falcon. From the name
of this land the Hays came to be called; lords of Erroll, and it is said that the Hawk Stone
at St. Madoes, Perthshire, which stands upon what is known to have been the ancient boundary
of the possessions of the Hays, is the identical stone from which the lucky falcon started.
It was left standing as a special memorial of the defeat of the Danes at Loncarty. Another
stone famous in the Hay annals, and conspicuously placed in front of the entrance to Slains
Castle, is said to be the same on which the peasant general rested after his toilsome leadership
in the battle.

Our walks over the bleak moors on one side, with the heather in bloom and the blackberries
in low--lying purple clusters fringing the granite rocks, were sometimes rendered more interesting,
though more dangerous, by the sudden falling of a thick white mist. Slowly it would come at
first, gathering little filmy clouds together as it were, and hovering over the gray sea in
curling tufts, and then, growing strong and dense, would swoop down irresistibly, till what
was clear five minutes before was impenetrably walled off, and one seemed to stand alone in
a silent world of ghosts. Or again, our walks would take us on the other side, over the Sands
of Forvie, a desolate tract where nothing grows save the coarse grass called bent by the Scotch,
and where the wearied eye rests on nothing but mounds of shifting sand, drearily shaped into
the semblance of graves by the keen winds that blow from over the German Ocean.

This miniature desert, tradition says, was an Eden four hundred years ago, but a wicked guardian
robbed the helpless orphan heiresses of it by fraud and violence, and the maidens threw a spell
or weird upon it in these terms:

  "Yf evyr maydens malysone
    Did licht upon drye lande,
  Let nocht bee funde in Furvye's glebys
    Bot thystl, bente and sande."

I must not forget the "Bullers," a natural curiosity which is the boast of the neighborhood
of Slains, and is moreover connected with a feat performed by a former guest and friend of
one of the lords of Erroll. We drove there in a large party, and passed through an untidy,
picturesque little fishing-hamlet on our way, where the women talked to each other in Gaelic
as they stood barefooted at the doors of their cabins, and where the children looked so hardy,
fearless and determined that the wildest dreams of future possible achievement seemed hardly
unlikely of realization in connection with any one of them.

"The Pot," as it is locally called, is a huge rocky cavern, irregularly circular and open to
the sky, into which the sea rushes through a natural archway. A narrow pathway is left quite
round the basin, from which one looks down a sheer descent of more than a hundred feet; but
this is so dangerous, the earth and coarse grass that carpet it so deceptive and loose, and
the wind almost always so high on this spot, that only the most foolhardy or youngest of visitors
would dare in broad daylight to attempt to walk round it. Yet it is on record that the duke
of Richmond, some sixty or seventy years ago, made a bet at Lord Erroll's dinner-table that
he would ride round it after dark. He accomplished the feat in safety. His picture, life-size,
hangs in the dining-room to this day, and as he is represented standing in all the pride of
a vigorous manhood by the side of his beautiful charger, he does not seem to belie the reputation
which this incident created for him in the old district of Buchan.

The peasants of this wild and primitive neighborhood, though to some extent slightly infected
by modernization, are yet very fair specimens of the hardy, trusty clansmen of Scottish history,
and the present owners of Slains certainly give them every reason to keep up the old bonds
of affectionate interest with every one and everything belonging to "the family." To my own
observation of the ancient seat of the Hays I owe one of the most delightful recollections
of my life, that of a Christian home. Not only the outward observances, but the inner spiritual
vitality of religion, were there, while unselfish devotion to all within the range of her influence
or authority marked the character of her who was at the head of this little family kingdom.
The present head of the house, a Hay to the backbone, has triumphantly carried on the martial
traditions of his ancestry, and on the roll of England's victorious sons at the battle of the
Alma his name is to be found. He was there disabled by a wound that shattered his right arm
and cut short his military career. Domestic happiness, however, is no bad substitute for a
brilliant public life, and there are duties, higher yet than a soldier's, that go far toward
making up that background of rural prosperity which alone ensures the grand effect of military
successes. After having done one's duty in the field, it is to the full as noble, and perhaps
more patriotic, to turn to the duties of the glebe, thereby finishing as a landlord the work
begun as a soldier.

It is a touching custom, hardly yet obliterated in the district over which my reminiscences
have led me, for one peasant, when coming upon another employed in his lawful calling, thus
to salute him: "Guid speed the wark!" the rejoinder being, in the same broad Buchan dialect,
"Thank ye: I wish ye weel."

I can end these pages with no more fitting sentiment. As a tribute of grateful recollection
to those who made my days at Slains a happiness to me, and in the first fresh sorrow of a deep
bereavement offered me distractions the more alluring because the more associated with Nature's
changeless, silent grandeur, I pen these lines, crowning them with the homely Scottish wish
that wherever they are and whatever they do, "Guid speed the wark!"

LADY BLANCHE MURPHY.

[Footnote A: There is another version of her courtship, and this a metrical one. This old ballad
was not much known beyond the district round Slains, and the old servants and farmers on the
estate were the chief depositaries of the tradition. I have failed to secure more than a very
small fragment of it, which is itself only written down from memory by one of these old women.
The rhyme and rhythm are both original:

  Lady Mary Hay went to a wedding
  Near the famous town of Reading:
  There a gentleman she saw
  That belonged to the law....

Here evidently there occurs a hiatus, during which some account is probably begun of her unreturned
attachment, for a little later we find in the very primitive manuscript from which we quote
these words of the countess:

  I that have so many slighted,
  I am at last--(unrequited?)

The story is now carried on in prose (my informant having forgotten the text of the ballad),
and says that "Lady Mary wanted or challenged him to meet her in a masquerade" (probably meaning
a duel in disguise), "and that his father told him to go." Neither father nor son seems to
have known the fair challenger's rank, though the following words point to their being aware
of her sex, for the elder Falconer is represented as saying,

  If she is rich she will raise your fame,
  And if poor you are the same.

OUR HOME IN THE TYROL

CHAPTER III.

We were soon comfortably settled in the old Hof. The spacious rooms, always deliciously cool,
were fragrant with rare and delicate blossoms--Alpine roses from the rocks, white lilies from
Moidel's special little garden-plot, grasses and nodding flowers, campanulas, veronicas, melisot,
potentillas and lady's bedstraw, which, according to Anton, no cattle would touch, whilst the
roots of others were good for man or beast, their various qualities being all known to him.
But soon the waving flowers bent beneath the scythe. It was the eve of St. Peter and St. Paul's
Day, a festival when all work must cease, and the Hofbauer, whose word was law, had given orders
that the hay in the wood-meadow must be carried that evening. Seeing, therefore, that the more
hands there were the better, the two Margarets seized each a rake and worked as hard as any
woman in the field.

On we labored, the golden evening sun glinting down upon our picturesque row of haymakers,
nor did we cease until the angelus sounded from the village spire. Then Anton, Jakob, Moidel,
their men and maids, fell devoutly upon their knees and thanked God that Christ Jesus had been
born. These humble Tyrolese remember thrice daily to praise the Lord, as David did. With a
hushed, subdued look upon their honest faces, they arose, and we joining them the fresh, fragrant
hay was carted triumphantly home. The hay is cut long before we should consider it ready, and
is housed whilst still green and moist. The newer the hay the richer the cream, they say. The
Hofbauer has three crops yearly, but his neighbors, who lie higher, have only two, and sometimes
but one.

The good old Kathi stood at the door cooling a gigantic pan of buckwheat polenta, and when
she had set down this dish, intended for the haymakers' supper, she brought us each, as our
pay, a couple of krapfen, which are oblong dough-cakes fried in butter.

Although the haymakers were worn out and weary with a long day's work of twelve hours, still
Rosenkranz sounded in the chapel like the humming of bees in lime trees. This pious custom
duly impressed us, until on the very next day, as we walked up our village street on the evening
of the festival, our solemn feelings received a great check. We observed that the prayer-leaders,
who knelt at the open windows of each separate house, followed our every movement with their
eyes, whilst their mouths mechanically repeated sonorous Ave Marias and Paternosters. Nay,
there was our own pious Moidel watching us from the kitchen window, her Hail Marys mingling
with her friendly greetings; but then Moidel was waiting upon us and our supper whilst her
family were on their knees in the chapel. Still, we soon learnt to perceive that Rosenkranz
was considered quite as efficacious if merely uttered by the tongue, whilst the mind was far
away. This being a festival, and no one tired with work, the household trooped into the old
pleasaunce after supper. The elders sat together in a row, whilst the younger members congregated
on a second long stone bench and struck up singing, Moidel and her elder brother beginning
with a duet:

  Green, green is the clover
    On the hills as I go,
  And my maiden as fresh is
    As spring water's flow.

And the chorus joined in--

    As spring water's flow,

winding up with a jodel.

Nanni, the chief maid, next sang in a clear, flexible voice, which trembled no little when
she perceived that the Herrschaft now formed part of the audience in the balcony--

A WEEK'S SORROW.

  On Sunday I cried, for my heart was so sore,
  Like a poor little child outside the church door;
  On Monday I felt so afeard and alone,
  And thought, Were I a swallow, I'd quickly begone:
  Woe's me! were I but a swallow, were I but a swallow!

  On Tuesday, and nothing could please me all day,
  For him that I love best is far, far away;
  On Wednesday whatever I did, I did ill,
  For when the heart's heavy the hand has no skill;
  On Thursday I was weary and sleepy all day;
  On Friday, and one of the cows went astray;
  On Saturday down poured my tears like the rain,
  As though I should never be happy again.
  Woe's me! never be happy again; woe's me! never again.

In order to catch the meaning of the words, which were sung in strong dialect, Margaret and
I had descended to the garden. The Hofbauer looked sad when he saw us approach, and quietly
brushed a tear away with his shirt-sleeve. We consequently asked Moidel when we stood alone
with her whether anything were troubling her father.

"It strikes me not," she said. "I fancy that it is but the music. Father and uncle may both
seem quiet and dull now, yet they have been celebrated singers; only when my mother died father
left off singing, and so did uncle after Uncle Jakob's death."

"Ah yes!" said the aunt, who had also joined us, "they were the three handsomest, best--grown
men in the parish, living happily together without an ill word, until four years ago Jakob
was trampled upon by a yoke of vicious oxen, and in three days he was dead. Yes, that was a
sorrow almost as cutting as the death of the Hofbauerin, so young when she died. Only married
five years, and leaving four little children, not one of whom ever knew her! Yes, Moidel is
a good girl, and is wearing her linen now, but she can never come up in looks to her mother.
Ah ja! and now the trouble is about Jakob."

"About Jakob?" asked we in a low, astonished voice.

"Why yes, that he has been drawn for the Landwehr. Ah, I thought you knew. It was last autumn
that he was drawn. The Hofbauer would have sold his best acres to release him, but the recruiting-officer
would have no nay: Jakobi was a fine, well-behaved young fellow, and such were needed in the
army. He had to serve two months this spring, and with his comrades day by day had to run up
the face of mountains some four thousand feet. It quite wore Jakob out, though he is so good-tempered.
He declared that he was used, to be sure, at the Olm to climb up to the glaciers of the Hoch
Gall after his goats, often bringing the kids in his arms down the precipices, but to have
his back broken and his feet blistered in order to know how to shed human blood was what he
hated. Yet he bore it so well, doing his best, that when the other recruits could return to
their homes, Jakob, being so clever and well-behaved, had to stay a fortnight longer to brush,
fold up and put away all the regimentals. However, the under-officer did have him to dine with
him every day."

"Yes, and Jakob will in his turn be an officer," we replied, trying to reassure her.

"Oh, na, na, that can never be: eleven more long years must he serve, and always as a private.
I thought like you, until the Hofbauer explained to me that all the officers were foreigners--Saxons,
Bavarians, Würtembergers, put in by the Austrian ministry, who are tyrants to Tyrol. Ah, if
the good emperor would only interfere, for he loves Tyrol! but he leaves everything to the
ministry. Austria may itself be overthrown in these unrighteous days before my Jakobi is free."
Now it was the good soul's turn to wipe her eye with the corner of her ample blue apron.

We were venturing some fresh attempt at consolation when fortunately an event occurred which
drew her thoughts from the deep shadow which we had just discovered hung over the peaceful
Hof. Jodokus, the village schoolmaster in the winter, when the children had time to learn,
but during the busy summer months one of the men, had challenged Jakobi to a wrestling-match.
Hardly had the two antagonists encountered each other on the grass in a stout set-to, when
the sound of the goatherd's whip was heard on the hilly common above, sending forth a succession
of reports like those of a pistol, becoming stronger and louder when the game and the assembled
company were seen. At last the young "whipper-snapper," as we called him, made one long final
succession of cracks and reports, and springing over the wall, and casting his instrument of
torture on one side, he boldly challenged Anton.

The young man, whose skill and strength were well known, smiled, half amused, half incredulous,
on his antagonist. The younger athlete, a lad of thirteen, firmly built and agile, mistook
the look for a sneer, and the blood ran fast and hot into his face. So, Anton accepting the
challenge, they immediately began to spar. They first fearlessly regarded each other, then
bowing their heads they rushed forward, butting like rams. The lad, with his head fixed firm
in Anton's chest, tried to find his adversary's weakest point, and with his arms round his
waist endeavored cunningly to make him slip; but it was soon the young champion who was tripped
up, and who in playful, half-serious anger dealt blows and tugs right and left, almost managing
to bring Anton sprawling to the ground. The lad, however, suddenly stopped: he had lost a little
tin ring off his finger and a four-kreuzer piece from his pocket--too great a loss for a shepherd-boy.
The combat therefore was speedily closed, both antagonists and their partisans hunting in the
unmowed grass until the treasures were again trove.

At the same time an elderly man approached and opened the gate--a peasant evidently, although,
instead of the usual long white apron and bib, he wore one of new green linen, shining as satin--a
man of a strong although delicate make, the head slightly stooping forward, and a face that
beamed with genuine pleasure as half a dozen voices simultaneously burst forth with a "God
greet you, Alois!"

This then was Schuster (or Shoe-maker) Alois, in preparation of whose advent the good aunt
had scrubbed a bed-room, and Moidel had beautified the window with pots of blooming geraniums.
The room was a large chamber, set apart for the different ambulatory work-people who came to
the Hof in the course of the year. The weaver, who arrived in the spring to weave the flax
which the busy womankind had spun through the winter, had been the last occupant of the room,
and had woven no less than two hundred and ninety-three ells of linen, which now in long symmetrical
lines were carefully pegged down on the turf of the pleasaunce by Moidel, who walked over them
daily with her bare feet, busily watering until the gray threads were turning snowy white.

Later on in the year the sewing-woman would appear, and then the tailor, to make the clothing
for this large household, the servants, according to an old custom long since extinct in most
countries, being chiefly paid in kind. Schuster Alois had now come to make the boots for Jakob
and the Senner Franz preparatory to their going with the cattle to the Alpine pastures.

I greatly doubt whether the tailor or the weaver was so well waited upon as the shoemaker:
I fancy they were left more to the maids. Passing the open door of the family house-place,
aunt and niece might now be seen sitting hour after hour, the elder lining the soles of Jakob's
stockings with pieces of strong woolen to prevent mending on the Alp, or attending to other
needs of his homely toilet; the younger at her paste-board or kneading-trough, whilst Schuster
Alois sat between them in the sunny oriel window, and while he steadily plied his awl appeared
to be either telling them tales or reciting poetry.

The Alp, or Olm (to use the provincial word), lay at the distance of about six hours, and the
Hofbauer went up to examine the state of the pasturage before his son and the cattle finally
started. In two days he returned. "The going up of the cattle must be postponed at least a
week," he said, "for snow had fallen at the huts the depth of a man; and the river had swollen
to such a height that it had carried two houses away in St. Wolfgang, the highest mountain-village;
and even life had been lost."

This delay caused a respite from hard work. The next morning Alois's arms did not move like
unwearying machinery, and, the ten o'clock-dinner being over, we saw him seated at his ease
on the adjoining hillside. Should we go and speak to him? He appeared different from the ordinary
run of his class (though cobblers are often clever men enough), and moreover of a decidedly
friendly turn of mind. We determined that we would. We joined Alois on the stony, waste hillside,
crowned by two trees with a crucifix in the centre, which formed from the house, with its background
of mountains, ever a melancholy, soul-touching little poem.

"You have not quite such hard work to-day, Schuster?"

He smiled and said, "Do your work betimes, and then rest; and where better than under the shadow
of the cross?"

"Yes, and the crucifix which you have chosen is more pleasing than the generality which are
sown broadcast over the fields of the Tyrol. Why are they made so hideous and revolting?"

We spoke out freely, because the unusually intelligent face before us evidently belonged to
a thinker. Candor of speech pleased him. Nevertheless, he answered as if musing, "They appear
ugly to you: well they may be. Ja, but the most who look upon them are men and women acquainted
with many sorrows--sudden deaths by falls from precipices, destruction of house and home by
lightning, floods, avalanches, failure of crops, and many another visitation--and it soothes
their perhaps selfish natures to see these anguished features, these blood-stained limbs--signs
of still greater suffering--whilst they pray that only such crosses may be laid on them as
will keep them in obedience to His will. Just before you came up the hill I was thinking of
a strange history connected with a crucifix--one that I read only ten days ago in the house
of a Hochmair himself."

It merely needed silence for Schuster Alois to repeat the tale, and he soon began: "It is the
Tyroler Adolph Pichler who narrates it. He says that once in his rambles he came to a little
chapel, over which hung a blasted larch--such a desolate wreck of a tree that he naturally
asked the guide he had with him why it was not cut down. Now, the guide was an old man who
knew every, tradition and legend, besides all the family histories in that part of the Tyrol.
'That tree,' said he, 'is left there purposely, as the reminder of a great crime, and nobody
would think of touching it. If you look into the chapel, you'll see a Christ on the cross which
has been shot through the breast. That was once a crucifix under this very tree.' Then the
guide made a remark which had often struck myself--that there are some families in which everything
that is strange and dreadful happens, whilst there are others that go on for generations and
are no more distinguishable than the very weeds themselves. In that valley were the Hochmairs,
and they were of this prominent sort, and odd enough, as I said before, it was at a Hochmair's
house that I read this account. Well, some generations back there was a Hochmair who was a
regular ruffian. He cared no more for the life of a man than that of a chamois. The government
kept the game strictly on the mountains, and he was suspected of having put more than one of
their keepers out of the way. In short, he had such a bad character that when he went to confession
the priest would not give him absolution. This put him in a great rage, and it is remarkable
that from that day his luck in hunting forsook him. He could not take aim--a sort of mist was
ever before his eyes, his hand trembled. People believed that he was perpetually haunted by
the ghost of a young man whom, after he had shot, he had beaten to death with his gunstock,
and then flung down a crevasse. Be that as it may, he would be absent for weeks in the mountains.
He did no good, and the little he possessed fell into ruin.

"His creditors were about to sell him up, stick and stone, when he put, as one may say, the
finishing stroke to everything himself. It was Corpus Christi Day: the bells were ringing and
the procession moving through the fields, the holy banners waving, the choir-boys singing the
sanctus, when just as the priest lifted the Host in the golden monstrance, a shot was fired
from the bushes in front of a crucifix. Lightning flashed from heaven, and the house of the
wicked Hochmair, which was at no great distance, burst into flames. An awful cry rang from
the bushes: the procession rushed forward, the priest only remaining with the Host and a few
attendants. And what did they see? There was the image of the crucified Saviour pierced by
a bullet, and out in the road stood the wretched Hochmair, with his hands clasped on the lock
of his gun and his eyes rolling in frenzy. Everybody perceived the crime he had committed,
and remained motionless, whilst he beckoned wildly to the priest, who came up in gloomy silence.
After they had talked together alone for some time, the priest went into the church, where
he remained all night in prayer. The wretched man, whom nobody dared to touch, disappeared
into the thicket, and all trace was lost of him. In the mean while the injured image of the
Saviour was removed into the church. So years went on, and then one Sunday after service the
priest announced from the pulpit that the former sinner Hochmair was dead, but that after years
of penitence he had received the forgiveness of the Church and of God. 'Therefore,' said the
good man, 'let all forgive him, and remember only their own sins, and pray Christ to be merciful
to them.' After that it was known that he had become possessed with the crazy notion that if
he fired into the breast of the Saviour on Corpus Christi Day, just when the Host was being
elevated and the benediction spoken, it would make his gun unerring. He fired therefore, and
at the same moment the Saviour on the cross raised His head and, fixing on him His eyes full
of tears, gave him a look which pierced him to the very marrow, and that terrified him far
more than the lightning which, flashing from his forehead, set fire to his house, whilst the
thorn-crowned countenance seemed to float before him, and he knew that this was his punishment.
Such was his confession at the time to the priest who laid the penance of the Church upon him.
So he went out into the world like another Cain, and God in His own time was merciful to him.
Still, the wounded effigy of the Saviour and the blasted larch tree remain as witnesses on
earth against him.

"And," continued Schuster Alois, "that is only one tale amongst the hundreds which could be
related concerning these crucifixes. Ah, there is many an old, bleached, weather-beaten crucifix
on crag or highway-side from which the anguished face of the Saviour has both smitten and healed
the sinner. Crucifixes cut deeper into most Tyrolese hearts than shrines, some way."

"Strange," we replied, "for these old shrines are not only quaint, but often beautiful, as,
for instance, the one on the roadside turning into town."

"Ah, I am glad you like it," said Alois, "for there are those who would wish it pulled down
and a lofty wooden cross, as a landmark, placed there instead. The Capuchins in the adjoining
monastery are opposed to it, however, and no wonder. Have you ever remarked," he continued,
becoming quite aglow, "that although it is greatly injured and many of the figures lost, still
there are others who look at you so calmly and seriously with their marred, dilapidated countenances
that you feel a peace steal into your heart? And whoever the painter was, he must have loved
his work, for Saint Gregory could never have been more dignified in real life than he looks
in the shrine."

"Are you a painter?" we asked, almost without knowing what we were saying, for it was hardly
probable.

"Oh, I only touch colors now and then, when there's a purpose in it or I can serve the Church,"
he returned. He became embarrassed, and explained that it was time to return to his work.

We afterward learnt from Moidel that Alois bore in the neighborhood far and wide the reputation
of an artist, although he did not consider himself such, seeing he could not paint saints and
angels. It was, however, a great source of pleasure to him to paint mottoes and devices and
to arrange floral decorations, especially when they could serve as a surprise for some private
name-day or church festival.

One afternoon we were told that the boots were made, that Anton had brought the flour from
the mill, that two hundred loaves of rye bread were baked, and, the weather being sufficiently
fine and all the preparations being completed, the cattle would now start for the Olm. First,
Anton and the Senner Franz set off at four o'clock in the afternoon, with the calves in advance,
the young things being unable to keep up with the cattle. Then a leiterwagen which had been
drawn into the lower corridor and filled with sacks of flour, meal, salt and the two hundred
loaves, was driven by the Hofbauer as far as Taufers, whence the supplies for the Alpine residents
would be borne on men's backs up to the huts.

In the evening Jakob came into the grand old sitting-room to bid us good-bye. He appeared in
his shirt-sleeves and the indispensable white apron, and with the utmost self-possession and
refinement of manner he presented us with a little bouquet of edelweiss, promising to send
us down a larger supply by his brother. We talked with him about the Olm, and found him enthusiastic
on the subject, his one regret being that, as he must return for several weeks of drilling
on August 22d, his stay there this summer would be greatly curtailed. The Olm was very extensive,
lying on a mountain-platform which was only bare of snow for about three months in the year.
When, however, the snow was off, the flowers came up by thousands, the grass sprang up by magic,
all the mountains were filled with the rushing and roaring sound of waters, which came down
in foaming cascades, often of wonderful beauty, amongst the rocks and the pine woods which
clothed the steeper mountain-sides. Nor was the life at all solitary, for various farmers were
sending up their cattle to other Olms about the same time, so that no one was without neighbors,
although they might be at a considerable distance apart.

Jakob spoke on until we became wild to go up to the Olm too. "Could we go thither," we asked,
"and pay him a visit?"

"That we could," he replied, "if we did not mind sleeping in the hay. Only we had better wait
for settled weather in August."

There was now no talk of our leaving the Hof at St. Jakobi. The Hofbauer had declared that
the house was at our disposal until Martinmas--longer if we wanted it. He also fell into the
scheme of our visiting his Olm, where he intimated his desire to be host, saying that all the
dairy produce would be at our service.

In the night, exactly at one o'clock, Jakob and Jodokus started: we heard them go, the cattle-bells
ringing and the "Leben Sie wohl!" "Behüt Euch Gott!" shouted lovingly after them from the open
door and the lower windows of the silent old mansion. Six and twenty head of cattle: the goats,
pigs and sheep were to follow later. It was a calm and beautiful night, the three-quarters
moon just dropping behind the mountains, and the stars shining out brightly from the dark cloudless
sky.

CHAPTER IV.

The Alpine caravansary was hardly settled at the Olm when the air became intensely hot and
oppressive. Day by day black thunder-clouds gathered on the horizon. They crested the mountains
in three directions, at times appearing to repel each other, at others marching fiercely on
to conflict, when, the zenith becoming pitch-dark, they flung out long spears of lightning
and exploded in overwhelming thunder. Very terrible were these perpetual storms. With the first
peal the church-bells along the valley began solemnly to toll. It mattered not whether by night
or day, the faithful bellringer was at his post, and with rain pouring down outside and fiery,
vivid lightning playing around him, he still went tolling on, for evil spirits must be driven
away, and people reminded to make the sign of the cross and pray God to protect them.

At length, to use an expression of Alois's, "Saint Florian had left off playing at skittles,
and Saint Leonhard had driven his hay over the heavenly bridge." The warring elements were
still, but the earth seemed smouldering with heat, and we panted and gasped after the lofty
mountain-slopes which lay on all sides. At the same time it came most opportunely to our knowledge
that the Tyrol was rich in baths--primitive establishments most of them, but dotted over mountain
and valley, so that each village had half a dozen to choose from, where every peasant, be he
ever so poor, could at least dip and soak for an eight-days' sommerfrisch. Why, then, should
not the two Margarets, they being the most desirous of a change, have at least a sommerfrisch?

But which amongst all these baths was the one to choose? Good Kathi recommended her baths at
Innichen. She herself evidently did not derive much pleasure from her yearly visits there.
Still, we, being ladies, would find more people to talk to, and the bath-house, which was always
full to overflowing, stood in a wood, and we liked trees. Schuster Alois--for the conversation
took place before he left--said that most gentlefolks went to Maistall. There was not only
luxus, but a great deal of life and spirit there. His Majesty Emperor Max as early as 1511
took up his quarters at Maistall during his campaign against the Venetians, and he had heard
say that in the last century the visitors formed a society and made it a rule that none but
the purest German should be spoken. Every fault of pronunciation cost a kreuzer to the offender:
the money went to the chapel, and amounted one season to twenty-one florins six kreuzers.

But one Margaret decidedly objected to going to a place where there was the faintest chance
of her loiter wagon for leiterwagen, her pison for speisen, her vulgarborn for wohlgeboren,
being fined by a gazel-schaft (gesellschaft). Besides, these places sounded too grand: we did
not want a Gastein, but a Wildbad, if one could be found that did not belie its name. So the
peasant-baths of St. Vigil, Mühlbach and Scharst were named to us, and the lot fell upon Scharst,
we having heard that all the school-children in town had just been taken there for a long day's
holiday, and had returned to their proud and happy parents, who waited for them in double ranks
below, radiant with pleasure, waving their banners and Alpine roses.

It was accordingly arranged that on the following Sunday Anton should drive us to Reischach,
where there was to be a great festival, with candles in the church as big as a man's arm: so
said a woman from Reischach. Anton was of a retiring nature, and did not like crowds, but he
would gladly drive the ladies over. And at Reischach we should be sure to find some peasant
returning that evening by Scharst, who could carry our belongings.

Imagine us, therefore, at Reischach, the church-bell ringing for vespers, which begin at one
o'clock. We wear bouquets of carnations and rosemary, presented to us by the family at the
Hof, as correct decorations for a festival. And Anton!--how to present him to you as he deserves
to be presented? His truthful, guileless face is his best ornament: nevertheless, he too wears
carnations and rosemary caught in the silver cord and vieing with the silver tassels of his
broad-brimmed, low-crowned beaver hat. His rough jacket, made by the tailor last autumn, and
therefore too new to be worn on a less special occasion, is short and loose enough to leave
ample space for the display of his rauge, or broad leather belt of softest chamois-skin, worked
in scrolls surrounding his name, with split peacock quills, no little resembling Indian handicraft.
His snow-white knees appear between his short leather breeches and his bright blue knitted
stockings. These Nature's garters, when perfectly white, are regarded as a mark of great distinction
amongst the dandies, and those of our Anton may be considered the very knee plus ultra.

A parliament of men--a few still in breeches with Hessian boots, which appeared a characteristic
of Reischach, but the majority, having succumbed to modern ideas, wearing trowsers--were seated
in the shadow of a comfortable house, discussing the different stages of their rye and flax
crops. Their wives and daughters, following their natural impulse, were already kneeling in
church, confiding their cares of kitchen and farmyard to the ever-ready ear of Mutter Gottes--one
dense mass of simple, believing women, in broad-brimmed beaver hats, with here and there a
conical woolen beehive as a contrast.

The church in itself, although it lacked the candles as big as a man's arm, must truly have
shone like the gate of heaven to peasant eyes. Many of the more substantial families had lent
their private saints for the occasion. They had brought Holy Nothburgs and Saint Leonhards
and Virgins, generally preserved in wardrobes at home, but now brought to participate in the
festival, besides adding to its great solemnity. It was Scapulary Sunday, we were told, and
although the words conveyed no clear idea to us, we were soon to learn their significance.
A Tyrolese anthem having been sung by some invisible voices, in which jodels leapt up and smothered
Gregorians, a middle-aged Capuchin took his stand in the pulpit, and having greeted the congregation,
promised to explain to them the mystery and the advantage of the Holy Scapulary.

"My beloved," he began, "there are some who think too little of the scapulary, and there are
others who lay too great a stress on this aid to faith. Let us meditate on both these conditions.
But first, how must we ourselves regard the scapulary? Now, we are told not to love the world
nor the things of the world. The scapulary, with its sacred image of Mary worn next the heart,
is a great shield against this love of the world. It places you under the especial protection
of the Queen of Heaven: you are as much her servant as those who serve king or kaiser, and
equally wear her livery. Some think too little of the scapulary. Yet what incidents can be
told of its efficacy! Let one suffice. In the year 1866, when the war raged between Austria
and Prussia, the Catholic soldiers of the latter country immediately before the war entered
by hundreds into the Society of the Scapulary. Wearing this sacred charm upon their hearts,
they went into the battle-field, and the cannons roared and the bullets whizzed thick and fast
around them, and not one of them fell, for they wore the scapulary. Indeed, their miraculous
preservation created so much excitement that Lutherans marveled over it, and asked the Catholics
how it came that they were no whit hurt. And they answered, 'We wear the scapulary of Mary,
and she saves us.' Then many Lutherans said, 'Come, we will have scapularies,' and wrote their
names down in the society. And now hark ye, my brethren. There was a Catholic soldier, and
there was a Lutheran, and the latter said, 'Lend me thy scapulary for this one day only, and
see, here is a thaler for thee.' Then the foolish Catholic drew the scapulary off his neck,
handed it to the Lutheran, took the thaler, went into battle: whiz went the bullets round him,
and he fell."

We could stand no more. The church, now crowded with men as well as women, reeked with perspiration,
the sermon oppressed us, and thus our sense and senses drove us out into the open air. Here
the fresh breeze came across from the Ziller snow-fields, health-giving as a breath from heaven.
Peasant-women who were too late to squeeze into church were seated amongst the iron crosses
of the graves. The more serious-minded had managed to cluster together round a side-door which,
being adjacent to the pulpit, proved an advantageous spot for hearing. The less particular
sat in the shade, feeling it sufficient to be in holy ground and to pass their beads through
their fingers whilst they studied up our novel attire. Approaching the more attentive members,
we found that the Capuchin had reached the second part of his discourse, and was dilating on
those who thought too highly of the scapulary. We gathered the following fragment:

"Now, the man was nigh unto death, and it was neither for confession nor for the death-sacrament
that he craved. No, it was for a scapulary. 'A scapulary!' he cried, 'a scapulary!' My brethren,
you know well he should have asked for the priest and for the blessing of the Church, but it
was merely for a scapulary."

Later on we asked permission to see a scapulary. It consisted of two small squares of cloth,
herring-boned round the edge, and united by a narrow ribbon of sufficient length to permit
one square to rest on the breast, whilst the other hung between the shoulders. That in front
bore the image of the Virgin, designed by the nuns in the convent, whilst the simpler work
had been given to some poor old woman, or even man, who was past harder employment. The privilege
of wearing this charmed badge entailed the payment of a small yearly subscription and the repetition
of seven Paternosters daily.

The procession followed the sermon. Mary, Joseph, Saint Nothburg (once a good peasant-girl,
now a saint) were paraded round the village by children, and borne back to church. Peasant-men
staggered under large silk banners, which swayed and fluttered in the blustery wind, and, but
for the steady grasp of the strong men who carried them, threatening at each moment to crush
the pious throng. The four chief peasants of the district, wearing their robes of state, the
Noah's ark coats in which they were married, bore the baldachin over the head of the Capuchin
who elevated the Host: the village priest, in white surplice and Hessian boots, swung the censer
at his side. The men were in front, the women, a long, broad file, divided in the procession
by the priests from their male relations, followed--a dense black mass, but relieved in color
by the whiteness of their short linen sleeves.

Men and women, carefully severed in their prayers and on the very steps of the altar by Holy
Church, were soon able to come together again under the spacious, hospitable roof of Herr Kappler,
the wirth. Innumerable clean wooden tables, forms, and stiff, high-legged wooden chairs were
ranged up stairs and down stairs and in the orchard without, for the accommodation of the scapularists
and their friends.

We sat at a side-table in an upper room partaking of grilled fowl and salad, whilst buben and
their dirnen, or lads and their lasses, middle-aged couples, old men and women, poured into
the house, filling every chair, bench and table. They came thither from all the country-side,
and endless were the greetings amongst cousins and cousins' cousins. The Tyrolese, like the
Scotch, keep up every link of relationship, claiming the fiftieth cousin. Relationship, in
fact, never does die out; and though it may become an abstract during busy seasons of ploughing
and sowing, it becomes a strong reality at wakes and festivals. Thus, at Kappler's, on this
scapulary afternoon, Barthel's brother-in-law's cousin drank with "Cousin Barthel," and Seppl's
sister-in-law's niece was treated by "Onkel Seppl." There was one square-built, good-humored
old man who appeared to be the whole world's cousin: he passed from table to table, and had
to sip from fifty offered glasses.

With our delicious coffee and boiled cream we ordered the host, as a suitable person, to find
us a guide to carry our valise and shawls to Bad Scharst. Probably the perpetual and loud demands
for pints of wine left him but little time to make a wise selection, seeing that there soon
stood before us a small man with so subtle and malignant a look that his exorbitant demand
made us only too gladly dismiss him. Our confidence shaken in the landlord's powers of discrimination,
we sent word below that if Anton had returned we should be glad to speak with him. He had been
in the village to visit his cousins, but was waiting our orders below. Although his native
shyness made it hard for him to step forward and address ladies under the curious gaze of all
the relative Seppls and Barthels, he did it with manliness, and turning round and addressing
the popular old man as Hansel, asked him if his brother Jörgel were below; and being answered
in the affirmative, he hastened away, and returned with another compact little peasant, whom
he introduced to us as Senner Franz's brother, with an aside, that he was "a friendly mortal
and Count Arlberg's forester."

The agreement was soon made, the sullen-looking man glowering at us from behind a stack of
firewood, whilst Hansel and Anton packed a kraxe or wooden frame and fixed it on Jörgel's back.
As we set off, Anton drove away homeward, although the skittle-balls were just beginning to
roll, and the sound of "I bin a lustiger bua" and other Tyrolese songs came floating from the
windows.

SAINT ROMUALDO.

  I give God thanks that I, a lean old man,
  Wrinkled, infirm, and crippled with keen pains
  By austere penance and continuous toil,
  Now rest in spirit, and possess "the peace
  Which passeth understanding." Th' end draws nigh,
  Though the beginning is as yesterday,
  And a broad lifetime spreads 'twixt this and that--
  A favored life, though outwardly the butt
  Of ignominy, malice and affront,
  Yet lighted from within by the clear star
  Of a high aim, and graciously prolonged
  To see at last its utmost goal attained.
  I speak not of mine Order and my House,
  Here founded by my hands and filled with saints--
  A white society of snowy souls,
  Swayed by my voice, by mine example led;
  For this is but the natural harvest reaped
  From labors such as mine when blessed by God.
  Though I rejoice to think my spirit still
  Will work my purposes, through worthy hands,
  After my bones are shriveled into dust,
  Yet have I gleaned a finer, sweeter fruit
  Of holy satisfaction, sure and real,
  Though subtler than the tissue of the air--
  The power completely to detach the soul
  From her companion through this life, the flesh;
  So that in blessed privacy of peace,
  Communing with high angels, she can hold,
  Serenely rapt, her solitary course.

    Ye know, O saints of heaven, what I have borne
  Of discipline and scourge; the twisted lash
  Of knotted rope that striped my shrinking limbs;
  Vigils and fasts protracted, till my flesh
  Wasted and crumbled from mine aching bones,
  And the last skin, one woof of pain and sores,
  Thereto like yellow parchment loosely clung;
  Exposure to the fever and the frost,
  When 'mongst the hollows of the hills I lurked
  From persecution of misguided folk,
  Accustoming my spirit to ignore
  The burden of the cross, while picturing
  The bliss of disembodied souls, the grace
  Of holiness, the lives of sainted men,
  And entertaining all exalted thoughts,
  That nowise touched the trouble of the hour,
  Until the grief and pain seemed far less real
  Than the creations of my brain inspired.
  The vision, the beatitude, were true:
  The agony was but an evil dream.
  I speak not now as one who hath not learned
  The purport of those lightly-bandied words,
  Evil and Fate, but rather one who knows
  The thunders of the terrors of the world.
  No mortal chance or change, no earthly shock,
  Can move or reach my soul, securely throned
  On heights of contemplation and calm prayer,
  Happy, serene, no less with actual joy
  Of present peace than faith in joys to come.

    This soft, sweet, yellow evening, how the trees
  Stand crisp against the clear, bright-colored sky!
  How the white mountain-tops distinctly shine,
  Taking and giving radiance, and the slopes
  Are purpled with rich floods of peach-hued light!
  Thank God, my filmy, old dislustred eyes
  Find the same sense of exquisite delight,
  My heart vibrates to the same touch of joy
  In scenes like this, as when my pulse danced high,
  And youth coursed through my veins! This the one link
  That binds the wan old man that now I am
  To the wild lad who followed up the hounds
  Among Ravenna's pine-woods by the sea.
  For there how oft would I lose all delight
  In the pursuit, the triumph or the game,
  To stray alone among the shadowy glades,
  And gaze, as one who is not satisfied
  With gazing, at the large, bright, breathing sea,
  The forest glooms, and shifting gleams between
  The fine dark fringes of the fadeless trees,
  On gold-green turf, sweetbrier and wild pink rose!
  How rich that buoyant air with changing scent
  Of pungent pine, fresh flowers and salt cool seas!
  And when all echoes of the chase had died,
  Of horn and halloo, bells and baying hounds,
  How mine ears drank the ripple of the tide
  On that fair shore, the chirp of unseen birds,
  The rustling of the tangled undergrowth,
  And the deep lyric murmur of the pines,
  When through their high tops swept the sudden breeze!
  There was my world, there would my heart dilate,
  And my aspiring soul dissolve in prayer
  Unto that Spirit of Love whose energies
  Were active round me, yet whose presence, sphered
  In the unsearchable, unbodied air,
  Made itself felt, but reigned invisible.
  This ere the day that from my past divides
  My present, and that made me what I am.
  Still can I see the hot, bright sky, the sea
  illimitably sparkling, as they showed
  That morning. Though I deemed I took no note
  Of heaven or earth or waters, yet my mind
  Retains to-day the vivid portraiture
  Of every line and feature of the scene.
  Light-hearted 'midst the dewy lanes I fared
  Unto the sea, whose jocund gleam I caught
  Between the slim boles, when I heard the clink
  Of naked weapons, then a sudden thrust
  Sickening to hear, and then a stifled groan;
  And pressing forward I beheld the sight
  That seared itself for ever on my brain--
  My kinsman, Ser Ranieri, on the turf,
  Fallen upon his side, his bright young head
  Among the pine-spurs, and his cheek pressed close
  Unto the moist, chill sod: his fingers clutched
  A handful of loose weeds and grass and earth,
  Uprooted in his anguish as he fell,
  And slowly from his heart the thick stream flowed,
  Fouling the green, leaving the fair, sweet face
  Ghastly, transparent, with blue, stony eyes
  Staring in blankness on that other one
  Who triumphed over him. With hot desire
  Of instant vengeance I unsheathed my sword
  To rush upon the slayer, when he turned
  In his first terror of blood-guiltiness.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Within my heart a something snapped and brake.
  What was it but the chord of rapturous joy
  For ever stilled? I tottered and would fall,
  Had I not leaned against the friendly pine;
  For all realities of life, unmoored
  From their firm anchorage, appeared to float
  Like hollow phantoms past my dizzy brain.
  The strange delusion wrought upon my soul
  That this had been enacted ages since.
  This very horror curdled at my heart,
  This net of trees spread round, these iron heavens,
  Were closing over me when I had stood,
  Unnumbered cycles back, and fronted him,
  My father; and he felt mine eyes as now,
  Yet saw me not; and then, as now, that form,
  The one thing real, lay stretched between us both.
  The fancy passed, and I stood sane and strong
  To grasp the truth. Then I remembered all--
  A few fierce words between them yester eve
  Concerning some poor plot of pasturage,
  Soon silenced into courteous, frigid calm:
  This was the end. I could not meet him now,
  To curse him, to accuse him, or to save,
  And draw him from the red entanglement
  Coiled by his own hands round his ruined life.
  God pardon me! My heart that moment held
  No drop of pity toward this wretched soul;
  And cowering down, as though his guilt were mine,
  I fled amidst the savage silences
  Of that grim wood, resolved to nurse alone
  My boundless desolation, shame and grief.

    There, in that thick-leaved twilight of high noon,
  The quiet of the still, suspended air,
  Once more my wandering thoughts were calmly ranged,
  Shepherded by my will. I wept, I prayed
  A solemn prayer, conceived in agony,
  Blessed with response instant, miraculous;
  For in that hour my spirit was at one
  With Him who knows and satisfies her needs.
  The supplication and the blessing sprang
  From the same source, inspired divinely both.
  I prayed for light, self-knowledge, guidance, truth,
  And these like heavenly manna were rained down
  To feed my hungered soul. His guilt was mine.
  What angel had been sent to stay mine arm
  Until the fateful moment passed away
  That would have ushered an eternity
  Of withering remorse? I found the germs
  In mine own heart of every human sin,
  That waited but occasion's tempting breath
  To overgrow with poisoned bloom my life.
  What God thus far had saved me from myself?
  Here was the lofty truth revealed, that each
  Must feel himself in all, must know where'er
  The great soul acts or suffers or enjoys,
  His proper soul in kinship there is bound.
  Then my life-purpose dawned upon my mind,
  Encouraging as morning. As I lay,
  Crushed by the weight of universal love,
  Which mine own thoughts had heaped upon myself,
  I heard the clear chime of a slow, sweet bell.
  I knew it--whence it came and what it sang.
  From the gray convent nigh the wood it pealed,
  And called the monks to prayer. Vigil and prayer,
  Clean lives, white days of strict austerity:
  Such were the offerings of these holy saints.
  How far might such not tend to expiate
  A riotous world's indulgence? Here my life,
  Doubly austere and doubly sanctified,
  Might even for that other one atone,
  So bound to mine, till both should be forgiven.

    They sheltered me, not questioning the need
  That led me to their cloistered solitude.
  How rich, how freighted with pure influence,
  With dear security of perfect peace,
  Was the first day I passed within those walls!
  The holy habit of perpetual prayer,
  The gentle greetings, the rare temperate speech,
  The chastening discipline, the atmosphere
  Of settled and profound tranquillity,
  Were even as living waters unto one
  Who perisheth of thirst. Was this the world
  That yesterday seemed one huge battle-field
  For brutish passions? Could the soul of man
  Withdraw so easily, and erect apart
  Her own fair temple for her own high ends?
  But this serene contentment slowly waned
  As I discerned the broad disparity
  Betwixt the form and spirit of the laws
  That bound the order in strait brotherhood.
  Yet when I sought to gain a larger love,
  More rigid discipline, severer truth,
  And more complete surrender of the soul
  Unto her God, this was to my reproach,
  And scoffs and gibes beset me on all sides.
  In mine own cell I mortified my flesh,
  I held aloof from all my brethren's feasts
  To wrestle with my viewless enemies,
  Till they should leave their blessing on my head;
  For nightly was I haunted by that face,
  White, bloodless, as I saw it 'midst the ferns,
  Now staring out of darkness, and it held
  Mine eyes from slumber and my brain from rest
  And drove me from my straw to weep and pray.
  Rebellious thoughts such subtle torture wrought
  Upon my spirit that I lay day-long
  In dumb despair, until the blessed hope
  Of mercy dawned again upon my soul,
  As gradual as the slow gold moon that mounts
  The airy steps of heaven. My faith arose
  With sure perception that disaster, wrong,
  And every shadow of man's destiny
  Are merely circumstance, and cannot touch
  The soul's fine essence: they exist or die
  Only as she affirms them or denies.

    This faith sustains me even to the end:
  It floods my heart with peace as surely now
  As on that day the friars drove me forth,
  Urging that my asceticism, too harsh,
  Endured through pride, would bring into reproach
  Their customs and their order. Then began
  My exile in the mountains, where I bode
  A hunted man. The elements conspired
  Against me, and I was the seasons' sport,
  Drenched, parched, and scorched and frozen alternately,
  Burned with shrewd frosts, prostrated by fierce heats,
  Shivering 'neath chilling dews and gusty rains,
  And buffeted by all the winds of heaven.
  Yet was this period my time of joy:
  My daily thoughts perpetual converse held
  With angels ministrant; mine ears were charmed
  With sweet accordance of celestial sounds,
  Song, harp and choir, clear ringing through the air.
  And visions were revealed unto mine eyes
  By night and day of Heaven's very courts,
  In shadowless, undimmed magnificence.
  I gave God thanks, not that He sheltered me,
  And fed me as He feeds the fowls of air--
  For had I perished, this too had been well--
  But for the revelation of His truth,
  The glory, the beatitude vouchsafed
  To exalt, to heal, to quicken, to inspire;
  So that the pinched, lean excommunicate
  Was crowned with joy more solid, more secure,
  Than all the comfort of the vales could bring.
  Then the good Lord touched certain fervid hearts,
  Aspiring toward His love, to come to me,
  Timid and few at first; but as they heard
  From mine own lips the precious oracles,
  That soothed the trouble of their souls, appeased
  Their spiritual hunger, and disclosed
  All of the God within them to themselves,
  They flocked about me, and they hailed me saint,
  And sware to follow and to serve the good
  Which my word published and my life declared.
  Thus the lone hermit of the mountain-top
  Descended leader of a band of saints,
  And midway 'twixt the summit and the vale
  I perched my convent. Yet I bated not
  One whit of strict restraint and abstinence.
  And they who love me and who serve the truth
  Have learned to suffer with me, and have won
  The supreme joy that is not of the flesh,
  Foretasting the delights of Paradise.
  This faith, to them imparted, will endure
  After my tongue hath ceased to utter it,
  And the great peace hath settled on my soul.

EMMA LAZARUS.

"O TERQUE QUATERQUE BEATE!"

Consider what a task this unhappy man Ingram had voluntarily undertaken! Here were two young
people presumably in love. One of them was laid under suspicion by several previous love-affairs,
though none of these, doubtless, had been so serious as the present. The other scarcely knew
her own mind, or perhaps was afraid to question herself too closely, lest all the conflict
between duty and inclination, with its fears and anxieties and troubles, should be too suddenly
revealed. Moreover, this girl was the only daughter of a solitary and irascible old gentleman
living in a remote island; and Ingram had not only undertaken that the love-affairs of the
young folks should come all right--thus assuming a responsibility which might have appalled
the bravest--but was also expected to inform the King of Borva that his daughter was about
to be taken away from him.

Of course, if Sheila had been a properly brought-up young lady, nothing of this sort would
have been necessary. We all know what the properly brought-up young lady does under such circumstances.
She goes straight to her papa and mamma and says, "My dear papa and mamma, I have been taught
by my various instructors that I ought to have no secrets from my dear parents; and I therefore
hasten to lay aside any little shyness or modesty or doubt of my own wishes I might feel, for
the purpose of explaining to you the extent to which I have become a victim to the tender passion,
and of soliciting your advice. I also place before you these letters I have received from the
gentleman in question: probably they were sent in confidence to me, but I must banish any scruples
that do not coincide with my duty to you. I may say that I respect, and even admire, Mr. So-and-So;
and I should be unworthy of the care bestowed upon my education by my dear parents if I were
altogether insensible to the advantages of his worldly position. But beyond this point I am
at a loss to define my sentiments; and so I ask you, my dear papa and mamma, for permission
to study the question for some little time longer, when I may be able to furnish you with a
more accurate report of my feelings. At the same time, if the interest I have in this young
man is likely to conflict with the duty I owe to my dear parents, I ask to be informed of the
fact; and I shall then teach myself to guard against the approach of that insidious passion
which might make me indifferent to the higher calls and interests of life." Happy the man who
marries such a woman! No agonizing quarrels and delirious reconciliations, no piteous entreaties
and fits of remorse and impetuous self-sacrifices await him, but a beautiful, methodical, placid
life, as calm and accurate and steadily progressive as the multiplication table. His household
will be a miracle of perfect arrangement. The relations between the members of it will be as
strictly defined as the pattern of the paper on the walls. And how can a quarrel arise when
a dissecter of the emotions is close at hand to say where the divergence of opinion or interest
began? and how can a fit of jealousy be provoked in the case of a person who will split up
her affections into fifteen parts, give ten-fifteenths to her children, three-fifteenths to
her parents, and the remainder to her husband? Should there be any dismal fractions going about,
friends and acquaintances may come in for them.

But how was Sheila to go to her father and explain to him what she could not explain to herself?
She had never dreamed of marriage. She had never thought of having to leave Borva and her father's
house. But she had some vague feeling that in the future lay many terrible possibilities that
she did not as yet dare to look at--until, at least, she was more satisfied as to the present.
And how could she go to her father with such a chaos of unformed wishes and fears to place
before him? That such a duty should have devolved upon Ingram was certainly odd enough, but
it was not her doing. His knowledge of the position of these young people was not derived from
her. But, having got it, he had himself asked her to leave the whole affair in his hands, with
that kindness and generosity which had more than once filled her heart with an unspeakable
gratitude toward him.

"Well, you are a good fellow!" said Lavender to him when he heard of this decision.

"Bah!" said the other with a shrug of his shoulders. "I mean to amuse myself. I shall move
you about like pieces on a chess-board, and have a pretty game with you. How to checkmate the
king with a knight and a princess, in any number of moves you like--that is the problem; and
my princess has a strong power over the king where she is just now."

"It's an uncommonly awkward business, you know, Ingram," said Lavender ruefully.

"Well, it is. Old Mackenzie is a tough old fellow to deal with, and you'll do no good by making
a fight of it. Wait! Difficulties don't look so formidable when you take them one by one as
they turn up. If you really love the girl, and mean to take your chance of getting her, and
if she cares enough for you to sacrifice a good deal for your sake, there is nothing to fear."

"I can answer for myself, any way," said Lavender in a tone of voice that Ingram rather liked:
the young man did not always speak with the same quietness, thoughtfulness and modesty.

And how naturally and easily it came about, after all! They were back again at Borva. They
had driven round and about Lewis, and had finished up with Stornoway; and, now that they had
got back to the island in Loch Roag, the quaint little drawing-room had even to Lavender a
homely and friendly look. The big stuffed fishes and the sponge shells were old acquaintances;
and he went to hunt up Sheila's music just as if he had known that dusky corner for years.

"Yes, yes," called Mackenzie, "it iss the English songs we will try now."

He had a notion that he was himself rather a good hand at a part song--just as Sheila had innocently
taught him to believe that he was a brilliant whist-player when he had mastered the art of
returning his partner's lead--but fortunately at this moment he was engaged with a long pipe
and a big tumbler of hot whisky and water. Ingram was similarly employed, lying back in a cane-bottomed
easy-chair, and placidly watching the smoke ascending to the roof. Sometimes he cast an eye
to the young folks at the other end of the room. They formed a pretty sight, he thought. Lavender
was a good-looking fellow enough, and there was something pleasing in the quiet and assiduous
fashion in which he waited upon Sheila, and in the almost timid way in which he spoke to her.
Sheila herself sat at the piano, clad all in slate-gray silk, with a narrow band of scarlet
velvet round her neck; and it was only by a chance turning of the head that Ingram caught the
tender and handsome profile, broken only by the outward sweep of the long eyelashes.

  Love in thine eyes for ever plays,

Sheila sang, with her father keeping time by patting his forefinger on the table.

Or were there not three voices? Surely, from the back part of the room, the musicians could
hear a wandering bass come in from time to time, especially at such portions as "Ah, he never--ah,
he never touched thy heart!" which old Mackenzie considered very touching. But there was something
quaint and friendly and pleasant in the pathos of those English songs, which made them far
more acceptable to him than Sheila's wild and melancholy legends of the sea. He sang "Ah, he
never, never touched thy heart!" with an outward expression of grief, but with much inward
satisfaction. Was it the quaint phraseology of the old duets that awoke in him some faint ambition
after histrionic effect? At all events, Sheila proceeded to another of his favorites, "All's
Well," and here, amid the brisk music, the old man had an excellent opportunity of striking
in at random--

  The careful watch patrols the deck
  To guard the ship from foes or wreck.

These two lines he had absolutely mastered, and always sang them, whatever might be the key
he happened to light on, with great vigor. He soon went the length of improvising a part for
himself in the closing passages, and laid down his pipe altogether as he sang--

  What cheer? Brother, quickly tell!
  Above! Below! Good-night! All, all's well!

From that point, however, Sheila and her companion wandered away into fields of melody whither
the King of Borva could not follow them; so he was content to resume his pipe and listen placidly
to the pretty airs. He caught but bits and fragments of phrases and sentiments, but they evidently
were comfortable, merry, good-natured songs for young folks to sing. There was a good deal
of love-making, and rosy morns appearing, and merry zephyrs, and such odd things, which, sung
briskly and gladly by two young and fresh voices, rather drew the hearts of contemplative listeners
to the musicians.

"They sing very well whatever," said Mackenzie with a critical air to Ingram when the young
people were so busily engaged with their own affairs as apparently to forget the presence of
the others. "Oh yes, they sing very well whatever; and what should the young folks sing about
but making love and courting, and all that?"

"Natural enough," said Ingram, looking rather wistfully at the two at the other end of the
room. "I suppose Sheila will have a sweetheart some day?"

"Oh yes, Sheila will hef a sweetheart some day," said her father good-humoredly. "Sheila is
a good-looking girl: she will hef a sweetheart some day."

"She will be marrying too, I suppose," said Ingram cautiously.

"Oh yes, she will marry--Sheila will marry: what will be the life of a young girl if she does
not marry?"

At this moment, as Ingram afterward described it, a sort of "flash of inspiration" darted in
upon him, and he resolved there and then to brave the wrath of the old king, and place all
the conspiracy before him, if only the music kept loud enough to prevent his being overheard.

"It will be hard on you to part with Sheila when she marries," said Ingram, scarcely daring
to look up.

"Oh, ay, it will be that," said Mackenzie cheerfully enough. "But it iss every one will hef
to do that, and no great harm comes of it. Oh no, it will not be much whatever; and Sheila,
she will be very glad in a little while after, and it will be enough for me to see that she
is ferry contented and happy. The young folk must marry, you will see; and what is the use
of marrying if it is not when they are young? But Sheila, she will think of none of these things.
It was young Mr. MacIntyre of Sutherland--you hef seen him last year in Stornoway: he hass
three thousand acres of a deer forest in Sutherland--and he will be ferry glad to marry my
Sheila. But I will say to him, 'It is not for me to say yes or no to you, Mr. MacIntyre: it
is Sheila herself will tell you that.' But he wass afraid to speak to her; and Sheila herself
will know nothing of why he came twice to Borva the last year."

"It is very good of you to leave Sheila quite unbiased in her choice," said Ingram: "many fathers
would have been sorely tempted by that deer forest."

Old Mackenzie laughed a loud laugh of derision, that fortunately did not stop Lavender's execution
of "I would that my love would silently."

"What the teffle," said Mackenzie, "hef I to want a deer forest for my Sheila? Sheila is no
fisherman's lass. She has plenty for herself, and she will marry just the young man she wants
to marry, and no other one: that is what she will do, by Kott!"

All this was most hopeful. If Mackenzie had himself been advocating Lavender's suit, could
he have said more? But notwithstanding all these frank and generous promises, dealing with
a future which the old man considered as indefinitely remote, Ingram was still afraid of the
announcement he was about to make.

"Sheila is fortunately situated," he said, "in having a father who thinks only of her happiness.
But I suppose she has never yet shown a preference for any one?"

"Not for any one but yourself," said her father with a laugh.

And Ingram laughed too, but in an embarrassed way, and his sallow face grew darker with a blush.
Was there not something painful in the unintentional implication that of course Ingram could
not be considered a possible lover of Sheila's, and that the girl herself was so well aware
of it that she could openly testify to her regard for him?

"And it would be a good thing for Sheila," continued her father, more gravely, "if there wass
any young man about the Lewis that she would tek a liking to; for it will be some day I can
no more look after her, and it would be bad for her to be left alone all by herself in the island."

"And you don't think you see before you now some one who might take on him the charge of Sheila's
future?" said Ingram, looking toward Lavender.

"The English gentleman?" said Mackenzie with a smile. "No, that any way is not possible."

"I fancy it is more than possible," said Ingram, resolved to go straight at it. "I know for
a fact that he would like to marry your daughter, and I think that Sheila, without knowing
it herself almost, is well inclined toward him."

The old man started up from his chair: "Eh? what! my Sheila?"

"Yes, papa," said the girl, turning round at once.

She caught sight of a strange look on his face, and in an instant was by his side: "Papa, what
is the matter with you?"

"Nothing, Sheila, nothing," he said impatiently. "I am a little tired of the music, that is
all. But go on with the music. Go back to the piano, Sheila, and go on with the music, and
Mr. Ingram and me, we will go outside for a little while."

Mackenzie walked out of the room, and said aloud in the hall, "Ay, are you coming, Mr. Ingram?
It iss a fine night this night, and the wind is in a very good way for the weather."

And then, as he went out to the front, he hummed aloud, so that Sheila should hear,

  Who goes there? Stranger, quickly tell!
  A friend! The word! Good-night! All's well!
  All's well! Good-night! All's well!

Ingram followed the old man outside, with a somewhat guilty conscience suggesting odd things
to him. Would it not be possible now to shut one's ears for the next half hour? Angry words
were only little perturbations in the air. If you shut your ears till they were all over, what
harm could be done? All the big facts of life would remain the same. The sea, the sky, the
hills, the human beings around you, even your desire of sleep for the night and your wholesome
longing for breakfast in the morning, would all remain, and the angry words would have passed
away. But perhaps it was a proper punishment that he should now go out and bear all the wrath
of this fierce old gentleman, whose daughter he had conspired to carry off. Mackenzie was walking
up and down the path outside in the cool and silent night. There was not much moon now, but
a clear and lambent twilight showed all the familiar features of Loch Roag and the southern
hills, and down there in the bay you could vaguely make out the Maighdean-mhara rocking in
the tiny waves that washed in on the white shore. Ingram had never looked on this pretty picture
with a less feeling of delight.

"Well, you see, Mr. Mackenzie," he was beginning, "you must make this excuse for him--"

But Mackenzie put aside Lavender at once. It was all about Sheila that he wanted to know. There
was no anger in his words; only a great anxiety, and sometimes an extraordinary and pathetic
effort to take a philosophical view of the situation. What had Sheila said? Was Sheila deeply
interested in the young man? Would it please Sheila if he was to go in-doors and give at once
his free consent to her marrying this Mr. Lavender?

"Oh, you must not think," said Mackenzie, with a certain loftiness of air even amidst his great
perturbation and anxiety--"you must not think I hef not foreseen all this. It wass some day
or other Sheila will be sure to marry; and although I did not expect--no, I did not expect
that--that she would marry a stranger and an Englishman, if it will please her that is enough.
You cannot tell a young lass the one she should marry: it iss all a chance the one she likes,
and if she does not marry him it is better she will not marry at all. Oh yes, I know that ferry
well. And I hef known there wass a time coming when I would give away my Sheila to some young
man; and there iss no use complaining of it. But you hef not told me much about this young
man, or I hef forgotten: it is the same thing whatever. He has not much money, you said--he
is waiting for some money. Well, this is what I will do: I will give him all my money if he
will come and live in the Lewis."

All the philosophy he had been mustering up fell away from that last sentence. It was like
the cry of a drowning man who sees the last life-boat set out for shore, leaving him to his
fate. And Ingram had not a word to say in reply to that piteous entreaty.

"I do not ask him to stop in Borva: no, it iss a small place for one that hass lived in a town.
But the Lewis, that is quite different; and there iss ferry good houses in Stornoway."

"But surely, sir," said Ingram, "you need not consider all this just yet. I am sure neither
of them has thought of any such thing."

"No," said Mackenzie, recovering himself, "perhaps not. But we hef our duties to look at the
future of young folks. And you will say that Mr. Lavender hass only expectations of money?"

"Well, the expectation is almost a certainty. His aunt, I have told you, is a very rich old
lady, who has no other near relations, and she is exceedingly fond of him, and would do anything
for him. I am sure the allowance he has now is greatly in excess of what she spends on herself."

"But they might quarrel, you know--they might quarrel. You hef always to look to the future:
they might quarrel, and what will he do then?"

"Why, you don't suppose he couldn't support himself if the worst were to come to the worst?
He is an amazingly clever fellow--"

"Ay, that is very good," said Mackenzie in a cautious sort of way, "but has he ever made any
money?"

"Oh, I fancy not--nothing to speak of. He has sold some pictures, but I think he has given
more away."

"Then it iss not easy, tek my word for it, Mr. Ingram, to begin a new trade if you are twenty-five
years of age; and the people who will tek your pictures for nothing, will they pay for them
if you wanted the money?"

It was obviously the old man's eager wish to prove to himself that, somehow or other, Lavender
might come to have no money, and be made dependent on his father-in-law. So far, indeed, from
sharing the sentiments ordinarily attributed to that important relative, he would have welcomed
with a heartfelt joy the information that the man who, as he expected, was about to marry his
daughter was absolutely penniless. Not even all the attractions of that deer forest in Sutherlandshire--particularly
fascinating as they must have been to a man of his education and surroundings--had been able
to lead the old King of Borva even into hinting to his daughter that the owner of that property
would like to marry her. Sheila was to choose for herself. She was not like a fisherman's lass,
bound to consider ways and means. And now that she had chosen, or at least indicated the possibility
of her doing so, her father's chief desire was that his future son-in-law should come and take
and enjoy his money, so only that Sheila might not be carried away from him for ever.

"Well, I will see about it," said Mackenzie with an affectation of cheerful and practical shrewdness.
"Oh yes, I will see about it when Sheila has made up her mind. He is a very good young man,
whatever--"

"He is the best-hearted fellow I know," said Ingram warmly. "I don't think Sheila has much
to fear if she marries him. If you had known him as long as I have, you would know how considerate
he is to everybody about him, how generous he is, how good-natured and cheerful, and so forth:
in short, he is a thorough good fellow, that's what I have to say about him."

"It iss well for him he will hef such a champion," said Mackenzie with a smile: "there is not
many Sheila will pay attention to as she does to you."

They went in-doors again, Ingram scarcely knowing how he had got so easily through the ordeal,
but very glad it was over.

Sheila was still at the piano, and on their entering she said, "Papa, here is a song you must
learn to sing with me."

"And what iss it, Sheila?" he said, going over to her.

"'Time has not thinned my flowing hair.'"

He put his hand on her head and said, "I hope it will be a long time before he will thin your
hair, Sheila."

The girl looked up surprised. Scotch folks are, as a rule, somewhat reticent in their display
of affection, and it was not often that her father talked to her in that way. What was there
in his face that made her glance instinctively toward Ingram. Somehow or other her hand sought
her father's hand, and she rose and went away from the piano, with her head bent down and tears
beginning to tell in her eyes.

"Yes, that is a capital song," said Ingram loudly. Sing 'The Arethusa,' Lavender--'Said the
saucy Arethusa.'"

Lavender, knowing what had taken place, and not daring to follow with his eyes Sheila and her
father, who had gone to the other end of the room, sang the song. Never was a gallant and devil-may-care
sea-song sung so hopelessly without spirit. But the piano made a noise and the verses took
up time. When he had finished he almost feared to turn round, and yet there was nothing dreadful
in the picture that presented itself. Sheila was sitting on her father's knee, with her head
buried in his bosom, while he was patting her head and talking in a low voice to her. The King
of Borva did not look particularly fierce.

"Yes, it iss a teffle of a good song," he said suddenly. "Now get up, Sheila, and go and tell
Mairi we will have a bit of bread and cheese before going to bed. And there will be a little
hot water wanted in the other room, for this room it iss too full of the smoke."

Sheila, as she went out of the room, had her head cast down and perhaps an extra tinge of color
in her young and pretty face. But surely, Lavender thought to himself as he watched her anxiously,
she did not look grieved. As for her father, what should he do now? Turn suddenly round and
beg Mackenzie's pardon, and throw himself on his generosity? When he did, with much inward
trembling, venture to approach the old man, he found no such explanation possible. The King
of Borva was in one of his grandest moods--dignified, courteous, cautious, and yet inclined
to treat everybody and everything with a sort of lofty good-humor. He spoke to Lavender in
the most friendly way, but it was about the singular and startling fact that modern research
had proved many of the Roman legends to be utterly untrustworthy. Mr. Mackenzie observed that
the man was wanting in proper courage who feared to accept the results of such inquiries. It
was better that we should know the truth, and then the kings who had really made Rome great
might emerge from the fog of tradition in their proper shape. There was something quite sympathetic
in the way he talked of those ill-treated sovereigns, whom the vulgar mind had clothed in mist.

Lavender was sorely beset by the rival claims of Rome and Borva upon his attention. He was
inwardly inclined to curse Numa Pompilius--which would have been ineffectual--when he found
that personage interfering with a wild effort to discover why Mackenzie should treat him in
this way. And then it occurred to him that, as he had never said a word to Mackenzie about
this affair, it was too much to expect that Sheila's father should himself open the subject.
On the contrary, Mackenzie was bent on extending a grave courtesy to his guest, so that the
latter should not feel ill at ease until it suited himself to make any explanations he might
choose. It was not Mackenzie's business to ask this young man if he wanted to marry Sheila.
No. The king's daughter, if she were to be won at all, was to be won by a suitor, and it was
not for her father to be in a hurry about it. So Lavender got back into the region of early
Roman history, and tried to recall what he had learned in Livy, and quite coincided with everything
that Niebuhr had said or proved, and with everything that Mackenzie thought Niebuhr had said
or proved. He was only too glad, indeed, to find himself talking to Sheila's father in this
friendly fashion.

Then Sheila came in and told them that supper was laid in the adjoining room. At that modest
meal a great good-humor prevailed. Sometimes, it is true, it occurred to Ingram that Sheila
occasionally cast an anxious glance to her father, as if she were trying to discover whether
he was really satisfied, or whether he were not merely pretending satisfaction to please her;
but for the rest the party was a most friendly and merry one. Lavender, naturally enough, was
in the highest of spirits, and nothing could exceed the lighthearted endeavors he made to amuse
and interest and cheer his companions. Sheila, indeed, sat up later than usual, even although
pipes were lit again, and the slate-gray silk likely to bear witness to the fact in the morning.
How comfortable and homely was this sort of life in the remote stone building overlooking the
sea! He began to think that he could live always in Borva if only Sheila were with him as his
companion.

Was it an actual fact, then, he asked himself next morning, that he stood confessed to the
small world of Borva as Sheila's accepted lover? Not a word on the subject had passed between
Mackenzie and himself, and yet he found himself assuming the position of a younger relative,
and rather expecting advice from the old man. He began to take a great interest, too, in the
local administration of the island: he examined the window-fastenings of Mackenzie's house
and saw that they would be useful in the winter, and expressed to Sheila's father his confidential
opinion that the girl should not be allowed to go out in the Maighdean-mhara without Duncan.

"She will know as much about boats as Duncan himself," said her father with a smile. "But Sheila
will not go out when the rough weather begins."

"Of course you keep her in-doors then," said the younger man, already assuming some little
charge over Sheila's comfort.

The father laughed aloud at this simplicity on the part of the Englishman: "If we wass to keep
in-doors in the bad weather, it would be all the winter we would be in-doors! There iss no
day at all Sheila will not be out some time or other; and she is never so well as in the hard
weather, when she will be out always in the snow and the frost, and hef plenty of exercise
and amusement."

"She is not often ailing, I suppose?" said Lavender.

"She is as strong as a young pony, that is what Sheila is," said her father proudly. "And there
is no one in the island will run so fast, or walk so long without tiring, or carry things from
the shore as she will--not one."

But here he suddenly checked himself. "That is," he said with some little expression of annoyance,
"I wass saying Sheila could do that if it wass any use; but she will not do such things, like
a fisherman's lass that hass to keep in the work."

"Oh, of course not," said Lavender hastily. "But still, you know, it is pleasant to know she
is so strong and well."

And at this moment Sheila herself appeared, accompanied by her great deerhound, and testifying
by the bright color in her face to the assurances of her health her father had been giving.
She had just come up and over the hill from Borvabost, while as yet breakfast had not been
served. Somehow or other, Lavender fancied she never looked so bright and bold and handsome
as in the early morning, with the fresh sea-air tingling the color in her cheeks, and the sunlight
shining in the clear eyes or giving from time to time a glimpse of her perfect teeth. But this
morning she did not seem quite so frankly merry as usual. She patted the deerhound's head,
and rather kept her eyes away from her father and his companion. And then she took Bras away
to give him his breakfast, just as Ingram appeared to bid her good-morning and ask her what
she meant by being about so early.

How anxiously Lavender now began to calculate on the remaining days of their stay in Borva!
They seemed so few. He got up at preposterously early hours to make each day as long as possible,
but it slipped away with a fatal speed; and already he began to think of Stornoway and the
Clansman and his bidding good-bye to Sheila. He had said no more to her of any pledge as regarded
the future. He was content to see that she was pleased to be with him; and happy indeed were
their rambles about the island, their excursions in Sheila's boat, their visits to the White
Water in search of salmon. Nor had he yet spoken to Sheila's father. He knew that Mackenzie
knew, and both seemed to take it for granted that no good could come of a formal explanation
until Sheila herself should make her wishes known. That, indeed, was the only aspect of the
case that apparently presented itself to the old King of Borva. He forgot altogether those
precautions and investigations which are supposed to occupy the mind of a future father-in-law,
and only sought to see how Sheila was affected toward the young man who was soon about to leave
the island. When he saw her pleased to be walking with Lavender and talking with him of an
evening, he was pleased, and would rather have a cold dinner than break in upon them to hurry
them home. When he saw her disappointed because Lavender had been unfortunate in his salmon-fishing,
he was ready to swear at Duncan for not having had the fish in a better temper. And the most
of his conversation with Ingram consisted of an endeavor to convince himself that, after all,
what had happened was for the best, and that Sheila seemed to be happy.

But somehow or other, when the time for their departure was drawing near, Mackenzie showed
a strange desire that his guests should spend the last two days in Stornoway. When Lavender
first heard this proposal he glanced toward Sheila, and his face showed clearly his disappointment.

"But Sheila will go with us too," said her father, replying to that unuttered protest in the
most innocent fashion; and then Lavender's face brightened again, and he said that nothing
would give him greater pleasure than to spend two days in Stornoway.

"And you must not think," said Mackenzie anxiously, "that it is one day or two days or a great
many days will show you all the fine things about Stornoway. And if you were to live in Stornoway
you would find very good acquaintances and friends there; and in the autumn, when the shooting
begins, there are many English who will come up, and there will be ferry great doings at the
castle. And there is some gentlemen now at Grimersta whom you hef not seen, and they are ferry
fine gentlemen; and at Garra-na-hina there iss two more gentlemen for the salmon-fishing. Oh,
there iss a great many fine people in the Lewis, and it iss not all as lonely as Borva."

"If it is half as pleasant a place to live in as Borva, it will do," said Lavender, with a
flush of enthusiasm in his face as he looked toward Sheila and saw her pleased and downcast eyes.

"But it iss not to be compared," said Mackenzie eagerly. "Borva, that is nothing at all; but
the Lewis, it is a ferry different thing to live in the Lewis; and many English gentlemen hef
told me they would like to live always in the Lewis."

"I think I should too," said Lavender lightly and carelessly, little thinking what importance
the old man immediately and gladly put upon the admission.

From that moment, Lavender, although unconscious of what had happened, had nothing to fear
in the way of opposition from Sheila's father. If he had there and then boldly asked Mackenzie
for his daughter, the old man would have given his consent freely, and bade Lavender go to
Sheila herself.

And so they set sail, one pleasant forenoon, from Borvabost, and the light wind that ruffled
the blue of Loch Roag gently filled the mainsail of the Maigh-dean-mhara as she lightly ran
down the tortuous channel.

"I don't like to go away from Borva," said Lavender in a low voice to Sheila, "but I might
have been leaving the island with greater regret, for, you know, I expect to be back soon."

"We shall always be glad to see you," said the girl; and although he would rather have had
her say "I" than "we," there was something in the tone of her voice that contented him.

At Garra-na-hina Mackenzie pointed out with a great interest to Lavender a tall man who was
going down through some meadows to the Amhuinn Dhubh, "the Black River." He had a long rod
over his shoulder, and behind him, at some distance, followed a shorter man, who carried a
gaff and landing-net. Mackenzie anxiously explained to Lavender that the tall figure was that
of an Englishman. Lavender accepted the statement. But would he not go down to the river and
make his acquaintance? Lavender could not understand why he should be expected to take so great
an interest in an ordinary English sportsman.

"Ferry well," said Mackenzie, a trifle disappointed, "but you would find several of the English
in the Lewis if you wass living here."

These last two days in Stornoway were very pleasant. On their previous visit to the town Mackenzie
had given up much of his time to business affairs, and was a good deal away from his guests,
but now he devoted himself to making them particularly comfortable in the place and amusing
them in every possible way. He introduced Lavender, in especial, to all his friends there,
and was most anxious to impress on the young man that life in Stornoway was, on the whole,
rather a brilliant affair. Then was there a finer point from which you could start at will
for Inverness, Oban and such great centres of civilization? Very soon there would even be a
telegraphic cable laid to the mainland. Was Mr. Lavender aware that frequently you could see
the Sutherlandshire hills from this very town of Stornoway?

There Sheila laughed, and Lavender, who kept watching her face always to read all her fancies
and sentiments and wishes in the shifting lights of it, immediately demanded an explanation.

"It is no good thing," said Sheila, "to see the Sutherland hills often, for when you see them
it means to rain."

But Lavender had not been taught to fear the rain of the Western Isles. The very weather seemed
to have conspired with Mackenzie to charm the young man with the island. At this moment, for
example, they were driving away from Stornoway along the side of the great bay that stretches
northward until it finds its furthest promontory in Tiumpan Head. What magnificence of color
shone all around them in the hot sunlight! Where the ruffled blue sea came near the long sweep
of yellow sand it grew to be a bright, transparent green. The splendid curve of the bay showed
a gleaming line of white where the waves broke in masses of hissing foam; and beyond that curve
again long promontories of dark red conglomerate ran out into the darker waters of the sea,
with their summits shining with the bright sea-grass. Here, close at hand, were warm meadows,
with calves and lambs cropping the sweet-scented Dutch clover. A few huts, shaped like beehives,
stood by the roadside, close by some deep peat cuttings. There was a cutting in the yellow
sand of the bay for the pulling up of captured whales. Now and again you could see a solan
dart down from the blue heavens into the blue of the sea, sending up a spurt of water twenty
feet high as he disappeared; and far out there, between the red precipices and the ruffled
waters beneath, white sea-fowl flew from crag to crag or dropped down upon the sea to rise
and fall with the waves.

At the small hamlet of Gress they got a large rowing-boat manned by sturdy fishermen, and set
out to explore the great caves formed in the mighty wall of conglomerate that here fronts the
sea. The wild-fowl flew about them, screaming and yelling at being disturbed. The long swell
of the sea lifted the boat, passed from under it, and went on with majestic force to crash
on the glowing red crags and send jets of foam flying up the face of them. They captured one
of the sea-birds--a young thing about as big as a hen, with staring eyes, scant feathers, and
a long beak with which it instinctively tried to bite its enemies--and the parents of it kept
swooping down over the boat, uttering shrill cries, until their offspring was restored to the
surface of the water. They went into the great loud-sounding caverns, getting a new impression
of the extraordinary clearness of the sea-water by the depth at which the bottom was visible;
and here their shouts occasionally called up from some dim twilight recess, far in among the
perilous rocks, the head of a young seal, which would instantly dive again and be seen no more.
They watched the salmon splash in the shallower creeks where the sea had scooped out a tiny
bay of ruddy sand, and then a slowly rolling porpoise would show his black back above the water
and silently disappear again. All this was pleasant enough on a pleasant morning, in fresh
sea-air and sunlight, in holiday-time; and was there any reason, Mackenzie may fairly have
thought, why this young man, if he did marry Sheila, should not come and live in a place where
so much healthy amusement was to be found?

And in the evening, too, when they had climbed to the top of the hills on the south of Stornoway
harbor, did not the little town look sufficiently picturesque, with its white houses, its shipping,
its great castle and plantations lying in shadow under the green of the eastern sky? Then away
to the west what a strange picture presented itself! Thick bands of gray cloud lay across the
sky, and the sunlight from behind them sent down great rays of misty yellow on the endless
miles of moor. But how was it that, as these shafts of sunlight struck on the far and successive
ridges of the moorland, each long undulation seemed to become transparent, and all the island
appeared to consist of great golden-brown shells heaped up behind each other, with the sunlight
shining through?

"I have tried a good many new effects since coming up here," said Lavender, "but I shall not
try that."

"Oh, it iss nothing--it is nothing at all," said Mackenzie with a studied air of unconcern.
"There iss much more beautiful things than that in the island, but you will hef need of a ferry
long time before you will find it all out. That--that iss nothing at all."

"You will perhaps make a picture of it some other time," said Sheila with her eyes cast down,
and as he was standing by her at the time, he took her hand and pressed it, and said, "I hope so."

Then, that night! Did not every hour produce some new and wonderful scene, or was it only that
each minute grew to be so precious, and that the enchantment of Sheila's presence filled the
air around him? There was no moon, but the stars shone over the bay and the harbor and the
dusky hills beyond the castle. Every few seconds the lighthouse at Arnish Point sent out its
wild glare of orange fire into the heart, of the clear darkness, and then as suddenly faded
out and left the eyes too bewildered to make out the configuration of the rocks. All over the
north-west there still remained the pale glow of the twilight, and somehow Lavender seemed
to think that that strange glow belonged to Sheila's home in the west, and that the people
in Stornoway knew nothing of the wonders of Loch Roag and of the strange nights there. Was
he likely ever to forget?

"Good-bye, Sheila," he said next morning, when the last signal had been given and the Clansman
was about to move from her moorings.

She had bidden good-bye to Ingram already, but somehow she could not speak to his companion
just at this last moment. She pressed his hand and turned away, and went ashore with her father.
Then the big steamer throbbed its way out of the harbor, and by and by the island of Lewis
lay but as a thin blue cloud along the horizon; and who could tell that human beings, with
strange hopes and fancies and griefs, were hidden away in that pale line of vapor?

CHAPTER IX.

"FAREWELL, MACKRIMMON!"

A night journey from Greenock to London is a sufficiently prosaic affair in ordinary circumstances,
but it need not be always so. What if a young man, apparently occupied in making himself comfortable
and in talking nonsense to his friend and companion, should be secretly calculating how the
journey could be made most pleasant to a bride, and that bride his bride? Lavender made experiments
with regard to the ways and tempers of guards; he borrowed planks of wood with which to make
sleeping-couches of an ordinary first-class carriage; he bribed a certain official to have
the compartment secured; he took note of the time when, and the place where, refreshments could
be procured: all these things he did, thinking of Sheila. And when Ingram, sometimes surprised
by his good-nature, and occasionally remonstrating against his extravagance, at last fell asleep
on the more or less comfortable cushions stretched across the planks, Lavender would have him
wake up again, that he might be induced to talk once more about Sheila. Ingram would make use
of some wicked words, rub his eyes, ask what was the last station they had passed, and then
begin to preach to Lavender about the great obligations he was under to Sheila, and what would
be expected of him in after times.

"You are coming away just now," he would say, while Lavender, who could not sleep at all, was
only anxious that Sheila's name should be mentioned, "enriched with a greater treasure than
falls to the lot of most men. If you know how to value that treasure, there is not a king or
emperor in Europe who should not envy you."

"But don't you think I value it?" the other would say anxiously.

"We'll see about that afterward, by what you do. But in the mean time you don't know what you
have won. You don't know the magnificent single-heartedness of that girl, her keen sense of
honor, nor the strength of character, of judgment and decision that lies beneath her apparent
simplicity. Why, I have known Sheila, now--But what's the use of talking?"

"I wish you would talk, though, Ingram," said his companion quite submissively. "You have known
her longer than I. I am willing to believe all you say of her, and anxious, indeed, to know
as much about her as possible. You don't suppose I fancy she is anything less than you say?"

"Well," said Ingram doubtfully, "perhaps not. The worst of it is, that you take such odd readings
of people. However, when you marry her, as I now hope you may, you will soon find out; and
then, if you are not grateful, if you don't understand and appreciate then the fine qualities
of this girl, the sooner you put a millstone round your neck and drop over Chelsea Bridge the
better."

"She will always have in you a good friend to look after her when she comes to London."

"Oh, don't imagine I mean to thrust myself in at your breakfast-table to give you advice. If
a husband and wife cannot manage their own affairs satisfactorily, no third person can; and
I am getting to be an elderly man, who likes peace and comfort and his own quiet."

"I wish you wouldn't talk such nonsense!" said Lavender impetuously. "You know you are bound
to marry; and the woman you ask to marry you will be a precious fool if she refuses. I don't
know, indeed, how you and Sheila ever escaped--"

"Look here, Lavender," said his companion, speaking in a somewhat more earnest fashion, "if
you marry Sheila Mackenzie I suppose I may see something of both of you from time to time.
But you are naturally jealous and exacting, as is the way with many good fellows who have had
too much of their own will in the world; and if you start off with the notion now that Sheila
and I might ever have married, or that such a thing was ever thought of by either of us, the
certain consequence will be that you will become jealous of me, and that in time I shall have
to stop seeing either of you if you happen to be living in London."

"And if ever the time comes," said Lavender lightly, "when I prove myself such a fool, I hope
I shall remember that a millstone can be bought in Victoria road and that Chelsea Bridge is handy."

"All right: I'm going to sleep."

For some time after Ingram was permitted to rest in peace, and it was not until they had reached
some big station or other toward morning that he woke. Lavender had never closed his eyes.

"Haven't you been asleep?"

"No."

"What's the matter now?"

"My aunt."

"You seem to have acquired a trick recently of looking at all the difficulties of your position
at once. Why don't you take them singly? You've just got rid of Mackenzie's opposition: that
might have contented you for a while."

"I think the best plan will be to say nothing of this to my aunt at present. I think we ought
to get married first, and when I take Sheila to see her as my wife, what can she say then?"

"But what is Sheila likely to say before then? And Sheila's father? You must be out of your mind!"

"There will be a pretty scene, then, when I tell her."

"Scenes don't hurt anybody, unless when they end in brickbats or decanters. Your aunt must
know you would marry some day."

"Yes, but you know whom she wished me to marry."

"That is nothing. Every old lady has a fancy for imagining possible marriages; but your aunt
is a reasonable woman, and could not possibly object to your marrying a girl like Sheila?"

"Oh, couldn't she? Then you don't know her: 'Frank, my dear, what are the arms borne by your
wife's family?' 'My dear aunt, I will describe them to you as becomes a dutiful nephew. The
arms are quarterly: first and fourth, vert, a herring, argent; second and third, azure, a solan-goose,
volant, or. The crest, out of a crown vallery, argent, a cask of whisky, gules. Supporters,
dexter, a gillie; sinister, a fisherman.'"

"And a very good coat-of-arms, too. You might add the motto Ultimus regum. Or Atavis editus
regibus. Or Tyrrhena regum progenies. To think that your aunt would forbid your wedding a king's
daughter!"

"I should wed the king's daughter, aunt or no aunt, in any case; but, you see, it would be
uncommonly awkward, just as old Mackenzie would want to know something more particular about
my circumstances; and he might ask for references to the old lady herself, just as if I were
a tenant about to take a house."

"I have given him enough references. Go to sleep, and don't bother yourself."

But now Ingram felt himself just as unable as his companion to escape into unconsciousness,
and so he roused himself thoroughly, and began to talk about Lewis and Borva and the Mackenzies,
and the duties and responsibilities Lavender would undertake in marrying Sheila.

"Mackenzie," he said, "will expect you to live in Stornoway at least half the year, and it
will be very hard on him if you don't."

"Oh, as to that," said the other, "I should have no objection; but, you see, if I am to get
married I really think I ought to try to get into some position of earning my own living or
helping toward it, you know. I begin to see how galling this sort of dependence on my aunt
might be if I wished to act for myself. Now, if I were to begin to do anything, I could not
go and bury myself in Lewis for half the year--just at first: by and by, you know, it might
be different. But don't you think I ought to begin and do something?"

"Most certainly. I have often wished you had been born a carpenter or painter or glazier."

"People are not born carpenters or glaziers, but sometimes they are born painters. I think
I have been born nothing; but I am willing to try, more especially as I think Sheila would
like it."

"I know she would."

"I will write and tell her the moment I get to London."

"I would fix first what your occupation was to be, if I were you. There is no hurry about telling
Sheila, although she will be very glad to get as much news of you as possible, and I hope you
will spare no time or trouble in pleasing her in that line. By the way, what an infamous shame
it was of you to go and gammon old Mackenzie into the belief that he can read poetry! Why,
he will make that girl's life a burden to her. I heard him propose to read Paradise Lost to
her as soon as the rain set in."

"I didn't gammon him," said Lavender with a laugh. "Every man thinks he can read poetry better
than every other man, even as every man fancies that no one gets cigars as good and as cheap
as he does, and that no one can drive a horse safely but himself. My talking about his reading
was not as bad as Sheila's persuading him that he can play whist. Did you ever know a man who
did not believe that everybody else's reading of poetry was affected, stilted and unbearable?
I know Mackenzie must have been reading poetry to Sheila long before I mentioned it to him."

"But that suggestion about his resonant voice and the Crystal Palace?"

"That was a joke."

"He did not take it as a joke, and neither did Sheila."

"Well, Sheila would believe that her father could command the Channel fleet, or turn out the
present ministry, or build a bridge to America, if only anybody hinted it to her. Touching
that Crystal Palace: did you observe how little notion of size she could have got from pictures
when she asked me if the Crystal Palace was much bigger than the hot-houses at Lewis Castle?"

"What a world of wonder the girl is coming into!" said the other meditatively. "But it will
be all lit up by one sun if only you take care of her and justify her belief in you."

"I have not much doubt," said Lavender with a certain modest confidence in his manner which
had repeatedly of late pleased his friend.

Even Sheila herself could scarcely have found London more strange than did the two men who
had just returned from a month's sojourn in the northern Hebrides. The dingy trees in Euston
Square, the pale sunlight that shone down on the gray pavements, the noise of the omnibuses
and carts, the multitude of strangers, the blue and mist-like smoke that hung about Tottenham
Court road,--all were as strange to them as the sensation of sitting in a hansom and being
driven along by an unseen driver. Lavender confessed afterward that he was pervaded by an odd
sort of desire to know whether there was anybody in London at all like Sheila. Now and again
a smartly-dressed girl passed along the pavement: what was it that made the difference between
her and that other girl whom he had just left? Yet he wished to have the difference as decided
as possible. When some bright, fresh-colored, pleasant-looking girl passed, he was anxious
to prove to himself that she was not to be compared with Sheila. Where in all London could
you find eyes that told so much? He forgot to place the specialty of Sheila's eyes in the fact
of their being a dark gray-blue under black eyelashes. What he did remember was that no eyes
could possibly say the same things to him as they had said. And where in all London was the
same sweet aspect to be found, or the same unconsciously proud and gentle demeanor, or the
same tender friendliness expressed in a beautiful face? He would not say anything against London
women, for all that. It was no fault of theirs that they could not be sea-kings' daughters,
with the courage and frankness and sweetness of the sea gone into their blood. He was only
too pleased to have proved to himself, by looking at some half dozen pretty shop-girls, that
not in London was there any one to compare with Princess Sheila.

For many a day thereafter Ingram had to suffer a good deal of this sort of lover's logic, and
bore it with great fortitude. Indeed, nothing pleased him more than to observe that Lavender's
affection, so far from waning, engrossed more and more of his thought and his time; and he
listened with unfailing good-nature and patience to the perpetual talk of his friend about
Sheila and her home, and the future that might be in store for both of them. If he had accepted
half the invitations to dinner sent down to him at the Board of Trade by his friend, he would
scarcely ever have been out of Lavender's club. Many a long evening they passed in this way--either
in Lavender's rooms in King street or in Ingram's lodgings in Sloane street. Ingram quite consented
to lie in a chair and smoke, sometimes putting in a word of caution to bring Lavender back
from the romantic Sheila to the real Sheila, sometimes smiling at some wild proposal or statement
on the part of his friend, but always glad to see that the pretty idealisms planted during
their stay in the far North were in no danger of dying out down here in the South. Those were
great days, too, when a letter arrived from Sheila. Nothing had been said about their corresponding,
but Lavender had written shortly after his arrival in London, and Sheila had answered for her
father and herself. It wanted but a very little amount of ingenuity to continue the interchange
of letters thus begun; and when the well-known envelope arrived high holiday was immediately
proclaimed by the recipient of it. He did not show Ingram these letters, of course, but the
contents of them were soon bit by bit revealed. He was also permitted to see the envelope,
as if Sheila's handwriting had some magical charm about it. Sometimes, indeed, Ingram had himself
a letter from Sheila, and that was immediately shown to Lavender. Was he pleased to find that
these communications were excessively business-like--describing how the fishing was going on,
what was doing in the schools, and how John the Piper was conducting himself, with talk about
the projected telegraphic cable, the shooting in Harris, the health of Bras, and other esoteric
matters?

Lavender's communications with the King of Borva were of a different nature. Wonderful volumes
on building, agriculture and what not, tobacco hailing from certain royal sources in the neighborhood
of the Pyramids, and now and again a new sort of rifle or some fresh invention in fishing-tackle,--these
were the sort of things that found their way to Lewis. And then in reply came haunches of venison,
and kegs of rare whisky, and skins of wild animals, which, all very admirable in their way,
were a trifle cumbersome in a couple of moderate rooms in King street, St. James's. But here
Lavender hit upon a happy device. He had long ago talked to his aunt of the mysterious potentate
in the far North, who was the ruler of man, beast and fish, and who had an only daughter. When
these presents arrived, Mrs. Lavender was informed that they were meant for her, and was given
to understand that they were the propitiatory gifts of a half-savage monarch who wished to
seek her friendship. In vain did Ingram warn Lavender of the possible danger of this foolish
joke. The young man laughed, and would come down to Sloane street with another story of his
success as an envoy of the distant king.

And so the months went slowly by, and Lavender raved about Sheila, and dreamed about Sheila,
and was always going to begin some splendid achievement for Sheila's sake, but never just managed
to begin. After all, the future did not look very terrible, and the present was satisfactory
enough. Mrs. Lavender had no objection whatever to listening to his praises of Sheila, and
had even gone the length of approving of the girl's photograph when it was shown her. But at
the end of six months Lavender suddenly went down to Sloane street, found Ingram in his lodgings,
and said, "Ingram, I start for Lewis to-morrow."

"The more fool you!" was the complacent reply.

"I can't bear this any longer: I must go and see her."

"You'll have to bear worse if you go. You don't know what getting to Lewis is in the winter.
You'll be killed with cold before you see the Minch."

"I can stand a good bit of cold when there's a reason for it," said the young man; "and I have
written to Sheila to say I should start to-morrow."

"In that case I had better make use of you. I suppose you won't mind taking up to Sheila a
sealskin jacket that I have bought for her."

"That you have bought for her!" said the other.

How could he have spared fifteen pounds out of his narrow income for such a present? And yet
he laughed at the idea of his ever having been in love with Sheila.

Lavender took the sealskin jacket with him, and started on his journey to the North. It was
certainly all that Ingram had prophesied in the way of discomfort, hardship and delay. But
one forenoon, Lavender, coming up from the cabin of the steamer into which he had descended
to escape from the bitter wind and the sleet, saw before him a strange thing. In the middle
of the black sea and under a dark gray sky lay a long wonder-land of gleaming snow. Far as
the eye could see the successive headlands of pale white jutted out into the dark ocean, until
in the south they faded into a gray mist and became invisible. And when they got into Stornoway
harbor, how black seemed the waters of the little bay and the hulls of the boats and the windows
of the houses against the blinding white of the encircling hills!

"Yes," said Lavender to the captain, "it will be a cold drive across to Loch Roag. I shall
give Mackenzie's man a good dram before we start."

But it was not Mackenzie's notion of hospitality to send Duncan to meet an honored guest, and
ere the vessel was fast moored Lavender had caught sight of the well-known pair of horses and
the brown wagonette, and Mackenzie stamping up and down in the trampled snow. And this figure
close down to the edge of the quay? Surely, there was something about the thick gray shawl,
the white feather, the set of the head, that he knew!

"Why, Sheila!" he cried, jumping ashore before the gangway was shoved across, "whatever made
you come to Stornoway on such a day?"

"And it is not much my coming to Stornoway if you will come all the way from England to the
Lewis," said Sheila, looking up with her bright and glad eyes.

For six months he had been trying to recall the tones of her voice in looking at her picture,
and had failed: now he fancied that she spoke more sweetly and musically than ever.

"Ay, ay," said Mackenzie when he had shaken hands with the young man, "it wass a piece of foolishness,
her coming over to meet you in Styornoway; but the girl will be neither to hold nor to bind
when she teks a foolishness into her head."

"Is this the character I hear of you, Sheila?" he said; and Mackenzie laughed at his daughter's
embarrassment, and said she was a good lass for all that, and bundled both the young folks
into the inn, where luncheon had been provided, with a blazing fire in the room, and a kettle
of hot water steaming beside it.

When they got to Borva, Lavender began to see that Mackenzie had laid the most subtle plans
for reconciling him to the hard weather of these northern winters; and the young man, nothing
loath, fell into his ways, and was astonished at the amusement and interest that could be got
out of a residence in this bleak island at such a season. Mackenzie discarded at once the feeble
protections against cold and wet which his guest had brought with him. He gave him a pair of
his own knickerbockers and enormous boots; he made him wear a frieze coat borrowed from Duncan;
he insisted on his turning down the flap of a sealskin cap and tying the ends under his chin;
and thus equipped they started on many a rare expedition round the coast. But on their first
going out, Mackenzie, looking at him, said with some chagrin, "Will they wear gloves when they
go shooting in your country?"

"Oh," said Lavender, "these are only a pair of old dogskins I use chiefly to keep my hands
clean. You see I have cut out the trigger-finger. And they keep your hands from being numbed,
you know, with the cold or the rain."

"There will be not much need of that after a little while," said Mackenzie; and indeed, after
half an hour's tramping over snow and climbing over rocks, Lavender was well inclined to please
the old man by tossing the gloves into the sea, for his hands were burning with heat.

Then the pleasant evenings after all the fatigues of the day were over, clothes changed, dinner
despatched, and Sheila at the open piano in that warm little drawing-room, with its strange
shells and fish and birds!

There was no winter at all in the snug little room, with its crimson fire and closed shutters
and songs of happier times. "When the rosy morn appearing" had nothing inappropriate in it;
and if they particularly studied the words of "Oh wert thou in the cauld blast," it was only
that Sheila might teach her companion the Scotch pronunciation, as far as she knew it. And
once, half in joke, Lavender said he could believe it was summer again if Sheila had only on
her slate-gray silk dress, with the red ribbon round her neck; and sure enough, after dinner
she came down in that dress, and Lavender took her hand and kissed it in gratitude. Just at
that moment, too, Mackenzie began to swear at Duncan for not having brought him his pipe, and
not only went out of the room to look for it, but was a full half hour in finding it. When
he came in again he was singing carelessly,

  Love in thine eyes for ever plays,

just as if he had got his pipe round the corner.

For it had been all explained by this time, you know, and Sheila had in a couple of trembling
words pledged away her life, and her father had given his consent. More than that he would
have done for the girl, if need were; and when he saw the perfect happiness shining in her
eyes--when he saw that, through some vague feelings of compunction or gratitude, or even exuberant
joy, she was more than usually affectionate toward himself--he grew reconciled to the ways
of Providence, and was ready to believe that Ingram had done them all a good turn in bringing
his friend from the South with him. If there was any haunting fear at all, it was about the
possibility of Sheila's husband refusing to live in Stornoway, even for half the year or a
portion of the year; but did not the young man express himself as delighted beyond measure
with Lewis and the Lewis people, and the sports and scenery and climate of the island? If Mackenzie
could have bought fine weather at twenty pounds a day, Lavender would have gone back to London
with the conviction that there was only one thing better than Lewis in summer-time, and that
was Lewis in time of snow and frost.

The blow fell. One evening a distinct thaw set in, during the night the wind went round to
the south-west, and in the morning, lo! the very desolation of desolation. Suainabhal, Mealasabhal,
Cracabhal were all hidden away behind dreary folds of mist; a slow and steady rain poured down
from the lowering skies on the wet rocks, the marshy pasture-land and the leafless bushes;
the Atlantic lay dark under a gray fog, and you could scarcely see across the loch in front
of the house. Sometimes the wind freshened a bit, and howled about the house or dashed showers
against the streaming panes; but ordinarily there was no sound but the ceaseless hissing of
the rain on the wet gravel at the door and the rush of the waves along the black rocks. All
signs of life seemed to have fled from the earth and the sky. Bird and beast had alike taken
shelter, and not even a gull or a sea-pye crossed the melancholy lines of moorland, which were
half obscured by the mist of the rain.

"Well, it can't be fine weather always," said Lavender cheerfully when Mackenzie was affecting
to be greatly surprised to find such a thing as rain in the island of Lewis.

"No, that iss quite true," said the old man. "It wass ferry good weather we were having since
you hef come here. And what iss a little rain?--oh, nothing at all. You will see it will go
away whenever the wind goes round."

With that Mackenzie would again go out to the front of the house, take a turn up and down the
wet gravel, and pretend to be scanning the horizon for signs of a change. Sheila, a good deal
more honest, went about her household duties, saying merely to Lavender, "I am very sorry the
weather has broken, but it may clear before you go away from Borva."

"Before I go? Do you expect it to rain for a week?"

"Perhaps it will not, but it is looking very bad to-day," said Sheila.

"Well, I don't care," said the young man, "though it should rain the skies down, if only you
would keep in-doors, Sheila. But you do go out in such a reckless fashion. You don't seem to
reflect that it is raining."

"I do not get wet," she said.

"Why, when you came up from the shore half an hour ago your hair was as wet as possible, and
your face all red and gleaming with the rain."

"But I am none the worse. And I am not wet now. It is impossible that you will always keep
in a room if you have things to do; and a little rain does not hurt any one."

"It occurs to me, Sheila," he observed slowly, "that you are an exceedingly obstinate and self-willed
young person, and that no one has ever exercised any proper control over you."

She looked up for a moment with a sudden glance of surprise and pain: then she saw in his eyes
that he meant nothing, and she went forward to him, putting her hand in his hand, and saying
with a smile, "I am very willing to be controlled."

"Are you really?"

"Yes."

"Then hear my commands. You shall not go out in time of rain without putting something over
your head or taking an umbrella. You shall not go out in the Maighdean-mhara without taking
some one with you besides Mairi. You shall never, if you are away from home, go within fifty
yards of the sea, so long as there is snow on the rocks."

"But that is so very many things already: is it not enough?" said Sheila.

"You will faithfully remember and observe these rules?"

"I will."

"Then you are a more obedient girl than I imagined or expected; and you may now, if you are
good, have the satisfaction of offering me a glass of sherry and a biscuit, for, rain or no
rain, Lewis is a dreadful place for making people hungry."

Mackenzie need not have been afraid. Strange as it may appear, Lavender was well content with
the wet weather. No depression or impatience or remonstrance was visible on his face when he
went to the blurred windows, day after day, to see only the same desolate picture--the dark
sea, the wet rocks, the gray mists over the moorland and the shining of the red gravel before
the house. He would stand with his hands in his pocket and whistle "Love in thine eyes for
ever plays," just as if he were looking out on a cheerful summer sunrise. When he and Sheila
went to the door, and were received by a cold blast of wet wind and a driving shower of rain,
he would slam the door to again with a laugh, and pull the girl back into the house. Sometimes
she would not be controlled; and then he would accompany her about the garden as she attended
to her duties, or would go down to the shore with her to give Bras a run. From these excursions
he returned in the best of spirits, with a fine color in his face; until, having got accustomed
to heavy boots, impervious frieze and the discomfort of wet hands, he grew to be about as indifferent
to the rain as Sheila herself, and went fishing or shooting or boating with much content, whether
it was wet or dry.

"It has been the happiest month of my life--I know that," he said to Mackenzie as they stood
together on the quay at Stornoway.

"And I hope you will hef many like it in the Lewis," said the old man cheerfully.

"I think I should soon learn to become a Highlander up here," said Lavender, "if Sheila would
only teach me the Gaelic."

"The Gaelic!" cried Mackenzie impatiently. "The Gaelic! It is none of the gentlemen who will
come here in the autumn will want the Gaelic; and what for would you want the Gaelic--ay, if
you was staying here the whole year round?"

"But Sheila will teach me all the same--won't you, Sheila?" he said, turning to his companion,
who was gazing somewhat blankly at the rough steamer and at the rough gray sea beyond the harbor.

"Yes," said the girl: she seemed in no mood for joking.
