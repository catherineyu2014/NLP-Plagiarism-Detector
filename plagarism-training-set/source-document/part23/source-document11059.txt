And now came one of those rare historic days in the history of exploration. It was 17th June
1896. Nansen was surveying the lonely line of coast, when suddenly the barking of a dog fell
on his ear, and soon in front he saw the fresh tracks of some animal. "It was with a strange
mixture of feelings," he says, "that I made my way among the numerous hummocks towards land.
Suddenly I thought I heard a human voice--the first for three years. How my heart beat and
the blood rushed to my brain as I halloed with all the strength of my lungs. Soon I heard another
shout and saw a dark form moving among the hummocks. It was a man. We approached one another
quickly. I waved my hat; he did the same. As I drew nearer I thought I recognised Mr. Jackson,
whom I remembered once to have seen. I raised my hat; we extended a hand to one another with
a hearty 'How do you do?' Above us a roof of mist, beneath our feet the rugged packed drift ice."

"Ar'n't you Nansen?" he said.

"Yes, I am," was the answer.

And, seizing the grimy hand of the Arctic explorer, he shook it warmly, congratulating him
on his successful trip. Jackson and his companions had wintered at Cape Flora, the southern
point of Franz Josef Land, and they were expecting a ship, the Windward, to take them home.
On 26th July the Windward steamed slowly in, and by 13th August she reached Norway, and the
news of Nansen's safe arrival was made known to the whole world. A week later the little Fram,
"strong and broad and weather-beaten," also returned in safety. And on 9th September 1896,
Nansen and his brave companions on board the Fram sailed up Christiania Fjiord in triumph.

He had reached a point farthest North, and been nearer to the North Pole than had any explorer
before.

CHAPTER LXXII

PEARY REACHES THE NORTH POLE

The 6th April 1909 is a marked day in the annals of exploration, for on that day Peary succeeded
in reaching the North Pole, which for centuries had defied the efforts of man; on that day
he attained the goal for which the greatest nations of the world had struggled for over four
hundred years. Indeed, he had spent twenty-three years of his own life labouring toward this end.

He was mainly inspired by reading Nordenskiold's Exploration of Greenland, when a lieutenant
in the United States Navy. In 1886 he got leave to join an expedition to Greenland, and returned
with the Arctic fever in his veins and a scheme for crossing that continent as far north as
possible. This after many hardships he accomplished, being the first explorer to discover that
Greenland was an island. Peary was now stamped as a successful Arctic explorer. The idea of
reaching the North Pole began to take shape, and in order to raise funds the enthusiastic explorer
delivered no less than one hundred and sixty-eight lectures in ninety-six days. With the proceeds
he chartered the Falcon and left the shores of Philadelphia in June 1893 for Greenland. His
wife, who accompanied him before, accompanied him again, and with sledges and dogs on board
they made their way up the western coast of Greenland. Arrived at Melville Bay, Peary built
a little hut; here a little daughter was born who was soon "bundled in soft warm Arctic furs
and wrapped in the Stars and Stripes." No European child had ever been born so far north as
this; the Eskimos travelled from long distances to satisfy themselves she was not made of snow,
and for the first six months of her life the baby lived in continuous lamplight.

But we cannot follow Peary through his many Polar expeditions; his toes had been frozen off
in one, his leg broken in another, but he was enthusiastic enough when all preparations were
complete for the last and greatest expedition of all.

The Roosevelt, named after the President of the United States, had carried him safely to the
north of Greenland in his last expedition, so she was again chosen, and in July 1908, Peary
hoisted the Stars and Stripes and steamed from New York.

"As the ship backed out into the river, a cheer went up from the thousands who had gathered
on the piers to see us off. It was an interesting coincidence that the day on which we started
for the coldest spot on earth was about the hottest which New York had known for years. As
we steamed up the river, the din grew louder and louder; we passed President Roosevelt's naval
yacht, the Mayflower, and her small gun roared out a parting salute--surely no ship ever started
for the ends of the earth with more heart-stirring farewells."

President Roosevelt had himself inspected the ship and shaken hands with each member of the
expedition.

"I believe in you, Peary," he had said, "and I believe in your success, if it is within the
possibility of man." So the little Roosevelt steamed away; on 26th July the Arctic Circle was
crossed by Peary for the twentieth time, and on 1st August, Cape York, the most northerly home
of human beings in the world, was reached. This was the dividing line between the civilised
world on one hand and the Arctic world on the other. Picking up several Eskimo families and
about two hundred and fifty dogs, they steamed on northwards.

"Imagine," says Peary--"imagine about three hundred and fifty miles of almost solid ice, ice
of all shapes and sizes, mountainous ice, flat ice, ragged and tortured ice; then imagine a
little black ship, solid, sturdy, compact, strong, and resistant, and on this little ship are
sixty-nine human beings, who have gone out into the crazy, ice-tortured channel between Baffin
Bay and the Polar sea--gone out to prove the reality of a dream in the pursuit of which men
have frozen and starved and died."

The usual course was taken, across Smith's Sound and past the desolate wind-swept rocks of
Cape Sabine, where, in 1884, Greely's ill-fated party slowly starved to death, only seven surviving
out of twenty-four.

Fog and ice now beset the ship, and on 5th September they were compelled to seek winter quarters,
for which they chose Cape Sheridan, where Peary had wintered before in 1905. Here they unloaded
the Roosevelt, and two hundred and forty-six Eskimo dogs were at once let loose to run about
in the snow. A little village soon grew up, and the Eskimos, both men and women, went hunting
as of yore. Peary had decided to start as before from Cape Columbia, some ninety miles away,
the most northerly point of Grant Land, for his dash to the Pole.

On 12th October the sun disappeared and they entered cheerfully into the "Great Dark."

"Imagine us in our winter home," says Peary, "four hundred and fifty miles from the North Pole,
the ship held tight in her icy berth one hundred and fifty yards from the shore, ship and the
surrounding world covered with snow, the wind creaking in the rigging, whistling and shrieking
around the corners of the deck houses, the temperature ranging from zero to sixty below, the
icepack in the channel outside us groaning and complaining with the movement of the tides."

Christmas passed with its usual festivities. There were races for the Eskimos, one for the
children, one for the men, and one for the Eskimo mothers, who carried babies in their fur
hoods. These last, looking like "animated walruses," took their race at a walking pace.

At last, on 15th February 1909, the first sledge-party left the ship for Cape Columbia, and
a week later Peary himself left the Roosevelt with the last loads. The party assembled at Cape
Columbia for the great journey north, which consisted of seven men of Peary's party, fifty-nine
Eskimos, one hundred and forty dogs, and twenty-eight sledges. Each sledge was complete in
itself; each had its cooking utensils, its four men, its dogs and provisions for fifty or sixty
days. The weather was "clear, calm, and cold."

On 1st March the cavalcade started off from Cape Columbia in a freezing east wind, and soon
men and dogs became invisible amid drifting snow. Day by day they went forward, undaunted by
the difficulties and hardships of the way, now sending back small parties to the depot at Cape
Columbia, now dispatching to the home camp some reluctant explorer with a frostbitten heel
or foot, now delayed by open water, but on, on, till they had broken all records, passed all
tracks even of the Polar bear, passed the 87th parallel into the region of perpetual daylight
for half the year. It was here, apparently within reach of his goal, that Peary had to turn
back three years before for want of food.

Thus they marched for a month; party after party had been sent back, till the last supporting
party had gone and Peary was left with his black servant, Henson, and four Eskimos. He had
five sledges, forty picked dogs, and supplies for forty days when he started off alone to dash
the last hundred and thirty-three miles to the Pole itself. Every event in the next week is
of thrilling interest. After a few hours of sleep the little party started off shortly after
midnight on 2nd April 1909. Peary was leading.

"I felt the keenest exhilaration as I climbed over the ridge and breasted the keen air sweeping
over the mighty ice, pure and straight from the Pole itself."

They might yet be stopped by open water from reaching the goal. On they went, twenty-five miles
in ten hours, then a little sleep, and so on again, then a few hours' rest and another twenty
miles till they had reached latitude 89 degrees.

Still breathlessly they hurried forward, till on the 5th they were but thirty-five miles from
the Pole.

"The sky overhead was a colourless pall, gradually deepening to almost black at the horizon,
and the ice was a ghastly and chalky white."

On 6th April the Pole was reached.

"The Pole at last!" writes Peary in his diary. "The prize of three centuries! My dream and
goal for twenty years. Mine at last! I cannot bring myself to realise it. It all seems so simple
and commonplace."

Flags were at once hoisted on ice lances, and the successful explorer watched them proudly
waving in the bright Arctic sunlight at the Pole. Through all his perilous expeditions to the
Arctic regions, Peary had worn a silken flag, worked by his wife, wrapped round his body. He
now flew it on this historic spot, "which knows no North, nor West, nor East."

Not a vestige of land was to be seen; nothing but ice lay all around. They could not stay long,
for provisions would run short, and the ice might melt before their return journey was accomplished.

So after a brief rest they started off for Cape Columbia, which they reached after a wild rush
of sixteen days. It had taken them thirty-seven days to cover the four hundred and seventy-five
miles from Cape Columbia to the Pole, from which they had returned at the rate of thirty miles
a day.

The whole party then started for the Roosevelt, and on 18th July she was taken from her winter
quarters and turned towards home. Then came the day when wireless telegraphy flashed the news
through the whole of the civilised world: "Stars and Stripes nailed to the North Pole."

The record of four hundred years of splendid self-sacrifice and heroism unrivalled in the history
of exploration had been crowned at last.

CHAPTER LXXIII

THE QUEST FOR THE SOUTH POLE

An American had placed the Stars and Stripes on the North Pole in 1909. It was a Norwegian
who succeeded in reaching the South Pole in 1911. But the spade-work which contributed so largely
to the final success had been done so enthusiastically by two Englishmen that the expeditions
of Scott and Shackleton must find a place here before we conclude this Book of Discovery with
Amundsen's final and brilliant dash.

The crossing of the Antarctic Circle by the famous Challenger expedition in 1874 revived interest
in the far South. The practical outcome of much discussion was the design of the Discovery,
a ship built expressly for scientific exploration, and the appointment of Captain Scott to
command an Antarctic expedition.

In August 1901, Scott left the shores of England, and by way of New Zealand crossed the Antarctic
Circle on 3rd January 1902. Three weeks later he reached the Great Ice Barrier which had stopped
Ross in 1840. For a week Scott steamed along the Barrier. Mounts Erebus and Terror were plainly
visible, and though he could nowhere discover Parry Mountains, yet he found distant land rising
high above the sea, which he named King Edward VII.'s Land. Scott had brought with him a captive
balloon in which he now rose to a height of eight hundred feet, from which he saw an unbroken
glacier stream of vast extent stretching to the south. It was now time to seek for winter quarters,
and Scott, returning to McMurdo Bay named by Ross, found that it was not a bay at all, but
a strait leading southward. Here they landed their stores, set up their hut, and spent the
winter, till on 2nd November 1902 all was ready for a sledge-journey to the south. For fifty-nine
days Scott led his little land-party of three, with four sledges and nineteen dogs, south.
But the heavy snow was too much for the dogs, and one by one died, until not one was left and
the men had to drag and push the sledges themselves. Failing provisions at last compelled them
to stop. Great mountain summits were seen beyond the farthest point reached.

"We have decided at last we have found something which is fitting to bear the name of him whom
we most delight to honour," says Scott, "and Mount Markham it shall be called in memory of
the father of the expedition."

It was 30th December when a tremendous blizzard stayed their last advance. "Chill and hungry,"
they lay all day in their sleeping-bags, miserable at the thought of turning back, too weak
and ill to go on. With only provisions for a fortnight, they at last reluctantly turned home,
staggering as far as their depot in thirteen days. Shackleton was smitten with scurvy; he was
growing worse every day, and it was a relief when on 2nd February they all reached the ship
alive, "as near spent as three persons can well be." But they had done well: they had made
the first long land journey ever made in the Antarctic; they had reached a point which was
farthest south; they had tested new methods of travel; they had covered nine hundred and sixty
miles in ninety-three days. Shackleton was now invalided home, but it was not till 1904 that
the Discovery escaped from the frozen harbour to make her way home.

Shackleton had returned to England in 1903, but the mysterious South Pole amid its wastes of
ice and snow still called him back, and in command of the Nimrod he started forth in August
1907 on the next British Antarctic expedition, carrying a Union Jack, presented by the Queen,
to plant on the spot farthest south. He actually placed it within ninety-seven miles of the
Pole itself!

With a petrol motor-car on board, Eskimo dogs, and Manchurian ponies, he left New Zealand on
1st January 1908, watched and cheered by some thirty thousand of his fellow-countrymen. Three
weeks later they were in sight of the Great Ice Barrier, and a few days later the huge mountains
of Erebus and Terror came into sight. Shackleton had hoped to reach King Edward VII.'s Land
for winter quarters, but a formidable ice-pack prevented this, and they selected a place some
twenty miles north of the Discovery's old winter quarters. Getting the wild little Manchurian
ponies ashore was no light job; the poor little creatures were stiff after a month's constant
buffeting, for the Nimrod's passage had been stormy. One after another they were now led out
of their stalls into a horse-box and slung over the ice. Once on terra firma they seemed more
at home, for they immediately began pawing the snow as they were wont to do in their far-away
Manchurian home.

The spacious hut, brought out by Shackleton, was soon erected. Never was such a luxurious house
set up on the bleak shores of the Polar seas. There was a dark room for developing, acetylene
gas for lighting, a good stove for warming, and comfortable cubicles decorated with pictures.
The dark room was excellent, and never was a book of travels more beautifully illustrated than
Shackleton's Heart of the Antarctic.

True, during some of the winter storms and blizzards the hut shook and trembled so that every
moment its occupants thought it would be carried bodily away, but it stood its ground all right.
The long winter was spent as usual in preparing for the spring expedition to the south, but
it was 29th October 1908 before the weather made it possible to make a start. The party consisted
of Shackleton, Adams, Marshall, and Wild, each leading a pony which dragged a sledge with food
for ninety-one days.

"A glorious day for our start," wrote Shackleton in his diary, "brilliant sunshine and a cloudless
sky. As we left the hut where we had spent so many months in comfort we had a feeling of real
regret that never again would we all be together there. A clasp of the hands means more than
many words, and as we turned to acknowledge the men's cheer, and saw them standing on the ice
by the familiar cliffs, I felt we must try to do well for the sake of every one concerned in
the expedition."

New land in the shape of ice-clad mountains greeted the explorers on 22nd November. "It is
a wonderful place we are in, all new to the world," says Shackleton; "there is an impression
of limitless solitude about it that makes us feel so small as we trudge along, a few dark specks
on the snowy plain."

They now had to quit the Barrier in order to travel south. Fortunately they found a gap, called
the Southern Gateway, which afforded a direct line to the Pole. But their ponies had suffered
badly during the march; they had already been obliged to shoot three of them, and on 7th December
the last pony fell down a crevasse and was killed. They had now reached a great plateau some
seven thousand feet above the sea; it rose steadily toward the south, and Christmas Day found
them "lying in a little tent, isolated high on the roof of the world, far from the ways trodden
by man." With forty-eight degrees of frost, drifting snow, and a biting wind, they spent the
next few days hauling their sledges up a steep incline. They had now only a month's food left.
Pressing on with reduced rations, in the face of freezing winds, they reached a height of ten
thousand and fifty feet.

It was the 6th of January, and they were in latitude 88 degrees, when a "blinding, shrieking
blizzard" made all further advance impossible. For sixty hours the four hungry explorers lay
in their sleeping-bags, nearly perished with cold. "The most trying day we have yet spent,"
writes Shackleton, "our fingers and faces being continually frostbitten. To-morrow we will
rush south with the flag. It is our last outward march."

The gale breaking, they marched on till 9th January, when they stopped within ninety-seven
miles of the Pole, where they hoisted the Union Jack, and took possession of the great plateau
in the King's name.

"We could see nothing but the dead-white snow plain. There was no break in the plateau as it
extended towards the Pole. I am confident that the Pole lies on the great plateau we have discovered
miles and miles from any outstanding land."

And so the four men turned homewards. "Whatever our regret may be, we have done our best,"
said the leader somewhat sadly. Blinding blizzards followed them as they made their way slowly
back. On 28th January they reached the Great Ice Barrier. Their food was well-nigh spent; their
daily rations consisted of six biscuits and some horse-meat in the shape of the Manchurian
ponies they had shot and left the November before. But it disagreed with most of them, and
it was four very weak and ailing men who staggered back to the Nimrod toward the end of February
1909.

Shackleton reached England in the autumn of 1909 to find that another Antarctic expedition
was to leave our shores in the following summer under the command of Scott, in the Terra Nova.
It was one of the best-equipped expeditions that ever started; motor-sledges had been specially
constructed to go over the deep snow, which was fatal to the motor-car carried by Shackleton.
There were fifteen ponies and thirty dogs. Leaving England in July 1910, Scott was established
in winter quarters in McMurdo Sound by 26th January 1911. It was November before he could start
on the southern expedition.

"We left Hut Point on the evening of 2nd November. For sixty miles we followed the track of
the motors (sent on five days before). The ponies are going very steadily. We found the motor
party awaiting us in latitude 80-1/2 degrees south. The motors had proved entirely satisfactory,
and the machines dragged heavy loads over the worst part of the Barrier surface, crossing several
crevasses. The sole cause of abandonment was the overheating of the air-cooled engines. We
are building snow cairns at intervals of four miles to guide homeward parties and leaving a
week's provisions at every degree of latitude. As we proceeded the weather grew worse, and
snowstorms were frequent. The sky was continually overcast, and the land was rarely visible.
The ponies, however, continued to pull splendidly."

As they proceeded south they encountered terrific storms of wind and snow, out of which they
had constantly to dig the ponies. Christmas passed and the New Year of 1912 dawned. On 3rd
January when one hundred and fifty miles from the Pole, "I am going forward," says Scott, "with
a party of five men with a month's provisions, and the prospect of success seems good, provided
that the weather holds and no unforeseen obstacles arise."

Scott and his companions successfully attained the object of their journey. They reached the
South Pole on 17th January only to find that they had been forestalled by others! And it is
remarkable to note that so correct were their observations, the two parties located the Pole
within half a mile of one another.

Scott's return journey ended disastrously. Blinding blizzards prevented rapid progress; food
and fuel ran short; still the weakened men struggled bravely forward till, within a few miles
of a depot of supplies, death overtook them.

Scott's last message can never be forgotten.

It was on 14th December 1911 that Captain Amundsen had reached the Pole. A Norwegian, fired
by the example of his fellow-countryman, Nansen, Amundsen had long been interested in both
Arctic and Antarctic exploration. In a ship of only forty-eight tons, he had, with six others,
made a survey of the North Magnetic Pole, sailed through the Behring Strait, and accomplished
the North-West Passage, for which he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Geographical
Society. On his return he planned an expedition to the North Pole. He had made known his scheme,
and, duly equipped for North Polar expedition in Nansen's little Fram, Amundsen started. Suddenly
the world rang with the news that Peary had discovered the North Pole, and that Amundsen had
turned his prow southwards and was determined to make a dash for the South Pole. Landing in
Whales Bay some four hundred miles to the east of Scott's winter quarters, his first visitors
were the Englishmen on board the Terra Nova, who were taking their ship to New Zealand for
the winter.

Making a hut on the shore, Amundsen had actually started on his journey to the Pole before
Scott heard of his arrival.

"I am fully alive to the complication in the situation arising out of Amundsen's presence in
the Antarctic," wrote the English explorer, "but as any attempt at a race might have been fatal
to our chance of getting to the Pole at all, I decided to do exactly as I should have done
had not Amundsen been here. If he gets to the Pole he will be bound to do it rapidly with dogs,
and one foresees that success will justify him."

Although the Norwegian explorer left his winter quarters on 8th September for his dash to the
Pole, he started too early; three of his party had their feet frostbitten, and the dogs suffered
severely, so he turned back, and it was not till 20th October, just a week before Scott's start,
that he began in real earnest his historic journey. He was well off for food, for whales were
plentiful on the shores of the Bay, and seals, penguins, and gulls abounded. The expedition
was well equipped, with eight explorers, four sledges, and thirteen dogs attached to each.

"Amundsen is a splendid leader, supreme in organisation, and the essential in Antarctic travel
is to think out the difficulties before they arise." So said those who worked with him on his
most successful journey.

Through dense fog and blinding blizzards the Norwegians now made their way south, their Norwegian
skis and sledges proving a substantial help. The crevasses in the ice were very bad; one dog
dropped in and had to be abandoned; another day the dogs got across, but the sledge fell in,
and it was necessary to climb down the crevasse, unpack the sledge, and pull up piece by piece
till it was possible to raise the empty sledge. So intense was the cold that the very brandy
froze in the bottle and was served out in lumps.

"It did not taste much like brandy then," said the men, "but it burnt our throats as we sucked it."

The dogs travelled well. Each man was responsible for his own team; he fed them and made them
fond of him. Thus all through November the Norwegians travelled south, till they reached the
vast plateau described by Shackleton. One tremendous peak, fifteen thousand feet high, they
named "Frithjof Nansen."

On 14th December they reached their goal; the weather was beautiful, the ground perfect for
sledging.

"At 3 p.m. we made halt," says Amundsen. "According to our reckoning, we had reached our destination.
All of us gathered round the colours--a beautiful silken flag; all hands took hold of it, and,
planting it on the spot, we gave the vast plateau on which the Pole is situate the name of
'The King Haakon VII.' It was a vast plain, alike in all directions, mile after mile."

Here in brilliant sunshine the little party camped, taking observations till 17th December,
when, fastening to the ground a little tent with the Norwegian flag and the Fram pennant, they
gave it the name "Polheim" and started for home.

So the North and South Poles yielded up their well-hoarded secrets after centuries of waiting,
within two and a half years of one another.

They had claimed more lives than any exploration had done before, or is ever likely to do again.

And so ends the last of these great earth-stories--stories which have made the world what it
is to-day--and we may well say with one of the most successful explorers of our times, "The
future may give us thrilling stories of the conquest of the air, but the spirit of man has
mastered the earth."
