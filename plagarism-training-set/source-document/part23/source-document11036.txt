times, the assembly repeating the last line of the verse."--"How odd!" exclaims a common woman
alongside of Morellet, "how droll, passing all their time here, singing in that fashion! Is
that what they come here for?"--Not alone for that: after the circus-parade is over, the ordinary
haranguers, and especially the hair-dresser, come and propose measures for murder "in infuriate
language and with fiery gesticulation." Such are the good speakers[3349] and men for show.
The others, who remain silent, and hardly know to write, act and do the rough work. A certain
Chalaudon, member of the Commune,[3350] is one of this kind, president of the Revolutionary
Committee of the section of "L'Homme armé," and probably an excellent man-hunter; for "the
government committees assigned to him the duty of watching the right bank of the Seine, and,
with extraordinary powers conferred on him, he rules from his back shop one half of Paris.
Woe to those he has reason to complain of, those who have withdrawn from, or not given him,
their custom! Sovereign of his quarter up to Thermidor 10, his denunciations are death-warrants.
Some of the streets, especially that of Grand Chantier, he "depopulates." And this Marais exterminator
is a "cobbler," a colleague in leather, as well as in the Commune, of Simon the shoemaker,
the preceptor and murderer of the young Dauphin.
