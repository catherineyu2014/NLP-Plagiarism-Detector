     I live in a fort by the sea-shore. Our post takes HARPER'S WEEKLY,
     and I read the YOUNG PEOPLE, which comes with it. We have splendid
     boating and fishing. We catch cod-fish, mackerel, cunners, and
     lobsters. We catch the lobsters in nets. I have two pet pigeons,
     and two kittens exactly alike. Their names are Spunk and Pluck.
     Spunk will run up my knee when I hold out a piece of meat.

     I would like to know what to do with my parrot. He talks, sings,
     and whistles very nice, but he picks his feathers all out, and
     looks almost naked. I had a canary, but it died two years ago. It
     was almost twenty years old. Can any little boy or girl tell me
     what to do for my parrot?

H. L. MURRAY.--A big, strong Newfoundland dog will be the best to harness in your little carriage.
Newfoundland dogs are very wise and gentle, and, if treated kindly, are easily trained.

CHARLEY D. M.--The trouble with your fish probably comes from the want of air in the water.
If you will make a reed or elder-bush squirt-gun, closing the lower end, and making a number
of small holes near the bottom, you can use it for forcing air into the tank. This will make
the water "alive," and your fish will flourish. It will be well also to put two or three fresh-water
crabs and snails and a little vegetation into the tank.

T. H. KNOX.--An owl, or an owl's head, would make a good badge for your literary society. You
can buy very pretty owls' heads under glass, arranged to wear as a scarf-pin. They are not
expensive. Or if you wish something original, a small gold eagle's quill would be appropriate.

I. U.--Sheep have front teeth, or nippers, only on the lower jaw, the upper having instead
a firm fibrous pad. There are eight of these nippers in a full-grown sheep. There are six grinders,
or back teeth, on each side of both the upper and lower jaws.

EDITH J. P.--You will find information about gold-fish in YOUNG PEOPLE No. 6.

ZELLA T.--The origin of April-fools' Day is unknown. It is observed as a season of practical
jokes in nearly every country. Even the Hindoos have a festival terminating on the 31st of
March, during which they aim to send their friends on all manner of absurd errands, and enjoy
a laugh at their disappointment. In Italy and France the victims of practical jokes of the
1st of April are called "April-fish."

B. H. T.--If you wish to keep the skin of your greyhound very soft and delicate, feed it on
bread and milk, sugar, cake, crackers, and dainty food of any kind. It will eat meat fast enough,
if you allow it to do so, and a little beef, cut very fine, will make it stronger and do it
good. Always give it plenty of fresh water.

SADIE E. P.--The saw-fish (Pristis antiquorum) is most plentiful in tropical seas, although
a few species are found in the arctic regions. Its weapon is a flat prolongation of the head,
and has on either edge hard tooth-like projections. One species is found all along our coast,
from New England to Florida. It has no other common name.
