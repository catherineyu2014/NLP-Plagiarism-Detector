Yet, Muse of Shakspeare[1], whither wouldst thou fly, With hurried step, and dove-like trembling
eye? Thou, as from heav'n, that couldst each grace dispense, Fancy's rich stream, and all the
stores of sense; Give to each virtue face and form divine, Make dulness feel, and vulgar souls
refine, Wake all the passions into restless life, Now calm to softness, and now rouze to strife?

Sick of misjudging, that no sense can hit, Scar'd by the jargon of unmeaning wit, The senseless
splendour of the tawdry stage[2], The loud long plaudits of a trifling age, Where dost thou
wander? Exil'd in disgrace, Find'st thou in foreign realms some happier place[3]? Or dost thou
still though banish'd from the town, In Britain love to linger, though unknown? Light Hymen's
torch through ev'ry blooming grove,[4] And tinge each flow'ret with the blush of love? Sing
winter, summer-sweets, the vernal air, Or the soft Sofa, to delight the fair[5]? Laugh, e'en
at kings, and mock each prudish rule, The merry motley priest of ridicule[6]? With modest pencil
paint the vernal scene, The rustic lovers, and the village green? Bid Mem'ry, magic child,
resume his toy, And Hope's fond vot'ry seize the distant joy[7]?

Or dost thou soar, in youthful ardour strong, And bid some female hero live in song[8]? Teach
fancy how through nature's walks to stray, And wake, to simpler theme, the lyric lay[9]? Or
steal from beauty's lip th' ambrosial kiss, Paint the domestic grief, or social bliss[10]?
With patient step now tread o'er rock and hill, Gaze on rough ocean, track the babbling rill[11],
Then rapt in thought, with strong poetic eye, Read the great movement of the mighty sky?

Or wilt thou spread the light of Leo's age, And smooth, as woman's guide, Tansillo's page[12]?
Till pleas'd, you make in fair translated song, Odin descend, and rouse the fairy throng[13]?
Recall, employment sweet, thy youthful day, Then wake, at Mithra's call, the mystic lay[14]?
Unfold the Paradise of ancient lore[15], Or mark the shipwreck from the sounding shore? Now
love to linger in the daisied vale, Then rise sublime in legendary tale[16]? Or, faithful still
to nature's sober joy, Smile on the labours of some Farmer's Boy[17]? Or e'en regardless of
the poet's praise, Deck the fair magazine with blooming lays[18]? Oh! sweetest muse, oh, haste
thy wish'd return, See genius droop, and bright-ey'd fancy mourn, Recall to nature's charms
an English stage, The guard and glory of a nobler age.

[Footnote 1: It is not meant to say, that even Shakspeare followed invariably a correct and
chastized taste, or that he never purchased public applause by offering incense at the shrine
of public taste. Voltaire, in his Essays on Dramatic Poetry, has carried the matter too far;
but in many respects his reflections are unquestionably just. In delineating human characters
and passions, and in the display of the sublimer excellencies of poetry, Shakspeare was unrivalled.

There he our fancy of itself bereaving, Did make us marble with too much conceiving. MILTON'S
SONNET TO SHAKSPEARE.]

[Footnote 2: Pomp and splendour a poor substitute for genius.]

[Footnote 3: The dramatic muse seems of late years to have taken her residence in Germany.
Schiller, Kotzebue, and Goethe, possess great merit both for passion and sentiment, and the
English nation have done them justice. One or two principles which the French and English critics
had too implicitly followed from Aristotle, are indeed not adopted, but have been, I hope,
successfully, counteracted by these writers; yet are these dramatists characterised by a wildness
bordering on extravagance, attendant on a state of half-civilization. Schiller and Kotzebue,
amid some faults, possess great excellencies.
