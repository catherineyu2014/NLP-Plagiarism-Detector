The situation has appreciably improved, and the controversy has been narrowed down to the use
or omission of the word "illegality." The American Government insist that Germany should admit
the illegality of the torpedoing of the Lusitania, but for this Germany is not yet prepared,
though she is willing to make a formal expression of regret at the death of American citizens,
whom, she is ready to declare, she did not intend to destroy. Colonel ROOSEVELT spoke last
night at the dinner of the Associated Progressive Manufacturers. He said no touch of infancy
or feebleness had been omitted by the present Administration in their conduct of negotiations
with Germany. They had performed the miracle of causing every true American to blush for his
country. When you met a rattlesnake you didn't waste time in arguing with it or flattering
it. Your duty was to shoot it or knock it on the head, or, preferably, to employ both methods
in order to rid the world of a danger. At this vigorous denunciation the whole audience rose
and cheered for a quarter of an hour.

V.

The situation is easier. Count BERNSTORFF has declared in an interview that the German Government
is prepared to accept the American formula if the word "legality" be substituted for the word
"illegality." Germany would thus admit the legality of the torpedoing of the Lusitania and
express regret at the death of American citizens. Count BERNSTORFF points out that Germany
has thus gone very far towards meeting the American demand. He hopes and believes that two
great civilized nations will not fall out over so small a matter as the use or omission of
the two letters i, l, at the beginning of a long word.

VI.

Mr. LANSING has in a polite note expressed himself unable to accept Count BERNSTORFF'S offer
as a full satisfaction of America's demands. The sands are evidently running out, and there
is serious danger of the negotiations proving abortive. In the meantime a sharp Note has been
addressed to England in regard to her interference with American commerce. Six munition works
were yesterday blown up. The outrage is attributed to Germans. President WILSON is carefully
considering his action.

RAILWAY RHYMES.

  WHEN books are pow'rless to beguile
  And papers only stir my bile,
  For solace and relief I flee
  To Bradshaw or the A. B. C.,
  And find the best of recreations
  In studying the names of stations.

  There is not much among the A's
  To prompt enthusiastic praise,
  But B is infinitely better,
  And there are gems in ev'ry letter.
  The only fault I have with Barnack
  Is that it rhymes with Dr. HARNACK;
  Barbon, Beluncle Halt, Bodorgan
  Resound like chords upon the organ,
  And there's a spirit blithe and merry
  In Evercreech and Egloskerry.
  Park Drain and Counter Drain, I'm sure,
  Are hygienically pure,
  But when æsthetically viewed
  They seem to me a little crude.
  I often long to visit Frant,
  Hose, Little Kimble and Lelant;
  And, if I had sufficient dollars,
  Sibley's (for Chickney) and Neen Sollars;
  Shustoke and Smeeth my soul arride
  And likewise Sholing, Sole Street, Shide,
  But I'm afraid my speech might go
  Awry on reaching Spooner Row.

  In serious mood I often bend
  My thoughts to Ponder and his End,
  And when I'm feeling dull and down
  The very name of Tibshelf Town
  Rejoices me, while Par and Praze
  And Pylle and Quy promote amaze.

  Of all the Straths, a numerous host,
  Strathbungo pleases me the most,
  While I can court reluctant slumber
  By murmuring thy name, Stogumber.
  Were I beginning life anew
  From Swadlincote I'd take my cue,
  But shun as I would shun the scurvy
  The perilous atmosphere of Turvey.

  But though the tuneful name of Horbling
  Incites to further doggerel warbling,
  And Gallions, Goonbell, Gamlingay
  Are each deserving of a lay,
  No railway bard is worth his salt
  Who cannot bear to call a "Halt."

Still, it takes an exceptional man to have a step-mother at birth, fairy or other.

"CAROLINE."

A BABY, did he but know it, is only happy reaching out from the bath for the soap. When he
gets it, lo! it is mere froth and bitterness. That, roughly, is Mr. MAUGHAM'S idea in Caroline.
