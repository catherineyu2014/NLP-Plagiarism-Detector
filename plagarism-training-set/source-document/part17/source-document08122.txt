In preparing the report on the manufacture of paper from hemp hurds it became evident that
a short discussion of the agricultural aspects of this material should be included in the publication.
Such an article was prepared, therefore, and the two reports are here presented together.

[NOTE.--This bulletin should be useful to all persons who are interested in the economic phases
of paper making, especially to print and book paper manufacturers. It also should be of interest
to scientific investigators and chemists.]

=THE PRODUCTION AND HANDLING OF HEMP HURDS.=

By LYSTER H. DEWEY, Botanist in Charge of Fiber-Plant Investigations.

=WHAT HEMP HURDS ARE.=

The woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into pieces and separated from the fiber
in the processes of breaking and scutching, is called hemp hurds. These hurds correspond to
shives in flax, but are much coarser and are usually softer in texture.

The hemp stalk grown in a broadcast crop for fiber production is from one-eighth to three-eighths
of an inch in diameter and from 4 to 10 feet tall. The stalk is hollow, with a cylindrical
woody shell, thick near the base, where the stalk is nearly solid, and thinner above, where
the hollow is relatively wider.

In the process of breaking, the woody cylinder inside of the fiber-bearing bark is broken into
pieces one-half of an inch to 3 inches long and usually split into numerous segments. The thicker
lower sections are split less than the thin-shelled upper ones, and they are often left quite
solid.
