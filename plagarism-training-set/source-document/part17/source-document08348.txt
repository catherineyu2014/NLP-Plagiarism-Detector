CHAPTER XII.

THE SÁ LEONITE AT HOME AND ABROAD.

In treating this part of the subject I shall do my best to avoid bitterness and harsh judging
as far as the duty of a traveller--that of telling the whole truth--permits me. It is better
for both writer and reader to praise than to dispraise. Most Englishmen know negroes of pure
blood as well as 'coloured persons' who, at Oxford and elsewhere, have shown themselves fully
equal in intellect and capacity to the white races of Europe and America. These men afford
incontestable proofs that the negro can be civilised, and a high responsibility rests upon
them as the representatives of possible progress. But hitherto the African, as will presently
appear, has not had fair play. The petting and pampering process, the spirit of mawkish reparation,
and the coddling and high-strung sentimentality so deleterious to the tone of the colony, were
errors of English judgment pure and simple. We can easily explain them.

The sad grey life of England, the reflection of her climate, has ever welcomed a novelty, a
fresh excitement. Society has in turn lionised the marmiton, or assistant-cook, self-styled
an 'Emir of the Lebanon;' the Indian 'rajah,' at home a munshi, or language-master; and the
'African princess,' a slave-girl picked up in the bush. It is the same hunger for sensation
which makes the mob stare at the Giant and the Savage, the Fat Lady, the Living Skeleton, and
the Spotted Boy.

Before entering into details it will be necessary to notice the history of
the colony--an oft-told tale; yet nevertheless some parts will bear
repetition.
[Footnote: The following is its popular chronology:--
  1787. First settlers (numbering 460) sailed.
  1789. Town burnt by natives (1790?).
  1791. St. George's Bay Company founded.
  1792. Colonists (1,831) from Nova Scotia.
  1794. Colony plundered by the French.
  1800. Maroons (560) from Jamaica added.
  1808. Sá Leone ceded to the Crown; 'Cruits' introduced.
  1827. Direct government by the Crown.]
