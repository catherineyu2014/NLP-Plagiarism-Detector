OUR PROGRESS

Although very unwilling to encroach upon the enlarged space which we have this week afforded
to our numerous and increasing contributors, we may be permitted to refer to the fact of our
having felt it due to them to find such additional space by giving an extra half-sheet, as
a proof at once of the growing interest in our Journal, and of its extended utility.

We trust too that the step which we have thus taken will be received as a pledge of our intention
to meet all the requirements which may arise from our Journal becoming more generally known,
and consequently, as we are justified by our past experience in saying, being made greater
use of, as a medium of intercommunication between all classes of students and men of letters.

Our last and present Number furnish proofs of its utility in a way which when it was originally
projected could scarcely have been contemplated. We allude to its being made the channel through
which intending editors may announce the works on which they are engaged, and invite the co-operation
of their literary brethren. Nor is the readiness with which such co-operation is likely to
be afforded, the only good result to be obtained by such an announcement. For such an intimation
is calculated not only to prevent the unpleasantness likely to arise from a collision of interests--but
also to prevent a literary man either setting to himself an unprofitable task or wasting his
time and research upon ground which is already occupied.

One word more. When we commenced our labours we were warned by more than one friendly voice,
that, although we should probably find no lack of Queries, we should oftentimes be "straited
for a Reply." We undertook our task in faith and hope, determined to do our best to realize
the intentions we had proposed to ourselves, and encouraged by the feeling that if we did so
labour, our exertions would not be in vain, for--

  "What poor duty cannot do,
   Noble respect takes it in might not merit."

And the success with which our efforts have been crowned shows we were justified in so doing.
And so, gentle reader, to the banquet of dainty delights which is here spread before you!

CAPTIVITY OF THE QUEEN OF BRUCE IN ENGLAND.

I perceive, in one of the recent interesting communications made to the "NOTES AND QUERIES,"
by the Rev. Lambert B. Larking, that he has given, from a wardrobe roll in the Surrenden collection,
a couple of extracts, which show that Bruce's Queen was in 1314 in the custody of the Abbess
of Barking. To that gentleman our thanks are due for the selection of documents which had escaped
the careful researches of Lysons, and which at once throw light on the personal history of
a royal captive, and illustrate the annals of a venerable Abbey. I am glad to be able to answer
the concluding query as to the exact date when the unfortunate lady, (Bruce's second wife,)
left that Abbey, and to furnish a few additional particulars relative to her eight years' imprisonment
in England. History relates that in less than three months after the crown had been placed
upon the head of Bruce by the heroic Countess of Buchan, sister of the Earl of Fife (29th March,
1306), he was attacked and defeated at Methven, near Perth, by the English, under Aymer de
Valence, Earl of Pembroke. After this signal discomfiture, the king fled into the mountains,
accompanied by a few faithful followers: his Queen, daughter, and several other ladies, for
awhile shared his misfortunes and dangers; but they at length took refuge at the Castle of
Kildrummie, from whence they retreated, in the hope of greater security, to the sanctuary of
St. Duthae, at Tain, in Ross-shire. The Earl of Ross, it is said, violated the sanctuary, and
delivered the party up to the English, who (as sings Chaucer's contemporary, Barbour, in his
not very barbarous Scottish dialect) straightway proceeded to

  --"put the laydis in presoune,
  Sum in till castell, sum in dongeoun."

Among the captives were three ecclesiastics, who had taken a prominent part at the king's coronation--the
Bishops of Glasgow and St. Andrews and the Abbot of Scone, arrayed in most uncanonical costume.[1]
Peter Langtoft pathetically bewails their misfortune:--

   "The Bisshop of Saynt Andrew, and the Abbot of
      Scone,
    The Bisshop of Glascow, thise were taken sone;
    Fettred on hackneis, to Inlond ere thei sent,
    On sere stedis it seis, to prison mad present."

An instrument in Norman French, printed in Rymer's great collection (Foedera, vol. i. part
ii. p. 994, new ed.), directs the manner in which the prisoners were to be treated. As this
document is curious, I will give that portion which refers particularly to Bruce's wife, the
"Countess of Carrick:"--

    "A.D. 1306. (34 Edw. 1.) Fait a remembrer, qi, quant la Femme le
    Conte de Carrik sera venue au Roi, ele soit envee a Brustewik
    [on Humber], & qe ele eit tieu mesnee, & sa sustenance ordenee
    en la manere desouz escrite: cest asavoir,

    "Qe ele eit deux femmes du pays oversqe li; cest asaver, une
    damoisele & une femme por sa chambre, qi soient bien d'age &
    nyent gayes, & qi eles soient de bon & meur port; les queles
    soient entendantz, a li por li servir:

    "Et deux vadletz, qi soient ausint bien d'age, & avisez, de
    queux l'un soit un des vadletz le Conte de Ulvestier [the Earl
    of Ulster, her father], cest asaver Johan de Benteley, ou autre
    qil mettra en lieu de li, & l'autre acun du pays, qi soit por
    trencher devant li:

    "Et ausant eit ele un garzon a pee, por demorer en sa chambre,
    tiel qi soit sobre, & ne mie riotous, por son lit faire, & por
    autres choses qe covendront por sa chambre:

    "Et, estre ce, ordenez est qeele eit un Vadlet de mestier, qe
    soit de bon port, & avisez, por port ses cleifs, por panetrie, &
    botellerie, & un cu:

    "Et ele deit ausint aver trois leveriers, por aver son deduyt en
    la garrene illueques, & en les pares, quant ele voudra:

    "Et qe ele eit de la veneison, & du peisson es pescheries,
    selene ce qe master li sera:

    "Et qe ele gisse en la plus bele maison du manoir a sa volunte:
    Et, qe ele voit guyer es pares, r'aillois entor le manoir, a se
    volunte."

These orders are apparently not more severe than was necessary for the safe custody of the
Queen; and, considering the date of their issue, they seem to be lenient, considerate, and
indulgent. Not so, however, with the unfortunate Countess of Buchan, who was condemned to be
encaged in a turret of Berwick Castle ("en une kage de fort latiz, de fuist & barrez, & bien
efforcez de ferrement;" i.e. of strong lattice-work of wood, barred, and well strengthened
with iron[2]), where she remained immured seven years. Bruce's {291} daughter, Marjory, and
his sister Mary, were likewise to be encaged, the former in the Tower of London, the latter
in Roxburghe Castle. The young Earl of Mar, "L'enfant qi est heir de Mar," Bruce's nephew,
was to be sent to Bristol Castle, to be carefully guarded, "qil ne puisse eshcaper en nule
manere," but not to be fettered--"mais q'il soit hors de fers, tant come il est de si tendre age."

In 1308 (1 Edw. 2.), the Bailiff of Brustwick is commanded to deliver up his prisoner, to be
removed elsewhere, but to what place it does not appear. A writ of the 6th Feb. 1312, directs
her to be conveyed to Windsor Castle, "cum familia sua." In October of the same year, she was
removed to "Shaston" (Shaftesbury), and subsequently to the Abbey of Barking, where she remained
till March, 1314, when she was sent to Rochester Castle, as appears by the following writ (Rymer,
vol. ii. part i. p. 244.):--

    "(7 Edw. 2.) De ducendo Elizabetham uxorem Roberti de Brus,
    usque ad Castrum Rossense.

    "Mandatum est Vicecomitibus London quod Elizabetham. Uxorem
    Roberti de Brus, quæ cum Abbatissà de Berkyngg' stetit per
    aliquot tempus, de mandato Regis, ab cadem Abbatissà sine
    dilatione recipiant, eam usque Ross' duci sub salvâ custodia
    faciant, Henrico de Cobeham, Constabulario Castri Regis ibidem
    per Indenturam, indè faciendam inter ipsos, liberandam; et hoc
    nullatenus omittant.
