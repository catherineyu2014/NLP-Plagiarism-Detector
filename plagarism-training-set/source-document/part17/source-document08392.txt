The reason for this conclusion, more pregnant, it may be, than St. Thomas himself discerned,
is given briefly as follows (2a 2a, q. 57, art. 2, ad 1):

"Human nature is changeable; and therefore what is natural to man may sometimes fail to hold good."

The precepts of Natural Law that fail to be applicable when human nature sinks below par, are
only secondary precepts, and few even of them. Christianity brings human nature up to par,
and fulfils the Natural Law (St. Matt. v. 17), enjoining the observance of it in its integrity.
This is the meaning of St. John Chrysostom's saying: "Of old not such an ample measure of virtue
was proposed to us; ... but since the coming of Christ the way has been made much narrower."
(De Virginitate, c. 44: cf. his 17th Homily on St. Matt. v. 37; indeed the doctrine is familiar
in his pages.) Thus the prohibition of polygamy, being a secondary precept of the natural law,
failed in its application in that age of lapsed humanity, when a woman was better one of many
wives, protected by one husband, than exposed to promiscuous violence and lust. (Isaias iv. i.)

NOTE ON ROUSSEAU.

The ruler is the servant of the good of the people, not of the will of the people, except inasmuch
as--

a. the will of the people is an indication of their good, of which they are probable judges;

b. it is usually impossible to do good to the people against their steady will.
