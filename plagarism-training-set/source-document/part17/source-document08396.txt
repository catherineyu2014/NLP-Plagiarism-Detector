EPITAPH ON A GAMESTER.

  Here lies a gamester, poor but willing,
  Who left the room without a shilling.
  Losing each stake, till he had thrown
    His last, and lost the game to Death;
  If Paradise his soul has won,
    'Twas a rare stroke of luck i'faith!

       *       *       *       *       *
