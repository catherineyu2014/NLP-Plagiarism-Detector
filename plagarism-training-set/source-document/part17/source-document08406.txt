TO THE READER

The papers which form this autobiography were originally published in The Outlook, the chapter
telling of my going "home to mother" in The Churchman, and parts of one or two others in The
Century Magazine. To those who have been asking if they are made-up stories, let me say here
that they are not. And I am mighty glad they are not.  I would not have missed being in it
all for anything.

CHAPTER I

THE MEETING ON THE LONG BRIDGE

On the outskirts of the ancient town of Ribe, on the Danish north seacoast, a wooden bridge
spanned the Nibs River when I was a boy--a frail structure, with twin arches like the humps
of a dromedary, for boats to go under. Upon it my story begins. The bridge is long since gone.
The grass-grown lane that knew our romping feet leads nowhere now. But in my memory it is all
as it was that day nearly forty years ago, and it is always summer there. The bees are droning
among the forget-me-nots that grow along shore, and the swans arch their necks in the limpid
stream. The clatter of the mill-wheel down at the dam comes up with drowsy hum; the sweet smells
of meadow and field are in the air.  On the bridge a boy and a girl have met.

He whistles a tune, boy-fashion, with worsted jacket slung across his arm, on his way home
from the carpenter shop to his midday meal.  When she has passed he stands looking after her,
all the music gone out of him. At the other end of the bridge she turns with the feeling that
he is looking, and, when she sees that he is, goes on with a little toss of her pretty head.
As she stands one brief moment there with the roguish look, she is to stand in his heart forever--a
sweet girlish figure, in jacket of gray, black-embroidered, with schoolbooks and pretty bronzed
boots--

"With tassels!" says my wife, maliciously--she has been looking over my shoulder. Well, with
tassels! What then? Did I not worship a pair of boots with tassels which I passed in a shop
window in Copenhagen every day for a whole year, because they were the only other pair I ever
saw? I don't know--there may have been more; perhaps others wore them. I know she did. Curls
she had, too--curls of yellow gold. Why do girls not have curls these days? It is such a rare
thing to see them, that when you do you feel like walking behind them miles and miles just
to feast your eyes.  Too much bother, says my daughter. Bother?  Why, I have carried one of
your mother's, miss! all these--there, I shall not say how long--and carry it still. Bother?
Great Scott!

And is this going to be a love story, then?  Well, I have turned it over and over, and looked
at it from every angle, but if I am to tell the truth, as I promised, I don't see how it can
be helped. If I am to do that, I must begin at the Long Bridge.  I stepped on it that day a
boy, and came off it with the fixed purpose of a man. How I stuck to it is part of the story--the
best part, to my thinking; and I ought to know, seeing that our silver wedding comes this March.
Silver wedding, humph! She isn't a week older than the day I married her--not a week. It was
all in the way of her that I came here; though at the time I am speaking of I rather guessed
than knew it was Elizabeth. She lived over there beyond the bridge. We had been children together.
I suppose I had seen her a thousand times before without noticing. In school I had heard the
boys trading in her for marbles and brass buttons as a partner at dances and games--generally
trading off the other girls for her. She was such a pretty dancer! I was not. "Soldiers and
robbers" was more to my taste. That any girl, with curls or without, should be worth a good
marble, or a regimental button with a sound eye, that could be strung, was rank foolishness
to me until that day on the bridge.

And now I shall have to recross it after all, to tell who and what we were, that we may start
fair.  I shall have to go slow, too, for back of that day everything seems very indistinct
and strange. A few things stand out more clearly than the rest.  The day, for instance, when
I was first dragged off to school by an avenging housemaid and thrust howling into an empty
hogshead by the ogre of a schoolmarm, who, when she had put the lid on, gnashed her yellow
teeth at the bunghole and told me that so bad boys were dealt with in school. At recess she
had me up to the pig-pen in the yard as a further warning. The pig had a slit in the ear. 
It was for being lazy, she explained, and showed me the shears. Boys were no better than pigs.
Some were worse; then--a jab at the air with the scissors told the rest. Poor father! He was
a schoolmaster, too; how much sorrow it might have spared him had he known of this! But we
were too scared to tell, I suppose. He had set his heart upon my taking up his calling, and
I hated the school from the day I first saw it. Small wonder. The only study he succeeded in
interesting me in was English, because Charles Dickens's paper, All the Year Round, came to
the house with stories ever so much more alluring than the tedious grammar.  He was of the
old dispensation, wedded to the old ways. But the short cut I took to knowledge in that branch
I think opened his eyes to some things ahead of his time. Their day had not yet come. He lived
to see it dawn and was glad. I know how he felt about it. I myself have lived down the day
of the hogshead in the child-life of New York. Some of the schools our women made an end of
a few years ago weren't much better. To help clean them out was like getting square with the
ogre that plagued my childhood.

I mind, too, my first collision with the tenement.  There was just one, and it stood over against
the castle hill, separated from it only by the dry moat.  We called it Rag Hall, and I guess
it deserved the name. Ribe was a very old town. Five hundred years ago or so it had been the
seat of the fighting kings, when Denmark was a power to be reckoned with. There they were handy
when trouble broke out with the German barons to the south. But the times changed, and of all
its greatness there remained to Ribe only its famed cathedral, with eight centuries upon its
hoary head, and its Latin School. Of the castle of the Valdemars there was left only this green
hill with solemn sheep browsing upon it and ba-a-a-ing into the sunset. In the moats, where
once ships sailed in from the sea, great billowy masses of reeds ever bent and swayed under
the west wind that swept over the meadows. They grew much taller than our heads, and we boys
loved to play in them, to track the tiger or the grizzly to its lair, not without creeping
shudders at the peril that might lie in ambush at the next turn; or, hidden deep down among
them, we lay and watched the white clouds go overhead and listened to the reeds whispering
of the great days and deeds that were.

The castle hill was the only high ground about the town. It was said in some book of travel
that one might see twenty-four miles in any direction from Ribe, lying flat on one's back;
but that was drawing the long bow. Flat the landscape was, undeniably. From the top of the
castle hill we could see the sun setting upon the sea, and the islands lying high in fine weather,
as if floating in the air, the Nibs winding its silvery way through the green fields. Not a
tree, hardly a house, hindered the view. It was grass, all grass, for miles, to the sand dunes
and the beach. Strangers went into ecstasy over the little woodland patch down by the Long
Bridge, and very sweet and pretty it was; but to me, who was born there, the wide view to the
sea, the green meadows, with the lonesome flight of the shore-birds and the curlew's call in
the night-watches, were dearer far, with all their melancholy.  More than mountains in their
majesty; more, infinitely more, than the city of teeming millions with all its wealth and might,
they seem to me to typify human freedom and the struggle for it. Thence came the vikings that
roved the seas, serving no man as master; and through the dark ages of feudalism no lord long
bent the neck of those stout yeomen to the yoke. Germany, forgetting honor, treaties, and history,
is trying to do it now in Slesvig, south of the Nibs, and she will as surely fail. The day
of long-delayed justice, when dynasties by the grace of God shall have been replaced by government
by right of the people, will find them unconquered still.

Alas! I am afraid that thirty years in the land of my children's birth have left me as much
of a Dane as ever. I no sooner climb the castle hill than I am fighting tooth and nail the
hereditary foes of my people whom it was built high to bar. Yet, would you have it otherwise?
What sort of a husband is the man going to make who begins by pitching his old mother out of
the door to make room for his wife? And what sort of a wife would she be to ask or to stand it?

But I was speaking of the tenement by the moat.  It was a ramshackle, two-story affair with
shiftless tenants and ragged children. Looking back now, I think likely it was the contrast
of its desolation with the green hill and the fields I loved, of its darkness and human misery
and inefficiency with the valiant fighting men of my boyish dreams, that so impressed me. I
believe it because it is so now. Over against the tenement that we fight in our cities ever
rises in my mind the fields, the woods, God's open sky, as accuser and witness that His temple
is being so defiled, man so dwarfed in body and soul.

I know that Rag Hall displeased me very much.  I presume there must have been something of
an inquiring Yankee twist to my make-up, for the boys called me "Jacob the delver," mainly
because of my constant bothering with the sewerage of our house, which was of the most primitive
kind. An open gutter that was full of rats led under the house to the likewise open gutter
of the street. That was all there was of it, and very bad it was; but it had always been so,
and as, consequently, it could not be otherwise, my energies spent themselves in unending warfare
with those rats, whose nests choked the gutter. I could hardly have been over twelve or thirteen
when Rag Hall challenged my resentment.  My methods in dealing with it had at least the merit
of directness, if they added nothing to the sum of human knowledge or happiness.  I had received
a "mark," which was a coin like our silver quarter, on Christmas Eve, and I hied myself to
Rag Hall at once to divide it with the poorest family there, on the express condition that
they should tidy up things, especially those children, and generally change their way of living.
The man took the money--I have a vague recollection of seeing a stunned look on his face--and,
I believe, brought it back to our house to see if it was all right, thereby giving me great
offence. But he did the best for himself that way, for so Rag Hall came under the notice of
my mother too. And there really was some whitewashing done, and the children were cleaned up
for a season. So that the eight skilling were, if not wisely, yet well invested, after all.

No doubt Christmas had something to do with it. Poverty and misery always seem to jar more
at the time when the whole world makes merry. We took an entire week off to keep Christmas
in. Till after New Year's Day no one thought of anything else. The "Holy Eve" was the greatest
of the year. Then the Domkirke shone with a thousand wax candles that made the gloom in the
deep recesses behind the granite pillars seem deeper still, and brought out the picture of
the Virgin Mary and her child, long hidden under the whitewash of the Reformation, and so preserved
to our day by the very means taken to destroy it. The people sang the dear old hymns about
the child cradled in the manger, and mother's tears fell in her hymn-book. Dear old mother!
She had a house full, and little enough to manage with; but never one went hungry or unhelped
from her door. I am a believer in organized, systematic charity upon the evidence of my senses;
but--I am glad we have that one season in which we can forget our principles and err on the
side of mercy, that little corner in the days of the dying year for sentiment and no questions
asked. No need to be afraid. It is safe. Christmas charity never corrupts. Love keeps it sweet
and good--the love He brought into the world at Christmas to temper the hard reason of man.
Let it loose for that little spell.  January comes soon enough with its long cold.  Always
it seems to me the longest month in the year. It is so far to another Christmas!

To say that Ribe was an old town hardly describes it to readers at this day. A town might be
old and yet have kept step with time. In my day Ribe had not. It had never changed its step
or its ways since whale-oil lanterns first hung in iron chains across its cobblestone-paved
streets to light them at night. There they hung yet, every rusty link squeaking dolefully in
the wind that never ceased blowing from the sea. Coal-oil, just come from America, was regarded
as a dangerous innovation.  I remember buying a bottle of "Pennsylvania oil" at the grocer's
for eight skilling, as a doubtful domestic experiment. Steel pens had not crowded out the old-fashioned
goose-quill, and pen-knives meant just what their name implies.  Matches were yet of the future.
We carried tinder-boxes to strike fire with. People shook their heads at the telegraph. The
day of the stage-coach was not yet past. Steamboat and railroad had not come within forty miles
of the town, and only one steam factory--a cotton mill that was owned by Elizabeth's father.
At the time of the beginning of my story, he, having made much money during the early years
of the American war through foresight in having supplied himself with cotton, was building
another and larger, and I helped to put it up. Of progress and enterprise he held an absolute
monopoly in Ribe, and though he employed more than half of its working force, it is not far
from the truth that he was unpopular on that account. It could not be well otherwise in a town
whose militia company yet drilled with flint-lock muskets. Those we had in the school for the
use of the big boys--dreadful old blunderbusses of the pre-Napoleonic era--were of the same
pattern. I remember the fright that seized our worthy rector when the German army was approaching
in the winter of 1863, and the haste they made to pack them all up in a box and send them out
to be sunk in the deep, lest they fall into the hands of the enemy; and the consternation that
sat upon their faces when they saw the Prussian needle-guns.

The watchmen still cried the hour at night They do, for that matter, yet. The railroad came
to town and the march of improvement struck it, after I had gone away. Century-old institutions
were ruthlessly upset. The police force, which in my boyhood consisted of a man and a half--that
is, one with a wooden leg--was increased and uniformed, and the night watchmen's chant was
stopped. But there are limits to everything. The town that had been waked every hour of the
night since the early Middle Ages to be told that it slept soundly, could not possibly take
a night's rest without it. It lay awake dreading all sorts of unknown disasters. Universal
insomnia threatened it; and within a month, on petition of the entire community, the council
restored the songsters, and they squeak to this day. This may sound like exaggeration; but
it is not. It is a faithful record of what took place and stands so upon the official minutes
of the municipality.

When I was in Denmark last year, I looked over some of those old reports, and had more than
one melancholy laugh at the account of measures taken for the defence of Ribe at the first
assault of the Germans in 1849. That was the year I was born.  Ribe, being a border town on
the line of the coveted territory, set about arming itself to resist invasion. The citizens
built barricades in the streets--one of them, with wise forethought, in front of the drug store,
"in case any one were to faint" and stand in need of Hoffman's drops or smelling-salts. The
women filled kettles with hot water in the houses flanking an eventual advance.  "Two hundred
pounds of powder" were ordered from the next town by foot-post, and a cannon that had stood
half buried a hundred years, serving for a hitching-post, was dug up and put into commission.
There being a scarcity of guns, the curate of the next village reported arming his host with
spears and battle-axes as the next best thing. A rumor of a sudden advance of the enemy sent
the mothers with babes in arms scurrying north for safety. My mother was among them. I was
a month old at the time. Thirty years later I battled for the mastery in the police office
in Mulberry Street with a reporter for the Staats-Zeitung whom I discovered to be one of those
invaders, and I took it out of him in revenge. Old Cohen carried a Danish bullet in his arm
to remind him of his early ill-doings. But it was not fired in defence of Ribe. That collapsed
when a staff officer of the government, who had been sent out to report upon the zeal of the
Ribe men, declared that the town could be defended only by damming the river and flooding the
meadows, which would cost two hundred daler. The minutes of the council represent that that
was held to be too great a price to pay for the privilege of being sacked, perhaps, as a captured
town; and the citizen army disbanded.

If the coming of the invading army could have been timed to suit, the sea, which from old was
the bulwark of the nation, might have completed the defences of Ribe without other expense
to it than that of repairing damages. Two or three times a year, usually in the fall, when
it blew long and hard from the northwest, it broke in over the low meadows and flooded the
country as far as the eye could reach. Then the high causeways were the refuge of everything
that lived in the fields; hares, mice, foxes, and partridges huddled there, shivering in the
shower of spray that shot over the road, and making such stand as they could against the fierce
blast. If the "storm flood" came early in the season, before the cattle had been housed, there
was a worse story to tell. Then the town butcher went upon the causeway at daybreak with the
implements of his trade to save if possible, by letting the blood, at least the meat of drowned
cattle and sheep that were cast up by the sea. When it rose higher and washed over the road,
the mail-coach picked its way warily between white posts set on both sides to guide it safe.
We boys caught fish in the streets of the town, while red tiles flew from the roofs all about
us, and we enjoyed ourselves hugely. It was part of the duty of the watchmen who cried the
hours to give warning if the sea came in suddenly during the night. And when we heard it we
shivered in our beds with gruesome delight.

The people of Ribe were of three classes: the officials, the tradesmen, and the working people.
The bishop, the burgomaster, and the rector of the Latin School headed the first class, to
which my father belonged as the senior master in the school.  Elizabeth's father easily led
the second class. For the third, it had no leaders and nothing to say at that time. On state
occasions lines were quite sharply drawn between the classes, but the general kindliness of
the people caused them at ordinary times to be so relaxed that the difference was hardly to
be noticed. Theirs was a real neighborliness that roamed unrestrained and without prejudice
until brought up with a round turn at the barrier of traditional orthodoxy. I remember well
one instance of that kind. There lived in our town a single family of Jews, well-to-do tradespeople,
gentle and good, and socially popular. There lived also a Gentile woman of wealth, a mother
in the strictly Lutheran Israel, who fed and clothed the poor and did no end of good. She was
a very pious woman. It so happened that the Jewess and the Christian were old friends. But
one day they strayed upon dangerous ground. The Jewess saw it and tried to turn the conversation
from the forbidden topic.

"Well, dear friend," she said, soothingly, "some day, when we meet in heaven, we shall all
know better."

The barrier was reached. Her friend fairly bristled as she made reply:

"What! Our heaven? No, indeed! We may be good friends here, Mrs----, but there--really, you
will have to excuse me."

Narrow streams are apt to run deep. An incident which I set down in justice to the uncompromising
orthodoxy of that day, made a strong impression on me. The two concerned in it were my uncle,
a generous, bright, even a brilliant man, but with no great bump of reverence, and the deacon
in the village church where they lived. He was the exact opposite of my uncle: hard, unlovely,
but deeply religious. The two were neighbors and quarrelled about their fence-line. For months
they did not speak. On Sunday the deacon strode by on his way to church, and my uncle, who
stayed home, improved the opportunity to point out of what stuff those Pharisees were made,
much to his own edification. Easter week came. In Denmark it is, or was, custom to go to communion
once a year, on Holy Thursday, if at no other season, and, I might add, rarely at any other.
On Wednesday night, the deacon appeared, unbidden, at my uncle's door, craving an interview.
If a spectre had suddenly walked in, I do not suppose he could have lost his wits more completely.
He recovered them with an effort, and bidding his guest welcome, led him courteously to his office.

From that interview he came forth a changed man. Long years after I heard the full story of
it from my uncle's own lips. It was simple enough.  The deacon said that duty called him to
the communion table on the morrow, and that he could not reconcile it with his conscience to
go with hate toward his neighbor in his heart. Hence he had come to tell him that he might
have the line as he claimed it. The spark struck fire. Then and there they made up and were
warm friends, though agreeing in nothing, till they died. "The faith," said my uncle in telling
of it, "that could work in that way upon such a nature, is not to be made light of." And he
never did after that. He died a believing man.

It may be that it contributed something to the ordinarily democratic relations of the upper-class
men and the tradespeople that the latter were generally well-to-do, while the officials mostly
had a running fight of it with their incomes. My father's salary had to reach around to a family
of fourteen, nay, fifteen, for he took his dead sister's child when a baby and brought her
up with us, who were boys all but one. Father had charge of the Latin form, and this, with
a sense of grim humor, caused him, I suppose, to check his children off with the Latin numerals,
as it were. The sixth was baptized Sextus, the ninth Nonus, though they were not called so,
and he was dissuaded from calling the twelfth Duodecimus only by the certainty that the other
boys would miscall him "Dozen." How I escaped Tertius I don't know. Probably the scheme had
not been thought of then. Poor father! Of the whole fourteen but one lived to realize his hopes
of a professional career, only to die when he had just graduated from the medical school. My
oldest brother went to sea; Sophus, the doctor, was the next; and I, when it came my time to
study in earnest, refused flatly and declared my wish to learn the carpenter's trade. Not till
thirty years after did I know how deep the wound was I struck my father then. He had set his
heart upon my making a literary career, and though he was very far from lacking sympathy with
the workingman--I rather think that he was the one link between the upper and lower strata
in our town in that way, enjoying the most hearty respect of both--yet it was a sad disappointment
to him. It was in 1893, when I saw him for the last time, that I found it out, by a chance
remark he dropped when sitting with my first book, "How the Other Half Lives," in his hand,
and also the sacrifice he had made of his own literary ambitions to eke out by hack editorial
work on the local newspaper a living for his large family. As for me, I would have been repaid
for the labor of writing a thousand books by witnessing the pride he took in mine.  There was
at last a man of letters in the family, though he came by a road not down on the official map.

Crying over spilt milk was not my father's fashion, however.  If I was to be a carpenter, there
was a good one in town, to whom I was forthwith apprenticed for a year. During that time, incidentally,
I might make up my mind, upon the evidence of my reduced standing, that school was, after all,
to be preferred. And thus it was that I came to be a working boy helping build her proud father's
factory at the time I fell head over heels in love with sweet Elizabeth. Certainly I had taken
no easy road to the winning of my way and my bride; so reasoned the town, which presently took
note of my infatuation.  But, then, it laughed, there was time enough.  I was fifteen and she
was not thirteen. There was time enough, oh, yes! Only I did not think so.  My courtship proceeded
at a tumultuous pace, which first made the town laugh, then put it out of patience and made
some staid matrons express the desire to box my ears soundly. It must be owned that if courting
were generally done on the plan I adopted, there would be little peace and less safety all
around. When she came playing among the lumber where we were working, as she naturally would,
danger dogged my steps. I carry a scar on the shin-bone made with an adze I should have been
minding when I was looking after her. The forefinger on my left hand has a stiff joint. I cut
that off with an axe when she was dancing on a beam close by. Though it was put on again by
a clever surgeon and kept on, I have never had the use of it since. But what did a finger matter,
or ten, when she was only there! Once I fell off the roof when I must crane my neck to see
her go around the corner. But I hardly took note of those things, except to enlist her sympathy
by posing as a wounded hero with my arm in a sling at the dancing-school which I had joined
on purpose to dance with her. I was the biggest boy there, and therefore first to choose a
partner, and I remember even now the snickering of the school when I went right over and took
Elizabeth. She flushed angrily, but I didn't care. That was what I was there for, and I had
her now. I didn't let her go again, either, though the teacher delicately hinted that we were
not a good match. She was the best dancer in the school, and I was the worst. Not a good match,
hey! That was as much as she knew about it.

It was at the ball that closed the dancing-school that I excited the strong desire of the matrons
to box my ears by ordering Elizabeth's father off the floor when he tried to join in before
midnight, the time set for the elders to take charge. I was floor committee, but how I could
do such a thing passes my understanding, except on the principle laid down by Mr. Dooley that
when a man is in love he is looking for fight all around. I must have been, for they had to
hold me back by main strength from running away to the army that was fighting a losing fight
with two Great Powers that winter. Though I was far under age, I was a big boy, and might have
passed; but the hasty retreat of our brave little band before overwhelming odds settled it.
With the echoes of the scandal caused by the ball episode still ringing, I went off to Copenhagen
to serve out my apprenticeship there with a great builder whose name I saw among the dead in
the paper only the other day. He was ever a good friend to me.

The third day after I reached the capital, which happened to be my birthday, I had appointed
a meeting with my student brother at the art exhibition in the palace of Charlottenborg. I
found two stairways running up from the main entrance, and was debating in my mind which to
take, when a handsome gentleman in a blue overcoat asked, with a slight foreign accent, if
he could help me. I told him my trouble, and we went up together.

We walked slowly and carried on quite an animated conversation; that is to say, I did. His
part of it was confined mostly to questions, which I was no way loth to answer. I told him
about myself and my plans; about the old school, and about my father, whom I took it for granted
he knew; for was he not the oldest teacher in the school, and the wisest, as all Ribe could
testify? He listened to it all with a curious little smile, and nodded in a very pleasant and
sympathetic way which I liked to see.  I told him so, and that I liked the people of Copenhagen
well; they seemed so kind to a stranger, and he put his hand on my arm and patted it in a friendly
manner that was altogether nice. So we arrived together at the door where the red lackey stood.

He bowed very deep as we entered, and I bowed back, and told my friend that there was an example
of it; for I had never seen the man before. At which he laughed outright, and, pointing to
a door, said I would find my brother in there, and bade me good-by. He was gone before I could
shake hands with him; but just then my brother came up, and I forgot about him in my admiration
of the pictures.

We were resting in one of the rooms an hour later, and I was going over the events of the day,
telling all about the kind stranger, when in he came, and nodded, smiling at me.

"There he is," I cried, and nodded too. To my surprise, Sophus got up with a start and salaamed
in haste.

"Good gracious!" he said, when the stranger was gone. "You don't mean to say he was your guide?
Why, that was the King, boy!"

I was never so astonished in my life and expect never to be again. I had only known kings from
Hans Christian Andersen's story books, where they always went in coronation robes, with long
train and pages, and with gold crowns on their heads.  That a king could go around in a blue
overcoat, like any other man, was a real shock to me that I didn't get over for a while. But
when I got to know more of King Christian, I liked him all the better for it. You couldn't
help that anyhow. His people call him "the good king" with cause. He is that.

Speaking of Hans Christian Andersen, we boys loved him as a matter of course; for had he not
told us all the beautiful stories that made the whole background of our lives? They do that
yet with me, more than you would think. The little Christmas tree and the hare that made it
weep by jumping over it because it was so small, belong to the things that come to stay with
you always. I hear of people nowadays who think it is not proper to tell children fairy-stories.
I am sorry for those children. I wonder what they will give them instead. Algebra, perhaps.
Nice lot of counting machines we shall have running the century that is to come! But though
we loved Andersen, we were not above playing our pranks upon him when occasion offered. In
those days Copenhagen was girt about with great earthen walls, and there were beautiful walks
up there under the old lindens. On moonlight nights when the smell of violets was in the air,
we would sometimes meet the poet there, walking alone. Then we would string out irreverently
in Indian file and walk up, cap in hand, one after another, to salute him with a deeply respectful
"Good evening, Herr Professor!" That was his title. His kind face would beam with delight,
and our proffered fists would be buried in the very biggest hand, it seemed to us, that mortal
ever owned,--Andersen had very large hands and feet,--and we would go away gleefully chuckling
and withal secretly ashamed of ourselves. He was in such evident delight at our homage.

They used to tell a story of Andersen at the time that made the whole town laugh in its sleeve,
though there was not a bit of malice in it. No one had anything but the sincerest affection
for the poet in my day; his storm and stress period was then long past. He was, it was said,
greatly afraid of being buried alive. So that it might not happen, he carefully pinned a paper
to his blanket every night before he went to sleep, on which was written: "I guess I am only
in a trance." [Footnote: In Danish: "Jeg er vist skindod."] Needless to say, he was in no danger.
When he fell into his long sleep, the whole country, for that matter the whole world, stood
weeping at his bier.

Four years I dreamt away in Copenhagen while I learned my trade. The intervals when I was awake
were when she came to the town on a visit with her father, or, later, to finish her education
at a fashionable school. I mind the first time she came. I was at the depot, and I rode with
her on the back of their coach, unknown to them. So I found out what hotel they were to stay
at. I called the next day, and purposely forgot my gloves. Heaven knows where I got them from
I probably borrowed them. Those were not days for gloves. Her father sent them to my address
the next day with a broad hint that, having been neighborly, I needn't call again. He was getting
square for the ball. But my wife says that I was never good at taking a hint, except in the
way of business, as a reporter. I kept the run of her all the time she was in the city. She
did not always see me, but I saw her, and that was enough. I watched her home from school in
the evening, and was content, though she was escorted by a cadet with a pig-sticker at his
side. He was her cousin, and had given me his word that he cared nothing about her. He is a
commodore and King Christian's Secretary of Navy now. When she was sick, I pledged my Sunday
trousers for a dollar and bought her a bouquet of flowers which they teased her about until
she cried and threw it away. And all the time she was getting more beautiful and more lovable.
She was certainly the handsomest girl in Copenhagen, which is full of charming women.

There were long spells when she was away, and when I dreamt on undisturbed. It was during one
of these that I went to the theatre with my brother to see a famous play in which an assassin
tried to murder the heroine, who was asleep in an armchair.  Now, this heroine was a well-known
actress who looked singularly like Elizabeth. As she sat there with the long curls sweeping
her graceful neck, in imminent danger of being killed, I forgot where I was, what it was, all
and everything except that danger threatened Elizabeth, and sprang to my feet with a loud cry
of murder, trying to make for the stage. My brother struggled to hold me back.  There was a
sensation in the theatre, and the play was held up while they put me out. I remember King George
of Greece eying me from his box as I was being transported to the door, and the rascal murderer
on the stage looking as if he had done something deserving of praise. Outside, in the cold,
my brother shook me up and took me home, a sobered and somewhat crestfallen lad. But, anyhow,
I don't like that kind of play. I don't see why the villain on the stage is any better than
the villain on the street. There are enough of them and to spare. And think if he had killed her!

The years passed, and the day came at last when, having proved my fitness, I received my certificate
as a duly enrolled carpenter of the guild of Copenhagen, and, dropping my tools joyfully and
in haste, made a bee-line for Ribe, where she was.  I thought that I had moved with very stealthy
steps toward my goal, having grown four years older than at the time I set the whole community
by the ears. But it could not have been so, for I had not been twenty-four hours in town before
it was all over that I had come home to propose to Elizabeth; which was annoying but true.
By the same sort of sorcery the town knew in another day that she had refused me, and all the
wise heads wagged and bore witness that they could have told me so.  What did I, a common carpenter,
want at the "castle"? That was what they called her father's house. He had other plans for
his pretty daughter.

As for Elizabeth, poor child! she was not yet seventeen, and was easily persuaded that it was
all wrong; she wept, and in the goodness of her gentle heart was truly sorry; and I kissed
her hands and went out, my eyes brimming over with tears, feeling that there was nothing in
all the wide world for me any more, and that the farther I went from her the better. So it
was settled that I should go to America. Her mother gave me a picture of her and a lock of
her hair, and thereby roused the wrath of the dowagers once more; for why should I be breaking
my heart over Elizabeth in foreign parts, since she was not for me?  Ah, but mothers know better!
I lived on that picture and that curl six long years.

One May morning my own mother went to the stagecoach with me to see me off on my long journey.
Father stayed home. He was ever a man who, with the tenderest of hearts, put on an appearance
of great sternness lest he betray it.  God rest his soul! That nothing that I have done caused
him greater grief in his life than the separation that day is sweet comfort to me now. He lived
to take Elizabeth to his heart, a beloved daughter. For me, I had been that morning, long before
the sun rose, under her window to bid her good-by, but she did not know it. The servants did,
though, and told her of it when she got up.  And she, girl-like, said, "Well, I didn't ask
him to come;" but in her secret soul I think there was a small regret that she did not see me go.

So I went out in the world to seek my fortune, the richer for some $40 which Ribe friends had
presented to me, knowing that I had barely enough to pay my passage over in the steerage. 
Though I had aggravated them in a hundred ways and wholly disturbed the peace of the old town,
I think they liked me a little, anyway. They were always good, kind neighbors, honest and lovable
folk. I looked back with my mother's blessing yet in my ears, to where the gilt weather-vanes
glistened on her father's house, and the tears brimmed over again. And yet, such is life, presently
I felt my heart bound with a new courage. All was not lost yet. The world was before me. But
yesterday the chance befell that, in going to communion in the old Domkirke, I knelt beside
her at the altar rail. I thought of that and dried my eyes. God is good. He did not lay it
up against me. When next we met there, we knelt to be made man and wife, for better or worse;
blessedly, gloriously for better, forever and aye, and all our troubles were over. For had
we not one another?

CHAPTER II

I LAND IN NEW YORK AND TAKE A HAND IN THE GAME

The steamer Iowa, from Glasgow, made port, after a long and stormy voyage, on Whitsunday, 1870.
She had come up during the night, and cast anchor off Castle Garden. It was a beautiful spring
morning, and as I looked over the rail at the miles of straight streets, the green heights
of Brooklyn, and the stir of ferryboats and pleasure craft on the river, my hopes rose high
that somewhere in this teeming hive there would be a place for me. What kind of a place I had
myself no clear notion of. I would let that work out as it could. Of course I had my trade
to fall back on, but I am afraid that is all the use I thought of putting it to. The love of
change belongs to youth, and I meant to take a hand in things as they came along. I had a pair
of strong hands, and stubbornness enough to do for two; also a strong belief that in a free
country, free from the dominion of custom, of caste, as well as of men, things would somehow
come right in the end, and a man get shaken into the corner where he belonged if he took a
hand in the game. I think I was right in that. If it took a lot of shaking to get me where
I belonged, that was just what I needed. Even my mother admits that now. To tell the truth,
I was tired of hammer and saw.  They were indissolubly bound up with my dreams of Elizabeth
that were now gone to smash. Therefore I hated them. And straightway, remembering that the
day was her birthday, and accepting the fact as a good omen, I rebuilt my air-castles and resolved
to try on a new tack. So irrational is human nature at twenty-one, when in love. And isn't
it good that it is?

In all of which I have made no account of a factor which is at the bottom of half our troubles
with our immigrant population, so far as they are not of our own making: the loss of reckoning
that follows uprooting; the cutting loose from all sense of responsibility, with the old standards
gone, that makes the politician's job so profitable in our large cities, and that of the patriot
and the housekeeper so wearisome. We all know the process. The immigrant has no patent on it.
It afflicts the native, too, when he goes to a town where he is not known. In the slum it reaches
its climax in the second generation, and makes of the Irishman's and the Italian's boys the
"toughs" who fight the battles of Hell's Kitchen and Frog Hollow. It simply means that we are
creatures of environment, that a man everywhere is largely what his neighbors and his children
think him to be, and that government makes for our moral good too, dreamers and anarchists
to the contrary notwithstanding. But, simple as it is, it has been too long neglected for the
safety of the man and of the State. I am not going to discuss here plans for mending this neglect,
but I can think of three that would work; one of them does work, if not up to the top notch--the
public school. In its ultimate development as the neighborhood centre of things, I would have
that the first care of city government, always and everywhere, at whatever expense. An efficient
parish districting is another. I think we are coming to that. The last is a rigid annual enrolment--the
school census is good, but not good enough--for vaccination purposes, jury duty, for military
purposes if you please. I do not mean for conscription, but for the ascertainment of the fighting
strength of the State in case of need--for anything that would serve as an excuse. It is the
enrolment itself that I think would have a good effect in making the man feel that he is counted
on for something; that he belongs as it were, instead of standing idle and watching a procession
go by, in which there is no place for him; which is only another way of saying that it is his
right to harass it and levy tribute as he can. The enrolment for voting comes too late. By
that time he may have joined the looters' army.

So as properly to take my own place in the procession, if not in the army referred to, as I
conceived the custom of the country to be, I made it my first business to buy a navy revolver
of the largest size, investing in the purchase exactly one-half of my capital. I strapped the
weapon on the outside of my coat and strode up Broadway, conscious that I was following the
fashion of the country. I knew it upon the authority of a man who had been there before me
and had returned, a gold digger in the early days of California; but America was America to
us. We knew no distinction of West and East. By rights there ought to have been buffaloes and
red Indians charging up and down Broadway. I am sorry to say that it is easier even to-day
to make lots of people over there believe that, than that New York is paved, and lighted with
electric lights, and quite as civilized as Copenhagen. They will have it that it is in the
wilds. I saw none of the signs of this, but I encountered a friendly policeman, who, sizing
me and my pistol up, tapped it gently with his club and advised me to leave it home, or I might
get robbed of it. This, at first blush, seemed to confirm my apprehensions; but he was a very
nice policeman, and took time to explain, seeing that I was very green. And I took his advice
and put the revolver away, secretly relieved to get rid of it.  It was quite heavy to carry around.

I had letters to the Danish Consul and to the President of the American Banknote Company, Mr.
Goodall. I think perhaps he was not then the president, but became so afterward. Mr. Goodall
had once been wrecked on the Danish coast and rescued by the captain of the lifesaving crew,
a friend of my family. But they were both in Europe, and in just four days I realized that
there was no special public clamor for my services in New York, and decided to go West. A missionary
in Castle Garden was getting up a gang of men for the Brady's Bend Iron Works on the Allegheny
River, and I went along. We started a full score, with tickets paid, but only two of us reached
the Bend. The rest calmly deserted in Pittsburg and went their own way. Now here was an instance
of what I have just been saying. Not one of them, probably, would have thought of doing it
on the other side. They would have carried out their contract as a matter of course. Here they
broke it as a matter of course, the minute it didn't suit them to go on. Two of them had been
on our steamer, and the thought of them makes me laugh even now. One was a Dane who carried
an immense knapsack that was filled with sausages, cheese, and grub of all kinds when he came
aboard. He never let go of it for a moment on the voyage. In storm and sunshine he was there,
shouldering his knapsack. I think he slept with it. When I last saw him hobbling down a side
street in Pittsburg, he carried it still, but one end of it hung limp and hungry, and the other
was as lean as a bad year. The other voyager was a jovial Swede whose sole baggage consisted
of an old musket, a blackthorn stick, and a barometer glass, tied up together. The glass, he
explained, was worth keeping; it might some day make an elegant ruler. The fellow was a blacksmith,
and I mistrust that he could not write.

Adler and I went on to Brady's Bend. Adler was a big, explosive German who had been a reserve
officer, I think, in the Prussian army. Fate had linked us together when on the steamer the
meat served in the steerage became so bad as to offend not only our palates, but our sense
of smell. We got up a demonstration, marching to see the captain in a body, Adler and I carrying
a tray of the objectionable meat between us. As the spokesman, I presented the case briefly
and respectfully, and all would have gone well had not the hot blood of Adler risen at the
wrong moment, when the captain was cautiously exploring the scent of the rejected food. With
a sudden upward jerk he caused that official's nose to disappear momentarily in the dish, while
he exploded in voluble German. The result was an instant rupture of diplomatic relations. 
Adler was put in the lock-up, but set fiee again immediately. He spent the rest of the voyage
in his bunk shouting dire threats of disaster impending from the "Norddeutsche Consul," once
he reached New York. But we were all too glad to get ashore to think of vengeance then.

Adler found work at the blast-furnace, while I was set to building huts for the miners on the
east bank of the river where a clearing had been made and called East Brady. On the other side
of the Allegheny the furnaces and rolling mills were hidden away in a narrow, winding valley
that set back into the forest-clad hills, growing deeper and narrower with every mile. It was
to me, who had been used to seeing the sun rise and set over a level plain where the winds
of heaven blew as they listed, from the first like a prison. I climbed the hills only to find
that there were bigger hills beyond--an endless sea of swelling billows of green without a
clearing in it. I spent all Sunday roaming through it, miles and miles, to find an outlook
from which I might see the end; but there was none. A horrible fit of homesickness came upon
me. The days I managed to get through by working hard and making observations on the American
language.  In this I had a volunteer assistant in Julia, the pretty, barefooted daughter of
a coal-miner, who hung around and took an interest in what was going on. But she disappeared
after I had asked her to explain what setting one's cap for any one meant. I was curious because
I had heard her mother say to a neighbor that Julia was doing that to me. But the evenings
were very lonesome.  The girl in our boarding-house washed dishes always to one tune, "The
Letter that Never Came." It was not a cheerful tune and not a cheerful subject, for I had had
no news from home since I left.  I can hear her yet, shrieking and clattering her dishes, with
the frogs yelling accompaniment in the creek that mumbled in the valley. I never could abide
American frogs since. There is rest in the ko-ax, ko-ax! of its European brother, but the breathless
yi! yi! of our American frogs makes me feel always as if I wanted to die--which I don't.

In making the clearing, I first saw an American wood-cutter swing an axe, and the sight filled
me with admiration for the man and the axe both. It was a "double-bitter," and he a typical
long-armed and long-limbed backwoodsman. I also had learned to use the axe, but anything like
the way he swung it, first over one, then over the other shoulder, making it tell in long,
clean cuts at every blow, I had never dreamt of. It was splendid. I wished myself back in Copenhagen
just long enough to tell the numskulls there, who were distrustful of American tools, which
were just beginning to come into the market, that they didn't know what they were talking about.
Of course it was reasonable that the good tools should come from the country where they had
good use for them.

There was a settlement of honest Welshmen in the back hills, and the rumor that a Dane had
come into the valley reached it in due course. It brought down a company of four sturdy miners,
who trudged five miles over bad land of a Sunday to see what I was like. The Danes who live
in Welsh song and story must have been grievous giants, for they were greatly disgusted at
sight of me, and spoke their minds about it without reserve, even with some severity, as if
I were guilty of some sort of an imposition on the valley.

It could hardly have been this introduction that tempted me to try coal-mining. I have forgotten
how it came about--probably through some temporary slackness in the building trade; but I did
try, and one day was enough for me. The company mined its own coal. Such as it was, it cropped
out of the hills right and left in narrow veins, sometimes too shallow to work, seldom affording
more space to the digger than barely enough to permit him to stand upright. You did not go
down through a shaft, but straight in through the side of a hill to the bowels of the mountain,
following a track on which a little donkey drew the coal to the mouth of the mine and sent
it down the incline to run up and down a hill a mile or more by its own gravity before it reached
the place of unloading.  Through one of these we marched in, Adler and I, one summer morning
with new pickaxes on our shoulders and nasty little oil lamps fixed in our hats to light us
through the darkness where every second we stumbled over chunks of slate rock, or into pools
of water that oozed through from above.  An old miner whose way lay past the fork in the tunnel
where our lead began showed us how to use our picks and the timbers to brace the slate that
roofed over the vein, and left us to ourselves in a chamber perhaps ten feet wide and the height
of a man.

We were to be paid by the ton, I forget how much, but it was very little, and we lost no time
getting to work. We had to dig away the coal at the floor with our picks, lying on our knees
to do it, and afterward drive wedges under the roof to loosen the mass. It was hard work, and,
entirely inexperienced as we were, we made but little headway.  As the day wore on, the darkness
and silence grew very oppressive, and made us start nervously at the least thing. The sudden
arrival of our donkey with its cart gave me a dreadful fright. The friendly beast greeted us
with a joyous bray and rubbed its shaggy sides against us in the most companionable way. In
the flickering light of my lamp I caught sight of its long ears waving over me--I don't believe
I had seen three donkeys before in my life; there were none where I came from--and heard that
demoniac shriek, and I verily believe I thought the evil one had come for me in person. I know
that I nearly fainted.

That donkey was a discerning animal. I think it knew when it first set eyes on us that we were
not going to overwork it; and we didn't. When, toward evening, we quit work, after narrowly
escaping being killed by a large stone that fell from the roof in consequence of our neglect
to brace it up properly, our united efforts had resulted in barely filling two of the little
carts, and we had earned, if I recollect aright, something like sixty cents each.  The fall
of the roof robbed us of all desire to try mining again. It knocked the lamps from our hats,
and, in darkness that could almost be felt, we groped our way back to the light along the track,
getting more badly frightened as we went. The last stretch of way we ran, holding each other's
hands as though we were not men and miners, but two frightened children in the dark.

As we emerged from the damp gap in the mountain side, the sunset was upon the hills. Peaceful
sounds came up from the valley where the shadows lay deep. Gangs of men were going home from
the day's toil to their evening rest It seemed to me that I had been dead and had come back
to life. The world was never so wondrous fair. My companion stood looking out over the landscape
with hungry eyes. Neither of us spoke, but when the last gleam had died out in the window of
the stone church we went straight to the company's store and gave up our picks. I have never
set foot in a coal mine since, and have not the least desire to do so.

I was back in the harness of the carpenter-shop when, in the middle of July, the news struck
down in our quiet community like a bombshell that France had declared war on Prussia; also
that Denmark was expected to join her forces to those of her old ally and take revenge for
the great robbery of 1864. I dropped my tools the moment I heard it, and flew rather than ran
to the company's office to demand my time; thence to our boarding-house to pack. Adler reasoned
and entreated, called it an insane notion, but, when he saw that nothing would stop me, lent
a hand in stuffing my trunk, praying pathetically between pulls that his countrymen would make
short work of me, as they certainly would of France. I heeded nothing. All the hot blood of
youth was surging through me. I remembered the defeat, the humiliation of the flag I loved,--aye!
and love yet, for there is no flag like the flag of my fathers, save only that of my children
and of my manhood,--and I remembered, too, Elizabeth, with a sudden hope. I would be near her
then, and I would earn fame and glory. The carpenter would come back with shoulder-straps.
Perhaps then, in the castle...I shouldered my trunk and ran for the station. Such tools, clothes,
and things as it would not hold I sold for what they would fetch, and boarded the next train
for Buffalo, which was as far as my money would take me.

I cannot resist the temptation at this point to carry the story thirty years forward to last
winter, in order to point out one of the queer happenings which long ago caused me to be known
to my friends as "the man of coincidences." I have long since ceased to consider them as such,
though in this one there is no other present significance than that it decided a point which
I had been turning over in my own mind, of moment to me and my publisher.  I was lecturing
in Pittsburg at the time, and ran up to take another look at Brady's Bend. I found the valley
deserted and dead. The mills were gone.  Disaster had overtaken them in the panic of 1873,
and all that remained of the huge plant was a tottering stump of the chimney and clusters of
vacant houses dropping to pieces here and there. Young trees grew out of the cold ashes in
the blast-furnace. All about was desolation. Strolling down by the river with the editor of
the local paper in East Brady, which had grown into a slow little railroad town, my eye fell
upon a wrecked hut in which I recognized the company's office. The shutters were gone, the
door hung on one hinge, and the stairs had rotted away, but we climbed in somehow. It was an
idle quest, said my companion; all the books and papers had been sold the summer before to
a Pittsburg junkman, who came with a cart and pitchforked them into it as so much waste paper.
His trail was plain within. The floor was littered with torn maps and newspapers from the second
term of President Grant. In a rubbish heap I kicked against something more solid and picked
it up. It was the only book left in the place: the "draw-book" for the years 1870-72; and almost
the first name I read was my own, as having received, on July 19, 1870, $10.63 in settlement
of my account with the Brady's Bend Company when I started for the war. My companion stared.
I wrapped up the book and took it away with me. I considered that I had a moral right to it;
but if anybody questions it, it is at his service.

Buffalo was full of Frenchmen, but they did not receive me with a torchlight procession. They
even shrugged their shoulders when good old Pater Bretton took up my cause and tried to get
me forwarded at least to New York. The one patriot I found to applaud my high resolve was a
French pawnbroker, who, with many compliments and shoulder pattings, took my trunk and all
its contents, after I had paid my board out of it, in exchange for a ticket to New York. He
took my watch, too, but that didn't keep time. I remember seeing my brush go with a grim smile.
Having no clothes to brush, I had no need of it any longer. That pawnbroker was an artist.
The year after, when I was in Buffalo again, it occurred to me to go in and see if I could
get back any of my belongings. I was just a bit ashamed of myself, and represented that I was
a brother of the young hothead who had gone to the war. I thought I discovered a pair of trousers
that had been mine hanging up in his store, but the Frenchman was quicker than I. His eyes
followed mine, and he took instant umbrage:--

"So your brother vas one shump, vas he?" he yelled. "Your brother vas a long sight better man
zan you, mine frient. He go fight for la France.  You stay here. Get out!" And he put me out,
and saved the day and the trousers.

It was never a good plan for me to lie. It never did work out right, not once. I have found
the only safe plan to be to stick to the truth and let the house come down if it must. It will
come down anyhow.

I reached New York with just one cent in my pocket, and put up at a boarding-house where the
charge was one dollar a day. In this no moral obliquity was involved. I had simply reached
the goal for which I had sacrificed all, and felt sure that the French people or the Danish
Consul would do the rest quickly. But there was evidently something wrong somewhere. The Danish
Consul could only register my demand to be returned to Denmark in the event of war. They have
my letter at the office yet, he tells me, and they will call me out with the reserves. The
French were fitting out no volunteer army that I could get on the track of, and nobody was
paying the passage of fighting men. The end of it was that, after pawning my revolver and my
top-boots, the only valuable possessions I had left, to pay for my lodging, I was thrown on
the street, and told to come back when I had more money. That night I wandered about New York
with a gripsack that had only a linen duster and a pair of socks in it, turning over in my
mind what to do next. Toward midnight I passed a house in Clinton Place that was lighted up
festively.  Laughter and the hum of many voices came from within. I listened. They spoke French.
A society of Frenchmen having their annual dinner, the watchman in the block told me.  There
at last was my chance. I went up the steps and rang the bell. A flunkey in a dress-suit opened,
but when he saw that I was not a guest, but to all appearances a tramp, he tried to put me
out. I, on my part, tried to explain. There was an altercation, and two gentlemen of the society
appeared. They listened impatiently to what I had to say, then, without a word, thrust me into
the street and slammed the door in my face.

It was too much. Inwardly raging, I shook the dust of the city from my feet, and took the most
direct route out of it, straight up Third Avenue. I walked till the stars in the east began
to pale, and then climbed into a wagon that stood at the curb to sleep. I did not notice that
it was a milk-wagon.  The sun had not risen yet when the driver came, unceremoniously dragged
me out by the feet, and dumped me into the gutter. On I went with my gripsack, straight ahead,
until toward noon I reached Fordham College, famished and footsore.  I had eaten nothing since
the previous day, and had vainly tried to make a bath in the Bronx River do for breakfast.
Not yet could I cheat my stomach that way.

The college gates were open, and I strolled wearily in, without aim or purpose. On a lawn some
young men were engaged in athletic exercises, and I stopped to look and admire the beautiful
shade-trees and the imposing building. So at least it seems to me at this distance. An old
monk in a cowl, whose noble face I sometimes recall in my dreams, came over and asked kindly
if I was not hungry. I was in all conscience fearfully hungry, and I said so, though I did
not mean to. I had never seen a real live monk before, and my Lutheran training had not exactly
inclined me in their favor. I ate of the food set before me, not without qualms of conscience,
and with a secret suspicion that I would next be asked to abjure my faith, or at least do homage
to the Virgin Mary, which I was firmly resolved not to do.  But when, the meal finished, I
was sent on my way with enough to do me for supper, without the least allusion having been
made to my soul, I felt heartily ashamed of myself. I am just as good a Protestant as I ever
was. Among my own I am a kind of heretic even, because I cannot put up with the apostolic succession;
but I have no quarrel with the excellent charities of the Roman Church, or with the noble spirit
that animates them. I learned that lesson at Fordham thirty years ago.

Up the railroad track I went, and at night hired out to a truck-farmer, with the freedom of
his haymow for my sleeping quarters. But when I had hoed cucumbers three days in a scorching
sun, till my back ached as if it were going to break, and the farmer guessed that he would
call it square for three shillings, I went farther. A man is not necessarily a philanthropist,
it seems, because he tills the soil.  I did not hire out again. I did odd jobs to earn my meals,
and slept in the fields at night, still turning over in my mind how to get across the sea.
An incident of those wanderings comes to mind while I am writing. They were carting in hay,
and when night came on, somewhere about Mount Vernon, I gathered an armful of wisps that had
fallen from the loads, and made a bed for myself in a wagon-shed by the roadside. In the middle
of the night I was awakened by a loud outcry. A fierce light shone in my face. It was the lamp
of a carriage that had been driven into the shed. I was lying between the horse's feet unhurt.
A gentleman sprang from the carriage, more frightened than I, and bent over me.  When he found
that I had suffered no injury, he put his hand in his pocket and held out a silver quarter.

"Go," he said, "and drink it up."

"Drink it up yourself!" I shouted angrily.  "What do you take me for?"

They were rather high heroics, seeing where I was, but he saw nothing to laugh at. He looked
earnestly at me for a moment, then held out his hand and shook mine heartily. "I believe you,"
he said; "yet you need it, or you would not sleep here.  Now will you take it from me?" And
I took the money.

The next day it rained, and the next day after that, and I footed it back to the city, still
on my vain quest. A quarter is not a great capital to subsist on in New York when one is not
a beggar and has no friends. Two days of it drove me out again to find at least the food to
keep me alive; but in those two days I met the man who, long years after, was to be my honored
chief, Charles A. Dana, the editor of the Sun. There had been an item in the Sun about a volunteer
regiment being fitted out for France. I went up to the office, and was admitted to Mr. Dana's
presence. I fancy I must have appealed to his sense of the ludicrous, dressed in top-boots
and a linen duster much the worse for wear, and demanding to be sent out to fight. He knew
nothing about recruiting. Was I French?  No, Danish; it had been in his paper about the regiment.
He smiled a little at my faith, and said editors sometimes did not know about everything that
was in their papers. I turned to go, grievously disappointed, but he called me back.

"Have you," he said, looking searchingly at me, "have you had your breakfast?"

No, God knows that I had not: neither that day nor for many days before. That was one of the
things I had at last learned to consider among the superfluities of an effete civilization.
I suppose I had no need of telling it to him, for it was plain to read in my face. He put his
hand in his pocket and pulled out a dollar.

"There," he said, "go and get your breakfast; and better give up the war."

Give up the war! and for a breakfast. I spurned the dollar hotly.

"I came here to enlist, not to beg money for breakfast," I said, and strode out of the office,
my head in the air but my stomach crying out miserably in rebellion against my pride. I revenged
myself upon it by leaving my top-boots with the "uncle," who was my only friend and relative
here, and filling my stomach upon the proceeds. I had one good dinner anyhow, for when I got
through there was only twenty-five cents left of the dollar I borrowed upon my last article
of "dress." That I paid for a ticket to Perth Amboy, near which place I found work in Pfeiffer's
clay-bank.

Pfeiffer was a German, but his wife was Irish and so were his hands, all except a giant Norwegian
and myself. The third day was Sunday, and was devoted to drinking much beer, which Pfeiffer,
with an eye to business, furnished on the premises.  When they were drunk, the tribe turned
upon the Norwegian, and threw him out. It seems that this was a regular weekly occurrence.
Me they fired out at the same time, but afterward paid no attention to me. The whole crew of
them perched on the Norwegian and belabored him with broomsticks and bale-sticks until they
roused the sleeping Berserk in him. As I was coming to his relief, I saw the human heap heave
and rock. From under it arose the enraged giant, tossed his tormentors aside as if they were
so much chaff, battered down the door of the house in which they took refuge, and threw them
all, Mrs. Pfeiffer included, through the window. They were not hurt, and within two hours they
were drinking more beer together and swearing at one another endearingly. I concluded that
I had better go on, though Mr. Pfeiffer regretted that he never paid his hands in the middle
of the month. It appeared afterward that he objected likewise to paying them at the end of
the month, or at the beginning of the next. He owes me two days' wages yet.

CHAPTER III

I GO TO WAR AT LAST AND SOW THE SEED OF FUTURE CAMPAIGNS

At sunset on the second day after my desertion of Pfeiffer I walked across a footbridge into
a city with many spires, in one of which a chime of bells rang out a familiar tune. The city
was New Brunswick. I turned down a side street where two stone churches stood side by side.
A gate in the picket fence had been left open, and I went in looking for a place to sleep.
Back in the churchyard I found what I sought in the brownstone slab covering the tomb of, I
know now, an old pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church, who died full of wisdom and grace. I
am afraid that I was not overburdened with either, or I might have gone to bed with a full
stomach too, instead of chewing the last of the windfall apples that had been my diet on my
two days' trip; but if he slept as peacefully under the slab as I slept on it, he was doing
well. I had for once a dry bed, and brownstone keeps warm long after the sun has set. The night
dews and the snakes, and the dogs that kept sniffing and growling half the night in the near
distance, had made me tired of sleeping in the fields. The dead were much better company. They
minded their own business, and let a fellow alone.

Before sun-up I was on the tow-path looking for a job. Mules were in demand there, not men.
The drift caught me once more, and toward evening cast me up at a country town then called
Little Washington, now South River. How I got there I do not now remember. My diary from those
days says nothing about it. Years after, I went back over that road and accepted a "lift" from
a farmer going my way. We passed through a toll-gate, and I wondered how the keeper came to
collect uneven money. We were two men and two horses. When I came back the day after, I found
out. So many cents, read the weather-beaten sign that swung from the gate, for team and driver,
so many for each additional beast. I had gone through as an additional beast.

A short walk from Little Washington I found work in Peftit's brick-yard at $22 a month and
board. That night, when I turned in after a square meal, in an old wagon I had begged for a
bed, I felt like a capitalist. I took to the wagon because one look within the barracks had
shown them to be impossible. Whether it was that, or the fact that most of the other hands
were Germans, who felt in duty bound to celebrate each victory over the French as it was reported
day by day, and so provoked me to wrath--from the first we didn't get on. They made a point
whenever they came back from their celebrations in the village, of dragging my wagon, with
me fast asleep in it, down into the river, where by and by the tide rose and searched me out.
Then I had to swim for it. That was of less account. Our costume was not elaborate,--a pair
of overalls, a woollen shirt, and a straw hat, that was all, and a wetting was rather welcome
than otherwise; but they dubbed me Bismarck, and that was not to be borne. My passionate protest
only made them laugh the louder. Yet they were not an ill-natured lot, rather the reverse.
Saturday afternoon was our wash-day, when we all sported together in peace and harmony in the
river.  When we came out, we spread our clothes to dry on the roof of the barracks, while we
burrowed each in a hill of white sand, and smoked our pipes far into the night, with only our
heads and the hand that held the pipe sticking out. That was for protection against mosquitoes.
It must have been a sight, one of those Saturday night confabs, but it was solid comfort after
the wreek's work.

Bricks are made literally while the sun shines.  The day begins with the first glimmer of light
in the east, and is not over till the "pits" are worked out. It was my task to cart clay in
the afternoon to fill them up again. It was an idle enough kind of job. All I had to do was
to walk alongside my horse, a big white beast with no joints at all except where its legs were
hinged to the backbone, back it up to the pit, and dump the load. But, walking so in the autumn
sun; I fell a-dreaming. I forgot claybank and pit. I was back in the old town--saw her play
among the timber. I met her again on the Long Bridge. I held her hands once more in that last
meeting--the while I was mechanically backing my load up to the pit and making ready to dump
it. Day-dreams are out of place in a brickyard.  I forgot to take out the tail-board. To my
amazement, I beheld the old horse skating around, making frantic efforts to keep its grip on
the soil, then slowly rise before my bewildered gaze, clawing feebly at the air as it went
up and over, backwards into the pit, load, cart and all.

I wish for my own reputation that I could truly say I wept for the poor beast. I am sure I
felt for it, but the reproachful look it gave me as it lay there on its back, its four feet
pointing skyward, was too much. I sat upon the edge of the pit and shouted with laughter, feeling
thoroughly ashamed of my levity. Mr. Pettit himself checked it, running in with his boys and
demanding to know what I was doing. They had seen the accident from the office, and at once
set about getting the horse out.  That was no easy matter. It was not hurt at all, but it had
fallen so as to bend one of the shafts of the truck like a bow. It had to be sawed in two to
get the horse out. When that was done, the heavy ash stick, rebounding suddenly, struck one
of the boys, who stood by, a blow on the head that laid him out senseless beside the cart.

It was no time for laughter then. We ran for water and restoratives, and brought him to, white
and weak. The horse by that time had been lifted to his feet and stood trembling in every limb,
ready to drop. It was a sobered driver that climbed out of the pit at the tail end of the procession
which bore young Pettit home. I spent a miserable hour hanging around the door of the house
waiting for news of him. In the end his father came out to comfort me with the assurance that
he would be all right. I was not even discharged, though I was deposed from the wagon to the
command of a truck of which I was myself the horse. I "ran out" brick from the pit after that
in the morning.

More than twenty years after, addressing the students of Rutgers College, I told them of my
experience in the brick-yard which was so near them. At the end of my address a gentleman came
up to me and said, with a twinkle in his eye:

"So that was you, was it? My name is Pettit, and I work the brick-yard now. I helped my father
get that horse out of the pit, and I have cause to remember that knock on the head." He made
me promise sometime to tell him what happened to me since, and if he will attend now he will
have it all.

I had been six weeks in the brick-yard when one day I heard of a company of real volunteers
that was ready to sail for France, and forthwith the war fever seized me again. That night
I set out for Little Washington, and the next morning's steamer bore me past the brick-yard,
where the German hands dropped their barrows and cheered me on with a howl of laughter that
was yet not all derision. I had kept my end up with them and they knew it. They had lately
let my sleeping-car alone in the old barn. Their shouts rang in my ears, nevertheless, when
I reached New York and found that the volunteers were gone, and that I was once more too late.
I fell back on the French Consul then, but was treated very cavalierly there. I suppose I became
a nuisance, for when I called the twelfth or twentieth time at the office in Bowling Green,
he waxed wroth with sudden vehemence and tried to put me out.

Then ensued the only fight of the war in which I was destined to have a part, and that on the
wrong side. My gorge rose at these continual insults.  I grabbed the French Consul by the nose,
and in a moment we were rolling down the oval stairs together, clawing and fighting for all
we were worth.  I know it was inexcusable, but consider the provocation; after all I had sacrificed
to serve his people, to be put out the second time like a beggar and a tramp! I had this one
chance of getting even, and that I took it was only human. The racket we made on the stairs
roused the whole house. All the clerks ran out and threw themselves upon me.  They tore me
away from the sacred person of the Consul and thrust me out into the street bleeding and with
a swollen eye to rage there, comforted only by the assurance that without a doubt both his
were black. I am a little ashamed--not very much--of the fact that it comforts me even now
to think of it. He really did me a favor, that Consul; but he was no good. He certainly was not.

It is to be recorded to the credit of my resolution, if not of my common sense, that even after
that I made two attempts to get over to France.  The one was with the captain of a French man-of-war
that lay in the harbor. He would not listen to me at all. The other, and the last, was more
successful. I actually got a job as stoker on a French steamer that was to sail for Havre that
day in an hour. I ran all the way down to Battery Place, where I had my valise in a boarding-house,
and all the way back, arriving at the pier breathless, in time to see my steamer swing out
in the stream beyond my reach. It was the last straw.  I sat on the stringpiece and wept with
mortification.  When I arose and went my way, the war was over, as far as I was concerned.
It was that in fact, as it speedily appeared. The country which to-day, after thirty years
of trial and bereavement, is still capable of the Dreyfus infamy, was not fit to hold what
was its own. I am glad now that I did not go, though I cannot honestly say that I deserve any
credit for it.

All my money was gone, and an effort I made to join a railroad gang in the Spuyten Duyvil cut
came to nothing. Again I reenforced my credit with my revolver and the everlasting top-boots,
but the two or three dollars they brought at the pawnshop were soon gone, and once more I was
turned out in the street. It was now late in the fall. The brick-making season was over. The
city was full of idle men. My last hope, a promise of employment in a human-hair factory, failed,
and, homeless and penniless, I joined the great army of tramps, wandering about the streets
in the daytime with the one aim of somehow stilling the hunger that gnawed at my vitals, and
fighting at night with vagrant curs or outcasts as miserable as myself for the protection of
some sheltering ash-bin or doorway.  I was too proud in all my misery to beg. I do not believe
I ever did. But I remember well a basement window at the down-town Delmonico's, the silent
appearance of my ravenous face at which, at a certain hour in the evening, always evoked a
generous supply of meat-bones and rolls from a white-capped cook who spoke French. That was
the saving clause. I accepted his rolls as instalments of the debt his country owed me, or
ought to owe me, for my unavailing efforts in its behalf.

It was under such auspices that I made the acquaintance of Mulberry Bend, the Five Points,
and the rest of the slum, with which there was in the years to come to be a reckoning. For
half a lifetime afterward they were my haunts by day and by night, as a police reporter, and
I can fairly lay claim, it seems to me, to a personal knowledge of the evil I attacked. I speak
of this because, in a batch of reviews of "A Ten Years' War" [Footnote: Now, "The Battle with
the Slum."] which came yesterday from my publishers to me there is one which lays it all to
"maudlin sensitiveness" on my part.

"The slum," says this writer, "is not at all so unspeakably vile," and measures for relief
based on my arraignment "must be necessarily abortive." Every once in a while I am asked why
I became a newspaper man. For one thing, because there were writers of such trash, who, themselves
comfortably lodged, have not red blood enough in their veins to feel for those to whom everything
is denied, and not sense enough to make out the facts when they see them, or they would not
call playgrounds, schoolhouses, and better tenements "abortive measures." Some one had to tell
the facts; that is one reason why I became a reporter. And I am going to stay one until the
last of that ilk has ceased to discourage men from trying to help their fellows by the shortest
cut they can find, whether it fits in a theory or not. I don't care two pins for all the social
theories that were ever made unless they help to make better men and women by bettering their
lot. I have had cranks of that order, who rated as sensible beings in the ordinary affairs
of life, tell me that I was doing harm rather than good by helping improve the lot of the poor;
it delayed the final day of justice we were waiting for. Not I.  I don't propose to wait an
hour for it, if I can help bring it on; and I know I can.

There! I don't believe I have read fifteen reviews of any of my books. Life is too short; but
I am glad I did not miss that one. Those are the fellows for whom Roosevelt is not a good enough
reformer; who chill the enthusiasm of mankind with a deadly chill, and miscall it method--science.
The science of how not to do a thing--yes!  They make me tired.

There was until last winter a doorway in Chatham Square, that of the old Barnum clothing store,
which I could never pass without recalling those nights of hopeless misery with the policeman's
periodic "Get up there! move on!" reenforced by a prod of his club or the toe of his boot.
I slept there, or tried to when crowded out of the tenements in the Bend by their utter nastiness.
Cold and wet weather had set in, and a linen duster was all that covered my back. There was
a woollen blanket in my trunk which I had from home--the one, my mother had told me, in which
I was wrapped when I was born; but the trunk was in the "hotel" as security for money I owed
for board, and I asked for it in vain. I was now too shabby to get work, even if there had
been any to get. I had letters still to friends of my family in New York who might have helped
me, but hunger and want had not conquered my pride. I would come to them, if at all, as their
equal, and, lest I fall into temptation, I destroyed the letters. So, having burned my bridges
behind me, I was finally and utterly alone in the city, with the winter approaching and every
shivering night in the streets reminding me that a time was rapidly coming when such a life
as I led could no longer be endured.

Not in a thousand years would I be likely to forget the night when it came. It had rained all
day, a cold October storm, and night found me, with the chill downpour unabated, down by the
North River, soaked through and through, with no chance for a supper, forlorn and discouraged.
I sat on the bulwark, listening to the falling rain and the swish of the dark tide, and thinking
of home. How far it seemed, and how impassable the gulf now between the "castle" with its refined
ways, between her in her dainty girlhood and me sitting there, numbed with the cold that was
slowly stealing away my senses with my courage. There was warmth and cheer where she was. Here--An
overpowering sense of desolation came upon me, I hitched a little nearer the edge. What if--?
Would they miss me much or long at home if no word came from me? Perhaps they might never hear.
What was the use of keeping it up any longer with, God help us, everything against and nothing
to back a lonely lad?

And even then the help came. A wet and shivering body was pressed against mine, and I felt
rather than heard a piteous whine in my ear. It was my companion in misery, a little outcast
black-and-tan, afflicted with fits, that had shared the shelter of a friendly doorway with
me one cold night and had clung to me ever since with a loyal affection that was the one bright
spot in my hard life. As my hand stole mechanically down to caress it, it crept upon my knees
and licked my face, as if it meant to tell me that there was one who understood; that I was
not alone. And the love of the faithful little beast thawed the icicles in my heart. I picked
it up in my arms and fled from the tempter; fled to where there were lights and men moving,
if they cared less for me than I for them--anywhere so that I saw and heard the river no more.

In the midnight hour we walked into the Church Street police station and asked for lodging.
The rain was still pouring in torrents. The sergeant spied the dog under my tattered coat and
gruffly told me to put it out, if I wanted to sleep there. I pleaded for it in vain. There
was no choice. To stay in the street was to perish. So I left my dog out on the stoop, where
it curled up to wait for me.  Poor little friend! It was its last watch. The lodging-room was
jammed with a foul and stewing crowd of tramps. A loud-mouthed German was holding forth about
the war in Europe, and crowding me on my plank. Cold and hunger had not sufficed to put out
the patriotic spark within me. It was promptly fanned into flame, and I told him what I thought
of him and his crew. Some Irishmen cheered and fomented trouble, and the doorman came in threatening
to lock us all up. I smothered my disgust at the place as well as I could, and slept, wearied
nearly to death.

In the middle of the night I awoke with a feeling that something was wrong. Instinctively I
felt for the little gold locket I wore under my shirt, with a part of the precious curl in
it that was my last link with home. It was gone. I had felt it there the last thing before
I fell asleep. One of the tramp lodgers had cut the string and stolen it. With angry tears
I went up and complained to the sergeant that I had been robbed. He scowled at me over the
blotter, called me a thief, and said that he had a good mind to lock me up. How should I, a
tramp boy, have come by a gold locket? He had heard, he added, that I had said in the lodging-room
that I wished the French would win, and he would only be giving me what I deserved if he sent
me to the Island. I heard and understood. He was himself a German. All my sufferings rose up
before me, all the bitterness of my soul poured itself out upon him. I do not know what I said.
I remember that he told the doorman to put me out. And he seized me and threw me out of the
door, coming after to kick me down the stoop.

My dog had been waiting, never taking its eyes off the door, until I should come out. When
it saw me in the grasp of the doorman, it fell upon him at once, fastening its teeth in his
leg. He let go of me with a yell of pain, seized the poor little beast by the legs, and beat
its brains out against the stone steps.

At the sight a blind rage seized me. Raving like a madman, I stormed the police station with
paving-stones from the gutter. The fury of my onset frightened even the sergeant, who saw,
perhaps, that he had gone too far, and he called two policemen to disarm and conduct me out
of the precinct anywhere so that he got rid of me. They marched me to the nearest ferry and
turned me loose. The ferry-master halted me. I had no money, but I gave him a silk handkerchief,
the last thing about me that had any value, and for that he let me cross to Jersey City. I
shook the dust of New York from my feet, vowing that I would never return, and, setting my
face toward the west, marched straight out the first railroad track I came to.

And now, right here, begins the part of my story that is my only excuse for writing down these
facts, though it will not appear for a while yet. The outrage of that night became, in the
providence of God, the means of putting an end to one of the foulest abuses that ever disgraced
a Christian city, and a mainspring in the battle with the slum as far as my share in it is
concerned. My dog did not die unavenged.

I walked all day, following the track, and in the afternoon crossed the long trestlework of
the Jersey Central Railroad over Newark Bay, with my face set toward Philadelphia. I had friends
there, distant relatives, and had at last made up my mind to go to them and ask them to start
me afresh. On the road which I had chosen for myself I had come to the jumping-off place. Before
night I found company in other tramps who had been over the road before and knew just what
towns to go around and which to walk through boldly. Rahway, if I remember rightly, was one
of those to be severely shunned. I discovered presently that I was on the great tramps' highway,
with the column moving south on its autumn hegira to warmer climes. I cannot say I fancied
the company. Tramps never had any attraction for me, as a sociological problem or otherwise.
I was compelled, more than once, to be of and with them, but I shook their company as quickly
as I could. As for the "problem" they are supposed to represent, I think the workhouse and
the police are quite competent to deal with that, provided it is not a Tammany police. It does
not differ appreciably from the problem of human laziness in any other shape or age. We got
some light on that, which ought to convince anybody, when under Mayor Strong's administration
we tried to deal intelligently with vagrancy. One-half of the homeless applicants for night
shelter were fat, well-nourished young loafers who wouldn't work.  That is not my statement,
but the report of the doctor who saw them stripped, taking their bath. The bath and the investigation
presently decreased their numbers, until in a week scarcely anything was left of the "problem"
that had bothered us so.

Four days I was on the way to Philadelphia, living on apples and an occasional meal earned
by doing odd jobs. At night I slept in lonely barns that nearly always had a board ripped out--the
tramps' door. I tried to avoid the gang, but I was not always successful. I remember still
with a shudder an instance of that kind. I was burrowing in a haymow, thinking myself alone.
In the night a big storm came up. The thunder shook the old barn, and I sat up wondering if
it would be blown away. A fierce lightning-flash filled it with a ghostly light, and showed
me within arm's length a white and scared face with eyes starting from their sockets at the
sight of me. The next moment all was black darkness again. My heart stood still for what seemed
the longest moment of my life. Then there came out of the darkness a quaking voice asking,
"Is anybody there?" For once I was glad to have a live tramp about. I really thought it was
a ghost.

The last few miles to Camden I rode in a cattle-car, arriving there at night, much the worse
for the wear of it on my linen duster. In the freight-yard I was picked up by a good-hearted
police captain who took me to his station, made me tell him my story, and gave me a bed in
an unused cell, the door of which he took the precaution to lock on the outside.  But I did
not mind. Rather that a hundred times than the pig-sty in the New York station-house.  In the
morning he gave me breakfast and money to get my boots blacked and to pay my fare across the
Delaware. And so my homeless wanderings came, for the time being, to an end. For in Philadelphia
I found in the Danish Consul, Ferdinand Myhlertz, and his dear wife, friends indeed as in need.
The City of Brotherly Love found heart and time to welcome the wanderer, though at the time
it was torn up by the hottest kind of fight over the question whether or not to disfigure the
beautiful square at Broad and Market streets by putting the new municipal building there.

When, after two weeks' rest with my friends, they sent me on my way to an old schoolmate in
Jamestown, N.Y., clothed and in my right mind, I was none the worse for my first lesson in
swimming against the current, and quite sure that next time I should be able to breast it.
Hope springs eternal at twenty-one. I had many a weary stretch ahead before I was to make port.
But with youth and courage as the equipment, one should win almost any fight.

CHAPTER IV

WORKING AND WANDERING

Winter came quickly up by the northern lakes, but it had no terror for me. For once I had shelter
and enough to eat. It found me felling trees on Swede Hill, where a considerable settlement
of Scandinavians was growing up. I had tried my hand at making cradles in a furniture-shop,
but at two dollars and forty cents per dozen there was not much profit in it. So I took to
the woods and learned to swing an axe in the American fashion that had charmed me so at Brady's
Bend. I liked it much better, anyway, than being in the house winter and summer. It is well
that we are fashioned that way, some for indoors and some for outdoors, for so the work of
the world is all done; but it has always seemed to me that the indoor folk take too big a share
of credit to themselves, as though there were special virtue in that, though I think that the
reverse is the case. At least it seems more natural to want to be out in the open where the
sun shines and the winds blow. When I was not chopping wood I was helping with the ice harvest
on the lake or repairing the steamer that ran in summer between Jamestown and Mayville. My
home was in Dexterville, a mile or so out of town, where there lived a Danish family, the Romers,
at whose home I was made welcome. The friendship which grew up between us has endured through
life and been to me a treasure. Gentler and truer hearts than those of Nicholas and John Romer
there are not many.

I shared my room with another countryman, Anthony Ronne, a young axe-maker, who, like myself,
was in hard luck. The axe-factory had burned down, and, with no work in sight, the outlook
for him was not exactly bright. He had not my way of laughing it off, but was rather disposed
to see the serious side of it. Probably that was the reason we took to each other; the balance
was restored so.  Maybe he sobered me down somewhat. If any one assumes that in my role of
unhappy lover I went about glooming and glowering on mankind, he makes a big mistake. Besides,
I had not the least notion of accepting that role as permanent. I was out to twist the wheel
of fortune my way when I could get my hands upon it. I never doubted that I should do that
sooner or later, if only I kept doing things. That Elizabeth should ever marry anybody but
me was preposterously impossible, no matter what she or anybody said.

Was this madness? They half thought so at home when they caught a glimpse of it in my letters.
Not at all. It was conviction--the conviction that shapes events and the world to its ends.
I know what I am talking about. If any one doubts it, and thinks his a worse case than mine,
let him try my plan. If he cannot muster up courage to do it, it is the best proof in the world
that she was right in refusing him.

To return to my chum; he, on his part, rose to the height even of "going out," but not with
me.  There was a physical obstacle to that. We had but one coat between us, a turned black
kersey, worn very smooth and shiny also on the wrong side, which I had bought of a second-hand
dealer in Philadelphia for a dollar. It was our full-dress, and we took turns arraying ourselves
in it for the Dexterville weekly parties. These gatherings interested me chiefly as outbreaks
of the peculiar American humor that was very taking to me, in and out of the newspapers. Dancing
being tabooed as immoral and contaminating, the young people had recourse to particularly energetic
kissing games, which more than made up for their deprivation on the other score. It was all
very harmless and very funny, and the winter wore away pleasantly enough in spite of hard luck
and hard work when there was any.

With the early thaw came change. My friends moved away to Buffalo, and I was left for two months
the sole occupant of the Romer homestead.  My last job gave out about that time, and a wheelbarrow
express which I established between Dexter-ville and the steamboat landing on the lake refused
to prosper. The idea was good enough, but I was ahead of my time: travel on the lake had not
yet begun. With my field thus narrowed down, I fell back on my gun and some old rat-traps I
found in the woodshed. I became a hunter and trapper. Right below me was the glen through which
the creek ran on its way to the sawmills and furniture-shops of Jamestown. It was full of musk-rats
that burrowed in its banks between the roots of dead hemlocks and pines. There I set my traps
and baited them with carrots and turnips. The manner of it was simple enough. I set the trap
on the bottom of the creek and hung the bait on a stick projecting from the bank over it, so
that to get at it the rat had to step on the trap. I caught lots of them. Their skins brought
twenty cents apiece in the town, so that I was really quite independent.  I made often as much
as a dollar overnight with my traps, and then had the whole day to myself in the hills, where
I waylaid many a fat rabbit or squirrel and an occasional bird.

The one thing that marred my enjoyment of this life of freedom was my vain struggle to master
the art of cookery in its elements. To properly get the hang of that, and of housekeeping in
general, two heads are needed, as I have found out since--one of them with curls and long eyelashes.
Then it is fine fun; but it is not good for man to tackle that job alone. Goodness knows I
tried hard enough. I remember the first omelet I made. I was bound to get it good. So I made
a muster-roll of all the good things Mrs. Romer had left in the house, and put them all in.
Eggs and strawberry jam and raisins and apple-sauce, and some sliced bacon--the way I had seen
mother do with "egg pancakes." But though I seasoned it liberally with baking-powder to make
it rise, it did not rise. It was dreadfully heavy and discouraging, and not even the strawberry
jam had power to redeem it. To tell the truth, it was not a good omelet. It was hardly fit
to eat. The jam came out to better advantage in the sago I boiled, but there was too much of
it. It was only a fruit-jar full, but I never saw anything swell so. It boiled out of the pot
and into another and another, while I kept pouring on water until nearly every jar in the house
was full of sago that stood around until moss grew on it with age.  There is much contrariness
in cooking. When I tapped my maples with the rest--there were two big trees in front of the
house--and tried to make sugar, I was prepared to see the sap boil away; but when I had labored
a whole day and burned half a cord of wood, and had for my trouble half a tea-cupful of sugar,
which made me sick into the bargain, I concluded that that game was not worth the candle, and
gave up my plans of becoming a sugar-planter on a larger scale.

It was at this time that I made my first appearance on the lecture platform. There was a Scandinavian
society in Jamestown, composed chiefly of workingmen whose fight with life had left them little
enough time for schooling. They were anxious to learn, however, and as I was set on teaching
where I saw the chance, the thing came of itself. I had been mightily interested in the Frenchman
Figuier's account of the formation and development of the earth, and took that for my topic.
Twice a week, when I had set my traps in the glen, I went to town and talked astronomy and
geology to interested audiences that gazed terror stricken at the loathsome saurians and the
damnable pterodactyl which I sketched on the blackboard. Well they might. I spared them no
gruesome detail, and I never could draw, anyhow. However, I rescued them from those beasts
in season, and together we hauled the earth through age-long showers of molten metal into the
sunlight of our day. I sometimes carried home as much as two or three dollars, after paying
for gas and hall, with the tickets ten cents apiece, and I saw wealth and fame ahead of me,
when sudden wreck came to my hopes and my career as a lecturer.

It was all because, having got the earth properly constructed and set up, as it were, I undertook
to explain about latitude and longitude. Figures came in there, and I was never strong at mathematics.
My education in that branch had run into a snag about the middle of the little multiplication
table. A boy from the "plebs" school challenged me to fight, as I was making my way to recitation,
trying to learn the table by heart. I broke off in the middle of the sixes to wallop him, and
never got any farther. The class went on that day without me, and I never overtook it. I made
but little effort. In the Latin School, which rather prided itself upon being free from the
commercial taint, mathematics was held to be in the nature of an intrusion, and it was a sort
of good mark for a boy that he did not take to it, if at the same time he showed aptitude for
language. So I was left to deplore with Marjorie Fleming to the end of my days the inherent
viciousness of sevens and eights, as "more than human nature can endure." It is one of the
ironies of life that I should have had to take up work into which the study of statistics enters
largely. But the powers that set me the task provided a fitter back than mine for that burden.
As I explained years ago in the preface to "How the Other Half Lives," the patient friendship
of Dr. Roger S. Tracy, the learned statistician of the Health Department, has smoothed the
rebellious kinks out of death-rates and population statistics, as of so many other knotty problems
which we have worked out together.

But I am getting out of my longitude, as I did then. When I had groped about long enough trying
to make my audience understand what I only half understood myself, an old sea-captain arose
in his place and said that any man who would make a mess of so simple a thing as latitude and
longitude evidently knew nothing at all. It happened to be the one thing he knew about. Popular
favor is a fickle thing. The audience that had but now been applauding my efforts to organize
the earth took his word for it without waiting for an explanation and went out in a body, scouting
even the ichthyosaurus as a prehistoric fake.

I made a valiant effort to stem the tide, but came to worse grief than before. My only listener
was a Swedish blacksmith who had attended the creation and development of the earth from the
beginning with unshaken faith, though he was a member of the Lutheran church, with the pastor
and deacons of which I had waged a bitter newspaper war over the "sin" of dancing. But when
I said, on the authority of Figuier, that an English man-of-war had once during an earthquake
been thrown into the city of Callao and through the roof of a church, between the walls of
which it remained standing upright on its keel, he got up and went too. He circulated the story
in town with various embellishments.  The deacons aforesaid seized upon it as welcome ammunition,
construing it into an insult to the church, and there was an end to my lecturing.

The warm spring weather, together with these disappointments, bred in me the desire to roam.
I packed away my traps and started for Buffalo with my grip, walking along the lake. It set
in with a drizzling rain, and I was soon wet to the skin. Where the Chautauqua summer school
grounds are now I surprised a flock of wild ducks near the shore, and was lucky enough to wound
one with my revolver. But the wind carried it out of my reach, and I trudged on supperless,
through Mayville, where the lights were beginning to shine in the windows. Not one of them
was for me. All my money had gone to pay back debts to my Dexterville landlady. The Danes had
a good name in Jamestown, and we were all very jealous of it. We would have starved, every
one of us, rather than leave unpaid debts behind. As Mrs. Ben Wah many years after put it to
me, "it is no disgrace to be poor, but it is sometimes very inconvenient." I found it so when,
worn out with walking, I crawled into an abandoned barn halfway to Westfield and dug down in
the hay, wet through and hungry as a bear. It stormed and rained all night, and a rat or a
squirrel fell from the roof on my face. It felt like a big sprawling hand, and woke me up in
a great fright.

The sun was shining upon a peaceful Sabbath when I crawled out of my hole and saw to my dismay
that I had been sleeping in a pile of old hay seed that had worked through and through my wet
clothes until I was a sight. An hour's patient plucking and a bath in a near-by pond restored
me to something like human shape, and I held my entry into Westfield. The people were going
to church in their holiday clothes, and eyed the uncouth stranger askance. I travelled the
whole length of the town thinking what to do next. My stomach decided for me. There was a house
standing in a pretty garden with two little cast-iron negro boys for hitching-posts at the
steps.  I rang the bell, and to an old lady who opened the door I offered to chop wood, fetch
water, or do anything there was to do in exchange for breakfast.  She went in and brought out
her husband, who looked me over and said that if I was willing to do his chores I need go no
farther. I was tired and famished, and the place was so restful that I said yes at once. In
ten minutes I was eating my breakfast in the kitchen, duly installed as Dr.  Spencer's hired man.

I think of the month I spent in the doctor's house with mingled feelings of exasperation and
amusement.  If I had not learned to milk a cow there, probably Octavia Ely would never have
come into my life, horrid nightmare that she was. Octavia Ely was a Jersey cow with a brass
tag in her ear, whose attacks upon the domestic peace of my house in after years even now fill
me with rage. In the twelve months of her sojourn with us she had fifteen different kinds of
disease, every one of which advertised itself by the stopping of her milk, When she had none,
she never once gave down the milk without grudging it. With three of us to hold her legs and
tail lest she step in the pail or switch our ears, she would reach back and eat the vest off
my back where I sat milking her. But she does not belong in this story, thank goodness!  If
she had never belonged to me or mine, I should be a better man to-day; she provoked me so.
However, I cannot reasonably lay the blame for her on the doctor. His cow was friendly enough.
It was Sport, the old dog, that made the heaviest and at the same time a most ludicrous item
in my duties as hired man. Long past the age of sport of any kind, he spent his decadent years
in a state of abject fear of thunder and lightning. If only a cloud darkened the sun, Sport
kept up a ceaseless pilgrimage between his corner and the kitchen door to observe the sky,
sighing most grievously at the outlook. At the first distant rumble--this was in the month
of May, when it thundered almost every day--he became perfectly rigid with terror. It was my
duty then to carry him down into the cellar and shut him in the wood-box, where he was out
of the way of it all. Poor Sport laid his head against my shoulder and wept great tears that
wrung peals of laughter from me and from the boys who always hung around to see the show.

One of these was just beginning the struggle with his Homer, which I knew by heart almost,
and it may have been the discovery that I was able to steer him through it between chores,
as well as to teach him some tricks of fencing, that helped make the doctor anxious that I
should promise to stay with him always. He would make me rich, he said. But other ambitions
than to milk cows and plant garden truck were stirring in me. To be rich was never among them.
I had begun to write essays for the magazines, choosing for my topic, for want of any other,
the maltreatment of Denmark by Prussia, which rankled fresh in my memory, and the duty of all
Scandinavians to rise up and avenge it. The Scandinavians would not listen when I wrote in
Danish, and my English outpourings never reached the publishers. I discovered that I lacked
words--they didn't pour; at which, in general discontentment with myself and all things, I
pulled up stakes and went to Buffalo. Only, this time I rode in a railway train, with money
in my pocket.

For all that, Buffalo received me with no more circumstance than it had done when I came there
penniless, on the way to the war, the year before. I piled boards in a lumber-yard until I
picked a quarrel with a tyrant foreman on behalf of a lot of green Germans whom he maltreated
most shamefully.  Then I was put out. A cabinet-maker in the "Beehive," a factory building
out in Niagara Street, hired me next to make bedsteads, and took me to board with him. In the
top story of the factory we fitted up a bedroom that was just large enough for one sitting
and two standing, so long as the door was not opened; then one of the two had to get out. It
mattered little, for the only visitor I had was a half-elderly countryman of mine whom they
had worked so hard in his childhood that he had never had a chance to go to school.  We two
labored together by my little lamp, and it was great fun to see him who had never known how
to read and write his own Danish make long strides in the strange tongue he spoke so singularly
well. When we were both tired out, we would climb up on the roof and lie there and look out
over the lake and the city where the myriad lights were shining, and talk of the old home and
old times.

Sometimes the new would crowd them out in spite of all. I remember that Fourth of July when
the salute from Fort Porter woke me up at sunrise and fired me with sudden patriotic ardor.
I jumped out of bed and grabbed my revolver. There was a pile of packing-boxes in the yard
below, and, knowing that there was no one around whom I could hurt, I made it my target and
fired away all my ammunition at it. It made a fine racket, and I was happy. A couple of days
later, when I was down in the yard, it occurred to me to look at the boxes to ascertain what
kind of a score I had made. A very good one. All the bullets had hit. The boxes looked like
so many sieves. Incidentally I found out that they were not empty, as I had supposed, but filled
with glass fruit-jars.

I had eventually to give that job up also, because my boss was "bad pay." He was pretty much
all bad, I guess. I do think his house was the most disorderly one I have ever come across.
Seven ill-favored children clamored about the table, fighting with their even more ill-favored
mother. She used to single out the one she wished to address by slamming a handful of string-beans,
or whatever greens might be at hand, across the table at him.  The youngster would fire it
back, and so they were en rapport with each other. The father was seldom sober at meals. When
he "felt funny," he would stealthily pour a glass of water down the nearest child's back and
then sit and chuckle over the havoc he had wrought. There followed a long and woful wail and
an instant explosion from the mother in this wise. I can hear her now. It was always the same:--

"Gott-himmel-donnerwetter-noch-emal-ich-will-de- mal-hole-du-spitzbub-eselskerl-wart'-nur-ich-schlag-
de-noch-todt-potz-sacrement!"

Whereupon, from sheer exhaustion all round, there was peace for at least five minutes.

Which reminds me of meeting Adler, my chum from Brady's Bend, in Buffalo. He had come up to
get a $1500 place, as he informed me. That would about satisfy him. That such jobs were waiting
by the score for an educated German in this barbarous land he never doubted for a moment. 
In the end he went to work in a rolling-mill at a dollar a day. Adler was ever a stickler for
etiquette.  In Brady's Bend we had very little of it. At mealtimes a flock of chickens used
to come into the summer kitchen where we ate, and forage around, to Adler's great disgust.
One day they deliberately flew up on the table, and fell to fighting with the boarders for
the food. A big Shanghai rooster trod in the butter and tracked it over the table. At the sight
Adler's rage knew no bounds. Seizing a half-loaf of bread, he aimed it at the rooster and felled
him in his tracks. The flock of fowl flew squawking out of the door. The women screamed, and
the men howled with laughter. Adler flourished another loaf and vowed vengeance upon bird or
beast that did not let the butter alone.

I have been often enough out of patience with the ways of the labor men which seem to me to
be the greatest hindrance to the success of their cause; but I am not in danger of forgetting
the other side which makes that cause--if for no other reason, because of an experience I had
in Buffalo that year.  In a planing-mill in which I had found employment I contracted with
the boss to plane doors, sandpaper them, and plug knot-holes at fifteen cents a door.  It was
his own offer, and I did the work well, better than it had been done before, so he said himself.
But when he found at the end of the week that I had made $15 where my slow-coach predecessor
had made only ten, he cut the price down to twelve cents. I objected, but in the end swallowed
my anger and, by putting on extra steam and working overtime, made $16 the next week. The boss
examined the work very carefully, said it was good, paid my wages, and cut down the price to
ten cents. He did not want his men to make over $10 a week, he said; it was not good for them.
I quit then, after giving him my opinion of him and of the chances of his shop. I do not know
where he may be now, but wherever he is, I will warrant that my prediction came true. There
is in Danish an old proverb, "Falsk slaar sin egen Herre paa Hals," which is to say that chickens
come home to roost, and that right in the end does prevail over might. The Lord Chief Justice
over all is not to be tricked. If the labor men will only remember that, and devote, let us
say, as much time to their duties as to fighting for their rights, they will get them sooner.
Which is not saying that there is not a time to strike. Witness my experience with the planing-mill
man.

I struck not only against him, but against the whole city of Buffalo. I shook the dust of it
from my feet and went out to work with a gang on a new railroad then being built through Cattaraugus
County--the Buffalo and Washington, I think. Near a village called Coonville our job was cut
out for us. We were twenty in the gang, and we were to build the line across an old dry river-bed
at that point. In the middle of the river there had once been a forest-clad island. This we
attacked with pickaxe and spade and carried it away piecemeal in our wheelbarrows. It fell
in with the hottest weather of the year. Down in the hollow where no wind blew it was utterly
unbearable. I had never done such work before, and was not built for it. I did my best to keep
up with the gang, but my chest heaved and my heart beat as though it would burst. There were
nineteen Irishmen in the gang--big, rough fellows who had picked me out, as the only "Dutchman,"
as the butt for their coarse jokes; but when they saw that the work was plainly too much for
me, the other side of this curiously contradictory, mischief-loving, and big-hearted people
came out. They invented a thousand excuses to get me out of the line. Water was certainly not
their daily diet, but they fell victims, one and all, to the most ravening thirst, which required
the despatching of me every hour to the spring a quarter of a mile away to fill the pail. If
they could not empty it quickly enough, they managed to upset it, and, to cover up the fraud,
cursed each other roundly for their clumsiness. Between whiles they worried me as ever with
their horseplay; but I had seen the real man behind it, and they might have called me Bismarck,
had they chosen, without offence.

The heat, the work, and the slave-driver of a foreman were too much for them even, and before
the end of a week the gang was broken and scattered wide. I was on the road again looking for
work on a farm. It was not to be had. Perhaps I did not try very hard. Sunday morning found
me spending my last quarter for breakfast in an inn at Lime Lake. When I had eaten, I went
out in the fields and sat with my back against a tree, and listened to the church-bells that
were ringing also, I knew, in my home four thousand miles away.  I saw the venerable Domkirke,
my father's gray head in his pew, and Her, young and innocent, in the women's seats across
the aisle. I heard the old pastor's voice in the solemn calm, and my tears fell upon her picture
that had called up the vision. It was as if a voice spoke to me and said to get up and be a
man; that if I wanted to win Elizabeth, to work for her was the way, and not idling my days
away on the road. And I got right up, and, setting my face toward Buffalo, went by the shortest
cut back to my work.

I walked day and night, pursued in the dark by a hundred skulking curs that lurked behind trees
until I came abreast of them and then sallied out to challenge my progress. I stoned them and
went on. Monday's setting sun saw me outside Buffalo, tired, but with a new purpose. I had
walked fifty miles without stopping or eating. I slept under a shed that night, and the very
next day found work at good wages on some steamers the Erie Railroad was then building for
the Lake Superior trade. With intervals of other employment when for any reason work in the
ship-yard was slack, I kept that up all winter, and became quite opulent, even to the extent
of buying a new suit of clothes, the first I had had since I landed. I paid off all my debts,
and quarrelled with all my friends about religion. I never had any patience with a person who
says "there is no God." The man is a fool, and therefore cannot be reasoned with. But in those
days I was set on converting him, as my viking forefathers did when from heathen they became
Christians--by fire and sword if need be.  I smote the infidels about me hip and thigh, but
there were a good many of them, and they kept springing up, to my great amazement. Probably
the constant warfare imparted a tinge of fierceness to that whole period of my life, for I
remember that one of my employers, a Roman Catholic builder, discharged me for disagreeing
with him about the saints, telling me that I was "too blamed independent, anyhow." I suspect
I must have been a rather unlovely customer, take it all together.  Still, every once in a
while it boils up in me yet against the discretion that has come with the years, and I want
to slam in after the old fashion. Seems to me we are in danger of growing stale with all our
soft speeches nowadays.

Things enough happened to take down my self-esteem a good many pegs. It was about this time
I made up my mind to go into the newspaper business.  It seemed to me that a reporter's was
the highest and noblest of all callings; no one could sift wrong from right as he, and punish
the wrong. In that I was right. I have not changed my opinion on that point one whit, and I
am sure I never shall. The power of fact is the mightiest lever of this or of any day. The
reporter has his hand upon it, and it is his grievous fault if he does not use it well. I thought
I would make a good reporter.  My father had edited our local newspaper, and such little help
as I had been of to him had given me a taste for the business. Being of that mind, I went to
the Courier office one morning and asked for the editor.  He was not in. Apparently nobody
was. I wandered through room after room, all empty, till at last I came to one in which sat
a man with a paste-pot and a pair of long shears. This must be the editor; he had the implements
of his trade. I told him my errand while he clipped away.

[Figure: When I worked in the Buffalo Ship-yard. ]

"What is it you want?" he asked, when I had ceased speaking and waited for an answer.

"Work," I said.

"Work!" said he, waving me haughtily away with the shears; "we don't work here. This is a newspaper
office."

I went, abashed. I tried the Express next.  This time I had the editor pointed out to me. He
was just coming through the business office. At the door I stopped him and preferred my request.
He looked me over, a lad fresh from the shipyard, with horny hands and a rough coat, and asked:--

"What are you?"

"A carpenter," I said.

The man turned upon his heel with a loud, rasping laugh and shut the door in my face. For a
moment I stood there stunned. His ascending steps on the stairs brought back my senses. I ran
to the door, and flung it open. "You laugh!" I shouted, shaking my fist at him, standing halfway
up the stairs, "you laugh now, but wait--" And then I got the grip of my temper and slammed
the door in my turn. All the same, in that hour it was settled that I was to be a reporter.
I knew it as I went out into the street.

CHAPTER V

I GO INTO BUSINESS, HEADLONG

Somewhat suddenly and quite unexpectedly, a business career opened for me that winter. Once
I had tried to crowd into it uninvited, but the result was not good. It was when I had observed
that, for the want of the window reflectors which were much in use in the old country, American
ladies were at a disadvantage in their homes in not being able to make out undesirable company
at a distance, themselves unseen, and conveniently forgetting that they were "in." This civilizing
agency I set about supplying forthwith. I made a model and took it to a Yankee business man,
to whom I explained its use. He listened attentively, took the model, and said he had a good
mind to have me locked up for infringing the patent laws of other lands; but because I had
sinned from ignorance he would refrain. His manner was so impressive that he really made me
uneasy lest I had broken some kind of a law I knew not of. From the fact that not long after
window reflectors began to make their appearance in Buffalo, I infer that, whatever the enactment,
it did not apply to natives, or else that he was a very fearless man, willing to take the risk
from which he would save me--a sort of commercial philanthropist. However, by that time I had
other things to think of, being a drummer and a very energetic one.

It came about in this way: some countrymen of mine had started a cooperative furniture-factory
in Jamestown, where there were water-power and cheap lumber. They had no capital, but just
below was the oil country, where everybody had money, slathers of it. New wells gushed every
day, and boom towns were springing up all along the Allegheny valley. Men were streaming into
it from everywhere, and needed furniture. If once they got the grip on that country, reasoned
the furniture-makers, they would get rich quickly with the rest.  The thing was to get it.
To do that they needed a man who could talk. Perhaps they remembered the creation of the world
the year before. At all events, they sent up to Buffalo and asked me if I would try.

I slammed my tool-box shut and started for Jamestown on the next train. Twenty-four hours later
saw me headed for the oil country, equipped with a mighty album and a price-list. The album
contained pictures of the furniture I had for sale.  All the way down I studied the price-list,
and when I reached Titusville I knew to a cent what it cost my employers per foot to make ash
extension tables. I only wish they had known half as well.

My first customer was a grumpy old shopkeeper who needed neither tables nor bedsteads, so he
said. But I had thought it all over and made up my mind that the first blow was half the battle.
Therefore I knew better. I pushed my album under his nose, and it fell open at the extension
tables. Cheap, I said, and rattled off the price. I saw him prick up his ears, but he only
growled that probably they were no good.

What! my extension tables no good? I dared him to try them, and he gave me an order for a dozen,
but made me sign an agreement that they were to be every way as represented. I would have backed
my tables with an order for the whole shop, so sure was I that they could not be beaten. The
idea! With the fit of righteous indignation upon me, I went out and sold every other furniture-dealer
in Titusville a bill of tables; not one of them escaped. At night, when I had sent the order
home, I set out for Oil City, so as to lose no valuable time.

It was just the same there. For some reason they were suspicious of the extension tables, yet
they wanted nothing else. I had to give ironclad guarantees that they were as represented,
which I did impatiently enough. There was a thunder storm raging at the time. The lightning
had struck a tank, and the burning oil ran down a hill and set the town on fire.  One end of
it was burning while I was canvassing the other, mentally calculating how many extension tables
would be needed to replace those that were lost.  People did not seem to have heard of any
other kind of furniture in that country.  Walnut bed-steads, marble-top bureaus, turned washstands--they
passed them all by to fall upon the tables with shrill demand. I made out their case to suit
the facts, as I swept down through that region, scattering extension tables right and left.
It was the excitement, I reasoned, the inrush of population from everywhere; probably everybody
kept boarders, more every day; had to extend their tables to seat them.  I saw a great opportunity
and resolutely grasped it.  If it was tables they wanted, tables it should be. I let all the
rest of the stock go and threw myself on the tables exclusively. Town after town I filled with
them. Night after night the mails groaned under the heavy orders for extension tables I sent
north. From Allegheny City alone an order of a thousand dollars' worth from a single reputable
dealer went home, and I figured in my note-book that night a commission of $50 for myself plus
my salary.

I could know nothing of the despatches that were hot on my trail ever since my first order
came from Titusville, telling me to stop, let up on the tables, come home, anything; there
was a mistake in the price. They never overtook me. My pace was too hot for that. Anyhow, I
doubt if I would have paid any attention to them. I had my instructions and was selling according
to orders.  Business was good, getting better every day. The firm wrote to my customers, but
they merely sent back copies of the iron-clad contract. They had seen my instructions, and
they knew it was all right. It was not until I brought up, my last penny gone, in Rochester,
near the Ohio line, that the firm established communication with me at last. Their instructions
were brief: to come home and sell no more tables. They sent $10, but gave me no clew to their
curious decision, with things booming as they were.

Being in the field I considered that, whatever was up, I had a better command of the situation.
I decided that I would not go home,--at least not until I had sold a few more extension tables
while they were in such demand. I made that $10 go farther than $10 ever went before. It took
me a little way into Ohio, to Youngstown, and then back to Pennsylvania, to Warren and Meadville
and Corry. My previous training in going hungry for days came in handy at last. In the interests
of commerce, I let my dinners go. So I was enabled to make a final dash to Erie, where I planted
my last batch of tables before I went home, happy.

I got home in time to assist in the winding up of the concern. The iron-clad contracts had
done the business. My customers would not listen to explanations. When told that the price
of those tables was lower than the cost of working up the wood, they replied that it was none
of their business.  They had their contracts. The Allegheny man threatened suit, if I remember
rightly, and the firm gave up. Nobody blamed me, for I had sold according to orders; but instead
of $450 which I had figured out as my commission, I got seventy-five cents. It was half of
what my employer had.  He divided squarely, and I could not in reason complain.

I sat in the restaurant where he had explained the situation to me, and tried to telescope
my ambitions down to the seventy-five-cent standard, when my eyes fell upon a copy of Harper's
Weekly that lay on the table. Absent-mindedly I read an advertisement in small type, spelling
it over idly while I was trying to think what to do next.

"Wanted," it read, "by the Myers Manufacturing Company, agents to sell a patent flat and fluting
iron. Samples 75 cents."

The address was somewhere in John Street, New York. Samples seventy-five cents! I repeated
it mechanically.  Why, that was just the size of my pile.  And right in my line of canvassing,
too! In ten minutes it was on the way to New York and I had secured a provisional customer
in the cook at the restaurant for an iron that would perform what this one promised, iron the
skirt and flute the flounce too. In three days the iron came and proved good.  I started in
canvassing Jamestown with it, and in a week had secured orders for one hundred and twenty,
upon which my profit would be over $80.  Something of business ways must have stuck to me,
after all, from my one excursion into the realm of trade; for when it came to delivering the
goods and I had no money, I went boldly to a business man whose wife was on my books, and offered,
if he would send for the irons, to pay for them as I took them out of the store. He made no
bones about it, but sent for the irons and handed them over to me to pay for when I could.
So men are made. Commercial character, as it is rated on 'change, I had none before that; but
I had after.  How could I disappoint a man like that?

The confidence of the community I had not lost through my too successful trip as a drummer,
at all events. Propositions came speedily to me to "travel in" pianos and pumps for local concerns.
It never rains but it pours. An old schoolmate who had been ordained a clergyman wrote to me
from Denmark to find him a charge among the Danish settlements out West. But neither pumps,
pianos, nor parsons had power to swerve me from my chosen course. With them went bosses and
orders; with the flat-iron cherished independence. When I had sold out Jamestown, I made a
bee-line for Pittsburg, a city that had taken my fancy because of its brisk business ways.
They were brisk indeed.  Grant's second campaign for the Presidency was in full swing. On my
second night in town I went to hear Horace Greeley address an open-air meeting.  I can see
his noble old head yet above the crowd, and hear his opening appeal. Farther I never got. A
marching band of uniformed shouters for Grant had cut right through the crowd. As it passed
I felt myself suddenly seized; an oilcloth cape was thrown over my head, a campaign cap jammed
after, and I found myself marching away with a torch on my shoulder to the tune of a brass
band just ahead. How many others of Mr. Greeley's hearers fared as I did I do not know. The
thing seemed so ludicrous (and if I must march I really cared very little whether it was for
Greeley or Grant) that I stuck it out, hoping as we went to come somewhere upon my hat, which
had been lost in the sudden attack; but I never saw it again.

Speaking of parading, my old desire to roam, that kept cropping out at intervals, paid me a
characteristic trick at this time. I was passing through a horse-market when I saw a fine-looking,
shapely young horse put up at what seemed a ridiculously low price. Eighteen dollars was the
bid, and it was about to be knocked down at that. The October sun was shining warm and bright.
A sudden desire to get on the horse and ride out into the wide world, away from the city and
the haunts of men, never to come back, seized me. I raised the bid to $19. Almost before I
knew, the beast was knocked down to me and I had paid over the money. It left me with exactly
$6 to my name.

Leading the animal by the halter, I went down the street and sat on the stoop of the Robinson
House to think. With every step, perplexities I hadn't thought of sprang up. In the first place,
I could not ride. I had always wanted to, but had never learned. Even if I had been able to,
where was I going, and to do what? I couldn't ride around and sell flat-irons. The wide world
seemed suddenly a cold and far-off place, and $6 but small backing in an attack upon it, with
a hungry horse waiting to be fed. That was only too evident.

The beast was tearing the hitching-post with its teeth in a way that brooked no delay. Evidently
it had a healthy appetite. The conclusion was slowly dawning upon me that I had made a fool
of myself, when the man who had bid $18 came by and saw me sitting there. He stopped to ask
what was the matter, and I told him frankly. He roared and gave me $18 for the beast. I was
glad enough to give it up. I never owned a horse before or since, and I had that less than
fifteen minutes; but it was the longest quarter of an hour since I worked in the coal-mine.

The flat-iron did not go in Pittsburg. It was too cheap. During a brief interval I peddled
campaign books, but shortly found a more expensive iron, and had five counties in western Pennsylvania
allotted to me as territory. There followed a winter of great business. Before it was half
over I had achieved a bank account, though how I managed it is a mystery to me till this day.
Simple as the reckoning of my daily trade ought to be, by no chance could I ever make it foot
up as it should.  I tried honestly every night, but the receipts would never square with the
expenditures, do what I might. I kept them carefully apart in different pockets, but mixed
they would get in spite of all.  I had to call it square, however far the footing was out of
the way, or sit up all night, which I would not do. I remember well the only time I came out
even. I was so astonished that I would not believe it, but had to go all over the account again.
That night I slept the sleep of the just. The next morning, when I was starting out on my route
with a clean conscience and a clean slate, a shopkeeper rapped on his window as I went by to
tell me that I had given him the previous day a twenty-dollar bill for a ten, in making change.
After that I gave up trying.

I was no longer alone. From Buffalo my old chum Ronne had come, hearing that I was doing well,
to join me, and from Denmark an old schoolfellow, whose life at twenty-two had been wrecked
by drink and who wrote begging to be allowed to come. His mother pleaded for him too, but it
was not needed. He had enclosed in his letter the strongest talisman of all, a letter written
by Elizabeth in the long ago when we were children together.  I have it yet. He came, and I
tried hard to break him of his failing. But I had undertaken a job that was too big for me.
Upon my return from a Western trip I found that he had taken to drinking again, and in his
cups had enlisted. His curse followed him into the army. He rose to the rank of sergeant, only
to fall again and suffer degradation.  The other day he shot himself at the post where he was
stationed, after nearly thirty years of service. Yet in all his ups and downs he never forgot
his home. While his mother lived he helped support her in far-off Denmark; and when she was
gone, no month passed that he did not send home the half of his wages for the support of his
crippled sister in the old town. Charles was not bad. He was a poor, helpless, unhappy boy,
who came to me for help, and I had none to give, God pity him and me.

The Western trip I spoke of was my undoing.  Puffed up by my success as a salesman, I yielded
in an evil hour to the blandishments of my manufacturers, and accepted the general agency of
the State of Illinois, with headquarters in Chicago. It sounded well, but it did not work well.
Chicago had not yet got upon its feet after the great fire; and its young men were too sharp
for me. In six weeks they had cleaned me out bodily, had run away with my irons and with money
they borrowed of me to start them in business. I returned to Pittsburg as poor as ever, to
find that the agents I had left behind in my Pennsylvania territory had dealt with me after
the same fashion. The firm for which I worked had connived at the frauds. My friends had left
me.  The one I spoke of was in the army. Ronne had given up in discouragement, and was at work
in a rolling-mill. In the utter wreck of all my hopes I was alone again.

Angry and sore, I went up the Allegheny River, with no definite purpose in mind except to get
away from everybody I knew. At Franklin I fell ill with a sneaking fever. It was while I lay
helpless in a lonely tavern by the riverside that the crushing blow fell. Letters from home,
sent on from Pittsburg, told me that Elizabeth was to be married. A cavalry officer who was
in charge of the border police, a dashing fellow and a good soldier, had won her heart. The
wedding was to be in the summer. It was then the last week in April. At the thought I turned
my face to the wall, and hoped that I might die.

But one does not die of love at twenty-four. The days that passed slowly saw me leave my sick-bed
and limp down to the river on sunny days, to sit and watch the stream listlessly for hours,
hoping nothing, grasping nothing, except that it was all over. In all my misadventures that
was the one thing I had never dreamed of. If I did, I as quickly banished the thought as preposterous.
That she should be another's bride seemed so utterly impossible that, sick and feeble as I
was, I laughed it to scorn even then; whereat I fell to reading the fatal letter again, and
trying to grasp its meaning. It made it all only the more perplexing that I should not know
who he was or what he was. I had never heard of him before, in that town where I thought I
knew every living soul. That he must be a noble fellow I knew, or he could not have won her;
but who--why--what--what had come over everything in such a short time, and what was this ugly
dream that was setting my brain awhirl and shutting out the sunlight and the day? Presently
I was in a relapse, and it was all darkness to me, and oblivion.

When at last I got well enough to travel, I set my face toward the east, and journeyed on foot
through the northern coal regions of Pennsylvania by slow stages, caring little whither I went,
and earning just enough by peddling flat-irons to pay my way. It was spring when I started;
the autumn tints were on the leaves when I brought up in New York at last, as nearly restored
as youth and the long tramp had power to do. But the restless energy that had made of me a
successful salesman was gone. I thought only, if I thought at all, of finding some quiet place
where I could sit and see the world go by that concerned me no longer. With a dim idea of being
sent into the farthest wilds as an operator, I went to a business college on Fourth Avenue
and paid $20 to learn telegraphing. It was the last money I had. I attended the school in the
afternoon. In the morning I peddled flat-irons, earning money for my board, and so made out.

One day, while I was so occupied, I saw among the "want" advertisements in a newspaper one
offering the position of city editor on a Long Island City weekly to a competent man. Something
of my old ambition stirred within me. It did not occur to me that city editors were not usually
obtained by advertising, still less that I was not competent, having only the vaguest notions
of what the functions of a city editor might be. I applied for the job, and got it at once.
Eight dollars a week was to be my salary; my job, to fill the local column and attend to the
affairs of Hunter's Point and Blissville generally, politics excluded. The editor attended
to that. In twenty-four hours I was hard at work writing up my then most ill-favored bailiwick.
It is none too fine yet, but in those days, when every nuisance crowded out of New York found
refuge there, it stunk to heaven.

Certainly I had entered journalism by the back door, very far back at that, when I joined the
staff of the Review. Signs of that appeared speedily, and multiplied day by day. On the third
day of my employment I beheld the editor-in-chief being thrashed down the street by an irate
coachman whom he had offended, and when, in a spirit of loyalty, I would have cast in my lot
with him, I was held back by one of the printers with the laughing comment that that was his
daily diet and that it was good for him. That was the only way any one ever got any satisfaction
or anything else out of him. Judging from the goings on about the office in the two weeks I
was there, he must have been extensively in debt to all sorts of people who were trying to
collect. When, on my second deferred pay-day, I met him on the stairs, propelled by his washerwoman,
who brought her basket down on his head with every step he took, calling upon the populace
(the stairs were outside the building) to witness just punishment meted out to him for failing
to pay for the washing of his shirts, I rightly concluded that the city editor's claim stood
no show. I left him owing me two weeks' pay, but I freely forgive him. I think I got my money's
worth of experience. I did not let grass grow under my feet as "city editor." Hunter's Point
had received for once a thorough raking over, and I my first lesson in hunting the elusive
item and, when found, making a note of it.

Except for a Newfoundland pup which some one had given me, I went back over the river as poor
as I had come. The dog proved rather a doubtful possession as the days went by. Its appetite
was tremendous, and its preference for my society embarrassingly unrestrained. It would not
be content to sleep anywhere else than in my room. If I put it out in the yard, it forthwith
organized a search for me in which the entire neighborhood was compelled to take part, willy-nilly.
Its manner of doing it boomed the local trade in hair-brushes and mantel bric-a-brac, but brought
on complications with the landlord in the morning that usually resulted in the departure of
Bob and myself for other pastures. Part with him I could not; for Bob loved me. Once I tried,
when it seemed that there was no choice. I had been put out for perhaps the tenth time, and
I had no more money left to provide for our keep. A Wall Street broker had advertised for a
watch-dog, and I went with Bob to see him. But when he would have counted the three gold pieces
he offered into my hand, I saw Bob's honest brown eyes watching me with a look of such faithful
affection that I dropped the coins as if they burned, and caught him about the neck to tell
him that we would never part.  Bob put his huge paws on my shoulders, licked my face, and barked
such a joyous bark of challenge to the world in general that even the Wall Street man was touched.

"I guess you are too good friends to part," he said. And so we were.

We left Wall Street and its gold behind to go out and starve together. Literally we did that
in the days that followed. I had taken to peddling books, an illustrated Dickens issued by
the Harpers, but I barely earned enough by it to keep life in us and a transient roof over
our heads. I call it transient because it was rarely the same two nights together, for causes
which I have explained. In the day Bob made out rather better than I. He could always coax
a supper out of the servant at the basement gate by his curvetings and tricks, while I pleaded
vainly and hungrily with the mistress at the front door. Dickens was a drug in the market.
A curious fatality had given me a copy of "Hard Times" to canvass with. I think no amount of
good fortune could turn my head while it stands in my bookcase. One look at it brings back
too vividly that day when Bob and I had gone, desperate and breakfastless, from the last bed
we might know for many days, to try to sell it and so get the means to keep us for another
twenty-four hours.

It was not only breakfast we lacked. The day before we had had only a crust together. Two days
without food is not good preparation for a day's canvassing. We did the best we could. Bob
stood by and wagged his tail persuasively while I did the talking; but luck was dead against
us, and "Hard Times" stuck to us for all we tried. Evening came and found us down by the Cooper
Institute, with never a cent. Faint with hunger, I sat down on the steps under the illuminated
clock, while Bob stretched himself at my feet. He had beguiled the cook in one of the last
houses we called at, and his stomach was filled. From the corner I had looked on enviously.
For me there was no supper, as there had been no dinner and no breakfast. Tomorrow there was
another day of starvation.  How long was this to last? Was it any use to keep up a struggle
so hopeless? From this very spot I had gone, hungry and wrathful, three years before when the
dining Frenchmen for whom I wanted to fight thrust me forth from their company. Three wasted
years! Then I had one cent in my pocket, I remembered. Today I had not even so much. I was
bankrupt in hope and purpose. Nothing had gone right; nothing would ever go right; and, worse,
I did not care. I drummed moodily upon my book. Wasted! Yes, My life was wasted, utterly wasted.

A voice hailed me by name, and Bob sat up, looking attentively at me for his cue as to the
treatment of the owner of it. I recognized in him the principal of the telegraph school where
I had gone until my money gave out. He seemed suddenly struck by something.

"Why, what are you doing here?" he asked. I told him Bob and I were just resting after a day
of canvassing.

"Books!" he snorted. "I guess they won't make you rich. Now, how would you like to be a reporter,
if you have got nothing better to do?  The manager of a news agency down town asked me to-day
to find him a bright young fellow whom he could break in. It isn't much--$10 a week to start
with. But it is better than peddling books, I know."

He poked over the book in my hand and read the title. "Hard Times," he said, with a little
laugh.  "I guess so. What do you say? I think you will do. Better come along and let me give
you a note to him now."

As in a dream, I walked across the street with him to his office and got the letter which was
to make me, half-starved and homeless, rich as Crusus, it seemed to me. Bob went along, and
before I departed from the school a better home than I could give him was found for him with
my benefactor. I was to bring him the next day. I had to admit that it was best so. That night,
the last which Bob and I spent together, we walked up and down Broadway, where there was quiet,
thinking it over.  What had happened had stirred me profoundly.  For the second time I saw
a hand held out to save me from wreck just when it seemed inevitable; and I knew it for His
hand, to whose will I was at last beginning to bow in humility that had been a stranger to
me before. It had ever been my own will, my own way, upon which I insisted. In the shadow of
Grace Church I bowed my head against the granite wall of the gray tower and prayed for strength
to do the work which I had so long and arduously sought and which had now come to me; the while
Bob sat and looked on, saying clearly enough with his wagging tail that he did not know what
was going on, but that he was sure it was all right.  Then we resumed our wanderings. One thought,
and only one, I had room for. I did not pursue it; it walked with me wherever I went: She was
not married yet. Not yet. When the sun rose, I washed my face and hands in a dog's drinking-trough,
pulled my clothes into such shape as I could, and went with Bob to his new home. That parting
over, I walked down to 23 Park Row and delivered my letter to the desk editor in the New York
News Association, up on the top floor.

He looked me over a little doubtfully, but evidently impressed with the early hours I kept,
told me that I might try. He waved me to a desk, bidding me wait until he had made out his
morning book of assignments; and with such scant ceremony was I finally introduced to Newspaper
Row, that had been to me like an enchanted land. After twenty-seven years of hard work in it,
during which I have been behind the scenes of most of the plays that go to make up the sum
of the life of the metropolis, it exercises the old spell over me yet.  If my sympathies need
quickening, my point of view adjusting, I have only to go down to Park Row at eventide, when
the crowds are hurrying homeward and the City Hall clock is lighted, particularly when the
snow lies on the grass in the park, and stand watching them awhile, to find all things coming
right. It is Bob who stands by and watches with me then, as on that night.

The assignment that fell to my lot when the book was made out, the first against which my name
was written in a New York editor's book, was a lunch of some sort at the Astor House. I have
forgotten what was the special occasion. I remember the bearskin hats of the Old Guard in it,
but little else. In a kind of haze, I beheld half the savory viands of earth spread under the
eyes and nostrils of a man who had not tasted food for the third day.  I did not ask for any.
I had reached that stage of starvation that is like the still centre of a cyclone, when no
hunger is felt. But it may be that a touch of it all crept into my report; for when the editor
had read it, he said briefly:--

"You will do. Take that desk, and report at ten every morning, sharp."

That night, when I was dismissed from the office, I went up the Bowery to No. 185, where a
Danish family kept a boarding-house up under the roof. I had work and wages now, and could
pay. On the stairs I fell in a swoon and lay there till some one stumbled over me in the dark
and carried me in.  My strength had at last given out.

So began my life as a newspaper man.

CHAPTER VI

IN WHICH I BECOME AN EDITOR AND RECEIVE MY FIRST LOVE LETTER

I had my hands full that winter. The profession I had entered by so thorny a path did not prove
to be a bed of roses. But I was not looking for roses.  I doubt if I would have known what
to do with them had there been any. Hard work and hard knocks had been my portion heretofore,
and I was fairly trained down to that. Besides, now that the question where the next meal was
to come from did not loom up whichever way I looked, the thing for me was to be at work hard
enough and long enough to keep from thinking. With every letter from home I expected to hear
that she was married, and then--I never got any farther. A furious kind of energy took possession
of me at the mere idea, and I threw myself upon my work in a way that speedily earned for me
the name of a good reporter.  "Good" had reference to the quantity of work done rather than
to the quality of it. That was of less account than our ability to "get around" to our assignments;
necessarily so, for we mostly had six or seven of an evening to attend, our route extending
often from Harlem clear down to the Bowery.  So that they were nearly "on a line," we were
supposed to have no cause of complaint. Our office sold news to morning and evening papers
both, and our working day, which began at 10 A.M., was seldom over until one or two o'clock
the next morning.  Three reporters had to attend to all the general news of the city that did
not come through the regular department channels.

A queerly assorted trio we were: "Doc" Lynch, who had graduated from the medical school to
Bohemia, following a natural bent, I suppose; Crafts, a Maine boy of angular frame and prodigious
self-confidence; and myself. Lynch I have lost sight of long ago. Crafts, I am told, is rich
and prosperous, the owner of a Western newspaper.  That was bound to happen to him. I remember
him in the darkest days of that winter, when to small pay, hard work, and long hours had been
added an attack of measles that kept him in bed in his desolate boarding-house, far from kindred
and friends. "Doc" and I had run in on a stolen visit to fill their place as well as we might.
We sat around trying to look as cheerful as we could and succeeding very poorly; but Crafts's
belief in himself and his star soared above any trivialities of present discouragement. I see
him now rising on his elbow and transfixing the two of us with long, prophetic forefinger:--

"The secret of my success," he said, impressively, "I lay to--"

We never found out to what he laid it, for we both burst out laughing, and Crafts, after a
passing look of surprise, joined in. But that finger prophesied truly. His pluck won the day,
and won it fairly. They were two good comrades in a tight place. I shouldn't want any better.

Running around was only working off steam, of which we had plenty. The long rides, on Harlem
assignments, in horse-cars with straw in the bottom that didn't keep our feet from freezing
until all feeling in them was gone, were worse, a good deal.  At the mere thought of them I
fall to nursing my toes for reminiscent pangs. However, I had at least enough to eat. At the
downtown Delmonico's and the other swell restaurants through the windows of which I had so
often gazed with hungry eyes, I now sometimes sat at big spreads and public dinners, never
without thinking of the old days and the poor fellows who might then be having my hard luck.
It was not so long since that I could have forgotten.  I bit a mark in the Mulberry Bend, too,
as my professional engagements took me that way, promising myself that the day should come
when I would have time to attend to it. For the rest, if I had an hour to spare, I put it in
at the telegraph instrument. I had still the notion that it might not be labor lost.  And though
I never had professional use for it, it did come handy to me as a reporter more than once.
There is scarcely anything one can learn that will not sooner or later be useful to a newspaper
man, if he is himself of the kind that wants to be useful.

Along in the spring some politicians in South Brooklyn who had started a weekly newspaper to
boom their own fortunes found themselves in need of a reporter, and were told of a "young Dutchman"
who might make things go. I was that "Dutchman." They offered me $15 a week, and on May, 20,
1874, I carried my grip across the river, and, all unconscious that I was on the turning tide
in my fortunes, cast in my lot with "Beecher's crowd," as the boys in the office said derisively
when I left them.

In two weeks I was the editor of the paper.  That was not a vote of confidence, but pure economy
on the part of my owners. They saved forty dollars a week by giving me twenty-five and the
name of editor. The idea of an editor in anything but the name I do not suppose had ever entered
their minds. Theirs was an "organ," and for the purposes for which they had started it they
thought themselves abundantly able to run it. I, on my part, quickly grew high notions of editorial
independence. Their purposes had nothing to do with it. The two views proved irreconcilable.
They clashed quite regularly, and perhaps it was as much that they were tired of the editor
as that the paper was a drag upon them that made them throw it up after the fall elections,
in which they won. The press and the engine were seized for debt. The last issue of the South
Brooklyn News had been put upon the street, and I went to the city to make a bargain with the
foundryman for the type. It was in the closing days of the year. Christmas was at the door,
with its memories. Tired and disheartened, I was on my way back, my business done, as the bells
rang in the Holy Eve. I stood at the bow of a Fulton Street ferryboat listening sadly to them,
and watched the lights of the city kindling alongshore. Of them all not one was for me. It
was all over, and I should have to strike a new trail. Where would that lead? What did it matter,
anyhow? Nobody cared. Why should I?  A beautiful meteor shot out of the heavens overhead and
spanned the river with a shining arc. I watched it sail slowly over Williamsburg, its trail
glowing bright against the dark sky, and mechanically the old wish rose to my lips. It was
a superstition with us when we were children that if we were quick enough to "wish out" before
the star was extinguished, the wish would come true. I had tried a hundred times, always to
fail; but for once I had ample time. A bitter sigh smothered the wish, half uttered. My chance
had come too late. Even now she might be another man's wife, and I--I had just made another
failure of it, as usual.

It had never happened in all the holiday seasons I had been away that a letter from home had
reached me in time for Christmas Eve, and it was a sore subject with me. For it was ever the
dearest in the year to me, and is now. But that evening, when I came home, in a very ill humor,
for the first time I found the coveted letter. It told me of the death of my two older brothers
and of my favorite aunt. In a postscript my father added that Lieutenant B----, Elizabeth's
affianced husband, had died in the city hospital at Copenhagen. She herself was living among
strangers.  She had chosen her lover when the family demanded of her that she give him up as
a hopeless invalid. They thought it all for her good. Of her I should have expected nothing
less. But she shall tell the story of that herself.

I read the letter through, then lay down upon my bed and wept. When I arose, it was to go to
the owners of my paper with a proposition to buy it.  They laughed at me at first; asked to
see my money. As a reporter for the news bureau I had saved up $75, rather because I had no
time to spend it than with any definite notion of what I was going to do with it. This I offered
to them, and pointed out that the sale of the old type, which was all that was left of the
paper beside the goodwill, would bring no more. One of them, more reasonable than the rest--the
one who had generally paid the scores while the others took the tricks--was disposed to listen.
The upshot of it was that I bought the paper for $650, giving notes for the rest, to be paid
when I could. If I could not, they were not much out. And then, again, I might succeed.

I did; by what effort I hesitate to set down here lest I be not believed. The News was a big
four-page sheet. Literally every word in it I wrote myself. I was my own editor, reporter,
publisher, and advertising agent. My pen kept two printers busy all the week, and left me time
to canvass for advertisements, attend meetings, and gather the news. Friday night the local
undertaker, who advertised in the paper and paid in kind, took the forms over to New York,
where the presswork was done. In the early morning hours I shouldered the edition--it was not
very large in those days--and carried it from Spruce Street down to Fulton Ferry, and then
home on a Fifth Avenue car. I recall with what inward rage I submitted to being held up by
every chance policeman and prodded facetiously in the ribs with remarks about the "old man's
millions," etc. Once or twice it boiled over and I was threatened with summary arrest. When
I got home, I slept on the counter with the edition for my pillow, in order to be up with the
first gleam of daylight to skirmish for newsboys. I gathered them in from street and avenue,
compelled them to come in if they were not willing, and made such inducements for them that
shortly South Brooklyn resounded with the cry of "News" from sunrise to sunset on Saturday.
The politicians who had been laughing at my "weekly funeral" beheld with amazement the paper
thrust under their noses at every step. They heard its praises, or the other thing, sung on
every hand. From their point of view it was the same thing: the paper was talked of. Their
utmost effort had failed of that. When, on June 5, Her birthday, I paid down in hard cash what
was left of the purchase sum and hoisted the flag over an independent newspaper, freed from
debt, they came around with honeyed speeches to make friends. I scarcely heard them. Deep down
in my soul a voice kept repeating unceasingly: Elizabeth is free! She is free, free! That night,
in the seclusion of my den, clutching grimly the ladder upon which I had at last got my feet,
I resolved that I would reach the top, or die climbing and found me sleepless, pouring out
my heart to her, four thousand miles away.

I carried the letter to the post-office myself, and waited till I saw it started on its long
journey. I stood watching the carrier till he turned the corner; then went back to my work.

To that work there had been added a fresh spur just when I was at last free from all trammels.
The other strongest of human emotions had been stirred within me. In a Methodist revival--it
was in the old Eighteenth Street Church--I had fallen under the spell of the preacher's fiery
eloquence.  Brother Simmons was of the old circuit-riders' stock, albeit their day was long
past in our staid community.  He had all their power, for the spirit burned within him; and
he brought me to the altar quickly, though in my own case conversion refused to work the prescribed
amount of agony. Perhaps it was because I had heard Mr. Beecher question the correctness of
the prescription. When a man travelling in the road found out, he said, that he had gone wrong,
he did not usually roll in the dust and agonize over his mistake; he just turned around and
went the other way. It struck me so, but none the less with deep conviction. In fact, with
the heat of the convert, I decided on the spot to throw up my editorial work and take to preaching.
But Brother Simmons would not hear of it.

[Footnote: Brother Simmons.  [The Rev. Ichabod Simmons.]]

"No, no, Jacob," he said; "not that. We have preachers enough. What the world needs is consecrated
pens."

Then and there I consecrated mine. I wish I could honestly say that it has always come up to
the high ideal set it then. I can say, though, that it has ever striven, toward it, and that
scarce a day has passed since that I have not thought of the charge then laid upon it and upon me.

The immediate result was a campaign for reform that made the town stare. It struck the politicians
first. They were Democrats, and I was running a Democratic paper. I did it con amore, too,
for it was in the days of the scandals of Grant's second term, and the disgrace of it was foul.
So far we were agreed. But it happened that the chief obstacle to Democratic success in the
Twenty-second Ward, where my paper was located, was the police captain of the precinct, John
Mackellar, who died the other day as Deputy Chief of the Borough of Brooklyn. Mackellar was
a Republican of a pronounced type and a good deal of a politician besides. Therefore he must
go. But he was my friend. I had but two in the entire neighborhood who really cared for me--Edward
Wells, clerk in a drug-store across the street, who was of my own age, and Mackellar. Between
us had sprung up a strong attachment, and I could not think of having Mackellar removed, particularly
as he had done nothing to deserve it. He was a good policeman.  I told the bosses so. They
insisted; pleaded political expedience. I told them I would not allow it, and when they went
ahead in spite of me, told the truth about it in my paper. The Twenty-second was really a Republican
ward. The attitude of the News killed the job.

The Democratic bosses were indignant.

"How can we run the ward with you acting that way?" they asked. I told them I did not care
if they didn't. I could run it better myself, it seemed.

They said nothing. They had other resources.  The chief of them--he was a judge--came around
and had a friendly talk with me. He showed me that I was going against my own interest. I was
just starting out in life. I had energy, education.  They were qualities that in politics were
convertible into gold, much gold, if I would but follow him and his fortunes.

"I never had an education," he said. "I need you. If you will stick to me, I will make you rich."

I think he meant it. He certainly could have done so had he chosen. He himself died rich. He
was not a bad fellow, as bosses go. But I did not like boss politics. And the bait did not
tempt me.  I never wanted to be rich. I am afraid it would make me grasping; I think I am built
that way.  Anyhow, it is too much bother. I wanted to run my own paper, and I told him so.

"Well," he said, "you are young. Think it over."

It was some time after that I read in a newspaper, upon returning from a hunting trip to Staten
Island, that I had been that day appointed an interpreter in my friend the judge's court, at
a salary of $100 a month. I went to him and asked him what it meant.

"Well," he said, "we need an interpreter. There are a good many Scandinavians and Germans in
my district. You know their language?"

"But," I protested, "I have no time to go interpreting police court cases. I don't want the
office."

He pushed me out with a friendly shoulder-pat.  "You go back and wait till I send for you.
We can lump the cases, and we won't need you every day."

In fact, they did not need me more than two or three times that month, at the end of which
I drew my pay with many qualms of conscience. My services were certainly not worth the money
I received.  Such is the soothing power of public "pap": on the second pay-day, though I had
performed even less service, I did not feel nearly so bad about it. My third check I drew as
a matter of course. I was "one of the boys" now, and treated with familiarity by men whom I
did not like a bit, and who, I am sure, did not like me. But the cordiality did not long endure.
It soon appeared that the interpreter in the judge's court had other duties than merely to
see justice done to helpless foreigners; among them to see things politically as His Honor
did. I did not. A ruction followed speedily--I think it was about our old friend Mackellar--that
wound up by his calling me an ingrate. It was a favorite word of his, as I have noticed it
is of all bosses, and it meant everything reprehensible. He did not discharge me; he couldn't.
I was as much a part of the court as he was, having been appointed under a State law. But the
power of the Legislature that had created me was invoked to kill me, and, for appearance's
sake, the office. Before it adjourned, the same Legislature resurrected the office, but not
me. So contradictory is human nature that by that time I was quite ready to fight for my "rights."
But for once I was outclassed. The judge and the Legislature were too many for me, and I retired
as gracefully as I could.

So ceased my career as a public officer, and forever. It was the only office I ever held, and
I do not want another. I am ashamed yet, twenty-five years after, of having held that one.
Because, however I try to gloss it over, I was, while I held it, a sinecurist, pure and simple.

However, it did not dampen my zeal for reform in the least. That encompassed the whole range
of my little world; nor would it brook delay even for a minute. It did not consider ways and
means, and was in nowise tempered with discretion.  Looking back now, it seems strange that
I never was made to figure in the police court in those days in another capacity than that
of interpreter.  Not that I did anything for which I should have been rightly jailed. But people
will object to being dragged by the hair even in the ways of reform.  When the grocer on my
corner complained that he was being ruined by "beats" who did not pay their bills and thereby
compelled him to charge those who did pay more, in order that he might live, I started in at
once to make those beats pay up. I gave notice, in a plain statement of the case in my editorial
columns, that they must settle their scores for the sake of the grocer and the general good,
or I would publish their names. I was as good as my word. I not only published the list of
them, but how much and how long they owed it, and called upon them to pay or move out of the ward.

Did they move? Well, no! Perhaps it was too much to expect. They were comfortable. They stayed
to poison the mind of the town against the man who was lying awake nights to serve it; in which
laudable effort they were ably seconded by the corner grocer. I record without regret the subsequent
failure of that tradesman. There were several things wrong with the details of my campaign,--for
one thing, I had omitted to include him among the beats,--but in its large lines we can all
agree that it was right. It was only another illustration of the difficulty of reducing high
preaching to practice. Instead of society hailing me as its saviour, I grew personally unpopular.
I doubt if I had another friend in the world beside the two I have mentioned. But the circulation
of my paper grew enormously. It was doubled and trebled week by week--a fact which I accepted
as public recognition of the righteousness of my cause. I was wrong in that. The fact was that
ours was a community of people with a normally healthy appetite for knowing one's neighbor's
business. I suppose the thing has been mistaken before by inexperience for moral enthusiasm,
and will be again.

I must stop here to tell the reason why I would not convict the meanest thief on circumstantial
evidence. I would rather let a thousand go free than risk with one what I risked and shudder
yet to think of. There had been some public excitement that summer about mad dogs, especially
spitz-dogs.  A good many persons had been bitten, and the authorities of Massachusetts, if
I remember rightly, had put that particular breed under the ban as dangerous at all times.
There was one always prowling about the lot behind my office, through which the way led to
my boarding-house, and, when it snapped at my leg in passing one day, I determined to kill
it in the interest of public safety. I sent my office-boy out to buy a handful of buckshot,
and, when he brought it, set about loading both barrels of the fowling-piece that stood in
my office. While I was so occupied, my friend the drug-clerk came in, and wanted to know what
I was up to. Shooting a dog, I said, and he laughed:--

"Looks as though you were going gunning for your beats."

I echoed his laugh thoughtlessly enough; but the thing reminded me that it was unlawful to
shoot within the city limits, and I sent the boy up to the station to tell the captain to never
mind if he heard shooting around: I was going out for a dog. With that I went forth upon my quest.

The dog was there; but he escaped before I could get a shot at him. He dodged, growling and
snapping, among the weeds, and at last ran into a large enclosed lot in which there were stacks
of lumber and junk and many hiding-places. I knew that he could not get out, for the board
fence was high and tight. So I went in and shut the door after me, and had him.

I should have said before that among my enemies was a worthless fellow, a hanger-on of the
local political machine, who had that afternoon been in the office annoying me with his loud
and boisterous talk. He was drunk, and as there were some people to see me, I put him out.
He persisted in coming back, and I finally told him, in the hearing of a dozen persons, to
go about his business, or some serious harm would befall him. If I connected any idea with
it, it was to call a policeman; but I left them to infer something worse, I suppose. Getting
arrested was not very serious business with him. He went out, swearing.

It was twilight when I began my still-hunt for the spitz in the lumber lot, and the outlines
of things were more or less vague; but I followed the dog about until at last I made him out
standing on a pile of boards a little way off. It was my chance.  I raised the gun quickly
and took aim. I had both barrels cocked and my finger on the trigger, when something told me
quite distinctly not to shoot; to put down the gun and go closer. I did so, and found, not
the dog as I thought, but my enemy whom I had threatened but an hour or two before, asleep
at full length on the stack, with his coat rolled under his head for a pillow. It was his white
shirt-bosom which I had mistaken in the twilight for the spitz dog.

He never knew of his peril. I saw my own at a glance, and it appalled me. Stranger that I was,
hated and denounced by many who would have posed as victims of my violence; with this record
against me of threatening the man whom I would be accused of having slain an hour later; with
my two only friends compelled to give evidence which would make me out as artfully plotting
murder under the shield of a palpable invention--for who ever heard of any one notifying the
police that he was going to shoot a dog?--with no family connection or previous good character
to build a defence upon: where would have been my chance of escape? What stronger chain of
circumstantial evidence could have been woven to bring me, an innocent man, to the gallows?
I have often wished to forget that evening by the sleeping man in the lumber lot. I cannot
even now write calmly about it. Many months passed before I could persuade myself to touch
my gun, fond as I had always been of carrying it through the woods.

Of all this the beats knew nothing. They kept up their warfare of backbiting and of raising
petty ructions at the office when I was not there, until I hit upon the plan of putting Pat
in charge. Pat was a typical Irish coal-heaver, who would a sight rather fight than eat. There
was a coal office in the building, and Pat was generally hanging around, looking for a job.
I paid him a dollar a week to keep the office clear of intruders, and after that there was
no trouble. There was never any fighting, either. The mere appearance of Pat in the doorway
was enough, to his great disgust. It was a success as far as preserving the peace of the office
was concerned. But with it there grew up, unknown to me, an impression that personally I would
not fight, and the courage of the beats rose correspondingly.  They determined to ambush me
and have it out with me. One wintry Saturday night, when I was alone in the office closing
up the business of the week, they met on the opposite corner to see me get a thrashing. One
of their number, a giant in stature, but the biggest coward of the lot, was to administer it.
He was fitted out with an immense hickory club for the purpose, and to nerve his arm they filled
him with drink.

My office had a large window running the whole length of the front, with a sill knee-high that
made a very good seat when chairs were scarce. Only, one had to be careful not to lean against
the window. It was made of small panes set in a slight wooden framework, which every strong
wind blew out or in, and I was in constant dread lest the whole thing should collapse. On that
particular night the window was covered with a heavy hoarfrost, so that it was quite impossible
to see from outside what was going on within, or vice versa. From my seat behind the desk I
caught sight through the door, as it was opened by a chance caller, of the gang on the opposite
corner, with Jones and his hickory club, and knew what was coming. I knew Jones, too, and awaited
his debut as a fighter with some curiosity.

He came over, bravely enough, after the fifth or sixth drink, opened the door, and marched
in with the tread of a grenadier. But the moment it fell to behind him, he stood and shook
so that the club fairly rattled on the floor. Outside the gang were hugging their sides in
expectation of what was coming.

"Well, Jones," I said, "what is it?"

He mumbled something so tremulously and incoherently that I felt really sorry for him. Jones
was not a bad fellow, though he was in bad company just then. I told him so, and that it would
be best for him to go out quietly, or he might hurt himself.  He seemed to be relieved at the
suggestion, and when I went from behind the counter and led him toward the door, he went willingly
enough. But as I put my hand on the latch he remembered his errand, and, with a sudden plucking
up of courage at the thought of the waiting gang, he raised the stick to strike at me.

Honestly, I didn't touch the man with a finger.  I suppose he stumbled over the sill, as I
had sometimes done in my sober senses. Whatever the cause, he fell against the window, and
out with him it went, the whole of the glass front, with a crash that resounded from one end
of the avenue to the other, and brought neighbors and policemen, among them my friend the captain,
on a run to the store. In the midst of the wreck lay Jones, moaning feebly that his back was
broken. The beats crowded around with loud outcry.

"He threw him out of the window," they cried.  "We saw him do it! Through window and all, threw
him bodily! Did he not, Jones?"

Jones, who was being picked up and carried into my office, where they laid him on the counter
while they sent in haste for a doctor, nodded that it was so. Probably he thought it was. I
cannot even blame the beats. It must have seemed to them that I threw him out. They called
upon the captain with vehement demand to arrest me for murder. I looked at him; his face was
serious.

"Why, I didn't touch him," I said indignantly.  "He must have fallen."

"Fallen!" they shouted. "We saw him come flying through. Fallen! Look at the window!" And indeed
it was a sorry sight.

Dr. Howe came with his instrument box, and the crowd increased. The doctor was a young man
who had been very much amused by my battle with the beats, and, though he professed no special
friendship for me, had no respect for the others. He felt the groaning patient over, punched
him here and there, looked surprised, and felt again. Then he winked one eye at the captain and me.

"Jones," he said, "get up! There is nothing the matter with you. Go and get sober."

The beats stood speechless.

"He came right through this window," they began.  "We saw him--"

"Something has come through the window, evidently," said the captain, with asperity, "and broken
it. Who is to pay for it? If you say it was Jones, it is my duty to hold you as witnesses,
if Mr. Riis makes a charge of disorderly conduct against him, as I suppose he will." He trod
hard on my toe.  "A man cannot jump through another man's window like that. Here, let me--"

But they were gone. I never heard from them again. But ever after the reputation clung to me
of being a terrible fighter when roused. Jones swore to it, drunk or sober. Twenty witnesses
backed him up. I was able to discharge Pat that week. There was never an ill word in my street
after that. I suppose my renown as a scrapper survives yet in the old ward. As in the other
case, the chain of circumstantial evidence was perfect. No link was missing. None could have
been forged to make it stronger.

I wouldn't hang a dog on such evidence. And I think I am justified in taking that stand.

The summer and fall had worn away, and no word had come from home. Mother, who knew, gave no
sign. Every day, when the letter-carrier came up the street, my hopes rose high until he had
passed. The letter I longed for never came. It was farthest from my thoughts when, one night
in the closing days of a hot political campaign, I went to my office and found it lying there.
I knew by the throbbing of my heart what it was the instant I saw it. I think I sat as much
as a quarter of an hour staring dumbly at the unopened envelope. Then I arose slowly, like
one grown suddenly old, put it in my pocket, and stumbled homeward, walking as if in a dream.
I went up to my room and locked myself in.

It lies before me as I write, that blessed letter, the first love-letter I had ever received;
much faded and worn, and patched in many places to keep it together. The queer row of foreign
stamps climbing over one another--she told me afterward that she had no idea how many were
needed for a letter to America, and was afraid to ask, so she put on three times more than
would have been enough--and the address in her fair round hand,

Mr. Jacob A. Riis, Editor South Brooklyn News, Fifth Avenue cor. Ninth Street, Brooklyn, N.
Y, North America,

the postmark of the little town of Hadersleben, where she was teaching school, the old-fashioned
shape of the envelope--they all then and there entered into my life and became part of it,
to abide forever with light and joy and thanksgiving. How much of sunshine one little letter
can contain! Six years seemed all at once the merest breath of time to have waited for it.
Toil, hardship, trouble--with that letter in my keep? I laughed out loud at the thought. The
sound of my own voice sobered me. I knelt down and prayed long and fervently that I might strive
with all my might to deserve the great happiness that had come to me.

The stars were long out when my landlord, who had heard my restless walk overhead, knocked
to ask if anything was the matter. He must have seen it in my face when he opened the door,
for he took a sidelong step, shading his eyes from the lamp to get a better look, and held
out his hand.

"Wish you joy, old man," he said heartily.  "Tell us of it, will you?" And I did.

It is true that all the world loves a lover. It smiled upon me all day long, and I smiled back.
Even the beats looked askance at me no longer.  The politicians who came offering to buy the
influence of my paper in the election were allowed to escape with their lives. I wrote--I think
I wrote to her every day. At least that is what I do now when I go away from home. She laughs
when she tells me that in the first letter I spoke of coming home in a year. Meanwhile, according
to her wish, we were to say nothing about it. In the second letter I decided upon the following
spring. In the third I spoke of perhaps going in the winter. The fourth and fifth preferred
the early winter. The sixth reached her from Hamburg, on the heels of a telegram announcing
that I had that day arrived in Frisia.

What had happened was that just at the right moment the politicians had concluded, upon the
evidence of the recent elections, that they could not allow an independent paper in the ward,
and had offered to buy it outright. I was dreadfully overworked.  The doctor urged a change.
I did not need much urging. So I sold the paper for five times what I had paid for it, and
took the first steamer for home. Only the other day, when I was lecturing in Chicago, a woman
came up and asked if I was the Riis she had travelled with on a Hamburg steamer twenty-five
years before, and who was going home to be married. She had never forgotten how happy he was.
She and the rest of the passengers held it to be their duty to warn me that "She" might not
turn out as nice as I thought she was.

"I guess we might have spared ourselves the trouble," she said, looking me over.

Yes, they might. But I shall have to put off telling of that till next time. And I shall let
Elizabeth, my Elizabeth now, tell her part of it in her own way.

CHAPTER VII

ELIZABETH TELLS HER STORY

How well I remember the days of which my husband has written--our childhood in the old Danish
town where to this day, in spite of my love for America, the air seems fresher, the meadows
greener, the sea more blue, and where above it all the skylark sings his song clearer, softer,
and sweeter than anywhere else in the world! I--it is too bad that we cannot tell our own stories
without all the time talking about ourselves, but it is so, and there is no help for it. Well,
then, I was a happy little girl in those days. Though my own father, a county lawyer, had died
early and left my dear mother without any means of support for herself and three children except
what she earned by teaching school and music, it did not make life harder for me, for I had
been since I was three years old with mother's youngest and loveliest sister and her husband.
They were rich and prosperous.  They brought me up as their own, and never had a child a kinder
father and mother or a more beautiful home than I had with my uncle and aunt. Besides, I was
naturally a happy child.  Life seemed full of sunshine, and every day dawned with promise of
joy and pleasure. I remember often saying to my aunt, whom, by the way, I called mother, "I
am so happy I don't know what to do!"

So I skipped and danced about among the lumber in the sight of Jacob Riis, till, in sheer amazement,
he cut his finger off. He says admiration, not amazement, but I have my own ideas about that.
I see him yet with his arm in a sling and a defiant look, making his way across the hall at
dancing-school to engage me as his partner. I did not appreciate the compliment in the least,
for I would a good deal rather have had Charles, who danced well and was a much nicer looking
boy.  Besides, Charles's sister Valgerda had told me in confidence how Jacob had said to Charles
that he would marry me when I was a woman, or die. And was there ever such assurance? From
the day I learned of this, I treated Jacob with all the coolness and contempt of which my naturally
kindly disposition was capable. When he spoke to me I answered him hardly a word, and took
pains to show my preference for Charles or some other boy. But it seemed to make no difference
to him.

I was just seventeen when I received my first love-letter from Jacob. Like the dutiful fellow
he was, he sent it through his mother, to my mother, who read it before giving it to me. She
handed it to me with the words: "I need not tell you that neither father nor I would ever give
our consent to an engagement between you two till Jacob had some good position." Way down in
my heart there was a small voice whispering: "Well, if I loved him I wouldn't ask anybody."
But the letter was a beautiful one, and after these many years I know that every word in it
was prompted by true, unselfish love. I cried over it and answered it as best I could, and
then after a while forgot about it and was happy as ever with my studies, my music, and plenty
of dances and parties to break the routine. Jacob had gone away to America.

Before I was twenty years old I met one who was to have a great influence on my life. He was
a dashing cavalry officer, much older than I, and a frequent visitor at our home. And here
I must tell that my own dear mother had died when I was fifteen years old, and my brother and
sister had come to live with us in Ribe. There was house-room and heart-room for us all there.
They were very good to us, my uncle and aunt, and I loved them as if they were indeed my parents.
They spared no expense in our bringing up. Nothing they gave their only son was too good for
us. Our home was a very beautiful and happy one.

It was in the summer of 1872 that I met Raymond.  That is not a Danish name, but it was his.
He came to our little town as next in command of a company of gendarmes--mounted frontier police.
In the army he had served with my mother's brother, and naturally father and mother, whose
hospitable home welcomed every distinguished stranger, did everything to make his existence,
in what must to a man of the world have been a dull little town, less lonely than it would
otherwise have been. He had a good record, had been brave in the war, was the finest horseman
in all the country, could skate and dance and talk, and, best of all, was known to be a good
and loving son to his widowed mother, and greatly beloved by his comrades. So he came into
my life and singled me out before the other girls at the balls and parties where we frequently
met.  Strange as it may seem, for I was not a pretty girl, I had many admirers among the young
men in our town. Perhaps there wasn't really any admiration about it; perhaps it was just because
we knew each other as boys and girls and were brought up together.  Most of the young men in
our town were college students who had gone to school in Ribe and came back at vacation time
to renew old friendships and have a good time with old neighbors. I danced well, played the
piano well, and was full of life, and they all liked to come in our house, where there were
plenty of good things of all kinds. So I really ought not to say that I, who frequently cried
over the length of my nose, had admirers. I should rather say good friends, who saw to it in
their kindness that I never was a wall-flower at a ball, or lacked favors at a cotillon.

But he was so different. The others were young like myself. He had experience. He was a man,
handsome and good, just such a man as would be likely to take the fancy of a girl of my age.
And he, who had seen so many girls prettier and better than I, singled me out of them all;
and I--well, I was proud of the distinction, and I loved him.

How well I remember the clear winter day when he and I skated and talked, and talked and skated,
till the moon was high in the heavens, and my brother was sent out to look for me! I went home
that evening the happiest girl in the world, so I thought; for he had called me "a beautiful
child," and told me that he loved me. And father and mother had given their consent to our
engagement. Never did the sun shine so brightly, never did the bells ring out so clearly and
appealingly in the old Cathedral, and surely never was the world so beautiful as on the Sunday
morning after our engagement when I awoke early in my dear little room.  Oh, how I loved the
whole world and every one in it! how good God was, how kind and loving my father and mother
and brother and sisters! How I would love to be good to every one around me, and thus in a
measure show my gratitude for all the happiness that was mine!

So passed the winter and spring, with many preparations for our new home and much planning
for our future life. In a town like ours, where everybody knew all about everybody else from
the day they were born till the day they died, it was only reasonable to suppose that somebody
had told my betrothed about Jacob Riis's love for me. I had hoped that Jacob would learn to
look at me in a different light, but from little messages which came to me off and on from
the New World, I knew that he was just as faithful as ever to his idea that we were meant for
one another, and that "I might say him No time and time again, the day would come when I would
change my mind." But in the first happy days of our engagement I confess that I did not think
very much about him, except for mentioning him once or twice to my friend as a good fellow,
but such a queer and obstinate one, who some day would see plainly that I was not half as good
as he thought, and learn to love some other girl who was much better.

But one day there came a letter from America, and so far was Jacob from my thoughts at that
moment that, when my lieutenant asked me from whom did I think that American letter came, I
answered in perfect good faith that I could not imagine, unless it were from a former servant
of ours who lived over there.

"No servant ever wrote that address," said Raymond, dryly. It was from Jacob, and filled with
good wishes for us both. He listened to it in silence. I said how glad I was to find that at
last he looked upon me merely as a friend. "You little know how to read between the lines,"
was his sober comment. He was very serious, almost sad, it seemed to me.

In the early summer came the first cloud on my sunlit sky. One evening, when we were invited
to a party of young people at our doctor's house, word was sent from Raymond that he was sick
and could not come, but that I must on no account stay home. But I did. For me there was no
pleasure without him, no, not anywhere in the world. He recovered soon, however; but after
that, short spells of illness, mostly heavy colds, were the rule.  He was a strong man and
had taken pride in being able to do things which few other men could do without harm coming
to them; for instance, to chop a hole in the ice and go swimming in midwinter.  But exposure
to the chill, damp air of that North Sea country and the heavy fogs that drifted in from the
ocean at night, when he rode alone, often many miles over the moor on his tours of inspection,
had undermined his splendid constitution, and before the summer was over the doctors pronounced
my dear one a sufferer from bronchial consumption, and told us that his only chance lay in
his seeking a milder climate. I grieved at the thought of separation for a whole winter, perhaps
longer, and at his suffering; but I felt sure that he would come back to me from Switzerland
a well man.

So we parted. That winter we lived in our letters.  The fine climate in Montreux seemed to
do him good, and his messages were full of hope that all would be well. Not so with my parents.
They had been told by physicians who had treated Raymond that his case was hopeless; that he
might live years, perhaps, in Switzerland, but that in all probability to return to Denmark
would be fatal to him. They told me so, and I could not, would not, believe them. It seemed
impossible that God would take him away from me. They also told me that on no condition must
I think of marrying him, because either I should be a widow soon after marriage, or else I
should be a sick-nurse for several years. So they wished me to break the engagement while he
was absent.

This and much more was said to me. And I, who had always been an obedient daughter and never
crossed their will in any way, for the first time in my life opposed them and told them that
never should anybody separate me from the one I loved until God himself parted us. Mother reminded
me of my happy childhood, and of how much she and my foster-father had done for me, and that
now they had only my happiness in view--a fact which I might not understand till I was older,
she said, but must now take on trust. Beside which, Raymond would be made to feel as if a load
were taken off his mind if of my free will I broke our engagement and left him free from any
responsibility toward me. But all the time his letters told me that he loved me better than
ever, and I lived only in the hope of his home-coming. So I refused to listen to them. They
wrote to him; told him what the doctor said and appealed to him to set me free. And he, loyal
and good as he was, gave me back my promise. He believed he would get well. But he knew he
could not return to Ribe. He had resigned his command and gone back to the rank and pay of
a plain lieutenant. He could not offer me now such a home as I was used to these many years;
and as he was so much older than I, he thought it his duty to tell me all this. And all the
time he knew, oh, so well! that I would never leave him, come what might, sickness, poverty,
or death itself. I was bound to stand by him to the last.

That was a hard winter. Father and mother, who could not look into my heart and see that I
still loved them as dearly as ever--I know so well they meant it all for the best--called me
ungrateful and told me that I was blind and would not see what made for my good, and that therefore
they must take their own measures for my happiness. So they offered me the choice between giving
up the one I loved or leaving the home that had been mine so long. I chose the last, for I
could not do otherwise. I packed my clothes and said good-by to my friends, of whom many treated
me with coldness, since they, too, thought I must be ungrateful to those who had done so much
for me. Homeless and alone I went to Raymond's brother, who had a little country home near
the city of Copenhagen.  With him and his young wife I stayed until one day my Raymond returned,
much better apparently, yet not the same as before. Suffering, bodily and mental, had left
its traces upon his face and frame, but his love for me was greater than ever, and he tried
hard to make up to me all I lost; as if I had really lost anything in choosing him before all
the world.

We were very happy at first in the joy of being together. But soon he suffered a relapse, and
decided to go to the hospital for treatment. He never left it again, except once or twice for
a walk with me. All the long, beautiful summer days he spent in his room, the last few months
in bed.  Many friends came to see him, and as for me, I spent all my days with him, reading
softly to him or talking with him. And I never gave up hope of his getting better some day.
He probably knew that his time was short, but I think that he did not have the heart to tell
me. Sometimes he would say, "I wonder whether your people would take you back to your home
if I died." Or, "If I should die, and some other man who loved you, and who you knew was good
and faithful, should ask you to marry him, you ought to accept him, even if you did not love
him." I never could bear to hear it or to think of it then.

One raw, dark November morning I started on the long walk from his mother's house, where I
had stayed since he took to his bed, to go and spend the day with him as usual. By this time
I was well acquainted with every one in the hospital.  The nurses were good to me. They took
off my shoes and dried and warmed them for me, and some brought me afternoon coffee, which
otherwise was contraband in the sick-rooms. But this morning the nurse in charge of Raymond's
ward turned her back upon me and pretended not to hear me when I bid her good-morning. When
I entered his room, it was to find the lifeless body of him who only a few hours before had
bidden me a loving and even cheerful good-night.

Oh! the utter loneliness of those days; the longing for mother and home! But no word came from
Ribe then. My dear one was laid to rest, with the sweet, resigned smile on his brave face,
and I stayed for a while with his people, not being quite able to look into the future. My
father had meanwhile made provision for me at Copenhagen. When I was able to think clearly,
I went to the school in which my education had been "finished" in the happy, careless days,
and through its managers secured a position in Baron von D---'s house, not far from my old
home, but in the province that was taken from Denmark by Germany the winter I played in the
lumber-yard. My employers were kind to me, and my three girl pupils soon were the firm friends
of the quiet little governess with the sad face.  We worked hard together, to forget if I could.
But each day I turned my face to the west toward Ribe, and my heart cried out for my happy
childhood.

At last mother sent for me to come to them in the summer vacation. Oh, how good it was to go
home again! How nice they all were, and what quiet content I felt, though I knew I should never
forget! The six weeks went by like a dream. On the last day, as I was leaving, mother gave
me a letter from Jacob Riis, of whom I had not thought for a long while. It was a letter of
proposal, and I was angry. I answered it, however, as nicely as I could, and sent the letter
to his mother. Then I returned to my three pupils in their pleasant country home, and soon
we were busy with our studies and our walks. But I felt lonelier than ever, longed more than
ever for the days that had been and would never return. I could not sleep, and grew pale and
thin. And ever Raymond's words about a friend, good and faithful, who loved me truly, came
back to me. Did he mean Jacob, who had surely proved constant, and like me, had suffered much?
He was lonely and I was lonely, oh! so lonely! What if I were to accept his offer, and when
he came home go back with him to his strange new country to share his busy life, and in trying
to make him happy, perhaps find happiness myself? Unless I asked him to come, he would probably
never return. The thought of how glad it would make his parents if they could see him again,
now that they had buried two fine sons, almost tempted me.

Yet again, it was too soon, too soon. I banished the thought with angry impatience. But in
the still night watches it came and knocked again.  Jacob need not come home just now. We might
write and get acquainted, and get used to the idea of each other, and his old people could
look forward to the joy of having him return in a year or two.

At last, one night, I got up at two o'clock, sat down at my desk, and wrote to him in perfect
sincerity all that was in my mind concerning him, and that if he still would have me, I was
willing to go with him to America if he would come for me some time. Strange to say, Jacob's
mother had never sent the letter in which I refused him a second time. Perhaps she thought
his constancy and great love would at last touch my heart, longing as it was for somebody to
cling to. So that he got my last letter first. But instead of waiting several years, he came
in a few weeks. He was always that way.

And now, after twenty-five happy years--

ELISABETH. [Footnote: That is right. Up to this the printer has had his way. Now we will have
ours, she and I, and spell her name properly. Together we shall manage him.]

I cut the rest of it off, because I am the editor and want to begin again here myself, and
what is the use of being an editor unless you can cut "copy"? Also, it is not good for woman
to allow her to say too much. She has already said too much about that letter. I have got it
in my pocket, and I guess I ought to know. "Your own Elisabeth"--was not that enough? For him,
with his poor, saddened life, peace be to its memory! He loved her. That covers all. How could
he help it?

If they did not think I had lost my senses before, they assuredly did when that telegram reached
Ribe. Talk about the privacy of the mails (the telegraph is part of the post-office machinery
there), official propriety, and all that--why, I don't suppose that telegraph operator could
get his coat on quick enough to go out and tell the amazing news.  It would not have been human
nature, certainly not Ribe human nature. Before sundown it was all over town that Jacob Riis
was coming home, and coming for Elisabeth. Poor girl! It was in the Christmas holidays, and
she was visiting there.  She had been debating in her own mind whether to tell her mother,
and how; but they left her precious little time for debate. In a neighborhood gathering that
night one stern, uncompromising dowager transfixed her with avenging eye.

"They say Jacob Riis is coming home," she observed.  Elisabeth knitted away furiously, her
cheeks turning pink for all she made believe she did not hear.

"They say he is coming back to propose to a certain young lady again," continued the dowager,
pitilessly, her voice rising. There was the stillness of death in the room. Elisabeth dropped
a stitch, tried to pick it up, failed, and fled. Her mother from her seat observed with never-failing
dignity that it blew like to bring on a flood. You could almost hear the big cathedral bell
singing in the tower.  And the subject was changed.

But I will warrant that Ribe got no wink of sleep that night, the while I fumed in a wayside
Holstein inn. In my wild rush to get home I had taken the wrong train from Hamburg, or forgot
to change, or something. I don't to this day know what. I know that night coming on found me
stranded in a little town I had never heard of, on a spur of the road I didn't know existed,
and there I had to stay, raging at the railroad, at the inn, at everything. In the middle of
the night, while I was tossing sleepless on the big four-poster bed, a drunken man who had
gone wrong fell into my room with the door and a candle. That man was my friend. I got up and
kicked him out, called the landlord and blew him up, and felt much better. The sun had not
risen when I was posting back to the junction, counting the mile-posts as we sped, watch in hand.

If mother thought we had all gone mad together, there was certainly something to excuse her.
Here she had only a few weeks before forwarded with a heavy heart to her son in America Elisabeth's
flat refusal to hear him, and when she expected gloom and despair, all at once his letters
overflowed with a hysterical happiness that could only hail from a disordered mind. To cap
it all, Christmas Eve brought her the shock of her life. Elisabeth, sitting near her in the
old church and remorsefully watching her weep for her buried boys, could not resist the impulse
to steal up behind, as they were going out, and whisper into her ear, as she gave her a little
vicarious hug: "I have had news from Jacob. He is very happy." The look of measureless astonishment
on my mother's face, as she turned, recalled to her that she could not know, and she hurried
away, while mother stood and looked after her, for the first time in her life, I verily believe,
thinking hard things of a fellow-being--and of her! Oh, mother! could you but have known that
that hug was for your boy!

Counting hours no longer, but minutes, till I should claim it myself, I sat straining my eyes
in the dark for the first glimmer of lights in the old town, when my train pulled up at a station
a dozen miles from home. The guard ran along and threw open the doors of the compartments.
I heard voices and the cry:--

"This way, Herr Doctor! There is room in here," and upon the step loomed the tall form of our
old family physician. As I started up with a cry of recognition, he settled into a seat with
a contented--

"Here, Overlaerer, is one for you," and I was face to face with my father, grown very old and
white. My heart smote me at the sight of his venerable head.

"Father!" I cried, and reached out for him. I think he thought he saw a ghost. He stood quite
still, steadying himself against the door, and his face grew very pale. It was the doctor,
ever the most jovial of men, who first recovered himself.

"Bless my soul!" he cried, "bless my soul if here is not Jacob, come back from the wilds as
large as life! Welcome home, boy!" and we laughed and shook hands. They had been out to see
a friend in the country and had happened upon my train.

At the door of our house, father, who had picked up two of my brothers at the depot, halted
and thought.

"Better let me go in first," he said, and, being a small man, put the door of the dining-room
between me and mother, so that she could not see me right away.

"What do you think--" he began, but his voice shook so that mother rose to her feet at once.
How do mothers know?

"Jacob!" she cried, and, pushing past him, had me in her embrace.

That was a happy tea-table. If mother's tears fell as she told of my brothers, the sting was
taken out of her grief. Perhaps it was never there. To her there is no death of her dear ones,
but rejoicing in the midst of human sorrow that they have gone home where she shall find them
again. If ever a doubt had arisen in my mind of that home, how could it linger? How could I
betray my mother's faith, or question it?

Perfectly happy were we; but when the tea-things were removed and I began to look restlessly
at my watch and talk of an errand I must go, a shadow of anxiety came into my father's eyes.
Mother looked at me with mute appeal. They were still as far from the truth as ever. A wild
notion that I had come for some other man's daughter had entered their minds, or else, God
help me, that I had lost mine. I kissed mother and quieted her fears.

"I will tell you when I come back;" and when she would have sent my brothers with me: "No!
this walk I must take alone. Thank God for it."

So I went over the river, over the Long Bridge where I first met Her, and from the arch of
which I hailed the light in her window, the beacon that had beckoned me all the years while
two oceans surged between us; under the wild-rose hedge where I had dreamed of her as a boy,
and presently I stood upon the broad stone steps of her father's house, and rang the bell.

An old servant opened the door, and, with a grave nod of recognition, showed me into the room
to the left,--the very one where I had taken leave of her six years before,--then went unasked
to call "Miss Elisabeth." It was New Year's Eve, and they were having a card party in the parlor.

"Oh, it isn't--?" said she, with her heart in her mouth, pausing on the threshold and looking
appealingly at the maid. It was the same who years before had told her how I kept vigil under
her window.

"Yes! it is!" she said, mercilessly, "it's him," and she pushed her in.

I think it was I who spoke first.

"Do you remember when the ice broke on the big ditch and I had you in my arms, so, lifting
you over?"

"Was I heavy?" she asked, irrelevantly, and we both laughed.

Father's reading-lamp shone upon the open Bible when I returned. He wiped his spectacles and
looked up with a patiently questioning "Well, my boy?" Mother laid her hand upon mine.

"I came home," I said unsteadily, "to give you Elisabeth for a daughter. She has promised to
be my wife."

Mother clung to me and wept. Father turned the leaves of the book with hands that trembled
in spite of himself, and read:--

"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory for thy mercy--"

His voice faltered and broke.

The old town turned out, to the last man and woman, and crowded the Domkirke on that March
day, twenty-five years ago when I bore Her home my bride. From earliest morning the street
that led to "the Castle" had seen a strange procession of poor and aged women pass, carrying
flowers grown in window-gardens in the scant sunlight of the long Northern winter--"loved up,"
they say in Danish for "grown"; in no other way could it be done. They were pensioners on her
mother's bounty, bringing their gifts to the friend who was going away. And it was their flowers
she wore when I led her down the church aisle my wife, my own.

The Castle opened its doors hospitably at last to the carpenter's lad. When they fell to behind
us, with father, mother, and friends waving tearful good-bys from the steps, and the wheels
of the mail-coach rattled over the cobblestones of the silent streets where old neighbors had
set lights in their windows to cheer us on the way,--out into the open country, into the wide
world,--our life's journey had begun. Looking steadfastly ahead, over the bleak moor into the
unknown beyond, I knew in my soul that I should conquer. For her head was leaning trustfully
on my shoulder and her hand was in mine; and all was well.

It was no easy life to which I brought home my young wife.  I felt it often with a secret pang
when I thought how few friends I had to offer her for those she had left, and how very different
was the whole setting of her new home.  At such times I set my teeth hard and promised myself
that some day she should have the best in the land.  She never with word or look betrayed if
she, too, felt the pang.  We were comrades for better or worse from the day she put her hand
in mine, and never was there a more loyal and faithful one.  If, when in the twilight she played
softly to herself the old airs from home, the tune was smothered in a sob that was not for
my ear, and shortly our kitchen resounded with the most tremendously energetic housekeeping
on record, I did not hear.  I had drunk that cup to the dregs, and I knew.  I just put on a
gingham apron and turned in to help her.  Two can battle with a fit of homesickness much better
than one, even if never a word is said about it.  And it can very rarely resist a man with
an apron on. I suppose he looks too ridiculous.

Besides, housekeeping in double harness was a vastly different matter from going it single.
Not that it was plain sailing by any manner of means.  Neither of us knew anything about it;
but we were there to find out, and exploring together was fine fun. We started fair by laying
in a stock of everything there was in the cook-book and in the grocery, from "mace," which
neither of us knew what was, to the prunes which we never got a chance to cook because we ate
them all up together before we could find a place where they fitted in. The deep councils we
held over the disposal of those things, and the strange results which followed sometimes! Certain
rocks we were able to steer clear of, because I had carefully charted them in the days of my
bachelorhood.  In the matter of sago, for instance, which swells so when cooked. You would
never believe it. But there were plenty of unknown reefs. I mind our first chicken. I cannot
to this day imagine what was the matter with that strange bird.  I was compelled to be at the
office that afternoon, but I sent my grinning "devil," up to the house every half-hour for
bulletins as to how it was getting on. When I came home in the gloaming, it was sizzling yet,
and my wife was regarding it with a strained look and with cheeks which the fire had dyed a
most lovely red. I can see her now. She was just too charming for anything. With the chicken
something was wrong. As I said, I don't know what it was, and I don't care. The skin was all
drawn tight over the bones like the covering on an umbrella frame, and there was no end of
fat in the pan that we didn't know what to do with. But our supper of bread and cheese that
night was a meal fit for a king. My mother, who was a notable cook, never made one so fine.
It is all stuff about mothers doing those things better. Who cares, anyhow? Have mothers curls
of gold and long eyelashes, and have they arch ways? And do they pout, and have pet names?
Well, then, are not these of the very essence of cookery, all the dry books to the contrary
notwithstanding? Some day some one will publish a real cook-book for young housekeepers, but
it will be a wise husband with the proper sense of things, not a motherly person at all, who
will write it. They make things that are good enough to eat, but that is not the best part
of cooking by long odds.

There is one housekeeping feat of which Elisabeth says she is ashamed yet. I am not. I'll bet
it was fine. It was that cake we took so much trouble with. The yeast went in all right, but
something else went wrong. It was not put to soak, or to sizzle, in the oven, or whatever it
was. Like my single-blessed pancake, it did not rise, and in the darkness before I came home
she smuggled it out of the house; only to behold, with a mortification that endures to this
day, the neighbor-woman who had taken such an interest in our young housekeeping, examining
it carefully in the ash-barrel next morning.  People are curious. But they were welcome to
all they could spy out concerning our household.  They discovered there, if they looked right,
the sweetest and altogether the bravest little housekeeper in all the world. And what does
a cake matter, or a hen, or twenty, when only the housekeeper is right?

In my editorial enthusiasm for the new plan there was no doubtful note. The "beats" got a rest
for a season while I transferred my attention to the boarding-house. My wife teases me yet
with those mighty onslaughts on the new enemy. Having clearly made him out by the light of
our evening lamp, I went for him with might and main, determined to leave no boarding-house
through the length and breadth of the land, or at least of South Brooklyn. "Ours," I cried,
weekly "to fulfil its destiny, must be a nation of homes. Down with the boarding-house!" and
the politicians applauded.  They were glad to be let alone. So were the beats who were behind
in their bills, and whose champion I had unexpectedly become. A doughty champion, too, a walking
advertisement of my own prescription; for I grew fat and strong, whereas I had been lean and
poor. I was happy, that was it; very, very happy, and full of faith in our ability to fight
our way through, come what might. Nor did it require the gift of a prophet to make out that
trying days were coming; for my position, again as the paid editor of my once "owners," the
politicians, was rapidly becoming untenable. It was an agreement entered into temporarily.
When it should lapse, what then? I had pledged myself when I sold the paper not to start another
for ten years in South Brooklyn. So I would have to begin life over again in a new place. I
gave the matter but little thought.  I suppose the old folks, viewing it all from over there,
thought it trifling with fate. It was not. It was a trumpet challenge to it to come on, all
that could crowd in. Two, we would beat the world.

Before I record the onset that ensued, I must stop to tell of another fight, one which in my
soul I regret, though it makes me laugh even now. Non-resistance never appealed to me except
in the evildoer who has been knocked down for cause. I suppose it is wicked, but I promised
to tell the truth, and--I always did like Peter for knocking off the ear of the high priest's
servant. If only it had been the high priest's own ear! And so when the Rev. Mr.--no, I will
not mention names; he was Brother Simmons's successor, that is what grieves me--when he found
fault with the News for being on sale Sundays, if I remember rightly, and preached about it,
announcing that "never in the most anxious days of the war had he looked in a newspaper on
the Sabbath"; and when ill luck would have it that on the same Sunday I beheld his Reverence,
who was a choleric man, hotly stoning a neighbor's hen from his garden, I drew editorial parallels
which were not soothing to the reverend temper. What really ailed Mr.--- was that he was lacking
in common sense, or he would never have called upon me with his whole board of deacons in the
quiet of the Sunday noon, right after church, to demand a retraction. I have no hope that a
sense of the humor of the thing found its way into the clerical consciousness when I replied
that I never in the most exciting times transacted business on Sunday; for if it had, we would
have been friends for life.  But I know that it "struck in" in the case of the deacons. They
went out struggling with their mirth behind their pastor's back. I think he restrained himself
with difficulty from pronouncing the major excommunication against me, with bell, book, and
candle, then and there.

About that time I saw advertised for sale a stereopticon outfit, and bought it without any
definite idea of what to do with it. I suppose it ought to be set down as foolishness and a
waste of money. And yet it was to play an important part in the real life-work that was waiting
for me. Without the knowledge which the possession of it gave me, that work could not have
been carried out as it was. That is not to say that I recommend every man to have a magic lantern
in his cellar, or the promiscuous purchase of all sorts of useless things as though the world
were a kind of providential rummage sale. I should rather say that no effort to in any way
add to one's stock of knowledge is likely to come amiss in this world of changes and emergencies,
and that Providence has a way of ranging itself on the side of the man with the strongest battalions
of resources when the emergency does come. In other words, that to "trust God and keep your
powder dry" is the plan for all time.

The process of keeping mine dry came near blowing up the house. My two friends, Mackellar and
Wells, took a sympathetic interest in the lantern proceedings, which was well, because, being
a druggist, Wells knew about making the gas and could prevent trouble on that tack. It was
before the day of charged tanks. The gas we made was contained in wedge-shaped rubber bags,
in a frame with weights on top that gave the necessary pressure.  Mackellar volunteered to
be the weight, and sat on the bags, at our first seance, while Wells superintended the gas
and I read the written directions.  We were getting along nicely when I came to a place enjoining
great caution in the distribution of the weight. "You are working," read the text, "with two
gases which, if allowed to mix in undue proportion, have the force and all the destructive
power of a bombshell." Mackellar, all ear, from fidgeting fell into a tremble on his perch.
He had not dreamed of this; neither had we. I steadied him with an imperative gesture.

"Sit still," I commanded. "Listen! 'If, by any wabbling of the rack, the pressure were to be
suddenly relieved, the gas from one bag might be sucked into the other, with the result of
a disastrous explosion.'"

We stood regarding each other in dumb horror.  Mackellar was deathly pale.

"Let me off, boys," he pleaded faintly. "I've got to go to the station to turn out the men."
He made a motion to climb down.

Wells had snatched the book from me. "Jack!  for your life don't move!" he cried, and pointed
to the next paragraph in the directions:--

"Such a thing has happened when the frame has been upset, or the weight in some other way suddenly
shifted."

Mac sat as if frozen to stone. Ed and I sneaked out of the back door on tiptoe to make for
downstairs, three steps at a time. In less time than it takes to tell it we were back, each
with an armful of paving-stones, which we piled up beside our agonized comrade, assuring him
volubly that there was no danger if he would only sit still, still as a mouse, till we came
back. Then we were off again. The third trip gave us stones enough, and with infinite care
we piled them, one after another, upon the rack as the Captain eased up, until at last he stood
upon the floor, a freed and saved man. It was only then that it occurred to us that we might
have turned off the gas in the first place, and so saved ourselves all our anguish and toil.

I can say honestly that I tried the best I knew how to get along with the politicians I served,
but in the long run it simply could not be done. They treated me fairly, bearing no grudges.
But it is one thing to run an independent newspaper, quite another to edit an "organ." And
there is no deceiving the public. Not that I tried. Indeed, if anything, the shoe was on the
other foot. We parted company eventually to our mutual relief, and quite unexpectedly I found
my lantern turning the breadwinner of the family. The notion of using it as a means of advertising
had long allured me. There was a large population out on Long Island that traded in Brooklyn
stores and could be reached in that way. In fact, it proved to be so. I made money that fall
travelling through the towns and villages and giving open-air exhibitions in which the "ads"
of Brooklyn merchants were cunningly interlarded with very beautiful colored views, of which
I had a fine collection. When the season was too far advanced to allow of this, I established
myself in a window at Myrtle Avenue and Fulton Street and appealed to the city crowds with
my pictures. So I filled in a gap of several months, while our people on the other side crossed
themselves at my having turned street fakir. At least we got that impression from their letters.
They were not to blame. That is their way of looking at things. A chief reason why I liked
this country from the very beginning was that it made no difference what a man was doing, so
long as it was some honest, decent work. I liked my advertising scheme. I advertised nothing
I would not have sold the people myself, and I gave it to them in a way that was distinctly
pleasing and good for them; for my pictures were real work of art, not the cheap trash you
see nowadays on street screens.

The city crowds were always appreciative. In the country the hoodlums made trouble occasionally.
We talk a great deal about city toughs. In nine cases out of ten they are lads of normal impulses
whose resources have all been smothered by the slum; of whom the street and its lawlessness,
and the tenement that is without a home, have made ruffians. With better opportunities they
might have been heroes. The country hoodlum is oftener what he is because his bent is that
way, though he, too, is not rarely driven into mischief by the utter poverty--aesthetically
I mean--of his environment.  Hence he shows off in his isolation so much worse than his city
brother. It is no argument for the slum. It makes toughs, whereas the other is one in spite
of his country home. That is to say, if the latter is really a home. There is only one cure
then--an almighty thrashing.

There ought to be some ex-hoodlums left in Flushing to echo that sentiment, even after a quarter
of a century. From certain signs I knew, when I hung my curtain between two trees in the little
public park down by the fountain with the goldfish, that there was going to be trouble. My
patience had been pretty well worn down, and I made preparations.  I hired four stout men who
were spoiling for a fight, and put good hickory clubs into their hands, bidding them restrain
their natural desire to use them till the time came. My forebodings were not vain. Potatoes,
turnips, and eggs flew, not only at the curtain, but at the lantern and me. I stood it until
the Castle of Heidelberg, which was one of my most beautiful colored views, was rent in twain
by a rock that went clear through the curtain. Then I gave the word. In a trice the apparatus
was gathered up and thrown into a wagon that was waiting, the horses headed for Jamaica. We
made one dash into the crowd, and a wail arose from the bruised and bleeding hoodlums that
hung over the town like a nightmare, while we galloped out of it, followed by cries of rage
and a mob with rocks and clubs. But we had the best team in town, and soon lost them.

Vengeance? No! Of course there was the ruined curtain and those eggs to be settled for; but,
on the whole, I think we were a kind of village improvement society for the occasion, though
we did not stay to wait for a vote of thanks. I am sure it was our due all the same.

Along in the summer of 1877 Wells and I hatched out a scheme of country advertising on a larger
scale, of which the lantern was to be the vehicle.  We were to publish a directory of the city
of Elmira.  How we came to select that city I have forgotten, but the upshot of that latest
of my business ventures I am not likely to forget soon. Our plan was to boom the advertising
end of the enterprise by a nightly street display in the interest of our patrons.  We had barely
got into town when the railroad strikes of that memorable summer reached Elmira.  There had
been dreadful trouble, fire and bloodshed, in Pennsylvania, and the citizens took steps at
once to preserve the peace. A regiment of deputy sheriffs were sworn in, and the town was put
under semi-martial law. Indeed, soldiers with fixed bayonets guarded every train and car that
went over the bridge between the business section of the town and the railroad shops across
the Chemung River.

Our ill luck--or good; when a thing comes upon you so unexpectedly as did that, I am rather
disposed to consider it a stroke of good fortune, however disguised--would have it that the
building we had chosen to hang our curtain on was right at the end of this bridge which seemed
to be the danger point. From the other end the strikers looked across the river, hourly expected
to make a movement of some kind, exactly what I don't know. I know that the whole city was
on pins and needles about it, while we, all unconscious that we were the object of sharp scrutiny,
were vainly trying to string our sixteen-foot curtain. There was a high wind that blew it out
over the river despite all our efforts to catch and hold it. Twice it escaped our grasp.  We
could see a crowd of strikers watching us on the other side. The deputies who held our end
of the bridge saw them too. We were strangers; came from no one knew where. They must have
concluded that we were in league with the enemy and signalling to him. When for the third time
our big white flag was wafted toward the shops, a committee of citizens came up from the street
and let us know in as few words as possible that any other place would be healthier for us
just then than Elmira.

In vain we protested that we were noncombatants and engaged in peaceful industry. The committee
pointed to the flag and to the crowd at the farther end of the bridge. They eyed our preparations
for making gas askance, and politely but firmly insisted that the next train out of town was
especially suited for our purpose. There was nothing to be done. It was another case of circumstantial
evidence, and in the absence of backing of any kind we did the only thing we could; packed
up and went. It was not a time for trifling. The slaughter of a number of militiamen in a Pennsylvania
round-house that was set on fire by the strikers was fresh in the public mind. But it was the
only time I have been suspected of sympathy with violence in the settlement of labor disputes.
The trouble with that plan is that it does not settle anything, but rakes up fresh injuries
to rankle indefinitely and widen the gap between the man who does the work and the man who
hires it done so that he may have time to attend to his own.  Both workmen, they only need
to understand each other and their common interests to see the folly of quarrelling. To do
that they must know one another; but a blow and a kick are a poor introduction. I am not saying
that the provocation is not sometimes great; but better not. It does not do any good, but a
lot of harm. Besides, if we haven't got to the point yet where we can settle our disputes peaceably
by discussion, the fault is not all the employers by any manner of means.

We jumped out of the ashes into the fire, as it turned out. At Scranton our train was held
up.  There were torpedoes on the track; rails torn up or something. For want of something better
to do, we went out to take a look at the town. At the head of the main street was a big crowd.
Untaught by experience, we bored our way through it to where a line of men with guns, some
in their shirt-sleeves, some in office coats, some in dusters, were blocking advance to the
coal company's stores.  The crowd hung sullenly back, leaving a narrow space clear in front
of the line. Within it a man--I learned afterward that he was the Mayor of the town--was haranguing
the people, counselling them to go back to their homes quietly. Suddenly a brick was thrown
from behind me and struck him on the head.

I heard a word of brief command, the rattle of a score of guns falling into as many extended
hands, and a volley was fired into the crowd point blank, A man beside me weltered in his blood.
There was an instant's dead silence, then the rushing of a thousand feet and wild cries of
terror as the mob broke and fled. We ran with it. In all my life I never ran so fast. I would
never have believed that I could do it. Ed teased me to the day of his death about it, insisting
that one might have played marbles on my coat-tails, they flew out behind so. But he was an
easy winner in that race.  The riots were over, however, before they had begun, and perhaps
a greater calamity was averted.  It was the only time I was ever under fire, except once when
a crazy man came into Mulberry Street years after and pointed a revolver at the reporters.
I regret to say that I gave no better account of myself then, and for a man who was so hot
to go to war I own it is a bad showing. Perhaps it was as well I didn't go, even on that account.
I might have run the wrong way when it came to the scratch.

We were not yet done suffering undeserved indignities on that trip, for when we got as far
as Stanhope, on the Morris and Essex road, our money had given out. I offered the station-master
my watch as security for the price of two tickets to New York, but he bestowed only a contemptuous
glance upon it and remarked that there were a good many fakirs running about the country palming
off "snide" gold watches on people. Our lantern outfit found no more favor with him, and we
were compelled to tramp it to the village in Schooley's Mountains where my wife was then summering
with our baby. We walked all night, and when at dawn we arrived, had the mortification of being
held up by the farmer's dog, who knew nothing about us. He walked alongside of me all that
day, as I was pushing the baby-carriage up hill, eying me with a look that said plainly enough
I had better not make a move to sneak away with the child. Wells went on to the city to replenish
our funds.

And here I take leave of this loyal friend in the story of my life. A better one I never had.
He lived to grow rich in possessions, but his wealth was his undoing. It is one of the sore
spots in my life--and there are many more than I like to think of--that when he needed me most
I was not able to be to him what I would and should have been.  We had drifted too far apart
then, and the influence I had over him once I had myself surrendered. It was so with Charles.
It was so with Nicolai.  They come, sometimes when I am alone, and nod to me out of the dim
past: "You were not tempted.  You should have helped!" Yes, God help me! it is true. I am more
to blame than they. I should have helped and did not. What would I not give that I could unsay
that now! Two of them died by their own hand, the third in Bloomingdale.  I had been making
several attempts to get a foothold on one of the metropolitan newspapers, but always without
success. That fall I tried the Tribune, the city editor of which, Mr. Shanks, was one of my
neighbors, but was told, with more frankness than flattery, that I was "too green."  Very likely
Mr. Shanks had been observing my campaign against the beats and thought me a dangerous man
in those days of big libel suits. I should have done the same thing. But a few weeks after
he changed his mind and invited me to come on the paper and try my hand. So I joined the staff
of the Tribune five years after its great editor had died, a beaten and crushed man, one of
the most pathetic figures in American political history.

They were not halcyon days, those winter months of reporting for the Tribune. I was on trial,
and it was hard work and very little pay, not enough to live on, so that we were compelled
to take to our little pile to make ends meet. But there was always a bright fire and a cheery
welcome for me at home, so what did it matter? It was a good winter despite the desperate stunts
sometimes set me. Reporters on general work do not sleep on flowery beds of ease. I remember
well one awful night when word came of a dreadful disaster on the Coney Island shore. Half
of it had been washed away by the sea, the report ran, with houses and people. I was sent out
to get at the truth of the thing. I started in the early twilight and got as far as Gravesend.
The rest of the way I had to foot it through snow and slush knee-deep in the face of a blinding
storm, and got to Sheepshead Bay dead beat, only to find that the ice and the tide had shut
off all approach to the island.

I did the next best thing; I gathered from the hotel-keepers of the Bay an account of the wreck
on the beach that lacked nothing in vividness, thanks to their laudable desire not to see an
enterprising reporter cheated out of his rightful "space." Then I hired a sleigh and drove
home through the storm, wet through--"I can hear the water yet running out of your boots,"
says my wife--wet through and nearly frozen stiff, but tingling with pride at my feat.

The Tribune next day was the only paper that had an account of the tidal wave on the island.
But something about it did not seem to strike the city editor just right. There was an unwonted
suavity in his summons when he called me to his desk which I had learned to dread as liable
to conceal some fatal thrust.

"So you went to the island last night, Mr. Riis," he observed, regarding me over the edge of
the paper.

"No, sir! I couldn't get across; nobody could."

"Eh!" He lowered the paper an inch, and took a better look: "this very circumstantial account--"

"Was gathered from the hotel-keepers in Sheepshead Bay, who had seen it all. If there had been
a boat not stove by the ice, I would have got across somehow."

Mr. Shanks dropped the paper and considered me almost kindly. I saw that he had my bill for
the sleigh-ride in his hand.

"Right!" he said. "We'll allow the sleigh.  We'll allow even the stove, to a man who owns he
didn't see it, though it is pretty steep." He pointed to a paragraph which described how, after
the wreck of the watchman's shanty, the kitchen stove floated ashore with the house-cat alive
and safe upon it. I still believe that an unfriendly printer played me that trick.

"Next time," he added, dismissing me, "make them swear to the stove. There is no accounting
for cats."

But, though I did not hear the last of it in the office for a long time, I know that my measure
was taken by the desk that day. I was trusted after that, even though I had made a mistake.

In spite of it, I did not get on. There was not a living in it for me, that was made plain
enough.  We were too many doing general work. After six months of hard grubbing I decided that
I had better seek my fortune elsewhere. Spring was coming, and it seemed a waste of time to
stay where I was.  I wrote out my resignation and left it on the city editor's desk. Some errand
took me out of the office. When I returned it lay there still, unopened.  I saw it, and thought
I would try another week. I might make a strike. So I took the note away and tore it up, just
as Mr. Shanks entered the room.

That evening it set in snowing at a great rate.  I had been uptown on a late assignment, and
was coming across Printing-House Square, running at top speed to catch the edition. The wind
did its part. There is no corner in all New York where it blows as it does around the Tribune
building. As I flew into Spruce Street I brought up smack against two men coming out of the
side door. One of them I knocked off his feet into a snowdrift. He floundered about in it and
swore dreadfully. By the voice I knew that it was Mr. Shanks. I stood petrified, mechanically
pinning his slouch hat to the ground with my toe. He got upon his feet at last and came toward
me, much wrought up.

"Who in thunder--" he growled angrily and caught sight of my rueful face. I was thinking I
might as well have left my note on his desk that morning, for now I was going to be discharged
anyhow.

"Is that the way you treat your city editor, Riis?" he asked, while I handed him his hat.

"It was the wind, sir, and I was running--"

"Running! What is up that set you going at that rate?"

I told him of the meeting I had attended--it was of no account--and that I was running to catch
the edition. He heard me out.

"And do you always run like that when you are out on assignments?"

"When it is late like this, yes. How else would I get my copy in?"

"Well, just take a reef in when you round the corner," he said, brushing the snow from his
clothes.  "Don't run your city editor down again." And he went his way.

It was with anxious forebodings I went to the office the next morning. Mr. Shanks was there
before me. He was dictating to his secretary, Mr. Taggart, who had been witness of the collision
of the night before, when I came in. Presently I was summoned to his desk, and went there with
sinking heart.  Things had commenced to look up a bit in the last twenty-four hours, and I
had hoped yet to make it go. Now, it was all over.

"Mr. Riis," he began stiffly, "you knocked me down last night without cause."

"Yes, sir! But I--" [ Illustration: Mulberry Street.]

"Into a snowdrift," he went on, unheeding. "Nice thing for a reporter to do to his commanding
officer.  Now, sir! this will not do. We must find some way of preventing it in the future.
Our man at Police Headquarters has left. I am going to send you up there in his place. You
can run there all you want to, and you will want to all you can. It is a place that needs a
man who will run to get his copy in and tell the truth and stick to it. You will find plenty
of fighting there. But don't go knocking people down--unless you have to."

And with this kind of an introduction I was sent off to Mulberry Street, where I was to find
my life-work.  It is twenty-three years since the day I took my first walk up there and looked
over the ground that has since become so familiar to me. I knew it by reputation as the hardest
place on the paper, and it was in no spirit of exultation that I looked out upon the stirring
life of the block. If the truth be told, I think I was, if anything, a bit afraid. The story
of the big fight the Tribune reporter was having on his hands up there with all the other papers
had long been echoing through newspaperdom, and I was not deceived. But, after all, I had been
doing little else myself, and, having given no offence, my cause would be just. In which case,
what had I to fear? So in my soul I commended my work and myself to the God of battles who
gives victory, and took hold.

Right here, lest I make myself appear better than I am, I want to say that I am not a praying
man in the sense of being versed in the language of prayer or anything of that kind. I wish
I were. So, I might have been better able to serve my unhappy friends when they needed me.
Indeed, those who have known me under strong provocation--provocation is very strong in Mulberry
Street--would scorn such an intimation, and, I am sorry to say, with cause. I was once a deacon,
but they did not often let me lead in prayer. My supplications ordinarily take the form of
putting the case plainly to Him who is the source of all right and all justice, and leaving
it so. If I were to find that I could not do that, I should decline to go into the fight, or,
if I had to, should feel that I were to be justly beaten.  In all the years of my reporting
I have never omitted this when anything big was on foot, whether a fire, a murder, a robbery,
or whatever might come in the way of duty, and I have never heard that my reports were any
the worse for it.  I know they were better. Perhaps the notion of a police reporter praying
that he may write a good murder story may seem ludicrous, even irreverent, to some people.
But that is only because they fail to make out in it the human element which dignifies anything
and rescues it from reproach. Unless I could go to my story that way I would not go to it at
all. I am very sure that there is no irreverence in it--just the reverse.

So I dived in. But before I did it I telegraphed to my wife:--

"Got staff appointment. Police Headquarters.  $25 a week. Hurrah!"

I knew it would make her happy.

CHAPTER IX

LIFE IN MULBERRY STREET

It was well that I stopped to make explanations before I took hold in my new office. Mighty
little time was left me after. What the fight was about to which I fell heir I have long since
forgotten. Mulberry Street in those days was prone to such things. Somebody was always fighting
somebody else for some fancied injury or act of bad faith in the gathering of the news. For
the time being they all made common cause against the reporter of the Tribune, who also represented
the local bureau of the Associated Press. They hailed the coming of "the Dutchman" with shouts
of derision, and decided, I suppose, to finish me off while I was new. So they pulled themselves
together for an effort, and within a week I was so badly "beaten" in the Police Department,
in the Health Department, in the Fire Department, the Coroner's office, and the Excise Bureau,
all of which it was my task to cover, that the manager of the Press Bureau called me down to
look me over. He reported to the Tribune that he did not think I would do.  But Mr. Shanks
told him to wait and see. In some way I heard of it, and that settled it that I was to win.
I might be beaten in many a battle, but how could I lose the fight with a general like that?

And, indeed, in another week it was their turn to be called down to give an account of themselves.
The "Dutchman" had stolen a march on them.  I suppose it was to them a very astounding thing,
yet it was perfectly simple. Their very strength, as they held it to be, was their weakness.
They were a dozen against one, and each one of them took it for granted that the other eleven
were attending to business and that he need not exert himself overmuch. A good many years after,
I had that experience as a member of a board of twelve trustees, each one of whom had lent
his name but not his work to the cause we were supposed to represent. When we met at the end
of that season, and heard how narrow had been the escape from calamity due to utter lack of
management, a good Methodist brother put in words what we were each and every one of us thinking
about.

"Brethren," he said, "so far as I can make out, but for the interposition of a merciful Providence
we should all be in jail, as we deserve. Let us pray!"

I think that prayer was more than lip-service with most of us. I know that I registered a vow
that I would never again be trustee of anything without trusteeing it in fact. And I have kept
the vow.

But to return to Mulberry Street. The immediate result of this first victory of mine was a
whirlwind onslaught on me, fiercer than anything that had gone before. I expected it and met
it as well as I could, holding my own after a fashion. When, from sheer exhaustion, they let
up to see if I was still there, I paid them back with two or three "beats" I had stored up
for the occasion.  And then we settled down to the ten years' war for the mastery, out of which
I was to come at last fairly the victor, and with the only renown I have ever coveted or cared
to have, that of being the "boss reporter" in Mulberry Street. I have so often been asked in
later years what my work was there [Footnote: I say was; only in the last twelvemonth have
I grasped Mr.  Dana's meaning in calling his reporters his "young men." They need to be that.
I, for one, have grown too old.], and how I found there the point of view from which I wrote
my books, that I suppose I shall have to go somewhat into the details of it.

The police reporter on a newspaper, then, is the one who gathers and handles all the news that
means trouble to some one: the murders, fires, suicides, robberies, and all that sort, before
it gets into court. He has an office in Mulberry Street, across from Police Headquarters, where
he receives the first intimation of the trouble through the precinct reports. Or else he does
not receive it. The police do not like to tell the public of a robbery or a safe "cracking,"
for instance. They claim that it interferes with the ends of justice. What they really mean
is that it brings ridicule or censure upon them to have the public know that they do not catch
every thief, or even most of them. They would like that impression to go out, for police work
is largely a game of bluff. Here, then, is an opportunity for the "beats" I speak of. The reporter
who, through acquaintance, friendship, or natural detective skill, can get that which it is
the policy of the police to conceal from him, wins. It may seem to many a reader a matter of
no great importance if a man should miss a safe-burglary for his paper; but reporting is a
business, a very exacting one at that, and if he will stop a moment and think what it is he
instinctively looks at first in his morning paper, even if he has schooled himself not to read
it through, he will see it differently.  The fact is that it is all a great human drama in
which these things are the acts that mean grief, suffering, revenge upon somebody, loss or
gain.  The reporter who is behind the scenes sees the tumult of passions, and not rarely a
human heroism that redeems all the rest. It is his task so to portray it that we can all see
its meaning, or at all events catch the human drift of it, not merely the foulness and the
reek of blood. If he can do that, he has performed a signal service, and his murder story may
easily come to speak more eloquently to the minds of thousands than the sermon preached to
a hundred in the church on Sunday.

Of the advantages that smooth the way to news-getting I had none. I was a stranger, and I was
never distinguished for detective ability. But good hard work goes a long way toward making
up for lack of genius; and I mentioned only one of the opportunities for getting ahead of my
opponents.  They were lying all about us. Any seemingly innocent slip sent out from the police
telegraph office across the way recording a petty tenement-house fire might hide a fire-bug,
who always makes shuddering appeal to our fears; the finding of John Jones sick and destitute
in the street meant, perhaps, a story full of the deepest pathos. Indeed, I can think of a
dozen now that did. I see before me, as though it were yesterday, the desolate Wooster Street
attic, with wind and rain sweeping through the bare room in which lay dying a French nobleman
of proud and ancient name, the last of his house. He was one of my early triumphs. New York
is a queer town.  The grist of every hopper in the world comes to it.  I shall not soon forget
the gloomy tenement in Clinton Street where that day a poor shoemaker had shot himself. His
name, Struensee, had brought me over. I knew there could not be such another.  That was where
my Danish birth stood me in good stead. I knew the story of Christian VII.'s masterful minister;
of his fall and trial on the charge of supplanting his master in the affections of the young
and beautiful Queen, sister of George III. Very old men told yet, when I was a boy, of that
dark day when the proud head fell under the executioner's axe in the castle square--dark for
the people whose champion Struensee had tried to be.  My mother was born and reared in the
castle at Elsinore where the unhappy Queen, disgraced and an outcast, wrote on the window-pane
of her prison cell: "Lord, keep me innocent; make others great." It was all a familiar story
to me, and when I sat beside that dead shoemaker and, looking through his papers, read there
that the tragedy of a hundred years before was his family story, I knew that I held in my hands
the means of paying off all accumulated scores to date.

Did I settle in full? Yes, I did. I was in a fight not of my own choosing, and I was well aware
that my turn was coming. I hit as hard as I knew how, and so did they. When I speak of "triumphs,"
it is professionally. There was no hard-heartedness about it. We did not gloat over the misfortunes
we described. We were reporters, not ghouls.  There lies before me as I write a letter that
came in the mail this afternoon from a woman who bitterly objects to my diagnosis of the reporter's
as the highest and noblest of all callings. She signs herself "a sufferer from reporters' unkindness,"
and tells me how in the hour of her deep affliction they have trodden upon her heart. Can I
not, she asks, encourage a public sentiment that will make such reporting disreputable? All
my life I have tried to do so, and, in spite of the evidence of yellow journalism to the contrary,
I think we are coming nearer to that ideal; in other words, we are emerging from savagery.
Striving madly for each other's scalps as we were, I do not think that we scalped any one else
unjustly.  I know I did not. They were not particularly scrupulous, I am bound to say. In their
rage and mortification at having underestimated the enemy, they did things unworthy of men
and of reporters.  They stole my slips in the telegraph office and substituted others that
sent me off on a wild-goose chase to the farthest river wards in the midnight hour, thinking
so to tire me out. But they did it once too often.  I happened on a very important case on
such a trip, and made the most of it, telegraphing down a column or more about it from the
office, while the enemy watched me helplessly from the Headquarters' stoop across the way.
They were gathered there, waiting for me to come back, and received me with loud and mocking
ahems! and respectfully sympathetic toots on a tin horn, kept for that purpose.  Its voice
had a mournful strain in it that was especially exasperating. But when, without paying any
attention to them, I busied myself with the wire at once, and kept at it right along, they
scented trouble, and consulted anxiously among themselves.  My story finished, I went out and
sat on my own stoop and said ahem! in my turn in as many aggravating ways as I could. They
knew they were beaten then, and shortly they had confirmation of it. The report came in from
the precinct at 2 A.M., but it was then too late for their papers, for there were no telephones
in those days. I had the only telegraph wire. After that they gave up such tricks, and the
Tribune saved many cab fares at night; for there were no elevated railroads, either, in those
days, or electric or cable cars.

On the other hand, this enterprise of ours was often of the highest service to the public.
When, for instance, in following up a case of destitution and illness involving a whole family,
I, tracing back the origin of it, came upon a party at which ham sandwiches had been the bill
of fare, and upon looking up the guests, found seventeen of the twenty-five sick with identical
symptoms, it required no medical knowledge, but merely the ordinary information and training
of the reporter, to diagnose trichinosis. The seventeen had half a dozen different doctors,
who, knowing nothing of party or ham, were helpless, and saw only cases of rheumatism or such
like. I called as many of them as I could reach together that night, introduced them to one
another and to my facts, and asked them what they thought then. What they thought made a sensation
in my paper the next morning, and practically decided the fight, though the enemy was able
to spoil my relish for the ham by reporting the poisoning of a whole family with a dish of
depraved smelt while I was chasing up the trichinae. However, I had my revenge. I walked in
that afternoon upon Dr. Cyrus Edson at his microscope surrounded by my adversaries, who besought
him to deny my story. The doctor looked quizzically at them and made reply:--

"I would like to oblige you, boys, but how I can do it with those fellows squirming under the
microscope I don't see. I took them from the flesh of one of the patients who was sent to Trinity
Hospital to-day. Look at them yourself."

He winked at me, and, peering into his microscope, I saw my diagnosis more than confirmed.
There were scores of the little beasts curled up and burrowing in the speck of tissue. The
unhappy patient died that week.

We had our specialties in this contest of wits.  One was distinguished as a sleuth. He fed
on detective mysteries as a cat on a chicken-bone. He thought them out by day and dreamed them
out by night, to the great exasperation of the official detectives, with whom their solution
was a commercial, not in the least an intellectual, affair.  They solved them on the plane
of the proverbial lack of honor among thieves, by the formula, "You scratch my back, and I'll
scratch yours."

Another came out strong on fires. He knew the history of every house in town that ran any risk
of being burned; knew every fireman; and could tell within a thousand dollars, more or less,
what was the value of the goods stored in any building in the dry-goods district, and for how
much they were insured. If he couldn't, he did anyhow, and his guesses often came near the
fact, as shown in the final adjustment. He sniffed a firebug from afar, and knew without asking
how much salvage there was in a bale of cotton after being twenty-four hours in the fire. He
is dead, poor fellow. In life he was fond of a joke, and in death the joke clung to him in
a way wholly unforeseen. The firemen in the next block, with whom he made his headquarters
when off duty, so that he might always be within hearing of the gong, wished to give some tangible
evidence of their regard for the old reporter, but, being in a hurry, left it to the florist,
who knew him well, to choose the design. He hit upon a floral fire-badge as the proper thing,
and thus it was that when the company of mourners was assembled, and the funeral service in
progress, there arrived and was set upon the coffin, in the view of all, that triumph of the
florist's art, a shield of white roses, with this legend written across it in red immortelles:
"Admit within fire lines only." It was shocking, but irresistible. It brought down even the
house of mourning.

The incident recalls another, which at the time caused me no little astonishment. A telegram
from Long Branch had announced the drowning of a young actor, I think, whose three sisters
lived over on Eighth Avenue. I had gone to the house to learn about the accident, and found
them in the first burst of grief, dissolved in tears. It was a very hot July day, and to guard
against sunstroke I had put a cabbage-leaf in my hat. On the way over I forgot all about it,
and the leaf, getting limp, settled down snugly upon my head like a ridiculous green skullcap.
Knowing nothing of this, I was wholly unprepared for the effect my entrance, hatless, had upon
the weeping family. The young ladies ceased crying, stared wildly, and then, to my utter bewilderment,
broke into hysterical laughter.  For the moment I thought they had gone mad. It was only when
in my perplexity I put up my hand to rub my head, that I came upon the cause of the strange
hilarity. For years afterward the thought of it had the same effect upon me that the cabbage-leaf
produced so unexpectedly in that grief-stricken home.

I might fill many pages with such stories, but I shall not attempt it. Do they seem mean and
trifling in the retrospect? Not at all. They were my work, and I liked it. And I got a good
deal of fun out of it from time to time. I mind Dr.  Bryant's parrot story. Dr. Joseph D. Bryant
was Health Commissioner at the time, and though we rarely agreed about anything--there is something
curious about that, that the men I have thought most of were quite often those with whom I
disagreed ordinarily about everything--I can say truly that there have been few better Health
Commissioners, and none for whom I have had a more hearty respect and liking. Dr. Bryant especially
hated reporters. He wras built that way; he disliked notoriety for himself and his friends,
and therefore, when one of these complained of a neighbor's parrot to the Health Department,
he gave strict orders that the story was to be guarded from the reporters, and particularly
from me, who had grieved him more than once by publishing things which, in his opinion, I ought
to have said nothing about. I heard of it within the hour, and promptly set my wit against
the Doctor's to unearth the parrot.

But it would not come out. Dig as I might, I could not get at it. I tried every way, while
the Doctor laughed in his sleeve and beamed upon me.  At last, in desperation, I hit upon a
bold plan. I would get it out of the Doctor himself. I knew his hours for coming to Sanitary
Headquarters--from his clinics, I suppose. He always came up the stairs absorbed in thought,
noticing nothing that passed. I waylaid him in the turn of the dark hall, and before he had
time to think plumped at him an--

"Oh, Doctor! about that parrot of your friend--er--er, oh! what was his name?"

"Alley," said the Doctor, mechanically, and went in, only half hearing what I said. I made
for the city directory. There were four Alleys in it. In an hour I had located my man, and
the next morning's Tribune had a column account of the tragedy of the parrot.

The Doctor was very angry. He went to Headquarters and summoned me solemnly before the assembled
Board. The time had come, he said, to have an explanation from me as to who it was that gave
me information against orders and the public interest. Evidently there was a traitor in camp,
by whatever means I had procured his treachery.

In vain did I try to show the Doctor how unprofessional my conduct would be in betraying my
informant, even how contemptible. He was inexorable.  This time I should not escape, nor my
accomplice either. Out with it, and at once. With a show of regretful resignation I gave in.
For once I would break my rule and "tell on" my informant.  I thought I detected a slight sneer
on the Doctor's lip as he said that was well; for he was a gentleman, every inch of him, and
I know he hated me for telling.  The other Commissioners looked grave.

"Well, then," I said, "the man who gave me the parrot story was--you, Dr. Bryant."

The Doctor sat bolt upright with a jerk. "No bad jokes, Mr. Riis," he said. "Who gave you the
story?"

"Why, you did. Don't you remember?" And I told how I waylaid him in the hall. His face, as
the narrative ran on, was a study. Anger, mirth, offended pride, struggled there; but the humor
of the thing got the upper hand in the end, and the one who laughed loudest in the Board room
was Dr. Bryant himself. In my soul I believe that he was not a little relieved, for under a
manner of much sternness he had the tenderest of hearts.

But it was not always I who came out ahead in the daily encounters which made up the routine
of my day. It was an important part of my task to be on such terms with the heads of departments
that they would talk freely to us so that we might know in any given case, or with reference
to the policy of the department, "where we were at." I do not mean talk for publication. It
is a common mistake of people who know nothing about the newspaper profession that reporters
flit about public men like so many hawks, seizing upon what they can find to publish as their
lawful prey. No doubt there are such guerrillas, and they have occasionally more than justified
their existence; but, as applied to the staff reporters of a great newspaper, nothing could
be farther from the truth. The department reporter has his field as carefully laid out for
him every day as any physician who starts out on his route, and within that field, if he is
the right sort of man, he is friend, companion, and often counsellor to the officials with
whom he comes in contact--always supposing that he is not fighting them in open war.  He may
serve a Republican paper and the President of the Police Board may be a Democrat of Democrats;
yet in the privacy of his office he will talk as freely to the reporter as if he were his most
intimate party friend, knowing that he will not publish what is said in confidence. This is
the reporter's capital, without which he cannot in the long run do business.

I presume he is sometimes tempted to gamble with it for a stake. I remember well when the temptation
came to me once after a quiet hour with Police Commissioner Matthews, who had been telling
me the inside history of an affair which just then was setting the whole town by the ears.
I told him that I thought I should have to print it; it was too good to keep. No, it wouldn't
do, he said. I knew well enough he was right, but I insisted; the chance was too good a one
to miss.  Mr. Matthews shook his head. He was an invalid, and was taking his daily treatment
with an electric battery while we talked and smoked. He warned me laughingly against the consequences
of what I proposed to do, and changed the subject.

"Ever try these?" he said, giving me the handles.  I took them, unsuspecting, and felt the
current tingle in my finger-tips. The next instant it gripped me like a vice. I squirmed with pain.

"Stop!" I yelled, and tried to throw the things away; but my hands crooked themselves about
them like a bird's claws and held them fast. They would not let go. I looked at the Commissioner.
He was studying the battery leisurely, and slowly pulling out the plug that increased the current.

"For mercy's sake, stop!" I called to him. He looked up inquiringly.

"About that interview, now," he drawled. "Do you think you ought to print--"

"Wow, wow! Let go, I tell you!" It hurt dreadfully. He pulled the thing out another peg.

"You know it wouldn't do, really. Now, if--" He made as if to still further increase the current.
I surrendered.

"Let up," I begged, "and I will not say a word.  Only let up."

He set me free. He never spoke of it once in all the years I knew him, but now and again he
would offer me, with a dry smile, the use of his battery as "very good for the health." I always
declined with thanks.

I got into Mulberry Street at what might well be called the heroic age of police reporting.
It rang still with the echoes of the unfathomed Charley Ross mystery. That year occurred the
Stewart grave robbery and the Manhattan Bank burglary--three epoch-making crimes that each
in its way made a sensation such as New York has not known since. For though Charley Ross was
stolen in Philadelphia, the search for him centered in the metropolis. The three-million-dollar
burglary within the shadow of Police Headquarters gave us Inspector Byrnes, who broke up the
old gangs of crooks and drove those whom he did not put in jail over the sea to ply their trade
in Europe. The Stewart grave robbery ended the career of the ghouls, and the Charley Ross case
put a stop to child-stealing for a generation, by making those crimes unprofitable. The public
excitement was so great that it proved impossible for the thieves to deliver the goods and
effect the change for ransom.  At intervals for years these cases kept turning up in one new
phase or another. You could never tell where to look for them. Indeed, I have to thank the
Stewart ghouls for the first public recognition that came to me in those early years of toil.
Of all the mysteries that ever vexed a reporter's soul, that was the most agonizing.  The police,
most of the time, were as much in the dark as the rest of us, and nothing was to be got from
that source. Heaven knows I tried. In our desperation we caught at every straw. One stormy
night in the hottest of the excitement Judge Hilton, who had offered the $50,000 reward for
the stolen body on behalf of Mrs. Stewart, went to Headquarters and stayed an hour in the detective
office.  When he came out, he was attended by two of the oldest and ablest detectives. Clearly
something big was on foot. They were just like so many sphinxes, and went straight to the carriage
that waited at the Mulberry Street door. I do not know how it ever entered my head; perhaps
it didn't at all, but was just done mechanically. The wind had blown out the lamp on the steps,
and the street was in profound darkness. As they stepped into the carriage, I, with only the
notion in my head that here was news which must be got somehow, went in last and sank down
in the vacant seat, pulling the door to after me. The carriage went on. To my intense relief,
it rounded the corner. I was undiscovered! But at that moment it came to a sudden stop.  An
invisible hand opened the door, and, grasping my collar, gently but firmly propelled me into
the street and dropped me there. Then the carriage went on. Not a word had been spoken. They
understood and so did I. It was enough.

But, as I said, I had my revenge. It came when the opposition reporters, believing the mystery
to be near its solution, [Footnote: This was, as nearly as I remember, in the autumn of 1879,
the year following the robbery] entered into a conspiracy to forestall it and deliberately
invented the lines of the coming denouement. Day by day they published its progress "upon the
authority of a high official" who never existed, announcing that "behind each one of the grave-robbers
stood a detective with uplifted hand" ready to arrest him when the word was given. It was truly
the dawn of yellow journalism.  With such extraordinary circumstantiality were the accounts
given that for once my office wavered in its faith in Ensign and me. Amos Ensign was my partner
at the time, a fine fellow and a good reporter. If we turned out to be wrong, we were given
to understand our careers on the Tribune would be at an end. I slept little or none during
that month of intense work and excitement, but spent my days as my nights sifting every scrap
of evidence. There was nothing to justify the stories, and we maintained in our paper that
they were lies. Mr. Shanks himself left the city desk and came up to work with us. His head,
too, would fall, we heard, if his faith in the police office had been misplaced. The bubble
burst at last, and, as we expected, there was nothing in it. The Tribune was justified. The
opposition reporters were fined or suspended. Ensign and I were made much of in the office.
I have still the bulletin in which Mr. Shanks spoke of me as the man whose work had done much
to "make the Tribune police reports the best in the city." Sweet comfort for "the Dutchman"!
My salary was raised, but that was of less account. We had saved the day and the desk. After
that it was not all pulling up-stream in Mulberry Street. Nothing in this world succeeds like
success.

Before that I had been once suspended myself for missing something in this very case. I was
not to blame, and therefore was angry and refused to make explanations. That night, as I sat
sulking in my home in Brooklyn, a big warehouse fire broke out down town. From our house on
the hill I watched it grow beyond control, and knew that the boys were hard put to it.  It
was late, and as I thought of the hastening hours, the police reporter got the better of the
man, and I hurried down to take a hand. When I turned up in the office after midnight to write
the story, the night editor eyed me curiously.

"I thought, Riis, you were suspended," he said.

For a moment I wavered, smarting under the injustice of it all. But my note-book reminded me.

"I am," I said, "and when I am done with this I am going home till you send for me. But this
fire--can I have a desk?"

The night editor got up and came over and shook hands. "Take mine," he said. "There! take it!"

They sent for me the next day.

It is not to be supposed that all this was smooth sailing. Along with the occasional commendations
for battles won against "the mob" went constant and grievous complaints of the editors supplied
by the Associated Press, and even by some in my own office now and then, of my "style." It
was very bad, according to my critics, altogether editorial and presuming, and not to be borne.
So I was warned that I must mend it and give the facts, sparing comments. By that I suppose
they meant that I must write, not what I thought, but what they probably might think of the
news. But, good or bad, I could write in no other way, and kept right on. Not that I think,
by any manners of means, that it was the best way, but it was mine.  And goodness knows I had
no desire to be an editor. I have not now. I prefer to be a reporter and deal with the facts
to being an editor and lying about them. In the end the complaints died out. I suppose I was
given up as hopeless.

Perhaps there had crept into my reports too much of my fight with the police. For by that time
I had included them in "the opposition." They had not been friendly from the first, and it
was best so. I had them all in front then, and an open enemy is better any day than a false
friend who may stab you in the back. In the quarter of a century since, I have seldom been
on any other terms with the police. I mean with the heads of them. The rank and file, the man
with the nightstick as Roosevelt liked to call him, is all right, if properly led. He has rarely
been properly led. It may be that, in that respect at least, my reports might have been tempered
somewhat to advantage.  Though I don't know. I prefer, after all, to have it out, all out.
And it did come out, and my mind was relieved; which was something.

Speaking of night-sticks reminds me of seeing General Grant in his to my mind greatest hour,
the only time he was ever beaten, and by a policeman.  I told his son, Fred Grant, of it when
he became a Police Commissioner in the nineties, but I do not think he appreciated it. He was
not cast in his great father's mould. The occasion I refer to was after the General's second
term in the Presidency.  He was staying at the Fifth Avenue Hotel when one morning the Masonic
Temple was burned. The fire-line was drawn halfway down the block toward Fifth Avenue, but
the police were much hampered by the crowd, and were out of patience when I, standing by, saw
a man in a great ulster with head buried deep in the collar, a cigar sticking straight out,
coming down the street from the hotel. I recognized him at sight as General Grant. The policeman
who blocked his way did not. He grabbed him by the collar, swung him about, and, hitting him
a resounding whack across the back with his club, yelled out:--

"What's the matter with you? Don't you see the fire-lines? Chase yourself out of here, and
be quick about it."

The General said never a word. He did not stop to argue the matter. He had run up against a
sentinel, and when stopped went the other way.  That was all. The man had a right to be there;
he had none. I was never so much an admirer of Grant as since that day. It was true greatness.
A smaller man would have made a row, stood upon his dignity and demanded the punishment of
the policeman. As for him, there was probably never so badly frightened a policeman when I
told him whom he had clubbed. I will warrant he did not sleep for a week, fearing all kinds
of things. No need of it. Grant probably never gave him a thought.

It was in pursuit of the story of a Breton nobleman of hoped-for ancient lineage that I met
with the most disheartening set-back of my experience.  The setting of the case was most alluring.
The old baron--for he was nothing less, though in Minetta Lane he passed for a cat's-meat man
who peddled his odd ware from door to door--had been found by the police sick and starving
in his wretched cellar, and had been taken to Bellevue Hospital.  The inevitable de suggested
the story, and papers that I found in his trunk--papers most carefully guarded and cherished--told
enough of it to whet my appetite to its keenest edge. If the owner could only be made to talk,
if his stubborn family pride could only be overcome, there was every promise here of a sensation
by means of which who could tell but belated justice might even be done him and his family--apart
from the phenomenal trouncing I should be administering through him to my rivals.  Visions
of conspiracies, court intrigues, confiscations, and what not, danced before my greedy mental
vision. I flew rather than walked up to Bellevue Hospital to offer him my paper and pen in
the service of right and of vengeance, only to find that I was twenty-four hours late. The
patient had already been transferred to the Charity Hospital as a bad case. The boat had gone;
there would not be another for several hours. I could not wait, but it was a comfort, at all
events, to know that my baron was where I could get at him on the morrow.  I dreamed some more
dreams of happiness as I went back, and was content.

As it happened, I was very busy the next day and for several days after. The week was nearly
spent when I found myself on the boat going up to the island. At the hospital office they reassured
me with a queer look. Yes; my man was there, likely to stay there for a little while. The doctor
would presently take me to see him on his rounds.  In one of the big wards I found him at last,
numbered in the row of beds among a score of other human wrecks, a little old man, bent and
haggard, but with some of the dignity, I fancied, of his noble descent upon his white and wrinkled
brow. He sat up in bed, propped by pillows, and listened with hungry eyes as, in French which
I had most carefully polished up for the occasion, I told him my errand. When at last I paused,
waiting anxiously for an answer, he laid one trembling hand on mine--I noticed that the other
hung limp from the shoulder--and made, as it seemed, a superhuman effort to speak; but only
inarticulate, pitiful sounds came forth. I looked appealingly at the doctor.

"Dumb," he said, and shook his head. "Paralysis involving the vocal organs. He will never speak
again."

And he didn't. He was buried in the Potter's Field the next week. For once I was too late.
The story of the last of my barons remains untold until this hour.

And now that this chapter, somewhat against my planning, has become wholly the police reporter's,
I shall have to bring up my cause celebre, though that came a long while after my getting into
Mulberry Street. I shall not have so good an opportunity again. It was the occasion of the
last of my many battles for the mastery; but, more than that, it illustrates very well that
which I have been trying to describe as a reporter's public function.  We had been for months
in dread of a cholera scourge that summer, when, mousing about the Health Department one day,
I picked up the weekly analysis of the Croton water and noticed that there had been for two
weeks past "a trace of nitrites" in the water. I asked the department chemist what it was.
He gave an evasive answer, and my curiosity was at once aroused. There must be no unknown or
doubtful ingredient in the water supply of a city of two million souls. Like Caesar's wife,
it must be above suspicion. Within an hour I had learned that the nitrites meant in fact that
there had been at one time sewage contamination; consequently that we were face to face with
a most grave problem. How had the water become polluted, and who guaranteed that it was not
in that way even then, with the black death threatening to cross the ocean from Europe?

I sounded the warning in my paper, then the Evening Sun, counselled the people to boil the
water pending further discoveries, then took my camera and went up in the watershed. I spent
a week there, following to its source every stream that discharged into the Croton River and
photographing my evidence wherever I found it. When I told my story in print, illustrated with
the pictures, the town was astounded. The Board of Health sent inspectors to the watershed,
who reported that things were worse a great deal than I had said. Populous towns sewered directly
into our drinking-water. There was not even a pretence at decency. The people bathed and washed
their dogs in the streams. The public town dumps were on their banks. The rival newspapers
tried to belittle the evil because their reporters were beaten. Running water purifies itself,
they said.  So it does, if it runs far enough and long enough.  I put that matter to the test.
Taking the case of a town some sixty miles out of New York, one of the worst offenders, I ascertained
from the engineer of the water-works how long it ordinarily took to bring water from the Sodom
reservoir just beyond, down to the housekeepers' faucets in the city. Four days, I think it
was. Then I went to the doctors and asked them how many days a vigorous cholera bacillus might
live and multiply in running water.  About seven, said they. My case was made. There was needed
but a single case of the dreaded scourge in any one of a dozen towns or villages that were
on the line of travel from the harbor in which a half score ships were under quarantine, to
put the metropolis at the mercy of an inconceivable calamity.

There was in all this no attempt at sensation. It was simple fact, as any one could see for
himself.  The health inspectors' report clinched the matter.  The newspapers editorially abandoned
their reporters to ridicule and their fate. The city had to purchase a strip of land along
the streams wide enough to guard against direct pollution. It cost millions of dollars, but
it was the merest trifle to what a cholera epidemic would have meant to New York in loss of
commercial prestige, let alone human lives. The contention over that end of it was transferred
to Albany, where the politicians took a hand. What is there they do not exploit? Years after,
meeting one of them who knew my share in it, he asked me, with a wink and a confidential shove,
"how much I got out of it." When I told him "nothing," I knew that upon my own statement he
took me for either a liar or a fool, the last being considerably the worse of the two alternatives.

In all of this battlesome account I have said nothing about the biggest fight of all. I had
that with myself.  In the years that had passed I had never forgotten the sergeant in the Church
Street police station, and my dog. It is the kind of thing you do not get over. Way back in
my mind there was the secret thought, the day I went up to Mulberry Street, that my time was
coming at last. And now it had come. I had a recognized place at Headquarters, and place in
the police world means power, more or less. The backing of the Tribune had given me influence.
More I had conquered myself in my fights with the police. Enough for revenge! At the thought
I flushed with anger. It has power yet to make my blood boil, the thought of that night in
the station-house.

It was then my great temptation came. No doubt the sergeant was still there. If not, I could
find him. I knew the day and hour when it happened.  They were burned into my brain. I had
only to turn to the department records to find out who made out the returns on that October
morning while I was walking the weary length of the trestle-work bridge across Raritan Bay,
to have him within reach. There were a hundred ways in which I could hound him then, out of
place and pay, even as he had driven me forth from the last poor shelter and caused my only
friend to be killed.

Speak not to me of the sweetness of revenge! Of all unhappy mortals the vengeful man must be
the most wretched. I suffered more in the anticipation of mine than ever I had when smarting
under the injury, grievous as the memory of it is to me even now. Day after day I went across
the street to begin the search. For hours I lingered about the record clerk's room where they
kept the old station-house blotters, unable to tear myself away. Once I even had the one from
Church Street of October, 1870, in my hands; but I did not open it. Even as I held it I saw
another and a better way. I would kill the abuse, not the man who was but the instrument and
the victim of it. For never was parody upon Christian charity more corrupting to human mind
and soul than the frightful abomination of the police lodging-house, sole provision made by
the municipality for its homeless wanderers. Within a year I have seen the process in full
operation in Chicago, have heard a sergeant in the Harrison Street Station there tell me, when
my indignation found vent in angry words, that they "cared less for those men and women than
for the cur dogs in the street." Exactly so! My sergeant was of the same stamp. Those dens,
daily association with them, had stamped him. Then and there I resolved to wipe them out, bodily,
if God gave me health and strength. And I put the book away quick and never saw it again. I
do not know till this day who the sergeant was, and I am glad I do not. It is better so.

Of what I did to carry out my purpose, and how it was done, I must tell hereafter. It was the
source and beginning of all the work which justifies the writing of these pages; and among
all the things which I have been credited with doing since it is one of the few in which I
really bore a strong hand.  And yet it was not mine which finally wrought that great work,
but a stronger and better than mine, Theodore Roosevelt's. Even while I was writing this account
we together drove in the last nail in the coffin of the bad old days, by persuading the Charter
Revision Commission to remove from the organic law of the city the clause giving to the police
the care of vagrants, which was the cause of it all. It had remained over in the Charter of
the Greater New York in spite of our protests. It was never the proper business of the police
to dispense charity. They have their hands full with repressing crime.  It is the mixing of
the two that confuses standards and makes trouble without end for those who receive the "charity,"
and even more for those who dispense it. You cannot pervert the first and finest of human instincts
without corrupting men: witness my sergeant in Church Street and his Chicago brother.

CHAPTER X

MY DOG IS AVENGED

THE lilacs blossom under my window, as I begin this chapter, and the bees are humming among
them; the sweet smell of wild cherry comes up from the garden where the sunlight lies upon
the young grass. Robin and oriole call to their mates in the trees. There upon the lawn is
Elisabeth tending some linen laid out to dry. Her form is as lithe and her step as light as
in the days I have written about, grandmother as she is. I can see, though her back is turned,
the look of affectionate pride with which she surveys our home, for I know well enough what
she is thinking of. And so it has been; a blessed, good home; how could it help being that
with her in it? They say it is a sign one is growing old when one's thoughts dwell much on
the past. Perhaps with me it is only a sign that the printers are on the war-path. Often when
I hear her sing with the children my mind wanders back to the long winter evenings in those
early years when she sat listening late for my step. She sang then to keep up her courage.
My work in Mulberry Street was at night, and she was much alone, even as I was, fighting my
battles there.  She had it out with the homesickness then, and I think hers was a good deal
the harder fight. I had the enemy all in front where I could see to whack him. But so we found
ourselves and each other, and it was worth all it cost.

Except in the short winter days it was always broad daylight when I came home from work. My
route from the office lay through the Fourth and the Sixth wards, the worst in the city, and
for years I walked every morning between two and four o'clock the whole length of Mulberry
Street, through the Bend and across the Five Points down to Fulton Ferry. There were cars on
the Bowery, but I liked to walk, for so I saw the slum when off its guard. The instinct to
pose is as strong there as it is on Fifth Avenue. It is a human impulse, I suppose. We all
like to be thought well of by our fellows. But at 3 A.M. the veneering is off and you see the
true grain of a thing. So, also, I got a picture of the Bend upon my mind which so soon as
I should be able to transfer it to that of the community would help settle with that pig-sty
according to its deserts. It was not fit for Christian men and women, let alone innocent children,
to live in, and therefore it had to go. So with the police lodging-rooms, some of the worst
of which were right there, at the Mulberry Street Station and around the corner in Elizabeth
Street. The way of it never gave me any concern that I remember.  That would open as soon as
the truth was told. The trouble was that people did not know and had no means of finding out
for themselves.  But I had. Accordingly I went poking about among the foul alleys and fouler
tenements of the Bend when they slept in their filth, sometimes with the policeman on the beat,
more often alone, sounding the misery and the depravity of it to their depth.  I think a notion
of the purpose of it all crept into the office, even while I was only half aware of it myself,
for when, after a year's service at the police office, I was taken with a longing for the open,
as it were, and went to the city editor who had succeeded Mr. Shanks with the request that
I be transferred to general work, he refused flatly. I had made a good record as a police reporter,
but it was not that.

"Go back and stay," he said. "Unless I am much mistaken, you are finding something up there
that needs you. Wait and see."

And so for the second time I was turned back to the task I wanted to shirk. Jonah was one of
us sure enough. Those who see only the whale fail to catch the point in the most human story
ever told--a point, I am afraid, that has a special application to most of us.

I have often been asked if such slumming is not full of peril. No, not if you are there on
business.  Mere sightseeing at such unseasonable hours might easily be. But the man who is
sober and minds his own business--which presupposes that he has business to mind there--runs
no risk anywhere in New York, by night or by day. Such a man will take the other side of the
street when he sees a gang ahead spoiling for a fight, and where he does go he will carry the
quiet assumption of authority that comes with the consciousness of a right to be where he is.
That usually settles it. There was perhaps another factor in my case that helped. Whether it
was my slouch hat and my spectacles, or the fact that I had been often called into requisition
to help an ambulance surgeon patch up an injured man, the nickname "Doc" had somehow stuck
to me, and I was supposed by many to be a physician connected with the Health Department. Doctors
are never molested in the slum. It does not know but that its turn to need them is coming next.
No more was I. I can think of only two occasions in more than twenty years of police reporting
when I was in actual peril, though once I was very badly frightened.

One was when a cry of murder had lured me down Crosby Street into a saloon on the corner of
Jersey Street, where the gang of the neighborhood had just stabbed the saloon-keeper in a drunken
brawl. He was lying in a chair surrounded by shrieking women when I ran in. On the instant
the doors were slammed and barred behind me, and I found myself on the battlefield with the
battle raging unabated. Bottles were flying thick and fast, and the bar was going to smash.
As I bent over the wounded man, I saw that he was done for.  The knife was even then sticking
in his neck, its point driven into the backbone. The instinct of the reporter came uppermost,
and as I pulled it out and held it up in a pause of the fray, I asked incautiously:--

"Whose knife is this?"

A whiskey-bottle that shaved within an inch of my head, followed by an angry oath, at once
recalled me to myself and showed me my role.

"You tend to your business, you infernal body-snatcher, and let us run ours," ran the message,
and I understood. I called for bandages, a sponge, and a basin, and acted the surgeon as well
as I could, trying to stanch the flow of blood, while the racket rose and the women shrieked
louder with each passing moment. Through the turmoil I strained every nerve to catch the sound
of policemen's tramp. It was hardly three minutes' run to the station-house, but time never
dragged as it did then. Once I thought relief had come; but as I listened and caught the wail
of men being beaten in the street, I smiled wickedly in the midst of my own troubles, for the
voices told me that my opponents from headquarters, following on my track, had fallen among
thieves: half the gang were then outside. At last, just as an empty keg knocked my patient
from his chair, the doors fell in with a crash; the reserves had come. Their clubs soon cleared
the air and relieved me of my involuntary task, with my patient yet alive.

Another time, turning a corner in the small hours of the morning, I came suddenly upon a gang
of drunken roughs ripe for mischief. The leader had a long dirk-knife with which he playfully
jabbed me in the ribs, insolently demanding what I thought of it. I seized him by the wrist
with as calm a pretence of considering the knife as I could summon up, but really to prevent
his cutting me. I felt the point pricking through my clothes.

"About two inches longer than the law allows," I said, sparring for time. "I think I will take
that."

I knew even as I said it that I had cast the die; he held my life in his hand. It was a simple
question of which was the stronger, and it was already decided. Despite my utmost effort to
stay it, the point of the knife was piercing my skin. The gang stood by, watching the silent
struggle. I knew them--the Why-os, the worst cutthroats in the city, charged with a dozen murders,
and robberies without end. A human life was to them, in the mood they were in, worth as much
as the dirt under their feet, no more. At that instant, not six feet behind their backs, Captain
McCullagh--the same who afterward became Chief--turned the corner with his precinct detective.
I gathered all my strength and gave the ruffian's hand a mighty twist that turned the knife
aside. I held it out for inspection.

"What do you think of it, Cap?"

Four brawny fists scattered the gang to the winds for an answer. The knife was left in my hand.

They gave me no time to get frightened. Once when I really was scared, it was entirely my own
doing. And, furthermore, it served me right. It was on a very hot July morning that, coming
down Mulberry Street, I saw a big gray cat sitting on a beer-keg outside a corner saloon. It
was fast asleep, and snored so loudly that it aroused my anger. It is bad enough to have a
man snore, but a cat--! It was not to be borne. I hauled off with my cane and gave the beast
a most cruel and undeserved blow to teach it better manners. The snoring was smothered in a
yell, the cat came down from the keg, and to my horror there rose from behind the corner an
angry Celt swearing a blue streak. He seemed to my anguished gaze at least nine feet tall.
He had been asleep at his own door when my blow aroused him, and it was his stocking feet,
propped up on the keg as he dozed in his chair around the corner, I had mistaken for a gray
cat. It was not a time for explanations. I did the only thing there was to be done; I ran.
Far and fast did I run. It was my good luck that his smarting feet kept him from following,
or I might not have lived to tell this tale. As I said, it served me right. Perhaps it is in
the way of reparation that I now support twelve cats upon my premises. Three of them are clawing
at my study door this minute demanding to be let in. But I cannot even claim the poor merit
of providing for them. It is my daughter who runs the cats; I merely growl at and feed them.

The mention of Bowery night cars brings to my mind an episode of that time which was thoroughly
characteristic of the "highway that never sleeps." I was on the way down town in one, with
a single fellow-passenger who was asleep just inside the door, his head nodding with every
jolt as though it were in danger of coming off. At Grand Street a German boarded the car and
proffered a bad half-dollar in payment of his fare. The conductor bit it and gave it back with
a grunt of contempt. The German fell into a state of excitement at once.

"Vat!" he shouted, "it vas pad?" and slapped the coin down on the wooden seat with all his
might, that we might hear the ring. It rebounded with a long slant and fell into the lap of
the sleeping passenger, who instantly woke up, grabbed the half-dollar, and vanished through
the door and into the darkness, without as much as looking around, followed by the desolate
howl of the despoiled German:--

"Himmel! One United Shdades half-dollar clean gone!"

The time came at length when I exchanged night work for day work, and I was not sorry. A new
life began for me, with greatly enlarged opportunities.  I had been absorbing impressions up
till then.  I met men now in whose companionship they began to crystallize, to form into definite
convictions; men of learning, of sympathy, and of power. My eggs hatched. From that time dates
my friendship, priceless to me, with Dr. Roger S. Tracy, then a sanitary inspector in the Health
Department, later its distinguished statistician, to whom I owe pretty much all the understanding
I have ever had of the problems I have battled with; for he is very wise, while I am rather
dull of wit. But directly I get talking things over with him, I brighten right up.  I met Professor
Charles F. Chandler, Major Willard Bullard, Dr. Edward H. Janes--men to whose practical wisdom
and patient labors in the shaping of the Health Department's work the metropolis owes a greater
debt than it is aware of; Dr. John T. Nagle, whose friendly camera later on gave me some invaluable
lessons; and General Ely Parker, Chief of the Six Nations.

I suppose it was the fact that he was an Indian that first attracted me to him. As the years
passed we became great friends, and I loved nothing better in an idle hour than to smoke a
pipe with the General in his poky little office at Police Headquarters. That was about all
there was to it, too, for he rarely opened his mouth except to grunt approval of something
I was saying. When, once in a while, it would happen that some of his people came down from
the Reservation or from Canada, the powwow that ensued was my dear delight. Three pipes and
about eleven grunts made up the whole of it, but it was none the less entirely friendly and
satisfactory. We all have our own ways of doing things, and that was theirs. He was a noble
old fellow. His title was no trumpery show, either. It was fairly earned on more than one bloody
field with Grant's army. Parker was Grant's military secretary, and wrote the original draft
of the surrender at Appomattox, which he kept to his death with great pride. It was not General
Parker, however, but Donehogawa, Chief of the Senecas and of the remnant of the once powerful
Six Nations, and guardian of the western door of the council lodge, that appealed to me, who
in my boyhood had lived with Leather-stocking and with Uncas and Chingachgook. They had something
to do with my coming here, and at last I had for a friend one of their kin. I think he felt
the bond of sympathy between us and prized it, for he showed me in many silent ways that he
was fond of me. There was about him an infinite pathos, penned up there in his old age among
the tenements of Mulberry Street on the pay of a second-rate clerk, that never ceased to appeal
to me. When he lay dead, stricken like the soldier he was at his post, some letters of his
to Mrs. Harriet Converse, the adopted child of his tribe, went to my heart. They were addressed
to her on her travels.  He was of the "wolf" tribe, she a "snipe." "From the wolf to the wandering
snipe," they ran. Even in Mulberry Street he was a true son of the forest.

Perhaps the General's sympathies went out to me as a fighter. The change of front from night
to day brought no let-up on hostilities in our camp; rather the reverse. For this there was
good cause: I had interfered with long-cherished privileges.  I found the day men coming to
work at all hours from ten to twelve or even one o'clock. I went on duty at eight, and the
immediate result was to compel all the others to do the same. This was a sore grievance, and
was held against me for a long time. The logical outcome of the war it provoked was to stretch
the day farther into the small hours. Before I left Mulberry Street the circuit had been made.
The watch now is kept up through the twenty-four hours without interruption. Like its neighbor
the Bowery, Mulberry Street never sleeps.

There had been in 1879 an awakening of the public conscience on the tenement-house question
which I had followed with interest, because it had started in the churches that have always
seemed to me to be the right forum for such a discussion, on every ground, and most for their
own sake and the cause they stand for. But the awakening proved more of a sleepy yawn than
real--like a man stretching himself in bed with half a mind to get up. Five years later, in
1884, came the Tenement-House Commission which first brought home to us the fact that the people
living in the tenements were "better than the houses." That was a big white milestone on a
dreary road. From that time on we hear of "souls" in the slum. The property end of it had held
the stage up till then, and in a kind of self-defence, I suppose, we had had to forget that
the people there had souls. Because you couldn't very well count souls as chattels yielding
so much income to the owner: it would not be polite toward the Lord, say. Sounds queer, but
if that was not the attitude I would like to know what it was. The Commission met at Police
Headquarters, and I sat through all its sessions as a reporter, and heard every word of the
testimony, which was more than some of the Commissioners did. Mr. Ottendorfer and Mr. Drexel,
the banker, took many a quiet little nap when things were dull.  One man the landlords, who
had their innings to the full, never caught off his guard. His clear, incisive questions, that
went through all subterfuges to the root of things, were sometimes like flashes of lightning
on a dark night discovering the landscape far and near. He was Dr. Felix Adler, whom I met
there for the first time. The passing years have given him a very warm place in my heart. Adler
was born a Jew. Often when I think of the position the Christian Church took, or rather did
not take, on a matter so nearly concerning it as the murder of the home in a tenement population
of a million souls,--for that was what it came to,--I am reminded of a talk we had once in
Dr. Adler's study. I was going to Boston to speak to a body of clergymen at their monthly dinner
meeting. He had shortly before received an invitation to address the same body on "The Personality
of Christ," but had it in his mind not to go.

"What will you tell them?" I asked.

The Doctor smiled a thoughtful little smile as he said: "I shall tell them that the personality
of Christ is too sacred a subject for me to discuss at an after-dinner meeting in a swell hotel."

Does that help you to understand that among the strongest of moral forces in Christian New
York was and is Adler, the Jew or heretic, take it whichever way you please?

Four years later the finishing touch was put to the course I took with the Adler Tenement-House
Commission, when, toward the end of a three days' session in Chickering Hall of ministers of
every sect who were concerned about the losing fight the Church was waging among the masses,
a man stood in the meeting and cried out, "How are these men and women to understand the love
of God you speak of, when they see only the greed of men?" He was a builder, Alfred T. White
of Brooklyn, who had proved the faith that was in him by building real homes for the people,
and had proved, too, that they were a paying investment. It was just a question whether a man
would take seven per cent and save his soul, or twenty-five and lose it. And I might as well
add here that it is the same story yet. All our hopes for betterment, all our battling with
the tenement-house question, sum themselves up in the effort, since there are men yet who would
take twenty-five per cent and run that risk, to compel them to take seven and save their souls
for them.  I wanted to jump up in my seat at that time and shout Amen! But I remembered that
I was a reporter and kept still. It was that same winter, however, that I wrote the title of
my book, "How the Other Half Lives," and copyrighted it. The book itself did not come until
two years after, but it was as good as written then. I had my text.

It was at that Chickering Hall meeting that I heard the gospel preached to the poor in the
only way that will ever reach them. It was the last word that was said, and I have always believed
that it was not exactly in the plan. I saw some venerable brethren on the platform, bishops
among them, wince when Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, rending some eminently respectable platitudes
to shreds and tatters, cried out for personal service, loving touch, as the key to it all:--
