To mention the remaining schools of Italy in detail would be superfluous. True art still flourished
at Ferrara, where Garofalo endeavoured to carry on the Roman manner of Raphael without the
necessary strength or ideality, but also without the soulless insincerity of the mannerists.
His best quality was colouring, gemlike and rich; but this found little scope for exercise
in the dry and laboured style he affected. Dosso Dossi fared better, perhaps through having
never experienced the seductions of Rome. His glowing colour and quaint fancy give the attraction
of romance to many of his pictures. The "Circe," for example, of the Borghese Palace, is worthy
to rank with the best Renaissance work. It is perfectly original, not even suggesting the influence
of Venice by its deep and lustrous hues. No painting is more fit to illustrate the "Orlando
Innamorato." Just so, we feel in looking at it, did Dragontina show herself to Boiardo's fancy.
Ariosto's Alcina belongs to a different family of magnificent witches.

Cremona, at this epoch, had a school of painters, influenced almost equally by the Venetians,
the Milanese, and the Roman mannerists. The Campi family covered those grave Lombard vaults
with stucco, fresco, and gilding in a style only just removed from the barocco.[407] Brescia
and Bergamo remained within the influence of Venice, producing work of nearly first-rate quality
in Moretto, Romanino, and Lorenzo Lotto. Moroni, the pupil of Moretto, was destined to become
one of the most powerful character painters of the modern world, and to enrich the studies
of historians and artists with a series of portraits impressive by their fidelity to the spirit
of the sixteenth century at its conclusion. Venice herself at this period was still producing
masterpieces of the genuine Renaissance. But the decline into mannerism, caused by circumstances
similar to those of Rome, was not far distant.

It may seem strange to those who have visited the picture galleries of Italy, and have noticed
how very large a number of the painters flourished after 1550, that I should have persistently
spoken of the last half of the sixteenth century as a period of decadence. This it was, however,
in a deep and true sense of the word. The force of the Renaissance was exhausted, and a time
of relaxation had to be passed through, before the reaction known as the Counter-Reformation
could make itself felt in art. Then, and not till then, a new spiritual impulse produced a
new style. This secondary growth of painting began to flourish at Bologna in accordance with
fresh laws of taste. Religious sentiments of a different order had to be expressed; society
had undergone a change, and the arts were governed by a genuine, if far inferior, inspiration.
Meanwhile, the Renaissance, so far as Italy is concerned, was ended.

It is one of the sad features of this subject, that each section has to end in lamentation.
Servitude in the sphere of politics; literary feebleness in scholarship; decadence in art:--to
shun these conclusions is impossible. He who has undertaken to describe the parabola of a projectile,
cannot be satisfied with tracing its gradual rise and determining its culmination. He must
follow its spent force, and watch it slowly sink with ever dwindling impetus to earth. Intellectual
movements, when we isolate them in a special country, observing the causes that set them in
motion and calculating their retarding influences, may, not unreasonably, be compared to the
parabola of a projectile. To shrink from studying the decline of mental vigour in Italy upon
the close of the Renaissance, would be therefore weak; though the task of tracing the impulse
communicated by her previous energy to other nations, and their stirring under a like movement,
might be more agreeable.

APPENDICES

APPENDIX I

The Pulpits of Pisa and Ravello

Having tried to characterise Niccola Pisano's relation to early Italian art in the second chapter
of this volume, I adverted to the recent doubts which have been thrown by very competent authorities
upon Vasari's legend of this master. Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle, while discussing the question
of his birthplace and his early training, observe, what is no doubt true, that there are no
traces of good sculpture in Pisa antecedent to the Baptistery pulpit of 1260, and remark that
for such a phenomenon as the sudden appearance of this masterpiece it is needful to seek some
antecedents elsewhere.[408] This leads them to ask whether Niccola did not owe his origin and
education to some other part of Italy. Finding at Ravello, near Amain, a pulpit sculptured
in 1272 by Niccola di Bartolommeo da Foggia, they suggest that a school of stone-carvers may
have flourished at Foggia, and that Niccola Pisano, in spite of his signing himself Pisanus
on the Baptistery pulpit, may have been an Apulian trained in that school. The arguments adduced
in favour of that hypothesis are that Niccola's father, though commonly believed to have been
Ser Pietro da Siena, was perhaps called Pietro di Apulia,[409] and that meritorious artists
certainly existed at Foggia and Trani. Yet the resemblance of style between the pulpits at
Ravello [1272] and Pisa [1260], if that indeed exists (whereof hereafter more must be said),
might be used to prove that Niccola da Foggia learned his art from Niccola Pisano, instead
of the contrary; nor again, supposing the Apulian school to have flourished before 1260, is
it inconsistent with the tradition of Niccola's life that he should have learned the sculptor's
craft while working in his youth at Naples. For the rest, Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle dismiss
the story of Pisano's studying the antique bas-reliefs at Pisa with contempt;[410] but they
omit to notice the actual transcripts from those marbles introduced into his first pulpit.
Again, they assume that the lunette at Lucca was one of his latest works, giving precedence
to the pulpits of Pisa and Siena and the fountain of Perugia. A comparison of style no doubt
renders this view plausible; for the lunette at Lucca is superior to any other of Pisano's
works as a composition.

The full discussion of these points is rendered impossible by the want of contemporary information,
and each student must, therefore, remain contented with his own hypothesis. Yet something can
be said with regard to the Ravello pulpit that plays so important a part in the argument of
the learned historians of Italian painting. Unless a strong similarity between it and Pisano's
pulpits can be proved, their hypothesis carries with it no persuasion.

The pulpit in the cathedral of Ravello is formed like an ambo of the antique type. That is
to say, it is a long parallelogram with flat sides, raised upon pillars, and approached by
a flight of steps. These steps are enclosed within richly-ornamented walls, and stand distinct
from the pulpit; a short bridge connects the two. The six pillars supporting the ambo itself
are slender twisted columns with classic capitals. Three rest on lions, three on lionesses,
admirably carved in different attitudes. A small projection on the north side of the pulpit
sustains an eagle standing on a pillar, and spreading out his wings to bear an open book. On
the arch over the entrance to the staircase projects the head of Sigelgaita, wife of Niccola
Rufolo, the donor of the pulpit to the church, sculptured in the style of the Roman decadence,
between two profile medallions in low relief.[411] The material of the whole is fair white
marble, enriched with mosaics, and wrought into beautiful scroll-work of acanthus leaves and
other Romanesque adornments. An inscription, "Ego Magister Nicolaus de Bartholomeo de Fogia
Marmorarius hoc opus feci;" and another, "Lapsis millenis bis centum bisque trigenis XPI. bissenis
annis ab origine plenis," indicate the artist's name and the date of the work.

It is difficult to understand how anyone could trace such a resemblance between this rectangular
ambo and the hexagonal structure in the Pisan Baptistery as would justify them in asserting
both to be the products of the same school. The pulpit of Niccola da Foggia does not materially
differ from other ambones in Italy--from several, for instance, in Amalfi and Ravello; while
the distinctive features of Niccola Pisano's work--the combination of classically studied bas-reliefs
with Gothic principles of construction, the feeling for artistic unity in the composition of
groups, the mastery over plastic form, and the detached allegorical figures--are noticeable
only by their total absence from it. What is left by way of similarity is a sculpturesque refinement
in Sigelgaita's portrait, not unworthy of Pisano's own chisel. This, however, is but a slender
point whereon to base so large a pyramid of pure conjecture. Surely we must look elsewhere
than at Ravello or at Foggia for the origin of Niccola Pisano.

Why then should we reject tradition in this instance? Messrs. Crowe and Cavalcaselle reply;
because the sculpture of no Tuscan city before his period is good enough to have led up to
him. Yet this may be contested; and at all events it will not be easy to prove from the Ravello
head of Sigelgaita that a more advanced school existed in the south. The fact is that the art
of the stone-carvers or marmorarii had never entirely died out since the days of Roman greatness;
nor was Niccola without respectable predecessors in the very town of Lucca, where he produced
the first masterpiece of modern sculpture. The circular font of S. Frediano, for example, carved
with figures in high relief by a certain Robertus of the twelfth century, combines the Romanesque
mannerism with the naïveté of mediaeval fancy. I might point in particular to two knights seated
on one horse in what I take to be the company of Pharaoh crossing the Red Sea, as an instance
of a successful attempt to escape from the formalism of a decayed style. At the same time the
general effect of the embossed work of this font is fine; nor do we fail to perceive that the
artist retained some portion of the classic feeling for grandiose and monumental composition.
Far less noteworthy, yet still not utterly despicable, is the bas-relief of Biduinus over the
side-door of S. Salvatore at Lucca. What Niccola added of indefeasibly his own to the style
of these continuators of a dead tradition, was feeling for the beauty of classical work in
a good age, and through that feeling a more perfect sympathy with nature. It is just at this
point that the old tale about the sarcophagus of the Countess Beatrice conveys not only the
letter but the spirit of the fact. Niccola's genius, no less vivid and life-giving than that
of Giotto, infused into the hard and formal manner of his immediate predecessors true nature
and true art. Between the bas-relief of S. Salvatore and the bas-relief over the north door
of the Duomo at Lucca, there is indeed a broad gulf, yet such as might have been passed at
one bound by a master into whose soul the beauty of a fragment of Greek art had sunk, and who
had received at his birth the gift of a creative genius.

[411] Mr. Perkins, following the suggestion of Panza, in his Istoria dell' Antica Republica
d'Amalfi, is inclined to think that this head represents, not Sigelgaita, but Joanna II. of
Naples, and is therefore more than a century later in date than the pulpit. See Italian Sculptors,
p. 51.

APPENDIX II

Michael Angelo's Sonnets

After the death of Michael Angelo, the manuscripts of his sonnets, madrigals, and other poems,
written at various periods of his life, and well known to his intimate friends, passed into
the hands of his nephew, Lionardo Buonarroti. From Lionardo they descended to his son, Michael
Angelo, who was himself a poet of some mark. This grand-nephew of the sculptor prepared them
for the press, and gave them to the world in 1623. On his redaction the commonly received version
of the poems rested until 1863, when Signor Cesare Guasti of Florence, having gained access
to the original manuscripts, published a critical edition, preserving every peculiarity of
the autograph, and adding a prose paraphrase for the explanation of the text.

The younger Michael Angelo, working in an age of literary pedantry and moral prudery, fancied
that it was his duty to refine the style of his great ancestor, and to remove allusions open
to ignorant misconstruction. Instead, therefore, of giving an exact transcript of the original
poems, he set himself to soften down their harshness, to clear away their obscurity, to amplify,
transpose, and mutilate according to his own ideas of syntax, taste, and rhetoric. On the Dantesque
ruggedness of Michael Angelo he engrafted the prettiness of the seventeenth Petrarchisti; and
where he thought the morality of the poems was questionable, especially in the case of those
addressed to Cavalieri, he did not hesitate to introduce such alterations as destroyed their
obvious intention. In order to understand the effect of this method, it is only necessary to
compare the autograph as printed by Guasti with the version of 1623. In Sonnet xxxi., for example,
the two copies agree in only one line, while the remaining thirteen are distorted and adorned
with superfluous conceits by the over-scrupulous but not too conscientious editor of 1623.[412]

Michael Angelo's poems, even after his grand-nephew had tried to reduce them to lucidity and
order, have always been considered obscure and crabbed. Nor can it be pretended that they gain
in smoothness and clearness by the restoration of the true readings. On the contrary, instances
of defective grammar, harsh elisions, strained metaphors, and incomplete expressions are multiplied.
The difficulty of comprehending the sense is rather increased than diminished, and the obstacles
to a translator become still more insurmountable than Wordsworth found them.[413] This being
undoubtedly the case, the value of Guasti's edition for students of Michael Angelo is nevertheless
inestimable. We read now for the first time what the greatest man of the sixteenth century
actually wrote, and are able to enter, without the interference of a fictitious veil, into
the shrine of his own thought and feeling. His sonnets form the best commentary on Michael
Angelo's solitary life and on his sublime ideal of art. This reflection has guided me in the
choice of those now offered in English, as an illustration of the chapter in this volume devoted
to their author's biography.

Though the dates of Michael Angelo's compositions are conjectural, it may be assumed that the
two sonnets on Dante were written when he was himself in exile. We know that, while sojourning
in the house of Gian Francesco Aldovrandini at Bologna, he used to spend a portion of his time
in reading Dante aloud to his protector;[414] and the indignation expressed against Florence,
then as ever fickle and ungrateful, the gente avara, invidiosa, e superba, to use Dante's own
words, seems proper to a period of just resentment. Still there is no certainty that they belong
to 1495; for throughout his long life Michael Angelo was occupied with Dante.

About the date of the two next sonnets there is less doubt. The first was clearly written when
Michael Angelo was smarting under a sense of the ill-treatment he received from Julius. The
second, composed at Rome, is interesting as the only proof we possess of the impression made
upon his mind by the anomalies of the Papal rule. It was written while Michael Angelo was painting
the roof of the Sistine, and was sent to his friend Giovanni da Pistoja.

The majority of the sonnets are devoted to love and beauty, conceived in
the spirit of exalted Platonism.
    But He who dwells in heaven all things doth fill
      With beauty by pure motions of his own;
      And since tools fashion tools which else were none,
    His life makes all that lives with living skill.

    Now, for that every stroke excels the more
      The closer to the forge it still ascend,
      Her soul that quickened mine hath sought the skies:
    Wherefore I find my toil will never end,
      If God, the great artificer, denies
      That tool which was my only aid before.

The next is peculiarly valuable, as proving with what intense and religious fervour Michael
Angelo addressed himself to the worship of intellectual beauty.

The same Platonic theme is slightly varied in the two following sonnets:[424]--

SPIRTO BEN NATO

    Choice soul, in whom, as in a glass, we see,
      Mirrored in thy pure form and delicate,
      What beauties heaven and nature can create,
    The paragon of all their works to be!
    Fair soul, in whom love, pity, piety,
      Have found a home, as from thy outward state
      We clearly read, and are so rare and great
    That they adorn none other like to thee!

    Love takes me captive; beauty binds my soul;
      Pity and mercy with their gentle eyes
      Wake in my heart a hope that cannot cheat.
    What law, what destiny, what fell control,
      What cruelty, or late or soon, denies
      That death should spare perfection so complete?

DAI DOLCE PIANTO

    From sweet laments to bitter joys, from peace
      Eternal to a brief and hollow truce,
      How have I fallen!--when 'tis truth we lose,
    Mere sense survives our reason's dear decease.
    I know not if my heart bred this disease,
      That still more pleasing grows with growing use;
      Or else thy face, thine eyes, in which the hues
    And fires of Paradise dart ecstasies.

    Thy beauty is no mortal thing; 'twas sent
      From heaven on high to make our earth divine:
      Wherefore, though wasting, burning, I'm content;
    For in thy sight what could I do but pine?
      If God Himself thus rules my destiny,
      Who, when I die, can lay the blame on thee?

The next is saddened by old age and death. Love has yielded to piety, and is only remembered
as what used to be. Yet in form and feeling this is quite one of the most beautiful in the
series supposed to refer to Vittoria Colonna:[425]--

TORNAMI AL TEMPO

    Bring back the time when blind desire ran free,
      With bit and rein too loose to curb his flight;
      Give back the buried face, once angel-bright,
    That hides in earth all comely things from me;
    Bring back those journeys ta'en so toilsomely,
      So toilsome-slow to him whose hairs are white;
      Those tears and flames that in one breast unite;
    If thou wilt once more take thy fill of me!

    Yet Love! Suppose it true that thou dost thrive
      Only on bitter honey-dews of tears,
      Small profit hast thou of a weak old man.
    My soul that toward the other shore doth strive,
      Wards off thy darts with shafts of holier fears;
      And fire feeds ill on brands no breath can fan.
    The ill I shun, the good I seek, even so
      In thee, fair lady, proud, ineffable,
      Lies hidden: but the art I wield so well
    Works adverse to my wish, and lays me low.

    Therefore not love, nor thy transcendent face,
      Nor cruelty, nor fortune, nor disdain,
      Cause my mischance, nor fate, nor destiny:
    Since in thy heart thou carriest death and grace
      Enclosed together, and my worthless brain
      Can draw forth only death to feed on me.

The fire of youth was not extinct, we feel, after reading these last sonnets. There is, indeed,
an almost pathetic intensity of passion in the recurrence of Michael Angelo's thoughts to a
sublime love on the verge of the grave. Not less important in their bearing on his state of
feeling are the sonnets addressed to Cavalieri; and though his modern editor shrinks from putting
a literal interpretation upon them, I am convinced that we must accept them simply as an expression
of the artist's homage for the worth and beauty of an excellent young man. The two sonnets
I intend to quote next[427] were written, according to Varchi's direct testimony, for Tommaso
Cavalieri, "in whom"--the words are Varchi's--"I discovered, besides incomparable personal
beauty, so much charm of nature, such excellent abilities, and such a graceful manner, that
he deserved, and still deserves, to be the better loved the more he is known." The play of
words upon Cavalieri's name in the last line of the first sonnet, the evidence of Varchi, and
the indirect witness of Condivi, together with Michael Angelo's own letters,[428] are sufficient
in my judgment to warrant the explanation I have given above. Nor do I think that the doubts
expressed by Guasti about the intention of the sonnets,[429] or Gotti's curious theory that
the letters, though addressed to Cavalieri, were meant for Vittoria Colonna,[430] are much
more honourable to Michael Angelo's reputation than the garbling process whereby the verses
were rendered unintelligible in the edition of 1623.

Whether we are justified in assigning the following pair to the Cavalieri series is more doubtful.
They seem, however, to proceed from a similar mood of the poet's mind.[431]

S' UN CASTO AMOR

    If love be chaste, if virtue conquer ill,
      If fortune bind both lovers in one bond,
      If either at the other's grief despond,
    If both be governed by one life, one will;
    If in two bodies one soul triumph still,
      Raising the twain from earth to heaven beyond,
      If love with one blow and one golden wand
    Have power both smitten breasts to pierce and thrill;

    If each the other love, himself foregoing,
      With such delight, such savour, and so well,
      That both to one sole end their wills combine;
    If thousands of these thoughts all thought outgoing
      Fail the least part of their firm love to tell;
      Say, can mere angry spite this knot untwine?

COLUI CHE FECE

    He who ordained, when first the world began,
      Time that was not before creation's hour,
      Divided it, and gave the sun's high power
    To rule the one, the moon the other span:
    Thence fate and changeful chance and fortune's ban
      Did in one moment down on mortals shower:
      To me they portioned darkness for a dower;
    Dark hath my lot been since I was a man.

    Myself am ever mine own counterfeit;
      And as deep night grows still more dim and dun,
      So still of more mis-doing must I rue:
    Meanwhile this solace to my soul is sweet,
      That my black night doth make more clear the sun
      Which at your birth was given to wait on you.

A sonnet written for Luigi del Riccio, on the death of his friend Cecchino Bracci, is curious
on account of its conceit.[432] Michael Angelo says: "Cecchino, whom you loved, is dead; and
if I am to make his portrait, I can only do so by drawing you, in whom he still lives." Here,
again, we trace the Platonic conception of love as nothing if not spiritual, and of beauty
as a form that finds its immortality within the lover's soul. This Cecchino was a boy who died
at the age of seventeen. Michael Angelo wrote his epicedion in several centuries of verses,
distributed among his friends in the form of what he terms polizzini, as though they were trifles.

In contrast with the philosophical obscurity of many of the sonnets hitherto quoted, I place
the following address to Night--one, certainly, of Michael Angelo's most beautiful and characteristic
compositions, as it is also the most transparent in style[433]:--

O NOTT', O DOLCE TEMPO

    O night, O sweet though sombre span of time!--
      All things find rest upon their journey's end--
      Whoso hath praised thee, well doth apprehend;
    And whoso honours thee, hath wisdom's prime.
    Our cares thou canst to quietude sublime,
      For dews and darkness are of peace the friend;
      Often by thee in dreams upborne I wend
    From earth to heaven, where yet I hope to climb.

    Thou shade of Death, through whom the soul at length
      Shuns pain and sadness hostile to the heart,
      Whom mourners find their last and sure relief!
    Thou dost restore our suffering flesh to strength,
      Driest our tears, assuagest every smart,
      Purging the spirits of the pure from grief.

The religious sonnets have been reserved to the last. These were composed in old age, when
the early impressions of Savonarola's teaching revived, and when Michael Angelo had grown to
regard even his art and the beauty he had loved go purely, as a snare. If we did not bear in
mind the piety expressed throughout his correspondence, their ascetic tone, and the remorse
they seem to indicate, would convey a painful sense of cheerlessness and disappointment. As
it is, they strike me as the natural utterance of a profoundly devout and somewhat melancholy
man, in whom religion has survived all other interests, and who, reviewing his past life of
fame and toil, finds that the sole reality is God.

The same note is struck in the following, which breathes the spirit of a Penitential Psalm:[435]--

CARICO D' ANNI

    Burdened with years and full of sinfulness,
      With evil custom grown inveterate,
      Both deaths I dread that close before me wait,
    Yet feed my heart on poisonous thoughts no less.
    No strength I find in mine own feebleness
      To change or life or love or use or fate,
      Unless Thy heavenly guidance come, though late,
    Which only helps and stays our nothingness.

    'Tis not enough, dear Lord, to make me yearn
      For that celestial home, where yet my soul
      May be new made, and not, as erst, of nought:
    Nay, ere Thou strip her mortal vestment, turn
      My steps toward the steep ascent, that whole
      And pure before Thy face she may be brought.

In reading the two next, we may remember that, at the end of his life, Michael Angelo was occupied
with designs for a picture of the Crucifixion, which he never executed, though he gave a drawing
of Christ upon the cross to Vittoria Colonna; and that his last work in marble was the unfinished
"Pietà" in the Duomo at Florence.[436]

SCARCO D' UN IMPORTUNA

    Freed from a burden sore and grievous band,
      Dear Lord, and from this wearying world untied,
      Like a frail bark I turn me to Thy side,
    As from a fierce storm to a tranquil land.
    Thy thorns, Thy nails, and either bleeding hand,
      With Thy mild gentle piteous face, provide
      Promise of help and mercies multiplied,
    And hope that yet my soul secure may stand.

    Let not Thy holy eyes be just to see
      My evil past, Thy chastened ears to hear
      And stretch the arm of judgment to my crime:
    Let Thy blood only lave and succour me,
      Yielding more perfect pardon, better cheer
      As older still I grow with lengthening time.

NON FUR MEN LIETI

    Not less elate than smitten with wild woe
      To see not them but Thee by death undone,
      Were those blest souls, when Thou above the sun
    Didst raise, by dying, men that lay so low:
    Elate, since freedom from all ills that flow
      From their first fault for Adam's race was won;
      Sore smitten, since in torment fierce God's son
    Served servants on the cruel cross below.

    Heaven showed she knew Thee, who Thou wert and whence,
      Veiling her eyes above the riven earth;
      The mountains trembled and the seas were troubled:
    He took the Fathers from hell's darkness dense:
      The torments of the damned fiends redoubled:
      Man only joyed, who gained baptismal birth.

The collection of his poems is closed with yet another sonnet in the same lofty strain of prayer,
and faith, and hope in God.[437]

MENTRE M' ATTRISTA

    Mid weariness and woe I find some cheer
      In thinking of the past, when I recall
      My weakness and my sins and reckon all
    The vain expense of days that disappear:
    This cheers by making, ere I die, more clear
      The frailty of what men delight miscall;
      But saddens me to think how rarely fall
    God's grace and mercies in life's latest year.

    For though Thy promises our faith compel,
      Yet, Lord, what man shall venture to maintain
      That pity will condone our long neglect?
    Still, from Thy blood poured forth we know full well
      How without measure was Thy martyr's pain,
      How measureless the gifts we dare expect.

From the thought of Dante, through Plato, to the thought of Christ: so our study of Michael
Angelo's sonnets has carried us. In communion with these highest souls Michael Angelo habitually
lived; for he was born of their lineage, and was like them a lifelong alien on the earth.

APPENDIX III

Chronological Tables of the Principal Artists mentioned in this Volume

The lists which follow have been, drawn up with a view to assisting the reader of my chapters
on Architecture, Sculpture, and Painting. I have only included the more prominent names; and
these I have placed in the order of their occurrence in the foregoing pages. In compiling them,
I have consulted the Index to Le Monnier's edition of Vasari (1870), Crowe and Cavalcaselle's
"History of Painting," and Milizia's "Dictionary of Architects."
