Some of the hymns embodied in them, as well as the incantations and magical ceremonies, were
doubtless familiar to the people or derived from current superstitions. The work in which the
hymns were collected and procured, and which has been compared with the Veda of India, was
at once the Bible and the Prayer-book of Chaldea. The hymns were in Sumerian, which thus became
a sacred language, and any mistake in the recitation of them was held to be fatal to the validity
of a religious rite. Not only, therefore, were the hymns provided with a Semitic translation,
but from time to time directions were added regarding the pronunciation of certain words. The
bulk of the hymns was of Sumerian origin, but many new hymns, chiefly in honor of the Sun-god,
had been added to them in Semitic times. They were, however, written in the old language of
Sumer; like Latin in the Roman Catholic Church, that alone was considered worthy of being used
in the service of the gods. It was only the rubric which was allowed to be written in Semitic;
the hymns and most of the prayers were in what had come to be termed “the pure” or “sacred
language” of the Sumerians. Each hymn is introduced by the words “to be recited,” and ends
with amanû, or “Amen.”

The religious services were incessant. Every day the sacrifice was offered, accompanied by
a special ritual, and the festivals and fasts filled up each month of the year. There were
services even for the night as well as for the day. The new moons were strictly observed, and
the seventh day was one of solemn rest. The very name Sabattu or “Sabbath” was derived by the
native etymologists from the Sumerian words sa, “heart,” and bat, “to end,” because it was
“a day of rest for the heart.” Not only were there Sabbaths on the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first,
and twenty-eighth days of the month, there was also a Sabbath on the nineteenth, that being
the end of the seventh week from the first day of the previous month. On these Sabbaths no
work was permitted to be done. The King, it was laid down, “must not eat flesh cooked at the
fire or in the smoke; must not change his clothes; must not put on white garments; must not
offer sacrifices; must not drive in his chariot; or issue royal decrees.” Even the prophet
was forbidden to practise augury or give medicine to the sick.

From time to time extraordinary days of public humiliation or thanksgiving were ordered to
be observed. These were prescribed by the government and were generally the result of some
political crisis or danger. When the Assyrian empire, for instance, was attacked by the nations
of the north in the early part of Esar-haddon’s reign, public prayers and fasts “for one hundred
days and one hundred nights” were ordained by the “prophets” in the hope that the Sun-god might
“remove the sin” of the people and stave off the threatened attack. So, again, when Assur-bani-pal
had suppressed the Babylonian revolt and taken Babylon after a long siege, he tells us that
“at the instance of the prophets he purified the mercy-seats and cleansed the processional
roads that had been polluted; the wrathful gods and angry goddesses he appeased with special
prayers and penitential psalms.”

The temple was erected on ground that had been consecrated by libations of wine, oil, and honey,
and was a square or rectangular building enclosing an open court, on one side of which was
a ziggurat, or “tower.” The tower was built in successive stages, and in the topmost stage
was the shrine of the god. Each “tower” had a name of its own, and was used for astronomical
purposes. It corresponded with “the high-place” of Canaan; in the flat plain of Babylonia it
was only by means of a tower that the worshipper could “mount up to heaven” and so approach
the gods. Herodotus states that the topmost story of the tower attached to the temple of Bel
Merodach at Babylon contained nothing but a couch and a table.

The image of the god stood in the innermost shrine or Holy of Holies of the temple itself.
In front of it was the golden table on which the shew-bread was laid, and below was the parakku,
or “mercy-seat,” whereon, according to Nebuchadnezzar, at the festival of the new year, “on
the eighth and eleventh days, the king of the gods of heaven and earth, Bel, the god, seats
himself, while the gods of heaven and earth reverently regard him, standing before him with
bowed heads.” It was “the seat of the oracles” which were delivered from it by the god to his
ministering priests.

In front of the shrine was an altar cased in gold, and another altar stood in the outer court.
Here also was the great bason of bronze for purificatory purposes, which was called “the deep,”
and corresponded with the “sea” of Solomon’s temple. Like the latter, it sometimes stood on
the heads of twelve bronze oxen, as we learn from a hymn in which the construction of one of
these basons is described. They were supposed to represent the primeval “deep” out of which
the world has arisen and on which it still floats.

The chapel found by Mr. Hormund Rassam at Balawât, near Nineveh, gives us some idea of what
the inner shrine of a temple was like. At its north-west end was an altar approached by steps,
while in front of the latter, and near the entrance, was a coffer or ark in which two small
slabs of marble were deposited, twelve and one-half inches long by eight wide, on which the
Assyrian King Assur-nazir-pal in a duplicate text records his erection of the sanctuary. It
is not surprising that when the Nestorian workmen found the tablets, they believed that they
had discovered the two tables of the Mosaic Law.

The temple sometimes enclosed a Bit-ili or Beth-el. This was originally an upright stone, consecrated
by oil and believed to be animated by the divine spirit. The “Black Stone” in the kaaba of
the temple of Mecca is a still surviving example of the veneration paid by the Semitic nations
to sacred stones. Whether, however, the Beth-els of later Babylonian days were like the “Black
Stone” of Mecca, really the consecrated stones which had once served as temples, we do not
know; in any case they were anchored within the walls of the temples which had taken their
place as the seats of the worship of the gods. Offerings were still made to them in the age
of Nebuchadnezzar and his successors; thus we hear of 765 “measures” of grain which were paid
as “dues to the Beth-el” by the serfs of one of the Babylonian temples. The “measure,” it may
be stated, was an old measure of capacity, retained among the peasantry, and only approximately
exact. It was calculated to contain from 41 to 43 qas.

The offerings to the gods were divided into sacrifices and meal-offerings. The ox, sheep, lamb,
kid, and dove were offered in sacrifice—fruit, vegetables, bread, wine, oil, and spices where
no blood was required to be shed. There were also sin-offerings and heave-offerings, when the
offering was first “lifted up” before the gods. A contract dated in the thirty-second year
of Nebuchadnezzar tells something about the parts of the animals which were sacrificed, though
unfortunately the meaning of many of the technical words used in it is still unknown: “Izkur-Merodach,
the son of Imbriya, the son of Ilei-Merodach, of his own free will has given for the future
to Nebo-balasu-iqbi, the son of Kuddinu, the son of Ilei-Merodach, the slaughterers of the
oxen and sheep for the sacrifices of the king, the prescribed offerings, the peace-offerings
(?) of the whole year—viz., the caul round the heart, the chine, the covering of the ribs,
the …, the mouth of the stomach, and the …, as well as during the year 7,000 sin-offerings
and 100 sheep before Iskhara, who dwells in the temple of Sa-turra in Babylon (not excepting
the soft parts of the flesh, the trotters (?), the juicy meat, and the salted (?) flesh), and
also the slaughterers of the oxen, sheep, birds, and lambs due on the 8th day of Nisan, (and)
the heave-offering of an ox and a sheep before Pap-sukal of Bit-Kiduz-Kani, the temple of Nin-ip
and the temple of Anu on the further bank of the New Town in Babylon.” The 8th of Nisan, or
March, was the first day of the festival of the New Year.

The hierarchy of priests was large. At its head was the patesi, or high-priest, who in the
early days of Babylonian history was a civil as well as an ecclesiastical ruler. He lost his
temporal power with the rise of the kings. But at first the King was also a patesi, and it
is probable that in many cases at least it was the high-priest who made himself a king by subjecting
to his authority the patesis or priestly rulers of other states. In Assyria the change of the
high-priest into a king was accompanied by revolt from the supremacy of Babylonia.

With the establishment of a monarchy the high-priest lost more and more his old power and attributes,
and tended to disappear altogether, or to become merely the vicegerent or representative of
the King. The King himself, mindful of his sacerdotal origin, still claimed semi-priestly powers.
But he now called himself a sangu or “chief priest” rather than a patesi; in fact, the latter
name was retained only from antiquarian motives. The individual high-priest passed away, and
was succeeded by the class of “chief priests.” Under them were several subordinate classes
of temple servants. There were, for instance, the enû, or “elders,” and the pasisû, or “anointers,”
whose duty it was to anoint the images of the gods and the sacred vessels of the temple with
oil, and who are sometimes included among the ramkû, or “offerers of libations,” as well. By
the side of them stood asipu, or “prophet,” who interpreted the will of heaven, and even accompanied
the army on its march, deciding when it might attack the enemy with success, or when the gods
refused to grant it victory. Next to the prophet came the makhkhû or interpreter of dreams,
as well as the barû, or “seer.”

A very important class of temple-servants were the kalî, or “eunuch-priests,” the galli of
the religions of Asia Minor. They were under a “chief kalû,” and were sometimes entitled “the
servants of Istar.” It was indeed to her worship that they were specially consecrated, like
the ukhâtu and kharimâtu, or female hierodules. Erech, with its sanctuary of Anu and Istar,
was the place where these latter were chiefly to be found; here they performed their dances
in honor of the goddess and mourned over the death of Tammuz.

Closely connected with the kalî was a sort of monastic institution, which seems to have been
attached to some of the Babylonian temples. The Zikari, who belonged to it, were forbidden
to marry, and it is possible that they were eunuchs like the kalî. They, too, were under a
chief or president, and their main duty was to attend to the daily sacrifice and to minister
to the higher order of priests. In this respect they resembled the Levites at Jerusalem; indeed
they are frequently termed “servants” in the inscriptions, though they were neither serfs nor
slaves. They could be dedicated to the service of the Sun-god from childhood. A parallel to
the dedication of Samuel is to be found in a deed dated at Sippara on the 21st of Nisan, in
the fifth year of Cambyses, in which “Ummu-dhabat, the daughter of Nebo-bel-uzur,” whose father-in-law
was the priest of the Sun-god, is stated to have brought her three sons to him, and to have
made the following declaration before another priest of the same deity: “My sons have not yet
entered the House of the Males (Zikari); I have hitherto lived with them; I have grown old
with them since they were little, until they have been counted among men.” Then she took them
into the “House of the Males” and “gave” them to the service of the god. We learn from this
and other documents that the Zikari lived together in a monastery or college within the walls
of the temple, and that monthly rations of food were allotted to them from the temple revenues.

The ordinary priests were married, though the wife of a priest was not herself a priestess.
There were priestesses, however, as well as female recluses, who, like the Zikari, were not
allowed to marry and were devoted to the service of the Sun-god. They lived in the temple,
but were able to hold property of their own, and even to carry on business with it. A portion
of the profits, nevertheless, went to the treasury of the temple, out of whose revenues they
were themselves supplied with food. From contracts of the time of Khammurabi we gather that
many of them not only belonged to the leading families of Babylonia, but that they might be
relations of the King.

Wholly distinct from these devotees of the Sun-god were the female hierodules or prostitutes
of Istar, to whom reference has already been made. Distinct from them, again, were the prophetesses
of Istar, who prophesied the future and interpreted the oracles of the goddess. One of their
chief seats was the temple of Istar at Arbela, and a collection of the oracles delivered by
them and their brother prophets to Esar-haddon has been preserved. Thine enemies shall melt
away from before thy feet like the floods in Sivan. I advance and I stand still!” It is probable
that these prophetesses were not ordained to their office, but that it depended on their possession
of the “spirit of inspiration.” At all events, we find men as well as women acting as the mouth-pieces
of Istar, and in one instance the woman describes herself as a native of a neighboring village
“in the mountains.”

The revenues of the temples and priesthood were derived partly from endowments, partly from
compulsory or voluntary offerings. Among the compulsory offerings were the esrâ, or “tithes.”
These had to be paid by all classes of the population from the King downward, either in grain
or in its equivalent in money. The “tithe” of Nabonidos, immediately after his accession, to
the temple of the Sun-god at Sippara was as much as 5 manehs of gold, or £840. We may infer
from this that it was paid on the amount of cash which he had found in the treasury of the
palace and which was regarded as the private property of the King. Nine years later Belshazzar,
the heir-apparent, offered two oxen and thirty-two sheep as a voluntary gift to the same temple,
and at the beginning of the following year we find him paying a shekel and a quarter for a
boat to convey three oxen and twenty-four sheep to the same sanctuary. Even at the moment when
Cyrus was successfully invading the dominions of his father and Babylon had already been occupied
for three weeks by the Persian army, Belshazzar was careful to pay the tithe due from his sister,
and amounting to 47 shekels of silver, into the treasury of the Sun-god. As Sippara was in
the hands of the enemy, and the Babylonian forces which Belshazzar commanded had been defeated
and dispersed, the fact is very significant, and proves how thoroughly both invaders and invaded
must have recognized the rights of the priesthood.

Tithe was also indirectly paid by the temple-serfs. Thus in the first year of Nergal-sharezer,
out of 3,100 measures of grain, delivered by “the serfs of the Sun-god” to his temple at Sippara,
250 were exacted as “tithe.” These serfs must be distinguished from the temple-slaves. They
were attached to the soil, and could not be separated from it. When, therefore, a piece of
land came into the possession of a temple by gift and endowment, they went along with it, but
their actual persons could not be sold. The slave, on the other hand, was as much a chattel
as the furniture of the temple, which could be bought and sold; he was usually a captive taken
in war, more rarely a native who had been sold for debt. All the menial work of the temple
was performed by him; the cultivation of the temple-lands, on the contrary, was left to the serfs.

It is doubtful whether the “butchers,” or slaughterers of the animals required for sacrifice,
or the “bakers” of the sacred cakes, were slaves or freemen. The expression used in regard
to them in the contract of Izkur-Merodach quoted above is open to two interpretations, but
it would naturally signify that they were regarded as slaves. We know, at all events, that
many of the artisans employed in weaving curtains for the temples and clothing for the images
of the gods belonged to the servile class, and the gorgeousness of the clothing and the frequency
with which it was changed must have necessitated a large number of workmen. Many of the documents
which have been bequeathed to us by the archives of the temple of the Sun-god at Sippara relate
to the robes and head-dresses and other portions of the clothing of the images which stood there.

A considerable part of the property of a temple was in land. Sometimes this was managed by
the priests themselves; sometimes its revenues were farmed, usually by a member of the priestly
corporation; at other times it was let to wealthy “tenants.” One of these, Nebo-sum-yukin by
name, who was an official in the temple of Nebo at Borsippa, married his daughter Gigîtum to
Nergal-sharezer in the first year of the latter’s reign.

The state religion of Assyria was a copy of that of Babylonia, with one important exception.
The supreme god was the deified state. Assur was not a Baal any more than Yahveh was in Israel
or Chemosh in Moab.

He was, consequently, no father of a family, with a wife and a son; he stood alone in jealous
isolation, wifeless and childless. It is true that some learned scribe, steeped in Babylonian
learning, now and then tried to find a Babylonian goddess with whom to mate him; but the attempt
was merely a piece of theological pedantry which made no impression on the rulers and people
of Nineveh. Assur was supreme over all other gods, as his representative, the Assyrian King,
was supreme over the other kings of the earth, and he would brook no rival at his side. The
tolerance of Babylonian religion was unknown in Assyria. It was “through trust in Assur” that
the Assyrian armies went forth to conquer, and through his help that they gained their victories.
The enemies of Assyria were his enemies, and it was to combat and overcome them that the Assyrian
monarchs declare that they marched to war. Cyrus tells us that Bel-Merodach was wrathful because
the images of other deities had been removed by Nabonidos from their ancient shrines in order
to be gathered together in his temple of Ê-Saggil at Babylon, but Assur bade his servants go
forth to subdue the gods of other lands, and to compel their worshippers to transfer their
allegiance to the god of Assyria. Those who believed not in him were his enemies, to be extirpated
or punished.

It is true that the leading Babylonian divinities were acknowledged in Assyria by the side
of Assur. But they were subordinate to him, and it is difficult to resist the impression that
their recognition was mainly confined to the literary classes. Apart from the worship of Istar
and the use of the names of certain gods in time-honored formulæ, it is doubtful whether even
a knowledge of the Babylonian deities went much beyond the educated members of the Assyrian
community. Nebo and Merodach and Anu were the gods of literature rather than of the popular cult.

But even in Babylonia the majority of the gods of the state religion was probably but little
remembered by the mass of the people. Doubtless the local divinity was well known to the inhabitants
of the place over which he presided and where his temple had stood from immemorial times. Every
native of Ur was doubtless a devoted adorer of Sin, the Moon-god, and for the inhabitants of
Babylon Bel-Merodach was the highest object of worship. But the real religion of the bulk of
the population consisted in charms and magic. The Babylonian was intensely superstitious, the
cultivated classes as much so as the lowest. Sorcery and divination were not only tolerated
by the priests, they formed part of the religious system of the state. Prophets and diviners
and interpreters of dreams served in the temples, and one of the sacred books of the priesthood
was a collection of incantations and magical rites. Among the people generally the old Shamanistic
faith had never been eradicated; it was but partially overlaid with the religious conceptions
of the Semite, and sorcery and witchcraft flourished down to the latest days of Babylonian history.

The gods and goddesses were believed to utter oracles and predictions through the lips of inspired
men and women. Figures of winged bulls and serpents were placed at the entrance of a building
to prevent the demons of evil from passing through it. Before the gates of Babylon Nebuchadnezzar
“set up mighty bulls of bronze and serpents which stood erect,” and when Nabonidos restored
the temple of the Moon-god at Harran two images of the primeval god, Lakhum, were similarly
erected on either side of its eastern gate to “drive back” his “foes.” These protecting genii
were known as sêdi and kurubi, the shédim and cherubim of the Old Testament. Sédi, however,
was a generic term, including evil as well as beneficent genii, and the latter was more properly
classed as the lamassi, or “colossal forms.” The whole world was imagined to be filled with
malevolent spirits ever on the watch to attack and torment mankind. The water that was drunk,
the food that was eaten, might contain a demon, whom it would be necessary to exorcise. The
diseases that afflict our bodies, the maladies that prey upon our spirits, were all due to
the spirits of evil, and could be removed only by the proper incantations and charms. Madness
and epilepsy were more especially the direct effect of demoniac possession. The magician alone
knew how to cure them; and the priest taught that his knowledge had first been communicated
to him by the god Ea through his interpreter, Merodach. Books were written containing the needful
formulæ and ritual for counteracting the malevolence of the evil spirits and for healing the
sick. Pure or “holy” water and the number seven were regarded as endowed with mysterious power
in the performance of these magical rites; thus magical threads were ordered to be bound seven
times round the limbs of the sick man, with phylacteries attached to them on which were inscribed
“sentences from a holy book.”

It was at night-time that the spirits of evil were more especially active. It was then that
vampires escaped from the bodies of the dead or from the realm of Hades to suck the blood of
the living, and that the nightmare lay upon the breast of its victim and sought to strangle
him. At the head of these demons of the night was Lilat, the wife of Lil, “the ghost;” from
the Babylonians she was borrowed by the Jews, and appears in the book of Isaiah under the name
of Lilith.

The demons were served by a priesthood of their own. These were the wizards and witches, and
the sorcerers and sorceresses, with whom were associated the public prostitutes, who plied
their calling under the shadow of night.

It was then that they lay in ambush for the unwary passenger, for whom they mixed deadly philters
which poisoned the blood. They were devotees of Istar, but the Istar they worshipped was a
wholly different goddess from the Istar of the official cult. She was a goddess of witchcraft
and darkness, of whom it was said that she “seized” on her victim “at night,” and was “the
slayer of youths.” She it was who was dreaded by the people like the witches and “street-walkers,”
who ministered before her, and against whom exorcisms of all kinds were employed. To guard
against her and her agents, small images of Lugal-gira and Allamu, the teraphim of the Babylonians,
were made and placed to the right and the left of the door that they might “tear out the hearts
of the wicked” and “slay the witch.” The Fire-god, moreover, was invoked that he might destroy
the ministers of wickedness, and figures of the witch or wizard were moulded in wax and melted
in the fire. As the wax dissolved, so, it was prayed, might “the wizard and witch run, melt,
and dissolve.”

The exorcisms had to be repeated by the victims of witchcraft. This is clear from the words
which come at the end of each of them: “I, So-and-so, the son of So-and-so, whose god is So-and-so
and goddess So-and-so, I turn to thee, I seek for thee, I kiss thy hands, I bow myself under
thee. Consume the wizard and the witch; annihilate the lives of the sorcerer and the sorceress
who have bewitched me. Then shall I live and gladden thy heart.”

In strange contrast to these utterances of popular superstition are the hymns and prayers that
were addressed by the cultivated Babylonian to the gods of the official creed. They were gods
of light and healing, who punished, indeed, the sins of the wicked, but were ready to listen
to the petitions of the penitent and to forgive them their transgressions. Bel-Merodach was
“the merciful one who raises the dead to life,” and Ea was ever on the watch to send aid to
suffering humanity and foil the demons who warred against man. Here, for example, are some
extracts from one of those penitential psalms whose authors seem to have sprung from Eridu
and which formed part of the Babylonian Bible long before the age of Abraham:

The heart of my lord is wroth; may it be appeased! May the god whom I know not be appeased!
May the goddess whom I know not be appeased! May both the god I know and the god I know not
be appeased!… O lord, my sins are many, my transgressions are great!… The sin that I sinned
I knew not, The transgression I committed I knew not.… The lord in the wrath of his heart has
regarded me, God in the fierceness of his heart has revealed himself to me.… I sought for help,
and none took my hand; I wept, and none stood at my side; I cried aloud, and there was none
that heard me. I am in trouble and hiding; I dare not look up. To my god, the merciful one,
I turn myself, I utter my prayer; The feet of my goddess I kiss and water with tears.… The
sins I have sinned turn into a blessing; The transgressions I have committed let the wind carry
away! Strip off my manifold wickednesses as a garment! O my god, seven times seven are my transgressions;
forgive my sins! O my goddess, seven times seven are my transgressions; forgive my sins!

To the same early period belongs a hymn to the Moon-god, originally composed for the services
in the temple of Ur, the birthplace of Abraham, and afterward incorporated in the sacred books
of the state religion. It is thus that the poet speaks of his god:

Father, long-suffering and full of forgiveness, whose hand upholdeth the
            life of all mankind!…
First-born, omnipotent, whose heart is immensity, and there is none who
            may fathom it!…
In heaven who is supreme? Thou alone, thou art supreme!
On earth, who is supreme? Thou alone, thou art supreme!
As for thee, thy will is made known in heaven, and the angels bow their
            faces.
As for thee, thy will is made known upon earth, and the spirits below kiss
            the ground.

At times the language of the hymn rises to that of monotheism of a pure and exalted character.
That a monotheistic school actually existed in one of the literary circles of Babylonia was
long ago pointed out by Sir Henry Rawlinson. It arose at Erech, an early seat of Semitic influence,
and endeavored to resolve the manifold deities of Chaldea into forms or manifestations of the
“one god,” Anu. It never made many converts, it is true; but the tendency toward monotheism
continued among the educated part of the population, and when Babylon became the capital of
the country its god, Merodach, became not only a Bel or “Lord,” but the one supreme lord over
all the other gods. Though the existence of the other gods was admitted, they fell, as it were,
into a background of shadow, and the worshipper of Merodach, in his devotion to the god, almost
forgot that they existed at all. The prayers of Nebuchadnezzar are a proof how narrow was the
line which divided his faith from that of the monotheist. “To Merodach my lord,” he says, “I
prayed; I began to him my petition; the word of my heart sought him, and I said: O prince,
thou that art from everlasting, lord of all that exists, for the king whom thou lovest, whom
thou callest by name, as it seems good unto thee, thou guidest his name aright, thou watchest
over him in the path of righteousness! I, the prince who obeys thee, am the work of thy hands;
thou hast created me and hast entrusted to me the sovereignty over multitudes of men, according
to thy goodness, O lord, which thou hast made to pass over them all. Let me love thy supreme
lordship, let the fear of thy divinity exist in my heart, and give what seemeth good unto thee,
since thou maintainest my life.”

The man who could thus pray was not far from the kingdom of God.

APPENDIX: WEIGHTS AND MEASURES

In the preceding pages the equivalence of the qa in modern English measures has been given
in accordance with the calculations of Dr. Oppert. Other scholars, however, would assign to
it a different value, identifying it with the Hebrew qab and making it equal to about two litres.
This, indeed, seems to have been its value in the age of Abraham, but in the later days of
Babylonian history a different system certainly prevailed.

WEIGHTS.

360 se ("grains")   1 shekel 60 shekels          1 maneh (mana) 60 manehs           1 talent

The silver maneh was equivalent to £9, the shekel being 3s., while the gold maneh was ten times
its value. The maneh was originally a weight more than one kind of which was in use: (1) The
heavy maneh of 990 grammes; (2) the light maneh of 495 grammes; (3) the gold maneh (for weighing
gold) of 410 grammes; and (4) the silver maneh of 546 grammes. At Sippara, however, the heavy
maneh weighed 787 grammes; the light maneh, 482 grammes; and the gold maneh, 392 grammes; while
the standard maneh fixed by Dungi weighed 980 grammes. The maneh of Carchemis contained 561
grammes.

MEASURES OF CAPACITY.

1 qa (Heb. qab)     1.66 litres 1 pi or ardeb (Heb.   36 qas homer) 1 bar (Heb. se’ah)    60
qas 1 homer in Assyria      60 qas 1 gur (Heb. kor)      180 qas

In the Abrahamic age other systems were in use in Babylonia according to which the gur sometimes
contained 360 qas and sometimes 300 qas.

The tonnage of ships was reckoned by the gur.

MEASURES OF LENGTH.

1 uban or               16.6 millimetres
finger-breadth (divided
into 180 parts)
30 finger-breadths        1 ammat or cubit (498
                          mm.)
2 cubits                  1 great cubit (996 mm.)
6 great cubits            1 qanu or reed
2 reeds                   1 gar
60 gars                 1 soss or stade
30 sosses               1 kasbu or parasang (21
                          kilometres)
2 kasbus                1 great kasbu

SUPERFICIAL MEASURES.

In the Abrahamic age 180 se were probably equivalent to 1 gin, 60 gin to one sar or “garden,”
1,800 sar to 1 feddân (padânu) or “acre.” The latter was called bur-gan in Sumerian, or “10
acres,” to distinguish it from a smaller acre, which contained only 180 sar.

Time was reckoned by the kasbu or “double hour,” and in early times the weight was divided
into three watches of 2 kasbus or 4 hours each. The months were originally lunar, and consisted
of 30 days, an intercalary month being inserted in the calendar every six years. The zodiac
was divided into 360 degrees.

Mathematics were based upon a sexagesimal system, sixty, called the soss, being the unit. The
ner was equivalent to 10 sosses and the sar to 6 ners.

FOOTNOTES

    1 Researches in Assyria, Babylonia, and Chaldea (1838), p. 131 sqq.

    2 In certain cases the wife seems to have had the power of claiming
      alimony from her husband, though we do not know what were the
      circumstances which were held sufficient to justify the claim. Thus,
      in the third year of Nabonidos, “Nahid-Merodach, the son of
      Samas-baladhu-iqbi, voluntarily granted his wife Ramûa and his son
      Arad-Bunene four qas of food and three qas of beer daily, as
      well as fifteen manehs of wool, one pi of sesame, one pi of
      salt, and sixty qas of sweetmeats each year,” with the provision
      that the grant should never be cancelled or willed away. The son,
      however, is included in the gift, and it is possible, therefore,
      that Ramûa was little more than a concubine.

    3 A similar case, in which, however, it is a testatrix who hands over
      her property to her son during her lifetime, is recorded in a deed
      dated at Babylon the 10th day of Sivân, in the second year of
      Nabonidos. The deed is as follows: “Gugûa, the daughter of Zakir,
      the son of a native of Isin, has voluntarily sealed and delivered to
      her eldest son, Ea-zir-ibni, her dowry, consisting of one maneh
      which is in the keeping of Nebo-akhi-iddin, the son of Sula, the son
      of Egibi; 35 shekels which have been mortgaged to Tabnea, the son of
      Nebo-yusallim, the son of Sin-sadunu, and 20 shekels which are due
      from Tasmetum-ramat, the daughter of Arad-Bel, the son of Egibi, as
      well as a field producing 48 qas of seed on the canal of Kish. As
      regards the maneh and 56 shekels belonging to Gugûa, which, in the
      absence of her eldest son, Ea-zir-ibni, she has divided between her
      younger sons, Nebo-akhi-bullidh, Nergal-ina-esi-edher,
      Itti-Samas-baladhu, and Ninip-pir-utsur, Ea-zir-ibni shall have no
      claim to them. Gugûa has delivered to Ea-zir-ibni, her eldest son,
      one maneh, now in the hands of Nebo-akhi-iddin, 55 shekels in the
      hands of Tabnea, 50 shekels in the hands of Tasmetum-ramat, and a
      field bearing 48 qas of seed. As long as Gugûa lives, Ea-zir-ibni
      shall give his mother Gugûa, as interest upon the property, food and
      clothing. Gugûa shall alienate none of it out of affection or will
      it away. Ea-zir-ibni shall not be disturbed in his possession.” The
      names of three witnesses are attached to the deed, which was “sealed
      in the presence of Babâ, the daughter of Nebo-zir-lisir, the son of
      Egibi.”

    4 Journal of the American Oriental Society, xviii., p. 167.

    5 We hear, however, of a “little girl of six years of age” being sold
      for 17 shekels in the thirteenth year of Nabonidos, but she was
      doubtless an orphan.

    6 Xxiii. 14.

    7 See above, p. 23 f.

    8 Schliemann, Ilios, pp. 471, 472. Mr. Head shows that the maneh in
      question is identical with the Babylonian silver maneh of 8,656
      grains troy, or 561 grammes, though the latter is now more usually
      fixed at 546 grammes.

    9 In the Assyrian texts the term for “prison” is bit kili, of which
      kisukku is also given as a synonym.

   10 Our learned author has been misled in this paragraph by the utterly
      erroneous copy and translation of Father Scheil. The letter reads
      “To Sin-iddinnam from Hammurabi. The goddesses of Emutbalim which
      are assigned to thee, the troops under the command of Tnuhsamar will
      bring to thee in safety. When they reach thee, with the troops which
      thou hast destroy the people, and the goddesses to their dwellings
      let them bring in safety.”—CR.
