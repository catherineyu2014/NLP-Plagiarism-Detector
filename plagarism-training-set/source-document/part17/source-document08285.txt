It will not, I am sure, be thought that, in making my boast as to the quantity, I have endeavoured
to lay claim to any literary excellence. That, in the writing of books, quantity without quality
is a vice and a misfortune, has been too manifestly settled to leave a doubt on such a matter.
But I do lay claim to whatever merit should be accorded to me for persevering diligence in
my profession. And I make the claim, not with a view to my own glory, but for the benefit of
those who may read these pages, and when young may intend to follow the same career.  Nulla
dies sine linea. Let that be their motto. And let their work be to them as is his common work
to the common labourer. No gigantic efforts will then be necessary. He need tie no wet towels
round his brow, nor sit for thirty hours at his desk without moving,--as men have sat, or said
that they have sat.  More than nine-tenths of my literary work has been done in the last twenty
years, and during twelve of those years I followed another profession. I have never been a
slave to this work, giving due time, if not more than due time, to the amusements I have loved.
But I have been constant,--and constancy in labour will conquer all difficulties. Gutta cavat
lapidem non vi, sed saepe cadendo.

It may interest some if I state that during the last twenty years I have made by literature
something near (pounds)70,000. As I have said before in these pages, I look upon the result
as comfortable, but not splendid.
