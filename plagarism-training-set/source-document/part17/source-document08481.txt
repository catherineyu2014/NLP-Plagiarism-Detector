OUR EIGHTH VOLUME. We avail ourselves of the opportunity afforded by the commencement of a
new Volume, to state that our attention has been called to the sharp and somewhat personal
tone of several of the recent contributions to "N. & Q.," and which, we are reminded, is the
more striking from the marked absence of anything of that character in our earlier Volumes.
We are perhaps ourselves somewhat to blame for this, from our strong indisposition to exercise
our editorial privilege of omission. Our notice of the subject will, we are sure, be sufficient
to satisfy our contributors of the inconvenience which must result to themselves as well as
to us from the indulgence in too great license of the pen. We know that when men write currente
calamo, words and phrases are apt to escape, the full application of which is not observed,
until, as Charles Lamb said, "print proves it;" but being conscious that, when treating on
the subjects with which we deal, no one would willingly write anything with design to give
offence, we shall in future "play the tyrant" on all such occasions with more vigilance than
we have done.

L. K. The lines--

 "Worth makes the man, the want of it the fellow;
  The rest is all but leather and prunello."

are from Pope's Essay on Man, Ep. IV. 203. See some curious illustrations of them in our First
Volume, pp. 246. 362. &c.

BLACKAMOOR will find the Cyanogen Soap, manufactured by Thomas, excellent for removing Photographic
stains. It is, however, to be used with care, being poisonous.

ALBERT. The history of the phrase--

 "Quem Deus vult perdere,"

will be seen in our First Volume, pp. 347. 351. 421. 476.; and Second Volume, p. 317.

I. G. T. Gooseberry Fool is the same as pressed or crushed gooseberries, from the French fouler,
to press, tread, &c.

THE NEW AND IMPROVED EDITION OF

BURKE'S PEERAGE AND BARONETAGE FOR 1853

IS NOW READY,

    In 1 vol. royal 8vo., comprising as much matter as twenty ordinary
    volumes, with 1,500 accurate Engravings of Arms. Price 38s. bound.

This new and thoroughly revised edition has engaged the author's closest attention for a considerable
time. Every line of its voluminous contents has been tested by the most minute research, and
every page has been submitted to the members of the various noble and eminent families themselves.
Much additional information of the deepest interest has thus been obtained. The collateral
branches, too, have been fully investigated and inserted. In addition, great improvements have
been made in the Heraldic Illustrations, and arrangement of the printing, &c.

Also just published,

BURKE'S LANDED GENTRY, CORRECTED FOR 1853,

    In 2 large vols., including the Supplement, printed in double columns
    (equal in quantity to thirty ordinary volumes). Price 2l. 2s. bound,
    with a separate Index, gratis, of all the names (upwards of 100,000)
    mentioned in the Work.

The great expense attending the production of this important and truly national Work will preclude
its being again printed in so extended and comprehensive a form, and the present opportunity
will consequently be the only one afforded for obtaining it.

EVELYN'S DIARY AND CORRESPONDENCE.

    New Edition, with numerous Additions and Original Letters, now first
    published, and a copious Index. Complete in 4 volumes, 10s. 6d. each.

"This very excellent edition of Evelyn's famous 'Diary' furnishes us with much interesting
correspondence never before published. These volumes will be treasures to those who delight
in genuine curiosities of literature, while to the student of history they will be invaluable.

HORACE WALPOLE'S MEMOIRS.

Edited by ELIOT WARBURTON. Cheaper Edition, 2 vols. 8vo. with Portraits, 16s.

"The Memoirs of Horace Walpole nearly complete the chain of personal, political, and literary
history, commencing with Evelyn and Pepys, and ending almost in our own day with the histories
of Mr. Macaulay and Lord Mahon. The work is a necessary addition to the library of every English
gentleman."--Standard.
