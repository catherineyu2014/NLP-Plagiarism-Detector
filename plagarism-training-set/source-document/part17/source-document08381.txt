Run No. 144 was intended as a duplicate of run No. 143. Stock from cooks Nos. 317 and 318 was
given a medium brush and washing for one hour and a further medium brush of one hour, bleached
with 11.4 per cent of bleach, and made into a furnish composed of 15.5 per cent of sulphite,
23.5 per cent of soda poplar, and 61 per cent of hurd stock, loaded with 21.4 per cent of clay,
sized with 1.17 per cent of resin size, hard brushed for one hour, tinted by the expert colorer
of the company, and pumped to the stock chest. Stock from cooks Nos. 319 and 320 was treated
in exactly the same manner except that the stock was bleached with 12.1 per cent of bleach
and pumped to the stock chest to mix with the former furnish. The stock acted very well on
the machine, which was speeded to 75 feet per minute, with the Jordan refiner set at a medium
brush. The sheet is as good, if not better, than that of run No. 143, and it is also a good
illustration of the extent to which proper tinting will enhance the general appearance of a
paper. The poor appearance of the samples of previous runs is due largely to lack of proper
tinting. Various degrees of whiteness, however, are demanded by the trade.

=COMPARISON OF THE TESTS AND COMMERCIAL PRACTICE.=

In work of this nature and on this scale it is practically impossible to arrive at a cost figure
which would be susceptible of commercial interpretation, and in this preliminary publication
nothing will be attempted beyond a comparison of the process used with the hurds with that
process commercially applied to poplar wood. The process last used with the hurds should not
be regarded as final, satisfactory, or most suitable, as it has been shown that progress was
being made up to the conclusion of the work.

In comparing the method of using hurds with the method of handling poplar wood, a difference
is apparent on the delivery of raw material at the mill. Ordinarily, poplar is received at
the mill in the form of logs about 4 feet in length, which may be stored in piles in the open.
Hurds very likely would be received baled, and it would seem advisable to store them under
cover for the following reasons: (a) Baled hurds would probably absorb and retain more water
during wet weather than logs of wood, thereby causing excessive dilution of the caustic liquor;
(b) prolonged excessive dampness might create heating and deterioration unless the hemp were
properly retted; (c) wet hurds could not be sieved free from sand and chaff. Should further
work show that the first two reasons need not be taken into consideration, the third objection
might be overcome by sieving the hurds before baling. Even then, it is probable that baled
hurds stored in the open would accumulate and retain considerable dirt from factory chimneys,
locomotives, and wind. Checked pulp wood exposed in the open invariably suffers from these causes.

In the preparation of the raw material for the digesters there is likewise considerable difference
between hurds and poplar wood. The former apparently requires only a moderate sieving to remove
sand and chaff, which operation doubtless would require only a small amount of labor and the
installation of some simple machinery of low power consumption. In preparing poplar for digestion,
the 4-foot logs are chipped by a heavy, comparatively expensive chipper of high power consumption,
after which the chips are sorted by sieving, the large pieces being rechipped. There would
be a noteworthy difference in the installation, operating, and depreciation costs of the two
equipments, and this difference would counterbalance to a considerable extent the difference
in cost of raw material storage.

It is possible that in the use of the chip loft more care would have to be exercised in using
hurds because of the tendency of the bast fiber to cause lodgments, but this should not be
considered a serious difficulty.

The weight of hurds which are capable of being charged into a rotary is a decidedly unfavorable
factor. The weight of a cubic foot of hurds varies somewhat with the proportion of bast fiber,
but averages about 5.4 pounds, which, compared with a cubic foot of poplar chips at 8.93 pounds,
represents a digester charge of 60.5 per cent of the weight of a poplar-wood charge, or, in
terms of fiber capacity, the hurds charge would yield 38.6 per cent as much fiber as the wood
charge. The hurds upon being baled for transportation may be broken and crushed to such a degree
that the weight of the charge may be increased, and it might be found possible to increase
the charge weight by steaming or by the employment of tamping devices. This small weight of
charge constitutes one of the most serious objections to the use of hurds in paper manufacture.

In those tests in which the most satisfactory results were obtained, the cooking conditions
were 29.5 per cent of caustic soda at a concentration of 107 grams per liter and a causticity
of 84.0 per cent acting at a temperature of 170° C. for five hours, or a total time of seven
hours. The steam condensation in the rotary used for these tests was abnormally high, due to
the fact that the steam supply pipe was uncovered for a considerable distance and the rotary
was entirely uncovered. It is believed, therefore, that a larger amount of caustic was necessary
than would otherwise have been the case. This belief is strengthened by the quality of the
waste liquor from one of the later cooks, which gave on analysis 16.85 grams per liter of free
caustic soda and showed a causticity of 27.75 per cent. These data show that only 67.3 per
cent of the total caustic employed was actually consumed in the cooking operation, which percentage
is lower than obtains in practice. The stock from this cook was bleached with 11.5 per cent
of bleach. But even as the figures stand, the comparison with poplar cooking practice is as
follows: 29.5 per cent caustic soda used as against 22 to 25 per cent; 107 grams per liter
as against 100 to 110; 84 per cent causticity is little different than obtains in practice;
170° C. is about commercial practice; five hours at pressure as against four to six hours;
seven hours' total time as against possibly six to eight hours; 11.5 per cent bleach as against
8 to 10 per cent. Thus, it is evident that the cooking conditions employed were slightly more
severe and expensive than those in commercial use with poplar wood.

The yield of total fiber obtained from the hurds may be placed at 35 per cent of bone-dry fiber
calculated on the bone-dry weight of hurds used, or 33.1 per cent of air-dry fiber calculated
on air-dry hurds. The yield of bleached fiber was not determined in this preliminary work,
but may be safely estimated as 30 per cent, which is low when compared with a yield of about
47 per cent of bone-dry bleached fiber from bone-dry poplar wood. It is believed quite possible
that satisfactory cooking conditions may be found which will give a higher yield than was obtained
during these tests. The stock should be classed as easy bleaching, and 11.4 per cent of bleach
is a satisfactory figure, although a little high.

As to beating cost, in the last two and most satisfactory tests the total washing and beating
time was three hours, which may be about an hour more than ordinarily is used in making papers
of this grade, although the practice varies to a considerable extent.

In regard to furnish, there is such a diversity of practice that it is difficult to make a
comparison, but if the hurd stock can be produced as cheaply as soda-poplar stock, the furnish
used in these last two tests should be regarded as satisfactory to the book and printing paper
manufacturer.

The finish of the paper was not all that might be desired, but that was due almost entirely
to the calender stack available for the work, which was composed of nine light rolls, many
of which were about 6 inches in diameter and which had not been reground for some time. From
a small test on a large calender stack it was readily shown that the paper produced is capable
of taking a satisfactory finish.

This comparison, satisfactory in many respects, develops two factors which are decidedly unfavorable
to hemp hurds, namely, raw-material storage and digester capacity, and they must be taken into
full account in considering the paper-making value of this material, although it should be
recognized that investigation may result in the material improvement of these conditions. Moreover,
it is not at all improbable that further investigation would develop more satisfactory treating
conditions and more suitable furnish compositions, and the belief in this possibility is strengthened
by the fact that material progress was being made at the conclusion of this preliminary work.

Calculations on the raw material and acreage for a permanent supply for a pulp mill producing
25 tons of fiber a day for 300 days per annum, or 7,500 tons per annum, give the comparison
between hurds and wood shown in Table II.

-----------+-------------+--------------+-----------+---------+----------

The most important point derived from this calculation is in regard to areas required for a
sustained supply, which are in the ratio of 4 to 1. Every tract of 10,000 acres which is devoted
to hemp raising year by year is equivalent to a sustained pulp-producing capacity of 40,500
acres of average pulp-wood lands. In other words, in order to secure additional raw material
for the production of 25 tons of fiber per day there exists the possibility of utilizing the
agricultural waste already produced on 10,000 acres of hemp lands instead of securing, holding,
reforesting, and protecting 40,500 acres of pulp-wood land.

The annual growth per acre, although decidedly in favor of hurds, has little bearing on the
project, because the utilization of the hurds is subordinate to the raising of hemp, and the
paper manufacturer probably could afford to use only hurds resulting from the hemp industry.

=PHYSICAL TESTS OF THE PAPERS PRODUCED.=

Samples of paper produced in the seven tests were submitted to the Leather and Paper Laboratory
of the Bureau of Chemistry. The report of that bureau on its tests is given in Table III.

There is no system of numerically recording the general appearance and "look through" of a
paper, but it can be stated that only papers Nos. 143 and 144 are satisfactory in these respects,
the other samples being more or less thickly specked with shives. The general character and
tests of these papers correspond very closely with No. 1 machine-finish printing paper, according
to the specifications of the United States Government Printing Office, which call for a sheet
not exceeding 0.0035 inch in thickness, strength not less than 12 points, free from unbleached
or ground wood pulp, and ash not over 10 per cent. The strength factor of such papers is about
0.28. The ash should not be over 10 per cent for this grade of paper, but in spite of the larger
amount used the physical tests are sufficiently high. It is to be noted that the physical tests
of samples Nos. 138 to 142, inclusive, are higher than in Nos. 143 and 144, in which 23 per
cent of soda poplar was used, which shows clearly that hemp-hurd stock imparts strength and
folding endurance to a greater extent than does soda-poplar stock. From these preliminary tests
it would be concluded, therefore, that hemp-hurd stock acts similarly to soda-poplar stock,
but will produce a somewhat harsher and stronger sheet and one of higher folding endurance.
Undoubtedly, there is more dirt in the samples than would be tolerated by the trade, but this
was to be expected, since in this preliminary work the raw material was sieved by hand screens
instead of by automatic machines which would sieve more thoroughly.

=CONCLUSIONS.=
