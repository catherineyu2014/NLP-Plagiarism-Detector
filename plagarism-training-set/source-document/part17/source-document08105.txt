  | This volume is the handsomest and cheapest subscription book |
  | extant, and contains in itself more to give it enduring fame |
  |      and make it universally popular than any book ever      |
  |  published. It is something in it, of the best, for every  |
  |   one--for the old, the middle aged, and the young. It has   |
  |   intellectual food for every taste and for every mood and   |
  | phase of human feeling, from the merriest humor up, through  |
  |   all the gradations of feeling, to the most touching and    |
  |  tender pathos. Excepting the Bible, this will be the book   |
  |    most loved, and the most frequently referred to in the    |
  |                           family.                            |
  |                                                              |
  | The whole work, page by page, poem by poem, has passed under |
  |  the educated criticism and scholarly eye of WILLIAM CULLEN  |
  |    BRYANT, a man reverenced among men, a poet great among    |
  |                            poets.                            |
  |                                                              |
  | This is a Library of over 500 Volumes in one book, whose |
  |   contents, of no ephemeral nature or interest, will never   |
  | grow old or stale. It can be, and will be, read and re-read  |
  | with pleasure as long as its leaves hold together. Over 800  |
  | pages beautifully printed, choicely illustrated, handsomely  |
  |      bound. Sold only through Agents, by subscription.       |
  |                                                              |
  | Teachers, Clergymen, active Men, intelligent Women, can all  |
  | secure good pay with light work by taking an agency for this |
  |                  book. Terms very liberal.
