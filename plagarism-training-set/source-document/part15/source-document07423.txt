She took to her second husband John Poliander Kirkhoven, Lord of Kirkhoven and Henfleet, by
whom she had a son, Charles Henry Kirkhoven, the subject of the Query.

This gentleman, chiefly on account of his mother's descent, was created a baron of this realm
by the title of Lord Wotton of Wotton in Kent, by letters patent bearing date at St. Johnstone's
(Perth) in Scotland, August 31, 1650, and in September, 1660, was naturalised by authority
of parliament, together with his sisters. He was likewise in 1677 created Earl of Bellomont
in Ireland, and, dying without issue, left his estates to his nephew Charles Stanhope, the
younger son of his half-brother the Earl of Chesterfield, who took the surname of Wotton.

This information is principally from Collins, who quotes "Ec. Stem. per Vincent." I have consulted
also Bank's Dormant Baronage, Burke's Works, and Sharpe's Peerage.

Anna Lightfoot (Vol. vii., p. 595.).--An account of "the left-handed wife of George III." appeared
in Sir Richard Phillips' Monthly Magazine for 1821 or 1822, under the title of (I think) "Hannah
Lightfoot, the fair Quaker."

ALEXANDER ANDREWS.

Lawyers' Bags (Vol. viii., p. 59.).--Previous correspondents appear to have established the
fact that green was the orthodox colour of a lawyer's bag up to a recent date. May not the
change of colour have been suggested by the sarcasms and jeers about "green bags," which were
very current during the proceedings on the Bill of Pains and Penalties, commonly known as the
Trial of Queen Caroline, some thirty years ago? The reports of the evidence collected by the
commission on the Continent, was laid on the table in a sealed green bag, and the very name
became for a time the signal for such an outcry, that the lawyers may have deemed it prudent
to strike their colours, and have recourse to some other less obnoxious to remark.

BALLIOLENSIS.

"When Orpheus went down" (Vol. viii., p. 196.).--In reply to the Query of G. M. B. respecting
"When Orpheus went down," I beg to say that the author was the Rev. Dr. Lisle (most probably
the Bishop of St. Asaph). The song may be found among Ritson's English Songs. When it was first
published I have not been able to ascertain, but it must have been in the early part of the
last century, as the air composed for it by Dr. Boyce, most likely for Vauxhall, was afterwards
used in the pasticcio opera of Love in a Village, which was brought out in 1763.

Wardhouse, and Fisherman's Custom there (Vol. viii., p. 78.).--Wardhouse or Wardhuuse, is a
port in Finland, and the custom was for the English to purchase herrings there, as they were
not permitted to fish on that coast. In Trade's Increase, a commercial tract, written in the
earlier part of the seventeenth century, the author, when speaking of restraints on fishing
on the coasts of other nations, says:

    "Certain merchants of Hull had their ships taken away and themselves
    imprisoned, for fishing about the Wardhouse at the North Cape."

"In necessariis unitas," &c. (Vol. viii., p. 197.).--The sentence, "In necessariis unitas,
in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas," may be seen sculptured in stone over the head of a
doorway leading into the garden of a house which was formerly the residence of Archdeacon Coxe,
and subsequently of Canon Lisle Bowles, in the Close at Salisbury. It is quoted from Melancthon.
The inscription was placed there by the poet, and is no less the record of a noble, true, and
generous sentiment, than of the discriminating taste and feeling of him by whom it was thus
appreciated and honoured. {282} Would that it might become the motto of all our cathedral precincts!

NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.

The Botany of the Eastern Borders, with the Popular Names and Uses of the Plants, and of the
Customs and Beliefs which have been associated with them, by George Johnson, M.D. This, the
first volume of The Natural History of the Eastern Borders, is a book calculated to please
a very large body of readers. The botanist will like it for the able manner in which the various
plants indigenous to the district are described. The lover of Old World associations will be
delighted with the industry with which Dr. Johnson has collected, and the care with which he
has recorded their popular names, and preserved the various bits of folk lore associated with
those popular names, or their supposed medicinal virtues. The antiquary will be gratified by
the bits of archæological gossip, and the biographical sketches so pleasantly introduced; and
the general reader with the kindly spirit with which Dr. Johnson will enlist him in his company--

 "    .    .    .   Unconstrain'd to rove along
  The bushy brakes and glens among."

Marry, it were a pleasant thing to join the Berwickshire Natural History Club in one of their
rambles through the Eastern Borders.

Mr. Bohn has just added to his Antiquarian Library a volume which will be received with great
satisfaction by all who take an interest in the antiquity of Egypt. It is a translation by
the Misses Horner of Dr. Lepsius' Letters from Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Peninsula of Sinai,
with Extracts from his Chronology of the Egyptians, with reference to the Exodus of the Israelites,
revised by the Author. Dr. Lepsius, it may be mentioned, was at the head of the scientific
expedition appointed by the King of Prussia to investigate the remains of ancient Egyptian
and Ethiopian civilisation, still in preservation in the Nile valley and the adjacent countries;
and in this cheap volume we have that accomplished traveller's own account of what that expedition
was able to accomplish.

We are at length enabled to answer the Query which was addressed to us some time since on the
subject of the continuation of Mr. MacCabe's Catholic History of England. The third volume
is now at press, and will be issued in the course of the next publishing season. We think the
editor would have some difficulty in authenticating many of the epitaphs in his collection,
which seems to have been formed upon no settled principle.--The Physiology of Temperance and
Total Abstinence, being an Examination of the Effects of the Excessive, Moderate, and Occasional
Use of Alcoholic Liquors on the Healthy Human System, by Dr. Carpenter: a shilling pamphlet,
temperately written and closely argued, and well deserving the attention of all, even of the
most temperate.
