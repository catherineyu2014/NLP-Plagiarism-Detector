me yesterday, 'This will all go on well as long as the First Consul lives; the day after his
death we shall all emigrate.' "--"Every one, from the sailor to the worker, says to himself,
'All this is very well, but will it last?...--This work we undertake, this capital we risk,

[Footnote 3192: Napoleon, "Correspondance," letter of September 5, 1795. There are two sorts
of national property, one of first origin (that of the clergy), and the other of second origin
(that of the émigrés). The latter is much more depreciated than the former. Compared with patrimonial
property, in Aisne, the former loses a fifth or a quarter of its value and the latter a third;
in Loiret, the former loses a quarter and the latter one-half; in Seine-et-Oise the former
loses one-third and the latter three-fifths; in Oise the former is at about par, the latter
loses a quarter.--Roederer, III., 472 (December 1803). Depreciation of national property in
Normandy: "But little is bought above 7 %. off; this, however, is the fate of this sort of
property throughout France."--Ibid., III., 534 (January 1809): "In Normandy, investments on
patrimonial property bring only 3 %., while State property brings 5 %. "--Moniteur (January
4, 1825). Report of M. de Martignac: "The confiscated property of the emigrés finds its purchasers
with difficulty, and its commercial value is not in proportion to its real value."--Duclosonge,
former inspector of domains, "Moyens de porter les domaines nationaux à la valeur des biens
patrimoniaux," p.7. "Since 1815, national property has generally been bought at a rate of income
of 3 %. or, at the most, 4 %. The difference for this epoch is accordingly one-fifth, and even
two-fifths."]

this period I have lost at least one hundred and fifty. The survivors threaten me with a more
rapid gap; either they are infirm, bent with the weight of years, or wearied or overworked.
It is therefore urgent that I be authorized to confer sacred orders on those who are old enough
and have the necessary instruction. Meanwhile, you are limited to asking authorization for
the first eight on the aforesaid list, of whom the youngest is twenty-four.... I beg Your Excellency
to present the others on this list for the authorization of His Imperial Majesty."--Ibid.,

scholarships should be retained for them on their return; hence the military spirit of the
"Prytanée."--By virtue of a decree, March 5, 1806, a perpetual income of 400,000 francs was
transferred to the Prytanée de Saint-Cyr. It is this income which, by the decree of March 24,
1808, becomes the endowment of the imperial University. Henceforth, the expenses of the Prytanée
de Saint-Cyr are assigned to the war department.]
