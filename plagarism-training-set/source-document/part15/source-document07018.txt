The aggregate of all these causes was sufficient to bring about a supply for the southern market.
The question now arises as to how the demand was met commercially. To what extent were there
slave traders in Kentucky? George Prentice, the famous editor of the Louisville Journal, himself
a loyal exponent of slavery, early pointed out that Kentucky had an ample supply of Negroes
and that they were being sent south in large numbers. He further stated that any one who wanted
slaves could always purchase them by leaving an order in Louisville.[262] This opinion was
expressed at a time when the non-importation act of 1833 had been in force for sixteen years,
which meant that Kentucky was producing slaves faster than she needed them. It was only two
months after this that Richard Henry Collins in an editorial in the Maysville Eagle gave a
flagrant example of a slave trader in Kentucky who violated the spirit as well as the letter
of the law. But the sentiment of the people on the slave dealer had been expressed much earlier.
In 1833 a Lexington editor felt exasperated because of the appearance of a large group of slaves
in the streets of the city on their way to be sold south. The news spread around the town rapidly
and to save himself from the threats of the gathering mob the owner was compelled for his own
safety to follow the slave dealer and repurchase the woman at a decided increase in price.[264]

It is very difficult to find out how many slave dealers there were in the State, for few of
them ever came out in the open and advertised their trade. As would be expected from its size
and situation Louisville was the place where the dealer could ply his trade to the best advantage.
It was the central business point and the port from which most slaves from Kentucky were shipped
down the Ohio and Mississippi. There is no mention in the newspapers of any dealers there before
the year 1845. Thereafter there were several who advertised for any number of slaves and made
no secret of the purpose of purchase. In the Journal for October 29, 1845, William Kelly called
for all persons who had slaves to sell to see him and offered them the highest prices. He further
stated that he had slaves for sale. His name does not often appear in succeeding years. During
the next decade there were four regular dealers who apparently did considerable business: T.
Arterburn, J. Arterburn, William F. Talbott, and Thomas Powell. Later John Mattingly came upon
the scene presumably from St. Louis. In July, 1845, the Arterburn brothers began a series of
advertisements which ran for several years. "We wish to purchase 100 negroes for the Southern
market, for which we will pay the highest prices in cash."[265] Talbott began his publicity
in 1848 with these words: "The subscriber wishes to purchase 100 negroes, for which he will
pay the highest cash prices. Can always be found at the Louisville Hotel."[266] Two years later
he was still advertising, but had ceased placing any limit on the number to be bought and had
moved his quarters to the Hotel O'Rain.[267] Thomas Powell also began in 1848 with this stock
phraseology--"Persons having negroes for sale can find a purchaser at the highest cash prices
by calling on the subscriber, on Sixth Street, between Main and Market, adjoining H. Duncan's
stable."[268] This advertisement ran continually for a period of two years. John Mattingly
evidently came from Missouri in the same year, and remained until 1852, when he returned to
St. Louis to ply his trade.[269] While he was in Louisville he ran an advertisement in the
Journal after this fashion: "The undersigned wishes to purchase 100 negroes both men and women,
for which he will pay the highest cash prices. Those who have negroes for sale would do well
to call on him at the Gait House."[270]

It is noticeable that none of the Louisville directories for this period mention any slave
dealers. This failure may have been due merely to the fact that there were so few traders in
the city and that they were more or less transient residents. On the other hand, public opinion
apparently never acknowledged that there were any real citizens of the city engaged in the
slave trade. Beginning in 1840 the Louisville Journal published a weekly paper called Louisville
Prices Current. In 1855 this was succeeded by the Commercial Review and Louisville Prices Current,
which was published by the Louisville Chamber of Commerce. These two papers devoted themselves
exclusively to the commercial transactions of the city and gave price quotations weekly for
every conceivable kind of goods in the market together with the volume of sales. Strange to
say, there has not been found a single issue of either of these papers, which mentions the
selling price of slaves or any transaction in Negroes. If there was a trade in slaves which
was regarded purely as a commercial enterprise, as some would have us think, then it is very
hard to understand why these splendid trade papers did not contain any account of the business.

There were some Louisville business men who bought and sold slaves as only one of the branches
of their commercial activities. This would account to some extent for the failure to list traders
in the local directories for it is noticeable that such men never called themselves slave dealers.
As early as the year 1825 John Stickney established the Louisville Intelligence Office on Main
Street, which was a sort of labor and real estate exchange. He advertised that he sold books;
had money to loan; houses for rent and sale; horses and Negroes for sale and hire; carriages
for sale; conducted a labor exchange, and recommended the best boarding houses.[271] A year
later J. C. Gentry opened the "Western Horse Market" at the corner of Market and Fourth Streets.
He advertised that he conducted a livery stable, and also sold on commission, at public or
private sale, horses, carriages, cattle, wagons and slaves; and that he would conduct an auction
on Wednesdays and Saturdays.[272] A similar case was that of A. C. Scott, who in 1854 opened
a real estate and land office but who stated in the press that he not only bought and sold
land and rented houses but that he would sell and hire slaves.[273] Consequently Scott was
listed as a real estate and land agent in the local directories. It is impossible to determine
how many of these occasional slave dealers there were, but in so far as available material
shows these three were the only ones to announce their trade publicly.

It would appear from all the evidence at hand that while Kentucky furnished many slaves for
the southern market there was no general internal slave trade, as a commercial enterprise.
There were in Louisville, however, a few heartless business men who took advantage of the decreasing
value of slave labor in Kentucky and the rising prices of slaves in the far South. In this
respect, Kentucky became a field of supply for the slave markets of the lower South.

Unfortunately there are no statistics available by which the number of slaves sent south can
be computed. The most comprehensive anti-slavery publication on the internal slave trade was
unable to decide with certainty what proportion of slaves for the southern market was furnished
by each of the so-called breeding States. The author of Slavery and Internal Slave Trade in
the United States estimated that 80,000 slaves were annually exported from seven States to
the South. He gave no figures that were not his own estimates. It is reasonable to suppose
that during the last two decades of the slavery era there were few slaves imported into Kentucky
that were intended for the purely Kentucky market. What Negroes came into Kentucky were for
the most part on their way to the more profitable southern trade. The average death rate among
the slaves during this period was 1.9 per one hundred and the birth rate was 3.2, or an excess
of births over deaths of 1.1 per hundred. This would make the annual natural increase among
the slave population about 2,000 per year. Comparing this with the growth of the slave group
from 1840 to 1850 we find that the increase of slaves was much more. But it was during the
next decade that the slave trade reached its height and here we find that the slave population
increased 14,502, whereas the natural increase during that period should have been 23,190.
Hence the slaves failed to reach even their natural increase by a deficiency of 8,688. Taken
literally that would mean that during the ten-year period that number of slaves were exported
from Kentucky. But it is reasonable to suppose that many more than that were sent to the South.
With the exception of the last decade, however, the slave population of Kentucky increased
faster than the mere natural increase of the Negroes. The law would not permit of any importation
of slaves intended for Kentucky, so the export of purely Kentucky slaves appears never to have
been prominent except during the decade from 1850 to 1860.

The selling price of slaves naturally presents itself at this point. In Kentucky these records
are very few because the tax books in practically all the counties of the State have been destroyed.
We have no accurate statements extant before about the year 1855. The prices which we have
obtained are quotations from the auction of slaves of estates to settle the interests of the
heirs. On January court day, in 1855, there were sold in the settlement of estates in Bourbon,
Fayette, Clark and Franklin Counties Negro men who brought $1,260, $1,175, $1,070, $1,378,
$1,295, $1,015 and $1,505.[276] The county commissioner of Harrison auctioned the slaves of
the deceased George Kirkpatrick with the following prices received:

     America     40 years of age  }
     Peggy        6 years of age  } all for $1,600
     Eliza        4 years of age  }
     Brown        6 months of age }

     Peter       23 years  of age      $1,290
     Emanuel     24 years  of age         750
     Tom         16 years  of age       1,015
     Ann         14 years  of age         775
     Emma        12 years  of age         865
     Sarah       26 years  of age         350[277]

The county commissioner at Henderson received the following prices for slaves in the settlement
of several estates on January 28, 1858:[278]

     Ruth          33 years of age        $   800
     Willis        59 years of age            475
     George        35 years of age          1,200
     Delphy        80 years of age             75
     Leila         65 years of age            282
     Clarissa      24 years of age          1,131
     Andrew        19 years of age          1,500
     Susan         17 years of age            470
     Jennie        17 years of age          1,100
     Cupid         85 years of age             74
     Eliza         32 years of age            500
     Bell          41 years of age          1,000

This sale is most significant for the cases of "Delphy," 80 years old, and "Cupid," 85 years
of age. It is difficult to account for such a sale in any discussion of the slave trade, but
it does show the humanitarian side of Kentucky slavery. Negroes at such an age had no economic
value even if they were given away, because the expense of their maintenance was more than
the value of any possible labor they could perform.

At Georgetown in December of the same year we have this record:[279]

     Griffin      45 years of age     $  640
     Mary         14 years of age      1,060
     Ellen        12 years of age        800
     Elizabeth    11 years of age        406 (one-eyed)
     Sanford       9 years of age        700
     Arabel       10 years of age        690
     Adam         41 years of age        700
     Bettie        3 years of age        260
     Aaron        28 years of age      1,191
     Sam          25 years of age      1,350

The auction of the slaves of the estate of Spencer C. Graves at Lexington in April, 1859, brought
these prices:[280]

     John       18 years of age                 $1,500
     Dick       21 years of age                  1,400
     Jerry      38 years of age                    700
     Major      50 years of age                    480
     Charles    31 years of age                  1,155
     John Jr    18 years of age                  1,140
     Billy      31 years of age                  1,100
     Isabella   40 years, with 3 children, ages
                   11, 5 and 2                   1,610
     Rebecca    30 years, with 3 children, ages
                   11, 6 and 4                   2,410
     Lucy       18 years of age, with infant     1,280
     Davidella  31 years of age                  1,220
     Mary Ann   31 years of age                    835
     Patience   18 years of age                  1,350
     Catharine  15 years of age                  1,130

Such a series of prices would show beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of slaves was determined
entirely by the increasing demand for slaves in the lower South and was in no way an indication
of the value of slave labor within Kentucky. As was pointed out earlier in this chapter, the
labor value of an agricultural slave in the State steadily decreased after about the year 1830.

Was slavery profitable to the Kentucky planters? In the many debates on the slavery question
which took place after 1830 no one ever stood out in the affirmative. The only ones to discuss
the economic side of the issue were those in opposition to slavery. As has often been said
of the Kentucky situation, "the program was to use negroes to raise corn to feed hogs to feed
negroes, who raised more corn to feed more hogs." Tobacco was the largest crop raised in the
State and corn came next. Neither proved to be peculiarly adapted to slave labor. There were
few large plantations in the State where it could be made advantageous. What Negro work there
was to be done was never confined to any particular kind of cultivation but was used in the
manner of farm labor today in the State. Squire Turner, of Madison County, in the Constitutional
Convention of 1849 made a careful summary of the existing economic problems of slavery. "There
are," said he, "about $61,000,000 worth of slave property in the state which produces less
than three per cent profit on the capital invested, or about half as much as the moneyed capital
would yield. There are about 200,000 slaves in Kentucky. Of these about seventy-five per cent
are superannuated, sick, women in unfit condition for labor, and infants unable to work, who
yield no profit. Show me a man that has forty or fifty slaves on his estate, and if there are
ten out of that number who are available and valuable, it is as much as you can expect. But
my calculation allows you to have seventy-five per cent who are barely able to maintain themselves,
to pay for their own clothing, fuel, house room and doctor's bills. Is there any gentleman
who has a large number of slaves, who will say that they are any more profitable than that?"[281]
