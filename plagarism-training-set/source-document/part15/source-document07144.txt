 The orator of the day rightly, in our
opinion, described that hallowed spot in Bodenstown as one of the holiest places in Ireland
to-day, from the nationalist standpoint, holding as it does the ashes of the man who, without
friends, money or influence to help him, and by sheer force of character, intensity of purpose
and earnestness, prevailed upon the greatest emperor-general the world has ever seen Napoleon
Bonaparte, to make a descent on Ireland, in order to aid our starved, tortured, and persecuted
people to shake off the shackles that kept them in slavery, and elevate Ireland once more to
the dignity of full, free, and untrammelled nationhood. We are all familiar with the events
following this great effort of Tone's, and the dark chapters that closed a glorious career.
All that is mortal of Tone is in the keeping of Kildare, and it is a trust that we feel sure
is not alone felt to be a high honour, but which cannot fail to keep the cultivation of a high
standard of nationality before the people in whose midst repose the remains of one of Ireland's
greatest sons. Ireland, from the centre to the sea, was represented in Sunday's great gathering
to commemorate the achievements of Wolfe Tone, and the occasion was honoured first by the large
and representative character of the throng, secondly by the decorum observed all through the
day's proceedings, and thirdly, by the regularity and precision which attended the entire arrangements.
There was just one other feature which must have been very gratifying to those identified with
the organisation of the pilgrimage, namely: the large proportion of ladies and young people,
coming long distances, who made up the gathering. And they were by no means the least enthusiastic
of the throng. This enthusiasm amongst our young people is one of the most encouraging and
promising signs of the times, serving as it does to demonstrate the undying spirit of Irish
nationality, and the perpetuation of those principles to which Tone devoted his time, talents,
and eventually made the supreme sacrifice of his life in having inculcated amongst his people.
It is a glorious legacy, and one that has ever been cherished with veneration for the men who
left it. He died a martyr to the cause he espoused, but his memory and the cause live. The
living blaze he and his co-workers, in the cause of Irish freedom, kindled has never been completely
stamped out, and it still smoulders, and has occasionally burst into flame only to be temporarily
extinguished in the blood and tears of our bravest and best who never forgot the teachings
of Tone. And now, when the sky is bright once more, and every circumstance portends the dawn
of a new era, full of hope and promise for the ultimate realisation of those ideals for which
thousands of our race have sacrificed their lives, the spark of nationality which, even since
Tone's death, has repeatedly leaped into flame, still glows fitfully to remind us that come
what may it remains undying and unquenchable, a beacon to light us on the path to freedom should
disappointment and dashed hopes again darken the outlook.
