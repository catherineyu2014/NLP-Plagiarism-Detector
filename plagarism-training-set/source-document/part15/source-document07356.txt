CHARIVARIA.

MR. WILLIAM WATSON describes his new book of verse, The Man Who Saw, as "an intermittent commentary
on the main developments and some of the collateral phenomena of the War." People are already
asking, "Why was a man like this left out of the Dardanelles Commission?"

Weeds are a source of great trouble to the amateur gardener, says a contemporary, because he
is not always able to recognise them. A good plan is to pull them out of the ground. If they
come up again they are weeds.

       ***

We hope that Mr. CHARLES COCHRAN is not indisposed, but we have not noticed a new revue by
him this week.

       ***

Sulphur from Italy is being distributed by the Explosives Committee. This body must not be
confused with the Expletives Committee, which gets it supply of sulphur straight from the Front.

       ***

The Metropolitan Water Board is appealing against waste of water. It is proposed to provide
patriotic householders with attractive cards stating that the owner of the premises in which
the card is displayed is bound in honour not to touch the stuff.

       ***

According to a member of the Inventions Board, over two thousand solutions of the U-boat problem
have already been received. Unfortunately this is more than the number of U-boats available
for experiment, but it is hoped that by strictly limiting the allowance to one submarine per
invention the question may be determined in a manner satisfactory to the greatest possible number.

       ***

Of eight applications received by the Barnes Council for the vacancy of Inspector of Nuisances
three came from men of military age. It is expected that the Council will suggest that these
gentlemen should be invited to inspect the nuisances in front of the British trenches.

       ***

The proprietor of thirteen steam rollers told the Egham Tribunal that in two years he had only
been able to take one of them out of the yard. We cannot think that he has really tried. Much
might have been done with kindness and a piece of cheese, while we have often seen quite large
steam rollers being enticed along the road by a man with a red flag.

       ***

A Swiss correspondent is informed that "Hindenburg's legs are no longer strong enough to support
him." The weakness appears to be gradually extending to his arms.

       ***

"The starched collar must go," remarks a contemporary ruefully. Not, we hope, before a substitute
has been found for some of those unwashable necks.

       ***

"Lady conductors," said the Underground Railway official last week, "must remember that the
seats and straps are put there for the use of the passengers." We know all about straps, but
we have often wondered what it feels like to use one of the seats on the Underground.

       ***

The police have raided a coining plant in Marylebone. It is becoming more and more difficult
to make money.

       ***

Under a recent Government order the importation of wild animals into Great Britain is forbidden.
Allotment holders throughout the country hope the order will be read out to any wireworm or
potato-moth that attempts to land at our ports.

       ***

A deputation to the FOOD CONTROLLER has demanded that the allowance of bread to farm labourers
should be increased to two pounds per head per day. The amount is considered excessive in view
of the national needs, and the alternative course of permitting them to eat all they can grow
is being favourably considered.

       ***

Mr. MITCHEL, the Mayor of New York, has forbidden musicians to play the National Anthems of
the Allies in ragtime. Mr. MITCHEL is a great humanitarian and simply hates the sound of anything
in pain.
