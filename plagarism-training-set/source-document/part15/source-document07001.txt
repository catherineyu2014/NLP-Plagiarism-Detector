PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

CHARIVARIA.

"They know nothing about the War in Greenland," said M. DANGAARD IENSEN to a contemporary,
and now the Intelligence Department is wondering whether it didn't perhaps choose the wrong
colour after all for its tabs.

       ***

The Governor of Greenland, giving evidence in the Prize Court last week, was greatly interested
to learn that there was a well-known hymn, entitled "From Greenland's Icy Mountains." He was,
however, inclined to think that the unfortunate reference to the rigorous nature of the climate
would be resented by the local Publicity Committee, to whose notice he would feel it his duty
to bring the matter when they were next thawed out.

       ***

Lord DEVONPORT has established his own Press Bureau, and it is rumoured that the Press Bureau
is about to appoint its own Food Controller.

       ***

The American Line has advanced its First-Class fares by three pounds. It is hoped that this
will effectually discourage Mr. HENRY FORD from visiting Europe for some time to come. And
still the authorities pretend that juvenile crime is confined to the East End.

       ***

A telegram despatched from London on January 22nd, 1906, which contained a polling result of
the General Election then in progress, has just been received by a Witham resident, who told
the messenger there was no reply.

       ***

"If agriculture is to flourish," says The Daily Mail, "it must be so conducted as to pay."
It is just this sordid commercialism that distorts the Carmelite point of view.

       ***

The German Union for the Development of the German Language have sent a petition to the CHANCELLOR,
asking that in any future Peace negotiations the German language should be used. Will German
frightfulness never cease?

       ***

"Anybody in the Carmarthen district," says the local medical officer, "can keep a pig in the
parlour if they keep it clean." The necessity of keeping the parlour clean for the sake of
its guest will be easily understood by those who appreciate the fastidious taste of the pig.

       ***

A Hungarian paper complains that the Government treats the War as if it were merely a family
affair. This contrasts unfavourably with the more broadly hospitable attitude of the Allies,
who have made it abundantly clear that so far as they are concerned anyone is welcome to join
in and help their side.

       ***

The other day a Farnham bellringer, after cycling seventy miles, rang a peal of 5,940 changes.
It is not known why.

       ***

"War diet," says Professor ROSIN in the Lokal Anzeiger, "improves the action of the heart."
But what the Germans really want to know is, what improves a war diet?

       ***

Among the goods stolen from a Crouch Hill provision merchant's the other day were eight cheeses
and ten hams. As the place was much littered it is thought that the cheeses put up a plucky fight.

       ***

It is pointed out by experienced agriculturists that it is useless to plant potatoes unless
steps are taken to destroy the insect pests. A Peterborough farmer has written a poem in The
Daily Express against those pests, but we fancy that if a permanent improvement is to be effected
it will be necessary to adopt much sterner measures than this.

       ***

The recent vagaries of the Weather Controller are said to be due to one of the new railway
regulations, by which you are required to "Show all seasons, please."

       ***

Even Nature seems upset by the War. According to The Evening Standard primroses are blooming
in a Harrow garden, while only the other day a pair of white spats were to be seen in the Strand.

Another Glimpse of the Obvious.

From the "Standing Orders" of a Military Hospital:--

    "Officers confined to their beds will have their meals in their rooms."

       *       *       *       *       *

    "A gale of great fury raged at Sheffield early on Tuesday morning. Much
    damage was done in the city and outlying districts, a number of beings
    being unroofed."--Yorkshire Paper.

Several others have been noticed to have a tile loose.

       *       *       *       *       *

    "The welcome, amounting to an oration, which heralded the Prime
    Minister, was the most remarkable feature of a very remarkable
    occasion." Daily Dispatch.

Is this quite kind to the subsequent speakers?

       *       *       *       *       *

    "By his colleagues at Bar he has been regarded as a sound lawyer, well
    worthy of the high position which he had filled for little over two
    hundred years."--Englishman (Calcutta).

Lord HALSBURY must look to his laurels.

    "Mr. Clement Wragge has prepared a special weather forecast for the
    year 9117. His opinion is that the year will prove distinctly good."
    New Zealand Times.

We infer that, in Mr. WRAGGE's opinion, the War will be over by then.

The Minimum.

Extract from a letter just received from H.Q. in France:--

    "C.O.'s will take care that all ranks know that they must never parade
    before an Officer--Brigade, Regimental or Company--unless properly
    dressed, wearing at least a belt."

       *       *       *       *       *

    "The few women on the platform were dressed quietly, as befitted the
    occasion, the smartest person present being Mr. McKenna."--Illustrated
    Sunday Herald.

Our contemporary might have told us what he wore.

THE GOLFER'S PROTEST.

  Among the shocks that laid us flat
    When WILLIAM loosed his wanton hordes
  There fell no bloodier blow than that
    Which turned our niblicks into swords;
  And O how bitter England's cup,
    In what despair the order sunk her
  That called her Cincinnati up
    When busy ploughing in the bunker!

  Even with those who stuck it out,
    Bravely defying public shame,
  Visions of trenches knocked about
    Would often spoil their usual game;
  Rumours of victory dearly bought,
    Or else of bad strategic hitches,
  Disturbed their concentrated thought
    And put them off their mashie pitches.

  Now comes a menace yet more rude
    That puts us even further off;
  It says the nation's need of food
    Must come before the claims of golf;
  We hear of parties going round,
    Aided by local War-Committees,
  To violate our sacred ground
    By planting veg. along our "pretties."

  If there be truth in that report,
    Then have we reached the limit, viz.:--
  The ruin of that manly sport
    Which made our country what it is;
  The ravages we soon restore
    By conies wrought or hoofs of mutton,
  But centuries must pass before
    A turnip-patch is fit to putt on.

  What! Shall we sacrifice the scenes
    On which our higher natures thrive
  Just to provide the vulgar means
    To keep our lower selves alive?
  Better to starve (or, better still,
    Up hands and kiss the Hun peace-makers)
  Than suffer PROTHERO to till
    The British golfer's holy acres.

O.S.

PERSONAL PARS FROM THE WESTERN FRONT.

(With acknowledgments to some of our chatty contemporaries.)

HAPPY C.-IN-C.--I saw the Commander-in-Chief to-day passing through the little village of X
in an open car. He was very quietly dressed in khaki, with touches of scarlet on the hat and
by the collar. I waved my hand to him and he returned the salute. It is small acts like this
which endear him to all. I noticed that the Field-Marshal was not carrying his baton. Doubtless
he did not wish to spoil its pristine freshness with the mud of the roads.
