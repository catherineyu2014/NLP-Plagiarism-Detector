Since the lumber was used three times, $30 ÷ 3 = $10 is the charge against each 1,000 ft. B.
M. needed to encase the concrete on a floor. There were nearly 34,000 ft. B. M. per floor,
hence the cost of lumber ready for erection was $340 per floor. There were as shown below,
200 cu. yds. of concrete per floor, so that the cost was $340 ÷ 200 = $1.70 per cu. yd. of
concrete for forms ready for erection. It took a gang of 5 men 7 days to tear down and carry
up the forms for one floor; hence 5 × $2 × 7 = $70 per floor, or practically $2 per M. ft.
B. M., or $0.35 per cu. yd. of concrete for taking down and carrying forms two stories. It
took a gang of 10 carpenters 7 days to erect these forms, which at $3.50 per day was $245 per
floor, or $7 per M. ft. B. M., or $1.20 per cu. yd. of concrete.

Concrete.--The amount of concrete per floor was as follows:

Floor slab 3½ ins. thick, 10,200 sq. ft.       110 cu. yds.
Beams, 10×10 ins.                               40 cu. yds.
Beams, 5×10 ins.                                20 cu. yds.
Columns, 15×15 ins. (average)                   30 cu. yds.
                                              -----
Total concrete per floor                       200 cu. yds.

A concrete mixer, a hoist and a gang of 14 men mixed and placed the concrete for a floor in
7 days. At $2 per day for labor this gives 14 × 7 × $2 = $196, or say $1 per cu. yd. for mixing
and placing the concrete.

Reinforcement.--In each of the 10×10-in. beams there were 4, 1-in. round rods, 2 straight and
2 bent, and stirrups of 1/8×1-in. straps spaced 5 ins. apart at columns and 15 ins. at the
center. In each 5×10-in. beam there was half as much steel as in a 10×10-in. beam. The floor
slab reinforcement consisted of ¼-in. rods spaced 5 ins. apart and 2 cross-rods in 7-ft. panel.
The column reinforcement consisted of 4 rods averaging 1 in. in diameter. In round numbers
the amount of steel required for each floor was, therefore, as follows:

Lbs. steel rods in 10×10-in. beams                   16,200
Lbs. steel rods in 5×10-in. beams                     4,000
Lbs. stirrups in beams                                3,000
Lbs. steel rods in floor slabs                        3,800
Lbs. steel rods in columns                            1,400
                                                     ------
Total pounds steel per floor                         28,400

This is equivalent to 142 lbs. of steel per cubic yard of concrete, or about 1 per cent of
the total volume of reinforced concrete was steel. The steel in the beams was about 3 per cent.
It required a gang of 5 laborers 7 days at $2.25 per day, to bend and place the steel for each
floor or $86 for labor on 28,400 lbs. of steel. This is equivalent to 0.3 ct. per lb., or 45
cts. per cu. yd. of concrete.

Summary of Costs.--Summarizing the figures given we have the following cost per cubic yard
of concrete in floors and columns:

                                                        Per cu. yd.

        Total                                                $12.65

~WALL AND ROOF CONSTRUCTION FOR ONE-STORY CAR BARN.~--The barn was 50 ft. wide and 190 ft.
long, divided into three rooms by two transverse partitions and covered with a 4-in. roof having
a pitch of ½ in. per foot. The main walls were 12 ins. thick and the partition walls 10 ins.
thick. The main room 110 ft. long had four car tracks its whole length with pits under each
and a 6-in. reinforced concrete floor slab between. The floor girders, one under each rail,
were 12 ins. square, each reinforced by three 1¾-in. rods, and were carried on 12×12-in. pillars.
The total yardage of concrete was 874 cu. yds. divided as follows:

Walls and foundations, cu. yds.                                614
Pillars and girders in track pits, cu. yds.                     44
Reinforced floors, cu. yds.                                     55
Roof                                                           160
                                                               ---
Total, cu. yds.                                                873

A 1-2½-5 concrete was used for floors, roofs and girders and a 1-3-6 concrete for foundations
and walls. There were 26½ tons of reinforcing steel, or 61 lbs. per cu. yd., or 0.45 per cent.
of the volume of the concrete was steel. The wages paid were: Foreman, $2.50; blacksmith, $2;
engineer, $1.75; laborers, $1.50; two-horse team and driver, $3.67; one-horse team and driver,
$2.92; carpenter, $2.25; carpenters worked 9 hours; all others 10 hours.

Forms.--Carpenters framed and erected forms and common laborers under foreman carpenter took
them down. Lagging was all 2-in. stuff and uprights 3×4-in. stuff. Props for roof forms were
18-ft. round timber procured on the job. They were 6 ins. in diameter at the top and cost 50
cts. each, 91 being used. These props are not included in the lumber listed below, but their
cost is included in the costs given. No record was kept of the number of times the lumber was
used, but as 54,643 ft. B. M. were bought and about twice this much would be needed to enclose
the concrete if used only once, we will assume that all lumber was used twice. Including the
props there were about 60,000 ft. B. M., or 70 ft. B. M. per cu. yd. of concrete. The cost
of the lumber was $1,520.86, and the cost of labor on the forms was $1,660.60, so that the
cost of forms was:

  Item.   Per cu. yd. Per M. ft. Per sq. ft.
Lumber      $1.74      $13.50     $0.038
Labor        1.90       14.07      0.041
            -----      ------     ------
  Total     $3.64      $27.57     $0.079

If the lumber had been used only once the cost per cubic yard would have been $5.38, and per
M. ft. B. M., $41.07.

Concrete.--A railway track was run the full length of the building upon what was eventually
the fourth track of the car barn and a Ransome mixer was set up as close to the track as possible
allowing a platform to be built between it and the track. Cars were brought up to this platform
and the materials handled by wheelbarrows direct from cars to mixer. Both platform and mixer
were moved twice as the work progressed. The concrete was taken by wheelbarrows on runways
to the side walls. For the roof it was hoisted by a horse by means of a mast having an arm
with a three-quarters swing; the barrows were hoisted direct using a hook for the wheel and
two rings for the handles.

The cost of the concrete for materials was:

1.1 bbl. cement at $1.21, per cu. yd.    $1.33
¾ ton sand at 75 cts., per cu. yd.        0.55
Aggregate, per cu. yd.                    0.88
61 lbs. steel at 1.9 cts., per cu. yd.    1.15
Lumber, 70 ft. B. M. at $27, per cu. yd.  1.74
                                         -----
  Total per cu. yd.                      $5.65

The cost of labor per cubic yard was:

Forms, per cu. yd.                         $1.900
Mixing, per cu. yd.                         0.210
Placing, per cu. yd.                        0.310

Handling sand, per cu. yd.                  0.104
Handling steel, per cu. yd.                 0.270
Handling aggregate, per cu. yd.             0.222
Coal, at $4.25 per ton, per cu. yd.         0.010
Foreman, per cu. yd.                        0.133
Teams and laying pipe line, per cu. yd.     0.087
                                           ------
  Total, per cu. yd.                       $3.406

Summarizing, we have the following cost per cubic yard:

Concrete materials, per cu. yd.         $2.76
Labor mixing and placing concrete        1.01
Forms, materials and labor               3.64
Reinforcement, materials and labor       1.42
Fuel, foreman and pipe line labor        0.23
                                        -----
Total, per cu. yd.                      $9.06

The cost for handling steel, making stirrups, welding, etc., was $8.90 per ton, or 0.45 ct. per lb.

CONSTRUCTING WALL COLUMNS FOR A ONE-STORY MACHINE SHOP.--The building was 53×600 ft.; each
side wall consisted of 40 columns of channel section carried on footings of channel section
somewhat heavier than that of the column. The columns were spaced 15 ft. on centers and each
was 7½ ft. wide so that there were 7½ ft. spaces between columns, which were filled with 3-in.
curtain walls extending 7½ ft. above the floor. Figures 228 and 229 show the column and footing
construction. Each column contained 125 cu. ft., or 4.63 cu. yds. of 1-3-5 1-in. crushed slag
concrete above the footing and the costs given here relate only to the columns above footings.
In the 80 columns there were 370 cu. yds. of concrete.

Forms.--A column form is shown by Fig. 230; it contains approximately 1,000 ft. B. M. of lumber.
Ten of these forms were used, so that 10,000 ft. B. M. of form lumber were required for 370
cu. yds. of concrete, or 27 ft. B. M. per cu. yd. of concrete. Each column had a superficial
area excluding ends of about 420 sq. ft., so that 420 × 80 = 33,600 sq. ft. was the superficial
area of all the columns and 10,000 ft. B. M. ÷ 33,600 sq. ft. = 0.3 ft. B. M., or, say, 1/3
ft. B. M., of form lumber was used per square foot of concrete enclosed. The cost of the forms
per 1,000 ft. B. M., and, therefore, per form, was:

Lumber, 1,000 ft. B. M., at $31.75     $31.75
Labor constructing form                 16.39
                                       ------
Total per 1,000 ft. B. M.              $48.14

This gives us a cost per cubic yard of concrete for materials and labor constructing forms
of $480 ÷ 370 = $1.30, and per square foot of outside wall area of $480 ÷ (146 × 80) = 4.1 cts.

The erection and taking down of the forms, owing to the weight of some of the pieces, was done
by means of special derricks. The footings were brought to within ½ in. of grade and a tenon
form of the exact shape of the channel section of the column was placed on top and filled with
grout to a depth of 1 in. These tenons served as guides in setting the column forms, and proved
to be much quicker and more accurate than points.

The forms were assembled on the ground and erected by a 35-ft. A-frame derrick mounted on wheels.
The construction is shown by Fig. 231. This derrick had a capacity of about 4 tons and carried
a Ransome friction crab hoist driven by a 5 h.p. Meitz & Weiss kerosene oil engine. It was
the practice to set a number of forms before filling any. This enabled the carpenter gang to
be plumbing up the first form while the erecting gang were setting others. The forms had to
be very securely guyed and braced to withstand the impact of the falling concrete. Very little
trouble was had in keeping them well lined up.

Two gangs were employed in assembling forms and a portion of the men in each gang also shaped
and placed the reinforcement and placed and tamped the concrete in the forms so that no exact
division of labor is possible. The organization of these gangs and the wages paid were as follows:

  Derrick Gang:

1 foreman, at 36 cts. per hour                  $ 3.94
1 crabman, at 30 cts. per hour                    2.70
2 topmen, at 27 cts. per hour                     4.86
2 bottom men, at 23 cts. per hour                 4.14
                                                ------
Total per 9-hour day                            $15.64

  Assembling Gang:

1 boss carpenter, at 47 cts. per hour           $ 4.23
2 carpenters, at 36 cts. per hour                 6.48
2 carpenters, at 30 cts. per hour                 5.40
2 carpenters' helpers, at 25 cts. per hour        4.50
4 men forming and placing reinforcing steel
  and rethreading bolts, at 23 cts. per hour      8.28
                                                ------
  Total per 9-hour day                          $28.89
                                                ------
  Grand total                                   $44.53

These gangs assembled and erected the molds and concreted 80 columns in 22 working days, including
2 days lost on account of cold weather, so that 4 columns were completed per day of 9 hours.
We can subdivide the cost as follows:

  Item.                            Per cu. yd.

Erecting forms and concreting          $0.81
Assembling forms and reinforcement      1.56
                                       -----
Total                                  $2.37

Charging the 4 men placing reinforcement and rethreading bolts to forming and placing reinforcement
alone we can figure the cost of fabrication and erection of reinforcement very closely. There
were 160 lbs. of reinforcing steel in each column, hence $8.28 ÷ (160 × 4) = 1.3 cts., was
the cost per pound of forming and placing it. This includes handling.

The stripping of the forms was carried on by another gang using a derrick similar to the first
one described, except it could be of lighter construction as it had to handle only the separate
parts of each form and not the forms assembled. The derrick shown in Fig. 232 was a 33-ft.
A-frame, with wheels at the bottom of each leg. It had a friction crab hoist driven by an electric
motor, both of which were fastened to the derrick frame between the shear legs.

The operation of stripping required only four men and the crabman. The outside flat panel was
removed first, and left leaning up against the concrete while the inside trough shaped panel
was pried loose and lowered onto the ground with its inside face uppermost. The side panels
being comparatively light, were stripped without the use of the derrick, and these panels were
assembled on the ground with the inside piece. The derrick then picked up the outside panel
again, and placed it in its proper place. After the bolts were put in place, the assembled
form was moved on rollers to another point in the line of columns where it was again erected.
The arrangement of derricks for erecting and stripping forms is shown in Fig. 233.

Concrete.--The concrete was mixed in a No. 2 Ransome mixer and delivered to the work in Ransome
concrete carts. These carts were pushed along a runway which terminated in a slight incline
under the derrick so that their contents could be emptied into the derrick buckets.

The concrete was hoisted in an 8-ft. bottom dump bucket, using the derrick described above.
It was necessary to stir up the concrete thoroughly with long-handled slicers as it was being
deposited in order to prevent segregation. This expedient combined with a wet mixture and tight
molds was found to overcome this difficulty very effectually.

The gang mixing and wheeling concrete was made up as follows:

1 mixer foreman and engineer at 27 cts. per hour     $ 2.43
4 laborers charging mixer at 18 cts per hour           6.48
4 laborers wheeling concrete at 18 cts. per hour       6.48
                                                     ------
Total per 9-hour day                                 $15.39

This gang mixed and wheeled concrete for four columns, or 18.52 cu. yds., hence the cost per
cubic yard was 82.6 cts.

With cement at $1.60 per bbl., sand at $1 per cu. yd. and slag at $1.10
per cu. yd. the cost of materials per cubic yard of concrete was $3.
Concrete materials                     $3.00
Reinforcing steel                       0.73
Forms, lumber and framing               1.30
Forms, erecting and concreting          0.81
Forms, assembling and reinforcement     1.56
Forms, stripping                        0.63
Mixing and wheeling concrete            0.83
                                       -----
Total                                  $8.86

~CONSTRUCTING ONE-STORY WALLS WITH MOVABLE FORMS AND GALLOWS FRAMES.~--In constructing the
walls for an 85×30-ft. factory building at Old Bridge, N. J., Mr. A. E. Budell made use of
movable forms and gallows frames to construct the curtain walls and columns in one piece. Each
side wall was built its full height in successive 50-ft. lengths by depositing the concrete
between two forms which were moved upward as the concreting progressed. Fig. 234 indicates
the mode of procedure. The form was raised and lowered by means of two gallows frames fitted
with blocks and tackle. A steel cable, with a trolley affixed, extending from one frame to
the other, provided a convenient mode of hoisting material to the form, and the gallows frames
took the place of ladders for climbing onto the structure. No scaffolding whatever was used
and only one man was required overhead to dump the buckets and tamp the concrete into place.

The two walls were carried up simultaneously, one form being shifted into place and filled
while the other was left in place until the concrete was sufficiently hard. It was found that
18 hours was amply sufficient to allow the concrete to set hard, after which the form was removed
and lifted to a higher level. Thus the men were continuously engaged in lifting and filling
first one form and then the other. The average length of time required to remove, raise and
fill one form was 5 to 6 hours. Thus, two forms could be raised and filled almost every day.
The construction of the forms and of the gallows frames is shown by Figs. 234 and 235. The
cost of one set of forms and gallows frames was as follows:

320 ft. B. M. of 2×10 in.×10 ft. plank at $34      $ 10.88
150 ft. B. M. of 3×4 in.×16 ft. spruce at $33         5.25
135½ ft. B. M. 1×8 in. yellow pine at $30               4.08

4 sills 6×8 ins.×16 ft., 2 caps 6×6 ins.×9 ft.,
4 braces 6×6 ins.×16 ft. = 490 ft. B. M. at $30.     14.70
3 pieces 3×10 ins.×20 ft. = 150 ft. B. M. at $30      4.50
