The time of year when this event took place was in the early days of autumn. Daylight and the
combatants arrived on the scene together. Vague particulars of the preliminaries between them
have been variously retailed, but they are not necessary to the narrative, and therefore not
referred to. The fact that the elder Cameron was reputed to be a skilled swordsman, also that
it was not the first time he had met his foes in the field, may have had some effect on the
nerves of his younger opponent, but there was no outward indication of it. The home-taught
countryman, however, must have felt that he was standing face to face with no ordinary opponent.
Alan, like the generality of young men, had such practice in the use of the weapon as to make
him acquainted with the cuts and guards. The superiority of Mr Cameron was at first apparent
and proved, inasmuch as he not only kept himself for some time uninjured, but inflicted a severe
cut on Alan's left arm. This blow may be said to have brought the conflict to its sudden and
fatal termination. The pain, together with the humiliation, roused Alan's wrath to desperation.
It became manifest to the only two friends present, that the life of one, if not of the two
combatants, would be sacrificed; but they found themselves quite powerless to restrain the
rage of the wounded principal. Their anticipations were not long in being confirmed. The elder
Cameron fell from a blow delivered on the head by the powerful arm of his opponent. The force
may be imagined when it is stated that it was what is known as No. 7 cut, and that the wounded
man's sword in defending was forced into his own forehead. He lived just long enough to reach
Strone house--a mile or so distant. It is impossible, except to those who have experienced
a similar trial, to estimate the state of feeling such a painful scene produced on the three
now remaining on the field. Time, however, was not to be trifled with, for, although, there
were no "men in blue" to make prisoners of the breakers of the peace; yet the vanquished combatant
had friends who would not hesitate to take life for life. Alan's achates at once thought of
that probability, or of revenge in some form. They, therefore, hurried him away from the field
and across the river Lochy. A short consultation decided that he should remove himself entirely
from the Cameron country for the time being. This was concurred in by Alan, who girded his
claymore and determined on making direct for his uncle's house in Morvern--(Maclean of Drimnin)--distant
about sixty miles, where he arrived without resting or drawing breath. The advice of his counsel,
and the decision arrived at, proved to be not unnecessary, as the sequel proved. The fallen
man was one of the cadets of a numerous tribe, and they would naturally, in accordance with
the habit of the times, seek to avenge the death of their kinsman. They sought for the slayer
of their friend with diligence and zeal. Their search was far and wide; but, fortunately for
the fugitive, and thanks to the vigilance of his relatives, his pursuers were defeated in their
attempt to capture their intended victim. The consternation of the uncle (Drimnin), on learning
the cause of his nephew's sudden visit, may be surmised; but what was done could not be undone.
When the Laird was satisfied with Alan's version, that Morsheirlich fell in fair fight, brought
about by himself, his displeasure somewhat relented. Affection and sympathy mingled in the
old Laird's bosom, and he decided to befriend his unfortunate nephew at all hazard. It was
conjectured that the search of the avengers would be directed towards this district, where
Alan's relatives were numerous, and where he would likely betake himself in this emergency.
That he might elude his pursuers with greater certainty, the Laird of Drimnin had him escorted
across the Sound of Mull by some trusty kinsmen, to the charge of another Maclean (Pennycross),
and with whom he was to remain until he received further instructions respecting his future
destination. The grief and revenge of Morsheirlich's friends had not yet subsided, and would
not, for years to come, so that Alan would be unwise to return to his native home, or place
himself in their path.

The Collector of His Majesty's Customs at the Port of Greenock was an immediate relation to
the Laird of Drimnin by marriage, and a correspondence was entered on with him with the view
of ascertaining his opinion as to what was best to be done for Alan. Negotiations occupied
more time for their conduct at that time than in the present day; at any rate nothing satisfactory
was proposed to Alan, so that for a couple of years he continued wandering up and down the
island of Mull, and through the glens of Morvern, entirely under the guidance of his uncle.
At last a request came from the Collector to send the fugitive to him, that he might find employment
for him in his own office. The uncle decreed, rather against Alan's grain, that the offer of
clerkship should meanwhile be accepted. He remained in this occupation for several months,
until he received an invitation from another friend residing in Leith. This gentleman wrote
to say that there was now an opportunity of giving him service in an enterprise likely to be
congenial to "a man of metal" such as he conceived Alan to be. The war of American Independence
had commenced, and the employment which the Leith friend proposed was that Alan should join
a privateer which was fitting out in an English port, armed with letters of marque, to capture
and destroy American shipping. Alan answered the invitation by repairing to Leith in person
with all speed. The nature of the service offered, however, did not accord with his ideas of
honourable warfare; in fact, he considered it more akin to piracy, and not such as a gentleman
should take part in. He had no affection, he said, for clerkship, but he had still less for
the life of a pirate.

While Alan was oscillating in this manner, he learned that another relative of his mother's,
Colonel Alan Maclean of Torloisk, who had emigrated to one of the North American colonies some
years previously, had received a commission to embody a regiment of those of his countrymen
who had become residents on free-grants of land at the same time with himself. To this gentleman
Alan decided on going. Soldiering was more genial to his nature than marine freebooting, and
he calculated on Colonel Maclean's assistance in that direction. (This Colonel Maclean's grand-daughter
was Miss Clephane Maclean, afterwards Marchioness of Northampton.) Arrived in America, Alan
was received kindly by his relative, and being a soldier himself he viewed the past event in
Alan's life as of a nature not entirely without a certain amount of recommendation to a wanderer
in search of fame. Alan was not long in the country when Colonel Maclean added him to his list
of volunteers, in a body, which was soon afterwards enrolled as the "Royal Highland Emigrant
Corps."

BY ALASTAIR OG.

[CONTINUED.]

ON the conclusion of the "Spell of Cadboll" Norman received the hearty and unanimous congratulations
of the circle. The frail old bard, pulling himself together, got up, went across the room,
and shook him heartily with both hands. This special honour was a most unusual one. It was
clear that Alastair was just in the mood when a little persuasion would suffice to get him
to recite one of his own compositions. This he was generally very chary of doing, but Norman
getting the hint from one of his immediate neighbours to ask the bard a special favour on this
occasion at once begged the honour of hearing one of the bard's compositions from his own lips.
The venerable old man bent himself forward, began to work the fingers of both hands and beat
time on his leg as on a chanter, humming a quiet cronan. This was his usual practice when composing
or reciting poetry, and it was at once seen that he would consent. "I will give you," says
he, "a Marbh-rann, or Elegy which no one ever heard, and which I have recently composed to
the late 'Bailie Hector' of Dingwall, a son of my late esteemed friend 'Letterewe,' on condition
that you, Sir, will give us another story when I am done." Norman at once agreed, and the bard
commenced as follows:--

MARBHRANN.

DO BHAILIDH EACHAINN, INBHIR-FEOTHARAN, MAC FEAR LEITIR-IUGH.

          AIR FONN--"'S mi 'm shuidhe 'm 'onar."

    O 's truagh an sgeula tha 'n diugh ri fheutainn,
    Thug gal air ceudan a measg an t-sluaigh,
    Mu Eachainn gleusta 'bha fearail, feumail,
    Gun da ghlac an t-eug thu a threun-laoich chruaidh:
    'S mor bron do Chinnidh, mar eoin na tuinne
    Tha 'n cronan duilich 's an ullaidh uath
    'S bho nach duisg an gair thu, 's nach cluinn thu 'n gailich,
    Se chlaoidh do chairdean do bhas cho luath.

    Tha do chairdean cianal, tha bron da'lionadh,
    Tha 'n inntinn pianail bho n' ghlac thu 'm bas,
    'S iad a ghnath fuidh thiorachd 's nach faigh iad sgial ort,
    Ach thu bhi iosal an ciste chlar
    Bu tu ceann na riaghailt 'us lamh na fialachd,
    A sheoid gun fhiaradh, gun ghiamh gun sgath,
    'Sa nis bho 'n thriall thu, 's sinn lan dha d' iargan,
    'S nach eil 's na criochan fear a lionas d' ait.

    Bha d' aite miaghail 's gach cas an iarrt' thu,
    A reir mo sgiala bu teirc do luach:
    Bha thu pairteach, briathrach, ri ard 's ri iosal,
    Gun ch�s gun dioghaltas air an tuath.
    Bha foghlum Iarl' agad 's ciall fear riaghlaidh
    Bu mhor an diobhail nach da liath do ghruag,
    'S ann a bharc an t-aog ort mas d' thainig aois ort,
    A ghnuis bha faoilteach air chaochladh snuaidh.

    Bha do shnuadh cho aillidh 's nach fhaodainn s' aireamh,
    Mar r簷s a gharaidh ri maduinn dhriuchd,
    Bu chuachach, faineach, do ghruag an caradh--
    Mar theudan clarsaich an' inneal ciuil
    Do ghruaidh dhearg dhathte, do shuil mar dhearcag,
    Fuidh ghnuis na maise bu tapaidh s羅rd
    Rasg aotram, geanach, bho 'm b'fhaoilteach sealladh
    Beul muirneach tairis, 's deud thana dhluth.
