Relief hearing on possible earthquake prediction on April 22, 1980.
The text of the Law follows:

                 Assembly Bill No. 2202

                 CHAPTER 1046

            An act to amend Section 8897 of, to amend and
          renumber Section 8898 of, and to add Section
          8895.1 to, the Government Code, relating to the
          Seismic Safety Commission, making an appropriation
          therefor, and declaring the urgency thereof, to
          take effect immediately.

          [Approved by Governor September 25, 1980. Filed
          with Secretary of State September 26, 1980.]

                 LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

            AB 2202, Vicencia. Seismic Safety Commission.

            The Seismic Safety Commission Act, which will
          self-repeal, effective January 1, 1986,
          establishes the Seismic Safety Commission, and
          confers upon it various powers and duties relating
          to earthquake hazard reduction. The California
          Emergency Services Act confers various related
          powers and duties upon the Governor, the Director
          and the Department of Emergency Services, and the
          California Emergency Council.

            This bill would amend the Seismic Safety
          Commission Act by: changing the basic subject of
          the powers and duties of the commission to
          earthquake hazard mitigation and making certain
          corresponding changes in its powers and duties;
          including within commission responsibilities,
          scheduling on its agenda as required, a report on
          disaster mitigation issues from the Office of
          Emergency Services and defining, for such
          purposes, "disaster" as all natural hazards which
          could have an impact on public safety; and
          authorizing the commission to exercise various
          specified powers in relation to other disasters,
          as so defined, in connection with issues or items
          reported or discussed with the Office of Emergency
          Services at any commission meeting.

            This bill would also require the commission to
          initiate, as specified, a comprehensive program to
          prepare the state for responding to a major
          earthquake prediction, as specified.

            This bill would appropriate $750,000 for the
          purposes of this act.

            This act would take effect immediately as an
          urgency statute.

            Appropriation: yes.

          The people of the State of California do enact
          as follows:

            SECTION 1. Section 8895.1 is added to the
          Government Code, to read:

            8895.1. The
          program should be implemented in order to result
          in specific tools or products to be used by
          governments in responding to an earthquake
          prediction, such as educational materials for
          citizens. This program may be implemented on a
          prototypical basis in one area of the state
          affected by earthquake predictions, provided that
          it is useful for application in other areas of the
          state upon its completion.

            SEC. 2. Section 8897 of the Government Code is
          amended to read:

            8897. The commission is responsible for all of
          the following in connection with earthquake hazard
          mitigation:

            (a) Setting goals and priorities in the public
          and private sectors.

            (b) Requesting appropriate state agencies to
          devise criteria to promote earthquake and disaster
          safety.

            (c) Scheduling a report on disaster mitigation
          issues from the Office of Emergency Services, on
          the commission agenda as required. For the
          purposes of this subdivision, the term disaster
          refers to all natural hazards which could have
          impact on public safety.

            (d) Recommending program changes to state
          agencies, local agencies, and the private sector
          where such changes would improve earthquake
          hazards and reduction.

            (e) Reviewing the recovery and reconstruction
          efforts after damaging earthquakes.

            (f) Gathering, analyzing, and disseminating
          information.

            (g) Encouraging research.

            (h) Sponsoring training to help improve the
          competence of specialized enforcement and other
          technical personnel.

            (i) Helping to coordinate the earthquake safety
          activities of government at all levels.

            (j) Establishing and maintaining necessary
          working relationships with any boards,
          commissions, departments, and agencies, or other
          public or private organizations.

            SEC. 3. Section 8898 of the Government Code is
          amended and renumbered to read:

            8897.1. To implement the foregoing
          responsibilities, the commission may do any of the
          following:

            (a) Review state budgets and review grant
          proposals, other than those grant proposals
          submitted by institutions of postsecondary
          education to the federal government, for
          earthquake related activities and to advise the
          Governor and Legislature thereon.

            (b) Review legislative proposals, related to
          earthquake safety to advise the Governor and
          Legislature concerning such proposals, and to
          propose needed legislation.

            (c) Recommend the addition, deletion, or
          changing of state agency standards when, in the
          commission's view, the existing situation creates
          undue hazards or when new developments would
          promote earthquake hazard mitigation, and conduct
          public hearings as deemed necessary on the
          subjects.
