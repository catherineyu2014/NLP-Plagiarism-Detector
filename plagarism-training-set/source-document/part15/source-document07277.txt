GENERAL SIR DENNIS PACK (Vol. vii., p. 453.).--"As the purport of the Query may be defeated
by two misprints in my communication relative to this gallant soldier, may I beg of your readers
for 'French rebels,' to substitute 'Irish rebels;' and for 'Ballinakell,' 'Ballinakill.' I
am willing to lay the blame of these errata on my own cacography, rather than on the printer's
back.
