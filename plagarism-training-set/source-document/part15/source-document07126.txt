 1850.

Mr. Halliwell gives the words haver and havering, in the same sense as havior. Are not these
words identical with aver, averium, in the sense of cattle, tame beasts? Averium, from the
old French, aveir, i.e. avoir, originally meant any personal property; but like catalla, chattels,
it came to signify more particularly the most important part of a peasant's possessions--namely,
his live stock. Thus, in the laws of William the Conqueror (Thorpe's Ancient Laws, vol. ii.
p. 469.), we find:--

    "Si præpositus hundredi equos aut boves aut oves aut porcos
    vel cujuscumque generis averia vagancia restare fecerit," &c.

The word may naturally enough have been applied to deer reduced to the state of tame and domesticated
cattle.

    [TREBOR furnishes us with a reference to Pegge's Anonymiana,
    who endeavours to show that the proper term is "halfer;" on
    the same principle that an entire horse is spoken of, the word
    being pronounced "hâver" by those who call half "hâfe," while
    those who pronounce half with the open a say "hauver:" while
    J. Westby Gibson suggests that Havior is Evir, from the
    Latin "Eviro, Eviratus, Eviratio," but admits that he can
    give no authority for the use of Evir.]

Sir W. Hamilton (No. 14. p. 216.).--Douglas says, that this Sir W. Hamilton was not son, but
grandson and brother of the 1st and 2nd earls of Abercorn, his father having died vitâ patris.
I therefore doubt that the inscription has been miscopied. "He was," Douglas says, "resident
at Rome, on the part of the Queen Dowager;" but this could hardly be the service alluded to.

Dr. Johnson's Library (no. 14. p. 214.).--I have a copy of Dr.
Johnson's Sale Catalogue. To be viewed on Monday and
    Tuesday preceding the Sale, which will begin each Day at 12
    o'Clock. Catalogues may be had as above."

It is a Catalogue of 28 pages and 662 lots, of which 650 are books. The twelve last are prints,
chiefly "framed and glazed." The Catalogue is very rare; there is not a copy in the British
Museum, and Messrs. Christie and Manson are without one. I may add, as your correspondent is
curious about Johnson's Library, that I have the presentation copy to the Doctor of Twiss's
Travels in Spain, with "the gift of the Author" in Johnson's handwriting, immediately beneath
Twiss's MS. presentation. The Twiss was in Lot 284.

MISCELLANIES.

Etymology of "News."--The word "news" is not derived, as many suppose, from the adjective new,
but from a practice that obtained in newspapers of an early date, of prefixing to the title
the letters expressive of the cardinal points, thus:--

      N.
  E.      W.
      S.

meaning that their intelligence was derived from all quarters of the globe. This must, at any
rate, be allowed as ingenious etymology.

J.U.G. GUTCH.

THE GOLDEN AGE.

(FROM THE LATIN.)

  Why "golden," when that age alone, we're told,
  Was blest with happy ignorance of gold--
  More justly we our venal times might call
  "The Golden Age," for gold is all in all.

NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.

Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell on Monday next two collections of Autographs; the first consisting
of Autograph Letters, the property of a gentleman; which will be immediately followed by that
belonging to the late Mr. Rodd, and the extensive Correspondence of the late William Upcott,
Esq., comprising several thousand Autograph Letters. Mr. Rodd's collection comprises many letters
of great historical and literary interest.

Messrs. Puttick and Simpson will sell by auction on Friday, March the 8th, and seven following
days, the extensive and very important Stock of Books of Mr. James Carpenter, of Bond Street,
who is retiring from business. The characteristics of this fine collection are the numerous
books of prints and illustrated works which it contains, such as the matchless Series of Piranesi's
Works, being the dedication copy to the king of Sweden: a copy of Boswell's Life of Johnson,
in 8 vols. {271} folio, illustrated with nearly six hundred Portraits and Views.

We heard some time since that the long-established and highly-respectable house of Payne and
Foss, of Pall Mall, had succeeded the late Mr. Rodd in the agency of purchasing for the British
Museum. The rumour proved to be unfounded, and now receives a formal contradiction by the announcement
that Messrs. Payne and Foss are retiring from business, and that the first portion of their
extensive and valuable Stock of Books will be sold by auction by Messrs. Sotheby and Co.; the
first division in a ten days' sale, commencing on the 18th and terminating on the 28th March;
which will be followed by the second division, which will also occupy ten days, and commence
on Monday the 8th April. The lovers of choice copies of fine editions of first-class books
will have, on this occasion, such an opportunity of enriching their collections as rarely presents
itself.

X.P. is informed that the monotome edition of Boswell's Johnson edited by Croker, is not an
abridgment of the larger work, but a new and thoroughly revised edition of it; and with a really
good index. P. 242. col. 2. l. 11., for "coheir" read "cognate;" and line 16, for "Argidius"
"Ægidius;" and p. 243, col 1. l. 35. read "anecdote of Dionysius related by Cicero and by Plutarch,
in his Laconic Apophthegms, which Stobæus evidently followed."

PINACOTHECÆ HISTORICÆ SPECIMEN; sive Illustrium Quorundam Ingenia, Mores, Fortunæ, ad Inscriptionum

    "The production of an English clergyman, and bears unequivocal
    marks of refined taste, elegant scholarship, and a
    liberal, generous, and candid mind. The idea--to us a novel
    one--carried out in this work is, to bring up for judgment
    (as the Egyptians used to do with their departed kings) the
    characters that figure most in the page of history, and to
    pass sentence upon them. Summoning them, as it were, into his
    presence with the lamp of history to guide him, exquiritque
    auditque dolos; and whether it be praise or blame, or a
    mixture of both, that he awards, the judgment is pronounced in
    a temperate spirit, and with judicial impartiality; and it
    is expressed in pure and elegant Latin, and often with
    epigrammatic felicity."--Scotsman.
