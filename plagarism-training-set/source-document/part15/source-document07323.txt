THE SLAVE OF SILENCE

CHAPTER I

The girl turned away from the splendour of it and laid her aching head against the cool windowpane.
A hansom flashed along in the street below with just a glimpse of a pretty laughing girl in
it with a man by her side. From another part of the Royal Palace Hotel came sounds of mirth
and gaiety. All the world seemed to be happy, to-night, perhaps to mock the misery of the girl
with her head against the windowpane.

And yet on the face of it, Beatrice Darryll's lines seemed to have fallen in pleasant places.
She was young and healthy, and, in the eyes of her friends, beautiful. Still, the startling
pallor of her face was in vivid contrast with the dead black dress she wore, a dress against
which her white arms and throat stood out like ivory on a back-ground of ebony and silver.
There was no colour about the girl at all, save for the warm, ripe tone of her hair and the
deep, steadfast blue of her eyes. Though her face was cold and scornful, she would not have
given the spectator the impression of coldness, only utter weariness and a tiredness of life
at the early age of twenty-two.

Behind her was a table laid out for a score of dinner guests. Everything was absolutely perfect
and exceedingly costly, as appertained to all things at the Royal Palace Hotel, where the head
waiter condescended to bow to nothing under a millionaire. The table decorations were red in
tone, there were red shades to the low electric lights, and masses of red carnations everywhere.
No taste, and incidentally no expense had been spared, for Beatrice Darryll was to be married
on the morrow, and her father, Sir Charles, was giving this dinner in honour of the occasion.
Only a very rich man could afford a luxury like that.

"I think everything is complete, madame," a waiter suggested softly. "If there is anything----"

Beatrice turned wearily from the window. She looked old and odd and drawn just for the moment.
And yet that face could ripple with delighted smiles, the little red mouth was made for laughter.
Beatrice's eyes swept over the wealth of good taste and criminal extravagance.

"It will do very nicely," the girl said. "It will do--anything will do. I mean you have done
your work splendidly. I am more than satisfied."

The gratified, if slightly puzzled, waiter bowed himself out. The bitter scorn in Beatrice's
eyes deepened. What did all this reckless extravagance mean? Why was it justified? The man
who might have answered the question sauntered into the room. A wonderfully well-preserved
man was Sir Charles Darryll, with a boyish smile and an air of perennial youth unspotted by
the world, a man who was totally unfitted to cope with the hard grip and sordid side of life.
There were some who said that he was a grasping, greedy, selfish old rascal, who under the
guise of youthful integrity concealed a nature that was harsh and cruel.

"Well, my dear child," Sir Charles cried. "And are you not satisfied? That table-setting is
perfect; I never saw anything in more exquisite taste."

"It will all have to be paid for," Beatrice said wearily. "The money----"

"Will be forthcoming. I have no doubt of it. Whether I have it at the bank or not I cannot
for the moment say. If not, then our good friend Stephen Richford must lend it me. My dear
child, that black dress of yours gives me quite a painful shock. Why wear it?"

Beatrice crossed over and regarded her pale reflection in the glass opposite. The little pink
nails were dug fiercely into the still pinker flesh of her palm.

"Why not?" she asked. "Is it not appropriate? Am I not in the deepest mourning for my lost
honour? To-morrow I am going to marry a man who from the bottom of my heart I loathe and despise.
I am going to sell myself to him for money--money to save your good name. Oh, I know that I
shall have the benediction of the church, less fortunate girls will envy me; but I am not a
whit better than the poor creature flaunting her shame on the pavement. Nay, I am worse, for
she can plead that love was the cause of her undoing. Father, I can't, can't go through with it."

She flung herself down in a chair and covered her face with her hands. The boyish innocence
of Sir Charles's face changed suddenly, a wicked gleam came into his eyes. His friends would
have found a difficulty in recognizing him then.

"Get up," he said sternly. "Get up and come to the window with me. Now, what do you see in
this room?"

"Evidences of wealth that is glittering here," Beatrice cried. "Shameless extravagance that
you can never hope to pay for. Costly flowers----"

"And everything that makes life worth living. All these things are necessary to me. They will
be with me till the end if you marry Stephen Richford. Now look outside. Do you see those two
men elaborately doing nothing by the railings opposite. You do? Well, they are watching me.
They have been dogging me for three days. And if anything happened now, a sudden illness on
your part, anything to postpone to-morrow's ceremony, I should pass the next day in jail. You
did not think it was as bad as that, did you?"
