THE STORY OF KENNETT

BY

BAYARD TAYLOR

PROLOGUE.

TO MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS OF KENNETT:

I wish to dedicate this Story to you, not only because some of you inhabit the very houses,
and till the very fields which I have given to the actors in it, but also because many of you
will recognize certain of the latter, and are therefore able to judge whether they are drawn
with the simple truth at which I have aimed. You are, naturally, the critics whom I have most
cause to fear; but I do not inscribe these pages to you with the design of purchasing your
favor. I beg you all to accept the fact as an acknowledgment of the many quiet and happy years
I have spent among you; of the genial and pleasant relations into which I was born, and which
have never diminished, even when I have returned to you from the farthest ends of the earth;
and of the use (often unconsciously to you, I confess,) which I have drawn from your memories
of former days, your habits of thought and of life.

I am aware that truth and fiction are so carefully woven together in this Story of Kennett,
that you will sometimes be at a loss to disentangle them. The lovely pastoral landscapes which
I know by heart, have been copied, field for field and tree for tree, and these you will immediately
recognize. Many of you will have no difficulty in detecting the originals of Sandy Flash and
Deb. Smith; a few will remember the noble horse which performed the service I have ascribed
to Roger; and the descendants of a certain family will not have forgotten some of the pranks
of Joe and Jake Fairthorn. Many more than these particulars are drawn from actual sources;
but as I have employed them with a strict regard to the purposes of the Story, transferring
dates and characters at my pleasure, you will often, I doubt not, attribute to invention that
which I owe to family tradition. Herein, I must request that you will allow me to keep my own
counsel; for the processes which led to the completed work extend through many previous years,
and cannot readily be revealed. I will only say that every custom I have described is true
to the time, though some of them are now obsolete; that I have used no peculiar word or phrase
of the common dialect of the country which I have not myself heard; and further, that I owe
the chief incidents of the last chapter, given to me on her death-bed, to the dear and noble
woman whose character (not the circumstances of her life) I have endeavored to reproduce in
that of Martha Deane.

The country life of our part of Pennsylvania retains more elements of its English origin than
that of New England or Virginia. Until within a few years, the conservative influence of the
Quakers was so powerful that it continued to shape the habits even of communities whose religious
sentiment it failed to reach. Hence, whatever might be selected as incorrect of American life,
in its broader sense, in these pages, is nevertheless locally true; and to this, at least,
all of you, my Friends and Neighbors, can testify. In these days, when Fiction prefers to deal
with abnormal characters and psychological problems more or less exceptional or morbid, the
attempt to represent the elements of life in a simple, healthy, pastoral community, has been
to me a source of uninterrupted enjoyment. May you read it with half the interest I have felt
in writing it!

THE CHASE.

At noon, on the first Saturday of March, 1796, there was an unusual stir at the old Barton
farm-house, just across the creek to the eastward, as you leave Kennett Square by the Philadelphia
stage-road. Any gathering of the people at Barton's was a most rare occurrence; yet, on that
day and at that hour, whoever stood upon the porch of the corner house, in the village, could
see horsemen approaching by all the four roads which there met. Some five or six had already
dismounted at the Unicorn Tavern, and were refreshing themselves with stout glasses of "Old
Rye," while their horses, tethered side by side to the pegs in the long hitching-bar, pawed
and stamped impatiently. An eye familiar with the ways of the neighborhood might have surmised
the nature of the occasion which called so many together, from the appearance and equipment
of these horses. They were not heavy animals, with the marks of plough-collars on their broad
shoulders, or the hair worn off their rumps by huge breech-straps; but light and clean-limbed,
one or two of them showing signs of good blood, and all more carefully groomed than usual.

Evidently, there was no "vendue" at the Barton farmhouse; neither a funeral, nor a wedding,
since male guests seemed to have been exclusively bidden. To be sure, Miss Betsy Lavender had
been observed to issue from Dr. Deane's door, on the opposite side of the way, and turn into
the path beyond the blacksmith's, which led down through the wood and over the creek to Barton's;
but then, Miss Lavender was known to be handy at all times, and capable of doing all things,
from laying out a corpse to spicing a wedding-cake. Often self-invited, but always welcome,
very few social or domestic events could occur in four townships (East Marlborough, Kennett,
Pennsbury, and New-Garden) without her presence; while her knowledge of farms, families, and
genealogies extended up to Fallowfield on one side, and over to Birmingham on the other.

It was, therefore, a matter of course, whatever the present occasion might be, that Miss Lavender
put on her broad gray beaver hat, and brown stuff cloak, and took the way to Barton's. The
distance could easily be walked in five minutes, and the day was remarkably pleasant for the
season. A fortnight of warm, clear weather had extracted the last fang of frost, and there
was already green grass in the damp hollows. Bluebirds picked the last year's berries from
the cedar-trees; buds were bursting on the swamp-willows; the alders were hung with tassels,
and a powdery crimson bloom began to dust the bare twigs of the maple- trees. All these signs
of an early spring Miss Lavender noted as she picked her way down the wooded bank. Once, indeed,
she stopped, wet her forefinger with her tongue, and held it pointed in the air. There was
very little breeze, but this natural weathercock revealed from what direction it came.

"Southwest!" she said, nodding her head--"Lucky!"
