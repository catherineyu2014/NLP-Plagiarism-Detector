PREFACE

Come along, boys and girls! We are off on our rambles. But please do not ask me where we are
going. It would delay us very much if I should postpone our start until I had drawn you a map
of the route, with all the stopping-places set down.

We have far to go, and a great many things to see, and it may be that some of you will be very
tired before we get through.

If so, I shall be sorry; but it will be a comfort to think that none of us need go any farther
than we choose.

There will be considerable variety in our rambles. We shall walk about familiar places, and
we shall explore streets and houses that have been buried for centuries. We shall go down deep
into the earth, and we shall float in a balloon, high up into the air. We shall see many beasts
of the forest; some that are bloody and cruel, and others that are gentle and wise. We will
meet with birds, fishes, grand old buildings, fleas, vast woods, bugs, mummies, snakes, tight-rope
dancers, gorillas, will-o'-the-wisps, beautiful blossoms, boomerangs, oceans, birds' nests,
and I cannot tell you what all besides. We will also have some adventures, hear some stories,
and have a peep at a fairy or two before we are done.

I shall not, however, be able to go with you everywhere. When you are enjoying a "Bird Chat;"
"Buying the Mirror;" learning when "We must not Believe our Eyes;" visiting "A City under the
Ground;" hearing of "The Coachman's" troubles; sitting under "The Oak-tree;" finding out wonderful
things "About Glass;" watching what happens when "School's Out;" or following the fortunes
of "Carl," your guide will be a lady, and I think that you will all agree that she knows very
well where she ought to go, and how to get there. The rest of the time you will be with me.

And now, having talked enough, suppose we start.

WINTER IN THE WOODS
