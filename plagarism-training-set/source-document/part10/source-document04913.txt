INTRODUCTION

I eagerly avail myself of the Author's invitation to write a foreword to her book, as it gives
me an opportunity of expressing something of the admiration, of the wonder, of the intense
brotherly sympathy and affection--almost adoration--which has from time to time overwhelmed
me when witnessing the work of our women during the Great War.

They have been in situations where, five short years ago, no one would ever have thought of
finding them. They have witnessed and taken active part in scenes nerve-racking and heart-rending
beyond the power of description. Often it has been my duty to watch car-load after car-load
of severely wounded being dumped into the reception marquees of a Casualty Clearing Station.
There they would be placed in long rows awaiting their turn, and there, amid the groans of
the wounded and the loud gaspings of the gassed, at the mere approach of a sister there would
be a perceptible change and every conscious eye would brighten as with a ray of fresh hope.
In the resuscitation and moribund marquees, nothing was more pathetic than to see "Sister,"
with her notebook, stooping over some dying lad, catching his last messages to his loved ones.

Women worked amid such scenes for long hours day after day, amid scenes as no mere man could
long endure, and yet their nerves held out; it may be because they were inspired by the nature
of their work. I have seen them, too, continue that work under intermittent shelling and bombing,
repeated day after day and night after night, and it was the rarest thing to find one whose
nerves gave way. I have seen others rescue wounded from falling houses, and drive their cars
boldly into streets with bricks and debris flying.

I have also, alas! seen them grievously wounded; and on one occasion, killed, and found their
comrades continuing their work in the actual presence of their dead.

The free homes of Britain little realise what our war women have been through, or what an undischarged
debt is owing to them.

How few now realise to what a large extent they were responsible for the fighting spirit, for
the morale, for the tenacity which won the war! The feeling, the knowledge that their women
were at hand to succour and to tend them when they fell raised the fighting spirit of the men
and made them brave and confident.

The above qualities are well exemplified by the conduct and bearing of our Authoress herself,
who, when grievously injured, never lost her head or her consciousness, but through half an
hour sat quietly on the road-side beside the wreck of her car and the mangled remains of her
late companion. Rumour has it that she asked for and smoked a cigarette.

Such heroism in a young girl strongly appealed to the imagination of our French and Belgian
Allies, and two rows of medals bedeck her khaki jacket.

Other natural qualities of our race, which largely helped to win the war, are brought out very
vividly, although unconsciously, in this book, e.g. the spirit of cheerfulness; the power to
forget danger and hardship; the faculty of seeing the humorous side of things; of making the
best of things; the spirit of comradeship which sweetened life.

These qualities were nowhere more evident than among the F.A.N.Y. Their esprit-de-corps, their
gaiety, their discipline, their smartness and devotion when duty called were infectious, almost
an inspiration to those who witnessed them.

Throughout the war the "Fannys" were renowned for their resourcefulness. They were always ready
to take on any and every job, from starting up a frozen car to nursing a bad typhoid case,
and they rose to the occasion every time.

FANNY GOES TO WAR

CHAPTER I

IN CAMP BEFORE THE WAR

The First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was founded in 1910 and now numbers roughly about four hundred
voluntary members.

It was originally intended to supplement the R.A.M.C. in field work, stretcher bearing, ambulance
driving, etc.--its duties being more or less embodied in the title.

An essential point was that each member should be able to ride bareback or otherwise, as much
difficulty had been found in transporting nurses from one place to another on the veldt in
the South African War. Men had often died through lack of attention, as the country was too
rough to permit of anything but a saddle horse to pass.

The First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was on active service soon after War was declared and, though
it is not universally known, they were the pioneers of all the women's corps subsequently working
in France.

Before they had been out very long they were affectionately known as the F.A.N.Y.'s, to all
and sundry, and in an incredibly short space of time had units working with the British, French,
and Belgian Armies in the field.

It was in the Autumn of 1913 that, picking up the Mirror one day, I saw a snapshot of a girl
astride on horseback leaping a fence in a khaki uniform and topee. Underneath was merely the
line "Women Yeomanry in Camp," and nothing more. "That," said I, pointing out the photo to
a friend, "is the sort of show I'd like to belong to: I'm sick of ambling round the Row on
a Park hack. It would be a rag to go into camp with a lot of other girls. I'm going to write
to the Mirror for particulars straight away."

I did so; but got no satisfaction at all, as the note accompanying the photo had been mislaid.
However, they did inform me there was such a Corps in existence, but beyond that they could
give me no particulars.
