As previously reported to you, the Rail Committee of the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance
of Way Association is also acting for the American Railway Association; and the latter organization
has guaranteed to it the necessary funds to make exhaustive tests and observations as to the
wear, breakage, etc., etc., of steel rails. This work is being prosecuted, and will of necessity
require several years.

Your Committee feels that it has nothing to add to the several reports which it has presented
to the Society, particularly as, so far, the several cardinal principles outlined in them are
being practically followed in the several used and proposed specifications and rail sections.

In view of the foregoing, your Committee would respectfully ask to be discharged so that the
field may be clear if at any future time the Society should desire to again place the subject
in the hands of a Committee.

                                                WILLIAM R. WEBSTER.

JUNE, 1910.

                                         PHILADELPHIA, JUNE 1ST, 1910.

I have signed the Report of the A. S. C. E. Rail Committee,--"Approved in connection with the
attached report," as I feel that the report is too condensed, and assumes that all are familiar
with the Rail situation, especially what has been done by the other Societies.

The work undertaken by this Committee has been delegated by The American Railway Association
to the Rail Committee of The American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association,
and it therefore seems appropriate to give the results of their work, up to date, to our members
in convenient form for reference, especially as our rail specifications have not been worked
to, and they have offered a better specification that will be worked to, and no doubt largely
used by the members of this Society. The specification is attached to this report.

In presenting this specification to the Annual Meeting at Chicago in March last, the Committee
said:[C]

     "A new specification should not be proposed at this time without
     careful consideration. So far as we know, no railroad company has
     purchased rails under the specifications approved by the American
     Railway Association and referred to us; nor do we know of any
     railway company that has succeeded in buying rails during the past
     two years according to a specification entirely satisfactory to the
     railroad company. We believe that all of the specifications under
     which rails have been rolled have been compromises on the part of
     both parties, with the general result that neither party is
     entirely satisfied. Our experience during the year has brought to
     our attention some defects in all of the specifications now before
     us, and acting under the impression that there is a distinct
     feeling that we should revise our specifications, we offer the
     attached specifications for your consideration. Our Association has
     no specification for Open-Hearth Steel Rails, and in order to
     comply with the instructions, a specification for Open-Hearth Steel
     Rails is included.

     "We believe it necessary to submit a sliding scale for the
     percentages of carbon and phosphorus, which provides for increasing
     the carbon as the phosphorus decreases. The fixing of this scale
     properly is a matter requiring care, and we admit that our
     knowledge on the subject is limited. The American Railway
     Association specification calls attention to this matter in the
     following words: 'When lower phosphorus can be secured, a proper
     proportionate increase in carbon should be made.' The amount of
     increase is not provided for in the specifications, and this
     appears to us to be necessary in order to secure uniformity of
     practice; otherwise, the fixing of these percentages becomes a
     matter of special arrangement. Bessemer rails are being furnished
     regularly with phosphorus under the maximum allowed, and where this
     is done, the carbon should be raised above the higher limit now
     fixed in our specifications, or a soft and poor wearing rail will
     result; yet this condition has not been fully guarded against in
     rails furnished under existing specifications. The lower and upper
     limits for carbon have heretofore been fixed with the intention
     that the mills furnish rails with a composition as near between the
     two limits as possible. The mills, however, in order to meet the
     prescribed drop tests with the least difficulty, keep both the
     carbon and manganese as nearly as possible to the lower limits,
     with the corresponding result that a generally poor-wearing rail is
     furnished.

     "Some roads have prescribed the limits of deflection to be allowed
     under the drop test. With our present knowledge, we believe that we
     should fix a minimum deflection to eliminate brittle rails and to
     secure greater uniformity of product; also maximum deflection to
     eliminate soft rails. We are not able at the present time to fix
     these limits, but our ultimate object will be to determine and fix
     such limits for the specifications.

     "With reference to the amount of discard, time of holding in ladle,
     size of nozzles, and other such details of manufacture or
     machinery, we are of the opinion that the physical and chemical
     tests required should be prescribed, and that we should see that
     the material submitted for acceptance meets the prescribed tests.
     We should not dictate to the manufacturers the amount of crop which
     shall be removed from the top of the ingot, as this should vary
     with the care and time consumed at the various mills. The railroads
     should not be asked to take anything but sound material in their
     rails. The mills can furnish such sound material if the proper care
     and sufficient time are taken in the making of the ingots.
     Information derived from the tests being made at the Watertown
     Arsenal shows definitely that sound rails cannot be made from
     unsound ingots, and that, therefore, the prime requisite in
     securing a sound rail is to first secure the sound ingot.

     "We recommend that the present Specifications for Steel Rails be
     withdrawn from the Manual of Recommended Practice of the
     Association, as no longer representing the current state of the
     art.

     "We submit herewith, as Appendix 'A,' a form for specifications. It
     will have to be amended from time to time as we receive further
     information on the subject."

The specifications referred to above were modified and presented at the Meeting in Supplement
to Bulletin No. 121, of March, 1910, and in this final form are attached hereto.

These specifications do not represent the work of any one Society or the work of any one Committee,
but are the result of all the work of the different Societies, as the members of all are so
interwoven that whatever work is done in any one Society, or by the Committee of a Society,
has very naturally and fortunately been carried into the others.

At the Chicago Meeting these specifications were accepted without a single change, and this
is very unusual and shows how generally acceptable they were, as the members of all Rail Committees
were present at the Meeting. The main points in this specification were discussed and agreed
upon by the members of the Committee and the Rail Committee of the manufacturers who have co-operated
with them in this work.

In the matter of Rail Sections, the Rail Committee of The American Railway Engineering and
Maintenance of Way Association has not arrived at any definite conclusions. The new sections
"A" and "B" of The American Railway Association have not given as good results as was expected
of them, and the whole matter is yet under consideration. The Committee reported as follows:[D]

     "The instructions of the American Railway Association require us to
     study the A. R. A. sections 'A' and 'B' in use and submit a single
     type for standard. Owing to the conditions existing in 1908, very
     little rail was laid, and practically none of the A. R. A.
     sections, in such manner as to give the needed information. This
     year, several roads have laid A. R. A. sections of rail, with a
     view of determining the relative merits of the respective sections.
     These rails have been in the track so short a time that we are not
     justified in drawing any conclusions as to which of the A. R. A.
     types, 'A' or 'B,' or if either, is better than the A. S. C. E.
     sections.

     "Bulletin No. 116, issued October, 1909, gives the statistics for
     rail failures for six months from October 31, 1908, to April 30,
     1909, as reported to the Committee. These statistics do show that
     the difference in section can be entirely annihilated by difference
     in chemical composition and by the treatment in furnace and mill.

     "The results so far obtained from the heavy base A. R. A. sections
     are disappointing, as we have received some rail from the mills of
     the new section which was as bad as we did with the old
     A. S. C. E. section, showing that the quality of the rail does not
     depend entirely upon the section.

     "The tests to be inaugurated by the Committee, combined with the
     results of the tests at Watertown and the performance of the rail
     in the track, will give us valuable data to aid us in coming to a
     final conclusion."

A careful study of the results already obtained, on both Bessemer and open-hearth steel rails,
indicates that the next necessary step will be the use of a much heavier rail, and I think
the sooner this is admitted and trial lots of say 1,000 tons each of 110-lb., 120-lb. and 130-lb.
rails rolled, of Bessemer and open-hearth steel, and put in service under the most severe conditions,
the sooner we will get rid of the present difficulties with our rails.

    "3. When the average phosphorus content of the ingot metal used in
    the Bessemer Process at any mill is below 0.08 and in the
    Open-Hearth Process is below 0.03, the carbon shall be increased at

    ingot metal used averages below 0.08 for Bessemer steel, or 0.03 for
    Open-Hearth steel.

    "The percentage of carbon in an entire order of rails shall average
    as high as the mean percentage between the upper and lower limits.

[Sidenote: Shearing.]

    "4. The end of the bloom formed from the top of the ingot shall be
    sheared until the entire face shows sound metal.

    "All metal from the top of the ingot, whether made from the bloom or
    the rail, is the top discard.

[Sidenote: Shrink]

    "5. The number of passes and speed of train shall be so regulated
    that, on leaving the rolls at the final pass, the temperature of the
    rails will not exceed that which requires a shrinkage allowance at
    the hot saws, for a 33-ft. rail of 100 lb. section, of 6-1/2 in. for
    thick base sections and 6-3/4 in. for A. S. CC. E. sections, and 1/8
    in. less for each ten pounds decrease of section, these allowances
    to be decreased at the rate of 1-100 in. for each second of time
    elapsed between the rail leaving the finishing rolls and being
    sawed.

    "The bars shall not be held for the purpose of reducing their
    temperature, nor shall any artificial means of cooling them be used
    between the leading and finishing passes, nor after they leave the
    finishing pass.

[Sidenote: Section]

    "6. The section of rail shall conform as accurately as possible to
    the templet furnished by the Railroad Company. A variation in height
    of 1-64 in. less or 1-32 in. greater than the specified height, and
    1-16 in. in width of flange, will be permitted; but no variations
    shall be allowed in the dimensions affecting the fit of splice bars.

[Sidenote: Weight]

    "7. The weight of the rail shall be maintained as nearly as
    possible, after complying with the preceding paragraph, to that
    specified in the contract.

    "A variation of one-half of one per cent. from the calculated weight
    of section, as applied to an entire order, will be allowed.

    "Rails will be accepted and paid for according to actual weight.

[Sidenote: Length]

    "8. The standard length of rail shall be 33 ft.

    "Ten per cent. of the entire order will be accepted in shorter
    lengths varying by 1 ft. from 32 ft. to 25 ft.

    "A variation of 1/4 in. from the specified lengths will be allowed.

    "All No. 1 rails less than 33 ft. shall be painted green on both
    ends.

[Sidenote: Finishing]

    "9. Care shall be taken in hot-straightening rails, and it shall
    result in their being left in such condition that they will not vary
    throughout their entire length more than four (4) in. from a
    straight line in any direction for thick base sections, and 5 in.
    for A. S. C. E. sections when delivered to the cold-straightening
    presses. Those which vary beyond that amount, or have short kinks,
    shall be classed as second quality rails and be so marked.

    "The distance between supports of rails in the straightening press
    shall not be less than forty-two (42) in.; supports to have flat
    surfaces and out of wind. Rails shall be straight in line and
    surface and smooth on head when finished, final straightening being
    done while cold.

    "They shall be sawed square at ends, variations to be not more than
    1-32 in., and prior to shipment shall have the burr caused by the
    saw cutting removed and the ends made clean.

[Sidenote: Drilling]

    "10. Circular holes for joint bolts shall be drilled in accordance
    with specifications of the purchaser. They shall in every respect
    conform accurately to drawing and dimensions furnished and shall be
    free from burrs.

[Sidenote: Branding]

    "11. The name of the manufacturer, the weight of the rail, and the
    month and year of manufacture shall be rolled in raised letters and
    figures on the side of the web. The number of the heat and a letter
    indicating the portion of the ingot from which the rail was made
    shall be plainly stamped on the web of each rail, where it will not
    be covered by the splice bars. Rails to be lettered consecutively A,
    B, C, etc., the rail from the top of the ingot being A. In case of a
    top discard of twenty or more per cent. the letter A will be
    omitted. Open-Hearth rails to be branded or stamped O. H. All
    marking of rails shall be done so effectively that the marks may be
    read as long as the rails are in service.

[Sidenote: Drop testing.]

    "12. (a) Drop tests shall be made on pieces of rail rolled from
    the top of the ingot, not less than four (4) ft. and not more than
    six (6) ft. long, from each heat of steel. These test pieces shall
    be cut from the rail bar next to either end of the top rail, as
    selected by the Inspector.

    "The temperature of the test pieces shall be between forty (40) and
    one hundred (100) degrees Fahrenheit.

    "The test pieces shall be placed head upward on solid supports, five
    (5) in. top radius, three (3) ft. between centers, and subjected to
    impact tests, the tup falling free from the following heights:

    70 lb. rail                16 ft.
    80, 85 and 90 lb. rail     18 ft.
    100 lb. rail               20 ft.

    "The test pieces which do not break under the first drop shall be
    nicked and tested to destruction.

    "(b) (It is proposed to prescribe, under this paragraph, the
    requirements in regard to deflection, fixing maximum and minimum
    limits, as soon as proper deflection limits have been decided upon.)

[Sidenote: Tests.]

    "13. (A) Two pieces shall be tested from each heat of steel. If
    either of these test pieces breaks, a third piece shall be tested.
    If two of the test pieces break without showing physical defect, all
    rails of the heat will be rejected absolutely. If two of the test
    pieces do not break, all rails of the heat will be accepted as No. 1
    or No. 2 classification (according as the deflection is less or
    more, respectively, than the prescribed limit[A]).

    "(B) If, however, any test piece broken under test A shows physical
    defect, the top rail from each ingot of that heat shall be rejected.

    "(C) Additional tests shall then be made of test pieces selected by
    the Inspector from the top end of any second rails of the same heat.
    If two out of three of these second test pieces break, the remainder
    of the rails of the heat will also be rejected.

[Sidenote: Drop testing machine.]

    "14. The drop-testing machine shall be the standard of the American
    Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association, and have a
    tup of 2,000 lbs. weight, the striking face of which shall have a
    radius of five (5) in.

    "The anvil block shall be adequately supported and shall weigh
    20,000 lbs.

    "The supports shall be a part of or firmly secured to the anvil.

[Sidenote: No. 1 Rails.]

    "15. No. 1 rails shall be free from injurious defects and flaws of
    all kinds.

[Sidenote: No. 2 Rails.]

    "16. Rails which, by reason of surface imperfections, are not
    accepted as No. 1 rails, will be classed as No. 2 rails, but rails
    containing physical defects which impair their strength, shall be
    rejected.

    "No. 2 rails to the extent of five (5) per cent. of the whole order
    will be received. All rails accepted as No. 2 rails shall have the
    ends painted white, and shall have two prick punch marks on the side
    of the web near the heat number near the end of the rail, so placed
    as not to be covered by the splice bars.

    "Rails improperly drilled, straightened, or from which the burrs
    have not been properly removed, shall be rejected, but may be
    accepted after being properly finished.

    "Different classes of rails shall be kept separate in shipment.

    "All rails shall be loaded in the presence of the inspector.

[Sidenote: Inspection.]

    "17. (a) Inspectors representing the purchaser shall have free
    entry to the works of the Manufacturer at all times while the
    contract is being executed, and shall have all reasonable facilities
    afforded them by the Manufacturer to satisfy them that the rails
    have been made in accordance with the terms of the specifications.

    "(b) For Bessemer Steel the Manufacturer shall, before the rails
    are shipped, furnish the Inspector daily with carbon determinations
    for each heat, and two complete chemical analyses every twenty-four
    hours representing the average of the other elements specified in
    section 2 hereof contained in the steel, for each day and night turn
    respectively. These analyses shall be made on drillings taken from
    the ladle test ingot not less than 1/4 in. beneath the surface.

    "For Open-Hearth Steel, the makers shall furnish the Inspectors with
    a complete chemical analysis of the elements specified in section 2
    hereof for each melt.

    "(c) On request of the Inspector, the Manufacturer shall furnish
    drillings from the test ingot for check analysis.

    "(d) All tests and inspections shall be made at the place of
    manufacture, prior to shipment, and shall be so conducted as not to
    unnecessarily interfere with the operation of the mill."
