CHAPTER VIII.

THE IRISH REBELLION.

[Sidenote: The vision of the Holy Brigitta.]

"The Pander[277] sheweth, in the first chapter of his book, called Salus Populi, that the holy
woman, Brigitta, used to inquire of her good angel many questions of secrets divine; and among
all other she inquired, 'Of what Christian land was most souls damned?' The angel shewed her
a land in the west part of the world. She inquired the cause why? The angel said, for there
is most continual war, root of hate and envy, and of vices contrary to charity; and without
charity the souls cannot be saved. And the angel did shew to her the lapse of the souls of
Christian folk of that land, how they fell down into hell, as thick as any hail showers. And
pity thereof moved the Pander to conceive his said book, as in the said chapter plainly doth
appear; for after his opinion, this [Ireland] is the land that the angel understood; for there
is no land in this world of so continual war within itself; ne of so great shedding of Christian
blood; ne of so great robbing, spoiling, preying, and burning; ne of so great wrongful extortion
continually, as Ireland. Wherefore it cannot be denied by very estimation of man but that the
angel did understand the land of Ireland."[278]

Nine hundred years had passed away since the vision of the Holy Brigitta, and four hundred
since the custody of the unfortunate country had been undertaken by the most orderly nation
in the world; yet, at the close of all those centuries, "it could not be denied by very estimation
of man" that poor Irish souls were still descending, thick as hail showers, into the general
abyss of worthlessness. The Pander's satire upon the English enterprise was a heavy one.

[Sidenote: Rapid success of the first invasion of Ireland.]

[Sidenote: The character of the country.]

[Sidenote: The settlement of it under the Norman leaders.]

When the wave of the Norman invasion first rolled across St. George's Channel, the success
was as easy and appeared as complete as William's conquest of the Saxons. There was no unity
of purpose among the Irish chieftains, no national spirit which could support a sustained resistance.
The country was open and undefended,[279] and after a few feeble struggles the contest ceased.
Ireland is a basin, the centre a fertile undulating plain, the edges a fringe of mountains
that form an almost unbroken coast line. Into these highlands the Irish tribes were driven,
where they were allowed to retain a partial independence, under condition of paying tribute;
the Norman immigrants dividing among themselves the inheritance of the dispossessed inhabitants.[280]
Strongbow and his companions became the feudal sovereigns of the island, holding their estates
under the English crown. The common law of England was introduced; the king's writ passed current
from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear;[281] and if the leading Norman families had remained
on the estates which they had conquered, or if those who did remain had retained the character
which they brought with them, the entire country would, in all likelihood, have settled down
obediently, and at length willingly, under a rule which it would have been without power to resist.

[Sidenote: Two causes of the decline of their authority.]

[Sidenote: Absenteeism.]

An expectation so natural was defeated by two causes, alike unforeseen and perplexing. The
Northern nations, when they overran the Roman Empire, were in search of homes; and they subdued
only to colonize. The feudal system bound the noble to the lands which he possessed; and a
theory of ownership of estates, as consisting merely in the receipt of rents from other occupants,
was alike unheard of in fact, and repugnant to the principles of feudal society. To Ireland
belongs, among its other misfortunes, the credit of having first given birth to absentees.
The descendants of the first invaders preferred to regard their inheritance, not as a theatre
of duty on which they were to reside, but as a possession which they might farm for their individual
advantage. They managed their properties by agents, as sources of revenue, leasing them even
among the Irish themselves; and the tenantry, deprived of the supporting presence of their
lords, and governed only in a merely mercenary spirit, transferred back their allegiance to
the exiled chiefs of the old race.[282] This was one grave cause of the English failure, but
serious as it was, it would not have sufficed alone to explain the full extent of the evil.
Some most powerful families rooted themselves in the soil, and never forsook it; the Geraldines,
of Munster and Kildare; the Butlers, of Kilkenny; the De Burghs, the Birminghams, the De Courcies,
and many others. If these had been united among themselves, or had retained their allegiance
to England, their influence could not have been long opposed successfully. Their several principalities
would have formed separate centres of civilization; and the strong system of order would have
absorbed and superseded the most obstinate resistance which could have been offered by the
scattered anarchy of the Celts.

[Sidenote: The assimilation of the Norman Irish to the native Celts.]

[Sidenote: Efforts of the government to repress the growing evil.]

[Sidenote: Fresh colonists from England follow in the same course.]

Unfortunately, the materials of good were converted into the worst instruments of evil. If
an objection had been raised to the colonization of America, or to the conquest of India, on
the ground that the character of Englishmen would be too weak to contend successfully against
that of the races with whom they would be brought into contact, and that they would relapse
into barbarism, such an alarm would have seemed too preposterous to be entertained; yet, prior
to experience, it would have been equally reasonable to expect that the modern Englishman would
adopt the habits of the Hindoo or the Mohican, as that the fiery knights of Normandy would
have stooped to imitate a race whom they despised as slaves; that they would have flung away
their very knightly names to assume a barbarous equivalent;[283] and would so utterly have
cast aside the commanding features of their Northern extraction, that their children's children
could be distinguished neither in soul nor body, neither in look, in dress, in language, nor
in disposition, from the Celts whom they had subdued. Such, however, was the extraordinary
fact. The Irish who had been conquered in the field revenged their defeat on the minds and
hearts of their conquerors; and in yielding, yielded only to fling over their new masters the
subtle spell of the Celtic disposition. In vain the government attempted to stem the evil.
Statute was passed after statute forbidding the "Englishry" of Ireland to use the Irish language,
or intermarry with Irish families, or copy Irish habits.[284] Penalties were multiplied on
penalties; fines, forfeitures, and at last death itself, were threatened for such offences.
But all in vain. The stealthy evil crept on irresistibly.[285] Fresh colonists were sent over
to restore the system, but only for themselves or their children to be swept into the stream;
and from the century which succeeded the Conquest till the reign of the eighth Henry, the strange
phenomenon repeated itself, generation after generation, baffling the wisdom of statesmen,
and paralysing every effort at a remedy.

[Sidenote: Despair of English statesmen.]

[Sidenote: The herbs did never grow which could cure the evils of Ireland.]

[Sidenote: Causes of the corruption.]

Here was a difficulty which no skill could contend against, and which was increased by the
exertions which were made to oppose it. The healthy elements which were introduced to leaven
the old became themselves infected, and swelled the mass of evil; and the clearest observers
were those who were most disposed to despair. Popery has been the scapegoat which, for the
last three centuries, has borne the reproach of Ireland; but before popery had ceased to be
the faith of the world, the problem had long presented itself in all its hopelessness. "Some
say" (this is the language of 1515), "and for the most part every man, that to find the antidotum
for this disease is impossible--for what remedy can be had now more than hath been had unto
this time? And there was never remedy found in this two hundred year that could prosper; and
no medicine can be had now for this infirmity but such as hath been had afore this time. And
folk were as wise that time as they be now; and since they could never find remedy, how should
remedy be found by us? And the Pander maketh answer and saith, that it is no marvel that our
fathers that were of more wit and wisdom than we, could not find remedy in the premises, for
the herbs did never grow. And also he saith that the wealth and prosperity of every land is
the commonwealth of the same, and not the private wealth; and all the English noble folk of
this land passeth always their private weal; and in regard thereof setteth little or nought
by the common weal; insomuch as there is no common folk in all this world so little set by,
so greatly despised, so feeble, so poor, so greatly trodden under foot, as the king's poor
common folk be of Ireland."[286] There was no true care for the common weal--that was the especial
peculiarity by which the higher classes in Ireland were unfortunately distinguished. In England,
the last consideration of a noble-minded man was his personal advantage; Ireland was a theatre
for a universal scramble of selfishness, and the invaders caught the national contagion, and
became, as the phrase went, ipsis Hibernis Hiberniores.

[Sidenote: The outward circumstances of the chiefs.]

[Sidenote: Inability of the English princes to maintain a standing army.]

[Sidenote: Spasmodic character of their administration.]

The explanation of this disastrous phenomenon lay partly in the circumstances in which they
were placed, partly in the inherent tendencies of human nature itself. The Norman nobles entered
Ireland as independent adventurers, who, each for himself, carved out his fortune with his
sword; and, unsupported as they were from home, or supported only at precarious intervals,
divided from one another by large tracts of country, and surrounded by Irish dependents, it
was doubtless more convenient for them to govern by humouring the habits and traditions to
which their vassals would most readily submit. The English government, occupied with Scotland
and France, had no leisure to maintain a powerful central authority; and a central disciplinarian
rule enforced by the sword was contrary to the genius of the age. Under the feudal system,
the kings governed only by the consent and with the support of the nobility; and the maintenance
at Dublin of a standing military force would have been regarded with extreme suspicion in England,
as well as in Ireland. Hence the affairs of both countries were, for the most part, administered
under the same forms, forms which were as ill suited to the waywardness of the Celt, as they
met exactly the stronger nature of the Saxon. At intervals, when the government was exasperated
by unusual outrages, some prince of the blood was sent across as viceroy; and half a century
of acquiescence in disorder would be followed by a spasmodic severity, which irritated without
subduing, and forfeited affection, while it failed to terrify. At all other times, Ireland
was governed by the Norman Irish, and these, as the years went on, were tempted by their convenience
to strengthen themselves by Irish alliances, to identify their interests with those of the
native chiefs, in order to conciliate their support; to prefer the position of wild and independent
sovereigns, resting on the attachment of a people whose affections they had gained by learning
to resemble them, to that of military lords over a hostile population, the representatives
of a distant authority, on which they could not rely.

[Sidenote: Peculiar feature of the Irish temper.]

[Sidenote: It possesses the counterfeit of every virtue.]

[Sidenote: Their peculiar charm.]

[Sidenote: The foster-nurses and the minstrels.]

This is a partial account of the Irish difficulty. We must look deeper, however, for the full
interpretation of it; and outward circumstances never alone suffice to explain a moral transformation.
The Roman military colonists remained Roman alike on the Rhine and on the Euphrates. The Turkish
conquerors caught no infection from Greece, or from the provinces on the Danube. The Celts
in England were absorbed by the Saxon invaders; and the Mogul and the Anglo-Indian alike have
shown no tendency to assimilate with the Hindoo. When a marked type of human character yields
before another, the change is owing to some element of power in that other, which coming in
contact with elements weaker than itself, subdues and absorbs them. The Irish spirit, which
exercised so fatal a fascination, was enabled to triumph over the Norman in virtue of representing
certain perennial tendencies of humanity, which are latent in all mankind, and which opportunity
may at any moment develope. It was not a national spirit--the clans were never united, except
by some common hatred; and the normal relation of the chiefs towards each other was a relation
of chronic war and hostility. It was rather an impatience of control, a deliberate preference
for disorder, a determination in each individual man to go his own way, whether it was a good
way or a bad, and a reckless hatred of industry. The result was the inevitable one--oppression,
misery, and wrong. But in detail faults and graces were so interwoven, that the offensiveness
of the evil was disguised by the charm of the good; and even the Irish vices were the counterfeit
of virtues, contrived so cunningly that it was hard to distinguish their true texture. The
fidelity of the clansmen to their leaders was faultlessly beautiful; extravagance appeared
like generosity, and improvidence like unselfishness; anarchy disguised itself under the name
of liberty; and war and plunder were decorated by poetry as the honourable occupation of heroic
natures. Such were the Irish with whom the Norman conquerors found themselves in contact; and
over them all was thrown a peculiar imaginative grace, a careless atmosphere of humour, sometimes
gay, sometimes melancholy, always attractive, which at once disarmed the hand which was raised
to strike or punish them. These spirits were dangerous neighbours. Men who first entered the
country at mature age might be fortified by experience against their influence, but on the
young they must have exerted a charm of fatal potency. The foster-nurse first chanted the spell
over the cradle in wild passionate melodies.[287] It was breathed in the ears of the growing
boy by the minstrels who haunted the halls,[288] and the lawless attractions of disorder proved
too strong for the manhood which was trained among so perilous associations.

[Sidenote: A military despotism the only government which could have succeeded.]

[Sidenote: The English statesmen see the necessity, but cannot act upon it.]

[Sidenote: The island all but completely Irish in the 16th century.]

For such a country, therefore, but one form of government could succeed--an efficient military
despotism. The people could be wholesomely controlled only by an English deputy, sustained
by an English army, and armed with arbitrary power, till the inveterate turbulence of their
tempers had died away under repression, and they had learnt in their improved condition the
value of order and rule. This was the opinion of all statesmen who possessed any real knowledge
of Ireland, from Lord Talbot under Henry VI. to the latest viceroy who attempted a milder method
and found it fail. "If the king were as wise as Solomon the Sage," said the report of 1515,
"he shall never subdue the wild Irish to his obedience without dread of the sword and of the
might and strength of his power. As long as they may resist and save their lives, they will
not obey the king."[289] Unfortunately, although English statesmen were able to see the course
which ought to be followed, it had been too inconvenient to pursue that course. They had put
off the evil day, preferring to close their eyes against the mischief instead of grappling
with it resolutely; and thus, at the opening of the sixteenth century, when the hitherto neglected
barbarians were about to become a sword in the pope's hands to fight the battle against the
Reformation, the "king's Irish enemies" had recovered all but absolute possession of the island,
and nothing remained of Strongbow's conquests save the shadow of a titular sovereignty, and
a country strengthened in hostility by the means which had been used to subdue it.

[Sidenote: Division of the country.]

[Sidenote: The English pale.]

The events on which we are about to enter require for their understanding a sketch of the position
of the various chiefs, as they were at this time scattered over the island. The English pale,
originally comprising "the four shires," as they were called, of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, and
Uriel, or Louth, had been shorn down to half its old dimensions. The line extended from Dundalk
to Ardee; from Ardee by Castletown to Kells; thence through Athboy and Trim to the Castle of
Maynooth; from Maynooth it crossed to Claine upon the Liffey, and then followed up the line
of the river to Ballimore Eustace, from which place it skirted back at the rear of the Wicklow
and Dublin mountains to the forts at Dalkey, seven miles south of Dublin.[290] This narrow
strip alone, some fifty miles long and twenty broad, was in any sense English. Beyond the borders
the common law of England was of no authority; the king's writ was but a strip of parchment;
and the country was parcelled among a multitude of independent chiefs, who acknowledged no
sovereignty but that of strength, who levied tribute on the inhabitants of the pale as a reward
for a nominal protection of their rights, and as a compensation for abstaining from the plunder
of their farms.[291] Their swords were their sceptres; their codes of right, the Brehon traditions,--a
convenient system, which was called law, but which in practice was a happy contrivance for
the composition of felonies.[292]

[Sidenote: Ireland beyond the pale absolutely governed by the Irish chiefs. Their distribution.]

These chiefs, with their dependent clans, were distributed over the four provinces in the following
order. The Geraldines, the most powerful of the remaining Normans, were divided into two branches.
The Geraldines of the south, under the Earls of Desmond, held Limerick, Cork, and Kerry; the
Geraldines of Leinster lay along the frontiers of the English pale; and the heads of the house,
the Earls of Kildare, were the feudal superiors of the greater portion of the English counties.
To the Butlers, Earls of Ormond and Ossory, belonged Kilkenny, Carlow, and Tipperary. The De
Burghs, or Bourkes, as they called themselves, were scattered over Galway, Roscommon, and the
south of Sligo, occupying the broad plains which lie between the Shannon and the mountains
of Connemara and Mayo. This was the relative position into which these clans had settled at
the Conquest, and it had been maintained with little variation.

[Sidenote: Recovery of the indigenous Irish.]

The north, which had fallen to the Lacies and the De Courcies, had been wholly recovered by
the Irish. The Lacies had become extinct. The De Courcies, once Earls of Ulster, had migrated
to the south, and were reduced to the petty fief of Kinsale, which they held under the Desmonds.
The Celtic chieftains had returned from the mountains to which they had been driven, bringing
back with them, more intensely than ever, the Irish habits and traditions. Old men, who were
alive in 1533, remembered a time when the Norman families attempted to live in something of
an English manner,[293] and when there were towns in the middle of Ireland with decent municipal
institutions. The wars of the Roses had destroyed the remnants of English influence by calling
away a number of leading nobles, such especially as were least infected by the Irish character;
and the native chiefs had reoccupied the lands of their ancestors, unresisted, if not welcomed
as allies. The O'Neils and O'Donnells had spread down over Ulster to the frontiers of the pale.
The O'Connors and O'Carrolls had recrossed the Shannon, and pushed forwards into Kildare; the
O'Connor Don was established in a castle near Portarlington, said to be one of the strongest
in Ireland; and the O'Carrolls had seized Leap, an ancient Danish fortress, surrounded by bog
and forest, a few miles from Parsonstown. O'Brien of Inchiquin, Prince--as he styled himself--of
Thomond, no longer contented with his principality of Clare, had thrown a bridge across the
Shannon five miles above Limerick, and was thus enabled to enter Munster at his pleasure and
spread his authority towards the south; while the M'Carties and O'Sullivans, in Cork and Kerry,
were only not dangerous to the Earls of Desmond, because the Desmonds were more Irish than
themselves, and were accepted as their natural chiefs.

[Sidenote: The Earls of Ormond only continue to hold them in check.]

[Sidenote: The desire of the Ormonds to maintain the English rule greater than their power.]

In Tipperary and Kilkenny only the Celtic reaction was held in check. The Earls of Ormond,
although they were obliged themselves to live as Irish chieftains, and to govern by the Irish
law, yet partly from an inherent nobility of nature, partly through family alliances and a
more sustained intercourse with their English kindred, partly perhaps from the inveterate feud
of their house with the Geraldines of Kildare, remained true to their allegiance, and maintained
the English authority so far as their power extended. That power, unfortunately, was incommensurate
with their good will, and their situation prevented them from rendering the assistance to the
crown which they desired. Wexford, Wicklow, and the mountains of Dublin, were occupied by the
Highland tribes of O'Bryne and O'Toole, who, in their wild glens and dangerous gorges, defied
attempts to conquer them, and who were able, at all times, issuing down out of the passes of
the hills, to cut off communication with the pale. Thus the Butlers had no means of reaching
Dublin except through the county of Kildare, the home of their hereditary rivals and foes.

[Sidenote: Sixty chief lords in Ireland, who made war and peace for themselves, and obeyed
only the sword.]

[Sidenote: In each of these sixty districts divers petty captains, who claimed a like independence.]

This is a general account of the situation of the various parties in Ireland at the beginning
of the sixteenth century. I have spoken only of the leading families; and I have spoken of
them as if they possessed some feudal supremacy,--yet even this slight thread of order was
in many cases without real consistency, and was recognised only when fear, or passion, or interest,
prompted. "There be sixty counties, called regions, in Ireland," says the report of 1515, "inhabited
with the king's Irish enemies, some regions as big as a shire, some more, some less, where
reigneth more than sixty chief captains, whereof some calleth themselves kings, some king's
peers in their language, some princes, some dukes, that liveth only by the sword, and obeyeth
to no other temporal person save only to himself that is strong. And every of the said captains
maketh war and peace for himself, and holdeth by the sword, and hath imperial jurisdiction,
and obeyeth no other person, English or Irish, except only to such persons as may subdue him
by the sword.... Also, in every of the said regions, there be divers petty captains, and every
of them maketh war and peace for himself, without licence of his chief captain.... And there
be more than thirty of the English noble folk that followeth this same Irish order, and keepeth
the same rule."[294] Every man, in short, who could raise himself to that dishonourable position,
was captain of a troop of banditti, and counted it his chief honour to live upon the plunder
of his neighbour.

[Sidenote: Why anarchy did not work its own cure.]

[Sidenote: Extreme misery of the people.]

This condition of things might have been expected to work its own cure. The earth will not
support human life uncultivated, and men will not labour without some reasonable hope that
they will enjoy the fruit of their labour. Anarchy, therefore, is usually shortlived, and perishes
of inanition. Unruly persons must either comply with the terms on which alone they are permitted
to subsist, and consent to submit to some kind of order, or they must die. The Irish, however,
were enabled to escape from this most wholesome provision by the recklessness of the people,
who preferred any extremity of suffering to the endurance of the least restraint, and by the
tyranny under which the labouring poor were oppressed. In England, the same hands were trained
to hold the sword and to hold the plough. The labourers and the artisans in peace were the
soldiers in war. In Ireland, labour was treated as disgraceful; the chiefs picked out the strongest
and fiercest of their subjects, and trained them only to fight; the labourers were driven to
the field as beasts of burden, and compelled to work on the chance that the harvest might be
secured. By this precarious means, with the addition of the wild cattle which roamed in thousands
among the woods and bogs, sufficient sustenance was extracted from the soil to support a scanty
population, the majority of whom were supposed to be the most wretched specimens of human nature
which could be found upon the globe. "What common folk in all this world," the report says,
"is so poor, so feeble, so evil beseen in town and field, so bestial, so greatly oppressed
and trodden under foot, fares so evil, with so great misery, and with so wretched life, as
the common folk of Ireland? What pity is here, what ruth is to report, there is no tongue that
can tell, ne person that can write. It passeth far the orators and muses all to shew the order
of the nobles, and how cruel they entreateth the poor common people. What danger it is to the
king against God to suffer his land, whereof he bears the charge and the cure temporal, to
be in the said misorder so long without remedy. It were more honour to surrender his claim
thereto, and to make no longer prosecution thereof, than to suffer his poor subjects always
to be so oppressed, and all the nobles of the land to be at war within themselves, always shedding
of Christian blood without remedy. The herd must render account for his fold; and the king
for his."[295]

[Sidenote: Irish and English estimate of the same phenomenon.]

The English writer did not exaggerate the picture, for his description is too abundantly confirmed
in every page of the Celtic Annalists, with only but a single difference. To the Englishman
the perpetual disturbance appeared a dishonour and disgrace; to the Celt it was the normal
and natural employment of human beings, in the pursuit of which lay the only glory and the
only manly pleasure.

A population of such a character presented in itself a difficulty sufficiently formidable;
and this difficulty was increased by the character of the family on whom the circumstances
of their position most obliged the English government to rely. There were two methods of maintaining
the show of English sovereignty. Either an English deputy might reside in Dublin, supported
by a standing army; or it was necessary to place confidence in one or other of the great Irish
noblemen, and to govern through him. Either method had its disadvantages. The expense of the
first was enormous, for the pay of the common soldier was sixpence or eightpence a-day--an
equivalent of six or eight shillings; and as the arrival of an English deputy was the signal
for a union throughout Ireland of all septs and clans against a common enemy, his presence
was worse than useless, unless he could maintain a body of efficient troops numerous enough
to cope with the coalition. At the same time the cost, great as it would have been, must have
fallen wholly on the crown, for the parliaments would make no grants of money for the support
of a mercenary army, except on extraordinary emergencies.

On the other hand, to choose an Irish deputy was to acquiesce in disorder, and to lend a kind
of official sanction to it. It was inexpensive, however, and therefore convenient; and evils
which were not actually felt in perpetual demands for money, and in uncomfortable reports,
could for a time be forgotten or ignored. In this direction lay all the temptations. The condition
of the country was only made known to the English government through the deputy, who could
represent it in such colours as he pleased; and the government could persuade themselves that
evils no longer complained of had ceased to exist.

[Sidenote: The government of Ireland conducted by Irish noblemen.]

[Sidenote: Coyne and livery extorted by the deputies.]

[Sidenote: The people unprotected even within the pale.]

This latter method, therefore, found most favour in London. Irish noblemen were glad to accept
the office of deputy, and to discharge it at a low salary or none; but it was in order to abuse
their authority for their personal advantage. They indemnified themselves for their exertions
to keep order, which was not kept, by the extortion which they practised in the name of the
government which they represented; and thus deservedly made the English rule more than ever
detested. Instead of receiving payment, they were allowed while deputies what was called "coyne
and livery"; that is to say, they were allowed to levy military service, and to quarter their
followers on the farmers and poor gentlemen of the pale; or else to raise fines in composition,
under pretence that they were engaged in the service of the crown. The entire cost of this
system was estimated at the enormous sum of a hundred pounds a day.[296] The exactions might
have been tolerated if the people had been repaid by protection; but forced as they were to
pay black mail at the same time to the Irish borderers, the double burdens had the effect of
driving every energetic settler out of the pale, and his place was filled by some poor Irishman
whom use had made acquainted with misery.[297]

[Sidenote: The Geraldines of Kildare, from their position, the natural deputies.]

[Sidenote: The policy of the Geraldines to make the government impossible except to themselves.]

Nor was extortion the only advantage which the Irish deputies obtained from their office. They
prosecuted their private feuds with the revenues of the state. They connived at the crimes
of any chieftain who would join their faction. Every conceivable abuse in the administration
of the government attended the possession of power by the Geraldines of Kildare, and yet by
the Geraldines it was almost inevitable that the power should be held. The choice lay between
the Kildares and the Ormonds. No other nobleman could pretend to compete with these two. The
Earls of Desmond only could take rank as their equals; and the lordships of Desmond were at
the opposite extremity of the island. The services of the Earls of Ormond were almost equally
unavailable. When an Earl of Ormond was residing at Dublin as deputy, he was separated from
his clan by fifty miles of dangerous road. The policy of the Geraldines was to secure the government
for themselves by making it impossible for any other person to govern; and the appointment
of their rival was a signal for the revolt of the entire clan, both in Leinster and Munster.
The Butlers were too weak to resist this combination; and inasmuch as they were themselves
always loyal when a Geraldine was in power, and the Geraldines were disloyal when a Butler
was in power, the desire to hush up the difficulty, and to secure a show of quiet, led to the
consistent preference of the more convenient chief.

There were qualities also in the Kildare family which gave them peculiar influence, not in
Ireland only, but at the English court. Living like wild Irish in their castle at Maynooth,
they appeared in London with the address of polished courtiers. When the complaints against
them became too serious to neglect, they were summoned to give account of their conduct. They
had only to present themselves before the council, and it was at once impossible to believe
that the frank, humorous, high-minded gentlemen at the bar could be the monsters who were charged
with so fearful crimes. Their ever-ready wit and fluent words, their show of bluntness and
pretence of simplicity, disarmed anger and dispersed calumny; and they returned on all such
occasions to Ireland more trusted than ever, to laugh at the folly which they had duped.

[Sidenote: The eighth Earl of Kildare in rebellion against Henry VII.]

[Sidenote: He appears before the council,]

[Sidenote: Who decide that since Ireland cannot govern him, he must govern Ireland.]

The farce had already continued through two generations at the opening of the Reformation.
Gerald, the eighth earl, was twice in rebellion against Henry VII. He crowned Lambert Simnel
with his own hand; when Lambert Simnel fell, he took up Perkin Warbeck; and under pretence
of supporting a competitor for the crown, carried fire and sword through Ireland. At length,
when England was quiet, Sir Edward Poynings was sent to Dublin to put down this new King-maker.
He took the earl prisoner, with some difficulty, and despatched him to London, where he appeared
at the council-board, hot-handed from murder and treason. The king told him that heavy accusations
would be laid to his charge, and that he had better choose some counsel to plead his cause.
The earl looked at him with a smile of simplicity. "I will choose the ablest in England," he
said; "your Highness I take for my counsel against these false knaves."[298] The accusations
were proceeded with. Among other enormities, Kildare had burnt the cathedral at Cashel, and
the archbishop was present as witness and prosecutor. The earl confessed his offence: "but
by Jasus," he added, "I would not have done it if I had not been told that my lord archbishop
was inside."[299] The insolent wit, and the danger of punishing so popular a nobleman, passed
the reply as sufficient. The council laughed. "All Ireland cannot govern this earl," said one.
"Then let this earl govern all Ireland," was the prompt answer of Henry VII.[300] He was sent
over a convicted traitor,--he returned a knight of the Garter, lord deputy, and the representative
of the crown. Rebellion was a successful policy, and a lesson which corresponded so closely
to the Irish temper was not forgotten.

[Sidenote: Rebellion prospers with the Geraldines]

"What, thou fool," said Sir Gerald Shaneson to a younger son of this nobleman, thirty years
later, when he found him slow to join the rebellion against Henry VIII. "What, thou fool, thou
shalt be the more esteemed for it. For what hadst thou, if thy father had not done so? What
was he until he crowned a king here, took Garth, the king's captain, prisoner, hanged his son,
resisted Poynings and all deputies; killed them of Dublin upon Oxmantown Green; would suffer
no man to rule here for the king but himself! Then the king regarded him, and made him deputy,
and married thy mother to him;[301] or else thou shouldst never have had a foot of land, where
now thou mayest dispend four hundred marks by the year."[302]

These scornful words express too truly the position of the Earl of Kildare, which, however,
he found it convenient to disguise under a decent exterior. The borders of the pale were partially
extended; the O'Tooles were driven further into the Wicklow mountains, and an outlying castle
was built to overawe them at Powerscourt. Some shadow of a revenue was occasionally raised;
and by this show of service, and because change would involve the crown in expense, he was
allowed to go his own way. He held his ground till the close of his life, and dying, he left
behind him a son trained on his father's model, and who followed with the utmost faithfulness
in his father's steps.

[Sidenote: Gerald, ninth earl, becomes deputy, 1513.]

[Sidenote: Is deposed in 1520, and the Earl of Surrey takes his place.]

Gerald, son of Gerald, ninth earl, became deputy, almost it seemed by right of inheritance,
in 1513; and things were allowed to continue in their old course for another five years; when
at length Henry VIII. awoke to the disgrace which the condition of the country reflected upon
him. The report of 1515 was the first step gained; the Earl of Ormond contributed to the effect
produced by the report, with representations of the conduct of the deputy, who had been fortifying
his own castle with government stores; and the result was a resolution to undertake measures
of real vigour. In 1520, the Earl of Kildare was deprived of his office, and sent for to England.
His place was taken by the Earl of Surrey, who of all living Englishmen combined in the highest
degree the necessary qualities of soldier and statesman. It seemed as if the old weak forbearance
was to last no longer, and as if Ireland was now finally to learn the needful lesson of obedience.

[Sidenote: The report had said that the Irish could never be reformed except by force.]

But the first efforts to cure an inveterate evil rarely succeed; and Henry VIII., like every
other statesman who has undertaken to reform Ireland, was to purchase experience by failure.
The report had declared emphatically that the Irish chiefs would never submit so long as they
might resist, and escape with their lives; that conciliation would be only interpreted as weakness;
and that the tyrannical lords and gentlemen must be coerced into equity by the sword freely used.

[Sidenote: The king will not believe it.]

The king, however, was young and sanguine; he was unable to accept so hard a conclusion; he
could not believe that any body of human beings were so hopelessly inaccessible to the ordinary
means of influence as the Irish gentlemen were represented to be. He would first try persuasion,
and have recourse to extremity only if persuasion failed.

[Sidenote: Lord Surrey is to lecture the chiefs on the principles of government.]

His directions to the Earl of Surrey, therefore, were that at the earliest opportunity he should
call an assembly of so many of the Irish chiefs as he could induce to come to him, and to discourse
to them upon the elementary principles of social order and government.

[Sidenote: He is to teach them that realms without justice be but tyrannies.]

[Sidenote: He is not, however, to threaten,]

[Sidenote: But he is to persuade,]

[Sidenote: And they may obey their own laws if they prefer it, if those laws be good and reasonable,
so only that they obey some law, and do not live at will.]

"We think it expedient," he wrote, "that when ye shall call the lords and other captains of
that our land before you, as of good congruence ye must needs do; ye, after and amongst other
overtures by your wisdom then to be made, shall declare unto them the great decay, ruin, and
desolation of that commodious and fertile land, for lack of politic governance and good justice;
which can never be brought in order unless the unbridled sensualities of insolent folk be brought
under the rule of the laws. For realms without justice be but tyrannies and robberies, more
consonant to beastly appetites than to the laudable life of reasonable creatures. And whereas
wilfulness doth reign by strength without law or justice, there is no distinction of propriety
in dominion; ne yet any man may say this is mine, but by strength the weaker is subdued and
oppressed, which is contrary to all laws, both of God and man.... Howbeit, our mind is, not
that ye shall impress on them any opinion by fearful words, that we intend to expel them from
their lands and dominions lawfully possessed; ne yet that we be minded to constrain them precisely
to obey our laws, ministered by our justices there; but under good manner to show unto them
that of necessity it is requisite that every reasonable creature be governed by a law. And
therefore, if they shall allege that our laws there used be too extreme and rigorous; and that
it should be very hard for them to observe the same; then ye may further ensearch of them under
what manners, and by what laws, they will be ordered and governed, to the intent that if their
laws be good and reasonable, they may be approved; and the rigour of our laws, if they shall
think them too hard, be mitigated and brought to such moderation as they may conveniently live
under the same. By which means ye shall finally induce them of necessity to conform their order
of living to the observance of some reasonable law, and not to live at will as they have used
heretofore."[303]

[Sidenote: Surrey greeted with instant rebellion,]

[Sidenote: instigated by Kildare.]

[Sidenote: Advice of Surrey to do all or nothing.]

So wrote Henry in 1520, being then twenty-eight years old, in his inexperience of human nature,
and especially of the Irish form of it. No words could be truer, wiser, or more generous; but
those only listen effectively to words of wisdom and generosity, who themselves possess something
of the same qualities; and the Irish would not have required that such an address should be
made to them if they had been capable of profiting by it. If Surrey was sanguine of any good
result, he was soon undeceived. He had no sooner landed than the whole country was in arms
against him,--O'Neile, O'Carroll, O'Connor, O'Brien, Desmond, broke into simultaneous rebellion,
acting, as was proved by intercepted letters,[304] under instructions which Kildare had sent
from England. Surrey saw at a glance the justice of the language of the report. He informed
Wolsey briefly of the state of the country, and advised that unless the king was prepared for
extreme measures, he should not waste money in partial efforts.[305] Writing subsequently to
Henry himself, he said that the work to be done was a repetition of the conquest of Wales by
Edward I, and it would prove at least, as tedious and as expensive. Nevertheless, if the king
could make up his mind to desire it, there was no insuperable difficulty. He would undertake
the work himself with six thousand men. The difficulty would be then, however, but half overcome,
for the habits of the people were incurable. Strong castles must be built up and down the island,
like those at Conway and Carnarvon; and a large immigration would be necessary of English colonists.[306]
Either as much as this should be done, the earl thought, or nothing. Half measures only made
bad into worse; and a policy of repression, if not consistently maintained, was unjust and
pernicious. It encouraged the better affected of the inhabitants to show their good will to
the government; and when the Irish were again in power, these persons were marked for vengeance.

[Sidenote: The king persists in a middle way; and Surrey at length desires his recal.]

Practical experience was thus laid against Henry's philosophy; and it would have been well
if the king could have discerned clearly on which side the truth was likely to lie. For the
misfortune of Ireland, this was not the case. It was inconvenient at the moment to undertake
a costly conquest. Surrey was maintained with a short retinue, and from want of power could
only enter upon a few partial expeditions. He inflicted a heavy defeat upon O'Neile; he stormed
a castle of O'Connor's; and showed, with the small means at his disposal, what he might have
done with far less support than he had required. He went where he pleased through the country.
But his course was "as the way of a ship through the sea, or as the way of a bird through the
air." The elements yielded without resistance, and closed in behind him; and, after eighteen
months of manful exertion, feeling the uselessness of further enterprises conducted on so small
a scale, to the sorrow and alarm of the Irish council, he desired and obtained his recal.[307]

[Sidenote: Kildare finds favour.]

[Sidenote: Kildare returns to Ireland. Lord Ormond deputy.]

[Sidenote: The Geraldines rebel,]

Meanwhile, in England, the Earl of Kildare had made good use of his opportunities. In spite
of his detected letters, he had won his way into favour. He accompanied Henry to the Field
of the Cloth of Gold, where he distinguished himself by his brilliant bearing; and instead
of punishing him as a traitor, the king allowed him to marry Lady Elizabeth Grey, daughter
of the Marquis of Dorset, and nearly related to the blood royal. He was permitted to return
to Ireland; not, however, immediately as deputy. An intermediate effort was made to govern
through Lord Ormond, whose intentions were excellent, but unfortunately the Irish refused to
submit to him. The Earl of Desmond remained in rebellion, and invaded Kilkenny from the south;
and two years followed of universal insurrection, pillage, and murder. Kildare accused Ormond
to the English council as responsible;[308] Ormond retorted with similar charges against Kildare;
and commissioners were sent over to "investigate," with instructions, if they saw reason, to
replace Kildare in his old office.

[Sidenote: And Kildare is restored.]

[Sidenote: Desmond makes a league with Francis I.,]

[Sidenote: Kildare secretly conniving at it, and preparing for a general insurrection.]

[Sidenote: The state of Ireland becomes at last dangerous.]

The permission was sufficient; in 1524 he was again deputy; and no deliberate purpose of misrule
could have led to results more fatal. The earl, made bold by impunity, at once prepared for
a revolt from the English crown. Hitherto he had been contented to make himself essential to
the maintenance of the English sovereignty; he now launched out into bolder measures, and encouraged
by Henry's weakness, resolved to dare the worst extremity. On the breaking out of the French
war of 1523-24, his kinsman, the Earl of Desmond, opened a negotiation with Francis I. for
the landing of a French army in Munster.[309] Kildare, while professing that he was endeavouring
to take Desmond prisoner, was holding secret interviews with him to concert plans for a united
move,[310] and was strengthening himself at the same time with alliances among the native chiefs.
One of his daughters became the wife of the O'Connor; another married O'Carroll, of Leap Castle;
and a third the Baron of Slane;[311] and to leave no doubt of his intentions, he transferred
the cannon and military stores from Dublin Castle to his own fortress at Maynooth. Lord Ormond
sent information to England of these proceedings, but he could gain no hearing. For three years
the Geraldines were allowed to continue their preparations undisturbed; and perhaps they might
have matured their plans at leisure, so odious had become the mention of Ireland to the English
statesmen, had not the king's divorce, by embroiling him with the pope and emperor, made the
danger serious.

[Sidenote: Desmond applies to the emperor.]

[Sidenote: Kildare again in London, and committed to the Tower.]

[Sidenote: O'Connor invades the pale, and takes the vice-deputy prisoner.]

The alliance of England and France had disconcerted the first scheme. No sooner was this new
opportunity opened than, with Kildare's consent, Desmond applied to Charles V. with similar
overtures.[312] This danger was too serious to be neglected; and in 1527, Kildare was a second
time summoned to London. He went, so confident was he of the weakness of the government, and
again he was found to have calculated justly. He was arraigned before the council, overwhelmed
with invectives by Wolsey,[313] and sent to the Tower. But he escaped by his old art. No sooner
was he committed, than Lady Elizabeth Fitzgerald, who had accompanied him to England, hurried
back across the Channel to the castle of her brother-in-law, O'Connor.[314] The robber chief
instantly rose and attacked the pale. The Marchers opened their lines to give his banditti
free passage into the interior;[315] and he seized and carried off prisoner the Baron of Delvin,
who had been made vice-deputy on Kildare's departure. Desmond meanwhile held Ormond in check
at Kilkenny, and prevented him from sending assistance to Dublin; and the Irish council were
at once prostrate and helpless.

[Sidenote: The Duke of Richmond viceroy.]

[Sidenote: Skeffington made deputy to govern with the help of Kildare.]

Henry VIII., on receipt of this intelligence, instead of sending Kildare to the block and equipping
an army, condescended to write a letter of remonstrance to O'Connor. "A letter from the king!"
said the insolent chieftain when it was brought to him, "what king! If I may live one year,
I trust to see Ireland in that case that there shall be no more mention here of the King of
England than of the King of Spain,"[316] Still, however, it was thought inconvenient to venture
extremities. Henry allowed himself to make use of Kildare's assistance to soothe the immediate
storm.[317] An old desire of the Irish had been that some prince of the blood should govern
them;[318] he nominated therefore, his natural son, the Duke of Richmond as viceroy; and having
no adequate force in Ireland to resist an insurrection, and no immediate means of despatching
any such force, he was once more obliged to pardon and restore the traitorous Geraldine; appointing,
at the same time, Sir William Skeffington, a moderately able man, though too old for duty,
as the Duke of Richmond's deputy, and directing him to govern with the advice and coöperation
of the Earl of Kildare.

[Sidenote: John Allen appointed Archbishop of Dublin.]

To this disastrous weakness there was but one counterpoise--that the English party in the council
of Ireland was strengthened by the appointment of John Allen to the archbishopric of Dublin
and the office of chancellor. Allen was one of the many men of talent who owed their elevation
to Wolsey. He was now sent over to keep watch on Kildare, and to supply the government with
accurate information which might be relied upon as a ground for action. Till this time (and
the fact is one which ought to be borne in mind), the government had been forced to depend
for their knowledge of the state of the country either on the representations of the deputy,
or the private accusations of his personal enemies; both of them exceedingly untrustworthy
sources. Henceforward there runs a clear stream of light through the fog and night of confusion,
furnished either by the archbishop or by Allen, Master of the Rolls, who was most likely his
kinsman.

[Sidenote: Kildare a third time deputy.]

[Sidenote: Saturnalia of madness.]

[Sidenote: Despatch of the two Allens.]

[Sidenote: Till great men suffered there would be no peace in Ireland.]

The policy of conciliation, if conduct so feeble deserves to be called a policy at all, had
now reached its limit; and it amounted to confessed imbecility. Twice deposed from power on
clear evidence of high treason, Lord Kildare was once more restored. It cost him but a little
time to deliver himself of the presence of Skeffington; and in 1532 he was again sole deputy.
All which the Earl of Surrey had foretold came to pass. Archbishop Allen was deprived of the
chancellorship, and the Archbishop of Armagh, a creature of the Geraldines, was substituted
in his place. Those noblemen and gentlemen who had lent themselves to the interests of the
English in the earl's absence were persecuted, imprisoned, or murdered. They had ventured to
be loyal from a belief in the assurances which had been made to them; but the government was
far off and Kildare was near; and such of them as he condescended to spare "were now driven
in self-defence, maugre their wills, to follow with the rest."[319] The wind which filled the
sails of the ship in which Kildare returned, blew into flames the fires of insurrection; and
in a very Saturnalia of Irish madness the whole people, with no object that could be discovered
but for very delight in disorder itself, began to tear themselves to pieces. Lord Thomas Butler
was murdered by the Geraldines; Kildare himself was shot through the body in a skirmish; Powerscourt
was burnt by the O'Tooles; and Dublin Castle was sacked in a sudden foray by O'Brien Oge. O'Neile
was out in the north; Desmond in the south; and the English pale was overrun by brigands.[320]
Ireland had found its way into its ideal condition--that condition towards which its instincts
perpetually tended, and which at length it had undisputedly reached. The Allens furnished the
king with a very plain report of the effect of his leniency. They dwelt boldly on the mistakes
which had been made. Reëchoing the words of the Report of 1515, they declared that the only
hope for the country was to govern by English deputies; and that to grudge the cost seemed
"consonant to the nature of him that rather than he will depart with fourpence he will jeopard
to lose twenty shillings--which fourpence, disbursed in time, might have saved the other."[321]
They spoke well of the common Irish. "If well governed," they said, "the Irish would be found
as civil, politic, and active, as any other nation. But what subjects under any prince in the
world," they asked, "would love or defend the rights of that prince who, notwithstanding their
true hearts and obedience, would afterwards put them under the governance of such as would
persecute and destroy them?" Faith must be kept with those to whom promises had been made,
and the habit of rewarding treason with concessions must be brought to an end. "Till great
men suffer for their offences," they added, significantly, "your subjects within the English
pale shall never live in quietness, nor stand sure of their goods and lives. Therefore, let
your deputy have in commandment to do justice upon great thieves and malefactors, and to spare
your pardons."[322]

These were but words, and such words had been already spoken too often to deaf ears; but the
circumstances of the time were each day growing more perilous, and necessity, the true mother
of statesmanship, was doing its work at last.

[Sidenote: Henry awakes at last.]

The winter months passed away, bringing only an increase of wretchedness. At length opened
the eventful year of 1534, and Henry learnt that excommunication was hanging over him--that
a struggle for life or death had commenced--and that the imperial armies were preparing to
strike in the quarrel. From that time onward the King of England became a new man. Hitherto
he had hesitated, temporized, delayed--not with Ireland only, but with the manifold labours
which were thrust upon him. At last he was awake. And, indeed, it was high time. With a religious
war apparently on the eve of explosion, he could ill tolerate a hotbed of sedition at his door;
and Irish sedition was about to receive into itself a new element, which was to make it trebly
dangerous.

[Sidenote: The religious element is introduced into Irish sedition.]

Until that moment the disorders in Ireland had arisen out of a natural preference for anarchy.
Every man's hand was against his neighbour, and the clans made war on each other only for revenge
and plunder and the wild delight of the game. These private quarrels were now to be merged
in a single cause--a cause which was to lend a fresh stimulus to their hatred of England, and
was at once to create and consecrate a national Irish spirit.

[Sidenote: The pope finds in the Irish a ready-made army.]

The Irish were eminently Catholic; not in the high sense of the word,--for "the noble folk"
could "oppress and spoil the prelates of the Church of Christ of their possessions and liberties"
without particular scruple,[323]--but the country was covered with churches and monasteries
in a proportion to the population far beyond what would have been found in any other country
in Europe; and there are forms of superstition which can walk hand in hand with any depth of
crime, when that superstition is provided with a talisman which will wash away the stains of
guilt. The love of fighting was inherent, at the same time, in the Celtic nature. And such
a people, when invited to indulge their humour in the cause or the church, were an army of
insurrection ready made to the hands of the popes, the value of which their Holinesses were
not slow to learn, as they have not been quick to forget.[324]

Henry was aware of the correspondence of Desmond with the emperor. He, perhaps, also expected
that the fiction might be retorted upon him (as it actually was) which had been invented to
justify the first conquest of the island. If Ireland was a fief of the pope, the same power
which had made a present of it to Henry II. might as justly take it away from Henry VIII.;
and the peril of his position roused him at length to an effort. It was an effort still clogged
by fatality, and less than the emergency required: but it was a beginning, and it was something.

[Sidenote: February. Kildare a third time called to England.]

[Sidenote: Kildare is sent to the Tower.]

[Sidenote: Lord Thomas Fitzgerald vice-deputy.]

In February, 1534, a month before Clement pronounced his sentence, the Earl of Kildare was
required, for the third and last time, to appear and answer for his offences; and a third time
he ventured to obey. But England had become a changed world in the four years which had passed
since his last presence there, and the brazen face and fluent lips were to serve him no more.
On his arrival in London he was sent to the Tower, and discovered that he had overstepped his
limits at last.[325] He was now shrewd enough to see that, if a revolt was contemplated, no
time was to be lost. He must play his last card, or his influence was gone for ever. Lord Thomas
Fitzgerald, his eldest son, who in his boyhood had resided in England,[326] had been left as
vice-deputy in his father's absence. The earl before his departure had taken precautions to
place the fortresses of the pale, with the arms and ammunition belonging to the government,
in the hands of dependents whom he could absolutely trust. No sooner was his arrest known than,
in compliance with secret instructions which had been left with them, or were sent from England,
his friends determined upon rebellion.[327]

[Sidenote: June. The emperor sends an agent to the Earl of Desmond.]

The opportunity was well chosen. The government of Ireland was in disorder. Skeffington was
designed for Kildare's successor, but he was not yet appointed; nor was he to cross the Channel
till he had collected a strong body of troops, which was necessarily a work of time. The conditional
excommunication of the king was then freshly published; and counsels, there is reason to think,
were guiding the Irish movement, which had originated in a less distempered brain than that
of an Irish chieftain. Rumours were flying in the southern counties in the middle of June that
a Spanish invasion might be immediately looked for, and the emperor's chaplain was with the
Earl of Desmond. His mission, it was said, was to prepare the way for an imperial army; and
Desmond himself was fortifying Dungarvan, the port at which an invading force could most conveniently
land.[328] There is, therefore, a strong probability that Charles V., who had undertaken to
execute the papal sentence in the course of the summer, was looking for the most vulnerable
point at which to strike; and, not venturing to invade England, was encouraging an Irish rebellion,
with a view to following up his success if the commencement proved auspicious.[329]

[Sidenote: Lord Thomas Fitzgerald proclaims Henry accursed, and calls on the country to rise.]

[Sidenote: June 11. He appears before the council in St. Mary's abbey, and declares formal war.]

Simultaneously with the arrival of these unwelcome news, the English government were informed
by letters from Dublin, that Lord Thomas Fitzgerald had thrown off his allegiance, and had
committed infinite murders, burnings, and robbings in the English pale; making "his avaunt
and boast that he was of the pope's sect and band, and that him he would serve, against the
king and all his partakers; that the King of England was accursed, and as many as took his
part."[330] The signal for the explosion was given with a theatrical bravado suited to the
novel dignity of the cause. Never before had an Irish massacre been graced by a papal sanction,
and it was necessary to mark the occasion by unusual form. The young lord, Silken Thomas, as
he was called, was twenty-one years old, an accomplished Irish cavalier. He was vice-deputy,
or so he considered himself: and unwilling to tarnish the honour of his loyal house by any
action which could be interpreted into treachery, he commenced with a formal surrender of his
office, and a declaration of war. On the eleventh of June the council were sitting in St. Mary's
abbey, when a galloping of horses was heard, and Lord Thomas, at the head of a hundred and
forty of the young Geraldines, dashed up to the gate, and springing off his horse, strode into
the assembly. The council rose, but he ordered them to sit still, and taking the sword of state
in his hand, he spoke in Irish to the following effect:--

"However injuriously we be handled, and forced to defend ourselves in arms, when neither our
service, nor our good meaning towards our prince's crown availeth, yet say not hereafter, but
in this open hostility which we profess here, and proclaim, we have showed ourselves no villains
nor churls, but warriors and gentlemen. This sword of state is yours, and not mine; I received
it with an oath and have used it to your benefit. I should offend mine honour if I turned the
same to your annoyance. Now I have need of mine own sword which I dare trust. As for this common
sword, it flattereth me with a golden scabbard; but it hath in it a pestilent edge, and whetteth
itself in hope of a destruction. Save yourselves from us, as from open enemies. I am none of
Henry's deputy; I am his foe; I have more mind to conquer than to govern, to meet him in the
field than to serve him in office. If all the hearts of England and Ireland that have cause
thereto would join in this quarrel, as I trust they will, then should he be a byword, as I
trust he shall, for his heresy, lechery, and tyranny; wherein the age to come may score him
among the ancient princes of most abominable and hateful memory."[331] "With that," says Campion,
"he rendered up his sword, adding to his shameful oration many other slanderous and foul terms."

Cromer, Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of Armagh, a creature of Kildare, "more like his parish
priest or chaplain, than king's chancellor,"[332] who had been prepared beforehand, rose, and
affected remonstrance; but, speaking in English, his words were not understood by the crowd.
A bard in the Geraldine train cut short his speech with an Irish battle chant; and the wild
troop rushed, shouting, out of the abbey, and galloped from the town.

[Sidenote: Pillage and massacre.]

[Sidenote: The people of the pale join the rebels.]

[Sidenote: He summons Dublin.]

[Sidenote: Archbishop Cromer implores Sir John White, the English commander, to surrender.]

In these mock heroics there need not have been anything worse than folly; but Irish heroism,
like Irish religion, was unfortunately limited to words and feelings. The generous defiance
in the cause of the Catholic faith was followed by pillage and murder, the usual accompaniments
of Irish insurrection, as a sort of initial holocaust to propitiate success. The open country
was at the mercy of the rebels. Fitzgerald, joined by O'Connor, proceeded to swear-in all such
of the inhabitants of the pale as would unite against England; promising protection if they
would consent, but inflicting fire and sword wherever he met refusal. The unfortunate people,
warned by experience that no service was worse requited in Ireland than loyalty, had no spirit
to resist. The few who were obnoxious were killed; the remainder submitted; and the growing
corn was destroyed, and the farms were burnt, up to the gates of Dublin, that when the English
army arrived, they might find neither food to maintain, nor houses to shelter them.[333] The
first object of Fitzgerald, however, was to seize Dublin itself, where a portion of the citizens
were in his favour. In the last week in July he appeared with his followers under the walls;
a small force which had attempted to resist was defeated and driven in; and, under a threat
of burning the city, if he was refused, he demanded the surrender of town and castle. The danger
was immediate. The provident treachery of Kildare, in stripping the castle of its stores and
cannon, had made defence all but impossible. Ormond was far off, and weeks must pass before
relief could arrive from England. Sir John White, an English gentleman, with a handful of men-at-arms,
had military command of the city; and the Archbishop of Armagh implored him to have pity on
the citizens, and not to expose them to the consequences of a storm.[334] White was too stout
a soldier to listen to such timid counsels; yet his position was one of extreme difficulty;
his little garrison was too weak to defend the lines of the town, without the assistance of
the citizens, and the citizens were divided and dispirited. He resolved at, length to surrender
the city, and defend the castle to the last. Fitzgerald threatened that he would hold the townsmen
responsible for the submission of the troops; but, savage as the English commander knew him
to be, he calculated, with justice, that he would not ruin his popularity by cutting the throats
of an unresisting crowd.

[Sidenote: White surrenders the city, and withdraws into the castle.]

[Sidenote: Siege of the castle, July 27.]

[Sidenote: Archbishop Allen endeavours to escape into England.]

[Sidenote: The ship is run ashore at Clontarf.]

[Sidenote: The archbishop is taken to the village of Artayne,]

[Sidenote: And murdered.]

Hastily gathering together sufficient stores to enable him to hold out for a few weeks, and
such arms and ammunition as could be collected in the emergency, White withdrew into the fortress,
taking with him the Master of the Rolls, the Chief Baron, and such other of the council as
desired to be his companions. The inhabitants of Dublin were then empowered to make terms with
the rebels. The gates were opened on Fitzgerald's promise to respect life and property, the
city was occupied, and siege was immediately laid to the castle. This was on the 27th of July.
The morning which followed was marked by one of those atrocities which have so often unfortunately
distinguished Irish rebellions. Archbishop Allen, to whose exertions the exposure of Kildare's
proceedings had been principally due, either fearing the possible consequences to himself if
the castle was taken, as the Irish writers say,[335] or more probably to hasten in person the
arrival of the deputy and his troops, instead of remaining with White, volunteered to cross
to England; and before the gates were opened, he went on board a vessel and dropped down the
river. He had placed himself unknowingly in the hands of traitors, for the ship was commanded
by a Geraldine,[336] and in the night which followed was run aground at Clontarf, close to
the mouth of the Liffey. The country was in possession of the insurgents, the crew were accomplices,
and the stranded vessel, on the retreat of the tide, was soon surrounded. The archbishop was
partly persuaded, partly compelled to go on shore, and was taken by two dependents of the Earl
of Kildare to a farm house in the village of Artayne. Here he was permitted to retire to bed;
but if he slept, it was for an early and a cruel wakening. The news of his capture was carried
to Fitzgerald, who was then in the city, but a few miles distant, and the young lord, with
three of his uncles, was on the spot by daybreak. They entered the house and ordered Allen
to be brought before them. The archbishop was dragged from his bed; and in his shirt as he
was, bare-legged and bare-headed, he dropt upon his knees, and begged for mercy. As well might
the sheep have asked mercy of the famished wolf. He had but time to bequeath his soul to heaven,
and his skull was cloven as he knelt; and, to make clean work, his chaplains, his servants,
all of English blood who were with him, were slaughtered over his body.[337] Such was the pious
offering to God and holy church on which the sun looked down as it rose that fair summer's
morning over Dublin Bay; and such were the men whose cause the Mores and the Fishers, the saintly
monks of the Charterhouse and the holy martyrs of the Catholic faith, believed to be the cause
of the Almighty Father of the world.

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald writes to the pope and the emperor to announce his exploit.]

[Sidenote: Blockade of Dublin Bay.]

[Sidenote: The Prior of Kilmainham crosses with the news from Waterford.]

The morning's work was still but half completed. To massacre a heretic archbishop was a meritorious,
or at least a venial act; but it was desirable that an opinion in favour of it should be pronounced
by authority; or that the guilt, if guilt there was, should be washed off without delay. The
Archdeacon of Kells,[338] therefore, was despatched to the pope and to the emperor, to press
the latter to send assistance on this happy success, and to bring back absolution from his
Holiness,[339] if the murder required it. The next object was to prevent news from reaching
England before the castle should be taken. The river was watched, the timely assistance of
an English pirate enabled Fitzgerald to blockade the bay; and Dublin was effectively sealed.
But the report of the murder spread rapidly through Ireland. In three days it was known at
Waterford; and the Prior of Kilmainham,[340] who had taken refuge there, crossed into Wales
on the instant, intending to ride post to London.[341] He was delayed at St. David's by an
attack of paralysis; but he sent forward a companion who had left Ireland with him; and the
death of the archbishop was made known to Henry in the second week in August.

[Sidenote: August. Skeffington is unprepared.]

[Sidenote: Ormond invades Kildare.]

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald is forced to retire from Dublin.]

[Sidenote: He attacks Ormond.]

[Sidenote: The citizens of Dublin return to their allegiance.]

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald attempts to gain Ormond.]

If Skeffington could set out on the instant, the castle might be saved, and Dublin recovered.
Couriers were despatched to urge him to make haste; and others were sent to Ireland to communicate
with Ormond, and, if possible, with the party in the castle. But Skeffington, who was too old
for his work, had loitered over his preparations, and was not ready; and the delay would have
been fatal, except for the Earl of Ormond, the loyalty of whose noble house at that crisis
alone saved the English authority in Ireland. On the arrival of Henry's courier, he collected
his people and invaded Kildare. The country was unenclosed--not a fence nor a hedge broke the
broad surface of moor and meadow, save where at intervals a few small patches were enclosed
for corn crops. Infinite herds of cattle grazed at will over the expanse of pasture, and these
cattle were the chief dependence of the people. Ormond, by the suddenness of his inroad, and
the absence of the owners, was enabled to sweep clear the whole tract which was occupied by
the Geraldines; and Fitzgerald was forced to retire from Dublin to defend or recover his property.
He left a detachment in the city, to prevent the troops in the castle from obtaining supplies,[342]
and then hurried off to revenge the foray. Entering Carlow, he took a castle on the Slaney,
and murdered the garrison. Thence he turned towards Kilkenny, and was bearing down upon Ormond
with a strength which it would have been hard for the Butlers to resist, when he learnt that
the citizens of Dublin, encouraged by the news that an English army was actually coming, had
repented of their patriotism, and, to earn their pardon from Henry, had closed their gates,
and had seized and imprisoned the party who were left before the castle. The prize for which
he had played so deeply was slipping from his hands at the moment when it was all but won.
He was forced to return in haste; but before he left Kilkenny, he made an effort to induce
Ormond to join him. He promised, that, if the earl would assist him in driving out the English,
he would "take him as his father," that he would make a present to his son, Lord James, of
half the inheritance of the Kildares, and that they two should together rule Ireland.[343]

[Sidenote: Ormond's reply.]

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald's treachery.]

[Sidenote: Dublin is again besieged.]

[Sidenote: September.]

[Sidenote: Skeffington does not arrive.]

[Sidenote: October 4.]

[Sidenote: Ormond again saves Dublin.]

[Sidenote: Siege of Dublin raised, October 14.]

Promises when extorted by presence of danger from a Geraldine were of indifferent value; but
if Fitzgerald's engagements had been as sure as they were false and fleeting, they would have
weighed little with this gallant old nobleman. Ormond replied, that, if the rebels would lay
down their arms and sue for mercy, they might perhaps find it; but for himself, "if his country
were wasted, his castles won or prostrate, and himself exiled, yet would he never shrink to
persevere in his duty to the king to the death."[344] Failing here, and having at the same
time received a check in a skirmish, Fitzgerald next endeavoured to gain time. The Irish clans
were gathering, but they were still at a distance, and his own presence was instantly required
elsewhere. He offered a truce, therefore; and to this Ormond, being hard pressed by the Earl
of Desmond, was ready to consent. But it was only treachery. Ormond broke up his camp, and
his people were scattered; and within three days, O'Neile having joined Fitzgerald, he was
taken at a disadvantage; his son, Lord James, was severely wounded; and a cordon of Irish being
drawn round him, to prevent him from relieving Dublin, the rebel army hastened back to renew
the siege.[345] They had the cannon with them which Kildare had taken from the castle,[346]
but were happily ill-provided with ammunition, or resistance would have been desperate. The
siege opened at the beginning of September. The month passed away, and the place was still
untaken. If the deputy would only arrive, there was still time to save it. Each hour he was
looked for, yet through these priceless days he was loitering at Beaumaris. From the fatality
which has for ever haunted the dealings of English statesmen with Ireland, an old man past
work, weak in health, and with all the moral deficiencies of a failing constitution, had been
selected to encounter a dangerous rebellion. The insurrection had broken out in June; every
moment was precious, the loss of a day might be the loss of the whole country; yet it was now
the fourth of October; the ships were loaded; the horses were on board; they had been on board
a fortnight, and were sickening from confinement. The wind was fair, at that critical season
of the year a matter of incalculable importance. Yet Skeffington was still "not ready."[347]
All would have been lost but for the Earl of Ormond. The city was at the last extremity, when
he contrived to force his way through the Irish into Kildare; he again laid waste the country,
and destroyed the newly-gathered harvests.[348] On the 14th of October Fitzgerald was forced
finally to raise the siege, that his followers might save the remnant of their property from
destruction. The relief was but just in time, for the resources of Dublin were exhausted. Before
retreating, the rebel lord exacted from the corporation an engagement that at the end of six
weeks they should either have procured his pardon from the king, with the deputation of Ireland
for his life, or else should surrender the city. For the fulfilment of these insolent terms
he took as pledges sixteen of the children of the most important families of the city, with
three of the corporation themselves.[349]

[Sidenote: The English army sails at last.]

And now, at length, on the same 14th of October, the English anchors were finally raised, and
the deputy, with Sir William Brereton and Sir John Salisbury, several hundred Northumberland
horse trained in the Border wars, and a number not specified, but probably from two to three
thousand archers and men-at-arms,[350] were under way. Whether the blame of the delay lay with
the incompetency of Skeffington, or the contempt of the English, which would not allow them
to make haste into the presence of an enemy who never dared to encounter them in the field,
but carried on war by perjury, and pillage, and midnight murder--whatever the cause was, they
were at length on their way, and, through the devotion of Ormond, not too late to be of use.

[Sidenote: They cross in a single night.]

[Sidenote: Council of war at Lambay Island.]

The fleet crossed the Channel in a single night, and the next morning were under Lambay Island,[351]
where they had run in for shelter. Here news was brought them that Dublin Castle was taken.
They did not believe it; but a council of war was held, and Skeffington resolved that for himself
he might not risk the attempt to land; Brereton and Salisbury might try it, if they could do
so "without casting themselves away"; the deputy would go on to Waterford with the body of
the army, and join Sir John St. Loo, who had crossed to that port in the week preceding, from
Bristol.

[Sidenote: Sir William Brereton with 500 men enters the Liffey.]

Accordingly, on the morning of the 17th of October, Sir William Brereton, with five hundred
men, sailed into the mouth of the Liffey; and running up the river, instead of an enemy drawn
up to oppose his landing, he found the mayor and corporation waiting at the quay, with drums,
and flags, and trumpets to welcome him as a deliverer.[352]

[Sidenote: An English detachment cut off through Skeffington's imprudence.]

Skeffington was less successful; he remained under Lambay waiting for a wind for Waterford,
and in the meantime Fitzgerald, hearing of the arrival of the fleet, was in force upon the
hills overlooking the anchorage. The English commander, though aware that the insurgents were
in the neighbourhood, allowed himself, with extreme imprudence, to land a detachment of troops,
with directions to march to Dublin. He himself went with the fleet to the Skerries,[353] where
he conceived, under false information, that a party of the rebels were lying. He found nothing
there but a few fishing-boats; and while he was engaged in burning these, Fitzgerald attacked
the division which had been sent on shore, and cut them off to a man. Nor was this the only
misfortune. The pirate ships which had been watching Dublin Bay hovered round the fleet, cutting
off straggling transports; and although one of them was chased and driven on shore, the small
success poorly counterbalanced the injury which had been inflicted.[354]

[Sidenote: October 21. Skeffington lands in Dublin,]

[Sidenote: November. And resolves, the season being late, to do nothing.]

After a week of this trifling, Skeffington consented to resign his intention of going to Waterford,
and followed Brereton into Dublin. Why he had delayed a day after discovering that the river
and the city were open to him, it is impossible to conjecture. But his presence was of little
benefit, and only paralysed his abler subordinates. As soon as he had brought his army into
the city, he conceived that he had done as much as the lateness of the season would allow.
The November weather having set in wild and wet, he gave up all thought of active measures
till the return of spring; and he wrote to inform the king, with much self-approbation, that
he was busy writing letters to the Irish chiefs, and making arrangements for a better government;
that Lord Thomas Fitzgerald had been proclaimed traitor at the market-cross; and that he hoped,
as soon as the chancellor and the vicar-general could come to an understanding, the said traitor
might be pronounced excommunicated.[355] All this was very well, and we learn to our comfort
that in due time the excommunication was pronounced; but it was not putting down the rebellion--it
was not the work for which he was sent to Ireland with three thousand English soldiers.

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald burns Trim and Dunboyne, within six miles of Dublin.]

[Sidenote: He again writes to the emperor.]

Fitzgerald, as soon as the army was landed, retired into the interior; but finding that the
deputy lay idle within the walls, he recovered heart, and at the head of a party of light horse
reappeared within six miles of Dublin. Trim and Dunboyne, two populous villages, were sacked
and burnt, and the blazing ruins must have been seen from the battlements of the Castle. Yet
neither the insults of the rebels nor the entreaty of the inhabitants could move the imperturbable
Skeffington. He lay still within the city walls;[356] and Fitzgerald, still further encouraged,
despatched a fresh party of ecclesiastics to the pope and the emperor, with offers of allegiance
and promises of tribute,[357] giving out meanwhile in Ireland that he would be supported in
the spring or summer by the long talked-of Spanish army. Promises costing Charles V. nothing,
he was probably liberal of them, and waited for the issue to decide how far they should be
observed.

[Sidenote: Skeffington ventures an expedition to Drogheda, and brings back the army in safety.]

If this was so, the English deputy seemed to be determined to give the rebellion every chance
of issuing as the emperor desired. The soldiers were eager for employment, but Skeffington
refused to give his officers an opportunity for distinction in which he did not share,[358]
and a few ineffectual skirmishes in the neighbourhood were the sole exploits which for five
months they were allowed to achieve. One expedition, as far as Drogheda, the deputy indeed
ventured, towards the end of November; and in the account of it which he sent to England, he
wrote as if it were matter of congratulation that he had brought his army back in safety. Nor
were his congratulations, at least to himself, without reason, for he owed that safety to God
and to fortune. He had allowed the archers to neglect the old precaution of taking cases for
their bows. They were overtaken by a storm, which wetted the strings and loosened the feathers
of the arrows; and thus, at disadvantage, they were intercepted in a narrow defile,[359] and
escaped only because the Irish were weak in numbers.

[Sidenote: He excuses himself on the ground of bad health.]

[Sidenote: Consequence of the deputy's inaction.]

He excused himself for his shortcomings on the plea that he was in bad health--an adequate
apology for his own inaction, but none for his appointment on a service so dangerous. Yet perhaps
his failure is explained by the scene of it. Elsewhere, Sir William Skeffington may have been
a gallant soldier and a reasonable man; but the fatal atmosphere of Ireland seems at all times
to have had a power of prostrating English intellect. The Protector Cromwell alone was cased
in armour which could defy its enchantments. An active officer might have kept the field without
difficulty. The Master of the Rolls, to prove that the country, even in mid-winter, was practicable
without danger, rode to Waterford in November with only three hundred horse, through the heart
of the disturbed districts, and returned unmolested.[360] The Earl of Ossory, with Sir John
St. Loo, made an appointment to meet Skeffington at Kilcaa,[361] where, if he brought cannon,
they might recover the castles of the government which were held by the Geraldines. He promised
to go, and he might have done so without danger or difficulty; but he neither went nor sent;
only a rumour came that the deputy was ill;[362] and in these delays and with this ostentation
of imbecility, the winter passed away, as if to convince every wavering Irishman that, strong
as the English might be in their own land, the sword dropped from their nerveless hands when
their feet were on Irish soil. Nor was this the only or the worst consequence. The army, lying
idle in Dublin, grew disorganized; many of the soldiers deserted; and an impression spread
abroad that Henry, after all, intended to return to the old policy, to pardon Fitzgerald, and
to restore him to power.[363]

[Sidenote: February 16.]

The clear pen of the indefatigable Allen lays the state of affairs before us with the most
painful distinctness. "My lord deputy," he wrote to Cromwell on the 16th of February, "now
by the space of twelve or thirteen weeks hath continued in sickness, never once going out of
his house; he as yet is not recovered. In the meantime the rebel hath burnt much of the country,
trusting, if he may be suffered, to waste and desolate the Inglishry, [and thus] to enforce
this army to depart. Sirs, as I heretofore advertised you, this rebel had been banished out
of all these parts or now, if all men had done their duties. But, to be plain with you, except
there be a marshal appointed, which must do strait correction, and the army prohibited from
resorting to Dublin (but ordered to keep the field), the king shall never be well served, but
his purpose shall long be delayed."[364]

[Sidenote: The wages are ill-paid. The army is mutinous.]

[Sidenote: The military stores worthless.]

The wages, also, were ill-paid, though money in abundance had been provided. The men were mutinous,
and indemnified themselves at the expense of the wretched citizens, whose houses they pillaged
at will under pretence that the owners were in league with the rebels.[365] The arms, also,
which had been supplied to the troops, were of the worst kind: they had been furnished out
of ordnance which had been long on hand, and were worthless.[366]

[Sidenote: The Irish council desire the recal of Skeffington. The king refuses.]

[Sidenote: The army leave Dublin, and commence work.]

The conduct of the king, when the representations of Allen were laid before him, was very unlike
what the popular conception of his character would have led us to expect. We imagine him impatient
and irritable; and supposing him to have been (as he certainly was) most anxious to see the
rebellion crushed, we should have looked for some explosion of temper; or, at least, for some
imperious or arbitrary message to the unfortunate deputy. He contented himself, however, with
calmly sending some one whom he could trust to make inquiries; and even when the result confirmed
the language of the Master of the Rolls, and the deputy's recal was in consequence urged upon
him, he still refused to pass an affront upon an old servant. He appointed Lord Leonard Grey,
brother-in-law of the Countess of Kildare, chief marshal of the army; but he would not even
send Grey over till the summer, and he left Skeffington an opportunity of recovering his reputation
in the campaign which was to open with the spring.[367] The army, however, was ordered to leave
Dublin without delay; and the first move, which was made early in February, was followed by
immediate fruits. Two of the pirates who had been acting with Fitzgerald were taken, and hanged.[368]
Several other offenders of note were also caught and thrown into prison; and in two instances,
as if the human ministers of justice had not been sufficiently prompt, the higher powers thought
fit to inflict the necessary punishment. John Teling, one of the archbishop's murderers, died
of a foul disorder at Maynooth;[369] and the Earl of Kildare, the contriver of the whole mischief,
closed his evil career in the Tower of London "for thought and pain."[370] He was attainted
by the parliament which sat in the autumn, and lay under sentence of death when death came
unbidden to spare the executioner his labour.

[Sidenote: Death of the Earl of Kildare.]

[Sidenote: March 14. Skeffington takes the field. Siege of Maynooth Castle.]

Meantime, the spring opened at last, and affairs further improved. Skeffington's health continued
weak; but with the advance of the season he was able to take the field; and on the 14th of
March he appeared under the walls of Maynooth. This castle was the strongest in the possession
of the Geraldines. Vast labour had been recently expended on its fortifications, for which
the king's subjects had been forced to pay. It was defended by the ordnance from Dublin, and
held by a small but adequate garrison. It was thought to be impregnable, and in the earlier
stages of the science of gunnery it might possibly have defied the ordinary methods of attack.
Nay, with a retrospective confidence in the strength of its defences, the Irish historians
have been unable to believe that it could have been fairly taken; they insist that it resisted
the efforts of the besiegers, and was on the point of being saved by Fitzgerald,[371] when
it was delivered to the English commander by treachery. A despatch to the king, which was written
from the spot, and signed by the deputy and all the members of the Irish council, leaves but
little remaining of this romance.

[Sidenote: The walls are bombarded.]

[Sidenote: March 23. The castle is stormed.]

[Sidenote: Thirty-seven prisoners taken.]

An authentic account of an attack by cannon on a fortified place at that era, will scarcely
fail to be interesting. The castle, says this document, was so strongly defended both with
men and ordnance, "as the like had not been seen in Ireland since the Conquest." The garrison
consisted of a hundred men, of which sixty were gunners. On the third day of the siege the
English batteries opened on the north-west side of the donjon, and destroying the battlements,
buried the cannon on that part of the wall under the ruins. The siege lines were then moved
"to the north side of the base court of the castle, at the north-east end whereof there was
a new-made, very strong, and fast bulwark, well garrisoned with men and ordnance." Here a continual
fire was sustained for five days, "on that wise that a breach and entry was made there." Whereupon,
continues the despatch, "The twenty-third day, being Tuesday next before Easter day, there
was a galiard assault given before five o'clock in the morning, and the base court entered;
at which entry there were slain of the ward of the castle about sixty, and of your Grace's
army no more but John Griffin, yeoman of your most honourable guard, and six others which were
killed with ordnance of the castle at the entry. Howbeit, if it had not pleased God to preserve
us, it were to be marvelled that we had no more slain. After the base court was thus won, we
assaulted the great castle, which within a while yielded." Thirty-seven of the remaining garrison
were taken prisoners, with two officers, two Irish ecclesiastics who had distinguished themselves
in promoting the insurrection, and one of the murderers of the archbishop.

The place was taken by fair fighting, it seems, without need of treachery; and the capture
by storm of a fortified castle was a phenomenon altogether new to the Irish, who had yet to
learn the effect of well-served cannon upon walls.[372]

The work at length was begun in earnest, and in order to drive the lesson home into the understanding
of the people, and to instruct them clearly that rebellion and murder were not any longer to
be tolerated, the prisoners were promptly brought up before the provost-marshal, and twenty-six
of them there and then, under the ruins of their own den, were hung up for sign to the whole
nation.[373]

[Sidenote: The Pardon of Maynooth. The effect of it upon the people.]

[Sidenote: The rebellion vanishes.]

A judicial operation of this kind had never before been witnessed in Ireland within the known
cycle of its history, and the effect of it was proportionately startling. In the presence of
this "Pardon of Maynooth," as it was called, the phantom of rebellion vanished on the spot.
It was the first serious blow which was struck in the war, and there was no occasion for a
second. In a moment the noise and bravado which had roared from Donegal to Cork was hushed
into a supplication for forgiveness. Fitzgerald was hastening out of Thomond to the relief
of his fortress. When they heard of the execution, his army melted from him like a snowdrift.
The confederacy of the chiefs was broken up; first one fell away from it, and then another;
and before the summer had come, O'Brien of Inchiquin, O'Connor, who had married Fitzgerald's
sister, and the few scattered banditti of the Wicklow mountains, were all who remained of the
grand association which was to place the Island of Saints at the feet of the Father of Christendom.

Sadder history in the compass of the world's great chronicle there is none than the history
of the Irish: so courageous, yet so like cowards; so interesting, yet so resolute to forfeit
all honourable claims to interest. In thinking of them, we can but shake our heads with Lord
Chancellor Audeley, when meditating on this rebellion, and repeat after him, "they be a people
of strange nature, and of much inconstancy."[374]

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald retreats into Thomond, intending to sail for Spain.]

[Sidenote: O'Brien persuades him to remain.]

Lord Fitzgerald was now a fugitive, with a price upon his head. He retreated into Thomond,
intending to sail for Spain, and to attempt with his own lips to work persuasion with the emperor.[375]
There was an expectation, however, that the Spaniards might be already on their way: and O'Brien
persuaded him to remain, to prevent the complete disintegration of his party. Sir James de
la Hyde was therefore sent to Charles; and the wretched young nobleman himself wandered from
place to place, venturing, while Skeffington still lay at Maynooth, into the neighbourhood
of his home, among his own people, yet unable to do more than evade the attempts which were
made to capture him. The life of the rebellion was gone from it.

[Sidenote: Fidelity of the people.]

There was no danger that he would be betrayed. The Irish had many faults--we may not refuse
them credit for their virtues. However treacherous they were to their enemies, however inconstant
in their engagements, uncertain, untrue in ordinary obligations, they were without rivals in
the world in their passionate attachments among themselves; and of all the chiefs who fell
from Fitzgerald's banner, and hastened with submission to the English deputy, there was perhaps
not one who, though steeped in the blood of a hundred murders, would not have been torn limb
from limb rather than have listened to a temptation to betray him.

[Sidenote: Arrival of Lord Leonard Grey. Fitzgerald writes to him with an offer of surrender.]

At length, after a narrow escape from a surprise, from which he rescued himself only by the
connivance of the Irish kerne who were with the party sent to take him, the young earl, as
he now called himself, weary of his wandering life, and when no Spaniards came, seeing that
his cause was for the present hopeless offered to surrender. It was by this time August, and
Lord Leonard Grey, his father's brother-in-law, was present with the army. To him he wrote
from O'Connor's Castle, in King's County, apologizing for what he had done, desiring pardon
"for his life and lands," and begging his kinsman to interest himself in his behalf. If he
could obtain his forgiveness, he promised to deserve it. If it was refused, he said that he
"must shift for himself the best that he could."[376]

[Sidenote: Grey suggests an interview.]

[Sidenote: August 18.]

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald meets him,]

[Sidenote: And surrenders on a dubious promise of pardon.]

In reply to this overture, Grey suggested an interview. The appointment of so near a relative
of the Kildare's to high office in Ireland had been determined, we may be sure, by the Geraldine
influence in the English council. The marshal was personally acquainted with Fitzgerald, and
it is to be observed that the latter in writing to him signed himself his "loving friend."
That Lord Leonard was anxious to save him does not admit of a doubt; he had been his father's
chief advocate with the king, and his natural sympathy with the representative of an ancient
and noble house was strengthened by family connexion. He is not to be suspected, therefore,
of treachery, at least towards his kinsman. The interview was agreed upon, and on the eighteenth
of August, Grey, with Sir Rice Mansell, Chief Justice Aylmer, Lord James Butler, and Sir William
St. Loo, rode from Maynooth into King's County, where, on the borders of the Bog of Allen,
Fitzgerald met them. Here he repeated the conditions upon which he was ready to surrender.
Lord Grey said that he had no authority to entertain such conditions; but he encouraged the
hope that an unconditional surrender would tell in his favour, and he promised himself to accompany
his prisoner to the king's presence. Fitzgerald interpreting expressions confessedly intended
"to allure him to yield,"[377] in the manner most favourable to himself, placed himself in
the hands of the marshal, and rode back with him to the camp.

[Sidenote: Embarrassment of the government.]

[Sidenote: If Fitzgerald was spared, the government of Ireland was impossible.]

[Sidenote: Yet, were the English entitled to reap the benefit of his capture?]

The deputy wrote immediately to announce the capture. Either the terms on which it had been
effected had not been communicated to him, or he thought it prudent to conceal them, for he
informed Henry that the traitor had yielded without conditions, either of pardon, life, lands,
or goods, "but only submitting to his Grace's mercy."[378] The truth, however, was soon known;
and it occasioned the gravest embarrassment. How far a government is bound at any time to respect
the unauthorized engagements of its subordinates, is one of those intricate questions which
cannot be absolutely answered;[379] and it was still less easy to decide, where the object
of such engagements had run a career so infamous as Lord Thomas Fitzgerald. No pirate who ever
swung on a well-earned gallows had committed darker crimes, and the king was called upon to
grant a pardon in virtue of certain unpermitted hopes which had been held out in his name.
He had resolved to forgive no more noble traitors in Ireland, and if the archbishop's murder
was passed over, he had no right to affect authority in a country where he was so unable to
exert it. On the other hand, the capture of so considerable a person was of great importance;
his escape abroad, if he had desired to leave the country, could not have been prevented; and
while the government retained the benefit which they derived from his surrender, their honour
seemed to be involved in observing the conditions, however made, by which it had been secured.

[Sidenote: The Duke of Norfolk advises delay of punishment.]

[Sidenote: Fitzgerald is hanged the following year at Tyburn.]

It is likely, though it is not certain, that Lord Leonard foresaw the dilemma in which Henry
would be placed, and hoped by means of it to secure the escape of his kinsman. His own ultimate
treason throws a shadow on his earlier loyalty; and his talent was fully equal to so ingenious
a fraud. He had placed the king in a position from which no escape was possible that was not
open to grave objection. To pardon so heavy an offender was to violate the first duty of government,
and to grant a general licence to Irish criminality; to execute him was to throw a shadow indirectly
on the king's good faith, and lay his generals open to a charge of treachery. Henry resolved
to err on the side on which error was least injurious. The difficulty was submitted to the
Duke of Norfolk, as of most experience in Irish matters. The duke advised that execution should
be delayed; but added significantly, "quod defertur non aufertur."--Pardon was not to be thought
of; the example would be fatal.[380] Immediate punishment would injure the credit of Lord Grey,
and would give occasion for slander against the council.[381] The best course would be to keep
"the traitor" in safe prison, and execute him, should it seem good, at a future time.[382]
This advice was followed. Fitzgerald, with his uncles, who had all been implicated in the insurrection,
was committed to the Tower; and in the year following they were hanged at Tyburn.

So ended the rebellion in Ireland; significant chiefly because it was the first in which an
outbreak against England assumed the features of a war of religion, the first which the pope
was especially invited to bless, and the Catholic powers, as such, to assist. The features
of it, on a narrow scale, were identical with those of the later risings. Fostered by the hesitation
of the home authorities, it commenced in bravado and murder; it vanished before the first blows
of substantial resistance. Yet the suppression of the insurrection was attended by the usual
Irish fatality: mistake and incompleteness followed the proceedings from the beginning to the
end; and the consciousness remained that a wound so closed would not heal, that the moral temper
of the country remained unaffected, and that the same evils would again germinate.

Ibid. It seems in many cases to have been the result of accident, Irish lands descending to
heiresses who married into English families. In other instances, forfeited estates were granted
by the crown to English favourites. The receiving rents, however, even though by unwilling
absentees, was treated as a crime by Henry VIII.; and English noblemen, to whom estates in
Ireland had fallen, either by marriage or descent, on which they were unable to reside, were
expected to grant such estates to other persons who were able to reside upon them, and willing.
The wording of the Act of Absentees, passed in 1536, is very remarkable. "Forasmuch as it is
notorious and manifest that this the king's land of Ireland, heretofore being inhabited, and
in due obedience and subjection unto the king's most noble progenitors, hath principally grown
unto ruin, dissolution, rebellion, and decay, by occasion that great dominions, lands, and
possessions within the same, as well by the king's grants as by course of inheritance and otherwise
have descended to noblemen of the realm of England, who having the same, demouring within the
said realm of England ... taking the profits of their said lands and possessions for a season,
without provision making for any defence or keeping thereof in good order ... in their absence,
and by their negligence have suffered the wild Irishrie, being mortal and natural enemies to
the Kings of England, to enter and hold the same without resistance; the conquest and winning
whereof in the beginning not only cost the king's noble progenitors charges inestimable, but
also those to whom the land was given, then and many years after abiding within the said land,
nobly and valiantly defended the same, and kept such tranquillity and good order, as the Kings
of England had due subjection of the inhabitants thereof, and the laws were obeyed ... and
after the gift or descent of the lands to the persons aforesaid, they and their heirs absented
themselves out of the said land of Ireland, not pondering nor regarding the preservation thereof
... the King's Majesty that now is, intending the reformation of the said land, to foresee
that the like shall not ensue hereafter, with the consent of his parliament," pronounces FORFEITED
the estates of all absentee proprietors, and their right and title gone.

[283] "The MacMahons in the north were anciently English, to wit, descended from the Fitz-Ursulas,
which was a noble family in England; and the same appeareth by the significance of their Irish
names. Likewise the M'Sweenies, now in Ulster, were recently of the Veres in England; but that
they themselves, for hatred of the English, so disguised their names." Spenser's View of the
State of Ireland. So the De Burghs became Bourkes or Burkes; the Munster Geraldines merged
their family names in that of Desmond; and a younger branch of them called themselves M'Shehies.

[285] The phenomenon must have been observed, and the inevitable consequence of it foreseen,
very close upon the Conquest, when the observation digested itself into a prophecy. No story
less than three hundred years old could easily have been reported to Baron Finglas as having
originated with St. Patrick and St. Columb. The Baron says--"The four Saints, St. Patrick,
St. Columb, St. Braghan, and St. Moling, many hundred years agone, made prophecy that Englishmen
should conquer Ireland; and said that the said Englishmen should keep the land in prosperity
as long as they should keep their own laws; and as soon as they should leave and fall to Irish
order, then they should decay."--Harris, p. 88.

with praises to gentlemen in the English pale, praising in rhymes, otherwise called 'danes,'
their extortions, robberies, and abuses as valiantness; which rejoiceth them in their evil
doings, and procures a talent of Irish disposition and conversation in them."--Cowley to Cromwell:

the State of Ireland.

an Irish captain keepeth and preserveth the king's subjects in peace without hurt of their
enemies; inasmuch as some of those hath tribute yearly of English men ... not to the intent

[292] Eudoxus--What is that which you call the Brehon Law? It is a word unto us altogether unknown.

Irenæus--It is a rule of right, unwritten, but delivered by tradition from one to another,
in which oftentimes there appeareth great show of equity in determining the right between parties,
but in many things repugning quite both to God's law and man's. As, for example, in the case
of murder, the Brehon, that is, their judge, will compound between the murderer and the friends
of the party murdered, which prosecute the action, that the malefactor shall give unto them
or unto the child or wife of him that is slain, a recompence which they call an Eriarch. By
which vile law of theirs many murders are made up and smothered. And this judge being, as he
is called, the Lord's Brehon, adjudgeth, for the most part, a better share unto his Lord, that
is the Lord of the soil, or the head of that sept, and also unto himself for his judgment,
a greater portion than unto the plaintiffs or parties grieved.--Spenser's View of the State
of Ireland. Spenser describes the system as he experienced it in active operation. Ancient
written collections of the Brehon laws, however, existed and still exist.

[293] By relation of ancient men in times past within remembrance, all the English lords and
gentills within the pale heretofore kept retinues of English yeomen in their houses, after
the English fashion, according to the extent of their lands, to the great strength and succour
of their neighbours the king's subjects. And now for the most part they keep horsemen and knaves,
which live upon the king's subjects; and keep in manner no hospitality, but live upon the poor.--The
Council of Ireland to the Master of the Rolls, 1533: State Papers, Vol. II. p. 163.

[296] The deputy useth to make great rodes, journeys, and hostings, now in the north parts
of Ulster, now in the south parts of Munster, now in the west parts of Connaught, and taketh
the king's subjects with him by compulsion oft times, with victual for three or four weeks,
and chargeth the common people with carriage of the same, and giveth licence to all the noble
folk to cesse and rear their costs on the common people and on the king's poor subjects; and
the end of that journey is commonly no other in effect, but that the deputy useth to receive
a reward of one or two hundred kyne to himself, and so depart, without any more hurt to the
king's enemies, after that he hath turned the king's subjects and the poor common folk to their
charge and costs of two or three thousand pounds. And over that, the deputy, on his progress
and regress, oppresseth the king's poor common folk with horse meat and man's meat to all his
host. And over that, in summer, when grass is most plenty, they must have oats or malt to their
horse at will, or else money therefor.

The premises considered, some saith the king's deputy, by extortion, chargeth the king's poor
subjects and common folk, in horse meat and man's meat, by estimation, to the value of a hundred
pound every day in the year, one day counted with another, which cometh to the sum of 36,000
pounds yearly.--State Papers, Vol. II. p. 13. Finglas says that coyne and livery would destroy
hell itself, if it was used there.--Finglas's Breviate.

[297] The wretchedness of the country drove the Irish to emigrate in multitudes. In 1524, twenty
thousand of them had settled themselves in Pembrokeshire; and the majority of these had crossed
in a single twelvemonth. They brought with them Irish manners, and caused no little trouble.
"The king's town of Tenby," wrote a Welsh gentleman to Wolsey, "is almost clean Irish, as well
the head men and rulers as the commons of the said town; and of their high and presumptuous
minds [they] do disobey all manner the king's process that cometh to them out of the king's
exchequer of Pembroke."--R. Gryffith to Cardinal Wolsey: Ellis, first series, Vol. I. p. 191, &c.

  Report of Gonzalo Fernandez.

  "April 28, 1529.

"On arriving at the coast of Ireland we touched at a port belonging to the King of England
named Cork. Many of the Irish people came on board the ship, and told me that the gentleman
of the Earl of Desmond had just returned from Spain with presents from the Emperor to the earl.

"Leaving Cork, we were driven by bad weather into another harbour called Beran,[A] from whence
I sent one of my servants to inform the earl of my arrival. In four days the earl's answer
came, telling me that I was welcome, and that he was at a place called Dingle, where he hoped
to see me. He addressed his letter to me as 'Chaplain of our Sovereign Lord the Emperor;' and
this, I understand, is his usual mode of expression when speaking of his Majesty. He had also
sent to some of the other noblemen of the country, with whom he proposed to form a league,
to tell them of my arrival.

  [A] Beerhaven, perhaps.

"I set out again, and on the way five of the earl's people came to me to say that their master
had gone to a harbour a few miles off to capture some French and English vessels there, and
would be glad of my assistance. This I declined, and the earl, I understand, was satisfied
with my excuses.

"The day after, the 21st of April, we reached the said harbour of Dingle, and were honourably
received by the townspeople, and by a party of the earl's attendants. About four o'clock the
earl returned himself, attended by fifty horse and as many halberdiers. He came at once to
my quarters, and asked after the welfare of 'our Lord the Emperor.' I replied that, by the
grace of God, his Majesty was well, and I had sent his commendations to his lordship.

"We then dined; and afterwards the earl and his council repaired to my chamber, where we presented
him with his Majesty's letter. He read it and his council read it. His Majesty, he said, referred
him to me. I was commissioned to make known his Majesty's pleasure to him. I at once declared
my instructions, first in English to the earl, and afterward in Latin to his council; which
I said were to this effect.

"'One Godfrey, a friend of their lord, had lately presented himself to the Emperor with their
lord's letter, in which their lord, after speaking of the good-will and affection which he
entertained towards the Emperor's Majesty, had expressed a desire to enter into close alliance
with his Majesty, as friend to friend and enemy to enemy, declaring himself ready, in all things
and at all times, to obey his Majesty's commands.

"'Further, the said Godfrey had requested the Emperor to send a confidential person to Ireland,
to learn more particularly their lord's intentions, and his resources and power; and further,
to negotiate a treaty and establish a firm and complete alliance. For these purposes the Emperor
commissioned myself. I was the bearer to them of his Majesty's thanks for their proposals,
and I said I was so far in my master's confidence that I was assured their lord might expect
all possible assistance at the Emperor's hands.'

"When I had done, the earl spoke a few words to his council. He then took off his cap, and
said he thanked his Majesty for his gracious condescension. He had addressed himself to his
Majesty as to his sovereign lord, to entreat his protection. His Majesty was placed in this
world in his high position, in order that no one prince might oppress or injure another. He
related his descent to me. He said that, between his family and the English, there had ever
existed a mortal enmity, and he explained the cause to me.

"I replied that his Majesty never failed to support his allies and his subjects, and should
he claim assistance in that capacity, his Majesty would help him as he helped all his other
good friends. I advised the earl to put in writing the words which he had used to me. He thought
it would be enough if I repeated them; but when I said the story was too long, and my memory
might not retain it with accuracy, he said he would do as I desired.

"We then spoke of the support for which he was looking, of his projects and resources, and
of the places in which he proposed to serve. He said he wanted from his Majesty four large
vessels, two hundred tons each, six pinnaces well provided with artillery, and five hundred
Flemings to work them. I said at once and earnestly, that such a demand was out of all reason,
before he, on his part, had achieved something in his Majesty's service. I remonstrated fully
and largely, although, to avoid being tedious, I omit the details. In the end his council were
satisfied that he must reduce his demands till his Majesty had more reason to know what was
to be expected from him, and he consented, as will be seen by his own memoir.

"Of all men in the world the earl hates most deeply the Cardinal of York. He told me he had
been in alliance with France, and had a relation called De Quindel, now with the French army
in Italy. In future, he said he would have no dealings with the French. As your Majesty's enemies,
they were his enemies.

"Your Majesty will be pleased to understand that there are in Ireland four principal cities.
The city of Dublin is the largest and richest in the island, and neither in the town nor in
the neighbourhood has the Earl of Desmond land or subjects. The Earl of Kildare is sovereign
in that district, but that earl is a kinsman of the Earl of Desmond, and has married his cousin.

"The Earl of Kildare, however, is at present a prisoner in the Tower of London.

"Of the other three cities, one is called Waterford, the second Cork, the third Limerick; and
in all of these the Earl of Desmond has lordships and vassals. He has dominions, also, among
the wild tribes; he has lords and knights on his estates who pay him tribute. He has some allies,
but not so many, by a great deal, as he has enemies.

"He has ten castles of his own, some of which are strong and well built, especially one named
Dungarvan, which the King has often attempted to take without success.

"The earl himself is from thirty to forty years old, and is rather above the middle height.
He keeps better justice throughout his dominions than any other chief in Ireland. Robbers and
homicides find no mercy, and are executed out of hand. His people are in high order and discipline.
They are armed with short bows and swords. The earl's guard are in a mail from neck to heel,
and carry halberds. He has also a number of horse, some of whom know how to break a lance.
They all ride admirably without saddle or stirrup."

       *       *       *       *       *

After the report of Gonzalvo Fernandez, Desmond himself continues in Latin.

"Hereunto be added informations addressed to the invincible and most sacred Cæsar, ever august,
by the Earl of Desmond, Lord of Ogonyll and the liberties of Kilcrygge.

"I, James Earl of Desmond, am of royal blood, and of the race of the Conqueror who did lawfully
subdue Britain, great and small, and did reduce Scotland and Ireland under his yoke.

"The first cause of the enmity between myself and the King of England is in ancient prophecy
or prediction, believed by the English nation, and written in their books and chronicles, that
all England will be conquered by an Earl of Desmond, which enterprise I have not yet undertaken.

"The second cause is that, through fear of this prophecy, the King of England has committed
his powers to my predecessors who have borne rule in Ireland; and when Thomas Earl of Desmond,
my grandfather, in peaceable manner attended Parliament in Ireland, no cause being alleged
against him, but merely in dread of the prophecy, they struck off his head.

"The third cause is that, when Richard, son of the King of England [sic], heard that there
were ancient feuds between the English and my predecessors, he came to Ireland with an army
and a great fleet in the time of my father; and then did my father make all Ireland to be subdued
unto himself, some few towns only excepted.

"The fourth cause is that, by reason of the aforesaid feuds, the King of England did cause
Gerald Earl of Kildare, my father's kinsman, to be destroyed in prison [destrui in carceribus]
until that my father, by might and power, did liberate the said Earl of Kildare, and did obtain
his own purposes, and did make his kinsman viceroy of Ireland.

"The fifth cause is that, when peace was hardly begun between my aforesaid father and the King
of England, a certain sickness fell upon my father, I myself being then eight years old.

"The King, when he heard this, made a league of Irish and English to kill my father; he being
then, as they thought, unable to take the field. They, being banded together, made war against
my father for twenty-four years, wherein, by God's grace, they had small success.

"The sixth cause is that, when peace was made at last between the King that now is and myself,
I, in faith of the said peace, sent certain of my servants to the parts beyond the seas to
Flanders and France, and the attorneys of the King of England did despoil my servants of the
sum of 9000l., and threw them into prison, where they now remain.

"Hereon follows my supplication:--

"These things premised, I, the aforesaid earl, do implore and entreat the invincible and most
sacred Majesty of Cæsar Augustus that he will deign to provide me with remedy, and I, with
all my horses and people, do devote myself to your Majesty's service, seeing that your Majesty
is appointed for the welfare of the oppressed, and to be lord paramount of all the earth.

"To revenge the injuries done to myself and my family by the King of England, I have the following
powers; that is to say, 16,500 foot and 1500 horse. Also I have friends, confederate with me,
whose names be these--

  "1. The Prince O'Brien, who can make 600 horse and 1000 foot.
   2. Trobal de Burgh             "    100      "     600  "
   3. Sir Richard Poer            "     40      "     200  "
   4. Lord Thomas Butler          "     60      "     240  "
   5. Sir John Galty              "     80      "     400  "
   6. Sir Gerald Fitzgerald       "     40      "     200  "
   7. The White Knight            "    400      "     800  "
   8. O'Donnell, Prince of Ulster "    800      "    4000  "
   9. The Knight of the Valley    "     40      "     240  "
  10. Baron MacMys                "     40      "     500  "
  11. Captain Macguire            "     30      "     200  "

"With divers others whose names be here omitted.

"Moreover, I, the aforesaid James Earl of Desmond, do make known to the Majesty of Cæsar august,
that there is an alliance between me and the King of Scotland, and, by frequent embassies,
we understand each other's purposes and intentions.

"Finally, divine grace permitting, I intend to gather together my own and my friends' powers,
and lead them in person against Piers Butler, deputy of the King of England, and against Limerick,
Wexford, and Dublin, the cities which the King holds in Ireland.

"For the aid for which I look from your Majesty, I desire especially cannon available for land
service and fit for breaching castles. May it please your Majesty, therefore, to send me cannon,
that I may be the better able to do your Majesty service.

"And for myself, I promise on my faith to obey your Majesty in all things. I will be friend
of your friends; enemy of your enemies; and your Majesty's especial and particular subject.
If ever I chance to displease you, I will submit myself to your correction and chastisement.

"Written in my town, this 28th day of April, 1529, in the presence of Gonzalvo Fernandez, Denys
Mac D----c, Doctor of Arms and Medicine, Denys Tathe, Maurice Herly.

  JAMES OF DESMOND."

[313] "You remember how the lewd earl your kinsman," he said to him, "who passeth not whom
he serve, might he change his master, sent his confederates with letters of credence to Francis
the French King, and to Charles the Emperor, proffering the help of Munster and Connaught towards
the conquest of Ireland, if either of them would help to win it from our king. What precepts,
what messages have been sent you to apprehend him? and yet not done. Why so? Forsooth I could
not catch him. Yea, sir, it will be sworn and deposed to your face, that for fear of meeting
him, you have winked, wilfully shunned his sight, altered your course, warned his friends,
stopped both eyes and ears against his detection. Surely this juggling and false play little
became an honest man called to such honour, or a nobleman put in such trust."--Campion, p. 165.

[324] It is remarkable that, as I believe, there is no instance of the act of heresy having
been put in force in Ireland. The Irish Protestant church counts many martyrs; but they were
martyrs who fell by murder in the later massacres. So far as I can learn, no Protestant was
ever tried and executed there by form of law.

[328] Cork and Waterford continued loyal. The mayor of the latter place wrote, on the 12th
of July, to Cromwell as follows: "This instant day, report is made by the Vicar of Dungarvan,
that the emperour hath sent certain letters unto the Earl of Desmond, by the same chaplain
or ambassador that was sent to James the late earl. And the common bruit is, that his practice
is to win the Geraltynes and the Breenes; and that the emperour intendeth shortly to send an
army to invade the cities and towns by the sea coasts of this land. This thing was spoken by
a Spaniard more than a month agone to one of the inhabitants of this city; and because I thought
it then somewhat incredible, I forbare at that time to write unto your wisdom thereof. The
chaplain arrived more than fifteen days past at the Dingle, in the dominion of the said Earl,
which Earl hath, for the victualling of his castle of Dungarvan, taken a ship charged with
Spanish wines, that was bound to the town of Galway; and albeit that his years requireth quietness
and rest, yet intendeth he as much trouble as ever did any of his nation."--William Wise, Mayor
of Waterford, to Cromwell, July 12, 1534: State Papers, Vol. II. p. 198.

[329] On the 21st of July, O'Brien of Thomond wrote the following characteristic letter to
Charles:--

  Corny O'Brien, Prince of Ireland, to the Emperor Charles V.

  "July 21, 1534.

"To the most sacred and most invincible Cæsar, Charles Emperor of the Romans, Most Catholic
King of Spain, health with all submission.--Most sacred Cæsar, lord most clement, we give your
Majesty to know that our predecessors for a long time quietly and peacefully occupied Ireland,
with constancy, force, and courage, and without rebellion. They possessed and governed this
country in manner royal, as by our ancient chronicles doth plainly appear. Our said predecessors
and ancestry did come from your Majesty's realm of Spain, where they were of the blood of a
Spanish prince, and many Kings of that lineage, in long succession, governed all Ireland happily,
until it was conquered by the English. The last King of this land was of my blood and name;
and ever since that time our ancestors, and we ourselves, have ceased not to oppose the English
intruders; we have never been subject to English rule, or yielded up our ancient rights and
liberties; and there is at this present, and for ever will be, perpetual discord between us,
and we will harass them with continual war.

"For this cause, we, who till this present, have sworn fealty to no man, submit ourselves,
our lands, our families, our followers, to the protection and defence of your Majesty, and
of free will and deliberate purpose we promise to obey your Majesty's orders and commands in
all honest behests. We will serve your Majesty with all our force; that is to say, with 1660
horse and 2440 foot, equipped and armed. Further, we will levy and direct for your Majesty's
use 13,000 men, well armed with harquebuss, bows, arrows, and swords. We will submit to your
Majesty's will and jurisdiction more than a hundred castles, and they and all else shall be
at your Majesty's disposition to be employed as you shall direct.

"We can undertake also for the assistance and support of our good brother the Earl of Desmond,
whose cousin, the daughter of the late Earl James, your Majesty's friend, is our wife.

"Our further pleasure will be declared to you by our servants and friends, Robert and Dominic
de Paul, to whom your Majesty will deign to give credence. May your Majesty be ever prosperous.

"Written at our Castle at Clare, witness, our daughter, July 21, 1534, by your humble servant
and unfailing friend,

which is the danger of their destruction. They have lost such a wind and fair weather, as I
doubt they shall not have again for this winter season. Mr. Brereton (Sir William Brereton,
Skeffington's second in command) lieth here at the sea side in a readiness. If their first
appointment to Dublin had been kept, they might have been there; but now they tarry to pass
with the deputy. Sir, for the love of God, let some aid be sent to Dublin; for the loss of
that city and the castle were the plain subversion of the land."--Allen to Cromwell, Oct. 4:

[354] Skeffington was prudently reserved in his report of these things to Henry. He mentions
having set a party on shore, but says nothing of their having been destroyed; and he could
not have been ignorant of their fate, for he was writing three weeks after it, from Dublin.
He was silent, too, of the injury which he had received from the pirates, though eloquent on
the boats which he burnt at the Skerries.--State Papers, Vol. II. p. 205. On first reading
Skeffington's despatch, I had supposed that the "brilliant victory" claimed by the Irish historians
(see Leland, Vol. II. p. 148) must have been imaginary. The Irish Statute Book, however, is
too explicit to allow of such a hope. "He [Fitzgerald] not only fortified and manned divers
ships at sea, for keeping and letting, destroying and taking the king's deputy, army, and subjects,
that they should not land within the said land; but also at the arrival of the said army, the
same Thomas, accompanied with his uncles, servants, adherents, &c., falsely and traitorously
assembled themselves together upon the sea coast, for keeping and resisting the king's deputy
and army; and the same time they shamefully murdered divers of the said army coming to land.

after that assaulted Dunboyne, within six miles to Dublin; and the inhabitants of the town

[362] The captains and I, the Earl (of Ossory) directed letters to the deputy to meet us in

without fail to meet. At which day and place the said Earl, with the army (of) Waterford failed
not to be, and there did abide three days continually for the deputy; where he, neither any
of the army, came not, ne any letter or word was had from him; but only that Sir James Fitzgerald
told that he heard say he was sick.--Ossory to W. Cowley: State Papers, Vol. II. p. 251.

[363] Allen certainly thought so, or at least was unable to assure himself that it was not
so. "My simple advice shall be," he wrote, "that if ever the king intend to show him grace
(which himself demandeth not in due manner) and to pardon him, to withdraw his charges and
to pardon him out of hand; or else to send hither a proclamation under the Great Seal of England,
that the king never intends to pardon him ne any that shall take part with him, but utterly
to prosecute both him and them to their utter confusion. For the gentlemen of the country hath
said plainly to divers of the council, that until this be done, they dare not be earnest in
resisting him, in doubt, he should have his pardon hereafter, as his grandfather, his father,
and divers his ancestors have had; and then would prosecute them for the same."--State Papers,

which were first cast in England in the year of its capture.--Stow, p. 572. When the history
of artillery is written, Henry VIII.'s labours in this department must not be forgotten. Two
foreign engineers whom he tempted into his service, first invented "shells." "One Peter Baud,
a Frenchman born," says Stow, "and another alien, called Peter Van Collen, a gunsmith, both
the king's feed men, conferring together, devised and caused to be made certain mortar pieces,
being at the mouth from eleven inches unto nineteen inches wide, for the use whereof they [also]
caused to be made certain hollow shot of cast iron, to be stuffed with fire-work or wildfire;
whereof the bigger sort for the same had screws of iron to receive a match to carry fire kindled,
that the firework might be set on fire for to break in pieces the same hollow shot, whereof
the smallest piece hitting any man would kill or spoil him."--Stow, Chronicle, p. 584.

CHAPTER IX.

THE CATHOLIC MARTYRS.

[Sidenote: State of England in the summer of 1534.]

While the disturbance in Ireland was at its height, affairs in England had been scarcely less
critical. The surface indeed remained unbroken. The summer of 1534 passed away, and the threatened
invasion had not taken place. The disaffection which had appeared in the preceding year had
been smothered for a time; Francis I. held the emperor in check by menacing Flanders, and through
French influence the rupture with Scotland had been seemingly healed. In appearance the excommunication
had passed off as a brutum fulmen, a flash of harmless sheet lightning, serving only to dazzle
feeble eyes. The oath of succession, too, had been taken generally through the country; Sir
Thomas More and Bishop Fisher having alone ventured to refuse. The pope had been abjured by
the universities and by the convocation in both the provinces, and to these collective acts
the bishops and the higher clergy had added each their separate consent.

[Sidenote: The clergy comply with the revolution, but inwardly have little heart for it.]

[Sidenote: They bend before the storm, trusting to time.]

[Sidenote: The clergy are called upon to explain to the people the changes which have taken place.]

But the government knew too well the temper of the clergy to trust to outward compliance, or
to feel assured that they acquiesced at heart either in the separation from Rome, or in the
loss of their treasured privileges. The theory of an Anglican Erastianism found favour with
some of the higher church dignitaries, and with a section perhaps of secular priests; but the
transfer to the crown of the first-fruits, which in their original zeal for a free Church of
England the ecclesiastics had hoped to preserve for themselves, the abrupt limitation of the
powers of convocation, and the termination of so many time-honoured and lucrative abuses, had
interfered with the popularity of a view which might have been otherwise broadly welcomed;
and while growing vigorously among the country gentlemen and the middle classes in the towns,
among the clergy it throve only within the sunshine of the court. The rest were overawed for
the moment, and stunned by the suddenness of the blows which had fallen upon them. As far as
they thought at all, they believed that the storm would be but of brief duration, that it would
pass away as it had risen, and that for the moment they had only to bend. The modern Englishman
looks back upon the time with the light of after history. He has been inured by three centuries
of division to the spectacle of a divided church, and sees nothing in it either embarrassing
or fearful. The ministers of a faith which had been for fifteen centuries as the seamless vesture
of Christ, the priests of a church supposed to be founded on the everlasting rock against which
no power could prevail, were in a very different position. They obeyed for the time the strong
hand which was upon them, trusting to the interference of accident or providence. They comforted
themselves with the hope that the world would speedily fall back into its old ways, that Christ
and the saints would defend the church against sacrilege, and that in the meantime there was
no occasion for them to thrust themselves upon voluntary martyrdom.[383] But this position,
natural as it was, became difficult to maintain when they were called upon not only themselves
to consent to the changes, but to justify their consent to their congregations, and to explain
to the people the grounds on which the government had acted. The kingdom was by implication
under an interdict,[384] yet the services went on as usual; the king was excommunicated; doubt
hung over the succession; the facts were imperfectly known; and the never-resting friars mendicant
were busy scattering falsehood and misrepresentation. It was of the highest moment that on
all these important matters the mind of the nation should if possible be set at rest; and the
clergy, whose loyalty was presumed rather than trusted, furnished the only means by which the
government could generally and simultaneously reach the people. The clergy therefore, as we
have seen, were called upon for their services; the pope's name was erased from the mass; books;
the statute of appeals and the statute of succession were fixed against the doors of every
parish church in England, and the rectors and curates were directed every week in their sermons
to explain the meaning of these acts. The bishops were held responsible for the obedience of
the clergy; the sheriffs and the magistrates had been directed to keep an eye upon the bishops;
and all the machinery of centralization was put in force to compel the fulfilment of a duty
which was well known to be unwelcome.

[Sidenote: The order for preaching. Every preacher to deliver one sermon against the papal
usurpation.]

[Sidenote: The archbishop's sentence to be held a thing of mere verity, not to be again called
in question.]

[Sidenote: The clergy are forbidden to preach upon disputed points of doctrine.]

That as little latitude as possible might be left for resistance or evasion, books were printed
by order of council, and distributed through the hands of the bishops, containing a minute
account of the whole proceedings on the divorce, the promises and falsehoods of the pope, the
opinions of the European universities, and a general epitome of the course which had been pursued.[385]
These were to be read aloud to the congregations; and an order for preaching was at the same
time circulated, in which the minuteness of the directions is as remarkable as the prudence
of them. Every preacher was to deliver one sermon at least ("and after at his liberty") on
the encroachments and usurpations of the papal power. He was to preach against it, to expose
and refute it to the best of his ability, and to declare that it was done away, and might neither
be obeyed nor defended further. Again in all places "where the king's just cause in his matter
of matrimony had been detracted, and the incestuous and unjust [matrimony] had been set forth
[and extolled]," the clergy were generally directed "to open and declare the mere verity and
justice" of the matter, declaring it "neither doubtful nor disputable," but to be a thing of
mere verity, and so to be allowed of all men's opinions. They were to relate in detail the
pope's conduct, his many declarations in the king's favour; the first decretal, which was withheld
by Campeggio, in which he had pronounced the marriage with Catherine invalid; his unjust avocation
of the cause to Rome; his promises to the King of France; and finally, his engagement at Marseilles
to pronounce in the King of England's favour, if only he would acknowledge the papal jurisdiction.[386]
They were therefore to represent the king's conduct as the just and necessary result of the
pope's duplicity. These things the clergy were required to teach, not as matters of doubt and
question, but as vital certainties on which no difference of opinion could be tolerated. Finally,
there were added a few wholesome admonitions on other subjects, which mark the turning of the
tide from Catholic orthodoxy. The clergy were interdicted from indulging any longer in the
polemics of theology. "To keep unity and quietness in the realm it" was "ordained that no preachers"
should "contend openly in the pulpit one against another, nor uncharitably deprave one another
in open audience. If any of them" were "grieved one with another," they were to "complain to
the King's Highness or the archbishop or bishop of the diocese." They were "purely, sincerely,
and justly" to "preach the scripture and words of Christ, and not mix them with men's institutions,
or make men believe that the force of God's law and man's law was the like." On subjects such
as purgatory, worship of saints and relics, marriage of the clergy, justification by faith,
pilgrimages and miracles, they were to keep silence for one whole year, and not to preach at
all.[387]

[Sidenote: Difficulty of securing obedience to the order. Obstructiveness of the bishops,]

[Sidenote: And of the regular clergy.]

These instructions express distinctly the convictions of the government. It would have been
well if the clergy could have accepted them as they were given, and submitted their understandings
once for all to statesmen who were wiser than themselves. The majority (of the parish clergy
at least) were perhaps outwardly obedient; but the surveillance which the magistrates were
directed to exercise proves that the exceptions were expected to be extensive; and in many
quarters these precautions themselves were rapidly discovered to be inadequate. Several even
of the most trusted among the bishops attempted an obstructive resistance. The clergy of the
north were notoriously disobedient. The Archbishop of York was reported to have talked loosely
of "standing against" the king "unto death."[388] The Bishop of Durham fell under suspicion,
and was summoned to London. His palace was searched and his papers examined in his absence;
and the result, though inconclusive, was unsatisfactory.[389] The religious orders again (especially
the monks of such houses as had been implicated with the Nun of Kent) were openly recusant.
At the convent at Sion, near Richmond, a certain Father Ricot preached as he was commanded,
"but he made this addition, that he which commanded him to preach should discharge his conscience:
and as soon," it was said, "as the said Ricot began to declare the king's title," "nine of
the brethren departed from the sermon, contrary to the rule of their religion, to the great
slander of the audience."[390] Indeed it soon became evident that among the regular clergy
no compliance whatever was to be looked for; and the agents of the government began to contemplate
the possible consequences, with a tenderness not indeed for the prospective sufferers, but
for the authorities whom they would so cruelly compel to punish them. "I am right sorry," wrote
Cromwell's secretary to him, "to see the foolishness and obstinacy of divers religious men,
so addict to the Bishop of Rome and his usurped power, that they contemn counsel as careless
men and willing to die. If it were not for the opinion which men had, and some yet have, in
their apparent holiness, it made no great matter what became of them, so their souls were saved.
And for my part, I would that all such obstinate persons of them as be ready to die for the
advancement of the Bishop of Rome's authority were dead indeed by God's hand, that no man should
run wrongfully into obloquy for their just punishment."[391]

[Sidenote: Powers of the confessional.]

[Sidenote: The clergy in some cases advise their penitents to take the oaths with a mental
reservation.]

But the open resistance of mistaken honesty was not the danger which the government most feared.
Another peril threatened their authority, deeper and more alarming by far. The clergy possessed
in the confessional a power of secret influence over the masses of the people, by which they
were able at once (if they so pleased) to grant their penitents licences for insincerity, to
permit them to perjure themselves under mental reservations, and to encourage them to expiate
a venial falsehood by concealed disaffection. The secrets of confession were inviolable. Anathemas
the most fearful forbade their disclosure; and, secured behind this impenetrable shield, the
church might defy the most stringent provisions, and baffle every precaution.

From the nature of the case but little could transpire of the use or the abuse which was made
at such a time of so vast a power; but Cromwell, whose especial gift it was to wind himself
into the secrets of the clergy, had his sleuth-hounds abroad, whose scent was not easily baffled.
The long tyranny of the priesthood produced also its natural retribution in the informations
which were too gladly volunteered in the hour of revenge; and more than one singular disclosure
remains among the State Papers, of language used in this mysterious intercourse. Every man
who doubted whether he might lawfully abjure the pope, consulted his priest. Haughton, the
Prior of Charterhouse, in all such cases, declared absolutely that the abjuration might not
be made.[392] He himself refused openly; and it is likely that he directed others to be as
open as himself. But Haughton's advice was as exceptional as his conduct. Father Forest, of
Greenwich, who was a brave man, and afterwards met nobly a cruel death, took the oath to the
king as he was required; while he told a penitent that he had abjured the pope in the outward,
but not in the inward man, that he "owed an obedience to the pope which he could not shake
off," and that it was "his use and practice in confession, to induce men to hold and stick
to the old fashion of belief."[393]

[Sidenote: Confession of John Staunton.]

Here, again, is a conversation which a treacherous penitent revealed to Cromwell; the persons
in the dialogue being the informer, John Staunton, and the confessor of Sion Monastery, who
had professed the most excessive loyalty to the crown.[394] The informer, it must be allowed,
was a good-for-nothing person. He had gone to the confessor, he said, to be shriven, and had
commenced his confession with acknowledging "the seven deadly sins particularly," "and next
the misspending of his five wits." As an instance of the latter, he then in detail had confessed
to heresy; he could not persuade himself that the priest had power to forgive him. "Sir," he
professed to have said to the confessor, "there is one thing in my stomach which grieveth my
conscience very sore; and that is by reason of a sermon I heard yesterday of Master Latimer,
saying that no man of himself had authority to forgive sins, and that the pope had no more
authority than another bishop; and therefore I am in doubt whether I shall have remission of
my sins of you or not, and that the pardon is of no effect."

The priest answered, "That Latimer is a false knave;" and seven or eight times he called him
false knave, and said he was an eretycke. "Marry, this I heard Latimer say," the confessor
continued, "that if a man come to confession, and be not sorry for his sins, the priest hath
no power to forgive him. I say the pope's pardon is as good as ever it was; and he is the Head
of the Universal Church, and so I will take him. Here in England the king and his parliament
hath put him out; but be of good comfort, and steadfast in your faith; this thing will not
last long, I warrant you. You shall see the world change shortly."

To this the informer said that he had replied, "You know how that we be sworn unto the King's
Grace, and he hath already abjured the pope."

[Sidenote: The confessor thinks that an oath loosely made may be loosely broken.]

[Sidenote: Reported advice of Cranmer to the confessor of Sion.]

"As for that," said the priest, "an oath loosely made may be loosely broken; and by this example
be ye in ease. I had an enemy come unto this church, and one of his friends and mine came unto
me and said, 'Sir, I pray you let us go drink with yonder man.' And the said friend maketh
such importunate suit unto me to drink with my enemy, that I promise him by my faith that I
will go and drink with him; and so indeed doth drink with him. But what then," said the priest;
"though I go and drink with him upon this promise, trow you that I will forgive him with my
heart. Nay, nay, I warrant you. And so in like wise in this oath concerning the abjuration
of the pope. I will not abjure him in my heart," said the priest, "for these words were not
spoken unto Peter for nought--'I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven'--and the
pope is Peter's successor. Of this matter," said the priest, "I communed once with the Bishop
of Canterbury,[395] and I told the bishop I would pray for the pope as the chief and papal
head of Christ's church. And the bishop told me it was the king's pleasure that I should not.
I said unto him I would do it; and though I did it not openly, yet would I do it secretly.
And he said I might pray for him secretly, but in any wise do it not openly."[396]

[Sidenote: Maitland the Black Friar, by his science of nigromancy, foretells a counter-revolution.]

Trifles of this kind may seem unimportant; but at the time they were of moment, for their weight
was cumulative; and we can only now recover but a few out of many. Such as they are, however,
they show the spirit in which the injunctions were received by a section at least of the English
clergy. Nor was this the worst. We find language reported, which shows that many among the
monks were watching for symptoms of the promised imperial invasion, and the progress of the
Irish insurgents. A Doctor Maitland, of the order of Black Friars in London, had been "heard
divers times to say, he trusted to see every man's head that was of the new learning, and the
maintainers of them, to stand upon a stake, and Cranmer's to be one of them. The king," he
hoped, might suffer "a violent and shameful death;" and "the queen, that mischievous whore,
might be brent." "He said further, that he knew by his science, which was nigromancy, that
all men of the new learning should be suppressed and suffer death, and the people of the old
learning should be set up again by the power of the king's enemies from the parts beyond the
sea."[397]

[Sidenote: Feron and Hale.]

[Sidenote: Feron hopes that Henry's death may be like that of the manqueller Richard.]

In the May weather of 1534, two Middlesex clergy, "walking to and fro in the cloyster garden
at Sion, were there overheard compassing sedition and rebellion." John Hale, an eager, tumultuous
person, was prompting his brother priest, Robert Feron, with matter for a pamphlet, which Feron
was to write against the king.[398] "Syth the realm of England was first a realm," said Hale,
"was there never in it so great a robber and piller of the commonwealth read of nor heard of
as is our king..... He is the most cruellest capital heretic, defacer and treader under foot
of Christ and of his church, continually applying and minding to extinct the same; whose death,
I beseech God, may be like to the death of the most wicked John, sometime king of this realm,
or rather to be called a great tyran than a king; and that his death may be not much unlike
to the end of that manqueller Richard, sometime usurper of this imperial realm. And if thou
wilt deeply look upon his life, thou shalt find it more foul and more stinking than a sow wallowing
and defiling herself in any filthy place."

[Sidenote: The Irish will persevere in the quarrel, and the Welsh will join them.]

[Sidenote: Three parts of England be against the king.]

These words were spoken in English; Feron translated them into Latin, and wrote them down.
Hale then continued: "Until the king and the rulers of this realm be plucked by the pates,
and brought, as we say, to the pot, shall we never live merrily in England, which, I pray God,
may chance, and now shortly come to pass. Ireland is set against him, which will never shrink
in their quarrel to die in it; and what think ye of Wales? The noble and gentle Ap Ryce,[399]
so cruelly put to death, and he innocent, as they say, in the cause. I think not contrary,
but they will join and take part with the Irish, and so invade our realm. If they do so, doubt
ye not but they shall have aid and strength enough in England. For this is truth: three parts
of England be against the king, as he shall find if he need. For of truth, they go about to
bring this realm into such miserable condition as is France; which the commons see, and perceive
well enough a sufficient cause of rebellion and insurrection in this realm. And truly we of
the church shall never live merrily until that day come."[400]

[Sidenote: The persecuting laws against the Catholics.]

These informations may assist us in understanding, if we cannot forgive, the severe enactments--severely
to be executed--which were passed in the ensuing parliament.

[Sidenote: Effect of circumstances upon policy.]

[Sidenote: A modern analogy.]

It is a maxim of sound policy, that actions only are a proper subject of punishment,--that
to treat men as offenders for their words, their intentions, or their opinions, is not justice,
but tyranny. But there is no rule which is universally applicable. The policy of a state of
war is not the policy of a state of peace. And as a soldier in a campaign is not at liberty
to criticise openly the cause for which he is fighting; as no general, on his army going into
action, can permit a subordinate to decline from his duty in the moment of danger, on the plea
that he is dissatisfied with the grounds of the quarrel, and that his conscience forbids him
to take part in it; so there are times when whole nations are in a position analogous to that
of an army so circumstanced; when the safety of the State depends upon unity of purpose, and
when private persons must be compelled to reserve their opinions to themselves; when they must
be compelled neither to express them in words, nor to act upon them in their capacity of citizens,
except at their utmost peril. At such times the salus populi overrides all other considerations;
and the maxims and laws of calmer periods for awhile consent to be suspended. The circumstances
of the year 1848 will enable us, if we reflect, not upon what those circumstances actually
were, but on what they easily might have been, to understand the position of Henry VIII.'s
government at the moment of the separation from Rome. If the danger in 1848 had ceased to be
imaginary,--if Ireland had broken into a real insurrection,--if half the population of England
had been Socialist, and had been in secret league with the leaders of the Revolution in Paris
for a combined attack upon the State by insurrection and invasion,--the mere passing of a law,
making the use of seditious language an act of treason, would not have been adequate to the
danger. Influential persons would have been justly submitted to question on their allegiance,
and insufficient answers would have been interpreted as justifying suspicion. Not the expression
only, of opinions subversive of society, but the holding such opinions, however discovered,
would have been regarded and treated as a crime, with the full consent of what is called the
common sense and educated judgment of the nation.[401]

[Sidenote: The Romanism of the sixteenth century not the Romanism of the nineteenth.]

If for "opinions subversive of society," we substitute allegiance to the papacy, the parallel
is complete between the year 1848, as it would then have been, and the time when the penal
laws which are considered the reproach of the Tudor governments were passed against the Roman
Catholics. I assume that the Reformation was in itself right; that the claims of the pope to
an English supremacy were unjust; and that it was good and wise to resist those claims. If
this be allowed, those laws will not be found to deserve the reproach of tyranny. We shall
see in them but the natural resource of a vigorous government placed in circumstances of extreme
peril. The Romanism of the present day is a harmless opinion, no more productive of evil than
any other superstition, and without tendency, or shadow of tendency, to impair the allegiance
of those who profess it. But we must not confound a phantom with a substance; or gather from
modern experience the temper of a time when words implied realities, when Catholics really
believed that they owed no allegiance to an heretical sovereign, and that the first duty of
their lives was to a foreign potentate. This perilous doctrine was waning, indeed, but it was
not dead. By many it was actively professed; and among those by whom it was denied there were
few except the Protestants whom it did not in some degree embarrass and perplex.

[Sidenote: The king is declared supreme Head of the Church.]

The government, therefore, in the close of 1534, having clear evidence before them of intended
treason, determined to put it down with a high hand; and with this purpose parliament met again
on the 3d of November. The first act of the session was to give the sanction of the legislature
to the title which had been conceded by convocation, and to declare the king supreme Head of
the Church of England. As affirmed by the legislature, this designation meant something more
than when it was granted three years previously by the clergy. It then implied that the spiritual
body were no longer to be an imperium in imperio within the realm, but should hold their powers
subordinate to the crown. It was now an assertion of independence of foreign jurisdiction;
it was the complement of the Act of Appeals, rounding off into completeness the constitution
in Church and State of the English nation. The act is short, and being of so great importance,
I insert it entire.

[Sidenote: Act of Supremacy.]

"Albeit," it runs, "the King's Majesty justly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme
Head of the Church of England, and so is recognised by the clergy of this realm in their convocation,
yet nevertheless, for corroboration and confirmation thereof, and for increase of virtue in
Christ's religion within this realm of England, and to repress and extirp all errours, heresies,
and other enormities and abuses heretofore used in the same: Be it enacted, by authority of
this present parliament, that the King our Sovereign Lord, his heirs and successors, kings
of this realm, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme Head in earth of the
Church of England, called Anglicana Ecclesia, and shall have and enjoy, annexed and united
to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the title and style thereof as all the honours,
dignities, pre-eminences, jurisdictions, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities,
to the said dignity belonging and appertaining; and that our said Sovereign Lord, his heirs
and successors, kings of this realm, shall have full power and authority to visit, repress,
redress, reform, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such errours, heresies, abuses, contempts,
and enormities, whatsoever they be, which by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction
ought or may lawfully be reformed--most to the pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of virtue
in Christ's religion, and for the conservation of the peace, unity, and tranquillity of this
realm--any usage, custom, foreign lawes, foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing
or things to the contrary hereof notwithstanding."[402]

[Sidenote: The meaning and value of the title.]

[Sidenote: It becomes the gage of the battle.]

Considerable sarcasm has been levelled at the assumption by Henry of this title; and on the
accession of Elizabeth, the crown, while reclaiming the authority, thought it prudent to retire
from the designation. Yet it answered a purpose in marking the nature of the revolution, and
the emphasis of the name carried home the change into the mind of the country. It was the epitome
of all the measures which had been passed against the encroachments of the spiritual powers
within and without the realm; it was at once the symbol of the independence of England, and
the declaration that thenceforth the civil magistrate was supreme within the English dominions
over church as well as state.[403]

Whether the king was or was not head of the church, became now therefore the rallying point
of the struggle; and the denial or acceptance of his title the test of allegiance or disloyalty.
To accept it was to go along with the movement heartily and completely; to deny it was to admit
the rival sovereignty of the pope, and with his sovereignty the lawfulness of the sentence
of excommunication. It was to imply that Henry was not only not head of the church, but that
he was no longer lawful King of England, and that the allegiance of the country must be transferred
to the Princess Mary when the pope and the emperor should give the word. There might be no
intention of treason; the motive of the opposition might be purely religious; but from the
nature of the case opposition of any kind would abet the treason of others; and no honesty
of meaning could render possible any longer a double loyalty to the crown and to the papacy.

[Sidenote: The new Treason Act.]

The act conferring the title was in consequence followed by another, declaring the denial of
it to be treason. It was necessary to stop the tongues of the noisy mutinous monks, to show
them once for all that these high matters were no subjects for trifling. The oath to the succession
of the Princess Elizabeth partially answered this purpose; and the obligation to take that
oath had been extended to all classes of the king's subjects;[404] but to refuse to swear to
the succession was misprision of treason only, not high treason; and the ecclesiastics (it
had been seen) found no difficulty in swearing oaths which they did not mean to observe. The
parliament therefore now attached to the statute of supremacy the following imperious corollary:--

[Sidenote: For the better security of the realm, it is enacted, That any person who, by words,
writing, or otherwise, deprives the king or queen of any one of their just titles, shall be
held guilty of high treason.]

"Forasmuch as it is most necessary, both for common policy and duty of subjects, above all
things to prohibit, provide, restrain, and extinct all manner of shameful slanders, perils,
or imminent danger or dangers, which might grow, happen, or arise to their sovereign lord the
king, the queen, or their heirs, which, when they be heard, seen, or understood, cannot be
but odible and also abhorred of all those sorts that be true and loving subjects, if in any
point they may, do, or shall touch the king, the queen, their heirs or successors, upon which
dependeth the whole unity and universal weal of this realm; without providing wherefore, too
great a scope should be given to all cankered and traitorous hearts, willers and workers of
the same; and also the king's loving subjects should not declare unto their sovereign lord
now being, which unto them both hath been and is most entirely beloved and esteemed, their
undoubted sincerity and truth: Be it therefore enacted, that if any person or persons, after
the first day of February next coming, do maliciously wish, will, or desire, by words or writing,
or by craft imagine, invent, practise, or attempt any bodily harm to be done or committed to
the king's most royal person, the queen's, or their heirs apparent, or to deprive them or any
of them of the dignity, title, or name of their royal estates, or slanderously and maliciously
publish and pronounce by express writing or words that the king our sovereign lord should be
heretic, schismatic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper of the crown, &c., &c., that all such persons,
their aiders, counsellors, concertors, or abettors, being thereof lawfully convict according
to the laws and customs of the realm, shall be adjudged traitors, and that every such offence
in any of the premises shall be adjudged high treason."[405]

[Sidenote: The act made still more comprehensive, in the interpretation of it.]

[Sidenote: Retributive justice.]

The terrible powers which were thus committed to the government lie on the surface of this
language; but comprehensive as the statute appears, it was still further extended by the interpretation
of the lawyers. In order to fall under its penalties it was held not to be necessary that positive
guilt should be proved in any one of the specified offences; it was enough if a man refused
to give satisfactory answers when subjected to official examination.[406] At the discretion
of the king or his ministers the active consent to the supremacy might be required of any person
on whom they pleased to call, under penalty to the recusant of the dreadful death of a traitor.
So extreme a measure can only be regarded as a remedy for an evil which was also extreme; and
as on the return of quiet times the parliament made haste to repeal a law which was no longer
required, so in the enactment of that law we are bound to believe that they were not betraying
English liberties in a spirit of careless complacency; but that they believed truly that the
security of the state required unusual precautions. The nation was standing with its sword
half drawn in the face of an armed Europe, and it was no time to permit dissensions in the
camp.[407] Toleration is good--but even the best things must abide their opportunity; and although
we may regret that in this grand struggle for freedom, success could only be won by the aid
of measures which bordered upon oppression, yet here also the even hand of justice was but
commending the chalice to the lips of those who had made others drink it to the dregs. They
only were likely to fall under the Treason Act who for centuries had fed the rack and the stake
with sufferers for "opinion."

[Sidenote: Appointment of suffragan bishops.]

Having thus made provision for public safety, the parliament voted a supply of money for the
fortifications on the coast and for the expenses of the Irish war; and after transferring to
the crown the first-fruits of church benefices, which had been previously paid to the See of
Rome, and passing at the same time a large and liberal measure for the appointment of twenty-six
suffragan bishops,[408] they separated, not to meet again for more than a year.

[Sidenote: Cardinal Farnese is chosen pope.]

[Sidenote: He is chosen by French influence, in the hope he will pursue a liberal and conciliating
policy.]

Meanwhile, at Rome a change had taken place which for the moment seemed to promise that the
storm after all might pass away. The conclave had elected as a successor to Clement a man who,
of all the Italian ecclesiastics, was the most likely to recompose the quarrels in the church;
and who, if the genius or the destiny of the papacy had not been too strong for any individual
will, would perhaps have succeeded in restoring peace to Christendom. In the debates upon the
divorce the Cardinal Farnese had been steadily upon Henry's side. He had maintained from the
first the general justice of the king's demands. After the final sentence was passed, he had
urged, though vainly, the reconsideration of that fatal step; and though slow and cautious,
although he was a person who, as Sir Gregory Cassalis described him, "would accomplish little,
but would make few mistakes,"[409] he had allowed his opinion upon this, as on other matters
connected with the English quarrel, to be generally known. He was elected therefore by French
influence[410] as the person most likely to meet the difficulties of Europe in a catholic and
conciliating spirit. He had announced his intention, immediately on Clement's death, of calling
a general council at the earliest moment, in the event of his being chosen to fill the papal
chair; and as he was the friend rather of Francis I. than of the emperor, and as Francis was
actively supporting Henry, and was negotiating at the same moment with the Protestant princes
in Germany, it seemed as if a council summoned under such auspices would endeavour to compose
the general discords in a temper of wise liberality, and that some terms of compromise would
be discovered where by mutual concessions Catholic and Protestant might meet upon a common ground.

The moment was propitious for such a hope; for the accession of a moderate pope coincided with
the reaction in Germany which followed the scandals at Munster and the excesses of John of
Leyden; and Francis pictured to himself a coalition between France, England, and the Lutherans,
which, if the papacy was attached to their side, would be strong enough to bear down opposition,
and reconstitute the churches of Europe upon the basis of liberality which he seemed to have
secured for the church of France. The flattering vision in the autumn of the following year
dazzled the German princes. Perhaps in the novelty of hope it was encouraged even by the pope,
before he had felt the strong hand of fate which ruled his will.

[Sidenote: Anxiety and alarm of the emperor.]

[Sidenote: The mission of the Count of Nassau to Paris with proposals for a league.]

[Sidenote: The emperor's offers are rejected by Francis.]

To Charles V. the danger of some such termination of the great question at issue appeared most
near and real. Charles, whose resentment at the conduct of England united with a desire to
assert his authority over his subjects in Germany, beheld with the utmost alarm a scheme growing
to maturity which menaced alike his honour, his desire of revenge, his supremacy in Europe,
and perhaps his religious convictions. A liberal coalition would be fatal to order, to policy,
to truth; and on the election of Cardinal Farnese, the Count de Nassau was sent on a secret
mission to Paris with overtures, the elaborate condescension of which betrays the anxiety that
must have dictated them. The emperor, in his self-constituted capacity of the Princess Mary's
guardian, offered her hand with the English succession to the Duke of Angoulesme. From the
terms on which he was thought to stand with Anne Boleyn, it was thought possible that Henry
might consent;[411] he might not dare, as d'Inteville before suggested, to oppose the united
demands of France and the Empire.[412] To Margaret de Valois the Count was to propose the splendid
temptation of a marriage with Philip.[413] If Francis would surrender the English alliance,
the emperor would make over to him the passionately coveted Duchy of Milan,[414] to be annexed
to France on the death of the reigning Duke. In the meantime he would pay to the French king,
as "tribute for Milan," a hundred thousand crowns a year, as an acknowledgment of the right
of the house of Valois. Offers such as these might well have tempted the light ambition of
Francis. If sincere, they were equivalent to a surrender of the prize for which the emperor's
life had been spent in contending, and perilous indeed it would have been for England if this
intrigue had been permitted to succeed. But whether it was that Francis too deeply distrusted
Charles, that he preferred the more hazardous scheme of the German alliance, or that he supposed
he could gain his object more surely with the help of England, the Count de Nassau left Paris
with a decisive rejection of the emperor's advances; and in the beginning of January, De Bryon,
the High Admiral of France, was sent to England, to inform Henry of what had passed, and to
propose for Elizabeth the marriage which Charles had desired for the Princess Mary.

[Sidenote: De Bryon sent to England.]

De Bryon's instructions were remarkable. To consolidate the alliance of the two nations, he
was to entreat Henry at length to surrender the claim to the crown of France, which had been
the cause of so many centuries of war. In return for this concession, Francis would make over
to England, Gravelines, Newport, Dunkirk, a province of Flanders, and "the title of the Duke
of Lorrayne to the town of Antwerp, with sufficient assistance for the recovery of the same."
Henry was not to press Francis to part from the papacy; and De Bryon seems to have indicated
a hope that the English king might retrace his own steps. The weight of French influence, meanwhile,
was to be pressed, to induce the pope to revoke and denounce, voyd and frustrate the unjust
and slanderous sentence[415] given by his predecessor; and the terms of this new league were
to be completed by the betrothal of the Princess Elizabeth to the Duke of Angoulesme.[416]

[Sidenote: Change in Henry's character.]

There had been a time when these proposals would have answered all which Henry desired. In
the early days of his reign he had indulged himself in visions of empire, and of repeating
the old glories of the Plantagenet kings. But in the peace which was concluded after the defeat
of Pavia, he showed that he had resigned himself to a wiser policy,[417] and the surrender
of a barren designation would cost him little. In his quarrel with the pope, also, he had professed
an extreme reluctance to impair the unity of the church; and the sacrifices which he had made,
and the years of persevering struggle which he had endured, had proved that in those professions
he had not been insincere. But Henry's character was not what it had been when he won his title
of Defender of the Faith. In the experience of the last few years he had learnt to conceive
some broader sense of the meaning of the Reformation; and he had gathered from Cromwell and
Latimer a more noble conception of the Protestant doctrines. He had entered upon an active
course of legislation for the putting away the injustices, the falsehoods, the oppressions
of a degenerate establishment; and in the strong sense that he had done right, and nothing
else but right, in these measures, he was not now disposed to submit to a compromise, or to
consent to undo anything which he was satisfied had been justly done, in consideration of any
supposed benefit which he could receive from the pope. He was anxious to remain in communion
with the see of Rome. He was willing to acknowledge in some innocuous form the Roman supremacy.
But it could be only on his own terms. The pope must come to him; he could not go to the pope.
And the papal precedency should only again be admitted in England on conditions which should
leave untouched the Act of Appeals, and should preserve the sovereignty of the crown unimpaired.

[Sidenote: Henry's reply to the overtures of the French king.]

[Sidenote: The pope must make the first move towards a reconciliation.]

He replied, therefore, to the overtures of Francis, that he was ready to enter into negotiations
for the resignation or his title to the crown of France, and for the proposed marriage.[418]
Before any other step was taken, however, he desired his good brother to insist that "the Bishop
of Rome" should revoke the sentence, and "declare his pretended marriage with the Lady Catherine
naught;" "which to do," Henry wrote (and this portion of his reply is written by his own hand),
"we think it very facile for our good brother; since we do perceive by letters [from Rome]
both the opinions of the learned men there to be of that opinion that we be of; and also a
somewhat disposition to that purpose in the Bishop of Rome's self, according to equity, reason,
and the laws both positive and divine." If there was to be a reconciliation with the Holy See,
the first advance must be made on the Bishop of Rome's side; and Cromwell, in a simultaneous
despatch, warned Francis not "to move or desire his Grace to the violation of any laws recently
passed, as a thing whereunto he would in no wise condescend or agree."[419]

[Sidenote: Henry distrusts Francis.]

Henry, however, felt no confidence either in the sincerity of the pope, or in the sincerity
of the French king, as he haughtily showed. He did not even trust De Bryon's account of the
rejection of the overtures of the emperor. "If it happeneth," he wrote, "that the said Bishop
will obstinately follow the steps of his predecessor, and be more inclined to the maintenance
of the actions and sentences of his see than to equity and justice, then we trust that our
good brother--perceiving the right to stand on our side, and that not only the universities
of his whole realm and dominions hath so defined, but also the most part of the rest of Christendom,
and also the best learned men of the Bishop of Rome's own council, now being called for that
purpose--will fully and wholly, both he and his whole realm, adhere and cleave to us and our
doings in this behalf; and we herein desire shortly to have answer, which we would be right
loth should be such as whereupon we might take any occasion of suspicion; trusting, further,
that our said good brother will both promise unto us upon his word, and indeed perform, that
in the meantime, before the meeting of our deputies,[420] he nor directly nor indirectly shall
practise or set forth any mean or intelligence of marriage, or of other practices with the
emperour."[421]

[Sidenote: The pope makes indirect advances, which are received also with coldness.]

[Sidenote: January.]

So cold an answer could have arisen only from deep distrust; it is difficult to say whether
the distrust was wholly deserved. Analogous advances, made indirectly from the pope were met
with the same reserve. Sir Gregory Cassalis wrote to Cromwell, that Farnese, or Paul III.,
as he was now called, had expressed the greatest desire to please the king. He had sent for
lawyers out of Tuscany, on whose judgment he had great reliance, and these lawyers had given
an opinion that the pope might ex officio annul the first marriage as Henry desired, and pronounce
the second valid.[422] This was well, but it did not go beyond words; and of these there had
been too many. The English government had fed upon "the cameleon's dish," "eating the air promise
crammed," till they were weary of so weak a diet, and they desired something more substantial.
If the pope, replied Cromwell, be really well disposed, let him show his disposition in some
public manner, "of his own accord, with a desire only for the truth, and without waiting till
the King's Majesty entreat him."[423] It would have been more courteous, and perhaps it would
have been more just, if the French overtures had been met in a warmer spirit; for the policy
of Francis required for the time a cordial understanding with England; and his conduct seems
to prove that he was sincerely anxious to win the pope to complacency.[424] But Henry's experience
guided him wisely with the Roman Bishop; and if he had been entangled into confidence in Farnese,
he would have been entangled to his ruin.

[Sidenote: The language of the papacy had been inconsistent, but its conduct had been uniform.]

The spring of 1535 was consumed in promises, negotiations, and a repetition of the profitless
story of the preceding years. Suddenly, in the midst of the unreality, it became clear that
one man at least was serious. Henry, with an insurgent Ireland and a mutinous England upon
his hands, had no leisure for diplomatic finesse; he had learnt his lesson with Clement, and
was not to be again deceived. The language of the Roman see had been inconsistent, but the
actions of it had been always uniform. From the first beginning of the dispute to the final
break and excommunication, in the teeth of his promises, his flatteries, his acknowledgments,
Clement had been the partisan of Catherine. When the English agents were collecting the opinions
of the Italian universities, they were thwarted by his emissaries. He had intrigued against
Henry in Scotland; he had tampered with Henry's English and Irish subjects; he had maintained
a secret correspondence with Catherine herself. And so well had his true feelings and the true
position of the question been understood by the papal party in England, that at the very time
when at Marseilles and elsewhere the pope himself was admitting the justice of the king's demand,
the religious orders who were most unwavering in their allegiance to the papacy, were pressing
their opposition to the divorce into rebellion.

[Sidenote: Until the pope, therefore, shows some change in action, the penal laws may not be
arrested.]

When, therefore, the chair of St. Peter was filled by a new occupant, and language of the same
smooth kind began again to issue from it, the English government could not for so light a cause
consent to arrest their measures, or suspend the action of laws which had been passed from
a conviction of their necessity. Whatever might become of French marriages, or of the cession
of a corner of the Netherlands and a few towns upon the coast in exchange for a gaudy title,
the English Reformation must continue its way; the nation must be steered clear among the reefs
and shoals of treason. The late statutes had not been passed without a cause; and when occasion
came to enforce them, were not to pass off, like the thunders of the Vatican, in impotent noise.

[Sidenote: The martyrdoms of Catholics and Protestants analogous to deaths in battle.]

Here, therefore, we are to enter upon one of the grand scenes of history; a solemn battle fought
out to the death, yet fought without ferocity, by the champions of rival principles. Heroic
men had fallen, and were still fast falling, for what was called heresy; and now those who
had inflicted death on others were called upon to bear the same witness to their own sincerity.
England became the theatre of a war between two armies of martyrs, to be waged, not upon the
open field, in open action, but on the stake and on the scaffold, with the nobler weapons of
passive endurance. Each party were ready to give their blood; each party were ready to shed
the blood of their antagonists; and the sword was to single out its victims in the rival ranks,
not as in peace among those whose crimes made them dangerous to society, but, as on the field
of battle, where the most conspicuous courage most challenges the aim of the enemy. It was
war, though under the form of peace; and if we would understand the true spirit of the time,
we must regard Catholics and Protestants as gallant soldiers, whose deaths, when they fall,
are not painful, but glorious; and whose devotion we are equally able to admire, even where
we cannot equally approve their cause. Courage and self-sacrifice are beautiful alike in an
enemy and in a friend. And while we exult in that chivalry with which the Smithfield martyrs
bought England's freedom with their blood, so we will not refuse our admiration to those other
gallant men whose high forms, in the sunset of the old faith, stand transfigured on the horizon,
tinged with the light of its dying glory.

[Sidenote: The monks of the London Charterhouse.]

Secretary Bedyll, as we saw above, complained to Cromwell of the obstinacy of certain friars
and monks, who, he thought, would confer a service on the country by dying quietly, lest honest
men should incur unmerited obloquy in putting them to death. Among these, the brethren of the
London Charterhouse were specially mentioned as recalcitrant, and they were said at the same
time to bear a high reputation for holiness. In a narrative written by a member of this body,
we are brought face to face, at their time of trial, with one of the few religious establishments
in England which continued to deserve the name; and we may see, in the scenes which are there
described, the highest representation of struggles which graduated variously according to character
and temper, and, without the tragical result, may have been witnessed in very many of the monastic
houses. The writer was a certain Maurice Channey, probably an Irishman. He went through the
same sufferings with the rest of the brethren, and was one of the small fraction who finally
gave way under the trial. He was set at liberty, and escaped abroad; and in penance for his
weakness, he left on record the touching story of his fall, and of the triumph of his bolder
companions.

[Sidenote: Story of Maurice Channey.]

[Sidenote: Unity of the monastic life.]

He commences with his own confession. He had fallen when others stood. He was, as he says,
an unworthy brother, a Saul among the prophets, a Judas among the apostles, a child of Ephraim
turning himself back in the day of battle--for which his cowardice, while his brother monks
were saints in heaven, he was doing penance in sorrow, tossing on the waves of the wide world.
The early chapters contain a loving lingering picture of his cloister life--to him the perfection
of earthly happiness. It is placed before us, in all its superstition, its devotion, and its
simplicity, the counterpart, even in minute details, of the stories of the Saxon recluses when
monasticism was in the young vigour of its life. St. Bede or St. Cuthbert might have found
himself in the house of the London Carthusians, and he would have had few questions to ask,
and no duties to learn or to unlearn. The form of the buildings would have seemed more elaborate;
the notes of the organ would have added richer solemnity to the services; but the salient features
of the scene would have been all familiar. He would have lived in a cell of the same shape,
he would have thought the same thoughts, spoken the same words in the same language. The prayers,
the daily life, almost the very faces with which he was surrounded, would have seemed all unaltered.
A thousand years of the world's history had rolled by, and these lonely islands of prayer had
remained still anchored in the stream; the strands of the ropes which held them, wearing now
to a thread, and very near their last parting, but still unbroken. What they had been they
were; and, if Maurice Channey's description had come down to us as the account of the monastery
in which Offa of Mercia did penance for his crimes, we could have detected no internal symptoms
of a later age.

[Sidenote: Channey's description of it.]

His pages are filled with the old familiar stories of visions and miracles; of strange adventures
befalling the chalices and holy wafers;[425] of angels with wax candles; innocent phantoms
which flitted round brains and minds fevered by asceticism. There are accounts of certain fratres
reprobi et eorum terribilis punitio--frail brethren and the frightful catastrophes which ensued
to them.[426] Brother Thomas, who told stories out of doors, apud sæculares, was attacked one
night by the devil; and the fiend would have strangled him but for the prayers of a companion.
Brother George, who craved after the fleshpots of Egypt, was walking one day about the cloister
when he ought to have been at chapel, and the great figure upon the cross at the end of the
gallery turned its back upon him as it hung, and drove him all but mad. Brother John Daly found
fault with his dinner, and said that he would as soon eat toads--Mira res! Justus Deus non
fraudavit eum desiderio suo--his cell was for three months filled with toads. If he threw them
into the fire, they hopped back to him unscorched; if he killed them, others came to take their
place.

[Sidenote: Character of Haughton, the prior.]

But these bad brothers were rare exceptions. In general the house was perhaps the best ordered
in England. The hospitality was well sustained, the charities were profuse, and whatever we
may think of the intellect which could busy itself with fancies seemingly so childish, the
monks were true to their vows, and true to their duty as far as they comprehended what duty
meant. Among many good, the prior John Haughton was the best. He was of an old English family,
and had been educated at Cambridge, where he must have been the contemporary of Latimer. At
the age of twenty-eight he took the vows as a monk, and had been twenty years a Carthusian
at the opening of the troubles of the Reformation. He is described as "small in stature, in
figure graceful, in countenance dignified." "In manner he was most modest; in eloquence most
sweet; in chastity without stain." We may readily imagine his appearance; with that feminine
austerity of expression which, as has been well said, belongs so peculiarly to the features
of the mediæval ecclesiastics.

[Sidenote: The monks espouse the side of Queen Catherine.]

[Sidenote: They are required to take the oath of allegiance, and refuse.]

[Sidenote: The prior is persuaded to submit, sub conditione.]

[Sidenote: The prior's dream.]

[Sidenote: The monks hesitate,]

[Sidenote: But at last yield.]

Such was the society of the monks of the Charterhouse, who, in an era too late for their continuance,
and guilty of being unable to read the signs of the times, were summoned to wage unequal battle
with the world. From the commencement of the divorce cause they had espoused instinctively
the queen's side; they had probably, in common with their affiliated house at Sion, believed
unwisely in the Nun of Kent; and, as pious Catholics, they regarded the reforming measures
of the parliament with dismay and consternation. The year 1533, says Maurice,[427] was ushered
in with signs in heaven and prodigies upon earth, as if the end of the world was at hand; as
indeed of the monks and the monks' world the end was truly at hand. And then came the spring
of 1534, when the act was passed cutting off the Princess Mary from the succession, and requiring
of all subjects of the realm an oath of allegiance to Elizabeth, and a recognition of the king's
marriage with Queen Anne. Sir Thomas More and Bishop Fisher went to the Tower, as we saw, rather
than swear; and about the same time the royal commissioners appeared at the Charterhouse to
require the submission of the brethren. The regular clergy through the kingdom had bent to
the storm. The conscience of the London Carthusians was less elastic; they were the first and,
with the exception of More and Fisher, the only recusants. "The prior did answer to the commissioners,"
Maurice tells us, "that he knew nothing of such matters, and could not meddle with them; and
they continuing to insist, and the prior being still unable to give other answer, he was sent
with Father Humphrey, our proctor, to the Tower." There he remained for a month; and at the
end of it he was persuaded by "certain good and learned men"[428] that the cause was not one
for which it was lawful to suffer. He undertook to comply, sub conditione, with some necessary
reservations, and was sent home to the cloister. As soon as he returned, the brethren assembled
in their chapter-house "in confusion and great perplexity," and Haughton told them what he
had promised. He would submit, he said, and yet his misgivings foretold to him that a submission
so made could not long avail. "Our hour, dear brethren," he continued, "is not yet come. In
the same night in which we were set free I had a dream that I should not escape thus. Within
a year I shall be brought again to that place, and then I shall finish my course." If martyrdom
was so near and so inevitable, the remainder of the monks were at first reluctant to purchase
a useless delay at the price of their convictions. The commissioners came with the lord mayor
for the oath, and it was refused. They came again, with the threat of instant imprisonment
for the whole fraternity; "and then," says Maurice, "they prevailed with us. We all swore as
we were required, making one condition, that we submitted only so far as it was lawful for
us so to do. Thus, like Jonah, we were delivered from the belly of this monster, this immanis
ceta, and began again to rejoice like him, under the shadow of the gourd of our home. But it
is better to trust in the Lord than in princes, in whom is no salvation; God had prepared a
worm that smote our gourd and made it to perish."[429]

[Sidenote: The convent hears of the Treason Act.]

This worm, as may be supposed, was the act of supremacy, with the statute of treasons which
was attached to it. It was ruled, as I have said, that inadequate answers to official inquiry
formed sufficient ground for prosecution under these acts. But this interpretation was not
generally known; nor among those who knew it was it certain whether the crown would avail itself
of the powers which it thus possessed, or whether it would proceed only against such offenders
as had voluntarily committed themselves to opposition. In the opening of the following year
[1535] the first uncertainty was at an end; it was publicly understood that persons who had
previously given cause for suspicion might be submitted to question. When this bitter news
was no longer doubtful, the prior called the convent together, and gave them notice to prepare
for what was coming. They lay already under the shadow of treason; and he anticipated, among
other evil consequences of disobedience, the immediate dissolution of the house. Even he, with
all his forebodings, was unprepared for the course which would really be taken with them. "When
we were all in great consternation," writes our author, "he said to us:--

[Sidenote: The prior's address.]

"'Very sorry am I, and my heart is heavy, especially for you, my younger friends, of whom I
see so many round me. Here you are living in your innocence. The yoke will not be laid on your
necks, nor the rod of persecution. But if you are taken hence, and mingle among the Gentiles,
you may learn the works of them, and having begun in the spirit you may be consumed in the
flesh. And there may be others among us whose hearts are still infirm. If these mix again with
the world, I fear how it may be with them; and what shall I say, and what shall I do, if I
cannot save those whom God has trusted to my charge?'

"Then all who were present," says Channey, "burst into tears, and cried with one voice, 'Let
us die together in our integrity, and heaven and earth shall witness for us how unjustly we
are cut off.'

[Sidenote: If it may be so, the prior will make himself anathema for his brethren.]

"The prior answered, sadly,--'Would, indeed, that it might be so; that so dying we might live,
as living we die--but they will not do to us so great a kindness, nor to themselves so great
an injury. Many of you are of noble blood; and what I think they will do is this: Me and the
elder brethren they will kill; and they will dismiss you that are young into a world which
is not for you. If, therefore, it depend on me alone--if my oath will suffice for the house--I
will throw myself for your sakes on the mercy of God. I will make myself anathema; and to preserve
you from these dangers, I will consent to the king's will. If, however, they have determined
otherwise--if they choose to have the consent of us all--the will of God be done. If one death
will not avail, we will die all.'

"So then, bidding us prepare for the worst, that the Lord when he knocked might find us ready,
he desired us to choose each our confessor, and to confess our sins one to another, giving
us power to grant each other absolution.

[Sidenote: The brethren make their preparations.]

"The day after he preached a sermon in the chapel on the 59th Psalm,--'O God, Thou hast cast
us off, Thou hast destroyed us;'[430] concluding with the words, 'It is better that we should
suffer here a short penance for our faults, than be reserved for the eternal pains of hell
hereafter;'--and so ending, he turned to us and bade us all do as we saw him do. Then rising
from his place he went direct to the eldest of the brethren, who was sitting nearest to himself,
and kneeling before him, begged his forgiveness for any offence which in heart, word, or deed,
he might have committed against him. Thence he proceeded to the next, and said the same; and
so to the next, through us all, we following him and saying as he did, each from each imploring
pardon."

Thus, with unobtrusive nobleness, did these poor men prepare themselves for their end; not
less beautiful in their resolution, not less deserving the everlasting remembrance of mankind,
than those three hundred who in the summer morning sate combing their golden hair in the passes
of Thermopylæ. We will not regret their cause; there is no cause for which any man can more
nobly suffer than to witness that it is better for him to die than to speak words which he
does not mean. Nor, in this their hour of trial, were they left without higher comfort.

"The third day after," the story goes on, "was the mass of the Holy Ghost, and God made known
his presence among us. For when the host was lifted up, there came as it were a whisper of
air, which breathed upon our faces as we knelt. Some perceived it with the bodily senses; all
felt it as it thrilled into their hearts. And then followed a sweet, soft sound of music, at
which our venerable father was so moved, God being thus abundantly manifest among us, that
he sank down in tears, and for a long time could not continue the service--we all remaining
stupified, hearing the melody, and feeling the marvellous effects of it upon our spirits, but
knowing neither whence it came nor whither it went. Only our hearts rejoiced as we perceived
that God was with us indeed."

[Sidenote: The government are in no haste to enforce the statutes.]

Comforted and resolute, the brotherhood awaited patiently the approach of the commissioners;
and they waited long, for the crown was in no haste to be severe. The statutes had been passed
in no spirit of cruelty; they were weapons to be used in case of extremity; and there was no
attempt to enforce them until forbearance was misconstrued into fear. Sir Thomas More and the
Bishop of Rochester remained unquestioned in the Tower, and were allowed free intercourse with
their friends. The Carthusian monks were left undisturbed, although the attitude which they
had assumed was notorious, and although the prior was known to forbid his penitents in confession
to acknowledge the king's supremacy. If the government was at length driven to severity, it
was because the clergy forced them to it in spite of themselves.

[Sidenote: Conduct of the clergy.]

The clergy had taken the oath, but they held themselves under no obligation to observe it;
or if they observed the orders of the crown in the letter, they thwarted those orders in the
spirit. The Treason Act had for awhile overawed them; but finding that its threats were confined
to language, that months passed away, and that no person had as yet been prosecuted, they fell
back into open opposition, either careless of the consequences, or believing that the government
did not dare to exert its powers. The details of their conduct during the spring months of
this year I am unable to discover; but it was such as at length, on the 17th of April, provoked
the following circular to the lords-lieutenant of the various counties:[431]--

[Sidenote: Circular of the 17th of April.]

[Sidenote: The clergy in divers places continue to pray for the pope.]

[Sidenote: The king commands that all persons so doing shall be arrested.]

"Right trusty and well-beloved cousin, we greet you well; and whereas it has come to our knowledge
that sundry persons, as well religious as secular priests and curates in their parishes and
in divers places within this our realm, do daily, as much as in them is, set forth and extol
the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome, otherwise called the Pope; sowing their seditious,
pestilent, and false doctrines; praying for him in the pulpit and making him a god; to the
great deceit of our subjects, bringing them into errours and evil opinions; more preferring
the power, laws, and jurisdiction of the said Bishop of Rome than the most holy laws and precepts
of Almighty God: We therefore, minding not only to proceed for an unity and quietness among
our said subjects, but also greatly coveting and desiring them to be brought to a knowledge
of the mere verity and truth, and no longer to be seduced with any such superstitious and false
doctrines of any earthly usurper of God's laws--will, therefore, and command you, that whensoever
ye shall hear of any such seditious persons, ye indelayedly do take and apprehend them, or
cause them to be apprehended and taken, and so committed to ward, there to remain without bail
or mainprize, until, upon your advertisement thereof to us and to our council, ye shall know
our further pleasure.

  HENRY R."

[Sidenote: The Carthusians are called upon to acknowledge the royal supremacy.]

[Sidenote: The reason for the conduct of the government.]

In obvious connexion with the issue of this publication, the monks of the Charterhouse were
at length informed that they would be questioned on the supremacy. The great body of the religious
houses had volunteered an outward submission. The London Carthusians, with other affiliated
establishments, had remained passive, and had thus furnished an open encouragement to disobedience.
We are instinctively inclined to censure an interference with persons who at worst were but
dreamers of the cloister; and whose innocence of outward offences we imagine might have served
them for a shield. Unhappily, behind the screenwork of these poor saints a whole Irish insurrection
was blazing in madness and fury; and in the northern English counties were some sixty thousand
persons ready to rise in arms. In these great struggles men are formidable in proportion to
their virtues. The noblest Protestants were chosen by the Catholics for the stake. The fagots
were already growing which were to burn Tyndal, the translator of the Bible. It was the habit
of the time, as it is the habit of all times of real danger, to spare the multitude but to
strike the leaders, to make responsibility the shadow of power, to choose for punishment the
most efficacious representatives of the spirit which it was necessary to subdue.

The influence of the Carthusians, with that of the two great men who were following the same
road to the same goal, determined multitudes in the attitude which they would assume, and in
the duty which they would choose. The Carthusians, therefore, were to be made to bend; or if
they could not be bent, to be made examples in their punishment, as they had made themselves
examples in their resistance. They were noble and good; but there were others in England good
and noble as they, who were not of their fold; and whose virtues, thenceforward more required
by England than cloistered asceticisms, had been blighted under the shadow of the papacy. The
Catholics had chosen the alternative, either to crush the free thought which was bursting from
the soil, or else to be crushed by it; and the future of the world could not be sacrificed
to preserve the exotic graces of mediæval saints. They fell, gloriously and not unprofitably.
They were not allowed to stay the course of the Reformation; but their sufferings, nobly borne,
sufficed to recover the sympathy of after-ages for the faith which they professed. Ten righteous
men were found in the midst of the corruption to purchase for Romanism a few more centuries
of tolerated endurance.

[Sidenote: The prior with three others are sent to the Tower,]

[Sidenote: And brought to trial, April 28.]

To return to the narrative of Maurice Channey. Notice of the intention of the government having
been signified to the order, Father Webster and Father Lawrence, the priors of the two daughter
houses of Axholm and Belville, came up to London three weeks after Easter, and, with Haughton,
presented themselves before Cromwell with an entreaty to be excused the submission. For answer
to their petition they were sent to the Tower, where they were soon after joined by Father
Reynolds, one of the recalcitrant monks of Sion. These four were brought on the 26th of April
before a committee of the privy council, of which Cromwell was one. The act of supremacy was
laid before them, and they were required to signify their acceptance of it. They refused, and
two days after they were brought to trial before a special commission. They pleaded all "not
guilty." They had of course broken the act; but they would not acknowledge that guilt could
be involved in disobedience to a law which was itself unlawful. Their words in the Tower to
the privy council formed the matter of the charge against them. It appears from the record
that on their examination, "they, treacherously machinating and desiring to deprive the king
our sovereign lord of his title of supreme Head of the Church of England, did openly declare
and say, the king our sovereign lord is not supreme Head on earth of the Church of England."[432]

[Sidenote: Haughton's language at the bar.]

But their conduct on the trial, or at least the conduct of Haughton, spared all difficulty
in securing a conviction. The judges pressed the prior "not to shew so little wisdom as to
maintain his own opinion against the consent of the realm." He replied, that he had resolved
originally to imitate the example of his Master before Herod, and say nothing. "But since you
urge me," he continued, "that I may satisfy my own conscience and the consciences of these
who are present, I will say that our opinion, if it might go by the suffrages of men, would
have more witnesses than yours. You can produce on your side but the parliament of a single
kingdom; I, on mine, have the whole Christian world except that kingdom. Nor have you all even
of your own people. The lesser part is with you. The majority, who seem to be with you, do
but dissemble, to gain favour with the king, or for fear they should lose their honours and
their dignities."

Cromwell asked him of whom he was speaking. "Of all the good men in the realm," he replied;
"and when his Majesty knows the truth, I know well he will be beyond measure offended with
those of his bishops who have given him the counsel which he now follows."

"Why," said another of the judges, "have you, contrary to the king's authority within the realm,
persuaded so many persons as you have done to disobey the king and parliament?"

[Sidenote: Thursday, April 29.]

[Sidenote: The prisoners are condemned.]

"I have declared my opinion," he answered, "to no man living but to those who came to me in
confession, which in discharge of my conscience I could not refuse. But if I did not declare
it then, I will declare it now, because I am thereto obliged to God."[433] He neither looked
for mercy nor desired it. A writ was issued for the return of a petty jury the following day.
The prisoners were taken back to the Tower, and the next morning were brought again to the
bar. Feron and Hale, the two priests whose conversation had been overheard at Sion, were placed
on their trial at the same time. The two latter threw themselves on the mercy of the court.
A verdict of guilty was returned against the other four. The sentence was for the usual punishment
of high treason. Feron was pardoned; I do not find on what account. Hale and the Carthusians
were to suffer together. When Haughton heard the sentence, he merely said, "This is the judgment
of the world."[434]

[Sidenote: May 4. The execution.]

[Sidenote: They are brought to the scaffold in their habits.]

An interval of five days was allowed after the trial. On the 4th of May, the execution took
place at Tyburn, under circumstances which marked the occasion with peculiar meaning. The punishment
in cases of high treason was very terrible. I need not dwell upon the form of it. The English
were a hard, fierce people; and with these poor sufferers the law of the land took its course
without alleviation or interference. But another feature distinguished the present execution.
For the first time in English history, ecclesiastics were brought out to suffer in their habits,
without undergoing the previous ceremony of degradation. Thenceforward the world were to know,
that as no sanctuary any more should protect traitors, so the sacred office should avail as
little; and the hardest blow which it had yet received was thus dealt to superstition, shaking
from its place in the minds of all men the key-stone of the whole system.

[Sidenote: Haughton dies first.]

[Sidenote: The council urges the rest to submit, but in vain.]

To the last moment escape was left open, if the prisoners would submit. Several members of
the council attended them to the closing scene, for a last effort of kindness; but they had
chosen their course, and were not to be moved from it. Haughton, as first in rank, had the
privilege of first dying. When on the scaffold, in compliance with the usual custom, he spoke
a few touching and simple words to the people. "I call to witness Almighty God," he said, "and
all good people, and I beseech you all here present to bear witness for me in the day of judgment,
that being here to die, I declare that it is from no obstinate rebellious spirit that I do
not obey the king, but because I fear to offend the Majesty of God. Our holy mother the church
has decreed otherwise than the king and the parliament have decreed, and therefore, rather
than disobey the church, I am ready to suffer. Pray for me, and have mercy on my brethren,
of whom I have been the unworthy prior." He then knelt down, repeating the first few verses
of the 31st Psalm,[435] and after a few moments delivered himself to the executioner. The others
followed, undaunted. As one by one they went to their death, the council, at each fresh horrible
spectacle, urged the survivors to have pity on themselves; but they urged them in vain. The
faces of these men did not grow pale; their voices did not shake; they declared themselves
liege subjects of the king, and obedient children of holy church; "giving God thanks that they
were held worthy to suffer for the truth."[436] All died without a murmur. The stern work was
ended with quartering the bodies; and the arm of Haughton was hung up as a bloody sign over
the archway of the Charterhouse, to awe the remaining brothers into submission.

[Sidenote: June 10. Three more Carthusians tried and executed.]

But the spirit of the old martyrs was in these friars. One of them, like the Theban sister,
bore away the honoured relic and buried it; and all resolved to persist in their resigned opposition.
Six weeks were allowed them to consider. At the end of that time three more were taken, tried,
and hanged;[437] and this still proving ineffectual, Cromwell hesitated to proceed.

[Sidenote: Cromwell hesitates.]

[Sidenote: Close of the story of the Carthusians.]

[Sidenote: They will not yield, and are crushed.]

The end of the story is very touching and may be told briefly, that I may not have occasion
to return to it. Maurice's account is probably exaggerated, and is written in a tone of strong
emotion; but it has all the substantial features of truth. The remaining monks were left in
the house; and two secular priests were sent to take charge of the establishment, who starved
and ill-used them; and were themselves, according to Maurice, sensual and profligate. From
time to time they were called before the privy council. Their friends and relatives were ordered
to work upon them. No effort either of severity or kindness was spared to induce them to submit;
as if their attitude, so long as it was maintained, was felt as a reproach by the government.
At last, four were carried down to Westminster Abbey, to hear the Bishop of Durham deliver
his famous sermon against the pope; and when this rhetorical inanity had also failed, and as
they were thought to confirm one another in their obstinacy, they were dispersed among other
houses the temper of which could be depended upon. Some were sent to the north; others to Sion,
where a new prior had been appointed, of zealous loyalty; others were left at home to be disciplined
by the questionable seculars. But nothing answered. Two found their way into active rebellion,
and being concerned in the Pilgrimage of Grace, were hung in chains at York. Ten were sent
to Newgate, where nine died miserably of prison fever and filth;[438] the tenth survivor was
executed. The remainder, of whom Maurice was one, went through a form of submission, with a
mental reservation, and escaped abroad.

[Sidenote: The necessity was a cruel one, but the government are not to be blamed.]

[Sidenote: The king orders the court into mourning.]

So fell the monks of the London Charterhouse, splintered to pieces--for so only could their
resistance be overcome--by the iron sceptre and the iron hand which held it. They were, however,
alone of their kind. There were many perhaps who wished to resemble them, who would have imitated
their example had they dared. But all bent except these. If it had been otherwise, the Reformation
would have been impossible, and perhaps it would not have been needed. Their story claims from
us that sympathy which is the due of their exalted courage. But we cannot blame the government.
Those who know what the condition of the country really was, must feel their inability to suggest,
with any tolerable reasonableness, what else could have been done. They may regret so hard
a necessity, but they will regret in silence. The king, too, was not without feeling. It was
no matter of indifference to him that he found himself driven to such stern courses with his
subjects; and as the golden splendour of his manhood was thus sullenly clouding, "he commanded
all about his court to poll their heads," in public token of mourning; "and to give them example,
he caused his own head to be polled; and from thenceforth his beard to be knotted, and to be
no more shaven."[439]

[Sidenote: May 8. Other martyrs who were not Catholics.]

The friars of Charterhouse suffered for the Catholic faith, as Protestants had suffered, and
were still to suffer, for a faith fairer than theirs. In this same month of May, in the same
year, the English annals contain another entry of no less sad significance. The bishops, as
each day they parted further from their old allegiance, and were called in consequence by the
hateful name of heretics, were increasingly anxious to prove by evident tokens their zeal for
the true faith; and although the late act of heresy had moderated their powers, yet power enough
remained to enable them to work their will upon all extreme offenders. Henry, also, it is likely,
was not sorry of an opportunity of showing that his justice was even-handed, and that a schism
from the papacy was not a lapse into heterodoxy. His mind was moving. Latimer and Shaxton,
who three years before had been on trial for their lives, were soon to be upon the bench; and
in the late injunctions, the Bible, and not the decrees of the church, had been held up as
the canon of truth. But heresy, though the definition of it was changing, remained a crime;
and although the limits of permitted belief were imperceptibly enlarging, to transgress the
recognised boundaries was an offence enormous as ever.

[Sidenote: Popular estimate of the Anabaptists.]

If we can conceive the temper with which the reasonable and practical English at present regard
the Socialists of the continent, deepened by an intensity of conviction of which these later
ages have had but little experience, we can then imagine the light in which the Anabaptists
of the Netherlands appeared in the eyes or orthodox Europe. If some opinions, once thought
heretical, were regarded with less agitated repugnance, the heresy of these enemies of mankind
was patent to the world. On them the laws of the country might take their natural course, and
no voice was raised to speak for them.

[Sidenote: May 25.]

[Sidenote: Fourteen of them are executed.]

[Sidenote: They too did not die in vain.]

We find, therefore, in Stow's Chronicle, the following: brief entry: "The five and twentieth
day of May were, in St. Paul's church, London, examined nineteen men and six women, born in
Holland, whose opinions were--first, that in Christ is not two natures, God and man; secondly,
that Christ took neither flesh nor blood of the Virgin Mary; thirdly, that children born of
infidels may be saved; fourthly, that baptism of children is of none effect; fifthly, that
the sacrament of Christ's body is but bread only; sixthly, that he who after baptism sinneth
wittingly, sinneth deadly, and cannot be saved. Fourteen of them were condemned: a man and
a woman were burnt at Smithfield. The remaining twelve were scattered among other towns, there
to be burnt."[440] The details are gone,[441]--the names are gone. Poor Hollanders they were,
and that is all. Scarcely the fact seemed worth the mention, so shortly it is told in a passing
paragraph. For them no Europe was agitated, no courts were ordered into mourning, no papal
hearts trembled with indignation. At their deaths the world looked on complacent, indifferent,
or exulting. Yet here, too, out of twenty-five common men and women were found fourteen who,
by no terror of stake or torture, could be tempted to say that they believed what they did
not believe. History for them has no word of praise; yet they, too, were not giving their blood
in vain. Their lives might have been as useless as the lives of most of us. In their deaths
they assisted to pay the purchase-money for England's freedom.

[Sidenote: Fisher and More.]

[Sidenote: Fisher's dangerous imprudence.]

[Sidenote: Treatment and conduct of Fisher and of More in the Tower.]

[Sidenote: Cromwell's charges against them.]

After the execution of the Carthusians, it became a question what should be done with the Bishop
of Rochester and Sir Thomas More. They had remained for a year in the Tower, undisturbed; and
there is no reason to think that they would have been further troubled, except for the fault
of one, if not of both. It appeared, however, on the trial of Father Reynolds, that Fisher's
imprudence or zeal had tempted him again to meddle with dangerous matters. A correspondence
had passed between the bishop and the king,[442] on the Act of Supremacy, or on some subject
connected with it. The king had taken no public notice of Fisher's words, but he had required
a promise that the letter should not be shown to any other person. The unwise old man gave
his word, but he did not observe it; he sent copies both of what he had himself written and
of the king's answer to the Sion monks,[443] furnishing them at the same time with a copy of
the book which he had written against the divorce, and two other books, written by Abel, the
queen's confessor, and the Spanish ambassador. Whether he was discovered to have held any other
correspondence, or whether anything of an analogous kind was proved against More, I am unable
to discover. Both he and Fisher had been treated with greater indulgence than was usual with
prisoners.[444] Their own attendants had waited on them; they were allowed to receive visits
from their relatives within the Tower walls, and to correspond with their families and friends.[445]
As a matter of course, under such circumstances, they must have expressed their opinions on
the great subject of the day; and those opinions were made known throughout England, and, indeed,
throughout Europe. Whether they did more than this, or whether they had only indirectly allowed
their influence to be used against the government, must be left to conjecture. But the language
of a document under the king's hand speaks of their having given some cause of provocation,
of no common kind; and this is confirmed by Cromwell, who was once deeply attached to More.
"When they were in strait keeping," say the instructions to the Bishop of Hereford, "having
nevertheless the prison at their liberties, they ceased not both to practise an insurrection
within the realm, and also to use all the devices to them possible in outward parts, as well
to defame and slander his Majesty, and his most virtuous doings and proceedings, as also to
procure the impeachment and other destruction of his most royal person."[446] Cromwell speaks
also of their having been engaged in definite schemes, the object of which was rebellion;[447]
and although we have here the ex parte statement of the government, and although such a charge
would have been held to be justified by a proof that they had spoken generally against the
Act of Supremacy, it may be allowed to prove that so far they were really guilty; and it is
equally certain that for these two men to have spoken against the act was to have lent encouragement
to the party of insurrection, the most powerful which that party could have received.

Thus, by another necessity, Fisher and More, at the beginning of May, were called upon for
their submission. It was a hard case, for the bishop was sinking into the grave with age and
sickness, and More had the highest reputation of any living man. But they had chosen to make
themselves conspicuous as confessors for Catholic truth; though prisoners in the Tower, they
were in fact the most effectual champions of the papal claims; and if their disobedience had
been passed over, the statute could have been enforced against no one.

[Sidenote: May 7. A deputation of the council waits upon them in the Tower. They refuse to
admit the supremacy.]

The same course was followed as with the Carthusian monks. On the 7th of May a deputation of
the council waited on the prisoners in the Tower, for an acknowledgment of the supremacy. They
refused: Fisher, after a brief hesitation, peremptorily; More declining to answer, but also
giving an indirect denial. After repeated efforts had been made to move them, and made in vain,
their own language, as in the preceding trials, furnished material for their indictment; and
the law officers of the crown who were to conduct the prosecution were the witnesses under
whose evidence they were to be tried. It was a strange proceeding, to be excused only, if excused
at all, by the pressure of the times.[448]

[Sidenote: The government delay their trial.]

Either the king or his ministers, however, were slow in making up their minds. With the Carthusians,
nine days only were allowed to elapse between the first examination and the final close at
Tyburn. The case against More and Fisher was no less clear than against the monks; yet five
weeks elapsed and the government still hesitated. Perhaps they were influenced by the high
position of the greater offenders,--perhaps there was some fear of the world's opinion, which,
though it might be indifferent to the sacrifice of a few obscure ecclesiastics, yet would surely
not pass over lightly the execution of men who stood out with so marked preëminence. The council
board was unevenly composed. Cromwell, who divides with the king the responsibility of these
prosecutions, had succeeded, not to the authority only of Wolsey, but to the hatred with which
the ignoble plebeian was regarded by the patricians who were compelled to stoop before him.
Lord Exeter was already looking with a cold eye on the revolution; and Norfolk and Suffolk,
though zealous as the king himself for the independence of England, yet had all the instincts
of aristocratic conservatism. Even Cromwell may have desired the triumph of winning over converts
so distinguished, or may have shrunk from the odium which their deaths would bring upon him.
Whatever was the cause of the delay, the privy council, who had been contented with a single
examination of Haughton and his companions, struggled with their present difficulty week after
week; and it is possible that, except from an extraneous impulse, some mode of escape might
have been discovered. But as the sentence of Clement sealed the fate of the Nun of Kent, so
the unwisdom of his successor bore similarly fatal fruits.

[Sidenote: The pope names Fisher a cardinal.]

Paul III. had throughout the spring flattered Henry with expressions of sympathy, and had held
out hopes of an approaching change of policy. He chose the present unfortunate juncture to
expose the vanity of these professions; and as an intimation of the course which he intended
to follow, he named the Bishop of Rochester, the one bishop who remained attached to Catherine's
cause, a cardinal. Henry had appealed to a council, which the pope had promised to call; and
Fisher, of all Englishmen, was chosen as the person whom the pope desired to represent the
nation on its assembly. Even the very conclave at Rome were taken by surprise, and expressed
themselves in no measured terms at the impolicy of this most foolish action. Cassalis, aware
of the effect which the news would produce in England, hurried to such friends as he possessed
in the conclave to protest against the appointment. The king, he said, would inevitably regard
it as injurious to the realm and insulting to himself;[449] and it was madness at such a moment
to trifle with Henry's displeasure.

[Sidenote: Cassalis protests, and the pope condescends to falsehood.]

The Pope, alarmed at the expressions which he was told that Cassalis had used, sent in haste
to urge him, if possible, to allay the storm. He was not ashamed to stoop to falsehood--but
falsehood too awkward to deceive even the most willing credulity. He had thought, he said,
of nothing but to please Henry. He had been urged by the King of France to seek a reconciliation
with England, and in sending a hat to an English bishop he had meant nothing but a compliment.
The general council would be held immediately; and it was desirable, according to the constitution
of the church, that a cardinal of every nation should be present. He had no especial reason
for choosing the Bishop of Rochester, except that he had a high reputation for learning, and
he imagined, therefore, that the king would be gratified.[450] "He implored me," Cassalis wrote,
"to make his excuses to his Majesty, and to assure him how deeply he regretted his mistake,
especially when I assured him that the step was of a kind which admitted of no excuse."[451]

[Sidenote: The appointment seals Fisher's fate.]

[Sidenote: June 17. He is tried at Westminster,]

[Sidenote: And is condemned.]

Cassalis himself was afterwards disposed to believe that the appointment was made in thoughtlessness,
and that the pope at the moment had really forgotten Fisher's position.[452] But this could
gain no credit in England. The news reached the government in the middle of June, and determined
the fate of the unfortunate bishop; and with it the fate, also, of his nobler companion. To
the king, the pope's conduct appeared a defiance; and as a defiance he accepted it. In vain
Fisher declared that he had not sought his ill-timed honours, and would not accept them. Neither
his ignorance nor his refusal could avail him. Once more he was called upon to submit, with
the intimation, that if he refused he must bear the consequences. His reply remained what it
had been; and on the 17th of June he was taken[453] down in a boat to Westminster Hall, where
the special commission was sitting. The proceedings at his trial are thus briefly summed up
in the official record:--"Thursday after the feast of St. Barnabas, John Fisher was brought
to the bar by Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower. Pleads not guilty. Venire awarded.
Verdict--guilty. Judgment as usual in cases of treason."[454]

It was a swift sentence, and swiftly to be executed. Five days were allowed him to prepare
himself; and the more austere features of the penalty were remitted with some show of pity.
He was to die by the axe.

[Sidenote: June 22. He is beheaded on Tower Hill.]

Mercy was not to be hoped for. It does not seem to have been sought. He was past eighty. The
earth on the edge of the grave was already crumbling under his feet; and death had little to
make it fearful. When the last morning dawned, he dressed himself carefully--as he said, for
his marriage-day. The distance to Tower Hill was short. He was able to walk; and he tottered
out of the prison-gates, holding in his hand a closed volume of the New Testament. The crowd
flocked about him, and he was heard to pray that, as this book had been his best comfort and
companion, so in that hour it might give him some special strength, and speak to him as from
his Lord. Then opening it at a venture, he read: "This is life eternal, to know Thee, the only
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent." It was the answer to his prayer; and he continued
to repeat the words as he was led forward. On the scaffold he chanted the Te Deum, and then,
after a few prayers, knelt down, and meekly laid his head upon a pillow where neither care
nor fear nor sickness would ever vex it more. Many a spectacle of sorrow had been witnessed
on that tragic spot, but never one more sad than this; never one more painful to think or speak
of. When a nation is in the throes of revolution, wild spirits are abroad in the storm; and
poor human nature presses blindly forward with the burden which is laid upon it, tossing aside
the obstacles in its path with a recklessness which, in calmer hours, it would fear to contemplate.

Sir Thomas More followed, his fortunes linked in death as in life to those of his friend. He
was left to the last--in the hope, perhaps, that the example might produce an effect which
persuasion could not. But the example, if that was the object, worked to far other purpose.
From More's high-tempered nature, such terrors fell harmless, as from enchanted armour. Death
to him was but a passing from one country to another; and he had all along anticipated that
his prison was the antechamber of the scaffold. He had, indeed, taken no pains to avoid it.
The king, according to the unsuspicious evidence of his daughter, Margaret Roper, had not accused
him without cause of exciting a spirit of resistance. He had spent his time in encouraging
Catholics to persevere to martyrdom for their faith. In his many conversations with herself,
he had expressed himself with all freedom, and to others he had doubtless spoken as plainly
as to her.[455]

[Sidenote: June 26. A true bill found against Sir Thomas More.]

[Sidenote: July 1. He is brought to the bar.]

[Sidenote: Substance of the indictment.]

On the 7th of May he was examined by the same persons who examined Fisher; and he was interrogated
again and again in subsequent interviews. His humour did not allow him to answer questions
directly: he played with his catechists, and did not readily furnish them with materials for
a charge. He had corresponded with Fisher in prison, on the conduct which he meant to pursue.
Some of these letters had been burnt; but others were in the hands of the government, and would
have been sufficient to sustain the prosecution, but they preferred his own words from his
own lips. At length sufficient evidence was obtained. On the 26th of June, a true bill was
found against him by the Grand Jury of Middlesex; and on the 1st of July the High Commission
sat again in Westminster Hall, to try the most illustrious prisoner who ever listened to his
sentence there.[456] He walked from the Tower--feebly, however, and with a stick, for he was
weak from long confinement. On appearing at the bar, a chair was brought for him, and he was
allowed to sit. The indictment was then read by the attorney-general. It set forth that Sir
Thomas More, traitorously imagining and attempting to deprive the king of his title as supreme
Head of the Church, did, on the 7th of May, when examined before Thomas Cromwell, the king's
principal secretary, and divers other persons, whether he would accept the king as Head on
earth of the Church of England, pursuant to the statute, refuse to give a direct answer, but
replied, "I will not meddle with any such matters, for I am fully determined to serve God and
to think upon His passion, and my passage out of this world."[457] He was then charged with
having written to Fisher that "The act of parliament was like a sword with two edges; for if
a man answered one way it would confound his soul, and if the other way it would confound his
body."[458] Finally and chiefly, he had spoken treasonable words in the Tower to Rich, the
solicitor-general. Rich had endeavoured to persuade him, as Cranmer had endeavoured in his
previous difficulty at Lambeth, that it was his duty as a subject to obey the law of the land.
"Supposing it was enacted by act of parliament," the solicitor-general had said, "that I, Richard
Rich, should be king, and that it should be treason to deny it, what would be the offence if
you, Sir Thomas More, were to say that I was king?" More had answered that, in his conscience,
he would be bound by the act of parliament, and would be obliged to accept Rich as king. He
would put another case, however. "Suppose it should be enacted by parliament, quod Deus non
esset Deus, and that opposing the act should be treason, if it were asked of him, Richard Rich,
whether he would say Quod Deus non erat Deus, according to this statute, and if he were to
say No, would he not offend?" Rich had replied, "Certainly, because it is impossible, quod
Deus non esset Deus; but why, Master More, can you not accept the king as chief Head of the
Church of England, just as you would that I should be made king, in which case you agree that
you would be obliged to acknowledge me as king?" "To which More, persevering in his treasons,
had answered to Rich, that the cases were not similar, because the king could be made by parliament
and deprived by parliament;[459] but in the first case the subject could not be obliged, because
his consent could not be given for that in parliament."

[Sidenote: The chancellor urges him to submit.]

This was the substance of the indictment. As soon as it was read, the lord chancellor rose,
and told the prisoner that he saw how grievously he had offended the king; it was not too late
to ask for mercy, however, which his Majesty desired to show.

[Sidenote: He trusts, however, to remain in his opinion till death.]

[Sidenote: The jury find a verdict of guilty.]

"My lord," More replied, "I have great cause to thank your honour for your courtesy, but I
beseech Almighty God that I may continue in the mind that I am in through His grace unto death."
To the charges against him he pleaded "not guilty," and answered them at length. He could not
say indeed that the facts were not true; for although he denied that he had "practised" against
the supremacy, he could not say that he had consented to it, or that he ever would consent;
but like the Prior of the Charterhouse, he could not admit himself guilty when he had only
obeyed his conscience. The jury retired to consider, and in a quarter of an hour returned with
their verdict. The chancellor, after receiving it, put the usual question, what the prisoner
could say in arrest of judgment. More replied, but replied with a plea which it was impossible
to recognise, by denouncing the statute under which he was tried, and insisting on the obligation
of obedience to the see of Rome. Thus the sentence was inevitable. It was pronounced in the
ordinary form; but the usual punishment for treason was commuted, as it had been with Fisher,
to death upon the scaffold; and this last favour was communicated as a special instance of
the royal clemency. More's wit was always ready. "God forbid," he answered, "that the king
should show any more such mercy unto any of my friends; and God bless all my posterity from
such pardons."[460]

The pageant was over, for such a trial was little more. As the procession formed to lead back
the "condemned traitor" to the Tower, the commissioners once more adjured him to have pity
on himself, and offered to reopen the court if he would reconsider his resolution. More smiled,
and replied only a few words of graceful farewell.

[Sidenote: His last words to the commission.]

"My lords," he said, "I have but to say that, like as the blessed Apostle St. Paul was present
at the death of the martyr Stephen, keeping their clothes that stoned him, and yet they be
now both saints in heaven, and there shall continue friends for ever, so I trust, and shall
therefore pray, that though your lordships have been on earth my judges, yet we may hereafter
meet in heaven together to our everlasting salvation; and God preserve you all, especially
my sovereign lord the king, and grant him faithful councillors."

[Sidenote: He returns to the Tower.]

[Sidenote: Margaret Roper.]

He then left the hall, and to spare him the exertion of the walk he was allowed to return by
water. At the Tower stairs one of those scenes occurred which have cast so rich a pathos round
the closing story of this illustrious man. "When Sir Thomas," writes the grandson, "was now
come to the Tower wharf, his best beloved child, my aunt Roper, desirous to see her father,
whom she feared she should never see in this world after, to have his last blessing, gave there
attendance to meet him; whom as soon as she had espied she ran hastily unto him, and without
consideration or care for herself, passing through the midst of the throng and guard of men,
who with bills and halberts compassed him round, there openly in the sight of them all embraced
him, and took him about the neck and kissed him, not able to say any word but 'Oh, my father!
oh, my father!' He, liking well her most natural and dear affection towards him, gave her his
fatherly blessing; telling her that whatsoever he should suffer, though he were innocent, yet
it was not without the will of God; and that He knew well enough all the secrets of her heart,
counselling her to accommodate her will to God's blessed pleasure, and to be patient for his loss.

"She was no sooner parted from him, and had gone scarce ten steps, when she, not satisfied
with the former farewell, like one who had forgot herself, ravished with the entire love of
so worthy a father, having neither respect to herself nor to the press of people about him,
suddenly turned back, and ran hastily to him, and took him about the neck and divers times
together kissed him; whereat he spoke not a word, but carrying still his gravity, tears fell
also from his eyes; yea, there were very few in all the troop who could refrain hereat from
weeping, no, not the guard themselves. Yet at last with a full heart she was severed from him,
at which time another of our women embraced him; and my aunt's maid Dorothy Collis did the
like, of whom he said after, it was homely but very lovingly done. All these and also my grandfather
witnessed that they smelt a most odoriferous smell to come from him, according to that of Isaac,
'The scent of my son is as the scent of a field which the Lord has blessed.'"[461]

[Sidenote: The last days in the Tower.]

More's relation with this daughter forms the most beautiful feature in his history. His letters
to her in early life are of unequalled grace, and she was perhaps the only person whom he very
deeply loved. He never saw her again. The four days which remained to him he spent in prayer
and in severe bodily discipline. On the night of the 5th of July, although he did not know
the time which had been fixed for his execution, yet with an instinctive feeling that it was
near, he sent her his hair shirt and whip, as having no more need for them, with a parting
blessing of affection.

He then lay down and slept quietly. At daybreak he was awoke by the entrance of Sir Thomas
Pope, who had come to confirm his anticipations, and to tell him it was the king's pleasure
that he should suffer at nine o'clock that morning. He received the news with utter composure.
"I am much bounden to the king," he said, "for the benefits and honours he has bestowed upon
me; and so help me God, most of all am I bounden to him that it pleaseth his Majesty to rid
me so shortly out of the miseries of this present world."

Pope told him the king desired that he would not "use many words on the scaffold." "Mr. Pope,"
he answered, "you do well to give me warning, for otherwise I had purposed somewhat to have
spoken; but no matter wherewith his Grace should have cause to be offended. Howbeit, whatever
I intended, I shall obey his Highness's command."

He afterwards discussed the arrangements for his funeral, at which he begged that his family
might be present; and when all was settled, Pope rose to leave him. He was an old friend. He
took More's hand and wrung it, and quite overcome, burst into tears.

"Quiet yourself, Mr. Pope," More said, "and be not discomforted, for I trust we shall once
see each other full merrily, when we shall live and love together in eternal bliss."[462]

As soon as he was alone he dressed in his most elaborate costume. It was for the benefit, he
said, of the executioner who was to do him so great a service. Sir William Kingston remonstrated,
and with some difficulty induced him to put on a plainer suit; but that his intended liberality
should not fail, he sent the man a gold angel in compensation, "as a token that he maliced
him nothing, but rather loved him extremely."

[Sidenote: He leaves the Tower.]

"So about nine of the clock he was brought by the Lieutenant out of the Tower, his beard being
long, which fashion he had never before used, his face pale and lean, carrying in his hands
a red cross, casting his eyes often towards heaven." He had been unpopular as a judge, and
one or two persons in the crowd were insolent to him; but the distance was short and soon over,
as all else was nearly over now.

[Sidenote: On the scaffold.]

[Sidenote: Death.]

The scaffold had been awkwardly erected, and shook as he placed his foot upon the ladder. "See
me safe up," he said to Kingston. "For my coming down I can shift for myself." He began to
speak to the people, but the sheriff begged him not to proceed, and he contented himself with
asking for their prayers, and desiring them to bear witness for him that he died in the faith
of the holy Catholic church, and a faithful servant of God and the king. He then repeated the
Miserere psalm on his knees; and when he had ended and had risen, the executioner, with an
emotion which promised ill for the manner in which his part in the tragedy would be accomplished,
begged his forgiveness. More kissed him. "Thou art to do me the greatest benefit that I can
receive," he said. "Pluck up thy spirit, man, and be not afraid to do thine office. My neck
is very short. Take heed therefore that thou strike not awry for saving of thine honesty."
The executioner offered to tie his eyes. "I will cover them myself," he said; and binding them
in a cloth which he had brought with him, he knelt and laid his head upon the block. The fatal
stroke was about to fall, when he signed for a moment's delay while he moved aside his beard.
"Pity that should be cut," he murmured, "that has not committed treason." With which strange
words, the strangest perhaps ever uttered at such a time, the lips most famous through Europe
for eloquence and wisdom closed for ever.

"So," concludes his biographer, "with alacrity and spiritual joy he received the fatal axe,
which no sooner had severed the head from the body, but his soul was carried by angels into
everlasting glory, where a crown of martyrdom was placed upon him which can never fade nor
decay; and then he found those words true which he had often spoken, that a man may lose his
head and have no harm."[463]

This was the execution of Sir Thomas More, an act which was sounded out into the far corners
of the earth, and was the world's wonder as well for the circumstances under which it was perpetrated,
as for the preternatural composure with which it was borne. Something of his calmness may have
been due to his natural temperament, something to an unaffected weariness of a world which
in his eyes was plunging into the ruin of the latter days. But those fair hues of sunny cheerfulness
caught their colour from the simplicity of his faith; and never was there a Christian's victory
over death more grandly evidenced than in that last scene lighted with its lambent humour.

History will rather dwell upon the incidents of the execution than attempt a sentence upon
those who willed that it should be. It was at once most piteous and most inevitable. The hour
of retribution had come at length, when at the hands of the Roman church was to be required
all the righteous blood which it had shed, from the blood of Raymond of Toulouse to the blood
of the last victim who had blackened into ashes at Smithfield. The voices crying underneath
the altar had been heard upon the throne of the Most High, and woe to the generation of which
the dark account had been demanded.

[Sidenote: The effect of these executions in Europe.]

In whatever light, however, we may now think of these things, the effect in Europe was instantaneous
and electrical. The irritation which had accompanied the excommunication by Clement had died
away in the difficulty of executing the censures. The papal party had endeavoured to persuade
themselves that the king was acting under a passing caprice. They had believed that the body
of the people remained essentially Catholic; and they had trusted to time, to discontent, to
mutiny, to the consequences of what they chose to regard as the mere indulgence of criminal
passion, to bring Henry to his senses. To threats and anathemas, therefore, had again succeeded
fair words and promises, and intrigues and flatteries; and the pope and his advisers, so long
accustomed themselves to promise and to mean nothing, to fulminate censures in form, and to
treat human life as a foolish farce upon the stage, had dreamed that others were like themselves.
In the rough awakening out of their delusion, as with a stroke of lightning, popes, cardinals,
kings, emperors, ambassadors, were startled into seriousness; and, the diplomatic meshwork
all rent and broken, they fell at once each into their places, with a sense suddenly forced
upon them that it was no child's play any longer. The King of England was in earnest, it seemed.
The assumption of the supremacy was a fixed purpose, which he was prepared to make a question
of life and death; and with this resolution they must thenceforward make their account.

[Sidenote: The news arrives at Rome of the deaths of the Carthusians.]

On the 1st of June, Cassalis wrote[464] from Rome that the French ambassador had received a
letter concerning certain friars who had been put to death in England for denying the king
to be Head of the Church. The letter had been read in the consistory, and was reported to be
written in a tone of the deepest commiseration. There had been much conversation about it,
the French bishops having been louder than any in their denunciations; and the form of the
execution was described as having been most barbarous. Some of the cardinals had said that
they envied the monks their deaths in such a cause, and wished that they had been with them.
"I desired my informant," Cassalis said, "to suggest to these cardinals, that, if they were
so anxious on the subject, they had better pay a visit to England." And he concluded, in cipher,
"I cannot tell very well what to think of the French. An Italian told me he had heard the Most
Christian king himself say, that although he was obliged to press upon the pope the requests
of the king of England, yet that these requests were preposterous, and could not be granted."

[Sidenote: And of Fisher, which the pope will make of more account than the martyrdom of Becket.]

The deaths of a few poor monks would soon have been forgiven; the execution of Fisher first
really revealed the truth. No sooner was the terrible reply of Henry to his promotion to the
cardinalate made known than the conclave was instantly summoned. Cardinal Tournon described
the scene upon the scaffold in language which moved all his audience to tears.[465] The pope,
in a paroxysm of anger, declared that if he had seen his own nephews murdered in his presence,
it would not have so much affected him; and Cassalis said he heard, from good authority, that
they would do their worst, and intended to make the Bishop of Rochester's death of more account
than that of the martyr St. Thomas.[466]

[Sidenote: All Europe unites in amazed displeasure.]

[Sidenote: Francis remonstrates, and recommends that in future political offenders should be
banished.]

Nor was the anger or the surprise confined to Rome. Through England, through France, through
Flanders, even among the Protestants of Germany, there rose a simultaneous outcry of astonishment.
Rumour flew to and fro with a thousand falsehoods; and the unfortunate leaven of the Anne Boleyn
marriage told fatally to destroy that appearance of probity of motive so indispensable to the
defence of the government. Even Francis I. forgot his caution, and dared to remonstrate. He
wrote to entreat his good brother in future to content himself for the future with banishing
such offenders, and sparing the extremity of his penalties.

Unfortunately, the question which was at issue was European as well as English; and every exile
who was driven from England would have become, like Reginald Pole, a missionary of a holy war
against the infidel king. Whatever else might have been possible, banishment was more perilous
than pardon.

[Sidenote: Henry condescends to explanation.]

[Sidenote: His message to Francis.]

[Sidenote: He had made his laws on good and substantial grounds,]

But the indignation was so general and so serious, that Henry thought it well to offer an explanation
of his conduct, both at home and abroad. With his own people he communicated through the lay
authorities, not choosing to trust himself on this occasion to the clergy. The magistrates
at the quarter sessions were directed "to declare to the people the treasons committed by the
late Bishop of Rochester and Sir Thomas More; who thereby, and by divers secret practices,
of their malicious minds intended to seminate, engender, and breed a most mischievous and seditious
opinion, not only to their own confusion, but also of divers others, who have lately suffered
execution according to their demerits."[467] To Francis, Cromwell instructed Gardiner, who
was ambassador in Paris, to reply very haughtily. The English government, he said had acted
on clear proof of treason; treason so manifest, and tending so clearly to the total destruction
of the commonwealth of the realm, that the condemned persons "were well worthy, if they had
a thousand lives, to have suffered ten times a more terrible death and execution than any of
them did suffer." The laws which the king had made were "not without substantial grounds;"
but had been passed "by great and mature advice, counsel, and deliberation of the whole policy
of the realm, and" were "indeed no new laws, but of great antiquity, now renovate and renewed
in respect to the common weal of the same realm."

[Sidenote: And is much surprised that he should be advised to banish his traitors, giving them
increased opportunity to injure him.]

With respect to the letter of the King of France, Gardiner was to say, it was "not a little
to his Highness's marvel that the French king would ever counsel or advise him, if in case
hereafter any such like offenders should happen to be in the realm, that he should rather banish
them, than in such wise execute them, ... supposing it to be neither the office of a friend
nor a brother, that he would counsel the King's Highness to banish his traitors into strange
parts, where they might have good occasion, time, place, and opportunity to work their feats
of treason and conspiracy the better against the king and this his realm. In which part," concluded
Cromwell, "ye shall somewhat engrieve the matter, after such sort that it may well appear to
the French king that the King's Highness may take those his counsels both strangely and unkindly."[468]

[Sidenote: His elaborate despatch to Cassalis intended for the pope.]

With the German princes Henry was scarcely less imperious;[469] and it is noteworthy that the
most elaborate defence which he condescended to make is that which was sent to Sir Gregory
Cassalis, to be laid before the pope. He chose that the Roman court should understand distinctly
the grounds on which he had acted; and this despatch (which was written by Cromwell) shows
more clearly than any other state paper which remains to us, the light in which the reforming
party desired their conduct to be regarded.

It was written in reply to the letter in which Cassalis reported the irritation of the Roman
court, and enters into the whole ground of complaint against More and Fisher.

[Sidenote: He cannot sufficiently marvel at the pope's displeasure.]

"I have signified," wrote Cromwell, "to the King's Highness the purport of your late letters,
and as they contained many things which were very welcome to his Majesty, so he could not sufficiently
marvel that the pope should have conceived so great offence at the deaths of the Bishop of
Rochester and Sir Thomas More. And albeit his Majesty is not bound to render account of his
actions except to God, whom in thought and deed he is ever desirous to obey; nevertheless that
his royal name may not be evil spoken of by malicious tongues, from want of knowledge of the
truth, I will tell you briefly what has been done in this matter.

[Sidenote: Fisher and More had obstructed the reforms which had been introduced into the realm.]

"After that his Majesty, with the favour and assistance of Almighty God, had brought his cause
to an end, by the consent and authority of unprejudiced persons of the most approved learning
in Christendom,--and after he had confirmed it by the very rule of truth, these men, who had
looked to see a far different conclusion, finding now no hopes of disturbing the settlement
thus made, began to meditate other purposes. And when our good king, according to his princely
duty, was devising measures for the quiet and good order of the realm, and for the correction
of manners now largely fallen to decay, this, so great a benefit to the commonweal, they did,
so far as in them lay, endeavour, though without effect, under pretence of dissembled honesty,
to obstruct and oppose. Manifest proofs of their wicked designs were in the hands of the King's
Grace; but his Majesty consented rather to pass over their offence without notice, hoping to
recall them to a better mind, as having before been in some good estimation with him.

[Sidenote: They had thwarted the measures in progress through parliament,]

"But they in whom ambition, love of self, and a peculiar conceit of wisdom had bred another
persuasion, obstinately abused this kindness of their most noble prince. And when on a certain
day there was order issued for the assembly of the great council of the realm, they made secret
inquiry to learn the measures which would there be treated of. Whatsoever they discovered or
conjectured, forthwith they debated in private council among themselves, arriving upon each
point at conclusions other than those which the interests of the realm did require; and they
fortified those conclusions with such array of arguments and reasons, that with no great labour
the ignorant people might have been dangerously deceived.

[Sidenote: And had organized seditious opposition in the country.]

[Sidenote: They had in consequence been committed to the Tower, where they were treated with
the utmost kindness.]

[Sidenote: Kindness had, however, produced no effect; they had continued to obstruct the government;
and had therefore been tried and condemned by the ordinary laws of the realm.]

"At length knowing that they had incurred the king's displeasure, and fearing lest they might
fail of accomplishing their purposes, they chose out persons on whose courage, readiness, and
devotion to themselves they could depend; and taking these men into their councils, they fed
them with the poison which they had conceived, forgetting their allegiance to their king, and
their duty to their country.[470] Thus were their seditious opinions scattered over the country.
And when his Highness began to trace this impious conspiracy to its source, Sir Thomas More
and the Bishop of Rochester were found to be the undoubted authors of the same; and their guilt
was proved against them by the evidence of their own handwrit, and the confessions of their
own lips. For these causes, therefore, and for many others of like kind, our most gracious
sovereign was compelled to imprison them as rebellious subjects, as disturbers of the public
peace, and as movers of sedition and tumult. Nor was it possible for him to do other than punish
them, unless, after their crimes had been detected, he had so far forgotten his duty as to
leave the contagion to spread unchecked, to the utter destruction of the nation. They were
in consequence thrown into the Tower, where, however, their treatment was far different from
what their demerits had deserved; they were allowed the society of their friends; their own
servants were admitted to attend upon them, and they received all such indulgences in food
and dress as their families desired. Clemency, however, produced no effect on persons in whom
duty and allegiance had given place to treason and malice. They chose rather to persist in
their wicked courses than to make trial by repentance of the king's goodness. For after that
certain laws had been decreed by authority of parliament, and had been by the whole nation
admitted and accepted as expedient for the realm, and agreeable to true religion, they alone
refused their consent to these laws, hoping that something might occur to sustain them in their
impiety; and while professing to have left all care and thought for human things, they were
considering by what arguments, in furtherance of their seditious purposes, they might, to the
common hurt, elude, refute, and disturb the said laws.

"Of this their treason there are proofs extant--letters written, when ink failed them, with
chalk or charcoal, and passed secretly from one to the other. Our most merciful king could
therefore no longer tolerate their grievous faults. He allowed them to be tried by process
of ordinary law. They were found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to death. Their punishment
was milder than that which the law prescribed, or which their crimes had deserved; and many
persons have by this example been brought to a better mind."[471]

To Cromwell evidently the case appeared so clear as to require no apology. To modern writers
it has appeared so clear as to admit of none. The value of the defence turns upon the point
of the actual danger to the state, and the extent to which the conduct of the sufferers imperilled
the progress of the Reformation. As written for the eyes of the pope and cardinals, however,
such a letter could be understood only as daring them to do their worst. It ignored the very
existence of such rules of judgment as the heads of the Roman church would alone acknowledge,
and represented the story as it appeared from the position which England had assumed on its
revolt from its old allegiance.

[Sidenote: The reply of the pope.]

There were no more false efforts at conciliation, and open war thenceforth appeared to be the
only possible relation between the papacy and Henry VIII. Paul III. replied, or designed to
reply, with his far-famed bull of interdict and deposition, which, though reserved at the moment
in deference to Francis of France, and not issued till three years later, was composed in the
first burst of his displeasure.[472] The substance of his voluminous anathemas may be thus
briefly epitomized.

[Sidenote: The bull of interdict and deposition.]

The pope, quoting and applying to himself the words of Jeremiah, "Behold, I have set thee over
nations and kingdoms, that thou mayest root out and destroy, and that thou mayest plant and
build again," addressed Henry as a disobedient vassal. Already lying under the censures of
the church, he had gone on to heap crime on crime; and therefore, a specific number of days
being allowed him to repent and make his submission, at the expiration of this period of respite
the following sentence was to take effect.

The king, with all who abetted him in his crimes, was pronounced accursed--cut off from the
body of Christ, to perish. When he died, his body should lie without burial; his soul, blasted
with anathema, should be cast into hell for ever. The lands of his subjects who remained faithful
to him were laid under an interdict: their children were disinherited, their marriages illegal,
their wills invalid; only by one condition could they escape their fate--by instant rebellion
against the apostate prince. All officers of the crown were absolved from their oaths; all
subjects, secular or ecclesiastic, from their allegiance. The entire nation, under penalty
of excommunication, was commanded no longer to acknowledge Henry as their sovereign.[473] No
true son of the church should hold intercourse with him or his adherents. They must neither
trade with them, speak with them, nor give them food. The clergy, leaving behind a few of their
number to baptize the new-born infants, were to withdraw from the accursed land, and return
no more till it had submitted. If the king, trusting to force, persevered in his iniquity,
the lords and commons of England, dukes, marquises, earls, and all other persons, were required,
under the same penalty of excommunication, to expel him from the throne; and the Christian
princes of Europe were called on to show their fidelity to the Holy See, by aiding in so godly
a work.

In conclusion, as the king had commanded his clergy to preach against the pope in their churches,
so the pope commanded them to retaliate upon the king, and with bell, book, and candle declare
him cursed.

This was loud thunder; nor, when abetted by Irish massacres and English treasons, was it altogether
impotent. If Henry's conceptions of the royal supremacy were something imperious, the papal
supremacy was not more modest in its self-assertion; and the language of Paul III. went far
to justify the rough measures by which his menaces were parried. If any misgiving had remained
in the king's mind on the legitimacy of the course which he had pursued, the last trace of
it must have been obliterated by the perusal of this preposterous bombast.

[Sidenote: Peril of Henry's position.]

For the moment, as I said, the bull was suspended through the interference of Francis. But
Francis remained in communion with the See of Rome: Francis was at that moment labouring to
persuade the Lutheran states in Germany to return to communion with it: and Henry knew, that,
although in their hearts the European powers might estimate the pope's pretences at their true
value, yet the bull of excommunication might furnish a convenient and dangerous pretext against
him in the event of a Catholic combination. His position was full of peril; and in spite of
himself, he was driven once more to seek for an alliance among the foreign Protestants, before
the French intrigues should finally anticipate him.

[Sidenote: Intrigues of the French in Germany.]

That he really might be too late appeared an immediate likelihood. The quarrel between the
Lutherans and the followers of Zwingli, the Anabaptist anarchy and the increasing confusion
throughout the Protestant states, had so weighed on Luther's spirit that he was looking for
the end of all things and the coming of Christ; and although Luther himself never quailed,
too many "murmurers in the wilderness" were looking wistfully back into Egypt. The French king,
availing himself skilfully of the turning tide, had sent the Bishop of Paris to the courts
of Saxony and Bavaria, in the beginning of August, to feel his way towards a reconciliation;
and his efforts had been attended with remarkable success.

[Sidenote: Probability of a reconciliation of the Lutherans with the See of Rome.]

The bishop had been in communication with Melancthon and many of the leading Lutheran theologians
upon the terms on which they would return to the church. The Protestant divines had drawn up
a series of articles, the first of which was a profession of readiness to recognise the authority
of the pope;[474] accompanying this statement with a declaration that they would accept any
terms not plainly unjust and impious. These articles were transmitted to Paris, and again retransmitted
to Germany, with every prospect of a mutually satisfactory result; and Melancthon was waiting
only till the bishop could accompany him, to go in person to Paris, and consult with the Sorbonne.[475]

[Sidenote: Of which Henry is partly the cause.]

[Sidenote: Henry is driven to conciliate the German princes.]

This momentary (for it was only momentary) weakness of the German Protestants was in part owing
to their want of confidence in Henry VIII.[476] The king had learnt to entertain a respect
for the foreign Reformers, far unlike the repugnance of earlier years; but the prospect of
an alliance with them had hitherto been too much used by him as a weapon with which to menace
the Catholic powers, whose friendship he had not concealed that he would prefer. The Protestant
princes had shrunk therefore, and wisely, from allowing themselves to be made the instruments
of worldly policy; and the efforts at a combination had hitherto been illusive and ineffectual.
Danger now compelled the king to change his hesitation into more honest advances. If Germany
accepted the mediation of Francis, and returned to communion with Rome; and if, under the circumstances
of a reunion, a general council were assembled; there could be little doubt of the attitude
in which a council, called together under such auspices, would place itself towards the movement
in England. To escape so imminent a peril, Henry was obliged (as Elizabeth after him) to seek
the support of a party from which he had shrunk: he was forced, in spite of himself, to identify
his cause with the true cause of freedom, and consequently to admit an enlarged toleration
of the Reformed doctrines in his own dominions. There could be little doubt of the support
of the Germans, if they could be once assured that they would not again be trifled with; and
a Protestant league, the steady object of Cromwell's efforts, seemed likely at length to be
realized.

[Sidenote: August. Nature of the relations of the Tudors to the German Protestants.]

[Sidenote: Mission of the Bishop of Hereford to counteract the French.]

Different indeed would have been the future, both of England and for Germany, if such a league
had been possible, if the pressure which compelled this most natural alliance had continued
till it had cemented into rock. But the Tudors, representatives in this, as in so many other
features of their character, of the people whom they governed, could never cordially unite
themselves with a form of thought which permitted resistance to authority, and which they regarded
as anarchic and revolutionary. They consented, when no alternative was left them, to endure
for short periods a state of doubtful cordiality; but the connexion was terminated at the earliest
moment which safety permitted; in their hatred of disorder (for this feeling is the key alike
to the strength and to the weakness of the Tudor family), they preferred the incongruities
of Anglicanism to a complete reformation; and a "midge-madge"[477] of contradictory formularies
to the simplicity of the Protestant faith. In essentials, the English movement was political
rather than spiritual. What was gained for the faith, we owe first to Providence, and then
to those accidents, one of which had now arisen, which compelled at intervals a deeper and
a broader policy. To counteract the French emissaries, Christopher Mount, in August, and in
September, Fox, Bishop of Hereford, were despatched to warn the Lutheran princes against their
intrigues, and to point out the course which the interests of Northern Europe in the existing
conjuncture required. The bishop's instructions were drawn by the king. He was to proceed direct
to the court of Saxony, and, after presenting his letters of credit, was to address the elector
to the following effect:

[Sidenote: Henry's message to the Elector of Saxony.]

[Sidenote: He desires, in connexion with other princes who have the same cause at heart, to
maintain the middle way of truth, according to God's word.]

[Sidenote: September. He has heard that the Lutherans are again inclining to Rome; and he desires
to know their true intentions.]

"Besides and beyond the love, amity, and friendship which noble blood and progeny had carnally
caused and continued in the heart of the King's Highness towards the said duke and his progenitors,
and besides that kindness also which of late by mutual communication of gratuities had been
not a little augmented and increased between them, there was also stirred up in the heart of
the King's Highness a spiritual love and favour towards the said duke and his virtuous intents
and proceedings, for that the said duke persisted and continued in his most virtuous mind to
set forth, maintain, and defend the sincere teaching of the gospel and the perfect true understanding
of the word of God. In that matter the King's Highness, also illuminated with the same spirit
of truth, and wholly addict and dedicate to the advancement thereof, had employed great pain
and travail to bring the same to the knowledge of his people and subjects, intending also further
and further to proceed therein, as his Grace by good consultation should perceive might tend
to the augmentation of the glory of God and the true knowledge of his word. His said Majesty
was of such sincere meaning in the advancing [hereof] as his Grace would neither headily, without
good advisement, and consultation, and conference with his friends, go in any part beyond the
said truth, ne for any respect tarry or stay on this side the truth, but would proceed in the
right straight mean way assuredly agreed upon. He had known of certainty divers who by their
immoderate zeal or the excessive appetite to novelties had from darkness proceeded to much
more darkness, wherein the Anabaptists and sacramentarians were guilty; so by secret report
he had been advertised, that upon private communications and conferences, the learned men there
[in Germany] had in certain points and articles yielded and relented from their first asseveration;
by reason whereof it was much doubted whether by other degrees they might be dissuaded in some
of the rest. The King's Highness therefore, being very desirous to know the truth therein,
and to be ascertained in what points and articles the learned men there were so assuredly and
constantly resolved as by no persuasion of man they could be turned from the same, had sent
the Bishop of Hereford to the said duke, desiring and praying him in respect of the premises
to entertain the said bishop friendly and familiarly concerning the matter aforesaid, as the
mutual love carnally, and the zeal of both princes to the increase of the glory of God spiritually,
did require."[478]

[Sidenote: He dissuades a council.]

[Sidenote: But if a council is to meet, let them come to a common understanding with England.]

[Sidenote: The bishop was to apologize for all past coolness,]

[Sidenote: And to conclude with fresh warnings against the pope.]

The bishop was then to speak of the council, the assembling of which he understood that the
German princes so much desired. He was to dissuade them from pressing it, to the extent of
his ability. They would find themselves opposed inevitably in all essential matters by the
pope, the emperor, and the French king, whose factions united would outnumber and outvote them;
and in the existing state of Europe, a general council would only compromise their position
and embarrass their movements. If, however, notwithstanding his remonstrances, the princes
persisted in their wish, then the bishop was to urge them to come to some understanding with
England on the resolutions which they desired to maintain. Let them communicate to the English
bishops such points "as they would stick to without relenting;" and the two countries, "standing
together, would be so much stronger to withstand their adversaries." Without definitely promising
to sign the Confession of Augsburg, Henry held out strong hopes that he might sign that Confession,
if they would send representatives to London to discuss the articles of it with himself.[479]
The bishop was to apologize for any previous slackness on the king's part in his communications
with the elector, and to express his hopes, that for the future their relations might be those
of cordial unanimity. He was especially to warn the elector to beware of re-admitting the papal
supremacy under any pretext. The English had shaken off the pope, "provoked thereunto in such
wise as would have provoked them rather to have expelled him from them by wrong, than to suffer
him so to oppress them with injuries." If in Germany they "opened the great gate" to let him
in again, he would rebuild "the fortresses that were thrown down, and by little and little
bring all to the former estate again." Finally, with respect to the council--if a council there
was to be--they must take care that it was held in a place indifferent, where truth might be
heard or spoken; "considering that else in a council, were not the remedy that all good men
sought, but the mischief that all good men did abhor."

These advances, consented to by Henry, were the act of Cromwell, and were designed as the commencement
of a Foedus Evangelicum--a league of the great Reforming nations of Europe. It was a grand
scheme, and history can never cease to regret that it was grasped at with too faint a hand.
The bishop succeeded in neutralizing partially the scheming of the French, partially in attracting
the sympathies of the German powers towards England; but the two great streams of the Teutonic
race, though separated by but a narrow ridge of difference, were unable to reach a common channel.
Their genius drove them into courses which were to run side by side for centuries, yet ever
to remain divided. And if the lines in which their minds have flowed seem to be converging
at last, and if hereafter Germans and English are again to unite in a single faith, the remote
meeting point is still invisible, and the terms of possible agreement can be but faintly conjectured.

[386] It is remarkable that in this paper it seems to be assumed, that the pope would have
fulfilled this engagement if Henry had fully submitted. "He openly confessed," it says, "that
our master had the right; but because our prince and master would not prejudicate for his jurisdictions,
and uphold his usurped power by sending a proctor, ye may evidently here see that this was
only the cause why the judgment of the Bishop of Rome was not given in his favour; whereby
it may appear that there lacked not any justice in our prince's cause, but that ambition, vain
glory, and too much mundanity were the lets thereof."

further, than that it was a desperate undertaking, encouraged by the uncertainty of the succession,
and by a faith in prophecies (Confession of Sir William Neville: Rolls House MS.), to murder
the king. Ryce was tried in Michaelmas term, 1531, and executed. His uncle, who passed under

of Henry's reign.--See State Papers, Vol. IV. pp. 647, 651, 653; Vol. VIII. pp. 219, 227, &c.

[401] History is never weary of repeating its warnings against narrow judgments. A year ago
we believed that the age of arbitrary severity was past. In the interval we have seen the rebellion
in India; the forms of law have been suspended, and Hindoo rajahs have been executed for no
greater crime than the possession of letters from the insurgents. The evidence of a treasonable
animus has been sufficient to ensure condemnation; and in the presence of necessity the principles
of the sixteenth century have been instantly revived.--April, 1858.

[402] Act of Supremacy, 26 Hen. VIII. cap. 1.

[403] To guard against misconception, an explanatory document was drawn up by the government
at the time of the passing of the act, which is highly curious and significant. "The King's
Grace," says this paper, "hath no new authority given hereby that he is recognised as supreme
Head of the Church of England; for in that recognition is included only that he have such power
as to a king of right appertaineth by the law of God; and not that he should take any spiritual
power from spiritual ministers that is given to them by the Gospel. So that these words, that
the king is supreme Head of the Church, serve rather to declare and make open to the world,
that the king hath power to suppress all such extorted powers as well of the Bishop of Rome
as of any other within this realm, whereby his subjects might be grieved; and to correct and
remove all things whereby any unquietness might arise amongst the people; rather than to prove
that he should pretend thereby to take any powers from the successors of the apostles that
was given to them by God. And no man may with conscience judge that they did so, except they
can prove that the words of the statute, whereby the king is recognised to be the supreme Head
of the Church of England, should show expressly that they intended to do so; as it is apparent
that they do not.

"There is none authority of Scripture that will prove that any one of the apostles should be
head of the universal Church of Christendom. And if any of the doctors of the church or the
clergy have, by any of their laws or decrees, declared any Scripture to be of that effect,
kings and princes, taking to them their counsellors, and such of their clergy as they shall
think most indifferent, ought to be judges whether those declarations and laws be made according
to the truth of Scripture or not; because it is said in the Psalms, 'Et nunc Reges intelligite,
erudimini qui judicatis terram': that is, 'O kings! understand ye, be ye learned that judge
the world.' And certain it is that the Scripture is always true; and there is nothing that
the doctors and clergy might, through dread and affection, [so well] be deceived in, as in
things concerning the honour, dignity, power, liberty, jurisdiction, and riches of the bishops
and clergy; and some of them have of likelihood been deceived therein."--Heads of Arguments
concerning the Power of the Pope and the Royal Supremacy: Rolls House MS.

[404] 26 Hen. VIII. cap. 2.

[405] 26 Hen. VIII. cap. 13.

[406] More warned Fisher of this. He "did send Mr. Fisher word by a letter that Mr. Solicitor
had showed him, that it was all one not to answer, and to say against the statute what a man
would, as all the learned men in England would justify."--State Papers, Vol. I. p. 434.

[407] The act was repealed in 1547, I Edw. VI. cap. 12. The explanation which is there given
of the causes which led to the enactment of it is temperate and reasonable. Subjects, says
that statute, should obey rather for love of their prince than for fear of his laws: "yet such
times at some time cometh in the commonwealth, that it is necessary and expedient for the repressing
of the insolence and unruliness of men, and for the foreseeing and providing of remedies against
rebellions, insurrections, or such mischiefs as God, sometime with us displeased, doth inflict
and lay upon us, or the devil, at God's permission, to assay the good and God's elect, doth
sow and set among us,--the which Almighty God and man's policy hath always been content to
have stayed--that sharper laws as a harder bridle should be made."

[408] 26 Henry VIII. cap. 14: "An Act for Nomination and Consecration of Suffragans within
the Realm." I have already stated my impression that the method of nomination to bishopricks
by the crown, as fixed by the 20th of the 25th of Henry VIII., was not intended to be perpetual.
A further evidence of what I said will be found in the arrangements under the present act for
the appointment of suffragans. The king made no attempt to retain the patronage. The bishop
of each diocese was to nominate two persons, and between these the crown was bound to choose.

  "November, 1534.

" ... In addition, the Count de Nassau and yourself may go further in sounding the King about
the Count's proposal--I mean for the marriage of our cousin the Princess of England with the
Duke d'Angoulesme. The Grand Master, I understand, when the Count spoke of it, seemed to enter
into the suggestion, and mentioned the displeasure which the King of England had conceived
against Anne Boleyn. I am therefore sincerely desirous that the proposal should be well considered,
and you will bring it forward as you shall see opportunity. You will make the King and the
Grand Master feel the importance of the connexion, the greatness which it would confer on the
Duke d'Angoulesme, the release of the English debt, which can be easily arranged, and the assurance
of the realm of France.

"Such a marriage will be, beyond comparison, more advantageous to the King, his realm, and
his children, than any benefit for which he could hope from Milan; while it can be brought
about with no considerable difficulty. But be careful what you say, and how you say it. Speak
alone to the King and alone to the Grand Master, letting neither of them know that you have
spoken to the other. Observe carefully how the King is inclined, and, at all events, be secret;
so that if he does not like the thing, the world need not know that it has been thought of.

"Should it be suggested to you--as it may be--that Anne Boleyn may be driven desperate, and
may contrive something against the Princess's life, we answer that we can hardly believe her
so utterly abandoned by conscience: or, again, the Duke of Anjou may possibly object to the
exaltation of his brother; in which case we shall consent willingly to have our cousin marry
the Duke of Anjou; and, in that case, beyond the right which appertains to the Duke and Princess
from their fathers and mothers, they and either of them shall have the kingdom of Denmark,
and we will exert ourselves to compose any difficulties with our Holy Father the Pope."--MS.

[434] Father Maurice says that the jury desired to acquit; and after debating for a night,
were preparing a verdict of Not Guilty; when Cromwell, hearing of their intention, went in
person to the room where they were assembled, and threatened them with death unless they did
what he called their duty. The story is internally improbable. The conditions of the case did
not admit of an acquittal; and the conduct attributed to Cromwell is inconsistent with his
character. Any doubt which might remain, in the absence of opposing testimony, is removed by
the record of the trial, from which it appears clearly that the jury were not returned until
the 29th of April, and that the verdict was given in on the same day.--Baga de Secretis; Appendix

Charterhouse here in London which were committed to Newgate for their traitorous behaviour,
long time continued against the King's Grace, be almost dispatched by the hand of God, as may

I am not sorry, but would that all such as love not the King's Highness and his worldly honour
were in like case."--Bedyll to Cromwell: Suppression of the Monasteries, p. 162.

[441] Latimer alludes to the story with no disapproval of the execution of these men--as we
should not have disapproved of it, if we had lived then, unless we had been Anabaptists ourselves.
A brave death, Latimer says, is no proof of a good cause. "This is no good argument, my friends;
this is a deceivable argument: he went to his death boldly--ergo, he standeth in a just quarrel.
The Anabaptists that were burnt here in divers towns in England (as I heard of credible men--I
saw them not myself), went to their death intrepide, as you will say; without any fear in the
world--cheerfully: well, let them go. There was in the old times another kind of poisoned heretics
that were called Donatists; and these heretics went to their execution as they should have
gone to some jolly recreation or banquet."--Latimer's Sermons, p. 160.

[442] He wrote to the king on the 14th of June, in consequence of an examination at the Tower;
but that letter could not have been spoken of on the trial of the Carthusians.--See State Papers,
Vol. I. p. 431.

[443] "I had the confessor alone in very secret communication concerning certain letters of
Mr. Fisher's, of which Father Reynolds made mention in his examination; which the said Fisher
promised the King's Grace that he never showed to any other man, neither would. The said confessor
hath confessed to me that the said Fisher sent to him, to the said Reynolds, and to one other
brother of them, the copy of his said letters directed to the King's Grace, and the copy of
the king's answer also. He hath knowledged to me also that the said Fisher sent unto them with
the said copies a book of his, made in defence of the King's Grace's first marriage, and also
Abel's book, and one other book made by the emperour's ambassador, as I suppose."--Bedyll to
Cromwell: Suppression of the Monasteries, pp. 45, 46.

[444] The accounts are consistent on this subject with a single exception. A letter is extant
from Fisher, in which he complained of suffering from the cold and from want of clothes. This
must have been an accident. More was evidently treated well (see More's Life of More); and
all the circumstances imply that they were allowed to communicate freely with their friends,
and to receive whatever comforts their friends were pleased to send them. The official statements
on this subject are too positive and too minute to admit of a doubt. Cromwell writes thus to
Cassalis: "Carceribus mancipati tractabantur humanius atque mitius quam par fuisset pro eorum
demeritis; per Regem illis licebat proximorum colloquio et consuetudine frui. Ii fuerant illis
appositi præscriptique ministri quos a vinclis immunes antea fidos charosque habebant; id cibi

[448] Compare State Papers, Vol. I. pp. 431-436, with the Reports of the trials in the Baga
de Secretis. Burnet has hastily stated that no Catholic was ever punished for merely denying
the supremacy in official examinations. He has gone so far, indeed, as to call the assertions
of Catholic writers to this effect "impudent falsehoods." Whether any Catholic was prosecuted
who had not given other cause for suspicion, I do not know; but it is quite certain that Haughton
and Fisher were condemned solely on the ground of their answers on these occasions, and that
no other evidence was brought against them. The government clearly preferred this evidence
as the most direct and unanswerable, for in both those cases they might have produced other
witnesses had they cared to do so.

the Deputy Keeper of the Records.

[455] If his opinions had been insufficient for his destruction, there was an influence at
court which left no hope to him: the influence of one whose ways and doings were better known
then than they have been known to her modern admirers. "On a time," writes his grandson, "when
he had questioned my aunt Roper of his wife and children, and the state of his house in his
absence, he asked her at last how Queen Anne did. 'In faith, father,' said she, 'never better.
There is nothing else at the court but dancing and sporting.' 'Never better?' said he; 'alas,
Meg, alas, it pitieth me to remember unto what misery she will shortly come. These dances of
hers will prove such dances that she will spurn our heads off like footballs, but it will not
be long ere her head will dance the like dance.'"--More's Life of More, p. 244.

[456] The composition of the commission is remarkable. When Fisher was tried, Lord Exeter sate
upon it. On the trial of More, Lord Exeter was absent, but his place was taken by his cousin,
Lord Montague, Reginald Pole's eldest brother, and Lady Salisbury's son. Willingly or unwillingly,
the opposition nobles were made participes criminis in both these executions.

[457] I take my account of the indictment from the government record. It is, therefore, their
own statement of their own case.--Trial of Sir Thomas More: Baga de Secretis, pouch 7, bundle 3.

[458] Fisher had unhappily used these words on his own examination; and the identity of language
was held a proof of traitorous confederacy.

of friendship, which would not by any report conceive other opinion of so noble a prince as
he is than were both just and honourable; but also to note in them less constancy of judgment
than he verily thinketh they have. And hereupon the said Bishop shall dissuade them from giving
credit to any such report, as whereby they shall offend God in the judgment of evil upon their
neighbour; and cause his Majesty to muse that they would of him, being a prince of honour,
conceive any other opinion than his honour and friendship towards them doth require. Setting
this forth with such a stomach and courage as they may not only perceive the false traitorous

[472] Paul himself said that it was reserved at the intercession of the Princes of Europe.
Intercession is too mild a word for the species of interference which was exerted. The pope
sent a draft of the intended bull to France; and the king having no disposition to countenance
exaggerated views of papal authority, spoke of it as impudentissimum quoddam breve; and said
that he must send the Cardinal of Lorraine to Rome, to warn his Holiness that his pretence
of setting himself above princes could by no means be allowed; by such impotent threats he
might not only do no good, but he would make himself a laughing-stock to all the world.--Christopher

was attached to it, "Modo secundum verbum Dei omnia judicet;" and that this had been added
at the desire of the French king; which Mount did not believe--and indeed found great difficulty
in discovering any credible account of what was really taking place, beyond the fact that the
Lutherans were so anxious for an agreement, that they were walking with open eyes into a net
which would strangle them.--See State Papers, Vol. VII. p. 630, &c.

CHAPTER X.

THE VISITATION OF THE MONASTERIES.

[Sidenote: Exemption of the religious houses from control.]

[Sidenote: Contrast in the monasteries between theory and fact.]

[Sidenote: The original intention.]

Many high interests in England had been injured by the papal jurisdiction; but none had suffered
more vitally than those of the monastic establishments. These establishments had been injured,
not by fines and exactions,--for oppression of this kind had been terminated by the statutes
of provisors,--but because, except at rare and remote intervals, they had been left to themselves,
without interference and without surveillance. They were deprived of those salutary checks
which all human institutions require if they are to be saved from sliding into corruption.
The religious houses, almost without exception, were not amenable to the authority of the bishops.
The several societies acknowledged obedience only to the heads of their order, who resided
abroad; or to the pope, or to some papal delegate. Thus any regularly conducted visitation
was all but impossible. The foreign superiors, who were forbidden by statute to receive for
their services more than certain limited and reasonable fees, would not undertake a gratuitous
labour; and the visitations, attempted with imperfect powers[480] by the English archbishops,
could be resisted successfully under pleas of exemption and obedience to the rules of the orders.[481]
Thus the abbeys had gone their own way, careless of the gathering indignation with which they
were regarded by the people, and believing that in their position they held a sacred shield
which would protect them for ever. In them, as throughout the Catholic system, the sadness
of the condition into which they had fallen was enhanced by the contrast between the theory
and the degenerate reality. Originally, and for many hundred years after their foundation,
the regular clergy were the finest body of men of which mankind in their chequered history
can boast. They lived to illustrate, in systematic simplicity, the universal law of sacrifice.
In their three chief vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, they surrendered everything
which makes life delightful. Their business on earth was to labour and to pray: to labour for
other men's bodies, to pray for other men's souls. Wealth flowed in upon them; the world, in
its instinctive loyalty to greatness, laid its lands and its possessions at their feet; and
for a time was seen the notable spectacle of property administered as a trust, from which the
owners reaped no benefit, except increase of toil. The genius of the age expended its highest
efforts to provide fitting tabernacles for the divine spirit which they enshrined; and alike
in village and city, the majestic houses of the Father of mankind and his especial servants
towered up in sovereign beauty, symbols of the civil supremacy of the church, and of the moral
sublimity of life and character which had won the homage and the admiration of the Christian
nations. Through the storms of war and conquest the abbeys of the middle ages floated, like
the ark upon the waves of the flood, inviolate in the midst of violence, through the awful
reverence which surrounded them.

[Sidenote: The life of "religion" left it in the 14th century.]

The soul of "religion,"[482] however, had died out of it for many generations before the Reformation.
At the close of the fourteenth century, Wycliffe had cried that the rotting trunk cumbered
the ground, and should be cut down. It had not been cut down; it had been allowed to stand
for a hundred and fifty more years; and now it was indeed plain that it could remain no longer.
The boughs were bare, the stem was withered, the veins were choked with corruption; the ancient
life-tree of monasticism would blossom and bear fruit no more. Faith had sunk into superstition;
duty had died into routine; and the monks, whose technical discipline was forgotten, and who
were set free by their position from the discipline of ordinary duty, had travelled swiftly
on the downhill road of human corruption.

[Sidenote: The darker scandals not to be touched upon.]

[Sidenote: Political and administrative abuses.]

Only light reference will be made in this place to the darker scandals by which the abbeys
were dishonoured. Such things there really were, to an extent which it may be painful to believe,
but which evidence too abundantly proves. It is better, however, to bury the recollection of
the more odious forms of human depravity; and so soon as those who condemn the Reformation
have ceased to deny what the painfulness of the subject only has allowed to remain disputed,
the sins of the last English monks will sleep with them in their tombs. Here, in spite of such
denials, the most offensive pictures shall continue to be left in the shade; and persons who
wish to gratify their curiosity, or satisfy their unbelief, may consult the authorities for
themselves.[483] I shall confine my own efforts rather to the explanation of the practical,
and, in the highest sense of the word, political abuses, which, on the whole, perhaps, told
most weightily on the serious judgment of the age.

[Sidenote: The abbeys intended for the benefit of the poor.]

[Sidenote: Fraudulent neglect of duty.]

[Sidenote: Illegal division of profits.]

[Sidenote: Dishonest administration of the lands.]

[Sidenote: Neglect of hospitality. Neglect of the poor.]

[Sidenote: Simony and profligacy.]

The abbeys, then, as the State regarded them, existed for the benefit of the poor. The occupants
for the time being were themselves under vows of poverty; they might appropriate to their personal
use no portion of the revenues of their estates; they were to labour with their own hands,
and administer their property for the public advantage. The surplus proceeds of the lands,
when their own modest requirements had been supplied, were to be devoted to the maintenance
of learning, to the exercise of a liberal hospitality, and to the relief of the aged, the impotent,
and the helpless. The popular clamour of the day declared that these duties were systematically
neglected; that two-thirds, at least, of the religious bodies abused their opportunities unfairly
for their own advantage; and this at a time when the obligations of all property were defined
as strictly as its rights, and negligent lay owners were promptly corrected by the State whenever
occasion required. The monks, it was believed, lived in idleness, keeping vast retinues of
servants to do the work which they ought to have done themselves.[484] They were accused of
sharing dividends by mutual connivance, although they were forbidden by their rule to possess
any private property whatever, and of wandering about the country in the disguise of laymen
in pursuit of forbidden indulgences.[485] They were bound by their statutes to keep their houses
full, and if their means were enlarged, to increase their numbers; they were supposed to have
allowed their complement to fall to half, and sometimes to a third, of the original foundation,
fraudulently reserving the enlarged profits to themselves. It was thought, too, that they had
racked their estates; that having a life-interest only, they had encumbered them with debts,
mortgages, and fines; that in some cases they had wholly alienated lands, of which they had
less right to dispose than a modern rector of his glebe.[486] In the meantime, it was said
that the poor were not fed, that hospitality was neglected, that the buildings and houses were
falling to waste, that fraud and Simony prevailed among them from the highest to the lowest,
that the abbots sold the presentations to the benefices which were in their gift, or dishonestly
retained the cures of souls in their own hands, careless whether the duties of the parishes
could or could not be discharged; and that, finally, the vast majority of the monks themselves
were ignorant, self-indulgent, profligate, worthless, dissolute.

[Sidenote: A hundred houses suppressed by Henry V.]

[Sidenote: Visitation of 1489.]

These, in addition to the heavier accusations, were the charges which the popular voice had
for more than a century brought against the monasteries, which had led Wycliffe to denounce
their existence as intolerable, the House of Commons to petition Henry IV. for the secularization
of their property, and Henry V. to appease the outcry, by the suppression of more than a hundred,
as an ineffectual warning to the rest.[487] At length, in the year 1489, at the instigation
of Cardinal Morton, then Archbishop of Canterbury, a commission was issued by Innocent VIII.
for a general investigation throughout England into the behaviour of the regular clergy.

But this overwhelming document need not be transcribed further.

Offences similar in kind and scarcely less gross were exposed at Waltham, at St. Andrew's,
Northampton, at Calais, and at other places.[489] Again, a reprimand was considered to be an
adequate punishment.

[Sidenote: Visitation of archbishop Warham in 1511.]

Evils so deep and so abominable would not yield to languid treatment; the visitation had been
feeble in its execution and limited in extent. In 1511 a second was attempted by Archbishop
Warham.[490] This inquiry was more partial than the first, yet similar practices were brought
to light: women introduced to religious houses; nuns and abbesses accusing one another of incontinency;
the alms collected in the chapels squandered by the monks in licentiousness. Once more, no
cure was attempted beyond a paternal admonition.[491] A third effort was made by Wolsey twelve
years later: again exposure followed, and again no remedy was found.

If the condition of the abbeys had appeared intolerable before investigation, still less could
it be endured when the justice of the accusations against them had been ascertained. But the
church was unequal to the work of self-reformation. Parliament alone could decide on the measures
which the emergency made necessary; and preparatory to legislation, the true circumstances
and present character of the religious bodies throughout the whole country were to be ascertained
accurately and completely.

[Sidenote: Issue of a commission for a general visitation.]

[Sidenote: Character of the commissioners.]

[Sidenote: First intention of the crown to reform and not to destroy.]

Accordingly, in the summer of 1535, directly after Sir Thomas More's execution, Cromwell, now
"vicegerent of the king in all his ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the realm,"[492] issued
a commission for a general visitation of the religious houses, the universities, and other
spiritual corporations. The persons appointed to conduct the inquiry were Doctors Legh, Leyton,
and Ap Rice, ecclesiastical lawyers in holy orders, with various subordinates. Legh and Leyton,
the two principal commissioners, were young, impetuous men, likely to execute their work rather
thoroughly than delicately; but, to judge by the surviving evidence, they were as upright and
plain-dealing as they were assuredly able and efficient. It is pretended by some writers that
the inquiry was set on foot with a preconceived purpose of spoliation; that the duty of the
visitors was rather to defame roundly than to report truly; and that the object of the commission
was merely to justify an act of appropriation which had been already determined. The commission
of Pope Innocent, with the previous inquiries, puts to silence so gratuitous a supposition;
while it is certain that antecedent to the presentation of the report, an extensive measure
of suppression was not so much as contemplated. The directions to the visitors,[493] the injunctions
they were to carry with them to the various houses, the private letters to the superiors, which
were written by the king and by Cromwell,[494] show plainly that the first object was to reform
and not to destroy; and it was only when reformation was found to be conclusively hopeless,
that the harder alternative was resolved upon. The report itself is no longer extant. Bonner
was directed by Queen Mary to destroy all discoverable copies of it, and his work was fatally
well executed. We are able, however, to replace its contents to some extent, out of the despatches
of the commissioners.

[Sidenote: The commissioners issue an inhibition against the bishops.]

Their discretionary powers were unusually large, as appears from the first act with which the
visitors commenced operations. On their own responsibility, they issued an inhibition against
the bishops, forbidding them to exercise any portion of their jurisdiction while the visitation
was in progress. The sees themselves were to be inspected; and they desired to make the ground
clear before they moved. When the amazed bishops exclaimed against so unheard-of an innovation,
Doctor Legh justified the order by saying, that it was well to compel the prelates to know
and feel their new position; and in the fact of their suspension by a royal commission, to
"agnize" the king as the source of episcopal authority.[495]

[Sidenote: And commence work at Oxford, Sept. 12.]

[Sidenote: Condition of the University.]

[Sidenote: Efforts of the heads of houses.]

[Sidenote: Parish clergy idling at the colleges under pretence of study.]

[Sidenote: The disturbers of order and quiet.]

[Sidenote: Revolution of studies.]

Truly it was an altered world since the bishops sent in their answer to the complaints of the
House of Commons. The visitors, in this haughty style, having established their powers, began
work with the university of Oxford. Their time was short, for parliament was to meet early
in the spring, when their report was to be submitted to it; and their business meanwhile was
not only to observe and inquire, but any reforms which were plainly useful and good, they were
themselves to execute. They had no time for hesitation, therefore; and they laid their hands
to the task before them with a promptitude at which we can only wonder. The heads of houses,
as may be supposed, saw little around them which was in need of reform. A few students of high
genius and high purposes had been introduced into the university, as we have seen, by Wolsey;
and these had been assiduously exiled or imprisoned. All suspected books had been hunted out.
There had been fagot processions in High-street, and bonfires of New Testaments at Carfax.
The daily chapels, we suppose, had gone forward as usual, and the drowsy lectures on the Schoolmen;
while "towardly young men" who were venturing stealthily into the perilous heresy of Greek,
were eyed askance by the authorities, and taught to tremble at their temerity. All this we
might have looked for; and among the authorities themselves, also, the world went forward in
a very natural manner. There was comfortable living in the colleges: so comfortable, that many
of the country clergy preferred Oxford and Cambridge to the monotony of their parishes, and
took advantage of a clause in a late act of parliament, which recognised a residence at either
of the universities as an excuse for absence from tedious duties. "Divers and many persons,"
it was found, "beneficed with cure of souls, and being not apt to study by reason of their
age or otherwise, ne never intending before the making of the said act to travel in study,
but rather minding their own ease and pleasure, colourably to defraud the same good statute,
did daily and commonly resort to the said universities, where, under pretence of study, they
continued and abode, living dissolutely; nothing profiting themselves in learning, but consumed
the time in idleness and pastimes and insolent pleasures, giving occasion and evil example
thereby to the young men and students within the universities, and occupying such rooms and
commodities as were instituted for the maintenance and relief of poor scholars."[496] These
persons were not driven away by the heads of houses as the Christian Brothers had been; they
were welcomed rather as pleasant companions. In comfortable conservatism they had no tendencies
to heresy, but only to a reasonable indulgence of their five bodily senses. Doubtless, therefore,
the visitors found Oxford a pleasant place, and cruelly they marred the enjoyments of it. Like
a sudden storm of rain, they dropt down into its quiet precincts. Heedless of rights of fellows
and founders' bequests, of sleepy dignities and established indolences, they re-established
long dormant lectures in the colleges. In a few little days (for so long only they remained)
they poured new life into education. They founded fresh professorships--professorships of Polite
Latin, professorships of Philosophy, Divinity, Canon Law, Natural Sciences--above all of the
dreaded Greek; confiscating funds to support them. For the old threadbare text-books, some
real teaching was swiftly substituted. The idle residents were noted down, soon to be sent
home by parliament to their benefices, under pain of being compelled, like all other students,
to attend lectures, and, in their proper persons, "keep sophisms, problems, disputations, and
all other exercises of learning."[497]

[Sidenote: Revolution of discipline.]

[Sidenote: Memorable fate of Duns Scotus.]

The discipline was not neglected: "we have enjoined the religious students,"[498] Leyton wrote
to Cromwell, "that none of them, for no manner of cause, shall come within any tavern, inn,
or alehouse, or any other house, whatsoever it be, within the town and suburbs. [Each offender]
once so taken, to be sent home to his cloyster. Without doubt, this act is greatly lamented
of all honest women of the town; and especially of their laundresses, that may not now once
enter within the gates, much less within the chambers, whereunto they were right well accustomed.
I doubt not, but for this thing, only the honest matrons will sue to you for redress."[499]
These were sharp measures; we lose our breath at their rapidity and violence. The saddest vicissitude
was that which befell the famous Duns--Duns Scotus, the greatest of the Schoolmen, the constructor
of the memoria technica of ignorance, the ancient text-book of à priori knowledge, established
for centuries the supreme despot in the Oxford lecture-rooms. "We have set Duns in Bocardo,"
says Leyton. He was thrown down from his high estate, and from being lord of the Oxford intellect,
was "made the common servant of all men;" condemned by official sentence to the lowest degradation
to which book can be submitted.[500] Some copies escaped this worst fate; but for changed uses
thenceforward. The second occasion on which the visitors came to New College, they "found the
great Quadrant Court full of the leaves of Duns, the wind blowing them into every corner; and
one Mr. Greenfield, a gentleman of Buckinghamshire, gathering up part of the same book leaves,
as he said, to make him sewers or blawnsheres, to keep the deer within his wood, thereby to
have the better cry with his hounds."[501]

To such base uses all things return at last; dust unto dust, when the life has died out of
them, and the living world needs their companionship no longer.

[Sidenote: Progress of the visitors.]

[Sidenote: Uniformity of result.]

[Sidenote: The animus improbus.]

On leaving Oxford, the visitors spread over England, north, south, east, and west. We trace
Legh in rapid progress through Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincoln, Yorkshire, and Northumberland;
Leyton through Middlesex, Kent, Sussex, Hants, Somersetshire, and Devon. They appeared at monastery
after monastery, with prompt, decisive questions; and if the truth was concealed, with expedients
for discovering it, in which practice soon made them skilful. All but everywhere the result
was the same. At intervals a light breaks through, and symptoms appear of some efforts after
decency; but in the vast majority of the smaller houses, the previous results were repeated,
the popular suspicions were more than confirmed. Wolsey, when writing to the pope of his intended
reformation, had spoken of the animus improbus, and the frightful symptoms which existed of
it. He was accused, in his attempted impeachment, of having defamed the character of the English
clergy. Yet Wolsey had written no more than the truth, as was too plainly discovered. I do
not know what to say on this matter, or what to leave unsaid. If I am to relate the suppression
of the monasteries, I should relate also why they were suppressed. If I were to tell the truth,
I should have first to warn all modest eyes to close the book, and read no further. It will
perhaps be sufficient if I introduce a few superficial stories, suggestive rather than illustrative
of the dark matter which remains in the shade.

[Sidenote: Sion Monastery.]

[Sidenote: The confessional, and the fruits of it.]

I have spoken more than once of the monastery of Sion. It was the scene of the Nun of Kent's
intrigues. It furnished more than one martyr for the Catholic cause; and the order was Carthusian--one
of the strictest in England. There were two houses attached to the same establishment--one
of monks, another of nuns. The confessors of the women were chosen from the friars, and they
were found to have abused their opportunities in the most infamous manner. With a hateful mixture
of sensuality and superstition, the offence and the absolution went hand-in-hand. One of these
confessors, so zealous for the pope that he professed himself ready to die for the Roman cause,
was in the habit of using language so filthy to his penitents, that it was necessary to "sequester
him from hearing ladies' confessions." The nuns petitioned the visitors, on the exposure of
the seduction of a sister, that he and his companion might come to them no more; and the friar
was told that his abominable conduct might be the occasion that "shrift should be laid down
in England."[502]

This is one instance of an evil found fatally prevalent.

[Sidenote: Forged licenses for profligacy.]

Again, the clergy were suspected of obtaining dispensations from their superiors indulging
in a breach of their vows. The laxity of the church courts in dealing with clerical delinquents
had perhaps given rise to this belief; but the accusation was confirmed by a discovery at Maiden
Bradley, in Wiltshire. The prior of this house had a family of illegitimate children, whom
he brought up and provided for in a very comfortable manner;[503] and the visitor wrote that
"the pope, considering his fragility," had granted him a licence in this little matter; that
he had, in fact, "a good writing sub plumbo, to discharge his conscience." I do not easily
believe that authentic dispensations of such a kind were obtained from Rome, or were obtainable
from it; but of forged dispensations, invented by reverend offenders or fraudulently issued
by the local ecclesiastical authorities, to keep appearances smooth, there were probably enough,
and too many.[504]

[Sidenote: Visit to Langden Abbey, Oct. 22.]

The more ordinary experiences of the commissioners may be described by Leyton himself, in an
account which he wrote of his visit to Langden Abbey, near Dover. The style is graphic, and
the picture of the scene one of the most complete which remains. The letter is to Cromwell.

"Please it your goodness to understand that on Friday, the 22nd of October, I rode back with
speed to take an inventory of Folkstone, and from thence I went to Langden. Whereat immediately
descending from my horse, I sent Bartlett, your servant, with all my servants, to circumspect
the abbey, and surely to keep all back-doors and starting-holes. I myself went alone to the
abbot's lodging, joining upon the fields and wood, even like a cony clapper, full of starting-holes.
[I was] a good space knocking at the abbot's door; nec vox nec sensus apparuit, saving the
abbot's little dog that within his door fast locked bayed and barked. I found a short poleaxe
standing behind the door, and with it I dashed the abbot's door in pieces, ictu oculi, and
set one of my men to keep that door; and about the house I go, with that poleaxe in my hand,
ne forte, for the abbot is a dangerous desperate knave, and a hardy. But for a conclusion,
his gentlewoman bestirred her stumps towards her starting-holes; and then Bartlett, watching
the pursuit, took the tender damoisel; and, after I had examined her, [brought her] to Dover
to the mayor, to set her in some cage or prison for eight days; and I brought holy father abbot
to Canterbury, and here in Christchurch I will leave him in prison. In this sudden doing ex
tempore, to circumspect the house, and to search, your servant John Antony's men marvelled
what fellow I was, and so did the rest of the abbey, for I was unknown there of all men. I
found her apparel in the abbot's coffer. To tell you all this comedy (but for the abbot a tragedy),
it were too long. Now it shall appear to gentlemen of this country, and other the commons,
that ye shall not deprive or visit, but upon substantial grounds. The rest of all this knavery
I shall defer till my coming unto you, which shall be with as much speed as I can possible."[505]

[Sidenote: October. Nunnery of Lichfield.]

[Sidenote: Two of the sisterhood found "not barren."]

Towards the close of the year, Leyton went north to join Legh; and together they visited a
nunnery at Lichfield. The religious orders were bound by oaths similar to those which have
recently created difficulty in Oxford. They were sworn to divulge nothing which might prejudice
the interests of the houses. The superior at Lichfield availed herself of this plea. When questioned
as to the state of the convent, she and the sisterhood refused to allow that there was any
disorder, or any irregularity, which could give occasion for inquiry. Her assertions were not
implicitly credited; the inspection proceeded, and at length two of the sisters were discovered
to be "not barren"; a priest in one instance having been the occasion of the misfortune, and
a serving-man in the other. No confession could be obtained either from the offenders themselves,
or from the society. The secret was betrayed by an "old beldame"; "and when," says Leyton,
"I objected against the prioresses, that if they could not show me a cause reasonable of their
concealment, I must needs, and would, punish them for their manifest perjury,--their answer
was, that they were bound by their religion never to confess the secret faults done amongst
them, but only to a visitor of their own religion, and to that they were sworn, every one of
them, on their first admission."[506]

[Sidenote: Abbey of Fountains.]

[Sidenote: Theft and sacrilege committed by the abbot.]

A little later the commissioners were at Fountains Abbey; and tourists, who in their daydreams
among those fair ruins are inclined to complain of the sacrilege which wasted the houses of
prayer, may study with advantage the following account of that house in the year which preceded
its dissolution. The outward beautiful ruin was but the symbol and consequence of a moral ruin
not so beautiful. "The Abbot of Fountains," we read in a joint letter of Legh and Leyton, had
"greatly dilapidated his house, [and] wasted the woods, notoriously keeping six women. [He
is] defamed here," they say, "a toto populo, one day denying these articles, with many more,
the next day confessing the same, thus manifestly incurring perjury." Six days before the visitors'
access to his monastery "he committed theft and sacrilege, confessing the same. At midnight
he caused his chaplain to seize the sexton's keys, and took out a jewel, a cross of gold with
stones. One Warren, a goldsmith in the Chepe, was with him in his chamber at that hour, and
there they stole out a great emerald, with a ruby. The said Warren made the abbot believe the
ruby to be but a garnet, so that for this he paid nothing. For the emerald he paid but twenty
pounds. He sold him also the plate without weight or ounces; how much the abbot was deceived
therein he cannot tell, for he is a very fool and miserable idiot."[507]

[Sidenote: The visitors instructed to make inventories of the property, and to bring away the
superfluous plate.]

[Sidenote: False returns made by the abbots.]

Under an impression that frauds of this description were becoming frequent, the government
had instructed the commissioners to take inventories of the plate and jewels; and where they
saw occasion for suspicion, to bring away whatever seemed superfluous, after leaving a supply
sufficient for the services of the house and chapel. The misdemeanour of the Abbot of Fountains
was not the only justification of these directions. Sometimes the plate was secreted. The Prior
of Christ Church, Canterbury, was accused of having sent in a false return,[508] keeping back
gold and precious stones valued at a thousand pounds. Information was given by some of the
brethren, who professed to fear that the prior would poison them in revenge.

[Sidenote: Scene at Norton Abbey in Cheshire.]

Occasionally the monks ventured on rougher methods to defend themselves. Here is a small spark
of English life while the investigation was in progress, lighted by a stray letter from an
English gentleman of Cheshire. The lord chancellor was informed by Sir Piers Dutton, justice
of the peace, that the visitors had been at Norton Abbey. They had concluded their inspection,
had packed up such jewels and plate as they purposed to remove, and were going away; when,
the day being late and the weather foul, they changed their minds, and resolved to spend the
night where they were. In the evening, "the abbot," says Sir Piers, "gathered together a great
company, to the number of two or three hundred persons, so that the commissioners were in fear
of their lives, and were fain to take a tower there; and therefrom sent a letter unto me, ascertaining
me what danger they were in, and desiring me to come and assist them, or they were never likely
to come thence. Which letter came to me about nine of the clock, and about two o'clock on the
same night I came thither with such of my tenants as I had near about me, and found divers
fires made, as well within the gates as without; and the said abbot had caused an ox to be
killed, with other victuals, and prepared for such of his company as he had there. I used some
policy, and came suddenly upon them. Some of them took to the pools and water, and it was so
dark that I could not find them. Howbeit I took the abbot and three of his canons, and brought
them to the king's castle of Hatton."[509]

[Sidenote: Monks under 24, and nuns under 21, set free from their vows.]

If, however, the appropriation of the jewels led to occasional resistance, another duty which
the commissioners were to discharge secured them as often a warm and eager welcome. It was
believed that the monastic institutions had furnished an opportunity, in many quarters, for
the disposal of inconvenient members of families. Children of both sexes, it was thought, had
been forced into abbeys and convents at an age too young to have allowed them a free choice
in the sacrifice of their lives. To all such, therefore, the doors of their prison house were
thrown open. On the day of visitation, when the brethren, or the sisterhood, were assembled,
the visitors informed everywhere such monks as were under twenty-four, and such nuns as were
under twenty-one, that they might go where they pleased. To those among them who preferred
to return to the world, a secular dress was given, and forty shillings in money, and they were
restored to the full privileges of the laity.

[Sidenote: The monks at Fordham petition for release.]

The opportunity so justly offered was passionately embraced. It was attended only with this
misfortune, that the line was arbitrarily drawn, and many poor wretches who found themselves
condemned by the accident of a few more days or months of life to perpetual imprisonment, made
piteous entreaties for an extension of the terms of freedom. At Fordham, in Cambridgeshire,
Dr. Legh wrote to Cromwell, "the religious persons kneeling on their knees, instantly with
humble petition desire of God and the king and you, to be dismissed from their religion, saying
they live in it contrary to God's law and their consciences; trusting that the king, of his
gracious goodness, and you, will set them at liberty out of their bondage, which they are not
able to endure, but should fall into desperation, or else run away." "It were a deed of charity,"
he continued, fresh from the scene where he had witnessed the full misery of their condition,
"that they might live in that kind of living which might be most to the glory of God, the quietness
of their consciences, and most to the commonwealth, whosoever hath informed you to the contrary."[510]
Similar expressions of sympathy are frequent in the visitors' letters. Sometimes the poor monks
sued directly to the vicar-general, and Cromwell must have received many petitions as strange,
as helpless, and as graphic, as this which follows. The writer was a certain Brother Beerley,
a Benedictine monk of Pershore, in Worcestershire. It is amusing to find him addressing the
vicar-general as his "most reverend lord in God." I preserve the spelling, which, however,
will with some difficulty be found intelligible.

[Sidenote: Letter of a monk of Pershore to Cromwell.]

"We do nothing seyrch," says this good brother, "for the doctryn of Chryst, but all fowloys

whych doth move mee to go owt of the relygyon, an yt were never so perfytt, whych no man may

In reply to these and similar evidences of the state of the monasteries, it will be easy to
say, that in the best ages there were monks impatient of their vows, and abbots negligent of
their duties; that human weakness and human wickedness may throw a stain over the noblest institutions;
that nothing is proved by collecting instances which may be merely exceptions, and that no
evidence is more fallacious than that which rests upon isolated facts.

It is true; and the difficulty is felt as keenly by the accuser who brings forward charges
which it is discreditable to have urged, if they cannot be substantiated, as by those who would
avail themselves of the easy opening to evade the weight of the indictment. I have to say only,
that if the extracts which I have made lead persons disposed to differ with me to examine the
documents which are extant upon the subject, they will learn what I have concealed as well
as what I have alleged; and I believe that, if they begin the inquiry (as I began it myself)
with believing that the religious orders had been over-hardly judged, they will close it with
but one desire--that the subject shall never more be mentioned.

[Sidenote: New regulations enforced by the commissioners.]

Leaving, then, the moral condition in which the visitors found these houses, we will now turn
to the regulations which they were directed to enforce for the future. When the investigation
at each of the houses had been completed, when the young monks and nuns had been dismissed,
the accounts audited, the property examined, and the necessary inquiries had been made into
the manners and habits of the establishment, the remaining fraternity were then assembled in
the chapter-house, and the commissioners delivered to them their closing directions. No differences
were made between the orders. The same language was used everywhere. The statute of supremacy
was first touched upon; and the injunction was repeated for the detailed observance of it.
Certain broad rules of moral obedience were then laid down, to which all "religious" men without
exception were expected to submit.[512]

[Sidenote: The monks confined within walls.]

No monks, thenceforward, were to leave the precincts of the monastery to which they belonged,
under any pretext; they were to confine themselves within the walls, to the house, the gardens,
and the grounds.

[Sidenote: No women to be admitted within the precincts.]

[Sidenote: The brethren to dine together in hall, gravely and decently.]

No women were to come within the walls, without licence from the king or the visitor; and,
to prevent all unpermitted ingress or egress, private doors and posterns were to be walled
up. There was, in future, to be but one entrance only, by the great foregate; and this was
to be diligently watched by a porter. The "brethren" were to take their meals decently in the
common hall. They were not to clamour, as they had been in the habit of doing, "for any certain,
usual, or accustomed portion of meat;" but were to be content with what was set before them,
giving thanks to God.

To ensure gravity and decency, one of the brethren, at every refection, was to read aloud a
chapter of the Old or New Testament.

The abbot was "to keep an honest and hospitable table;" and an almoner was to be appointed
in each house, to collect the broken meats, and to distribute them among the deserving poor.

[Sidenote: Valiant, mighty, and idle beggars no longer to be supported.]

Special care was to be taken in this last article, and "by no means should such alms be given
to valiant, mighty, and idle beggars and vagabonds, such as commonly use to resort to such
places; which rather as drove beasts and mychers should be driven away and compelled to labour,
than in their idleness and lewdness be cherished and maintained, to the great hindrance and
damage of the commonweal."

All other alms and distributions, either prescribed by the statutes of the foundations, or
established by the customs of the abbeys, were to be made and given as largely as at any past time.

The abbots were to make no waste of the woods or lands. They were to keep their accounts with
an annual audit, faithfully and truly.

No fairs nor markets were any more to be held within the precincts.[513]

Every monk was to have a separate bed, and not to have any child or boy lying with him, or
otherwise haunting unto him.

The "brethren" were to occupy themselves in daily reading or other honest and laudable exercises.
Especially there was to be every day one general lesson in Holy Scripture, at which every member
of the house was bound to be present.

[Sidenote: Some portion of the rule which the monks have professed shall every day be read
to them.]

Finally, that they might all understand the meaning of their position in the world, and the
intention, which they had so miserably forgotten, of the foundations to which they belonged,
the abbot, prior, or president, was every day to explain in English some of the portion of
the rule which they had professed; "applying the same always to the doctrine of Christ." The
language of the injunctions is either Cromwell's or the king's; and the passage upon this subject
is exceedingly beautiful.

"The abbot shall teach them that the said rule, and other their principles of religion (so
far as they be laudable), be taken out of Holy Scripture: and he shall shew them the places
from whence they be derived: and that their ceremonies and other observances be none other
things than as the first letters or principles, and certain introductions to true Christianity:
and that true religion is not contained in apparel, manner of going, shaven heads, and such
other marks; nor in silence, fasting, uprising in the night, singing, and such other kind of
ceremonies; but in cleanness of mind, pureness of living, Christ's faith not feigned, and brotherly
charity, and true honouring of God in spirit and verity: and that those abovesaid things were
instituted and begun, that they being first exercised in these, in process of time might ascend
to those as by certain steps--that is to say, to the chief point and end of religion. And therefore,
let them be exhorted that they do not continually stick and surcease in such ceremonies and
observances, as though they had perfectly fulfilled the chief and outmost of the whole of true
religion; but that when they have once passed such things, they should endeavour themselves
after higher things, and convert their minds from such external matters to more inward and
deeper considerations, as the law of God and Christian religion doth teach and shew: and that
they assure not themselves of any reward or commodity by reason of such ceremonies and observances,
except they refer all such to Christ, and for his sake observe them."[514]

Certainly, no government which intended to make the irregularities of an institution an excuse
for destroying it, ever laboured more assiduously to defeat its own objects. Those who most
warmly disapprove of the treatment of the monasteries have so far no reason to complain; and
except in the one point of the papal supremacy, under which, be it remembered, the religious
orders had luxuriated in corruption, Becket or Hildebrand would scarcely have done less or
more than what had as yet been attempted by Henry.

[Sidenote: 1536. Parliament meets for its last session.]

[Sidenote: February. Preliminary measures.]

[Sidenote: The commissioners present their report.]

But the time had now arrived when the results of the investigation were to be submitted to
the nation. The parliament--the same old parliament of 1529, which had commenced the struggle
with the bishops--was now meeting for its last session, to deal with this its greatest and
concluding difficulty. It assembled on the 4th of February, and the preliminaries of the great
question being not yet completed, the Houses were first occupied with simplifying justice and
abolishing the obsolete privileges of the Northern palatinates.[515] Other minor matters were
also disposed of. Certain questionable people, who were taking advantage of the confusion of
the times to "withhold tythes," were animadverted upon.[516] The treason law was further extended
to comprehend the forging of the king's sign-manual, signet, and privy seal, "divers light
and evil-disposed persons having of late had the courage to commit such offences." The scale
of fees at the courts of law was fixed by statute;[517] and felons having protection of sanctuary
were no longer to be permitted to leave the precincts, and return at their pleasure. When they
went abroad, they were to wear badges, declaring who and what they were; and they were to be
within bounds after sunset. In these and similar regulations the early weeks of the session
were consumed. At length the visitors had finished their work, and the famous Black Book of
the monasteries was laid on the table of the House of Commons.

This book, I have said, unhappily no longer exists. Persons however who read it have left on
record emphatic descriptions of its contents; and the preamble of the act of parliament of
which it formed the foundation, dwells upon its character with much distinctness. I cannot
discuss the insoluble question whether the stories which it contained were true. History is
ill occupied with discussing probabilities on à priori grounds, when the scale of likelihood
is graduated by antecedent prejudice. It is enough that the report was drawn up by men who
had the means of knowing the truth, and who were apparently under no temptation to misrepresent
what they had seen; that the description coincides with the authentic letters of the visitors;
and that the account was generally accepted as true by the English parliament.

[Sidenote: Two thirds of the monks are living in habits which may not be described.]

It appeared, then, on this authority, that two-thirds of the monks in England were living in
habits which may not be described. The facts were related in great detail. The confessions
of parties implicated were produced, signed by their own hands.[518] The vows were not observed.
The lands were wasted, sold, and mortgaged. The foundations were incomplete. The houses were
falling to waste; within and without, the monastic system was in ruins. In the smaller abbeys
especially, where, from the limitation of numbers, the members were able to connive securely
at each other's misdemeanours, they were saturated with profligacy, with Simony, with drunkenness.[519]
The case against the monasteries was complete; and there is no occasion either to be surprised
or peculiarly horrified at the discovery. The demoralization which was exposed was nothing
less and nothing more than the condition into which men of average nature compelled to celibacy,
and living as the exponents of a system which they disbelieved, were certain to fall.

[Sidenote: A great debate in the House.]

There were exceptions. In the great monasteries, or in many of them, there was decency and
honourable management; but when all the establishments, large and small, had been examined,
a third only could claim to be exempted from the darkest schedule. This was the burden of the
report which was submitted to the legislature. So long as the extent of the evil was unknown,
it could be tolerated; when it had been exposed to the world, honour and justice alike required
a stronger remedy than an archiepiscopal remonstrance. A "great debate" followed.[520] The
journals of the session are lost, and we cannot replace the various arguments; but there was
not a member of either House who was not connected, either by personal interest, or by sacred
associations, with one or other of the religious houses; there was not one whose own experience
could not test in some degree the accuracy of the Black Book; and there was no disposition
to trifle with institutions which were the cherished dependencies of the great English families.

[Sidenote: March. Difficulty of arriving at a resolution.]

[Sidenote: Conflicting interests. The representatives of the founders.]

[Sidenote: Divided opinion of the Reformers.]

[Sidenote: Latimer, and Knox after him, desired to preserve and reform.]

[Sidenote: Crammer opposed to ecclesiastical corporations under any form.]

[Sidenote: Cranmer more right than Latimer, as experience has proved.]

[Sidenote: The instincts of the laity guide them truly.]

The instincts of conservatism, association, sympathy, respect for ancient bequests, and a sense
of the sacredness of property set apart for holy uses, and guarded by anathemas, all must have
been against a dissolution; yet, so far as we can supply the loss of the journals from other
accounts of the feeling of the time, there seems to have been neither hope nor desire of preserving
the old system--of preserving the houses, that is, collectively under their existing statutes
as foundations in themselves inviolate. The visitation had been commenced with a hope that
extremities might still be avoided. But all expectation of this kind vanished before the fatal
evidence which had been produced. The House of Commons had for a century and a half been familiar
with the thought of suppression as a possible necessity. The time was come when, if not suppression,
yet some analogous measure had become imperative. The smaller establishments, at least, could
not and might not continue. Yet while, so far, there was general agreement, it was no easy
matter to resolve upon a satisfactory remedy. The representatives of the founders considered
that, if houses were suppressed which had been established out of estates which had belonged
to their forefathers, those estates should revert to the heirs, or at least, that the heirs
should recover them upon moderate terms.[521] In the Reforming party there was difference of
opinion on the legality of secularizing property which had been given to God. Latimer, and
partially Cromwell, inherited the designs of Wolsey; instead of taking away from the church
the lands of the abbeys, they were desirous of seeing those lands transferred to the high and
true interests of religion. They wished to convert the houses into places of education, and
to reform, wherever possible, the ecclesiastical bodies themselves.[522] This, too, was the
dream, the "devout imagination," as it was called, of Knox, in Scotland, as it has been since
the dream of many other good men who have not rightly understood why the moment at which the
church was washed clean from its stains, and came out fresh robed in the wedding-garment of
purity, should have been chosen to strip it of its resources, and depose it from power and
preëminence. Cranmer, on the other hand, less imaginative but more practical, was reluctant
that clerical corporations should be continued under any pretext--even under the mild form
of cathedral chapters. Cranmer desired to see the secular system of the church made as efficient
as possible; the religious system, in its technical sense, he believed to have become a nursery
of idleness, and believed that no measures of reform could restore the old tone to institutions
which the world had outgrown.[523] In the present age it will perhaps be considered that Cranmer's
sagacity was more right than Latimer's enthusiasm, however at the moment men's warmer instincts
might seem to have pleaded for the latter. The subsequent history both of the Scotch and English
church permits the belief that neither would have been benefited by the possession of larger
wealth than was left to them. A purer doctrine has not corrected those careless and questionable
habits in the management of property which were exposed by the visitors of 1535. Whether the
cause of the phenomenon lies in an indifference to the things of the world, or in the more
dubious palliation that successive incumbents have only a life-interest in their incomes, the
experience of three centuries has proved the singular unfitness of spiritual persons for the
administration of secular trusts; and the friends of the establishment may be grateful that
the judgment of the English laity ultimately guided them to this conclusion. They were influenced,
it is likely, by a principle which they showed rather in their deeds than in their words. They
would not recognise any longer the distinction on which the claims of the abbeys were rested.
Property given to God, it was urged, might not be again taken from God, but must remain for
ever in his service. It was replied in substance that God's service was not divided, but one;
that all duties honestly done were religious duties; that the person of the layman was as sacred
as the person of the priest; and the liturgy of obedience as acceptable as the liturgy of words.

[Sidenote: Necessity of caution.]

[Sidenote: Aversion of English statesmen to sweeping measures.]

Yet if, in the end, men found their way clearly, they moved towards it with slow steps; and
the first resolution at which they arrived embodied partially the schemes of each of the honest
reformers. In touching institutions with which the feelings of the nation were deeply connected,
prudence and principle alike dictated caution. However bitterly the people might exclaim against
the abbeys while they continued to stand, their faults, if they were destroyed, would soon
be forgotten. Institutions which had been rooted in the country for so many centuries, retained
a hold too deep to be torn away without wounding a thousand associations; and a reaction of
regret would inevitably follow among men so conservative as the English, so possessed with
reverence for the old traditions of their fathers. This was to be considered; or rather the
parliament, the crown, and the council felt as the people felt. Vast as the changes were which
had been effected, there had been as yet no sweeping measures. At each successive step, Henry
had never moved without reluctance. He hated anarchy; he hated change: in the true spirit of
an Englishman, he never surrendered an institution or a doctrine till every means had been
exhausted of retaining it, consistently with allegiance to truth. The larger monasteries, therefore,
with many of the rest, had yet four years allowed them to demonstrate the hopelessness of their
amendment, the impossibility of their renovation. The remainder were to reap the consequences
of their iniquities; and the judicial sentence was pronounced at last in a spirit as rational
as ever animated the English legislature.

[Sidenote: Act for the Dissolution of the smaller houses. Forasmuch as religious persons in
the little abbeys are living in manifest sin,]

[Sidenote: To the displeasure of God and the great infamy of the realm;]

[Sidenote: And forasmuch as reformation is seen to be hopeless,]

[Sidenote: It is believed that God will be better pleased to see the possessions of such houses,
now wasted in evil living, applied to better purpose.]

"Forasmuch," says the preamble of the Act of Dissolution, "as manifest sin, vicious, carnal,
and abominable living, is daily used and committed among the little and small abbeys, priories,
and other religious houses of monks, canons, and nuns, where the congregation or such religious
persons is under the number of twelve, whereby the governors of such religious houses and their
convents, spoil, consume, destroy, and utterly waste their churches, monasteries, principal
houses, farms, and granges, to the high displeasure pleasure of Almighty God, the slander of
true religion, and to the great infamy of the King's Highness and of the realm, if redress
should not be had thereof; and albeit that many continual visitations hath been heretofore
had by the space of two hundred years and more, for an honest and charitable reformation of
such unthrifty, carnal, and abominable living; yet nevertheless, little or none amendment is
hitherto had, but their vicious living shamelessly increaseth and augmenteth, and by a cursed
custom is so rooted and infested, that a great multitude of the religious persons in such small
houses do rather choose to rove abroad in apostacy than to conform them to the observation
of true religion; so that without such small houses be utterly suppressed, and the religious
persons therein committed to great and honourable monasteries of religion in this realm, where
they may be compelled to live religiously for the reformation of their lives, there can be
no reformation in this behalf: in consideration hereof the King's most royal Majesty, being
supreme head on earth, under God, of the Church of England, daily finding and devising the
increase, advancement, and exaltation, of true doctrine and virtue in the said Church, to the
only glory of God, and the total extirping and destruction of vice and sin; having knowledge
that the premises be true, as well by accounts of his late visitation as by sundry credible
informations; considering also that divers great monasteries of this realm, wherein, thanks
be to God, religion is right well kept and observed, be destitute of such full number of religious
persons as they ought and may keep; hath thought good that a plain declaration should be made
of the premises, as well to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal as to other his loving subjects
the Commons in this present parliament assembled. Whereupon, the said Lords and Commons, by
a great deliberation, finally be resolved that it is and shall be much more to the pleasure
of Almighty God, and for the honour of this His realm, that the possessions of such spiritual
houses, now spent, and spoiled, and wasted for increase and maintenance of sin, should be converted
to better uses; and the unthrifty religious persons so spending the same be compelled to reform
their lives."[524]

[Sidenote: The lands of all having less than 200l. a-year to be given to the king. The monks
either to be distributed among the larger houses, or to be pensioned off, to live honestly abroad.]

[Sidenote: The few houses reputed clear may be reëstablished by the Crown.]

The parliament went on to declare, that the lands of all monasteries the incomes of which were
less than two hundred pounds a-year, should be "given to the king."[525] The monks were either
to be distributed in the great abbeys, "or to be dismissed with a permission," if they desired
it, "to live honestly and virtuously abroad." "Some convenient charity" was to be allowed them
for their living; and the chief head or governor was to have "such pension as should be commensurate
with his degree or quality."[526] All debts, whether of the houses or of the brothers individually,
were to be carefully paid; and finally, one more clause was added, sufficient in itself to
show the temper in which the suppression had been resolved upon. The visitors had reported
a few of the smaller abbeys as free from stain. The king was empowered, at his discretion,
to permit them to survive; and under this permission thirty-two houses were refounded in perpetuam
eleemosynam.[527]

This is the history of the first suppression of the monasteries under Henry VIII. We regret
the depravity by which it was occasioned; but the measure itself, in the absence of any preferable
alternative, was bravely and wisely resolved. In the general imperfection of human things,
no measure affecting the interests of large bodies of men was ever yet devised which has not
pressed unequally, and is not in some respects open to objection. We can but choose the best
among many doubtful courses, when we would be gladly spared, if we might be spared, from choosing
at all.

[Sidenote: The laity only see their way clearly.]

[Sidenote: Unwisdom of the Protestant bishops.]

In this great transaction, it is well to observe that the laity alone saw their way clearly.
The majority of the bishops, writhing under the inhibitions, looked on in sullen acquiescence,
submitting in a forced conformity, and believing, not without cause, that a tide which flowed
so hotly would before long turn and ebb back again. Among the Reforming clergy there was neither
union nor prudence; and the Protestants, in the sudden sunshine, were becoming unmanageable
and extravagant. On the bench there were but four prelates who were on the moving side,--Cranmer,
Latimer, Shaxton, and Barlow,[528]--and among these Cranmer only approved the policy of the
government. Shaxton was an arrogant braggart, and Barlow a feeble enthusiast. Shaxton, who
had flinched from the stake when Bilney was burnt, Shaxton, who subsequently relapsed under
Mary, and became himself a Romanist persecutor, was now strutting in his new authority, and
punishing, suspending, and inhibiting in behalf of Protestant doctrines which were not yet
tolerated by the law.[529] Barlow had been openly preaching that purgatory was a delusion;
that a layman might be a bishop; that where two or three, it might be, "cobblers or weavers,"
"were in company in the name of God, there was the church of God."[530] Such ill-judged precipitancy
was of darker omen to the Reformation than papal excommunications or imperial menaces, and
would soon be dearly paid for in fresh martyr-fires. Latimer, too, notwithstanding his clear
perception and gallant heart, looked with bitterness on the confiscation of establishments
which his mind had pictured to him as garrisoned with a Reforming army, as nurseries of apostles
of the truth. Like most fiery-natured men, he was ill-pleased to see the stream flowing in
a channel other than that which he had marked for it; and the state of his feeling, and the
state of the English world, with all its confused imaginings, in these months, is described
with some distinctness in a letter written by a London curate to the Mayor of Plymouth, on
the 13th of March, 1535-36, while the bill for the suppression of the abbeys was in progress
through parliament.

[Sidenote: Letter of a London curate to the Mayor of Plymouth.]

[Sidenote: Vision of the Trinity by Dr. Crewkhorne.]

"Right Worshipful,--On the morrow after that Master Hawkins departed from hence, I, having
nothing to do, as an idler went to Lambeth to the bishop's palace, to see what news; and I
took a wherry at Paul's Wharf, wherein also was already a doctor named Crewkhorne, which was
sent for to come to the Bishop of Canterbury. And he, before the three Bishops of Canterbury,
Worcester, and Salisbury, confessed that he was rapt into heaven, where he saw the Trinity
sitting in a pall or mantle or cope of blew colour; and from the middle upward they were three
bodies, and from the middle downward were they closed all three into one body. And he spake
with Our Lady, and she took him by the hand, and bade him serve her as he had done in time
past; and bade him preach abroad that she would be honoured at Ipswich and Willesdon as she
hath been in old times.

[Sidenote: March 13.]

"On Tuesday in Ember week, the Bishop of Rochester[531] came to Crutched Friars, and inhibited
a doctor and three or four more to near confession; and so in Cardmaker and other places. Then
the Bishop of London's apparitor came and railed on the other bishops, and said that he, nor
no such as he, shall have jurisdiction within his Lord's precincts. Then was the Bishop of
London sent for to make answer; but he was sick and might not come. On Friday, the clergy sat
on it in Convocation House a long time, and left off till another day; and in the meantime,
all men that have taken loss or wrong at his hands, must bring in their bills, and shall have
recompence.

[Sidenote: Latimer preaches at Paul's Cross, and is disrespectful to persons in authority.]

"On Sunday last, the Bishop of Worcester preached at Paul's Cross, and he said that bishops,
abbots, priors, parsons, canons, resident priests, and all, were strong thieves; yea, dukes,
lords, and all. Bishops, abbots, with such others, should not have so many servants, nor so
many dishes; but to go to their first foundation; and keep hospitality to feed the needy people--not
jolly fellows, with golden chains and velvet gowns; ne let these not once come into houses
of religion for repast. Let them call knave bishop, knave abbot, knave prior, yet feed none
of them all, nor their horses, nor their dogs. Also, to eat flesh and white meat in Lent, so
it be done without hurting weak consciences, and without sedition; and likewise on Fridays
and all days.

[Sidenote: What Cranmer will do with the unpreaching friars.]

"The Bishop of Canterbury saith that the King's Grace is at full point for friars and chauntry
priests, that they shall away all, saving them that can preach. Then one said to the bishop,
that they had good trust that they should serve forth their life-times; and he said they should
serve it out at a cart, then, for any other service they should have by that."

The concluding paragraph of this letter is of still greater interest. It refers to the famous
Vagrant Act, of which I have spoken in the first chapter of this work.[532]

[Sidenote: The Vagrant Act the first fruits of the suppression.]

"On Saturday in the Ember week, the King's Grace came in among the burgesses of the parliament,
and delivered them a bill, and bade them look upon it, and weigh it in conscience; for he would
not, he said, have them pass either it or any other thing because his Grace giveth in the bill;
but they to see if it be for the commonweal of his subjects, and have an eye thitherwards;
and on Wednesday next he will be there again to hear their minds. There shall be a proviso
made for the poor people. The gaols shall be rid; the faulty shall die; and the others shall
be rid by proclamation or by jury, and shall be set at liberty, and pay no fees. Sturdy beggars
and such prisoners as cannot be set at work, shall be set at work at the king's charge; some
at Dover, and some at places where the water hath broken over the lands. Then, if they fall
to idleness, the idler shall be had before a justice of the peace, and his fault written. If
he be taken idle again in another place, he shall be known where his dwelling is; and so at
the second mention he shall be burned in the hand; and if he fail the third time, he shall
die for it."[533]

[Sidenote: The penal clauses of this statute.]

The king, as it appeared, had now the means at his disposal to find work for the unemployed;
and the lands bequeathed for the benefit of the poor were reapplied, under altered forms, to
their real intention. The antithesis which we sometimes hear between the charity of the monasteries--which
relieved poverty for the love of God--and the worldly harshness of a poor-law, will not endure
inspection. The monasteries, which had been the support of "valiant beggary," had long before
transferred to the nation the maintenance of the impotent and the deserving; and the resumption
of an abused trust was no more than the natural consequence of their dishonesty. I have already
discussed[534] the penal clauses of this act, and I need not enter again upon that much-questioned
subject. Never, however, at any period, were the labouring classes in England more generously
protected than in the reign of Henry VIII.; never did any government strain the power of legislation
more resolutely in their favour; and, I suppose, they would not themselves object to the reënactment
of Henry's penalties against dishonesty, if they might have with them the shelter of Henry's laws.

[Sidenote: Payment of firstfruits remitted to the Universities.]

The session was drawing to an end. At the close of it, the government gave one more proof of
their goodwill toward any portion of the church establishment which showed signs of being alive.
Duns Scotus being disposed of in Bocardo, the idle residents being driven away, or compelled
to employ themselves, and the professors' lectures having recovered their energy, there were
hopes of good from Oxford and Cambridge; and the king conceded for them what the pope had never
conceded, when the power rested with the See of Rome: he remitted formally by statute the tenths
and firstfruits, which the colleges had paid in common with all other church corporations.
"His Majesty is conscious," says the act which was passed on this occasion,[535] that the enforcing
of the payment of firstfruits against the universities, "may prejudice learning, and cause
the students to give their minds to other things, which might not be acceptable to God;" and
"he has conceived such hearty love and tender affection to the continuance of honest and virtuous
living, and of the arts and sciences (wherewith it hath pleased Almighty God abundantly to
endow his Highness), as that his Grace cannot compare the same to any law, constitution, or
statute; nor tolerate any such ordinance, though the commodity and benefit thereof should never
so much redound to his own profit or pleasure, if it may hinder the advancement and setting
forth of the lively word of God, wherewith his people must be fed; or if it may imperil the
knowledge of such other good letters as in Christian realms is expedient to be learned. He
has therefore,--(for that the students should the more gladly bend their wits to the attaining
of learning, and, before all things, the learning of the wholesome doctrines of Almighty God,
and the three tongues, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, which be requisite for the understanding of
Scripture,)--thought it convenient" to exonerate the universities from the payment of firstfruits
for ever.

[Sidenote: April 4. Dissolution of the parliament, and summary of its labours.]

So closed the first great parliament of the Reformation, which was now dissolved. The Lower
House is known to us only as an abstraction. The debates are lost; and the details of its proceedings
are visible only in faint transient gleams. We have an epitome of two sessions in the Lords'
Journals; but even this partial assistance fails us with the Commons; and the Lords in this
matter were a body of secondary moment. The Lords had ceased to be the leaders of the English
people; they existed as an ornament rather than a power; and under the direction of the council
they followed as the stream drew them, when individually, if they had so dared, they would
have chosen a far other course. The work was done by the Commons; by them the first move was
made; by them and the king the campaign was carried through to victory. And this one body of
men, dim as they now seem to us, who assembled on the wreck of the administration of Wolsey,
had commenced and had concluded a revolution which had reversed the foundations of the State.
They found England in dependency upon a foreign power; they left it a free nation. They found
it under the despotism of a church establishment saturated with disease; and they had bound
the hands of that establishment; they had laid it down under the knife, and carved away its
putrid members; and stripping off its Nessus robe of splendour and power, they had awakened
in it some forced remembrance of its higher calling. The elements of a far deeper change were
seething; a change, not in the disposition of outward authority, but in the beliefs and convictions
which touched the life of the soul. This was yet to come; and the work so far was but the initial
step or prelude leading up to the more solemn struggle. Yet where the enemy who is to be conquered
is strong, not in vital force, but in the prestige of authority, and in the enchanted defences
of superstition, those truly win the battle who strike the first blow, who deprive the idol
of its terrors by daring to defy it.

CHAPTER XI

TRIAL AND DEATH OF ANNE BOLEYN.

The first act of the great drama appeared to have closed. No further changes were for the present
in contemplation. The church was reëstablished under its altered constitution; and the parliament
had been dissolved under the impression that it would be unnecessary to summon another for
an indefinite time.[536] Within four weeks of the dissolution, writs were issued for a fresh
election, under the pressure of a misfortune which is alike calamitous, under whatever aspect
we regard it; and which blotted the Reformation with a black and frightful stain. The guilt
must rest where it is due; but under any hypothesis, guilt there was, dark, mysterious, and
most miserable.

[Sidenote: Death of Queen Catherine.]

[Sidenote: January 7. Her last letter to Henry.]

The fate of Queen Catherine had by this time completed itself. She had taken her leave of a
world which she had small cause to thank for the entertainment which it had provided for her;
and she died, as she had lived, resolute, haughty, and unbending. In the preceding October
(1535) she was in bad health; her house, she imagined, disagreed with her, and at her own desire
she was removed to Kimbolton. But there were no symptoms of immediate danger. She revived under
the change, and was in better spirits than she had shown for many previous months, especially
after she heard of the new pope's resolution to maintain her cause. "Much resort of people
came daily to her."[537] The vexatious dispute upon her title had been dropped, from an inability
to press it; and it seemed as if life had become at least endurable to her, if it never could
be more. But the repose was but the stillness of evening as night is hastening down. The royal
officers of the household were not admitted into her presence; the queen lived wholly among
her own friends and her own people; she sank unperceived; and so effectually had she withdrawn
from the observation of those whom she desired to exclude, that the king was left to learn
from the Spanish ambassador that she was at the point of death, before her chamberlain was
aware that she was more than indisposed.[538] In the last week of December Henry learnt that
she was in danger. On the 2d of January the ambassador went down from London to Kimbolton,
and spent the day with her.[539] On the 5th, Sir Edmund Bedingfield wrote that she was very
ill, and that the issue was doubtful. On the morning of the 7th she received the last sacrament,
and at two o'clock on that day she died.[540] On her deathbed she dictated the following letter
of farewell to him whom she still called, her most dear lord and husband.

"The hour of my death now approaching, I cannot choose but, out of the love I bear you, advise
you of your soul's health, which you ought to prefer before all considerations of the world
or flesh whatsoever; for which yet you have cast me into many calamities, and yourself into
many troubles. But I forgive you all, and pray God to do so likewise. For the rest I commend
unto you Mary our daughter, beseeching you to be a good father to her, as I have heretofore
desired. I must entreat you also to respect my maids, and give them in marriage, which is not
much, they being but three; and to all my other servants a year's pay besides their due, lest
otherwise they should be unprovided for. Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes desire you
above all things. Farewell."[541]

This letter reached Henry with the intimation that she was gone. He was much affected, and
is said to have shed tears.[542]

[Sidenote: She is buried at Peterborough, and the See of Peterborough is founded as a memorial
of her.]

The court was ordered into mourning--a command which Anne Boleyn distinguished herself by imperfectly
obeying.[543] Catherine was buried at Peterborough, with the estate of Princess Royal;[544]
and shortly after, on the foundation of the new bishoprics, the See of Peterborough was established
in her memory. We may welcome, however late, these acts of tardy respect.[545] Henry, in the
few last years, had grown wiser in the ways of women; and had learnt to prize more deeply the
austerity of virtue, even in its unloveliest aspect.

[Sidenote: Fall of Anne Boleyn.]

The death of Catherine was followed, four months later, by the tragedy which I have now to
relate. The ground on which I am about to tread is so critical, and the issues at stake affect
so deeply the honour of many of our most eminent English statesmen, that I must be pardoned
if I cannot here step boldly out with a flowing narrative, but must pick my way slowly as I
can: and I, on my part, must ask my readers to move slowly also, and be content to allow their
judgment, for a few pages, to remain in suspense.

And first, I have to say that, as with all the great events of Henry's reign, so especially
with this, we must trust to no evidence which is not strictly contemporary. During periods
of revolution, years do the work of centuries in colouring actions and disturbing forms; and
events are transferred swiftly from the deliberation of the judgment to the precipitate arrogance
of party spirit. When the great powers of Europe were united against Elizabeth, and when Elizabeth's
own character was vilely and wantonly assailed, the Catholic writers dipped their pens in the
stains which blotted her mother's name; and, more careless of truth than even theological passion
can excuse, they poured out over both alike a stream of indiscriminate calumny. On the other
hand, as Elizabeth's lordly nature was the pride of all true-hearted Englishmen, so the Reformers
laboured to reflect her virtues backwards. Like the Catholics, they linked the daughter with
the parent; and became no less extravagant in their panegyrics than their antagonists in their
gratuitous invective. But the Anne Boleyn, as she appears in contemporary letters, is not the
Anne Boleyn of Foxe, or Wyatt, or the other champions of Protestantism, who saw in her the
counterpart of her child. These writers, though living so near to the events which they described,
yet were divided from the preceding generation by an impassable gulf. They were surrounded
with the heat and flame of a controversy, in which public and private questions were wrapped
inseparably together; and the more closely we scrutinize their narratives, the graver occasion
there appears for doing so.

[Sidenote: Rules to be observed in judging this question.]

While, therefore, in following out this miserable subject, I decline so much as to entertain
the stories of Sanders, who has represented Queen Anne as steeped in profligacy from her childhood,
so I may not any more accept those late memorials of her saintliness, which are alike unsupported
by the evidence of those who knew her. If Protestant legends are admitted as of authority,
the Catholic legends must enter with them, and we shall only deepen the confusion. I cannot
follow Burnet, in reporting out of Meteren a version of Anne Boleyn's trial, unknown in England.
The subject is one on which rhetoric and rumour are alike unprofitable. We must confine ourselves
to accounts written at the time by persons to whom not the outline of the facts only was known,
but the circumstances which surrounded them; by persons who had seen the evidence upon the
alleged offences, which, though now lost irrecoverably, can be proved to have once existed.

[Sidenote: Difficulty of ascertaining Anne Boleyn's early character.]

We are unable, as I early observed, to form any trustworthy judgment of Anne Boleyn before
her marriage. Her education had been in the worst school in Europe. On her return from the
French court to England, we have seen her entangled in an unintelligible connexion with Lord
Percy; and if the account sent to the Emperor was true, she was Lord Percy's actual wife; and
her conduct was so criminal as to make any after-charges against her credible.[546]

If the Protestants, again, found in her a friend and supporter, she was capable, as Wolsey
experienced, of inveterate hatred; and although among the Reformers she had a reputation for
generosity, which is widely confirmed,[547] yet it was exercised always in the direction in
which her interests pointed; and kindness of feeling is not incompatible, happily, with seriously
melancholy faults.

[Sidenote: Cranmer's evidence in her favour.]

[Sidenote: Early coolness between her and Henry.]

The strongest general evidence in her favour is that of Cranmer, who must have known her intimately,
and who, at the crisis of her life, declared that he "never had better opinion in woman than
he had in her."[548] Yet there had been circumstances in her conduct, as by her own after confessions
was amply evident, which justified Sir Thomas More in foretelling a stormy end to her splendour;[549]
and her relations with the king, whether the fault rested with him, or rested with her, grew
rapidly cool when she was his wife. In 1534, perhaps sooner, both she herself, her brother,
and her relations had made themselves odious by their insolence; her over-bearing manners had
caused a decline in the king's affection for her; and on one side it was reported that he was
likely to return to Catherine,[550] on the other that he had transferred his attention to some
other lady, and that the court encouraged his inconstancy to separate him from Anne's influence.[551]
D'Inteville confirms the account of a new love affair, particularising nothing, but saying
merely that Anne was falling out of favour; and that the person alluded to as taking her place
was Jane Seymour, appears from a letter written after Anne's execution, by the Regent Mary
to the Emperor of Austria, and from the letter written (supposing it genuine) by Anne herself
to the king before her trial.[552]

On the other hand, it is equally clear that whether provoked or not by infidelity on the part
of Henry, her own conduct had been singularly questionable. We know very little, but waiving
for the present the exposures at her trial, we know, by her own confession, that arrogance
and vanity had not been her only faults, and that she had permitted the gentlemen who were
the supposed partners of her guilt, to speak to her of their passion for herself.[553]

In January, 1535, Henry's mind had been filled with "doubts and strange suspicions" about his
wife. There had been a misunderstanding, in which she had implored the intercession of Francis
I.[554]

[Sidenote: The probable cause of that coolness.]

[Sidenote: The antecedent probabilities amount to nothing.]

In February, 1536, she miscarried, with a dead boy, which later rumour dwelt on as the cause
of Henry's displeasure. But conversations such as those which she described with her supposed
paramours, lay bare far deeper wounds of domestic unhappiness; and assure us, that if we could
look behind the scenes, we should see there estrangements, quarrels, jealousies, the thousand
dreary incidents that, if we knew them, would break the suddenness with which at present the
catastrophe bursts upon us. It is the want of preparation, the blank ignorance in which we
are left of the daily life and daily occurrences of the court, which places us at such disadvantage
for recovering the truth. We are unable to form any estimate whatever of those antecedent likelihoods
which, in the events of our own ordinary lives, guide our judgment so imperceptibly, yet so
surely. Henry is said to have been inconstant, but those who most suspected Henry's motives
charge Anne at the same time with a long notorious profligacy.[555] We cannot say what is probable
or what is improbable; except, indeed, that the guilt or every person is improbable antecedent
to evidence; and in the present instance, since, either on the side of the queen or of the
king, there was and must have been most terrible guilt, these opposite presumptions neutralize
each other.

[Sidenote: Thursday, April 27; arrest of Sir William Brereton; and on Sunday, April 30, of
Mark Smeton.]

[Sidenote: May 1. Tournament at Greenwich.]

[Sidenote: The king goes to London.]

To proceed with the story. Towards the middle of April, 1536, certain members of the privy
council were engaged secretly in receiving evidence which implicated the queen in adultery.
Nothing is known of the quarter from which the information came which led to the inquiry.[556]
Something, however, there was to call for inquiry, or something there was thought to be; and
on the 24th of April the case was considered sufficiently complete to make necessary a public
trial. On that day an order was issued for a special commission. The members of the tribunal
were selected with a care proportioned to the solemnity of the occasion.[557] It was composed
of the lord chancellor, the first noblemen of the realm, and of the judges. The investigation
had, however, been conducted so far with profound secrecy; and the object for which it was
to assemble was unknown even to Cranmer, himself a member of the privy council.[558] With the
same mysterious silence on the cause of so unexpected a measure, the writs were issued for
a general election, and parliament was required to assemble as soon as possible.[559] On Thursday,
the 27th, the first arrest was made. Sir William Brereton,[560] a gentleman of the king's household,
was sent suddenly to the Tower; and on the Sunday after, Mark Smeton, of whom we know only
that he was a musician high in favour at the court, apparently a spoilt favourite of royal
bounty.[561] The day following was the 1st of May. It was the day on which the annual festival
was held at Greenwich, and the queen appeared, as usual, with her husband and the court at
the tournament. Lord Rochfort, the queen's brother, and Sir Henry Norris, both of them implicated
in the fatal charge, were defender and challenger. The tilting had commenced, when the king
rose suddenly with signs of disturbance in his manner, left the court, and rode off with a
small company to London. Rumour, which delights in dramatic explanations of great occurrences,
has discovered that a handkerchief dropped by the queen, and caught by Norris, roused Henry's
jealousy; and that his after conduct was the result of a momentary anger. The incidents of
the preceding week are a sufficient reply to this romantic story. The mine was already laid,
the match was ready for the fire.

[Sidenote: Tuesday, May 2; arrest of the queen. The privy council sit at Greenwich.]

[Sidenote: She declares her innocence.]

[Sidenote: Norris, Weston, and Smeton examined.]

The king did not return: he passed the night in London, and Anne remained at Greenwich. On
the morning of Tuesday the privy council assembled in the palace under the presidency of the
Duke of Norfolk, and she was summoned to appear before it. The Duke of Norfolk, her uncle,
was anxious, as Burnet insinuates, on political grounds that his niece should be made away
with. Such accusations are easily brought, especially when unsupported by evidence. She was
unpopular from her manner. The London merchants looked on her with no favour as having caused
a breach in the alliance with Flanders, and the duke was an imperialist and at heart a friend
of Queen Catherine; but he had grown old in the service of the state with an unblemished reputation;
and he felt too keenly the disgrace which Anne's conduct had brought upon her family, to have
contrived a scheme for her removal at once so awkward and so ignominious.[562] On her examination,
she declared herself innocent; the details of what passed are unknown; only she told Sir William
Kingston that she was cruelly handled at Greenwich with the king's council; "and that the Duke
of Norfolk, in answer to her defence, had said, 'Tut, tut, tut,' shaking his head three or
four times."[563] The other prisoners were then examined; not Brereton, it would seem, but
Smeton, who must have been brought down from the Tower, and Sir Henry Norris, and Sir Francis
Weston, two young courtiers, who had both of them been the trusted friends of the king. Each
day the shadow was stretching further. The worst was yet to come.

[Sidenote: May 2. Tuesday. Smeton confesses, and Norris, who afterwards, however, withdraws
from what he has said.]

On being first questioned, these three made general admissions, but denied resolutely that
any actual offence had been committed. On being pressed further and cross-examined, Smeton
confessed to actual adultery.[564] Norris hesitated: being pressed, however, by Sir William
Fitzwilliam to speak the truth, he also made a similar acknowledgment, although he afterwards
withdrew from what he had said.[565] Weston persisted in declaring himself innocent. The result
was unsatisfactory, and it was thought that it would "much touch the king's honour" if the
guilt of the accused was not proved more clearly. "Only Mark," Sir Edward Baynton said, would
confess "of any actual thing"[566]; although he had no doubt "the other two" were "as fully
culpable as ever was he." They were, however, for the present, recommitted to the Tower; whither
also in the afternoon the council conducted the queen, and left her in the custody of Sir William
Kingston.

[Sidenote: The queen, in the afternoon, is taken to the Tower.]

[Sidenote: She protests her innocence, and begs to have the sacrament in her closet.]

She was brought up the river; the same river along which she sailed in splendour only three
short years before. She landed at the same Tower Stairs; and, as it to complete the bitter
misery of the change, she was taken "to her own lodgings in which she lay at her coronation."
She had feared that she was to go to a dungeon. When Kingston told her that these rooms had
been prepared for her, "It is too good for me," she said, "Jesu have mercy on me;" "and kneeled
down, weeping a great space; and in the same sorrow fell into a great laughing."[567] She then
begged that she might have the sacrament in the closet by her chamber, that she might pray
for mercy, declaring "that she was free from the company of man as for sin," and was "the king's
true wedded wife."

She was aware that the other prisoners were in the Tower, or, at least, that Smeton, Weston,
and Norris were there. Whether she knew at that time of the further dreadful accusation which
was hanging over her, does not appear; but she asked anxiously for her brother; and, if she
had suspected anything, her fears must have been confirmed by Kingston's evasive replies. It
is so painful to dwell upon the words and actions of a poor woman in her moments of misery,
that Kingston may describe his conversation with her in his own words. Lord Rochfort had returned
to London at liberty; he seems to have been arrested the same Tuesday afternoon. "I pray you,"
she said, "to tell me where my Lord Rochfort is?"--"I told her," Kingston wrote, that "I saw
him afore dinner, in the court." "Oh, where is my sweet brother?" she went on. "I said I left
him at York-place;" and so I did. "I hear say," said she, "that I should be accused with three
men; and I can say no more but nay, without I should open my body,"--and therewith she opened
her gown, saying, "Oh, Norris, hast thou accused me? Thou art in the Tower with me, and thou
and I shall die together. And, Mark, thou art here too. Oh, my mother, thou wilt die for sorrow."
And much she lamented my Lady of Worcester, for because her child did not stir in her body.
And my wife said, "What should be the cause?" She said, "For the sorrow she took for me." And
then she said, "Mr. Kingston, shall I die without justice?" And I said, "The poorest subject
the king hath, had justice;" and therewith she laughed.[568]

[Sidenote: Lady Boleyn and three other ladies sent to attend upon her.]

Lady Boleyn, her aunt, had been sent for, with a Mrs. Cousins, and two other ladies, selected
by the king.[569] They were ordered to attend upon the queen, but to observe a strict silence;
and to hold no communication with her, except in the presence of Lady Kingston. This regulation,
it was found, could not be insisted on. Lady Boleyn and Mrs. Cousins slept in the queen's room,
and conversation could not be prevented. Mrs. Cousins undertook, on her part, to inform Kingston
if anything was said which "it was meet that he should know."[570]

[Sidenote: Wednesday, May 3. Reported conversation of the queen with Norris,]

[Sidenote: And with Sir Francis Weston.]

In compliance with this promise, she told him, the next morning, that the queen had been speaking
to her about Norris. On the preceding Sunday, she said that Norris had offered to "swear for
the queen, that she was a good woman."--"But how," asked Mrs. Cousins, very naturally, "how
came any such things to be spoken of at all?"--"Marry," the queen said, "I bade him do so:
for I asked him why he went not through with his marriage; and he made answer, that he would
tarry a time. Then, I said, You look for dead men's shoes; for if aught came to the king but
good, you would look to have me.[571] And he said, if he should have any such thought, he would
his head were off. And then she said she could undo him, if she would. And therewith they fell
out." "But she said she more feared Weston; for on Whitsun Tuesday last, Weston told her that
Norris came more unto her chamber for her than for Mage."[572] Afterwards, "The queen spake
of Weston, that she had spoken to him, because he did love her kinswoman, Mrs. Skelton, and
that she said he loved not his wife; and he made answer to her again, that he loved one in
her house better than them both. She asked him who is that? to which he answered, that it is
yourself. 'And then,' she said, 'she defied him.'"[573]

So passed Wednesday at the Tower. Let us feel our very utmost commiseration for this unhappy
woman; if she was guilty, it is the more reason that we should pity her; but I am obliged to
say, that conversations of this kind, admitted by herself, disentitle her to plead her character
in answer to the charges against her. Young men do not speak of love to young and beautiful
married women, still less to ladies of so high rank, unless something more than levity has
encouraged them; and although to have permitted such language is no proof of guilt, yet it
is a proof of the absence of innocence.

[Sidenote: The news reaches Cranmer. He is ordered to Lambeth till he hears further.]

Meanwhile, on the Tuesday morning, a rumour of the queen's arrest was rife in London; and the
news for the first time reached the ears of Cranmer. The archbishop was absent from home, but
in the course of the day he received an order, through Cromwell, to repair to his palace, and
remain there till he heard further. With what thoughts he obeyed this command may be gathered
from the letter which, on the following morning, he wrote to Henry. The fortunes of the Reformation
had been so closely linked to those of the queen, that he trembled for the consequences to
the church of the king's too just indignation. If the barren womb of Catherine had seemed a
judgment against the first marriage, the shameful issue of the second might be regarded too
probably as a witness against that and against every act which had been connected with it.
Full of these forebodings, yet not too wholly occupied with them to forget the unhappy queen,
he addressed the king, early on Wednesday, in the following language:--

[Sidenote: He writes to the king. He implores Henry to bear his misfortune like a man,]

[Sidenote: And to accept submissively the trial which God has sent upon him.]

"Please it your most noble Grace to be advertised, that at your Grace's commandment, by Mr.
Secretary's letter, written in your Grace's name, I came to Lambeth yesterday, and there I
do remain to know your Grace's further pleasure. And forasmuch as without your Grace's commandment,
I dare not, contrary to the contents of the said letter, presume to come unto your Grace's
presence; nevertheless, of my most bounden duty, I can do no less than most humbly to desire
your Grace, by your great wisdom, and by the assistance of God's help, somewhat to suppress
the deep sorrows of your Grace's heart, and to take all adversities of God's hands both patiently
and thankfully. I cannot deny but your Grace hath good cause many ways of lamentable heaviness;
and also, that in the wrongful estimation of the world, your Grace's honour of every part is
so highly touched (whether the things that commonly be spoken of be true or not), that I remember
not that ever Almighty God sent unto your Grace any like occasion to try your Grace's constancy
throughout, whether your Highness can be content to take of God's hands as well things displeasant
as pleasant. And if He find in your most noble heart such an obedience unto his will, that
your Grace, without murmuration and over-much heaviness, do accept all adversities, not less
thanking Him than when all things succeed after your Grace's will and pleasure, then I suppose
your Grace did never thing more acceptable unto Him since your first governance of this your
realm. And moreover, your Grace shall give unto Him occasion to multiply and increase his graces
and benefits unto your Highness, as He did unto his most faithful servant Job; unto whom, after
his great calamities and heaviness, for his obedient heart and willing acceptation of God's
scourge and rod, addidit Dominus cuncta duplicia. And if it be true that is openly reported
of the Queen's Grace, if men had a right estimation of things, they should not esteem any part
of your Grace's honour to be touched thereby; but her honour to be clean disparaged. And I
am in such perplexity, that my mind is clean amazed; for I never had better opinion in woman
than I had in her; which maketh me to think that she should not be culpable. And again, I think
your Highness would not have gone so far, except she had been surely culpable.

[Sidenote: Of the queen's guilt, he knows not what to believe.]

[Sidenote: He will pray that she may be found innocent.]

[Sidenote: But if she be guilty, let her be punished with all extremity, for the dishonour
which she has brought upon the gospel.]

[Sidenote: He trusts that the king will still continue to favour the gospel, however, as before.]

"Now I think that your Grace best knoweth that, next unto your Grace, I was most bound unto
her of all creatures living. Wherefore, I most humbly beseech your Grace to suffer me in that
which both God's law, nature, and also her kindness bindeth me unto: that is, that I may with
your Grace's favour wish and pray for her that she may declare herself inculpable and innocent.
And if she be found culpable, considering your Grace's goodness to her, and from what condition
your Grace of your only mere goodness took her, and set the crown upon her head, I repute him
not your Grace's faithful servant and subject, nor true unto the realm, that would not desire
the offence without mercy to be punished, to the example of all other. And as I loved her not
a little for the love which I judged her to bear towards God and his gospel; so if she be proved
culpable, there is not one that loveth God and his gospel that will ever favour her, but must
hate her above all other; and the more they favour the gospel, the more they will hate her;
for there never was creature in our time that so much slandered the gospel. And God hath sent
her this punishment for that she feignedly hath professed his gospel in her mouth, and not
in heart and deed. And though she hath offended so that she hath deserved never to be reconciled
to your Grace's favour, yet Almighty God hath manifoldly declared his goodness towards your
Grace, and never offended you. But your Grace, I am sure, acknowledgeth that you have offended
Him. Wherefore, I trust that your Grace will bear no less entire favour unto the truth of the
gospel than you did before; forasmuch as your Grace's favour to the gospel was not led by affection
unto her, but by zeal unto the truth. And thus I beseech Almighty God, whose gospel he hath
ordained your Grace to be defender of, ever to preserve your Grace from all evil, and give
you at the end the promise of his gospel. From Lambeth, the third of May."

[Sidenote: He is sent for to the Star Chamber.]

[Sidenote: The postscript of his letter.]

The letter was written; it was not, however, sent upon the instant; and in the course of the
morning the archbishop was requested to meet the Lord Chancellor, Lord Oxford, Lord Sussex,
and the Lord Chamberlain, in the Star Chamber. He went, and on his return to Lambeth he added
a few words in a postscript. In the interview from which he had at the moment returned, those
noblemen, he said, had declared unto him such things as his Grace's pleasure was they should
make him privy unto; for the which he was most bounden unto his Grace. "What communications
we had together," he added, "I doubt not but they will make the true report thereof unto your
Grace. I am exceedingly sorry that such faults can be proved by the queen, as I heard of their
relation."[574]

If we may believe, as I suppose we may, that Cranmer was a man of sound understanding, and
of not less than ordinary probity, this letter is of the greatest value; it shows the impression
which was made upon a sensible person by the first rumours of the discovery; it shows also
the archbishop's opinion of the king's character, with the effect upon his own mind of the
evidence which the chancellor, at the king's command, had laid before him.

[Sidenote: Friday, May 5. Henry writes to the queen with a promise of pardon if she will confess.]

[Sidenote: She persists in maintaining her innocence,]

[Sidenote: Being satisfied that there was no witness of her guilt.]

We return to the prisoners in the Tower. Mark Smeton, who had confessed his guilt, was ironed.[575]
The other gentlemen, not in consideration of their silence, but of their rank, were treated
more leniently. To the queen, with an object which may be variously interpreted, Henry wrote
the Friday succeeding her arrest, holding out hopes of forgiveness if she would be honest and
open with him. Persons who assume that the whole transaction was the scheme of a wicked husband
to dispose of a wife of whom he was weary, will believe that he was practising upon her terror
to obtain his freedom by a lighter crime than murder. Those who consider that he possessed
the ordinary qualities of humanity, and that he was really convinced of her guilt, may explain
his offer as the result of natural feeling. But in whatever motive his conduct originated,
it was ineffectual. Anne, either knowing that she was innocent, or trusting that her guilt
could not be proved, trusting, as Sir Edmund Baynton thought, to the constancy of Weston and
Norris,[576] declined to confess anything. "If any man accuse me," she said to Kingston, "I
can but say nay, and they can bring no witness."[577] Instead of acknowledging any guilt in
herself, she perhaps retaliated upon the king in the celebrated letter which has been thought
a proof both of her own innocence, and of the conspiracy by which she was destroyed.[578] This
letter also, although at once so well known and of so dubious authority, it is fair to give entire.

[Sidenote: Saturday, May 6. Her letter to the king.]

"Sir,--Your Grace's displeasure and my imprisonment are things so strange unto me, as what
to write, or what to excuse, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas you send unto me (willing [me]
to confess a truth, and to obtain your favour) by such an one whom you know to be mine antient
professed enemy, I no sooner conceived this message by him, than I rightly conceived your meaning;
and if, as you say, confessing a truth indeed may procure my safety, I shall with all willingness
and duty perform your command.

[Sidenote: Never prince had more loyal wife.]

[Sidenote: She, however, always looked for what now she finds.]

"But let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge
a fault where not so much as a thought thereof proceeded. And to speak a truth, never prince
had wife more loyal in all duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne
Boleyn; with which name and place I could willingly have contented myself, if God and your
Grace's pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time so far forget myself in my
exaltation or received queenship, but that I always looked for such an alteration as now I
find: for the ground of my preferment being on no surer foundation than your Grace's fancy,
the least alteration I knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other subject.
You have chosen me from a low estate to be your queen and companion, far beyond my desert or
desire. If then you found me worthy of such honour, good your Grace, let not any light fancy
or bad counsel of mine enemies withdraw your princely favour from me; neither let that stain,
that unworthy stain, of a disloyal heart towards your good Grace, ever cast so foul a blot
on your most dutiful wife, and the infant princess, your daughter.

[Sidenote: She begs for a fair trial,]

[Sidenote: And if she is condemned, Henry may lawfully follow his new fancy.]

"Try me, good king, but let me have a lawful trial; and let not my sworn enemies sit as my
accusers and my judges; yea, let me receive an open trial, for my truth shall fear no open
shame. Then shall you see either mine innocency cleared, your suspicions and conscience satisfied,
the ignominy and slander of the world stopped, or my guilt openly declared; so that, whatsoever
God or you may determine of me, your Grace may be freed from an open censure; and mine offence
being so lawfully proved, your Grace is at liberty, both before God and man, not only to execute
worthy punishment on me, as an unlawful wife, but to follow your affection already settled
on that party for whose sake I am now as I am, whose name I could some good while since have
pointed unto; your Grace not being ignorant of my suspicion therein.

[Sidenote: If her fate is already decided, she prays God will pardon his great sin,]

"But if you have already determined of me; and that not only my death, but an infamous slander,
must bring you the enjoying of your desired happiness; then I desire of God that he will pardon
your great sin therein, and likewise my enemies the instruments thereof; and that He will not
call you to a strict account for your unprincely and cruel usage of me, at his general judgment-seat,
where both you and myself must shortly appear; and in whose judgment, I doubt not, whatsoever
the world may think of me, mine innocence shall be openly known and sufficiently cleared.

[Sidenote: And also that her own death may suffice, and the poor gentlemen be spared.]

"My last and only request shall be, that myself may only bear the burden of your Grace's displeasure,
and that it may not touch the innocent souls of those poor gentlemen who, as I understand,
are likewise in strait imprisonment for my sake. If ever I have found favour in your sight,
if ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleasing in your ears, then let me obtain this request;
and I will so leave to trouble your Grace any further; with mine earnest prayers to the Trinity,
to have your Grace in his good keeping, and to direct you in all your actions. From my doleful
prison in the Tower, this 6th of May. Your most loyal and ever faithful wife,

  ANNE BOLEYN."[579]

       *       *       *       *       *

[Sidenote: A second requisition to confess from the king, and a second refusal.]

[Sidenote: The tone of the queen's answers not what it ought to have been, even on her own
showing.]

This letter is most affecting; and although it is better calculated to plead the queen's cause
with posterity than with the king, whom it could only exasperate, yet if it is genuine it tells
(so far as such a composition can tell at all) powerfully in her favour. On the same page of
the manuscript, carrying the same authority, and subject to the same doubt, is a fragment of
another letter, supposed to have been written subsequently, and therefore in answer to a second
invitation to confess. In this she replied again, that she could confess no more than she had
already spoken; that she might conceal nothing from the king, to whom she did acknowledge herself
so much bound for so many favours; for raising her first from a mean woman to be a marchioness;
next to be his queen; and now, seeing he could bestow no further honours upon her on earth,
for purposing by martyrdom to make her a saint in heaven.[580] This answer also was unwise
in point of worldly prudence; and I am obliged showing to add, that the tone which was assumed,
both in this and in her first letter, was unbecoming (even if she was innocent of actual sin)
in a wife who, on her own showing, was so gravely to blame. It is to be remembered that she
had betrayed from the first the king's confidence; and, as she knew at the moment at which
she was writing, she had never been legally married to him.

[Sidenote: Her wild words in the Tower.]

Her spirits meanwhile had something rallied, though still violently fluctuating. "One hour,"
wrote Kingston,[581] "she is determined to die, and the next hour much contrary to that." Sometimes
she talked in a wild, wandering way, wondering whether any one made the prisoners' beds, with
other of those light trifles which women's minds dwell upon so strangely, when strained beyond
their strength. "There would be no rain," she said, "till she was out of the Tower; and if
she died, they would see the greatest punishment for her that ever came to England." "And then,"
she added, "I shall be a saint in heaven, for I have done many good deeds in my days; but I
think it much unkindness in the king to put such about me as I never loved."[582] Kingston
was a hard chronicler, too convinced of the queen's guilt to feel compassion for her; and yet
these rambling fancies are as touching as Ophelia's; and, unlike hers, are no creation of a
poet's imagination, but words once truly uttered by a poor human being in her hour of agony.
Yet they proved nothing. And if her wanderings seem to breathe of innocence, they are yet compatible
with the absence of it. We must remind ourselves that two of the prisoners had already confessed
both their own guilt and hers.

[Sidenote: Preparations for the trial. Necessity of entering into offensive details.]

The queen demanded a trial; it was not necessary to ask for it. Both she and her supposed accomplices
were tried with a scrupulousness without a parallel, so far as I am aware, in the criminal
records of the time. The substance of the proceedings is preserved in an official summary;[583]
and distressing as it is to read of such sad matters, the importance of arriving at a fair
judgment must excuse the details which will be entered into. The crime was alike hideous, whether
it was the crime of the queen or of Henry; we may not attempt to hide from ourselves the full
deformity of it.

On the 24th of April, then, a special commission was appointed, to try certain persons for
offences committed at London, at Hampton Court, and at the palace at Greenwich. The offences
in question having been committed in Middlesex and in Kent, bills were first to be returned
by the grand juries of both counties.

[Sidenote: The names of the commissioners appointed to try the queen's accomplices.]

[Sidenote: The queen and her brother to be tried by the House of Lords.]

Men are apt to pass vaguely over the words "a commission" or "a jury," regarding them rather
as mechanical abstractions than as bodies of responsible men. I shall therefore give the list
of the persons who, in these or any other capacities, were engaged upon the trials. The special
commission consisted of Sir Thomas Audeley, the lord chancellor; the Duke of Norfolk, uncle
of the queen and of Lord Rochfort; the Duke of Suffolk, the king's brother-in-law; the Earl
of Wiltshire, the queen's father; the Earls of Oxford, Westmoreland, and Sussex; Lord Sandys;
Thomas Cromwell; Sir William Fitzwilliam the Lord High Admiral, an old man whose career had
been of the most distinguished brilliancy; Sir William Paulet, lord treasurer, afterwards Marquis
of Winchester; and, finally, the nine judges of the Courts of Westminster, Sir John Fitzjames,
Sir John Baldewyn, Sir Richard Lister, Sir John Porte, Sir John Spelman, Sir Walter Luke, Sir
Anthony Fitzherbert, Sir Thomas Englefield, and Sir William Shelley. The duty of this tribunal
was to try the four commoners accused of adultery with the queen. She herself, with her brother,
would be tried by the House of Lords. Of the seven peers, three were her own nearest connexions;
the remaining commissioners were those who, individually and professionally, might have been
considered competent for the conduct of the cause above all other persons in the realm. Antecedently
to experience, we should not have expected that a commission so constituted would have lent
itself to a conspiracy; and if foul play had been intended, we should have looked to see some
baser instruments selected for so iniquitous a purpose.

[Sidenote: Wednesday, May 10. True bill found by the grand jury of Middlesex.]

In the middle of the second week in May, the grand juries had completed their work. On the
10th, a true bill was found at Westminster, by the oaths of Giles Heron, Esq.; Roger More,
Esq.; Richard Awnsham, Esq.; Thomas Byllyngton, Esq.; Gregory Lovel, Esq.; John Worsop, Esq.;
William Goddard, gentleman; William Blakwall, gentleman; John Wylford, gentleman; William Berd,
gentleman; Henry Hubbylthorne, gentleman; William Huning, gentleman; Robert Walys, gentleman;
John Englond, gentleman; Henry Lodysman, gentleman; and John Averey, gentleman.

[Sidenote: Thursday, May 11. True bill found by the grand jury of Kent.]

On the 11th a true bill was found at Deptford by the oaths of Sir Richard Clement, Sir William
Fynche, Sir Edward Boughton, Anthony St. Leger, Esq.;[584] John Cromer, Esq.; John Fogg, Esq.;
Thomas Wylleford, Esq.; John Norton, Esq.; Humphrey Style, Esq.; Robert Fisher, gentleman;
Thomas Sybbell, gentleman; John Lovelace, gentleman; Walter Harrington, gentleman; Edmund Page,
gentleman; Thomas Fereby, gentleman; and Lionel Ansty, gentleman.

I am thus particular in recording the names of these jurors, before I relate the indictment
which was found by them, because, if that indictment was unjust, it stamps their memory with
eternal infamy; and with the judges, the commissioners, the privy council, the king, with every
living person who was a party, active or passive, to so enormous a calumny, they must be remembered
with shame for ever.

[Sidenote: The indictment.]

The indictment, then, found by the grand jury of Middlesex was to the following effect:[585]

"1. That the Lady Anne, Queen of England, having been the wife of the king for the space of
three years and more, she, the said Lady Anne, contemning the marriage so solemnized between
her and the king, and bearing malice in her heart against the king, and following her frail
and carnal lust, did falsely and traitorously procure, by means of indecent language, gifts,
and other acts therein stated, divers of the king's daily and familiar servants to be her adulterers
and concubines; so that several of the king's servants, by the said queen's most vile provocation
and invitation, became given and inclined to the said queen.

"2. That the queen [on the] 6th of October, 25 Hen. VIII. [1533], at Westminster, by words,
&c., procured and incited one Henry Norris, Esq., one of the gentlemen of the king's privy
chamber, to have illicit intercourse with her; and that the act was committed at Westminster,
12th October, 25 Hen. VIII.

"3. That the queen, 2nd of November, 27 Hen. VIII. [1535], by the means therein stated, procured
and incited George Boleyn, knight, Lord Rochfort, her own natural brother, to have illicit
intercourse with her; and that the act was committed 5th of November in the same year, at Westminster,
against the commands of Almighty God, and all laws human and divine.

"4. That the queen, 3rd December, 25 Hen. VIII.

"5. That the queen, 8th of May, 26 Hen. VIII.

"6. That the queen, 12th of April, 26 Hen. VIII., procured and incited Mark Smeton, Esq., one
of the grometers of the king's chamber, to have illicit intercourse with her; and that the
act was committed at Westminster, 26th April, 26 Henry VIII.

"7. Furthermore, that the said George, Lord Rochfort, Henry Norris, William Brereton, Sir Francis
Weston, and Mark Smeton, being thus inflamed by carnal love of the queen, and having become
very jealous of each other, did, in order to secure her affections, satisfy her inordinate
desires; and that the queen was equally jealous of the Lord Rochfort and other the before-mentioned
traitors; and she would not allow them to show any familiarity with any other woman, without
her exceeding displeasure and indignation; and that on the 27th day of November, 27 Hen. VIII.,
and other days, at Westminster, she gave them gifts and great rewards, to inveigle them to
her will.

"8. Furthermore, that the queen, and other the said traitors, jointly and severally, 31st of
October, 27 Hen. VIII., and at various times before and after, compassed and imagined the king's
death; and that the queen had frequently promised to marry some one of the traitors, whenever
the king should depart this life, affirming she never would love the king in her heart.

"9. Furthermore, that the king, having within a short time before become acquainted with the
before-mentioned crimes, vices, and treasons, had been so grieved that certain harms and dangers
had happened to his royal body."[586]

[Sidenote: The improbability of the queen's guilt and the improbability of a conspiracy against
her increase in the same ratio.]

[Sidenote: There is no room for the hypothesis of mistake.]

[Sidenote: The parallel of Leontes suggested, but not admissible.]

I suppose that persons who have made up their minds conclusively, and are resolved to abide
by the popular verdict of English historians, will turn with disgust from these hideous charges;
seeming, as they do, to overstep all ordinary bounds of credibility. On one side or the other
there was indeed no common guilt. The colours deepen at every step. But it is to be remembered
that if the improbability of crimes so revolting is becoming greater, the opposite improbability
increases with equal strength--that English noblemen and gentlemen could have made themselves
a party to the invention of the story. For invention is unfortunately the only word; would
indeed that any other were admissible! The discovery of the indictment disposes at once of
Burnet's legend, that the queen was condemned on hearsay evidence; or that her guilt was conjectured
from an exaggerated report of foolish conversations. It cuts off all hope, too, of possible
mistake. I have heard the name Leontes mentioned as a parallel to Henry; and if the question
lay only between the king and his wife, we would gladly welcome the alternative. Charity would
persuade us that a husband had been madly blind, sooner far than that a queen had been madly
wicked. But this road for escape is closed. The mistake of Leontes was transparent to every
eye but his own. The charges against Anne Boleyn were presented by two grand juries before
the highest judicial tribunal in the realm. There was nothing vague, nothing conjectural. The
detail was given of acts and conversations stretching over a period of two years and more;
and either there was evidence for these things, or there was none. If there was evidence, it
must have been close, elaborate, and minute; if there was none, these judges, these juries
and noblemen, were the accomplices of the king in a murder perhaps the most revolting which
was ever committed.

[Sidenote: The difficulty in the way of supposing the accusations forged.]

It may be thought that the evidence was pieced together in the secrets of the cabinet; that
the juries found their bills on a case presented to them by the council. This would transfer
the infamy to a higher stage; but if we try to imagine how the council proceeded in such a
business, we shall not find it an easy task. The council, at least, could not have been deceived.
The evidence, whatever it was, must have been examined by them; and though we stretch our belief
in the complacency of statesmen to the furthest limit of credulity, can we believe that Cromwell
would have invented that dark indictment,--Cromwell who was, and who remained till his death,
the dearest friend of Latimer? Or the Duke of Norfolk, the veteran who had won his spurs at
Flodden? Or the Duke of Suffolk and Sir William Fitzwilliam, the Wellington and the Nelson
of the sixteenth century? Scarcely among the picked scoundrels of Newgate could men be found
for such work; and shall we believe it of men like these? It is to me impossible. Yet, if it
was done at all, it was done by those four ministers.

[Sidenote: To what purpose the multiplication of offences, and the number of offenders?]

Even if we could believe that they forged the accusations, yet they would at least limit the
dimensions of them. The most audacious villain will not extend his crimes beyond what he requires
for his object; and if the king desired only to rid himself of his wife, to what purpose the
multiplication of offenders, and the long list of acts or guilt, when a single offence with
the one accomplice who was ready to abide by a confession would have sufficed? The four gentlemen
gratuitously, on this hypothesis, entangled in the indictment, were nobly connected: one of
them, Lord Rochfort, was himself a peer; they had lived, all four, several years at the court,
and were personally known to every member of the council. Are we to suppose that evidence was
invented with no imaginable purpose, for wanton and needless murders?--that the council risked
the success of their scheme, by multiplying charges which only increased difficulty of proof,
and provoked the interference of the powerful relations of the accused?[587]

Such are the difficulties in which, at this early stage of the transaction, we are already
implicated. They will not diminish as we proceed.

[Sidenote: Friday, May 12. The court opens.]

[Sidenote: The four commoners are brought to the bar.]

[Sidenote: A petty jury return a verdict of guilty.]

Friday, the 12th of May, was fixed for the opening of the court. On that day, a petty jury
was returned at Westminster, for the trial of Sir Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, Sir William
Brereton, and Mark Smeton. The commission sat,--the Earl of Wiltshire sitting with them,[588]--and
the four prisoners were brought to the bar. On their arraignment, Mark Smeton, we are told,
pleaded guilty of adultery with the queen; not guilty of the other charges. Norris, Weston,
and Brereton severally pleaded not guilty. Verdict, guilty. The king's sergeant and attorney
pray judgment. Judgment upon Smeton, Norris, Weston, and Brereton as usual in cases of high
treason. This is all which the record contains. The nature of the evidence is not mentioned.
But again there was a jury; and if we have not the evidence which convinced that jury, we have
the evidence that they were, or professed to be, convinced.

[Sidenote: The Duke of Norfolk is named Lord High Steward.]

The queen and her brother were to be tried on the following Monday. Their crime was not adultery
only, but was coloured with the deeper stain of incest. On the Friday, while the other prisoners
were at the bar, "Letters patent were addressed to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, Treasurer and Earl
Marshal of England, setting forth that the Lady Anne, Queen of England, and Sir George Boleyn,
knight, Lord Rochfort, had been indicted of certain capital crimes; and that the king, considering
that justice was a most excellent virtue, and pleasing to the Most Highest; and inasmuch as
the office of High Steward of England, whose presence for the administration of the law in
this case is required, was vacant, the king therefore appointed the said duke Lord High Steward
of England, with full powers to receive the indictments found against Queen Anne and the Lord
Rochfort, and calling them before him, for the purpose of hearing and examining them, and compelling
them to answer thereto." The duke was to collect also "such and so many lords, peers, and magnates
of the kingdom of England, peers of the said Queen Anne and Lord Rochfort, by whom the truth
could be better known; and the truth being known, to give judgment according to the laws and
customs of England, and to give sentence and judgment, and to direct execution, with the other
usual powers."[589] As a certain number only of the peers were summoned, it may be imagined
that some fraud was practised in the selection, and that those only were admitted whose subserviency
could be relied upon. I will therefore give the names as before.

[Sidenote: List of peers summoned to try the queen and her brother.]

The two English Dukes, of Norfolk and Suffolk.[590] The one English Marquis, of Exeter. The
Earls of Arundel, Oxford, Northumberland (the queen's early lover), Westmoreland, Derby, Worcester,
Rutland, Sussex, and Huntingdon all the earls in the peerage except four--those of Shrewsbury,
Essex, Cumberland, and Wiltshire. Why the first three were omitted I do not know. Lord Wiltshire
had already fulfilled his share of the miserable duty; he was not compelled to play the part
of Brutus, and condemn, in person, his two children. The remaining peers were the Lords Audeley,
De la Ware, Montague, Morley, Dacre, Cobham, Maltravers, Powis, Mounteagle, Clinton, Sandys,
Windsor, Wentworth, Burgh, and Mordaunt: twenty-seven in all: men hitherto of unblemished honour--the
noblest blood in the realm.

[Sidenote: Monday, May 15. Account of the trial in the Baga de Secretis.]

These noblemen assembled in the Tower on the 15th of May. The queen was brought before them;
and the record in the Baga de Secretis relates the proceeding as follows:--

"Before the Lord High Steward at the Tower, Anne, Queen of England, comes in the custody of
Sir William Kingston, Constable of the Tower, and is brought to the bar. Being arraigned of
the before-mentioned treasons, she pleads not guilty, and puts herself upon her peers; whereupon
the Duke of Suffolk, Marquis of Exeter, and others the before-mentioned earls and barons, peers
of the said queen, being charged by the said Lord High Steward to say the truth, and afterwards
being examined severally by the Lord High Steward, from the lowest peer to the highest, each
of them severally saith that she is guilty.

[Sidenote: The queen is found guilty, and sentenced to be burned or beheaded at the king's
pleasure.]

"Judgment--that the queen be taken by the said Constable back to the king's prison within the
Tower; and then, as the king shall command, be brought to the green within the said Tower,
and there burned or beheaded, as shall please the king."[591]

In such cold lines is the story of this tragedy unrolling itself to its close. The course which
it followed, however, was less hard in the actual life; and men's hearts, even in those stern
times, could beat with human emotions. The Duke of Norfolk was in tears as he passed sentence.[592]
The Earl of Northumberland "was obliged by a sudden illness to leave the court."[593] The sight
of the woman whom he had once loved, and to whom he was perhaps married, in that dreadful position,
had been more than he could bear; and the remainder of the work of the day went forward without
him.

[Sidenote: Lord Rochfort found guilty also.]

The queen withdrew. Her brother took his place at the bar. Like Anne, he declared himself innocent.
Like Anne, he was found guilty, and sentenced to die.[594]

We can form no estimate of the evidence; for we do not know what it was. We cannot especially
accuse the form of the trial; for it was the form which was always observed. But the fact remains
to us, that these twenty-seven peers, who were not ignorant, as we are, but were fully acquainted
with the grounds of the prosecution, did deliberately, after hearing the queen's defence, pronounce
against her a unanimous verdict. If there was foul play, they had advantages infinitely greater
than any to which we can pretend for detecting it. The Boleyns were unpopular, and Anne herself
was obnoxious to the imperialists and Catholics; but all parties, Catholic and Protestant alike,
united in the sentence.

[Sidenote: The popular interpretation is not credible.]

Looking at the case, then, as it now stands, we have the report for some time current, that
the queen was out of favour, and that the king's affection was turned in another direction,--a
report, be it observed, which had arisen before the catastrophe, and was not, therefore, an
afterthought, or legend; we have also the antecedent improbability, which is very great, that
a lady in the queen's position could have been guilty of the offences with which the indictment
charges her. We have also the improbability, which is great, that the king, now forty-four
years old, who in his earlier years had been distinguished for the absence of those vices in
which contemporary princes indulged themselves, in wanton weariness of a woman for whom he
had revolutionized the kingdom, and quarrelled with half Christendom, suddenly resolved to
murder her; that, instead of resorting to poison, or to the less obtrusive methods of criminality,
he invented, and persuaded his council to assist him in inventing, a series of accusations
which reflected dishonour on himself, and which involved the gratuitous death of five persons
with whom he had no quarrel, who were attached to his court and person. To maintain these accusations,
he would have to overawe into an active participation in his crime, judges, juries, peers,
the dearest relations of those whom he was destroying, and this with no standing army, no prætorians
or janissaries at his back, with no force but the yeomen of the guard, who could be scattered
by a rising of the apprentices. He had gone out of his way, moreover, to call a parliament;
and the summons had been so hasty that no time was left to control the elections; while again
to fail was ruin; and the generation of Englishmen to whom we owe the Reformation were not
so wholly lost to all principles of honour, that Henry could have counted beforehand upon success
in so desperate a scheme with that absolute certainty without which he would scarcely have
risked the experiment. I think that there is some improbability here. Unlikely as it is that
queens should disgrace themselves, history contains unfortunately more than one instance that
it is not impossible. That queens in that very age were capable of profligacy was proved, but
a few years later, by the confessions of Catherine Howard. I believe history will be ransacked
vainly to find a parallel for conduct at once so dastardly, so audacious, and so foolishly
wicked as that which the popular hypothesis attributes to Henry VIII.

[Sidenote: The facts in favour of the queen.]

[Sidenote: The facts against her.]

This is a fair statement of the probabilities; not, I believe, exaggerated on either side.
Turning to the positive facts which are known to us, we have amongst those which make for the
queen her own denial of her guilt; her supposed letter to the king, which wears the complexion
of innocence; the assertions of three out of the five other persons who were accused, up to
the moment of their execution; and the sympathizing story of a Flemish gentleman who believed
her innocent, and who says that many other people in England believed the same. On the other
side, we have the judicial verdict of more than seventy noblemen and gentlemen,[595] no one
of whom had any interest in the deaths of the accused, and some of whom had interests the most
tender in their acquittal; we have the assent of the judges who sat on the commission, and
who passed sentence, after full opportunities of examination, with all the evidence before
their eyes; the partial confession of one of the prisoners, though afterwards withdrawn; and
the complete confession of another, maintained till the end, and not withdrawn upon the scaffold.
Mr. Hallam must pardon me for saying that this is not a matter in which doubt is unpermitted.

[Sidenote: Wednesday, May 17. The execution of the five gentlemen.]

A brief interval only was allowed between the judgment and the final close. On Wednesday, the
17th, the five gentlemen were taken to execution. Smeton was hanged; the others were beheaded.
Smeton and Brereton acknowledged the justice of their sentence. Brereton said that if he had
to die a thousand deaths, he deserved them all; and Brereton was the only one of the five whose
guilt at the time was doubted.[596] Norris died silent; Weston, with a few general lamentations
on the wickedness of his past life. None denied the crime for which they suffered; all but
one were considered by the spectators to have confessed. Rochfort had shown some feeling while
in the Tower. Kingston on one occasion found him weeping bitterly. The day of the trial he
sent a petition to the king, to what effect I do not learn; and on the Tuesday he begged to
see Cromwell, having something on his conscience, as he said, which he wished to tell him.[597]
His desire, however, does not seem to have been complied with; he spoke sorrowfully on the
scaffold of the shame which he had brought upon the gospel, and died with words which appeared
to the spectators, if not a confession, yet something very nearly resembling it, "This said
lord," wrote a spectator to the court at Brussels, "made a good Catholic address to the people.
He said that he had not come there to preach to them, but rather to serve as a mirror and an
example. He acknowledged the crimes which he had committed against God, and against the king
his sovereign; there was no occasion for him, he said, to repeat the cause for which he was
condemned; they would have little pleasure in hearing him tell it. He prayed God, and he prayed
the king, to pardon his offences; and all others whom he might have injured he also prayed
to forgive him as heartily as he forgave every one. He bade his hearers avoid the vanities
of the world, and the flatteries of the court which had brought him to the shameful end which
had overtaken him. Had he obeyed the lessons of that gospel which he had so often read, he
said he should not have fallen so far; it was worth more to be a good doer than a good reader.
Finally, he forgave those who had adjudged him to die, and he desired them to pray God for
his soul."[598]

[Sidenote: Anne Boleyn confesses to Cranmer that she has never been lawfully married to the king.]

The queen was left till a further mystery had perplexed yet deeper the disgraceful exposure.
Henry had desired Cranmer to be her confessor. The archbishop was with her on the day after
her trial,[599] and she then made an extraordinary avowal,[600] either that she had been married
or contracted in early life, or had been entangled in some connexion which invalidated her
marriage with the king. The letter to the emperor, which I have already quoted,[601] furnishes
the solitary explanation of the mystery which remains. Some one, apparently the imperial ambassador,
informed Charles that she was discovered to have been nine years before married to Lord Percy,
not formally only, but really and completely. If this be true, her fate need scarcely excite
further sympathy.

[Sidenote: The queen is pronounced divorced.]

On Wednesday she was taken to Lambeth, where she made her confession in form, and the archbishop,
sitting judicially, pronounced her marriage with the king to have been null and void. The supposition,
that this business was a freak of caprice or passion, is too puerile to be considered. It is
certain that she acknowledged something; and it is certain also that Lord Northumberland was
examined upon the subject before the archbishop. In person upon oath indeed, and also in, a
letter to Cromwell, Northumberland denied that he had ever been legally connected with her;
but perhaps Northumberland was afraid to make an admission so dangerous to himself, or perhaps
the confession itself was a vague effort which she made to save her life.[602] But whatever
she said, and whether she spoke truth or falsehood, she was pronounced divorced, and the divorce
did not save her.[603] Friday, the 19th, was fixed for her death; and when she found that there
was no hope she recovered her spirits. The last scene was to be on the green inside the Tower.
The public were to be admitted; but Kingston suggested that to avoid a crowd it was desirable
not to fix the hour, since it was supposed that she would make no further confession.

[Sidenote: Thursday, May 18. Kingston's tribute to her conduct in the Tower.]

"This morning she sent for me," he added, "that I might be with her at such time as she received
the good Lord, to the intent that I should hear her speak as touching her innocency always
to be clear. 'Mr. Kingston,' she said, 'I hear say I shall not die afore noon, and I am very
sorry therefore, for I thought to be dead by this time, and past my pain.' I told her it should
be no pain, it was so subtle; and then she said, 'I heard say the executioner was very good,
and I have a little neck,' and put her hands about it, laughing heartily. I have seen many
men, and also women, executed, and they have been in great sorrow; and to my knowledge, this
lady hath much joy and pleasure in death."[604]

[Sidenote: Friday, May 19. Tower Green at noon.]

We are very near the termination of the tragedy. A little before noon on the 19th of May, Anne
Boleyn, Queen of England, was led down to the green. A single cannon stood loaded on the battlements;
the motionless cannoneer was ready, with smoking linstock, to tell London that all was over.
The yeomen of the guard were there, and a crowd of citizens; the lord mayor in his robes, the
deputies of the guilds, the sheriffs, and the aldermen; they were come to see a spectacle which
England had never seen before--a head which had worn the crown falling under the sword of an
executioner.

[Sidenote: The scaffold, and the persons present upon it.]

On the scaffold, by the king's desire, there were present Cromwell, the Lord Chancellor, the
Duke of Suffolk, and lastly, the Duke of Richmond, who might now, when both his sisters were
illegitimized, be considered heir presumptive to the throne. As in the choice of the commission,
as in the conduct of the trial, as in the summons of parliament, as in every detail through
which the cause was passed, Henry had shown outwardly but one desire to do all which the most
strict equity prescribed, so around this last scene he had placed those who were nearest in
blood to himself, and nearest in rank to the crown. If she who was to suffer was falling under
a forged charge, he acted his part with horrible completeness.

[Sidenote: The queen's last words.]

The queen appeared walking feebly, supported by the Lieutenant of the Tower. She seemed half
stupified and looked back from time to time at the ladies by whom she was followed. On reaching
the platform, she asked if she might say a few words;[605] and permission being granted, she
turned to the spectators and said: "Christian people, I am come to die. And according to law,
and by law, I am judged to death; and therefore I will speak nothing against it. I am come
hither to accuse no man, nor to speak anything of that whereof I am accused and condemned to
die. But I pray God save the king, and send him long to reign over you; for a gentler and more
merciful prince was there never; and to me he was ever a good, a gentle, and sovereign lord.
If any person will meddle of my cause, I require him to judge the best. And thus I take my
leave of the world and of you; and I heartily desire you all to pray for me. Oh, Lord, have
mercy on me. To God I commend my soul."[606] "These words," says Stow, "she spoke with a smiling
countenance." She wore an ermine cloak which was then taken off. She herself removed her headdress,
and one of her attendants gave her a cap into which she gathered her hair. She then knelt,
and breathing faintly a commendation of her soul to Christ, the executioner with a single blow
struck off her head. A white handkerchief was thrown over it as it fell, and one of the ladies
took it up and carried it away. The other women lifted the body and bore it into the Chapel
of the Tower, where it was buried in the choir.[607]

Thus she too died without denying the crime for which she suffered. Smeton confessed from the
first. Brereton, Weston, Rochfort, virtually confessed on the scaffold. Norris said nothing.
Of all the sufferers not one ventured to declare that he or she was innocent,--and that six
human beings should leave the world with the undeserved stain of so odious a charge on them,
without attempting to clear themselves, is credible only to those who form opinions by their
wills, and believe or disbelieve as they choose.

To this end the queen had come at last, and silence is the best comment which charity has to
offer upon it. Better far it would have been if the dust had been allowed to settle down over
the grave of Anne Boleyn, and her remembrance buried in forgetfulness. Strange it is that a
spot which ought to have been sacred to pity, should have been made the arena for the blind
wrestling of controversial duellists. Blind, I call it; for there has been little clearness
of judgment, little even of common prudence in the choice of sides. If the Catholics could
have fastened the stain of murder on the king and the statesmen of England, they would have
struck the faith of the establishment a harder blow than by a poor tale of scandal against
a weak, erring, suffering woman: and the Protestants, in mistaken generosity, have courted
an infamy for the names of those to whom they owe their being, which, staining the fountain,
must stain for ever the stream which flows from it. It has been no pleasure to me to rake among
the evil memories of the past, to prove a human being sinful whom the world has ruled to have
been innocent. Let the blame rest with those who have forced upon our history the alternative
of a reassertion of the truth, or the shame of noble names which have not deserved it at our hands.

[Sidenote: Fresh perplexity in the succession.]

[Sidenote: Elizabeth now illegitimate.]

[Sidenote: Lord Thomas Howard and Lady Margaret Douglas.]

No sooner had the result of the trial appeared to be certain, than the prospects of the succession
to the throne were seen to be more perplexed than ever. The prince so earnestly longed for
had not been born. The disgrace of Anne Boleyn, even before her last confession, strengthened
the friends of the Princess Mary. Elizabeth, the child of a doubtful marriage which had terminated
in adultery and incest, would have had slight chance of being maintained, even if her birth
had suffered no further stain; and by the Lambeth sentence she was literally and legally illegitimate.
The King of Scotland was now the nearest heir; and next to him stood Lady Margaret Douglas,
his sister, who had been born in England, and was therefore looked upon with better favour
by the people. As if to make confusion worse confounded, in the midst of the uncertainty Lord
Thomas Howard, taking advantage of the moment, and, as the act or his attainder says,[608]
"being seduced by the devil, and not having the fear of God before his eyes," persuaded this
lady into a contract of marriage with him; "The presumption being," says the same act, "that
he aspired to the crown by reason of so high a marriage; or, at least, to the making division
for the same; having a firm hope and trust that the subjects of this realm[609] would incline
and bear affection to the said Lady Margaret, being born in this realm; and not to the King
of Scots, her brother, to whom this realm hath not, nor ever had, any affection; but would
resist his attempt to the crown of this realm to the uttermost of their powers."[610]

[Sidenote: The council and the peers urge the king to an instant re-marriage.]

Before the discovery of this proceeding, but in anticipation of inevitable intrigues of the
kind, the privy council and the peers, on the same grounds which had before led them to favour
the divorce from Catherine, petitioned the king to save the country from the perils which menaced
it, and to take a fresh wife without an hour's delay. Henry's experience of matrimony had been
so discouraging, that they feared he might be reluctant to venture upon it again. Nevertheless,
for his country's sake, they trusted that he would not refuse.[611]

[Sidenote: He marries Jane Seymour.]

Henry, professedly in obedience to this request, was married, immediately after the execution,
to Jane, daughter of Sir John Seymour. The indecent haste is usually considered a proof entirely
conclusive of the cause of Anne Boleyn's ruin.[612] Under any aspect it was an extraordinary
step, which requires to be gravely considered. Henry, who waited seven years for Anne Boleyn,
to whom he was violently attached, was not without control over his passions; and if appetite
had been the moving influence with him, he would scarcely, with the eyes of all the world upon
him, have passed so extravagant an insult upon the nation of which he was the sovereign. If
Jane Seymour had really been the object of a previous unlawful attachment, her conduct in accepting
so instantly a position so frightfully made vacant, can scarcely be painted in too revolting
colours. Yet Jane Seymour's name, at home and abroad, by Catholic and Protestant, was alike
honoured and respected. Among all Henry's wives she stands out distinguished by a stainless
name, untarnished with the breath of reproach.

If we could conceive the English nation so tongue-tied that they dared not whisper their feelings,
there were Brussels, Paris, Rome, where the truth could be told; yet, with the exception of
a single passage in a letter of Mary of Hungary,[613] there is no hint in the correspondence,
either in Paris, Simancas, or Brussels, that there was a suspicion of foul play. If Charles
or Francis had believed Henry really capable of so deep atrocity, no political temptation would
have induced either of them to commit their cousins or nieces to the embrace of a monster,
yet no sooner was Jane Seymour dead, than we shall find them competing eagerly with each other
to secure his hand.

It is quite possible that when Anne Boleyn was growing licentious, the king may have distinguished
a lady of acknowledged excellence by some in no way improper preference, and that when desired
by the council to choose a wife immediately, he should have taken a person as unlike as possible
to the one who had disgraced him. This was the interpretation which was given to his conduct
by the Lords and Commons of England. In the absence of any evidence, or shadow of evidence,
that among contemporaries who had means of knowing the truth, another judgment was passed upon
it, the deliberate assertion of an act of parliament must be considered a safer guide than
modern unsupported conjecture.[614]

[Sidenote: June 8. Parliament meets.]

This matter having been accomplished, the king returned to London to meet parliament. The Houses
assembled on the 8th of June; the peers had hastened up in unusual numbers, as if sensible
of the greatness of the occasion. The Commons were untried and unknown; and if Anne Boleyn
was an innocent victim, no king of England was ever in so terrible a position as Henry VIII.
when he entered the Great Chamber fresh from his new bridal. He took his seat upon the throne;
and then Audeley, the Lord Chancellor, rose and spoke:[615]

[Sidenote: The Lord Chancellor's speech at the opening.]

[Sidenote: The succession must be reconsidered.]

[Sidenote: And the king desires the parliament to name an heir apparent.]

"At the dissolution of the late parliament, the King's Highness had not thought so soon to
meet you here again. He has called you together now, being moved thereunto by causes of grave
moment, affecting both his own person and the interests of the commonwealth. You will have
again to consider the succession to the crown of this realm. His Highness knows himself to
be but mortal, liable to fall sick, and to die.[616] At present he perceives the peace and
welfare of the kingdom to depend upon his single life; and he is anxious to leave it, at his
death, free from peril. He desires you therefore to nominate some person as his heir apparent,
who, should it so befall him (which God forbid!) to depart out of this world without children
lawfully begotten, may rule in peace over this land, with the consent and the good will of
the inhabitants thereof.

"You will also deliberate upon the repeal of a certain act passed in the late parliament, by
which the realm is bound to obedience to the Lady Anne Boleyn, late wife of the king, and the
heirs lawfully begotten of them twain, and which declares all persons who shall, by word or
deed, have offended against this lady or her offspring, to have incurred the penalties of treason.

[Sidenote: The Lord Chancellor's advice to the Houses.]

"These are the causes for which you are assembled; and if you will be advised by me, you will
act in these matters according to the words of Solomon, with whom our most gracious king may
deservedly be compared. The "wise man" counsels us to bear in mind such things as be past,
to weigh well such things as be present, and provide prudently for the things which be to come.
And you I would bid to remember, first, those sorrows and those burdens which the King's Highness
did endure on the occasion of his first unlawful marriage--a marriage not only judged unlawful
by the most famous universities in Christendom, but so determined by the consent of this realm;
and to remember further the great perils which have threatened his most royal Majesty from
the time when he entered on his second marriage.

[Sidenote: The gratitude due to the king for his third adventure into marriage.]

"Then, turning to the present, you will consider in what state the realm now standeth with
respect to the oath by which we be bound to the Lady Anne and to her offspring; the which Lady
Anne, with her accomplices, has been found guilty of high treason, and has met the due reward
of her conspiracies. And then you will ask yourselves, what man of common condition would not
have been deterred by such calamities from venturing a third time into the state of matrimony.
Nevertheless, our most excellent prince, not in any carnal concupiscence, but at the humble
entreaty of his nobility, hath consented once more to accept that condition, and has taken
to himself a wife who in age and form is deemed to be meet and apt for the procreation of children.

"Lastly, according to the third injunction, let us now do our part in providing for things
to come. According to the desire of his most gracious Highness, let us name some person to
be his heir; who, in case (quod absit) that he depart this life leaving no offspring lawfully
begotten, may be our lawful sovereign. But let us pray Almighty God that He will graciously
not leave our prince thus childless; and let us give Him thanks for that He hath preserved
his Highness to us out of so many dangers; seeing that his Grace's care and efforts be directed
only to the ruling his subjects in peace and charity so long as his life endures, and to the
leaving us, when he shall come to die, in sure possession of these blessings."

[Sidenote: The speech digested into a statute.]

[Sidenote: July 1. Reassertion of the independence of the realm.]

Three weeks after Anne Boleyn's death and the king's third marriage, the chancellor dared to
address the English legislature in these terms: and either he spoke like a reasonable man,
which he may have done, or else he was making an exhibition of effrontery to be paralleled
only by Seneca's letter to the Roman Senate after the murder of Agrippina. The legislature
adopted the first interpretation, and the heads of the speech were embodied in an act of parliament.
While the statute was in preparation, they made use of the interval in continuing the business
of the Reformation. They abolished finally the protection of sanctuary in cases of felony,
extending the new provisions even to persons in holy orders:[617] they calmed the alarms of
Cranmer and the Protestants by re asserting the extinction of the authority of the pope;[618]
and they passed various other laws of economic and social moment. At length, on the 1st of
July, in a crowded house, composed of fourteen bishops,[619] eighteen abbots, and thirty-nine
lay peers,[620] a bill was read a first time of such importance that I must quote at length
its own most noticeable words.

[Sidenote: Second great Act of Succession. The parliament endorse all the proceedings in the
late trials.]

The preamble commenced with reciting those provisions of the late acts which were no longer
to remain in force. It then proceeded, in the form of an address to the king, to adopt and
endorse the divorce and the execution. "Albeit," it ran, "most dread Sovereign Lord, that these
acts were made, as it was then thought, upon a pure, perfect, and clear foundation; your Majesty's
nobles and commons, thinking the said marriage then had between your Highness and the Lady
Anne in their consciences to have been pure, sincere, perfect, and good, and so was reputed
and taken in the realm; [yet] now of late God, of his infinite goodness, from whom no secret
things can be hid, hath caused to be brought to light evident and open knowledge of certain
just, true, and lawful impediments, unknown at the making of the said acts; and since that
time confessed by the Lady Anne, before the Most Reverend Father in God, Thomas, Archbishop
of Canterbury, sitting judicially for the same; by the which it plainly appeareth that the
said marriage was never good, nor consonant to the laws, but utterly void and of none effect;
by reason whereof your Highness was and is lawfully divorced from the bonds of the said marriage
in the life of the said Lady Anne:

"And over this, most dread Lord, albeit that your Majesty, not knowing of any lawful impediments,
entered into the bonds of the said unlawful marriage, and advanced the same Lady Anne to the
honour of the sovereign estate of the queen of this realm; yet she, nevertheless, inflamed
with pride and carnal desires of her body, putting apart the dread of God and excellent benefits
received of your Highness, confederated herself with George Boleyn, late Lord Rochfort, her
natural brother, Henry Norris, Esq., Francis Weston, Esq., William Brereton, Esq., gentlemen
of your privy chamber, and Mark Smeton, groom of your said privy chamber; and so being confederate,
she and they most traitorously committed and perpetrated divers detestable and abominable treasons,
to the fearful peril and danger of your royal person, and to the utter loss, disherison, and
desolation of this realm, if God of his goodness had not in due time brought their said treasons
to light; for the which, being plainly and manifestly proved, they were convict and attainted
by due course and order of your common law of this realm, and have suffered according to the
merits:"

[Sidenote: The late queen declared attainted.]

In consequence of these treasons, and to lend, if possible, further weight to the sentence
against her, the late queen was declared attainted by authority of parliament, as she already
was by the common law. The Act then proceeded:

[Sidenote: Opinion of parliament upon the king's third marriage.]

"And forasmuch, most gracious Sovereign, as it hath pleased your royal Majesty--(notwithstanding
the great intolerable perils and occasions which your Highness hath suffered and sustained,
as well by occasion of your first unlawful marriage, as by occasion of your second); at the
most humble petition and intercession of us your nobles of this realm, for the ardent love
and fervent affection which your Highness beareth to the conservation of the peace and amity
of the same, and of the good and quiet governance thereof, of your most excellent goodness
to enter into marriage again; and [forasmuch as you] have chosen and taken a right noble, virtuous,
and excellent lady, Queen Jane, to your true and lawful wife; who, for her convenient years,
excellent beauty, and pureness of flesh and blood, is apt to conceive issue by your Highness;
which marriage is so pure and sincere, without spot, doubt, or impediment, that the issue presented
under the same, when it shall please Almighty God to send it, cannot be truly, lawfully, nor
justly interrupted or disturbed of the right and title in the succession of your crown: May
it now please your Majesty, for the extinguishment of all doubts, and for the pure and perfect
unity of us your subjects, and all our posterities, that inasmuch as the marriage with the
Lady Catherine having been invalid, the issue of that marriage is therefore illegitimate; and
the marriage with the Lady Anne Boleyn having been upon true and just causes deemed of no value
nor effect, the issue of this marriage is also illegitimate; the succession to the throne be
now therefore determined to the issue of the marriage with Queen Jane."[621]

[Sidenote: The succession determined to the issue of the king by Queen Jane.]

[Sidenote: A reason for demurring to the popular judgment in this matter.]

Thus was every step which had been taken in this great matter deliberately sanctioned[622]
by parliament. The criminality of the queen was considered to have been proved; the sentence
upon her to have been just. The king was thanked in the name of the nation for having made
haste with the marriage which has been regarded as the temptation to his crime. It is wholly
impossible to dismiss facts like these with a few contemptuous phrases; and when I remember
that the purity of Elizabeth is an open question among our historians, although the foulest
kennels must be swept to find the filth with which to defile it; while Anne Boleyn is ruled
to have been a saint, notwithstanding the solemn verdict of the Lords and Commons, the clergy,
the council, judges, and juries, pronounced against her,--I feel that with such a judgment
caprice has had more to do than a just appreciation of evidence.

[Sidenote: The contingency to be provided for, of the last marriage proving unfruitful.]

The parliament had not yet, however, completed their work. It was possible, as the lord chancellor
had said, that the last marriage might prove unfruitful, and this contingency was still unprovided
for. The king had desired the Lords and Commons to name his successor; they replied with an
act which showed the highest confidence in his patriotism; they conferred a privilege upon
him unknown to the constitution, yet a power which, if honestly exercised, offered by far the
happiest solution of the difficulty.

Henry had three children. The Duke of Richmond was illegitimate in the strictest sense, but
he had been bred as a prince; and I have shown that, in default of a legitimate heir, the king
had thought of him as his possible successor. Mary and Elizabeth were illegitimate also, according
to law and form; but the illegitimacy of neither the one nor the other could be pressed to
its literal consequences. They were the children, each of them, of connexions which were held
legal at the period of their birth. They had each received the rank of a princess; and the
instincts of justice demanded that they should be allowed a place in the line of inheritance.
Yet, while this feeling was distinctly entertained, it was difficult to give effect to it by
statute, without a further complication of questions already too complicated, and without provoking
intrigue and jealousy in other quarters. The Princess Mary also had not yet receded from the
defiant attitude which she had assumed. She had lent herself to conspiracy, she had broken
her allegiance, and had as yet made no submission. To her no favour could be shown while she
remained in this position; and it was equally undesirable to give Elizabeth, under the altered
circumstances, a permanent preference to her sister.

[Sidenote: The parliament grant the king a power to bequeath the crown by will.]

The parliament, therefore, with as much boldness as good sense, cut the knot, by granting Henry
the power to bequeath the crown by will. He could thus advance the Duke of Richmond, if Richmond's
character as a man fulfilled the promise of his youth; and he could rescue his daughters from
the consequences of their mother's misfortunes or their mother's faults. It was an expression
of confidence, as honourable to the country as to the king; and if we may believe, as the records
say, that the tragedy of the past month had indeed grieved and saddened Henry, the generous
language in which the legislature committed the future of the nation into his hands, may have
something soothed his wounds.

[Sidenote: The reasons alleged for this measure.]

"Forasmuch as it standeth," they said, "in the only pleasure and will of Almighty God, whether
your Majesty shall have heirs begotten and procreated from this (late) marriage, or else any
lawful heirs or issues hereafter of your own body, begotten by any other lawful wife; and if
such heirs should fail (as God defend), and no provision be made in your life who should rule
and govern this realm, then this realm, after your transitory life, shall be destitute of a
governor, or else percase [be] encumbered with a person that would count to aspire to the same,
whom the subjects of this realm shall not find in their hearts to love, dread, and obediently
serve[623] as their sovereign lord; and if your Grace, before it be certainly known whether
ye shall have heirs or not, should suddenly name and declare any person or persons to succeed
after your decease, then it is to be doubted that such person so named might happen to take
great heart and courage, and by presumption fall to inobedience and rebellion; by occasion
of which premises, divisions and dissensions are likely to arise and spring in this realm,
to the great peril and destruction of us, your most humble and obedient servants, and all our
posterities: For reformation and remedy hereof, we, your most bounden and loving subjects,
most obediently acknowledging that your Majesty, prudently, victoriously, politicly, and indifferently,
hath maintained this realm in peace and quietness during all the time of your most gracious
reign, putting our trust and confidence in your Highness, and nothing doubting but that your
Majesty, if you should fail of heirs lawfully begotten, for the love and affection that ye
bear to this realm, and for avoiding all the occasions of divisions afore rehearsed, so earnestly
mindeth the wealth of the same, that ye can best and most prudently provide such a governour
for us and this your realm, as will succeed and follow in the just and right tract of all your
proceedings, and maintain, keep, and defend the same and all the laws and ordinances established
in your Grace's time for the wealth of the realm, which we all desire, do therefore most humbly
beseech your Highness, that it may be enacted, for avoiding all ambiguities, doubts, and divisions,
that your Highness shall have full and plenary power and authority to dispose, by your letters
patent under your great seal, or else by your last will made in writing, and signed with your
hand, the imperial crown of this realm, and all other the premises thereunto belonging, to
such person or persons as shall please your Highness.

"And we, your humble and obedient subjects, do faithfully promise to your Majesty, by one common
assent, that after your decease, we, our heirs and successors, shall accept and take, love,
dread, and only obey such person or persons, male or female, as your Majesty shall give your
imperial crown unto; and wholly to stick to them as true and faithful subjects ought to do."[624]

[542] Lord Herbert, p. 188. It will have been observed, that neither in this letter, nor in
the other authentic papers connected with her death, is there any allusion to Cardinal Pole's
famous story, that being on her deathbed, Queen Catherine prayed the king to allow her to see
her daughter for the last time, and that the request was refused. Pole was not in England at
the time. He drew his information from Catholic rumour, as vindictive as it was credulous;
and in the many letters from members of the privy council to him which we possess, his narrative
is treated as throughout a mere wild collection of fables. I require some better evidence to
persuade me that this story is any truer than the rest, when we know that Catherine allowed
the king to hear that she was dying, not from herself, but from a foreign ambassador; and that
such a request could have been made in the few days which intervened between this intimation
and her death, without some traces of it appearing in the close account which we possess of
her language and actions during those days, is in a high degree unlikely.

[543] See Lingard, Vol. V. p. 30. Hall says: "Queen Anne wore yellow for mourning."

[544] The directions for the funeral are printed in Lingard Vol. V., Appendix, p. 267.

[545] It ought not to be necessary to say that her will was respected--Lord Herbert, p. 188;
but the king's conduct to Catherine of Arragon has provoked suspicion even where suspicion
is unjust; and much mistaken declamation has been wasted in connexion with this matter upon
an offence wholly imaginary.

In making her bequests, Catherine continued to regard herself as the king's wife, in which
capacity she professed to have no power to dispose of her property. She left her legacies in
the form of a petition to her husband. She had named no executors; and being in the eyes of
the law "a sole woman," the administration lapsed in consequence to the nearest of kin, the
emperor. Some embarrassment was thus created, and the attorney-general was obliged to evade
the difficulty by a legal artifice, before the king could take possession, and give effect
to the bequests.--See Strype's Memor., Vol. I., Appendix, pp. 252-255. Miss Strickland's valuable
volumes are so generally read, that I venture to ask her to reconsider the passage which she
has written on this subject. The king's offences against Catherine require no unnecessary exaggeration.

[559] I must draw particular attention to this. Parliament had been just dissolved, and a fresh
body of untried men were called together for no other purpose than to take cognizance of the
supposed discovery.--See the Speech of the Lord Chancellor: Lords' Journals, p. 84. If the
accusations were intentionally forged by the king, to go out of the way to court so needless
publicity was an act most strange and most incomprehensible.

inconsistent with himself. See his Memorial, Archæologia, Vol. XXIII. p. 63.

[561] His name repeatedly occurs in "the Privy Purse Expenses of Henry VIII."

[562] Five years later, after the shameful behaviour of Catherine Howard, the duke wrote to
the king of "the abominable deeds done by two of my nieces against your Highness;" which he
said have "brought me into the greatest perplexity that ever poor wretch was in, fearing that
your Majesty, having so often and by so many of my kyn been thus falsely and traitorously handled,
might not only conceive a displeasure in your heart against me and all other of that kyn, but
also in manner abhor to hear speak of any of the same."--Norfolk to Henry VIII.: State Papers,

[565] See Lingard, Vol. V. p. 33. It is not certain whether the examination of the prisoners
was at Greenwich or at the Tower. Baynton's letter is dated from Greenwich, but that is not
conclusive. Constantyne says (Archæologia, Vol. XXIII. p. 63) that the king took Norris with
him to London, and, as he heard say, urged him all the way to confess, with promises of pardon
if he would be honest with him. Norris persisted in his denial, however, and was committed
to the Tower. Afterwards, before the council, he confessed. On his trial, his confession was
read to him, and he said he was deceived into making it by Sir W. Fitzwilliam: an accusation
against this gentleman very difficult to believe.

[569] She said, "I think it much unkindness in the king to put such about me as I never loved."

[571] The disorder of which the king ultimately died--ulceration in the legs--had already begun
to show itself.

an allusion to a Mistress Margery. The passage is so injured as to be almost unintelligible:--"I
have mused much et ... of Mistress Margery, which hath used her ... strangely towards me of
late, being her friend as I have been. But no doubt it cannot be but she must be of councell
therewith. There hath been great friendship between the queen and her of late."--Sir E. Baynton
to the Lord Treasurer: Singer, p. 458.

[573] Kingston to Cromwell: Singer, pp. 452, 453. Of Smeton she said, "He was never in my chamber
but at Winchester;" she had sent for him "to play on the virginals," for there her lodging
was above the king's.... "I never spoke with him since," she added, "but upon Saturday before
May day, and then I found him standing in the round window in my chamber of presence, and I
asked why he was so sad, and he answered and said it was no matter; and then she said, 'You
may not look to have me speak to you as I should to a nobleman, because you be an inferior
person.'--'No, no, madam; a look sufficeth me [he said], and thus fare you well.'"--Singer, p. 455.

[574] Printed in Burnet, Vol. I. p. 322, et seq.

[575] "Mark is the worst cherished of any man in the house, for he wears irons."--Kingston
to Cromwell. Later writers have assured themselves that Smeton's confession was extorted from
him by promises of pardon. Why, then, was the government so impolitic as to treat him with
especial harshness so early in the transaction? When he found himself "ironed," he must have
been assured that faith would not be kept with him; and he had abundant time to withdraw what
he had said.

[576] The sentence is mutilated, but the meaning seems intelligible: "The queen standeth stiffly
in her opinion that she wo ... which I think is in the trust that she [hath in the] other two,"--i.e.
Norris and Weston.--Baynton to the Lord Treasurer. The government seems to have been aware
of some secret communication between her and Norris.--Ibid Singer, p. 458.

[577] Kingston to Cromwell: Singer, p. 457.

[578] My first impression of this letter was strongly in favour of its authenticity. I still
allow it to stand in the text because it exists, and because there is no evidence, external
or internal, to prove it to be a forgery. The more carefully I have examined the MS., however,
the greater uncertainty I have felt about it. It is not an original. It is not an official
copy. It does not appear, though here I cannot speak conclusively, to be even a contemporary
copy. The only guide to the date is the watermark on the paper, and in this instance the evidence
is indecisive.--Note to the 2d edition.

[584] We shall meet him again in Ireland: he was the queen's cousin, and man of the very highest
character and ability. The grand jury of Kent were nominated by Sir Thomas Wyatt, who was sheriff
for that year. This is not unimportant, for Wyatt in past times had been Anne's intimate friend,
if not her lover.

[585] The indictment found at Deptford was exactly similar; referring to other acts of the
same kind, committed by the same persons at Greenwich.

[586] Baga de Secretis, pouch 9.

[587] Sir Francis Bryan, the queen's cousin, was at first suspected. He was absent from the
court, and received a message from Cromwell to appeal instantly on his allegiance. The following
extract is from the Deposition of the Abbot of Woburn--MS. Cotton. Cleopatra, E 4.:

"The said abbot remembereth that at the fall of Queen Anne, whom God pardon, Master Bryan,
being in the country, was suddenly sent for by the Lord Privy Seal, as the said Master Bryan
afterwards shewed me, charging him upon his allegiance to come to him wheresoever he was within
this realm upon the sight of his letter, and so he did with all speed. And at his next repair
to Ampthill, I came to visit him there, at what time the Lord Grey of Wilton, with many other
men of worship, was with him in the great court at Ampthill aforesaid. And at my coming in
at the outer gate Master Bryan perceived me, and of his much gentleness came towards meeting
me; to whom I said, 'Now welcome home and never so welcome.' He, astonished, said unto me,
'Why so?' The said abbot said, 'Sir, I shall shew you that at leisure,' and walked up into
the great chamber with the men of worship. And after a pause it pleased him to sit down upon
a bench and willed me to sit by him, and after that demanded of me what I meant when I said,
'Never so welcome as then;' to whom I said thus: 'Sir, Almighty God in his first creation made
an order of angels, and among all made one principal, which was the ----, who would not be
content with his estate, but affected the celsitude and rule of Creator, for the which he was
divested from the altitude of heaven into the profundity of hell into everlasting darkness,
without repair or return, with those that consented unto his pride. So it now lately befell
in this our worldly hierarchy of the court by the fall of Queen Anne as a worldly Lucifer,
not content with her estate to be true unto her creator, making her his queen, but affected
unlawful concupiscence, fell suddenly out of that felicity wherein she was set, irrecoverably
with all those that consented unto her lust, whereof I am glad that ye were never; and, therefore,
now welcome and never so welcome, here is the end of my tale.' And then he said unto me: 'Sir,
indeed, as you say, I was suddenly sent for, marvelling thereof and debating the matter in
my mind why this should be; at the last I considered and knew myself true and clear in conscience
unto my prince, and with all speed and without fear [hastily set] me forward and came to my
Lord Privy Seal, and after that to the King's Grace, and nothing found in me, nor never shall
be, but just and true to my master the King's Grace.' And then I said 'Benedictus, but this
was a marvellous peremptory commandment,' said I, 'and would have astonished the wisest man
in this realm.' And he said, 'What then, he must needs do his master's commandment, and I assure
you there never was a man wiser to order the king's causes than he is; I pray God save his life.'"

The language both of Sir Francis Bryan and the abbot is irreconcileable with any other supposition,
except that they at least were satisfied of the queen's guilt.

was the only nobleman in the power of the insurgents who refused to join in the rebellion.
They threatened to kill him; but "at that and all times the earl was very earnest against the
commons in the king's behalf and the Lord Privy Seal's."--Confession of William Stapleton:

[594] I know not whether I should here add the details which Meteren gives of these trials.
His authority, a Flemish gentleman, was in London at the time, but was not present in the court.
The Lord of Milherve (that was this gentleman's name) was persuaded that the queen was unjustly
accused, and he worked out of the rumours which he heard an interesting picture, touched with
natural sympathy. It has been often repeated, however. It may be read elsewhere; and as an
authority it is but of faint importance. If we allow it its fullest weight, it proves that
a foreigner then in England believed the queen innocent, and that she defended herself with
an eloquence which deeply touched her hearers. His further assertion, that "Smeton's confession
was all which was alleged" against her, is certainly inaccurate; and his complaint, which has
been so often echoed, of the absence of witnesses, implies only a want of knowledge of the
forms which were observed in trials for high treason. The witnesses were not brought into court
and confronted with the prisoner: their depositions were taken on oath before the grand juries
and the privy council, and on the trial were read out for the accused to answer as they could.

[595] Two grand juries, the petty jury, and the twenty-seven peers.

Sir Henry Norris at this time, and a friend and school-fellow of Sir W. Brereton. He was a
resolute Protestant, and he says that at first he and all other friends of the gospel were
unable to believe that the queen had behaved so abominably. "As I may be saved before God,"
he says, "I could not believe it, afore I heard them speak at their death." ... But on the
scaffold, he adds, "In a manner all confessed but Mr. Norris, who said almost nothing at all."

to be spared, and that she would retire to Antwerp.--to Cromwell: Singer, p. 460.

[603] Burnet raises a dilemma here. If, he says, the queen was not married to the king, there
was no adultery; and the sentence of death and the sentence of divorce mutually neutralize
each other. It is possible that in the general horror at so complicated a delinquency, the
technical defence was overlooked.

on the king, considering a single prince an insufficient security for the future. In a letter
of Cromwell's to the English ambassador at Paris, on the day of Jane Seymour's death, there
is the following passage:

"And forasmuch as, though his Majesty is not anything disposed to marry again--albeit his Highness,
God be thanked, taketh this chance as a man that by reason with force overcometh his affections
may take such an extreme adventure--yet as sundry of his Grace's council here have thought
it meet for us to be most humble suitors to his Majesty to consider the state of his realm,
and to enter eftsoons into another matrimony: so his tender zeal to us his subjects hath already
so much overcome his Grace's said disposition, and framed his mind both to be indifferent to
the thing and to the election of any person from any part that, with deliberation, shall be
thought meet for him, that we live in hope that his Grace will again couple himself to our
comforts."--State Papers, Vol. VIII. p. 1.

[612] Burnet, Hume, Strickland, &c. There is an absolute consensus of authorities.

[613] "The king has, I understand, already married another woman, who, they say, is a good
Imperialist. I know not whether she will so continue. He had shown an inclination for her before
the other's death; and as neither that other herself, nor any of the rest who were put to death,
confessed their guilt, except one who was a musician, some people think he invented the charge
to get rid of her. However it be, no great wrong can have been done to the woman herself. She
is known to have been a worthless person. It has been her character for a long time.

"I suppose, if one may speak so lightly of such things, that when he is tired of his new wife
he will find some occasion to quit himself of her also. Our sex will not be too well satisfied
if these practices come into vogue; and, though I have no fancy to expose myself to danger,
yet, being a woman, I will pray with the rest that God will have mercy on us."--The Pilgrim,
p. 117.

[614] Within four months the northern counties were in arms. Castle and cottage and village
pulpit rang with outcries against the government. Yet, in the countless reports of the complaints
of the insurgents, there is no hint of a suspicion of foul play in the late tragedy. If the
criminality of the king is self-evident to us, how could it have been less than evident to
Aske and Lord Darcy?

[621] 28 Hen. VIII. cap. 7. The three last paragraphs, I need scarcely say, are a very brief
epitome of very copious language.

[622] The archbishop's sentence of divorce was at the same time submitted to Convocation and
approved by it.
