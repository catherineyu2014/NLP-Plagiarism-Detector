William Newsom had been extensively engaged in commerce through great part of his life, and
there was reason to fear he was unduly absorbed by its cares and allurements: for the last
year or more, he appeared to be becoming more sensible that disappointment was stamped upon
his pursuits; his bodily health heretofore unbroken, began also to decline, and it was comfortingly
believed by his friends, that this and other revolving circumstances, were tending to turn
the energies of his mind from perishable, to imperishable objects.  A few months before his
decease, it became still more evident, that the hand of his heavenly Father was laid upon him
in mercy; and on one occasion, he remarked, "that he saw nothing in the world worth living
for, it abounded in trouble and disappointment, all outward things were stained in his eyes,
there was nothing but religion that could be of any avail for any of us; and it mattered not
when we were taken--young, old, or middle aged--if we were but ready, that was the great point!"
His experience, however, during the last few days of his life shewed, that although the ground
might have been prepared, the work was by no means effected; deep and sore conflict was then
his portion, and oh! with what fervency did he call upon his Saviour, beseeching him in his
mercy to be pleased to look down upon his poor unworthy creature, for he alone could help in
that awful hour.  Once he exclaimed, "what could all the world do for me now?"  His wife, under
great exercise of spirit, replied, "Nothing! the best, when laid upon such a bed as thou art,
have nothing to look to or depend upon, but the mercy of the Saviour;" the poor sufferer earnestly
pleaded that that mercy might be extended to him, remarking, "He has all power in heaven and
in earth."  He then fervently prayed that the Lord would save his never dying soul.  It is
believed, that whilst his many sins of omission and commission were brought vividly before
his view, by the unflattering witness, he was made very fully sensible that the great work
of salvation rests between the soul of man and his Creator, and that "no man can redeem his
brother, or give to God a ransom for him."  Through the night, he was mostly engaged in prayer,
with uplifted hands invoking for mercy and forgiveness.

Some time before his death, the great conflict of mind he had been under, appeared to subside,
and to be succeeded by a sweet calm, and he intimated to his wife, that he felt comfortable
and satisfied.  Till within half an hour of the close, prayer continued flowing from his lips,
the last audible sounds being an appeal to the Lord; and but a few minutes before he ceased
to breathe, a conscious look at his dear wife, seemed to say, "all is peace;" and it was granted
to her exercised spirit to believe, that the unshackled soul when released, was received into
a mansion of rest, through the mercy and merits of his Lord and Saviour.  In reference to that
impressive hour this dear relative writes,--"Oh! how many times that solemn night, did I long
that all the world could feel the great necessity, whilst in health and strength, so to live,
as to be prepared for that awful hour, which sooner or later must come upon us all; it is a
very dangerous thing to put off the work of the soul's salvation to a deathbed, or to depend
upon mercy being extended as at the eleventh hour, for it may not then be found."  Let us then
be concerned to work whilst it is called to-day, and be ready to meet the awful summons,--"Steward
give up thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer steward."

Jane Prideaux, Kingsbridge.

The decease of this friend is recorded in the Annual Monitor of last year.  We have since been
furnished with the following notice of her.

Our beloved friend, Jane Prideaux, died the 26th of the Second month, 1849, aged 87 years:
for many years before her decease, she filled very acceptably the station of Elder, and therein
approved herself a lowly follower of her Lord and Master.  Very precious to her surviving friends,
is the remembrance of her innocent, circumspect walk, holding out as it does in an impressive
manner, the invitation, "Follow me as I have followed Christ."  During the latter years of
her lengthened life, the fruits of her faith became increasingly prominent, and she was endeared
to her friends and neighbours around her in no common degree.

Her patient, cheerful endurance of bodily pain was striking and instructive; and in some seasons
of closest conflict, her faith was strong, and her acknowledgment of the supporting power of
God, full and fervent.  She often said, the Lord was able to save and to deliver to the uttermost,
and would deliver her, when patience had had its perfect work.  Very impressive were her short
petitions to the Father of mercies, for his support and deliverance, accompanied as they constantly
were with the addition, "if consistent with thy will."  She remarked, "I am in the hands of
an unerring Creator, He cannot err.  We must not look to ourselves, but to our Saviour, who
loved us and gave himself for us--even for me, the most unworthy of his creatures.  He healeth
all my diseases, and I have many, but my mercies outweigh them all."  Love and interest for
her friends seemed often to dwell in her heart beyond the power of expression.  Speaking of
those who were members of the meeting to which she belonged, she sent messages to each, and
made appropriate remarks respecting them individually, dwelling with especial comfort on the
remembrance of those among them who were bearing the burden of the day, and labouring to promote
their great Master's cause.  She afterwards said, whilst tears of tenderness flowed, "Oh! how
many comfortable meetings I have had in that little meeting-house, how have I loved to go and
sit there!  It was not a little illness that kept me away: and how has it rejoiced my heart
to see individuals come in, who have been as the anointed and sent!"  On being told one morning
that Friends were going to meeting, she said, "May they know the Sun of righteousness to arise
as with healing in his wings;" emphatically adding, "I think they will."

At another time she sent messages of love to many of the members of her Monthly Meeting, adding
with an expression of feeling, to which those around could not be insensible.  "But I cannot
name all; my love is universal; God is love."

One night, when in great pain, she acknowledged in grateful terms, the kindness of her attendants,
and her belief that a blessing with a full recompense would be given them; and addressing one
of them, she continued, "I love thee tenderly, and feel thee near in the best life--in the
truth that is blessed for ever."  Afterwards, she broke forth with an audible voice thus: "Bless
the Lord, oh my soul! and praise him for all his benefits.  What can I do! how shall I praise
him enough!"  And then, as with melody of soul, she added,--

   "Heavenly blessings without number,
      Gently falling on my head."

After taking an affectionate farewell of those around her, and addressing them in an instructive
and encouraging manner, she added, "I can heartily say, that death is robbed of its sting,
and the grave of its victory. Thanks be unto God who giveth the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ." And again, "Praise and magnify the Lord!  Oh if I could sing, I would sing his praise!"

It often pleases our heavenly Father to carry forward the work of divine grace, in the hearts
of his children, by means, and through dispensations, altogether unfathomable to the finite
comprehension of men; but the humble believer, looking beyond the changing rugged path of this
life, with filial love and confidence can repose on the mercy and goodness of the Lord, and
believingly apply the language of our Saviour, "What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
know hereafter."

In very early life, the subject of the present brief notice was made sensible of the contriting
influence of divine grace on her heart, so that many of her earliest recollections were fraught
with love to her Saviour.

For many years, she was subject to attacks of illness of a very trying character, in connection
with which, she was brought as into the very furnace of affliction, and earnest were her prayers,
that 'patience might have her perfect work,' and that through faith in the wisdom of her heavenly
Father, she might become fully resigned to his holy will; and a sense of his supporting power
and presence, were often mercifully granted to her, in times of severest suffering.

Her last illness was short: two days previous to her decease, she remarked, "I have had an
awful night," but added, "my mind is calm and peaceful, I can now quite say, 'Thy will be done;'"
and to the remark, "His grace is sufficient for thee," she replied, "Oh yes! and without that,
we can do nothing; I cast all upon Him, and can say, I fully trust in His will, and in His power."

The subject of this memoir was a native of Kingsbridge, Devonshire; and was educated among
Friends.  He was not by birth a member of our Society, but was received into membership a short
time previous to his death. Having been adopted by his uncle, he was taken to Ireland, when
about fourteen years of age, as an apprentice to one of the Provincial Schools, of which his
uncle was the superintendent.
