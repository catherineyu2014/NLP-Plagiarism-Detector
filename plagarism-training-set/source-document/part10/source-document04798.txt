Little remains of this monastery which stood on the south side and not far from the city. The
Order settled in Coventry in 1381 only ten years after the foundation of the London Charter-house.
At the Dissolution the Prior and brethren, ten in all, did not emulate the heroism of the London
monks and were fortunate enough to obtain pensions instead of martyrdom. Some trifling remains
exist incorporated in a modern mansion, and a wall of the garden shows the position of doors
which led to the isolated cells of the monks. The Botoners had given freely to the building
of the church and cloisters of which Richard II laid the first stone in 1385 and afterwards
largely endowed "on condition that they should find and maintain within the precinct of their
house, twelve poor scholars from seven years old till they accomplished the age of seventeen
years, there to pray for the good estate of him the said King and of his Consort, during this
life, and for the health of their souls after death."
