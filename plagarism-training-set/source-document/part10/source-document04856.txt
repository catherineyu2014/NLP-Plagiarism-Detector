THE GOOD ANNA

Part I

The tradesmen of Bridgepoint learned to dread the sound of "Miss Mathilda", for with that name
the good Anna always conquered.

The strictest of the one price stores found that they could give things for a little less,
when the good Anna had fully said that "Miss Mathilda" could not pay so much and that she could
buy it cheaper "by Lindheims."

Lindheims was Anna's favorite store, for there they had bargain days, when flour and sugar
were sold for a quarter of a cent less for a pound, and there the heads of the departments
were all her friends and always managed to give her the bargain prices, even on other days.

Anna led an arduous and troubled life.

Anna managed the whole little house for Miss Mathilda. It was a funny little house, one of
a whole row of all the same kind that made a close pile like a row of dominoes that a child
knocks over, for they were built along a street which at this point came down a steep hill.
They were funny little houses, two stories high, with red brick fronts and long white steps.

This one little house was always very full with Miss Mathilda, an under servant, stray dogs
and cats and Anna's voice that scolded, managed, grumbled all day long.

"Sallie! can't I leave you alone a minute but you must run to the door to see the butcher boy
come down the street and there is Miss Mathilda calling for her shoes. Can I do everything
while you go around always thinking about nothing at all? If I ain't after you every minute
you would be forgetting all, the time, and I take all this pains, and when you come to me you
was as ragged as a buzzard and as dirty as a dog. Go and find Miss Mathilda her shoes where
you put them this morning."

"Peter!",--her voice rose higher,--"Peter!",--Peter was the youngest and the favorite dog,--"Peter,
if you don't leave Baby alone,"--Baby was an old, blind terrier that Anna had loved for many
years,--"Peter if you don't leave Baby alone, I take a rawhide to you, you bad dog."

The good Anna had high ideals for canine chastity and discipline. The three regular dogs, the
three that always lived with Anna, Peter and old Baby, and the fluffy little Rags, who was
always jumping up into the air just to show that he was happy, together with the transients,
the many stray ones that Anna always kept until she found them homes, were all under strict
orders never to be bad one with the other.

A sad disgrace did once happen in the family. A little transient terrier for whom Anna had
found a home suddenly produced a crop of pups. The new owners were certain that this Foxy had
known no dog since she was in their care. The good Anna held to it stoutly that her Peter and
her Rags were guiltless, and she made her statement with so much heat that Foxy's owners were
at last convinced that these results were due to their neglect.

"You bad dog," Anna said to Peter that night, "you bad dog."

"Peter was the father of those pups," the good Anna explained to Miss Mathilda, "and they look
just like him too, and poor little Foxy, they were so big that she could hardly have them,
but Miss Mathilda, I would never let those people know that Peter was so bad."

Periods of evil thinking came very regularly to Peter and to Rags and to the visitors within
their gates. At such times Anna would be very busy and scold hard, and then too she always
took great care to seclude the bad dogs from each other whenever she had to leave the house.
Sometimes just to see how good it was that she had made them, Anna would leave the room a little
while and leave them all together, and then she would suddenly come back. Back would slink
all the wicked-minded dogs at the sound of her hand upon the knob, and then they would sit
desolate in their corners like a lot of disappointed children whose stolen sugar has been taken
from them.

Innocent blind old Baby was the only one who preserved the dignity becoming in a dog.

You see that Anna led an arduous and troubled life.

The good Anna was a small, spare, german woman, at this time about forty years of age. Her
face was worn, her cheeks were thin, her mouth drawn and firm, and her light blue eyes were
very bright. Sometimes they were full of lightning and sometimes full of humor, but they were
always sharp and clear.

Her voice was a pleasant one, when she told the histories of bad Peter and of Baby and of little
Rags. Her voice was a high and piercing one when she called to the teamsters and to the other
wicked men, what she wanted that should come to them, when she saw them beat a horse or kick
a dog. She did not belong to any society that could stop them and she told them so most frankly,
but her strained voice and her glittering eyes, and her queer piercing german english first
made them afraid and then ashamed. They all knew too, that all the policemen on the beat were
her friends. These always respected and obeyed Miss Annie, as they called her, and promptly
attended to all of her complaints.

For five years Anna managed the little house for Miss Mathilda. In these five years there were
four different under servants.

The one that came first was a pretty, cheerful irish girl. Anna took her with a doubting mind.
Lizzie was an obedient, happy servant, and Anna began to have a little faith. This was not
for long. The pretty, cheerful Lizzie disappeared one day without her notice and with all her
baggage and returned no more.

This pretty, cheerful Lizzie was succeeded by a melancholy Molly.

Molly was born in America, of german parents. All her people had been long dead or gone away.
Molly had always been alone. She was a tall, dark, sallow, thin-haired creature, and she was
always troubled with a cough, and she had a bad temper, and always said ugly dreadful swear words.

Anna found all this very hard to bear, but she kept Molly a long time out of kindness. The
kitchen was constantly a battle-ground. Anna scolded and Molly swore strange oaths, and then
Miss Mathilda would shut her door hard to show that she could hear it all.

At last Anna had to give it up. "Please Miss Mathilda won't you speak to Molly," Anna said,
"I can't do a thing with her. I scold her, and she don't seem to hear and then she swears so
that she scares me. She loves you Miss Mathilda, and you scold her please once."

"But Anna," cried poor Miss Mathilda, "I don't want to," and that large, cheerful, but faint
hearted woman looked all aghast at such a prospect. "But you must, please Miss Mathilda!" Anna
said.

Miss Mathilda never wanted to do any scolding. "But you must please Miss Mathilda," Anna said.

Miss Mathilda every day put off the scolding, hoping always that Anna would learn to manage
Molly better. It never did get better and at last Miss Mathilda saw that the scolding simply
had to be.

It was agreed between the good Anna and her Miss Mathilda that Anna should be away when Molly
would be scolded. The next evening that it was Anna's evening out, Miss Mathilda faced her
task and went down into the kitchen.

Molly was sitting in the little kitchen leaning her elbows on the table. She was a tall, thin,
sallow girl, aged twenty-three, by nature slatternly and careless but trained by Anna into
superficial neatness. Her drab striped cotton dress and gray black checked apron increased
the length and sadness of her melancholy figure. "Oh, Lord!" groaned Miss Mathilda to herself
as she approached her.

"Molly, I want to speak to you about your behaviour to Anna!", here Molly dropped her head
still lower on her arms and began to cry.

"Oh! Oh!" groaned Miss Mathilda.

"It's all Miss Annie's fault, all of it," Molly said at last, in a trembling voice, "I do my best."

"I know Anna is often hard to please," began Miss Mathilda, with a twinge of mischief, and
then she sobered herself to her task, "but you must remember, Molly, she means it for your
good and she is really very kind to you."

"I don't want her kindness," Molly cried, "I wish you would tell me what to do, Miss Mathilda,
and then I would be all right. I hate Miss Annie."

"This will never do Molly," Miss Mathilda said sternly, in her deepest, firmest tones, "Anna
is the head of the kitchen and you must either obey her or leave."

"I don't want to leave you," whimpered melancholy Molly. "Well Molly then try and do better,"
answered Miss Mathilda, keeping a good stern front, and backing quickly from the kitchen.

"Oh! Oh!" groaned Miss Mathilda, as she went back up the stairs.

Miss Mathilda's attempt to make peace between the constantly contending women in the kitchen
had no real effect. They were very soon as bitter as before.

At last it was decided that Molly was to go away. Molly went away to work in a factory in the
town, and she went to live with an old woman in the slums, a very bad old woman Anna said.

Anna was never easy in her mind about the fate of Molly. Sometimes she would see or hear of
her. Molly was not well, her cough was worse, and the old woman really was a bad one.

After a year of this unwholesome life, Molly was completely broken down. Anna then again took
her in charge. She brought her from her work and from the woman where she lived, and put her
in a hospital to stay till she was well. She found a place for her as nursemaid to a little
girl out in the country, and Molly was at last established and content.

Molly had had, at first, no regular successor. In a few months it was going to be the summer
and Miss Mathilda would be gone away, and old Katie would do very well to come in every day
and help Anna with her work.

Old Katy was a heavy, ugly, short and rough old german woman, with a strange distorted german-english
all her own. Anna was worn out now with her attempt to make the younger generation do all that
it should and rough old Katy never answered back, and never wanted her own way. No scolding
or abuse could make its mark on her uncouth and aged peasant hide. She said her "Yes, Miss
Annie," when an answer had to come, and that was always all that she could say.

"Old Katy is just a rough old woman, Miss Mathilda," Anna said, "but I think I keep her here
with me. She can work and she don't give me trouble like I had with Molly all the time."

Anna always had a humorous sense from this old Katy's twisted peasant english, from the roughness
on her tongue of buzzing s's and from the queer ways of her brutish servile humor. Anna could
not let old Katy serve at table--old Katy was too coarsely made from natural earth for that--and
so Anna had all this to do herself and that she never liked, but even then this simple rough
old creature was pleasanter to her than any of the upstart young.

Life went on very smoothly now in these few months before the summer came. Miss Mathilda every
summer went away across the ocean to be gone for several months. When she went away this summer
old Katy was so sorry, and on the day that Miss Mathilda went, old Katy cried hard for many
hours. An earthy, uncouth, servile peasant creature old Katy surely was. She stood there on
the white stone steps of the little red brick house, with her bony, square dull head with its
thin, tanned, toughened skin and its sparse and kinky grizzled hair, and her strong, squat
figure a little overmade on the right side, clothed in her blue striped cotton dress, all clean
and always washed but rough and harsh to see--and she stayed there on the steps till Anna brought
her in, blubbering, her apron to her face, and making queer guttural broken moans.

When Miss Mathilda early in the fall came to her house again old Katy was not there.

"I never thought old Katy would act so Miss Mathilda," Anna said, "when she was so sorry when
you went away, and I gave her full wages all the summer, but they are all alike Miss Mathilda,
there isn't one of them that's fit to trust. You know how Katy said she liked you, Miss Mathilda,
and went on about it when you went away and then she was so good and worked all right until
the middle of the summer, when I got sick, and then she went away and left me all alone and
took a place out in the country, where they gave her some more money. She didn't say a word,
Miss Mathilda, she just went off and left me there alone when I was sick after that awful hot
summer that we had, and after all we done for her when she had no place to go, and all summer
I gave her better things to eat than I had for myself. Miss Mathilda, there isn't one of them
has any sense of what's the right way for a girl to do, not one of them."

Old Katy was never heard from any more.

No under servant was decided upon now for several months. Many came and many went, and none
of them would do. At last Anna heard of Sallie.

Sallie was the oldest girl in a family of eleven and Sallie was just sixteen years old. From
Sallie down they came always littler and littler in her family, and all of them were always
out at work excepting only the few littlest of them all.

Sallie was a pretty blonde and smiling german girl, and stupid and a little silly. The littler
they came in her family the brighter they all were. The brightest of them all was a little
girl of ten. She did a good day's work washing dishes for a man and wife in a saloon, and she
earned a fair day's wage, and then there was one littler still. She only worked for half the
day. She did the house work for a bachelor doctor. She did it all, all of the housework and
received each week her eight cents for her wage. Anna was always indignant when she told that
story.

"I think he ought to give her ten cents Miss Mathilda any way. Eight cents is so mean when
she does all his work and she is such a bright little thing too, not stupid like our Sallie.
Sallie would never learn to do a thing if I didn't scold her all the time, but Sallie is a
good girl, and I take care and she will do all right."

Sallie was a good, obedient german child. She never answered Anna back, no more did Peter,
old Baby and little Rags and so though always Anna's voice was sharply raised in strong rebuke
and worn expostulation, they were a happy family all there together in the kitchen.

Anna was a mother now to Sallie, a good incessant german mother who watched and scolded hard
to keep the girl from any evil step. Sallie's temptations and transgressions were much like
those of naughty Peter and jolly little Rags, and Anna took the same way to keep all three
from doing what was bad.

Sallie's chief badness besides forgetting all the time and never washing her hands clean to
serve at table, was the butcher boy.

He was an unattractive youth enough, that butcher boy. Suspicion began to close in around Sallie
that she spent the evenings when Anna was away, in company with this bad boy.

"Sallie is such a pretty girl, Miss Mathilda," Anna said, "and she is so dumb and silly, and
she puts on that red waist, and she crinkles up her hair with irons so I have to laugh, and
then I tell her if she only washed her hands clean it would be better than all that fixing
all the time, but you can't do a thing with the young girls nowadays Miss Mathilda. Sallie
is a good girl but I got to watch her all the time."

Suspicion closed in around Sallie more and more, that she spent Anna's evenings out with this
boy sitting in the kitchen. One early morning Anna's voice was sharply raised.

"Sallie this ain't the same banana that I brought home yesterday, for Miss Mathilda, for her
breakfast, and you was out early in the street this morning, what was you doing there?"

"Nothing, Miss Annie, I just went out to see, that's all and that's the same banana, 'deed
it is Miss Annie."

"Sallie, how can you say so and after all I do for you, and Miss Mathilda is so good to you.
I never brought home no bananas yesterday with specks on it like that. I know better, it was
that boy was here last night and ate it while I was away, and you was out to get another this
morning. I don't want no lying Sallie."

Sallie was stout in her defence but then she gave it up and she said it was the boy who snatched
it as he ran away at the sound of Anna's key opening the outside door. "But I will never let
him in again, Miss Annie, 'deed I won't," said Sallie.

And now it was all peaceful for some weeks and then Sallie with fatuous simplicity began on
certain evenings to resume her bright red waist, her bits of jewels and her crinkly hair.

One pleasant evening in the early spring, Miss Mathilda was standing on the steps beside the
open door, feeling cheerful in the pleasant, gentle night. Anna came down the street, returning
from her evening out. "Don't shut the door, please, Miss Mathilda," Anna said in a low voice,
"I don't want Sallie to know I'm home."

Anna went softly through the house and reached the kitchen door. At the sound of her hand upon
the knob there was a wild scramble and a bang, and then Sallie sitting there alone when Anna
came into the room, but, alas, the butcher boy forgot his overcoat in his escape.

You see that Anna led an arduous and troubled life.

Anna had her troubles, too, with Miss Mathilda. "And I slave and slave to save the money and
you go out and spend it all on foolishness," the good Anna would complain when her mistress,
a large and careless woman, would come home with a bit of porcelain, a new etching and sometimes
even an oil painting on her arm.

"But Anna," argued Miss Mathilda, "if you didn't save this money, don't you see I could not
buy these things," and then Anna would soften and look pleased until she learned the price,
and then wringing her hands, "Oh, Miss Mathilda, Miss Mathilda," she would cry, "and you gave
all that money out for that, when you need a dress to go out in so bad." "Well, perhaps I will
get one for myself next year, Anna," Miss Mathilda would cheerfully concede. "If we live till
then Miss Mathilda, I see that you do," Anna would then answer darkly.

Anna had great pride in the knowledge and possessions of her cherished Miss Mathilda, but she
did not like her careless way of wearing always her old clothes. "You can't go out to dinner
in that dress, Miss Mathilda," she would say, standing firmly before the outside door, "You
got to go and put on your new dress you always look so nice in." "But Anna, there isn't time."
"Yes there is, I go up and help you fix it, please Miss Mathilda you can't go out to dinner
in that dress and next year if we live till then, I make you get a new hat, too. It's a shame
Miss Mathilda to go out like that."

The poor mistress sighed and had to yield. It suited her cheerful, lazy temper to be always
without care but sometimes it was a burden to endure, for so often she had it all to do again
unless she made a rapid dash out of the door before Anna had a chance to see.

Life was very easy always for this large and lazy Miss Mathilda, with the good Anna to watch
and care for her and all her clothes and goods. But, alas, this world of ours is after all
much what it should be and cheerful Miss Mathilda had her troubles too with Anna.

It was pleasant that everything for one was done, but annoying often that what one wanted most
just then, one could not have when one had foolishly demanded and not suggested one's desire.
And then Miss Mathilda loved to go out on joyous, country tramps when, stretching free and
far with cheerful comrades, over rolling hills and cornfields, glorious in the setting sun,
and dogwood white and shining underneath the moon and clear stars over head, and brilliant
air and tingling blood, it was hard to have to think of Anna's anger at the late return, though
Miss Mathilda had begged that there might be no hot supper cooked that night. And then when
all the happy crew of Miss Mathilda and her friends, tired with fullness of good health and
burning winds and glowing sunshine in the eyes, stiffened and justly worn and wholly ripe for
pleasant food and gentle content, were all come together to the little house--it was hard for
all that tired crew who loved the good things Anna made to eat, to come to the closed door
and wonder there if it was Anna's evening in or out, and then the others must wait shivering
on their tired feet, while Miss Mathilda softened Anna's heart, or if Anna was well out, boldly
ordered youthful Sallie to feed all the hungry lot.

Such things were sometimes hard to bear and often grievously did Miss Mathilda feel herself
a rebel with the cheerful Lizzies, the melancholy Mollies, the rough old Katies and the stupid
Sallies.

Miss Mathilda had other troubles too, with the good Anna. Miss Mathilda had to save her Anna
from the many friends, who in the kindly fashion of the poor, used up her savings and then
gave her promises in place of payments.

The good Anna had many curious friends that she had found in the twenty years that she had
lived in Bridgepoint, and Miss Mathilda would often have to save her from them all.

Part II

THE LIFE OF THE GOOD ANNA

Anna Federner, this good Anna, was of solid lower middle-class south german stock.

When she was seventeen years old she went to service in a bourgeois family, in the large city
near her native town, but she did not stay there long. One day her mistress offered her maid--that
was Anna--to a friend, to see her home. Anna felt herself to be a servant, not a maid, and
so she promptly left the place.

Anna had always a firm old world sense of what was the right way for a girl to do.

No argument could bring her to sit an evening in the empty parlour, although the smell of paint
when they were fixing up the kitchen made her very sick, and tired as she always was, she never
would sit down during the long talks she held with Miss Mathilda. A girl was a girl and should
act always like a girl, both as to giving all respect and as to what she had to eat.

A little time after she left this service, Anna and her mother made the voyage to America.
They came second-class, but it was for them a long and dreary journey. The mother was already
ill with consumption.

They landed in a pleasant town in the far South and there the mother slowly died.

Anna was now alone and she made her way to Bridgepoint where an older half brother was already
settled. This brother was a heavy, lumbering, good natured german man, full of the infirmity
that comes of excess of body.

He was a baker and married and fairly well to do.

Anna liked her brother well enough but was never in any way dependent on him.

When she arrived in Bridgepoint, she took service with Miss Mary Wadsmith.

Miss Mary Wadsmith was a large, fair, helpless woman, burdened with the care of two young children.
They had been left her by her brother and his wife who had died within a few months of each other.

Anna soon had the household altogether in her charge.

Anna found her place with large, abundant women, for such were always lazy, careless or all
helpless, and so the burden of their lives could fall on Anna, and give her just content. Anna's
superiors must be always these large helpless women, or be men, for none others could give
themselves to be made so comfortable and free.

Anna had no strong natural feeling to love children, as she had to love cats and dogs, and
a large mistress. She never became deeply fond of Edgar and Jane Wadsmith. She naturally preferred
the boy, for boys love always better to be done for and made comfortable and full of eating,
while in the little girl she had to meet the feminine, the subtle opposition, showing so early
always in a young girl's nature.

For the summer, the Wadsmiths had a pleasant house out in the country, and the winter months
they spent in hotel apartments in the city.

Gradually it came to Anna to take the whole direction of their movements, to make all the decisions
as to their journeyings to and fro, and for the arranging of the places where they were to live.

Anna had been with Miss Mary for three years, when little Jane began to raise her strength
in opposition. Jane was a neat, pleasant little girl, pretty and sweet with a young girl's
charm, and with two blonde braids carefully plaited down her back.

Miss Mary, like her Anna, had no strong natural feeling to love children, but she was fond
of these two young ones of her blood, and yielded docilely to the stronger power in the really
pleasing little girl. Anna always preferred the rougher handling of the boy, while Miss Mary
found the gentle force and the sweet domination of the girl to please her better.

In a spring when all the preparations for the moving had been made, Miss Mary and Jane went
together to the country home, and Anna, after finishing up the city matters was to follow them
in a few days with Edgar, whose vacation had not yet begun.

Many times during the preparations for this summer, Jane had met Anna with sharp resistance,
in opposition to her ways. It was simple for little Jane to give unpleasant orders, not from
herself but from Miss Mary, large, docile, helpless Miss Mary Wadsmith who could never think
out any orders to give Anna from herself.

Anna's eyes grew slowly sharper, harder, and her lower teeth thrust a little forward and pressing
strongly up, framed always more slowly the "Yes, Miss Jane," to the quick, "Oh Anna! Miss Mary
says she wants you to do it so!"

On the day of their migration, Miss Mary had been already put into the carriage. "Oh, Anna!"
cried little Jane running back into the house, "Miss Mary says that you are to bring along
the blue dressings out of her room and mine." Anna's body stiffened, "We never use them in
the summer, Miss Jane," she said thickly. "Yes Anna, but Miss Mary thinks it would be nice,
and she told me to tell you not to forget, good-by!" and the little girl skipped lightly down
the steps into the carriage and they drove away.

Anna stood still on the steps, her eyes hard and sharp and shining, and her body and her face
stiff with resentment. And then she went into the house, giving the door a shattering slam.

Anna was very hard to live with in those next three days. Even Baby, the new puppy, the pride
of Anna's heart, a present from her friend the widow, Mrs. Lehntman--even this pretty little
black and tan felt the heat of Anna's scorching flame. And Edgar, who had looked forward to
these days, to be for him filled full of freedom and of things to eat--he could not rest a
moment in Anna's bitter sight.

On the third day, Anna and Edgar went to the Wadsmith country home. The blue dressings out
of the two rooms remained behind.

All the way, Edgar sat in front with the colored man and drove. It was an early spring day
in the South. The fields and woods were heavy from the soaking rains. The horses dragged the
carriage slowly over the long road, sticky with brown clay and rough with masses of stones
thrown here and there to be broken and trodden into place by passing teams. Over and through
the soaking earth was the feathery new spring growth of little flowers, of young leaves and
of ferns. The tree tops were all bright with reds and yellows, with brilliant gleaming whites
and gorgeous greens. All the lower air was full of the damp haze rising from heavy soaking
water on the earth, mingled with a warm and pleasant smell from the blue smoke of the spring
fires in all the open fields. And above all this was the clear, upper air, and the songs of
birds and the joy of sunshine and of lengthening days.

The languor and the stir, the warmth and weight and the strong feel of life from the deep centres
of the earth that comes always with the early, soaking spring, when it is not answered with
an active fervent joy, gives always anger, irritation and unrest.

To Anna alone there in the carriage, drawing always nearer to the struggle with her mistress,
the warmth, the slowness, the jolting over stones, the steaming from the horses, the cries
of men and animals and birds, and the new life all round about were simply maddening. "Baby!
if you don't lie still, I think I kill you. I can't stand it any more like this."

At this time Anna, about twenty-seven years of age, was not yet all thin and worn. The sharp
bony edges and corners of her head and face were still rounded out with flesh, but already
the temper and the humor showed sharply in her clean blue eyes, and the thinning was begun
about the lower jaw, that was so often strained with the upward pressure of resolve.

To-day, alone there in the carriage, she was all stiff and yet all trembling with the sore
effort of decision and revolt.

As the carriage turned into the Wadsmith gate, little Jane ran out to see. She just looked
at Anna's face; she did not say a word about blue dressings.

Anna got down from the carriage with little Baby in her arms. She took out all the goods that
she had brought and the carriage drove away. Anna left everything on the porch, and went in
to where Miss Mary Wadsmith was sitting by the fire.

Miss Mary was sitting in a large armchair by the fire. All the nooks and crannies of the chair
were filled full of her soft and spreading body. She was dressed in a black satin morning gown,
the sleeves, great monster things, were heavy with the mass of her soft flesh. She sat there
always, large, helpless, gentle. She had a fair, soft, regular, good-looking face, with pleasant,
empty, grey-blue eyes, and heavy sleepy lids.

Behind Miss Mary was the little Jane, nervous and jerky with excitement as she saw Anna come
into the room.

"Miss Mary," Anna began. She had stopped just within the door, her body and her face stiff
with repression, her teeth closed hard and the white lights flashing sharply in the pale, clean
blue of her eyes. Her bearing was full of the strange coquetry of anger and of fear, the stiffness,
the bridling, the suggestive movement underneath the rigidness of forced control, all the queer
ways the passions have to show themselves all one.

"Miss Mary," the words came slowly with thick utterance and with jerks, but always firm and
strong. "Miss Mary, I can't stand it any more like this. When you tell me anything to do, I
do it. I do everything I can and you know I work myself sick for you. The blue dressings in
your room makes too much work to have for summer. Miss Jane don't know what work is. If you
want to do things like that I go away."

Anna stopped still. Her words had not the strength of meaning they were meant to have, but
the power in the mood of Anna's soul frightened and awed Miss Mary through and through.

Like in all large and helpless women, Miss Mary's heart beat weakly in the soft and helpless
mass it had to govern. Little Jane's excitements had already tried her strength. Now she grew
pale and fainted quite away.

"Miss Mary!" cried Anna running to her mistress and supporting all her helpless weight back
in the chair. Little Jane, distracted, flew about as Anna ordered, bringing smelling salts
and brandy and vinegar and water and chafing poor Miss Mary's wrists.

Miss Mary slowly opened her mild eyes. Anna sent the weeping little Jane out of the room. She
herself managed to get Miss Mary quiet on the couch.

There was never a word more said about blue dressings.

Anna had conquered, and a few days later little Jane gave her a green parrot to make peace.

For six more years little Jane and Anna lived in the same house. They were careful and respectful
to each other to the end.

Anna liked the parrot very well. She was fond of cats too and of horses, but best of all animals
she loved the dog and best of all dogs, little Baby, the first gift from her friend, the widow
Mrs. Lehntman.

The widow Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in Anna's life.

Anna met her first at the house of her half brother, the baker, who had known the late Mr.
Lehntman, a small grocer, very well.

Mrs. Lehntman had been for many years a midwife. Since her husband's death she had herself
and two young children to support.

Mrs. Lehntman was a good looking woman. She had a plump well rounded body, clear olive skin,
bright dark eyes and crisp black curling hair. She was pleasant, magnetic, efficient and good.
She was very attractive, very generous and very amiable.

She was a few years older than our good Anna, who was soon entirely subdued by her magnetic,
sympathetic charm.

Mrs. Lehntman in her work loved best to deliver young girls who were in trouble. She would
take these into her own house and care for them in secret, till they could guiltlessly go home
or back to work, and then slowly pay her the money for their care. And so through this new
friend Anna led a wider and more entertaining life, and often she used up her savings in helping
Mrs. Lehntman through those times when she was giving very much more than she got.

It was through Mrs. Lehntman that Anna met Dr. Shonjen who employed her when at last it had
to be that she must go away from her Miss Mary Wadsmith.

During the last years with her Miss Mary, Anna's health was very bad, as indeed it always was
from that time on until the end of her strong life.

Anna was a medium sized, thin, hard working, worrying woman.

She had always had bad headaches and now they came more often and more wearing.

Her face grew thin, more bony and more worn, her skin stained itself pale yellow, as it does
with working sickly women, and the clear blue of her eyes went pale.

Her back troubled her a good deal, too. She was always tired at her work and her temper grew
more difficult and fretful.

Miss Mary Wadsmith often tried to make Anna see a little to herself, and get a doctor, and
the little Jane, now blossoming into a pretty, sweet young woman, did her best to make Anna
do things for her good. Anna was stubborn always to Miss Jane, and fearful of interference
in her ways. Miss Mary Wadsmith's mild advice she easily could always turn aside.

Mrs. Lehntman was the only one who had any power over Anna. She induced her to let Dr. Shonjen
take her in his care.

No one but a Dr. Shonjen could have brought a good and german Anna first to stop her work and
then submit herself to operation, but he knew so well how to deal with german and poor people.
Cheery, jovial, hearty, full of jokes that made much fun and yet were full of simple common
sense and reasoning courage, he could persuade even a good Anna to do things that were for
her own good.

Edgar had now been for some years away from home, first at a school and then at work to prepare
himself to be a civil engineer. Miss Mary and Jane promised to take a trip for all the time
that Anna was away, and so there would be no need for Anna's work, nor for a new girl to take
Anna's place.

Anna's mind was thus a little set at rest. She gave herself to Mrs. Lehntman and the doctor
to do what they thought best to make her well and strong.

Anna endured the operation very well, and was patient, almost docile, in the slow recovery
of her working strength. But when she was once more at work for her Miss Mary Wadsmith, all
the good effect of these several months of rest were soon worked and worried well away.

For all the rest of her strong working life Anna was never really well. She had bad headaches
all the time and she was always thin and worn.

She worked away her appetite, her health and strength, and always for the sake of those who
begged her not to work so hard. To her thinking, in her stubborn, faithful, german soul, this
was the right way for a girl to do.

Anna's life with Miss Mary Wadsmith was now drawing to an end.

Miss Jane, now altogether a young lady, had come out into the world. Soon she would become
engaged and then be married, and then perhaps Miss Mary Wadsmith would make her home with her.

In such a household Anna was certain that she would never take a place. Miss Jane was always
careful and respectful and very good to Anna, but never could Anna be a girl in a household
where Miss Jane would be the head. This much was very certain in her mind, and so these last
two years with her Miss Mary were not as happy as before.

The change came very soon.

Miss Jane became engaged and in a few months was to marry a man from out of town, from Curden,
an hour's railway ride from Bridgepoint.

Poor Miss Mary Wadsmith did not know the strong resolve Anna had made to live apart from her
when this new household should be formed. Anna found it very hard to speak to her Miss Mary
of this change.

The preparations for the wedding went on day and night.

Anna worked and sewed hard to make it all go well.

Miss Mary was much fluttered, but content and happy with Anna to make everything so easy for
them all.

Anna worked so all the time to drown her sorrow and her conscience too, for somehow it was
not right to leave Miss Mary so. But what else could she do? She could not live as her Miss
Mary's girl, in a house where Miss Jane would be the head.

The wedding day grew always nearer. At last it came and passed.

The young people went on their wedding trip, and Anna and Miss Mary were left behind to pack
up all the things.

Even yet poor Anna had not had the strength to tell Miss Mary her resolve, but now it had to be.

Anna every spare minute ran to her friend Mrs. Lehntman for comfort and advice. She begged
her friend to be with her when she told the news to Miss Mary.

Perhaps if Mrs. Lehntman had not been in Bridgepoint, Anna would have tried to live in the
new house. Mrs. Lehntman did not urge her to this thing nor even give her this advice, but
feeling for Mrs. Lehntman as she did made even faithful Anna not quite so strong in her dependence
on Miss Mary's need as she would otherwise have been.

Remember, Mrs. Lehntman was the romance in Anna's life.

All the packing was now done and in a few days Miss Mary was to go to the new house, where
the young people were ready for her coming.

At last Anna had to speak.

Mrs. Lehntman agreed to go with her and help to make the matter clear to poor Miss Mary.

The two women came together to Miss Mary Wadsmith sitting placid by the fire in the empty living
room. Miss Mary had seen Mrs. Lehntman many times before, and so her coming in with Anna raised
no suspicion in her mind.

It was very hard for the two women to begin.

It must be very gently done, this telling to Miss Mary of the change. She must not be shocked
by suddenness or with excitement.

Anna was all stiff, and inside all a quiver with shame, anxiety and grief. Even courageous
Mrs. Lehntman, efficient, impulsive and complacent as she was and not deeply concerned in the
event, felt awkward, abashed and almost guilty in that large, mild, helpless presence. And
at her side to make her feel the power of it all, was the intense conviction of poor Anna,
struggling to be unfeeling, self righteous and suppressed.

"Miss Mary"--with Anna when things had to come they came always sharp and short--"Miss Mary,
Mrs. Lehntman has come here with me, so I can tell you about not staying with you there in
Curden. Of course I go help you to get settled and then I think I come back and stay right
here in Bridgepoint. You know my brother he is here and all his family, and I think it would
be not right to go away from them so far, and you know you don't want me now so much Miss Mary
when you are all together there in Curden."

Miss Mary Wadsmith was puzzled. She did not understand what Anna meant by what she said.

"Why Anna of course you can come to see your brother whenever you like to, and I will always
pay your fare. I thought you understood all about that, and we will be very glad to have your
nieces come to stay with you as often as they like. There will always be room enough in a big
house like Mr. Goldthwaite's."

It was now for Mrs. Lehntman to begin her work.

"Miss Wadsmith does not understand just what you mean Anna," she began. "Miss Wadsmith, Anna
feels how good and kind you are, and she talks about it all the time, and what you do for her
in every way you can, and she is very grateful and never would want to go away from you, only
she thinks it would be better now that Mrs. Goldthwaite has this big new house and will want
to manage it in her own way, she thinks perhaps it would be better if Mrs. Goldthwaite had
all new servants with her to begin with, and not a girl like Anna who knew her when she was
a little girl. That is what Anna feels about it now, and she asked me and I said to her that
I thought it would be better for you all and you knew she liked you so much and that you were
so good to her, and you would understand how she thought it would be better in the new house
if she stayed on here in Bridgepoint, anyway for a little while until Mrs. Goldthwaite was
used to her new house. Isn't that it Anna that you wanted Miss Wadsmith to know?"

"Oh Anna," Miss Mary Wadsmith said it slowly and in a grieved tone of surprise that was very
hard for the good Anna to endure, "Oh Anna, I didn't think that you would ever want to leave
me after all these years."

"Miss Mary!" it came in one tense jerky burst, "Miss Mary it's only working under Miss Jane
now would make me leave you so. I know how good you are and I work myself sick for you and
for Mr. Edgar and for Miss Jane too, only Miss Jane she will want everything different from
like the way we always did, and you know Miss Mary I can't have Miss Jane watching at me all
the time, and every minute something new. Miss Mary, it would be very bad and Miss Jane don't
really want me to come with you to the new house, I know that all the time. Please Miss Mary
don't feel bad about it or think I ever want to go away from you if I could do things right
for you the way they ought to be."

Poor Miss Mary. Struggling was not a thing for her to do. Anna would surely yield if she would
struggle, but struggling was too much work and too much worry for peaceful Miss Mary to endure.
If Anna would do so she must. Poor Miss Mary Wadsmith sighed, looked wistfully at Anna and
then gave it up.

"You must do as you think best Anna," she said at last letting all of her soft self sink back
into the chair. "I am very sorry and so I am sure will be Miss Jane when she hears what you
have thought it best to do. It was very good of Mrs. Lehntman to come with you and I am sure
she does it for your good. I suppose you want to go out a little now. Come back in an hour
Anna and help me go to bed." Miss Mary closed her eyes and rested still and placid by the fire.

The two women went away.

This was the end of Anna's service with Miss Mary Wadsmith, and soon her new life taking care
of Dr. Shonjen was begun.

Keeping house for a jovial bachelor doctor gave new elements of understanding to Anna's maiden
german mind. Her habits were as firm fixed as before, but it always was with Anna that things
that had been done once with her enjoyment and consent could always happen any time again,
such as her getting up at any hour of the night to make a supper and cook hot chops and chicken
fry for Dr. Shonjen and his bachelor friends.

Anna loved to work for men, for they could eat so much and with such joy. And when they were
warm and full, they were content, and let her do whatever she thought best. Not that Anna's
conscience ever slept, for neither with interference or without would she strain less to keep
on saving every cent and working every hour of the day. But truly she loved it best when she
could scold. Now it was not only other girls and the colored man, and dogs, and cats, and horses
and her parrot, but her cheery master, jolly Dr. Shonjen, whom she could guide and constantly
rebuke to his own good.

The doctor really loved her scoldings as she loved his wickednesses and his merry joking ways.

These days were happy days with Anna.

Her freakish humor now first showed itself, her sense of fun in the queer ways that people
had, that made her later find delight in brutish servile Katy, in Sally's silly ways and in
the badness of Peter and of Rags. She loved to make sport with the skeletons the doctor had,
to make them move and make strange noises till the negro boy shook in his shoes and his eyes
rolled white in his agony of fear.

Then Anna would tell these histories to her doctor. Her worn, thin, lined, determined face
would form for itself new and humorous creases, and her pale blue eyes would kindle with humour
and with joy as her doctor burst into his hearty laugh. And the good Anna full of the coquetry
of pleasing would bridle with her angular, thin, spinster body, straining her stories and herself
to please.

These early days with jovial Dr. Shonjen were very happy days with the good Anna.

All of Anna's spare hours in these early days she spent with her friend, the widow Mrs. Lehntman.
Mrs. Lehntman lived with her two children in a small house in the same part of the town as
Dr. Shonjen. The older of these two children was a girl named Julia and was now about thirteen
years of age. This Julia Lehntman was an unattractive girl enough, harsh featured, dull and
stubborn as had been her heavy german father. Mrs. Lehntman did not trouble much with her,
but gave her always all she wanted that she had, and let the girl do as she liked. This was
not from indifference or dislike on the part of Mrs. Lehntman, it was just her usual way.

Her second child was a boy, two years younger than his sister, a bright, pleasant, cheery fellow,
who too, did what he liked with his money and his time. All this was so with Mrs. Lehntman
because she had so much in her head and in her house that clamoured for her concentration and
her time.

This slackness and neglect in the running of the house, and the indifference in this mother
for the training of her young was very hard for our good Anna to endure. Of course she did
her best to scold, to save for Mrs. Lehntman, and to put things in their place the way they
ought to be.

Even in the early days when Anna was first won by the glamour of Mrs. Lehntman's brilliancy
and charm, she had been uneasy in Mrs. Lehntman's house with a need of putting things to rights.
Now that the two children growing up were of more importance in the house, and now that long
acquaintance had brushed the dazzle out of Anna's eyes, she began to struggle to make things
go here as she thought was right.

She watched and scolded hard these days to make young Julia do the way she should. Not that
Julia Lehntman was pleasant in the good Anna's sight, but it must never be that a young girl
growing up should have no one to make her learn to do things right.

The boy was easier to scold, for scoldings never sank in very deep, and indeed he liked them
very well for they brought with them new things to eat, and lively teasing, and good jokes.

Julia, the girl, grew very sullen with it all, and very often won her point, for after all
Miss Annie was no relative of hers and had no business coming there and making trouble all
the time. Appealing to the mother was no use. It was wonderful how Mrs. Lehntman could listen
and not hear, could answer and yet not decide, could say and do what she was asked and yet
leave things as they were before.

One day it got almost too bad for even Anna's friendship to bear out.

"Well, Julia, is your mamma out?" Anna asked, one Sunday summer afternoon, as she came into
the Lehntman house.

Anna looked very well this day. She was always careful in her dress and sparing of new clothes.
She made herself always fulfill her own ideal of how a girl should look when she took her Sundays
out. Anna knew so well the kind of ugliness appropriate to each rank in life.

It was interesting to see how when she bought things for Miss Wadsmith and later for her cherished
Miss Mathilda and always entirely from her own taste and often as cheaply as she bought things
for her friends or for herself, that on the one hand she chose the things having the right
air for a member of the upper class, and for the others always the things having the awkward
ugliness that we call Dutch. She knew the best thing in each kind, and she never in the course
of her strong life compromised her sense of what was the right thing for a girl to wear.

On this bright summer Sunday afternoon she came to the Lehntmans', much dressed up in her new,
brick red, silk waist trimmed with broad black beaded braid, a dark cloth skirt and a new stiff,
shiny, black straw hat, trimmed with colored ribbons and a bird. She had on new gloves, and
a feather boa about her neck.

Her spare, thin, awkward body and her worn, pale yellow face though lit up now with the pleasant
summer sun made a queer discord with the brightness of her clothes.

She came to the Lehntman house, where she had not been for several days, and opening the door
that is always left unlatched in the houses of the lower middle class in the pleasant cities
of the South, she found Julia in the family sitting-room alone.

"Well, Julia, where is your mamma?" Anna asked. "Ma is out but come in, Miss Annie, and look
at our new brother." "What you talk so foolish for Julia," said Anna sitting down. "I ain't
talkin' foolish, Miss Annie. Didn't you know mamma has just adopted a cute, nice little baby
boy?" "You talk so crazy, Julia, you ought to know better than to say such things." Julia turned
sullen. "All right Miss Annie, you don't need to believe what I say, but the little baby is
in the kitchen and ma will tell you herself when she comes in."

It sounded most fantastic, but Julia had an air of truth and Mrs. Lehntman was capable of doing
stranger things. Anna was disturbed. "What you mean Julia," she said. "I don't mean nothin'
Miss Annie, you don't believe the baby is in there, well you can go and see it for yourself."

Anna went into the kitchen. A baby was there all right enough, and a lusty little boy he seemed.
He was very tight asleep in a basket that stood in the corner by the open door.

"You mean your mamma is just letting him stay here a little while," Anna said to Julia who
had followed her into the kitchen to see Miss Annie get real mad. "No that ain't it Miss Annie.
The mother was that girl, Lily that came from Bishop's place out in the country, and she don't
want no children, and ma liked the little boy so much, she said she'd keep him here and adopt
him for her own child."

Anna, for once, was fairly dumb with astonishment and rage. The front door slammed.

"There's ma now," cried Julia in an uneasy triumph, for she was not quite certain in her mind
which side of the question she was on.

"There's ma now, and you can ask her for yourself if I ain't told you true."

Mrs. Lehntman came into the kitchen where they were. She was bland, impersonal and pleasant,
as it was her wont to be. Still to-day, through this her usual manner that gave her such success
in her practice as a midwife, there shone an uneasy consciousness of guilt, for like all who
had to do with the good Anna, Mrs. Lehntman dreaded her firm character, her vigorous judgments
and the bitter fervour of her tongue.

It had been plain to see in the six years these women were together, how Anna gradually had
come to lead. Not really lead, of course, for Mrs. Lehntman never could be led, she was so
very devious in her ways; but Anna had come to have direction whenever she could learn what
Mrs. Lehntman meant to do before the deed was done. Now it was hard to tell which would win
out. Mrs. Lehntman had her unhearing mind and her happy way of giving a pleasant well diffused
attention, and then she had it on her side that, after all, this thing was already done.

Anna was, as usual, determined for the right. She was stiff and pale with her anger and her
fear, and nervous, and all a tremble as was her usual way when a bitter fight was near.

Mrs. Lehntman was easy and pleasant as she came into the room. Anna was stiff and silent and
very white.

"We haven't seen you for a long time, Anna," Mrs. Lehntman cordially began. "I was just gettin'
worried thinking you was sick. My! but it's a hot day to-day. Come into the sittin'-room, Anna,
and Julia will make us some ice tea."

Anna followed Mrs. Lehntman into the other room in a stiff silence, and when there she did
not, as invited, take a chair.

As always with Anna when a thing had to come it came very short and sharp. She found it hard
to breathe just now, and every word came with a jerk.

"Mrs. Lehntman, it ain't true what Julia said about your taking that Lily's boy to keep. I
told Julia when she told me she was crazy to talk so."

Anna's real excitements stopped her breath, and made her words come sharp and with a jerk.
Mrs. Lehntman's feelings spread her breath, and made her words come slow, but more pleasant
and more easy even than before.

"Why Anna," she began, "don't you see Lily couldn't keep her boy for she is working at the
Bishops' now, and he is such a cute dear little chap, and you know how fond I am of little
fellers, and I thought it would be nice for Julia and for Willie to have a little brother.
You know Julia always loves to play with babies, and I have to be away so much, and Willie
he is running in the streets every minute all the time, and you see a baby would be sort of
nice company for Julia, and you know you are always saying Anna, Julia should not be on the
streets so much and the baby will be so good to keep her in."

Anna was every minute paler with indignation and with heat.

"Mrs. Lehntman, I don't see what business it is for you to take another baby for your own,
when you can't do what's right by Julia and Willie you got here already. There's Julia, nobody
tells her a thing when I ain't here, and who is going to tell her now how to do things for
that baby? She ain't got no sense what's the right way to do with children, and you out all
the time, and you ain't got no time for your own neither, and now you want to be takin' up
with strangers. I know you was careless, Mrs. Lehntman, but I didn't think that you could do
this so. No, Mrs. Lehntman, it ain't your duty to take up with no others, when you got two
children of your own, that got to get along just any way they can, and you know you ain't got
any too much money all the time, and you are all so careless here and spend it all the time,
and Julia and Willie growin' big. It ain't right, Mrs. Lehntman, to do so."

This was as bad as it could be. Anna had never spoken her mind so to her friend before. Now
it was too harsh for Mrs. Lehntman to allow herself to really hear. If she really took the
meaning in these words she could never ask Anna to come into her house again, and she liked
Anna very well, and was used to depend on her savings and her strength. And then too Mrs. Lehntman
could not really take in harsh ideas. She was too well diffused to catch the feel of any sharp
firm edge.

Now she managed to understand all this in a way that made it easy for her to say, "Why, Anna,
I think you feel too bad about seeing what the children are doing every minute in the day.
Julia and Willie are real good, and they play with all the nicest children in the square. If
you had some, all your own, Anna, you'd see it don't do no harm to let them do a little as
they like, and Julia likes this baby so, and sweet dear little boy, it would be so kind of
bad to send him to a 'sylum now, you know it would Anna, when you like children so yourself,
and are so good to my Willie all the time. No indeed Anna, it's easy enough to say I should
send this poor, cute little boy to a 'sylum when I could keep him here so nice, but you know
Anna, you wouldn't like to do it yourself, now you really know you wouldn't, Anna, though you
talk to me so hard.--My, it's hot to-day, what you doin' with that ice tea in there Julia,
when Miss Annie is waiting all this time for her drink?"

Julia brought in the ice tea. She was so excited with the talk she had been hearing from the
kitchen, that she slopped it on the plate out of the glasses a good deal. But she was safe,
for Anna felt this trouble so deep down that she did not even see those awkward, bony hands,
adorned today with a new ring, those stupid, foolish hands that always did things the wrong way.

"Here Miss Annie," Julia said, "Here, Miss Annie, is your glass of tea, I know you like it
good and strong."

"No, Julia, I don't want no ice tea here. Your mamma ain't able to afford now using her money
upon ice tea for her friends. It ain't right she should now any more. I go out now to see Mrs.
Drehten. She does all she can, and she is sick now working so hard taking care of her own children.
I go there now. Good by Mrs. Lehntman, I hope you don't get no bad luck doin' what it ain't
right for you to do."

"My, Miss Annie is real mad now," Julia said, as the house shook, as the good Anna shut the
outside door with a concentrated shattering slam.

It was some months now that Anna had been intimate with Mrs. Drehten.

Mrs. Drehten had had a tumor and had come to Dr. Shonjen to be treated. During the course of
her visits there, she and Anna had learned to like each other very well. There was no fever
in this friendship, it was just the interchange of two hard working, worrying women, the one
large and motherly, with the pleasant, patient, soft, worn, tolerant face, that comes with
a german husband to obey, and seven solid girls and boys to bear and rear, and the other was
our good Anna with her spinster body, her firm jaw, her humorous, light, clean eyes and her
lined, worn, thin, pale yellow face.

Mrs. Drehten lived a patient, homely, hard-working life. Her husband an honest, decent man
enough, was a brewer, and somewhat given to over drinking, and so he was often surly and stingy
and unpleasant.

The family of seven children was made up of four stalwart, cheery, filial sons, and three hard
working obedient simple daughters.

It was a family life the good Anna very much approved and also she was much liked by them all.
With a german woman's feeling for the masterhood in men, she was docile to the surly father
and rarely rubbed him the wrong way. To the large, worn, patient, sickly mother she was a sympathetic
listener, wise in council and most efficient in her help. The young ones too, liked her very
well. The sons teased her all the time and roared with boisterous pleasure when she gave them
back sharp hits. The girls were all so good that her scoldings here were only in the shape
of good advice, sweetened with new trimmings for their hats, and ribbons, and sometimes on
their birthdays, bits of jewels.

It was here that Anna came for comfort after her grievous stroke at her friend the widow, Mrs.
Lehntman. Not that Anna would tell Mrs. Drehten of this trouble. She could never lay bare the
wound that came to her through this idealised affection. Her affair with Mrs. Lehntman was
too sacred and too grievous ever to be told. But here in this large household, in busy movement
and variety in strife, she could silence the uneasiness and pain of her own wound.

The Drehtens lived out in the country in one of the wooden, ugly houses that lie in groups
outside of our large cities.

The father and the sons all had their work here making beer, and the mother and her girls scoured
and sewed and cooked.

On Sundays they were all washed very clean, and smelling of kitchen soap. The sons, in their
Sunday clothes, loafed around the house or in the village, and on special days went on picnics
with their girls. The daughters in their awkward, colored finery went to church most of the
day and then walking with their friends.

They always came together for their supper, where Anna always was most welcome, the jolly Sunday
evening supper that german people love. Here Anna and the boys gave it to each other in sharp
hits and hearty boisterous laughter, the girls made things for them to eat, and waited on them
all, the mother loved all her children all the time, and the father joined in with his occasional
unpleasant word that made a bitter feeling but which they had all learned to pass as if it
were not said.

It was to the comfort of this house that Anna came that Sunday summer afternoon, after she
had left Mrs. Lehntman and her careless ways.

The Drehten house was open all about. No one was there but Mrs. Drehten resting in her rocking
chair, out in the pleasant, scented, summer air.

Anna had had a hot walk from the cars.

She went into the kitchen for a cooling drink, and then came out and sat down on the steps
near Mrs. Drehten.

Anna's anger had changed. A sadness had come to her. Now with the patient, friendly, gentle
mother talk of Mrs. Drehten, this sadness changed to resignation and to rest.

As the evening came on the young ones dropped in one by one. Soon the merry Sunday evening
supper was begun.

It had not been all comfort for our Anna, these months of knowing Mrs. Drehten. It had made
trouble for her with the family of her half brother, the fat baker.

Her half brother, the fat baker, was a queer kind of a man. He was a huge, unwieldy creature,
all puffed out all over, and no longer able to walk much, with his enormous body and the big,
swollen, bursted veins in his great legs. He did not try to walk much now. He sat around his
place, leaning on his great thick stick, and watching his workmen at their work.

On holidays, and sometimes of a Sunday, he went out in his bakery wagon. He went then to each
customer he had and gave them each a large, sweet, raisined loaf of caky bread. At every house
with many groans and gasps he would descend his heavy weight out of the wagon, his good featured,
black haired, flat, good natured face shining with oily perspiration, with pride in labor and
with generous kindness. Up each stoop he hobbled with the help of his big stick, and into the
nearest chair in the kitchen or in the parlour, as the fashion of the house demanded, and there
he sat and puffed, and then presented to the mistress or the cook the raisined german loaf
his boy supplied him.

Anna had never been a customer of his. She had always lived in another part of the town, but
he never left her out in these bakery progresses of his, and always with his own hand he gave
her her festive loaf.

Anna liked her half brother well enough. She never knew him really well, for he rarely talked
at all and least of all to women, but he seemed to her, honest, and good and kind, and he never
tried to interfere in Anna's ways. And then Anna liked the loaves of raisined bread, for in
the summer she and the second girl could live on them, and not be buying bread with the household
money all the time.

But things were not so simple with our Anna, with the other members of her half brother's house.

Her half brother's family was made up of himself, his wife, and their two daughters.

Anna never liked her brother's wife.

The youngest of the two daughters was named after her aunt Anna.

Anna never liked her half brother's wife. This woman had been very good to Anna, never interfering
in her ways, always glad to see her and to make her visits pleasant, but she had not found
favour in our good Anna's sight.

Anna had too, no real affection for her nieces. She never scolded them or tried to guide them
for their good. Anna never criticised or interfered in the running of her half brother's house.

Mrs. Federner was a good looking, prosperous woman, a little harsh and cold within her soul
perhaps, but trying always to be pleasant, good and kind. Her daughters were well trained,
quiet, obedient, well dressed girls, and yet our good Anna loved them not, nor their mother,
nor any of their ways.

It was in this house that Anna had first met her friend, the widow, Mrs. Lehntman.

The Federners had never seemed to feel it wrong in Anna, her devotion to this friend and her
care of her and of her children. Mrs. Lehntman and Anna and her feelings were all somehow too
big for their attack. But Mrs. Federner had the mind and tongue that blacken things. Not really
to blacken black, of course, but just to roughen and to rub on a little smut. She could somehow
make even the face of the Almighty seem pimply and a little coarse, and so she always did this
with her friends, though not with the intent to interfere.

This was really true with Mrs. Lehntman that Mrs. Federner did not mean to interfere, but Anna's
friendship with the Drehtens was a very different matter.

Why should Mrs. Drehten, that poor common working wife of a man who worked for others in a
brewery and who always drank too much, and was not like a thrifty, decent german man, why should
that Mrs. Drehten and her ugly, awkward daughters be getting presents from her husband's sister
all the time, and her husband always so good to Anna, and one of the girls having her name
too, and those Drehtens all strangers to her and never going to come to any good? It was not
right for Anna to do so.

Mrs. Federner knew better than to say such things straight out to her husband's fiery, stubborn
sister, but she lost no chance to let Anna feel and see what they all thought.

It was easy to blacken all the Drehtens, their poverty, the husband's drinking, the four big
sons carrying on and always lazy, the awkward, ugly daughters dressing up with Anna's help
and trying to look so fine, and the poor, weak, hard-working sickly mother, so easy to degrade
with large dosings of contemptuous pity.

Anna could not do much with these attacks for Mrs. Federner always ended with, "And you so
good to them Anna all the time. I don't see how they could get along at all if you didn't help
them all the time, but you are so good Anna, and got such a feeling heart, just like your brother,
that you give anything away you got to anybody that will ask you for it, and that's shameless
enough to take it when they ain't no relatives of yours. Poor Mrs. Drehten, she is a good woman.
Poor thing it must be awful hard for her to have to take things from strangers all the time,
and her husband spending it on drink. I was saying to Mrs. Lehntman, Anna, only yesterday,
how I never was so sorry for any one as Mrs. Drehten, and how good it was for you to help them
all the time."

All this meant a gold watch and chain to her god daughter for her birthday, the next month,
and a new silk umbrella for the elder sister. Poor Anna, and she did not love them very much,
these relatives of hers, and they were the only kin she had.

Mrs. Lehntman never joined in, in these attacks. Mrs. Lehntman was diffuse and careless in
her ways, but she never worked such things for her own ends, and she was too sure of Anna to
be jealous of her other friends.

All this time Anna was leading her happy life with Dr. Shonjen. She had every day her busy
time. She cooked and saved and sewed and scrubbed and scolded. And every night she had her
happy time, in seeing her Doctor like the fine things she bought so cheap and cooked so good
for him to eat. And then he would listen and laugh so loud, as she told him stories of what
had happened on that day.

The Doctor, too, liked it better all the time and several times in these five years he had
of his own motion raised her wages.

Anna was content with what she had and grateful for all her doctor did for her.

So Anna's serving and her giving life went on, each with its varied pleasures and its pains.

The adopting of the little boy did not put an end to Anna's friendship for the widow Mrs. Lehntman.
Neither the good Anna nor the careless Mrs. Lehntman would give each other up excepting for
the gravest cause.

Mrs. Lehntman was the only romance Anna ever knew. A certain magnetic brilliancy in person
and in manner made Mrs. Lehntman a woman other women loved. Then, too, she was generous and
good and honest, though she was so careless always in her ways. And then she trusted Anna and
liked her better than any of her other friends, and Anna always felt this very much.

No, Anna could not give up Mrs. Lehntman, and soon she was busier than before making Julia
do things right for little Johnny.

And now new schemes were working strong in Mrs. Lehntman's head, and Anna must listen to her
plans and help her make them work.

Mrs. Lehntman always loved best in her work to deliver young girls who were in trouble. She
would keep these in her house until they could go to their homes or to their work, and slowly
pay her back the money for their care.

Anna had always helped her friend to do this thing, for like all the good women of the decent
poor, she felt it hard that girls should not be helped, not girls that were really bad of course,
these she condemned and hated in her heart and with her tongue, but honest, decent, good, hard
working, foolish girls who were in trouble.

For such as these Anna always liked to give her money and her strength.

Now Mrs. Lehntman thought that it would pay to take a big house for herself to take in girls
and to do everything in a big way.

Anna did not like this plan.

Anna was never daring in her ways. Save and you will have the money you have saved, was all
that she could know.

Not that the good Anna had it so.

She saved and saved and always saved, and then here and there, to this friend and to that,
to one in her trouble and to the other in her joy, in sickness, death, and weddings, or to
make young people happy, it always went, the hard earned money she had saved.

Anna could not clearly see how Mrs. Lehntman could make a big house pay. In the small house
where she had these girls, it did not pay, and in a big house there was so much more that she
would spend.

Such things were hard for the good Anna to very clearly see. One day she came into the Lehntman
house. "Anna," Mrs. Lehntman said, "you know that nice big house on the next corner that we
saw to rent. I took it for a year just yesterday. I paid a little down you know so I could
have it sure all right and now you fix it up just like you want. I let you do just what you
like with it."

Anna knew that it was now too late. However, "But Mrs. Lehntman you said you would not take
another house, you said so just last week. Oh, Mrs. Lehntman I didn't think that you would
do this so!"

Anna knew so well it was too late.

"I know, Anna, but it was such a good house, just right you know and someone else was there
to see, and you know you said it suited very well, and if I didn't take it the others said
they would, and I wanted to ask you only there wasn't time, and really Anna, I don't need much
help, it will go so well I know. I just need a little to begin and to fix up with and that's
all Anna that I need, and I know it will go awful well. You wait Anna and you'll see, and I
let you fix it up just like you want, and you will make it look so nice, you got such sense
in all these things. It will be a good place. You see Anna if I ain't right in what I say."

Of course Anna gave the money for this thing though she could not believe that it was best.
No, it was very bad. Mrs. Lehntman could never make it pay and it would cost so much to keep.
But what could our poor Anna do? Remember Mrs. Lehntman was the only romance Anna ever knew.

Anna's strength in her control of what was done in Mrs. Lehntman's house, was not now what
it had been before that Lily's little Johnny came. That thing had been for Anna a defeat. There
had been no fighting to a finish but Mrs. Lehntman had very surely won.

Mrs. Lehntman needed Anna just as much as Anna needed Mrs. Lehntman, but Mrs. Lehntman was
more ready to risk Anna's loss, and so the good Anna grew always weaker in her power to control.

In friendship, power always has its downward curve. One's strength to manage rises always higher
until there comes a time one does not win, and though one may not really lose, still from the
time that victory is not sure, one's power slowly ceases to be strong. It is only in a close
tie such as marriage, that influence can mount and grow always stronger with the years and
never meet with a decline. It can only happen so when there is no way to escape.

Friendship goes by favour. There is always danger of a break or of a stronger power coming
in between. Influence can only be a steady march when one can surely never break away.

Anna wanted Mrs. Lehntman very much and Mrs. Lehntman needed Anna, but there were always other
ways to do and if Anna had once given up she might do so again, so why should Mrs. Lehntman
have real fear?

No, while the good Anna did not come to open fight she had been stronger. Now Mrs. Lehntman
could always hold out longer. She knew too, that Anna had a feeling heart. Anna could never
stop doing all she could for any one that really needed help. Poor Anna had no power to say no.

And then, too, Mrs. Lehntman was the only romance Anna ever knew. Romance is the ideal in one's
life and it is very lonely living with it lost.

So the good Anna gave all her savings for this place, although she knew that this was not the
right way for her friend to do.

For some time now they were all very busy fixing up the house. It swallowed all Anna's savings
fixing up this house, for when Anna once began to make it nice, she could not leave it be until
it was as good as for the purpose it should be.

Somehow it was Anna now that really took the interest in the house. Mrs. Lehntman, now the
thing was done seemed very lifeless, without interest in the house, uneasy in her mind and
restless in her ways, and more diffuse even than before in her attention. She was good and
kind to all the people in her house, and let them do whatever they thought best.

Anna did not fail to see that Mrs. Lehntman had something on her mind that was all new. What
was it that disturbed Mrs. Lehntman so? She kept on saying it was all in Anna's head. She had
no trouble now at all. Everybody was so good and it was all so nice in the new house. But surely
there was something here that was all wrong.

Anna heard a good deal of all this from her half brother's wife, the hard speaking Mrs. Federner.

Through the fog of dust and work and furnishing in the new house, and through the disturbed
mind of Mrs. Lehntman, and with the dark hints of Mrs. Federner, there loomed up to Anna's
sight a man, a new doctor that Mrs. Lehntman knew.

Anna had never met the man but she heard of him very often now. Not from her friend, the widow
Mrs. Lehntman. Anna knew that Mrs. Lehntman made of him a mystery that Anna had not the strength
just then to vigorously break down.

Mrs. Federner gave always dark suggestions and unpleasant hints. Even good Mrs. Drehten talked
of it.

Mrs. Lehntman never spoke of the new doctor more than she could help. This was most mysterious
and unpleasant and very hard for our good Anna to endure.

Anna's troubles came all of them at once.

Here in Mrs. Lehntman's house loomed up dismal and forbidding, a mysterious, perhaps an evil
man. In Dr. Shonjen's house were beginning signs of interest in the doctor in a woman.

This, too, Mrs. Federner often told to the poor Anna. The doctor surely would be married soon,
he liked so much now to go to Mr. Weingartner's house where there was a daughter who loved
Doctor, everybody knew.

In these days the living room in her half brother's house was Anna's torture chamber. And worst
of all there was so much reason for her half sister's words. The Doctor certainly did look
like marriage and Mrs. Lehntman acted very queer.

Poor Anna. Dark were these days and much she had to suffer.

The Doctor's trouble came to a head the first. It was true Doctor was engaged and to be married
soon. He told Anna so himself.

What was the good Anna now to do? Dr. Shonjen wanted her of course to stay. Anna was so sad
with all these troubles. She knew here in the Doctor's house it would be bad when he was married,
but she had not the strength now to be firm and go away. She said at last that she would try
and stay.

Doctor got married now very soon. Anna made the house all beautiful and clean and she really
hoped that she might stay. But this was not for long.

Mrs. Shonjen was a proud, unpleasant woman. She wanted constant service and attention and never
even a thank you to a servant. Soon all Doctor's old people went away. Anna went to Doctor
and explained. She told him what all the servants thought of his new wife. Anna bade him a
sad farewell and went away.

Anna was now most uncertain what to do. She could go to Curden to her Miss Mary Wadsmith who
always wrote how much she needed Anna, but Anna still dreaded Miss Jane's interfering ways.
Then too, she could not yet go away from Bridgepoint and from Mrs. Lehntman, unpleasant as
it always was now over there.

Through one of Doctor's friends Anna heard of Miss Mathilda. Anna was very doubtful about working
for a Miss Mathilda. She did not think it would be good working for a woman anymore. She had
found it very good with Miss Mary but she did not think that many women would be so.

Most women were interfering in their ways.

Anna heard that Miss Mathilda was a great big woman, not so big perhaps as her Miss Mary, still
she was big, and the good Anna liked them better so. She did not like them thin and small and
active and always looking in and always prying.

Anna could not make up her mind what was the best thing now for her to do. She could sew and
this way make a living, but she did not like such business very well.

Mrs. Lehntman urged the place with Miss Mathilda. She was sure Anna would find it better so.
The good Anna did not know.

"Well Anna," Mrs. Lehntman said, "I tell you what we do. I go with you to that woman that tells
fortunes, perhaps she tell us something that will show us what is the best way for you now to do."

It was very bad to go to a woman who tells fortunes. Anna was of strong South German Catholic
religion and the german priests in the churches always said that it was very bad to do things
so. But what else now could the good Anna do? She was so mixed and bothered in her mind, and
troubled with this life that was all wrong, though she did try so hard to do the best she knew.
"All right, Mrs. Lehntman," Anna said at last, "I think I go there now with you."

This woman who told fortunes was a medium. She had a house in the lower quarter of the town.
Mrs. Lehntman and the good Anna went to her.

The medium opened the door for them herself. She was a loose made, dusty, dowdy woman with
a persuading, conscious and embracing manner and very greasy hair.

The woman let them come into the house.

The street door opened straight into the parlor, as is the way in the small houses of the south.
The parlor had a thick and flowered carpet on the floor. The room was full of dirty things
all made by hand. Some hung upon the wall, some were on the seats and over backs of chairs
and some on tables and on those what-nots that poor people love. And everywhere were little
things that break. Many of these little things were broken and the place was stuffy and not clean.

No medium uses her parlor for her work. It is always in her eating room that she has her trances.

The eating room in all these houses is the living room in winter. It has a round table in the
centre covered with a decorated woolen cloth, that has soaked in the grease of many dinners,
for though it should be always taken off, it is easier to spread the cloth upon it than change
it for the blanket deadener that one owns. The upholstered chairs are dark and worn, and dirty.
The carpet has grown dingy with the food that's fallen from the table, the dirt that's scraped
from off the shoes, and the dust that settles with the ages. The sombre greenish colored paper
on the walls has been smoked a dismal dirty grey, and all pervading is the smell of soup made
out of onions and fat chunks of meat.

The medium brought Mrs. Lehntman and our Anna into this eating room, after she had found out
what it was they wanted. They all three sat around the table and then the medium went into
her trance.

The medium first closed her eyes and then they opened very wide and lifeless. She took a number
of deep breaths, choked several times and swallowed very hard. She waved her hand back every
now and then, and she began to speak in a monotonous slow, even tone.

"I see--I see--don't crowd so on me,--I see--I see--too many forms--don't crowd so on me--I
see--I see--you are thinking of something--you don't know whether you want to do it now. I
see--I see--don't crowd so on me--I see--I see--you are not sure,--I see--I see--a house with
trees around it,--it is dark--it is evening--I see--I see--you go in the house--I see--I see
you come out--it will be all right--you go and do it--do what you are not certain about--it
will come out all right--it is best and you should do it now."

She stopped, she made deep gulps, her eyes rolled back into her head, she swallowed hard and
then she was her former dingy and bland self again.

"Did you get what you wanted that the spirit should tell you?" the woman asked. Mrs. Lehntman
answered yes, it was just what her friend had wanted so bad to know. Anna was uneasy in this
house with superstition, with fear of her good priest, and with disgust at all the dirt and
grease, but she was most content for now she knew what it was best for her to do.

Anna paid the woman for her work and then they came away.

"There Anna didn't I tell you how it would all be? You see the spirit says so too. You must
take the place with Miss Mathilda, that is what I told you was the best thing for you to do.
We go out and see her where she lives to-night. Ain't you glad, Anna, that I took you to this
place, so you know now what you will do?"

Mrs. Lehntman and Anna went that evening to see Miss Mathilda. Miss Mathilda was staying with
a friend who lived in a house that did have trees about. Miss Mathilda was not there herself
to talk with Anna.

If it had not been that it was evening, and so dark, and that this house had trees all round
about, and that Anna found herself going in and coming out just as the woman that day said
that she would do, had it not all been just as the medium said, the good Anna would never have
taken the place with Miss Mathilda.

Anna did not see Miss Mathilda and she did not like the friend who acted in her place.

This friend was a dark, sweet, gentle little mother woman, very easy to be pleased in her own
work and very good to servants, but she felt that acting for her young friend, the careless
Miss Mathilda, she must be very careful to examine well and see that all was right and that
Anna would surely do the best she knew. She asked Anna all about her ways and her intentions
and how much she would spend, and how often she went out and whether she could wash and cook
and sew.

The good Anna set her teeth fast to endure and would hardly answer anything at all. Mrs. Lehntman
made it all go fairly well.

The good Anna was all worked up with her resentment, and Miss Mathilda's friend did not think
that she would do.

However, Miss Mathilda was willing to begin and as for Anna, she knew that the medium said
it must be so. Mrs. Lehntman, too, was sure, and said she knew that this was the best thing
for Anna now to do. So Anna sent word at last to Miss Mathilda, that if she wanted her, she
would try if it would do.

So Anna began a new life taking care of Miss Mathilda.

Anna fixed up the little red brick house where Miss Mathilda was going to live and made it
very pleasant, clean and nice. She brought over her dog, Baby, and her parrot. She hired Lizzie
for a second girl to be with her and soon they were all content. All except the parrot, for
Miss Mathilda did not like its scream. Baby was all right but not the parrot. But then Anna
never really loved the parrot, and so she gave it to the Drehten girls to keep.

Before Anna could really rest content with Miss Mathilda, she had to tell her good german priest
what it was that she had done, and how very bad it was that she had been and how she would
never do so again.

Anna really did believe with all her might. It was her fortune never to live with people who
had any faith, but then that never worried Anna. She prayed for them always as she should,
and she was very sure that they were good. The doctor loved to tease her with his doubts and
Miss Mathilda liked to do so too, but with the tolerant spirit of her church, Anna never thought
that such things were bad for them to do.

Anna found it hard to always know just why it was that things went wrong. Sometimes her glasses
broke and then she knew that she had not done her duty by the church, just in the way that
she should do.

Sometimes she was so hard at work that she would not go to mass. Something always happened
then. Anna's temper grew irritable and her ways uncertain and distraught. Everybody suffered
and then her glasses broke. That was always very bad because they cost so much to fix. Still
in a way it always ended Anna's troubles, because she knew then that all this was because she
had been bad. As long as she could scold it might be just the bad ways of all the thoughtless
careless world, but when her glasses broke that made it clear. That meant that it was she herself
who had been bad.

No, it was no use for Anna not to do the way she should, for things always then went wrong
and finally cost money to make whole, and this was the hardest thing for the good Anna to endure.

Anna almost always did her duty. She made confession and her mission whenever it was right.
Of course she did not tell the father when she deceived people for their good, or when she
wanted them to give something for a little less.

When Anna told such histories to her doctor and later to her cherished Miss Mathilda, her eyes
were always full of humor and enjoyment as she explained that she had said it so, and now she
would not have to tell the father for she had not really made a sin.

But going to a fortune teller Anna knew was really bad. That had to be told to the father just
as it was and penance had then to be done.

Anna did this and now her new life was well begun, making Miss Mathilda and the rest do just
the way they should.

Yes, taking care of Miss Mathilda were the happiest days of all the good Anna's strong hard
working life.

With Miss Mathilda Anna did it all. The clothes, the house, the hats, what she should wear
and when and what was always best for her to do. There was nothing Miss Mathilda would not
let Anna manage, and only be too glad if she would do.

Anna scolded and cooked and sewed and saved so well, that Miss Mathilda had so much to spend,
that it kept Anna still busier scolding all the time about the things she bought, that made
so much work for Anna and the other girl to do. But for all the scolding, Anna was proud almost
to bursting of her cherished Miss Mathilda with all her knowledge and her great possessions,
and the good Anna was always telling of it all to everybody that she knew.

Yes these were the happiest days of all her life with Anna, even though with her friends there
were great sorrows. But these sorrows did not hurt the good Anna now, as they had done in the
years that went before.

Miss Mathilda was not a romance in the good Anna's life, but Anna gave her so much strong affection
that it almost filled her life as full.

It was well for the good Anna that her life with Miss Mathilda was so happy, for now in these
days, Mrs. Lehntman went altogether bad. The doctor she had learned to know, was too certainly
an evil as well as a mysterious man, and he had power over the widow and midwife, Mrs. Lehntman.

Anna never saw Mrs. Lehntman at all now any more.

Mrs. Lehntman had borrowed some more money and had given Anna a note then for it all, and after
that Anna never saw her any more. Anna now stopped altogether going to the Lehntmans'. Julia,
the tall, gawky, good, blonde, stupid daughter, came often to see Anna, but she could tell
little of her mother.

It certainly did look very much as if Mrs. Lehntman had now gone altogether bad. This was a
great grief to the good Anna, but not so great a grief as it would have been had not Miss Mathilda
meant so much to her now.

Mrs. Lehntman went from bad to worse. The doctor, the mysterious and evil man, got into trouble
doing things that were not right to do.

Mrs. Lehntman was mixed up in this affair.

It was just as bad as it could be, but they managed, both the doctor and Mrs. Lehntman, finally
to come out safe.

Everybody was so sorry about Mrs. Lehntman. She had been really a good woman before she met
this doctor, and even now she certainly had not been really bad.

For several years now Anna never even saw her friend. Anna never really thought that these
people would be good, but when they did not do the way they should, and when they did not pay
her back the money she had loaned, and never seemed the better for her care, then Anna would
grow bitter with the world.

No, none of them had any sense of what was the right way for them to do. So Anna would repeat
in her despair.

The poor are generous with their things. They give always what they have, but with them to
give or to receive brings with it no feeling that they owe the giver for the gift.

Even a thrifty german Anna was ready to give all that she had saved, and so not be sure that
she would have enough to take care of herself if she fell sick, or for old age, when she could
not work. Save and you will have the money you have saved was true only for the day of saving,
even for a thrifty german Anna. There was no certain way to have it for old age, for the taking
care of what is saved can never be relied on, for it must always be in strangers' hands in
a bank or in investments by a friend.

And so when any day one might need life and help from others of the working poor, there was
no way a woman who had a little saved could say them no.

So the good Anna gave her all to friends and strangers, to children, dogs and cats, to anything
that asked or seemed to need her care.

It was in this way that Anna came to help the barber and his wife who lived around the corner,
and who somehow could never make ends meet. They worked hard, were thrifty, had no vices, but
the barber was one of them who never can make money. Whoever owed him money did not pay. Whenever
he had a chance at a good job he fell sick and could not take it. It was never his own fault
that he had trouble, but he never seemed to make things come out right.

His wife was a blonde, thin, pale, german little woman, who bore her children very hard, and
worked too soon, and then till she was sick. She too, always had things that went wrong.

They both needed constant help and patience, and the good Anna gave both to them all the time.

Another woman who needed help from the good Anna, was one who was in trouble from being good
to others.

This woman's husband's brother, who was very good, worked in a shop where there was a Bohemian,
who was getting sick with consumption. This man got so much worse he could not do his work,
but he was not so sick that he could stay in a hospital. So this woman had him living there
with her. He was not a nice man, nor was he thankful for all the woman did for him. He was
cross to her two children and made a great mess always in her house. The doctor said he must
have many things to eat, and the woman and the brother of the husband got them for him.

There was no friendship, no affection, no liking even for the man this woman cared for, no
claim of common country or of kin, but in the kindly fashion of the poor this woman gave her
all and made her house a nasty place, and for a man who was not even grateful for the gift.

Then, of course, the woman herself got into trouble. Her husband's brother was now married.
Her husband lost his job. She did not have the money for the rent. It was the good Anna's savings
that were handy.

So it went on. Sometimes a little girl, sometimes a big one was in trouble and Anna heard of
them and helped them to find places.

Stray dogs and cats Anna always kept until she found them homes. She was always careful to
learn whether these people would be good to animals.

Out of the whole collection of stray creatures, it was the young Peter and the jolly little
Rags, Anna could not find it in her heart to part with. These became part of the household
of the good Anna's Miss Mathilda.

Peter was a very useless creature, a foolish, silly, cherished, coward male. It was wild to
see him rush up and down in the back yard, barking and bouncing at the wall, when there was
some dog out beyond, but when the very littlest one there was got inside of the fence and only
looked at Peter, Peter would retire to his Anna and blot himself out between her skirts.

When Peter was left downstairs alone, he howled. "I am all alone," he wailed, and then the
good Anna would have to come and fetch him up. Once when Anna stayed a few nights in a house
not far away, she had to carry Peter all the way, for Peter was afraid when he found himself
on the street outside his house. Peter was a good sized creature and he sat there and he howled,
and the good Anna carried him all the way in her own arms. He was a coward was this Peter,
but he had kindly, gentle eyes and a pretty collie head, and his fur was very thick and white
and nice when he was washed. And then Peter never strayed away, and he looked out of his nice
eyes and he liked it when you rubbed him down, and he forgot you when you went away, and he
barked whenever there was any noise.

When he was a little pup he had one night been put into the yard and that was all of his origin
she knew. The good Anna loved him well and spoiled him as a good german mother always does her son.

Little Rags was very different in his nature. He was a lively creature made out of ends of
things, all fluffy and dust color, and he was always bounding up into the air and darting all
about over and then under silly Peter and often straight into solemn fat, blind, sleepy Baby,
and then in a wild rush after some stray cat.

Rags was a pleasant, jolly little fellow. The good Anna liked him very well, but never with
her strength as she loved her good looking coward, foolish young man, Peter.

Baby was the dog of her past life and she held Anna with old ties of past affection. Peter
was the spoiled, good looking young man, of her middle age, and Rags was always something of
a toy. She liked him but he never struck in very deep. Rags had strayed in somehow one day
and then when no home for him was quickly found, he had just stayed right there.

It was a very happy family there all together in the kitchen, the good Anna and Sally and old
Baby and young Peter and the jolly little Rags.

The parrot had passed out of Anna's life. She had really never loved the parrot and now she
hardly thought to ask for him, even when she visited the Drehtens.

Mrs. Drehten was the friend Anna always went to, for her Sundays. She did not get advice from
Mrs. Drehten as she used to from the widow, Mrs. Lehntman, for Mrs. Drehten was a mild, worn,
unaggressive nature that never cared to influence or to lead. But they could mourn together
for the world these two worn, working german women, for its sadness and its wicked ways of
doing. Mrs. Drehten knew so well what one could suffer.

Things did not go well in these days with the Drehtens. The children were all good, but the
father with his temper and his spending kept everything from being what it should.

Poor Mrs. Drehten still had trouble with her tumor. She could hardly do any work now any more.

Mrs. Drehten was always getting worse, and now the doctor thought it would be best to take
the tumor out.

It was no longer Dr. Shonjen who treated Mrs. Drehten. They all went now to a good old german
doctor they all knew.

"You see, Miss Mathilda," Anna said, "All the old german patients don't go no more now to Doctor.
I stayed with him just so long as I could stand it, but now he is moved away up town too far
for poor people, and his wife, she holds her head up so and always is spending so much money
just for show, and so he can't take right care of us poor people any more. Poor man, he has
got always to be thinking about making money now. I am awful sorry about Doctor, Miss Mathilda,
but he neglected Mrs. Drehten shameful when she had her trouble, so now I never see him any
more. Doctor Herman is a good, plain, german doctor and he would never do things so, and Miss
Mathilda, Mrs. Drehten is coming in to-morrow to see you before she goes to the hospital for
her operation. She could not go comfortable till she had seen you first to see what you would say."

All Anna's friends reverenced the good Anna's cherished Miss Mathilda. How could they not do
so and still remain friends with the good Anna? Miss Mathilda rarely really saw them but they
were always sending flowers and words of admiration through her Anna. Every now and then Anna
would bring one of them to Miss Mathilda for advice.

It is wonderful how poor people love to take advice from people who are friendly and above
them, from people who read in books and who are good.

Miss Mathilda saw Mrs. Drehten and told her she was glad that she was going to the hospital
for operation for that surely would be best, and so good Mrs. Drehten's mind was set at rest.

Mrs. Drehten's tumor came out very well. Mrs. Drehten was afterwards never really well, but
she could do her work a little better, and be on her feet and yet not get so tired.

And so Anna's life went on, taking care of Miss Mathilda and all her clothes and goods, and
being good to every one that asked or seemed to need her help.

Now, slowly, Anna began to make it up with Mrs. Lehntman. They could never be as they had been
before. Mrs, Lehntman could never be again the romance in the good Anna's life, but they could
be friends again, and Anna could help all the Lehntmans in their need. This slowly came about.

Mrs. Lehntman had now left the evil and mysterious man who had been the cause of all her trouble.
She had given up, too, the new big house that she had taken. Since her trouble her practice
had been very quiet. Still she managed to do fairly well. She began to talk of paying the good
Anna. This, however, had not gotten very far.

Anna saw Mrs. Lehntman a good deal now. Mrs. Lehntman's crisp, black, curly hair had gotten
streaked with gray. Her dark, full, good looking face had lost its firm outline, gone flabby
and a little worn. She had grown stouter and her clothes did not look very nice. She was as
bland as ever in her ways, and as diffuse as always in her attention, but through it all there
was uneasiness and fear and uncertainty lest some danger might be near.

She never said a word of her past life to the good Anna, but it was very plain to see that
her experience had not left her easy, nor yet altogether free.

It had been hard for this good woman, for Mrs. Lehntman was really a good woman, it had been
a very hard thing for this german woman to do what everybody knew and thought was wrong. Mrs.
Lehntman was strong and she had courage, but it had been very hard to bear. Even the good Anna
did not speak to her with freedom. There always remained a mystery and a depression in Mrs.
Lehntman's affair.

And now the blonde, foolish, awkward daughter, Julia was in trouble. During the years the mother
gave her no attention, Julia kept company with a young fellow who was a clerk somewhere in
a store down in the city. He was a decent, dull young fellow, who did not make much money and
could never save it for he had an old mother he supported. He and Julia had been keeping company
for several years and now it was needful that they should be married. But then how could they
marry? He did not make enough to start them and to keep on supporting his old mother too. Julia
was not used to working much and she said, and she was stubborn, that she would not live with
Charley's dirty, cross, old mother. Mrs. Lehntman had no money. She was just beginning to get
on her feet. It was of course, the good Anna's savings that were handy.

However it paid Anna to bring about this marriage, paid her in scoldings and in managing the
dull, long, awkward Julia, and her good, patient, stupid Charley. Anna loved to buy things
cheap, and fix up a new place.

Julia and Charley were soon married and things went pretty well with them. Anna did not approve
their slack, expensive ways of doing.

"No Miss Mathilda," she would say, "The young people nowadays have no sense for saving and
putting money by so they will have something to use when they need it. There's Julia and her
Charley. I went in there the other day, Miss Mathilda, and they had a new table with a marble
top and on it they had a grand new plush album. 'Where you get that album?' I asked Julia.
'Oh, Charley he gave it to me for my birthday,' she said, and I asked her if it was paid for
and she said not all yet but it would be soon. Now I ask you what business have they Miss Mathilda,
when they ain't paid for anything they got already, what business have they to be buying new
things for her birthdays. Julia she don't do no work, she just sits around and thinks how she
can spend the money, and Charley he never puts one cent by. I never see anything like the people
nowadays Miss Mathilda, they don't seem to have any sense of being careful about money. Julia
and Charley when they have any children they won't have nothing to bring them up with right.
I said that to Julia, Miss Mathilda, when she showed me those silly things that Charley bought
her, and she just said in her silly, giggling way, perhaps they won't have any children. I
told her she ought to be ashamed of talking so, but I don't know, Miss Mathilda, the young
people nowadays have no sense at all of what's the right way for them to do, and perhaps its
better if they don't have any children, and then Miss Mathilda you know there is Mrs. Lehntman.
You know she regular adopted little Johnny just so she could pay out some more money just as
if she didn't have trouble enough taking care of her own children. No Miss Mathilda, I never
see how people can do things so. People don't seem to have no sense of right or wrong or anything
these days Miss Mathilda, they are just careless and thinking always of themselves and how
they can always have a happy time. No, Miss Mathilda I don't see how people can go on and do
things so."

The good Anna could not understand the careless and bad ways of all the world and always she
grew bitter with it all. No, not one of them had any sense of what was the right way for them
to do.

Anna's past life was now drawing to an end. Her old blind dog, Baby, was sick and like to die.
Baby had been the first gift from her friend the widow, Mrs. Lehntman in the old days when
Anna had been with Miss Mary Wadsmith, and when these two women had first come together.

Through all the years of change, Baby had stayed with the good Anna, growing old and fat and
blind and lazy. Baby had been active and a ratter when she was young, but that was so long
ago it was forgotten, and for many years now Baby had wanted only her warm basket and her dinner.

Anna in her active life found need of others, of Peter and the funny little Rags, but always
Baby was the eldest and held her with the ties of old affection. Anna was harsh when the young
ones tried to keep poor Baby out and use her basket. Baby had been blind now for some years
as dogs get, when they are no longer active. She got weak and fat and breathless and she could
not even stand long any more. Anna had always to see that she got her dinner and that the young
active ones did not deprive her.

Baby did not die with a real sickness. She just got older and more blind and coughed and then
more quiet, and then slowly one bright summer's day she died.

There is nothing more dreary than old age in animals. Somehow it is all wrong that they should
have grey hair and withered skin, and blind old eyes, and decayed and useless teeth. An old
man or an old woman almost always has some tie that seems to bind them to the younger, realer
life. They have children or the remembrance of old duties, but a dog that's old and so cut
off from all its world of struggle, is like a dreary, deathless Struldbrug, the dreary dragger
on of death through life.

And so one day old Baby died. It was dreary, more than sad, for the good Anna. She did not
want the poor old beast to linger with its weary age, and blind old eyes and dismal shaking
cough, but this death left Anna very empty. She had the foolish young man Peter, and the jolly
little Rags for comfort, but Baby had been the only one that could remember.

The good Anna wanted a real graveyard for her Baby, but this could not be in a Christian country,
and so Anna all alone took her old friend done up in decent wrappings and put her into the
ground in some quiet place that Anna knew of.

The good Anna did not weep for poor old Baby. Nay, she had not time even to feel lonely, for
with the good Anna it was sorrow upon sorrow. She was now no longer to keep house for Miss
Mathilda.

When Anna had first come to Miss Mathilda she had known that it might only be for a few years,
for Miss Mathilda was given to much wandering and often changed her home, and found new places
where she went to live. The good Anna did not then think much about this, for when she first
went to Miss Mathilda she had not thought that she would like it and so she had not worried
about staying. Then in those happy years that they had been together, Anna had made herself
forget it. This last year when she knew that it was coming she had tried hard to think it would
not happen.

"We won't talk about it now Miss Mathilda, perhaps we all be dead by then," she would say when
Miss Mathilda tried to talk it over. Or, "If we live till then Miss Mathilda, perhaps you will
be staying on right here."

No, the good Anna could not talk as if this thing were real, it was too weary to be once more
left with strangers.

Both the good Anna and her cherished Miss Mathilda tried hard to think that this would not
really happen. Anna made missions and all kinds of things to keep her Miss Mathilda and Miss
Mathilda thought out all the ways to see if the good Anna could not go with her, but neither
the missions nor the plans had much success. Miss Mathilda would go, and she was going far
away to a new country where Anna could not live, for she would be too lonesome.

There was nothing that these two could do but part. Perhaps we all be dead by then, the good
Anna would repeat, but even that did not really happen. If we all live till then Miss Mathilda,
came out truer. They all did live till then, all except poor old blind Baby, and they simply
had to part.

Poor Anna and poor Miss Mathilda. They could not look at each other that last day. Anna could
not keep herself busy working. She just went in and out and sometimes scolded.

Anna could not make up her mind what she should do now for her future. She said that she would
for a while keep this little red brick house that they had lived in. Perhaps she might just
take in a few boarders. She did not know, she would write about it later and tell it all to
Miss Mathilda.

The dreary day dragged out and then all was ready and Miss Mathilda left to take her train.
Anna stood strained and pale and dry eyed on the white stone steps of the little red brick
house that they had lived in. The last thing Miss Mathilda heard was the good Anna bidding
foolish Peter say good bye and be sure to remember Miss Mathilda.

Part III

THE DEATH OF THE GOOD ANNA

Every one who had known of Miss Mathilda wanted the good Anna now to take a place with them,
for they all knew how well Anna could take care of people and all their clothes and goods.
Anna too could always go to Curden to Miss Mary Wadsmith, but none of all these ways seemed
very good to Anna.

It was not now any longer that she wanted to stay near Mrs. Lehntman. There was no one now
that made anything important, but Anna was certain that she did not want to take a place where
she would be under some new people. No one could ever be for Anna as had been her cherished
Miss Mathilda. No one could ever again so freely let her do it all. It would be better Anna
thought in her strong strained weary body, it would be better just to keep on there in the
little red brick house that was all furnished, and make a living taking in some boarders. Miss
Mathilda had let her have the things, so it would not cost any money to begin. She could perhaps
manage to live on so. She could do all the work and do everything as she thought best, and
she was too weary with the changes to do more than she just had to, to keep living. So she
stayed on in the house where they had lived, and she found some men, she would not take in
women, who took her rooms and who were her boarders.

Things soon with Anna began to be less dreary. She was very popular with her few boarders.
They loved her scoldings and the good things she made for them to eat. They made good jokes
and laughed loud and always did whatever Anna wanted, and soon the good Anna got so that she
liked it very well. Not that she did not always long for Miss Mathilda. She hoped and waited
and was very certain that sometime, in one year or in another Miss Mathilda would come back,
and then of course would want her, and then she could take all good care of her again.

Anna kept all Miss Mathilda's things in the best order. The boarders were well scolded if they
ever made a scratch on Miss Mathilda's table.

Some of the boarders were hearty good south german fellows and Anna always made them go to
mass. One boarder was a lusty german student who was studying in Bridgepoint to be a doctor.
He was Anna's special favourite and she scolded him as she used to her old doctor so that he
always would be good. Then, too, this cheery fellow always sang when he was washing, and that
was what Miss Mathilda always used to do. Anna's heart grew warm again with this young fellow
who seemed to bring back to her everything she needed.

And so Anna's life in these days was not all unhappy. She worked and scolded, she had her stray
dogs and cats and people, who all asked and seemed to need her care, and she had hearty german
fellows who loved her scoldings and ate so much of the good things that she knew so well the
way to make.

No, the good Anna's life in these days was not all unhappy. She did not see her old friends
much, she was too busy, but once in a great while she took a Sunday afternoon and went to see
good Mrs. Drehten.

The only trouble was that Anna hardly made a living. She charged so little for her board and
gave her people such good things to eat, that she could only just make both ends meet. The
good german priest to whom she always told her troubles tried to make her have the boarders
pay a little higher, and Miss Mathilda always in her letters urged her to this thing, but the
good Anna somehow could not do it. Her boarders were nice men but she knew they did not have
much money, and then she could not raise on those who had been with her and she could not ask
the new ones to pay higher, when those who were already there were paying just what they had
paid before. So Anna let it go just as she had begun it. She worked and worked all day and
thought all night how she could save, and with all the work she just managed to keep living.
She could not make enough to lay any money by.

Anna got so little money that she had all the work to do herself. She could not pay even the
little Sally enough to keep her with her.

Not having little Sally nor having any one else working with her, made it very hard for Anna
ever to go out, for she never thought that it was right to leave a house all empty. Once in
a great while of a Sunday, Sally who was now working in a factory would come and stay in the
house for the good Anna, who would then go out and spend the afternoon with Mrs. Drehten.

No, Anna did not see her old friends much any more. She went sometimes to see her half brother
and his wife and her nieces, and they always came to her on her birthdays to give presents,
and her half brother never left her out of his festive raisined bread giving progresses. But
these relatives of hers had never meant very much to the good Anna. Anna always did her duty
by them all, and she liked her half brother very well and the loaves of raisined bread that
he supplied her were most welcome now, and Anna always gave her god daughter and her sister
handsome presents, but no one in this family had ever made a way inside to Anna's feelings.

Mrs. Lehntman she saw very rarely. It is hard to build up new on an old friendship when in
that friendship there has been bitter disillusion. They did their best, both these women to
be friends, but they were never able to again touch one another nearly. There were too many
things between them that they could not speak of, things that had never been explained nor
yet forgiven. The good Anna still did her best for foolish Julia and still every now and then
saw Mrs. Lehntman, but this family had now lost all its real hold on Anna.

Mrs. Drehten was now the best friend that Anna knew. Here there was never any more than the
mingling of their sorrows. They talked over all the time the best way for Mrs. Drehten now
to do; poor Mrs. Drehten who with her chief trouble, her bad husband, had really now no way
that she could do. She just had to work and to be patient and to love her children and be very
quiet. She always had a soothing mother influence on the good Anna who with her irritable,
strained, worn-out body would come and sit by Mrs. Drehten and talk all her troubles over.

Of all the friends that the good Anna had had in these twenty years in Bridgepoint, the good
father and patient Mrs. Drehten were the only ones that were now near to Anna and with whom
she could talk her troubles over.

Anna worked, and thought, and saved, and scolded, and took care of all the boarders, and of
Peter and of Rags, and all the others. There was never any end to Anna's effort and she grew
always more tired, more pale yellow, and in her face more thin and worn and worried. Sometimes
she went farther in not being well, and then she went to see Dr. Herman who had operated on
good Mrs. Drehten.

The things that Anna really needed were to rest sometimes and eat more so that she could get
stronger, but these were the last things that Anna could bring herself to do. Anna could never
take a rest. She must work hard through the summer as well as through the winter, else she
could never make both ends meet. The doctor gave her medicines to make her stronger but these
did not seem to do much good.

Anna grew always more tired, her headaches came oftener and harder, and she was now almost
always feeling very sick. She could not sleep much in the night. The dogs with their noises
disturbed her and everything in her body seemed to pain her.

The doctor and the good father tried often to make her give herself more care. Mrs. Drehten
told her that she surely would not get well unless for a little while she would stop working.
Anna would then promise to take care, to rest in bed a little longer and to eat more so that
she would get stronger, but really how could Anna eat when she always did the cooking and was
so tired of it all, before it was half ready for the table?

Anna's only friendship now was with good Mrs. Drehten who was too gentle and too patient to
make a stubborn faithful german Anna ever do the way she should, in the things that were for
her own good.

Anna grew worse all through this second winter. When the summer came the doctor said that she
simply could not live on so. He said she must go to his hospital and there he would operate
upon her. She would then be well and strong and able to work hard all next winter.

Anna for some time would not listen. She could not do this so, for she had her house all furnished
and she simply could not let it go. At last a woman came and said she would take care of Anna's
boarders and then Anna said that she was prepared to go.

Anna went to the hospital for her operation. Mrs. Drehten was herself not well but she came
into the city, so that some friend would be with the good Anna. Together, then, they went to
this place where the doctor had done so well by Mrs. Drehten.

In a few days they had Anna ready. Then they did the operation, and then the good Anna with
her strong, strained, worn-out body died.

Mrs. Drehten sent word of her death to Miss Mathilda.

"Dear Miss Mathilda," wrote Mrs. Drehten, "Miss Annie died in the hospital yesterday after
a hard operation. She was talking about you and Doctor and Miss Mary Wadsmith all the time.
She said she hoped you would take Peter and the little Rags to keep when you came back to America
to live. I will keep them for you here Miss Mathilda. Miss Annie died easy, Miss Mathilda,
and sent you her love."

FINIS

MELANCTHA

EACH ONE AS SHE MAY

Rose Johnson made it very hard to bring her baby to its birth.

Melanctha Herbert who was Rose Johnson's friend, did everything that any woman could. She tended
Rose, and she was patient, submissive, soothing, and untiring, while the sullen, childish,
cowardly, black Rosie grumbled and fussed and howled and made herself to be an abomination
and like a simple beast.

The child though it was healthy after it was born, did not live long. Rose Johnson was careless
and negligent and selfish, and when Melanctha had to leave for a few days, the baby died. Rose
Johnson had liked the baby well enough and perhaps she just forgot it for awhile, anyway the
child was dead and Rose and Sam her husband were very sorry but then these things came so often
in the negro world in Bridgepoint, that they neither of them thought about it very long.

Rose Johnson and Melanctha Herbert had been friends now for some years. Rose had lately married
Sam Johnson a decent honest kindly fellow, a deck hand on a coasting steamer.

Melanctha Herbert had not yet been really married.

Rose Johnson was a real black, tall, well built, sullen, stupid, childlike, good looking negress.
She laughed when she was happy and grumbled and was sullen with everything that troubled.

Rose Johnson was a real black negress but she had been brought up quite like their own child
by white folks.

Rose laughed when she was happy but she had not the wide, abandoned laughter that makes the
warm broad glow of negro sunshine. Rose was never joyous with the earth-born, boundless joy
of negroes. Hers was just ordinary, any sort of woman laughter.

Rose Johnson was careless and was lazy, but she had been brought up by white folks and she
needed decent comfort. Her white training had only made for habits, not for nature. Rose had
the simple, promiscuous immorality of the black people.

Rose Johnson and Melanctha Herbert like many of the twos with women were a curious pair to
be such friends.

Melanctha Herbert was a graceful, pale yellow, intelligent, attractive negress. She had not
been raised like Rose by white folks but then she had been half made with real white blood.

She and Rose Johnson were both of the better sort of negroes, there, in Bridgepoint.

"No, I ain't no common nigger," said Rose Johnson, "for I was raised by white folks, and Melanctha
she is so bright and learned so much in school, she ain't no common nigger either, though she
ain't got no husband to be married to like I am to Sam Johnson."

Why did the subtle, intelligent, attractive, half white girl Melanctha Herbert love and do
for and demean herself in service to this coarse, decent, sullen, ordinary, black childish
Rose, and why was this unmoral, promiscuous, shiftless Rose married, and that's not so common
either, to a good man of the negroes, while Melanctha with her white blood and attraction and
her desire for a right position had not yet been really married.

Sometimes the thought of how all her world was made, filled the complex, desiring Melanctha
with despair. She wondered, often, how she could go on living when she was so blue.

Melanctha told Rose one day how a woman whom she knew had killed herself because she was so
blue. Melanctha said, sometimes, she thought this was the best thing for her herself to do.

Rose Johnson did not see it the least bit that way.

"I don't see Melanctha why you should talk like you would kill yourself just because you're
blue. I'd never kill myself Melanctha just 'cause I was blue. I'd maybe kill somebody else
Melanctha 'cause I was blue, but I'd never kill myself. If I ever killed myself Melanctha it'd
be by accident, and if I ever killed myself by accident Melanctha, I'd be awful sorry."

Rose Johnson and Melanctha Herbert had first met, one night, at church. Rose Johnson did not
care much for religion. She had not enough emotion to be really roused by a revival. Melanctha
Herbert had not come yet to know how to use religion. She was still too complex with desire.
However, the two of them in negro fashion went very often to the negro church, along with all
their friends, and they slowly came to know each other very well.

Rose Johnson had been raised not as a servant but quite like their own child by white folks.
Her mother who had died when Rose was still a baby, had been a trusted servant in the family.
Rose was a cute, attractive, good looking little black girl and these people had no children
of their own and so they kept Rose in their house.

As Rose grew older she drifted from her white folks back to the colored people, and she gradually
no longer lived in the old house. Then it happened that these people went away to some other
town to live, and somehow Rose stayed behind in Bridgepoint. Her white folks left a little
money to take care of Rose, and this money she got every little while.

Rose now in the easy fashion of the poor lived with one woman in her house, and then for no
reason went and lived with some other woman in her house. All this time, too, Rose kept company,
and was engaged, first to this colored man and then to that, and always she made sure she was
engaged, for Rose had strong the sense of proper conduct.

"No, I ain't no common nigger just to go around with any man, nor you Melanctha shouldn't neither,"
she said one day when she was telling the complex and less sure Melanctha what was the right
way for her to do. "No Melanctha, I ain't no common nigger to do so, for I was raised by white
folks. You know very well Melanctha that I'se always been engaged to them."

And so Rose lived on, always comfortable and rather decent and very lazy and very well content.

After she had lived some time this way, Rose thought it would be nice and very good in her
position to get regularly really married. She had lately met Sam Johnson somewhere, and she
liked him and she knew he was a good man, and then he had a place where he worked every day
and got good wages. Sam Johnson liked Rose very well and he was quite ready to be married.
One day they had a grand real wedding and were married. Then with Melanctha Herbert's help
to do the sewing and the nicer work, they furnished comfortably a little red brick house. Sam
then went back to his work as deck hand on a coasting steamer, and Rose stayed home in her
house and sat and bragged to all her friends how nice it was to be married really to a husband.

Life went on very smoothly with them all the year. Rose was lazy but not dirty and Sam was
careful but not fussy, and then there was Melanctha to come in every day and help to keep things
neat.

When Rose's baby was coming to be born, Rose came to stay in the house where Melanctha Herbert
lived just then, with a big good natured colored woman who did washing.

Rose went there to stay, so that she might have the doctor from the hospital near by to help
her have the baby, and then, too, Melanctha could attend to her while she was sick.

Here the baby was born, and here it died, and then Rose went back to her house again with Sam.

Melanctha Herbert had not made her life all simple like Rose Johnson. Melanctha had not found
it easy with herself to make her wants and what she had, agree.

Melanctha Herbert was always losing what she had in wanting all the things she saw. Melanctha
was always being left when she was not leaving others.

Melanctha Herbert always loved too hard and much too often. She was always full with mystery
and subtle movements and denials and vague distrusts and complicated disillusions. Then Melanctha
would be sudden and impulsive and unbounded in some faith, and then she would suffer and be
strong in her repression.

Melanctha Herbert was always seeking rest and quiet, and always she could only find new ways
to be in trouble.

Melanctha wondered often how it was she did not kill herself when she was so blue. Often she
thought this would be really the best way for her to do.

Melanctha Herbert had been raised to be religious, by her mother. Melanctha had not liked her
mother very well. This mother, 'Mis' Herbert, as her neighbors called her, had been a sweet
appearing and dignified and pleasant, pale yellow, colored woman. 'Mis' Herbert had always
been a little wandering and mysterious and uncertain in her ways.

Melanctha was pale yellow and mysterious and a little pleasant like her mother, but the real
power in Melanctha's nature came through her robust and unpleasant and very unendurable black
father.

Melanctha's father only used to come to where Melanctha and her mother lived, once in a while.

It was many years now that Melanctha had not heard or seen or known of anything her father did.

Melanctha Herbert almost always hated her black father, but she loved very well the power in
herself that came through him. And so her feeling was really closer to her black coarse father,
than her feeling had ever been toward her pale yellow, sweet-appearing mother. The things she
had in her of her mother never made her feel respect.

Melanctha Herbert had not loved herself in childhood. All of her youth was bitter to remember.

Melanctha had not loved her father and her mother and they had found it very troublesome to
have her.

Melanctha's mother and her father had been regularly married. Melanctha's father was a big
black virile negro. He only came once in a while to where Melanctha and her mother lived, but
always that pleasant, sweet-appearing, pale yellow woman, mysterious and uncertain and wandering
in her ways, was close in sympathy and thinking to her big black virile husband.

James Herbert was a common, decent enough, colored workman, brutal and rough to his one daughter,
but then she was a most disturbing child to manage.

The young Melanctha did not love her father and her mother, and she had a break neck courage,
and a tongue that could be very nasty. Then, too, Melanctha went to school and was very quick
in all the learning, and she knew very well how to use this knowledge to annoy her parents
who knew nothing.

Melanctha Herbert had always had a break neck courage. Melanctha always loved to be with horses;
she loved to do wild things, to ride the horses and to break and tame them.

Melanctha, when she was a little girl, had had a good chance to live with horses. Near where
Melanctha and her mother lived was the stable of the Bishops, a rich family who always had
fine horses.

John, the Bishops' coachman, liked Melanctha very well and he always let her do anything she
wanted with the horses. John was a decent, vigorous mulatto with a prosperous house and wife
and children. Melanctha Herbert was older than any of his children. She was now a well grown
girl of twelve and just beginning as a woman.

James Herbert, Melanctha's father, knew this John, the Bishops' coachman very well.

One day James Herbert came to where his wife and daughter lived, and he was furious.

"Where's that Melanctha girl of yours," he said fiercely, "if she is to the Bishops' stables
again, with that man John, I swear I kill her. Why don't you see to that girl better you, you're
her mother."

James Herbert was a powerful, loose built, hard handed, black, angry negro. Herbert never was
a joyous negro. Even when he drank with other men, and he did that very, often, he was never
really joyous. In the days when he had been most young and free and open, he had never had
the wide abandoned laughter that gives the broad glow to negro sunshine.

His daughter, Melanctha Herbert, later always made a hard forced laughter. She was only strong
and sweet and in her nature when she was really deep in trouble, when she was fighting so with
all she really had, that she did not use her laughter. This was always true of poor Melanctha
who was always so certain that she hated trouble. Melanctha Herbert was always seeking peace
and quiet, and she could always only find new ways to get excited.

James Herbert was often a very angry negro. He was fierce and serious, and he was very certain
that he often had good reason to be angry with Melanctha, who knew so well how to be nasty,
and to use her learning with a father who knew nothing.

James Herbert often drank with John, the Bishops' coachman. John in his good nature sometimes
tried to soften Herbert's feeling toward Melanctha. Not that Melanctha ever complained to John
of her home life or her father. It was never Melanctha's way, even in the midst of her worst
trouble to complain to any one of what happened to her, but nevertheless somehow every one
who knew Melanctha always knew how much she suffered. It was only while one really loved Melanctha
that one understood how to forgive her, that she never once complained nor looked unhappy,
and was always handsome and in spirits, and yet one always knew how much she suffered.

The father, James Herbert, never told his troubles either, and he was so fierce and serious
that no one ever thought of asking.

'Mis' Herbert as her neighbors called her was never heard even to speak of her husband or her
daughter. She was always pleasant, sweet-appearing, mysterious and uncertain, and a little
wandering in her ways.

The Herberts were a silent family with their troubles, but somehow every one who knew them
always knew everything that happened.

The morning of one day when in the evening Herbert and the coachman John were to meet to drink
together, Melanctha had to come to the stable joyous and in the very best of humors. Her good
friend John on this morning felt very firmly how good and sweet she was and how very much she
suffered.

John was a very decent colored coachman. When he thought about Melanctha it was as if she were
the eldest of his children. Really he felt very strongly the power in her of a woman. John's
wife always liked Melanctha and she always did all she could to make things pleasant. And Melanctha
all her life loved and respected kind and good and considerate people. Melanctha always loved
and wanted peace and gentleness and goodness and all her life for herself poor Melanctha could
only find new ways to be in trouble.

This evening after John and Herbert had drunk awhile together, the good John began to tell
the father what a fine girl he had for a daughter. Perhaps the good John had been drinking
a good deal of liquor, perhaps there was a gleam of something softer than the feeling of a
friendly elder in the way John then spoke of Melanctha. There had been a good deal of drinking
and John certainly that very morning had felt strongly Melanctha's power as a woman. James
Herbert was always a fierce, suspicious, serious negro, and drinking never made him feel more
open. He looked very black and evil as he sat and listened while John grew more and more admiring
as he talked half to himself, half to the father, of the virtues and the sweetness of Melanctha.

Suddenly between them there came a moment filled full with strong black curses, and then sharp
razors flashed in the black hands, that held them flung backward in the negro fashion, and
then for some minutes there was fierce slashing.

John was a decent, pleasant, good natured, light brown negro, but he knew how to use a razor
to do bloody slashing.

When the two men were pulled apart by the other negroes who were in the room drinking, John
had not been much wounded but James Herbert had gotten one good strong cut that went from-his
right shoulder down across the front of his whole body. Razor fighting does not wound very
deeply, but it makes a cut that looks most nasty, for it is so very bloody.

Herbert was held by the other negroes until he was cleaned and plastered, and then he was put
to bed to sleep off his drink and fighting.

The next day he came to where his wife and daughter lived and he was furious.

"Where's that Melanctha, of yours?" he said to his wife, when he saw her. "If she is to the
Bishops' stables now with that yellow John, I swear I kill her. A nice way she is going for
a decent daughter. Why don't you see to that girl better you, ain't you her mother!"

Melanctha Herbert had always been old in all her ways and she knew very early how to use her
power as a woman, and yet Melanctha with all her inborn intense wisdom was really very ignorant
of evil. Melanctha had not yet come to understand what they meant, the things she so often
heard around her, and which were just beginning to stir strongly in her.

Now when her father began fiercely to assail her, she did not really know what it was that
he was so furious to force from her. In every way that he could think of in his anger, he tried
to make her say a thing she did not really know. She held out and never answered anything he
asked her, for Melanctha had a breakneck courage and she just then badly hated her black father.

When the excitement was all over, Melanctha began to know her power, the power she had so often
felt stirring within her and which she now knew she could use to make her stronger.

James Herbert did not win this fight with his daughter. After awhile he forgot it as he soon
forgot John and the cut of his sharp razor. Melanctha almost forgot to hate her father, in
her strong interest in the power she now knew she had within her.

Melanctha did not care much now, any longer, to see John or his wife or even the fine horses.
This life was too quiet and accustomed and no longer stirred her to any interest or excitement.

Melanctha now really was beginning as a woman. She was ready, and she began to search in the
streets and in dark corners to discover men and to learn their natures and their various ways
of working.

In these next years Melanctha learned many ways that lead to wisdom. She learned the ways,
and dimly in the distance she saw wisdom. These years of learning led very straight to trouble
for Melanctha, though in these years Melanctha never did or meant anything that was really wrong.

Girls who are brought up with care and watching can always find moments to escape into the
world, where they may learn the ways that lead to wisdom. For a girl raised like Melanctha
Herbert, such escape was always very simple. Often she was alone, sometimes she was with a
fellow seeker, and she strayed and stood, sometimes by railroad yards, sometimes on the docks
or around new buildings where many men were working. Then when the darkness covered everything
all over, she would begin to learn to know this man or that. She would advance, they would
respond, and then she would withdraw a little, dimly, and always she did not know what it was
that really held her. Sometimes she would almost go over, and then the strength in her of not
really knowing, would stop the average man in his endeavor. It was a strange experience of
ignorance and power and desire. Melanctha did not know what it was that she so badly wanted.
She was afraid, and yet she did not understand that here she really was a coward.

Boys had never meant much to Melanctha. They had always been too young to content her. Melanctha
had a strong respect for any kind of successful power.

In these young days, it was only men that for Melanctha held anything there was of knowledge
and power. It was not from men however that Melanctha learned to really understand this power.

From the time that Melanctha was twelve until she was sixteen she wandered, always seeking
but never more than very dimly seeing wisdom. All this time Melanctha went on with her school
learning; she went to school rather longer than do most of the colored children.

Melanctha's wanderings after wisdom she always had to do in secret and by snatches, for her
mother was then still living and 'Mis' Herbert always did some watching, and Melanctha with
all her hard courage dreaded that there should be much telling to her father, who came now
quite often to where Melanctha lived with her mother.

In these days Melanctha talked and stood and walked with many kinds of men, but she did not
learn to know any of them very deeply. They all supposed her to have world knowledge and experience.
They, believing that she knew all, told her nothing, and thinking that she was deciding with
them, asked for nothing, and so though Melanctha wandered widely, she was really very safe
with all the wandering.

It was a very wonderful experience this safety of Melanctha in these days of her attempted
learning. Melanctha herself did not feel the wonder, she only knew that for her it all had
no real value.

Melanctha all her life was very keen in her sense for real experience. She knew she was not
getting what she so badly wanted, but with all her break neck courage Melanctha here was a
coward, and so she could not learn to really understand.

Melanctha liked to wander, and to stand by the railroad yard, and watch the men and the engines
and the switches and everything that was busy there, working. Railroad yards are a ceaseless
fascination. They satisfy every kind of nature. For the lazy man whose blood flows very slowly,
it is a steady soothing world of motion which supplies him with the sense of a strong moving
power. He need not work and yet he has it very deeply; he has it even better than the man who
works in it or owns it. Then for natures that like to feel emotion without the trouble of having
any suffering, it is very nice to get the swelling in the throat, and the fullness, and the
heart beats, and all the flutter of excitement that comes as one watches the people come and
go, and hears the engine pound and give a long drawn whistle. For a child watching through
a hole in the fence above the yard, it is a wonder world of mystery and movement. The child
loves all the noise, and then it loves the silence of the wind that comes before the full rush
of the pounding train, that bursts out from the tunnel where it lost itself and all its noise
in darkness, and the child loves all the smoke, that sometimes comes in rings, and always puffs
with fire and blue color.

For Melanctha the yard was full of the excitement of many men, and perhaps a free and whirling
future.

Melanctha came here very often and watched the men and all the things that were so busy working.
The men always had time for, "Hullo sis, do you want to sit on my engine," and, "Hullo, that's
a pretty lookin' yaller girl, do you want to come and see him cookin."

All the colored porters liked Melanctha. They often told her exciting things that had happened;
how in the West they went through big tunnels where there was no air to breathe, and then out
and winding around edges of great canyons on thin high spindling trestles, and sometimes cars,
and sometimes whole trains fell from the narrow bridges, and always up from the dark places
death and all kinds of queer devils looked up and laughed in their faces. And then they would
tell how sometimes when the train went pounding down steep slippery mountains, great rocks
would racket and roll down around them, and sometimes would smash in the car and kill men;
and as the porters told these stories their round, black, shining faces would grow solemn,
and their color would go grey beneath the greasy black, and their eyes would roll white in
the fear and wonder of the things they could scare themselves by telling.

There was one, big, serious, melancholy, light brown porter who often told Melanctha stories,
for he liked the way she had of listening with intelligence and sympathetic feeling, when he
told how the white men in the far South tried to kill him because he made one of them who was
drunk and called him a damned nigger, and who refused to pay money for his chair to a nigger,
get off the train between stations. And then this porter had to give up going to that part
of the Southern country, for all the white men swore that if he ever came there again they
would surely kill him.

Melanctha liked this serious, melancholy light brown negro very well, and all her life Melanctha
wanted and respected gentleness and goodness, and this man always gave her good advice and
serious kindness, and Melanctha felt such things very deeply, but she could never let them
help her or affect her to change the ways that always made her keep herself in trouble.

Melanctha spent many of the last hours of the daylight with the porters and with other men
who worked hard, but when darkness came it was always different. Then Melanctha would find
herself with the, for her, gentlemanly classes. A clerk, or a young express agent would begin
to know her, and they would stand, or perhaps, walk a little while together.

Melanctha always made herself escape but often it was with an effort. She did not know what
it was that she so badly wanted, but with all her courage Melanctha here was a coward, and
so she could not learn to understand.

Melanctha and some man would stand in the evening and would talk together. Sometimes Melanctha
would be with another girl and then it was much easier to stay or to escape, for then they
could make way for themselves together, and by throwing words and laughter to each other, could
keep a man from getting too strong in his attention.

But when Melanctha was alone, and she was so, very often, she would sometimes come very near
to making a long step on the road that leads to wisdom. Some man would learn a good deal about
her in the talk, never altogether truly, for Melanctha all her life did not know how to tell
a story wholly. She always, and yet not with intention, managed to leave out big pieces which
make a story very different, for when it came to what had happened and what she had said and
what it was that she had really done, Melanctha never could remember right. The man would sometimes
come a little nearer, would detain her, would hold her arm or make his jokes a little clearer,
and then Melanctha would always make herself escape. The man thinking that she really had world
wisdom would not make his meaning clear, and believing that she was deciding with him he never
went so fast that he could stop her when at last she made herself escape.

And so Melanctha wandered on the edge of wisdom. "Say, Sis, why don't you when you come here
stay a little longer?" they would all ask her, and they would hold her for an answer, and she
would laugh, and sometimes she did stay longer, but always just in time she made herself escape.

Melanctha Herbert wanted very much to know and yet she feared the knowledge. As she grew older
she often stayed a good deal longer, and sometimes it was almost a balanced struggle, but she
always made herself escape.

Next to the railroad yard it was the shipping docks that Melanctha loved best when she wandered.
Often she was alone, sometimes she was with some better kind of black girl, and she would stand
a long time and watch the men working at unloading, and see the steamers do their coaling,
and she would listen with full feeling to the yowling of the free swinging negroes, as they
ran, with their powerful loose jointed bodies and their childish savage yelling, pushing, carrying,
pulling great loads from the ships to the warehouses.

The men would call out, "Say, Sis, look out or we'll come and catch yer," or "Hi, there, you
yaller girl, come here and we'll take you sailin'." And then, too, Melanctha would learn to
know some of the serious foreign sailors who told her all sorts of wonders, and a cook would
sometimes take her and her friends over a ship and show where he made his messes and where
the men slept, and where the shops were, and how everything was made by themselves, right there,
on ship board.

Melanctha loved to see these dark and smelly places. She always loved to watch and talk and
listen with men who worked hard. But it was never from these rougher people that Melanctha
tried to learn the ways that lead to wisdom. In the daylight she always liked to talk with
rough men and to listen to their lives and about their work and their various ways of doing,
but when the darkness covered everything all over, Melanctha would meet, and stand, and talk
with a clerk or a young shipping agent who had seen her watching, and so it was that she would
try to learn to understand.

And then Melanctha was fond of watching men work on new buildings. She loved to see them hoisting,
digging, sawing and stone cutting. Here, too, in the daylight, she always learned to know the
common workmen. "Heh, Sis, look out or that rock will fall on you and smash you all up into
little pieces. Do you think you would make a nice jelly?" And then they would all laugh and
feel that their jokes were very funny. And "Say, you pretty yaller girl, would it scare you
bad to stand up here on top where I be? See if you've got grit and come up here where I can
hold you. All you got to do is to sit still on that there rock that they're just hoistin',
and then when you get here I'll hold you tight, don't you be scared Sis."

Sometimes Melanctha would do some of these things that had much danger, and always with such
men, she showed her power and her break neck courage. Once she slipped and fell from a high
place. A workman caught her and so she was not killed, but her left arm was badly broken.

All the men crowded around her. They admired her boldness in doing and in bearing pain when
her arm was broken. They all went along with her with great respect to the doctor, and then
they took her home in triumph and all of them were bragging about her not squealing.

James Herbert was home where his wife lived, that day. He was furious when he saw the workmen
and Melanctha. He drove the men away with curses so that they were all very nearly fighting,
and he would not let a doctor come in to attend Melanctha. "Why don't you see to that girl
better, you, you're her mother."

James Herbert did not fight things out now any more with his daughter. He feared her tongue,
and her school learning, and the way she had of saying things that were very nasty to a brutal
black man who knew nothing. And Melanctha just then hated him very badly in her suffering.

And so this was the way Melanctha lived the four years of her beginning as a woman. And many
things happened to Melanctha, but she knew very well that none of them had led her on to the
right way, that certain way that was to lead her to world wisdom.
