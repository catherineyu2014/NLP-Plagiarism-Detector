THE LETTERS OF CHARLES AND MARY LAMB

1796-1820

EDITED BY E. V. LUCAS

WITH A FRONTISPIECE

PREFACE

This edition of the correspondence of Charles and Mary Lamb contains 618 letters, of which
45 are by Mary Lamb alone. It is the only edition to contain all Mary Lamb's letters and also
a reference to, or abstract of, every letter of Charles Lamb's that cannot, for reasons of
copyright, be included. Canon Ainger's last edition contains 467 letters and the Every-man's
Library Edition contains 572. In 1905 the Boston Bibliophile Society, a wealthy association
of American collectors, issued privately--since privately one can do anything--an edition in
six volumes (limited to 453 sets) of the correspondence of Charles and Mary Lamb, containing
everything that was available, which means practically everything that was known: the number
reaching a total of 762 letters; but it will be many years before such a collection can be
issued in England, since each of the editions here has copyright matter peculiar to itself.
My attempt to induce the American owner of the largest number of new letters to allow me to
copy them from the Boston Bibliophile edition has proved fruitless.

And here a word as to copyright in such documents in England, the law as most recently laid
down being established upon a set of sixteen of Lamb's letters which unhappily are not (except
in very brief abstract) in the present edition. These letters, chiefly to Robert Lloyd, were
first published in Charles Lamb and the Lloyds, under my editorship, in 1900, the right to
make copies and publish them having been acquired by Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co. from Mrs. Steeds,
a descendant of Charles Lloyd. The originals were then purchased by Mr. J. M. Dent, who included
copies in his edition of Lamb's letters, under Mr. Macdonald's editorship, in 1903. Meanwhile
Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co. had sold their rights in the letters to Messrs. Macmillan for Canon
Ainger's edition, and when Mr. Dent's edition was issued Messrs. Macmillan with Messrs. Smith,
Elder & Co. brought an action. Mr. Dent thereupon acquired from Mr. A. H. Moxon, the son of
Emma Isola, Lamb's residuary legatee, all his rights as representing the original author. The
case was heard before Mr. Justice Kekewich early in 1906. The judge held that "the proprietor
of the author's manuscript in the case of letters, as in the case of any other manuscript,
meant the owner of the actual paper on which the matter was written, and that in the case of
letters the recipient was the owner. No doubt the writer could restrain the recipient from
publishing, and so could the writer's representatives after death; but although they had the
right to restrain others from publishing, it did not follow that they had the right to publish
and acquire copyright. This right was given to the proprietor of the manuscript, who, although
he could be restrained from publishing by the writer's personal representatives, yet, if not
so restrained, could publish and acquire copyright."

Mr. Dent appealed against this verdict and his appeal was heard on October 31 and November
7, 1906, when the decision of Mr. Justice Kekewich was upheld with a clearer definition of
the right of restraint. The Court, in deciding (I quote again from Mr. MacGillivray's summary)
that "the proprietors of manuscript letters were, after the writer's death, entitled to the
copyright in them when published, were careful to make it clear that they did not intend to
overrule the authority of those cases where a deceased man's representatives have been held
entitled to restrain the publication of his private letters by the recipients or persons claiming
through them. The Court expressly affirmed the common law right of the writer and his representatives
in unpublished letters. It did not follow that because the copyright, if there was publication,
would be in the person who, being proprietor of the author's manuscript, first published, that
that person would be entitled to publish. The common law right would be available to enable
the legal personal representatives, under proper circumstances, to restrain publication." That
is how the copyright law as regards letters stands to-day (1912).

The present edition has been revised throughout and in it will be found much new material.
I have retained from the large edition only such notes as bear upon the Lambs and the place
of the letters in their life, together with such explanatory references as seemed indispensable.
For the sources of quotations and so forth the reader must consult the old edition.

For permission to include certain new letters I have to thank the Master of Magdalene, Mr.
Ernest Betham, Major Butterworth, Mr. Bertram Dobell, Mr. G. Dunlop, and Mr. E. D. North of
New York.

As an example of other difficulties of editing, at any given time, the correspondence of Charles
and Mary Lamb, I may say that while these volumes were going through the press, Messrs. Sotheby
offered for sale new letters by both hands, the existence of which was unknown equally to English
editors and to Boston Bibliophiles. The most remarkable of them is a joint letter from sister
and brother to Louisa Martin, their child-friend (to whom Lamb wrote the verses "The Ape"),
dated March 28, 1809. Mary begins, and Charles then takes the pen and becomes mischievous.
Thus, "Hazlitt's child died of swallowing a bag of white paint, which the poor little innocent
thing mistook for sugar candy. It told its mother just before it died, that it did not like
soft sugar candy, and so it came out, which was not before suspected. When it was opened several
other things were found in it, particularly a small hearth brush, two golden pippins, and a
letter which I had written to Hazlitt from Bath. The letter had nothing remarkable in it."
... The others are from brother and sister to Miss Kelly, the actress, whom Lamb, in 1819,
wished to marry. The first, March 27, 1820, is from Mary Lamb saying that she has taken to
French as a recreation and has been reading Racine. The second is from Lamb, dated July 6,
1825, thanking Miss Kelly for tickets at Arnold's theatre, the Lyceum, and predicting the success
of his farce "The Pawnbroker's Daughter." How many more new letters are still to come to light,
who shall say?

FRONTISPIECE

CHARLES LAMB (AGED 44)

From a Water-colour Drawing by J. G. F. Joseph.

With regard to Allen,--the woman he has married has some money, I have heard about L200 a year,
enough for the maintenance of herself & children, one of whom is a girl nine years old! so
Allen has dipt betimes into the cares of a family. I very seldom see him, & do not know whether
he has given up the Westminster hospital. I am sincerely sorry for Allen, as a family man particularly.

Le Grice is gone to make puns in Cornwall. He has got a tutorship to a young boy, living with
his Mother, a widow Lady. He will of course initiate him quickly in "whatsoever things are
lovely, honorable, and of good report." He has cut Miss Hunt compleatly,--the poor Girl is
very ill on the Occasion, but he laughs at it, and justifies himself by saying, "she does not
see him laugh." Coleridge, I know not what suffering scenes you have gone through at Bristol--my
life has been somewhat diversified of late.

Your Conciones ad populum are the most eloquent politics that ever came in my way.

Write, when convenient--not as a task, for there is nothing in this letter to answer.

You may inclose under cover to me at the India house what letters you please, for they come
post free.

We cannot send our remembrances to Mrs. C---- not having seen her, but believe me our best
good wishes attend you both.

My civic and poetic compts to Southey if at Bristol.--Why, he is a very Leviathan of Bards--the
small minnow I--

[This is the earliest letter of Lamb's that has come down to us. On February 10, 1796, he was
just twenty-one years old, and was now living at 7 Little Queen Street (since demolished) with
his father, mother, Aunt Sarah Lamb (known as Aunt Hetty), Mary Lamb and, possibly, John Lamb.
John Lamb, senior, was doing nothing and had, I think, already begun to break up: his old master,
Samuel Salt, had died in February, 1792. John Lamb, the son (born June 5, 1763), had a clerkship
at the South-Sea House; Charles Lamb had begun his long period of service in the India House;
and Mary Lamb (born December 3, 1764) was occupied as a mantua-maker.

At this time Coleridge was twenty-three; he would be twenty-four on October 21. His military
experiences over, he had married Sara Fricker on October 4, 1795 (a month before Southey married
her sister Edith), and was living at Bristol, on Redcliffe Hill. The first number of The Watchman
was dated on March 1, 1796; on May 13, 1796, it came to an end. On April 16, 1796, Cottle had
issued Coleridge's Poems on Various Subjects, containing also four "effusions" by Charles Lamb
(Nos. VII., XI., XII. and XIII.), and the "Religious Musings." Southey, on bad terms with Coleridge,
partly on account of Southey's abandonment of Pantisocracy, was in Lisbon. His Joan of Arc
had just been published by Cottle in quarto at a guinea. Previously he had collaborated in
The Fall of Robespierre, 1794, with Coleridge and Robert Lovell. Each, one evening, had set
forth to write an act by the next. Southey and Lovell did so, but Coleridge brought only a
part of his. Lovell's being useless, Southey rewrote his act, Coleridge finished his at leisure,
and the result was published. Robert Lovell (1770?-1796) had also been associated with Coleridge
and Southey in Pantisocracy and was their brother-in-law, having married Mary Fricker, another
of the sisters. When, in 1795, Southey and Lovell had published a joint volume of Poems, Southey
took the pseudonym of Bion and Lovell of Moschus.

May was probably the landlord of the Salutation and Cat. The London Directory for 1808 has
"William May, Salutation Coffee House, 17 Newgate Street." We must suppose that when Coleridge
quitted the Salutation and Cat in January, 1795, he was unable to pay his bill, and therefore
had to leave his luggage behind. Cottle's story of Coleridge being offered free lodging by
a London inn-keeper, if he would only talk and talk, must then either be a pretty invention
or apply to another landlord, possibly the host of the Angel in Butcher Hall Street.

Allen was Robert Allen, a schoolfellow of Lamb and Coleridge, and Coleridge's first friend.
He was born on October 18, 1772. Both Lamb and Leigh Hunt tell good stories of him at Christ's
Hospital, Lamb in Elia and Hunt in his Autobiography. From Christ's Hospital he went to University
College, Oxford, and it was he who introduced Coleridge and Hucks to Southey in 1794. Probably,
says Mr. E. H. Coleridge, it was he who brought Coleridge and John Stoddart (afterwards Sir
John, and Hazlitt's brother-in-law) together. On leaving Oxford he seems to have gone to Westminster
to learn surgery, and in 1797 he was appointed Deputy-Surgeon to the 2nd Royals, then in Portugal.
He married a widow with children; at some time later took to journalism, as Lamb's reference
in the Elia essay on "Newspapers" tells us; and he died of apoplexy in 1805.

Coleridge's employment on the Evidences of Religion, whatever it may have been, did not reach
print.

Le Grice was Charles Valentine Le Grice (1773-1858), an old Christ's Hospitaller and Grecian
(see Lamb's Elia essays on "Christ's Hospital" and "Grace before Meat"). Le Grice passed to
Trinity College, Cambridge. He left in 1796 and became tutor to William John Godolphin Nicholls
of Trereife, near Penzance, the only son of a widowed mother. Le Grice was ordained in 1798
and married Mrs. Nicholls in 1799. Young Nicholls died in 1815 and Mrs. Le Grice in 1821, when
Le Grice became sole owner of the Trereife property. He was incumbent of St. Mary's, Penzance,
for some years. Le Grice was a witty, rebellious character, but he never fulfilled the promise
of his early days. It has been conjectured that his skill in punning awakened Lamb's ambition
in that direction. Le Grice saw Lamb next in 1834, at the Bell at Edmonton. His recollections
of Lamb were included by Talfourd in the Memorials, and his recollections of Coleridge were
printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, December, 1834. I know nothing of Miss Hunt.

Of Lamb's confinement in a madhouse we know no more than is here told. It is conjectured that
the "other person" to whom Lamb refers a few lines later was Ann Simmons, a girl at Widford
for whom he had an attachment that had been discouraged, if not forbidden, by her friends.
This is the only attack of the kind that Lamb is known to have suffered. He once told Coleridge
that during his illness he had sometimes believed himself to be Young Norval in Home's "Douglas."

The poem in blank verse was, we learn in a subsequent letter, "The Grandame," or possibly an
autobiographical work of which "The Grandame" is the only portion that survived.

White was James White (1775-1820), an old Christ's Hospitaller and a friend and almost exact
contemporary of Lamb. Lamb, who first kindled his enthusiasm for Shakespeare, was, I think,
to some extent involved in the Original Letters, &c., of Sir John Falstaff and his Friends,
which appeared in 1796. The dedication--to Master Samuel Irelaunde, meaning William Henry Ireland
(who sometimes took his father's name Samuel), the forger of the pretended Shakespearian play
"Vortigern," produced at Drury Lane earlier in the year--is quite in Lamb's manner. White's
immortality, however, rests not upon this book, but upon his portrait in the Elia essay on
"Chimney-Sweepers."

The sonnet "To my Sister" was printed, with slight alterations, by Lamb in Coleridge's Poems,
second edition, 1797, and again in Lamb's Works, 1818.

Coleridge's Condones ad Populum; or, Addresses to the People, had been published at Bristol
in November, 1795.]

LETTER 2

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[Probably begun either on Tuesday, May 24, or Tuesday, May 31, 1796. Postmark? June 1.]

I am in such violent pain with the head ach that I am fit for nothing but transcribing, scarce
for that. When I get your poems, and the Joan of Arc, I will exercise my presumption in giving
you my opinion of 'em. The mail does not come in before tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. The following
sonnet was composed during a walk down into Hertfordshire early in last Summer.

The lord of light shakes off his drowsyhed.[*] Fresh from his couch up springs the lusty Sun,
And girds himself his mighty race to run.

[Footnote: Drowsyhed I have met with I think in Spencer. Tis an old thing, but it rhymes with
led & rhyming covers a multitude of licences.]

The last line is a copy of Bowles's, "to the green hamlet in the peaceful plain." Your ears
are not so very fastidious--many people would not like words so prosaic and familiar in a sonnet
as Islington and Hertfordshire. The next was written within a day or two of the last, on revisiting
a spot where the scene was laid of my 1st sonnet that "mock'd my step with many a lonely glade."

When last I roved these winding wood-walks green, Green winding walks, and pathways shady-sweet,
Oftimes would Anna seek the silent scene, Shrouding her beauties in the lone retreat. No more
I hear her footsteps in the shade; Her image only in these pleasant ways Meets me self-wandring
where in better days I held free converse with my fair-hair'd maid. I pass'd the little cottage,
which she loved, The cottage which did once my all contain: it spake of days that ne'er must
come again, Spake to my heart and much my heart was moved. "Now fair befall thee, gentle maid,"
said I, And from the cottage turn'd me, with a sigh.

The next retains a few lines from a sonnet of mine, which you once remarked had no "body of
thought" in it. I agree with you, but have preserved a part of it, and it runs thus. I flatter
myself you will like it.

A timid grace sits trembling in her Eye, As both to meet the rudeness of men's sight, Yet shedding
a delicious lunar light, That steeps in kind oblivious extacy The care-craz'd mind, like some
still melody; Speaking most plain the thoughts which do possess Her gentle sprite, peace and
meek quietness, And innocent loves,[*] and maiden purity. A look whereof might heal the cruel
smart Of changed friends, or fortune's wrongs unkind; Might to sweet deeds of mercy move the
heart Of him, who hates his brethren of mankind. Turned are those beams from me, who fondly
yet Past joys, vain loves, and buried hopes regret.

[Footnote: Cowley uses this phrase with a somewhat different meaning: I meant loves of relatives
friends &c.]

The next and last I value most of all. 'Twas composed close upon the heels of the last in that
very wood I had in mind when I wrote "Methinks how dainty sweet."

We were two pretty babes, the youngest she, The youngest and the loveliest far, I ween, And
INNOCENCE her name. The time has been, We two did love each other's company; Time was, we two
had wept to have been apart. But when, with shew of seeming good beguil'd, I left the garb
and manners of a child, And my first love for man's society, Defiling with the world my virgin
heart, My loved companion dropt a tear, and fled, And hid in deepest shades her awful head.
Beloved, who can tell me where Thou art, In what delicious Eden to be found, That I may seek
thee the wide world around.

Since writing it, I have found in a poem by Hamilton of Bangour, these 2 lines to happiness

Nun sober and devout, where art thou fled To hide in shades thy meek contented head.

Lines eminently beautiful, but I do not remember having re'd 'em previously, for the credit
of my 10th and 11th lines. Parnell has 2 lines (which probably suggested the above) to Contentment

Whither ah! whither art thou fled, To hide thy meek contented head.[*]

[Footnote: an odd epithet for contentment in a poet so poetical as Parnell.]

Cowley's exquisite Elegy on the death of his friend Harvey suggested the phrase of "we two"

"Was there a tree that did not know The love betwixt us two?----"

So much for acknowledged plagiarisms, the confession of which I know not whether it has more
of vanity or modesty in it. As to my blank verse I am so dismally slow and sterile of ideas
(I speak from my heart) that I much question if it will ever come to any issue. I have hitherto
only hammered out a few indepen[den]t unconnected snatches, not in a capacity to be sent. I
am very ill, and will rest till I have read your poems--for which I am very thankful. I have
one more favour to beg of you, that you never mention Mr. May's affair in any sort, much less
think of repaying. Are we not flocci-nauci-what-d'ye-call-em-ists?

We have just learnd, that my poor brother has had a sad accident: a large stone blown down
by yesterday's high wind has bruised his leg in a most shocking manner--he is under the care
of Cruikshanks. Coleridge, there are 10,000 objections against my paying you a visit at Bristol--it
cannot be, else--but in this world 'tis better not to think too much of pleasant possibles,
that we may not be out of humour with present insipids. Should any thing bring you to London,
you will recollect No. 7, Little Queen St. Holborn.

I shall be too ill to call on Wordsworth myself but will take care to transmit him his poem,
when I have read it. I saw Le Grice the day before his departure, and mentioned incidentally
his "teaching the young idea how to shoot"--knowing him and the probability there is of people
having a propensity to pun in his company you will not wonder that we both stumbled on the
same pun at once, he eagerly anticipating me,--"he would teach him to shoot!"--Poor Le Grice!
if wit alone could entitle a man to respect, &c. He has written a very witty little pamphlet
lately, satirical upon college declamations; when I send White's book, I will add that.

I am sorry there should be any difference between you and Southey. "Between you two there should
be peace," tho' I must say I have borne him no good will since he spirited you away from among
us. What is become of Moschus? You sported some of his sublimities, I see, in your Watchman.
Very decent things. So much for to night from your afflicted headachey sorethroatey, humble
Servant C. Lamb------Tuesday night---------.

Of your Watchmen, the Review of Burke was the best prose. It has endeared us more than any
thing to your good Lady; and your own self-reproof that follows delighted us.

[The postmark of this letter looks like June 1, but it might be June 7, It was odd to date
it "Tuesday night" half way through, and "Tuesday eve" at the end. Possibly Lamb began it on
Tuesday, May 24, and finished it on Tuesday, May 31; possibly he began it on Tuesday, May 31,
and finished it and posted it on Tuesday, June 7.

The Hertfordshire sonnet was printed in the Monthly Magazine for December, 1797, and not reprinted
by Lamb.

The sonnet that "mock'd my step with many a lonely glade" is that beginning--

Was it some sweet device of Faery,

which had been printed in Coleridge's Poems, 1796. The second, third and fourth of the sonnets
that are copied in this letter were printed in the second edition of Coleridge's Poems, 1797.
Anna is generally supposed to be Ann Simmons, referred to in the previous note.

Concerning "Flocci-nauci-what-d'ye-call-'em-ists," Canon Ainger has the following interesting
note: "'Flocci, nauci' is the beginning of a rule in the old Latin grammars, containing a list
of words signifying 'of no account,' floccus being a lock of wool, and naucus a trifle. Lamb
was recalling a sentence in one of Shenstone's Letters:--'I loved him for nothing so much as
his flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication of money.'" But "Pantisocratists" was, of course, the
word that Lamb was shadowing. Pantisocracy, however--the new order of common living and high
thinking, to be established on the banks of the Susquehanna by Coleridge, Southey, Favell,
Burnett and others--was already dead.

William Cumberland Cruikshank, the anatomist, who attended Lamb's brother, had attended Dr.
Johnson in his last illness.

Le Grice's pamphlet was A General Theorem for A******* Coll. Declamation, by Gronovius, 1796.

Southey and Coleridge had been on somewhat strained terms for some time; possibly, as I have
said in the previous note, owing to Southey's abandonment of Pantisocratic fervour, which anticipated
Coleridge's by some months. Also, to marry sisters does not always lead to serenity. The spiriting
away of Coleridge had been effected by Southey in January, 1795, when he found Coleridge at
the Angel in Butcher Hall Street (vice the Salutation in Newgate Street) and bore him back
to Bristol and the forlorn Sara Fricker, and away from Lamb, journalism and egg-hot.

Moschus was, as we have seen, Robert Lovell. No. V. of The Watchman contained sonnets by him.

The review of Burke's Letter to a Noble Lord was in No. I. of The Watchman.--The passage from
"Religious Musings," under the title "The Present State of Society," was in No. II.--extending
from line 260 to 357. Lamb praises him in his essay on the Artificial Comedy.--In No. IX. of
The Watchman were prose paraphrases of three Sclavonian songs, the first being "Song of a Female
Orphan," and the second, "Song of the Haymakers."--John Logan's "Braes of Yarrow" had been
quoted in No. III. as "the most exquisite performance in our language."--The invective against
"the barterers" refers to the denunciation of the slave trade in No. IV. of The Watchman.

Cowper's recovery was only partial; and he was never rightly himself after 1793. The edition
of Milton had been begun about 1790. It was never finished as originally intended; but Fuseli
completed forty pictures, which were exhibited in 1799. An edition of Cowper's translations,
with designs by Flaxman, was published in 1808, and of Cowper's complete Milton in 1810.

Wordsworth's poem would be "Guilt and Sorrow," of which a portion was printed in Lyrical Ballads,
1798, and the whole published in 1842.

Coleridge's "Monody on Chatterton," the first poem in his Poems on Various Subjects, 1796,
had been written originally at Christ's Hospital, 1790: it continued to be much altered before
the final version.

The two lines from "Religious Musings" are not the last, but the beginning of the last passage.

Coleridge contributed between three and four hundred lines to Book II. of Southey's Joan of
Arc, as we shall see later.

The plan to resume The Watchman did not come to anything.

Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), the theologian, at this time the object of Lamb's adoration,
was one of the fathers of Unitarianism, a creed in which Lamb had been brought up under the
influence of his Aunt Hetty. Coleridge, as a supporter of one of Priestley's allies, William
Frend of Cambridge, and as a convinced Unitarian, was also an admirer of Priestley, concerning
whom and the Birmingham riots of 1791 is a fine passage in "Religious Musings," while one of
the sonnets of the 1796 volume was addressed to him: circumstances which Lamb had in mind when
mentioning him in this letter. Lamb had probably seen Priestley at the Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney,
where he became morning preacher in December, 1791, remaining there until March, 1794. Thenceforward
he lived in America. His Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion appeared between 1772
and 1774. The other work referred to is Letters to the Philosophers and Politicians of France,
newly edited by Theophilus Lindsey, the Unitarian, as An Answer to Mr. Paine's "Age of Reason,"
1795.]

LETTER 3

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

[Begun Wednesday, June 8. Dated on address: "Friday 10th June," 1796.]

With Joan of Arc I have been delighted, amazed. The 10th book is the most languid. 13th page.
"The thrilling tones that concentrate the soul" is a nervous line, and the 6 first lines of
page 14 are very pretty. The 21st effusion a perfect thing. That in the manner of Spencer is
very sweet, particularly at the close. The concluding simile is far-fetch'd. "Tempest-honord"
is a quaint-ish phrase. Of the Monody on H., I will here only notice these lines, as superlatively
excellent. That energetic one, "Shall I not praise thee, Scholar, Christian, friend," like
to that beautiful climax of Shakspeare "King, Hamlet, Royal Dane, Father." "Yet memory turns
from little men to thee!" "and sported careless round their fellow child." The whole, I repeat
it, is immensely good. Yours is a Poetical family. I was much surpriz'd and pleased to see
the signature of Sara to that elegant composition, the 5th Epistle. I have recoverd. &c. which
you may think "rudely disbranched" from the Chatterton will patch in with the Man of Ross,
where they were once quite at Home, with 2 more which I recollect "and o'er the dowried virgin's
snowy cheek bad bridal love suffuse his blushes meek!" very beautiful. It is very pretty, and
you seem to think so, but, may be o'er looked its chief merit, that of filling up a whole page.
Of this kind are Bowles, Priestly, and that most exquisite and most Bowles-like of all, the
19th Effusion. It would have better ended with "agony of care." The last 2 lines are obvious
and unnecessary and you need not now make 14 lines of it, now it is rechristend from a Sonnet
to an Effusion. Schiller might have written the 20 Effusion. Time nor nothing can reconcile
me to the concluding 5 lines of Kosciusko: call it any thing you will but sublime. That to
Mrs. Siddons now you were welcome to improve, if it had been worth it. Allen I am sorry to
say is a confirmed Atheist. Are you acquainted with Bowles? I see, by his last Elegy (written
at Bath), you are near neighbours.

C. L.

[Southey's Joan of Arc, with contributions to Book II. by Coleridge, had been published in
quarto by Cottle. Coleridge contributed to Book II. the first 450 lines, with the exception
of 141-143, 148-222, 266-272 and 286-291. He subsequently took out his lines and gave them
new shape as the poem "The Destiny of Nations," printed in Sibylline Leaves, 1817. All subsequent
editions of Southey's poem appeared without Coleridge's portion. The passages on page 26 and
page 28 were Southey's. Those at the beginning of the second book were Coleridge's. The simile
of the Laplander may be read in "The Destiny of Nations" (lines 63-79).

With page 98 we come to Southey again, the remaining references being to him. The maid baffles
the doctors in Book III.; page 126 is in Book IV.; the personifications are in Book VI.; the
converse between Joan and Conrade is in Book IV.; page 313 is at the beginning of Book IX.;
and pages 315, 347 and 361 are also in Book IX. Southey in the preface to Joan of Arc, speaking
of Homer, says: "Pope has disguised him in fop-finery and Cowper has stripped him naked." "Crazy
Kate" is an episode in The Task ("The Sofa").

The "Monody on John Henderson," by Joseph Cottle, was printed anonymously in a volume of poems
in 1795, and again in The Malvern Hill. John Henderson (1757-1788) was an eccentric scholar
of Bristol. The lines praised by Lamb are the 4th, 12th and 14th. The poem must not be confused
with the Monody on Henderson, the actor, by G. D. Harley.

Lamb now turns again to Coleridge's Poems. The poem on the 13th and 14th pages of this little
volume was "To the Rev. W. J. H." The 21st Effusion was that entitled "Composed while Climbing
the Left Ascent of Brockley Coomb." The 35th Effusion is known as "The AEolian Harp." The letter
from Shurton Bars is the poem beginning--

        Nor travels my meand'ring eye.

The 4th Epistle is that to Joseph Cottle, Coleridge's publisher and the author of the "Monody
on Henderson," referred to in Coleridge's verses. The lines which Lamb quotes are Cottle's.
The poem by Sara Coleridge is "The Silver Thimble."

"You came to Town ..." Soon after his engagement with Sara Fricker, his heart being still not
wholly healed of its passion for Mary Evans, Coleridge had gone to London from Bristol, nominally
to arrange for the publication of his Fall of Robespierre, and had resumed intercourse with
Lamb and other old Christ's Hospital friends. There he remained until Southey forcibly took
him back in January, 1795. From what Lamb says of the loss of two friends we must suppose,
in default of other information, that he had to give up his Anna at the same time. The loss
of reason, however, to which he refers did not come until the end of the year 1795.

The 19th Effusion, afterwards called "On a Discovery Made Too Late;" the 28th, "The Kiss;"
the 29th, "Imitated from Ossian."

"Your monody." This, not to be confounded with Cottle's "Monody on Henderson," was Coleridge's
"Monody on Chatterton." Lamb's emendations were not accepted. As regards "The Man of Ross,"
the couplet beginning "Friend to the friendless" ultimately had a place both in that poem and
in the Monody, but the couplet "and o'er the dowried virgin" was never replaced in either.
The lines on spring, page 28, are "Lines to a Beautiful Spring." Dr. Forster (Faustus) was
the hero of the nursery rhyme, whose scholars danced out of England into France and Spain and
back again. The epitaph on an infant was in The Watchman, No. IX. (see note on page 62). The
lines in "Absence" are those in the second stanza of the poem.

The 19th Effusion, beginning "Thou bleedest, my poor heart," is known as "On a Discovery Made
Too Late." The 20th Effusion is the sonnet to Schiller. The lines which were sent to Lamb,
written in December, 1794, are called "To a Friend, together with an unfinished poem" ("Religious
Musings"). Coleridge's "Restless Gale" is the imitation of Ossian, beginning, "The stream with
languid murmur creeps."

Coleridge did not alter the phrase.

Lamb contributed four effusions to this volume of Coleridge's: the 7th, to Mrs. Siddons (written
in conjunction with Coleridge), the 11th, 12th and 13th. All were signed C. L. Coleridge had
permitted himself to make various alterations. The following parallel will show the kind of
treatment to which Lamb objected:--

LAMB'S ORIGINAL EFFUSION (11)

Was it some sweet device of Faery That mock'd my steps with many a lonely glade, And fancied
wanderings with a fair-hair'd maid? Have these things been? or what rare witchery, Impregning
with delights the charmed air, Enlighted up the semblance of a smile In those fine eyes? methought
they spake the while Soft soothing things, which might enforce despair To drop the murdering
knife, and let go by His foul resolve. And does the lonely glade Still court the foot-steps
of the fair-hair'd maid? Still in her locks the gales of summer sigh? While I forlorn do wander
reckless where, And 'mid my wanderings meet no Anna there.

AS ALTERED BY COLERIDGE

Was it some sweet device of faery land That mock'd my steps with many a lonely glade, And fancied
wand'rings with a fair-hair'd maid? Have these things been? Or did the wizard wand Of Merlin
wave, impregning vacant air, And kindle up the vision of a smile In those blue eyes, that seem'd
to speak the while Such tender things, as might enforce Despair To drop the murth'ring knife,
and let go by His fell resolve? Ah me! the lonely glade Still courts the footsteps of the fair-hair'd
maid, Among whose locks the west-winds love to sigh: But I forlorn do wander, reckless where,
And mid my wand'rings find no ANNA there!

In Effusion 12 Lamb had written:--

Or we might sit and tell some tender tale
Of faithful vows repaid by cruel scorn,
   A tale of true love, or of friend forgot;
And I would teach thee, lady, how to rail
   In gentle sort, on those who practise not
Or Love or pity, though of woman born.

Coleridge made it:--

But ah! sweet scenes of fancied bliss, adieu! On rose-leaf beds amid your faery bowers I all
too long have lost the dreamy hours! Beseems it now the sterner Muse to woo, If haply she her
golden meed impart To realize the vision of the heart.

Again in the 13th Effusion, "Written at Midnight, by the Sea-side, after a Voyage," Lamb had
dotted out the last two lines. Coleridge substituted the couplet:--

How Reason reel'd! What gloomy transports rose! Till the rude dashings rock'd them to repose.

Effusion 2, which Lamb would omit, was the sonnet "To Burke;" Effusion 3, "To Mercy" (on Pitt);
Effusion 5, "To Erskine;" Effusion 7, Lamb and Coleridge's joint sonnet, "To Mrs. Siddons;"
and Effusion 8, "To Koskiusko." The "Lines Written in Early Youth" were afterwards called "Lines
on an Autumnal Evening." The poem called "Recollection," in The Watchman, was reborn as "Sonnet
to the River Otter." The lines on the early blossom were praised by Lamb in a previous letter.
The 10th Effusion was the sonnet to Earl Stanhope.

Godwin was William Godwin, the philosopher. We shall later see much of him. It was Allen's
wife, not Stoddart's, who had a grown-up daughter.

Ned Evans was a novel in four volumes, published in 1796, an imitation of Tom Jones, which
presumably Coleridge was reviewing for the Critical Review.

Young W. Evans is said by Mr. Dykes Campbell to have been the only son of the Mrs. Evans who
befriended Coleridge when he was at Christ's Hospital, the mother of his first love, Mary Evans.
Evans was at school with Coleridge and Lamb. We shall meet with him again.

William Lisle Bowles (1762-1850), the sonneteer, who had exerted so powerful a poetical influence
on Coleridge's mind, was at this time rector of Cricklade in Wiltshire (1792-1797), but had
been ill at Bath. The elegy in question was "Elegiac Stanzas written during sickness at Bath,
December, 1795." The lines quoted by Lamb are respectively in the 6th, 4th, 5th and 19th Stanzas.

Sophia Pringle. Probably the subject of a Catnach or other popular broadside. I have not found it.

Izaak Walton. Lamb returns to praises of The Compleat Angler in his letter to Robert Lloyd
referred to on page 215.

The reference to the Unitarian chapel bears probably upon an offer of a pulpit to Coleridge.
The tutorship was probably that offered to Coleridge by Mrs. Evans of Darley Hall (no relation
to Mary Evans) who wished him to teach her sons. Neither project was carried through.]

LETTER 4

(Apparently a continuation of a letter the first part of which is missing)

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE [Begun] Monday Night [June 13, 1796].

UNFURNISHED at present with any sheet-filling subject, I shall continue my letter gradually
and journal-wise. My second thoughts entirely coincide with your comments on "Joan of Arc,"
and I can only wonder at my childish judgment which overlooked the 1st book and could prefer
the 9th: not that I was insensible to the soberer beauties of the former, but the latter caught
me with its glare of magic,--the former, however, left a more pleasing general recollection
in my mind. Let me add, the 1st book was the favourite of my sister--and I now, with Joan,
often "think on Domremi and the fields of Arc." I must not pass over without acknowledging
my obligations to your full and satisfactory account of personifications. I have read it again
and again, and it will be a guide to my future taste. Perhaps I had estimated Southey's merits
too much by number, weight, and measure. I now agree completely and entirely in your opinion
of the genius of Southey. Your own image of melancholy is illustrative of what you teach, and
in itself masterly. I conjecture it is "disbranched" from one of your embryo "hymns." When
they are mature of birth (were I you) I should print 'em in one separate volume, with "Religious
Musings" and your part of the "Joan of Arc." Birds of the same soaring wing should hold on
their flight in company. Once for all (and by renewing the subject you will only renew in me
the condemnation of Tantalus), I hope to be able to pay you a visit (if you are then at Bristol)
some time in the latter end of August or beginning of September for a week or fortnight; before
that time, office business puts an absolute veto on my coming.

    "And if a sigh that speaks regret of happier times appear,
    A glimpse of joy that we have met shall shine and dry the tear."

Of the blank verses I spoke of, the following lines are the only tolerably complete ones I
have writ out of not more than one hundred and fifty. That I get on so slowly you may fairly
impute to want of practice in composition, when I declare to you that (the few verses which
you have seen excepted) I have not writ fifty lines since I left school. It may not be amiss
to remark that my grandmother (on whom the verses are written) lived housekeeper in a family
the fifty or sixty last years of her life--that she was a woman of exemplary piety and goodness--and
for many years before her death was terribly afflicted with a cancer in her breast which she
bore with true Christian patience. You may think that I have not kept enough apart the ideas
of her heavenly and her earthly master but recollect I have designedly given in to her own
way of feeling--and if she had a failing, 'twas that she respected her master's family too
much, not reverenced her Maker too little. The lines begin imperfectly, as I may probably connect
'em if I finish at all,--and if I do, Biggs shall print 'em in a more economical way than you
yours, for (Sonnets and all) they won't make a thousand lines as I propose completing 'em,
and the substance must be wire-drawn.

Tuesday Evening, June 14, 1796.

Thursday [June 16, 1796].

I am now in high hopes to be able to visit you, if perfectly convenient on your part, by the
end of next month--perhaps the last week or fortnight in July. A change of scene and a change
of faces would do me good, even if that scene were not to be Bristol, and those faces Coleridge's
and his friends. In the words of Terence, a little altered, "Taedet me hujus quotidiani mundi."
I am heartily sick of the every-day scenes of life. I shall half wish you unmarried (don't
show this to Mrs. C.) for one evening only, to have the pleasure of smoking with you, and drinking
egg-hot in some little smoky room in a pot-house, for I know not yet how I shall like you in
a decent room, and looking quite happy. My best love and respects to Sara notwithstanding.

                                  Yours sincerely,
                                     CHARLES LAMB.

[Coleridge's image of melancholy will be found in the lines "Melancholy--a fragment." It was
published in Sibylline Leaves, 1817, and in a note Coleridge said that the verses were printed
in the Morning Chronicle in 1794. They were really printed in the Morning Post, December 12,
1797. Coleridge had probably sent them to Lamb in MS. The "hymns" came to nothing.

"The following lines." Lamb's poem "The Grandame" was presumably included in this letter. See
Vol. IV. Mary Field, Lamb's grandmother, died July 31, 1792, aged seventy-nine, and was buried
in Widford churchyard. She had been for many years housekeeper in the Plumer family at Blakesware.
On William Plumer's moving to Gilston, a neighbouring seat, in 1767, she had sole charge of
the Blakesware mansion, where her grandchildren used to visit her. Compare Lamb's Elia essays
"Blakesmoor in H----shire" and "Dream-Children,"

N. Biggs was the printer of Coleridge's Poems, 1797.

Lamb had begun his amendment of Coleridge's "Monody on the Death of Chatterton" in his letter
of June 10. Coleridge's illustrative personifications, here referred to, are in that poem.
The extract book from which Lamb copied his quotations from Beaumont and Fletcher and Massinger
was, he afterwards tells us, destroyed; but similar volumes, which he filled later, are preserved.
Many of his extracts he included in his Dramatic Specimens.

Writing to Charles Lloyd, sen., in 1809, Lamb says of Cowper as a translator of Homer that
he "delays you ... walking over a Bowling Green."

Canon Ainger possessed a copy of the book translated by Lamb's fellow-clerk. It was called
Sentimental Tablets of the Good Pamphile. "Translated from the French of M. Gorjy by P. S.
Dupuy of the East India House, 1795." Among the subscribers' names were Thomas Bye (5 copies),
Ball, Evans, Savory (2 copies), and Lamb himself.]

LETTER 5

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

[Probably begun on Wednesday, June 29. P.M. July 1, 1796.]

The first moment I can come I will, but my hopes of coming yet a while yet hang on a ticklish
thread. The coach I come by is immaterial as I shall so easily by your direction find ye out.
My mother is grown so entirely helpless (not having any use of her limbs) that Mary is necessarily
confined from ever sleeping out, she being her bed fellow. She thanks you tho' and will accompany
me in spirit. Most exquisite are the lines from Withers. Your own lines introductory to your
poem on Self run smoothly and pleasurably, and I exhort you to continue 'em. What shall I say
to your Dactyls? They are what you would call good per se, but a parody on some of 'em is just
now suggesting itself, and you shall have it rough and unlicked. I mark with figures the lines
parodied.

 4.--Sorely your Dactyls do drag along lim'p-footed.
 5.--Sad is the measure that han'gs a clod round 'em so,
 6.--Meagre, and lan'guid, proclaiming its wretchedness.
 1.--Weary, unsatisfied, not little sic'k of 'em.
11.--Cold is my tired heart, I have no charity.
 2.--Painfully trav'lling thus over the rugged road.
 7.--O begone, Measure, half Latin, half En'glish, then.
12.--Dismal your Dactyls are, God help ye, rhyming Ones.

I possibly may not come this fortnight--therefore all thou hast to do is not to look for me
any particular day, only to write word immediately if at any time you quit Bristol, lest I
come and Taffy be not at home. I hope I can come in a day or two. But young Savory of my office
is suddenly taken ill in this very nick of time and I must officiate for him till he can come
to work again. Had the knave gone sick and died and putrefied at any other time, philosophy
might have afforded one comfort, but just now I have no patience with him. Quarles I am as
great a stranger to as I was to Withers. I wish you would try and do something to bring our
elder bards into more general fame. I writhe with indignation when in books of Criticism, where
common place quotation is heaped upon quotation, I find no mention of such men as Massinger,
or B. and Fl, men with whom succeeding Dramatic Writers (Otway alone excepted) can bear no
manner of comparison. Stupid Knox hath noticed none of 'em among his extracts.

Thursday.--Mrs. C. can scarce guess how she has gratified me by her very kind letter and sweet
little poem. I feel that I should thank her in rhyme, but she must take my acknowledgment at
present in plain honest prose. The uncertainty in which I yet stand whether I can come or no
damps my spirits, reduces me a degree below prosaical, and keeps me in a suspense that fluctuates
between hope and fear. Hope is a charming, lively, blue-eyed wench, and I am always glad of
her company, but could dispense with the visitor she brings with her, her younger sister, Fear,
a white-liver'd, lilly-cheeked, bashful, palpitating, awkward hussey, that hangs like a green
girl at her sister's apronstrings, and will go with her whithersoever she goes. For the life
and soul of me I could not improve those lines in your poem on the Prince and Princess, so
I changed them to what you bid me and left 'em at Perry's. I think 'em altogether good, and
do not see why you were sollicitous about any alteration. I have not yet seen, but will make
it my business to see, to-day's Chronicle, for your verses on Horne Took. Dyer stanza'd him
in one of the papers t'other day, but I think unsuccessfully. Tooke's friends' meeting was
I suppose a dinner of CONDOLENCE. I am not sorry to find you (for all Sara) immersed in clouds
of smoke and metaphysic. You know I had a sneaking kindness for this last noble science, and
you taught me some smattering of it. I look to become no mean proficient under your tuition.
Coleridge, what do you mean by saying you wrote to me about Plutarch and Porphyry--I received
no such letter, nor remember a syllable of the matter, yet am not apt to forget any part of
your epistles, least of all an injunction like that. I will cast about for 'em, tho' I am a
sad hand to know what books are worth, and both those worthy gentlemen are alike out of my
line. To-morrow I shall be less suspensive and in better cue to write, so good bye at present.

Friday Evening.--That execrable aristocrat and knave Richardson has given me an absolute refusal
of leave! The poor man cannot guess at my disappointment. Is it not hard, "this dread dependance
on the low bred mind?" Continue to write to me tho', and I must be content--Our loves and best
good wishes attend upon you both.

LAMB.

Savory did return, but there are 2 or 3 more ill and absent, which was the plea for refusing
me. I will never commit my peace of mind by depending on such a wretch for a favor in future,
so shall never have heart to ask for holidays again. The man next him in office, Cartwright,
furnished him with the objections.

C. LAMB.

[The Dactyls were Coleridge's only in the third stanza; the remainder were Southey's. The poem
is known as "The Soldier's Wife," printed in Southey's Poems, 1797. Later Southey revised the
verses. The Anti-Jacobin had a parody of them.

Young Savory was probably a relative of Hester Savory, whom we shall meet later. He entered
the East India House on the same day that Lamb did.

We do not know what were the lines from Wither which Coleridge had sent to Lamb; but Lamb himself
eventually did much to bring him and the elder bards into more general fame--in the Dramatic
Specimens, 1808, and in the essay "On the Poetical Works of George Wither," in the Works, 1818.

Stupid Knox was Vicesimus Knox (1752-1821), the editor of Elegant Extracts in many forms.

"Her ... sweet little poem." Sara Coleridge's verses no longer exist. See Lamb's next letter
for his poetical reply.

Coleridge's poem on the Prince and Princess, "On a Late Connubial Rupture in High Life," was
not accepted by Perry, of the Morning Chronicle. It appeared in the Monthly Magazine, September,
1796. Tooke had opposed Charles James Fox, who polled 5,160 votes, and Sir Alan Gardner, who
polled 4,814, against his own 2,819.

Dyer was George Dyer (1755-1841), an old Christ's Hospitaller (but before Lamb and Coleridge's
time), of whom we shall see much--Lamb's famous "G.D."

William Richardson was Accountant-General of the East India House at that time; Charles Cartwright,
his Deputy.]

LETTER 6

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

The 5th July, 1796. [P.M. Same date.]

TO SARA AND HER SAMUEL

Was it so hard a thing? I did but ask A fleeting holy day. One little week, Or haply two, had
bounded my request.

What if the jaded Steer, who all day long Had borne the heat and labour of the plough, When
Evening came and her sweet cooling hour, Should seek to trespass on a neighbour copse, Where
greener herbage waved, or clearer streams Invited him to slake his burning thirst? That Man
were crabbed, who should say him Nay: That Man were churlish, who should drive him thence!

A blessing light upon your heads, ye good, Ye hospitable pair. I may not come, To catch on
Clifden's heights the summer gale: I may not come, a pilgrim, to the "Vales Where Avon winds,"
to taste th' inspiring waves Which Shakespere drank, our British Helicon: Or, with mine eye
intent on Redcliffe towers, To drop a tear for that Mysterious youth, Cruelly slighted, who
to London Walls, In evil hour, shap'd his disastrous course.

Complaints, begone; begone, ill-omen'd thoughts-- For yet again, and lo! from Avon banks Another
"Minstrel" cometh! Youth beloved, God and good angels guide thee on thy way, And gentler fortunes
wait the friends I love.

C.L.

LETTER 7

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

the 6th July [P.M. July 7, 1796].

Substitute in room of that last confused & incorrect Paragraph, following the words "disastrous
course," these lines

[Sidenote: Vide 3d page of this epistle.]
   { With better hopes, I trust, from Avon's vales
   { This other "minstrel" cometh Youth endear'd
no { God & good Angels guide thee on thy road,
   { And gentler fortunes wait the friends I love.

[Lamb has crossed through the above lines.]

Let us prose.

What can I do till you send word what priced and placed house you should like? Islington (possibly)
you would not like, to me 'tis classical ground. Knightsbridge is a desirable situation for
the air of the parks. St. George's Fields is convenient for its contiguity to the Bench. Chuse!
But are you really coming to town? The hope of it has entirely disarmed my petty disappointment
of its nettles. Yet I rejoice so much on my own account, that I fear I do not feel enough pure
satisfaction on yours. Why, surely, the joint editorship of the Chron: must be a very comfortable
& secure living for a man. But should not you read French, or do you? & can you write with
sufficient moderation, as 'tis called, when one suppresses the one half of what one feels,
or could say, on a subject, to chime in the better with popular luke-warmness?--White's "Letters"
are near publication. Could you review 'em, or get 'em reviewed? Are you not connected with
the Crit: Rev:? His frontispiece is a good conceit: Sir John learning to dance, to please Madame
Page, in dress of doublet, etc., from [for] the upper half; & modern pantaloons, with shoes,
etc., of the 18th century, from [for] the lower half--& the whole work is full of goodly quips
& rare fancies, "all deftly masqued like hoar antiquity"--much superior to Dr. Kenrick's Falstaff's
Wedding, which you may have seen. Allen sometimes laughs at Superstition, & Religion, & the
like. A living fell vacant lately in the gift of the Hospital. White informed him that he stood
a fair chance for it. He scrupled & scrupled about it, and at last (to use his own words) "tampered"
with Godwin to know whether the thing was honest or not. Godwin said nay to it, & Allen rejected
the living! Could the blindest Poor Papish have bowed more servilely to his Priest or Casuist?
Why sleep the Watchman's answers to that Godwin? I beg you will not delay to alter, if you
mean to keep, those last lines I sent you. Do that, & read these for your pains:--

TO THE POET COWPER

Cowper, I thank my God that thou art heal'd! Thine was the sorest malady of all; And I am sad
to think that it should light Upon the worthy head! But thou art heal'd, And thou art yet,
we trust, the destin'd man, Born to reanimate the Lyre, whose chords Have slumber'd, and have
idle lain so long, To the immortal sounding of whose strings Did Milton frame the stately-paced
verse; Among whose wires with lighter finger playing, Our elder bard, Spenser, a gentle name,
The Lady Muses' dearest darling child, Elicited the deftest tunes yet heard In Hall or Bower,
taking the delicate Ear Of Sydney, & his peerless Maiden Queen.

Thou, then, take up the mighty Epic strain, Cowper, of England's Bards, the wisest & the best.

1796.

I have read your climax of praises in those 3 reviews. These mighty spouters-out of panegyric
waters have, 2 of 'em, scattered their spray even upon me! & the waters are cooling & refreshing.
Prosaically, the Monthly Reviewers have made indeed a large article of it, & done you justice.
The Critical have, in their wisdom, selected not the very best specimens, & notice not, except
as one name on the muster-roll, the "Religious Musings." I suspect Master Dyer to have been
the writer of that article, as the substance of it was the very remarks & the very language
he used to me one day. I fear you will not accord entirely with my sentiments of Cowper, as
exprest above, (perhaps scarcely just), but the poor Gentleman has just recovered from his
Lunacies, & that begets pity, & pity love, and love admiration, & then it goes hard with People
but they lie! Have you read the Ballad called "Leonora," in the second Number of the "Monthly
Magazine"? If you have !!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is another fine song, from the same author (Berger),
in the 3d No., of scarce inferior merit; & (vastly below these) there are some happy specimens
of English hexameters, in an imitation of Ossian, in the 5th No. For your Dactyls I am sorry
you are so sore about 'em--a very Sir Fretful! In good troth, the Dactyls are good Dactyls,
but their measure is naught. Be not yourself "half anger, half agony" if I pronounce your darling
lines not to be the best you ever wrote--you have written much.

For the alterations in those lines, let 'em run thus:

I may not come a pilgrim, to the Banks
of Avon, lucid stream, to taste the wave     (inspiring wave) was too
which Shakspere drank, our British Helicon;      common place.
or with mine eye, &c., &c.
To muse, in tears, on that mysterious Youth, &c.    (better than "drop
                                                        a tear")

Then the last paragraph alter thus

                                              better refer to my own
Complaint begone, begone unkind reproof,      "complaint" solely than
Take up, my song, take up a merrier strain,   half to that and half to
For yet again, & lo! from Avon's vales,       Chatterton, as in your
Another mistrel cometh! youth endeared,     copy, which creates a
God & good angels &c., as before              confusion--"ominous
                                              fears" &c.

Have a care, good Master poet, of the Statute de Contumelia. What do you mean by calling Madame
Mara harlot & naughty things? The goodness of the verse would not save you in a court of Justice.
But are you really coming to town?

Coleridge, a gentleman called in London lately from Bristol, inquired whether there were any
of the family of a Mr. Chambers living--this Mr. Chambers he said had been the making of a
friend's fortune who wished to make some return for it. He went away without seeing her. Now,
a Mrs. Reynolds, a very intimate friend of ours, whom you have seen at our house, is the only
daughter, & all that survives, of Mr. Chambers--& a very little supply would be of service
to her, for she married very unfortunately, & has parted with her husband. Pray find out this
Mr. Pember (for that was the gentleman's friend's name), he is an attorney, & lives at Bristol.
Find him out, & acquaint him with the circumstances of the case, & offer to be the medium of
supply to Mrs. Reynolds, if he chuses to make her a present. She is in very distrest circumstances.
This last circumstance induced me to write so soon again--I have not further to add--Our loves
to Sara.

Thursday. C. LAMB.

[The passage at the beginning, before "Let us prose," together with the later passages in the
same manner, refers to the poem in the preceding letter, which in slightly different form is
printed in editions of Lamb as "Lines to Sara and Her Samuel." To complete the sense of the
letter one should compare the text of the poem in Vol. IV.

Coleridge had just received a suggestion, through Dr. Beddoes of Bristol, that he should replace
Grey, the late co-editor (with James Perry) of the Morning Chronicle. It came to nothing; but
Coleridge had told Lamb and had asked him to look out a house in town for him.

Dr. Kenrick's "Falstaff's Wedding," 1760, was a continuation of Shakespeare's "Henry IV."

We do not know what were the last lines that Lamb had sent to Coleridge. The lines to Cowper
were printed in the Monthly Magazine for December, 1796.

Coleridge's Poems were reviewed in the Monthly Review, June, 1796, with no mention of Lamb.
The Critical Review for the same month said of Lamb's effusions: "These are very beautiful."

Burger's "Leonora," which was to have such an influence upon English literature (it was the
foundation of much of Sir Walter Scott's poetry), was translated from the German by William
Taylor of Norwich in 1790 and printed in the Monthly Magazine in March, 1796. Scott at once
made a rival version. The other fine song, in the April Monthly Magazine, was "The Lass of
Fair Wone."

The mention of the Statute de Contumelia seems to refer to the "Lines Composed in a Concert-Room,"
which were first printed in the Morning Post, September 24, 1799, but must have been written
earlier. Madame Mara (1749-1833) is not mentioned by name in the poem, but being one of the
principal singers of the day Lamb probably fastened the epithet upon her by way of pleasantry;
or she may have been referred to in the version of the lines which Lamb had seen.

The passage about Mr. Chambers is not now explicable; but we know that Mrs. Reynolds was Lamb's
schoolmistress, probably when he was very small, and before he went to William Bird's Academy,
and that in later life he allowed her a pension of L30 a year until her death.

Between this and the next letter came, in all probability, a number of letters to Coleridge
which have been lost.

It seems the young Lady had been once before, in her earlier years, deranged, from the harassing
fatigues of too much business.--As her carriage towards her mother was ever affectionate in
the extreme, it is believed that to the increased attentiveness, which her parents' infirmities
called for by day and night, is to be attributed the present insanity of this ill-fated young
woman.

It has been stated in some of the Morning Papers, that she has an insane brother also in confinement--this
is without foundation.

The Jury of course brought in their Verdict, Lunacy.

In the Whitehall Evening Post the first part of the account is the same, but the end is as
follows:--

The above unfortunate young person is a Miss Lamb, a mantua-maker, in Little Queen-street,
Lincoln's-inn-fields. She has been, since, removed to Islington mad-house.

Mr. Norris of the Blue-Coat School has been confounded with Randal Norris of the Inner Temple,
another friend of the Lambs, but is not, I think, the same.

The reference to the poetry and Coleridge's publication of it shows that Lamb had already been
invited to contribute to the second edition of Coleridge's Poems. The words "and never" in
the original have a line through them which might mean erasure, but, I think, does not.

"Your own judgment..." Mrs. Coleridge had just become a mother: David Hartley Coleridge was
born on September 19. I have seen her.

[A word perhaps on Lamb's salary might be fitting here. For the first three years, from joining
the East India House on April 5, 1792, he received nothing. This probationary period over,
he was given L40 for the year 1795-1796. This, however, was raised to L70 in 1796 and there
were means of adding to it a little, by extra work and by a small holiday grant. In 1797 it
was L80, in 1799 L90, and from that time until 1814 it rose by L10 every second year.

Samuel Le Grice was the younger brother of Valentine Le Grice. Both were at Christ's Hospital
with Lamb and Coleridge and are mentioned in the Elia essay on the school.

[This letter is the only one in which Lamb speaks freely of his mother. He dwells on her memory
in Blank Verse, 1798, but in later years he mentioned her in his writings only twice, in the
Elia essays "New Year's Eve" and "My First Play," and then very indirectly: probably from the
wish to spare his sister pain, although Talfourd tells us that Mary Lamb spoke of her mother
often. Compare the poem on page 110.

In a letter written by Mary Lamb to Sarah Stoddart on September 21, 1803, there is further
light on Mrs. Lamb's want of sympathetic understanding of certain characters.

The references at the beginning are to Coleridge's idea of joining Perry on the Morning Chronicle;
of teaching Mrs. Evans' children; of establishing a school at Derby, on the suggestion of Dr.
Crompton; and finally of moving from Bristol to settle down in a cottage at Nether Stowey,
and support himself by husbandry and literature.]

LETTER 11

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

Oct. 24th, 1796. [Monday.]

Coleridge, I feel myself much your debtor for that spirit of confidence and friendship which
dictated your last letter. May your soul find peace at last in your cottage life! I only wish
you were but settled. To instance now in your last letter--you say, "it is by the press [sic],
that God hath given finite spirits both evil and good (I suppose you mean simply bad men and
good men), a portion as it were of His Omnipresence!" Now, high as the human intellect comparatively
will soar, and wide as its influence, malign or salutary, can extend, is there not, Coleridge,
a distance between the Divine Mind and it, which makes such language blasphemy? Again, in your
first fine consolatory epistle you say, "you are a temporary sharer in human misery, that you
may be an eternal partaker of the Divine Nature." What more than this do those men say, who
are for exalting the man Christ Jesus into the second person of an unknown Trinity,--men, whom
you or I scruple not to call idolaters? Man, full of imperfections, at best, and subject to
wants which momentarily remind him of dependence; man, a weak and ignorant being, "servile"
from his birth "to all the skiey influences," with eyes sometimes open to discern the right
path, but a head generally too dizzy to pursue it; man, in the pride of speculation, forgetting
his nature, and hailing in himself the future God, must make the angels laugh. Let us learn
to think humbly of ourselves, and rejoice in the appellation of "dear children," "brethren,"
and "co-heirs with Christ of the promises," seeking to know no further.

I am not insensible, indeed I am not, of the value of that first letter of yours, and I shall
find reason to thank you for it again and again long after that blemish in it is forgotten.
It will be a fine lesson of comfort to us, whenever we read it; and read it we often shall,
Mary and I.

Accept our loves and best kind wishes for the welfare of yourself and wife, and little one.
Nor let me forget to wish you joy on your birthday so lately past; I thought you had been older.
My kind thanks and remembrances to Lloyd. God love us all, and may He continue to be the father
and the friend of the whole human race!

Sunday Evening. C. LAMB.

[It is interesting to notice that with these letters Lamb suddenly assumes a gravity, independence
and sense of authority that hitherto his correspondence has lacked. The responsibility of the
household seems to have awakened his extraordinary common sense and fine understanding sense
of justice. Previously he had ventured to criticise only Coleridge's literary exercises; he
places his finger now on conduct too.

Coleridge's "last letter" has not been preserved; but the "first fine consolatory epistle"
is printed above.

This letter contains the first mention of Charles Lloyd (1775-1839), who was afterwards to
be for a while so intimately associated with Lamb. Charles Lloyd was the son of a Quaker banker
of Birmingham. He had published a volume of poems the year before and had met Coleridge when
that magnetic visionary had visited Birmingham to solicit subscribers for The Watchman early
in 1796. The proposition that Lloyd should live with Coleridge and become in a way his pupil
was agreed to by his parents, and in September he accompanied the philosopher to Nether Stowey
a day or so after David Hartley's birth, all eager to begin domestication and tutelage. Lloyd
was a sensitive, delicate youth, with an acute power of analysis and considerable grasp of
metaphysical ideas. No connection ever began more amiably. He was, I might add, by only two
days Lamb's junior.]

LETTER 12

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE Oct. 28th, 1796.

My dear Friend, I am not ignorant that to be a partaker of the Divine Nature is a phrase to
be met with in Scripture: I am only apprehensive, lest we in these latter days, tinctured (some
of us perhaps pretty deeply) with mystical notions and the pride of metaphysics, might be apt
to affix to such phrases a meaning, which the primitive users of them, the simple fishermen
of Galilee for instance, never intended to convey. With that other part of your apology I am
not quite so well satisfied. You seem to me to have been straining your comparing faculties
to bring together things infinitely distant and unlike; the feeble narrow-sphered operations
of the human intellect and the everywhere diffused mind of Deity, the peerless wisdom of Jehovah.
Even the expression appears to me inaccurate--portion of omnipresence--omnipresence is an attribute
whose very essence is unlimitedness. How can omnipresence be affirmed of anything in part?
But enough of this spirit of disputatiousness. Let us attend to the proper business of human
life, and talk a little together respecting our domestic concerns. Do you continue to make
me acquainted with what you were doing, and how soon you are likely to be settled once for all.

I have satisfaction in being able to bid you rejoice with me in my sister's continued reason
and composedness of mind. Let us both be thankful for it. I continue to visit her very frequently,
and the people of the house are vastly indulgent to her; she is likely to be as comfortably
situated in all respects as those who pay twice or thrice the sum. They love her, and she loves
them, and makes herself very useful to them. Benevolence sets out on her journey with a good
heart, and puts a good face on it, but is apt to limp and grow feeble, unless she calls in
the aid of self-interest by way of crutch. In Mary's case, as far as respects those she is
with, 'tis well that these principles are so likely to co-operate. I am rather at a loss sometimes
for books for her,--our reading is somewhat confined, and we have nearly exhausted our London
library. She has her hands too full of work to read much, but a little she must read; for reading
was her daily bread. Have you seen Bowles's new poem on "Hope?" What character does it bear?
Has he exhausted his stores of tender plaintiveness? or is he the same in this last as in all
his former pieces? The duties of the day call me off from this pleasant intercourse with my
friend--so for the present adieu.

Now for the truant borrowing of a few minutes from business. Have you met with a new poem called
the "Pursuits of Literature?" From the extracts in the "British Review" I judge it to be a
very humorous thing; in particular I remember what I thought a very happy character of Dr.
Darwin's poetry. Among all your quaint readings did you ever light upon Walton's "Complete
Angler"? I asked you the question once before; it breathes the very spirit of innocence, purity,
and simplicity of heart; there are many choice old verses interspersed in it; it would sweeten
a man's temper at any time to read it; it would Christianise every discordant angry passion;
pray make yourself acquainted with it. Have you made it up with Southey yet? Surely one of
you two must have been a very silly fellow, and the other not much better, to fall out like
boarding-school misses; kiss, shake hands, and make it up?

When will he be delivered of his new epic? Madoc I think, is to be the name of it; though that
is a name not familiar to my ears. What progress do you make in your hymns? What Review are
you connected with? If with any, why do you delay to notice White's book? You are justly offended
at its profaneness; but surely you have undervalued its wit, or you would have been more loud
in its praises. Do not you think that in Slender's death and madness there is most exquisite
humour, mingled with tenderness, that is irresistible, truly Shakspearian? Be more full in
your mention of it. Poor fellow, he has (very undeservedly) lost by it; nor do I see that it
is likely ever to reimburse him the charge of printing, etc. Give it a lift, if you can. I
suppose you know that Allen's wife is dead, and he, just situated as he was, never the better,
as the worldly people say, for her death, her money with her children being taken off his hands.
I am just now wondering whether you will ever come to town again, Coleridge; 'tis among the
things I dare not hope, but can't help wishing. For myself, I can live in the midst of town
luxury and superfluity, and not long for them, and I can't see why your children might not
hereafter do the same. Remember, you are not in Arcadia when you are in the west of England,
and they may catch infection from the world without visiting the metropolis. But you seem to
have set your heart upon this same cottage plan; and God prosper you in the experiment! I am
at a loss for more to write about; so 'tis as well that I am arrived at the bottom of my paper.

God love you, Coleridge!--Our best loves and tenderest wishes await on you, your Sara, and
your little one.

C. L.

[Bowles's poem was "Hope, an allegorical sketch on slowly recovering from sickness." See note
on pages 78 and 79.

The Pursuits of Literature, was a literary satire in the form of dialogues in verse, garnished
with very outspoken notes, by Thomas James Mathias (1754?-1835), which appeared between 1794
and 1797.

Southey had returned from Portugal in the summer, when the quarrel between Coleridge and himself
revived; but about the time of Hartley's birth some kind of a reconciliation was patched up.
Madoc, as it happened, was not published until 1805, although in its first form it was completed
in 1797.

Writing to Charles Lloyd, sen., in December, 1796, Coleridge says that he gives his evenings
to his engagements with the Critical Review and New Monthly Magazine.

This is the passage in Falstaff's Letters describing Blender's death:--

DAVY TO SHALLOW

Master Abram is dead, gone, your Worship--dead! Master Abram! Oh! good your Worship, a's gone.--A'
never throve, since a' came from Windsor-- 'twas his death. I call'd him a rebel, your Worship--but
a' was all subject--a' was subject to any babe, as much as a King--a' turn'd, like as it were
the latter end of a lover's lute--a' was all peace and resignment--a' took delight in nothing
but his book of songs and sonnets--a' would go to the Stroud side under the large beech tree,
and sing, till 'twas quite pity of our lives to mark him; for his chin grew as long as a muscle--Oh!
a' sung his soul and body quite away--a' was lank as any greyhound, and had such a scent! I
hid his love-songs among your Worship's law-books; for I thought if a' could not get at them,
it might be to his quiet; but a' snuff'd 'em out in a moment.--Good your Worship, have the
wise woman of Brentfort secured--Master Abram may have been conjured--Peter Simple says, a'
never look'd up, after a' sent to the wise woman--Marry, a' was always given to look down afore
his elders; a' might do it, a' was given to it--your Worship knows it; but then 'twas peak
and pert with him--a' was a man again, marry, in the turn of his heel.--A' died, your Worship,
just about one, at the crow of the cock.--I thought how it was with him; for a' talk'd as quick,
aye, marry, as glib as your Worship; and a' smiled, and look'd at his own nose, and call'd
"Sweet Ann Page." I ask'd him if a' would eat--so a' bad us commend him to his Cousin Robert
(a' never call'd your Worship so before) and bade us get hot meat, for a' would not say nay
to Ann again.[*]--But a' never liv'd to touch it--a' began all in a moment to sing "Lovers
all, a Madrigal." 'Twas the only song Master Abram ever learnt out of book, and clean by heart,
your Worship--and so a' sung, and smiled, and look'd askew at his own nose, and sung, and sung
on, till his breath waxed shorter, and shorter, and shorter, and a' fell into a struggle and
died. I beseech your Worship to think he was well tended--I look'd to him, your Worship, late
and soon, and crept at his heel all day long, an it had been any fallow dog--but I thought
a' could never live, for a' did so sing, and then a' never drank with it--I knew 'twas a bad
sign--yea, a' sung, your Worship, marry, without drinking a drop.

LETTER 13

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE Nov. 8th, 1796.

My Brother, my Friend,--I am distrest for you, believe me I am; not so much for your painful,
troublesome complaint, which, I trust, is only for a time, as for those anxieties which brought
it on, and perhaps even now may be nursing its malignity. Tell me, dearest of my friends, is
your mind at peace, or has anything, yet unknown to me, happened to give you fresh disquiet,
and steal from you all the pleasant dreams of future rest? Are you still (I fear you are) far
from being comfortably settled? Would to God it were in my power to contribute towards the
bringing of you into the haven where you would be! But you are too well skilled in the philosophy
of consolation to need my humble tribute of advice; in pain and in sickness, and in all manner
of disappointments, I trust you have that within you which shall speak peace to your mind.
Make it, I entreat you, one of your puny comforts, that I feel for you, and share all your
griefs with you. I feel as if I were troubling you about little things; now I am going to resume
the subject of our last two letters, but it may divert us both from unpleasanter feelings to
make such matters, in a manner, of importance. Without further apology, then, it was not that
I did not relish, that I did not in my heart thank you for, those little pictures of your feelings
which you lately sent me, if I neglected to mention them. You may remember you had said much
the same things before to me on the same subject in a former letter, and I considered those
last verses as only the identical thoughts better clothed; either way (in prose or verse) such
poetry must be welcome to me. I love them as I love the Confessions of Rousseau, and for the
same reason: the same frankness, the same openness of heart, the same disclosure of all the
most hidden and delicate affections of the mind: they make me proud to be thus esteemed worthy
of the place of friend-confessor, brother-confessor, to a man like Coleridge. This last is,
I acknowledge, language too high for friendship; but it is also, I declare, too sincere for
flattery. Now, to put on stilts, and talk magnificently about trifles--I condescend, then,
to your counsel, Coleridge, and allow my first Sonnet (sick to death am I to make mention of
my sonnets, and I blush to be so taken up with them, indeed I do)--I allow it to run thus,
"Fairy Land" &c. &c., as I [? you] last wrote it.

The Fragments I now send you I want printed to get rid of 'em; for, while they stick burr-like
to my memory, they tempt me to go on with the idle trade of versifying, which I long--most
sincerely I speak it--I long to leave off, for it is unprofitable to my soul; I feel it is;
and these questions about words, and debates about alterations, take me off, I am conscious,
from the properer business of my life. Take my sonnets once for all, and do not propose any
re-amendments, or mention them again in any shape to me, I charge you. I blush that my mind
can consider them as things of any worth. And pray admit or reject these fragments, as you
like or dislike them, without ceremony. Call 'em Sketches, Fragments, or what you will, but
do not entitle any of my things Love Sonnets, as I told you to call 'em; 'twill only make me
look little in my own eyes; for it is a passion of which I retain nothing; 'twas a weakness,
concerning which I may say, in the words of Petrarch (whose life is now open before me), "if
it drew me out of some vices, it also prevented the growth of many virtues, filling me with
the love of the creature rather than the Creator, which is the death of the soul." Thank God,
the folly has left me for ever; not even a review of my love verses renews one wayward wish
in me; and if I am at all solicitous to trim 'em out in their best apparel, it is because they
are to make their appearance in good company. Now to my fragments. Lest you have lost my Grandame,
she shall be one. 'Tis among the few verses I ever wrote (that to Mary is another) which profit
me in the recollection. God love her,--and may we two never love each other less!

These, Coleridge, are the few sketches I have thought worth preserving; how will they relish
thus detached? Will you reject all or any of them? They are thine: do whatsoever thou listest
with them. My eyes ache with writing long and late, and I wax wondrous sleepy; God bless you
and yours, me and mine! Good night.

                                C. LAMB.

I will keep my eyes open reluctantly a minute longer to tell you, that I love you for those
simple, tender, heart-flowing lines with which you conclude your last, and in my eyes best,
sonnet (so you call 'em),

"So, for the mother's sake, the child was dear, And dearer was the mother for the child."

Cultivate simplicity, Coleridge, or rather, I should say, banish elaborateness; for simplicity
springs spontaneous from the heart, and carries into daylight its own modest buds and genuine,
sweet, and clear flowers of expression. I allow no hot-beds in the gardens of Parnassus. I
am unwilling to go to bed, and leave my sheet unfilled (a good piece of night-work for an idle
body like me), so will finish with begging you to send me the earliest account of your complaint,
its progress, or (as I hope to God you will be able to send me) the tale of your recovery,
or at least amendment. My tenderest remembrances to your Sara.--

Once more good night.

[Coleridge, on November 2, had begun to suffer from his lifelong enemy, neuralgia, the result
largely of worry concerning his future, so many of his projects having broken down. He was
subduing it with laudanum--the beginning of that fatal habit.

We do not know what were the verses which Coleridge had sent Lamb, possibly the three sonnets
on the birth of Hartley, the third of which is referred to below.

Lamb's decision in September to say or hear no more of his own poetry here breaks down. The
reference to the Fairy Land sonnet is only partially explained by the parallel version which
I printed on page 25; for "Fairy Land" was Coleridge's version. Either Lamb had made a new
version, substituting "Fairy Land" for "Faery," or he wrote, "I allow it to run thus: Fairy
Land, &c., &c., as you last wrote it." When reprinted, however, it ran as Lamb originally wished.
The other fragments were those afterwards included in Coleridge's Poems, second edition, 1797.

"Love Sonnets." Lamb changed his mind again on this subject, and yet again.

Coleridge's last of the three sonnets on the birth of Hartley was entitled "Sonnet to a Friend
[Charles Lloyd] who asked how I felt when the Nurse first presented my Infant to me." It closed
with the lines which Lamb copies.]

LETTER 14

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

Nov. 14th, 1796.

Coleridge, I love you for dedicating your poetry to Bowles. I mean to inscribe them to my sister.

[It seems to have been Coleridge's intention to dedicate the second edition of his Poems to
Bowles; but he changed his mind and dedicated it to his brother, the Rev. George Coleridge.
A sonnet to Bowles was included in the volume, a kind of sub-dedication of the other sonnets,
but it had appeared also in the 1796 volume.

Lamb's instructions concerning his share in the 1797 volume were carried out, except that the
sub-title was omitted.

The quotations "merrier days" ("happier days") and "wanderings with a fair-hair'd maid" are
from Lamb's own sonnets; those in lines 9 and 10 from Dryden's Elegy on Mrs. Killigrew.

Coleridge had paid in the summer a long-deferred visit of reconciliation to his family at Ottery
St. Mary.]

LETTER 15

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[P.M. December 2, 1796 (Friday).]

I have delay'd writing thus long, not having by me my copy of your poems, which I had lent.
I am not satisfied with all your intended omissions. Why omit 40: 63: 84: above all, let me
protest strongly against your rejecting the "Complaint of Ninathoma," 86. The words, I acknowledge,
are Ossian's, but you have added to them the "Music of Caril." If a vicarious substitute be
wanting, sacrifice (and 'twill be a piece of self-denial too) the Epitaph on an Infant, of
which its Author seems so proud, so tenacious. Or, if your heart be set on perpetuating the
four-line-wonder, I'll tell you what [to] do: sell the copywright of it at once to a country
statuary; commence in this manner Death's prime poet laureat; and let your verses be adopted
in every village round instead of those hitherto famous ones "Afflictions sore long time I
bore, Physicians were in vain". I have seen your last very beautiful poem in the Monthly Magazine--write
thus, and you most generally have written thus, and I shall never quarrel with you about simplicity.
With regard to my lines "Laugh all that weep," etc.--I would willingly sacrifice them, but
my portion of the volume is so ridiculously little, that in honest truth I can't spare them.
As things are, I have very slight pretensions to participate in the title-page.--White's book
is at length reviewed in the Monthly; was it your doing, or Dyer's to whom I sent him? Or rather
do you not write in the Critical? for I observed, in an Article of this Month's a line quoted
out of that sonnet on Mrs. Siddons "with eager wond'ring and perturb'd delight"--and a line
from that sonnet would not readily have occurred to a stranger. That sonnet, Coleridge, brings
afresh to my mind the time when you wrote those on Bowles, Priestly, Burke--'twas 2 Christmases
ago, and in that nice little smoky room at the Salutation, which is even now continually presenting
itself to my recollection, with all its associated train of pipes, tobacco, Egghot, welch Rabbits,
metaphysics and Poetry.

Are we NEVER to meet again? How differently I am circumstanced now--I have never met with any
one, never shall meet with any one, who could or can compensate me for the loss of your society--I
have no one to talk all these matters about to--I lack friends, I lack books to supply their
absence. But these complaints ill become me: let me compare my present situation, prospects,
and state of mind, with what they were but 2 months back--but 2 months. O my friend, I am in
danger of forgetting the awful lessons then presented to me--remind me of them; remind me of
my Duty. Talk seriously with me when you do write. I thank you, from my heart I thank you,
for your sollicitude about my Sister. She is quite well,--but must not, I fear, come to live
with us yet a good while. In the first place, because at present it would hurt her, and hurt
my father, for them to be together: secondly from a regard to the world's good report, for
I fear, I fear, tongues will be busy whenever that event takes place. Some have hinted, one
man has prest it on me, that she should be in perpetual confinement--what she hath done to
deserve, or the necessity of such an hardship, I see not; do you? I am starving at the India
house, near 7 o'clock without my dinner, and so it has been and will be almost all the week.
I get home at night o'erwearied, quite faint,--and then to CARDS with my father, who will not
let me enjoy a meal in peace--but I must conform to my situation, and I hope I am, for the
most part, not unthankful.

I told you, I do not approve of your omissions. Neither do I quite coincide with you in your
arrangements: I have not time to point out a better, and I suppose some self-associations of
your own have determined their place as they now stand. Your beginning indeed with the Joan
of Arc lines I coincide entirely with: I love a splendid Outset, a magnificent Portico; and
the Diapason is Grand--the Religious Musings-- when I read them, I think how poor, how unelevated,
unoriginal, my blank verse is, "Laugh all that weep" especially, where the subject demanded
a grandeur of conception: and I ask what business they have among yours--but Friendship covereth
a multitude of defects. Why omit 73? At all events, let me plead for those former pages,--40.
63. 84. 86. I should like, for old acquaintance sake, to spare 62. 119 would have made a figure
among Shenstone's Elegies: you may admit it or reject, as you please. In the Man of Ross let
the old line stand as it used: "wine-cheer'd moments" much better than the lame present one.
94, change the harsh word "foodful" into "dulcet" or, if not too harsh, "nourishing." 91, "moveless":
is that as good as "moping"?--8, would it not read better omitting those 2 lines last but 6
about Inspiration? I want some loppings made in the Chatterton; it wants but a little to make
it rank among the finest irregular Lyrics I ever read. Have you time and inclination to go
to work upon it--or is it too late--or do you think it needs none? Don't reject those verses
in one of your Watchmen--"Dear native brook," &c.--nor, I think, those last lines you sent
me, in which "all effortless" is without doubt to be preferred to "inactive." If I am writing
more than ordinarily dully, 'tis that I am stupified with a tooth-ache. 37, would not the concluding
lines of the 1st paragraph be well omitted--& it go on "So to sad sympathies" &c.? In 40, if
you retain it, "wove" the learned Toil is better than "urge," which spoils the personification.
Hang it, do not omit 48. 52. 53. What you do retain tho', call sonnets for God's sake, and
not effusions,--spite of your ingenious anticipation of ridicule in your Preface. The last
5 lines of 50 are too good to be lost, the rest is not much worth. My tooth becomes importunate--I
must finish. Pray, pray, write to me: if you knew with what an anxiety of joy I open such a
long packet as you last sent me, you would not grudge giving a few minutes now and then to
this intercourse (the only intercourse, I fear we two shall ever have), this conversation,
with your friend--such I boast to be called.

God love you and yours.

Write to me when you move, lest I direct wrong.

Has Sara no poems to publish? Those lines 129 are probably too light for the volume where the
Religious Musings are--but I remember some very beautiful lines addrest by somebody at Bristol
to somebody at London.

God bless you once more.

C. LAMB.

Thursday Night.

[This letter refers to the preparation of Coleridge's second edition of his Poems. "Why omit
40, 63, 84?"--these were "Absence," "To the Autumnal Moon" and the imitation from Ossian.

Lamb applied the first two lines to a sucking pig in his Elia essay on "Roast Pig" many years
later.

Coleridge's very beautiful poem in the Monthly Magazine (for October) was "Reflections on Entering
into Active Life," beginning, "Low was our pretty cot."

Lamb's lines, "Laugh all that weep," I cannot find. We learn later that they were in blank verse.

Falstaff's Letters was reviewed in the Monthly Review for November, 1796, very favourably.
The article was quite possibly by Coleridge.

The sonnet on Mrs. Siddons was written by Lamb and Coleridge together when Coleridge was in
London at the end of 1794, and it formed one of a series of sonnets on eminent persons printed
in the Morning Chronicle, of which those on Bowles, Priestley and Burke were others. The quotation
from it was in an article in the November Critical Review on the "Musae Etonenses."

"One man has prest it on me." There is reason to suppose that this was John Lamb, the brother.

As it happened Coleridge did not begin his second edition with the "Joan of Arc" lines, but
with the "Ode to the New Year." The "Religious Musings" brought Coleridge's part of the volume
to a close.

The poem on page 73 was "In the Manner of Spenser." The poems on pages 40, 63, 84, we know;
that on page 86 was "The Complaint of Ninathoma." "To Genevieve" was on page 62. That on page
119 was "To a Friend in Answer to a Melancholy Letter." Coleridge never restored the phrase
"wine-cheer'd moments" to "The Man of Ross." He did not change "foodful" to "dulcet" in "To
an Infant." He did not alter "moveless" to "moping" in "The Young Ass." He left the Inspiration
passage as it was in the "Monody on Chatterton." Not that he disregarded all Lamb's advice,
as a comparison of the 1796 and 1797 editions of the Poems will show.

The poem "Dear native brook" was the sonnet "To the River Otter." Coleridge took Lamb's counsel.
The poem containing the phrase "all effortless" was that "Addressed to a Young Man of Fortune"
(Charles Lloyd). Coleridge did not include it. The poem on page 37 was "To a Young Lady with
a Poem on the French Revolution." Nos. 48, 52 and 53 were the sonnets to Priestley, Kosciusko
and Fayette. The last five lines of 50 were in the sonnet to Sheridan. The lines on page 129
were Sara's verses "The Silver Thimble." None of these were reprinted in 1797. The beautiful
lines addressed from somebody at Bristol to somebody at London were those from Sara Coleridge
to Lamb, referred to on page 33. Coleridge persisted in the use of the word "effusion".]

LETTER 16

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[Dated at end: Dec. 5, 1796.]

To a young Lady going out to India

Hard is the heart, that does not melt with Ruth When care sits cloudy on the brow of Youth,
When bitter griefs the female bosom swell And Beauty meditates a fond farewell To her loved
native land, and early home, In search of peace thro' "stranger climes to roam."[*]

The Muse, with glance prophetic, sees her stand, Forsaken, silent Lady, on the strand Of farthest
India, sickening at the war Of waves slow-beating, dull upon the shore Stretching, at gloomy
intervals, her eye O'er the wide waters vainly to espy The long-expected bark, in which to
find Some tidings of a world she has left behind.

In that sad hour shall start the gushing tear For scenes her childhood loved, now doubly dear,
In that sad hour shall frantic memory awake Pangs of remorse for slighted England's sake, And
for the sake of many a tender tye Of Love or Friendship pass'd too lightly by. Unwept, unpitied,
midst an alien race, And the cold looks of many a stranger face, How will her poor heart bleed,
and chide the day, That from her country took her far away.

[Footnote: Bowles. ["The African," line 27.]]

[Lamb has struck his pen through the foregoing poem.]

Coleridge, the above has some few decent [lines in] it, and in the paucity of my portion of
your volume may as well be inserted; I would also wish to retain the following if only to perpetuate
the memory of so exquisite a pleasure as I have often received at the performance of the tragedy
of Douglas, when Mrs. Siddons has been the Lady Randolph. Both pieces may be inserted between
the sonnets and the sketches--in which latter, the last leaf but one of them, I beg you to
alter the words "pain and want" to "pain and grief," this last being a more familiar and ear-satisfying
combination. Do it I beg of you. To understand the following, if you are not acquainted with
the play, you should know that on the death of Douglas his mother threw herself down a rock;
and that at that time Scotland was busy in repelling the Danes.

THE TOMB OF DOUGLAS See the Tragedy of that name When her son, her Douglas died, To the steep
rock's fearful side Fast the frantic mother hied.

O'er her blooming warrior dead Many a tear did Scotland shed, And shrieks of long and loud
lament From her Grampian hills she sent.

Like one awakening from a trance, She met the shock of Lochlin's lance.           Denmark On
her rude invader foe Return'd an hundred fold the blow. Drove the taunting spoiler home: Mournful
thence she took her way To do observance at the tomb, Where the son of Douglas [lay],

Round about the tomb did go In solemn state and order slow, Silent pace, and black attire,
Earl, or Knight, or good Esquire, Who e'er by deeds of valour done In battle had high honors
won; Whoe'er in their pure veins could trace The blood of Douglas' noble race.

With them the flower of minstrels came, And to their cunning harps did frame In doleful numbers
piercing rhimes, Such strains as in the olden times Had soothed the spirit of Fingal Echoing
thro' his fathers' Hall.

"Scottish maidens, drop a tear O'er the beauteous Hero's bier. Brave youth and comely 'bove
compare; All golden shone his burnish'd hair; Valor and smiling courtesy Played in the sunbeams
of his eye. Closed are those eyes that shone so fair And stain'd with blood his yellow hair.

"Not a tear, I charge you, shed For the false Glenalvon dead; Unpitied let Glenalvon lie, Foul
stain to arms and chivalry."

"Behind his back the traitor came, And Douglas died without his fame." *"Bending warrior, o'er
thy grave, Young light of Scotland early spent! Thy country thee shall long lament, *Douglas
'Beautiful and Brave'! And oft to after times shall tell, In Hopes sweet prime my Hero fell."

[Lamb has struck his pen through the remainder.]

"Thane or Lordling, think no scorn Of the poor and lowly-born. In brake obscure or lonely dell
The simple flowret prospers well; The gentler virtues cottage-bred,                omitted
Thrive best beneath the humble shed. Low-born Hinds, opprest, obscure, Ye who patiently endure
To bend the knee and bow the head, And thankful eat another's bread Well may ye mourn your
best friend dead, Till Life with Grief together end: He would have been the poor man's friend."
"The Tomb of Douglas" was included in that volume. The poem in which the alteration "pain and
want" was to be made (but was not made, or was made and cancelled later) was "Fancy Employed
on Divine Subjects."

The "divine chit-chat of Cowper" was Coleridge's own phrase. It is a pretty circumstance that
Lamb and Cowper now share (with Keats) a memorial in Edmonton church.]

LETTER 17

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[Little Queen Street, Night of Dec. 9th,] 1796.

I am sorry I cannot now relish your poetical present as thoroughly as I feel it deserves; but
I do not the less thank Lloyd and you for it.

In truth, Coleridge, I am perplexed, & at times almost cast down. I am beset with perplexities.
The old hag of a wealthy relation, who took my aunt off our hands in the beginning of trouble,
has found out that she is "indolent and mulish"--I quote her own words--and that her attachment
to us is so strong that she can never be happy apart. The Lady, with delicate Irony, remarks
that, if I am not an Hypocrite, I shall rejoyce to receive her again; and that it will be a
means of making me more fond of home to have so dear a friend to come home to! The fact is,
she is jealous of my aunt's bestowing any kind recollections on us, while she enjoys the patronage
of her roof. She says she finds it inconsistent with her own "ease and tranquility" to keep
her any longer, & in fine summons me to fetch her home. Now, much as I should rejoyce to transplant
the poor old creature from the chilling air of such patronage, yet I know how straitend we
are already, how unable already to answer any demand which sickness or any extraordinary expence
may make. I know this, and all unused as I am to struggle with perplexities I am somewhat nonplusd,
to say no worse. This prevents me from a thorough relish of what Lloyd's kindness and yours
have furnished me with. I thank you tho from my heart, and feel myself not quite alone in the
earth.

Before I offer, what alone I have to offer, a few obvious remarks on the poems you sent me,
I can[not] but notice the odd coincidence of two young men, in one age, carolling their grandmothers.
Love--what L[loyd] calls "the feverish and romantic tye"--hath too long domineerd over all
the charities of home: the dear domestic tyes of father, brother, husband. The amiable and
benevolent Cowper has a beautiful passage in his "Task,"--some natural and painful reflections
on his deceased parents: and Hayley's sweet lines to his mother are notoriously the best things
he ever wrote.

I cannot but smile to see my Granny so gayly deck'd forth: tho', I think, whoever altered "thy"
praises to "her" praises, "thy" honoured memory to "her" honoured memory, did wrong--they best
exprest my feelings. There is a pensive state of recollection, in which the mind is disposed
to apostrophise the departed objects of its attachment, and, breaking loose from grammatical
precision, changes from the 1st to the 3rd, and from the 3rd to the 1st person, just as the
random fancy or the feeling directs. Among Lloyd's sonnets, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th, are
eminently beautiful. I think him too lavish of his expletives; the do's and did's, when they
occur too often, bring a quaintness with them along with their simplicity, or rather air of
antiquity which the patrons of them seem desirous of conveying.

The lines on Friday are very pleasing--"Yet calls itself in pride of Infancy woman or man,"
&c., "affection's tottering troop"--are prominent beauties. Another time, when my mind were
more at ease, I could be more particular in my remarks, and I would postpone them now, only
I want some diversion of mind. The Melancholy Man is a charming piece of poetry, only the "whys"
(with submission) are too many. Yet the questions are too good to be any of 'em omitted. For
those lines of yours, page 18, omitted in magazine, I think the 3 first better retain'd--the
3 last, which are somewhat simple in the most affronting sense of the word, better omitted:
to this my taste directs me--I have no claim to prescribe to you. "Their slothful loves and
dainty sympathies" is an exquisite line, but you knew that when you wrote 'em, and I trifle
in pointing such out. Tis altogether the sweetest thing to me you ever wrote--tis all honey.
"No wish profaned my overwhelmed heart, Blest hour, it was a Luxury to be"--I recognise feelings,
which I may taste again, if tranquility has not taken his flight for ever, and I will not believe
but I shall be happy, very happy again. The next poem to your friend is very beautiful: need
I instance the pretty fancy of "the rock's collected tears"--or that original line "pour'd
all its healthful greenness on the soul"?--let it be, since you asked me, "as neighbouring
fountains each reflect the whole"--tho' that is somewhat harsh; indeed the ending is not so
finish'd as the rest, which if you omit in your forthcoming edition, you will do the volume
wrong, and the very binding will cry out. Neither shall you omit the 2 following poems. "The
hour when we shall meet again," is fine fancy, tis true, but fancy catering in the Service
of the feeling--fetching from her stores most splendid banquets to satisfy her. Do not, do
not omit it. Your sonnet to the River Otter excludes those equally beautiful lines, which deserve
not to be lost, "as the tired savage," &c., and I prefer that copy in your Watchman. I plead
for its preference.

Another time, I may notice more particularly Lloyd's, Southey's, Dermody's Sonnets. I shrink
from them now: my teazing lot makes me too confused for a clear judgment of things, too selfish
for sympathy; and these ill-digested, meaningless remarks I have imposed on myself as a task,
to lull reflection, as well as to show you I did not neglect reading your valuable present.
Return my acknowledgments to Lloyd; you two appear to be about realising an Elysium upon earth,
and, no doubt, I shall be happier. Take my best wishes. Remember me most affectionately to
Mrs. C., and give little David Hartley--God bless its little heart!--a kiss for me. Bring him
up to know the meaning of his Christian name, and what that name (imposed upon him) will demand
of him.

C. LAMB.

God love you!

I write, for one thing, to say that I shall write no more till you send me word where you are,
for you are so soon to move.

My sister is pretty well, thank God. We think of you very often. God bless you: continue to
be my correspondent, and I will strive to fancy that this world is not "all barrenness."

[The poetical present, as the late Mr. Dykes Campbell pointed out in The Atheneum, June 13,
1891, consisted of Lloyd's Poems on the Death of Priscilla Farmer, to which Lamb had contributed
"The Grandame," and of a little privately-printed collection of poems by Coleridge and Lloyd,
which they had intended to publish, but did not. The pamphlet has completely vanished. In addition
to these two works the poetical present also comprised another privately-printed collection,
a little pamphlet of twenty-eight sonnets which Coleridge had arranged for the purpose of binding
up with those of Bowles. It included three of Bowles', four of Coleridge's, four of Lamb's,
four of Southey's, and the remainder by Dermody, Lloyd, Charlotte Smith, and others. A copy
of this pamphlet is preserved in the South Kensington Museum.

"The poems you sent me." This would be Lloyd's Poems on the Death of Priscilla Farmer. When
Lamb reprinted "The Grandame" in Coleridge's second edition, 1797, he put back the original text.

I now take up Mr. Dykes Campbell's comments on the letter, where it branches off from the Priscilla
Farmer volume to the vanished pamphlet of poems by Coleridge and Lloyd:--

Beginning with Lloyd's "Melancholy Man" (first printed in the Carlisle volume of 1795), he
[Lamb] passes to Coleridge's poem on leaving the honeymoon-cottage at Clevedon, "altogether
the sweetest thing to me," says Lamb, "you ever wrote." The verses had appeared in the Monthly
Magazine two months before.... That Lamb's counsel was followed to some extent may be gathered
from a comparison between the text of the magazine and that of 1797:--

                             "Once I saw
     (Hallowing his sabbath-day by quietness)
     A wealthy son of Commerce saunter by,
     Bristowa's citizen: he paus'd, and look'd,
     With a pleas'd sadness, and gazed all around,
     Then ey'd our Cottage, and gaz'd round again,
     And said, it was a blessed little place!
     And we were blessed!"
                               Monthly Magazine.
     And we were blessed."
                                     Poems, 1797.

It will be observed that Coleridge in 1797 inserted some lines which were not in the magazine.
They were probably restored from a MS. copy Lamb had previously seen, and if Coleridge did
not cancel all that Lamb wisely counselled, he certainly drew the sting of the "affronting
simplicity" by removing the word "little." The comical ambiguity of the Bristol man's exclamation
as first reported could hardly have failed to drive Lamb's dull care away for a moment or two.

[In] "the next poem to your friend," ... [Lamb is] speaking of Coleridge's lines "To Charles
Lloyd"--those beginning

     "A mount, not wearisome and bare and steep."

In the "forthcoming edition" the poet improved a little the barely tolerated line, making it
read,--

     "As neighb'ring fountains image, each the whole,"

but did not take Lamb's hint to omit the five which closed the poem. Lamb, however, got his
way--perhaps took it--when the verses were reprinted in 1803, in the volume he saw through
the press for Coleridge.

So wrote Lamb of these somewhat slender verses, but his friend had composed them "during illness
and in absence," and Lamb in his own heart-sickness and loneliness detected the reality which
underlay the conventionality of expression.

The second of the "2 following poems" was Coleridge's "Sonnet to the River Otter." The version
then before him "excludes," complains Lamb, "those equally beautiful lines which deserve not
to be lost, 'as the tir'd savage,' &c., and I prefer the copy in your Watchman. I plead for
its preference." This pleading ... was not responded to in the way Lamb wanted, but in the
appendix to the 1797 volume Coleridge printed the whole of the poem on an "Autumnal Evening,"
to which the "tir'd savage" properly belonged....

"Lloyd's, Southey's, Dermody's Sonnets." Lamb here refers to the third portion of the poetical
present--the twenty-eight sonnets to be bound up with those of Bowles. Thomas Dermody (1775-1802)
was an Irish poet of squalidly dissolute life.

I will get "Nature and Art,"--have not seen it yet--nor any of Jeremy Taylor's works.

[The reference to the bellman's verses (the bellman, or watchman, used to leave verses at the
houses on his beat at Easter as a reminder of his deserts) is not quite clear. Lamb evidently
had submitted for the new volume some lines which Coleridge would not pass--possibly the poem
in Letter No. 16.

Coleridge some time before had sent to Lamb the very sweet lines relative to Burns, under the
title, "To a Friend who had Declared His Intention of Writing no more Poetry."

"Did a very little baby." In the Appendix to Vol. I. of the 1847 edition of the Biog. Lit.,
Sara Coleridge writes, concerning children and domestic evenings, "'Did a very little babby
make a very great noise?' is the first line of a nursery song, in which Mr. Coleridge recorded
some of his experience on this recondite subject." The song has disappeared.

Nature and Art was Mrs. Inchbald's story, published in 1796. Lamb later became an enthusiast
for Jeremy Taylor.]

LETTER 19

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[Dated outside: Jan. 2, 1797.]

Your success in the higher species of the Ode is such, as bespeaks you born for atchievements
of loftier enterprize than to linger in the lowly train of songsters and sonneteurs. Sincerely
I think your Ode one of the finest I have read. The opening is in the spirit of the sublimest
allegory. The idea of the "skirts of the departing year, seen far onwards, waving on the wind"
is one of those noble Hints at which the Reader's imagination is apt to kindle into grand conceptions.
Do the words "impetuous" and "solemnize" harmonize well in the same line? Think and judge.
In the 2d strophe, there seems to be too much play of fancy to be consistent with that continued
elevation we are taught to expect from the strain of the foregoing. The parenthized line (by
the way I abominate parentheses in this kind of poetry) at the beginning of 7th page, and indeed
all that gradual description of the throes and pangs of nature in childbirth, I do not much
like, and those 4 first lines,--I mean "tomb gloom anguish and languish"--rise not above mediocrity.
In the Epode, your mighty genius comes again: "I marked ambition" &c. Thro' the whole Epod
indeed you carry along our souls in a full spring tide of feeling and imaginat'n. Here is the
"Storm of Music," as Cowper expresses it. Would it not be more abrupt "Why does the northern
Conqueress stay" or "where does the northern Conqueress stay"?--this change of measure, rather
than the feebler "Ah! whither", "Foul her life and dark her tomb, mighty army of the dead,
dance like deathflies" &c.: here is genius, here is poetry, rapid, irresistible. The concluding
line, is it not a personif: without use? "Nec deus intersit"--except indeed for rhyme sake.
Would the laws of Strophe and antistrophe, which, if they are as unchangeable, I suppose are
about as wise, [as] the Mede and Persian laws, admit of expunging that line altogether, and
changing the preceding one to "and he, poor madman, deemd it quenchd in endless night?"--fond
madman or proud madman if you will, but poor is more contemptuous. If I offer alterations of
my own to your poetry, and admit not yours in mine, it is upon the principle of a present to
a rich man being graciously accepted, and the same present to a poor man being considered as
in insult. To return--The Antistrophe that follows is not inferior in grandeur or original:
but is I think not faultless--e: g: How is Memory alone, when all the etherial multitude are
there? Reflect. Again "storiedst thy sad hours" is harsh, I need not tell you, but you have
gained your point in expressing much meaning in few words: "Purple locks and snow white glories"
"mild Arcadians ever blooming" "seas of milk and ships of amber" these are things the Muse
talks about when, to borrow H. Walpole's witty phrase, she is not finely-phrenzied, only a
little light-headed, that's all. "Purple locks." They may manage things differently in fairy
land, but your "golden tresses" are more to my fancy. The spirit of the Earth is a most happy
conceit, and the last line is one of the luckiest I ever heard--"and stood up beautiful before
the cloudy seat." I cannot enough admire it. 'Tis somehow picturesque in the very sound. The
2d Antistrophe (what is the meaning of these things?) is fine and faultless (or to vary the
alliteration and not diminish the affectation) beautiful and blameless. I only except to the
last line as meaningless after the preceding, and useless entirely--besides, why disjoin "nature
and the world" here, when you had confounded both in their pregnancy: "the common earth and
nature," recollect, a little before--And there is a dismal superfluity in the unmeaning vocable
"unhurld"--the worse, as it is so evidently a rhyme-fetch.--"Death like he dozes" is a prosaic
conceit--indeed all the Epode as far as "brother's corse" I most heartily commend to annihilation.
The enthusiast of the lyre should not be so feebly, so tediously, delineative of his own feelings;
'tis not the way to become "Master of our affections." The address to Albion is very agreeable,
and concludes even beautifully: "speaks safety to his island child"--"Sworded"--epithet I would
change for "cruel."

The immediately succeeding lines are prosaic: "mad avarice" is an unhappy combination; and
"the coward distance yet with kindling pride" is not only reprehensible for the antithetical
turn, but as it is a quotation: "safe distance" and "coward distance" you have more than once
had recourse to before--And the Lyric Muse, in her enthusiasm, should talk the language of
her country, something removed from common use, something "recent," unborrowed. The dreams
of destruction "soothing her fierce solitude," are vastly grand and terrific: still you weaken
the effect by that superfluous and easily-conceived parenthesis that finishes the page. The
foregoing image, few minds could have conceived, few tongues could have so cloath'd; "muttring
destempered triumph" &c. is vastly fine. I hate imperfect beginnings and endings. Now your
concluding stanza is worthy of so fine an ode. The beginning was awakening and striking; the
ending is soothing and solemn--Are you serious when you ask whether you shall admit this ode?
it would be strange infatuation to leave out your Chatterton; mere insanity to reject this.
Unless you are fearful that the splendid thing may be a means of "eclipsing many a softer satellite"
that twinkles thro' the volume. Neither omit the annex'd little poem. For my part, detesting
alliterations, I should make the 1st line "Away, with this fantastic pride of woe." Well may
you relish Bowles's allegory. I need only tell you, I have read, and will only add, that I
dislike ambition's name gilded on his helmet-cap, and that I think, among the more striking
personages you notice, you omitted the most striking, Remorse! "He saw the trees--the sun--then
hied him to his cave again"!!! The 2d stanza of mania is superfl: the 1st was never exceeded.
The 2d is too methodic: for her. With all its load of beauties, I am more affected with the
6 first stanzas of the Elegiac poem written during sickness. Tell me your feelings. If the
fraternal sentiment conveyed in the following lines will atone for the total want of anything
like merit or genius in it, I desire you will print it next after my other sonnet to my sister.

1797.

If you think the epithet "sooth" quaint, substitute "blest messenger." I hope you are printing
my sonnets, as I directed you--particularly the 2d. "Methinks" &c. with my last added 6 lines
at ye end: and all of 'em as I last made 'em.

This has been a sad long letter of business, with no room in it for what honest Bunyan terms
heart-work. I have just room left to congratulate you on your removal to Stowey; to wish success
to all your projects; to "bid fair peace" be to that house; to send my love and best wishes,
breathed warmly, after your dear Sara, and her little David Hartley. If Lloyd be with you,
bid him write to me: I feel to whom I am obliged primarily for two very friendly letters I
have received already from him. A dainty sweet book that "Art and Nature" is. I am at present
re-re-reading Priestley's examinat of the Scotch Drs: how the Rogue strings 'em up! three together!
You have no doubt read that clear, strong, humorous, most entertaining piece of reasoning.
If not, procure it, and be exquisitely amused. I wish I could get more of Priestley's works.
Can you recommend me to any more books, easy of access, such as circulating shops afford? God
bless you and yours.

Poor Mary is very unwell with a sore throat and a slight species of scarlet fever. God bless
her too.

Monday Morning, at Office.

[Coleridge had just published in quarto his Ode on the Departing Year. In order that Lamb's
letter may be intelligible it is necessary, I think, to give the text of this edition in full.
It will be found in the Appendix to this volume. Lamb returns to his criticism in the next letter.

The "annexed little poem" was that "Addressed to a Young Man of Fortune," which began, and
still begins, "Hence that fantastic wantonness of woe."

Bowies' allegory was the poem, "Hope, An Allegorical Sketch," recently published.

The poem was not included in the 1797 volume, but was printed in the Monthly Magazine, October,
1797. Coleridge had moved to his cottage at Nether Stowey on the last day of 1796.

I am completely reconciled to that second strophe, and wa[i]ve all objection. In spite of the
Grecian Lyrists, I persist on [in] thinking your brief personification of Madness useless;
reverence forbids me to say, impertinent. Golden locks and snow white glories are as incongruous
as your former, and if the great Italian painters, of whom my friend knows about as much as
the man in the moon, if these great gentlemen be on your side, I see no harm in retaining the
purple--the glories that I have observed to encircle the heads of saints and madonnas in those
old paintings have been mostly of a dirty drab-color'd yellow--a dull gambogium. Keep your
old line: it will excite a confused kind of pleasurable idea in the reader's mind, not clear
enough to be called a conception, nor just enough, I think, to reduce to painting. It is a
rich line, you say, and riches hide a many faults. I maintain, that in the 2d antist: you do
disjoin Nature and the world, and contrary to your conduct in the 2d strophe. "Nature joins
her groans"--joins with whom, a God's name, but the world or earth in line preceding? But this
is being over curious, I acknowledge. Nor did I call the last line useless, I only objected
to "unhurld." I cannot be made to like the former part of that 2d Epode; I cannot be made to
feel it, as I do the parallel places in Isaiah, Jeremy and Daniel. Whether it is that in the
present case the rhyme impairs the efficacy; or that the circumstances are feigned, and we
are conscious of a made up lye in the case, and the narrative is too long winded to preserve
the semblance of truth; or that lines 8. 9. 10. 14 in partic: 17 and 18 are mean and unenthusiastic;
or that lines 5 to 8 in their change of rhyme shew like art--I don't know, but it strikes me
as something meant to affect, and failing in its purpose. Remember my waywardness of feeling
is single, and singly stands opposed to all your friends, and what is one among many! This
I know, that your quotations from the prophets have never escaped me, and never fail'd to affect
me strongly. I hate that simile. I am glad you have amended that parenthesis in the account
of Destruction. I like it well now. Only utter [? omit] that history of child-bearing, and
all will do well. Let the obnoxious Epode remain, to terrify such of your friends as are willing
to be terrified. I think I would omit the Notes, not as not good per se, but as uncongenial
with the dignity of the Ode. Why is not your poem on Burns in the Monthly Magazine? I was much
disappointed. I have a pleasurable but confused remembrance of it.

When the little volume is printed, send me 3 or 4, at all events not more than 6 copies, and
tell me if I put you to any additional expence, by printing with you. I have no thought of
the kind, and in that case, must reimburse you. My epistle is a model of unconnectedness, but
I have no partic: subject to write on, and must proportion my scribble in some degree to the
increase of postage. It is not quite fair, considering how burdensome your correspondence from
different quarters must be, to add to it with so little shew of reason. I will make an end
for this evening. Sunday Even:--Farewell. Or are you doing any thing towards it? Mrs. C----
is no doubt well,--give my kindest respects to her.

[The criticisms contained in the first paragraph bear upon Coleridge's "Ode on the Departing
Year," which had already appeared twice, in the Cambridge Intelligencer and in a quarto issued
by Cottle, and was now being revised for the second edition of the Poems.

The personification of Madness was contained in the line, afterwards omitted:--

For still does Madness roam on Guilt's black dizzy height.

Lamb's objection to this line, considering his home circumstances at the time, was very natural.
In Antistrophe I. Coleridge originally said of the ethereal multitude in Heaven--

Whose purple Locks with snow-white Glories shone.

In the 1797 Poems the line ran--

Whose wreathed Locks with snow-white Glories shone;

and in the final version--

Whose locks with wreaths, whose wreaths with glories shone.

Coleridge must have supported his case, in the letter which Lamb is answering, by a reference
to the Italian painters.

Coleridge in the 1797 edition of his Poems made no alteration to meet Lamb's strictures. The
simile that Lamb hated is, I imagine, that of the soldier on the war field. "The history of
child-bearing" referred to is the passage at the end of Strophe II. To the quarto Coleridge
had appended various notes. In 1797 he had only three, and added an argument.

The reference to Merlin will be explained by a glance at the parallel sonnets above. Merlin
was entirely Coleridge's idea. A conjuror of that name was just then among London's attractions.

The "last sonnet," which was not the last in the 1797 volume, but the 6th, was that beginning
"If from my lips" (see first letter).

In connection with Lamb's question on the Stowey husbandry, the following quotation from a
letter from Coleridge to the Rev. J. P. Estlin, belonging to this period, is interesting;--

Our house is better than we expected--there is a comfortable bedroom and sitting-room for C.
Lloyd, and another for us, a room for Nanny, a kitchen, and out-house. Before our door a clear
brook runs of very soft water; and in the back yard is a nice well of fine spring water. We
have a very pretty garden, and large enough to find us vegetables and employment, and I am
already an expert gardener, and both my hands can exhibit a callum as testimonials of their
industry. We have likewise a sweet orchard.

Writing a little before this to Charles Lloyd, senior, Coleridge had said: "My days I shall
devote to the acquirement of practical husbandry and horticulture."

The poem on Burns was that "To a Friend [Lamb] who had Declared His Intention of Writing no
more Poetry." It was printed first in a Bristol paper and then in the Annual Anthology, 1800.

Priestley's remark is in the Dedication to John Lee, Esq., of Lincoln's Inn, of "A Free Discussion
of the Doctrines of Materialism and Philosophical Necessity in a Correspondence between Dr.
Price and Dr. Priestley," etc., included in Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit, Vol.
III., 1778. The discussion arose from the publication by Priestley of The Doctrine of Philosophical
Necessity Illustrated, which itself is an appendage to Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit.

Three lives at least of John Wesley were published in the two years following his death in
1791. Coleridge later studied Wesley closely, for he added valuable notes to Southey's life
(see the 1846 edition).

"A Berkleyan," i.e., a follower of Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753), who in his New Theory of Vision
and later works maintained that "what we call matter has no actual existence, and that the
impressions which we believe ourselves to receive from it are not, in fact, derived from anything
external to ourselves, but are produced within us by a certain disposition of the mind, the
immediate operation of God" (Benham's Dictionary of Religion).

Coleridge when sending Southey one version of his poem to Charles Lamb, entitled "This Lime-tree
Bower my Prison"

"A Necessarian." We should now say a fatalist.

Coleridge's work on the "Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion," which has before been
mentioned, was, if ever begun, never completed.]

LETTER 21

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[Dated at end: January 18, 1797.]

Dear Col,--You have learnd by this time, with surprise, no doubt, that Lloyd is with me in
town. The emotions I felt on his coming so unlooked for are not ill expressed in what follows,
& what, if you do not object to them as too personal, & to the world obscure, or otherwise
wanting in worth, I should wish to make a part of our little volume.

I shall be sorry if that vol comes out, as it necessarily must do, unless you print those very
schoolboyish verses I sent you on not getting leave to come down to Bristol last Summer. I
say I shall be sorry that I have addrest you in nothing which can appear in our joint volume.

So frequently, so habitually as you dwell on my thoughts, 'tis some wonder those thoughts came
never yet in Contact with a poetical mood--But you dwell in my heart of hearts, and I love
you in all the naked honesty of prose. God bless you, and all your little domestic circle--my
tenderest remembrances to your Beloved Sara, & a smile and a kiss from me to your dear dear
little David Hartley--The verses I refer to above, slightly amended, I have sent (forgetting
to ask your leave, tho' indeed I gave them only your initials) to the Month: Mag: where they
may possibly appear next month, and where I hope to recognise your Poem on Burns.

TO CHARLES LLOYD, AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR

Alone, obscure, without a friend, A cheerless, solitary thing, Why seeks my Lloyd the stranger
out? What offring can the stranger bring

Of social scenes, home-bred delights, That him in aught compensate may For Stowey's pleasant
winter nights, For loves & friendships far away?

In brief oblivion to forego Friends, such as thine, so justly dear, And be awhile with me content
To stay, a kindly loiterer, here--

For this a gleam of random joy, Hath flush'd my unaccustom'd cheek, And, with an o'er-charg'd
bursting heart, I feel the thanks, I cannot speak.

O! sweet are all the Muses' lays, And sweet the charm of matin bird-- 'Twas long, since these
estranged ears The sweeter voice of friend had heard.

The voice hath spoke: the pleasant sounds In memory's ear, in after time Shall live, to sometimes
rouse a tear, And sometimes prompt an honest rhyme.

For when the transient charm is fled, And when the little week is o'er, To cheerless, friendless
solitude When I return, as heretofore--

Long, long, within my aching heart, The grateful sense shall cherishd be; I'll think less meanly
of myself, That Lloyd will sometimes think on me.

1797.

O Col: would to God you were in London with us, or we two at Stowey with you all. Lloyd takes
up his abode at the Bull & Mouth Inn,--the Cat & Salutation would have had a charm more forcible
for me. O noctes caenaeque Deum! Anglice--Welch rabbits, punch, & poesy.

Should you be induced to publish those very schoolboyish verses, print 'em as they will occur,
if at all, in the Month: Mag: yet I should feel ashamed that to you I wrote nothing better.
But they are too personal, & almost trifling and obscure withal. Some lines of mine to Cowper
were in last Month: Mag: they have not body of thought enough to plead for the retaining of 'em.

My sister's kind love to you all.

C. LAMB.

[The verses to Lloyd were included in Coleridge's 1797 volume; but the verses concerning the
frustrated Bristol holiday were omitted. Concerning this visit to London Charles Lloyd wrote
to his brother Robert: "I left Charles Lamb very warmly interested in his favour, and have
kept up a regular correspondence with him ever since; he is a most interesting young man."
Only two letters from Lamb to Charles Lloyd have survived.

"We two"--Lamb and Lloyd. Not Lamb and his sister.]

LETTER 22

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[Begun Sunday, February 5, 1797. "Hail'd who might be near" (rather ludicrous again): "voiced
a sad and simple tale" I cannot say I know Colson, at least intimately. I once supped with
him & Allen. Lloyd has kindly left me for a keep-sake, John Woolman. You have read it, he says,
& like it. Will you excuse one short extract? I think it could not have escaped you:--"Small
treasure to a resigned mind is sufficient. How happy is it to be content with a little, to
live in humility, & feel that in us which breathes out this language--Abba! Father!"--I am
almost ashamed to patch up a letter in this miscellaneous sort; but I please myself in the
thought, that anything from me will be acceptable to you. I am rather impatient, childishly
so, to see our names affixed to the same common volume. Send me two, when it does come out;
2 will be enough--or indeed 1--but 2 better. I have a dim recollection that, when in town,
you were talking of the Origin of Evil as a most prolific subject for a long poem. Why not
adopt it, Coleridge? there would be room for imagination. Or the description (from a Vision
or Dream, suppose) of an Utopia in one of the planets (the Moon, for instance). Or a Five Days'
Dream, which shall illustrate, in sensible imagery, Hartley's 5 motives to conduct:--sensation
(1), imagination (2), ambition (3), sympathy (4), Theopathy (5). 1st banquets, music, etc.,
effeminacy,--and their insufficiency. 2d "beds of hyacinth & roses, where young Adonis oft
reposes;" "fortunate Isles;" "The pagan Elysium," etc., etc.; poetical pictures; antiquity
as pleasing to the fancy;--their emptiness, madness, etc. 3d warriors, poets; some famous,
yet more forgotten, their fame or oblivion now alike indifferent, pride, vanity, etc. 4th all
manner of pitiable stories, in Spenser-like verse--love--friendship, relationship, &c. 5th
Hermits--Christ and his apostles--martyrs--heaven--&c., etc. An imagination like yours, from
these scanty hints, may expand into a thousand great Ideas--if indeed you at all comprehend
my scheme, which I scarce do myself.

Monday Morn.--"A London letter. 9-1/2." Look you, master poet, I have remorse as well as another
man, & my bowels can sound upon occasion. But I must put you to this charge, for I cannot keep
back my protest, however ineffectual, against the annexing your latter lines to those former--this
putting of new wine into old bottles. This my duty done, I will cease from writing till you
invent some more reasonable mode of conveyance. Well may the "ragged followers of the nine"
set up for flocci-nauci-what-do-you-call-'em-ists! And I do not wonder that in their splendid
visions of Utopias in America they protest against the admission of those yellow-complexioned,
copper-color'd, white-liver'd Gentlemen, who never proved themselves their friends. Don't you
think your verses on a Young Ass too trivial a companion for the Religious Musings? "Scoundrel
monarch," alter that; and the Man of Ross is scarce admissible as it now stands curtailed of
its fairer half: reclaim its property from the Chatterton, which it does but encumber, & it
will be a rich little poem. I hope you expunge great part of the old notes in the new edition.
That, in particular, most barefaced unfounded impudent assertion, that Mr. Rogers is indebted
for his story to Loch Lomond, a poem by Bruce! I have read the latter. I scarce think you have.
Scarce anything is common to them both. The poor author of the Pleasures of Memory was sorely
hurt, Dyer says, by the accusation of unoriginality. He never saw the Poem. I long to read
your Poem on Burns; I retain so indistinct a memory of it. In what shape and how does it come
into public? As you leave off writing poetry till you finish your Hymns, I suppose you print
now all you have got by you. You have scarce enough unprinted to make a 2d volume with Lloyd.
Tell me all about it. What is become of Cowper? Lloyd told me of some verses on his mother.
If you have them by you, pray send 'em me. I do so love him! Never mind their merit. May be
I may like 'em--as your taste and mine do not always exactly indentify. Yours,

LAMB.

[Coleridge intended to print in his new edition the lines that he had contributed to Southey's
Joan of Arc, 1796, with certain additions, under the title "The Progress of Liberty; or, The
Visions of the Maid of Orleans." Lamb's criticisms are contained in this letter. Coleridge
abandoned his idea of including the poem in the 1797 edition, and the lines were not separately
published until 1817, in Sibylline Leaves, under the title "The Destiny of Nations."

"Montauban ... Roubigne." An illustration from Henry Mackenzie's novel Julia de Roubigne, 1777,
from which Lamb took hints, a little later, for the structure of part of his story Rosamund Gray.

Southey's new volume, which Coleridge had noticed, was his Poems, second edition, Vol. I.,
1797. The poem in question was "On My Own Miniature Picture taken at Two Years of Age."

Edward Fairfax's "Tasso" (Godfrey of Bulloigne, or the Recoverie of Jerusalem) was published
in 1600. John Hoole, a later translator, became principal auditor at the India House, and resigned
in 1786. He died in 1803.

Coleridge's dream was the poem called "The Raven."

Citizen John Thelwall (1764-1834), to whom many of Coleridge's early letters are written, was
a Jacobin enthusiast who had gone to the Tower with Thomas Hardy and Home Tooke in 1794, but
was acquitted at his trial. At this time he was writing and lecturing on political subjects.
When, in 1818, Thelwall acquired The Champion Lamb wrote squibs for it against the Regent and
others.

Colson was perhaps Thomas Coulson, a friend of Sir Humphry Davy and the father of Walter Coulson
(born? 1794) who was called "The Walking Encyclopaedia," and was afterwards a friend of Hazlitt.

"To discipline your young noviciate soul." A line from "Religious Musings," 1796:--

I discipline my young noviciate thought.

"My poor old aunt." Lamb's lines on his Aunt Hetty repeat some of this praise; as also does
the Elia essay on "Christ's Hospital."

John Woolman (1720-1772), an American Quaker. His Works comprise A Journal of the Life, Gospel,
Labours, and Christian Experiences of that Faithful Minister of Jesus Christ, John Woolman,
and His Last Epistle and other Writings. Lamb often praised the book.

"A London letter, 9-1/2." A word on the postal system of those days may not be out of place.
The cost of the letter when a frank had not been procured was borne by the recipient. The rate
varied with the distance. The charge from London to Bridgewater in 1797 was sevenpence. Later
it was raised to ninepence and tenpence. No regular post was set up between Bridgewater and
Nether Stowey until 1808, when the cost of the carriage of a letter for the intervening nine
miles was twopence.

"Flocci." See note on page II.

"The Young Ass," early versions, ended thus:--

Soothe to rest The tumult of some Scoundrel Monarch's breast.

Coleridge changed the last line to--

The aching of pale Fashion's vacant breast.

Coleridge had asserted, in a 1796 note, that Rogers had taken the story of Florio in the Pleasures
of Memory from Michael Bruce's Loch Leven (not Loch Lomond). In the 1797 edition another note
made apology for the mistake.

Cowper's "Lines on the Receipt of my Mother's Picture out of Norfolk" had been written in the
spring of 1790. No, indeed you are not. 'Tis the privilege of friendship to talk nonsense,
and to have her nonsense re-spected.--Yours ever,

C. LAMB.

[Lamb's Aunt Hetty, Sarah Lamb, was buried at St. James's, Clerkenwell, on February 13, 1797.

"As poor Burns expresses it."

"Turning Quaker." Lamb refers to the Peel meeting-house in John Street, Clerkenwell. Lamb afterwards
used the story of the wit in the Ella essay "A Quaker's Meeting." In his invocation to the
reader he here foreshadows his Elian manner.

"Falkland" is in Sheridan's comedy "The Rivals" (see Act II., Scene i).]

LETTER 24

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

April 7th, 1797.

Your last letter was dated the 10th February; in it you promised to write again the next day.
At least, I did not expect so long, so unfriend-like, a silence. There was a time, Col., when
a remissness of this sort in a dear friend would have lain very heavy on my mind, but latterly
I have been too familiar with neglect to feel much from the semblance of it. Yet, to suspect
one's self overlooked and in the way to oblivion, is a feeling rather humbling; perhaps, as
tending to self-mortification, not unfavourable to the spiritual state. Still, as you meant
to confer no benefit on the soul of your friend, you do not stand quite clear from the imputation
of unkindliness (a word by which I mean the diminutive of unkindness). Lloyd tells me he has
been very ill, and was on the point of leaving you. I addressed a letter to him at Birmingham:
perhaps he got it not, and is still with you, I hope his ill-health has not prevented his attending
to a request I made in it, that he would write again very soon to let me know how he was. I
hope to God poor Lloyd is not very bad, or in a very bad way. Pray satisfy me about these things.
And then David Hartley was unwell; and how is the small philosopher, the minute philosopher?
and David's mother? Coleridge, I am not trifling, nor are these matter-of-fact [?course] questions
only. You are all very dear and precious to me; do what you will, Col., you may hurt me and
vex me by your silence, but you cannot estrange my heart from you all. I cannot scatter friendship[s]
like chuck-farthings, nor let them drop from mine hand like hour-glass sand. I have two or
three people in the world to whom I am more than indifferent, and I can't afford to whistle
them off to the winds. By the way, Lloyd may have told you about my sister. I told him. If
not, I have taken her out of her confinement, and taken a room for her at Hackney, and spend
my Sundays, holidays, etc., with her. She boards herself. In one little half year's illness,
and in such an illness of such a nature and of such consequences! to get her out into the world
again, with a prospect of her never being so ill again--this is to be ranked not among the
common blessings of Providence. May that merciful God make tender my heart, and make me as
thankful, as in my distress I was earnest, in my prayers. Congratulate me on an ever-present
and never-alienable friend like her. And do, do insert, if you have not lost, my dedication.
It will have lost half its value by coming so late. If you really are going on with that volume,
I shall be enabled in a day or two to send you a short poem to insert. Now, do answer this.
Friendship, and acts of friendship, should be reciprocal, and free as the air; a friend should
never be reduced to beg an alms of his fellow. Yet I will beg an alms; I entreat you to write,
and tell me all about poor Lloyd, and all of you. God love and preserve you all.

C. LAMB.

[Lloyd's domestication with Coleridge had been intermittent. It began in September, 1796; in
November Lloyd was very ill; in December Coleridge told Mr. Lloyd that he would retain his
son no longer as pupil but merely as a lodger and friend; at Christmas Charles Lloyd was at
Birmingham; in January he was in London; in March he was ill again and his experiment with
Coleridge ended.

Philosopher.

LETTER 25

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

April 15th, 1797.

A VISION OF REPENTANCE

I saw a famous fountain in my dream, Where shady pathways to a valley led; A weeping willow
lay upon that stream, And all around the fountain brink were spread Wide branching trees, with
dark green leaf rich clad, Forming a doubtful twilight desolate and sad.

The place was such, that whoso enter'd in Disrobed was of every earthly thought, And straight
became as one that knew not sin, Or to the world's first innocence was brought; Enseem'd it
now, he stood on holy ground, In sweet and tender melancholy wrapt around.

A most strange calm stole o'er my soothed sprite; Long time I stood, and longer had I staid,
When lo! I saw, saw by the sweet moonlight, Which came in silence o'er that silent shade, Where
near the fountain SOMETHING like DESPAIR Made of that weeping willow garlands for her hair.

And eke with painful fingers she inwove Many an uncouth stem of savage thorn-- "The willow
garland, that was for her Love, And these her bleeding temples would adorn." With sighs her
heart nigh burst--salt tears fast fell, As mournfully she bended o'er that sacred well.

To whom when I addrest myself to speak, She lifted up her eyes, and nothing said; The delicate
red came mantling o'er her cheek, And gathering up her loose attire, she fled To the dark covert
of that woody shade And in her goings seem'd a timid gentle maid.

Revolving in my mind what this should mean, And why that lovely Lady plained so; Perplex'd
in thought at that mysterious scene, And doubting if 'twere best to stay or go, I cast mine
eyes in wistful gaze around, When from the shades came slow a small and plaintive sound

"Psyche am I, who love to dwell In these brown shades, this woody dell, Where never busy mortal
came, Till now, to pry upon my shame.

"At thy feet what thou dost see The Waters of Repentance be, Which, night and day, I must augment
With tears, like a true penitent, If haply so my day of grace Be not yet past; and this lone
place, O'er-shadowy, dark, excludeth hence All thoughts but grief and penitence."

"Why dost thou weep, thou gentle maid! And wherefore in this barren shade Thy hidden thoughts
with sorrow feed? Can thing so fair repentance need?"

"Oh! I have done a deed of shame, And tainted is my virgin fame, And stain'd the beauteous
maiden white In which my bridal robes were dight."

"And who the promis'd spouse declare, And what those bridal garments were?"

"Severe and saintly righteousness Compos'd the clear white bridal dress; Jesus, the son of
Heaven's high King Bought with his blood the marriage ring.

"A wretched sinful creature, I Deem'd lightly of that sacred tye, Gave to a treacherous WORLD
my heart, And play'd the foolish wanton's part.

"Soon to these murky shades I came To hide from the Sun's light my shame-- And still I haunt
this woody dell, And bathe me in that healing well, Whose waters clear have influence From
sin's foul stains the soul to cleanse; And night and day I them augment With tears, like a
true Penitent, Until, due expiation made, And fit atonement fully paid, The Lord and Bridegroom
me present Where in sweet strains of high consent, God's throne before, the Seraphim Shall
chaunt the extatic marriage hymn."

"Now Christ restore thee soon"--I said, And thenceforth all my dream was fled.

The above you will please to print immediately before the blank verse fragments. Tell me if
you like it. I fear the latter half is unequal to the former, in parts of which I think you
will discover a delicacy of pencilling not quite un-Spenser-like. The latter half aims at the
measure, but has failed to attain the poetry, of Milton in his "Comus" and Fletcher in that
exquisite thing ycleped the "Faithful Shepherdess," where they both use eight-syllable lines.
But this latter half was finished in great haste, and as a task, not from that impulse which
affects the name of inspiration.

By the way, I have lit upon Fairfax's "Godfrey of Bullen" for half-a-crown. Rejoice with me.

Poor dear Lloyd! I had a letter from him yesterday; his state of mind is truly alarming. He
has, by his own confession, kept a letter of mine unopened three weeks, afraid, he says, to
open it, lest I should speak upbraidingly to him; and yet this very letter of mine was in answer
to one, wherein he informed me that an alarming illness had alone prevented him from writing.
You will pray with me, I know, for his recovery; for surely, Coleridge, an exquisiteness of
feeling like this must border on derangement. But I love him more and more, and will not give
up the hope of his speedy recovery, as he tells me he is under Dr. Darwin's regimen.

God bless us all, and shield us from insanity, which is "the sorest malady of all."

My kind love to your wife and child.

C. LAMB.

Pray write, now.

[I have placed the poem at the head from the text of Coleridge's Poems, 1797; but the version
of the letter very likely differed (see next letter for at least one alteration).

Fairfax's Godfrey of Bullen was his translation of Tasso, which is mentioned above.

Lloyd, who was undergoing one of those attacks of acute melancholia to which he was subject
all his life, had been sent to Lichfield where Erasmus Darwin had established a sanatorium.

"The sorest malady of all." From Lamb's lines to Cowper.]

LETTER 26

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

[Tuesday,] June 13th, 1797.

I stared with wild wonderment to see thy well-known hand again. It revived many a pleasing
recollection of an epistolary intercourse, of late strangely suspended, once the pride of my
life. Before I even opened thy letter, I figured to myself a sort of complacency which my little
hoard at home would feel at receiving the new-comer into the little drawer where I keep my
treasures of this kind. You have done well in writing to me. The little room (was it not a
little one?) at the Salutation was already in the way of becoming a fading idea! it had begun
to be classed in my memory with those "wanderings with a fair hair'd maid," in the recollection
of which I feel I have no property. You press me, very kindly do you press me, to come to Stowey;
obstacles, strong as death, prevent me at present; maybe I shall be able to come before the
year is out; believe me, I will come as soon as I can, but I dread naming a probable time.
It depends on fifty things, besides the expense, which is not nothing. Lloyd wants me to come
and see him; but, besides that you have a prior claim on me, I should not feel myself so much
at home with him, till he gets a house of his own. As to Richardson, caprice may grant what
caprice only refused, and it is no more hardship, rightly considered, to be dependent on him
for pleasure, than to lie at the mercy of the rain and sunshine for the enjoyment of a holiday:
in either case we are not to look for a suspension of the laws of nature. "Grill will be Grill."
Vide Spenser.

I could not but smile at the compromise you make with me for printing Lloyd's poems first;
but there is [are] in nature, I fear, too many tendencies to envy and jealousy not to justify
you in your apology. Yet, if any one is welcome to pre-eminence from me, it is Lloyd, for he
would be the last to desire it. So pray, let his name uniformly precede mine, for it would
be treating me like a child to suppose it could give me pain. Yet, alas! I am not insusceptible
of the bad passions. Thank God, I have the ingenuousness to be ashamed of them. I am dearly
fond of Charles Lloyd; he is all goodness, and I have too much of the world in my composition
to feel myself thoroughly deserving of his friendship.

Lloyd tells me that Sheridan put you upon writing your tragedy. I hope you are only Coleridgeizing
when you talk of finishing it in a few days. Shakspeare was a more modest man; but you best
know your own power.

Of my last poem you speak slightingly; surely the longer stanzas were pretty tolerable; at
least there was one good line in it,

"Thick-shaded trees, with dark green leaf rich clad."

To adopt your own expression, I call this a "rich" line, a fine full line. And some others
I thought even beautiful. Believe me, my little gentleman will feel some repugnance at riding
behind in the basket; though, I confess, in pretty good company. Your picture of idiocy, with
the sugar-loaf head, is exquisite; but are you not too severe upon our more favoured brethren
in fatuity? Lloyd tells me how ill your wife and child have been. I rejoice that they are better.
My kindest remembrances and those of my sister. I send you a trifling letter; but you have
only to think that I have been skimming the superficies of my mind, and found it only froth.
Now, do write again; you cannot believe how I long and love always to hear about you. Yours,
most affectionately,

CHARLES LAMB.

Monday Night.

["Little drawer where I keep ..." Lamb soon lost the habit of keeping any letters, except Manning's.

"Wanderings with a fair-hair'd maid." Lamb's own line. See sonnet quoted above.

Lamb's visit to Stowey was made in July, as we shall see.

"Grill will be Grill." See the Faerie Queene, Book II., Canto 12, Stanzas 86 and 87. "Let Gryll
be Gryll" is the right text.

Lloyd had joined the poetical partnership, and his poems were to precede Lamb's in the 1797
volume. "Lloyd's connections," Coleridge had written to Cottle, "will take off a great many
[copies], more than a hundred."

Coleridge's tragedy was "Osorio," of which we hear first in March, 1797, when Coleridge tells
Cottle that Sheridan has asked him to write a play for Drury Lane. It was finished in October,
and rejected. In 1813, much altered, it was performed under its new title, "Remorse," and published
in book form. Lamb wrote the Prologue.

The "last poem" of which Lamb speaks was "The Vision of Repentance."

"Your picture of idiocy." Compare S. T. Coleridge to Thomas Poole, dated "Greta Hall, Oct.
5, 1801" (Thomas Poole and His Friends): "We passed a poor ideot boy, who exactly answered
my description; he

"'Stood in the sun, rocking his sugar-loaf head, And staring at a bough from morn to sunset,
See-sawed his voice in inarticulate noises.'"

See this passage, much altered, in "Remorse," II., I, 186-191. The lines do not occur in "Osorio,"
yet they, or something like them, must have been copied out by Coleridge for Lamb in June, 1797.]

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[Saturday,] June 24th, 1797.

Did you seize the grand opportunity of seeing Kosciusko while he was at Bristol? I never saw
a hero; I wonder how they look. I have been reading a most curious romance-like work, called
the "Life of John Buncle, Esq." 'Tis very interesting, and an extraordinary compound of all
manner of subjects, from the depth of the ludicrous to the heights of sublime religious truth.
There is much abstruse science in it above my cut and an infinite fund of pleasantry. John
Buncle is a famous fine man, formed in nature's most eccentric hour. I am ashamed of what I
write. But I have no topic to talk of. I see nobody, and sit, and read or walk, alone, and
hear nothing. I am quite lost to conversation from disuse; and out of the sphere of my little
family, who, I am thankful, are dearer and dearer to me every day, I see no face that brightens
up at my approach. My friends are at a distance; worldly hopes are at a low ebb with me, and
unworldly thoughts are not yet familiarised to me, though I occasionally indulge in them. Still
I feel a calm not unlike content. I fear it is sometimes more akin to physical stupidity than
to a heaven-flowing serenity and peace. What right have I to obtrude all this upon you? what
is such a letter to you? and if I come to Stowey, what conversation can I furnish to compensate
my friend for those stores of knowledge and of fancy, those delightful treasures of wisdom,
which I know he will open to me? But it is better to give than to receive; and I was a very
patient hearer and docile scholar in our winter evening meetings at Mr. May's; was I not, Col.?
What I have owed to thee, my heart can ne'er forget.

God love you and yours. C. L.

Saturday.

[Thaddeus Kosciusko (1746-1817), the Polish patriot, to whom Coleridge had a sonnet in his
Poems, 1796, visited England and America after being liberated from prison on the accession
of Paul I., and settled in France in 1798.

The Life of John Buncle, Esq., a book which Lamb (and also Hazlitt) frequently praised, is
a curious digressive novel, part religious, part roystering, and wholly eccentric and individual,
by Thomas Amory, published, Vol. I., in 1756, and Vol. II., in 1766.

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[No date. ? June 29, 1797.]

I discern a possibility of my paying you a visit next week. May I, can I, shall I, come so
soon? Have you room for me, leisure for me, and are you all pretty well? Tell me all this honestly--immediately.
And by what day--coach could I come soonest and nearest to Stowey? A few months hence may suit
you better; certainly me as well. If so, say so. I long, I yearn, with all the longings of
a child do I desire to see you, to come among you--to see the young philosopher, to thank Sara
for her last year's invitation in person--to read your tragedy--to read over together our little
book--to breathe fresh air--to revive in me vivid images of "Salutation scenery." There is
a sort of sacrilege in my letting such ideas slip out of my mind and memory. Still that knave
Richardson remaineth--a thorn in the side of Hope, when she would lean towards Stowey. Here
I will leave off, for I dislike to fill up this paper, which involves a question so connected
with my heart and soul, with meaner matter or subjects to me less interesting. I can talk,
as I can think, nothing else.

LETTER 29

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[No date. Probably July 19 or 26, 1797.]

I am scarcely yet so reconciled to the loss of you, or so subsided into my wonted uniformity
of feeling, as to sit calmly down to think of you and write to you. But I reason myself into
the belief that those few and pleasant holidays shall not have been spent in vain. I feel improvement
in the recollection of many a casual conversation. The names of Tom Poole, of Wordsworth and
his good sister, with thine and Sara's, are become "familiar in my mouth as household words."
You would make me very happy, if you think W. has no objection, by transcribing for me that
inscription of his. I have some scattered sentences ever floating on my memory, teasing me
that I cannot remember more of it. You may believe I will make no improper use of it. Believe
me I can think now of many subjects on which I had planned gaining information from you; but
I forgot my "treasure's worth" while I possessed it. Your leg is now become to me a matter
of much more importance--and many a little thing, which when I was present with you seemed
scarce to indent my notice, now presses painfully on my remembrance. Is the Patriot come yet?
Are Wordsworth and his sister gone yet? I was looking out for John Thelwall all the way from
Bridgewater, and had I met him, I think it would have moved almost me to tears. You will oblige
me too by sending me my great-coat, which I left behind in the oblivious state the mind is
thrown into at parting--is it not ridiculous that I sometimes envy that great-coat lingering
so cunningly behind?--at present I have none--so send it me by a Stowey waggon, if there be
such a thing, directing for C. L., No. 45, Chapel-Street, Pentonville, near London. But above
all, that Inscription!--it will recall to me the tones of all your voices--and with them many
a remembered kindness to one who could and can repay you all only by the silence of a grateful
heart. I could not talk much, while I was with you, but my silence was not sullenness, nor
I hope from any bad motive; but, in truth, disuse has made me awkward at it. I know I behaved
myself, particularly at Tom Poole's, and at Cruikshank's, most like a sulky child; but company
and converse are strange to me. It was kind in you all to endure me as you did.

Are you and your dear Sara--to me also very dear, because very kind--agreed yet about the management
of little Hartley? and how go on the little rogue's teeth? I will see White to-morrow, and
he shall send you information on that matter; but as perhaps I can do it as well after talking
with him, I will keep this letter open.

My love and thanks to you and all of you.

C. L.

Wednesday Evening.

[Lamb spent a week at Nether Stowey in July, 1797. Coleridge tells Southey of this visit in
a letter written in that month: "Charles Lamb has been with me for a week. He left me Friday
morning. The second day after Wordsworth [who had just left Racedown, near Crewkerne, for Alfoxden,
near Stowey] came to me, dear Sara accidentally emptied a skillet of boiling milk on my foot,
which confined me during the whole time of C. Lamb's stay and still prevents me from all walks
longer than a furlong." This is the cause of Lamb's allusion to Coleridge's leg, and it also
produced Coleridge's poem beginning "This lime-tree bower my prison," addressed to Lamb, which
opens as follows, the friends in the fourth line being Lamb, Wordsworth and Dorothy Wordsworth.
(Wordsworth was then twenty-seven.

Tom Poole was Thomas Poole (1765-1837), a wealthy tanner, and Coleridge's friend, correspondent
and patron, who lived at Stowey.

The Patriot and John Thelwall were one. See note on page 93.

"That inscription," The "Lines left upon a Seat in a Yew Tree," written in 1795. Lamb refers
to it again in 1815.

The address at Pentonville is the first indication given by Lamb that he has left Little Queen
Street. We last saw him there for certain in Letter 17 on December 9. The removal had been
made probably at the end of 1796.

John Cruikshank, a neighbour of Coleridge, had married a Miss Bude on the same day that Coleridge
married Sara Flicker.

Of the business connected with White we know nothing.]

LETTER 30

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[P.M. August 24, 1797.]

Poor Charles Lloyd came to me about a fortnight ago. He took the opportunity of Mr. Hawkes
coming to London, and I think at his request, to come with him. It seemed to me, and he acknowledged
it, that he had come to gain a little time and a little peace, before he made up his mind.
He was a good deal perplexed what to do--wishing earnestly that he had never entered into engagements
which he felt himself unable to fulfill, but which on Sophia's account he could not bring himself
to relinquish. I could give him little advice or comfort, and feeling my own inability painfully,
eagerly snatched at a proposal he made me to go to Southey's with him for a day or two. He
then meant to return with me, who could stay only one night. While there, he at one time thought
of going to consult you, but changed his intention and stayed behind with Southey, and wrote
an explicit letter to Sophia. I came away on the Tuesday, and on the Saturday following, last
Saturday, receiv'd a letter dated Bath, in which he said he was on his way to Birmingham,--that
Southey was accompanying him,--and that he went for the purpose of persuading Sophia to a Scotch
marriage--I greatly feared, that she would never consent to this, from what Lloyd had told
me of her character. But waited most anxiously the result. Since then I have not had one letter.
For God's sake, if you get any intelligence of or from Chas Lloyd, communicate it, for I am
much alarmed.

C. LAMB.

I wrote to Burnett what I write now to you,--was it from him you heard, or elsewhere?--

He said if he had come to you, he could never have brought himself to leave you. In all his
distress he was sweetly and exemplarily calm and master of himself,--and seemed perfectly free
from his disorder.--

How do you all at?

[This letter is unimportant, except in showing Lamb's power of sharing his friends' troubles.
Charles Lloyd was not married to Sophia Pemberton, of Birmingham, until 1799; nothing rash
being done, as Lamb seems to think possible. The reference to Southey, who was at this time
living at Burton, in Hampshire, throws some light on De Quincey's statement, in his "Autobiography,"
that owing to the objection of Miss Pemberton's parents to the match, Lloyd secured the assistance
of Southey to carry the lady off.

Burnett was George Burnett (1776?-1811), one of Coleridge's fellow Pantisocratists, whom we
shall meet later.

The "he" of the second postscript is not Burnett, but Lloyd.]

LETTER 31

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE [About September 20, 1797.]

WRITTEN A TWELVEMONTH AFTER THE EVENTS

[Friday next, Coleridge, is the day on which my mother died.]

Alas! how am I changed! where be the tears, The sobs and forced suspensions of the breath,
And all the dull desertions of the heart With which I hung o'er my dear mother's corse? Where
be the blest subsidings of the storm Within; the sweet resignedness of hope Drawn heavenward,
and strength of filial love, In which I bow'd me to my Father's will? My God and my Redeemer,
keep not thou My heart in brute and sensual thanklessness Seal'd up, oblivious ever of that
dear grace, And health restor'd to my long-loved friend.

Long loved, and worthy known! Thou didst not keep Her soul in death. O keep not now, my Lord,
Thy servants in far worse--in spiritual death And darkness--blacker than those feared shadows
O' the valley all must tread. Lend us thy balms, Thou dear Physician of the sin-sick soul,
And heal our cleansed bosoms of the wounds With which the world hath pierc'd us thro' and thro'!
Give us new flesh, new birth; Elect of heaven May we become, in thine election sure Contain'd,
and to one purpose steadfast drawn-- Our souls' salvation.

                Thou and I, dear friend,
With filial recognition sweet, shall know
One day the face of our dear mother in heaven,
And her remember'd looks of love shall greet
With answering looks of love, her placid smiles
Meet with a smile as placid, and her hand
With drops of fondness wet, nor fear repulse.

Be witness for me, Lord, I do not ask Those days of vanity to return again, (Nor fitting me
to ask, nor thee to give), Vain loves, and "wanderings with a fair-hair'd maid;" (Child of
the dust as I am), who so long My foolish heart steep'd in idolatry, And creature-loves. Forgive
it, O my Maker! If in a mood of grief, I sin almost In sometimes brooding on the days long
past, (And from the grave of time wishing them back), Days of a mother's fondness to her child--
Her little one! Oh, where be now those sports And infant play-games? Where the joyous troops
Of children, and the haunts I did so love? 0 my companions! O ye loved names Of friend, or
playmate dear, gone are ye now. Gone divers ways; to honour and credit some: And some, I fear,
to ignominy and shame! I only am left, with unavailing grief One parent dead to mourn, and
see one live Of all life's joys bereft, and desolate: Am left, with a few friends, and one
above The rest, found faithful in a length of years, Contented as I may, to bear me on, T'
the not unpeaceful evening of a day Made black by morning storms.

The following I wrote when I had returned from C. Lloyd, leaving him behind at Burton with
Southey. To understand some of it, you must remember that at that time he was very much perplexed
in mind.

A stranger and alone, I past those scenes We past so late together; and my heart Felt something
like desertion, as I look'd Around me, and the pleasant voice of friend Was absent, and the
cordial look was there No more, to smile on me. I thought on Lloyd-- All he had been to me!
And now I go Again to mingle with a world impure; With men who make a mock of holy things,
Mistaken, and of man's best hope think scorn. The world does much to warp the heart of man;
And I may sometimes join its idiot laugh: Of this I now complain not. Deal with me, Omniscient
Father, as Thou judgest best, And in Thy season soften thou my heart. I pray not for myself:
I pray for him Whose soul is sore perplexed. Shine thou on him, Father of Lights! and in the
difficult paths Make plain his way before him: his own thoughts May he not think--his own ends
not pursue-- So shall he best perform Thy will on earth. Greatest and Best, Thy will be ever ours!

The former of these poems I wrote with unusual celerity t'other morning at office. I expect
you to like it better than anything of mine; Lloyd does, and I do myself.

You use Lloyd very ill, never writing to him. I tell you again that his is not a mind with
which you should play tricks. He deserves more tenderness from you.

For myself, I must spoil a little passage of Beaumont and Fletcher to adapt it to my feelings:--

                              "I am prouder
That I was once your friend, tho' now forgot,
Than to have had another true to me."

If you don't write to me now, as I told Lloyd, I shall get angry, and call you hard names--Manchineel
and I don't know what else. I wish you would send me my great-coat. The snow and the rain season
is at hand, and I have but a wretched old coat, once my father's, to keep 'em off, and that
is transitory.

"When time drives flocks from field to fold, When ways grow foul and blood gets cold,"

I shall remember where I left my coat. Meet emblem wilt thou be, old Winter, of a friend's
neglect--cold, cold, cold! Remembrance where remembrance is due.

C. LAMB.

[The two poems included in this letter were printed in Blank Verse, a volume which Lamb and
Lloyd issued in 1798.

Coleridge had written to Lloyd, we know, as late as July, because he sent him a version of
the poem "This Lime-tree Bower, my Prison;" but a coolness that was to ripen into positive
hostility had already begun. Of this we shall see more later.

The passage from Beaumont and Fletcher is in "The Maid's Tragedy" (Act II., Scene I), where
Aspatia says to Amintor:--

Thus I wind myself Into this willow garland, and am prouder That I was once your love (though
now refus'd) Than to have had another true to me.

The scene is in Lamb's Dramatic Specimens.

The reference to Manchineel is explained by a passage in Coleridge's dedication of his 1797
volume, then just published, to his brother, the Rev. George Coleridge, where, speaking of
the friends he had known, he says:--

and some most false, False and fair-foliag'd as the Manchineel, Have tempted me to slumber
in their shade

--the manchineel being a poisonous West Indian tree.

C. L.

[The first letter that has been preserved since September of the previous year. In the meantime
Lamb had begun to work on Rosamund Gray, probably upon an impulse gained from the visit to
Stowey, and was also arranging to join Lloyd, who was living in London with White, in the volume
of poems to be called Blank Verse. Southey, writing many years later to Edward Moxon, said
of Lloyd and White: "No two men could be imagined more unlike each other; Lloyd had no drollery
in his nature; White seemed to have nothing else. You will easily understand how Lamb could
sympathise with both."

The new calamity to which Lamb refers in this letter was probably a relapse in Mary Lamb's
condition. When he last mentioned her she was so far better as to be able to be moved into
lodgings at Hackney: all that good was now undone. Coleridge seems to have suggested that she
should visit Stowey.

It was about this time that Lamb wrote the poem "The Old Familiar Faces," which I quote below
in its original form, afterwards changed by the omission of the first four lines:--

THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES

Where are they gone, the old familiar faces?

I had a mother, but she died, and left me, Died prematurely in a day of horrors-- All, all
are gone, the old familiar faces.

I have been laughing, I have been carousing, Drinking late, sitting late, with my bosom cronies--
All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.

I have a friend, a kinder friend has no man. Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly; Left
him, to muse on the old familiar faces.

Ghost-like, I paced round the haunts of my childhood. Earth seem'd a desert I was bound to
traverse, Seeking to find the old familiar faces.

Friend of my bosom, thou more than a brother! Why wert not thou born in my father's dwelling?
So might we talk of the old familiar faces.

For some they have died, and some they have left me, And some are taken from me; all are departed;
All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.

January, 1798.

It is conjectured by Mr. J. A. Rutter, and there is much reason to believe it a right theory,
especially when taken into connection with the present letter, that Lloyd was the friend of
the fifth stanza and Coleridge the friend of the seventh. The italicised half line might refer
to "Anna," but, since she is mentioned in the fourth stanza, it more probably, I think, refers
to Mary Lamb, who, as we have seen, had been so ill as to necessitate removal from Hackney
into more special confinement again.

The letter was addressed to Coleridge at the Reverend A. Rowe's, Shrewsbury. Coleridge had
been offered the Unitarian pulpit at Shrewsbury and was on the point of accepting when he received
news of the annuity of L150 which Josiah and Thomas Wedgwood had settled upon him.

Between this letter and the next certainly came other letters to Coleridge, now lost, one of
which is referred to by Coleridge in the letter to Lamb quoted below.]

LETTER 33

CHARLES LAMB TO S. T. COLERIDGE

[No date. Early Summer, 1798.]

THESES QUAEDAM THEOLOGICAE

1. Whether God loves a lying Angel better than a true Man?

2. Whether the Archangel Uriel could affirm an untruth? and if he could whether he would?

3. Whether Honesty be an angelic virtue? or not rather to be reckoned among those qualities

To S. T. Coleridge.

[Lamb's last letter to Coleridge for two years. See note to the next letter.

Lamb's reading of Thomas Aquinas probably was at the base of his theses. William Godwin, in
his "History of Knowledge, Learning and Taste in Great Britain," which had run through some
years of the New Annual Register, cited, in 1786, a number of the more grotesque queries of
the old Schoolmen. Mr. Kegan Paul suggested that Lamb went to Godwin for his examination paper;
but I should think this very unlikely. Some of the questions hit Coleridge very hard.

This letter was first printed by Joseph Cottle in his Early Recollections, 1837, with the remark:
"Mr. Coleridge gave me this letter, saying, 'These young visionaries will do each other no
good.'" It marks an epoch in Lamb's life, since it brought about, or, at any rate, clinched,
the only quarrel that ever subsisted between Coleridge and himself.

The story is told in Charles Lamb and the Lloyds. Briefly, Lloyd had left Coleridge in the
spring of 1797; a little later, in a state of much perplexity, he had carried his troubles
to Lamb, and to Southey, between whom and Coleridge no very cordial feeling had existed for
some time, rather than to Coleridge himself, his late mentor. That probably fanned the flame.
The next move came from Coleridge. He printed in the Monthly Magazine for November, 1797, three
sonnets signed Nehemiah Higginbottom, burlesquing instances of "affectation of unaffectedness,"
and "puny pathos" in the poems of himself, of Lamb, and of Lloyd, the humour of which Lamb
probably did not much appreciate, since he believed in the feelings expressed in his verse,
while Lloyd was certainly unfitted to esteem it. Coleridge effected even more than he had contemplated,
for Southey took the sonnet upon Simplicity as an attack upon himself, which did not, however,
prevent him, a little later, from a similar exercise in ponderous humour under the too similar
name of Abel Shufflebottom.

In March, 1798, when a new edition of Coleridge's 1797 Poems was in contemplation, Lloyd wrote
to Cottle, the publisher, asking that he would persuade Coleridge to omit his (Lloyd's) portion,
a request which Coleridge probably resented, but which gave him the opportunity of replying
that no persuasion was needed for the omission of verses published at the earnest request of
the author.

Meanwhile a worse offence than all against Coleridge was perpetrated by Lloyd. In the spring
of 1798 was published at Bristol his novel, Edmund Oliver, dedicated to Lamb, in which Coleridge's
experiences in the army, under the alias of Silas Tomkyn Comberback, in 1793-1794, and certain
of Coleridge's peculiarities, including his drug habit, were utilised. Added to this, Lloyd
seems to have repeated both to Lamb and Southey, in distorted form, certain things which Coleridge
had said of them, either in confidence, or, at any rate, with no wish that they should be repeated;
with the result that Lamb actually went so far as to take sides with Lloyd against his older
friend. The following extracts from a letter from Coleridge to Lamb, which I am permitted by
Mr. Ernest Hartley Coleridge to print, carries the story a little farther:--

[Spring of 1798.]

Dear Lamb,--Lloyd has informed me through Miss Wordsworth that you intend no longer to correspond
with me. This has given me little pain; not that I do not love and esteem you, but on the contrary
because I am confident that your intentions are pure. You are performing what you deem a duty,
and humanly speaking have that merit which can be derived from the performance of a painful
duty. Painful, for you would not without struggles abandon me in behalf of a man [Lloyd] who,
wholly ignorant of all but your name, became attached to you in consequence of my attachment,
caught his from my enthusiasm, and learned to love you at my fireside, when often while I have
been sitting and talking of your sorrows and afflictions I have stopped my conversations and
lifted up wet eyes and prayed for you. No! I am confident that although you do not think as
a wise man, you feel as a good man.

From you I have received little pain, because for you I suffer little alarm. I cannot say this
for your friend; it appears to me evident that his feelings are vitiated, and that his ideas
are in their combination merely the creatures of those feelings. I have received letters from
him, and the best and kindest wish which, as a Christian, I can offer in return is that he
may feel remorse....

When I wrote to you that my Sonnet to Simplicity was not composed with reference to Southey,
you answered me (I believe these were the words): "It was a lie too gross for the grossest
ignorance to believe;" and I was not angry with you, because the assertion which the grossest
ignorance would believe a lie the Omniscient knew to be truth. This, however, makes me cautious
not too hastily to affirm the falsehood of an assertion of Lloyd's that in Edmund Oliver's
love-fit, leaving college, and going into the army he had no sort of allusion to or recollection
of my love-fit, leaving college, and going into the army, and that he never thought of my person
in the description of Oliver's person in the first letter of the second volume. This cannot
appear stranger to me than my assertion did to you, and therefore I will suspend my absolute
faith....

I have been unfortunate in my connections. Both you and Lloyd became acquainted with me when
your minds were far from being in a composed or natural state, and you clothed my image with
a suit of notions and feelings which could belong to nothing human. You are restored to comparative
saneness, and are merely wondering what is become of the Coleridge with whom you were so passionately
in love; Charles Lloyd's mind has only changed his disease, and he is now arraying his ci-devant
Angel in a flaming San Benito--the whole ground of the garment a dark brimstone and plenty
of little devils flourished out in black. Oh, me! Lamb, "even in laughter the heart is sad!"...

God bless you
      S. T. COLERIDGE.

One other passage. In a letter from Lloyd at Birmingham to Cottle, dated June, 1798, Lloyd
says, in response to Cottle's suggestion that he should visit Coleridge, "I love Coleridge,
and can forget all that has happened. Coleridge left for Germany in September.

"Schiller and swing in a wood."

Here should perhaps come Lamb's first letter to Robert Lloyd, not available for this edition,
but printed by Canon Ainger, and in Charles Lamb and the Lloyds, where it is dated October.
Lamb's first letter is one of advice, apparently in reply to some complaints of his position
addressed to him by Lloyd. A second and longer letter which, though belonging to August, 1798,
may be mentioned here, also counsels, commending the use of patience and humility. Lamb is
here seen in the character of a spiritual adviser. The letter is unique in his correspondence.

Robert Lloyd was a younger brother of Charles Lloyd, and Lamb had probably met him when on
his visit to Birmingham in the summer. The boy, then not quite twenty, was apprenticed to a
Quaker draper at Saffron Walden in Essex.]

LETTER 34

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Saturday, July 28th, 1798.

I am ashamed that I have not thanked you before this for the "Joan of Arc," but I did not know
your address, and it did not occur to me to write through Cottle. The poem delighted me, and
the notes amused me, but methinks she of Neufchatel, in the print, holds her sword too "like
a dancer." I sent your notice to Phillips, particularly requesting an immediate insertion,
but I suppose it came too late. I am sometimes curious to know what progress you make in that
same "Calendar:" whether you insert the nine worthies and Whittington? what you do or how you
can manage when two Saints meet and quarrel for precedency? Martlemas, and Candlemas, and Christmas,
are glorious themes for a writer like you, antiquity-bitten, smit with the love of boars' heads
and rosemary; but how you can ennoble the 1st of April I know not. By the way I had a thing
to say, but a certain false modesty has hitherto prevented me: perhaps I can best communicate
my wish by a hint,--my birthday is on the 10th of February, New Style; but if it interferes
with any remarkable event, why rather than my country should lose her fame, I care not if I
put my nativity back eleven days. Fine family patronage for your "Calendar," if that old lady
of prolific memory were living, who lies (or lyes) in some church in London (saints forgive
me, but I have forgot what church), attesting that enormous legend of as many children as days
in the year. I marvel her impudence did not grasp at a leap-year. Three hundred and sixty-five
dedications, and all in a family--you might spit in spirit on the oneness of Maecenas' patronage!

THESES QUAEDAM THEOLOGICAE

I

"Whether God loves a lying angel better than a true man?"

II

"Whether the archangel Uriel could knowingly affirm an untruth, and whether, if he could, he
would?"

III

"Whether honesty be an angelic virtue, or not rather belonging to that class of qualities which
the schoolmen term 'virtutes minus splendidae et hominis et terrae nimis participes?'"

IV

"Whether the seraphim ardentes do not manifest their goodness by the way of vision and theory?
and whether practice be not a sub-celestial, and merely human virtue?"

V

"Whether the higher order of seraphim illuminati ever sneer?"

VI

"Whether pure intelligences can love, or whether they love anything besides pure intellect?"

VIII

"Whether an 'immortal and amenable soul' may not come to be damned at last, and the man never
suspect it beforehand?"

Samuel Taylor C. had not deigned an answer; was it impertinent of me to avail myself of that
offered source of knowledge? Lloyd is returned to town from Ipswich where he has been with
his brother. He has brought home three acts of a Play which I have not yet read. The scene
for the most part laid in a Brothel. O tempora, O mores! but as friend Coleridge said when
he was talking bawdy to Miss ---- "to the pure all things are pure."

Wishing "Madoc" may be born into the world with as splendid promise as the second birth or
purification of the Maid of Neufchatel,--I remain yours sincerely,

C. LAMB.

I hope Edith is better; my kindest remembrances to her. You have a good deal of trifling to
forgive in this letter.

[This is Lamb's first letter to Southey that has been preserved. Probably others came before
it. Southey now becomes Lamb's chief correspondent for some months. In Canon Ainger's transcript
the letter ends with "Love and remembrances to Cottle."

Southey's Joan of Arc, second edition, had been published by Cottle in 1798. It has no frontispiece:
the print of Joan of Arc must have come separately.

Phillips was Sir Richard Phillips (1767-1840), editor of the Monthly Magazine and the publisher
satirised in Sorrow's Lavengro.

The Calendar ultimately became the Annual Anthology. Southey had at first an idea of making
it a poetical calendar or almanac.

"That old lady of prolific memory." Lamb is thinking, I imagine, of the story in Howell's Familiar
Letters (also in Evelyn's Diary) of the "Wonder of Nature" near the Hague. Howell seems to
have been convinced of the authenticity of the story by the spectacle of the christening basin
used by the family. The beggar, who spoke on the third day of the year, meant as many days
as had been in that year--three.

Edith was Southey's wife.]

LETTER 35

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Oct. 18th, 1798.

Dear Southey,--I have at last been so fortunate as to pick up Wither's Emblems for you, that
"old book and quaint," as the brief author of "Rosamund Gray" hath it; it is in a most detestable
state of preservation, and the cuts are of a fainter impression than I have seen. Some child,
the curse of antiquaries and bane of bibliopolical rarities, hath been dabbling in some of
them with its paint and dirty fingers, and in particular hath a little sullied the author's
own portraiture, which I think valuable, as the poem that accompanies it is no common one;
this last excepted, the Emblems are far inferior to old Quarles. I once told you otherwise,
but I had not then read old Q. with attention. I have picked up, too, another copy of Quarles
for ninepence!!! O tempora! O lectores!--so that if you have lost or parted with your own copy,
say so, and I can furnish you, for you prize these things more than I do. You will be amused,
I think, with honest Wither's "Supersedeas to all them whose custom it is, without any deserving,
to importune authors to give unto them their books." I am sorry 'tis imperfect, as the lottery
board annexed to it also is. Methinks you might modernise and elegantise this Supersedeas,
and place it in front of your "Joan of Arc," as a gentle hint to Messrs. Park, &c. One of the
happiest emblems and comicalest cuts is the owl and little chirpers, page 63.

Wishing you all amusement, which your true emblem-fancier can scarce fail to find in even bad
emblems, I remain your caterer to command,

C. LAMB.

Love and respects to Edith. I hope she is well. How does your Calendar prosper?

[This letter contains Lamb's first reference to Rosamund Gray, his only novel, which had been
published a little earlier in the year. "Wither's Emblems, an 'old book and quaint,'" was one
of the few volumes belonging to old Margaret, Rosamund's grandmother (Chapter I). See next
letter and note.

Wither's Emblems was published in 1635; Quarles' in the same year.

[The eclogue was "The Ruined Cottage," in which Joanna and her widowed mother are at first
as happy as Rosamund Gray and old blind Margaret. As in Lamb's story so in Southey's poem,
this state of felicity is overturned by a seducer.

"An old woman clothed in gray." This ballad still eludes research. Lamb says that the first
line put him upon writing Rosamund Gray, but he is generally supposed to have taken his heroine's
name from a song by Charles Lloyd, entitled "Rosamund Gray," published among his Poems in 1795.
At the end of the novel Matravis, the seducer, in his ravings, sings the ballad.

The "something" upon which Lamb was then at work was his play "John Woodvil," in those early
days known as "Pride's Cure."

"Your old description of cruelty in hell." In "Joan of Arc." See Letter 3.

"If I do not put up those eclogues." Lamb does not return to this subject.

Lloyd had just gone to Cambridge, to Caius College.]

LETTER 37

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Nov. 3, 1798.

I have read your Eclogue ["The Wedding"] repeatedly, and cannot call it bald, or without interest;
the cast of it, and the design are completely original, and may set people upon thinking: it
is as poetical as the subject requires, which asks no poetry; but it is defective in pathos.
The woman's own story is the tamest part of it--I should like you to remould that--it too much
resembles the young maid's history: both had been in service. Even the omission would not injure
the poem; after the words "growing wants," you might, not unconnectedly, introduce "look at
that little chub" down to "welcome one." And, decidedly, I would have you end it somehow thus,

"Give them at least this evening a good meal.
                                     Gives her money.
Now, fare thee well; hereafter you have taught me
To give sad meaning to the village-bells," &c.,

which would leave a stronger impression (as well as more pleasingly recall the beginning of
the Eclogue), than the present common-place reference to a better world, which the woman "must
have heard at church." I should like you, too, a good deal to enlarge the most striking part,
as it might have been, of the poem--"Is it idleness?" &c., that affords a good field for dwelling
on sickness and inabilities, and old age. And you might also a good deal enrich the piece with
a picture of a country wedding: the woman might very well, in a transient fit of oblivion,
dwell upon the ceremony and circumstances of her own nuptials six years ago, the smugness of
the bride-groom, the feastings, the cheap merriment, the welcomings, and the secret envyings
of the maidens--then dropping all this, recur to her present lot. I do not know that I can
suggest anything else, or that I have suggested anything new or material.

I shall be very glad to see some more poetry, though I fear your trouble in transcribing will
be greater than the service my remarks may do them.

Yours affectionately,

C. LAMB.

I cut my letter short because I am called off to business.

LETTER 38

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Nov. 8th, 1798.

I do not know that I much prefer this Eclogue [Lamb has received 'The Last of the Flock'] to
the last ['The Wedding']; both are inferior to the former ['The Ruined Cottage'].

"And when he came to shake me by the hand, And spake as kindly to me as he used, I hardly knew
his voice--"

is the only passage that affected me.

Servants speak, and their language ought to be plain, and not much raised above the common,
else I should find fault with the bathos of this passage:

"And when I heard the bell strike out, I thought (what?) that I had never heard it toll So
dismally before."

I like the destruction of the martens' old nests hugely, having just such a circumstance in
my memory.[1] I should be very glad to see your remaining Eclogue, if not too much trouble,
as you give me reason to expect it will be the second best.

I am going to meet Lloyd at Ware on Saturday, to return on Sunday. Have you any commands or
commendations to the metaphysician? I shall be very happy if you will dine or spend any time
with me in your way through the great ugly city; but I know you have other ties upon you in
these parts.

Love and respects to Edith, and friendly remembrances to Cottle.

[Footnote 1: The destruction of the martens' nests, in "The Last of the Family," runs thus:--

                          I remember,
Eight months ago, when the young Squire began
To alter the old mansion, they destroy'd
The martins' nests, that had stood undisturb'd
Under that roof, ... ay! long before my memory.
I shook my head at seeing it, and thought
No good could follow.]

[Lamb's ripe judgment of Wither will be found in his essay "On the Poetical Works of George
Wither," in the Works, 1818 (see Vol. I. of this edition). "The portrait poem" would be "The
Author's Meditation upon Sight of His Picture," prefixed to Emblems, 1635.

Lyrical Ballads, by Wordsworth and Coleridge, had just been published by Cottle. "The Ancient
Mariner" stood first. "That last poem" was Wordsworth's "Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern
Abbey." Southey (?) reviewed the book in the Critical Review for October, 1798.

Here should come a letter from Lamb to Robert Lloyd, dated November 13, 1798, not available
for this edition. Robert Lloyd seems to have said in his last letter that the world was drained
of all its sweets. Lamb sends him a beautiful passage in praise of the world's good things--the
first foretaste in the correspondence of his later ecstatic manner.

Here also should come a letter from Lamb to Southey, which apparently does not now exist, containing
"The Dying Lover," an extract from Lamb's play. I have taken the text from the version of the
play sent to Manning late in 1800.

THE DYING LOVER

Margaret. ... I knew a youth who died
For grief, because his Love proved so,
And married to another.
I saw him on the wedding day,
For he was present in the church that day,
And in his best apparel too,
As one that came to grace the ceremony.
  I mark'd him when the ring was given,
His countenance never changed;
And when the priest pronounced the marriage blessing,
He put a silent prayer up for the bride,
For they stood near who saw his lips move.
He came invited to the marriage-feast
With the bride's friends,
And was the merriest of them all that day;
But they, who knew him best, call'd it feign'd mirth;
And others said,
He wore a smile like death's upon his face.
His presence dash'd all the beholders' mirth,
And he went away in tears.
   Simon. What followed then?
   Marg. Oh! then
He did not as neglected suitors use
Affect a life of solitude in shades,
But lived,
In free discourse and sweet society,
Among his friends who knew his gentle nature best.
Yet ever when he smiled,
There was a mystery legible in his face,
That whoso saw him said he was a man
Not long for this world.--
And true it was, for even then
The silent love was feeding at his heart
Of which he died:
Nor ever spake word of reproach,
Only he wish'd in death that his remains
Might find a poor grave in some spot, not far
From his mistress' family vault, "being the place
Where one day Anna should herself be laid."

The line in italics Lamb crossed through in the Manning copy. The last four lines he crossed
through and marked "very bad." I have reproduced them here because of the autobiographical
hint contained in the word Anna, which was the name given by Lamb to his "fair-haired maid"
in his love sonnets.]

LETTER 39

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY [Probably November, 1798.]

The following is a second Extract from my Tragedy that is to be,--'tis narrated by an old Steward
to Margaret, orphan ward of Sir Walter Woodvil;--this, and the Dying Lover I gave you, are
the only extracts I can give without mutilation. I expect you to like the old woman's curse:

Old Steward.--One summer night, Sir Walter, as it chanc'd, Was pacing to & fro in the avenue
That westward fronts our house, Among those aged oaks, said to have been planted Three hundred
years ago By a neighb'ring Prior of the Woodvil name, But so it was, Being overtask't in thought,
he heeded not The importune suitor who stood by the gate, And beg'd an alms. Some say he shov'd
her rudely from the gate With angry chiding; but I can never think (Sir Walter's nature hath
a sweetness in it) That he would use a woman--an old woman-- With such discourtesy; For old
she was who beg'd an alms of him. Well, he refus'd her; Whether for importunity, I know not,
Or that she came between his meditations. But better had he met a lion in the streets Than
this old woman that night; For she was one who practis'd the black arts. And served the devil--being
since burn'd for witchcraft. She look'd at him like one that meant to blast him, And with a
frightful noise ('Twas partly like a woman's voice, And partly like the hissing of a snake)
She nothing said but this (Sir Walter told the words):

"A mischief, mischief, mischief, And a nine-times killing curse, By day and by night, to the
caitive wight Who shakes the poor like snakes from his door, And shuts up the womb of his purse;
And a mischief, mischief, mischief, And a nine-fold withering curse,-- For that shall come
to thee, that will render thee Both all that thou fear'st, and worse."

These words four times repeated, she departed, Leaving Sir Walter like a man beneath Whose
feet a scaffolding had suddenly fal'n: So he describ'd it. Margaret.--A terrible curse! Old
Steward.--O Lady, such bad things are told of that old woman, As, namely, that the milk she
gave was sour, And the babe who suck'd her shrivel'd like a mandrake; And things besides, with
a bigger horror in them, Almost, I think, unlawful to be told! Margaret.--Then must I never
hear them. But proceed, And say what follow'd on the witch's curse. Old Steward.--Nothing immediate;
but some nine months after, Young Stephen Woodvil suddenly fell sick, And none could tell what
ail'd him: for he lay, And pin'd, and pin'd, that all his hair came off; And he, that was full-flesh'd,
became as thin As a two-months' babe that hath been starved in the nursing;-- And sure, I think,
He bore his illness like a little child, With such rare sweetness of dumb melancholy He strove
to clothe his agony in smiles, Which he would force up in his poor, pale cheeks, Like ill-tim'd
guests that had no proper business there;-- And when they ask'd him his complaint, he laid
His hand upon his heart to show the place Where Satan came to him a nights, he said, And prick'd
him with a pin.-- And hereupon Sir Walter call'd to mind The Beggar Witch that stood in the
gateway, And begg'd an alms-- Margaret.--I do not love to credit Tales of magic. Heav'n's music,
which is order, seems unstrung; And this brave world, Creation's beauteous work, unbeautified,
Disorder'd, marr'd, where such strange things are acted.

This is the extract I brag'd of, as superior to that I sent you from Marlow. Perhaps you smile;
but I should like your remarks on the above, as you are deeper witch-read than I.

[The passage quoted in this letter, with certain alterations, became afterwards "The Witch,"
a dramatic sketch independent of "John Woodvil." By the phrase "without mutilation," Lamb possibly
means to suggest that Southey should print this sketch and "The Dying Lover" in the Annual
Anthology. That was not, however, done. "The Witch" was first printed in the Works, 1818.

Here should come a letter from Lamb to Robert Lloyd, postmarked November 20, 1798, not available
for this edition. In this letter Lamb sends Lloyd the extract from "The Witch" that was sent
to Southey.]

LETTER 40

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Nov. 28th, 1798.

I can have no objection to your printing "Mystery of God" with my name and all due acknowledgments
for the honour and favour of the communication; indeed, 'tis a poem that can dishonour no name.
Now, that is in the true strain of modern modesto-vanitas ... But for the sonnet, I heartily
wish it, as I thought it was, dead and forgotten. If the exact circumstances under which I
wrote could be known or told, it would be an interesting sonnet; but to an indifferent and
stranger reader it must appear a very bald thing, certainly inadmissible in a compilation.
I wish you could affix a different name to the volume; there is a contemptible book, a wretched
assortment of vapid feelings, entitled "Pratt's Gleanings," which hath damned and impropriated
the title for ever. Pray think of some other. The gentleman is better known (better had he
remained unknown) by an Ode to Benevolence, written and spoken for and at the annual dinner
of the Humane Society, who walk in procession once a-year, with all the objects of their charity
before them, to return God thanks for giving them such benevolent hearts.

I like "Bishop Bruno;" but not so abundantly as your "Witch Ballad," which is an exquisite
thing of its kind.

[The poem "Mystery of God" was, when printed in the Annual Anthology for 1799, entitled "Living
without God in the World." Lamb never reprinted it. It is not clear to what sonnet Lamb refers,
possibly that to his sister, printed on page 78, which he himself never reprinted. It was at
that time intended to call Southey's collection Gleanings; Lamb refers to the Gleanings of
Samuel Jackson Pratt (1749-1814), a very busy maker of books, published in 1795-1799. His Triumph
of Benevolence was published in 1786.

Southey's witch ballad was "The Old Woman of Berkeley."

George Dyer's principal works in verse are contained in his Poems, 1802, and Poetics, 1812.
He retained the epithet "dark" for Ossian's eyes.

Southey's recipe for a Turk's poison I do not find. It may have existed only in a letter.

A reference to the poem in Letter 39 will explain the remarks about witches' curses.

The Two Noble Englishmen (a sarcastic reference drawn, I imagine from Palamon and Arcite) were
Coleridge and Wordsworth, then in Germany. Nothing definite is known, but they seem quite amicably
to have decided to take independent courses.

"Lloyd's Jacobin correspondents." This is Lamb's only allusion to the attack which had been
made by The Anti-Jacobin upon himself, Lloyd and their friends, particularly Coleridge and
Southey. In "The New Morality," in the last number of Canning's paper, they had been thus grouped:--

And ye five other wandering Bards that move In sweet accord of harmony and love, C-----dge
and S--tb--y, L--d, and L--be & Co. Tune all your mystic harps to praise Lepaux!

--Lepaux being the high-priest of Theophilanthropy. When "The New Morality" was reprinted in
The Beauties of "The AntiJacobin" in 1799, a savage footnote on Coleridge was appended, accusing
him of hypocrisy and the desertion of his wife and children, and adding "Ex uno disce his associates
Southey and Lamb." Again, in the first number of the Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine, August,
1798, was a picture by Gilray, representing the worshippers of Lepaux, wherein Lloyd and Lamb
appeared as a toad and a frog reading their own Blank Verse, and Coleridge and Southey, as
donkeys, flourish "Dactylics" and "Saphics." In September the federated poets were again touched
upon in a parody of the "Ode to the Passions":--

See! faithful to their mighty dam, C----dge, S--th--y, L--d, and L--b In splay-foot madrigals
of love, Soft moaning like the widow'd dove, Pour, side-by-side, their sympathetic notes; Of
equal rights, and civic feasts, And tyrant kings, and knavish priests, Swift through the land
the tuneful mischief floats.

And now to softer strains they struck the lyre, They sung the beetle or the mole, The dying
kid, or ass's foal, By cruel man permitted to expire.

Lloyd took the caricature and the verses with his customary seriousness, going so far as to
indite a "Letter to The Anti-Jacobin Reviewers," which was printed in Birmingham in 1799. Therein
he defended Lamb with some vigour: "The person you have thus leagued in a partnership of infamy
with me is Mr. Charles Lamb, a man who, so far from being a democrat, would be the first person
to assent to the opinions contained in the foregoing pages: he is a man too much occupied with
real and painful duties--duties of high personal self-denial--to trouble himself about speculative
matters."]

LETTER 41

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Dec. 27, 1798.

Dear Southey,--Your friend John May has formerly made kind offers to Lloyd of serving me in
the India house by the interest of his friend Sir Francis Baring--It is not likely that I shall
ever put his goodness to the test on my own account, for my prospects are very comfortable.
But I know a man, a young man, whom he could serve thro' the same channel, and I think would
be disposed to serve if he were acquainted with his case. This poor fellow (whom I know just
enough of to vouch for his strict integrity & worth) has lost two or three employments from
illness, which he cannot regain; he was once insane, & from the distressful uncertainty of
his livelihood has reason to apprehend a return of that malady--He has been for some time dependant
on a woman whose lodger he formerly was, but who can ill afford to maintain him, and I know
that on Christmas night last he actually walk'd about the streets all night, rather than accept
of her Bed, which she offer'd him, and offer'd herself to sleep in the kitchen, and that in
consequence of that severe cold he is labouring under a bilious disorder, besides a depression
of spirits, which incapacitates him from exertion when he most needs it--For God's sake, Southey,
if it does not go against you to ask favors, do it now--ask it as for me--but do not do a violence
to your feelings, because he does not know of this application, and will suffer no disappointment--What
I meant to say was this--there are in the India house what are called Extra Clerks, not on
the Establishment, like me, but employed in Extra business, by-jobs--these get about L50 a
year, or rather more, but never rise--a Director can put in at any time a young man in this
office, and it is by no means consider'd so great a favor as making an established Clerk. He
would think himself as rich as an Emperor if he could get such a certain situation, and be
relieved from those disquietudes which I do fear may one day bring back his distemper--

You know John May better than I do, but I know enough to believe that he is a good man--he
did make me that offer I have mention'd, but you will perceive that such an offer cannot authorize
me in applying for another Person.

But I cannot help writing to you on the subject, for the young man is perpetually before my
eyes, and I should feel it a crime not to strain all my petty interest to do him service, tho'
I put my own delicacy to the question by so doing--I have made one other unsuccessful attempt
already--

At all events I will thank you to write, for I am tormented with anxiety--

I suppose you have somewhere heard that poor Mary Dollin has poisoned herself, after some interviews
with John Reid, the ci-devant Alphonso of her days of hope.

How is Edith?

C. LAMB.

[John May was a friend and correspondent of Southey whom he had met at Lisbon: not to be confounded
with Coleridge's inn-keeping May.

Sir Francis Baring was a director of the East India Company. 1 have no knowledge as to who
the young man was; nor have I any regarding Mary Dollin and John Reid.]

LETTER 42

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Jan. 21st, 1799.

I am requested by Lloyd to excuse his not replying to a kind letter received from you. He is
at present situated in most distressful family perplexities, which I am not at liberty to explain;
but they are such as to demand all the strength of his mind, and quite exclude any attention
to foreign objects. His brother Robert (the flower of his family) hath eloped from the persecutions
of his father, and has taken shelter with me. What the issue of his adventure will be, I know
not. He hath the sweetness of an angel in his heart, combined with admirable firmness of purpose:
an uncultivated, but very original, and, I think, superior genius. But this step of his is
but a small part of their family troubles.

I am to blame for not writing to you before on my own account; but I know you can dispense
with the expressions of gratitude, or I should have thanked you before for all May's kindness.
He has liberally supplied the person I spoke to you of with money, and had procured him a situation
just after himself had lighted upon a similar one and engaged too far to recede. But May's
kindness was the same, and my thanks to you and him are the same. May went about on this business
as if it had been his own. But you knew John May before this: so I will be silent.

I shall be very glad to hear from you when convenient. I do not know how your Calendar and
other affairs thrive; but, above all, I have not heard a great while of your "Madoc"--the opus
magnum. I would willingly send you something to give a value to this letter; but I have only
one slight passage to send you, scarce worth the sending, which I want to edge in somewhere
into my play, which, by the way, hath not received the addition of ten lines, besides, since
I saw you. A father, old Walter Woodvil (the witch's PROTEGE) relates this of his son John,
who "fought in adverse armies," being a royalist, and his father a parliamentary man:--

"I saw him in the day of Worcester fight, Whither he came at twice seven years, Under the discipline
of the Lord Falkland (His uncle by the mother's side, Who gave his youthful politics a bent
Quite from the principles of his father's house;) There did I see this valiant Lamb of Mars,
This sprig of honour, this unbearded John, This veteran in green years, this sprout, this Woodvil,
(With dreadless ease guiding a fire-hot steed, Which seem'd to scorn the manage of a boy),
Prick forth with such a mirth into the field, To mingle rivalship and acts of war Even with
the sinewy masters of the art,-- You would have thought the work of blood had been A play-game
merely, and the rabid Mars Had put his harmful hostile nature off, To instruct raw youth in
images of war, And practice of the unedged players' foils. The rough fanatic and blood-practised
soldiery Seeing such hope and virtue in the boy, Disclosed their ranks to let him pass unhurt,
Checking their swords' uncivil injuries, As loth to mar that curious workmanship Of Valour's
beauty pourtray'd in his face."

Lloyd objects to "pourtray'd in his face,"--do you? I like the line.

I shall clap this in somewhere. I think there is a spirit through the lines; perhaps the 7th,
8th, and 9th owe their origin to Shakspeare, though no image is borrowed.

He says in "Henry the Fourth"--

"This infant Hotspur, Mars in swathing clothes."

[See Pt. I., III., 2, 111, 112.]

But pray did Lord Falkland die before Worcester fight? In that case I must make bold to unclify
some other nobleman.

Kind love and respects to Edith.

 C. LAMB.

[Charles Lloyd's perplexities turned probably once again on the question of his marriage. How
long Robert Lloyd was with Lamb we do not know; nor of what nature were the "persecutions"
to which he was subjected. According to the evidence at our disposal, Charles Lloyd, sen.,
was a good father.

Southey's Madoc was not published until 1805.

The passage from the play was not printed in John Woodvil. This, together with "The Dying Lover"
are to be found only in the discarded version, printed in the Notes to Vol. IV. of the present
edition. Lord Falkland had been killed at Newbury eight years before Worcester fight. Lamb
altered the names to Ashley and Naseby, although Sir Anthony Cooper was not made Lord Ashley
until sixteen years after Naseby was fought.]

LETTER 43

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

[Late January or early February, 1799.]

Dr. Southey,--Lloyd will now be able to give you an account of himself, so to him I leave you
for satisfaction. Great part of his troubles are lightened by the partial recovery of his sister,
who had been alarmingly ill with similar diseases to his own. The other part of the family
troubles sleeps for the present, but I fear will awake at some future time to confound and
disunite. He will probably tell you all about it. Robert still continues here with me, his
father has proposed nothing, but would willingly lure him back with fair professions. But Robert
is endowed with a wise fortitude, and in this business has acted quite from himself, and wisely
acted. His parents must come forward in the End. I like reducing parents to a sense of undutifulness.
I like confounding the relations of life. Pray let me see you when you come to town, and contrive
to give me some of your company.

I thank you heartily for your intended presents, but do by no means see the necessity you are
under of burthening yourself thereby. You have read old Wither's Supersedeas to small purpose.
You object to my pauses being at the end of my lines. I do not know any great difficulty I
should find in diversifying or changing my blank verse; but I go upon the model of Shakspere
in my Play, and endeavour after a colloquial ease and spirit, something like him. I could so
easily imitate Milton's versification; but my ear & feeling would reject it, or any approaches
to it, in the drama. I do not know whether to be glad or sorry that witches have been detected
aforetimes in shutting up of wombs. I certainly invented that conceit, and its coincidence
with fact is incidental [? accidental], for I never heard it. I have not seen those verses
on Col. Despard--I do not read any newspapers. Are they short, to copy without much trouble?
I should like to see them.

I just send you a few rhymes from my play, the only rhymes in it--a forest-liver giving an
account of his amusements:--

What sports have you in the forest? Not many,--some few,--as thus. &c. &c.

I love to anticipate charges of unoriginality: the first line is almost Shakspere's:--

"To have my love to bed & to arise." Midsummer Nights Dream [III., I, 174].

I think there is a sweetness in the versification not unlike some rhymes in that exquisite
play, and the last line but three is yours:

"An eye That met the gaze, or turn'd it knew not why." Rosamund's Epistle.

I shall anticipate all my play, and have nothing to shew you. An idea for Leviathan:--

Commentators on Job have been puzzled to find out a meaning for Leviathan,--'tis a whale, say
some; a crocodile, say others. In my simple conjecture, Leviathan is neither more nor less
than the Lord Mayor of London for the time being.

"Rosamund" sells well in London, maugre the non-reviewal of it.

I sincerely wish you better health, & better health to Edith, Kind remembrances to her.

C. LAMB.

If you come to town by Ash Wednesday [February 6], you will certainly see Lloyd here--I expect
him by that time.

My sister Mary was never in better health or spirits than now.

[Writing in June, 1799, to Robert Lloyd, Priscilla, his sister, says: "Lamb would not I think
by any means be a person to take up your abode with. He is too much like yourself--he would
encourage those feelings which it certainly is your duty to suppress. Your station in life--the
duties which are pointed out by that rank in society which you are destined to fill--differ
widely from his." When next we hear of Robert Lloyd he has returned to Birmingham, where his
father soon afterwards bought him a partnership in a bookselling and printing business.

"Col. Despard." I have not found the verses. Colonel Edward Marcus Despard, after a career
that began brilliantly, was imprisoned in the spring of 1798 and executed for High Treason in 1803.

The rhymed passage from John Woodvil is that which is best known. Hazlitt relates that Godwin
was so taken with it when he first read it that he asked every one he met to tell him the author
and play, and at last applied to Lamb himself.]

LETTER 44

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY March 15th, 1799.

Dear Southey,--I have received your little volume, for which I thank you, though I do not entirely
approve of this sort of intercourse, where the presents are all one side. I have read the last
Eclogue again with great pleasure. It hath gained considerably by abridgment, and now I think
it wants nothing but enlargement. You will call this one of tyrant Procrustes' criticisms,
to cut and pull so to his own standard; but the old lady is so great a favourite with me, I
want to hear more of her; and of "Joanna" you have given us still less. But the picture of
the rustics leaning over the bridge, and the old lady travelling abroad on a summer evening
to see her garden watered, are images so new and true, that I decidedly prefer this "Ruin'd
Cottage" to any poem in the book. Indeed I think it the only one that will bear comparison
with your "Hymn to the Penates" in a former volume.

I compare dissimilar things, as one would a rose and a star for the pleasure they give us,
or as a child soon learns to choose between a cake and a rattle; for dissimilars have mostly
some points of comparison. The next best poem, I think, is the First Eclogue; 'tis very complete,
and abounding in little pictures and realities. The remainder Eclogues, excepting only the
"Funeral," I do not greatly admire. I miss one, which had at least as good a title to publication
as the "Witch," or the "Sailor's Mother." You call'd it the "Last of the Family." The "Old
Woman of Berkeley" comes next; in some humours I would give it the preference above any. But
who the devil is Matthew of Westminster? You are as familiar with these antiquated monastics,
as Swedenborg, or, as his followers affect to call him, the Baron, with his invisibles. But
you have raised a very comic effect out of the true narrative of Matthew of Westminster. 'Tis
surprising with how little addition you have been able to convert with so little alteration
his incidents, meant for terror, into circumstances and food for the spleen. The Parody is
not so successful; it has one famous line indeed, which conveys the finest death-bed image
I ever met with:

"The doctor whisper'd the nurse, and the surgeon knew what he said."

But the offering the bride three times bears not the slightest analogy or proportion to the
fiendish noises three times heard! In "Jaspar," the circumstance of the great light is very
affecting. But I had heard you mention it before. The "Rose" is the only insipid piece in the
volume; it hath neither thorns nor sweetness, and, besides, sets all chronology and probability
at defiance.

"Cousin Margaret," you know, I like. The allusions to the "Pilgrim's Progress" are particularly
happy, and harmonise tacitly and delicately with old cousins and aunts. To familiar faces we
do associate familiar scenes and accustomed objects; but what hath Apollidon and his sea-nymphs
to do in these affairs? Apollyon I could have borne, though he stands for the devil; but who
is Apollidon? I think you are too apt to conclude faintly, with some cold moral, as in the
end of the poem called "The Victory"--

"Be thou her comforter, who art the widow's friend;"

a single common-place line of comfort, which bears no proportion in weight or number to the
many lines which describe suffering. This is to convert religion into mediocre feelings, which
should burn, and glow, and tremble. A moral should be wrought into the body and soul, the matter
and tendency, of a poem, not tagged to the end, like a "God send the good ship into harbour,"
at the conclusion of our bills of lading. The finishing of the "Sailor" is also imperfect.
Any dissenting minister may say and do as much.

These remarks, I know, are crude and unwrought; but I do not lay claim to much accurate thinking.
I never judge system-wise of things, but fasten upon particulars. After all, there is a great
deal in the book that I must, for time, leave unmentioned, to deserve my thanks for its own
sake, as well as for the friendly remembrances implied in the gift. I again return you my thanks.

Pray present my love to Edith. C. L.

[Southey's little volume was Vol. II. of the second edition of his Poems, published in 1799.
The last of the English Eclogues included in it was "The Ruined Cottage," slightly altered
from the version referred to in letter 38. The "Hymn to the Penates" brought the first volume
of this edition to a close. The first Eclogue was "The Old Mansion House." "The Old Woman of
Berkeley" was called "A Ballad showing how an Old Woman rode double and who rode before her."
It was preceded by a long quotation in Latin from Matthew of Westminster. Matthew of Westminster
is the imaginary name given to the unknown authors of a chronicle called Flares Historiarum,
belonging probably to the fifteenth century. The Parody was "The Surgeon's Warning," which
begins with the two lines that Lamb prints as one:--

The Doctor whisper'd to the Nurse, And the Surgeon knew what he said.

"The Rose" was blank verse, addressed to Edith Southey. "Cousin Margaret" was a "Metrical Letter
Written from London," in which there are allusions to Bunyan. I the other day threw off an
extempore epitaph on Ensign Peacock of the 3rd Regt. of the Royal East India Volunteers, who
like other boys in this scarlet tainted age was ambitious of playing at soldiers, but dying
in the first flash of his valour was at the particular instance of his relations buried with
military honours! like any veteran scarr'd or chopt from Blenheim or Ramilies. (He was buried
in sash and gorget.)

MARMOR LOQUITUR

He lies a Volunteer so fine, Who died of a decline, As you or I, may do one day; Reader, think
of this, I pray; And I numbly hope you'll drop a tear For my poor Royal Volunteer. He was as
brave as brave could be, Nobody was so brave as he; He would have died in Honor's bed, Only
he died at home instead. Well may the Royal Regiment swear, They never had such a Volunteer.
But whatsoever they may say, Death is a man that will have his way: Tho' he was but an ensign
in this world of pain; In the next we hope he'll be a captain. And without meaning to make
any reflection on his mentals, He begg'd to be buried in regimentals.

Sed hae sunt lamentabilis nugae--But 'tis as good as some epitaphs you and I have read together
in Christ-Church-yard.

C. L.

[Peter Pindar (Dr. John Wolcot) has an ode "To a Fly, taken out of a Bowl of Punch." He also
wrote "The Lousiad."

"Poor earth-born companions." From Burns' "Lines to a Mouse," 2nd Stanza, line 5.

"Toads are made to fly." Filliping the toad was an old pastime. A toad was placed on one end
of a piece of wood, laid crosswise over a stone. The other end was struck with a beetle (i.e.,
a mallet), and the toad flew into the air. Falstaff says: "Fillip me with a three-man beetle."
As to worms and fishermen, the late Mrs. Coe, who as a girl had known Lamb at Widford, told
me that he could rarely, if ever, be tempted to join the anglers. Affixing the worm was too
much for him. "Barbarous, barbarous," he used to say.

Lamb's project for a series of animal poems has to some extent been carried out by a living
poet, Mr. A. C. Benson. Neither Lamb nor Southey pursued it.

We met Sam Le Grice in the letter of October 3, 1796. To what escapade Lamb refers I do not
know, but he was addicted to folly. It was Sam Le Grice of whom Leigh Hunt in his Autobiography
tells the excellent tale that he excused himself to his master for not having performed a task,
by the remark that he had had a "lethargy."

In April of this year died John Lamb, the father. Charles Lamb probably at once moved from
45 Chapel Street to No. 36, where Mary Lamb joined him.

Between this and the next letter should probably come a letter from Lamb to Robert Lloyd, not
available for this edition. It seems to follow upon Robert Lloyd's departure from Lamb's house,
and remarks that Lamb knows but one being that he could ever consent to live perpetually with,
and that is Robert--but Robert must go whither prudence and paternal regulations dictate. Lamb
also refers to a poem of an intimate character by Charles Lloyd in the Annual Anthology ("Lines
to a Brother and Sister"), remarking that, in his opinion, these domestic addresses should
not always be made public. There is also a reference to Charles Lloyd's novel, which Lamb says
he wants to read if he may be permitted a sight of it. This would be Isabel.]

LETTER 46

CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY

Oct. 31st, 1799.

Dear Southey,--I have but just got your letter, being returned from Herts, where I have passed
a few red-letter days with much pleasure. I would describe the county to you, as you have done
by Devonshire, but alas! I am a poor pen at that same. I could tell you of an old house with
a tapestry bed-room, the "judgment of Solomon" composing one pannel, and "Actaeon spying Diana
naked" the other. I could tell of an old marble hall, with Hogarth's prints and the Roman Caesars
in marble hung round. I could tell of a wilderness, and of a village church, and where the
bones of my honoured grandam lie; but there are feelings which refuse to be translated, sulky
aborigines, which will not be naturalised in another soil. Of this nature are old family faces
and scenes of infancy.

I have given your address, and the books you want, to the Arches; they will send them as soon
as they can get them, but they do not seem quite familiar to [? with] their names. I have seen
Gebor! Gebor aptly so denominated from Geborish, quasi Gibberish. But Gebor hath some lucid
intervals. I remember darkly one beautiful simile veiled in uncouth phrases about the youngest
daughter of the Ark. I shall have nothing to communicate, I fear, to the Anthology. You shall
have some fragments of my play, if you desire them, but I think I would rather print it whole.
Have you seen it, or shall I lend you a copy? I want your opinion of it.

I must get to business, so farewell. My kind remembrances to Edith.

C. LAMB.

[Lamb had probably been staying at Widford. Many years later he described his Hertfordshire
days in more than one essay (see the Elia essays "Mackery End" and "Blakesmoor in H-----shire"
and "Dream-Children"). The old house was, of course, Blakesware. The wilderness, which lay
at the back of the house, is, with Widford, mentioned in Rosamund Gray.

The Arches were the brothers Arch, the booksellers of Ludgate Hill.

Gebor stands for Gebir, Landor's poem, published in 1798. The simile in question would be this:
from Book VII., lines 248-251:--

Never so eager, when the world was waves, Stood the less daughter of the ark, and tried (Innocent
this temptation) to recall With folded vest and casting arm the dove.

The reference to Southey's Anthology is to Vol. II., then in preparation. The play was now
finished: it circulated in manuscript before being published in 1802.

In a letter to Robert Lloyd, dated December 17, 1799, Lamb thanks him for a present of porter,
adding that wine makes him hot, and brandy drunk, but porter warms without intoxication.

Here should come an unpublished letter from Lamb to Charles Lloyd at Cambridge, asking for
the return of his play. Kemble, he says, had offered to put it in the hands of the proprietor
of Drury Lane, and therefore Lamb wishes to have a second copy in the house. Kemble, as it
turned out, returned no answer for a year, and then he stated that he had lost the copy.

Lamb mentions Coleridge's settlement with his family in lodgings in the Adelphi. Coleridge,
having returned from Germany and undertaken work for the Morning Post, took lodgings at 21
Buckingham Street, Strand, close to the Adelphi, in November, 1799.

The letter is interesting in containing the first mention of Manning, whom we are now to meet.]

LETTER 47

CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS MANNING

Dec., 1799.

Dear Manning,--The particular kindness, even up to a degree of attachment, which I have experienced
from you, seems to claim some distinct acknowledgment on my part. I could not content myself
with a bare remembrance to you, conveyed in some letter to Lloyd.

Will it be agreeable to you, if I occasionally recruit your memory of me, which must else soon
fade, if you consider the brief intercourse we have had. I am not likely to prove a troublesome
correspondent. My scribbling days are past. I shall have no sentiments to communicate, but
as they spring up from some living and worthy occasion.

I look forward with great pleasure to the performance of your promise, that we should meet
in London early in the ensuing year. The century must needs commence auspiciously for me, that
brings with it Manning's friendship as an earnest of its after gifts.

I should have written before, but for a troublesome inflammation in one of my eyes, brought
on by night travelling with the coach windows sometimes up.

What more I have to say shall be reserved for a letter to Lloyd. I must not prove tedious to
you in my first outset, lest I should affright you by my ill-judged loquacity. I am, yours
most sincerely, C. LAMB.

[This is the first letter that has been preserved in the correspondence between Lamb and Manning.
Lamb first met Manning at Cambridge, in the autumn of 1799, when on a visit to Charles Lloyd.
Much of Manning's history will be unfolded as the letters proceed, but here it should be stated
that he was born on November 8, 1772, and was thus a little more than two years older than
Lamb. He was at this time acting as private tutor in mathematics at Cambridge, among his pupils
being Charles Lloyd, of Caius, Manning's own college. Manning, however, did not take his degree,
owing to an objection to oaths and tests.

Lamb's reference to the beginning of the century shows that he shared with many other non-mathematically-minded
persons the belief that the century begins with the hundredth, and not the hundred and first,
year. He says of Manning, in the Elia essay "The Old and the New Schoolmaster": "My friend
M., with great painstaking, got me to think I understood the first proposition in Euclid, but
gave me over in despair at the second."]

LETTER 48

CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS MANNING

Dec. 28th, 1799.

Dear Manning,--Having suspended my correspondence a decent interval, as knowing that even good
things may be taken to satiety, a wish cannot but recur to learn whether you be still well
and happy. Do all things continue in the state I left them in Cambridge?

Do your night parties still flourish? and do you continue to bewilder your company with your
thousand faces running down through all the keys of idiotism (like Lloyd over his perpetual
harpsicord), from the smile and the glimmer of half-sense and quarter-sense to the grin and
hanging lip of Betty Foy's own Johnny? And does the face-dissolving curfew sound at twelve?
How unlike the great originals were your petty terrors in the postscript, not fearful enough
to make a fairy shudder, or a Lilliputian fine lady, eight months full of child, miscarry.
Yet one of them, which had more beast than the rest, I thought faintly resembled one of your
brutifications. But, seriously, I long to see your own honest Manning-face again. I did not
mean a pun,--your man's face, you will be apt to say, I know your wicked will to pun. I cannot
now write to Lloyd and you too, so you must convey as much interesting intelligence as this
may contain, or be thought to contain, to him and Sophia, with my dearest love and remembrances.

By the by, I think you and Sophia both incorrect with regard to the title of the play. Allowing
your objection (which is not necessary, as pride may be, and is in real life often, cured by
misfortunes not directly originating from its own acts, as Jeremy Taylor will tell you a naughty
desire is sometimes sent to cure it--I know you read these practical divines). But allowing
your objection, does not the betraying of his father's secret directly spring from pride?--from
the pride of wine and a full heart, and a proud over-stepping of the ordinary rules of morality,
and contempt of the prejudices of mankind, which are not to bind superior souls--"as trust
in the matter of secret all ties of blood, &c., &c., keeping of promises, the feeble mind's
religion, binding our morning knowledge to the performance of what last night's ignorance spake"--does
he not prate, that "Great Spirits" must do more than die for their friend--does not the pride
of wine incite him to display some evidence of friendship, which its own irregularity shall
make great? This I know, that I meant his punishment not alone to be a cure for his daily and
habitual pride, but the direct consequence and appropriate punishment of a particular act of pride.

If you do not understand it so, it is my fault in not explaining my meaning.

I have not seen Coleridge since, and scarcely expect to see him,--perhaps he has been at Cambridge.
I dined with him in town and breakfasted with him and Priscilla, who you may tell Charles has
promised to come and see me when she returns [to] Clapham. I will write to Charles on Monday.

Need I turn over to blot a fresh clean half-sheet? merely to say, what I hope you are sure
of without my repeating it, that I would have you consider me, dear Manning, Your sincere friend,

C. LAMB.

What is your proper address?

["Betty Foy's own Johnny"--"The Idiot Boy," in the Lyrical Ballads.

"In the postscript." A reference presumably to some drawings of faces in one of Manning's letters.

"The title of the play." Writing to Lamb on December 15, 1799, Manning had said: "I had some
conversation the other day with Sophia concerning your tragedy; and she made some very sensible
observations (as I thought) with respect to the unfitness of its title, 'The Folly,' whose
consequences humble the pride and ambition of John's heart, does not originate in the workings
of those passions, but from an underpart in his character, and as it were accidentally, viz.,
from the ebullitions of a drunken mind and from a rash confidence."

"You will understand what I mean, without my explaining myself any further. God bless you,
and keep you from all evil things, that walk upon the face of the earth--I mean nightmares,
hobgoblins and spectres."

Lamb refers in this letter particularly to Act III. of his play. "I have not seen Coleridge
since." Since when is not clear. Possibly Coleridge had been at Cambridge when Lamb was there.]

LETTER 49

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE ? Jan. 23, 1800.

Dear Coleridge,--Now I write, I cannot miss this opportunity of acknowledging the obligations
myself, and the readers in general of that luminous paper, the "Morning Post," are under to
you for the very novel and exquisite manner in which you combined political with grammatical
science, in your yesterday's dissertation on Mr. Wyndham's unhappy composition. It must have
been the death-blow to that ministry. I expect Pitt and Grenville to resign. More especially
the delicate and Cottrellian grace with which you officiated, with a ferula for a white wand,
as gentleman usher to the word "also," which it seems did not know its place.

I expect Manning of Cambridge in town to-night--will you fulfil your promise of meeting him
at my house? He is a man of a thousand. Give me a line to say what day, whether Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, &c., and if Sara and the Philosopher can come. I am afraid if I did not at intervals
call upon you, I should never see you. But I forget, the affairs of the nation engross your
time and your mind.

Farewell. C.L.

[The first letter that has been preserved of the second period of Lamb's correspondence with
Coleridge, which was to last until the end.

In the Morning Post of January 7, 1800, had appeared the correspondence between Buonaparte
and Lord Grenville, in which Buonaparte made an offer of peace. Lord Grenville's Note, it was
pointed out in the Morning Post for January 16, was really written by William Windham, Secretary
for War, and on January 22 appeared an article closely criticising its grammar.

Here is the passage concerning "also," to which Lamb particularly alludes a little later in
the letter:--

... "The same system, to the prevalence of which France justly ascribes all her present miseries,
is that which has also involved the rest of Europe in a long and destructive warfare, of a
nature long since unknown to the practice of civilized nations." Here the connective word "also"
should have followed the word "Europe." As it at present stands, the sentence implies that
France, miserable as she may be, has, however, not been involved in a warfare. The word "same"
is absolutely expletive; and by appearing to refer the reader to some foregoing clause, it
not only loads the sentence, but renders it obscure. The word "to" is absurdly used for the
word "in." A thing may be unknown to practitioners, as humanity and sincerity may be unknown
to the practitioners of State-craft, and foresight, science, and harmony may have been unknown
to the planners and practitioners of Continental Expeditions; but even "cheese-parings and
candle-ends" cannot be known or unknown "to" a practice!!

Windham was destined to be attacked by another stalwart in Lamb's circle, for it was his speech
in opposition to Lord Erskine's Cruelty to Animals Bill in 1809 that inspired John Lamb to
write his fierce pamphlet (see page 434).

"Cottrellian grace." The Cotterells were Masters of the Ceremonies from 1641 to 1808.

The Philosopher was Hartley Coleridge, aged three, so called after his great namesake, David
Hartley. The Coleridges were now, as we have seen, living at 21 Buckingham Street, Strand.]

LETTER 50

Charles Lamb to Thomas Manning

[P.M. Feb. 13, 1800.]

Dear Manning,--Olivia is a good girl, and if you turn to my letter, you will find that this
very plea you set up to vindicate Lloyd I had made use of as a reason why he should never have
employed Olivia to make a copy of such a letter--a letter I could not have sent to my enemy's
b----h, if she had thought fit to seek me in the way of marriage. But you see it in one view,
I in another. Rest you merry in your opinion! Opinion is a species of property; and though
I am always desirous to share with my friend to a certain extent, I shall ever like to keep
some tenets and some property properly my own. Some day, Manning, when we meet, substituting
Corydon and fair Amaryllis, for Charles Lloyd and Mary Hayes, we will discuss together this
question of moral feeling, "In what cases and how far sincerity is a virtue?" I do not mean
Truth--a good Olivia-like creature--God bless her, who, meaning no offence, is always ready
to give an answer when she is asked why she did so and so; but a certain forward-talking half-brother
of hers, Sincerity, that amphibious gentleman, who is so ready to perk up his obnoxious sentiments
unasked into your notice, as Midas would his ears into your face uncalled for. But I despair
of doing anything by a letter in the way of explaining or coming to explanations. A good wish,
or a pun, or a piece of secret history, may be well enough that way conveyed; nay, it has been
known that intelligence of a turkey hath been conveyed by that medium without much ambiguity.
Godwin I am a good deal pleased with. He is a very well-behaved, decent man, nothing very brilliant
about him, or imposing, as you may suppose; quite another guess sort of gentleman from what
your Anti-Jacobin Christians imagine him. I was well pleased to find he has neither horns nor
claws; quite a tame creature, I assure you. A middle-sized man, both in stature and in understanding;
whereas, from his noisy fame, you would expect to find a Briareus Centimanus, or a Tityus tall
enough to pull Jupiter from his heavens.

I begin to think you Atheists not quite so tall a species. Coleridge inquires after you pretty
often. I wish to be the Pandar to bring you together again once before I die. When we die,
you and I must part; the sheep, you know, take the right hand, and the goats the left. Stripped
of its allegory, you must know, the sheep are I and the Apostles, and the Martyrs, and the
Popes, and Bishop Taylor, and Bishop Horsley, and Coleridge, &c., &c.; the goats are the Atheists
and the Adulterers, and dumb dogs, and Godwin and M-----g, and that Thyestaean crew--yaw! how
my saintship sickens at the idea!

You shall have my play and the Falstaff letters in a day or two. I will write to Lloyd by this
day's post.

Pray, is it a part of your sincerity to show my letters to Lloyd? for really, gentlemen ought
to explain their virtues upon a first acquaintance, to prevent mistakes.

God bless you, Manning. Take my trifling as trifling; and believe me, seriously and deeply,

Your well-wisher and friend,

C. L.

[Mary Hayes was a friend of Mary Wollstonecraft, and also of Southey and Coleridge. She wrote
a novel, Memoirs of Emma Courtney, which Lloyd says contained her own love letters to Godwin
and Frend, and also Female Biography, or Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women. Lloyd
and she had been very intimate. A passage from a letter of Coleridge to Southey, dated January
25, 1800, bears upon the present situation: "Miss Hayes I have seen. Charles Lloyd's conduct
has been atrocious beyond what you stated. Lamb himself confessed to me that during the time
in which he kept up his ranting, sentimental correspondence with Miss Hayes, he frequently
read her letters in company, as a subject for laughter, and then sate down and answered them
quite a la Rousseau! Poor Lloyd! Every hour new-creates him; he is his own posterity in a perpetually
flowing series, and his body unfortunately retaining an external identity, their mutual contradictions
and disagreeings are united under one name, and of course are called lies, treachery, and rascality!"

Another letter from Lamb to Manning at this time tells the story of the Charles Lloyd and Mary
Hayes imbroglio. Lloyd had written to Miss Hayes a very odd letter concerning her Godwinite
creed, in which he refers to her belief that she was in love with him and repeats old stories
that she had been in love both with Godwin and Frend. Here is one sentence: "In the confounding
medley of ordinary conversation, I have interwoven my abhorrence of your principles with a
glanced contempt for your personal character." This letter Lloyd had given to his sister Olivia
to copy--"An ignorant Quaker girl," says Lamb, "I mean ignorant in the best sense, who ought
not to know, that such a thing was possible or in rerum naturae that a woman should court a
man." Later: "As long as Lloyd or I have known Col. [Coleridge] so long have we known him in
the daily and hourly habit of quizzing the world by lyes, most unaccountable and most disinterested
fictions." And here is one more passage: "To sum up my inferences from the above facts, I am
determined to live a merry Life in the midst of Sinners. I try to consider all men as such,
and to pitch any expectations from human nature as low as possible. In this view, all unexpected
Virtues are Godsends and beautiful exceptions."

Lamb had just met William Godwin (1756-1836), probably having been introduced to him by Coleridge.
Godwin, known chiefly by his Political Justice, 1793; Caleb Williams, 1794, and St. Leon, 1799,
stood at that time for everything that was advanced in thought and conduct. We shall meet with
him often in the correspondence of the next few years. None of the Damned philosophical Humeian
indifference, so cold, and unnatural, and inhuman! None of the damned Gibbonian fine writing,
so fine and composite. C. L.

["War and Nature, and Mr. Pitt." The war had sent up taxation to an almost unbearable height.
Pitt was Chancellor of Exchequer, as well as Prime Minister.

Hume, Gibbon and Robertson were among the books which, in the Elia essay "Detached Thoughts
on Books and Reading," Lamb described as biblia-a-biblia. William Roscoe's principal work was
his Life of Lorenzo de' Medici, 1795.]

LETTER 52

CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS MANNING

[P.M. March 17, 1800.]

Dear Manning,--I am living in a continuous feast. Coleridge has been with me now for nigh three
weeks, and the more I see of him in the quotidian undress and relaxation of his mind, the more
cause I see to love him, and believe him a very good man, and all those foolish impressions
to the contrary fly off like morning slumbers. He is engaged in translations, which I hope
will keep him this month to come. He is uncommonly kind and friendly to me. He ferrets me day
and night to do something. Marry come up! what a pretty similitude, and how like your humble
servant! I have even written the introductory letter; and, if I can pick up a few guineas this
way, I feel they will be most refreshing, bread being so dear. If I go on with it, I will apprise
you of it, as you may like to see my thing's! and the tulip, of all flowers, loves to be admired
most.

Pray pardon me, if my letters do not come very thick. I am so taken up with one thing or other,
that I cannot pick out (I will not say time, but) fitting times to write to you. My dear love
to Lloyd and Sophia, and pray split this thin letter into three parts, and present them with
the two biggest in my name.

They are my oldest friends; but ever the new friend driveth out the old, as the ballad sings!
God bless you all three! I would hear from Lloyd, if I could.

C. L.

Flour has just fallen nine shillings a sack! we shall be all too rich.

Tell Charles I have seen his Mamma, and have almost fallen in love with her, since I mayn't
with Olivia. She is so fine and graceful, a complete Matron-Lady-Quaker. She has given me two
little books. Olivia grows a charming girl--full of feeling, and thinner than she was.

But I have not time to fall in love.

Mary presents her general compliments. She keeps in fine health!

Huzza! boys, and down with the Atheists.

[Coleridge, having sent his wife and Hartley into the country, had, for a while, taken up his
abode with Lamb at Pentonville, and given up the Morning Post in order to proceed with his
translation of Schiller's Wallenstein. Lamb's forgery of Burton, together with those mentioned
in the next letter, which were never printed by Stuart, for whom they were written, was included
in the John Woodvil volume, 1802, among the "Curious Fragments, extracted from a commonplace
book, which belonged to Robert Burton, the famous Author of The Anatomy of Melancholy." See
the Miscellaneous Prose, Vol. I. of this edition.

"They are my oldest friends." Coleridge and Southey were, of course, older. The ballad I have
not found.

Mrs. Charles Lloyd, sen., nee Mary Farmer, and Olivia, her second daughter, had been staying
in London. Lamb had breakfasted with them.

The reference to Atheists is explained by a passage from Manning's letter to Lamb in March,
1800: "One thing tho' I must beg of you--that is not to call me Atheist in your letters--for
though it may be mere raillery in you, and not meant as a serious imputation on my Faith, yet,
if the Catholic or any other intolerant religion should [illegible] and become established
in England, (which [illegible] if the Bishop of R----r may be the case) and if the post-people
should happen to open and read your letters, (which, considering the sometimes quaintness of
their form, they may possibly be incited to do) such names might send me to Smithfield on a
hurdle,--and nothing upon earth is more discordant to my wishes, than to become one of the
Smithfield Illuminati."]

LETTER 53

CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS MANNING

[P.M. April 5, 1800.]

C.L.'s moral sense presents her compliments to Doctor Manning, is very thankful for his medical
advice, but is happy to add that her disorder has died of itself.

Dr. Manning, Coleridge has left us, to go into the north, on a visit to his god Wordsworth.
With him have flown all my splendid prospects of engagement with the "Morning Post," all my
visionary guineas, the deceitful wages of unborn scandal. In truth, I wonder you took it up
so seriously. All my intention was but to make a little sport with such public and fair game
as Mr. Pitt, Mr. Wilberforce, Mrs. Fitzherbert, the Devil, &c.--gentry dipped in Styx all over,
whom no paper javelin-lings can touch. To have made free with these cattle, where was the harm?
'twould have been but giving a polish to lampblack, not nigrifying a negro primarily. After
all, I cannot but regret my involuntary virtue. Damn virtue that's thrust upon us; it behaves
itself with such constraint, till conscience opens the window and lets out the goose.

I had struck off two imitations of Burton, quite abstracted from any modern allusions, which
it was my intent only to lug in from time to time to make 'em popular. Stuart has got these,
with an introductory letter; but, not hearing from him, I have ceased from my labours, but
I write to him today to get a final answer. I am afraid they won't do for a paper. Burton is
a scarce gentleman, not much known; else I had done 'em pretty well.

I have also hit off a few lines in the name of Burton, being a conceit of "Diabolic Possession."
Burton was a man often assailed by deepest melancholy, and at other times much given to laughing
and jesting, as is the way with melancholy men. I will send them you: they were almost extempore,
and no great things; but you will indulge them. Robert Lloyd is come to town. He is a good
fellow, with the best heart, but his feelings are shockingly unsane. Priscilla meditates going
to see Pizarro at Drury Lane to-night (from her uncle's) under cover of coming to dine with
me... heu! tempora! heu! mores!--I have barely time to finish, as I expect her and Robin every
minute.--Yours as usual.

C. L.

[For Coleridge's movements see note to the next letter.--"Pizarro" was Sheridan's drama. It
was acted this season, 1799-1800, sixty-seven times. Lamb's next letter to Manning, which is
not available for this edition, contained the promised copy of the "Conceit of Diabolical Possession."
It also contained a copy of Thekla's song in "Wallenstein," in Lamb's translation (see Vol.
IV.), which he says is better than the original "a huge deal".

C. LAMB, Umbra.

Land of Shadows, Shadow-month the 16th or 17th, 1800.

Coleridge, I find loose among your papers a copy of "Christabel." It wants about thirty lines;
you will very much oblige me by sending me the beginning as far as that line,--

"And the spring comes slowly up this way;"

and the intermediate lines between--

"The lady leaps up suddenly. The lovely Lady Christabel;"

and the lines,--

"She folded her arms beneath her cloak, And stole to the other side of the oak."

The trouble to you will be small, and the benefit to us very great! A pretty antithesis! A
figure in speech I much applaud.

Godwin has called upon us. He spent one evening here. Was very friendly. Kept us up till midnight.
Drank punch, and talked about you. He seems, above all men, mortified at your going away. Suppose
you were to write to that good-natured heathen--"or is he a shadow?" If I do not write, impute
it to the long postage, of which you have so much cause to complain. I have scribbled over
a queer letter, as I find by perusal; but it means no mischief.

I am, and will be, yours ever, in sober sadness,

C. L.

Write your German as plain as sunshine, for that must correct itself. You know I am homo unius
linguae: in English, illiterate, a dunce, a ninny.

[Having left Lamb, Coleridge went to Grasmere, where he stayed at Dove Cottage with Wordsworth
and finished his translation, which was ready for the printer on April 22. To what Lamb alludes
in his reference to the homily on "Realities" I cannot say, but presumably Coleridge had written
a metaphysical letter on this subject. Lamb returns to the matter at the end of the first part
of his reply.

Miss Wesley was Sarah Wesley (1760-1828), the daughter of Charles Wesley and, therefore, niece
of the great John and Samuel. She moved much in literary society. Miss Benjay, or Benje, was
in reality Elizabeth Ogilvy Benger (1778-1827), a friend of Mrs. Inchbald, Mrs. Barbauld and
the Aikins, and other literary people. Madame de Stael called her the most interesting woman
she had met in England. She wrote novels and poems and biographies. In those days there were
two East Streets, one leading from Red Lion Square to Lamb's Conduit Street, and one in the
neighbourhood of Clare Market.

D'Israeli was Isaac Disraeli, the author of The Curiosities of Literature and other books about
books and authors; Miss More was Hannah More, and her book, Strictures on the Modern System
of Female Education, 1799; Dr. Gregory I have not traced; Miss Seward was Anna Seward, the
Swan of Lichfield; and the Miss Porters were Jane and Anna Maria, authors (later) respectively
of The Scottish Chiefs and Thaddeus of Warsaw, and The Hungarian Brothers.

The proof-sheets were those of Wallenstein. Henry Sampson Woodfall was the famous printer of
the Letters of Junius.

Christabel, Coleridge's poem, had been begun in 1797; it was finished, in so far as it was
finished, later in the year 1800. It was published first in 1816.

"Homo unius linguae." Lamb exaggerated here. He had much Latin, a little Greek and apparently
a little French. The sentence is in the manner of Burton, whom Lamb had been imitating.

Here should come a letter dated April 23, 1800, to Robert Lloyd, which treats of obedience
to parental wish. Lloyd seems to have objected to attend the meetings of the Society of Friends,
of which he was a birthright member. Lamb bids him go; adding that, if his own parents were
to live again, he would do more things to please them than merely sitting still a few hours
in a week.]

LETTER 55

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

[? Spring, 1800.]

By some fatality, unusual with me, I have mislaid the list of books which you want. Can you,
from memory, easily supply me with another?

I confess to Statius, and I detained him wilfully, out of a reverent regard to your style.
Statius, they tell me, is turgid. As to that other Latin book, since you know neither its name
nor subject, your wants (I crave leave to apprehend) cannot be very urgent. Meanwhile, dream
that it is one of the lost Decades of Livy.

Your partiality to me has led you to form an erroneous opinion as to the measure of delight
you suppose me to take in obliging. Pray, be careful that it spread no further. 'Tis one of
those heresies that is very pregnant. Pray, rest more satisfied with the portion of learning
which you have got, and disturb my peaceful ignorance as little as possible with such sort
of commissions.

Did you never observe an appearance well known by the name of the man in the moon? Some scandalous
old maids have set on foot a report that it is Endymion. Dr. Stoddart talks of going out King's
Advocate to Malta. He has studied the Civil and Canon Law just three canon months, to my knowledge.
Fiat justitia, ruat caelum.

Your theory about the first awkward step a man makes being the consequence of learning to dance,
is not universal. We have known many youths bred up at Christ's, who never learned to dance,
yet the world imputes to them no very graceful motions. I remember there was little Hudson,
the immortal precentor of St. Paul's, to teach us our quavers: but, to the best of my recollection,
there was no master of motions when we were at Christ's.

Farewell, in haste.

C.L.

[Talfourd does not date this letter, merely remarking that it belongs to the present period.
Canon Ainger dated it June 22, 1800; but this I think cannot be right when we take into consideration
Letter 60 and what it says about Lamb's last letter to Coleridge (clearly that of May 12),
and the time that has since elapsed. The birth of Charles Lloyd's first child, July 31, gives
us the latest date to which Letter 60 could belong.

"Your theory ..."

[Hetty was the Lambs' aged servant.

[Manning's letter containing the choice poetry has not been preserved.

The friend in town was John Mathew Gutch (1776-1861), with whom Lamb had been at school at
Christ's Hospital, who was now a law stationer, in partnership with one Anderson, at 27 Southampton
Buildings, Chancery Lane, since demolished.]

LETTER 58

CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS MANNING

[No date. ? May 25, 1800.]

Dear Manning, I am a letter in your debt, but I am scarcely rich enough (in spirits) to pay
you.--I am writing at an inn on the Ware road, in the neighbourhood of which I am going to
pass two days, being Whitsuntide.--Excuse the pen, tis the best I can get.--Poor Mary is very
bad yet. I went yesterday hoping I should see her getting well, then I might have come into
the country more chearful, but I could not get to see her. This has been a sad damp. Indeed
I never in my life have been more wretched than I was all day yesterday. I am glad I am going
away from business for a little while, for my head has been hot and ill. I shall be very much
alone where I am going, which always revives me. I hope you will accept of this worthless memento,
which I merely send as a token that I am in your debt. I will write upon my return, on Thursday
at farthest. I return on Wednesday.--

God bless you.

I was afraid you would think me forgetful, and that made me scribble this jumble.

Sunday.

[Here probably also should come an unpublished letter from Lamb to Manning, in which Lamb remarks
that his goddess is Pecunia.

In another letter to Manning belonging to the same period, Lamb returns to the subject of poverty:--"You
dropt a word whether in jest or earnest, as if you would join me in some work, such as a review
or series of papers, essays, or anything.--Were you serious? I want home occupation, & I more
want money. Had you any scheme, or was it, as G. Dyer says, en passant? If I don't have a Legacy
left me shortly I must get into pay with some newspaper for small gains. Mutton is twelvepence
a pound."

Here should come a letter from Lamb to Robert Lloyd, in which he describes a visit to Gutch's
family at Oxford, and mentions his admiration for a fine head of Bishop Taylor in All Souls'
Library, which was an inducement to the Oxford visit. He refers to Charles Lloyd's settlement
in the Lakes, and suggests that it may be the means of again uniting him and Coleridge; adding
that such men as Coleridge and Wordsworth would exclude solitude in the Hebrides or Thule.

The following undated letter, which may be placed a little too soon in its present position,
comes with a certain fitness here:--]

LETTER 59

CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN MATHEW GUTCH

[No date. 1800.]

Dear Gutch, Anderson is not come home, and I am almost afraid to tell you what has happen'd,
lest it should seem to have happened by my fault in not writing for you home sooner.--

This morning Henry, the eldest lad, was missing. We supposd he was only gone out on a morning's
stroll, and that he would return, but he did not return & we discovered that he had opened
your desk before he went, & I suppose taken all the money he could find, for on diligent search
I could find none, and on opening your Letter to Anderson, which I thought necessary to get
at the key, I learn that you had a good deal of money there.

Several people have been here after you to-day, & the boys seem quite frightened, and do not
know what to do. In particular, one gentleman wants to have some writings finished by Tuesday--For
God's sake set out by the first coach. Mary has been crying all day about it, and I am now
just going to some law stationer in the neighbourhood, that the eldest boy has recommended,
to get him to come and be in the house for a day or so, to manage. I cannot think what detains
Anderson. His sister is quite frightend about him. I am very sorry I did not write yesterday,
but Henry persuaded me to wait till he could ascertain when some job must be done (at the furthest)
for Mr. Foulkes, and as nothing had occurrd besides I did not like to disturb your pleasures.
I now see my error, and shall be heartily ashamed to see you.

[That is as far as the letter goes on the first page. We then turn over, and find (as Gutch,
to his immense relief, found before us) written right across both pages:]

A BITE!!!

Anderson is come home, and the wheels of thy business are going on as ever. The boy is honest,
and I am thy friend. And how does the coach-maker's daughter? Thou art her Phaeton, her Gig,
and her Sociable. Commend me to Rob.

C. LAMB.

Saturday.

[This letter is the first example extant of Lamb's tendency to hoaxing. Gutch was at that time
courting a Miss Wheeley, the daughter of a Birmingham coachbuilder. It was while he was in
Birmingham that Lamb wrote the letter. Anderson was his partner in business. Rob would be Robert
Lloyd, then at Birmingham again. This, and one other, are the only letters of Lamb to Gutch
that escaped destruction.]

LETTER 60

CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE

[? Late July, 1800.]

Dear Coleridge,--Soon after I wrote to you last, an offer was made me by Gutch (you must remember
him? at Christ's--you saw him, slightly, one day with Thomson at our house)--to come and lodge
with him at his house in Southampton Buildings, Chancery-Lane. This was a very comfortable
offer to me, the rooms being at a reasonable rent, and including the use of an old servant,
besides being infinitely preferable to ordinary lodgings in our case, as you must perceive.
As Gutch knew all our story and the perpetual liability to a recurrence in my sister's disorder,
probably to the end of her life, I certainly think the offer very generous and very friendly.
I have got three rooms (including servant) under L34 a year. Here I soon found myself at home;
and here, in six weeks after, Mary was well enough to join me. So we are once more settled.
I am afraid we are not placed out of the reach of future interruptions. But I am determined
to take what snatches of pleasure we can between the acts of our distressful drama.... I have
passed two days at Oxford on a visit, which I have long put off, to Gutch's family. The sight
of the Bodleian Library and, above all, a fine bust of Bishop Taylor at All Souls', were particularly
gratifying to me; unluckily, it was not a family where I could take Mary with me, and I am
afraid there is something of dishonesty in any pleasures I take without her. She never goes
anywhere. I do not know what I can add to this letter. I hope you are better by this time;
and I desire to be affectionately remembered to Sara and Hartley.

I expected before this to have had tidings of another little philosopher. Lloyd's wife is on
the point of favouring the world.

Have you seen the new edition of Burns? his posthumous works and letters? I have only been
able to procure the first volume, which contains his life--very confusedly and badly written,
and interspersed with dull pathological and medical discussions. It is written by a Dr. Currie.
Do you know the well-meaning doctor? Alas, ne sutor ultra crepitum! [A few words omitted here.]

I hope to hear again from you very soon. Godwin is gone to Ireland on a visit to Grattan. Before
he went I passed much time with him, and he has showed me particular attentions: N.B. A thing
I much like. Your books are all safe: only I have not thought it necessary to fetch away your
last batch, which I understand are at Johnson's the bookseller, who has got quite as much room,
and will take as much care of them as myself--and you can send for them immediately from him.

I wish you would advert to a letter I sent you at Grasmere about "Christabel," and comply with
my request contained therein.

Love to all friends round Skiddaw.

C. LAMB.

[The Coleridges had recently moved into Greta Hall, Keswick.

Thomson would, I think, be Marmaduke Thompson, an old Christ's Hospitaller, to whom Lamb dedicated
Rosamund Gray. He became a missionary.

"Another little philosopher." Derwent Coleridge was born September 14, 1800. Lloyd's eldest
son, Charles Grosvenor Lloyd, was born July 31, 1800.

Dr. James Currie's Life of Burns was prefixed to an edition of his poems in 1800. Dugald Stewart
called it "a strong and faithful picture." It was written to raise funds for Burns' widow and
family.

Godwin had gone to stay with Curran: he saw much of Grattan also.

Johnson, the publisher and bookseller, lived at 72 St. Paul's Churchyard. I have just heard
that Mrs. Lloyd is delivered of a fine boy, and mother and boy are doing well. Fie on sluggards,
what is thy Sara doing? Lambe is quite enough.

I have hit off the following in imitation of old English poetry, which, I imagine, I am a dab
at. The measure is unmeasureable; but it most resembles that beautiful ballad of the "Old and
Young Courtier;" and in its feature of taking the extremes of two situations for just parallel,
it resembles the old poetry certainly. If I could but stretch out the circumstances to twelve
more verses, i.e., if I had as much genius as the writer of that old song, I think it would
be excellent. It was to follow an imitation of Burton in prose, which you have not seen. But
fate "and wisest Stewart" say No.

I can send you 200 pens and six quires of paper immediately, if they will answer the carriage
by coach. It would be foolish to pack 'em up cum multis libris et caeteris,--they would all
spoil. I only wait your commands to coach them. I would pay five-and-forty thousand carriages
to read W.'s tragedy, of which I have heard so much and seen so little--only what I saw at
Stowey. Pray give me an order in writing on Longman for "Lyrical Ballads." I have the first
volume, and, truth to tell, six shillings is a broad shot. I cram all I can in, to save a multiplying
of letters--those pretty comets with swingeing tails.

I'll just crowd in God bless you!

C. LAMB.

Wednesday night.

[The epic about Cain and Abel was "The Wanderings of Cain," which Coleridge projected but never
finished. The drama in which Got-fader performs would be perhaps "Faust"--"Der Herr" in the
Prologue--or some old miracle play.

"'Tis Burton's recipe." Lamb was just now steeped in the Anatomy; but there is no need to see
if Burton says this.

"Eliza Buckingham." Sara Coleridge's message was probably intended for Eliza, a servant at
the Buckingham Street lodgings.

Lambe was The Anti-Jacobin's idea of Lamb's name; and indeed many persons adhered to it to
the end. Mrs. Coleridge, when writing to her husband under care of Lamb at the India House,
added "e" to Lamb's name to signify that the letter was for Coleridge. Wordsworth later also
had some of his letters addressed in the same way--for the same economical reason.

Coleridge's "Lewti" was reprinted, with alterations, from the Morning Post, in the Annual Anthology,
Vol. II. Line 69 ran--

"Had I the enviable power;"

Coleridge changed this to--

"Voice of the Night! had I the power." Lamb objected to the phrase "My gentle-hearted Charles"
(see above). Lamb says "five years ago"; he means three. Coleridge did not alter the phrase.
It was against this poem that he wrote in pencil on his deathbed in 1834: "Ch. and Mary Lamb--dear
to my heart, yea, as it were, my heart.--S. T. C. Aet. 63, 1834. 1797-1834 = 37 years!"

"I have hit off the following"--"A Ballad Denoting the Difference between the Rich and the
Poor," first printed among the Imitations of Burton in the John Woodvil volume, 1802, see Vol. IV.

"And wisest Stewart"--Stuart of the Morning Post. Adapted from Milton's "Hymn on the Nativity"--

"But wisest Fate says no."

"W.'s (Wordsworth's) tragedy" was "The Borderers." The second edition of Lyrical Ballads was
just ready.]

LETTER 62

CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS MANNING [P.M. August 9, 1800.]

Dear Manning,--I suppose you have heard of Sophia Lloyd's good fortune, and paid the customary
compliments to the parents. Heaven keep the new-born infant from star-blasting and moon-blasting,
from epilepsy, marasmus, and the devil! May he live to see many days, and they good ones; some
friends, and they pretty regular correspondents, with as much wit as wisdom as will eat their
bread and cheese together under a poor roof without quarrelling; as much goodness as will earn
heaven! Here I must leave off, my benedictory powers failing me. I could curse the sheet full;
so much stronger is corruption than grace in the Natural Man.

And now, when shall I catch a glimpse of your honest face-to-face countenance again--your fine
dogmatical sceptical face, by punch-light? O! one glimpse of the human face, and shake of the
human hand, is better than whole reams of this cold, thin correspondence--yea, of more worth
than all the letters that have sweated the fingers of sensibility from Madame Sevigne and Balzac
(observe my Larning!) to Sterne and Shenstone.

Coleridge is settled with his wife and the young philosopher at Keswick with the Wordsworths.
They have contrived to spawn a new volume of lyrical ballads, which is to see the light in
about a month, and causes no little excitement in the literary world. George Dyer too, that
good-natured heathen, is more than nine months gone with his twin volumes of ode, pastoral,
sonnet, elegy, Spenserian, Horatian, Akensidish, and Masonic verse--Clio prosper the birth!
it will be twelve shillings out of somebody's pocket. I find he means to exclude "personal
satire," so it appears by his truly original advertisement. Well, God put it into the hearts
of the English gentry to come in shoals and subscribe to his poems, for He never put a kinder
heart into flesh of man than George Dyer's!

Now farewell: for dinner is at hand. C. L.

[Southey's letters contain a glimpse (as Mr. J.A. Rutter has pointed out) of Lamb and Manning
by punch-light. Writing in 1824, describing a certain expression of Mrs. Coleridge's face,
Southey says:--

First, then, it was an expression of dolorous alarm, such as Le Brun ought to have painted:
but such as Manning never could have equalled, when, while Mrs. Lloyd was keeping her room
in child-bed, he and Charles Lamb sate drinking punch in the room below till three in the morning--
Manning acting Le Brun's passions (punchified at the time), and Charles Lamb (punchified also)
roaring aloud and swearing, while the tears ran down his cheeks, that it required more genius
than even Shakespeare possessed to personate them so well; Charles Lloyd the while (not punchified)
praying and entreating them to go to bed, and not disturb his wife by the uproar they were making.

Southey's reminiscence, though interesting, is very confusing. Lamb does not seem to have visited
Cambridge between the end of 1799 and January 5, 1800. At the latter date the Lloyds were in
the north. Possibly Southey refers to an earlier illness of Mrs. Lloyd, which, writing after
a long interval, he confused with confinement.

"Balzac." Not, of course, the novelist; but Jean Louis Guez de Balzac (1594-1654) the letter-writer.

Two or three lines have been omitted from this letter which can be read as written only in
the Boston Bibliophile edition.]

LETTER 63

CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS MANNING

[P.M. August 11, 1800.]

My dear fellow (N.B. mighty familiar of late!) for me to come to Cambridge now is one of God
Almighty's impossibilities. Metaphysicians tell us, even He can work nothing which implies
a contradiction. I can explain this by telling you that I am engaged to do double duty (this
hot weather!) for a man who has taken advantage of this very weather to go and cool himself
in "green retreats" all the month of August.

But for you to come to London instead!--muse upon it, revolve it, cast it about in your mind.
I have a bed at your command. You shall drink rum, brandy, gin, aqua-vitae, usquebaugh, or
whiskey a' nights; and for the after-dinner trick I have eight bottles of genuine port, which,
if mathematically divided, gives 1-1/7 for every day you stay, provided you stay a week. Hear
John Milton sing,

"Let Euclid rest and Archimedes pause." Twenty-first Sonnet.

And elsewhere,--

  "What neat repast shall feast us, light[1] and choice,
   Of Attic taste, with wine,[2] whence we may rise
   To hear the lute well touch'd, or artful voice
   Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?"

Indeed, the poets are full of this pleasing morality--

  "Veni cito, Domine Manning!"

Think upon it. Excuse the paper: it is all I have.

N.B.--I lives at No. 27 Southampton Buildings, Holborn.

C. LAMB.
