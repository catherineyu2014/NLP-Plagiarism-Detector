BIBLIOGRAPHIE BIOGRAPHIQUE ou Dictionnaire de 33,000 Ouvrages, tant Anciens que Modernes relatifs,
à l'Histoire de la Vie des Hommes célèbres. 1 vol. imp. 8vo., double columns; about 900 pages.
Price about 2l. 12s. 6d. Literary Journals there are in abundance, many of them of the highest
degree of merit, which in their Reviews and Announcements show the current sayings and doings
of the literary world. There is not, however, one among them in which the reading many may
note, for the use of himself and his fellow-labourers in the wide field of Literature, the
minute facts which he meets with from time to time, and the value of which he so well knows,
or insert his Queries, in the hope of receiving satisfactory answers from some of his literary
brethren.

NOTES AND QUERIES, A MEDIUM OF INTER-COMMUNICATION FOR LITERARY MEN, is, as its name implies,
intended to supply this deficiency. Those who meet with facts worthy of preservation, may record
them in its columns; while those, again, who are pursuing literary inquiries, may, through
this MEDIUM, ask for information on points which have baffled their own individual researches.
How often is even the best informed writer stopped by an inability to solve some doubt or understand
some obscure allusion which suddenly starts up before him! How often does a reading man stumble
upon some elucidation of a doubtful phrase, or disputed passage;--some illustration of an obsolete
custom hitherto unnoticed;--some biographical anecdote or precise date hitherto unrecorded;--some
book, or some edition, hitherto unknown or imperfectly described.

NOTES AND QUERIES will be published every Saturday, price 3d., or stamped, 4d., and may be
had, by order, of all Booksellers and Newsmen, and will also be issued in Parts at the end
of each Month.

Communications for the Editor may be addressed to the Publisher, Mr. GEORGE BELL, No. 186.
Fleet Street, by whom also Advertisements will be received.

ILLUSTRATIONS of the REMAINS of ROMAN ART in CIRENCESTER, the SITE of ANCIENT CORINIUM. By
JAMES BUCKMAN, F.G.S. and C.H. NEWMARCH, Esq.

The work will have reference principally to the illustration of the following subjects:

1. The remains of the architecture of Corinium, including detailed drawings and descriptions
of the fine Tesselated Pavements, especially the one recently discovered, as also the beautiful
specimen on the estate of the Right Hon. Earl Bathurst.

2. The specimens of Roman Pottery--Vases, Urns, &c.

3. Works in Metals--Statuettes, Ornaments, &c. &c.

4. Coins.

In order that due justice may be done to the Illustration of these Remains, it is intended
to have them executed in the first style of art, and only a limited number of impressions will
be taken.

To secure early copies, orders must be addressed at once to Messrs. BAILY and JONES, Cirencester,
or Mr. GEORGE BELL, 186. Fleet Street.

Price to Subscribers, 12s.

*** After the close of the Subscription List, the price will be raised to 15s.

N.B.--Any person possessing Roman Antiquities from Cirencester, will confer a great favour
on the Authors by communicating intelligence of them to Messrs. Baily and Jones.

While so many publications illustrative of the Archaeology of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, have
appeared in this country, few attempts have been made to give a systematic view of the early
Antiquities of the British Islands.

The work, of which the present volume is a translation, was originally written by Mr. Worsaae,
for the Copenhagen Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge, and intended in the first
place, to show how the early history of the country might be read through its monuments, and
in the second, to awaken a greater interest for their preservation.
