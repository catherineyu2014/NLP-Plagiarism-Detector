North American Yellow Bats, "Dasypterus," And a List of the Named Kinds Of the Genus Lasiurus Gray

BY

E. RAYMOND HALL AND J. KNOX JONES, JR.

INTRODUCTION

Yellow bats occur only in the New World and by most recent authors have been referred to the
genus Dasypterus Peters. The red bats and the hoary bat, all belonging to the genus Lasiurus
Gray, also occur only in the New World except that the hoary bat has an endemic subspecies
in the Hawaiian Islands.

The kind of yellow bat first to be given a distinctive name was the smaller of the two species
that occur in North America. It was named Nycticejus ega in 1856 (p. 73) by Gervais on the
basis of material from the state of Amazonas, Brazil, South America, but was early recognized
as occurring also in North America (in the sense that México and Central America, including
Panamá, are parts of North America). More than 40 years elapsed before subspecific names were
proposed for the North American populations; Thomas named Dasypterus ega xanthinus in 1897
(p. 544) from Baja California, and Dasypterus ega panamensis in 1901 (p. 246) from Panamá.

The larger of the two North American species was named Lasiurus intermedius in 1862 (p. 246)
by H. Allen on the basis of material from extreme northeastern México. Another alleged species,
Dasypterus floridanus, was named in 1902 (p. 392) by Miller from Florida, but as set forth
below it is only a subspecies of L. intermedius, a species that is seemingly limited to parts
of the North American mainland and Cuba.

A third species, Atalapha egregia, allegedly allied to the small yellow bat, L. ega, was named
in 1871 (p. 912) by Peters from Santa Catarina, Brazil, but Handley (1960:473) thinks that
L. egregius is allied instead to the red bats. The species L. egregius has not been studied
in connection with the observations reported below.

Bats of the genus concerned were given the generic name Nycteris by Borkhausen in 1797 (p.
66), and the name Lasiurus by Gray in 1831 (p. 38). For much of the latter part of the 19th
century the generic name Atalapha proposed by Rafinesque in 1814 (p. 12) was used because it
antedated the name Lasiurus. In this period Harrison Allen (1894:137) raised to generic rank
the name Dasypterus that had been proposed by Peters in 1871 (p. 912) only as a subgenus for
the yellow bats. Since 1894 the yellow bats ordinarily have borne the generic name Dasypterus.
The red bats and the hoary bat continued to be referred to as of the genus Atalapha until early
in the 20th century when it was decided that a European bat of another genus was technically
the basis for the name Atalapha. Thereupon Lasiurus was again used in the belief that it was
the earliest available name for the bats concerned. But in 1909 (p. 90) Miller showed that
the name Lasiurus was preoccupied by Nycteris Borkhausen, 1797 (p. 66). From 1909 until 1914
in conformance with the Law of Priority Nycteris was used for the red bat and the hoary bat.

At this point it is desirable to digress and indicate why and how the Law of Priority came
into being. In the 19th century different technical names were used for the same kind of animal
depending on the opinions of individual authors. For example, one author used name A because
it was most descriptive of the morphology of the animal, another author used name B because
it had been used more often than any other, another author used name C because it was more
euphonious, etc. In order to achieve uniformity and stability a set of rules was drawn up in
1901 at the International Zoological Congress in Berlin. Those rules were based principally
on the rule, or law, of priority. In effect, the law stated that the technical name first given
to a kind of animal (with starting date as of January 1, 1758, Systema Naturae of Linnaeus)
would be the correct and official name. After the mentioned rules were adopted, some zoologists,
mostly non-taxonomists, objected to the rules and in response to these objections a compromise
was adopted in 1913 at the International Zoological Congress in Monaco and the International
Committee on Zoological Nomenclature was authorized to set aside, at its discretion, the Law
of Priority. In 1913 it was thought by everyone that the names conserved (nomina conservanda)
by setting aside the rules would be few.

Returning now to the generic names applied to the bats concerned, it is to be noted that from
1803 until 1909 Nycteris had been used as the generic name of an African bat on the erroneous
assumption that the name was first applied in a valid fashion to the African bat. With the
aim of conserving the name Nycteris for the African bat, some zoologists petitioned the International
Committee on Zoological Nomenclature to set aside the Law of Priority and petitioned also that
the name Lasiurus be validated for use again as the generic name for New World bats. This petition
was granted in 1914 in the first lot of names for which exception to the rules was made. As
a result, since 1914 Lasiurus has been used with increasing frequency, and Nycteris with decreasing
frequency, for New World bats.

The above explanation of the application of the generic names Nycteris, Atalapha, and Lasiurus
is given for two reasons: First, study of more abundant material than was available to Harrison
Allen in 1894 when he raised Dasypterus to generic rank reveals, as set forth beyond, that
the yellow bats are not generically different from the red bats and hoary bat and so will bear
the same generic name that is applied to the red bat and hoary bat; second, a choice of generic
names has to be made. Actually, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature since
1913 has voted to make many, instead of only a few, exceptions to the rules. The number of
names resulting from these exceptions is becoming so large that some zoologists fear that the
chaotic condition of nomenclature in the previous century will return. Those who hold such
fears maintain that adherence to the rules of 1901, or to the Law of Priority, or at least
to some rules, clearly is desirable. Certainly there is much logic in that view. According
to the rules, Nycteris is the correct name of the bats concerned. According to the Commission,
it is well to use instead the name Lasiurus. Perhaps the time has come to follow the rules
and use Nycteris. But, because of the possibility that the Commission will return to its policy
of 1913 and recommend only a few instead of many exceptions to the rules, the generic name
Lasiurus is tentatively used in the following accounts.

Genus Lasiurus Gray

Hairy-tailed Bats

    1797. Nycteris B[orkhause]n, Der Zoologe (Compendiose Bibliothek
    gemeinnützigsten Kenntnisse für alle Stände, pt. 21), Heft 4-7, p.
    66. Type, Vespertilio borealis Müller [= Lasiurus borealis].
    Nycteris Borkhausen is a homonym of Nycteris G. Cuvier and É.
    Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, 1795, type Vespertilio hispidus Schreber,
    1774 [= Nycteris hispida], from Senegal. Although Nycteris
    Cuvier and Geoffroy St.-Hilaire is a nomen nudum, Opinion 111 of
    the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature establishes
    the name as available for a genus of Old World bats. On this basis,
    Nycteris Borkhausen is not available for the New World genus.
    Nycteris É. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, 1803, is a synonym of
    Nycteris Cuvier and Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, 1795, as given status
    by the Commission.

    1831. Lasiurus Gray, Zool. Misc., No. 1, p. 38. Type,
    Vespertilio borealis Müller.

    1871. Atalapha Peters, Monatsber. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin,
    p. 907, and other authors [nec Atalapha Rafinesque, 1814].

    Type species.--Vespertilio borealis Müller.

    Members of this genus are notable for having three and even four
    young (more than other bats). In North America at least L.
    borealis and L. cinereus, are migratory.

    brownish-gray faintly washed with black to pale yellowish gray;
    size large (forearm, 45.2-62.8; condylocanine length, 16.9-21.5).

Distribution and Geographic Variation

Lasiurus intermedius H. Allen, type from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, has been reported from the
Rio Grande Valley of Texas southward to Honduras and in Cuba. Lasiurus floridanus (Miller),
type from Lake Kissimmee, Florida, has been recorded from southeastern Texas, eastward along
the Gulf of Mexico to Florida, and thence northward along the Atlantic Coast to extreme southeastern
Virginia (see records of occurrence beyond and Fig. 2). Specimens of intermedius from the vicinity
of the type locality and from other localities in México differ from specimens of floridanus
(from Florida and southern Georgia) as follows: Larger, both externally (especially forearm)
and cranially (see measurements); teeth larger and heavier; skull heavier and having more prominent
sagittal and lambdoidal crests; braincase less rounded, more elongate; auditory bullae relatively
smaller; upper parts averaging brighter (yellowish to yellowish-orange in general aspect, rather
than yellowish-brown to brownish-gray).

The differences mentioned above are of the magnitude of those that ordinarily separate subspecies
of a single species rather than two species. Miller (1902:392-393), in the original description
of floridanus, noted that the differences between it and intermedius were slight and remarked
(p. 393): "Indeed, it is probable that it intergrades with the Texas animal." Lowery (1936:17)
also has suggested that intergradation might occur between intermedius and floridanus "in southwestern
Louisiana or eastern Texas"; later (1943:223-224) he pointed out that specimens from Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, averaged larger in cranial dimensions than typical floridanus and again mentioned
the possibility of intergradation between the two kinds. Sanborn (1954:25-26) touched obliquely
on the problem when he wrote: "In Florida, Dasypterus intermedius is referred to as a Florida
yellow bat (Dasypterus floridanus)." Handley (1960:478) wrote that certain morphological similarities
suggested "gene flow" between the two kinds.

Specimens examined from Louisiana resemble floridanus from Georgia and Florida to the eastward
in external dimensions. Some of those specimens resemble floridanus in size of skull, but two
skulls from Louisiana are inseparable from those of topotypes of intermedius. The upper parts
of specimens from Louisiana are generally like those of animals to the east but average somewhat
paler (less brownish). The specimens seen from Louisiana seem to be intergrades between intermedius
and floridanus but clearly are assignable to the latter.

The picture is less clear as regards bats from southeastern Texas (one specimen each from Colorado
and Travis counties, and four specimens from Harris County). Five of the specimens have skulls
(the Travis County specimen is a skin only) and of these, four are clearly assignable, on the
basis of size and shape of the skull, to intermedius. The fifth skull (specimen from Colorado
County) is intermediate in size between floridanus and intermedius and on that basis alone
could be assigned with equal propriety to either. All these specimens from Texas more closely
resemble floridanus than intermedius in external size (forearms: 49.2, 49.6, 50.7, 49.9 (approximate),
49.6, 49.1). The pale yellowish-gray upper parts of the four adults, seemingly resulting from
a dilution of the brownish color found in floridanus, differ from the color of typical specimens
of both intermedius and floridanus, but the average is nearer that of floridanus than that
of intermedius. Color of pre-adult pelage in the one July-taken young of the year resembles
the color of adults. An August-taken young of the year is in process of acquiring the adult
pelage but the hairs have not reached their full growth; it is pale yellowish but not so grayish
as the other specimens. All characters considered, the specimens from eastern Texas resemble
floridanus more than they do intermedius, and so are provisionally assigned to floridanus (as
was done by Taylor and Davis, 1947:19; Eads, et al., 1956:440; and, Davis, 1960:59). Additional
material from southeastern Texas is needed. It will be remembered that the type locality of
intermedius is in the Rio Grande Valley; all specimens seen, in the study here reported on,
from the Texas side of the valley are unquestionably referable to that subspecies.

Intergradation, then, occurs between L. intermedius and L. floridanus in some degree in southern
Louisiana and in more marked degree in southeastern Texas. Specimens from the area of intergradation
vary more individually in many features than do specimens from other areas. In general the
intergrades tend to resemble floridanus in small size externally and intermedius in large size
of skull. The specimens from southeastern Texas differ from typical specimens of both subspecies
in color, being pale yellowish-gray (instead of yellowish to yellowish-orange as in intermedius
or yellowish brown to brownish-gray as in floridanus), and this difference is shared to some
extent with animals from Louisiana, the latter being somewhat intermediate between bats from
Texas and those from Florida and Georgia, although nearer those from Florida and Georgia.

An hypothesis to account for the variation noted is that in Wisconsin Time, and perhaps in
earlier Pleistocene times, this yellow bat was (as it is now) a warmth-adapted animal as Blair
(1959:461) would term it. Some cool period forced the mainland populations of the two species
into two refugia--peninsular Florida and eastern México--and the present area of intergradation
is, therefore, of a secondary rather than a primary type. Possibly also the relatively treeless
area of part of southern Texas has made for a sparse population there of Lasiurus intermedius
and gene flow now may be, and long may have been, slight between the eastern and southern segments
of the species.

It could be contended that the peculiar coloration of specimens from southeastern Texas, coupled
with the tendency to have a large skull (as has intermedius) and small external dimensions
(as has floridanus), justifies subspecific recognition for the animals that here are termed
intergrades. But, judging by the specimens now available, such subspecific recognition would
tend to obscure rather than clarify the geographic variation noted.

Life History

Probably bats of the species Lasiurus intermedius seek retreats primarily in trees (see Moore,
1949a:59-60) but Baker and Dickerman (1956:443) reported "approximately 45 yellow bats" concealed
on July 22, 1955, "among dried corn stalks hanging from the sides of a large open tobacco shed"
in the state of Veracruz. Young are born in late spring, three being the only number known
except that Davis (1960:59) was told that in the vicinity of Mission, Texas, two was the usual
number "born in May and June." Sherman (1945:194) reported a female with young (number not
given) taken on June 7, 1918, at Seven Oaks, Florida, and another with three young taken on
June 20, 1941, at Ocala, Florida. Lowery (1936:17) recorded a female, having three young, obtained
on June 17, 1932, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A specimen taken on May 19, 1940, at Baton Rouge
contained three embryos. Baker and Dickerman (loc. cit.) reported four adult females from Veracruz
as lactating on July 22, 1955, but they were accompanied by flying young of the year and probably
were near the end of the lactation period. Among specimens examined, juveniles are available
by date as follows: 5 mi. N Baton Rouge, Louisiana (June 26, 1953); Palm Beach, Florida (July
6, 1950); and Izamal, Yucatán ("taken with mother" on July 28, 1910). Breeding probably takes
place in autumn and winter; Sherman (op. cit.:196) reported males from Florida as sexually
"mature" from the beginning of September to mid-February. Late winter segregation of sexes
has been reported.

Subspecies

In the following accounts, localities of occurrence in each state are listed from north to
south; if two lie in the same latitude, the westernmost is listed first. Localities that are
italicized are not shown on the distribution map (Fig. 2), either because undue crowding of
symbols would result or, in several cases, because we could not precisely place the localities.
Length of forearm is the average of both forearms in individuals in which both forearms could
be measured.

Lasiurus intermedius insularis, new subspecies

    Holotype.--Adult female, preserved in alcohol but having skull
    removed, formerly in the Poey Museum, University of Havana, now No.
    81666, Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, from
    Cienfuegos, Las Villas Province, Cuba; obtained on January 23,
    1948, by D. Gonzáles Muñoz.

    Geographic distribution.--Known only from the island of Cuba (see
    Fig. 2).

    Diagnosis.--Large throughout (see measurements); sagittal crest
    enormously developed, especially posteriorly (height above
    braincase averaging 1.7 mm. in 4 specimens); interorbital region
    narrow; M3 narrow; mesostyle of M1 and M2 and 2nd commissure and
    cingulum of M3 small; pelage yellowish to reddish-brown.

    Comparisons.--From Lasiurus intermedius intermedius of the
    adjacent mainland of México, L. i. insularis differs as follows:
    Larger, both externally and cranially; sagittal crest relatively
    higher, especially posteriorly; interorbital region relatively
    narrower; palate longer posterior to tooth-rows; teeth distinctly
    larger throughout except M3, which is relatively (frequently
    actually) narrower, averaging 66.1 (62.5-71.0) per cent width of M2
    in insularis rather than 74.1 (66.6-79.3) per cent in 10
    intermedius from Brownsville, Texas; mesostyle of M1 and M2
    relatively smaller as are second commissure and cingulum of M3;
    coloration of No. 254714 USNM resembling that of L. i.
    intermedius, but coloration of three specimens, preserved in
    alcohol, averaging somewhat darker (more reddish-brown) than in
    intermedius.

    From Lasiurus intermedius floridanus of the adjacent Floridan
    mainland, L. i. insularis differs in many of the same ways that
    it differs from L. i. intermedius, except that the differences
    are even more trenchant because floridanus is smaller than
    intermedius. Indeed, the difference in size between floridanus
    and insularis is approximately the same as between Lasiurus
    borealis and Lasiurus cinereus.

    Measurements.--External measurements (all taken from specimens
    preserved in alcohol) of the holotype, followed by those of two
    other females, one from Laguna La Deseada, San Cristóbal, Pinar del
    Río Province, and the other from Bayate, Guantánamo, Oriente
    Province, are, respectively: Total length, 164, 161, 150; length of
    tail-vertebrae, 68, 76, 77; length of hind foot, 12, 12, 13; length
    of ear from notch, 20, 17, 19; length of forearm, 61.2, 62.6, 61.8.
    The length of forearm of a study skin from San Germán (that
    otherwise lacks external measurements) having wings spread is
    approximately 55.4. For cranial measurements see Table 1.

Remarks.--Four of the five specimens on which the name L. i. insularis is based differ to such
a degree from mainland populations of the species L. intermedius that specific rather than
subspecific recognition for the Cuban bat might seem warranted. It is because of the fifth
specimen (USNM 254714) that we accord subspecific rank to insularis. It is smaller than the
other Cuban specimens and except for longer condylocanine length, longer mandibular tooth-rows,
narrower interorbital region, and heavier dentition is indistinguishable in measurements from
the largest specimens of L. i. intermedius from the mainland. In addition, it appears not to
have the enormously developed sagittal crest of the other specimens of insularis although posteriorly
the dorsal part of the skull (where the crest is most prominent) is missing. USNM 254714 agrees
with the other Cuban specimens in having the mesostyle of M1 and M2 somewhat reduced and in
having a small M3 on which the cingulum and second commissure are poorly developed, and this
specimen is regarded as representative of the lower size limits of the Cuban population.

The skull from San Bias was found in an owl pellet (see de Beaufort, 1934:316).

Lasiurus ega

Southern Yellow Bat

    Diagnosis.--Upper parts yellowish-brown (much as in Lasiurus
    intermedius floridanus from Louisiana) having overlay of grayish
    or blackish anterior to shoulders; hair on basal half of
    interfemoral membrane more yellowish than elsewhere; size medium
    (forearm 42.7-52.2; condylocanine length 14.6-16.3).

This species occurs from the southwestern United States (Palm Springs, California, and Tucson,
Arizona) southward into Uruguay and northeastern Argentina. Of the six currently (see Handley,
1960) recognized subspecies of L. ega, four occur only in South America, and two occur only
in North America.

Cabrera (1958:115) regarded Dasypterus ega fuscatus Thomas (1901:246), based on three specimens
from Río Cauquete, Río Cauca, Colombia, as a synonym of Dasypterus ega panamensis Thomas (loc.
cit.) that was based on a specimen from Bogava, 250 meters elevation, Chiriquí, Panamá. The
latter name has line priority over fuscatus. Cabrera (1958:116) remarked that: "Las diferencias
que Thomas señaló entre el Dasypterus de Panamá y el de Colombia (fuscatus) nos parecen estar
dentro de los límites de la variación individual, siendo además muy raro que una especie de
quiróptero este representada en Colombia y en Panamá por razas diferentes."

On July 16, 1958, at the British Museum of Natural History, one of us (Hall) examined the holotypes
of panamensis and fuscatus, as well as other materials used by Thomas, and readily perceived
the differences that he pointed out. Thomas' description, although terse, is accurate. L. e.
fuscatus is much more blackish than panamensis. We are inclined to retain the two names as
applicable to two subspecies. Whether or not fuscatus is synonymized under panamensis, the
holotype of panamensis is an intergrade between the almost black Colombian animal (fuscatus)
and the paler individuals in Central America and territory north thereof. Even so, the holotype
of panamensis more closely resembles the blackish Colombian population than the paler populations
to the north and the name panamensis, therefore, is correctly applicable to the bat from Panamá,
but not to bats of the species Lasiurus ega from farther north as most authors (see, for example,
Hall and Kelson, 1959:194, map 143; and Handley, 1960:474) suggested was the case. For the
populations north of Panamá the name Lasiurus ega xanthinus (Thomas) (1897:544) needs to be used.

    Univ. Studies, Biol. Ser., 1:61, December 28.

    Geographic distribution.--Southern California, southern
    Arizona, and northern Coahuila southward through México to southern
    Costa Rica.

    Diagnosis.--Yellowish-brown with an overlay of grayish
    anterior to the shoulders; forearm, 42.7-47.2.

    Remarks.--Specimens from Baja California and the adjacent
    western part of the mainland of México average paler than specimens
    from Veracruz and some places in Central America but the
    differences are slight.

    Geographic distribution.--Panamá; also recorded by Handley
    (1960:474) from Venezuela.

    Diagnosis.--"General colour dark brownish clay-color, something
    between Ridgway's 'raw-umber' and 'clay-color'. Fur black basally,
    then dull brownish buffy, the extreme tips black. Center of face
    similar to back, cheeks from eyes to lips contrasting black. Rump
    and hairy part of interfemoral verging toward brownish fulvous.
    Under surface similar to upper." (Thomas, 1901:246.) Forearm of
    holotype, 46.5.

    Remarks.--Notes taken down by one of us (Hall) on July 16, 1958,
    at the British Museum, Natural History, contain the following:
    "Color accurately described by Thomas. The blackish stands out. The
    difference between the types of D. e. panamensis and D. e.
    xanthinus is tremendous."

    Record of occurrence.--Specimen examined, one, the type (British
    Mus.).

RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SPECIES OF LASIURUS

As suggested by Dalquest in 1953 (p. 62) and by Handley in 1959 (p. 119) and 1960 (p. 473),
the yellow bats, Lasiurus ega (Gervais) and Lasiurus intermedius H. Allen, so closely resemble
the hoary bat, Lasiurus cinereus (Palisot de Beauvois), and the red bats, Lasiurus borealis
(Müller) and the seven related species listed below, that all are properly included in a single
genus. Many of the common characteristics are enumerated above in the diagnosis of the genus
(see also Handley, 1960:473).

A listing of the differences between the species is less impressive than a listing of the resemblances.
The yellow bats differ less from the red bats than does the hoary bat, L. cinereus, which differs
from all of the others as follows: talonid on m3 larger; p4 single-rooted instead of double-rooted;
hypocone on M1 and M2 smaller; coronoid process lower; ossified part of tympanic ring, which
shields the petrosal, larger; humerus relatively shorter; forearm relatively longer; first
phalanx of middle finger relatively shorter; presternum including keel longer than wide instead
of vice versa. The differences in the sternum and proportions of the forelimb reflect the more
rapid flight of the hoary bat. The yellow bats differ from the red bats and hoary bat in long
rostrum, pronounced sagittal crest, high coronoid process, absence of the first upper premolar,
long first phalanx of the third digit and short terminal (3rd) phalanx of the same digit. Features
in which the red bats are extreme in the genus are short rostrum, short forearm, and relatively
longer second phalanx of the third finger. The red bats differ only slightly one from another.

Next to nothing is known of extinct Tertiary ancestors of species of the genus Lasiurus. Also
relatively little is known about Lasiurus in the Pleistocene. Consequently, evolution of the
living species has to be inferred almost entirely from what is known about their structure,
habits, and geographic distribution. Figure 4 presents some ideas concerning relationships.
