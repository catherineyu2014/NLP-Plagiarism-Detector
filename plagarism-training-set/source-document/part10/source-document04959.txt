"Love and Death," by Watts, page 158 .--Point from which drapery radiates on figure of Death
exactly Phi proportion with top and bottom of picture.

Point where right-hand side of right leg of Love cuts dark edge of steps exactly Phi proportion
with sides of picture.

"Surrender of Breda," by Velazquez, page 161 .--First spear in upright row on the right top
of picture, exactly Phi proportion with sides of canvas. Height of gun carried horizontally
by man in middle distance above central group, exactly Phi proportion with top and bottom of
picture. This line gives height of group of figures on left, and is the most important horizontal
line in the picture.

"Birth of Venus," Botticelli, page 166 .--Height of horizon line Phi proportion with top and
bottom of picture. Height of shell on which Venus stands Phi proportion with top and bottom
of picture, the smaller quantity being below this time. Laterally the extreme edge of dark
drapery held by figure on right that blows towards Venus is Phi proportion with sides of picture.

"The Rape of Europa," by Paolo Veronese, page 168 .--Top of head of Europa exactly Phi proportion
with top and bottom of picture. Right-hand side of same head slightly to left of Phi proportion
with sides of picture (unless in the reproduction a part of the picture on the left has been
trimmed away, as is likely, in which case it would be exactly Phi proportion).

I have taken the first seven pictures reproduced in this book that were not selected with any
idea of illustrating this point, and I think you will admit that in each some very important
quantity has been placed in this proportion. One could go on through all the illustrations
were it not for the fear of becoming wearisome; and also, one could go on through some of the
minor relationships, and point out how often this proportion turns up in compositions. But
enough has been said to show that the eye evidently takes some especial pleasure in it, whatever
may eventually be found to be the physiological reason underlying it.
