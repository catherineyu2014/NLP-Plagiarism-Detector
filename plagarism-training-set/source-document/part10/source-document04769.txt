The Obituary of the Gentleman's Magazine is generally allowed to be one of its most valuable
features, and unremitting attention is devoted to the task of making it as complete and comprehensive
as possible. It records the decease of all persons of station in society or of individual merit,
and biographical memoirs are given (amounting every year to more than three hundred) of eminent
characters, whether statesmen, senators, officers in the public service, members of the learned
professions, men of science, authors, artists, &c. &c. The Magazine for January will contain,
among others, Memoirs of Her Majesty the Queen Dowager; Sir John Dashwood King, Bart.; Sir
Thomas Lethbridge, Bart.; Rear-Adm. Sir S.J.B. Pechell, Bart.; Admiral Sir J. Hawkins Whitshed;
General Sir George Anson; General Sir John Vandeleur; Lieut.-Col. John Browne; Charles Lyell,
Esq.; John Musters, Esq.; Louis Hayes Petit, Esq.; Wm. Cooke Taylor, L.L.D.; Mr. Kenney, the
dramatist; Charles Edw. Horn, the composer, &c. &c.

The Number for January will be embellished with two Plates of the Roman Pavements recently
found at Cirencester.
