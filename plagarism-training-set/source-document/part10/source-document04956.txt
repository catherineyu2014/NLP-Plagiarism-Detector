The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy by Ordericus Vitalis, translated with Notes,
and the Introduction of Guizot, by Thomas Forrester, M.A. Vol. I., is a new volume of the interesting
Series of Translations of the early Church Historians of England publishing by Mr. Bohn, to
which we propose calling the especial attention of our readers at some future period. The importance
which our French neighbours attach to the writings of Ordericus Vitalis is shown by the fact
that the French Historical Society, after publishing a translation, are now issuing an edition
of the original text, from a laborious collation of the best MSS., under the editorship of
M. Auguste le Prevost. The present translation is based upon that edition.

We have on several occasions called the attention of our readers to the Collection of Proclamations
in the possession of the Society of Antiquaries, and to the endeavours making by that learned
body to secure as complete a series as possible of these valuable but hitherto little used
materials for English History. Some contributions towards this object have, we believe, been
the results of our notices; and we have now to state, that at the opening meeting on Thursday
the 17th, it was announced that William Salt, Esq., F.S.A., had presented to the library two
volumes of Proclamations of the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. Great as is the pecuniary
value of this munificent donation, it is far exceeded by its importance in filling up a large
gap in the existing Series. A Catalogue Raisonnée of the whole collection is in preparation
by Robert Lemon, Esq., of the State Paper Office, a gentleman well qualified for the task,
and its early publication may, we trust, be received as an evidence of the beneficial influence
which the Society of Antiquaries is hereafter destined to exercise on the historical literature
of England.

BOHN'S BRITISH CLASSICS.--Under the above Title is this Day commenced a New Series (which has
long been in preparation), uniform in Size and Price with the Standard Library. It will comprise
full and complete Editions of the great Authors of our Literature, including especially those
which at present exist only in scarce or expensive Editions. Among the early Volumes will be
GIBBON'S DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, with VARIORUM NOTES, comprising not only all
those given in the Original Quarto Edition, but also the Notes of Guizot, Wenck, and other
Foreign Editors, as well as whatever has been derived from the later Researches of Niebuhr,
Layard, &c. A Portrait of the Author and Plates, whenever essential as Illustrations, will
be added, on the same plan as the recent Edition of SOUTHEY'S COWPER published in the STANDARD
LIBRARY.

Although it is deemed expedient to enter on a New Series under the Title of BRITISH CLASSICS,
to enable the Publisher, without farther delay, to fructify a long cherished scheme, the Standard,
Scientific, Antiquarian, Illustrated, Classical, Philological, and Ecclesiastical Libraries
will be continued with undiminished attention.

DANUBIAN PROVINCES.--RANKE'S HISTORY OF SERVIA, and the SERVIAN REVOLUTION. With an Account

PICTORIAL HANDBOOK OF LONDON, comprising its Antiquities, Architecture, Arts, Manufacture,
Trade, Social, Literary, and Scientific Institutions, Exhibitions, and Galleries of Art; together
with some Account of the principal Suburbs and most attractive Localities. Illustrated with
205 Engravings on Wood, by Branston, Jewitt, and others; and a very large and complete Map,
engraved by Lowry. Post 8vo. cloth. 5s.

This volume, of which the former editions were published by Mr. Weale at 9s., contains above
900 pages, and is undoubtedly the cheapest five shilling volume ever produced.

On Thursday, the 5th of January, 1854, will be published, price Twopence, the First of a Series
of Works, entitled ORR'S CIRCLE OF THE SCIENCES; consisting of Short Treatises on the Fundamental
Principles and Characteristic Features of Scientific and Practical Pursuits. With Numerous
Illustrative Engravings on Wood.

MESSRS. W. S. ORR & CO. have to announce the Early Publication, in Weekly Numbers, of a Series
of Short Treatises, which will include every useful and attractive section of human acquirement,
whether scientific, practical, or descriptive; and which will be issued at a price so moderate
as to place them within the reach of every member of the community.

Although every subject will be treated in a philosophic spirit, yet it will not be forgotten
that the work is designed for popular use; and therefore the Editor and the various Contributors
will endeavour to clothe the whole Series, and the Scientific Treatises especially, in simple
language, so as to render them easy introductions to practical studies.

To carry the design into effect, assistance has been obtained from eminent scientific men:
and the Editor has the satisfaction of announcing among the Contributors to the first year's
volumes the names of Professor Owen, of the Royal College of Surgeons; Sir William Jardine,
Bart.; Professors Ansted and Tennant, of King's College; the Rev. Walter Mitchell, of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital; and Professor Young, Examiner in Mathematics at the University of London. Every confidence,
therefore, may be placed in the publication, as regards its soundness of principle, its extent
of information, and its accordance with the results of the latest researches and discoveries.

During the first year either three or four volumes will be completed. The respective subjects
will not be issued in consecutive weeks; but the paging of each series will be continuous:--so
that the whole, when collected at the end of the year, will form separate Volumes, with Title-pages,
Prefaces, Tables of Contents, Indices--each Volume being a distinct work on Natural Philosophy,
on the Two Great Divisions of Natural History, and on the Mathematical Sciences.

The "Circle of the Sciences" will thus, by the aid of copious Analytical Indices, combine all
the advantages of an Encyclopædia, as a work of reference, without the irksome repetition which
alphabetical arrangements necessarily involve.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the 1st of December an Introductory Treatise,

    "On the NATURE, CONNECTION, and USES of the GREAT DEPARTMENTS of HUMAN
    KNOWLEDGE."

Will be issued; but the Publication of the Work itself will not commence until January, 1854.

"Orr's Circle of Sciences" can be supplied by every Bookseller in the Kingdom; of whom a detailed
Prospectus, containing Specimen Page and List of Subjects, may be had.
