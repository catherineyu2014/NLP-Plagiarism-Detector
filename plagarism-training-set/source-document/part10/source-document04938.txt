I may here notice that, in my second expedition, as it was anticipated that I should require
adequate provision for water conveyance, at one stage or other of my journey down the Morumbidgee,
I was furnished with a whale-boat, the dimensions of which are given below. She was built by
Mr. Egan, the master builder of the dock-yard and a native of the colony, and did great credit
to his judgment. She carried two tons and a half of provisions, independently of a locker,
which I appropriated for the security of the arms, occupying the space between the after-seat
and the stern. She was in the first instance put together loosely, her planks and timbers marked,
and her ring bolts, &c. fitted. She was then taken to pieces, carefully packed up, and thus
conveyed in plank into the interior, to a distance of four hundred and forty miles, without
injury. She was admirably adapted for the service, and rose as well as could have been expected
over the seas in the lake. It was evident, however, that she would have been much safer if
she had had another plank, for she was undoubtedly too low. The following were her dimensions:--

  Breadth across 7th timber aft, 5 ft. 1/2 an inch outside.
  Across 12th timber, 5 ft. 11 1/4 in.
  Across 17th timber forward, 5 ft.
  25 ft. 8 in. in length inside.
  Curve of the keel No. 1, from the after side of each apron, 3 ft. 3 3/4in.
  No. 2, from head to head of the dead wood, 13 1/2 in.
  No. 3, from one end of keel to the other inner side, 3 in.
  No. 4, round of keel from the toe of each dead wood, 7/8 1/16th.
  The timbers were marked, beginning from the stern to the bow on the
  starboard side, and from bow to stern on the larboard.

APPENDIX No. I.

LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS. CAPTAIN IN THE 39TH REGIMENT OF FOOT.

Whereas it has been judged expedient to fit out an expedition for the purpose of exploring
the interior of New Holland, and the present dry season affords a reasonable prospect of an
opportunity of ascertaining the nature and extent of the large marsh or marshes which stopped
the progress of the late John Oxley Esq, Surveyor General, in following the courses of the
rivers Lachlan and Macquarie in the years 1817 and 1818. And whereas I repose full confidence
in your abilities and zeal for conducting such an expedition, I do hereby constitute and appoint
you to command and take charge of the expedition now preparing for the purpose of exploring
the interior of the country, and for ascertaining, if practicable, the nature and extent of
the marsh or marshes above mentioned.

In the prosecution of this service, you will be guided generally by the following instructions.

1. You will be accompanied on this expedition by Mr. Hamilton Hume, whose great experience
in travelling through the remote parts of the Colony, cannot fail to be highly useful to you.
You will also be attended by two soldiers and six convicts, of whom one is to understand the
shoeing of horses, one to be a carpenter, one a harness-maker and three stock-men, and you
will be provided with six horses and twelve bullocks.

2. A small boat has been built here for the use of the expedition, and for its conveyance,
there is provided a light four-wheeled carriage to be drawn by two bullocks.

The deputy Commissary General has received orders for supplying the expedition with provisions
of the best quality sufficient for six months' consumption, together with tents, blankets,
clothing, pack-saddles, utensils, instruments, tools, and necessaries of all kinds of which
you are likely to stand in need. Orders are also given for providing you with arms and ammunition,
with rockets for signals, and an ample supply of simple medicines--You are to consider it an
important duty to attend to the providing of all these supplies, and to take care that not
only every article is of the best quality that can be procured, but also that no article be
wanting with which you may desire to be provided.

3. Orders are given for forwarding without delay all your provisions, stores and supplies of
every kind to Wellington Valley, at which place, you, Mr. Hume, and all your men are to rendezvous
as soon as possible. Mr Maxwell, the superintendent, will furnish you with well-trained bullocks,
and afford you all the assistance you may require in arranging every thing for your departure
from that station.

4. After you shall have completed all your arrangements, you are to lose no time in finally
departing from Wellington Valley in prosecution of the immediate objects of the expedition.

5. You are first to proceed to Mount Harris, where you are to form a temporary depot, by means
of which you will have an opportunity of more readily communicating with Mr. Maxwell.

6. You are then to endeavour to determine the fate of the Macquarie River, by tracing it as
far as possible beyond the point to which Mr. Oxley went, and by pushing westward, you are
to ascertain if there be any high lands in that direction, or if the country be, as it is supposed,
an unbroken level and under water. If you should fail in these objects, you will traverse the
plains lying behind our north-west boundaries, with a view to skirt any waters by which you
may have been checked to the westward; and if you should succeed in skirting them, you are
to explore the country westward and southward as far as possible, endeavouring to discover
the Macquarie beyond the marsh of Mr. Oxley, and following it to its mouth if at all practicable.

7. There is some reason to believe that the over-flowing of the Macquarie when visited by Mr.
Oxley, was occasioned by heavy rains falling in the mountains to the eastward, and that as
you are to visit the same spot at a different season of the year, you may escape such embarrassment;
but although you should get beyond the point at which Mr. Oxley stopped, it would not be prudent
to risk your own health or that of your men, by continuing long in a swampy country. Therefore
it may be advisable for you in the first instance to leave the greater part of your men, bullocks,
and baggage, at Mount Harris, and if you should see a probability of your being able to cross
into the interior, you will then return to Mount Harris for such additional supplies as you
may judge necessary. You can there communicate with Mr. Maxwell respecting any ulterior arrangements
which you may be desirous of making.

8. The success of the expedition is so desirable an object, that I cannot too strongly impress
upon you the importance of perseverance in endeavouring to skirt any waters or marshes which
may check your course as long as you have provisions sufficient for your return; but you must
be cautious not to proceed a single day's journey further than where you find that your provisions
will be barely sufficient to enable you to reach the nearest place at which you can depend
upon getting supplies.

9. If after every endeavour you should find it totally impracticable to get to the westward,
you are still to proceed northward, keeping as westerly a direction as possible; and when the
state of your provisions will oblige you to retreat, you will be guided by your latitude, as
to the place to which you are to make the best of your way, but you are not to make for any
place on the coast, if Wellington valley should still be nearer.

10. You must be aware that the success of the expedition will greatly depend upon the time
for which your provisions will hold out, and therefore you will see the great importance of
observing every possible economy in the expenditure of provisions, and preventing waste of
every kind.

11. You are to keep a detailed account of your proceedings in a journal, in which all observations
and occurrences of every kind, with all their circumstances, however minute, are to be carefully
noted down. You are to be particular in describing the general face of all the country through
which you pass, the direction and shape of the mountains, whether detached or in ranges, together
with the bearings and estimated distances of the several mountains, hills, or eminences from
each other. You are likewise to note the nature of the climate, as to heat, cold, moisture,
winds, rains, &c., and to keep a register of the temperature from Fahrenheit's thermometer,
as observed at two or three periods of each day. The rivers, with their several branches, their
direction, velocity, breadth, and depth, are carefully to be noted. It is further expected
that you will, as far as may be in your power, attend to the animal, vegetable, and mineral
productions of the country, noting down every thing that may occur to you, and preserving specimens
as far as your means will admit, especially some of all the ripe seeds which you may discover;
when the preservation of specimens is impossible, drawings or detailed accounts of them, are
very desirable.

Given at Sydney, this eighteenth day of November, 1828. By Command of His Excellency the Governor,
ALEXANDER M'LEAY.
