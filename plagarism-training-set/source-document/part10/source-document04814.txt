PREFACE

The collection of early printed books presented to the Library of Yale University in 1894 by
Mr. William Loring Andrews, of New York, was formed to illustrate the first century of printing,
which is a better boundary for the survey than the half-century ending with the year 1500,
more often chosen. The latter, the so-styled cradle period of the art, is wanting in real definition,
being at most a convenient halting place, not a completed stage, whereas at the middle of the
sixteenth century the printed book of the better class had acquired most of its maturer features
and no longer has for us an unfamiliar look. Designed to serve as a permanent exhibition, it
is a selection rather than a collection, not large, but wisely chosen, and no less attractive
than instructive, having been formed a quarter of a century ago, at a time when opportunities
were unusually favorable.

The surviving books of the first presses, which are the chief sources of our knowledge of the
early art, are at the same time, when obtainable, the most efficient teachers. For the illustration
of the typography, the feature of first importance, there is nothing comparable to the open
pages of a representative series of the original books, such as are here spread out before
us. The best of the available substitutes, phototype reproductions of specimen pages, apart
from other limitations, must always lack the authority and the impressiveness of the originals.

While it is the main office of the present collection to set before the students of the University
as a whole the more general features of the art of the early printer, a further service which
it is prepared to render must not be overlooked. To such as are prompted to go into the subject
more deeply it offers an excellent body of the original material upon which any serious study
must of necessity be based.

The two fine fifteenth century MSS. at the head of the collection, far from serving a merely
ornamental purpose, like their own illuminated initials for example, are a needful introduction.
It is obvious that from such sources the first printers got the models of their types, and
the MSS. in which Jenson found the prototypes of his famous roman characters, which in the
judgment of some are still unsurpassed, could not have been very remote from these. Some of
the more striking features which distinguish the early printed books from the later were not
original with them, but only survivals from the MSS. The abbreviations and contractions in
which both abound were the labor-saving devices of the copyists, adopted without hesitation
by the printers who used the MSS. as copy and only slowly abandoned. The copyist left spaces
in his MS. for initials to be supplied by the illuminator, without which his work was not considered
complete, and for about a hundred years the printer continued to do the same. If the copyist
saw fit to attach his name to his work, we look for it at the end of the volume and there also
the printer placed his colophon. Signatures and catchwords, to guide the binder in the arrangement
of the sheets, did not come in with the printed book, but had long been in use in the MSS.

Although out of the hundreds of presses active during the first century only a score are here
represented, leaving wide gaps in the series, it is better, because more nearly in the natural
line of development, that the books should be ranged under the country, the locality and the
press to which they severally belong, than that they should be kept in strict chronological
order. A general chronological order underlies the geographical even where it does not come
to the surface. By right of seniority Germany stands at the head, and Mainz, the birthplace
of printing, is followed by the other German towns in the order of their press age. Next come
the presses of Italy, France, Holland and England, arranged in like order. To prevent, however,
too wide a departure from the chronological succession which would result from the strict application
of this rule, the later, i.e., the sixteenth century, Venice and Paris books are separated
from the earlier and transferred to the end of the list, where in point of development they
properly belong. Placed in the order thus indicated, the books, as befits so small a total,
are numbered consecutively in one series. The conspectus, which brings into one view the titles,
dates, places and printers' names, will serve also as a sufficient index.

While we are here most concerned with the genealogy and family history of the books, or in
other words with their press relationships, the personal history attaching to them--habent
sua fata libelli--is not without interest. The Zeno MS. and the Philo, printed on vellum, are
the dedication copies, not merely set apart, but specially prepared for this use. In a few
of the volumes are found the names or the arms of early owners. The Livy MS. and one-half of
the printed books are from the library, dispersed in 1886, of Michael Wodhull (1740-1816) of
Thenford, Northamptonshire, the first translator into English verse of all the extant works
of Euripides, the most assiduous and painstaking and in some departments of bibliography the
best equipped among the book collectors of his day. It was his custom (well illustrated in
the present collection) to enter on the fly-leaf of each purchase the source and the cost,
adding as a separate item the binding, often by Roger Payne, and to affix his name and the
date. His visé "Collat: & complet:" is seldom wanting and often bibliographical notes and references
to authorities are added. Justinian's Novellae, printed by Schoeffer, and all the Aldine press
books save one are from the library gathered at Syston Park, Lincolnshire, by Sir John Thorold
and his son, Sir John Hayford Thorold, between 1775 and 1831 and sold in 1884.

One valued mark of ownership, common to all the volumes, is the ex libris of the lover of choice
books who united them in one family, not again to be separated, and gave them into the keeping
of the University Library.

The accompanying list of Authorities, as will be apparent, is intended to supply merely the
details necessary to complete the references of the catalogue.

Acknowledgments are due from the compiler to his associates in the Library and the University
for assistance in the catalogue.

MANUSCRIPTS

1. ZENO, JACOPO. Vitæ, morum, rerumque gestarum Caroli Zeni libri X.
    1458.

Fine white vellum, 192 leaves, in 19 quires of ten leaves each and two additional leaves at
the end, the last of which is blank. Signed on the lower inner angle of the last page of each
quire by a letter (A-T) which is repeated at the point directly facing it on the first page
of the next quire. Leaves four to seven of the first quire and all of quires three to eight,
a total of sixty-four leaves, have 28 lines to the page, the rest 27 lines. Ruled on one side
only with a hard point. Leaf 10-1/2 × 7 in., text-page 7 × 3-3/4 in.

Written in regular Italian minuscules of the 15th century, formed on the models of the 11th
and 12th centuries.

The subject of the memoir is the distinguished Venetian Admiral Carlo Zeno (1334-1418), brother
of Nicolo and Antonio, reputed discoverers of America. His biographer, Jacopo Zeno (1417-1481),
Bishop of Feltre and Belluno, and later of Padua, was his grandson. The work is dedicated to
Pius II. in honor of his recent elevation to the papal throne, and since this is evidently
the dedication copy, the accession of Enea Silvio Piccolomini in August, 1458, fixes approximately
the date of the MS. In April, 1460, Jacopo Zeno was translated to the see of Padua.

The execution and the decoration of the MS. are in keeping with its special use. The gratulatory
preface occupying ten pages is introduced by the following heading in letters of burnished gold:

IN LIBROS VITÆ MORVM RERVMQ: GESTARVM CAROLI ZENI VENETI. AD PIVM SECVNDVM PONTIFICEM MAXIMVM.
IACOBI FELTRENSIS ET BELLVNENSIS ANTISTITIS PRAEFATIO: [G]LORIOSA.... The ornamentation of
the ten-line illuminated initial G is of the interlaced style, and a border of similar pattern
surrounds the entire page, enclosing on the front margin vignettes--a vase, two rabbits and
a stork--and at the foot the Piccolomini arms, supported by kneeling angels and surmounted
by the papal keys and tiara. Each of the ten books has a heading in burnished gold in which
the dedication to Pius II. is repeated, and an initial of like character to that of the preface,
with a marginal ornament. The occasional marginal subject-headings and the book-number at the
top of each leaf are likewise in gold.

The Latin text has thus far been printed only in Muratori's Rerum Italicarum Scriptores (of
which a new edition is now in progress), vol. xix, Milan, 1731, from a MS. then, and still,
preserved in the library of the Episcopal Seminary at Padua. This MS., the only one which he
was able to discover, Muratori describes in the following language: "Codex autem Patavinus
quamquam pervetustus a non satis docto Librario profectus est ac proinde occurrunt ibi quaedam
parum castigata, quaedam etiam plane vitiata. Mutilus praeterea est in fine, ubi non multa
quidem sed tamen aliqua desiderantur." Muratori's text breaks off in the middle of a sentence
at the end of the nineteenth (i.e. the last full) quire of our MS., and accordingly lacks only
the seventeen lines contained on the next leaf, which is the last. If, as seems quite possible,
the quiring of the two MSS. is the same, the loss of the single unprotected leaf at the end
is the more readily explained.

In 1591 there was published at Bergamo an abridged Italian version, made from an illuminated
MS. which had once belonged to the famous library of Matthias Corvinus, but was then in the
possession of Caterino Zeno, governor of Bergamo. It had been among the spoils carried to Constantinople
after the capture of Buda by the Turks in 1526. There, seven years later, it had been bought
and carried back to Italy by Caterino's father, the younger Nicolo, who, in 1558, first gave
to the world the narrative of his ancestors' voyages. For no better reasons than that the Paduan
MS. also was illuminated in gold and colors, and that it had been bought twenty-five years
before (c. 1700) in Venice where this branch of the Zeno family had become extinct, Muratori
was inclined to identify it with the Corvinus MS. The relations between Pius II. and the king
of Hungary, who was his ally in the proposed crusade against the Turks upon which he was just
embarking when overtaken by death, and to whom the 48,000 ducats which he left behind him were
sent in aid of the prosecution of war, suggest another possibility. It may be safely assumed
that between the present MS., given only an opportunity to acquire it, and any other copy the
king's choice could not have hesitated.

The MS. is in 18th-century Italian binding, red morocco, gilt edges. Sold with other MSS. from
the library of the Trivulzio family of Milan at Leavitt's auction, New York City, November, 1886.

2. LIVIUS, TITUS. Historiarum Romanarum libri I-X. Late 15th century.

Vellum. 336 leaves, the last blank. 34 quires all having ten leaves, except the 17th and 34th
which have eight each. 31 lines to the page; catchword placed at right angles with the last
line of the quire; ruled on both sides with plummet. Leaf 14-1/2 × 10 in., text-page 9 × 6 in.

Written in very regular, bold Italian minuscules of the period of the Renaissance.

The first page of the preface is surrounded by an illuminated border in gold and colors in
the Renaissance style of ornament, into which are introduced the Caraccioli arms belonging
to the distinguished Neapolitan family of that name. The initial F on this page is historiated
with a view of Rome, and each of the ten books has an eight-line initial of dull gold on a
background of red, blue and green, with marginal ornamentation.

From the close agreement, even in punctuation, between this MS. and the edition printed at
Milan in 1495 by Ulrich Scinzenzeler for Alexander Minutianus, and from other features which
forbid the supposition that one is taken directly from the other, we must conclude that they
both reproduce a common ancestor.

This MS. of the first Decade of Livy is in unusually fine preservation, and is bound in russia
extra, with broad borders of gold and gilt marbled edges.

Brought from Palermo by Dr. Anthony Askew (1722-1772), it was sold with his collection of MSS.
in 1785. Michael Wodhull, Esq., of Thenford, Northamptonshire, who gave seven guineas for the
volume at "White's sale" in March, 1798, added to his customary entry of these details on the
fly-leaf this note: "This appears to be the very Book which I saw Sir W. Burrell purchase at
Dr. Askew's manuscript Auction (No. 482) for thirty-two guineas; in Sir W. Burrell's Auction,
May, 1796, it is said to have gone for about five (No. 657). The note in Bib. Askev. manuscripta
is: 'Ex Panormo in Sicilia hunc cod. adduxit secum Cl. Askevius.' & '300 annor. MSS. longe
pulcherrimus.'"

At the sale of the Wodhull library in January, 1886, the Livy MS. and the greater part of the
15th-century books hereinafter described were acquired by the donor of the collection, William
Loring Andrews, M.A., of New York City.

The fourth printed Bible, and the first in which place, printers' names and date are given.
These details, which are wanting in so many of the books of the early printers, Fust and Schoeffer--and
Schoeffer when he carried on the business alone--rarely failed to add to anything large enough
to be called a book that came from their press. This is their fifth book and the colophon attached
to the first, the famous Psalter of 1457, was repeated in them all, with no essential change
beyond the date, and continued to do duty for ten years longer. In the present Bible among
the typographical differences found in the copies are three varieties of the colophon, two
of which however are identical in language and differ only in the printers' use of contractions
and capitals. The more common of the forms affirms that: "This present work by the ingenious
invention of printing or stamping letters without any scratching of the pen has been thus fashioned
in the city of Mainz and to the worship of God has been diligently brought to completion by
Johann Fust citizen and Peter Schoeffer clerk of the same diocese in the year of the Lord 1462,
on the eve of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary." The fragment in our possession is entered
(No. 115) as one leaf only, instead of two.

The second dated Bible, the eleventh in the series of printed Bibles, was that of Sweynheym
and Pannartz, Rome, 1471; the third was a reprint by Schoeffer in 1472 of the present edition,
page for page, line for line and in the same type.

     Folio. 1. Novellae: quires [1^{10}, 2^8, 3-6^{10}, 7-8^6, 9^{10},
     10^8, 11-12^{10}, 13^8, 14^{10}, 15^8, 16^6, 17-18^{10}, 19^{10-1}

     leaves, two columns of text and two of commentary, 51 lines of text
     and 66 of commentary to the column, gothic letter, without printed
     signatures, catchwords or pagination. Two- to six-line spaces, some
     with guide-letters, left for capitals. Two pinholes, the use of
     which Schoeffer was thought to have abandoned a little earlier than
     the date of this volume. Titles and colophon printed in red. The
     text type is that of the Bible of 1462. Hain *9623. Brit. Mus. 15th
     cent., I, p. 33 (IC. 217).

The first page of each of the three works is ornamented with a floral scroll border in colors.
At the head of the several books are thirteen initials in gold and colors. Chapter initials
in alternate red and blue; initial-strokes in red in both text and commentary.

The present volume agrees in contents with the fifth and last volume of the Corpus juris as
it is found arranged in the medieval MSS., except for the omission of the Institutiones, already
sufficiently accessible in separate editions, of which no less than fifty were printed in the
15th century, the first of them by Schoeffer himself in 1468. The first three volumes of the
Corpus were occupied by the Digests, the fourth by the Codex lib. i-ix. The last three books
of the Codex relate mainly to public law and having lost much of their importance were transferred
to the fifth volume.

That the order of the three parts in the present copy, viz. 1. Novellae, 2. Consuetudines,
3. Codex lib. x-xii, is that intended by the printer, is clear both from the position and from
the language of the colophon--the position because the colophon is attached to the Codex, and
the language because it describes the volume as consisting of "the ten Collations and the three
books of the Codes." The Novellae were usually divided by the commentators into nine Collations,
perhaps, as Savigny suggests, to parallel the first nine books of the Codex. Sometimes, however,
as in the present case, the Consuetudines feudorum were joined with them and reckoned as a
tenth collation. Notwithstanding these plain indications, in the copy described by Hain *9623,
and in the British Museum copy (as at present, though not as originally, bound), the Codex
x-xii is placed between the Novellae and the Consuetudines, thus removing the colophon from
its natural place at the end of the volume. In the first edition of these works, printed by
Vitus Puecher, Rome, 1476, they were placed in the order last named, but the colophon was there
attached to the Consuetudines.

After the death of his father-in-law and partner Fust, late in 1466 or early in 1467, Schoeffer
conducted the press alone until his death in 1502. After 1478, however, his activity as a printer
was much diminished.

The present large and fine copy (leaf 15-3/4 × 11-1/4 in.), with the manuscript signatures
still in part preserved, is from the library of Sir John Hayford Thorold (1773-1831) of Syston
Park, Lincolnshire, sold in December, 1884. In the Meerman sale at the Hague, 1824, this same
copy, bound as at present in russia gilt, sold for 64 florins.

     Folio. Quires [1-13^{10}, 14^{12}], 142 leaves, the first blank, 2
     columns, 51 lines to the column, without signatures, catchwords,
     pagination, printer's name, place or date. Gothic lower-case type,
     roman capitals. Book and chapter headings printed wholly in
     majuscules. Large woodcut diagrams. Three-to nine-line spaces left
     for chapter and book initials, also spaces for occasional Greek
     words (mostly left unsupplied) and for small diagrams. Two
     pinholes, which in Mentelin's use point to a date not later than
     1473. Hain *9270. Brit. Mus. 15th cent., I, p. 57 (IC. 586). Burger
     pl. 170.

On the first page large illuminated initial with floral border ornament, and similar initials
at the head of the several books. Chapter initials supplied in red or blue; initial-strokes
in red throughout the volume. Blank first leaf wanting.

Incorporated with the present edition of the Etymologiae by way of supplement, though not named
in the table of contents, is an earlier treatise of Isidore's entitled De natura rerum, written
at the request of Sisebut, king of the Visigoths, 612-621, and dedicated to him. It contains
the sum of the physical philosophy of his time, and, being largely astronomical, is sometimes
found in the MSS. under the title Liber de astronomia. In order to bring it into immediate
connection with the corresponding section of the Etymologiae, it is placed immediately after
the third book (devoted to the quadrivium, the last division of which is astronomy) and given
irregularly the heading "Liber quartus," the regular Liber quartus (De medicina) beginning
twenty pages later. Two of the 48 chapters of which it is composed are wanting here, but by
the subdivision of other chapters the number is raised to 58. Zainer of Augsburg, the printer
of the first edition of the Etymologiae, dated 19 November, 1472, followed it the next month
with an edition of De responsione mundi et astrorum ordinatione ad Sesibutum regem, which is
the work in question under another title. Printed with the same type and the same number of
lines to the page, it was in effect treated as a supplement to the Etymologiae.

According to the testimony of a fellow printer, de Lignamine, in the "Chronica summorum Pontificum,"
Rome, 1474, Mentelin as early as 1458 was printing at Strassburg 300 sheets a day. The third
Latin Bible (1460-1461) and the first German Bible came from his press, but the first work
to which he affixed his name and a date was the Speculum historiale of Vincent of Beauvais
in 1473. He died in 1478.

of chapters and morals supplied in alternate red and blue. Paragraph-marks and initial-strokes
in red; headings underlined in red. Blank first leaf wanting.

This edition of the Gesta contains 181 chapters and appears to have been preceded only by another
undated edition printed at Utrecht by Ketelaer and Leempt, in long lines, with 152 chapters
and no index.

Ulrich Zell was the first printer of Cologne. His first dated book was issued in 1466 and he
continued to print quite up to the close of the fifteenth century. Nearly all his books are,
like the present, without place, date or printer's name. Of the 177 books which he is known
to have printed, the British Museum possesses 123.

The Wodhull copy, bound in russia, gilt edges. Leaf 10-3/4 × 7-1/2 in. Mem. on fly-leaf: "Pateson's

     cent., II, p. 319 (IB. 5457).

Gregory's Homilies, of which this is the first edition, and the three next following works
bound with it, are from the press of Günther Zainer, of Reutlingen, the first printer of Augsburg.
All are in the same type, the heavy-faced gothic of his second font, are rubricated by the
same hand, and though two of them are undated, were all evidently printed at about the same
time. He was the first printer in Germany to make use of roman type, of which the earliest
example seems to have been his "Calendarium pro anno 1472." He died in 1478, ten years after
the appearance of his first dated book.

     Folio. Brit. Mus. 15th cent., II, p. 320 (IB. 5560).

Jerome's final translations of the Old Testament books direct from the Hebrew were all adopted
into the received Latin version, the Vulgate, except this of the Psalms. Here his earlier revision
of the old Italic version on the basis of the Septuagint had become so firmly established in
liturgical use that the translation from the Hebrew, though more exact, could not displace
it. This appears to be the first printed edition.

     Folio. 8 leaves, the last blank, 33 lines to the page, gothic
     letter, without place or printer's name. Three-line space for first
     initial and initial-strokes supplied in red. Blank last leaf
     wanting. Hain *2021. Pellechet 1525. Brit. Mus. 15th cent., p. 319
     (IB. 5451).

The author of the work here directly ascribed to St. Augustine was the mystic theologian Hugo
de Sancto Victore (1097-1140), member of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine and head of the
abbey school of St. Victor, near Paris. From his familiarity with the writings of Augustine
and likeness to his spirit, he was styled Alter Augustinus, a title which furnishes a plausible
but not wholly satisfactory explanation of the confusion in the present case. For among the
spurious writings which have been put under Augustine's name more than one has been borrowed
from this author. For example, chapters 5-10 of the Liber de diligendo Deo are taken almost
word for word from the present treatise.

In the present edition of this soliloquy cast in the form of a dialogue the interlocutors are
Augustinus and Anima (both names always printed in capitals); in a Strassburg edition of about
the same date, Hugo and anima sua; in the collected edition of Hugo's works, homo and anima.

Wendelin of Speier succeeded in 1470 to the press established in 1469 by his brother John,
the first printer of Venice, who lived to complete only four books. Gothic type was introduced
into Italy by Wendelin.

Roberto Caraccioli, born at Lecce in 1425, was bishop of his native city from 1484 to 1495.
The great reputation which these sermons enjoyed is attested by the fact that four editions,
three of them printed in Venice, appeared in 1472, and four more in 1473, one of which was
Wendelin's second edition, an exact reprint of the present.

     leaves, the last two blank, roman letter, 39 lines to the page,
     without signatures, catchwords or pagination. Two- to six-line
     spaces left for capitals and spaces also for Greek words, to be
     supplied in manuscript. Two pinholes on side. The type is Jenson's
     first font. Hain 15802. Proctor 4071.

At the head of the first page is a large initial of the interlaced vine pattern in gold and
colors, with a border of the same pattern enclosing the entire page. The remaining five books,
the prefatory epistle and the supplement De ego, mei et sui are introduced by initials of the
same size and style. Alternate red and blue capitals at the head of chapters, paragraph-marks
also in red and blue.

A few of the spaces left for Greek words are filled in manuscript, but more are left vacant.
When Jenson later in the same year printed Cicero's Letters, he was provided with Greek type.
The blank fol. 9^a is occupied by a transcript in an early hand of the greater part of lib.
i, cap. iv (De ficu), from a MS. the readings of which differ materially from the printed text.

For the purposes of the index the six books have been divided into a continuous series of 479
chapters, designated in the margins of the text by manuscript roman numerals, but in the index
by printed numerals. The references are not, as in later editions, to book and chapter, but
to chapters only. The index, alphabetized by the first letter of the word only, printed on
different paper and forming a separate quire, is here placed at the beginning of the volume;
but traces of earlier manuscript signatures still remaining, bear witness to a former order
in which the text preceded the index, as is still the case in some copies of this edition.

Most of Jenson's early books were folios. But notwithstanding the size of the leaf (13 × 8
in.), this is a quarto, as both the direction of the chain-lines and the position of the water-mark
prove. However, because of the limitations of the early presses, it was doubtless printed on
half-sheets, folio-wise, two pages at most at one impression.

Of the twenty-four 15th-century editions of the Elegantiae the three earliest, one of which
was Jenson's, were printed in 1471.

Although the tradition that Nicolas Jenson, master of the mint at Tours, was sent by Charles
VII. in 1458 to Mainz to learn the secrets of the newly discovered art of printing is otherwise
unsupported and, in view of the manner in which the invention was afterwards carried to France
as well as to other countries by private initiative, improbable, he was already a master of
the art, wherever and however acquired, when he established in 1470 the press which held the
leading place at Venice until his death in 1480.

The present exceptionally fine copy of the Elegantiae, bound in citron morocco, with gold borders
and gilt edges, is the Wodhull copy, bought in 1786 of Payne for £10.10s.

     Folio. Two- to twelve-line spaces
     left for capitals, with guide-letters; also spaces for occasional
     Greek words. Greek type sparingly used, oftener transliteration in
     roman. Two pinholes. Hain *13089. Proctor 4087. Morgan Cat. II, p.
     39, n. 297.

The rubrication of the present copy is not only elaborate but also of unusual merit. The first
of the twelve-line initials of the thirty-seven books is finely illuminated in gold and colors.
The others, in the outlines of which grotesque features are occasionally introduced, are set
off by skilful pen-work, harmonizing in general effect, but carefully avoiding repetition in
details. The chapter initials also, a thousand or more in number, in alternate red and blue,
or red and green, have much variety and grace. The initial L, for example, occurring twenty-eight
times in the first book, is never repeated in the same form and color. The blank fol. 3^b is
occupied by the name Jesus in very large and ornate characters, in different colors, surrounded
by scroll and figure decoration. The Bagneri arms, included in the ornamentation of the first
initial, point to an early ownership of the volume, and the arms of the Antella family of Florence
at the foot of the first page, to a later ownership.

The introductory epistle of the younger Pliny, describing his uncle's manner of life, was addressed
to his friend Macer, who here becomes Marcus by the easy transposition of Macro to Marco. Less
easily explained is the substitution in the dedication of Domitian for his brother Titus Vespasian,
to whom Pliny dedicated the work.

Two editions of the Naturalis Historia preceded this, the first printed by John of Speier in
1469, with a five years' privilege from the Venetian senate, which expired at his death in
1470, the second by Sweynheym and Pannartz, Rome, 1470. With the first of these, Jenson's edition
agrees in the number of pages and of lines to the page. Fifteen more editions were printed
before the close of the 15th century. Jenson's Pliny is generally regarded as the finest production
of his press. The type is his first font.

     Proctor 4098.

On the first page of text a large initial S in gold on a panel of color, with marginal decoration.
Other large chapter initials in red and blue alternately. Numerous paragraph-marks in alternate
red and blue. Blank first leaf wanting.

The index, which occupies the first nineteen leaves, is alphabetized as far as the second letter
of the word. The references are by roman numerals to the leaves (not pages) of the work, which
themselves have only manuscript foliation in arabic figures.

The first edition of Nonius was printed at Rome in 1470 by Lauer; the second, in 1471, was
without place or name. Jenson's edition, which is the third, borrowed from both of these but
added also something of value. The correct title, De compendiosa doctrina, first appears here.
The usual title, De proprietate sermonum, belongs strictly to the first chapter. As in all
the early editions, the third chapter is lacking, having been discovered later and first included
in the 1513 edition of Aldus. Jenson's Greek type long remained in favor for incidental use
in Latin books after it had been displaced in Greek books by Aldine types.

On first page of text a twenty-four line initial illuminated in gold and colors, with border
ornament. Book and chapter initials in alternate red and blue. Arabic numerals, which made
their first appearance in printed books in 1470, were very sparingly used even at a considerably
later date than 1473.

The author, commonly known as Johannes de Gandavo (Ghent), of the early part of the 14th century,
wrote commentaries also on other works of Aristotle. Of the present work five editions, of
which this is the first, were printed at Venice in the 15th century.

Franz Renner of Heilbronn conducted a press at Venice from 1471 to 1483, having as partner
from 1473 to 1477 Nicolas of Frankfort. The present volume is printed in a small round-faced
gothic type, the second of the nine fonts which he used.

The border surrounding the first page of text, and eighteen initials of the several books,
are illuminated in gold and colors. Chapter initials supplied in red and blue alternately.

Printed signatures, which appear to have been first introduced by Zarotto of Milan in 1470,
and a register of sheets, first used by John of Cologne in 1475, are both found in this volume.
The register, which may give only the number of sheets in each of the quires, or the first
word of each sheet of the quire, is here of the latter kind. Unfortunately two sheets escaped
registration and the words are supplied in manuscript.

Three separate treatises of Aristotle are contained in this volume: Historia de animalibus
libri ix; De partibus animalium libri iv; De generatione animalium libri v.

Theodore Gaza, the translator, was a learned Greek from Thessalonica, who took up his residence
in Italy on the capture of his native city by the Turks. The translation was made at the instance
of Nicolas V., who had invited him to Rome in 1450, but was first printed in the present edition
(Venice, 1476) and dedicated in a flattering epistle of eleven pages to the reigning pope,
Sixtus IV. The fifty scudi which the pope sent in acknowledgment of the dedication copy Gaza
is said to have thrown in disgust into the Tiber. It is interesting to note in this connection
that while the Venice editions of 1492 and 1498 retain the name of Sixtus IV. in the dedication,
Aldus after having omitted the epistle altogether in his 1504 edition, in that of 1513 quietly
substituted the name of Nicolas V., the earlier and worthier patron, without a word of change
in the language of the dedication itself. Later editions have followed the example of Aldus.

John of Cologne, established as a printer at Venice as early as 1471, was associated 1472-1473
with Wendelin of Speier, whose business and types he took over in 1474. He had as partner,
1474-1480, John Manthen, and in 1480, Nicolas Jenson. The type of the Aristotle is a close
imitation of the first font of John and Wendelin of Speier.

Notwithstanding the Latin title, the work itself is wholly in Italian and both in the MSS.
and in later printed editions is found also under the title Deifira ossia del mal principiato
amore. A companion volume by the same author, with the Latin title De amore liber, and the
Italian, Ecatomfilea ossia del vero amore, was printed the same year, in the same type, the
same number of leaves and lines to the page. Still another work in the same type and form and
apparently of the same date, entitled Historieta amorosa fra Leonora de' Bardi e Hippolito
Bondelmonti, is attributed on good evidence to De Albertis. Copies of all three works, printed
alike on vellum and bound together in one volume, formerly in the Mac-Carthy Collection (Catalogue,
Paris, 1815, no. 3595), are now in the Bibliothèque Nationale (Vélins 1964). In the present
copy of De amoris remedio the manuscript signatures b and c, partly cut away, point to an earlier
binding, in which the Historieta consisting of only twelve leaves may possibly have formed
the signature a.

Panzer was disposed to identify the peculiar roman type of these volumes with that used by
the fourth printer of Venice, Clemente of Padua, between whom and Zarotto of Milan, Hain was
later in doubt. But Proctor was convinced that the small group of books to which these belong,
nearly all of them connected in some way with Florence, were the productions of the first,
so far unidentified, press of that city. The date they bear (1471) places them among the earliest
books printed in the Italian language. Witness the following first editions: Petrarch's Canzoniere,
1470; Il Decamerone, 1471; La Divina Commedia, 1472.

The present copy, bound in blue morocco, with the crest of the Marquis of Blandford on side,
was sold in his (White Knights) sale in 1819 for £2. Leaf 9-1/4 × 6-3/4 in.

This is the first printed edition of any of the Greek classics, and the third book printed
entirely in Greek, or in Greek with a Latin translation; the first being the Grammar of Lascaris,
Milan, 1476, and the second the Lexicon of Crastonus not later than 1478. All three were printed
with the same font of Greek type made by, or under the supervision of, Demetrius Damilas, the
son of Milanese parents settled in Crete. Bonus Accursius was rather the publisher than the
actual printer, who in the case of the Lascaris was Dionysius Paravisinus, and in the case
of the Crastonus and the Aesop, probably the brothers de Honate, who at that date were the
possessors of the peculiar roman type used in the Latin translations. After the Aesop this
particular font of Greek type next appeared in the first edition of Homer, printed at Florence
in 1488 by Bartolommeo di Libri, and in three of his subsequent books, once at Rome early in
the 16th century, after which it disappears altogether.

In the present edition the Fabulae græce number 147, the Fabulae latine 100, the Fabulae selectae
62. The translator, Rinuccio d'Arezzo, who dedicates his work to Cardinal Antonio Cerdano,
tells him in closing that he sends all that have come into his hands, though probably not all
that Aesop wrote, since while they stand in alphabetical order, some letters are wanting and
others have not their full quota. Not all copies have all the three parts, nor are they always
bound in the same order. The present copy, though in all respects complete, is bound irregularly,
as follows: 1. Fabulae selectae. 2. Fabulae græce. 3. Vita Aesopi græce. 4. Vita et fabulae
latine. On the verso of the last blank leaf is written in an early hand "olim fuit Reverendissimi
magistri georgii de casali."

     Quarto. Claudin XIX. Pellechet 147. Hain 216.

Large initial on first page supplied in blue and gold, with pen ornamentation in red and blue.

This and the two next works of the present list bound with it were printed at the first Paris
press, a private press set up in the Sorbonne in 1470 by Johann Heynlin, Prior, and Guillaume
Fichet, Librarian, of the University, and maintained by them until April, 1473. During these
three years twenty-two books were printed, all in the same roman type, copied from the Cæsar
of Sweynheym and Pannartz, Rome, 1469. In only two of them are the actual printers, Friburger
and his associates, named.

To the twenty-eight 15th-century editions--not to speak of the translations--of this novel
described by Hain, Copinger's Supplement adds half as many more. The present edition is perhaps
the third. Claudin, who makes it the nineteenth in the list of the Sorbonne books, could trace
but four copies. This makes a fifth.

The three books from the Sorbonne press are bound in one volume, red morocco, gilt edges, with
book-plate of Sir William Burrell. It passed from his possession some years before his death
and was bought by Michael Wodhull at Payne's sale April 7, 1789, for £4.4s. The binder, possibly
mistaking the date of the author's subscription (Vienna, 1444) for that of the printing, has
placed it on the back of the volume. Leaf 7-3/4 × 5-1/4 in.

20. PIUS II. (AENEAS SILVIUS PICCOLOMINI). De curialium miseria. Alberti quoque austriæ ducies
inclyti consiliarium atque oratorem præfacio fœliciter incipit; Fol. 34^a: Vale uir (nisi ex

     Quarto. Pellechet 132. Hain 198.

First initial rubricated in the same style and by the same hand as in the De duobus amantibus.
Other capitals and paragraph-marks in red and blue alternately. Initial-strokes in yellow.
At the bottom of fol. 29^a a line accidentally dropped by the compositor is supplied in manuscript
by a contemporary hand, viz., "non te uolunt. Quidam uero potentes sunt! ac ex." Both the recto
and the verso of the leaf have the full complement of 23 lines but there is a hiatus in the
text. The copies in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the Bibliothèque Mazarine, Paris, have
the line supplied in manuscript in like manner, but instead of uero read non, which does not
suit the context.

According to Claudin this is the twentieth book printed at the Sorbonne press. To the five
copies known to him this adds a sixth.

Bound with No. 19. De duobus amantibus.

21. PLATO. Epistolae. 52^a, COLOPHON: FINIS.

    Discite rectores diuinitus, ore platonis!
    Quid uos, quid ciues reddat in urbe bonos;

     Quarto. The first initial supplied in blue and red, other
     capitals in blue and red alternately. Initial strokes in yellow.
     Claudia XIV. Philippe VII. Crevenna 1523. Hain 13066.

Leonardo Bruni, often called Leonardo Aretini from his birthplace Arezzo, translated five of
the dialogues of Plato in addition to the letters.

The first notice of this edition is found in the Catalogue Bolongaro-Crevenna (Amst., 1789),
where it is described as containing 52 printed leaves. It appears from the price-list printed
after the sale in 1790 that it had not been sold, but was "retenu, faute de commissions ou
de concurrence," and was still obtainable at the price of 15 florins. No trace of it has since
been found and Panzer and Hain were able only to copy the catalogue description. Philippe (1885)
described Heynlin's copy, which is preserved in the library of the University of Basel, as
consisting of one first blank leaf, forty-nine printed leaves and two blank leaves at the end.
Claudin (1898), with a second copy discovered meantime in the Bibliothèque d'Angers at his
command, finds one first blank and forty-nine printed leaves, and remarks that the two blank
leaves placed by Philippe at the beginning [should be end] are only independent fly-leaves.
Our copy has fifty-two printed leaves and no blanks and no occasion for them, since the printed
leaves, of themselves, form complete quires. Claudin's collation, which gives both the quires
and a register of the first words of each quire, shows that both his copies lack the sixth
quire of our copy, composed like the seventh of only two leaves and beginning "sibus interdixistis."
There is moreover still unexplained and not easily explainable in the descriptions of both
the Basel and Angers copies the presence of a troublesome first blank leaf and the absence
of another leaf of text, in addition to the lacking sixth quire. It follows that, at least
until the Crevenna copy, which appears to have been in agreement with ours, comes to light
again, this must remain the only complete copy known.

Bound with Nos. 19 and 20, from the same press.

     six-line spaces with guide-letters left for initials. Hain 10478.

Border ornamentation in color on fol. 5^a. Initials at the head of the first four of the ten
books in dull gold and color; those of the remaining books in color only. The bottom line of
fol. 116^b which had been accidentally moved across to the foot of fol. 115^a (the companion
page on the imposing stone) is supplied in manuscript where it was lacking and the misplaced
line of print is canceled.

On the discontinuance of the Sorbonne press in 1473, the printers, Crantz, Gering, and Friburger,
moved into the neighboring Rue Saint-Jacques and set up a press, with new type, on their own
account. An edition of the Sophologium had been one of the last books printed at the old press.
A second edition was issued from the new press in 1475, of which the present edition is, in
type, number of pages and lines, an exact reprint, but has printed signatures and is a quarto
while that was a folio. Caxton's "Book of Good Manners," printed in 1487, was a translation
of "Le livre des bonnes meurs," another work by the same author.

The present copy, bound in green morocco with gold borders and gilt edges, is from the Syston
Park library, sold in December, 1884. Leaf 10-3/4 × 7-1/4 in.

Peter van Os, of Breda, was actively engaged in printing at Zwolle from 1479 till the end of
the century, except for the three years 1481-1484.

The English translation of the "Vitas Patrum," which was the closing labor of Caxton's life,
was printed in 1495 by Wynken de Worde with this colophon: "Thus endyth the moost vertuouse
hystorye of the deuoute and right renowned lyues of holy faders lyuynge in deserte, worthy
of remembraunce to all wel dysposed persons which hath ben translated oute of Frenche into
Englisshe by William Caxton of Westmynstre late deed and fynysshed at the laste daye of hys lyff."

     Folio. Sign. a-b^8, C^4, 1-28^8, [28*^2], 29-48^8, 49^4, 50^8,
     52-55^8, 450 leaves, of which five (a, 1; 1, 1; 1, 5; 28*,2; 55, 8)
     are blank. The folios of sign. 1,2-55,7 are numbered 1-ccccxxviii
     (blanks 1, 5 and 28*,2 counted as iv and ccxxvi), with many errors
     which are mostly corrected on the following leaves, but in the case
     of fol. ccxli on the verso of the same leaf. There is, however, no
     clx, and ccccxiii is duplicated, errors which balance each other
     and do not disturb the final numeration. The omission of a
     signature 51 is accidental, the text continuing without a break.
     The purpose of the unsigned single sheet following sign. 28,
     consisting of one printed and one blank leaf, was evidently to
     carry the last remaining leaf of the fourth book and thereby make
     possible a division of the volume at this point into two nearly
     equal parts. Advantage has apparently been taken of this division
     to bind the Grenville copy (Brit. Mus. IB. 55060) in two volumes.
     Wynkyn de Worde, who reprinted the Polychronicon in 1495, followed
     in this particular Caxton's example and in order to begin the fifth
     book with a new signature left at the end of the fourth book nearly
     a whole leaf blank, though he separated the other books by a blank
     space of no more than three or four lines. Caxton's use of arabic
     figures for signatures was confined to the years 1481-1483; after
     that date he used letters only. The first few chapter-headings of
     each book have Latin ordinals (Capitulum primum, secundum, etc.)
     which are soon dropped for arabic figures. Gothic letter, Caxton's
     fourth font, forty lines to the page, with headline. Two- to
     seven-line spaces left for chapter and book initials, which are
     supplied in red. Chapter-headings underlined in red. Blades ii,
     172. Ames-Dibdin i, 138. Seymour de Ricci p. 60.

Seventy-two leaves, including the five blanks, are wanting in this copy, viz.: sign. a-C; 1,
1, 4, 5, 8; 2, 1, 4, 5; 3, 2; 4, 1; 27, 3; [28*,2]; 44, 7; 50-55. The lacking parts comprise
the first twenty leaves (Prohemye and alphabetical index), the last forty leaves (Caxton's
eighth book), and twelve intermediate leaves. Of these the Proheyme is supplied in facsimile
and sign. 4, 1 in manuscript. What is possibly an original impression of Caxton's large device
is placed at the end of the volume. This was used by Caxton only during his last years, 1487-91,
and by Wynkyn de Worde, into whose hands the original block passed, in his folios for thirty
years longer. From one of the latter this may have been taken, possibly from the Polychronicon
of 1495, where the other side of the leaf it occupied was blank, as is the case here also.

Trevisa's translation of Higden was completed, according to the best MSS., in 1387, not in
1357 as stated on fol. 389^b. (In 1357 the 18th of April fell on Tuesday, not Thursday, and
Thomas Lord Berkeley was then in the fifth, not the thirty-fifth year of his age.) Caxton was
himself the translator of twenty-two of the one hundred books which he printed and it was therefore
not strange that Trevisa's English should have been in his hands, as the proem states, "a lytel
embelysshed fro tholde makyng." In what these embellishments consisted is partially explained
in the epilogue: "Therfore I William Caxton a symple persone haue endeuoyred me to wryte fyrst
ouer all the sayd book of proloconycon, and somewhat haue chaunged the rude and old Englyssh,
that is to wete certayn wordes, which in these dayes [1482] be neyther usyd ne understanden".
He went however further than this and so changed the inflections and orthography that the language
is no longer of the fourteenth but rather of the fifteenth century. But in no other way could
it have been made to harmonize with his proposed continuation, concerning which he proceeds
to say: "and also am auysed to make another booke after this sayd werke whiche shal be sett
here after the same, And shal haue his chapytres and his table a parte. For I dar not presume
to sette my book ne ioyne hit to his, for dyuerse causes". Accordingly he begins his "Liber
ultimus" with a new signature, preceded by a blank page. His "table" nevertheless is combined
with that of the preceding seven books in one alphabet. Wynkyn de Worde's edition has a more
elaborate index of ninety pages in which each of the eight books is indexed in a separate alphabet.

Apart from the interest attaching to this "Liber ultimus" as the only original work of any
length from Caxton's pen, the Polychronicon is next to the Golden Legend his largest book,
and in the Prohemye they are grouped together as the "twoo bookes notable" which treat of history.
It happens also, probably because of larger editions printed, that of these two books many
more copies have survived than of any of his other books, about one-fourth of which are now
represented only by single copies. Of the Polychronicon, Seymour de Ricci's "Census of Caxtons"
(1909) enumerates forty known copies (very few of them entirely complete), evenly divided between
public and private libraries. To this list he adds, under the heading "Present owners untraced,"
forty-eight copies (nos. 41-88) which appeared at sales between 1698 and 1901, some of them
possibly identical with copies already described as "known." In this second division is found
the present copy (no. 79), purchased by the donor of this collection at the Smets sale, New
York, May, 1868, in calf binding, with the name of the owner "A.A. Smets, Savannah, May 28,
1836" on the fly-leaf. It was at once sent to Francis Bedford for binding, with instructions
to have the "inlaying, repairing etc. done over in the very best manner, by the best restorer
in France or England." Bound in brown morocco, richly blind-tooled, with Tudor rose, fleur-de-lis
and acorn emblems. Leaf 10-1/4 × 7-1/2 in. The Smets fly-leaf and the original instructions
sent to Mr. Bedford with the volume and returned by him with an added note over his own signature,
laid in.

Other copies of the Polychronicon which have passed through Mr. Bedford's hands have been bound
in the same style, among them the Menzies copy, sold New York, November, 1876, which de Ricci
wrongly conjectured might be identical with the Smets.

     Quarto. Sign. Aa^4, A^6, B^4, C-X, AA-NN^{8, 4 (altern.)}, OO^6,
     PP^{5}+{1}. 218 leaves, gothic letter, 34 lines (marginal citations
     60 lines) to the page, without foliation. Title cut in large
     lower-case letters on block 2 × 4 in. Five- and six-line initials
     at the head of the larger divisions of the text. Ten woodcuts, one
     repeated. The final blank PP. 6 has been replaced by an independent
     leaf having on the one side the title repeated with woodcut, and on
     the other the printer's device, either of which may in the binding
     be made the recto. The device is the first of his so-called
     "Sagittarius" forms, and the one most commonly used from 1506 to
     1518. Ames-Dibdin, ii, p. 103. Morgan Cat. iii, p. 214, n. 743.

The present copy lacks the first four leaves, containing the title and the table of contents;
but both the title and the woodcut accompanying it are repeated elsewhere in the volume, the
title on fol. 218^a, the woodcut on fol. 87^a.

Of the French original, L'ordinaire des chrestiens, at least six editions were printed before
1500, the earliest apparently at Rouen, c. 1487. In them it is stated that the writing was
commenced 22 May, 1467 and finished (consommé) 22 May, 1469. The corresponding dates in the
prologue and epilogue of the translation are "fyrst begonne to be wryten" 14 Jan., 1467, "fyrst
consumed" 14 Jan., 1500. The confusion, common to both the French and the English of the 15th
century, in the derivatives of consummare and consumere relieves the translator, Andrew Chertsey,
from the appearance of an over-literal translation, but the change in the date of the completed
work can hardly be in the direction of accuracy.

The woodcuts which appeared in the first edition of the "Ordinary" printed in 1502 are in this
second edition replaced by others of different design and better execution, borrowed mainly
from "The crafte to lyve well and to dye well", printed by de Worde in 1505 and like the present
work translated by Chertsey from a French original, L'art de bien vivre et de bien mourir.
Two of these illustrations, "Temptation to Impatience" (fol. 73^b) and "Soul leaving the Body"
(fol. 218^a), are copied from the early block-book Ars moriendi.

Bound by Alfred Matthews in blind-tooled crimson morocco, with inside gold borders and gilt
edges. Leaf 8-1/4 × 5-3/4 in.

Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's assistant, was a native of Wörth, Alsace. He came into possession
of his master's printing materials on his death in 1491 and continued to occupy his house in
Westminster until 1500 when he moved to Fleet Street within the city. In the number of his
books, almost eight hundred, he surpassed all the early printers, but many of them were works
of small size and consequence. Some of his largest and finest books were reprints of Caxton's
folios. Mention has been made of his use of Caxton's original device without addition. In all
of his own various devices also, the place of honor in the center is given to Caxton's initials
and cipher, plainly as a mark of loyalty to the master, not an advertisement of himself as
the successor.

26. INTRATIONES. London, Richard Pynson, 28 Feb. 1510.

     Folio. Sign. Aa^6, Bb^4, a-z, &, 9, A-E^6, F^4. 194 leaves, the
     last blank, 11-193 numbered i-clxxxv, but with the omission of li
     and liv and other irregularities. Gothic letter, 54 lines to the
     page, with marginal side-headings. The title, occupying seventeen
     lines of bold heavy-faced type, is printed in red and black and in
     the form of an inverted triangle. The Index Alphabeticus is
     introduced by a ten-line initial A with a rose above and a
     portcullis below the middle bar, found also in the same printer's
     Sarum missal of 1520. The other divisions of the index have mostly
     four-line woodcut initials, some of grotesque pattern. Five-line
     space with guide-letter for the first initial of the text.
     Ornaments of four patterns, repeated singly or in combination, are
     used to lengthen out the frequent short end lines of paragraphs in
     order to give more solidity to the appearance of the page. Three of
     the same ornaments are found also on the title-page of Whitinton's
     Vulgaria, printed by W. de Worde in 1521. Ames-Dibdin ii, 441.

In the present copy the index (sign. Aa. 2-6, Bb. 1-4) is separated from the title (Aa. 1)
and placed at the end of the volume. Name of Johēs Coningesby written in a sixteenth century
hand on the first page of both text and index. The device is the fourth of Pynson's seven devices
and was in use 1496-1513. Allusion is made in the colophon to an earlier edition, no copy of
which appears to be known. The work was reprinted by Henry Smythe, London, 1546.

Richard Pynson, a Norman by birth, established himself in London about 1490, taking over, as
there is good reason to believe, the business of Machlinia, a printer of law books, for which
his knowledge of Norman-French especially fitted him. In 1508 he was made Printer to the King
and in that year also he printed two books in roman type, the first use of that character in
England. He is known to have printed at least 371 books, a much smaller number than de Worde,
but as a rule larger and more important books. He is regarded as the best English printer of
his time and the Liber Intrationum is one of his finest books.

Bound in red velvet, with silk linings and gilt edges. Leaf 12-3/4 × 9-1/4 in.

From the Syston Park library, with the book-plate and monogram of Sir John Henry Thorold.

Soceri. mense Martio. M. D. IX. [Blank leaf with anchor on verso.]

     Quarto. Sign. *, a-z, &, aa-zz, aaa-sss^8, ttt^6. 8 unnumbered
     preliminary leaves (sign * not included in register on p. 1050)
     containing title, dedicatory epistle of Aldus to Jacopo Antiquario,
     index, four couplets of Jerome Aleander, preface of the editor
     Demetrius Doukas (all except title and dedication in Greek); 1050
     numbered pages of Greek text, final blank leaf with anchor on
     verso. The type is Aldus's fourth Greek font, 46 lines to the page,
     five- to eight-line spaces left for initials. The semipagina (the
     equivalent of our page) to which the index directs the reader,
     shows that pagina still had its older meaning leaf, and
     incidentally that the numbering of the page instead of the leaf was
     an innovation. The anchor and dolphin device, the symbol of the
     motto Festina lente, which first appeared in the Dante of 1502,
     is here in its first form, but of the larger size suitable for
     folios and enclosed in double lines, on the title-page without
     name, but on the last leaf with the addition ALDVS.MA.RO. Although
     on the evidence of the chain-lines and the water-mark technically a
     quarto, the volume on account of its unusual size was doubtless
     printed like a folio on half sheets. Renouard, p. 55. Firmin-Didot,
     p. 317.

Plutarch's Moralia belongs to that imposing series of first editions of the Greek classics
which among all the services of Aldus Manutius to the revival of learning are perhaps his best
title to enduring fame. When he set up his press in 1495 five in all, and but one, Homer, of
the first rank, had been printed. When he died twenty years later his first editions outnumbered
those of all his contemporaries put together, and the rank was even more significant than the
number, for among them were included Aristotle, Plato, Thucydides, Herodotus, Aristophanes,
Sophocles, Euripides, Pindar and Demosthenes. The Plutarch was printed from MSS. still preserved
in the library of St. Mark.

The Greek type of Aldus was a new departure, based on the cursive or business handwriting of
his day in distinction from the older book-hand which had served as the model for the first
Greek fonts. It gained immediate popularity and for more than two hundred years, either directly
or through fonts based upon it, dominated the Greek printing of Europe. At length, mainly because
of the ligatures and contractions, it was supplanted by type of more open and regular forms.

In 1508 Aldus took as partner his father-in-law, Andrea Torresano d'Asola, a Venetian printer
who in 1480 had taken over the business of Nicolas Jenson. The imprint which had hitherto been
apud Aldum or in aedibus Aldi now became in aedibus Aldi et Andreae soceri. After the death
of Aldus in 1515 the press was conducted without change of name by the surviving partner until
his own death in 1529.

Thick paper copy. Leaf 10-3/4 × 7 in. On p. 1050 is written Collegii Societatis Jesu Embricae 1605.

From the library of Sir J.H. Thorold of Syston Park, with book-plate. Bound by R. Storr, Grantham,
in red morocco, gilt edges, with anchor on sides. The "Dictionary of English Book-collectors,"
pt. 2, calls attention to the Aldine anchor (made more realistic by an end of rope cable twisted
about it) stamped by the Grantham bookbinders Messrs. Storr & Ridge upon many of the Thorold
books, "not only those bound by themselves, but also those bound by far better men." Examples
of both kinds are found in the present collection.

As an illustration of the first Greek type of Aldus there is joined to this collection a finely
executed manuscript facsimile on vellum of his Musaeus of 1495, his second book (preceded by
the Grammar of Lascaris), but the first in which the font appeared in its completed state.

The italic type of Aldus, a cursive or semi-cursive roman, the counterpart of his cursive Greek,
was modeled as he himself informs us on the handwriting of Petrarch a lettra per lettra. It
first appeared in the Vergil of 1501, the first of his octavo series of classics and only three
months later, as was but just, in Le cose volgari of Petrarch. It had at the outset, corresponding
to the Greek ligatures, many double letters and even groups of three cast on the same body,
which were for the most part eliminated later by Paulus Manutius. Originally it consisted only
of lower-case letters and borrowed the capitals of the roman font, using for economy of space
small capitals which DeVinne points out as the useful invention of Aldus. Aldus was sensible
of the deficiency and the last clause of his will was a request to his partner, Andrea, to
have suitable capitals made by the celebrated engraver, Giulio Campagnola. It was, however,
not until 1558 that they were finally supplied by Paulus, in connection with a new italic font.
What has now ceased to be anything more than a useful auxiliary type was by Aldus employed
as a text type, a chief recommendation being that it was more condensed than the roman and
enabled him to greatly reduce the price of his books by making an octavo do the work of a quarto
or folio. In 1501 he printed six, and in 1502 eleven octavos, whereas all his earlier books,
with one unimportant exception, had been of the larger forms.

In 1496 the Venetian Senate granted to Aldus protection for his Greek type and the books printed
with it for the period of twenty years, and in 1502 a like privilege covering both his italic
and Greek type for ten years. A similar grant made by Alexander VI. in 1502 was renewed by
Julius II. in January, 1513, for fifteen years and confirmed by his successor, Leo X., in December
of the same year.

Reprinted, with only the addition of the index, from the 1514 edition of Aldus. In the preface
is found the often quoted inscription placed over the door of Aldus to discourage the idle
visitor: Quisquis es: rogat te Aldus etiam: atque etiam: ut, si quid est, quod a se velis:
perpaucis agas, etc. The edition of 1533, with the imprint in ædibus haeredum Aldi Manutii
Romani & Andreae Asulani Soceri and a short preface by Paulus Manutius (it was his first book
as director of the press) is also essentially unchanged, but his edition of 1546, in octavo,
was thoroughly revised in text and accompanied by a folio volume of variorum commentaries.

     Octavo. 2 preliminary leaves containing title and dedication by
     Paulus Manutius to Guillaume Pellicier, Bishop of Montpellier, 331
     numbered leaves of text, 10 unnumbered leaves of translations of
     the Greek passages, conjectural emendations which the editor "would
     not hesitate to adopt it he should ever find an ancient MS. to
     confirm them" and a final leaf with colophon and anchor. The
     Scholia, 24 unnumbered leaves, have a separate title, with notice
     of copyright granted by Paul III. (the fourth pope to grant this
     privilege) and the Venetian senate; colophon and anchor repeated on
     last leaf. Renouard, p. 120.

Except for the interval 1533-6 the press was inactive from 1529 to 1540, on account of dissensions
between the heirs of Andrea and Aldus. The partnership having been dissolved the press was
reopened in 1540 by the sons of Aldus (apud Aldi filios) under the direction of the youngest,
Paulus Manutius (1512-74), who restored and added to its lustre. The brief scholia he expanded
later into full and valuable commentaries, on the Letters to Atticus in 1547, on the Letters
to Brutus and Quintus in 1557.

It was Petrarch who in 1345 discovered in a Verona MS. the long lost Letters to Atticus, Brutus
and Quintus and copied them with his own hand. Both the MS. and Petrarch's copy are lost. But
of the MS. another transcript, procured by Petrarch's friend Salutati in 1389, is preserved
in the Laurentian Library, and of the Petrarch copy we have here a replica in the type which
Aldus characterized as manum mentiens.

     Octavo. 4 unnumbered preliminary leaves, containing title and
     preface of Paulus Manutius addressed to Cardinal Benedetto Accolto,
     303 numbered leaves of text and a final leaf with register and
     colophon on the recto and anchor on the verso.

The second edition of the Orations printed by Paulus, vol. I only (II, III wanting), on large
paper. Renouard (who knew of no complete copy of the three volumes l.p.) remarks, p. 141, on
the too elongated form of most of the Aldine large paper octavos, in which all the increased
space is at the bottom. In the present copy it is divided between the bottom and the outer
margin, the inner margin and the top having no increase of width--an arrangement well adapted
for marginal annotations and perhaps designed for that use. An early owner of this copy has
in fact added to the printed title (Orationum Pars I) with a pen the word Commentata, but proceeded
no further with his plan than simply to underscore a number of words on the first three pages,
leaving the margins untouched.

The most important of the commentaries of Paulus was that on the Orations, completed not long
before his death and printed by his son Aldus in 1578-9 in three folio volumes.

From the Syston Park library, with book-plate and the monogram of Sir J.H. Thorold. Bound in
red morocco, gilt edges, with Aldine anchor in gold on sides. Leaf 8 × 5-1/4 in.

33. PTOLEMAEUS, CLAUDIUS. Planisphærium. JORDANUS NEMORANUS. Planisphærium.

PLANISPHAERIVM COMMENTARIVS. In quo uniuersa Scenographices ratio quam breuissime traditur,

     Quarto (not octavo, as described by Renouard). Part 1. 4
     unnumbered preliminary leaves containing title and dedicatory
     preface of Commandino to Cardinal Rainuccio Farnese, 37 numbered
     leaves of text (1-25 Ptolemy, 26-37 Jordanus), final blank leaf
     with anchor on verso. Part 2. 28 numbered leaves of commentary,
     with separate title, anchor both on title and on verso of last
     leaf. Text in roman, 25 lines to the page; commentary in italic, 34
     lines to the page. Many woodcut diagrams. Both text and commentary
     are introduced by a seven-line woodcut initial belonging to a
     mythological series found in other books of Paulus of this period,
     C picturing Calypso bidding adieu to Ulysses, I, Juno seated on a
     car drawn by peacocks. The original italic font of Aldus, the
     so-called Aldino type, which appears to have passed into the
     possession of the Torresani relatives at about this date, is here
     replaced by a new font having a perceptibly larger face, though
     only a slightly larger body (20 lines of the new equalling 21 of
     the old) and consequently showing less white between the lines.
     Renouard, p. 173.

In 1554 the subscription assumed the new form apud Paulum Manutium Aldi F., showing that Paulus
had acquired his brothers' rights in the press. At the same time he returned to the earlier
and simpler form of the anchor with the name Aldus, instead of the Aldi filii and the ornamental
border in use since 1546. Sometimes, as in the present volume, the subscription is omitted
altogether and the anchor with the name Aldus alone used. Here moreover the place and date
appear only on the title-page and the colophon is dropped as no longer useful.

The original Greek text of Ptolemy's Planisphere is lost. To the present Latin translation,
made by an unknown hand from the Arabic, is appended (fol. 25) this subscription: Facta est
translatio haec Tolosae Cal. Iunii Anno Domini MCXLIIII. The revival of the study of the Greek
mathematicians in the sixteenth century was largely due to the admirable translations and commentaries
of Federigo Commandino of Urbino (1509-75). This edition of Ptolemy's Planisphere still remains
the best. In the same year Paulus printed Archimedis Opera nonnulla a Federico Commandino Vrbinate
nuper in latinum conversa et commentariis illustrata.

Uncut copy, bound in blue morocco, with vellum fly-leaves. Leaf 8-3/4 × 6-1/2 in.

     Folio. Part 1. 48 unnumbered preliminary leaves containing title,
     preface of Sigonius, Veterum scriptorum de T. Liuio testimonia ab
     Aldo Manutio Paulli F. Aldi N. collecta, Libri primi epitome, Rerum
     et vocum apud T. Liuium index copiosissimus; 399 numbered leaves
     of text (blank last leaf wanting). Part 2. Caroli Sigonii
     Scholia, with separate title and device, 109 numbered leaves and
     blank end leaf. Part 3. Caroli Sigonii Livianorum Scholiorum
     aliquot Defensiones adversus Glareanum et Robortellum, with
     separate title and device, 52 numbered pages. Roman character,
     except epitomae i-xlv and index which are in the italic type of
     the Ptolemy commentary, and the preface which is a large and
     unusual italic, first found in a notice prefixed to the Medici
     antiqui of 1547, once as a text type in 1550, afterwards only in
     an occasional preface or title-page. Like the smaller italic of
     Paulus it is provided with capitals. The large woodcut initials of
     the several books belong to the mythological series found in the
     Ptolemy but are here much worn. Renouard, p. 215.

Editions of Livy with the Scholia of Sigonius were issued from the Aldine press in 1555, 1566,
1572 and 1592. This third edition is distinguished from those which preceded it by some additions
to the Scholia and an appendix in which the editor defends his views on the chronology of Livy
against the attacks of two opponents. But typographically it is inferior to the second edition
as the second was inferior to the first, which alone was printed under the active supervision
of Paulus. In 1561 he went to Rome to undertake the direction of a press which Pius IV. was
about to establish and died there in 1574, having made only one brief visit to Venice in the
intervening thirteen years. In his absence the Venice press, when not inactive or leased, was
mainly in the charge of his son, the younger Aldus (1547-97), who in spite of the promise of
his early years failed both as a scholar and as a printer to sustain the reputation of his
father and grandfather. To the present edition Aldus contributed the Veterum scriptorum de
T. Liuio testimonia, and he is also unquestionably responsible for the large and strange device
which replaces the simple anchor for which his father had shown so marked a preference. It
consists of the arms granted to Paulus in 1571 by the Emperor Maximilian II. (in which the
Aldine anchor occupies a subordinate place) surrounded by a border of heavy ornament with the
addition: Ex privilegio Maximiliani II. Imp. Caes. Aug. When his father's death had made him
the head of the press he continued for some years to employ the same device. For the Livy of
1592, much inferior to the present edition, and of interest only as showing the decline into
which the Aldine press, and the Italian presses in general, had fallen at the end of the sixteenth
century, he was only indirectly responsible. He left Venice in 1585 and spent the last years
of his life at Rome, as professor of belles-lettres and joint director of the Vatican press.

     Octavo. Sign. A^8, B^4, a-z, aa-zz, A-Y^8, Z^6, aaa-eee^8. 602
     leaves, comprising 12 preliminary unnumbered leaves containing
     title, Ad divinarum literarum verarumque divitiarum amatores
     exhortatio, Librorum ordo, Biblie summarium. Gabriel Bruno's
     Tabula alphabetica historiarum; fol. i-cccccxx, text; 30
     unnumbered leaves Index rerum et sententiarum; 40 unnumbered
     leaves Interpretationes nominum Hebraicorum, etc. Very small
     gothic letter, double columns, 58 lines to the column. Six- to
     eight-line woodcut initials of the several books, the unicorns of
     Kerver's device appearing in that of Gen. i. Le Long-Masch iii, 2,
     149.

The octavo Latin Bibles of the Kerver press, fifteen editions of which appeared between 1508
and 1560, were closely patterned after Froben's edition, Basel, 1591 (the first Bible printed
in octavo form), both as regards the text, based on the "Fontibus ex Græcis" editions, 1478
ff., and the introductory and supplementary matter of various origin accompanying it. The earliest
of these supplements, Interpretationes nominum Hebraicorum, an etymological index of Hebrew
proper names, appeared first in the Bible of Sweynheym and Pannartz, Rome, 1471, and was reprinted
without change in most of the editions previous to 1515. In the Complutensian Polyglot it underwent
revision and the revised form appears in all the editions of Yolande Bonhomme, with due acknowledgment
to Cardinal Ximenes. The Index rerum et sententiarum, however, announced in the title as a
new addition to this edition (as it had been also announced in the edition of 1546, not mentioned
by Masch and Copinger, of which this is an exact duplicate) was borrowed from the Bible of
Robert Stephens, Paris, 1534, without acknowledgment, perhaps in order the better to escape
the suspicion of heresy attached to his work. In Copinger's chronological table of the printed
editions of the Latin Bible during the 15th and 16th centuries (Incunabula Biblica, p. 207)
this is no. 339, total number 562.

The Kerver press was less celebrated for its Bibles than for liturgical works, and for the
books of private devotion (Horae, Heures) of which Brunet (Manuel, v, col. 1614-27) enumerates
no less than fifty-six, printed by Thielmann, his widow, or his sons, between 1497 and 1571.
The wood-engravings with which they were illustrated were repeated in the successive editions
and occasionally also in the Bibles. Two of these borrowed cuts are found in the present edition,
facing the Old and the New Testament. The first represents the Expulsion from the Garden, but
the verse printed underneath (Gen. ii. 7) calls for the Creation of Adam, which in Yolande's
editions of 1526 and 1534 is actually present, while here another engraving has been substituted,
but the verse left standing. Facing the New Testament, under the heading Jesu Christi secundum
carnem genealogia, is a genealogical tree springing from "the root of Jesse."

Following the usual alphabetical order of the signatures (A-Z, aaa-eee), the Index rerum et
sententiarum (sign. U-Z) is here placed before the Interpretationes (sign. aaa-eee). This is
contrary to the direction of the Collectio codicum found on the last leaf of the Index (Z6),
where the order prescribed is A-T, aaa-eee, U-Z, which is further supported by the colophon
and printer's device on Z6. The Index as the latest supplement was meant to stand at the end
of the volume.

Bound in oak boards covered with stamped leather, brass corners and bosses, gilt gauffred edges.
Around the central boss of the back cover is stamped the date A.D. 1571, and on the front cover,
in corresponding position and order, the initials F E P L P F.

From the Osterley Park sale, May, 1885, with the book-plate of Victor Albert George Child Villiers,
Earl of Jersey. Leaf 6-1/2 × 4-1/2 in.

36. PHILO JUDÆUS. De divinis decem oraculis. Lutetiæ, apud Carolum Stephanum, 1554.

M.D.LIIII.

     Octavo. 72 numbered pages, followed by one leaf Ad lectorem and
     one blank. Pp. 3-6, dedication by the translator to Charles de
     Guise, Cardinal de Lorraine, Archbishop of Reims, to whom was also
     dedicated the first edition of the works of Philo in Greek, printed
     by Turnebus, Paris 1552. Printed on vellum. On p. 7 a beautiful
     seven-line engraved initial R. The device is that chosen by the
     printer's brother Robert, the olive tree and the motto Noli altum
     sapere, without the addition sed time.

Renouard, Annales de l'impr. des Estienne, 2^e éd., p. 106; adds to his description of the
volume the following note: "Dédié au cardinal de Lorraine, pour lequel il en fut tiré sur vélin
un exemplaire que depuis l'on a vu relié en maroq. jaune ancien, avec une tête en or sur la
couverture. Il a passé dans une Bibliothèque inconnue." The present copy answers completely
to this description and is without doubt the dedication copy in question. The binding (17th
cent.) is yellow morocco, browned by age, gilt edges, with a medallion head in gold embossed
on the back cover. Within are written names of former owners; on the title page N. Tetel, 1644
datum Remis and Claude Henry Corrard; on the cover linings ex Libris Claudii Tetel ad Mussey(?);
Ce livre appartient à m^{lle} Jean Collot.

By an oversight Renouard omitted this volume from his list (p. 271) of "Editions Stéphaniennes
dont on connoit un on plusieurs exemplaires imprimés sur vélin." It increases the number to
twenty-three, seventeen of them printed by the first Henri and only six by his descendants.

Charles Estienne (1504?-1564), a member of a second remarkable family of scholar-printers of
the sixteenth century, whose history forms so interesting a parallel to that of Aldus and his
descendants, though he does not rank with his brother Robert, or Robert's son the second Henry,
certainly brought no discredit on the family name. He was educated as a physician, but when
Robert withdrew to Geneva to escape the persecutions of the Sorbonne, he took charge of the
Paris press and conducted it with ability from 1551 to 1561, printing one hundred volumes and
receiving the appointment of king's printer. Aside from this attractive volume no vellum copy
of his books is known.

From the Wodhull sale, with the Wodhull arms stamped in gold on the front cover. Mem. within:
"Payne's sale. £3 3s. M. Wodhull, Apr. 14^{th} 1792. Collat & complet." On the last blank leaf
is entered the date "Oct. 17^{th} 1808," a record possibly of a later "visitation." Similar
dates, some years later than the date of purchase are found on the end leaves of other Wodhull
books. Leaf 7 × 4-1/2 in.

The following inconsistencies found in the text have been retained:

head-line / headline Homiliæ / Homiliae (in referring to the same book) De Vinne / DeVinne
