Holiday eloquence Home, be it ever so homely Honest error is to be pitied, not ridiculed Honestest
man loves himself best Horace How troublesome an old correspondent must be to a young one How
much you have to do; and how little time to do it in Human nature is always the same Hurt those
they love by a mistaken indulgence I hope, I wish, I doubt, and fear alternately I shall never
know, though all the coffeehouses here do. I shall always love you as you shall deserve. What
is impossible, and what is only difficult Whatever pleases you most in others Whatever is worth
doing at all, is worth doing well Whatever one must do, one should do 'de bonne grace' Whatever
real merit you have, other people will discover When well dressed for the day think no more
of it afterward Where one would gain people, remember that nothing is little Who takes warning
by the fate of others?
