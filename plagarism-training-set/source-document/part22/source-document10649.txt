Classic Authors and the Jews (Vol. ix., p. 221.).--In Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Biography a few references are given, under the words "Herodes," "Hyrcanus," &c., to classical
authors who refer to the Jewish people, their country and customs. Probably many more will
be given in the Dictionary of Geography, under the words "Palestine," "Jerusalem," &c., when
the work is completed. To suppose that the classical authors allude but seldom to the Jews
is a mistake. Roman writers of the post-Augustan period abound in allusions to them. I can
supply {385} B. H. C. with a few. The Histories of Tacitus refer to them in almost every page,
and book v. especially contains an account of their origin, institutions, chief city, and temple.
Juvenal also has frequent allusions to their customs and habits, e. g. Sat. iii. 14., xiv.
101. &c.; see also Horace's Satires, I. iv. 143., I. v. 100., and I. ix. 70., with Macleane's
notes on the two latter passages; Pliny, V. xiv. 15., XIII. iv. 9., XXXI. viii. 44.; Quint.,
III. vii. 21.; Just., xxxvi. 2. I am not aware of any work which gives all the passages in
classical authors referring to the Jews.

FRANCIS J. LEACHMAN, B.A.

In answer to your correspondent B. H. C., I beg to say that I have found out the following
passages in classic authors bearing on Judea and the Jews, all of which I have authenticated
myself, except where I had not the book at hand:

  Tacitus. Annales, ii. 85.; xii. 23. 54.; xv. 44.
  Ditto. Historiæ, i. 10.; ii. 1. 4, 5. 78. 79. 81.; v. passim.
  Horace. Satires, i. 4. 143.; i. 5. 100.; i. 9. 70.
  Juvenal. Satires, ii. 14.; vi. 158-160, 537-547.; xiv. 96-106.
  Persius. Satires, v. 180-189.
  Martial, iv. 4.
  Suetonius. Tiberius, 36.; Augustus, 76.; Claudius, 25.; Vespasian, 5.
      &c.; Julius Cæsar, 84.
  Pliny, v. 14, 15, 16. &c.; vii. 15.; xxviii. 7.
  Dio Cassius, lx. §6.; xxxvii. §17.
  Lucan, ii.

Mawkin (Vol. ix., p. 303.).--An attempt to explain the origin of the word maukin, or malkin,
may be seen in the Philological Museum, vol. i. p. 681. (See also Halliwell's Dict., in Malkin
and Maulkin.) The most probable derivation of the word is, that malkin is a diminutive of mal,
abbreviated from Mary, now commonly written Moll. Hence, by successive changes, malkin or maukin
might mean a dirty wench, a figure of old rags dressed up as a scarecrow, and a mop of rags
used for cleaning ovens. The Scotch maukin, for a hare, seems to be an instance of an animal
acquiring a proper name, like renard in French, and jack for pike in English.

Mantelpiece (Vol. ix., p. 302.).--French, Manteau de cheminée. German, Kamin Mantel. This is
the moulding, or mantle, that serves to hide (screen) the joint betwixt the wall and the fire-stove.

Mousehunt (Vol. ix., pp. 65, 135.).--A short time ago I was informed by a gamekeeper, that
this little animal is found in the Holt Forest. He told me that there are three kinds of the
weasel tribe in the woods: the weasel, the stoat or stump, and the mousehunt or mousehunter,
which is also called the thumb, from its diminutive size. It feeds on mice and small birds;
but my informant does not think that it attacks game. 15.

As I can completely join in with the praise your correspondent MR. TENNYSON awards to Mr. Fennell's
Natural History of Quadrupeds (except as regards some of its woodcuts, which I understand were
inserted by the publisher in spite of the author's remonstrance), I feel induced to protect
Mr. Fennell from the hypercritical commentary of your correspondent J. S.s. (p. 136.). Thus
Spenser, speaking of the river Nile, says:

 "... Beside the fruitful shore of muddy Nile,
  Upon a sunny bank outstretched lay,
  In monstrous length, a mighty crocodile."
