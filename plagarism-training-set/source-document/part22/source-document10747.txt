CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION TO COURAGE

I

"'Tisn't life that matters! 'Tis the courage you bring to it" ... this from old Frosted Moses
in the warm corner by the door. There might have been an answer, but Dicky Tasset, the Town
Idiot, filled in the pause with the tale that he was telling Mother Figgis. "And I ran--a mile
or more with the stars dotted all over the ground for yer pickin', as yer might say...."

A little boy, Peter Westcott, heard what old Frosted Moses had said, and turned it over in
his mind. He was twelve years old, was short and thick-necked, and just now looked very small
because he was perched on so high a chair. It was one of the four ancient chairs that Sam Figgis
always kept in the great kitchen behind the taproom. He kept them there partly because they
were so very old and partly because they fell in so pleasantly with the ancient colour and
strength of the black smoky rafters. The four ancient chairs were carved up the legs with faces
and arms and strange crawling animals and their backs were twisted into the oddest shapes and
were uncomfortable to lean against, but Peter Westcott sat up very straight with his little
legs dangling in front of him and his grey eyes all over the room at once. He could not see
all of the room because there were depths that the darkness seized and filled, and the great
fiery place, with its black-stained settle, was full of mysterious shadows. A huge fire was
burning and leaping in the fastnesses of that stone cavity, and it was by the light of this
alone that the room was illumined--and this had the effect as Peter noticed, of making certain
people, like Mother Figgis and Jane Clewer, quite monstrous, and fantastic with their skirts
and hair and their shadows on the wall. Before Frosted Moses had said that sentence about Courage,
Peter had been taking the room in. Because he had been there very often before he knew every
flagstone in the floor and every rafter in the roof and all the sporting pictures on the walls,
and the long shining row of mugs and coloured plates by the fire-place and the cured hams hanging
from the ceiling ... but to-night was Christmas Eve and a very especial occasion, and he was
sure to be beaten when he got home, and so must make the very most of his time. He watched
the door also for Stephen Brant, who was late, but might arrive at any moment. Had it not been
for Stephen Brant Peter knew that he would not have been allowed there at all. The Order of
the Kitchen was jealously guarded and Sam Figgis, the Inn-keeper, would have considered so
small a child a nuisance, but Stephen was the most popular man in the county, and he had promised
that Peter would be quiet--and he was quiet, even at that age; no one could be so quiet as
Peter when he chose. And then they liked the boy after a time. He was never in the way, and
he was wonderfully wise for his years: he was a strong kid, too, and had muscles....

So Peter crept there when he could, although it very often meant a beating afterwards, but
the Kitchen was worth a good many beatings, and he would have gone through Hell--and did indeed
go through his own special Hell on many occasions--to be in Stephen's company. They were all
nice to him even when Stephen wasn't there, but there were other reasons, besides the people,
that drew Peter to the place.

It was partly perhaps because The Bending Mule was built right out into the sea, being surrounded
on three sides by water. This was all twenty years ago, and I believe that now the Inn has
been turned into an Arts Club, and there are tea-parties and weekly fashion papers where there
had once been those bloody fights and Mother Figgis sitting like some witch over the fire;
but it is no matter. Treliss is changed, of course, and so is the world, and there are politeness
and sentiment where once there were oaths and ferocity, and there is much soap instead of grimy
hands and unwashen faces ... and the fishing is sadly on the decline, but there are good drapers'
shops in the town.

For Peter the charm of the place was that "he was out at sea." One could hear quite distinctly
the lap of the waves against the walls and on stormy nights the water screamed and fought and
raged outside and rolled in thundering echoes along the shore. To-night everything was still,
and the snow was falling heavily, solemnly over the town.

The snow, and the black sea, and the lights that rose tier on tier like crowds at a circus,
could be seen through the uncurtained windows.

The snow and quiet of the world "out-along" made the lights and warmth of the room the more
comforting and exciting, and Sam Figgis had hung holly about the walls and dangled a huge bunch
of mistletoe from the middle beam and poor Jane Clewer was always walking under it accidentally
and waiting a little, but nobody kissed her. These things Peter noticed; he also noticed that
Dicky the Idiot was allowed to be present as a very great favour because it was Christmas Eve
and snowing so hard, that the room was more crowded than he had ever seen it, and that Mother
Figgis, with her round face and her gnarled and knotted hands, was at her very merriest and
in the best of tempers. All these things Peter had noticed before Frosted Moses (so called
because of his long white beard and wonderful age) made his remark about Courage, but as soon
as that remark was made Peter's thoughts were on to it as the hounds are on to a fox.

"'Tisn't life that matters, but the Courage yer bring to it...."
