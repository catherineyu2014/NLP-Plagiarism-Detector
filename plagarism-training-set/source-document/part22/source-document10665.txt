Oaken Tombs (Vol. vii., p. 528.; Vol. viii., p. 179.).--In the chancel of Brancepeth Church,
co. Durham, are oaken effigies of a Lord and Lady Neville, of which the following is a description.
The figure of the man is in a coat of mail, the hands elevated with gauntlets, wearing his
casque, which rests on a bull's or buffalo's head, a collar round his neck studded with gems,
and on the breast a shield with the arms of Neville. The female figure has a high crowned bonnet,
and the mantle is drawn close over the feet, which rest on two dogs couchant. The tomb is ornamented
with small figures of ecclesiastics at prayer, but is without inscription. Leland (Itin., i.
80.) says:

    "In the paroche church of Saint Brandon, at Branspeth, be dyvers tumbes
    of the Nevilles. In the quire is a high tumbe, of one of them porturid
    with his wife. This Neville lakkid heires male, wherapoan great
    concertation rose betwixt the next heire male, and one the Gascoynes."

Stafford Knot (Vol. viii., p. 220.).--It was the badge or cognisance of the house of Stafford,
Earls of Stafford.

Hand in Bishop's Cannings Church (Vol. viii., p. 269.).--See an article on this "Manus Meditationis,"
with a copy of the inscription, in the Ecclesiologist, vol. v. p. 150.

Arms of Richard, King of the Romans (Vol. viii, p.265.).--I think it might be proved that the
border refers not to Poitou (which is represented {455} by the crowned lion), but to Cornwall,
the ancient feudal arms of which are Sable, fifteen bezants, referring, as it would seem, to
its metallic treasures. See an article on the numerous arms derived from those of this Richard,
in the appendix to Mr. Lower's Curiosities of Heraldry.

Burial in an erect Position (Vol. viii., pp. 59. 233.).--So Ben Jonson was buried at Westminster,
probably on account of the large fee demanded for a full-sized grave. It was long supposed
by many that the story was invented to account for the smallness of the gravestone; but the
grave being opened a few years ago, the dramatist's remains were discovered in the attitude
indicated by tradition.

HENRY GOUGH.

Emberton, Bucks.

In the Ingoldsby Legends, vol. i. p. 106., we have:

 "No!--Tray's humble tomb would look but shabby
 'Mid the sculptured shrines of that gorgeous Abbey.
      Besides, in the place
      They say there's not space
  To bury what wet-nurses call 'a Babby.'
  Even 'rare Ben Jonson,' that famous wight,
  I am told, is interr'd there bolt upright,
  In just such a posture, beneath his bust,
  As Tray used to sit in to beg for a crust."

Is there any authority for the statement?

ERICA.

Wooden Effigies (Vol. viii., p. 255.).--These are by no means uncommon, though it is to be
feared that many have perished within comparatively recent times. In the church of Clifton
Reynes, Bucks, there are wooden effigies of two knights of the Reynes family with their wives.

Wedding Divination (Vol. vii., p. 545.).--The following mediæval superstition may be quoted
as a pretty exact parallel of the wedding divination alluded to by OXONIENSIS. It is from Wright's
selection of Latin stories of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Harl. MS. 463.:--

    "Vidi in quibusdam partibus, quando mulieres nubebant, et de ecclesiâ
    redibant, in ingressu domus in faciem corum frumentum projiciebant,
    clamantes: 'Abundantia! Abundantia!' quod Gallicè dicitur plentè,
    plentè; et tamen plerumque, antequam annus transiret, pauperes
    mendici remanebant et abundantià omni bonorum carebant."

Old Fogie (Vol. viii., p. 154.).--If it will throw any additional light on the controversy
as to "fogie," I may add that for a long period of years I have heard it applied only to the
discharged invalided pensioners of the army. On a late Queen's birthday review on the Green,
the boys and girls were in ecstasies at seeing the "old fogies" dressed out in new suits. It
is very often spoken derisively to a thick-headed stupid person, but which cannot determine
accurately its primary signification.

Miscellaneous. The sixth volume, which is now before us, embraces the eventful six years 1774-1780,
which saw the commencement of the great struggle with America, which ended in the independence
of the United States. In this, as in his preceding volumes, the new materials which Lord Mahon
has been so fortunate as to collect from the family papers of the representatives of the political
leaders of the period, and which he has inserted in his appendix, contribute very materially
to the value and importance of his history.

Cheshire; its Historical and Literary Associations, illustrated in a series of Biographical
Sketches; and The Cheshire and Lancashire Historical Collector, a small 8vo. sheet originally
issued every month, but now every fortnight, in consequence of increase of materials, and the
great encouragement which the undertaking has received, are two contributions towards Cheshire
topography, local history, bibliography, &c., for which the good men of the Palatinate are
indebted to the zeal of Mr. T. Worthington Barlow, of the Society of Gray's Inn.

It is always a subject of gratification to us when we see cheap yet handsome reprints of our
standard authors; for no better proof can be given of the increase among us not only of a reading
public, but of a public who are disposed to read well. It is therefore with no small pleasure
that we have received from Mr. Routledge copies of his five shilling edition of The Canterbury
Tales, by Geoffrey Chaucer, from the Text, and with the Notes and Glossary of Thomas Tyrwhitt,
condensed and arranged under the Text. It is obvious that considerable labour has been taken
by the editor in its preparation, for he has not contented himself with merely transferring
the contents of Tyrwhitt's Notes and Glossary to their proper places beneath the text; but
has availed himself of the labours of Messrs. Craik, Saunders, Sir H. Nicolas, and our able
correspondent A. E. B., to give completeness to what is a very useful edition of old Dan Chaucer's
masterpiece. We have to thank the same publisher for a corresponding edition of Spenser's Faerie
Queene; so that no lover of those two glorious old poets need any longer want a cheap and compact
edition of them.

BOOKS RECEIVED.--History of the Guillotine, revised from the Quarterly Review, by the Right
Hon. J. W. Croker, which forms the new part of Murray's Railway {456} Reading, is not only
valuable as a précis of all that is known upon this very obscure subject, but for all its illustration
of the difficulty of arriving at historical truth.--A Love Story; being the History of the
Courtship and Marriage of Dr. Dove of Doncaster, that delightful episode in Southey's most
delightful book, The Doctor, forms Part L. of Longman's Traveller's Library.--The First Italian
Book appears a very successful attempt on the part of Signor Pifferi and Mr. Dawson W. Turner
to furnish a companion to the First French Book of that accomplished scholar, the late Rev.
T. K. Arnold.

Notices to Correspondents.

Owing to the length of PROFESSOR DE MORGAN'S very interesting article and the number of our
Advertisements, we have enlarged our present Number to Thirty-two pages.

BOOKS WANTED. So many of our Correspondents seem disposed to avail themselves of our plan of
placing the booksellers in direct communication with them, that we find ourselves compelled
to limit each list of books to two insertions. We would also express a hope that those gentlemen
who may at once succeed in obtaining any desired volumes will be good enough to notify the
same to us, in order that such books may not unnecessarily appear in such list even a second time.

The letters for A. Z., MR. DEMAYNE, MR. F. CROSSLEY, &c., have been duly forwarded.

X. Y. Z. We have no doubt the early numbers of The Press may be procured on application to
the publisher of that paper.

F. M. The passage in King John,

                     "My face so thin
  That in my ear I dare not stick a rose,
  Lest men should say, See where threefarthings goes!"

contains an allusion to the very thin silver threefarthing pieces, coined by Elizabeth, which
bore a rose. In Boswell's Shakspeare (ed. 1821), vol. XV. p. 209., will be found nearly two
pages of illustrative notes.

A CONSTANT READER is informed that the line

 "Men are but children of a larger growth"

is from Dryden's All for Love.

J. L. (Islington). DR. DIAMOND informs us that he procured his naphtha from Messrs. Simpson
and Maule, of Kennington, but he would not advise the use of varnish so made. It is apt to
dry up in round spots, and which sometimes print from the negative. He also adds, that one
ounce of the collodio-amber varnish as recommended by him will, with care, from its great fluidity
and ready-flowing qualities, effectually varnish upwards of thirty glass negatives of the quarter
plate size: thus the real expense is very inconsiderable.

F. S. A. Photography is perfectly applicable to the copying of MSS. or printed leaves, either
smaller, of the same size, or larger than the original, the only requisite beyond a good lens
being a camera of sufficient length for a long focus. A plain surface exposed in front of a
lens requires a range behind it of the same distance to produce an equal size copy; a magnified
image being produced by a nearer approach to the lens, and a smaller the farther the object
is distant. Prints are often copied by mere contact, without the use of any lens whatever.
As a brother F. S. A., DR. DIAMOND will be happy to give you some personal instructions as
to your requirements.

    the number of editions they have passed through) has called forth many
    imitations; but everybody will like the original, or prototype, rather
    than the copy. The Dictionary is famous as the most copious and correct

    unpretentious."--Vide Reading Mercury, Oct. 22.
