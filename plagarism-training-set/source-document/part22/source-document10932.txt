[2] Marly was a palace belonging to the king, but little inferior in splendor to Versailles
itself, and a favorite residence of Louis XV., because a less strict etiquette had been established
there. Choisy and Bellevue, which will often be mentioned in the course of this narrative,
were two others of the royal palaces on a somewhat smaller scale. They have both been destroyed.
Marly, Choisy, and Bellevue were all between Versailles and Paris.

[4] Her sister Caroline, Queen of Naples.

[5] Her brother Leopold, at present Grand Duke of Tuscany, afterward emperor. His wife, Marie
Louise, was a daughter of Charles III. of Spain.

[6] They, with several of the princes of the blood and some of the peers, as already mentioned,
had been banished for their opposition to the abolition of the Parliaments; but now, in the
hopes of obtaining the king's consent to his marriage with Madame de Montessan, a widow of
enormous wealth, the Due d'Orléans made overtures for forgiveness, accompanying them, however,
with a letter so insolent that it might we be regarded as an aggravation of his original offense.
According to Madame du Deffand (letter to Walpole, December 18th, 1772, vol. ii., p. 283),
he was only prevented from reconciling himself to the king some months before by his son, the
Due de Chartres (afterward the infamous Égalité), whom she describes as "a young man, very
obstinate, and who hopes to play a great part by putting himself at the head of a faction."
The princes, however, in the view of the shrewd old lady, had made the mistake of greatly overrating
their own importance. "These great princes, since their protest, have been just citizens of
the Rue St. Denis. No one at court ever perceived their absence, and no one in the city ever
noticed their presence."

[7] Lord Stormont, the English Embassador at Vienna, from which city he was removed to Paris.
In the preceding September Maria Teresa had complained to him of being "animated against her
cabinet, from indignation at the partition of Poland."

[8] That is, sisters-in-law--the Princesses Clotilde and Elizabeth.

[9] The Hotel-Dieu was the most ancient hospital in Paris. It had already existed several hundred
years when Philip Augustus enlarged it, and gave it the name of Maison de Dieu. Henry IV. and
his successors had further enlarged it, and enriched it with monuments; and even the revolutionists
respected it, though when they had disowned the existence of God they changed its name to that
of L'Hospice de l'Humanité. It had been almost destroyed by fire a fortnight before the date
of this letter, on the night of the 29th of December.

[10] St. Anthony's Day was June 14th, and her name of Antoinette was regarded as placing her
under his especial protection.

[2] The money was a joint gift from herself as well as from him. Great distress, arising from
the extraordinarily high price of bread, was at this time prevailing in Paris.

[3] The term most commonly used by Marie Antoinette in her letters to her mother to describe
Madame du Barri. She was ordered to retire to the Abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux. Subsequently
she was allowed to return to Luciennes, a villa which her royal lover had given her.

[4] Madame de Mazarin was the lady who, by the fulsomeness of her servility to Madame du Barri,
provoked Madame du Deffand (herself a lady not altogether sans reproche) to say that it was
not easy to carry "the heroism of baseness and absurdity farther."

[5] Lorraine had become a French province a few years before, on the death of Stanislaus Leczinsky,
father of the queen of Louis XV.

commence à s'emparer de l'autorité que M. le Dauphin n'exercera jamais que d'une façon convenable,
et ... ce serait du dernier danger et pour l'état et pour le système général que qui ce soit

[12] La ceinture de la reine. It consisted of three pence (deniers) on each hogs-head of wine
imported into the city, and was levied every three years in the capital.--ARNETH, ii, p. 179.

[13] The title "ceinture de la reine" had been given to it because in the old times queens
and all other ladies had carried their purses at their girdles.

arrêter les effets de la colère de la Reine."--Mercy to Maria Teresa, May 16th, 1776, Arneth,
ii., p. 446.

[5] The compiler of "Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI., et La Famille Royale" (date April 24th,
1776) has a story of a conversation between the king and queen which illustrates her feeling
toward the minister. She had just come in from the opera. He asked her "how she had been received
by the Parisians; if she had had the usual cheers." She made no reply; the king understood
her silence. "Apparently, madame, you had not feathers enough." "I should have liked to have
seen you there, sir, with your St. Germain and your Turgot; you would have been rudely hissed."
St. Germain was the minister of war.

[7] January 14th, 1776, Arneth, ii., p. 414.

[8] The ground-floor of the palace was occupied by the shops of jewelers and milliners, some
of whom were great sufferers by the fire.

[9] In a letter written at the end of 1775, Mercy reports to the empress that some of Turgot's
economical reforms had produced real discontent among those "qui trouvent leur intérêt dans
le désordre," which they had vented in scandalous and seditious writings. Many songs of that
character had come out, some of which were attributed to Beaumarchais, "le roi et la reine
n'y ont point été respectés."--December 17th, 1775. Arneth, ii, p. 410.

la Reine, par un maintien qui tient à son âme, a toujours su imprimer à ceux qui l'entouraient
une contenance de respect qui contrebalançait un peu la liberté des propos."--Mercy to Maria
Teresa, Arneth, ii, p.520.

s'en altère, et que sa Majesté maigrit beaucoup."--Marie Thérèse à Louis XVI., la date Février
1, 1777, p 101.

[5] Once when he had spoken to her with a severity which alarmed Mercy, who feared it might
irritate the queen, "Il me dit en riant qu'il en avait agi ainsi pour sonder l'âme de la reine,
et voir si par la force il n'y aurait pas moyen d'obtenir plus que par la douceur."--Mercy
to Maria Teresa, Arneth, iii., p. 79.

CHAPTER XIII.

[1] When Mercy remonstrated with her on her relapse into some of her old habits from which
at first she seemed to have weaned herself, "La seule réponse que j'aie obtenu a été la crainte

[5] The Comte de la Marck, who knew him well, says of him, "Il était gauche dans toutes ses
manières; sa taille était très élevée, ses cheveux très roux, il dansait sans grâce, montait
mal à cheval, et les jeunes gens avec lesquels il vivait se montraient plus adroits que lui
dans les diverses exercices d'alors à la mode." He describes his income as "une fortune de
120,000 livres de rente," a little under £5000 a year.-- Correspondance entre le Comte de Mirabeau

[14] One of his admirers, seeing his mortification, said to him: "You are very simple to have
wished to go to court. Do you know what would have happened to you? I will tell you. The king,
with his usual affability, would have laughed in your face, and talked to you of your converts
at Ferney. The queen would have spoken of your plays. Monsieur would have asked you what your
income was. Madame would have quoted some of your verses. The Countess of Artois would have
said nothing at all; and the count would have conversed with you about 'the Maid of Orleans.'"--Marie
Antoinette, Louis XVI. et la Famille Royale, p. 125, March 3d.

CHAPTER XIV.

[1] "La cour se précipite pêle-mêle avec la foule, car l'étiquette de France veut que tous

[10] Maria Teresa had offered the mediation of the empire to restore peace between England
and France.

[11] Spain had recently entered into the alliance against England in the hope of recovering
Gibraltar. And just at the date of this letter the combined fleet of sixty-six sail of the
line sailed into the Channel, while a French army of 50,000 men was waiting at St. Malo to
invade England so soon as the British Channel fleet should have been defeated; but, though
Sir Charles Hardy had only forty sail under his orders, D'Orvilliers and his Spanish colleague
retreated before him, and at the beginning of September, from fear of the equinoctial gales,
of which the queen here speaks with such alarm, retired to their own harbors, without even
venturing to come to action with a foe of scarcely two-thirds of their own strength. See the
author's "History of the British Navy," ch. xiv.

it had been known as the Parc aux Cerfs, under which title it had acquired a still more infamous
reputation.

[11] Campardon, p. 153, quoting Madame de Campan.

[12] The most recent French historian, M.H. Martin, sees in this trial a proof of the general
demoralization of the whole French nation. "L'impression qui en résulte pour nous est l'impossibilité
que la reine ait été coupable. Mais plus les imputations dirigées contre elle étaient vraisemblables,
plus la créance accordée à ces imputations était caractéristique, et attestait la ruine morale
de la monarchie. C'était l'ombre du Parc aux Cerfs qui couvrait toujours Versailles."--Histoire
de France, xvi., p. 559, ed. 1860.

[14] Feuillet de Conches, i., p. 162. Some of the critics of M.F. de Conches's collection have
questioned without sufficient reason the probability of there having been any correspondence
between the queen and her elder sister. But the genuineness of this letter is strongly corroborated
by a mistake into which no forger would have fallen. The queen speaks as if the cardinal had
alleged that he had given her a rose; while his statement really was that Oliva, personating
the queen, had dropped a rose at his feet. A forger would have made the letter Correspond with
the evidence and the fact. The queen, in her agitation, might easily make a mistake.

les torts de sa vie passée," etc.--Campardon, p. 156.

[17] It was from Ettenheim that the Duke d'Enghien was carried off in March, 1804. The cardinal
died in February, 1803.

[10] The continuer of Sismondi's history, A. Renée, however, attributes the archbishop's appointment
to the influence of the Baron de Breteuil.

[11] "Son grand art consistait à parler à chacun des choses qu'il croyait qu'on ignorait."--De
Levis, p. 100.

[12] The loan he proposed in June was eighty millions (of francs); in October, that which he
demanded was four hundred and forty millions.

[13] It is worth noticing that the French people in general did not regard the power of arbitrary
imprisonment exercised by their kings as a grievance. In their eyes it was one of his most
natural prerogatives. A year or two before the time of which we are speaking, Dr. Moore, the
author of "Zeluco," and father of Sir John Moore, who fell at Corunna, was traveling in France,
and was present at a party of French merchants and others of the same rank, who asked him many
questions about the English Constitution, When he said that the King of England could not impose
a tax by his own authority, "they said, with some degree of satisfaction, 'Cependant c'est
assez beau cela.'"... But when he informed them "that the king himself had not the power to
encroach upon the liberty of the meanest of his subjects, and that if he or the minister did
so, damages were recoverable in a court of law, a loud and prolonged 'Diable!' issued from
every mouth. They forgot their own situation, and turned to their natural bias of sympathy
with the king, who, they all seemed to think, must be the most oppressed and injured of manhood.
One of them at last, addressing himself to the English politician, said, 'Tout ce que je puis
vous dire, monsieur, c'est que votre pauvre roi est bien à plaindre.'"--A View of the Society
and Manners in France, etc., by Dr. John Moore, vol. i., p. 47, ed. 1788.

CHAPTER XXII.

[2] M. Foulon was about this time made paymaster of the army and navy, and was generally credited
with ability as a financier; but he was unpopular, as a man of ardent and cruel temper, and
was brutally murdered by the mob in one of the first riots of the Revolution.

[7] On one occasion when the Marquis de Bouillé pointed out to him the danger of some of his
plans as placing the higher class at the mercy of the mob, "dirigé par les deux passions les
plus actives du coeur humain, l'intérêt et l'amour propre, ... il me répondit froidement, en
levant les yeux au ciel, qu'il fallait bien compter sur les vertus morales des hommes."--Mémoires
de M. de Bouillé, p. 70; and Madame de Staël admits of her father that he was "se fiant trop,
il faut l'avouer, à l'empire de la raison," and adds that he "étudia constamment l'esprit public,
comme la boussole à laquelle les décisions du roi devaient se conformer."-- Considérations
sur la Révolution Française, i., pp. 171, 172.

[8] Her exact words are "si ... il fasse reculer l'autorité du roi" (if he causes the king's
authority to retreat before the populace or the Parliament).

[12] There is at the present moment so strong a pretension set up in many constituencies to
dictate to the members whom they send to Parliament as if they were delegates, and not representatives,
that it is worth while to refer to the opinion which the greatest of philosophical statesman,
Edmund Burke, expressed on the subject a hundred years ago, in opposition to that at a rival
candidate who admitted and supported the claim of constituents to furnish the member whom they
returned to Parliament with "instructions" of "coercive authority." He tells the citizens of
Bristol plainly that such a claim he ought not to admit, and never will. 1803.

It is singular proof how entirely research into the condition of the country and the people
of France had been neglected both by its philosophers and its statesmen, that there does not
seem to have been any publication in the language which gave information on these subjects.
And this work of Mr. Young's is the one to which modern French writers, such as M. Alexis de
Tocqueville, chiefly refer.

[15] "The lettres de cachet were carried to an excess hardly credible; to the length of being
sold, with blanks, to be filled up with names at the pleasure of the purchaser, who was thus
able, in the gratification of private revenge, to tear a man from the bosom of his family,
and bury him in a dungeon, where he would exist forgotten and die unknown."--A. Young, p. 532.
And in a note he gives an instance of an Englishman, named Gordon, who was imprisoned in the
Bastile for thirty years without even knowing the reason of his arrest.

[16] Arthur Young, writing January 10th, 1790, identifies Les Enragés with the club afterward
so infamous as the Jacobins. "The ardent democrats who have the reputation of being so much
republican in principle that they do not admit any political necessity for having even the
name of the king, are called the Enragés. They have a meeting at the Jacobins', the Revolution
Club which assembles every night in the very room in which the famous League was formed in
the reign of Henry III." (p. 267).

[17] M. Droz asserts that a collector of such publications bought two thousand five hundred
in the last three months of 1788, and that his collection was far from complete.--Histoire
de Louis XVI., ii., p. 180.

[19] In reality the numbers were even more in favor of the Commons: the representatives of
the clergy were three hundred and eight, and those of the nobles two hundred and eighty-five,
making only five hundred and ninety-three of the two superior orders, while the deputies of
the Tiers- État were six hundred and twenty-one.--Souvenirs de la Marquise de Créquy, vii., p. 58.

[21] "La reine adopta ce dernier avis [that the States should meet forty or sixty leagues from
the capital], et elle insista auprès du roi que l'on s'eloignât de l'immense population de
Paris. Elle craignait dès lors que le peuple n'influençât les délibérations des députés."--MADAME
DE CAMPAN, ch 83.

CHAPTER XXIII.

[1] It was called "L'insurrection du Faubourg St. Antoine."

[2] The best account of this riot is to be found in Dr. Moore's "Views of the Causes and Progress
of the French Revolution," i., p. 189.

[3] Madame de Campan specially remarks that the disloyal cry of "Vive le Duc d'Orléans" came
from "les femmes du peuple" (ch. xiii.).

who became dauphin the next month by the death of his elder brother.

[7] "Aucun nom propre, excepté le sien, n'était encore célèbre dans les six cents députés du
Tiers."--Considérations sur la Révolution Française, pp. 186, 187

[8] In the first weeks of the session he told the Count de la Marck, "On ne sortira plus de
là sans un gouvernement plus ou moins semblable à celui d'Angleterre."--Correspondance entre
le comte de la Marck, i., p. 67.

[9] He employed M. Malouet, a very influential member of the Assembly, as his agent to open
his views to Necker, saying to him, "Je m'adresse donc à votre probité. Vous êtes lié avec
MM. Necker et de Montmorin, vous devez savoir ce qu'ils veulent, et s'ils ont un plan; si ce
plan est raisonnable je le défendrai."--Correspondance de Mirabeau et La Marck, i., p. 219.

[10] There is some uncertainty about Mirabeau's motives and connections at this time. M. de
Bacourt, the very diligent and judicious editor of that correspondence with De la Marck which
has been already quoted, denies that Mirabeau ever received money from the Duc d'Orléans, or
that he had any connection with his party or his views. The evidence on the other side seems
much stronger, and some of the statements of the Comte de la Marck contained in that volume
go to exculpate Mirabeau from all complicity in the attack on Versailles on the 9th of October,
which seems established by abundant testimony.

CHAPTER XXIV.

[1] A letter of Madame Roland dated the 26th of this very month, July, 1789, declares that
the people "are undone if the National Assembly does not proceed seriously and regularly to
the trial of the illustrious heads [the king and queen], or if some generous Decius does not
risk his life to take theirs."

[2] This story reached even distant province. On the 24th of July Arthur Young, being at Colmar,
was assured at the table-d'hôte "That the queen had a plot, nearly on the point of execution,
to blow up the National Assembly by a mine, and to march the army instantly to massacre all
Paris." A French officer presumed but to doubt of the truth of it, and was immediately overpowered
with numbers of tongues. A deputy had written it; they had seen the letter. And at Dijon, a
week later, he tells us that "the current report at present, to which all possible credit is
given, is that the queen has been convicted of a plot to poison the king and monsieur, and
give the regency to the Count d'Artois, to set fire to Paris, and blow up the Palais Royal
by a mine."--ARTHUR YOUNG'S Travels, etc., in France, pp. 143, 151.

[3] "Car dès ce moment on menaçait Versailles d'une incursion de gens armés de Paris."--MADAME
DE CAMPAN, ch. xiv.

[5] She meant to say, "Messieurs, je viens remettre entre vos mains l'épouse et la famille
de votre souverain. Ne souffrez pas que l'on désunisse sur la terre ce qui a été uni dans le
ciel."--MADAME DE CAMPAN, ch. xiv.

[6] Napoleon seems to have formed this opinion of his political views: "Selon M. Gourgaud,
Buonaparte, causant à Ste. Hélène le traitait avec plus de mépris [que Madame de Staël]. 'La
Fayette était encore un autre niais. Il était nullement taillé pour le rôle qu'il avait à jouer....
C'était un homme sans talents, ni civils, ni militaires; esprit borné, caractère dissimulé,
dominé par des idées vagues de liberté mal digérées chez lui; mal conçues.'"--Biographie Universelle.

[7] In his Memoirs he boasts of the "gaucherie de ses manières qui ne se plièrent jamais aux
grâces de la Cour," p. 7.

[5] There is some uncertainty where La Fayette slept that night. Lacretelle says it was at
the "Maison du Prince de Foix, fort éloignée du château." Count Dumas, meaning to be as favorable
to him as possible, places him at the Hôtel de Noailles, which is "not one hundred paces from
the iron gates of the chapel" ("Memoirs of the Count Dumas," p. 159). However, the nearer he
was to the palace, the more incomprehensible it is that he should not have reached the palace
the next morning till nearly eight o'clock, two hours after the mob had forced their entrance
into the Cour des Princes.

[11] As early as the second week in October (La Marck, p. 81, seems to place the conversation
even before the outrages of October 5th and 6th; but this seems impossible, and may arise from
his manifest desire to represent Mirabeau as unconnected with those horrors), Mirabeau said
to La Marck, "Tout est perdu, le roi et la reine y périront et vous le verrez, la populace
battra leurs cadavres."

CHAPTER XXVIII.

[1] We learn from Dr. Moore that there was a leader with five subaltern officers and one hundred
and fifty rank and file in each gallery of the chamber; that the wages of the latter were from
two to three francs a day; the subaltern had ten francs, the leaders fifty. The entire expense
was about a thousand francs a day, a sum which strengthens the suspicion that the pay-master
(originally, at least) was the Duc d'Orléans.--DR. MOORE'S View of the Causes, etc., of the

insupportable."--Mémories de De Bouillé, pp. 175, 181. And in June he had remarked, "Que sa
popularité (de La Fayette) dépendait plutôt de la captivité du roi, qu'il tenait prisonnier,
et qui était sous sa garde, que de sa force personnelle, qui n'avait plus d'autre appui que
la milice Parisienne."

CHAPTER XXXII.

[1] A certain set of writers in this country at one time made La Fayette a subject for almost
unmixed eulogy, with such earnestness that it may be worth while to reproduce the opinion expressed
of him by the greatest of his contemporaries--a man as acute in his penetration into character
as he was stainless in honor--the late Duke of Wellington. In the summer of 1815, he told Sir
John Malcolm that "he had used La Fayette like a dog, as he merited. The old rascal," said
he, "had made a false report of his mission to the Emperor of Russia, and I possessed complete
evidence of his having done so. I told him, the moment he entered, of this fact; I did not
even state it in the most delicate manner. I told him he must be sensible he had made a false
report. He made no answer." And the duke bowed him out of the room with unconcealed scorn.--Kaye's
Life of Sir J. Malcolm, ii., p. 109.

[8] The letter took several days to write, and was so interrupted that portions of it have
three different dates affixed, August 16th, 21st, 26th. Mercy's letter, which incloses Burke's
memorial, is dated the 20th, from London, so that the first portion of the queen's letter can
not be regarded as an intentional answer to Burke's arguments, though it is so, as embodying
all the reasons which influenced the queen.

interview, August 21st, 1791, did not in express words denounce the new Constitution (which,
in fact, they had not seen), but, after declaring "the situation of the King of France to be
a matter of common interest to all European sovereigns," and expressing a hope that "the reality
of that interest will be duly appreciated by the other powers whose assistance they invoke,"
they propose that those other powers "shall employ, in conjunction with their majesties, the
most efficacious means, in order to enable the King of France to consolidate in the most perfect
liberty the foundation of a monarchical government, conformable alike to the rights of sovereigns
and the well-being of the French nation."-- Alison, ch. ix., Section 90.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

[1] "Mémoires Particuliers," etc., par A.F. Bertrand de Moleville, i., p. 355. Brissot, Isnard,
Vergniaud, Gaudet, and an infamous ecclesiastic, the Abbé Fauchet, are those whom he particularly
mentions, adding: "Mais M. de Lessart trouva que c'était les payer trop cher, et comme ils
ne voulurent rien rabattre de leur demande, cette négociation n'eut aucune suite, et ne produisit
d'autre effet que d'aigrir davantage ces cinq députés contre ce ministre."

[3] "Mémoires Particuliers," etc., par A.F. Bertrand de Moleville, i., p. 10-12. It furnishes
a striking proof of the general accuracy of Dr. Moore's information, that he, in his "View"
(ii., p. 439), gives the name account of this conversation, his work being published above
twenty years before that of M. Bertrand de Moleville.

[4] "La reine lui répondit par un sourire de pitié, et lui demanda s'il était fou.... C'est
par la reine elle-même que, le lendemain de cette étrange scène, je fus instruit de tous les
détails que je viens de rapporter."--BERTRAND DE MOLEVILLE, i., p. 126.

[5] She herself called him so on this occasion, and he belonged to the Jacobin Club; but he
was also one of the Girondin party, of which, indeed, he was one of the founders, and it was
as a Girondin that he was afterward pursued to death by Robespierre.

before it could reach him), dated March 24th, 1792. In many respects the information De Fersen

[7] It is remarkable, however, that, if we are to take Lamartine as a guide in any respect,
and he certainly was not in intention unfavorable to La Fayette, the marquis was even now playing
a double game. Speaking of this very proposal, he says: "La Fayette himself did not disguise
his ambition for a protectorate under Louis XVI. At the very moment when he seemed devoted
to the preservation of the king he wrote thus to his confidante, La Colombe: 'In the matter
of liberty I do not trust myself either to the king or any other person, and if he were to
assume the sovereign, I would fight against him as I did in 1789.'"--Histoire des Girondins,
xvii., p.7 (English translation). It deserves remark, too, if his words are accurately reported,
that the only occasion 1789 on which he "fought against" Louis must have been October 5th and
6th, when he professed to be using every exertion for his safety.

[8] M. Bertrand expressly affirms the insurrection of August 10th to have been almost exclusively
the work of the Girondin faction.--Mémoires Particuliers, ii., p. 122.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

[1] See ante.

[2] "Histoire de la Terreur," par Mortimer Ternaux, ii., p. 269. For the transactions of this
day, and of the following months, he is by far the most trustworthy guide, as having had access
to official documents of which earlier writers were ignorant. But he admits the extreme difficulty
of ascertaining the precise details and time of each event. And it is not easy in every instance
to reconcile his account with that of Madame de Campan, on whom for many particulars he greatly
relies. He differs from her especially as to the hour at which the different occurrences of
this day took place. For instance, he says (p. 268, note 2) that Mandat left the Tuileries
a little after five, while Madame de Campan says it was four o'clock when the queen told her
he had been murdered. Both, however, agree that it was soon after eight o'clock when the king
left the palace.

[3] "À quatre heures la reine sortit de la chambre du roi, et vint nous dire qu'elle n'espérait
plus rien; que M. Mandat venait d'être assassiné."--MADAME DE CAMPAN, ch. xxi.

[4] "La Terreur," viii., p. 4.

[5] It is clear that this is the opinion formed by M Mortimer Ternaux. He sums up the fourth
chapter of his eighth book with the conclusion that "le palais de la royauté ne fut pas enlevé
de vive force, mais abandonné par ordre de Louis XVI." And in a note he affirms that the entire
number of killed and wounded on the part of the rioters did not exceed one hundred and sixty
"en chiffres ronds."

[7] Madame de Campan, ch. xxi.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

[2] For about a fortnight they had two, both men--Hue, the valet to the dauphin, as well as
Cléry; but Hue was removed on the 2d of September. He, as well as Cléry, has left an account
of the imprisonment till the day of his dismissal.

[3] "Journal de ce qui s'est passé à la tour du Temple," etc. p.28, seq.

[4] "Mémoires Particuliers," par Madame la Duchesse d'Angoulême, p. 21.

[5] Decius was the hero whose example was especially invoked by Madame Roland. The historians
of his own country had never accused him of murdering any one; but she, in the very first month
of the Revolution, had called, with a very curious reading of history, for "some generous Decius
to risk his life to take theirs" (the lives of the king and queen).

[6] The princess told Cléry, "La reine et moi nous nous attendons à tout, et nous ne nous faisons
aucune illusion sur le sort qu'on prépare au roi," etc.--CLÉRY, p. 106.

[7] "Mémoires" de la Duchesse d'Angoulême, p. 53.

CHAPTER XXXIX.

[1] Cléry's "Journal," p. 169.

[2] In March, having an opportunity of communicating with the Count de Provence, she sent these
precious memorials to him for safer custody, with a joint letter from herself and her three
fellow-prisoners: "Having a faithful person on whom we can depend, I profit by the opportunity
to send to my brother and friend this deposit, which may not be intrusted to any other hands.
The bearer will tell you by what a miracle we were able to obtain these precious pledges. I
reserve the name of him who is so useful to us, to tell it you some day myself. The impossibility
which has hitherto existed of sending you any intelligence of us, and the excess of our misfortunes,
make us feel more vividly our cruel separation. May it not lie long. Meanwhile I embrace you
as I love you, and you know that that is with all my heart.--M.A." A line is added by the princess
royal, and signed by her brother, as king, as well as by herself: "I am charged for my brother
and myself to embrace you with all my heart.--M.T. [MARIA TERESA], LOUIS." And another by the
Princess Elizabeth: "I enjoy beforehand the pleasure which you will feel in receiving this
pledge of love and confidence. To be reunited to you and to see you happy is all that I desire.
You know if I love you. I embrace you with all my heart.-- E." The letters were shown by the
Count de Provence to Cléry, whom he allowed to take a copy of them.--CLÉRY'S Journal, p. 174.

[3] "Mémoires" de la Duchesse d'Angoulême, p. 56.

[4] It was burned in 1871, in the time of the Commune.

[6] Lanjuinais had subsequently the singular fortune of gaining the confidence of both Napoleon
and Lounis XVIII. The decree against him was reversed in 1795, and he became a professor at
Rennes. Though he had opposed the making of Napoleon consul for life, Napoleon gave him a place
in his Senate; and at the first restoration, in 1814, Louis XVIII named him a peer of France.
He died in 1827.

[7] Some of the apologists of the Girondins--nearly all the oldest criminals of the Revolution
have found defenders, except perhaps Marat and Robespierre--have affirmed that the Girondins,
though they had not courage to give their votes to save the life of Louis, yet hoped to save
him by voting for an appeal to the people; but the order in which the different questions were
put to the Convention is a complete disproof of this plea. The first question put was, Was
Louis guilty? They all voted "Oui" (Lacretelle, x., p. 403). But though on the second question,
whether this verdict should be submitted to the people for ratification, many of them did vote
for such an appeal being made, yet after the appeal had been rejected by a majority of one
hundred and forty-two, and the third question, "What penalty shall be inflicted on Louis?"
(Lacretelle, x., p. 441) was put to the Convention, they all except Lanjuinais voted for "death."
The majorities were, on their question, 683 to 66; on the second, 423 to 281; on the third,
387 to 334; so that on this last, the fatal question, it would have been easy for the Girondins
to have turned the scale. And Lamartine himself expressly affirms (xxxv., p.5) that the king's
life depended on the Girondin vote, and that his death was chiefly owing to Vergniaud.

lui savait gré d'être charmante," p.5, ed. 1820.

[13] Great interest was felt for her in England. Walpole's testimony in such a matter is particularly
valuable, because he had not only been intimately acquainted with all the gossip of the French
capital for many years, but also because his principal friends in France did not belong to
the party which might have been expected to be most favorable to the queen. Had there been
the very slightest foundation for the calumnies which had been propagated against her, we may
be sure that such a person as Madame du Deffand would not only have heard them, but would have
been but too willing to believe them. His denunciation of them is a proof that she knew their
falsehood.

[14] Goncourt, p. 388, quoting La Quotidienne of October 17th, 18th.

[15] The depositions which the little king had been compelled to sign contained accusations
of his aunt as well as of his mother.

[16] As we shall see in the close of the letter, she did not regard those priests who had taken
the oath imposed by the Assembly, but which the Pope had condemned, as any longer priests.
