ON THE PRONUNCIATION OF ENGLISH WORDS DERIVED FROM LATIN

[This paper may perhaps need a few words of introduction concerning the history of the pronunciation
of Latin in England.

The Latin taught by Pope Gregory's missionaries to their English converts at the beginning
of the seventh century was a living language. Its pronunciation, in the mouths of educated
people when they spoke carefully, was still practically what it had been in the first century,
with the following important exceptions. 1. The consonantal u was sounded like the v of modern
English, 2. The c before front vowels (e, i, o, æ, oe), and the combinations t[)i], c[)i] before
vowels, were pronounced ts. 3. The g before front vowels had a sound closely resembling that
of the Latin consonantal i. 4. The s between vowels was pronounced like our s. 5. The combinations
æ, oe were no longer pronounced as diphthongs, but like the simple e. 6. The ancient vowel-quantities
were preserved only in the penultima of polysyllables (where they determined the stress); in
all other positions the original system of quantities had given place to a new system based
mainly on rhythm. Of this system in detail we have little certain knowledge; but one of its
features was that the vowel which ended the first syllable of a disyllabic was always long:
p[=a]ter, p[=a]trem, D[=e]us, p[=i]us, [=i]ter, [=o]vis, h[=u]mus.

Even so early as the beginning of the fifth century, St. Augustine tells us that the vowel-quantities,
which it was necessary to learn in order to write verse correctly, were not observed in speech.
The Latin-speaking schoolboy had to learn them in much the same fashion as did the English
schoolboy of the nineteenth century.

It is interesting to observe that, while the English scholars of the tenth century pronounced
their Latin in the manner which their ancestors had learned from the continental missionaries,
the tradition of the ancient vowel-quantities still survived (to some extent at least) among
their British neighbours, whose knowledge of Latin was an inheritance from the days of Roman
rule. On this point the following passage from the preface to Ælfric's Latin Grammar (written
for English schoolboys about A.D. 1000) is instructive:--

    Miror ualde quare multi corripiunt sillabas in prosa quae in
    metro breues sunt, cum prosa absoluta sit a lege metri; sicut
    pronuntiant pater brittonice et malus et similia, quae in
    metro habentur breues. Mihi tamen uidetur melius inuocare Deum
    Patrem honorifice producta sillaba quam brittonice corripere,
    quia nec Deus arti grammaticae subiciendus est.

The British contagion of which Ælfric here complains had no permanent effect. For after the
Norman Conquest English boys learned their Latin from teachers whose ordinary language was
French. For a time, they were not usually taught to write or read English, but only French
and Latin; so that the Englishmen who attempted to write their native language did so in a
phonetic orthography on a French basis. The higher classes in England, all through the thirteenth
century, had two native languages, English and French.

In the grammar schools, the Latin lessons were given in French; it was not till the middle
of the fourteenth century that a bold educational reformer, John Cornwall, could venture to
make English the vehicle of instruction. In reading Latin, the rhythmically-determined vowel-quantities
of post-classical times were used; and the Roman letters were pronounced, first as they were
in French, and afterwards as in English, but in the fourteenth century this made little difference.

In Chaucer's time, the other nations of Europe, no less than England, pronounced Latin after
the fashion of their own vernaculars. When, subsequently, the phonetic values of the letters
in the vernacular gradually changed, the Latin pronunciation altered likewise. Hence, in the
end, the pronunciation of Latin has become different in different countries. A scholar born
in Italy has great difficulty in following a Frenchman speaking Latin. He has greater difficulty
in understanding an Englishman's Latin, because in English the changes in the sounds of the
letters have been greater than in any other language. Every vowel-letter has several sounds,
and the normal long sound of every vowel-letter has no resemblance whatever to its normal short
sound. As in England the pronunciation of Latin developed insensibly along with that of the
native tongue, it eventually became so peculiar that by comparison the 'continental pronunciation'
may be regarded as uniform.

It is sometimes imagined that the modern English way of pronouncing Latin was a deliberate
invention of the Protestant reformers. For this view there is no foundation in fact. It may
be conceded that English ecclesiastics and scholars who had frequent occasion to converse in
Latin with Italians would learn to pronounce it in the Italian way; and no doubt the Reformation
must have operated to arrest the growing tendency to the Italianization of English Latin. But
there is no evidence that before the Reformation the un-English pronunciation was taught in
the schools. The grammar-school pronunciation of the early nineteenth century was the lineal
descendant of the grammar-school pronunciation of the fourteenth century.

This traditional system of pronunciation is now rapidly becoming obsolete, and for very good
reasons. But it is the basis of the pronunciation of the many classical derivatives in English;
and therefore it is highly important that we should understand precisely what it was before
it began to be sophisticated (as in our own early days) by sporadic and inconsistent attempts
to restore the classical quantities. In the following paper Mr. Sargeaunt describes, with a
minuteness not before attempted, the genuine English tradition of Latin pronunciation, and
points out its significance as a factor in the development of modern English.

It seems not to be generally known that there is a real principle in the English pronunciation
of words borrowed from Latin and Greek, whether directly or through French. In this matter
the very knowledge of classical Latin, of its stresses and its quantities, still more perhaps
an acquaintance with Greek, is apt to mislead. Some speakers seem to think that their scholarship
will be doubted unless they say 'doctrínal' and 'scriptúral' and 'cinéma'. The object of this
paper is to show by setting forth the principles consciously or unconsciously followed by our
ancestors that such pronunciations are as erroneous as in the case of the ordinary man they
are unnatural and pedantic. An exception for which there is a reason must of course be accepted,
but an exception for which reason is unsound is on every ground to be deprecated. Among other
motives for preserving the traditional pronunciation must be reckoned the claim of poetry.
Mark Pattison notes how a passage of Pope which deals with the Barrier Treaty loses much of
its effect because we no longer stress the second syllable of 'barrier'. Pope's word is gone
beyond recovery, but others which are threatened by false theories may yet be preserved.

The New English Dictionary, whose business it is to record facts, shows that in not a few common
words there is at present much confusion and uncertainty concerning the right pronunciation.
This applies mostly to the position of the stress or, as some prefer to call it, the accent,
but in many cases it is true also of the quantity of the vowels. It is desirable to show that
there is a principle in this matter, rules which have been naturally and unconsciously obeyed,
because they harmonize with the genius of the English tongue.

For nearly three centuries from the Reformation to the Victorian era there was in this country
a uniform pronunciation of Latin. It had its own definite principles, involving in some cases
a disregard of the classical quantities though not of the classical stress or accent. It survives
in borrowed words such as [=a]li[)a]s and st[)a]mina, in naturalized legal phrases, such as
N[=i]s[=i] Prius and [=o]nus probandi, and with some few changes in the Westminster Play. This
pronunciation is now out of fashion, but, since its supersession does not justify a change
in the pronunciation of words which have become part of our language, it will be well to begin
with a formulation of its rules.

The rule of Latin stress was observed as it obtained in the time of Quintilian. In the earliest
Latin the usage had been other, the stress coming as early in the word as was possible. Down
to the days of Terence and probably somewhat later the old rule still held good of quadrisyllables
with the scansion of m[)u]l[)i][)e]r[)i]s or m[)u]l[)i][)e]r[=e]s, but in other words had given
way to the later Quintilian rule, that all words with a long unit as penultimate had the stress
on the vowel in that unit, while words of more than two syllables with a short penultimate
had the stress on the antepenultimate. I say 'unit' because here, as in scansion, what counts
is not the syllable, but the vowel plus all the consonants that come between it and the next
vowel. Thus inférnus, where the penultimate vowel is short, no less than suprémus, where it
is long, has the stress on the penultima. In volucris, where the penultimate unit was short,
as it was in prose and could be in verse, the stress was on the o, but when ucr made a long
unit the stress comes on the u, though of course the vowel remains short. In polysyllables
there was a secondary stress on the alternate vowels. Ignorance of this usage has made a present-day
critic falsely accuse Shakespeare of a false quantity in the line

  Coríolánus in Coríoli.

It may be safely said that from the Reformation to the nineteenth century no Englishman pronounced
the last word otherwise than I have written it. The author of the Pronouncing Dictionary attached
to the 'Dictionary of Gardening' unfortunately instructs us to say gládiolus on the ground
that the i is short. The ground alleged, though true, is irrelevant, and, although Terence
would have pronounced it gládiolus, Quintilian, like Cicero, would have said gladíolus. Mr.
Myles quotes Pliny for the word, but Pliny would no more have thought of saying gládiolus than
we should now think of saying 'laboúr' except when we are reading Chaucer.

We need not here discuss the dubious exceptions to this rule, such as words with an enclitic
attached, e.g. prim[)a]que in which some authorities put the stress on the vowel which precedes
the enclitic, or such clipt words as 'illuc', where the stress may at one time have fallen
on the last vowel. In any case no English word is concerned.

In very long words the due alternation of stressed and unstressed vowels was not easy to maintain.
There was no difficulty in such a combination as hónoríficábilí or as tudínitátibús, but with
the halves put together there would be a tendency to say hónoríficabilitúdinitátibus. Thus
there ought not to be much difficulty in saying Cónstantínopólitáni, whether you keep the long
antepenultima or shorten it after the English way; but he who forced the reluctant word to
end an hexameter must have had 'Constantinóple' in his mind, and therefore said Constántinópolitáni
with two false stresses. The result was an illicit lengthening of the second o. His other false
quantity, the shortening of the second i, was due to the English pronunciation, the influence
of such words as 'metropol[)i]tan', and, as old schoolmasters used to put it, a neglect of
the Gradus. Even when the stress falls on this antepenultimate i, it is short in English speech.
Doubtless Milton shortened it in 'Areopagitica', just as English usage made him lengthen the
initial vowel of the word.

Probably very few of the Englishmen who used the traditional pronunciation of Latin knew that
they gave many different sounds to each of the symbols or letters. Words which have been transported
bodily into English will provide examples under each head. It will be understood that in the
traditional pronunciation of Latin these words were spoken exactly as they are spoken in the
English of the present day. For the sake of simplicity it may be allowed us to ignore some
distinctions rightly made by phoneticians. Thus the long initial vowel of alias is not really
the same as the long initial vowel of area, but the two will be treated as identical. It will
thus be possible to write of only three kinds of vowels, long, short, and obscure.

The letter or symbol a stood for two long sounds, heard in the first syllables of alias and
of larva, for the short sound heard in the first syllable of stamina, and for the obscure sound
heard in the last syllable of each of these last two words in English.

The letter e stood for the long sounds heard in genus and in verbum, for the short sound heard
in item, and for the obscure sound heard in cancer. When it ended a word it had, if short,
the sound of a short i, as in pro lege, rege, grege, as also in unstressed syllables in such
words as precentor and regalia.

The letter i stood for the two long sounds heard in minor and in circus and for the short sound
heard in premium and incubus.

The letter o stood for the two long sounds heard in odium and in corpus, for the short sound
in scrofula, and for the obscure in extempore.

The two long sounds of u are heard in rumor, if that spelling may be allowed, and in the middle
syllable of laburnum, the two short sounds in the first u of incubus and in the first u of
lustrum, the obscure sound in the final syllables of these two words. Further the long sound
was preceded except after l and r by a parasitic y as in albumen and incubus. This parasitic
y is perhaps not of very long standing. In some old families the tradition still compels such
pronunciations as moosic.

The diphthongs æ and oe were merely e, while au and eu were sounded as in our August and Euxine.
The two latter diphthongs stood alone in never being shortened even when they were unstressed
and followed by two consonants. Thus men said [=Eu]stolia and [=Au]gustus, while they said
[)Æ]schylus and [)OE]dipus. Dryden and many others usually wrote the Æ as E. Thus Garrick in
a letter commends an adaptation of 'Eschylus', and although Boswell reports him as asking Harris
'Pray, Sir, have you read Potter's Æschylus?' both the speaker and the reporter called the
name Eschylus.

The letter y was treated as i.

The consonants were pronounced as in English words derived from Latin. Thus c before e, i,
y, æ, and oe was s, as in census, circus, Cyrus, Cæsar, and coelestial, a spelling not classical
and now out of use. Elsewhere c was k. Before the same vowels g was j (d[ezh]), as in genus,
gibbus, gyrus. The sibilant was voiced or voiceless as in English words, the one in rosaceus,
the other in saliva.

It will be seen that the Latin sounds were throughout frankly Anglicized. According to Burney
a like principle was followed by Burke when he read French poetry aloud. He read it as though
it were English. Thus on his lips the French word comment was pronounced as the English word
comment.

The rule that overrode all others, though it has the exceptions given below, was that vowels
and any other diphthongs than au and eu, if they were followed by two consonants, were pronounced
short. Thus a in magnus, though long in classical Latin, was pronounced as in our 'magnitude',
and e in census, in Greek transcription represented by [Greek: eta], was pronounced short,
as it is when borrowed into English. So were the penultimate vowels in villa, nullus, cæspes.

This rule of shortening the vowel before two consonants held good even when in fact only one
was pronounced, as in nullus and other words where a double consonant was written and in Italian
pronounced.

Moreover, the parasitic y was treated as a consonant, hence our 'v[)a]cuum'.

In the penultima qu was treated as a single consonant, so that the vowel was pronounced long
in [=a]quam, [=e]quam, in[=i]quam, l[=o]quor. So it was after o, hence our 'coll[=o]quial';
but in earlier syllables than the penultima qu was treated as a double consonant, hence our
'sub[)a]queous', 'equity', 'iniquity'.

EXCEPTIONS.

1. When the former of the two consonants was r and the latter another consonant than r, as
in the series represented by larva, verbum, circus, corpus, laburnum, the vowels are a separate
class of long vowels, though not really recognized as such. Of course our ancestors and the
Gradus marked them long because in verse the vowel with the two consonants makes a long unit.

2. A fully stressed vowel before a mute and r, or before d or pl, was pronounced long in the
penultima. Latin examples are labrum, Hebrum, librum, probrum, rubrum, acrem, cedrum, vafrum,
agrum, pigrum, aprum, veprem, patrem, citrum, utrum, triplus, duplex, Cyclops. Moreover, in
other syllables than the penultima the vowel in the same combinations was pronounced long if
the two following vowels had no consonant between them, as patria, Hadria, acrius. (Our 'triple'
comes from triplum and is a duplicate of 'treble'. Perhaps the short vowel is due to its passage
through French. Our 'citron' comes from citronem, in which i was short.)

3. The preposition and adverb post was pronounced with a long vowel both by itself and in composition
with verbs, but its adjectives did not follow suit. Hence we say in English 'p[=o]stpone',
but 'p[)o]sterior' and 'p[)o]sthumous'.

Monosyllables ending in a vowel were pronounced long, those ending in a consonant short. Enclitics
like que were no real exception as they formed part of the preceding word. There were, however,
some real exceptions.

1. Pronouns ending in -os, as hos, quos. These followed eos and illos.

2. Words ending in -es, as pes, res.

3. Words ending in r, as par, fer, vir, cor, fur. These had that form of long vowel which we
use in 'part', 'fertile', 'virtue', 'cordate', 'furtive'.

In, disyllables the former vowel or diphthong, if followed by a single consonant, or by a mute
and r, or by cl or pl, was pronounced long, a usage which according to Mr. Henry Bradley dates
in spoken Latin from the fourth century. Examples are apex, tenet, item, focus, pupa, Psyche,
Cæsar, foetus. I believe that at first the only exceptions were tibi, sibi, ibi, quibus, tribus.
In later days the imperfect and future of sum became exceptions. Here perhaps the short vowel
arose from the hideous and wholly erroneous habit, happily never universal though still in
some vogue, of reciting erám, erás, erát. There are actually schoolbooks which treat the verse
ictus, the beat of the chanter's foot, as a word stress and prescribe terra tribús scopulís.
I can say of these books only Pereant ipsi, mutescant scriptores, and do not mind using a post-classical
word in order to say it.

In disyllables the former vowel or diphthong, if followed immediately by another vowel or diphthong,
had the quality, and if emphatic also the quality, of a long vowel. The distinction was not
recognized, and seems not to be generally acknowledged even now. We seem not to have borrowed
many words which will illustrate this. We have however fiat, and pius was pronounced exactly
as we pronounce 'pious', while for a diphthong we may quote Shelley,

  Mid the mountains Euganean
  I stood listening to the paean.

English derivatives will show the long quality of the vowels in aer, deus, coit, duo. To these
add Graius.

The rule of apex applies also to words of more than two syllables with long penultima, as gravamen,
arena, saliva, abdomen, acumen. The rule of aer also holds good though it hardly has other
instances than Greek names, as Macháon, Ænéas, Thalía, Achelóus, Ach['æ]i.

In words of more than two syllables with short penultima the vowel in the stressed antepenultima
was pronounced short when there was a consonant between the two last vowels, and i and y were
short even when no consonant stood in that place. Examples are stamina, Sexagesima, minimum,
modicum, tibia, Polybius. But u, au, eu were, as usual, exceptions, as tumulus, Aufidus, Eutychus.
I believe that originally men said C[)æ]sarem, as they certainly said c[)æ]spitem and C[)æ]tulum,
as also C[)æ]sarea, but here in familiar words the cases came to follow the nominative.

Exceptions to the rule were verb forms which had [=a]v, [=e]v, [=i]v, or [=o]v in the antepenultima,
as am[=a]veram, defieverat, audivero, moveras, and like forms from aorists with the penultima
long, as suaseram, egero, miserat, roseras, and their compounds.

This rule was among the first to break down, and about the middle of the nineteenth century
the Westminster Play began to observe the true quantities in the antepenultimate syllables.
Thus in spite of 'cons[)i]deration' boys said s[=i]dera, and in spite of 'n[)o]minal' they
said nômina, while they still said s[)o]litus and r[)a]pidus.

On the other hand the following rule, of which borrowed words provide many examples, still
obtains in the Play. In words of more than two syllables any vowel in the antepenultima other
than i or y was pronounced long if no consonant divided the two following vowels. Possibly
the reason was that there was a synæresis of the two vowels, but I doubt this, for a parasitic
y was treated as a consonant. Examples are alias, genius, odium, junior, anæmia, and on the
other hand f[)i]lius, L[)y]dia. Compound verbs with a short prefix were exceptions, as [)o]beo,
r[)e]creo, whence our 'recreant'. A long prefix remained long as in d[=e]sino. The only other
exception that I can remember was Ph[)o]loe.

In polysyllables the general rule was that all vowels and diphthongs before the penultima other
than u, when it bore a primary or secondary stress, and au and eu were pronounced short except
where the 'alias' rule or the 'larva' rule applied. Thus we said h[)e]r[)e]ditaritis, [)æ]qu[)a]bilitas,
imb[)e]cillus, susp[)i]cionem, but fid[=u]ciarius, m[=e]diocritas, p[=a]rticipare. I do not
know why the popular voice now gives [)A]riadne, for our forefathers said [=A]riadne as they
said [=a]rea.

In very long words the alternation of stress and no-stress was insisted on. I remember a schoolmaster
who took his degree at Oxford in the year 1827 reproving a boy for saying Álphesib['oe]us instead
of Alphesib['oe]us, and I suspect that Wordsworth meant no inverted stress in

  Laódamía, that at Jove's command--

nor Landor in

  Artémidóra, gods invisible--

though I hope that they did.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is not to be thought that these rules were in any way arbitrary. So little was this so that,
I believe, they were never even formulated. If examples with the quantities marked were ever
given, they must have been for the use of foreigners settling in England. English boys did
not want rules, and their teachers could not really have given them. The teachers did not understand
that each vowel represented not two sounds only, a long and a short, but many more. This fact
was no more understood by John Walker, the actor and lexicographer, who in 1798 published a
Key to the Classical Pronunciation of Greek and Latin proper names. His general rule was wrong
as a general rule, and so far as it agreed with facts it was useless. He says that when a vowel
ends a syllable it is long, and when it does not it is short. Apart from the confusion of cause
and effect there is the error of identifying for instance the e in beatus and the e in habebat.
Moreover, Walker confounds the u in 'curfew', really long, with the short and otherwise different
u in 'but'. The rule was useless as a guide, for it did not say whether moneo for instance
was to be read as ino-neo or as mon-eo, and therefore whether the o was to be long or short.
Even Walker's list is no exact guide. He gives for instance M[=o]-na, which is right, and M[=o]-næses,
which is not. Now without going into the difference between long vowels and ordinary vowels,
of which latter some are long in scansion and some short, it is clear that there is no identity.
In fact Mona, has the long o of 'moan' and Monæses the ordinary o of 'monaster'. A boy at school
was not troubled by these matters. He had only two things to learn, first the quantity of the
penultimate unit, second the fact that a final vowel was pronounced. When he knew these two
things he gave the Latin word the sounds which it would have if it were an English word imported
from the Latin. Thus he finds the word civilitate. I am not sure that he could find it, but
that does not matter. He would know 'civility', and he learns that the penultima of the Latin
word is long. Therefore he says c[)i]v[)i]l[)i]t[=a]t[)e]. Again he knows '[)i]nf[)i]n[)i]t'
(I must be allowed to spell the word as it is pronounced except in corrupt quires). He finds
that the penultima of infinitivus is long, and he therefore says [)i]nf[)i]n[)i]t[=i]v[)u]s.
Again he knows 'irradiate', and finding that the penultima of irradiabitur is short he says
[)i]rr[=a]d[)i][)a]b[)i]t[)u]r. It is true that some of these verb forms under the influence
of their congeners came to have an exceptional pronunciation. Thus irradi[=a]bit led at last
to irradi[=a]bitur, but I doubt whether this occurred before the nineteenth century. The word
dabitur, almost naturalized by Luther's adage of date et dabitur, kept its short a down to
the time when it regained it, in a slightly different form, by its Roman right; and am[)a]mini
and mon[)e]mini were unwavering in their use. Old people said v[=a]ri[)a]bilis long after the
true quantities had asserted themselves, and the word as the specific name of a plant may be
heard even now. Its first syllable of course follows what I shall call the 'alias' rule. We
may still see this rule in other instances. All men say 'hippopót[)a]mus', and even those who
know that this a is short in Greek can say nothing but 'Mesopot[=a]mia', unless indeed the
word lose its blessed and comforting powers in a disyllabic abbreviation. When a country was
named after Cecil Rhodes, where the e in the surname is mute, we all called it 'Rhod[=e]sia'.
Had it been named after a Newman, where the a is short or rather obscure, we should all have
called it 'Newm[=a]nia ', while, named after a Davis, it would certainly have been 'Dav[)i]sia'.
The process of thought would in each case have been unconscious. A new example is 'aviation',
whose first vowel has been instinctively lengthened.

Again, when the word 'telegram' was coined, some scholars objected to its formation and insisted
upon 'telegrapheme', but the most obdurate Grecian did not propose to keep the long Greek vowel
in the first syllable. When only the other day 'cinematograph' made its not wholly desirable
appearance, it made no claim to a long vowel in either of its two first syllables. Not till
it was reasonably shortened into 'c[)i]n[)e]ma' did a Judge from the Bench make a lawless decree
for a long second vowel, and even he left the i short though it is long in Greek.

Of course with the manner of speech the quantities had to be learnt separately. The task was
not as difficult as some may think. To boys with a taste for making verses the thumbing of
a Gradus (I hope that no one calls it a Gr[)a]dus) was always a delightful occupation, and
a quantity once learnt was seldom forgotten. It must be admitted that, as boys were forced
to do verses, whether they could or not, there were always some who could read and yet forget.

Although these usages did not precede but followed the pronunciation of words already borrowed
from Latin, we may use them to classify the changes of quantity. We shall see that although
there are some exceptions for which it is difficult to give a reason, yet most of the exceptions
fall under two classes. When words came to us through French, the pronunciation was often affected
by the French form of the word. Thus the adjective 'present' would, if it had come direct from
Latin, have had a long vowel in the first syllable. To an English ear 'pr[)e]sent' seemed nearer
than 'pr[=e]sent' to the French 'présent'. The N.E.D. says that 'gladiator' comes straight
from the Latin 'gladiatorem'. Surely in that case it would have had its first vowel long, as
in 'radiator' and 'mediator'. In any case its pronunciation must have been affected by 'gladiateur'.
The other class of exceptions consists of words deliberately introduced by writers at a late
period. Thus 'adorable' began as a penman's word. Following 'inéxorable' and the like it should
have been 'ádorable'. Actually it was formed by adding -able to 'adóre', like 'laughable'.
It is now too stiff in the joints to think of a change, and must continue to figure with the
other sins of the Restoration.

Before dealing with the words as classified by their formation, we may make short lists of

to the classical quantities.

From [)u]: n[=u]merous, C[=u]pid, all[=u]vial, cer[=u]lean.

The N.E.D. prefers the spelling 'oecumenical'; but Newman wrote naturally 'ecumenical', and
so does Dr. J.B. Bury. Dublin scholarship has in this matter been markedly correct.

CLASSIFICATION OF WORDS ACCORDING TO THEIR LATIN STEMS.

In classification it seems simplest to take the words according to their Latin stems. We must,
however, first deal with a class of adjectives borrowed bodily from the Latin nominative masculine
with the insertion of a meaningless o before the final -us.[1] These of course follow the rules
given above. In words of more than two syllables the antepenultimate and stressed vowel is
shortened, as '[)e]mulous' from æmulus and in 'fr[)i]volous' from fr[=i]volus, except where
by the 'alias' rule it is long, as in 'egr[=e]gious' from egr[)e]gius. Words coined on this
analogy also follow the rules. Thus 'glabrous' and 'fibrous' have the vowels long, as in the
traditional pronunciation of glabrum and fibrum, where the vowels in classical Latin were short.
The stressed u being always long we have 'lug[=u]brious' and 'sal[=u]brious', the length being
independent of the 'alias' rule. Some words ending in -ous are not of this class. Thus 'odorous'
and 'clamorous' appear in Italian as odoroso and clamoroso. Milton has

  Sonórous mettal blowing Martial sounds.

The Italian is sonoro, and our word was simply the Latin sonorus borrowed bodily at a somewhat
late period. Hence the stress remains on the penultima. Skeat thought that the word would at
last become 'sónorous'. It maybe hoped that Milton's line will save it from the effect of a
false analogy.

[Footnote 1: I regard this statement as inaccurate. The -ous in these words does not come from
the nominative ending -us, but is the ordinary -ous from L. -osus (through Fr.). It was added
to many Latin adjective stems, because the need of a distinctly adjectival ending was felt.
Similarly in early French -eux was appended to adjectives when they were felt to require a
termination, as in pieux from pi-us. Compare the English capacious, veracious, hilarious, where
-ous is added to other stems than those in o. Other suffixes of Latin origin are used in the
same way: e.g. -al in aerial, ethereal.--H.B.]

In classifying by stems it will be well to add, where possible, words of Greek origin. Except
in some late introductions Greek words, except when introduced bodily, have been treated as
if they came through Latin, and some of the bodily introductions are in the same case. Thus
'anæsthetic' is spelt with the Latin diphthong and the Latin c. Even 'skeleton' had a c to
start with, while the modern and wholly abominable 'kaleidoscope' is unprincipled on the face
of it.

STEMS ENDING IN -ANT AND -ENT. These are participles or words formed as such. Our words have
shed a syllable, thus regentem has become 'regent'. Disyllables follow the 'apex' rule and
lengthen the first vowel, as 'agent', 'decent', 'potent'. Exceptions are 'clement' and 'present',
perhaps under French influence. Words of more than two syllables with a single consonant before
the termination throw the stress back and shorten a long penultima, as 'ignorant', 'president',
'confident', 'adjutant'. Where there are two heavy consonants, the stress remains on the penultima,
as 'consultant', 'triumphant', even when one of the consonants is not pronounced, as 'reminiscent'.
In some cases the Latinists seem to have deliberately altered the natural pronunciation. Thus
Gower has 'ápparaúnt', but the word became 'appárent' before Shakespeare's time, and later
introductions such as 'adherent' followed it. What right 'adjacent' has to its long vowel and
penultimate stress I do not know, but it cannot be altered now.

STEMS ENDING IN -ATO AND -UTO. These are mostly past participles, but many of them are used
in English as verbs. It must be admitted that the disyllabic words are not wholly constant
to a principle. Those verbs that come from -latum consistently stress the last vowel, as 'dilate',
'relate', 'collate'. So does 'create', because of one vowel following another. Of the rest
all the words of any rank have the stress on the penultima, as 'vibrate', 'frustrate', 'mígrate',
'cástrate', 'púlsate', 'vácate'. Thus Pope has

  The whisper, that to greatness still too near,
  Perhaps, yet vibrates on his Sov'reign's ear,

and Shelley

  Music, when soft voices die,
  Vibrates in the memory.

There are, however, verbs of no literary account which in usage either vary in the stress or
take it on the latter syllable. Such are 'locate', 'orate', 'negate', 'placate', and perhaps
'rotate'. With most of these we could well dispense. 'Equate' is mainly a technical word. Dictionaries
seem to prefer the stress on the ultima, but some at least of the early Victorian mathematicians
said 'équate', and the pronunciation is to be supported. Trisyllabic verbs throw the stress
back and shorten the penultima, as 'dés[)o]late', 'súff[)o]cate', 'scínt[)i]llate'. Even words
with heavy double consonants have adopted this habit. Thus where Browning has (like Milton
and Cowper)

  I the Trinity illústrate
    Drinking water'd orange pulp,
  In three sips the Arian frustrate.
    While he drains his at one gulp,

it is now usual to say 'íllustrate'.

Adjectives of this class take as early a stress as they can, as 'órnate', 'pínnate', 'délicate',
'fórtunate'. Nouns from all these words throw the accent back and shorten or obscure all but
the penultimate vowel, as 'ignorance', 'evaporation'.

STEMS IN -IA. Here even disyllables shorten the penultima, as 'copy', 'province', while longer
words throw the stress back as well as shorten the penultima, as 'injury', 'colony', while
'ignominy' almost lost its penultimate vowel, and therefore threw back the stress to the first
syllable. Shakespeare frankly writes the word as a trisyllable,

  Thy ignomy sleep with thee in the grave.

Milton restored the lost syllable, often eliding the final vowel, as in

  Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain.

Even with heavy consonants we have the early stress, as in 'industry'. Greek words follow the
same rules, as 'agony', 'melody'. Some words of this class have under French influence been
further abbreviated, as 'concord'.

Corresponding STEMS IN -IO keep the same rules. Perhaps the only disyllable is 'study'; the
shortening of a stressed u shows its immediate derivation from the old French estudie. Trisyllabic
examples are 'colloquy', 'ministry', 'perjury'. Many words of this class have been further
abbreviated in their passage through French. Such are 'benefice', 'divorce', 'office', 'presage',
'suffrage', 'vestige', 'adverb', 'homicide', 'proverb'. The stress in 'divórce' is due to the
long vowel and the two consonants. A few of these words have been borrowed bodily from Latin,
as 'odium', 'tedium', 'opprobrium'.

STEMS IN -DO AND -TO (-SO). These words lose the final Latin syllable and keep the stress on
the vowel which bore it in Latin. The stressed vowel, except in au, eu, is short, even when,
as in 'vivid', 'florid', it was long in classical Latin. This, of course, is in accord with
the English pronunciation of Latin. Examples are 'acid', 'tepid', 'rigid', 'horrid', 'humid',
'lurid ', 'absurd', 'tacit', 'digit', 'deposit', 'compact', 'complex', 'revise', 'response',
'acute'. Those which have the suffix -es prefixed throw the stress back, as 'honest', 'modest'.
Those which have the suffix -men prefixed also throw the stress back, as 'moment', 'pigment',
'torment', and to the antepenultima, if there be one, as 'argument', 'armament', 'emolument',
the penultimate vowel becoming short or obscure. In 'temperament' the tendency of the second
syllable to disappear has carried the stress still further back. We may compare 'Séptuagint',
where u becomes consonantal. An exception for which I cannot account is 'cemént', but Shakespeare
has 'cément'.

STEMS IN -T[=A]T. These are nouns and have the stress on the antepenultima, which in Latin
bore the secondary stress. They of course show the usual shortening of the vowels with the
usual exceptions. Examples are 'charity', 'equity', 'liberty', 'ferocity', 'authority', and
with long antepenultima 'immunity', 'security', 'university'. With no vowel before the penultima
the long quality is, as usual, preserved, as in 'satiety'.

STEMS IN -OSO. These are adjectives and throw the stress back to the antepenultima, if there
be one. In disyllables the penultimate vowel is long, as in 'famous', 'vinous'; in longer words
the antepenultimate vowel is short, as 'criminous', 'generous'. Many, however, fall under the
'alias' rule, as 'ingenious', 'odious', while those which have i in the penultimate run the
two last syllables into one, as 'pernicious', 'religious', 'vicious'. A few late introductions,
coming straight from the Latin, retained the Latin stress, as 'morose', 'verbose'.

STEMS IN -T[=O]RIO AND -S[=O]RIO. In these words the stress goes back to the fourth syllable
from the end, this in Latin having the secondary stress, or, as in 'circulatory', 'ambulatory',
even further. In fact the o, which of course is shortened, tends to disappear. Examples are
'declamatory', 'desultory', 'oratory', 'predatory', 'territory'. Three consonants running,
as in 'perfunctory', keep the stress where it has to be in a trisyllable, such as 'victory'.
So does a long vowel before r and another consonant, as in 'precursory'. Otherwise two consonants
have not this effect, as in 'prómontory', 'cónsistory'. In spite of Milton's

  A gloomy Consistory, and them amidst
  With looks agast and sad he thus bespake,

the word is sometimes mispronounced.

STEMS IN -[=A]RIO. These follow the same rules, except that, as in 'ádversary', combinations
like ers are shortened and the stress goes back; and that words ending in -entary, such as
'elementary' and 'testamentary', stress the antepenultima. Examples are 'antiquary', 'honorary',
'voluntary', 'emissary'. It is difficult to see a reason for an irregular quantity in the antepenultima
of some trisyllables. The general rule makes it short, as in 'granary', 'salary', but in 'library'
and 'notary' it has been lengthened. The N.E.D. gives 'pl[=e]nary', but our grandfathers said
'pl[)e]nary'. Of course 'diary' gives a long quality to the i.

STEMS IN -[)I]LI. These seem originally to have retained the short i. Thus Milton's spelling
is 'facil' and 'fertil' while other seventeenth-century writers give 'steril'. This pronunciation
still obtains in America, but in England the words seem to have been usually assimilated to
'fragile', as Milton spells it, which perhaps always lengthened the vowel. The penultimate
vowel is short.

STEMS IN -[=I]LI. Here the long i is retained, and in disyllables the penultima is lengthened,
as in 'anile', 'senile', 'virile'. There is no excuse for following the classical quantity
in the former syllables of any of these words. As an English word 'sedilia' shortens the antepenultimate,
like 'tibia' and the rest, the 'alias' rule not applying when the vowel is i.

STEMS IN -B[)I]LI. These mostly come through French and change the suffix into -ble. Disyllables
lengthen the penultima, as 'able', 'stable', 'noble', while 'mobile', as in French, lengthens
its latter vowel. Trisyllables shorten and stress the antepenultima, as 'placable', 'equable',
but of course u remains long, as in 'mutable'. Longer words throw the stress further back,
except mere negatives, like 'implácable', and words with heavy consonants such as 'delectable'.
Examples are 'miserable', 'admirable', 'intolerable', 'despicable'. The Poet Laureate holds
that in these words Milton kept the long Italian a of the penultimate or secondary stress.

  Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable.

In English we have naturalized -able as a suffix and added it to almost any verb, as 'laughable',
'indescribable', 'desirable'. The last word may have been taken from French. The form 'des[)i]derable'
occurs from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century. Originally 'acceptable' threw the stress
back, as in Milton's

  So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,

but the double mute has brought it into line with 'delectable'. Nowadays one sometimes hears
'dispútable', 'despícable', but these are intolerable vulgarisms.

SUFFIXES IN T[)I]LI AND S[)I]LI. These words mostly lengthen the i and make the usual shortenings,
as 'missile', 'sessile', 'textile', 'volatile', but of course 'futile'. Exceptions which I
cannot explain are 'foss[)i]l' and 'fus[)i]le'.

SUFFIX IN [=A]LI. These adjectives shorten the -a and, with the usual exceptions, the preceding
vowels, as 'dóctrinal', 'fílial', 'líberal', 'márital', 'medícinal', but of course by the 'alias'
rule 'arb[=o]real' (not a classical word in Latin) and 'g[=e]nial'. Words like 'national' and
'rational' were treated like trisyllables, which they now are. The stress is on the antepenultima
except when heavy consonants bring it on to the penultima, as in 'sepulcral', 'parental', 'triumphal'.

Those who say 'doctrínal' on the ground that the second vowel is long in Latin commit themselves
to 'medicínal', 'natúral', 'nutríment', 'instrúment', and, if their own principle be applied,
they make false quantities by the dozen every day of their lives.

Three words mostly mispronounced are, from their rarity, perhaps not past rescue. They are
'décanal', 'ruridécanal', and 'prébendal'. There is no more reason for saying 'decánal' than
for saying 'matrónal' or for saying 'prebéndal' than for saying 'caléndar'. Of course words
like 'tremendous', being imported whole, keep the original stress. In our case the Latin words
came into existence as décanális, prébendális, parallel with náturális, which gives us 'nátural'.
That mostly wrong-headed man, Burgon of Chichester, was correct in speaking of his rights or
at any rate his claims as 'décanal'.

STEMS IN -LO. Of these 'stimulus' and 'villa' have been borrowed whole, while umbella is corrupted
into 'umbrella'. Disyllables lengthen the penultima, as 'stable', 'title', 'pupil'. Under French
influence 'disciple' follows their example. In longer words the usual shortenings are made,
as in 'frivolous', 'ridiculous'. The older words in -ulo change the suffix into -le, as 'uncle',
'maniple', 'tabernacle', 'conventicle', 'receptacle', 'panicle'. Later words retain the u,
as 'vestibule', 'reticule', 'molecule'.

STEMS IN -NO. The many words of this class are a grief to the classifier, who seeks in vain
for reasons. Thus 'german' and 'germane' have the same source and travelled, it seems, by the
same road through France. The Latin hyacinth[)i]nus and adamant[)i]nus are parallel words,
yet Milton has 'hyacinthin' for the one and 'adamantine' for the other. One classification
goes a little way. Thus 'human' and 'urban' must have come through French, 'humane' and 'urbane'
direct from Latin. On the other hand while 'meridian' and 'quartan' are French, 'publican',
'veteran', and 'oppidan' are Latin. Words with a long i, if they came early through France,
shorten the vowel, as 'doctrine', 'discipline', 'medicine', and 'masculine', while 'genuine',
though a later word, followed them, but 'anserine' and 'leonine' did not. Disyllables seem
to prefer the stress on the ultima, as 'divine', 'supine', but even these are not consistent.
Some critics would scan Cassio's words

  The dívine Desdemona,

though Shakespeare nowhere else has this stress, while Shelley has. Shelley, too, has

  She cannot know how well the súpine slaves
  Of blind authority read the truth of things.

The grammatical term, too, is 'súpine'. Later introductions also have this stress, as 'bóvine',
'cánine', 'équine'. The last word is not always understood. At any rate Halliwell-Phillips,
referring to a well-known story of Shakespeare's youth, says that the poet probably attended
the theatre 'in some equine capacity'. As it is agreed that 'bovine' and 'equine' lengthen
the former vowel, we ought by analogy to say 'c[=a]nine', as probably most people do. Words
of more than two syllables have the stress on the antepenultima and the vowel is short, as
in 'libertine', 'adulterine', but of course '[=u]terine'. When heavy consonants bring the stress
on to the penultima, the i is shortened, as in 'clandest[)i]n(e)', 'intest[)i]n(e)', and so
in like disyllables, as 'doctr[)i]n(e)'. The modern words 'morphin(e)' and 'strychnin(e)',
coined, the one from Morpheus and the other from the Greek name of the plant known to botanists
as Withania somnifera, correctly follow 'doctrine' in shortening the i, though another pronunciation
is sometimes heard.

STEMS IN -TUDIN. These shorten the antepenultima, as 'plenitude', 'solitude', with the usual
exceptions, such as 'fortitude'.

STEMS IN -TION. These words retain the suffix, which in early days was disyllabic, as it sometimes
is in Shakespeare, for instance in Portia's

  Before a friend of this descriptión
  Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.

Thus they came under the 'alias' rule, and what is now the penultimate vowel is long unless
it be i. Examples are 'nation', 'accretion', 'emotion', 'solution', while i is shortened in
'petition', 'munition', and the like, and left short in 'admonition' and others. In military
use an exception is made by 'ration', but the pronunciation is confined to one sense of the
word, and is new at that. I remember old soldiers of George III who spoke of 'r[=a]tions'.
Perhaps the ugly change is due to French influence.

Originally the adjectives from these words must have lengthened the fourth vowel from the end
long, as n[=a]t[)i][)o]nal, but when ti became sh they came to follow the rule of Latin trisyllables
in our pronunciation.

STEMS IN -IC. Of these words we have a good many, both Latin and Greek. Those that came direct
keep the stress on the vowel which was antepenultimate and is in English penultimate, and this
vowel is short whatever its original quantity. Examples are 'aquatic', 'italic', 'Germanic'.
Words that came through French threw the stress back, as 'lúnatic'. Skeat says that 'fanatic'
came through French, but he can hardly be right, for the pronunciation 'fánatic' is barely
three score years old. There is no inverted stress in Milton's

  Fanátic Egypt and her priests.

As for 'unique' it is a modern borrowing from French, and of late 'ántique' or 'ántic', as
Shakespeare has it, has followed in one of its senses the French use. It is a pity in face
of Milton's

  With mask and ántique Pageantry,

and it obscures the etymological identity of 'antique' and 'antic', but the old pronunciation
is irredeemable. At least the new avoids the homophonic inconvenience.

Greek words of this class used as adjectives mostly follow the same rule, as 'sporadic', 'dynamic',
'pneumatic', 'esoteric', 'philanthropic', 'emetic', 'panegyric'. As nouns the earlier introductions
threw the stress back, as 'heretic', 'arithmetic', but later words follow the adjectives, as
'emetic', 'enclitic', 'panegyric'. As for 'politic', which is stressed as we stress both by
Shakespeare and by Milton, it must be under French influence, though Skeat seems to think that
it came straight from Latin.

STEMS IN -OS. These words agree in being disyllabic, but otherwise they are a tiresome and
quarrelsome people. For their diversity in spelling some can make a defence, since 'horror',
'pallor', 'stupor' came straight from Latin, but 'tenor', coming through French, should have
joined hands with 'colour', 'honour', 'odour'. The short vowel is inevitable in 'horror' and
'pallor', the long in 'ardour', 'stupor', 'tumour'. The rest are at war, 'clamour', 'colour',
'honour', 'dolour', 'rigour', 'squalor', 'tenor', 'vigour' in the short legion, 'favour', 'labour',
'odour', 'vapour' in the long. Their camp-followers ending in -ous are under their discipline,
so that, while 'cl[)a]morous', 'r[)i]gorous', 'v[)i]gorous' agree with the general rule, '[=o]dorous'
makes an exception to it. All the derivatives of favor are exceptions to the general rule,
for 'favourite' and 'favorable' keep its long a. Of course 'l[)a]b[=o]rious' is quite in order,
and so is 'v[)a]pid'.

STEMS IN -TOR AND -SOR. These words, when they came through French, threw the stress back and
shortened the penultimate, [=o]r[=a]torem becoming orateur, and then '[)o]r[)a]tor', with the
stress on the antepenultimate. Others of the same type are 'auditor', 'competitor', 'senator',
and Shelley has

  The sister-pest, congrégator of slaves,

while 'amateur' is borrowed whole from French and stresses its ultima. Trisyllables of course
shorten the first vowel, as 'cr[)e]ditor', 'j[)a]nitor'. Polysyllables follow the stress of
the verbs; thus 'ágitate' gives 'ágitator' and 'compóse' gives 'compósitor'. To the first class
belongs 'circulator', 'educator', 'imitator', 'moderator', 'negotiator', 'prevaricator', with
which 'gladiator' associates itself; to the second belongs 'competitor'. Words which came straight
from Latin keep the stress of the Latin nominative, as 'creator', 'spectator', 'testator',
'coadjutor', 'assessor', to which in Walton's honour must be added 'Piscator' and 'Venator'.
On 'curator' he who decides does so at his peril. On one occasion Eldon from the Bench corrected
Erskine for saying 'cúr[)a]tor'. 'Cur[=a]tor, Mr. Erskine, cur[=a]tor.' 'I am glad', was the
reply, 'to be set right by so eminent a sen[=a]tor and so eloquent an or[=a]tor as your Lordship.'
Neither eminent lawyer knew much about it, but each was so far right that he stuck to the custom
of his country. On other grounds Erskine might be thought to have committed himself to 'tést[)a]tor',
if not quite to the 'testy tricks' of Sally in Mrs. Gaskell's 'Ruth'.

STEMS IN -ERO AND -URO. Adjectives of this type keep the Latin stress, which thus falls on
the ultima, and shorten or obscure the penultimate vowel, as 'mature', 'obscure', 'severe',
'sincere', but of course '[=a]ustere'. Of like form though of other origin is 'secure'. Nouns
take an early stress, as 'áperture', 'sépulture', 'líterature', 'témperature', unless two mutes
obstruct, as in 'conjécture'. Of the disyllables 'nature' keeps a long penultima, while 'figure'
has it short, not because of the Latin quantity, but because of the French.

The lonely word 'mediocre' lengthens its first vowel by the 'alias' rule and also stresses
it. Whether the penultima has more than a secondary stress is a matter of dispute.

STEMS IN -ARI. These words have the stress on the antepenultima, which they shorten, as in
'secular' or keep short as in 'jocular', 'familiar', but of course 'pec[=u]liar'.

ON CERTAIN GREEK WORDS.

It will have been seen that Greek words are usually treated as Latin. Thus 'crisis' lengthens
the penultima under the 'apex' rule, while 'critical' has it short under the general rule of
polysyllables. Other examples of lengthening are 'bathos', 'pathos', while the long quantity
is of course kept in 'colon' and 'crasis'. For the 'alias' rule we may quote '[=a]theist',
'cryptog[=a]mia', 'h[=o]meopathy', 'heterog[=e]neous', 'pandem[=o]nium', while the normal shortenings
are found in 'an[)o]nymous', 'eph[)e]meral', 'pand[)e]monium', '[)e]r[)e]mite'. Ignorance of
English usage has made some editors flounder on a line of Pope's:

  Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.

The birthplace of Aristotle was of course Stag[=i]ra or, as it is now fashionable to transcribe
it, Stageira, as Pope doubtless knew, but the editors who accuse him of a false quantity in
Greek are on the contrary themselves guilty of one in English. The penultima in English is
short whether it was long or, as in 'dynamite' and 'malachite', short in Greek.

There is, however, one distinct class of Greek words in which the Latin rule is not followed.
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there were scholars who rightly or wrongly treated
the Greek accent as a mark of stress. It is clear that this habit led to an inability to maintain
a long quantity in an unstressed syllable. Shakespeare must have learnt his little Greek from
a scholar who had this habit, for he writes 'Andrón[)i]cus' and also

  I am misánthr[)o]pos and hate mankind.

Of course all scholars shortened the first vowel of the word, and doubtless Shakespeare shortened
also the third. Busby also thus spoke Greek with the result that Dryden in later life sometimes
wrote epsilon instead of eta and also spoke of 'Cleoménes' and 'Iphig[=e]n[)i]a'. As a boy
at Westminster he wrote

  Learn'd, Vertuous, Pious, Great, and have by this
  An universal Metempsuchosis.

Macaulay with an ignorance very unusual in him rebuked his nephew for saying 'metamórph[)o]sis',
and Dr. Johnson, had he been living, would have rebuked Macaulay. For the sake of our poets
we ought to save 'apothé[)o]sis', which is in some danger. Garth may perhaps be forgotten,

  Allots the prince of his celestial line
  An Apotheosis and rights divine,

but 'Rejected Addresses' should still carry weight. In the burlesque couplet, ascribed in the
first edition to the younger Colman and afterwards transferred to Theodore Hook, we have

  That John and Mrs. Bull from ale and tea-houses
  May shout huzza for Punch's apotheosis.

It need hardly be said that 'tea-houses' like 'grandfathers' has the stress on the antepenultimate.

There are other words of Greek origin which now break the rules, though I believe the infringement
to be quite modern. First we have the class beginning with proto. It can hardly be doubted
that our ancestors followed rule and said 'pr[)o]tocol', and 'pr[)o]totype', and I suspect
also 'pr[)o]tomartyr'. There seems, however, to be a general agreement nowadays to keep the
Greek omega. As for 'protagonist' the word is so technical and is often so ludicrously misunderstood
that writers on the Greek drama would do well to retain the Greek termination and say 'protagonistes';
for 'protagonist' is very commonly mistaken and used for the opposite of 'antagonist'.

Next come words beginning with hypo or hyph. In a disyllable the vowel is long by the 'apex'
rule, as in 'hyphen'. In longer words it should be short. So once it was, and we still say
'hypocaust', 'hypocrit', 'hypochondria' (whence 'hypped'), 'hypothesis', and others, but a
large group of technical and scientific words seems determined to have a long y. It looks as
though there were a belief that y is naturally long, though the French influence which gives
us 't[=y]rant' does not extend to 'tyranny'. I do not know what Mr. Hardy calls his poem, but
I hope he follows the old use and calls it 'The D[)y]nasts'. It might be thought that 'd[)y]nasty'
was safe, but it is not. Some modern words like 'dynamite' have been misused from their birth.

Another class begins with hydro- from the Greek word for water. None of them seem to be very
old, but probably 'hydraulic' began life with a short y. Surely Mrs. Malaprop, when she meant
'hysterics' and said 'hydrostatics', must have used the short y. Of course 'hydra' which comes
from the same root follows the 'apex' rule.

Words beginning with hyper- seem nowadays always to have a long y except that one sometimes
hears 'h[)y]perbole' and 'h[)y]perbolical'. Of course both in hypo- and in hyper- the vowel
is short in Greek, so that here at least the strange lengthening cannot be ascribed to the
Grecians. The false theory of a long y has not affected 'cynic' or 'cynical', while 'Cyril'
has been saved by being a Christian name. We may yet hope to retain y short in 'cylinder',
'cynosure', 'lycanthropy', 'mythology', 'pyramid', 'pyrotechnic', 'sycamore', 'synonym', 'typical'.
As for 'h[=y]brid' it seems as much a caprice as '[=a]crid', a pronunciation often heard. Though
'acrid' is a false formation it ought to follow 'vivid' and 'florid'. The 'alias' rule enforces
a long y in 'hygiene' and 'hygienic'.

On the matter of Greek names the lettern and the pulpit are grievous offenders. Once it was
not so. The clergymen of the old type and the scholars of the Oxford Retrogression said T[)i]m[=o]th[)e][)u]s,
because they had a sense of English and followed, consciously or unconsciously, the 'alias'
rule. If there was ever an error, it was on the lips of some illiterate literate who made three
syllables of the word. Now it seems fashionable to say T[=i]m[)o]th[)e][)u]s. The literate
was better than this, for he at least had no theory, and frank ignorance is to be forgiven.
It is no shame to a man not to know that the second i in 'Villiers' is as mute as that in 'Parliament'
or that Bolingbroke's name began with Bull and ended with brook, but when ignorance constructs
a theory it is quite another matter. The etymological theory of pronunciation is intolerable.
Etymology was a charming nymph even when men had but a distant acquaintance with her, and a
nearer view adds to her graces; but when she is dragged reluctant from her element she flops
like a stranded mermaid. The curate says 'Deuteronómy', and on his theory ought to say 'económy'
and 'etymológy'. When Robert Gomery--why not give the reverend poetaster his real if less elegant
name--published his once popular work, every one called it 'The Omnípresence of the Deïty',
and Shelley had already written

  And, as I look'd, the bright omnípresence
  Of morning through the orient cavern flowed.

It is true that Ken a century earlier had committed himself to

  Thou while below wert yet on high
  By Omniprésent Deity,

and later Coleridge, perhaps characteristically, had sinned with

  There is one Mind, one omniprésent Mind,

but neither the bishop nor the poet would have said 'omniscíence', or 'omnipótence'.

Another word to show signs of etymological corruption is '[)e]volution'. It seems to have been
introduced as a technical term of the art of war, and of course, like 'd[)e]volution', shortened
the e. The biologists first borrowed it and later seem desirous of corrupting it. Perhaps they
think of such words as '[=e]gress', but the long vowel is right in the stressed penultimate.

One natural tendency in English runs strongly against etymology. This is the tendency to throw
the stress back, which about a century ago turned 'contémplate' into 'cóntemplate' and somewhat
later 'illústrate' into 'íllustrate'. Shakespeare and Milton pronounced 'instinct' as we pronounce
'distinct' and 'aspect' as we pronounce 'respect'. Thus Belarius is made to say

            'Tis wonder
  That an invisible instínct should frame them
  To royalty unlearn'd,

and Milton has

  By this new felt attraction and instinct,

and also

  In battailous aspéct and neerer view.

The retrogression of the stress is in these instances well established, and we cannot quarrel
with it; but against some very recent instances a protest may be made. One seems to be a corruption
of the War. In 1884 the N.E.D. recognized no pronunciation of it save 'allý', as in Romeo's

  This gentleman, the prince's neer Alie.

The late Mr. B.B. Rogers in his translations of Aristophanes has of course no other pronunciation.
His verses are too good to be spoiled by what began as a vulgarism. Another equally recent
vulgarism, not recognized by the N.E.D. and bad enough to make George Russell turn in his grave,
is 'mágazine' for 'magazíne'. It is not yet common, but such vulgarisms are apt to climb.

In times not quite so recent the word 'prophecy' has changed, not indeed its stress, but the
quantity of its final vowel. When Alford wrote 'The Queen's English', every one lengthened
the last vowel, as in the verb, nor do I remember any other pronunciation in my boyhood. Now
the N.E.D. gives the short vowel only. Alford to his own satisfaction accounted for the long
vowel by the diphthong ei of the Greek. It is to be feared that his explanation would involve
'dynast[=y]' and 'polic[=y]', even if it did not oblige us to turn 'Pompey' into 'Pomp[=y]'.
In this case it may be suspected that the noun was assimilated to the verb, which follows the
analogy of 'magnify' and 'multiply'. The voice of the people which now gives us 'prophec[)y]'
seems here to have felt the power of analogy and assuredly will prevail.

ON PROPER NAMES.

It is to be hoped that except in reading Latin and Greek texts we shall keep to the traditional
pronunciation of proper names as it is enshrined in our poetry and other literature. We must
continue to lengthen the stressed penultimate vowel in Athos, Cato, Draco, Eros, Hebrus, Lichas,
Nero, Otho, Plato, Pylos, Remus, Samos, Titus, Venus, and the many other disyllables wherein
it was short in the ancient tongues. On the other hand we shall shorten the originally long
stressed antepenultimate vowel in Brasidas, Euripides, Icarus, Lavinia, Lucilius, Lydia, Nicias,
Onesimus, Pegasus, Pyramus, Regulus, Romulus, Scipio, Sisyphus, Socrates, Thucydides, and many
more.

Quin, and the actors of his day, used to give to the first vowel in 'Cato' the sound of the
a in 'father'. They probably thought that they were Italianizing such names. In fact their
use was neither Latin nor English. They were like the men of to-day who speak of the town opposite
Dover as 'Cally', a name neither French nor English. A town which once sent members to the
English Parliament has a right to an English name. Prior rhymed it with 'Alice' and Browning has

  When Fortune's malice
  Lost her Calais.

Shakespeare, of course, spelt it 'Callis', and this form, which was first evicted by Pope,
whom other editors servilely followed, ought to be restored to Shakespeare's text. In the pronunciation
of Cato the stage regained the English diphthong in the mouth of Garrick, whose good sense
was often in evidence. It is recorded that his example was not at once followed in Scotland
or Ireland. If there was any Highlander on the stage it may be hoped that he gave to the vowel
the true Latin sound as it appears in 'Mactavish'.

A once well-known schoolmaster, a correspondent of Conington's, had a daughter born to him
whom in his unregenerate days he christened Rosa. At a later time he became a purist in quantities,
and then he shortened the o and took the voice out of the s and spoke of her and to her as
Rossa. The mother and the sisters refused to acknowledge what they regarded as a touch of shamrock
and clung persistently to the English flower. The good gentleman did not call his son Sol[=o]mon,[2]
though this is the form which ought to be used by those who turn the traditional English 'Elk[)a]nah'
into 'Elk[=a]nah', 'Ab[)a]na' into 'Ab[=a]na', and 'Zeb[)u]lun' into 'Zeb[=u]lun'. If they
do not know

  Poor Elk[)a]nah, all other troubles past,
  For bread in Smithfield dragons hiss'd at last,

yet at least they ought to know

  Of Abb[)a]na and Pharphar, lucid streams.

The malison of Milton on their heads! If the translators of the Bible had foreseen 'Zeb[=u]lun',
they would have chosen some other word than 'princes' to avoid the cacophony of 'the princes
of Zeb[=u]lun'.

[Footnote 2: But pedantry would not suggest this. The New Testament has [Greek: Solomôn], and
the Latin Christian poets have the o short. True, the Vatican Septuagint has [Greek: Salômôn],
but there the vowel of the first syllable is a.--H.B.]

That these usages were familiar is evident from the pronunciation of proper, especially Biblical,
names. Thus 'B[=a]bel' and 'B[)a]bylon', 'N[=i]nus' and 'N[)i]neveh', were spoken as unconsciously
as M[=i]chael' and 'M[)i]chaelmas'. Nobody thought of asking the quantity of the Hebrew vowels
before he spoke of 'C[=a]leb' and 'B[=a]rak', of 'G[)i]deon' and 'G[)i]lead', of 'D[)e]borah'
and 'Ab[)i]melech', of '[=E]phraim' and 'B[=e]lial'. The seeming exceptions can be explained.
Thus the priest said 'H[)e]rod' because in the Vulgate he read 'H[)e]rodes', but there was
no Greek or Latin form to make him say anything else than 'M[=e]roz', 'P[=e]rez', 'S[=e]rah',
'T[=e]resh'. He said '[)A]dam' because, although the Septuagint and other books retained the
bare form of the name, there were other writings in which the name was extended by a Latin
termination. There was no like extension to tempt him to say anything but 'C[=a]desh', '[=E]dom',
'J[=a]don', 'N[=a]dab'. I must admit my inability to explain 'Th[)o]mas', but doubtless there
is a reason. The abbreviated form was of course first 'Th[)o]m' and then 'T[)o]m'. Possibly
the pet name has claimed dominion over the classical form. As in the herba impia of the early
botanists, these young shoots sometimes refuse to be 'trash'd for overtopping'.

A story is told of an eccentric Essex rector. He was reading in church the fourth chapter of
Judges, and after 'Now D[)e]borah, a prophetess', suddenly stopped, not much to the astonishment
of the rustics, for they knew his ways. Then he went on 'Deb[)o]rah? Deb[)o]rah? Deb[=o]rah!
Now Deb[=o]rah, a prophetess', and so on. Probably a freak of memory had reminded him that
the letter was omega in the Septuagint. It will be remembered that Miss Jenkyns in Cranford
liked her sister to call her Deb[=o]rah, 'her father having once said that the Hebrew name
ought to be so pronounced', and it will not be forgotten that the good rector was too sound
a scholar to read 'Deb[=o]rah' at the lettern.

An anecdote of Burgon's is to the point. He had preached in St. Mary's what he regarded as
an epoch-making sermon, and afterwards he walked home to Oriel with Hawkins, the famous Provost.
He looked for comment and hoped for praise, but the Provost's only remark was, 'Why do you
say Emm[=a]us?' 'I don't know; isn't it Emm[=a]us?' 'No, no; Emm[)a]us, Emm[)a]us.' When Hawkins
was young, in the days of George III, every one said Emmaus, and in such matters he would say,
'I will have no innovations in my time.' On the King's lips the phrase, as referring to politics,
was foolish, but Hawkins used it with sense.

PS.--I had meant to cite an anecdote of Johnson.

ADDENDA TO HOMOPHONES IN TRACT II

Several correspondents complain of the incompleteness of the list of Homophones in Tract II.
The object of that list was to convince readers of the magnitude of the mischief, and the consequent
necessity for preserving niceties of pronunciation: evidence of its incompleteness must strengthen
its plea. The following words may be added; they are set here in the order of the literary
alphabet.

    [^4] barking of dog, and 'at bay',
    [^5] a dam, [^6] of antler, [^7] a colour.

  blaze, [^1] of flame, [^2] to sound forth.

THE SKILFUL LEECH

The Poet Laureate has pointed out that several useful words have been lost to the English language
because their identity in sound with other words renders it impossible to use them without
the risk either of being misunderstood or of calling up undesirable associations. It is owing
to this cause that English--or, at least, the English of Great Britain--has no word that can
correctly be used as a general designation for a member of the healing profession. In America,
I believe, the word is 'physician'; but in England that appellation belongs to one branch of
the profession exclusively. The most usual term here is 'doctor'; but the M.D. rightly objects
to the application of this title to his professional brother who has no degree; and in a university
town to say that John Smith is a doctor would be inconveniently ambiguous. 'Medical man' is
cumbrous, and has the further disadvantage (in these days) of not being of common gender. Now
the lack of any proper word for a meaning so constantly needing to be expressed is certainly
a serious defect in modern (insular) English. The Americans have some right to crow over us
here; but their 'physician' is a long word; and though it has been good English in the sense
of medicus for six hundred years, it ought by etymology to mean what physicien does in French,
and physicist in modern English. Our ancestors were better off in this respect than either
we or the Americans. The only native word to denote a practiser of the healing art is leech,
which is better than the foreign 'physician' because it is shorter. It was once a term of high
dignity: Chaucer could apply it figuratively to God, as the healer of souls; and even in the
sixteenth century a poet could address his lady as 'My sorowes leech'. Why can we not so use
it now? Why do we not speak of 'The Royal College of Leeches'? Obviously, because a word of
the same form happens to be the name of an ugly little animal of disgusting habits. If I were
to introduce my medical attendant to a friend with the words 'This is my leech', the gentleman
(or lady) so presented would think I was indulging in the same sort of pleasantry as is used
when a coachman is called a 'whip'; and he (or she) would probably not consider the joke to
be in the best of taste. Of course all educated people know that it was once not unusual to
speak of a man of medicine as a 'leech'; but probably there are many who imagine that this
designation was a disparaging allusion to the man's tool of trade, and that it could be applied
only to inferior members of the profession. The ancient appellation of the healer is so far
obsolete that if I were to answer a question as to a man's profession with the words 'Oh, he
is a leech', there would be some risk of being misunderstood to mean that he was a money-lender.

Etymologists generally have regarded the name of the bloodsucking animal as the same word with
leech a physician, the assumption being that the animal received its name from its use as a
remedial agent. But the early forms, both in English and Low German, show that the words are
originally unconnected. The English for medicus was in the tenth century l['æ]ce or léce, and
in the thirteenth century leche; the word for sanguisuga was in the tenth century lyce, and
in the thirteenth century liche. According to phonetic law the latter word should have become
litch in modern English; but it very early underwent a punning alteration which made it homophonous
with the ancient word for physician. The unfortunate consequence is that the English language
has hopelessly lost a valuable word, for which it has never been able to find a satisfactory
substitute.

H.B.

DIFFERENTIATION OF HOMOPHONES

On this very difficult question the attitude of a careful English speaker is shown in the following
extract from a letter addressed to us:

METAL, METTLE: AND PRINCIPAL, PRINCIPLE

'I find that I do not naturally distinguish metal and mettle in pronunciation, tho' when there
is any danger of ambiguity I say metal for the former and met'l for the latter; and I should
probably do so (without thinking about it) in a public speech. In my young days the people
about me usually pronounced met'l for both. Theoretically I think the distinction is a desirable
one to make; the fact that the words are etymologically identical seems to me irrelevant. The
words are distinctly two in modern use: when we talk of mettle (meaning spiritedness) there
is in our mind no thought whatever of the etymological sense of the word, and the recollection
of it, if it occurred, would only be disturbing. So I intend in future to pronounce metal as
met[e]l (when I don't forget). And I am not sure that met[e]l is, strictly speaking, a "spelling-pronunciation":
It is possible that the difference in spelling originated in a difference of pronunciation,
not the other way about. For metal in its literal sense was originally a scientific word, and
in that sense may have been pronounced carefully by people who would pronounce it carelessly
when they used it in a colloquial transferred sense approaching to slang.

'The question of principal and principle is different. When I was young, educated people in
my circle always, I believe, distinguished them; so to this day when I hear principal pronounced
as principle it gives me a squirm, tho' I am afraid nearly everybody does it now. That the
words are etymologically distinct does not greatly matter; it is of more importance that I
have sometimes been puzzled to know which word a speaker meant; if I remember right, I once
had to ask.

'It would be worth while to distinguish flower and flour (which originally, like metal and
mettle, were the same word); yet in practice it is not easy to make the difference audible.
The homophony is sometimes inconvenient.'

CORRECTION TO TRACT II

On p. 37 of TRACT II the words 'the Anglo-prussian society which Mr. Jones represents' have
given offence and appear to be inaccurate. The German title of the series in which Jones's
Dictionary is one has the following arrangement of words facing the English title:

HERAUSGEGEBEN

UND

DER "ASSOCIATION PHONÉTIQUE INTERNATIONALE" GEWIDMET

VON

H. MICHAELIS,

and this misled me. I am assured that, though the dictionary may be rightly described as Anglo-Prussian,
the Phonetic Association is Gallo-Scandinavian. In behalf of the S.P.E. I apologize to the
A. Ph. I. for my mistake which has led one of its eminent associates to accuse me of bearing
illwill towards the Germans. The logic of that reproach baffles me utterly.

[R.B.]

SOME LEXICAL MATTERS

FAST = QUICK OR FIRM

'An Old Cricketer' writes:

'After reading your remarks on the ambiguity of the word fast (Tract III, p. 12) I read in
the report of a Lancashire cricket match that Makepeace was the only batsman who was fast-footed.
But for the context and my knowledge of the game I should have concluded that Makepeace kept
his feet immovably on the crease; but the very opposite was intended. At school we used to
translate [Greek: podas ôkus Achilleus] "swift-footed Achilles", and I took that to mean that
Achilles was a sprinter. I suppose quick-footed would be the epithet for Makepeace.'

SPRINTER is a good word, though Sprinting Achilles could not be recommended.

BRATTLE

A correspondent from Newcastle writes advocating the recognition of the word brattle as descriptive
of thunder. It is a good old echo-word used by Dunbar and Douglas and Burns and by modern English
writers. It is familiar through the first stanza of Burns's poem 'To a Mouse'. The N.E.D. explains
this as 'to run with brattling feet, to scamper'.

It is possible that brattle has fallen into disuse through too indiscriminate application.
After Burns's famous poem the word can establish itself only in the sense of a scurrying dry
noise: it is too small for thunder.

We would call attention to the principle involved in this judgement, for it is one of the main
objects of our society to assist and guide Englishmen in the use of their language by fully
exposing the facts that should determine their practice. Every word has its history, and no
word can prosper in the speech or writing of those who do not respect its inherited and unalterable
associations; these cannot be got rid of by ignoring them. Littré in the preface to his dictionary
claims for it this pre-eminent quality of usefulness, that it will enable his countrymen to
speak and write good French by acquainting them with historic tradition, and he says that it
was enthusiasm for this one purpose that sustained him in his great work. Its object was to
harmonize the present use of the language with the past usage, in order that the present usage
may possess all the fullness, richness, and certitude which it can have, and which naturally
belong to it. His words are: 'Avant tout, et pour ramener à une idée mère ce qui va être expliqué
dans la Préface, je dirai, définissant ce dictionnaire, qu'il embrasse et combine l'usage présent
de la langue et son usage passé, afin de donner à l'usage présent toute la plénitude et la
sûreté qu'il comporte.'

It is the intention of our society to offer only expert and well-considered opinion on these
literary matters, which are often popularly handled in the newspapers and journals as fit subjects
for private taste and uninformed prejudice: and since the Oxford Dictionary has done more fully
for English what Littré did for French, our task is comparatively easy. But experts cannot
be expected, all of them, to have the self-denying zeal of Émile Littré, and the worth of our
tracts will probably improve with the increase of our subscribers.

BICKER

As Burns happens to use bickering as his epithet for the mouse's brattle, we may take this
word as another illustration of Littré's principle. The N.E.D. gives the original meaning as
skirmish, and quotes Shakespeare,

  If I longer stay
  We shall begin our ancient bickerings,

which a man transposing the third and fourth words might say to-day without rising above colloquial
speech; but there is another allied signification which Milton has in

  Smoak and bickering flame;

and this is followed by many later writers. It would seem therefore, if the word is to have
a special sense, that it must be focused in the idea of something that both wavers and skirmishes,
and this suggests another word which caught our eye in the dictionary, that is

BRANGLE

It is defined in the N.E.D. as 'a brawl, wrangle, squabble' and marked obsolete. It seems to
differ from its numerous synonyms by the suggestion of what we call a muddle: that is an active
wrangling which has become inextricably confused.

SURVIVALS IN LANCASHIRE SPEECH

Mr. Ernest Stenhouse sends us notes on Tract II, from which we extract the following:

'Poll (= to cut the hair) is still familiar in Lancashire. Tickle (unstable) is obsolescent
but not yet obsolete. As a child I often heard meterly (= moderately): e.g. meterly fausse
(? false) = moderately cunning. It may still be in use. Bout (= without = A.S. butan) is commonly
heard.

'The words tabulated in Tract II, p. 34, and the following pairs are not homophones in Lancashire:
stork, stalk; pattern, patten; because although the r in stork and pattern is not trilled as
in Scotland, it is distinctly indicated by a modification of the preceding vowel, somewhat
similar to that heard in the [(or]e words (p. 35).

'Homophony may arise from a failure to make distinctions that are recognized in P.S.P. Thus
in Lancashire the diphthong sound in flow, snow, bone, coal, those, &c., is very often pronounced
as a pure vowel (cf. French eau, mot): hence confusion arises between flow and flaw, sow and
saw, coal and call: both these vowel sounds tending to become indistinguishable from the French
eau.'

FEASIBLE

Feasible is a good example of a word which appears in danger of being lost through incorrect
and ignorant use. It can very well happen that a word which is not quite comfortable may feel
its way to a useful place in defiance of etymology; and in such cases it is pedantry to object
to its instinctive vagaries. But feasible is a well-set comfortable word which is being ignorantly
deprived of its useful definite signification. In the following note Mr. Fowler puts its case
clearly, and his quotations, being typically illustrative of the manner in which this sort
of mischief comes about, are worthy of attention.

'With those who feel that the use of an ordinary word for an ordinary notion does not do justice
to their vocabulary or sufficiently exhibit their cultivation, who in fact prefer the stylish
to the working word, feasible is now a prime favourite. Its proper sense is "capable of being
done, accomplished, or carried out". That is, it means the same as possible in one of the latter's
senses, and its true function is to be used instead of possible where that might be ambiguous.
A thunderstorm is possible (but not feasible). Irrigation is possible (or, indifferently, feasible).
A counter-revolution is possible; i.e., (a) one may for all we know happen, or (b) we can if
we choose bring one about; but, if b is the meaning, feasible is better than possible because
it cannot properly bear sense a, and therefore obviates ambiguity.

'The wrong use of feasible is that in which, by a slipshod extension, it is allowed to have
also the other sense of possible, and that of probable. This is described by the highest authority
as "hardly a justifiable sense etymologically, and ... recognized by no dictionary". It is
however becoming very common; in all the following quotations, it will be seen that the natural
word would be either possible or probable, one of which should have been chosen:--Continuing,
Mr. Wood said: "I think it is very feasible that the strike may be brought to an end this week,
and it is a significant coincidence that ...". / Witness said it was quite feasible that if
he had had night binoculars he would have seen the iceberg earlier. / We ourselves believe
that this is the most feasible explanation of the tradition. / This would appear to offer a
feasible explanation of the scaffold puzzle.'

PROTAGONIST

Mr. Sargeaunt (on p. 26) suggests that we might do well to keep the full Greek form of this
word, and speak and write protagonistes. Familiarity with Agonistes in the title of Milton's
drama, where it is correctly used as equivalent to 'mighty champion', would be misleading,
and the rejection of the English form 'protagonist' seems otherwise undesirable. The following
remarks by Mr. Fowler show that popular diction is destroying the word; and if ignorance be
allowed its way we shall have a good word destroyed.

'The word that has so suddenly become a prime favourite with journalists, who more often than
not make it mean champion or advocate or defender, has no right whatever to any of those meanings,
and almost certainly owes them to the mistaking of the first syllable (representing Greek [Greek:
prôtos] "first") for [Greek: pro] "on behalf of"--a mistake made easy by the accidental resemblance
to antagonist. "Accidental", since the Greek [Greek: agônistês] has different meanings in the
two words, in one "combatant", but in the other "play-actor". The Greek [Greek: prôtagônistês]
means the actor who takes the chief part in a play--a sense readily admitting of figurative
application to the most conspicuous personage in any affair. The deuteragonist and tritagonist
take parts of second and third importance, and to talk of several protagonists, or of a chief
protagonist or the like, is an absurdity. In the newspapers it is a rarity to meet protagonist
in a legitimate sense; but two examples of it are put first in the following collection. All
the others are outrages on this learned-sounding word, because some of them distinguish between
chief protagonists and others who are not chief, some state or imply that there are more protagonists
than one in an affair, and the rest use protagonist as a mere synonym for advocate.

'Legitimate uses: The "cher Halévy" who is the protagonist of the amazing dialogue. / Marco
Landi, the protagonist and narrator of a story which is skilfully contrived and excellently
told, is a fairly familiar type of soldier of fortune.

'Absurd uses with chief, &c.: The chief protagonist is a young Nonconformist minister. / Unlike
a number of the leading protagonists in the Home Rule fight, Sir Edward Carson was not in Parliament
when.... / It presents a spiritual conflict, centred about its two chief protagonists, but
shared in by all its characters.

'Absurd plural uses: One of the protagonists of that glorious fight for Parliamentary Reform
in 1866 is still actively among us. / One of these immense protagonists must fall, and, as
we have already foreshadowed, it is the Duke. / By a tragic but rapid process of elimination
most of the protagonists have now been removed. / As on a stage where all the protagonists
of a drama assemble at the end of the last act. / That letter is essential to a true understanding
of the relations of the three great protagonists at this period. / The protagonists in the
drama, which has the motion and structure of a Greek tragedy (Fy! fy!--a Greek tragedy and
protagonists?).

'Confusions with advocate, &c.: The new Warden is a strenuous protagonist of that party in
Convocation. / Mr ----, an enthusiastic protagonist of militant Protestantism. / The chief
protagonist on the company's side in the latest railway strike, Mr ----. / It was a happy thought
that placed in the hands of the son of one of the great protagonists of Evolution the materials
for the biography of another. / But most of the protagonists of this demand have shifted their
ground. / As for what the medium himself or his protagonists may think of them--for etymological
purposes that is neither here nor there.

'Perhaps we need not consider the Greek scholar's feelings; he has many advantages over the
rest of us, and cannot expect that in addition he shall be allowed to forbid us a word that
we find useful. Is it useful? or is it merely a pretentious blundering substitute for words
that are useful? Pro- in protagonist is not the opposite of anti-; -agonist is not the same
as in antagonist; advocate and champion and defender and combatant are better words for the
wrong senses given to protagonist; and protagonist in its right sense of the (not a) chief
actor in an affair has still work to do if it could only be allowed to mind its own business.'

AMERICAN APPRECIATION

We are glad to reprint the following short extracts from the New York Times Book Review and
Magazine, September 26, 1920.

'THE CAMPAIGN FOR PURE ENGLISH

    'Among those who joined it (the S.P.E.) immediately were
    Arthur J. Balfour, A.C. Bradley, Austin Dobson, Thomas Hardy,
    J.W. Mackail, Gilbert Murray, Mrs. Humphry Ward, and Mrs.
    Wharton.... The rallying of these men and women of letters
    was not more significant than the prompt adhesion of the
    Professors of English in the various British Universities:
    W.M. Dixon, Oliver Elton, E.S. Gordon, C.H. Herford, W.P.
    Ker, G.C. Moore-Smith, F.W. Moorman, A. Quiller-Couch, George
    Saintsbury, and H.C.K. Wyld....

    'There is a peril to the proper development of the language in
    offensive affectations, in persistent pedantry, and in other
    results of that comprehensive ignorance of the history of
    English, which we find plentifully revealed in many of our
    grammars. It is high time that men who love the language, who
    can use it deftly and forcibly, and who are acquainted with
    the principles and the processes of its growth, should raise
    the standard of independence....

    'It is encouraging to realize that the atrophy of the
    word-making habit is less obvious in the United States than
    it is in Great Britain.... We cannot but regret that it is
    not now possible to credit to their several inventors American
    compounds of a delightful expressiveness--windjammer,
    loan-shark, scare-head, and that more delectable
    pussy-footed--all of them verbal creations with an
    imaginative quality almost Elizabethan in its felicity, and
    all of them examples of the purest English.... We Americans
    made the compound farm-hand, and employ it in preference to
    the British [English?] agricultural labourer.

    'The attention of the officers of the society may be called
    to the late Professor Lounsbury's lively and enlightening
    History of the English Language, and to Professor George
    Philip Krapp's illuminating study of Modern English.

REPORT

Of the proceedings of the Society for the first year ending Xmas, 1920.

The Society still remains governed by the small committee of its original founders: the support
of the public and the press has been altogether satisfactory: the suggestions and programme
which the committee originally put forward have met with nothing but favourable criticism;
no opposition has been aroused, and we are therefore encouraged to meet the numerous invitations
that we have received from all parts of the English-speaking world to make our activities more
widely known. The sale of the Tracts has been sufficient to pay their expenses; and we are
in this respect very much indebted to the Oxford University Press for its generous co-operation;
for it has enabled us to offer our subscribers good workmanship at a reasonable price. The
publication of this Tract IV closes our first 'year': we regret that the prevalent national
disturbances have extended it beyond the solar period, but the conditions render explanation
and apology needless.

Our list shows 188 members, and their names include many well-known men of letters, Professors
of Literature, Editors, Journalists, and others interested in the history and present condition
of the language. Nineteen members sent donations (above 10s. 6d.) which together amounted to
about £40; and thirty-two sent subscriptions of ten shillings for the supply of one year's
publications.

To these subscribers (whose names are printed in the list below) all the four Tracts for this
year have been sent: and it will appear that since they might have bought the four Tracts for
7s. 6d., they have made a donation of 2s. 6d. apiece to the funds of the Society. This margin
is very useful and we hope that they will renew their 10s. subscription in advance for the
ensuing year. That will ensure their receiving the Society's papers as they are issued, and
it will much assist the machinery of publication. Also Members who have not hitherto subscribed
are now specially invited to do so. They can judge of the Society's work, and can best support
it in this way. The publications of 1921 will be sent as soon as issued to all such subscribers.

Subscriptions may be sent to the Secretary, L. Pearsall Smith, 11 St. Leonard's Terrace, Chelsea,
London, S.W., to whom all communications should be addressed, or they may be paid direct to
'Treasurer of S.P.E.', Barclay's Bank, High Street, Oxford.
