THE GREEK CHURCH; a Sketch. By the Author of "Proposals for Christian Union."

    "Anything written by the Author of 'Proposals for Christian Union' is
    sure to be distinguished by an excellent spirit. The 'Greek Church,' a
    Sketch, is well put together; and, though slight, will be found to
    contain as much real information as many a book of greater size and
    more pretension."--The Guardian.

By the same, now ready, price 4d.

A SUPPLEMENT ON THE DOCTRINE AND DISCIPLINE OF THE GREEK CHURCH.

    "We characterised the interesting little volume entitled 'The Greek
    Church' as historical rather than doctrinal. The title of this
    Supplement shows that it expressly supplies the very material in which
    the original work was deficient."--Notes and Queries.

This Essay and Supplement conclude the Series. The four preceding Essays of Unity on sale.
Second Edition, 1s. each.
