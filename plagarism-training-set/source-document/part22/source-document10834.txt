PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

CHARIVARIA.

A drought is reported from India and Eastern Africa. Considering the amount of water which
has recently escaped from clouds over here it is not surprising to find that they are feeling
the pinch in other countries.

* * *

A correspondent writes to a weekly paper inquiring when Sir ERIC GEDDES was born. We admire
the fellow's restraint in not asking "Why?"

* * *

We understand that one wealthy connoisseur has decided to give up buying Old Masters in order
to save up for the purchase of a railway ticket.

* * *

The Daily Mail points out that Lord NORTHCLIFFE has left England for the Continent. Sir ERIC
GEDDES is said to have remarked that he will catch his lordship coming back.

* * *

A gentleman who is about to travel to a South Coast resort writes to inquire what his position
will be if some future Government reduces the railway fares before he arrives at his destination.

* * *

In view of the increased railway fares there is some talk of starting a Mansion House Fund
to convey Scotsmen home from England before it is too late.

* * *

Of the new railway rates it can be said that those who go farthest will fare worse.

* * *

With reference to the man who was seen laughing in the Strand the other day, it should be pointed
out that he is not an English tax-payer but a Colonial who was catching the boat home next morning.

* * *

A Christmas-card posted at Farnham in December, 1905, has just been delivered at Ivychurch.
The theory is that the postal authorities mistook it for a business communication.

* * *

The monocle is coming into fashion once again, and it is thought that a motorist wearing one
goggle will soon be quite a common sight.

* * *

In view of their unwieldiness and size it is being urged that motor charabancs should be required
to carry a special form of hooter, to be sounded only when there is no room for a vehicle coming
in the other direction to pass. A more elaborate system of signals is also suggested, notably
two short squawks and a long groan, to signify "My pedestrian, I think."

* * *

According to a County Court judge it is the duty of every motorist who knocks down a pedestrian
to go back and ask the man if he is hurt. But surely the victim cannot answer such a question
off-hand without first consulting his solicitor.

* * *

A great pilgrimage of house-hunters has visited the enormous marrow which is growing in an
allotment at Ingatestone, but the strong military guard sent to protect it has succeeded up
to the present in frustrating all attempts to occupy it.

* * *

A motor fire-engine dashed into a draper's shop in the North of London last Tuesday week. We
understand that one of the firemen with great presence of mind justified his action by immediately
setting fire to the building.

* * *

A petrified fish about fifty feet long has been discovered in Utah. This is said to be the
largest sardine and the smallest whale America has ever produced.

* * *

Building operations were interrupted in North London last week, when a couple of sparrows built
a nest on some foundations just where a bricklayer was due to lay a brick the next day.

* * *

Six tourists motoring through the mountainous district of Ardèche Department fell a thousand
feet down a precipice, but escaped without injury. We understand that in spite of many tempting
offers from cinematograph companies the motorists have decided not to repeat the experiment.

SOLVING THE HOLIDAY FARE PROBLEM.

"None but the rich can pay the fare" is as true at this moment as when the words were first penned.

The reference, of course, is to the return fare, for the single fare of tomorrow is hardly
more than we paid without complaint in years gone by for the journey there and back.

How comparatively few people seem to be aware that the solution of the difficulty lies in not
returning. Could anything be simpler?

Nobody wants to return. In preparing for a holiday our thoughts are concentrated on when to
go, where to go and how to get there. Who bothers himself about when to come back, where to
come back from, and how to do it? After all, holiday-making is not to be confused with prize-fighting.

That we have come back in the past has been due as much to custom as to anything. Someone introduced
the silly fashion of returning from holidays, and we have unthinkingly acquired the habit.
Once we shake off this holiday convention the problem of the return fare is solved.

Just stay where you are and all will be well. Sooner or later your friends or your employer
(if your return is really considered desirable) will send a money-order. But that is their
look-out. The point is that the return fare need not trouble you. And you can please yourself
as to what you buy with the money-order.

Why all this outcry then about the cost of travelling in the holiday season?

BADLY SYNGED.

The scene is the morning-room of the Smith-Hybrows' South London residence. It is the day following
the final performance of the Smith-Hybrows' strenuous season of J.M. SYNGE drama, undertaken
with the laudable intention of familiarising the suburb with the real Irish temperament and
the works of the dramatist in question.

Mrs. Smith-Hybrow is seated at the breakfast-table, her head buried behind the coffee urn.
She is opening her letters and "keening" softly as she rocks in her chair.

Mrs. Smith-Hybrow (scanning a letter). Will I be helping them with the sale of work? It's little
enough the like of me will be doing for them the way I was treated at the last Bazaar, when
Mrs. McGupperty and Mrs. Glyn-Jones were after destroying me with the cutting of the sandwiches.
And was I not there for three days, from the rising of the blessed sun to the shining of the
blessed stars, cutting and cutting, and never a soul to bear witness to the destroying labour
of it, and the two legs of me like to give way with the great weariness (keens)? I'll have
no call this year to be giving in to their prayers and beseechings, and I won't care the way
the Curate will be after trying to come round me, with his eyes looking at me the way the moon
kisses the drops of dew on the hedgerows when the road is white.

    [Opens another letter, keening the while in a slightly higher key.
    Enter Gertrude Smith-Hybrow. She crosses to the window and stares
    out.

Gertrude. There are black clouds in the sky, and the wind is breaking in the west and making
a great stir with the trees, and they are hitting one on the other. And there is rain falling,
falling from the clouds, and the roads be wet.

Mrs. S.-H. It is your mackintosh you will be wanting when you are after going to the Stores.
