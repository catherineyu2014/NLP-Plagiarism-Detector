MOUNT ARAFAT, AND THE PILGRIMAGE TO MEKKA.

Every traditionary and topographical particular of this hallowed spot, and the picturesque
ceremonies by which it is consecrated, must be acceptable to the Christian reader; and this
conviction has induced us to abridge the following from that portion of Burckhardt's Travels
which describes the Hadj, or pilgrimage to Mekka.

    [5] At the close of the sixteenth century, according to Kotobeddyn,
        the whole plain of Arafat was cultivated.

SOUTH AMERICAN MANNERS

From the Memoirs of General Miller, Second Edition.

In the Pampas, where a scarcity of food is unknown to the poorest, that calculating avarice
which, in its fears for to-morrow, would look with apathy on the wants of the stranger, can
have but a limited sway. Kind offices are, therefore more freely and disinterestedly conferred
than in less abundant regions. In addition to this, the dearth of society in a thinly-sprinkled
population renders the presence of a traveller on their isolated haciendas a source of gratification.
If his appearance afford no ground for mistrust, and if his manners are not disagreeable, his
being a stranger is a sufficient passport to a kind and hearty welcome. Whether he be rich
or poor is not a subject of inquiry, and makes no difference in the reception.

The South Americans are gay, and fond of dancing, music, and singing. There are few, whether
wealthy or otherwise, who are not proficients in one or other of these accomplishments. In
the warmer latitudes, people carry on not only their usual occupations, but their amusements,
chiefly in the open air; and as singing constitutes one of the principal sources of the latter,
the continued exercise of the voice harmonizes and strengthens it. Perhaps no opera, in Europe,
could afford, to a natural and unsophisticated ear, so rich a treat as that which may be enjoyed
in Cuzco, Arequipa, and other cities, where the ancient Peruvian airs are sung in the rich
and melodious tones of the natives.

The South Americans possess great intellectual quickness, and a retentive memory. The following
may be cited as an extraordinary instance of the latter faculty. An old man, a native of La
Pax, in Upper Peru, and of unmixed Indian blood, who kept an inn at Curicavi, between Valparaiso
and Santiago, could repeat nearly the whole of Robertson's "History of Charles the Fifth,"
and was better acquainted with the History of England than most Englishmen. He spoke of Queen
Boadicea, and was as familiar with the history of the civil wars between the houses of York
and Lancaster as if they had occurred in his country, and in his own times. He had been brought
up by the Jesuits. He had made two voyages to Canton, and was known by the name of "the emperor
of China," in consequence frequently of amusing his guests with long stories about the celestial
empire.

The Peruvians have great natural talents for painting and sculpture. They generally produce
striking likenesses, but being uninstructed in the principles of these arts, their pictures
have no other merit. There is, however, a female figure, done in 1711, by a native of Quito,
which is considered as one of the finest paintings in a very good collection belonging to Mynheer
Vandermarlin, of Brussels.

ORATORIOS.

The first oratorio performed in London, was at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, in 1732. On
June 10, in the same year, the serenata of Acis and Galatea was performed at the Italian Opera
House, in English, by Italian performers, with scenery representing a rural prospect, with
rocks, groves, fountains, and grottoes; amongst which were disposed a chorus of nymphs and
shepherds, with dresses and "every other decoration suited to the subject."--Companion to the
Theatres.
