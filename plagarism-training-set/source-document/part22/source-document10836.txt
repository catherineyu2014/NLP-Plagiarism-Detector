PREFACE

For many years the call for a book on the mother and her child has come to us from patients,
from the public, and now from our publishers--and this volume represents our efforts to supply
this demand.

The larger part of the work was originally written by Dr. Lena K. Sadler, with certain chapters
by Dr. William S. Sadler, but in the revision and re-arrangement of the manuscript so much
work was done by each on the contributions of the other, that it was deemed best to bring the
book out under joint authorship.

The book is divided into three principal parts: Part I, dealing with the experience of pregnancy
from the beginning of expectancy to the convalescence of labor: Part II, dealing with the infant
from its first day of life up to the weaning time; Part III, taking up the problems of the
nursery from the weaning to the important period of adolescence.

The advice given in this work is that which we have tried out by experience--both as parents
and physicians--and we pass it on to mothers, fathers, and nurses with the belief that it will
be of help in their efforts at practical and scientific "child culture." We believe, also,
that the expectant mother will be aided and encouraged in bearing the burdens which are common
to motherhood by the advice and instruction offered.

While we have drawn from our own professional and personal experience in the preparation of
this book, we have also drawn freely from the present-day literature dealing with the subjects
treated, and desire to acknowledge our indebtedness to the various writers and authorities.

We now jointly send forth the volume on its mission, as a contribution toward lightening the
task and inspiring the efforts of those mothers, nurses, and others who honor us by a perusal
of its pages.

CHAPTER I

THE EXPECTANT MOTHER

There can be no grander, more noble, or higher calling for a healthy, sound-minded woman than
to become the mother of children. She may be the colaborer of the business man, the overworked
housewife of the tiller of the soil, the colleague of the professional man, or the wife of
the leisure man of wealth; nevertheless, in every normal woman in every station of life there
lurks the conscious or sub-conscious maternal instinct. Sooner or later the mother-soul yearns
and cries out for the touch of baby fingers, and for that maternal joy that comes to a woman
when she clasps to her breast the precious form of her own babe.

MOTHERHOOD THE HIGHEST CALLING

Motherhood is by far woman's highest and noblest profession. Science, art, and careers dwindle
into insignificance when we attempt to compare them with motherhood. And to attain this high
profession, to reach this manifest "goal of destiny," women are seeking everywhere to obtain
the best information, and the highest instruction regarding "mothercraft," "babyhood," and
"child culture."

In an Indiana town not long ago, at the close of a lecture, a small, intellectual-appearing
mother came forward, and, tenderly placing her tiny and emaciated infant in my arms, said:
"O Doctor! can you help me feed my helpless babe? I'm sure it is going to die. Nothing seems
to help it. My father is the banker in this town. I graduated from high school and he sent
me to Ann Arbor, and there I toiled untiringly for four years and obtained my degree of B.
A. I have gone as far as I could--spent thousands of dollars of my unselfish father's money--but
I find myself totally ignorant of my own child's necessities. I cannot even provide her food.
O Doctor! can't something be done for young women to preparé them for motherhood?"

MOTHERCRAFT PREPARATION

The time will come when our high and normal schools will provide adequate courses for the preparation
of the young woman for her highest profession, motherhood. This young mother, who had reached
the goal of Bachelor of Arts, found to her sorrow that she was entirely deficient in her education
and training regarding the duties and responsibilities of a mother. In every school of the
higher branches of education that train young women in their late teens there should be a chair
of mothercraft, providing practical lectures on baby hygiene, dress, bathing, and the general
care of infants, and giving instruction in the rudiments of simple bottle-feeding, together
with the caloric values of milk, gruels, and other ingredients which enter into the preparation
of a baby's food.

Young women would most enthusiastically enroll for such classes, and as years passed and marriage
came and children to the home, imagine the gratitude that would flood the souls of the young
mothers who were fortunate enough to have attended schools where the chairs of motherhood prepared
them for these new duties and responsibilities.

EARLY MEDICAL SUPERVISION

Just as soon as it is known that a baby is coming into the home, the expectant mother should
engage the best doctor she can afford. She should make frequent calls at his office and intelligently
carry out the instruction concerning water drinking, exercise, diet, etc. Twenty-four hour
specimens of urine should be frequently saved and taken to the physician for examination. In
these days the blood-pressure is closely observed, together with approaching headaches and
other evidences of possible kidney complications. The early recognition of these dangers is
accompanied by the immediate employment of appropriate sweating procedures and other measures
designed to promote the elimination of body poisons. Thus science is able effectively to stay
the progress of the high blood-pressure of former days, and which was so often followed by
eclampsia--uremic poisoning.

In these days of careful urine analysis, expertly administered anaesthetics, and up-to-date
hospital confinements, the average intelligent woman may enter into pregnancy quite free from
the oldtime fears, whose only rewards were grief and cankering care. All fear of childbirth
and all dread of maternal duties and sacrifices do not in the least lessen the necessary unpleasantness
associated with normal labor. It lies in the choice of every expectant mother to journey through
the months of pregnancy with dissatisfaction and resentment or with joy and serenity. "The
child will be born and laid in your arms to be fed, cared for, and reared, whether you weep
or smile through the months of waiting."

THE RESENTFUL MOTHER

A little woman came into our office the day of this writing, saying: "Doctor, I'm just as mad
as I can be; I don't want to be pregnant, I just hate the idea." As I smiled upon this girl-wife
of nineteen, I drew from my desk a sheet of paper and slowly wrote down these words for the
head of a column: "Got a mad on," and for the head of another, "Got a glad on;" and then we
quickly set to work carefully to tabulate all the results that having a "mad on" would bring.
We found to her dismay that its harvest would be sadness of the heart, husband unhappy, work
unbearable, while all church duties as well as social functions would be sadly marred. Then,
just as carefully, we tabulated the benefits that would follow having a "glad on." Her face
broke into a smile; she laughed, and as she left the office she assured me that she would accept
Nature's decree, make the best of her lot, and thus wisely align herself with the normal life
demands of old Mother Nature. This view of her experience, she came to see, would bring the
greatest amount of happiness to both herself and husband. She left me, declaring that she was
just "wild for a baby;" and there is still echoing in my ears her parting words: "I'm leaving
you, Oh, such a happy girl! and I'm going home to Harold a happy and contented expectant mother."

There often enters on the exit of a discontented and resentful expectant mother, a woman, very
much alone in the world--perhaps a bachelor maid or a barren wife, who, as she sits in the
office, bitterly weeps and wails over her state of loneliness or sterility; and so we are led
to realize that discontentment is the lot of many women; and we are sometimes led to regret
that ours is not the power to take from her that hath and give to her that hath not.

EARLY SIGNS OF PREGNANCY

Among the first questions an expectant mother asks is: "What are early signs of pregnancy?"
The answer briefly is:

  1. Cessation of menstruation.
  2. Changes in the breast.
  3. Morning sickness.
  4. Disturbances in urination.

Menstruation may be interrupted by other causes than pregnancy, but the missing of the second
or third periods usually indicates pregnancy. Accompanying the cessation of menstruation, changes
in the breast occur. Sensation in the breasts akin to those which usually accompany menstruation
are manifested at this time in connection with the unusual sensations of stinging, prickling,
etc. Fully one-half of our patients do not suffer with "morning sickness;" however, it is the
general consensus of opinion that "morning sickness" is one of the early signs of pregnancy,
and these attacks consist of all gradations--from slight dizziness to the most severe vomiting.
It is an unpleasant experience, but in passing through it we may be glad in the thought that
"it too, will pass."

Because of the pressure exerted by the growing uterus upon the bladder, disturbances in urination
often appear, but as the uterus continues to grow and lifts itself up and away from the bladder
these symptoms disappear.

Chief of the later signs of pregnancy are "quickening" or fetal movements. The movements are
very much like the "fluttering of a young birdling." They usually are felt by the expectant
mother between the seventeenth and eighteenth weeks. This sign, together with the noting of
the fetal heartbeat at the seventh month, constitute the positive signs of pregnancy.

PROBABLE DATE OF DELIVERY

And now our expectant mother desires to know when to expect the little stranger. From countless
observations of childbirth under all conditions and in many countries, the pregnant period
is found to cover about thirty-nine weeks, or two hundred and seventy-three days. There are
a number of ways or methods of computing this time. Many physicians count back three months
and add seven days to the first day of the last menstruation. For instance, if the last menstruation
were December 2 to 6, then, to find the probable day of delivery, we count back three months
to September 2, and then add seven days. This gives us September 9, as the probable date of
delivery. The real date of delivery may come any time within the week of which this calculated
date is the center.

As a rule, ten days to two weeks preceding the day of delivery, the uterus "settles" down into
the pelvis, the waist line becomes more comfortable, and the breathing is much easier.

On the accompanying page, may be found a table for computing the probable day of labor, prepared
in accordance with the plan just described.

CHAPTER II

STORY OF THE UNBORN CHILD

To every physician in every community, sooner or later in his experience there come thoughtless
women making requests that we even hesitate to write about. Their excuses for the crime which
they seek to have the physician join them in committing, range all the way from "I don't want
to go to the trouble," to "Doctor, I've got seven children now, and I can't even educate and
dress them properly;" or, maybe, "I nearly lost my life with the last one."

EMBRYOLOGICAL IGNORANCE

One little woman came to us the other day from the suburbs, and honestly, frankly, related
this story:

"We've been married just six months, I have continued my stenographic work to add the sixty-five
dollars to our monthly income. Doctor, we must meet our monthly payments on the home, I must
continue to work, or we shall utterly fail. I am perfectly willing a baby shall come to us
two years from now, but, doctor, I just can't allow this one to go on, you must help me just
this once. Why doctor, there can't be much form or life there, it's only three months now,
or will be next week, and you know it's nothing but a mass of jelly."

She had talked with a "confidential friend" in her neighborhood, had been told that she "could
do it herself," but fearing trouble or infection, had come to the conclusion she had better
go to a "clean, reputable physician," to have the abortion performed.

This is not the place to narrate the experiences of the unfortunate victims of habitual criminal
abortion, but we would like to impress upon the reader some realization of the untimely deaths,
the awful suffering, and the life-long remorse and sorrow of the poor, misguided women who
listen to the criminal advice of neighborhood "busybodies." The infections, the invalidism,
the sterility that so often follow in the wake of these practices, are well known to all medical
people.

THE STREAM OF LIFE

And so after the patient's last statement, "It's nothing but a mass of jelly," we began the
simple but wonderfully beautiful story of the development of the "child enmothered." Just as
all vegetables, fruits, nuts, flowers, and grains come from seeds sown into fertile soil, and
just as these seeds receive nourishment from the soil, rain, and sunshine, so all our world
of brothers and sisters, of fathers and mothers, came from tiny human seeds, and in their turn
received nourishment from the peculiarly adapted stream of life, which flows in the maternal
veins for the nourishment and upbuilding of the unborn embryo.

Every little girl and boy baby that comes into the world, has stored within its body, in a
wonderfully organized capsule, a part of the ancestral stream of life that unceasingly has
flowed down through the centuries from father to son and from mother to daughter. This "germ
plasm" is a divine gift to be held in trust and carefully guarded from the odium of taint,
to be handed down to the sons and daughters of the next generation. Any young man who grasps
the thought that he possesses a portion of the stream of life, that he holds it in sacred trust
for posterity, cannot fail to be impressed with a sense of solemn responsibility so to order
his life as to be able to transmit this biologic trust to succeeding generations free from
taint and disease.
