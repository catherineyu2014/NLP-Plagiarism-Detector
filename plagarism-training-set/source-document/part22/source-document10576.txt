One of the most important events belonging to the reign of Charles II was the passage by Parliament
of the Habeas Corpus Act. The writ of habeas corpus [26] is an order, issued by a judge, requiring
a person held in custody to be brought before the court. If upon examination there appears
to be good reason for keeping the prisoner, he is to be remanded for trial; otherwise he is
to be freed or released on bail. This writ had been long used in England, and one of the clauses
of Magna Carta expressly provided against arbitrary imprisonment. It had always been possible,
however, for the king or his ministers to order the arrest of a person considered dangerous
to the state, without making any formal charge against him. The Habeas Corpus Act established
the principle that every man, not charged with or convicted of a known crime, is entitled to
personal freedom. Most of the British possessions where the Common law prevails have accepted
the act, and it has been adopted by the federal and state legislatures of the United States.

WHIGS AND TORIES

The reign of Charles II also saw the beginning of the modern party system in Parliament. Two
opposing parties took shape, very largely out of a religious controversy. The king, from his
long life in France, had become partial to Roman Catholicism, though he did not formally embrace
that faith until at the moment of death. His brother James, the heir to the throne, became
an open Roman Catholic, however, much to the disgust of many members of Parliament. A bill
was now brought forward to exclude Prince James from the succession, because of his conversion.
Its supporters received the nickname of Whigs, while those who opposed it were called Tories.
[27] The bill did not pass the House of Lords, but the two parties in Parliament continued
to divide on other questions. They survive to-day as the Liberals and the Conservatives, and
still dispute the government of England between them.

REIGN OF JAMES II, 1685-1688 A.D.

James II was without the attractive personality which had made his brother a popular ruler;
moreover, he was an avowed Roman Catholic and a staunch believer in the divine right of kings.
During his three years' reign, James managed to make enemies of most of his Protestant subjects.
He "suspended" the laws against Roman Catholics and appointed them to positions of authority
and influence. James also dismissed Parliament and supported himself with subsidies from Louis
XIV. At last a number of Whig and Tory leaders, representing both parties in Parliament, invited
that sturdy Protestant, William of Orange, [28] to rescue England from Stuart absolutism.

ACCESSION OF WILLIAM AND MARY, 1689 A.D.

William landed in England with a small army and marched unopposed to London. The wretched king,
deserted by his courtiers and his soldiers, soon found himself Harness alone. He fled to France,
where he lived the remainder of his days as a pensioner at the court of Louis XIV. Parliament
granted the throne conjointly to William and Mary, William to rule during his lifetime and
Mary to have the succession, should she survive him.

THE BILL OF RIGHTS

In settling the crown on William and Mary, Parliament took care to safeguard its own authority
and the of Protestant religion. It enacted the Bill of Rights, which has a place by the side
of Magna Carta and the Petition of Right among the great documents of English constitutional
history. This act decreed that the sovereign must henceforth be a member of the Anglican Church.
It forbade the sovereign to "suspend" the operation of the laws, or to levy money or maintain
a standing army except by consent of Parliament. Finally, it affirmed the right of subjects
to petition the sovereign and ordered the holding of frequent Parliaments. These were not new
principles of political liberty, but now the English people were strong enough not only to
assert, but also to uphold them. They reappear in the first ten amendments to the Constitution
of the United States.

THE TOLERATION ACT

At this time, also, England took an important step in the direction of religious liberty. Parliament
passed a Toleration Act, conceding to the Dissenters the right of worship, though not the right
of holding any civil or military office. The Dissenters might now serve their God as they pleased,
without fear of persecution. Unitarians and Roman Catholics, as well as Jews, were expressly
excluded from the benefits of the act. The passage of this measure did much to remove religion
from English politics as a vital issue.

THE "GLORIOUS REVOLUTION"

The revolution of 1688-89 A.D. thus struck a final blow at absolutism and divine right in England.
An English king became henceforth the servant of Parliament, holding office only on good behavior.
An act of Parliament had made him and an act of Parliament might depose him. It is well to
remember, however, that the revolution was not a popular movement. It was a successful struggle
for parliamentary supremacy on the part of the upper and middle classes--the nobles, squires,
merchants, and clergy. England now had a "limited" or "constitutional" monarchy controlled
by the aristocracy. Not till the nineteenth century did the common people succeed in establishing
a really democratic government in England.

249. ENGLAND IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY

SOCIAL ENGLAND

The population of England at the close of the seventeenth century exceeded five millions, of
whom at least two-thirds lived in the country. Except for London there were only four towns
of more than ten thousand inhabitants. London counted half a million people within its limits
and had become the largest city in Europe. Town life still wore a medieval look, but the increase
of wealth gradually introduced many new comforts and luxuries. Coal came into use instead of
charcoal; tea, coffee, and chocolate competed with wine, ale, and beer as beverages; the first
newspapers appeared, generally in weekly editions; amusements multiplied; and passenger coaches
began to ply between London and the provincial centers. The highways, however, were wretched
and infested with robbers. The traveler found some recompense for the hardships of a journey
in the country inns, famous for their plenty and good cheer. The transport of goods was chiefly
by means of pack horses, because of the poor roads and the absence of canals. Postal arrangements
also remained very primitive, and in remote country districts letters were not delivered more
than once a week. The difficulties of travel and communication naturally made for isolation;
and country people, except the wealthy, rarely visited the metropolis.

ECONOMIC ENGLAND

As the population of England increased, old industries developed and new ones sprang up. The
chief manufacture was that of wool, while that of silk flourished after the influx of Huguenots
which followed the revocation [29] of the Edict of Nantes. The absence of large textile mills
made it necessary to carry on spinning and weaving in the homes of the operatives. The vast
mineral deposits, which in later times became the main source of England's prosperity, were
then little worked. Farming and the raising of sheep and cattle still remained the principal
occupations. But agriculture was retarded by the old system of common tillage and open fields,
just as industry was fettered by the trade monopoly of the craft guilds. These survivals of
the Middle Ages had not yet disappeared.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS

The seventeenth century in England saw a notable advance in science. At this time Harvey revealed
the circulation of the blood. [30] Napier, a Scotchman, invented logarithms, which lie at the
basis of the higher mathematics. Boyle, an Irishman, has been called the "father of modern
chemistry," so many were his researches in that field of knowledge. Far greater than any of
these men was Sir Isaac Newton, who discovered the law of gravitation and the differential
calculus. During the Civil War a group of students interested in the natural world began to
hold meetings in London and Oxford, and shortly after the Restoration they obtained a charter
under the name of the Royal Society. It still exists and enrolls among its members the most
distinguished scientists of England. The Royal Observatory at Greenwich also dates from the
period of the Restoration. Altogether much was being done to uncover the secrets of nature.

PROGRESS OF ART

Seventeenth century England produced no very eminent painters or sculptors, though foreign
artists, such as Rubens and Van Dyck, were welcomed there. Among architects the most famous
was Sir Christopher Wren, who did much to popularize the Renaissance style of building. [31]
A great fire which destroyed most of old London during the reign of Charles II gave Wren an
opportunity to rebuild about fifty parish churches, as well as St. Paul's Cathedral. His tomb
in the crypt of the cathedral bears the famous inscription: Si monumentum requieris, circumspice:
"If you seek his monument, look around you."

LITERATURE

English literature in the seventeenth century covered many fields. Shakespeare and Bacon, the
two chief literary ornaments of the Elizabethan Age, did some of their best work during the
reign of James I. In 1611 A.D. appeared the Authorized Version of the Bible, sometimes called
the King James Version because it was dedicated to that monarch. The simplicity, dignity, and
eloquence of this translation have never been excelled, and it still remains in ordinary use
among Protestants throughout the English- speaking world. [32] The Puritan poet, John Milton,
composed his epic of Paradise Lost during the reign of Charles II. About the same time another
Puritan, John Bunyan, wrote the immortal Pilgrim's Progress, a book which gives an equal though
different pleasure to children and adults, to the ignorant and the learned. But these are only
a few of the eminent poets and prose writers of the age.

POSITION OF ENGLAND

Thus, aside from its political importance, the seventeenth century formed a noteworthy period
in English history. England until this time had been, on the whole, a follower rather than
a leader of Europe. The defeat of the Spanish Armada, the overthrow of Stuart absolutism, and
the check administered to the aggressive designs of Louis XIV were so many indications that
England had risen to a place of first importance in European affairs. During this century,
too, the American colonies of England began to lay the basis for Anglo-Saxon predominance in
the New World.
