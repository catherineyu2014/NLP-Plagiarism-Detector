Miller (1955a:164) took a male Great Horned Owl in the Sierra del Carmen on April 22. Ridgway
(1914:742) listed B. v. pallescens from Sabinas. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:30) obtained a
female "near San Pedro" on January 29. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:143) recorded B.
v. pallescens from Coahuila on February 24, May 26, and June 10. The record of B. v. mayensis
from Las Delicias (Amadon and Phillips, 1947:578) has been reidentified by Webster and Orr
(1958:141) as B. v. pallescens. Dickerman saw a Great Horned Owl in the Sierra del Pino on
May 12,1954.

*Glaucidium gnoma californicum Sclater.--Specimen examined: one, [Male] 31582, from 20 mi.
S Ocampo, 6500 ft., April 5, 1954, weight, 55 gms.

Concerning forms of Pygmy Owls, Miller (1955a:164) remarked that the best distinguishing characters
of G. g. gnoma and californicum are tail length and wing length. The characters of No. 31582
(wing, 94 mm.; tail, 69 mm.) are clearly those of californicum and not those of gnoma. Miller
(loc. cit.) remarked that he "encountered at least five different individuals, chiefly in the
pine-oak at 7000 feet" and one in oaks and piñons at 5000 feet in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra
del Carmen. The size of the testes (left, 9×5 mm.; right, 7×4 mm.) of No. 31582 indicates good
probability of breeding by the Pygmy Owl in the State.

**Micrathene whitneyi (Cooper).--Miller (1955a:164) heard the Elf Owl at close range in oaks
at 5000 feet in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra del Carmen on April 24.

**Speotyto cunicularia hypugaea (Bonaparte).--Specimens examined: total 3: [Female] 32043 from
3 mi. S, 9 mi. E Cuatro Ciénegas, 2250 ft., June 30, 1952; [Male] 32653 from 6 mi. W San Antonio
de las Alazanas, July 5, 1955; and [Male] 31602 from 14 mi. W San Antonio de las Alazanas,
6500 ft., January 7, 1954.

Although there are no records in Coahuila of specimens of Burrowing Owls north of 3 mi. S and
9 mi. E Cuatro Ciénegas, this owl probably occurs in the northern section of the State. The
records of Burrowing Owls from the southern part of Brewster County, Texas (Van Tyne and Sutton,
1937:38), suggest such occurrence. No. 31602 was shot in a prairie dog colony; No. 32043 was
captured in a steel trap. Baker saw Burrowing Owls 7 mi. S and 4 mi. E Bella Unión, 7200 feet,
on June 25, 1952.

*Caprimulgus vociferus arizonae (Brewster).--Specimens examined: total 4: [Male] 31449 and
[Female] 31450 from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), May 12 and 15, 1954, weights,
48 and 42 gms.; and [Male] [Male] 31028-31029 from 2 mi. N, 18 mi. W Santa Teresa, 7250 ft.,
April 3, 1952.

The Whip-poor-will occurs between 5000 feet and 9000 feet in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:164) reported
C. v. arizonae in the Sierra del Carmen. Ridgway (1914:521) stated that Antrostomus vociferus
macromystax (=C. v. arizonae) occurs in the southeastern sector of Coahuila at Sierra Guadalupe.
Burleigh and Lowery (1942:190) reported the Whip-poor-will "near the summit of Diamante Pass";
because of its size (wing, 170 mm.; tail, 135 mm.) this Whip-poor-will from Diamante Pass seems
to represent the subspecies arizonae. The sizes of the testes of Nos. 31449, 31028, and 31029
(13, 12, and 13 mm. long) and an egg taken from No. 31450 indicate breeding by this species
in the State. Ridgway (1914:550) recorded the Poor-will at Sabinas on May 21 and at Saltillo
on May 6. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:39) stated that P. n. nuttallii was not common in the Big
Bend Country of Texas; this probably is true for northwestern Coahuila as well. The specimens
from the Sierra del Pino, collected by Dickerman in a pine-oak association at 6200 feet, were
taken near the upper limit of their range.

The size of the testes (9×5 mm.) of No. 31446 and an enlarged oviduct and an ovum (4 mm. in
diameter) of No. 31447 indicate breeding by the Poor-will in Coahuila.

**Chordeiles minor howelli Oberholser.--Specimen examined: one, [Male] 31443, from 3 mi. N,
4 mi. E San Francisco (=25 mi. N Ocampo), 4850 ft., May 16, 1954.

Van Hoose (1955:302) wrote that nighthawks were heard and seen frequently 3 mi. N and 4 mi.
E San Francisco. Blake (1953:227) said that the Common Nighthawk breeds in Sonora, Chihuahua,
Tamaulipas, and Durango; the size of the testes (7×4.5 mm.) of No. 31443 indicates the possibility
of breeding by this species in the State.

Specimens of the Lesser Nighthawk, subspecies C. a. texensis, have been recorded in the literature
from representative localities throughout most of Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:190-191)
obtained, on April 18, at "a small pond at the edge of Saltillo," one male that was exceedingly
fat; they (loc. cit.) suggested that their specimen was a migrant. Goldman (1951:377, 389)
stated that C. a. texensis occupied the Lower and Upper Sonoran and Upper Austral life-zones
of Coahuila. This is probably true for northwestern Coahuila as well.

The presence of an egg in the oviduct of No. 32045 and the dates (May 6, June 20, and July
6) on which Nos. 31442, and 32044-32046 were obtained indicate breeding by this species in
Coahuila.

**Aëronautes saxatalis saxatalis (Woodhouse).--Specimen examined: one, [Male] 31672, from Pico
de Jimulco, 5600 ft., April 5, 1953, weight, 35 gms.

Burleigh and Lowery (1942:191) found the White-throated Swift to be common at "the summit of
Diamante Pass and on the nearby ridges." Miller (1955a:164) saw the species from 4800 feet
up to the crest of the Sierra del Carmen. Several White-throated Swifts were seen flying overhead
at Pico de Jimulco on April 5.

No specimens of A. s. sclateri from México are known. Miller (1955a:165) listed one specimen
with dimensions (wing, 145 mm.) that approaches sclateri. The measurements of No. 31672 (wing,
143 mm.; tail, 58 mm.) also approach the dimensions of specimens of sclateri but are best referred
to A. s. saxatalis.

**Calothorax lucifer (Swainson).--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:191) obtained a male Lucifer Hummingbird
at the Chorro del Agua on April 19. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:43) reported a male from the
Río Grande (=3 mi. W Boquillas, Texas).

Archilochus colubris (Linnaeus).--Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:180) remarked that the
Ruby-throated Hummingbird is a moderately common migrant, wintering from sea level to 9350
feet throughout México, except in a few states. The only published record of a specimen of
this hummer in the State is of a male taken on April 22 in a small arroyo twenty miles west
of Saltillo (Burleigh and Lowery, 1942:191).

*Archilochus alexandri (Bourcier and Mulsant).--Specimens examined: total 2: [Male] 31035 from
the Río Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell County, Texas, in Coahuila), 600 ft., March 18, 1952;
and [Male] 32052 from 2 mi. S, 11 mi. E Nava, 810 ft., June 16, 1952.

Miller (1955a:165) stated the Black-chinned Hummingbird was common in the desert area at the
base of the mountains of the Sierra del Carmen, and that Marsh, on July 25, obtained this hummingbird
"near Piedra Blanca (Conejo)." Burleigh and Lowery (1942:191) obtained a female in an arroyo
about twenty miles west of Saltillo on April 22.

Miller (1955a:165) indicated that the Broad-tailed Hummingbird was fairly common in the Sierra
del Carmen. According to Burleigh and Lowery (1942:191) this species is not uncommon in the
pine woods bordering the summit of Diamante Pass; they saw the bird between 4900 and 10,000 feet.

*Eugenes fulgens fulgens Boucard.--Miller (1955a:165) obtained a male Rivoli's Hummingbird
on Loomis Peak, 8800 feet, on April 11 in the Sierra del Carmen.
