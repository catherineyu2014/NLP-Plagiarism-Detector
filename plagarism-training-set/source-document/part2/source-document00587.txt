"Teach me the knack," said I. "Oh, it can't be taught," replied the boy. "Well, here is a dime
for your trouble," said I, putting the fish into my pail. "Do you suppose I take pay for what
I do for sport, mister?" said little barefoot, waving back my hand with the air of a prince.

After that we became good friends, and met often at the bridge; but I never could learn his
knack of catching trout.

WE THREE.

What fine times we have together!--Carlo, John, and Bella; by which last I mean myself. Carlo
has the advantage of the other two of us sometimes; for he has four legs, and can run faster
than either John or I. But then we can do a great many things that Carlo cannot do.

For example, John and I sometimes take our books, and sit down on the rocks in the wood, under
the thick trees, and read stories. And then Carlo will lie down at our feet, and go to sleep;
for he cannot understand the nice stories which the other two friends enjoy so much.

But wait till we go into the swamps after berries, or into the wood-borders after hazel-nuts.
Then Carlo is wide awake, you may be sure. If he sees a snake, what a noise he makes! We can
always tell by the tone of his bark when he has found a snake.

And, when John climbs a tree after nuts, how anxiously Carlo will stand underneath and watch
him, so afraid is he that the little boy will get a fall! And how the good dog will jump and
show his pleasure when he sees John once more safe on the firm ground!

Oh! we have fine times together, we three, both in summer and winter; for Carlo likes to see
us skate on ice, and is fond of a snowballing frolic. In all our sleigh-rides he goes with
us, and takes great care of us. We are dear friends, we three, and I should no more think of
striking Carlo than of striking John.

PET, THE CANARY.

A little girl by the name of Agnes, who lives in Maine, and who much enjoys "The Nursery,"
has a beautiful, bright canary, which her papa brought her one day in a paper-box. Agnes named
him Pet.

The little fellow has become so tame, that he is allowed to stay out of his cage as long as
he wishes, always going to it of his own accord when bedtime comes. One day I found no pins
on my pin-cushion; and, seeing them scattered around on the bureau, I wondered who could have
done the mischief. I soon found, by watching, that it was Pet's work.

Every day he took his stand on the pin-cushion, in front of the glass, to pull out all the
pins. I saw him once work a long time trying to stick one back by tipping his head, first one
side and then the other, holding the pin tightly in his bill; but he soon gave it up.

Little Fannie, Agnes's two-year-old sister, often shares her lunch with him; he sitting on
the edge of the saucer, and helping himself while she is eating. As I write, he is sitting
on the tassel of the shade, looking out of the window. Some day I'll tell you more of Pet's pranks.

                                                                MAMMA.

THE CAT SHOW.

It was at the Crystal Palace, in Sydenham, England. I wish all the readers of "The Nursery"
could have seen it.

There were over three hundred cats in cages. Each one had a nice red cushion in the front-part
of the cage, and in the back part a dish of water or milk. Each one had a ribbon around the
neck, to which was attached a medal with the number of the cage. The ribbons were of all colors.

The cats that had taken the first prize were known by a little blue flag suspended over the
front of the cage, and were the largest cats. Very many of them were lazily sleeping on their
cushions, as happy as if they were in their own homes. They took little notice of the people
who were looking at them; and, as a placard on each cage ordered spectators to "move on," no
one could spend much time in trying to attract their attention.

I can hardly tell you about all the cats, there were so many,--some all white, some all black,
and some all yellow; black-and-yellow, black-and-white, black-and-gray, gray-and-white, black-and-yellow-and-white;
cats with long hair, and cats with short; cats with tails, and cats without. One large Russian
cat, called the "Czar," was brown, with smooth, short, shining fur, which looked like seal-skin.

Then there were kittens of all sizes and colors. In one cage was a black mother-puss, with
four perfectly white kittens, their eyes not yet open. Another black mother had two kittens,--one
black, and one gray. A black-and-yellow puss had one black, and one yellow kitten.

In some of the cages were two or three large kittens having a good time together. Some of them
had balls to play with; some were climbing on the sides of the cage or frolicking with one
another; and others were running around after their tails, in real kitten fashion.

Just before five o'clock, the baskets in which the cats were brought were placed on the tops
of the cages. Some of the cats reached up and tried to get hold of them. They all seemed to
know that the show was over, and that they would soon be able to run and jump about, with plenty
of air and space.

I must not forget to tell you how quiet all these cats were. Not one "Me-ow" was to be heard.
When, out of sight of the cages, one would never have known there was a cat in the building.

  GOING THROUGH THE CORN.

  Music by T. Crampton.

  1. Right and left upstanding,
  See on either side,
  Blooming corn expanding,
  Rippling like the tide.
  With breath of Eden scented,
  On the breezes borne,...
  All in love presented,
  Going through the corn.

  2. Bath'd in light etherial,
  Ripening in the sun,
  Royal corn imperial,
  Bread for every one.
  'Tis God's own gift descending,
  For the poor and lorn,...
  See the full ears bending,
  Going through the corn.

  3. Thrush and blackbird singing
  In the coppice near,
  All the blue sky ringing
  With their notes so clear!
  The twitt'ring swallows skimming,
  Through the air of morn,...
  Happy all, all hymning,
  Going through the corn.
