But her Majesty, who is a Protestant, is not the only lady now living who has made her mark
in Roumanian history. There is another of whom we are sure our readers will be glad to hear
something, for she is an accomplished Englishwoman, and it is very questionable whether, after
all, the Roumanians do not owe their independence as much to her energy and devotion as to
any other cause; we mean Madame Rosetti, the wife of the Home Secretary.[195] It was mentioned
in our historical summary that the patriots of 1848 made their escape to France in that year,
and that they returned after the Crimean war in 1856. That is a long story told in a, couple
of sentences, and but for Madame Rosetti it is probable they would never have escaped, but
would have languished and died in a Turkish prison in Bosnia, whilst Roumania might have been
at this day a Turkish pashalik or a Russian province. The fact is that all the leaders of the
revolution, fifteen in number, were arrested and conveyed on board a Turkish man-of-war lying
in the Danube; and Madame Rosetti, whose heroic adventures have formed the theme of a work
by Michelet,[196] helped them to escape from their captors. As we have already said, she is
an Englishwoman, whose maiden name was Grant, and she had only been married about a year when
the revolution broke out. Her first child was born a day or two before her husband and his
comrades were arrested, but she at once left her bed, and, taking her infant in her arms, prepared
to follow them. First she managed to obtain an interview with the patriots on board the Turkish
vessel to which they had been conveyed, and there plans were formed which she skilfully and
courageously executed. Disguising herself as a peasant, and carrying her child, she followed
them up the Danube to Orsova, communicating with her friends from time to time by signals.
At Orsova the prisoners were landed, and whilst they were on shore she succeeded in making
their guards intoxicated, and, with the connivance of the authorities, prepared suitable conveyances,
in which the patriots made their escape. First they passed through Servia, and reaching Vienna
in safety they entered that city the day after the bombardment, and subsequently they made
their way through Germany, accompanied by their deliverer, and found a hospitable asylum in
Paris. Since her return Madame Rosetti has been as valuable a coadjutor to her husband in his
prosperity as she was in his adversity, and she is also a useful and willing adviser to any
of her countrymen who, visiting Roumania, may stand in need of her assistance.

[Footnote 195: When the above lines were penned, M. Rosetti was the Home Secretary, although
he has since resigned. It was as such that we knew him, and we therefore prefer to leave our
account, of him and his amiable lady as it was originally written.]

IV.

Her husband, his Excellency Constantin A. Rosetti, has also reaped the reward of his devotion
to his country's welfare. He is of an old boyard family of Italian origin, and in his early
youth he was not only a soldier in the national army, but his pen also gained for him a considerable
reputation, for he composed and published many interesting Roumanian poems. At the age of about
thirty-two years he married the English lady to whom he owes so much, and of his adventures
in 1848 we have already twice spoken. Before he permanently took up his residence in Paris
after his escape, we believe he spent some time in Constantinople. In Paris he was the companion
of Michelet, Quinet, and other leading writers, and with them and his countrymen the brothers
Bratiano and Golesco lie managed by his patriotic publications to keep the lamp of liberty
burning in his own country. Here, too, he is said to have enjoyed the support of our own distinguished
statesman, William Ewart Gladstone, who was subsequently made a Roumanian citizen by an Act
of the legislature about the year 1861, and whom the Roumanians still regard with feelings
of great respect and admiration. On the return of M. Rosetti to Roumania after the Crimean
war he founded the 'Romanal' a daily paper which still occupies a high position amongst the
journals of the capital, and which remains his property.[197] He took a conspicuous part in
the union of the Principalities under Prince Couza, and supported that prince whilst his proceedings
were constitutional, but he was one of the most active agents in his deposition, and the only
serious objection that has been taken to his acts and those of his colleagues on that occasion
is that he employed the army to bring about the prince's overthrow. To this matter, however,
we have already referred in our historical summary. In 1866 he was one of the provisional government,
and was at first by no means favourably disposed towards the present king, who was, we believe,
recommended to the Roumanians by the Emperor Napoleon III. In later times, however, he became
one of his Majesty's most faithful advisers.

M. Rosetti is about sixty-seven years of age, full of life and energy. His career of hardship
has somewhat bowed his physical frame, but it has in no way interfered with his cheerful and
kindly disposition. In appearance he is an Italian, has very prominent but mild eyes, and a
most thoughtful, somewhat careworn countenance. He is vif, hot and excitable, and not unfrequently
lets his voice be heard if anything is going wrong in public affairs, and something is very
often going wrong in Roumania. He speaks Roumanian, French, and German, and can write English
(of which he is fond of interjecting an expressive word now and then when he is speaking in
French) fairly well. Unfortunately for scandal-mongers, of whom there are a good many in the
capital and elsewhere, M. Rosetti lives with great simplicity on the premises of the 'Romanul,'
and upon, the profits of his paper and his salary; so they are unable to charge him with peculation,
which they would certainly do if he gave them the slightest justification. He is a Radical,
and an uncompromising enemy of coups d'état, and of despotism or unconstitutional proceedings
in any form, a man of unflinching honesty and the leader of political thought in his country.
In fact, he is a patriot, and his countrymen know and appreciate the fact.

They usually couple his name with that of M. Bratiano, who is President of the Council and
Minister of Finance, and, so far as temperament is concerned, the very opposite of his colleague.
M. Bratiano is a quiet, courteous gentleman, somewhat younger than M. Rosetti. His features
are regular and handsome, his beard and hair iron-grey, and his voice even and melodious. He
is full of pleasant humour, and has the bearing and manner of an English gentleman; but although
an excellent debater, he is not a good linguist. In Roumania they say, 'Rosetti thinks and
Bratiano speaks,' but Bratiano thinks as well as speaks. So completely at one are the two statesmen
that many of the uninformed poorer classes who have not seen them believe them to be one person,
whom they call 'Bratiano-Rosetti,' and whilst we were in Bucarest we saw a caricature (an art
in which the Roumanians take great delight) where the two statesmen were depicted as the Siamese
twins.

The aim and policy of M. Bratiano are well expressed in one of his despatches on the question
of the Danube, which were made public by that diplomatic phenomenon M. Callimaki-Catargi. 'Our
attitude,' he says, 'like the whole policy of the ministry to which I belong, has always been,
and ever should be, defensive, not offensive.'[198]

Amongst the other leaders of political thought in Roumania is Prince Demeter Ghika, President
of the Senate, a fine burly good-natured gentleman of the old school; Prince Jon Ghika, at
present the Roumanian Ambassador in London, a patriot and a savant, whose sons were educated
in England; M. Statesco, the Foreign Minister, a young and promising statesman; M. Stourdza,
the director of the National Credit Association; and there are doubtless many others of whom
we do not like to speak without a nearer acquaintance, or better information than we possess.
One of these is M. Cogalniceanu, a deputy, who has written a good history of Roumania, was
a minister under Prince Couza, and we believe the author of the celebrated Act of 1864 which
created the peasant proprietary of the country.[199]

[Footnote 197: There are daily papers in Bucarest for readers of every nationality resident
there, the Romanal, Indépendance Roumaine, Bukarester Tagblatt, &c., all of which are free
to say whatever they please--and they say it!]

spoken elsewhere.]

V.

From men to measures is a natural transition in politics. Although we have endeavoured to show,
and do not hesitate to repeat here, that some of the great principles laid down in the Constitution
of Roumania are only beginning to be carried out in practice, it is but just to add that the
vigour and energy with which the party of progress has of late years developed the resources
of the country is a matter of surprise and admiration even to foreigners resident there who
are acquainted with our Western methods. The present régime began, as we have already said,
in 1875, and since that time the foreign policy of the party in power first liberated the nation
from the last vestige of foreign despotism; then firmly established it as a European kingdom.
That they occasionally make mistakes no one can deny. For example, the recent announcement
in the speech from the throne, that Roumania was prepared in the present and future for every
sacrifice which it might be necessary to make to ensure in all respects absolute facility of
navigation of the Danube, appears to an outsider to have been an error in judgment, if the
government were not prepared to hear with equanimity of the threatened departure of the ambassador
of a neighbouring State which had put the cap upon its head, and against whose unwarrantable
pretensions the remark was directed. But it is easy to be wise after the event, and we admit
that it is presumptuous for anyone to criticise hastily any matter that is being tossed about
on the troubled sea of Oriental politics. Living as we do on a seagirt isle which is practically
unapproachable to an external foe, and having for centuries enjoyed the blessings of freedom,
we can have no conception of the difficult cards which Roumanian statesmen have to play in
the political game in which they are often compelled, much against their desire, to participate.
From time to time they hear great international theories propounded for the benefit of their
powerful neighbours, to which they are compelled to close their ears, however nearly those
principles may apply to their own condition. Suppose, for example, some European Power claims
new territory on the ground of geographical position. Why, ask the Roumanians, should we be
hemmed in as we are on every side? Why should not the plains on both sides of the Danube guarded
by the Balkans and the Carpathians constitute a strong realm, one and indivisible, with the
great river flowing as an artery through its centre? The answer is, Russia! If an v of the
Great Powers had insisted upon such a readjustment in the East, she would have opposed it,
for is not Bulgaria her last stepping-stone to Constantinople? 'Skobeleff the First, King of
Bulgaria' would suit her aims far better. This reminds one of 'Panslavism.' Who will deny the
right of adjacent branches of the same race to live under one government? Admitted; but then
why not also Panroumanism? In that case considerable portions of Austro-Hungary, Bessarabia,
Bulgaria, Servia, would have to be added to the present dominions of King Charles of Roumania;
for there are almost as many Roumanians in those countries as there are within the present
boundaries of the kingdom.[200]

But if Roumanian statesmen are permitted to enjoy their reflections on these interesting political
topics, they know that it would be unsafe to publish them, for, as we have seen, if they venture
even, to cry too loudly 'Roumania for the Roumanians,' some hectoring neighbour instantly takes
the alarm and threatens to withdraw its ambassador; and in case of a fracas between any two
such neighbouring States, even the rights which she at present enjoys would hardly be respected.
Her policy is therefore tolerably well defined, and it was ably set forth in the royal speech
which contained that dangerous reference to Austrian pretensions. Peace is requisite for her,
in order that her Parliament may occupy itself in developing the riches of the soil and the
economic interests of the country; but the organisation of a strong defensive army is equally
necessary to protect those interests from grasping and despotic States in her vicinity, and
because, 'by the development of all the forces of the nation, Roumania will become an element
of order, peace, and progress in Eastern Europe.' In fact, she must make herself, by peaceful
measures, what Michael the Brave succeeded for a very short time, and from motives of personal
ambition, in making her by the sword in his day, the arbiter of surrounding nations, the Belgium
of the East, which no aggressive despot would dare to assail; and she must become sufficiently
strong to resist not only inimical but friendly foreign occupations, which have such a demoralising
effect upon her people.

On this undertaking her Government has already for some years past been embarked. It has secured
railway property for the State which was in the hands of aliens, has begun to improve watercourses,
created national credit institutions, reduced the interest upon the national debt, increased
the value of Roumanian securities, and has generally followed, as it still pursues, the ways
of 'peace, retrenchment, and reform.'[201]

We have no wish to patronise Roumania even in words, for her best friend is he who tells her
to depend entirely on her own resources and develop those herself; to carve her fortunes, and
to shape her ends. But when we look upon her sufferings, reflecting how for ages she has lain
beneath the claws of savage enemies, quailed under despots who sucked the lifeblood of the
nation, and then compare her constitutional democracy with ours--nay, if alone from a material
point of view we weigh the interest we have in her prosperity, we cannot fail to see that in
the East is rising up a Power, in part of our creation, young and weak as yet, but full of
hope and promise; and therefore, in concluding this imperfect record of her 'past and present,'
we heartily commend her future to the earnest watchfulness of every English friend of liberty.

[Footnote 200: According to some, there are more.]

[Footnote 201: Although we have endeavoured as much as possible to avoid burdening this popular
treatise with statistics, one set of figures which have been kindly supplied to us by friends
at Bucarest and in London is so significant, and indeed of such general interest, that we must
claim the reader's indulgence for giving it in extenso. It comprises the values of Russian,
Turkish, and Roumanian securities from 1870 to 1880, which are as follows:--

                                 TURKISH.
            RUSSIAN.      General Five per Cent.       ROUMANIAN.
         Six per Cents.           Debt.                Oppenheim.

1870     83-1/2 to  94-1/2   45     to 51               75 to  98 1871     88      "  97  
44-1/2  " 52-1/2           86  "  96-1/2 1872     95      " 100       46-1/2  " 55        
91  " 104 1873     96      " 100-1/2   45      " 47               98  " 104 1874     97   
" 103       45      " 46-1/2           98  " 108 1875     95      " 104-1/2   23      " 45
100  " 109 1876     74      " 100-1/2   11-1/2  " 23               74  " 106 1877*    71  
"  93        6-1/2  " 11-1/2           58  "  91 1878*    74      "  91        8-1/2  " 12
87  " 105 1879     84      "  93       10-1/2  " 12               93  " 110 1880     85   
"  96       10      " 12-1/2          102  " 112

And in 1881 the prices of the Oppenheim loan ranged from 105 to 116. From these eloquent figures
it will be seen that whilst Russia has been stationary, and Turkey has fallen 75 per cent,
the condition and security of Roumania has risen, roughly speaking, 25 per cent, in the eslimation
of the financial world during the last ten years. The two years marked with an asterisk were
years of war.]

APPENDIX II.

THE 'CAPITULATIONS.'

The original 'Capitulation' of Mircea I. of Wallachia to the Sultan Bajazid I. at Nicopolis,
1393 A.D., is contained in a 'Hatthoumaioun' of the latter, said to have been preserved in
Constantinople, and there seen by a Roumanian called Kitzorano, who was attached to the Wallachian
Embassy, and who took a copy of it (along with others), which he sent to the Great Ban Takanitza
Vacaresco. The Greek historian, Dionysius Photino, also saw it at the Porte, and published
a copy of it in his 'History of Dacia,' vol. ii. cap. v. p. 369, a work which the reader will
find in the British Museum. This runs as follows:--

'We order, in our great condescension, that the country of Wallachia, which has lately submitted
to our invincible arms, shall be governed by its own laws, and that the Voivode shall have
the power of making war and peace with his neighbours and of life and death over his subjects.
All Christians belonging to the countries subject to our rule who would emigrate to Wallachia
shall be allowed the free exercise of their religion. All Wallachians visiting our empire on
business shall be allowed to do so without interference in the same or in their garments. The
Christian voivodes to be elected by the metropolitan and the boyards. In return for our great
condescension in having accepted this rayah (the Voivode of Wallachia) amongst the other subjects
of our empire, he will be bound to pay into our treasury, every year, the sum of 6,000 red
piastres of the country.'

Translations of this capitulation are to be found in the French histories of Roumania, but
they are not always trustworthy; for example, Beaure and Mathorel (Appendix, p. 203) profess
to give a verbatim copy, in which the last article declares that the Sultan promises never
to deliver a firman to a Wallachian subject, nor to summon him to Constantinople. A moment's
reflection would have shown the inaccuracy of this statement, for Constantinople was at that
time still the capital of the Eastern Empire, and only fell into the Ottoman power in 1453.
The stipulation in question is the last in the treaty with Vlad (V.?), 1460.

The 'Capitulation' of Bogdan of Moldavia to Selim I., 1513, was in some respects more favourable
to the vassal State. Amongst other stipulations, it provided for the residence in Constantinople
of a Moldavian envoy, and permitted a Christian church to be erected there. The annual tribute
was, however, raised and consisted of 11,000 piastres, forty falcons, and forty mares in foal,
'all by way of present.' In both countries, after each war or insurrection fresh stipulations,
including a constantly increasing tribute, were added.

APPENDIX III.

THE ROUMANIAN CONSTITUTION.

The Constitution of Roumania contains one hundred and thirty-three articles, and is framed
with great regard to justice and to the national liberties. The following are some of its leading
provisions. The country is divided into districts, the districts into arrondissements, the
arrondissements into communes.[202] It grants (Article 5) freedom of conscience, of instruction,
of the press, and of public meeting. Abolishes (10 and 12)[203] distinctions and privileges
of class and foreign titles, such as Prince, Count, Baron, &c., as being contrary to ancient
institutions.[204] Capital punishment is abolished except under martial law in time of war
(18). The property of the peasantry and the indemnity to landowners are inviolable (20). The
Greek Catholic religion is made the State Church, but all other sects are allowed freedom of
worship (21). Primary instruction is gratuitous and compulsory (23), and primary schools are
to be established in every commune. Freedom of speech, except as to breaches of the Criminal
Code, is unrestricted; press offences must be tried by jury, and no journal can be 'warned,'
suspended, or suppressed; neither is there any kind of 'censure' of the press (24). Freedom
of assemblage (26) and the right to petition (28) are confirmed; and the extradition of political
exiles is forbidden. All crimes are to be tried by jury (105). The legislative power is vested
in the Prince and the national representatives, namely, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies
(32). But money bills and matters relating to the army contingents must originate with the
latter (33).

The executive power is vested in the prince (35) (now the king), who is hereditary in the male
line only (82), and who must belong to the Orthodox Greek Church. He is inviolate, his ministers
only being responsible, and one of them must countersign all his decrees (92). He sanctions,
and may refuse his assent to, all laws; has the right of amnesty (93); is the head of the army,
makes war, concludes peace, and performs the other acts of a constitutional sovereign. Should
a vacancy occur in the throne, various provisions exist for the eventuality, and in case of
failure of issue the two Assemblies conjointly 'elect a prince of one of the sovereign dynasties
of Western Europe' (84). (Rather vague, but very significant.)

The Chamber of Deputies consists of members elected by direct and by indirect voting. The constituency
is divided into four 'colleges' or groups (58). The first college in each district comprises
persons having incomes from property (foncier) of not less than 300 ducats, equal to about
141l. (59). The second college includes those with an income ranging from 100 to 300 ducats
(47l. to 141l.)(60). The third (61) comprises persons in trade paying the State 80 francs (about
3l. 4s.) or upwards per annum. Members of the liberal professions, half-pay officers, and some
others, are exempted from the money qualification. These colleges elect each one Deputy, and
the towns elect an additional number according to their importance, from such places as Pitesti
two to Bucarest five. The fourth college elects indirectly. It consists of all persons who
pay any taxes or contributions, however small. In this college each set of fifty electors names
a delegate, and the delegates elect a Deputy. The Deputies (of whom there are to-day one hundred
and forty-five) must be Roumanians, born or naturalised, must have attained the age of twenty-five,
and must live in Roumania (66). The duration of the Chamber of Deputies is four years.

The Senate is elected by two colleges, being the two highest for the election of Deputies.
It consists to-day of seventy-six members, and includes a number of high officials who are
not elective, such as the archbishop and bishops. The qualification for a Senator is an income
of 800 ducats (equal to about 376l.) per annum, and he must have attained the age of forty
years. The Senators are elected for eight years, one half retiring every four years, except
in case of a dissolution of the Senate, when all must be re-elected, or, more properly speaking,
a new Senate must be chosen (68 to 81). The Act of the Constitution deals with the judicial
system, the Code Napoléon being in force in Roumania, with finances, army organisation, and
other important matters of national interest. The Act is signed by the Prince and his Ministers:
The Minister of the Interior and President of the Council, L. Catargi; the Minister of Finance,
J. Bratiano; the Minister of Justice, J. Cantacuzene; the Minister of Foreign Affairs, P. Mavrogeni;
the Minister of Public Worship and Instruction, C.A. Rosetti; the Minister of War, J. Ghika;
the Minister of Public Works, Agriculture, and Commerce, D. Stourdza.

[Footnote 202: This abstract is made from the French translation of the Constitution; the actual
divisions of the country are as follows:--

Județu is a department or district, the head of which is a prefect. Of these there are at present
thirty-two in all.

Plasa, subdivision of a Județu, the head of which is a sub-prefect.

Comuna, a parish.

Urba, a city.

Orage, a town.]
