We have deemed it best thus to gather together from all available sources all the information
we could glean from the circulars, etc., of the Metropolitan Fair, with the names of its officers,
and the addresses of the Executive Committees, that we might give all possible information
to our widely spread circle of readers. We give, from the excellent article in the January
number of the North American Review already quoted, a vivid description of scenes occurring
in the great Northwest, upon a similar occasion.

     'In Chicago, for instance, the Branch has lately held a fair of
     colossal proportions, to which the whole Northwest was invited to
     send supplies, and to come in mass! On the 26th of October last,
     when it opened, a procession of three miles in length, composed of
     wagon loads of supplies, and of people in various ways interested,
     paraded through the streets of Chicago; the stores being closed,
     and the day given up to patriotic sympathies. For fourteen days the
     fair lasted, and every day brought reënforcements of supplies, and
     of people and purchasers. The country people, from hundreds of
     miles about, sent in upon the railroads all the various products of
     their farms, mills, and hands. Those who had nothing else sent the
     poultry from their barnyards; the ox or bull or calf from the
     stall; the title deed of a few acres of land; so many bushels of
     grain, or potatoes, or onions. Loads of hay, even, were sent in
     from ten or a dozen miles out, and sold at once in the hay market.
     On the roads entering the city were seen rickety and lumbering
     wagons, made of poles, loaded with a mixed freight,--a few
     cabbages, a bundle of socks, a coop of tame ducks, a few barrels of
     turnips, a pot of butter, and a bag of beans,--with the proud and
     humane farmer driving the team, his wife behind in charge of the
     baby, while two or three little children contended with the boxes
     and barrels and bundles for room to sit or lie.
