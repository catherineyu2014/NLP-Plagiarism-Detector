      and in so doing had followed the example of Sir Henry Montague and
      others of his predecessors. The City had tried to get rid of
      Montague (in 1610) on the same grounds, but failed owing to the
      intervention of the king, who emphatically declared that in calling
      Montague to be a sergeant-at-law he intended a further mark of
      favour to him and to the City, and did not intend that he should
      lose his place.—Remembrancia (Index), p. 288.

      Cromwell had "dissolved" the House, was called to account six years
      later for venturing to use such a term, and his excuse that he had

 1080 Journal 41, fo. 100b.

 1081 With the exception of the parliament of 1284 it is doubtful if the
      City sent that number of burgesses to any other. As to the
      parliament of 1654, the names of five members only have come down to
      us (see Loftie’s "History of London," Appendix B). But that the city
      did send six members to this parliament is the more probable from
      the fact that in June, 1657, the Common Council prepared a petition
      to parliament praying to be allowed to send "their full number" of
      six burgesses "already chosen" to parliament.—Journal 41, fo. 156.
      Moreover, the fact that in March, 1653, the Common Council ordered a
      petition to be prepared for parliament "touching the number of
      future burgesses for this city in parliament," points to some
      probable alteration in the number of city members.—Id., 41, fo.

 1355 Journal 46, fos. 170b, 189. According to the evidence of the State
      Papers the king appears to have suggested Bolton’s appointment as
      surveyor-general by letters to the Common Council, dated the 31st
      May and the 5th June, 1667 (Cal. State Papers Dom., 1667, pp. 133,
      151). It does not, however, appear to have been considered by the
      Common Council until the 14th Sept. There may have been good reason
      for the City declining to place the mayor in such a responsible
      position of trust, for a few weeks later (3 Dec.) he was suspected
      of misappropriating money subscribed to assist the poor of the city,
      and pending enquiry was forbidden to attend the Court of Aldermen or
      any public function (Repertory 73, fos. 28b, 61, 93b, 95, 95b,
      107b). After bringing a charge against the Bishop of London in
      September, 1668, of misappropriating the sum of £50, and afterwards
      withdrawing, he was himself convicted in 1675 of having embezzled
      large sums of money intended for the poor (Repertory 73, fos. 260b,
      264, 292b, 303; Repertory 80, fo. 119b). Reduced to poverty, he was
      granted by the City an allowance of £3 a week, which after his
      decease was continued to his widow (Journal 49, fo. 100b).

      1631 by order of the Court of Aldermen "until he shall have
      presented to the court some fruits of his labours in that place"
      (Repertory 46, fo. 8); but it was renewed in 1634 at the
      intervention of the king (Repertory 48, fo. 433). Further

      Court of Aldermen considered the demand for a poll as to
      Pilkington’s election to be an invasion of the lord mayor’s
      prerogative, he being already in the opinion of the court duly
      elected and confirmed according to ancient usage. It passed a
      resolution, therefore, that before the poll was opened Alderman
      Pilkington should be immediately called out on the husting and
      returned into the exchequer as one of the sheriffs for the ensuing
      year (Repertory 86, fo. 153).

 M763 Papillon and Du Bois declared elected.

 1499 The fact of a poll having been taken on the 7th July is not
      mentioned in the Journal; Luttrell (who by the way is often wrong in
      his figures) gives the result of the poll thus, Papillon 2,754,
      Dubois 2,709, Box 1,609 and North 1,557 (Diary, i, 203).

 M764 Counsel’s opinion as to right of adjourning Common Hall.

 1500 Luttrell gives the names of Sir George Jeffreys, the late recorder,
      and Mr. Sanders as the counsel consulted by the lord mayor, and of
      Mr. Williams and Mr. Pollexfen for the sheriffs (Diary, i, 204).
      Another writer remarks that "it is to be observed that on reference
      to the recorder [Sir George Treby] upon this occasion by the Court
      of Aldermen he declared, without hesitation, that the full right of
      election was in the livery. The mode of taking the poll and of
      adjournment by the sheriffs was strictly consonant to ancient usage"
      (Norton, "Comment. History of London," 3rd ed., pp. 231-2). From a
      printed tract preserved in the Guildhall Library (A* No. 27)
      entitled "An Impartial Account of the Proceedings of the Common Hall
      of the City of London of Guildhall, June the 24th, 1682, for
      electing of sheriffs," it appears that the opinion of the recorder
      had been asked and delivered to the Court of Aldermen on the 23rd
      June.

      Many pieces of ordnance bore the arms of the several city companies
      of Fishmongers, Vintners and Merchant Taylors. One gun, the gift of
      the first-mentioned company, acquired the name of Roaring Meg from

      ought to have been first consulted on the matter. The merchants

      near kinsman of Sir Josiah Child, and sat for Colchester from 1689
      down to Queen Anne’s first parliament (Parliamentary Returns, 1878,

      Cook as presenting a very abject appearance at the Bar, imploring
      the Peers, "with tears and lamentations," not to subject him to "a
      species of torture unknown to the mild laws of England."

 1853 Stat. 7 and 8 Will. III, c. 1. By a subsequent Act (Stat. 7 and 8
      Will. III, c. 19) encouragement was given for bringing plate into
      the Mint to be coined. The exportation of all silver except foreign
      silver was prohibited, and certificates to the effect that silver
      about to be exported was foreign silver and not plate or clipt money
      had to be obtained in the city from the aldermen before exportation
      was allowed. Three volumes of these "bullion certificates" are
      preserved in the Town Clerk’s office.

 1854 Luttrell, iv, 55. It is said that the goldsmiths of the city had
      collected all the available paper of the Bank for the express
      purpose of presenting it for cash at a time when they knew full well
      that the Bank was short of milled money, hoping thereby to injure
      the credit of the institution which was ruining their business.

 1874 Luttrell, v, 100.

 M937 Sir William Gore elected mayor, Sept., 1701.

 1875 Evelyn (Diary, 11 June, 1696) writes of him as having been formerly
      a "mean goldsmith" and become rich by extortion.

      He had received a commission as alderman from James II in 1685, was
      discharged the following year, and in 1700, when he was sheriff, got
      himself elected alderman of Bridge Ward (Repertory 90, fo. 71; Id.
      91, fo. 83b; Id. 104, fo. 345). The city Journals of the period
      are very imperfect, and there are no Common Hall books of the day,
      but Luttrell gives us the result of the mayoralty election of 1700,
      when Duncombe promised to lay out £40,000 for the good of the city,
      or build a Mansion House for future mayors, and set up a brass
      statue of King William upon the Conduit in Cheapside, if only he
      were elected (Diary, iv, 660, 692).

 1882 Repertory 106, fos. 226, 235, 243, 321; Journal 53, fo. 382. The

      either in the Guildhall or Mansion House.

 M946 The queen entertained on lord mayor’s day, 29 Oct., 1702.

 1888 Luttrell, v, 220, 221. His election is not recorded in the City’s
      Journal. The minutes of the court of Common Council at this period
      were either very imperfectly written up, or if written up have been
      either lost or suppressed. It is scarcely possible that Journal 53
      can represent the whole of the municipal business transacted by the
      court between April, 1701, and February, 1704.

 M952 Meeting of the new parliament, 25 Oct., 1705.

 1913 Their names were Clayton, Ashurst, Heathcote and a new candidate in
      the person of Samuel Shepheard, the Tories who were put up in
      opposition being Sir John Fleet, Sir John Parsons, Sir William
      Withers and Sir Richard Hoare (Luttrell, v, 541-542, 543). Upon the
      death of Sir Robert Clayton in 1707 his seat was won by a Tory,
      viz., Sir William Withers, who was lord mayor at the time (Luttrell,
      vi, 236, 237). Withers had previously sat in the short parliament of
      1701 (Feb.-Nov.) in the Whig interest (Luttrell, iv, 721).

 1915 Stanhope ("Hist, of England," temp. Queen Anne, p. 216) gives the
      date as Sunday the 23rd May—the day of the month according to the
      new style. But he is wrong in stating that day to have been Sunday.
      The 12th May did fall on Sunday.
