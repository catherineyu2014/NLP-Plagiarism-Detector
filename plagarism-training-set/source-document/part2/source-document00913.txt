This consideration will also account for his conduct in not renewing his challenge after Scott's
offensive words. He had offered the man satisfaction and had been refused. No one is bound
to go on challenging a reluctant adversary. At all times Lockhart seems to have been perfectly
ready to back his opinion, as may be seen from a long affair which had happened earlier, in
connection with the "Baron Lauerwinkel" matter. There he had promptly come forward and in his
own name challenged the anonymous author of a pamphlet bearing the title of "Hypocrisy Unveiled."
The anonym had, like Scott, shirked, and had maintained his anonymity. (Lord Cockburn says
it was an open secret, but I do not know who he was.) Thereupon Lockhart took no further notice,
just as he did in the later matter, and I do not believe that a court of honour in any country
would find fault with him. At any rate, I think that we are entitled to know, much more definitely
than I have ever seen it stated, what the charge against him is. We may indeed blame him in
both these matters, and perhaps in others, for neglecting the sound rule that anonymous writing
should never be personal. If he did this, however, he is in the same box with almost every
writer for the press in his own generation, and with too many in this. I maintain that in each
case he promptly gave the guarantee which the honour of his time required, and which is perhaps
the only possible guarantee, that of being ready to answer in person for what he had written
impersonally. This was all he could do, and he did it.
