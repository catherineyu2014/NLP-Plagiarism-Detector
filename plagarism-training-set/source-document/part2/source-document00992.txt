EARLY EUROPEAN HISTORY

BY

HUTTON WEBSTER, PH.D.

"There is no part of history so generally useful as that which relates to
the progress of the human mind, the gradual improvement of reason, the
successive advances of science, the vicissitudes of learning and
ignorance, which are the light and darkness of thinking beings, the
extinction and resuscitation of arts, and the revolutions of the
intellectual world."
  --SAMUEL JOHNSON, Rasselas.

PREFACE

This book aims to furnish a concise and connected account of human progress during ancient,
medieval, and early modern times. It should meet the requirements of those high schools and
preparatory schools where ancient history, as a separate discipline, is being supplanted by
a more extended course introductory to the study of recent times and contemporary problems.
Such a course was first outlined by the Regents of the University of the State of New York
in their Syllabus for Secondary Schools, issued in 1910.

Since the appearance of the Regents' Syllabus the Committee of Five of the American Historical
Association has made its Report (1911), suggesting a rearrangement of the curriculum which
would permit a year's work in English and Continental history. Still more recently the Committee
on Social Studies of the Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education, in its Report
(1916) to the National Education Association has definitely recommended the division of European
history into two parts, of which the first should include ancient and Oriental civilization,
English and Continental history to approximately the end of the seventeenth century, and the
period of American exploration.

The first twelve chapters of the present work are based upon the author's Ancient History,
published four years ago. In spite of many omissions, it has been possible to follow without
essential modification the plan of the earlier volume. A number of new maps and illustrations
have been added to these chapters.

The selection of collateral reading, always a difficult problem in the secondary school, is
doubly difficult when so much ground must be covered in a single course. The author ventures,
therefore, to call attention to his Readings in Ancient History. Its purpose, in the words
of the preface, is "to provide immature pupils with a variety of extended, unified, and interesting
extracts on matters which a textbook treats with necessary, though none the less deplorable,
condensation." A companion volume, entitled Readings in Medieval and Modern History, will be
published shortly. References to both books are inserted in footnotes.

At the end of what has been a long and engrossing task, it becomes a pleasant duty to acknowledge
the help which has been received from teachers in school and college. Various chapters, either
in manuscript or in the proofs, have been read by Professor James M. Leake of Bryn Mawr College;
Professor J. C. Hildt of Smith College; Very Rev. Patrick J. Healy, Professor of Church History
in the Catholic University of America; Professor E. F. Humphrey of Trinity College; Dr. James
Sullivan, Director of the Division of Archives and History, State Dept. of Education of New
York; Constantine E. McGuire, Assistant Secretary General, International High Commission, Washington;
Miss Margaret E. McGill, of the Newton (Mass.) High School; and Miss Mabel Chesley, of the
Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn. The author would also express appreciation of the labors
of the cartographers, artists, and printers, to whose accuracy and skill every page of the
book bears witness.

SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY

PERIODICALS

All serious students of history should have access to the American Historical Review (N. Y.,
1895 to date, quarterly, $4.00 a year). This journal, the organ of the American Historical
Association, contains articles by scholars, critical reviews of all important works, and notes
and news. The History Teacher's Magazine is edited under the supervision of a committee of
the American Historical Association (Philadelphia, 1909 to date, monthly, $2.00 a year). Every
well-equipped school library should contain the files of the National Geographic Magazine (Washington,
1890 to date, monthly, $2.00 a year) and of Art and Archeology (Washington, 1914 to date, monthly,
$3.00 a year). These two periodicals make a special feature of illustrations.

WORKS ON THE STUDY AND TEACHING OF HISTORY

Useful books for the teacher's library include H. E. Bourne, The Teaching of History and Civics
in the Elementary and the Secondary School (N. Y., 1902, Longmans, Green, and Co., $1.50),
Henry Johnson, The Teaching of History (N. Y., 1915, Macmillan, $1.40), H. B. George, Historical
Evidence (N.Y., 1909, Oxford University Press, American Branch, 75 cents), Frederic Harrison,
The Meaning of History and Other Historical Pieces (New ed., N.Y., 1900, Macmillan, $1.75),
J. H. Robinson, The New History (N. Y., 1912, Macmillan, $1.50), and H. B. George, The Relations
of History and Geography (4th ed., N. Y., 1910, Oxford University Press, American Branch, $1.10).
The following reports are indispensable:

The Study of History in Schools. Report to the American Historical Association by the Committee
of Seven (N. Y., 1899, Macmillan, 50 cents).

The Study of History in Secondary Schools. Report to the American Historical Association by
a Committee of Five (N. Y., 1911, Macmillan, 25 cents).

Historical Sources in Schools. Report to the New England History Teachers' Association by a
Select Committee (N. Y., 1902, Macmillan, out of print).

A History Syllabus for Secondary Schools. Report by a Special Committee of the New England
History Teachers' Association (N. Y., 1904, Heath, $1.32).

A Bibliography of History for Schools and Libraries. Published under the auspices of the Association
of History Teachers of the Middle States and Maryland (2d ed., N. Y., 1915, Longmans, Green,
and Co., 60 cents).

DICTIONARIES AND ENCYCLOPEDIAS

The most useful dictionaries of classical antiquities are H. B. Walters, A Classical Dictionary
(N. Y., 1916, Putnam, $6.50) and H. T. Peck, Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and
Antiquities (N. Y., 1897, American Book Co., $6.00). Cambridge University, England, has published
A Companion to Greek Studies, edited by L. Whibley (2d ed., N. Y., 1906, Putnam, $6.00), and
A Companion to Latin Studies, edited by J. E. Sandys (N. Y., 1911, Putnam, $6.00). These two
volumes treat every phase of ancient life in separate essays by distinguished scholars. For
chronology, genealogies, lists of sovereigns, and other data the most valuable works are Arthur
Hassall, European History, 476-1910 (new ed., N. Y., 1910, Macmillan, $2.25), G. P. Putnam,
Tabular Views of Universal History (new ed., N. Y., 1915, Putnam, $2.50), and Karl J. Ploetz,
A Handbook of Universal History, translated by W. H. Tillinghast (Boston, 1915, Houghton Mifflin
Co., $3.00).

SYLLABI

The Illustrated Topics for Ancient History, arranged by D. C. Knowlton (Philadelphia, McKinley
Publishing Co., 65 cents), contain much valuable material in the shape of a syllabus, source
quotations, outline maps, pictures, and other aids. The following syllabi have been prepared
for collegiate instruction:

Botsford, G. W. A Syllabus of Roman History (N. Y., 1915, Macmillan, 50 cents).

Munro, D. C., and SELLERY, G. C. A Syllabus of Medieval History, 395- 1500 (N. Y., 1913, Longmans,
Green, and Co., $1.00).

Richardson, O. H. Syllabus of Continental European History from the Fall of Rome to 1870 (Boston,
1904, Ginn, boards, 75 cents).

Stephenson, Andrew. Syllabus of Lectures on European History (Terre Haute, Ind., 1897, Inland
Publishing Co., $1.50).

Thompson, J. W. Reference Studies in Medieval History (2d ed., Chicago, 1914, University of
Chicago Press, $1.25). A rich collection of classified references.

ATLASES

An admirable collection of maps for school use is W. R. Shepherd, Historical Atlas (N. Y.,
1911, Holt, $2.50), with about two hundred and fifty maps covering the historical field. The
latest and one of the best of the classical atlases is Murray's Small Classical Atlas, edited
by G. B. Grundy (N. Y., 1904, Oxford University Press, American Branch, $1.35). A special feature
of this work is the adoption of the system of colored contours to indicate configuration. The
Atlas of Ancient and Classical Geography in "Everyman's Library" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton, 35 cents)
might well be purchased by every student. Other valuable works are E. W. Dow, Atlas of European
History (N. Y., 1907, Holt, $1.50) and Ramsay Muir, A New School Atlas of Modern History (N.
Y., 1911, Holt, $1.25). Much use can be made of the inexpensive and handy Literary and Historical
Atlas of Europe by J. G. Bartholomew in "Everyman's Library" (N. Y., 1910, Dutton, 35 cents).

WALL MAPS AND CHARTS

Kiepert's New Wall Maps of Ancient History (Chicago, Rand, McNally, and Co.) and Johnston's
Classical Series (Chicago, A. J. Nystrom and Co.) may be obtained singly, mounted on common
rollers, or by sets in a case with spring rollers. The text is in Latin. The Spruner-Bretschneider
Historical Maps are ten in number, size 62 x 52 inches, and cover the period from A.D. 350
to 1815. The text is in German (Chicago, Nystrom, each $6.00; Rand, McNally, and Co., each
$6.50). Johnston's Maps of English and European History are sixteen in number, size 40 x 30
inches, and include four maps of ancient history (Chicago, Nystrom, each $2.50). A new series
of European History Maps, thirty-nine in number, size 44 x 32 inches, has been prepared for
the study of ancient history by Professors J. H. Breasted and C. F. Huth, and for medieval
and modern history by Professor S. B. Harding (Chicago, Denoyer-Geppert Co., complete set with
tripod stand, $52.00; in two spring roller cases, $73.00). These maps may also be had separately.
The maps in this admirable series omit all irrelevant detail, present place names in the modern
English form, and in choice of subject matter emphasize the American viewpoint. The school
should also possess good physical wall maps such as the Sydow-Habenicht or the Kiepert series,
both to be obtained from Rand, McNally, and Co. The text is in German. Phillips's Model Test
Maps and Johnston's New Series of Physical Wall Maps are obtainable from A. J. Nystrom and
Co. The only large charts available are those prepared by MacCoun for his Historical Geography
Charts of Europe. The two sections, "Ancient and Classical" and "Medieval and Modern," are
sold separately (N. Y., Silver, Burdett, and Co., $15.00). A helpful series of Blackboard Outline
Maps is issued by J. L. Engle, Beaver, Penn. These are wall maps, printed with paint on blackboard
cloth, for use with an ordinary crayon. Such maps are also sold by the Denoyer-Geppert Co.,
Chicago.

OUTLINE MAPS

The "Studies" following each chapter of this book include various exercises for which small
outline maps are required. Such maps are sold by D. C. Heath and Co., Boston, New York, Chicago.
Useful atlases of outline maps are also to be had of the McKinley Publishing Co., Philadelphia,
Atkinson, Mentzer and Grover, Chicago, W. B. Harison, New York City, and of other publishers.

ILLUSTRATIONS

The best photographs of ancient works of art must usually be obtained from the foreign publishers
in Naples, Florence, Rome, Munich, Paris, Athens, and London, or from their American agents.
Such photographs, in the usual size, 8 x 10 inches, sell, unmounted, at from 6 to 8 francs
a dozen. All dealers in lantern slides issue descriptive catalogues of a great variety of archaeological
subjects. In addition to photographs and lantern slides, a collection of stereoscopic views
is very helpful in giving vividness and interest to instruction in ancient history. An admirable
series of photographs for the stereoscope, including Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and Italy, is
issued by Underwood and Underwood, New York City. The same firm supplies convenient maps and
handbooks for use in this connection. The Keystone stereographs, prepared by the Keystone View
Company, Meadville, Penn., may also be cordially recommended. The architecture, costumes, amusements,
and occupations of the Middle Ages in England are shown in Longmans' Historical Illustrations
(six portfolios, each containing twelve plates in black-and-white, Longmans, Green, and Co.,
90 cents, each portfolio). The same firm issues Longmans' Historical Wall Pictures, consisting
of twelve colored pictures from original paintings illustrating English history (each picture,
separately, 80 cents; in a portfolio, $10.50). Other notable collections are Lehmann's Geographical
Pictures, Historical Pictures, and Types of Nations, and Cybulski's Historical Pictures (Chicago,
Denoyer-Geppert Co.; each picture separately mounted on rollers, $1.35 to $2.25). The New England
History Teachers' Association publishes a series of Authentic Pictures for Class Room Use,
size 5 x 8 inches, price 3 cents each. The Catalogue of the Collection of Historical Material
at Simmons College, prepared by the New England History Teachers' Association (2d ed., Boston,
1912, Houghton Mifflin Co., 25 cents), contains an extensive list of pictures, slides, models,
and other aids to history teaching. Among the more useful collections in book form of photographic
reproductions and drawings are the following:

CHAPTER I

THE AGES BEFORE HISTORY

1. THE STUDY OF HISTORY

SUBJECT MATTER OF HISTORY

History is the narrative of what civilized man has done. It deals with those social groups
called states and nations. Just as biography describes the life of individuals, so history
relates the rise, progress, and decline of human societies.

MANUSCRIPTS AND BOOKS

History cannot go back of written records. These alone will preserve a full and accurate account
of man's achievements. Manuscripts and books form one class of written records. The old Babylonians
used tablets of soft clay, on which signs were impressed with a metal instrument. The tablets
were then baked hard in an oven. The Egyptians made a kind of paper out of the papyrus, a plant
native to the Nile valley. The Greeks and Romans at first used papyrus, but later they employed
the more lasting parchment prepared from sheepskin. Paper seems to have been a Chinese invention.
It was introduced into Europe by the Arabs during the twelfth century of our era.

INSCRIPTIONS AND REMAINS

A second class of written records consists of inscriptions. These are usually cut in stone,
but sometimes we find them painted over the surface of a wall, stamped on coins, or impressed
upon metal tablets. The historian also makes use of remains, such as statues, ornaments, weapons,
tools, and utensils. Monuments of various sorts, including palaces, tombs, fortresses, bridges,
temples, and churches, form a very important class of remains.

BEGINNINGS OF HISTORY

History, based on written records, begins in different countries at varying dates. A few manuscripts
and inscriptions found in Egypt date back three or four thousand years before Christ. The annals
of Babylonia are scarcely less ancient. Trustworthy records in China and India do not extend
beyond 1000 B.C. For the Greeks and Romans the commencement of the historic period must be
placed about 750 B.C. The inhabitants of northern Europe did not come into the light of history
until about the opening of the Christian era.

2. PREHISTORIC PEOPLES

THE PREHISTORIC PERIOD

In studying the historic period our chief concern is with those peoples whose ideas or whose
deeds have aided human progress and the spread of civilization. Six-sevenths of the earth's
inhabitants now belong to civilized countries, and these countries include the best and largest
regions of the globe. At the beginning of historic times, however, civilization was confined
within a narrow area--the river valleys of western Asia and Egypt. The uncounted centuries
before the dawn of history make up the prehistoric period, when savagery and barbarism prevailed
throughout the world. Our knowledge of it is derived from the examination of the objects found
in caves, refuse mounds, graves, and other sites. Various European countries, including England,
France, Denmark, Switzerland, and Italy, are particularly rich in prehistoric remains.

THE TWO AGES

The prehistoric period is commonly divided, according to the character of the materials used
for tools and weapons, into the Age of Stone and the Age of Metals. The one is the age of savagery;
the other is the age of barbarism or semicivilization.

THE STONE AGE

Man's earliest implements were those that lay ready to his hand. A branch from a tree served
as a spear; a thick stick in his strong arms became a powerful club. Later, perhaps, came the
use of a hard stone such as flint, which could be chipped into the forms of arrowheads, axes,
and spear tips. The first stone implements were so rude in shape that it is difficult to believe
them of human workmanship. They may have been made several hundred thousand years ago. After
countless centuries of slow advance, savages learned to fasten wooden handles to their stone
tools and weapons and also to use such materials as jade and granite, which could be ground
and polished into a variety of forms. Stone implements continued to be made during the greater
part of the prehistoric period. Every region of the world has had a Stone Age. [1] Its length
is reckoned, not by centuries, but by milleniums.

THE AGE OF METALS

The Age of Metals, compared with its predecessor, covers a brief expanse of time. The use of
metals came in not much before the dawn of history. The earliest civilized peoples, the Babylonians
and Egyptians, when we first become acquainted with them, appear to be passing from the use
of stone implements to those of metal.

COPPER

Copper was the first metal in common use. The credit for the invention of copper tools seems
to belong to the Egyptians. At a very early date they were working the copper mines on the
peninsula of Sinai. The Babylonians probably obtained their copper from the same region. Another
source of this metal was the island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean. The Greek name
of the island means "copper."

BRONZE

But copper tools were soft and would not keep an edge. Some ancient smith, more ingenious than
his fellows, discovered that the addition of a small part of tin to the copper produced a new
metal--bronze--harder than the old, yet capable of being molded into a variety of forms. At
least as early as 3000 B.C. we find bronze taking the place of copper in both Egypt and Babylonia.
Somewhat later bronze was introduced into the island of Crete, then along the eastern coast
of Greece, and afterwards into other European countries.

IRON

The introduction of iron occurred in comparatively recent times. At first it was a scarce,
and therefore a very precious, metal. The Egyptians seem to have made little use of iron before
1500 B.C. They called it "the metal of heaven," as if they obtained it from meteorites. In
the Greek Homeric poems, composed about 900 B.C. or later, we find iron considered so valuable
that a lump of it is one of the chief prizes at athletic games. In the first five books of
the Bible iron is mentioned only thirteen times, though copper and bronze are referred to forty-four
times. Iron is more difficult to work than either copper or bronze, but it is vastly superior
to those metals in hardness and durability. Hence it gradually displaced them throughout the
greater part of the Old World. [2]

FIRST STEPS TOWARD CIVILIZATION

During the prehistoric period early man came to be widely scattered throughout the world. Here
and there, slowly, and with utmost difficulty, he began to take the first steps toward civilization.
The tools and weapons which he left behind him afford some evidence of his advance. We may
now single out some of his other great achievements and follow their development to the dawn
of history.

3. DOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS

HUNTING AND FISHING STAGE

Prehistoric man lived at first chiefly on wild berries, nuts, roots, and herbs. As his implements
improved and his skill increased, he became hunter, trapper, and fisher. A tribe of hunters,
however, requires an extensive territory and a constant supply of game. When the wild animals
are all killed or seriously reduced in number, privation and hardship result. It was a forward
step, therefore, when man began to tame animals as well as to kill them.

DOMESTICATION OF THE DOG

The dog was man's first conquest over the animal kingdom. As early as the Age of Metals various
breeds appear, such as deerhounds, sheep dogs, and mastiffs. The dog soon showed how useful
he could be. He tracked game, guarded the camp, and later, in the pastoral stage, protected
flocks and herds against their enemies.

THE COW

The cow also was domesticated at a remote period. No other animal has been more useful to mankind.
The cow's flesh and milk supply food: the skin provides clothing; the sinews, bones, and horns
yield materials for implements. The ox was early trained to bear the yoke and draw the plow,
as we may learn from ancient Egyptian paintings. [3] Cattle have also been commonly used as
a kind of money. The early Greeks, whose wealth consisted chiefly of their herds, priced a
slave at twenty oxen, a suit of armor at one hundred oxen, and so on. The early Romans reckoned
values in cattle (one ox being equivalent to ten sheep). Our English word "pecuniary" goes
back to the Latin pecus, or "herd" of cattle.

THE HORSE

The domestication of the horse came much later than that of the cow. In the early Stone Age
the horse ran wild over western Europe and formed an important source of food for primitive
men. This prehistoric horse, as some ancient drawings show, [4] was a small animal with a shaggy
mane and tail. It resembled the wild pony still found on the steppes of Mongolia. The domesticated
horse does not appear in Egypt and western Asia much before 1500 B.C. For a long time after
the horse was tamed, the more manageable ox continued to be used as the beast of burden. The
horse was kept for chariots of war, as among the Egyptians, or ridden bareback in races, as
by the early Greeks.

OTHER ANIMALS DOMESTICATED

At the close of prehistoric times in the Old World nearly all the domestic animals of to-day
were known. Besides those just mentioned, the goat, sheep, ass, and hog had become man's useful
servants. [5]

PASTORAL STAGE

The domestication of animals made possible an advance from the hunting and fishing stage to
the pastoral stage. Herds of cattle and sheep would now furnish more certain and abundant supplies
of food than the chase could ever yield. We find in some parts of the world, as on the great
Asiatic plains, the herdsman succeeding the hunter and fisher. But even in this stage much
land for grazing is required. With the exhaustion of the pasturage the sheep or cattle must
be driven to new fields. Hence pastoral peoples, as well as hunting and fishing folk, remained
nomads without fixed homes. Before permanent settlements were possible, another onward step
became necessary. This was the domestication of plants.

AGRICULTURAL STAGE

The domestication of plants marked almost as wonderful an advance as the domestication of animals.
When wild seedgrasses and plants had been transformed into the great cereals--wheat, oats,
barley, and rice--people could raise them for food, and so could pass from the life of wandering
hunters or shepherds to the life of settled farmers. There is evidence that during the Stone
Age some of the inhabitants of Europe were familiar with various cultivated plants, but agriculture
on a large scale seems to have begun in the fertile regions of Egypt and western Asia. [6]
Here first arose populous communities with leisure to develop the arts of life. Here, as has
been already seen, [7] we must look for the beginnings of history.

4. WRITING AND THE ALPHABET

PICTURE WRITING

Though history is always based on written records, the first steps toward writing are prehistoric.
We start with the pictures or rough drawings which have been found among the remains of the
early Stone Age. [8] Primitive man, however, could not rest satisfied with portraying objects.

He wanted to record thoughts and actions, and so his pictures tended to become symbols of ideas.
The figure of an arrow might be made to represent, not a real object, but the idea of an "enemy."
A "fight" could then be shown simply by drawing two arrows directed against each other. Many
uncivilized tribes still employ picture writing of this sort. The American Indians developed
it in most elaborate fashion. On rolls of birch bark or the skins of animals they wrote messages,
hunting stories, and songs, and even preserved tribal annals extending over a century.

SOUND WRITING; THE REBUS

A new stage in the development of writing was reached when the picture represented, not an
actual object or an idea, but a sound of the human voice. This difficult but all-important
step appears to have been taken through the use of the rebus, that is, writing words by pictures
of objects which stand for sounds. Such rebuses are found in prehistoric Egyptian writing;
for example, the Egyptian words for "sun" and "goose" were so nearly alike that the royal title,
"Son of the Sun," could be suggested by grouping the pictures of the sun and a goose. Rebus
making is still a common game among children, but to primitive men it must have been a serious
occupation.

WORDS AND SYLLABLES

In the simplest form of sound writing each separate picture or symbol stands for the sound
of an entire word. This method was employed by the Chinese, who have never given it up. A more
developed form of sound writing occurs when signs are used for the sounds, not of entire words,
but of separate syllables. Since the number of different syllables which the voice can utter
is limited, it now becomes possible to write all the words of a language with a few hundred
signs. The Japanese, who borrowed some of the Chinese symbols, used them to denote syllables,
instead of entire words. The Babylonians possessed, in their cuneiform [9] characters, signs
for about five hundred syllables. The prehistoric inhabitants of Crete appear to have been
acquainted with a somewhat similar system. [10]

LETTERS

The final step in the development of writing is taken when the separate sounds of the voice
are analyzed and each is represented by a single sign or letter. With alphabets of a few score
letters every word in a language may easily be written.

EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS

The Egyptians early developed such an alphabet. Unfortunately they never gave up their older
methods of writing and learned to rely upon alphabetic signs alone. Egyptian hieroglyphics
[11] are a curious jumble of object- pictures, symbols of ideas, and signs for entire words,
separate syllables, and letters. The writing is a museum of all the steps in the development
from the picture to the letter.

PHOENICIAN ALPHABET

As early, apparently, as the tenth century B.C. we find the Phoenicians of western Asia in
possession of an alphabet. It consisted of twenty-two letters, each representing a consonant.
The Phoenicians do not seem to have invented their alphabetic signs. It is generally believed
that they borrowed them from the Egyptians, but recent discoveries in Crete perhaps point to
that island as the source of the Phoenician alphabet.

DIFFUSION OF THE PHOENICIAN ALPHABET

If they did not originate the alphabet now in use, the Phoenicians did most to spread a knowledge
of it in other lands. They were bold sailors and traders who bought and sold throughout the
Mediterranean. Wherever they went, they took their alphabet. From the Phoenicians the Greeks
learned their letters. Then the Greeks taught them to the Romans, from whom other European
peoples borrowed them. [12]

5. PRIMITIVE SCIENCE AND ART

FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE

We have already seen that prehistoric men in their struggle for existence had gathered an extensive
fund of information. They could make useful and artistic implements of stone. They could work
many metals into a variety of tools and weapons. They were practical botanists, able to distinguish
different plants and to cultivate them for food. They were close students of animal life and
expert hunters and fishers. They knew how to produce fire and preserve it, how to cook, how
to fashion pottery and baskets, how to spin and weave, how to build boats and houses. After
writing came into general use, all this knowledge served as the foundation of science.

COUNTING AND MEASURING

We can still distinguish some of the first steps in scientific knowledge. Thus, counting began
with calculations on one's fingers, a method still familiar to children. Finger counting explains
the origin of the decimal system. The simplest, and probably the earliest, measures of length
are those based on various parts of the body. Some of our Indian tribes, for instance, employed
the double arm's length, the single arm's length, the hand width, and the finger width. Old
English standards, such as the span, the ell, and the hand, go back to this very obvious method
of measuring on the body.

CALCULATION OF TIME; THE CALENDAR

It is interesting to trace the beginnings of time reckoning and of that most important institution,
the calendar. Most primitive tribes reckon time by the lunar month, the interval between two
new moons (about twenty- nine days, twelve hours). Twelve lunar months give us the lunar year
of about three hundred and fifty-four days. In order to adapt such a year to the different
seasons, the practice arose of inserting a thirteenth month from time to time. Such awkward
calendars were used in antiquity by the Babylonians, Jews, and Greeks; in modern times by the
Arabs and Chinese. The Egyptians were the only people in the Old World to frame a solar year.
From the Egyptians it has come down, through the Romans, to us. [13]

EARLY DRAWING AND PAINTING

The study of prehistoric art takes us back to the early Stone Age. The men of that age in western
Europe lived among animals such as the mammoth, cave bear, and woolly-haired rhinoceros, which
have since disappeared, and among many others, such as the lion and hippopotamus, which now
exist only in warmer climates. Armed with clubs, flint axes, and horn daggers, primitive hunters
killed these fierce beasts and on fragments of their bones, or on cavern walls, drew pictures
of them. Some of these earliest works of art are remarkably lifelike.

EARLY ARCHITECTURE

A still later period of the Stone Age witnessed the beginnings of architecture. Men had begun
to raise huge dolmens which are found in various parts of the Old World from England to India.
They also erected enormous stone pillars, known as menhirs. Carved in the semblance of a human
face and figure, the menhir became a statue, perhaps the first ever made.

As we approach historic times, we note a steady improvement in the various forms of art. Recent
discoveries in Egypt, Greece, Italy, and other lands indicate that their early inhabitants
were able architects, often building on a colossal scale.

SIGNIFICANCE OF PREHISTORIC ART

Their paintings and sculptures prepared the way for the work of later artists. Our survey of
the origins of art shows us that in this field, as elsewhere, we must start with the things
accomplished by prehistoric men.

6. HISTORIC PEOPLES

RACES OF MAN

At the dawn of history the various regions of the world were already in the possession of many
different peoples. Such physical characteristics as the shape of the skull, the features, stature,
or complexion may serve to distinguish one people from another. Other grounds for distinction
are found in language, customs beliefs, and general intelligence.

CLASSIFICATION OF RACES

If we take complexion or color as the basis of classification, it is possible to distinguish
a few large racial groups. Each of these groups occupies, roughly speaking, its separate area
of the globe. The most familiar classification is that which recognizes the Black or Negro
race dwelling in Africa, the Yellow or Mongolian race whose home is in central and eastern
Asia, and the White or Caucasian race of western Asia and Europe. Sometimes two additional
divisions are made by including, as the Red race, the American Indians, and as the Brown race,
the natives of the Pacific islands.

THE WHITE RACE

These separate racial groups have made very unequal progress in culture. The peoples belonging
to the Black, Red, and Brown races are still either savages or barbarians, as were the men
of prehistoric times. The Chinese and Japanese are the only representatives of the Yellow race
that have been able to form civilized states. In the present, as in the past, it is chiefly
the members of the White race who are developing civilization and making history.

INDO-EUROPEANS AND SEMITES

Because of differences in language, scholars have divided the White or Caucasian race into
two main groups, called Indo-Europeans and Semites. [14] This classification is often helpful,
but the student should remember that Indo-European and Semitic peoples are not always to be
sharply distinguished because they have different types of language. There is no very clear
distinction in physical characteristics between the two groups. A clear skin, an oval face,
wavy or curly hair, and regular features separate them from both the Negro and the Mongolian.

PRINCIPAL INDO-EUROPEAN PEOPLES

The Indo-Europeans in antiquity included the Hindus of India, the Medes and Persians dwelling
on the plateau of Iran, the Greeks and Italians, and most of the inhabitants of central and
western Europe. All these peoples spoke related languages which are believed to be offshoots
from one common tongue. Likeness in language does not imply that all Indo-Europeans were closely
related in blood. Men often adopt a foreign tongue and pass it on to their children.

PRINCIPAL SEMITIC PEOPLES

The various Semitic nations dwelling in western Asia and Arabia were more closely connected
with one another. They spoke much the same type of language, and in physical traits and habits
of life they appear to have been akin. The Semites in antiquity included the Babylonians and
Assyrians, the Hebrews, Phoenicians, and Arabs.

PEOPLES OF UNCERTAIN RELATIONSHIP

At the opening of the historic period still other parts of the World were the homes of various
peoples who cannot be classed with certainty as either Indo-Europeans or Semites. Among these
were the Egyptians and some of the inhabitants of Asia Minor. We must remember that, during
the long prehistoric ages, repeated conquests and migrations mingled the blood of many different
communities. History, in fact, deals with no unmixed peoples.

FOOTNOTES

[1] There are still some savage peoples, for instance, the Australians, who continue to make
stone implements very similar to those of prehistoric men. Other primitive peoples, such as
the natives of the Pacific islands, passed directly from the use of stone to that of iron,
after this part of the world was opened up to European trade in the nineteenth century.

[2] Iron was unknown to the inhabitants of North America and South America before the coming
of the Europeans. The natives used many stone implements, besides those of copper and bronze.
The Indians got most of their copper from the mines in the Lake Superior region, whence it
was carried far and wide.

used it as a beast of burden, ate its flesh, and clothed themselves with its wool.

potato of Peru and Ecuador, Indian corn or maize, tobacco, the tomato, and manioc. From the
roots of the latter, the starch called tapioca is derived.

CHAPTER II

THE LANDS AND PEOPLES OF THE EAST TO ABOUT 600 B.C. [1]

7. PHYSICAL ASIA

GRAND DIVISIONS OF ASIA

Ancient history begins in the East--in Asia and in that part of Africa called Egypt, which
the peoples of antiquity always regarded as belonging to Asia. If we look at a physical map
of Asia, we see at once that it consists of two very unequal divisions separated by an almost
continuous mass of mountains and deserts. These two divisions are Farther and Nearer, or Eastern
and Western, Asia.

FARTHER ASIA

Farther Asia begins at the center of the continent with a series of elevated table-lands which
rise into the lofty plateaus, known as the "Roof of the World." Here two tremendous mountain
chains diverge. The Altai range runs out to the northeast and reaches the shores of the Pacific
near Bering Strait. The Himalaya range extends southeast to the Malay peninsula. In the angle
formed by their intersection lies the cold and barren region of East Turkestan and Tibet, the
height of which, in some places, is ten thousand feet above the sea. From these mountains and
plateaus the ground sinks gradually toward the north into the lowlands of West Turkestan and
Siberia, toward the east and south into the plains of China and India.

CHINA

The fertile territory of central China, watered by the two streams, Yangtse and Hoangho, was
settled at a remote period by barbarous tribes. The civilization which they slowly developed
in antiquity has endured with little change until the present day. The inhabitants of neighboring
countries, Korea, Japan, and Indo-China, owe much to this civilization. It has exerted slight
influence on the other peoples of Asia because the Chinese have always occupied a distant corner
of the continent, cut off by deserts and mountains from the lands on the west. As if these
barriers were not enough, they raised the Great Wall to protect their country from invasion.

Behind this mighty rampart the Chinese have lived secluded and aloof from the progress of our
western world. In ancient times China was a land of mystery.

INDIA

India was better known than China, especially its two great rivers, the Indus and the Ganges,
which flow to the southwest and southeast, respectively, and make this part of the peninsula
one of the most fertile territories on the globe. Such a land attracted immigrants. The region
now known as the Punjab, where the Indus receives the waters of five great streams, was settled
by light-skinned Indo-Europeans [2] perhaps as early as 2000 B.C. Then they occupied the valley
of the Ganges and so brought all northern India under their control.

INDIA AND THE WEST

India did not remain entirely isolated from the rest of Asia, The Punjab was twice conquered
by invaders from the West; by the Persians in the sixth century B.C., [3] and about two hundred
years later by the Greeks. [4] After the end of foreign rule India continued to be of importance
through its commerce, which introduced such luxuries as precious stones, spices, and ivory
among the western peoples.

NEARER ASIA

Nearer, or Western Asia, the smaller of the two grand divisions of the Asiatic continent, is
bounded by the Black and Caspian seas on the north, by the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian
Ocean on the south, eastward by the Indus River, and westward by the Mediterranean and the
Nile. Almost all the countries within this area played a part in the ancient history of the Orient.

COUNTRIES OF NEARER ASIA

The lofty plateaus of central Asia decline on the west into the lower but still elevated region
of Iran. The western part of Iran was occupied in antiquity by the kindred people known as
Medes and Persians. Armenia, a wild and mountainous region, is an extension to the northwest
of the Iranian table-land. Beyond Armenia we cross into the peninsula of Asia Minor, a natural
link between Asia and Europe. Southward from Asia Minor we pass along the Mediterranean coast
through Syria to Arabia. The Arabian peninsula may be regarded as the link between Asia and Africa.

INFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS

These five countries of Nearer Asia were not well fitted to become centers of early civilization.
They possessed no great rivers which help to bring people together, and no broad, fertile plains
which support a large population. Armenia, Asia Minor, and Syria were broken up into small
districts by chains of mountains. Iran and Arabia were chiefly barren deserts. But two other
divisions of Nearer Asia resembled distant India and China in the possession of a warm climate,
a fruitful soil, and an extensive river system. These lands were Babylonia and Egypt, the first
homes of civilized man.

8. BABYLONIA AND EGYPT

THE TIGRIS AND THE EUPHRATES

Two famous rivers rise in the remote fastnesses of Armenia--the Tigris and the Euphrates. As
they flow southward, the twin streams approach each other to form a common valley, and then
proceed in parallel channels for the greater part of their course. In antiquity each river
emptied into the Persian Gulf by a separate mouth. This Tigris-Euphrates valley was called
by the Greeks Mesopotamia, "the land between the rivers."

PRODUCTIONS OF BABYLONIA

Babylonia is a remarkably productive country. The annual inundation of the rivers has covered
its once rocky bottom with deposits of rich silt. Crops planted in such a soil, under the influence
of a blazing sun, ripen with great rapidity and yield abundant harvests. "Of all the countries
that we know," says an old Greek traveler, "there is no other so fruitful in grain." [5] Wheat
and barley were perhaps first domesticated in this part of the world. [6] Wheat still grows
wild there. Though Babylonia possessed no forests, it had the date palm, which needed scarcely
any cultivation. If the alluvial soil yielded little stone, clay, on the other hand, was everywhere.
Molded into brick and afterwards dried in the sun, the clay became adobe, the cheapest building
material imaginable.

BABYLONIA AN EARLY CENTER OF CIVILIZATION

In Babylonia Nature seems to have done her utmost to make it easy for People to gain a living.
We can understand, therefore, why from prehistoric times men have been attracted to this region,
and why it is here that we must look for one of the earliest seats of civilization. [7]

LOWER AND UPPER EGYPT

Egypt may be described as the valley of the Nile. Rising in the Nyanza lakes of central Africa,
that mighty stream, before entering Egypt, receives the waters of the Blue Nile near the modern
town of Khartum. From this point the course of the river is broken by a series of five rocky
rapids, misnamed cataracts, which can be shot by boats. The cataracts cease near the island
of Philae, and Upper Egypt begins. This is a strip of fertile territory, about five hundred
miles in length but averaging only eight miles in width. Not far from modern Cairo the hills
inclosing the valley fall away, the Nile divides into numerous branches, and Lower Egypt, or
the Delta, begins. The sluggish stream passes through a region of mingled swamp and plain,
and at length by three principal mouths empties its waters into the Mediterranean.

EGYPT THE GIFT OF THE NILE

Egypt owes her existence to the Nile. All Lower Egypt is a creation of the river by the gradual
accumulation of sediment at its mouths. Upper Egypt has been dug out of the desert sand and
underlying rock by a process of erosion centuries long. Once the Nile filled all the space
between the hills that line its sides. Now it flows through a thick layer of alluvial mud deposited
by the yearly inundation.

ANNUAL INUNDATION OF THE NILE

The Nile begins to rise in June, when the snow melts on the Abyssinian mountains. High-water
mark, some thirty feet above the ordinary level, is reached in September. The inhabitants then
make haste to cut the confining dikes and to spread the fertilizing water over their fields.
Egypt takes on the appearance of a turbid lake, dotted here and there with island villages
and crossed in every direction by highways elevated above the flood. Late in October the river
begins to subside and by December has returned to its normal level. As the water recedes, it
deposits that dressing of fertile vegetable mold which makes the soil of Egypt perhaps the
richest in the world. [8]

EGYPT AN EARLY CENTER OF CIVILIZATION

It was by no accident that Egypt, like Babylonia, became one of the first homes of civilized
men. Here, as there, every condition made it easy for people to live and thrive. Food was cheap,
for it was easily produced. The peasant needed only to spread his seed broadcast over the muddy
fields to be sure of an abundant return. The warm, dry climate enabled him to get along with
little shelter and clothing. Hence the inhabitants of this favored region rapidly increased
in number and gathered in populous towns and cities. At a time when most of their neighbors
were still in the darkness of the prehistoric age, the Egyptians had entered the light of history.

9. THE BABYLONIANS AND THE EGYPTIANS

INHABITANTS OF BABYLONIA

The earliest inhabitants of Babylonia of whom we know anything were a people called Sumerians.
They entered the Babylonian plain through the passes of the eastern mountains, three or four
thousand years before the Christian era. Here they formed a number of independent states, each
with its capital city, its patron god, and its king. After them came Semitic tribes from the
deserts of northern Arabia. The Semites mingled with the Sumerians and adopted Sumerian civilization.

HAMMURABI, KING OF BABYLONIA, ABOUT 2000 B.C.

Of all the early Babylonian kings the most famous was Hammurabi. Some inscriptions still remain
to tell how he freed his country from foreign invaders and made his native Babylon the capital
of the entire land. This city became henceforth the real center of the Euphrates valley, to
which, indeed, it gave its name. Hammurabi was also an able statesman, who sought to develop
the territories his sword had won. He dug great canals to distribute the waters of the Euphrates
and built huge granaries to store the wheat against a time of famine. In Babylon he raised
splendid temples and palaces. For all his kingdom he published a code of laws, the oldest in
the world. [9] Thus Hammurabi, by making Babylonia so strong and flourishing, was able to extend
her influence in every direction. Her only important rival was Egypt.

The origin of the Egyptians is not known with certainty. In physical characteristics they resembled
the native tribes of northern and inhabitants eastern Africa. Their language, however, shows
of Egypt close kinship to the Semitic tongues of western Asia and Arabia. It is probable that
the Egyptians, like the Babylonians, arose from the mingling of several peoples.

MENES, KING OF EGYPT, ABOUT 3400 B.C.

The history of Egypt commences with the union of the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt
under Menes. An ancient tradition made him the builder of Memphis, near the head of the Delta,
and the founder of the Egyptian monarchy. Scholars once doubted these exploits and even regarded
Menes himself as mythical. Recently, however, his tomb has been discovered. In the gray dawn
of history Menes appears as a real personage, the first of that line of kings, or "Pharaohs,"
who for nearly three thousand years ruled over Egypt.

THE PYRAMID KINGS, ABOUT 3000-2500 B.C.

Several centuries after Menes we reach the age of the kings who raised the pyramids. Probably
no other rulers have ever stamped their memory so indelibly on the pages of history as the
builders of these mighty structures. The most celebrated monarch of this line was the Pharaoh
whom the Greeks called Cheops. The Great Pyramid near Memphis, erected for his tomb, remains
a lasting witness to his power.

AFTER THE PYRAMID KINGS

For a long time after the epoch of the pyramid kings the annals of Egypt furnish a record of
quiet and peaceful progress. The old city of Memphis gradually declined in importance and Thebes
in Upper Egypt became the capital. The vigorous civilization growing up in Egypt was destined,
however, to suffer a sudden eclipse. About 1800 B.C. barbarous tribes from western Asia burst
into the country, through the isthmus of Suez, and settled in the Delta. The Hyksos, as they
are usually called, extended their sway over all Egypt. At first they ruled harshly, plundering
the cities and enslaving the inhabitants, but in course of time the invaders adopted Egyptian
culture and their kings reigned like native Pharaohs. The Hyksos are said to have introduced
the horse and military chariot into Egypt. A successful revolt at length expelled the intruders
and set a new line of Theban monarchs on the throne.

THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE

The overthrow of the Hyksos marked a new era in the history of Egypt. From a home-loving and
peaceful people the Egyptians became a warlike race, ambitious for glory. The Pharaohs raised
powerful armies and by extensive conquests created an Egyptian Empire, reaching from the Nile
to the Euphrates.

IMPERIAL SPLENDOR OF EGYPT

This period of the imperial greatness of Egypt is the most splendid in its history. An extensive
trade with Cyprus, Crete, and other Mediterranean Islands introduced many foreign luxuries.
The conquered territories in Syria paid a heavy tribute of the precious metals, merchandise,
and slaves. The forced labor of thousands of war captives enabled the Pharaohs to build public
works in every part on their realm. Even the ruins of these stupendous structures are enough
to indicate the majesty and power of ancient Egypt.

RAMESES II, ABOUT 1292-1225 B.C.

Of all the conquering Pharaohs none won more fame than Rameses II, who ruled for nearly seventy
years. His campaigns in Syria were mainly against the Hittites, a warlike people who had moved
southward from their home in Asia Minor and sought to establish themselves in the Syrian lands.
Rameses does not appear to have been entirely successful against his foes. We find him at length
entering into an alliance with "the great king of the Hittites," by which their dominion over
northern Syria was recognized. In the arts of peace Rameses achieved a more enduring renown.
He erected many statues and temples in various parts of Egypt and made Thebes, his capital,
the most magnificent city of the age.

DECLINE OF THE EGYPTIAN POWER

Rameses II was the last of the great Pharaohs. After his death the empire steadily declined
in strength. The Asiatic possessions fell away, never to be recovered. By 1100 B.C. Egypt had
been restricted to her former boundaries in the Nile valley. The Persians, in the sixth century,
brought the country within their own vast empire.

10. THE PHOENICIANS AND THE HEBREWS

THE PHOENICIANS

The Phoenicians were the first Syrian people to assume importance. Their country was a narrow
stretch of coast, about one hundred and twenty miles in length, seldom more than twelve miles
in width, between the Lebanon Mountains and the sea. This tiny land could not support a large
population. As the Phoenicians increased in numbers, they were obliged to betake themselves
to the sea. The Lebanon cedars furnished soft, white wood for shipbuilding, and the deeply
indented coast offered excellent harbors. Thus the Phoenicians became preeminently a race of
sailors. Their great cities, Sidon and Tyre, established colonies throughout the Mediterranean
and had an extensive commerce with every region of the known world.

THE HEBREWS

The Hebrews lived south of Phoenicia in the land of Canaan, west of the Jordan River Their
history begins with the emigration of twelve Hebrew tribes (called Israelites) from northern
Arabia to Canaan. In their new home the Israelites gave up the life of wandering shepherds
and became farmers. They learned from the Canaanites to till the soil and to dwell in towns
and cities.

PERIOD OF THE JUDGES

The thorough conquest of Canaan proved to be no easy task. At first the twelve Israelitish
tribes formed only a loose and weak confederacy without a common head. "In those days there
was no king in Israel, every man did what was right in his own eyes." [10] The sole authority
was that held by valiant chieftains and law-givers, such as Samson, Gideon, and Samuel, who
served as judges between the tribes and often led them in successful attacks upon their foes.
Among these were the warlike Philistines, who occupied the southwestern coast of Canaan. To
resist the Philistines with success it was necessary to have a king who could bring all the
scattered tribes under his firm, well-ordered rule.

REIGNS OF SAUL AND DAVID

In Saul, "a young man and a goodly," the warriors of Israel found a leader to unite them against
their enemies. His reign was passed in constant struggles with the Philistines. David, who
followed him, utterly destroyed the Philistine power and by further conquests extended the
boundaries of the new state. For a capital city he selected the ancient fortress of Jerusalem.
Here David built himself a royal palace and here he fixed the Ark, the sanctuary of Jehovah.
Jerusalem became to the Israelites their dearest possession and the center of their national life.

REIGN OF SOLOMON, ABOUT 955-925 B.C.

The reign of Solomon, the son and successor of David, was the most splendid period in Hebrew
history. His kingdom stretched from the Red Sea and the peninsula of Sinai northward to the
Lebanon Mountains and the Euphrates. With the surrounding peoples Solomon was on terms of friendship
and alliance. He married an Egyptian princess, a daughter of the reigning Pharaoh. He joined
with Hiram, king of Tyre, in trading expeditions on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. The same
Phoenician monarch supplied him with the "cedars of Lebanon," with which he erected at Jerusalem
a famous temple for the worship of Jehovah. A great builder, a wise administrator and governor,
Solomon takes his place as a typical Oriental despot, the most powerful monarch of the age.

SECESSION OF THE TEN TRIBES, ABOUT 925 B.C.

But the political greatness of the Hebrews was not destined to endure. The people were not
ready to bear the burdens of empire. They objected to the standing army, to the forced labor
on public buildings, and especially to the heavy taxes. The ten northern tribes seceded shortly
after Solomon's death and established the independent kingdom of Israel, with its capital at
Samaria. The two southern tribes, Judah and Benjamin, formed the kingdom of Judea, and remained
loyal to the successors of Solomon.

DECLINE OF THE HEBREW POWER

The two small Hebrew kingdoms could not resist their powerful neighbors. About two centuries
after the secession of the Ten Tribes, the Assyrians overran Israel. Judea was subsequently
conquered by the Babylonians. Both countries in the end became a part of the Persian Empire.

11. THE ASSYRIANS

GREATNESS OF ASSYRIA, 745-626 B.C.

Assyria, lying east of the Tigris River, was colonized at an early date by emigrants from Babylonia.
After the Assyrians freed themselves from Babylonian control, they entered upon a series of
sweeping conquests. Every Asiatic state felt their heavy hand. The Assyrian kings created a
huge empire stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean, and the
Nile. For the first time in Oriental history Mesopotamia and Egypt, with the intervening territory,
were brought under one government.

CHARACTER OF ASSYRIAN RULE

This unification of the Orient was accomplished only at a fearful cost. The records of Assyria
are full of terrible deeds--of towns and cities without number given to the flames, of the
devastation of fertile fields and orchards, of the slaughter of men, women, and children, of
the enslavement of entire nations. Assyrian monarchs, in numerous inscriptions, boast of the
wreck and ruin they brought to many flourishing lands.

SARGON II, 722-705 B.C.

The treatment of conquered peoples by the Assyrian rulers is well illustrated by their dealings
with the Hebrews. One of the mightiest monarchs was an usurper, who ascended the throne as
Sargon II. Shortly after his succession he turned his attention to the kingdom of Israel, which
had revolted. Sargon in punishment took its capital city of Samaria (722 B.C.) and led away
many thousands of the leading citizens into a lifelong captivity in distant Assyria. The Ten
Tribes mingled with the population of that region and henceforth disappeared from history.

SENNACHERIB, 705-681 B.C.

Sargon's son, Sennacherib, though not the greatest, is the best known of Assyrian kings. His
name is familiar from the many references to him in Old Testament writings. An inscription
by Sennacherib describes an expedition against Hezekiah, king of Judea, who was shut up "like
a caged bird in his royal city of Jerusalem." Sennacherib, however, did not capture the place.
His troops were swept away by a pestilence.

DOWNFALL OF ASSYRIA, 606 B.C.

Although Assyria recovered from this disaster, its empire rested on unstable foundations. The
subject races were attached to their oppressive masters by no ties save those of force. When
Assyria grew exhausted by its career of conquest, they were quick to strike a blow for freedom.
By the middle of the seventh century Egypt had secured her independence, and many other provinces
were ready to revolt. Meanwhile, beyond the eastern mountains, the Medes were gathering ominously
on the Assyrian frontier. The storm broke when the Median monarch, in alliance with the king
of Babylon, moved upon Nineveh and captured it. The city was utterly destroyed.

PARTITION OF ASSYRIA

After the conquest of the Assyrian Empire the victors proceeded to divide the spoils. The share
of Media was Assyria itself, together with the long stretch of mountain country extending from
the Persian Gulf to Asia Minor. Babylonia obtained the western half of the Assyrian domains,
including the Euphrates valley and Syria. Under its famous king, Nebuchadnezzar (604-561 B.C.),
Babylonia became a great power in the Orient. It was Nebuchadnezzar who brought the kingdom
of Judea to an end. He captured Jerusalem in 586 B.C., burned the Temple, and carried away
many Jews into captivity. The day of their deliverance, when Babylon itself should bow to a
foreign foe, was still far distant.

12. THE WORLD EMPIRE OF PERSIA

CYRUS THE GREAT, 553-529 B.C.

Not much earlier than the break-up of the Assyrian Empire, we find a new and vigorous people
pressing into western Iran. They were the Persians, near kinsmen of the Medes. Subjects at
first of Assyria, and then of Media, they regained their independence and secured imperial
power under a conquering king whom history knows as Cyrus the Great. In 553 B.C. Cyrus revolted
against the Median monarch and three years later captured the royal city of Ecbatana. The Medes
and Persians formed henceforth a united people.

CONQUEST OF LYDIA BY CYRUS, 546 B.C.

The conquest of Media was soon followed by a war with the Lydians, who had been allies of the
Medes. The throne of Lydia, a state in the western part of Asia Minor, was at this time held
by Croesus, the last and most famous of his line. The king grew so wealthy from the tribute
paid by Lydian subjects and from his gold mines that his name has passed into the proverb,
"rich as Croesus." He viewed with alarm the rising power of Cyrus and rashly offered battle
to the Persian monarch. Defeated in the open field, Croesus shut himself up in Sardis, his
capital. The city was soon taken, however, and with its capture the Lydian kingdom came to an end.

CAPTURE OF BABYLON, 539 B.C.

The downfall of Lydia prepared the way for a Persian attack on Babylonia. The conquest of that
country proved unexpectedly easy. In 539 B.C. the great city of Babylon opened its gates to
the Persian host. Shortly afterwards Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jewish exiles there
to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple, which Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed. With the
surrender of Babylon the last Semitic empire in the East came to an end. The Medes and Persians,
an Indo-European people, henceforth ruled over a wider realm than ever before had been formed
in Oriental lands.

CAMBYSES, 529-522 B.C.

Cyrus was followed by his son, Cambyses, a cruel but stronghanded despot. Cambyses determined
to add Egypt to the Persian dominions. His land army was supported by a powerful fleet, to
which the Phoenicians and the Greeks of Cyprus contributed ships. A single battle sufficed
to overthrow the Egyptian power and to bring the long rule of the Pharaohs to a close. [12]

DARIUS THE GREAT, 521-485 B.C.

The reign of Darius, the successor of Cambyses, was marked by further extensions of the frontiers.
An expedition to the distant East added to the empire the region of the Punjab, [13] along
the upper waters of the Indus. Another expedition against the wild Scythian tribes along the
Danube led to conquests in Europe and brought the Persian dominions close to those of the Greeks.
Not without reason could Darius describe himself in an inscription which still survives, as
"the great king, king of kings, king of countries, king of all men."

ORGANIZATION OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE

It was the work of Darius to provide for his dominions a stable government which should preserve
what the sword had won. The problem was difficult. The empire was a collection of many peoples
widely different in race, language, customs, and religion. Darius did not attempt to weld the
conquered nations into unity. As long as the subjects of Persia paid tribute and furnished
troops for the royal army, they were allowed to conduct their own affairs with little interference
from the Great King.

THE SATRAPAL SYSTEM

The entire empire, excluding Persia proper, was divided into twenty satrapies, or provinces,
each one with its civil governor, or satrap. The satraps carried out the laws and collected
the heavy tribute annually levied throughout the empire. In most of the provinces there were
also military governors who commanded the army and reported directly to the king. This device
of intrusting the civil and military functions to separate officials lessened the danger of
revolts against the Persian authority. As an additional precaution Darius provided special
agents whose business it was to travel from province to province and investigate the conduct
of his officials. It became a proverb that "the king has many eyes and many ears."

PERSIAN ROADS

Darius also established a system of military roads throughout the Persian dominions. The roads
were provided at frequent intervals with inns, where postmen stood always in readiness to take
up a letter and carry it to the next station. The Royal Road from Susa, the Persian capital,
to Sardis in Lydia was over fifteen hundred miles long; but government couriers, using relays
of fresh horses, could cover the distance within a week. An old Greek writer declares with
admiration that "there is nothing mortal more swift than these messengers." [14]

UNION OF THE EAST UNDER PERSIA

The political history of the East fitly ends with the three Persian conquerors, Cyrus, Cambyses,
and Darius, who thus brought into their huge empire every great state of Oriental antiquity.
Medes and Persians, Babylonians and Assyrians, Lydians, Syrians, and Egyptians--all were at
length united under a single dominion. In the reign of Darius this united Orient first comes
into contact with the rising power of the Greek states of Europe. So we may leave its history
here, resuming our narrative when we discuss the momentous conflict between Persia and Greece,
which was to affect the course, not alone of Persian or Greek, but of all European history. [15]

CHAPTER III

ORIENTAL CIVILIZATION [1]

13. SOCIAL CLASSES

REDISCOVERY OF THE ORIENT

Our present knowledge of the Orient has been gained within recent times. Less than a century
ago no one could read the written records of the Egyptians and Babylonians. The decipherment
of the Rosetta Stone, which contained an inscription in both Greek and hieroglyphics, led to
the understanding of Egyptian writing. Scholars later succeeded in interpreting the Babylonian
cuneiform script. Modern excavations in the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates have now
provided them with abundant material for study in the shape of books and inscriptions. As these
are gradually deciphered, new light is being thrown on all features of ancient Oriental civilization.

THE KING AS AUTOCRAT

The Oriental peoples, when their history opens, were living under the monarchical form of government.
The king, to his subjects, was the earthly representative of the god. Often, indeed, he was
himself regarded as divine. The belief in the king's divine origin made obedience to him a
religious obligation for his subjects. Every Oriental monarch was an autocrat. Every Oriental
monarchy was a despotism.

THE KING'S DUTIES

The king had many duties. He was judge, commander, and high priest, all in one. In time of
war, he led his troops and faced the dangers of the battle field. During intervals of peace,
he was occupied with a constant round of sacrifices, prayers, and processions, which could
not be neglected without exciting the anger of the gods. To his courtiers he gave frequent
audience, hearing complaints, settling disputes, and issuing commands. A conscientious monarch,
such as Hammurabi, who describes himself as "a real father to his people," must have been a
very busy man.

NOBLES AND PRIESTS

Besides the monarch and the royal family there was generally in Oriental countries an upper
class of landowners. In Egypt the Pharaoh was regarded as sole owner of the land. Some of it
he worked through his slaves, but the larger part he granted to his favorites, as hereditary
estates. Such persons may be called the nobles. The different priesthoods also had much land,
the revenues from which kept up the temples where they ministered. In Babylonia, likewise,
we find a priesthood and nobility supported by the income from landed property.

THE MIDDLE CLASS

The middle class included professional men, shopkeepers independent farmers, and skilled craftsmen.
Though regarded as inferiors, still they had a chance to rise in the world. If they became
rich, they might hope to enter the upper class as priests or government officials.

WORKMEN AND PEASANTS

No such hopes encouraged the day laborer in the fields or shops. His lot was bitter poverty
and a life of unending toil. If he was an unskilled workman, his wages were only enough to
keep him and his family. He toiled under overseers who carried sticks and used them freely.
"Man has a back," says an Egyptian proverb, "and only obeys when it is beaten." If the laborer
was a peasant, he could be sure that the nobles from whom he rented the land and the tax collectors
of the king would leave him scarcely more than a bare living.

SLAVES

At the very bottom of the social ladder were the slaves. Every ancient people possessed them.
At first they were prisoners of war, who, instead of being slaughtered, were made to labor
for their masters. At a later period people unable to pay their debts often became slaves.
The treatment of slaves depended on the character of the master. A cruel and overbearing owner
might make life a burden for his bondmen. Escape was rarely possible. Slaves were branded like
cattle to prevent their running away. Hammurabi's code [2] imposed the death penalty on anybody
who aided or concealed the fugitives. There was plenty of work for the slaves to perform--repairing
dikes, digging irrigation canals, and erecting vast palaces and temples. The servile class
in Egypt was not as numerous as in Babylonia, and slavery itself seems to have assumed there
a somewhat milder form.

14. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

FARMING

Such fruitful, well-watered valleys as those of the Nile and the Euphrates encouraged agricultural
life. Farming was the chief occupation. Working people, whether slaves or freemen, were generally
cultivators of the soil. All the methods of agriculture are pictured for us on the monuments.
We mark the peasant as he breaks up the earth with a hoe or plows a shallow furrow with a sharp-pointed
stick. We see the sheep being driven across sown fields to trample the seed into the moist
soil. We watch the patient laborers as with hand sickles they gather in the harvest and then
with heavy flails separate the chaff from the grain. Although their methods were very clumsy,
ancient farmers raised immense crops of wheat and barley. The soil of Egypt and Babylonia not
only supported a dense population, but also supplied food for neighboring peoples. These two
lands were the granaries of the East.

MANUFACTURING

Many industries of to-day were known in ancient Egypt and Babylonia. There were blacksmiths,
carpenters, stonecutters, workers in ivory, silver, and gold, weavers, potters, and glass blowers.
The creations of these ancient craftsmen often exhibit remarkable skill. Egyptian linens were
so wonderfully fine and transparent as to merit the name of "woven air." Babylonian tapestries,
carpets, and rugs enjoyed a high reputation for beauty of design and color. Egyptian glass
with its waving lines of different hues was much prized. Precious stones were made into beads,
necklaces, charms, and seals. The precious metals were employed for a great variety of ornaments.
Egyptian paintings show the goldsmiths at work with blowpipe and forceps, fashioning bracelets,
rings, and diadems, inlaying objects of stone and wood, or covering their surfaces with fine
gold leaf. The manufacture of tiles and glazed pottery was everywhere carried on. Babylonia
is believed to be the original home of porcelain. Enameled bricks found there are unsurpassed
by the best products of the present day.

TRADE

The development of the arts and crafts brought a new industrial class into existence. There
was now need of merchants and shopkeepers to collect manufactured products where they could
be readily bought and sold. The cities of Babylonia, in particular, became thriving markets.
Partnerships between tradesmen were numerous. We even hear of commercial companies. Business
life in ancient Babylonia wore, indeed, quite a modern look.

MONEY

Metallic money first circulated in the form of rings and bars. The Egyptians had small pieces
of gold--"cow gold"--each of which was simply the value of a full-grown cow. [3] It was necessary
to weigh the metal whenever a purchase took place. A common picture on the Egyptian monuments
is that of the weigher with his balance and scales. Then the practice arose of stamping each
piece of money with its true value and weight. The next step was coinage proper, where the
government guarantees, not only the weight, but also the genuineness of the metal.

COINAGE

The honor of the invention of coinage is generally given to the Lydians, whose country was
well supplied with the precious metals. As early as the eighth century B.C. the Lydian monarchs
began to strike coins of electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver. The famous Croesus,[4]
whose name is still a synonym for riches, was the first to issue coins of pure gold and silver.
The Greek neighbors of Lydia quickly adopted the art of coinage and so introduced it into Europe.
[5]

BANKING

The use of money as a medium of exchange led naturally to a system of banking. In Babylonia,
for instance, the bankers formed an important and influential class. One great banking house,
established at Babylon before the age of Sennacherib, carried on operations for several centuries.
Hundreds of legal documents belonging to this firm have been discovered in the huge earthenware
jars which served as safes. The Babylonian temples also received money on deposit and loaned
it out again, as do our modern banks. Knowledge of the principles of banking passed from Babylonia
to Greece and thence to ancient Italy and Rome.

15. COMMERCE AND TRADE ROUTES

ASIATIC COMMERCE

The use of the precious metals as money greatly aided the exchange of commodities between different
countries. The cities of the Tigris- Euphrates valley were admirably situated for commerce,
both by sea and land. They enjoyed a central position between eastern and western Asia. The
shortest way by water from India skirted the southern coast of Iran and, passing up the Persian
Gulf, gained the valley of the two great rivers. Even more important were the overland roads
from China and India which met at Babylon and Nineveh. Along these routes traveled long lines
of caravans laden with the products of the distant East--gold and ivory, jewels and silks,
tapestries, spices, and fine woods. Still other avenues of commerce radiated to the west and
entered Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt. Many of these trade routes are in use even to-day.

COMMERCE WITH EUROPE

While the inhabitants of Babylonia and Assyria were able to control the caravan routes of Asia,
it was reserved for a Syrian people, the Phoenicians, to become the pioneers of commerce with
Europe. As early as 1500 B.C. the rich copper mines of Cyprus attracted Phoenician colonists
to this island. [6] From Cyprus these bold mariners and keen business men passed to Crete,
thence along the shores of Asia Minor to the Greek mainland, and possibly to the Black Sea.
Some centuries later the Phoenicians were driven from these regions by the rising power of
the Greek states. Then they sailed farther westward and established their trading posts in
Sicily, Africa, and Spain. At length they passed through the strait of Gibraltar into the Atlantic
and visited the shores of western Europe and Africa.

PHOENICIAN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS

The Phoenicians obtained a great variety of products from their widely scattered settlements.
The mines of Spain yielded tin, lead, and silver. The tin was especially valuable because of
its use in the manufacture of bronze. [7] From Africa came ivory, ostrich feathers, and gold;
from Arabia, incense, perfumes, and costly spices. The Phoenicians found a ready sale for these
commodities throughout the East. Still other products were brought directly to Phoenicia to
provide the raw materials for her flourishing manufactures. The fine carpets and glassware,
the artistic works in silver and bronze, and the beautiful purple cloths [8] produced by Phoenician
factories were exported to every region of the known world.

PHOENICIAN VOYAGES OF EXPLORATION

The Phoenicians were the boldest sailors of antiquity. Some of their long voyages are still
on record. We learn from the Bible that they made cruises on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean and
brought the gold of Ophir-- "four hundred and twenty talents"--to Solomon. [9] There is even
a story of certain Phoenicians who, by direction of an Egyptian king, explored the eastern
coast of Africa, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and after three years' absence returned to
Egypt through the strait of Gibraltar. A much more probable narrative is that of the voyage
of Hanno, a Carthaginian admiral. We still possess a Greek translation of his interesting log
book. It describes an expedition made about 500 B.C. along the western coast of Africa. The
explorers seem to have sailed as far as the country now called Sierra Leone. Nearly two thousand
years elapsed before a similar voyage along the African coast was undertaken.

PHOENICIAN SETTLEMENTS

Wherever the Phoenicians journeyed, they established settlements. Most of these were merely
trading posts which contained the warehouses for the storage of their goods. Here the shy natives
came to barter their raw materials for the finished products--cloths, tools, weapons, wine,
and oil--which the strangers from the East had brought with them. Phoenician settlements sometimes
grew to be large and flourishing cities. The colony of Gades in southern Spain, mentioned in
the Old Testament as Tarshish, [10] survives to this day as Cadiz. The city of Carthage, founded
in North Africa by colonists from Tyre, became the commercial mistress of the Mediterranean.
Carthaginian history has many points of contact with that of the Greeks and Romans.

16. LAW AND MORALITY

BABYLONIAN CONTRACTS

It is clear that societies so highly organized as Phoenicia, Egypt, and Babylonia must have
been held together by the firm bonds of law. The ancient Babylonians, especially, were a legal-minded
people. When a man sold his wheat, bought a slave, married a wife, or made a will, the transaction
was duly noted on a contract tablet, which was then filed away in the public archives. Instead
of writing his name, a Babylonian stamped his seal on the wet clay of the tablet. Every man
who owned property had to have a seal.

CODE OF HAMMURABI

The earliest laws were, of course, unwritten. They were no more than the long-established customs
of the community. As civilization advanced, the usages that generally prevailed were written
out and made into legal codes. A recent discovery has given to us the almost complete text
of the laws which Hammurabi, the Babylonian king, ordered to be engraved on stone monuments
and set up in all the chief cities of his realm. [11]

SUBJECT MATTER OF HAMMURABI'S CODE

The code of Hammurabi shows, in general, a high sense of justice. A man who tries to bribe
a witness or a judge is to be severely punished. A farmer who is careless with his dikes and
allows the water to run through flood his neighbor's land must restore the value of the grain
he has damaged. The owner of a vicious ox which has gored a man must pay a heavy fine, provided
he knew the disposition of the animal and had not blunted its horns. A builder who puts up
a shaky house which afterwards collapses and kills the tenant is himself to be put to death.
On the other hand, the code has some rude features. Punishments were severe. For injuries to
the body there was the simple rule of retaliation: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
a limb for a limb. A son who had struck his father was to have his hands cut off. The nature
of the punishment depended, moreover, on the rank of the aggrieved party. A person who had
caused the loss of a "gentleman's" eye was to have his own plucked out; but if the injury was
done to a poor man, the culprit had only to pay a fine.

IMPORTANCE OF HAMMURABI'S CODE

Hammurabi's laws thus present a vivid picture of Oriental society two thousand years before
Christ. They always remained the basis of the Babylonian and Assyrian legal system. They were
destined, also, to exert considerable influence upon Hebrew legislation. Centuries after Hammurabi
the enactments of the old Babylonian king were reproduced in some of the familiar regulations
of the laws of Moses. In this way they became the heritage of the Hebrews and, through them,
of our modern world.

THE MOSAIC CODE

The laws which we find in the earlier books of the Bible were ascribed by the Hebrews to Moses.
These laws covered a wide range of topics. They fixed all religious ceremonies, required the
observance every seventh day of the Sabbath, dealt with marriage and the family, stated the
penalties for wrongdoing, gave elaborate rules for sacrifices, and even indicated what foods
must be avoided as "unclean." No other ancient people possessed so elaborate a code. The Jews
throughout the world obey, to this day, its precepts. And modern Christendom still recites
the Ten Commandments, the noblest summary of the rules of right living that has come down to
us from the ancient world.

17. RELIGION

NATURE WORSHIP

Oriental ideas of religion, even more than of law and morality, were the gradual outgrowth
of beliefs held by the Asiatic peoples in prehistoric times. Everywhere nature worship prevailed.
The vault of heaven, earth and ocean, sun, moon, and stars were all regarded either as themselves
divine or as the abode of divinities. The sun was an object of especial adoration. We find
a sun god, under different names, in every Oriental country.

BABYLONIAN BELIEF IN EVIL SPIRITS

Another inheritance from prehistoric times was the belief in evil spirits. In Babylonia and
Assyria this superstition became a prominent feature of the popular religion. Men supposed
themselves to be constantly surrounded by a host of demons which caused insanity, sickness,
disease, and death-- all the ills of life. People lived in constant fear of offending these
malignant beings.

MAGIC

To cope with evil spirits the Babylonian used magic. He put up a small image of a protecting
god at the entrance to his house and wore charms upon his person. If he felt ill, he went to
a priest, who recited a long incantation supposed to drive out the "devil" afflicting the patient.
The reputation of the Babylonian priests was so widespread that in time the name "Chaldean"
[12] came to mean one who is a magician. Some of their magical rites were borrowed by the Jews,
and later by the Romans, from whom they entered Christian Europe. Another Babylonian practice
which spread westward was that of divination, particularly by inspecting the entrails of animals
slain in sacrifice. This was a very common method of divination among the Greeks and Romans. [13]

ASTROLOGY

Astrology received much attention. It was believed that the five planets, comets, and eclipses
of the sun and moon exerted an influence for good or evil on the life of man. Babylonian astrology
likewise extended to western lands and became popular among the Greeks and Romans. Some of
it survives to the present time. When we name the days Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, we are
unconscious astrologers, for in old belief the first day belonged to the planet Saturn, the
second to the sun, and the third to the moon. [14] Superstitious people who try to read their
fate in the stars are really practicing an art of Babylonian origin.

EGYPTIAN ANIMAL WORSHIP

Less influential in later times was the animal worship of the Egyptians. This, too, formed
a heritage from the prehistoric past. Many common animals of Egypt--the cat, hawk, the jackal,
the bull, the ram, the crocodile--were highly reverenced. Some received worship because deities
were supposed to dwell in them. The larger number, however, were not worshiped for themselves,
but as symbols of different gods.

MONOTHEISM IN PERSIA

In the midst of such an assemblage of nature deities, spirits, and sacred animals, it was remarkable
that the belief in one god should ever have arisen. The Medes and Persians accepted the teachings
of Zoroaster, a great prophet who lived perhaps as early as 1000 B.C. According to Zoroaster,
Ahuramazda, the heaven-deity, is the maker and upholder of the universe. He is a god of light
and order, of truth and purity. Against him stands Ahriman, the personification of darkness
and evil. Ahuramazda in the end will overcome Ahriman and will reign supreme in a righteous
world. Zoroastrianism was the only monotheistic religion developed by an Indo- European people.
[15]

HEBREW MONOTHEISM

The Hebrews, alone among the Semitic peoples of antiquity, were to develop the worship of their
god, Jehovah, into a lasting monotheism. This was a long and gradual process Jehovah was at
first regarded as the peculiar divinity of the Hebrews. His worshipers did not deny the existence
of the gods of other nations. From the eighth century onward this narrow conception of Jehovah
was transformed by the labors of the Hebrew prophets. They taught that Jehovah was the creator
and ruler of the world and the loving father of all mankind. On Hebrew monotheism two world
religions have been founded--Mohammedanism and Christianity.

EGYPTIAN IDEAS OF THE FUTURE LIFE

We do not find among the early Hebrews or any other Oriental people very clear ideas about
the life after death. The Egyptians long believed that the soul of the dead man resided in
or near the tomb, closely associated with the body. This notion seems to have first led to
the practice of embalming the corpse, so that it might never suffer decay. If the body was
not preserved, the soul might die, or it might become a wandering ghost, restless and dangerous
to the living. Later Egyptian thought regarded the future state as a place of rewards and punishments.
One of the chapters of the work called the Book of the Dead describes the judgment of the soul
in the spirit world. If a man in the earthly life had not murdered, stolen, coveted the property
of others, blasphemed the gods, borne false witness, ill treated his parents, or committed
certain other wrongs, his soul would enjoy a blissful immortality.

BABYLONIAN AND HEBREW IDEAS OF THE FUTURE LIFE

Some Oriental peoples kept the primitive belief that after death all men, good and bad alike,
suffered the same fate. The Babylonians supposed that the souls of the departed passed a cheerless
existence in a gloomy and Hebrew underworld. The early Hebrew idea of Sheol, "the land of darkness
and the shadow of death," [16] was very similar. Such thoughts of the future life left nothing
for either fear or hope. In later times, however, the Hebrews came to believe in the resurrection
of the dead and the last judgment, conceptions afterwards adopted by Christianity.

18. LITERATURE AND ART

THE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD

Religion inspired the largest part of ancient literature. Each Oriental people possessed sacred
writings. The Egyptian Book of the Dead was already venerable in 3000 B.C. It was a collection
of hymns, prayers, and magical phrases to be recited by the soul on its journey beyond the
grave and in the spirit world. A chapter from this work usually covered the inner side of the
mummy case.

THE BABYLONIAN EPICS

Much more interesting are the two Babylonian epics, fragments of which were found on clay tablets
in a royal library at Nineveh. The epic of the Creation tells how the god Marduk overcame a
terrible dragon, the symbol of primeval chaos, and thus established order in the universe.
Then with half the body of the dead dragon he made a covering for the heavens and set therein
the stars. Next he caused the new moon to shine and made it the ruler of the night. His last
work was the creation of man, in order that the service and worship of the gods might be established
forever. The second epic contains an account of a flood, sent by the gods to punish sinful
men. The rain fell for six days and nights and covered the entire earth. All men were drowned
except the Babylonian Noah, his family, and his relatives, who safely rode the waters in an
ark. This ancient narrative so closely resembles the Bible story in Genesis that we must trace
them both to a common source.

THE HEBREW BIBLE

All these writings are so ancient that their very authors are forgotten. The interest they
excite is historical rather than literary. From Oriental antiquity only one great work has
reached us that still has power to move the hearts of men--the Hebrew Bible.

EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE

Architecture, in Egypt, was the leading art. The Egyptians were the first people who learned
to raise buildings with vast halls supported by ponderous columns. Their wealth and skill,
however, were not lavished in the erection of fine private mansions or splendid public buildings.
The characteristic works of Egyptian architecture are the tombs of the kings and the temples
of the gods. The picture of the great structure at Thebes, which Rameses II completed, [17]
will give some idea of an Egyptian temple with its gateways, open courts, obelisks, and statues.

ARCHITECTURE IN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA

The architecture of Babylonia and Assyria was totally unlike that of Egypt, because brick,
and not stone, formed the chief building and Assyria material. In Babylonia the temple was
a solid, square tower, built on a broad platform. It consisted usually of seven stages, which
arose one above the other to the top, where the shrine of the deity was placed. The different
stages were connected by an inclined ascent. The four sides of the temple faced the cardinal
points, and the several stages were dedicated to the sun, moon, and five planets. In Assyria
the characteristic building was the palace. But the sun-dried bricks, of which both temples
and palaces were composed, lacked the durability of stone and have long since dissolved into
shapeless mounds.

EGYPTIAN SCULPTURE

The surviving examples of Egyptian sculpture consist of bas-reliefs and figures in the round,
carved from limestone and granite or cast in bronze. Many of the statues appear to our eyes
very stiff and ungraceful. The sculptor never learned how to pose his figures easily or how
to arrange them in an artistic group. In spite of these defects some Egyptian statues are wonderfully
lifelike. [18]

SCULPTURE IN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA

Few examples have reached us of Babylonian and Assyrian sculpture in the round. As in Egypt,
the figures seem rigid and out of proportion. The Assyrian bas-reliefs show a higher development
of the artistic sense, especially in the rendering of animals. The sculptures that deal with
the exploits of the kings in war and hunting often tell their story in so graphic a way as
to make up for the absence of written records.

ORIENTAL PAINTING

Painting in the ancient East did not reach the dignity of an independent art. It was employed
solely for decorative purposes. Bas-reliefs and wall surfaces were often brightly colored,
The artist had no knowledge of perspective and drew all his figures in profile, without any
distinction of light and shade. Indeed, Oriental painting, as well as Oriental sculpture, made
small pretense to the beautiful. Beauty was born into the world with the art of the Greeks.

19. SCIENCE AND EDUCATION

ARITHMETIC AND GEOMETRY

Conspicuous advance took place in the exact sciences. The leading operations of arithmetic
were known. A Babylonian tablet gives a table of squares and cubes correctly calculated from
1 to 60. The number 12 was the basis of all reckonings. The division of the circle into degrees,
minutes, and seconds (360 deg., 60', 60") was an invention of the Babylonians which illustrates
this duodecimal system A start was made in geometry. One of the oldest of Egyptian books contains
a dozen geometrical problems. This knowledge was afterwards developed into a true science by
the Greeks.

ASTRONOMY

In both Egypt and Babylonia the cloudless skies and still, warm nights early led to astronomical
research. At a remote period, perhaps before 4000 B.C., the Egyptians framed a solar calendar,
[19] consisting of twelve months, each thirty days in length, with five extra days at the end
of the year. This calendar was taken over by the Romans, [20] who added the system of leap
years. The Babylonians made noteworthy progress in some branches of astronomy. They were able
to trace the course of the sun through the twelve constellations of the zodiac and to distinguish
five of the planets from the fixed stars. The successful prediction of eclipses formed another
Babylonian achievement. Such astronomical discoveries must have required much patient and accurate
observation.

GEOGRAPHY

Geographical ideas for a long time were very crude. An ancient map, scratched on clay, indicates
that about eight centuries before Christ the Babylonians had gained some knowledge, not only
of their own land, but even of regions beyond the Mediterranean. The chief increase in man's
knowledge of the world in ancient times was due to the Phoenicians. [21]

PRACTICAL SCIENCES

The skill of Oriental peoples as mechanics and engineers is proved by their success as builders.
The great pyramids exactly face the points of the compass. The principle of the round arch
was known in Babylonia at a remote period The transportation of colossal stone monuments exhibits
a knowledge of the lever, pulley, and inclined plane. [22] Babylonian inventions were the sundial
and the water clock, the one to register the passage of the hours by day, the other by night.
The Egyptians and Babylonians also made some progress in the practice of medicine.

THE TEMPLE SCHOOL

The schools, in both Egypt and Babylonia, were attached to the temples and were conducted by
the priests. Writing was the chief subject of instruction. It took many years of patient study
to master the cuneiform symbols or the even more difficult hieroglyphics. "He who would excel
in the school of the scribes," ran an ancient maxim, "must rise with the dawn." Writing was
learned by imitating the examples supplied in copy- books. Some of the model letters studied
by Egyptian boys of the twentieth century B.C. have come down to us. Reading, too, was an art
not easy to learn. Dictionaries and grammars were written to aid the beginner. A little instruction
was also provided in counting and calculating.

THE SCRIBES

Having learned to read and write, the pupil was ready to enter on the coveted career of a scribe.
In a community where nearly every one was illiterate, the scribes naturally held an honorable
place. They conducted the correspondence of the time. When a man wished to send a letter, he
had a scribe write it, signing it himself by affixing his seal. When he received a letter,
he usually employed a scribe to read it to him. The scribes were also kept busy copying books
on the papyrus paper or clay tablets which served as writing materials.

THE TEMPLE LIBRARY

Every large city of Babylonia possessed a collection of books. Several of the larger libraries
have been discovered. At Nippur, in Babylonia, thirty thousand clay tablets were found. Another
great collection of books was unearthed in a royal palace at Nineveh. This Assyrian library
seems to have been open for the general use of the king's subjects. The Egyptians also had
their libraries, usually as adjuncts to the temples, and hence under priestly control.

WIDESPREAD POPULAR IGNORANCE

Learning and education were so closely limited to a few individuals that the mass of the people
were sunk in deepest ignorance. Men could not pursue knowledge for themselves, but had to accept
every thing on authority. Hence the inhabitants of Oriental lands remained a conservative folk,
slow to abandon their time-honored beliefs and very unwilling to adopt a new custom even when
clearly better than the old. This absence of popular education, more than anything else, made
Oriental civilization unprogressive.

CHAPTER IV

THE LANDS OF THE WEST AND THE RISE OF GREECE TO ABOUT 500 B.C. [1]

20. PHYSICAL EUROPE

EUROPE A PENINSULA OF ASIA

The continent of Asia, projecting its huge bulk southwestward between the seas, gradually narrows
into the smaller continent of Europe. The boundary between the two regions is not well defined.
Ancient geographers found a convenient dividing line north of the Black Sea in the course of
the river Don. Modern map makers usually place the division at the Ural Mountains, the Caspian
Sea, and the Caucasus. Each of these boundaries is more or less arbitrary. In a geographical
sense Europe is only the largest of the great Asiatic peninsulas.

PHYSICAL FEATURES OF EUROPE

But in physical features the two continents disclose the most striking contrasts. The sea,
which washes only the remote edges of Asia, penetrates deeply into Europe and forms an extremely
irregular coast line with numerous bays and harbors. The mountains of Europe, seldom very high
and provided with easy passes, present no such barriers to intercourse as the mightier ranges
of Asia. We miss in Europe the extensive deserts and barren table-lands which form such a feature
of Asiatic geography. With the exception of Russia the surface, generally, is distributed into
plains, hills, and valleys of moderate size. Instead of a few large rivers, such as are found
in Asia, Europe is well supplied with numerous streams that make it possible to travel readily
from one district to another.

CENTRAL AND NORTHERN EUROPE

The almost unbroken mountain chain formed by the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Balkans, sharply
separates the central land mass of Europe from the regions to the south. Central Europe consists,
in general, of lowlands, which widen eastward into the vast Russian plain. Northern Europe
includes the British Isles, physically an extension of Europe, and the peninsulas of Scandinavia
and Finland, between the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Twenty centuries ago central and
northern Europe was a land of forests and marshes, of desolate steppes and icebound hills.
The peoples who inhabited it--Celts in the west, Teutons or Germans in the north, Slavs in
the east --were men of Indo-European [2] race and speech. They were still barbarians. During
ancient times we hear little of them, except as their occasional migrations southward brought
them into contact with the Greeks and the Romans.

SOUTHERN EUROPE

Southern Europe comprises the three peninsulas of Spain, Italy, and the Balkans, which reach
far south into the Mediterranean. This great inland sea is divided into two parts near the
center, where Africa and the island of Sicily almost touch each other across a narrow strait.
The eastern part contains several minor seas, of which the one called the Aegean had most importance
in Greek history.

21. GREECE AND THE AEGEAN

THE AEGEAN SEA

The Aegean is an almost landlocked body of water. The Balkan peninsula, narrowing toward the
Mediterranean into the smaller peninsula of Greece, confines it on the west. On the east it
meets a boundary in Asia Minor. The southern boundary is formed by a chain of islands, while
the only opening northward is found in the narrow passage leading to the Black Sea. The coasts
and islands of the Aegean thus make up a little world set off by itself.

CONTINENTAL GREECE

Continental Greece is a tiny country. Its greatest length is scarcely more than two hundred
and fifty miles; its greatest breadth is only one hundred and eighty miles. Mountain ridges,
offshoots of the Balkans, compose the greater part of its area. Into the valleys and deep gorges
of the interior the impetuous sea has everywhere forced a channel. The coast line, accordingly,
is most irregular--a constant succession of sharp promontories and curving bays. The mountains,
crossing the peninsula in confused masses, break it up into numberless valleys and glens which
seldom widen into plains. The rivers are not navigable. The few lakes, hemmed in by the hills,
have no outlets except in underground channels. In this land of the Greeks no place is more
than fifty miles from a mountain range, or more than forty miles from some long arm of the
Mediterranean.

THE AEGEAN ISLANDS

From the Greek mainland to the coast of Asia Minor the traveler follows a route thickly studded
with rocky islands. They are near enough together to permit the passage from one to another
without losing sight of land. The Aegean islands thus served as "stepping-stones" between Greece
and Asia Minor. [3]

WESTERN ASIA MINOR

Western Asia Minor resembles Continental Greece in its deeply indented coast, variety of scenery,
and mild climate. The fertile river valleys of this region early attracted Greek colonists.
They built here many flourishing cities, especially along the central coast, which came to
be known as Ionia.

INFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS

Greek history well illustrates the influence of geographical conditions on the life of a people.
In the first place, mountain ranges cut up Continental Greece into many small states, separated
from one another by natural ramparts. Hence the Greeks loved most of all their own local independence
and always refused to unite into one nation under a single government. In the second place,
the near presence of the sea made sailors of the Greeks and led them to devote much energy
to foreign commerce. They early felt, in consequence, the stimulating effects of intercourse
with other peoples. Finally, the location of Greece at the threshold of Asia, with its best
harbors and most numerous islands on the eastern coast, enabled the country to receive and
profit by all the culture of the Orient. Greece faced the civilized East.

22. THE AEGEAN AGE (TO ABOUT 1100 B.C.)

A PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION

The Greeks of historic times knew very little about their prehistoric period. Instead of accurate
knowledge they had only the beautiful legends preserved in ancient poems, such as the Iliad
and the Odyssey. Within our own day, however, remarkable excavations have disclosed the remains
of a widespread and flourishing civilization in times so distant that the historic Greeks had
lost all sight of it. As in the Orient, [4] the labors of modern scholars are yearly adding
to our knowledge of ancient life.

SCHLIEMANN'S EXCAVATIONS AT TROY

The man who did most to reveal the prehistoric civilization of Greece was a wealthy German
merchant named Heinrich Schliemann. An enthusiastic lover of Homer, he believed that the stories
of the Trojan War related in the Iliad were not idle fancies, but real facts. In 1870 A.D.
he started to test his beliefs by excavations at a hill called Hissarlik, on the northwestern
coast of Asia Minor. Here tradition had always fixed the site of ancient Troy. Schliemann's
discoveries and those of later explorers proved that at Hissarlik at least nine successive
cities had come into existence, flourished, and passed away. Excavations completed in 1892
A.D. have shown that the sixth city in order from the bottom was the one described in the Homeric
poems. It had powerful walls defended by towers, well-fortified gates, and palaces of stone.
The marks of fire throughout the ruins indicate that the city must have been destroyed by a
disastrous conflagration.

SCHLIEMANN'S EXCAVATIONS AT MYCENAE AND TIRYNS

The remarkable disclosures at Troy encouraged Schliemann to excavate other Homeric sites. At
Mycenae, a prehistoric city of Argolis in Greece, he laid bare six rock-hewn graves, containing
the skeletons of nineteen persons, men, women, and children. The faces of the dead had been
covered with thin masks of gold, and their bodies had been decked with gold diadems, bracelets,
and pendants. The other funeral offerings include gold rings, silver vases, and a variety of
bronze weapons. At Tiryns, once the capital of Argolis, he uncovered the ruins of an extensive
structure with gateways, open courts, and closed apartments. Characteristic of this edifice
were the separate quarters occupied by men and women, the series of storerooms for provisions,
and such a modern convenience as a bathroom with pipes and drains. In short, the palace at
Tiryns gives us a clear and detailed picture of the home of a Homeric prince.

EVANS'S EXCAVATIONS AT GNOSSUS

But the fame of even Schliemann's discoveries has been somewhat dimmed by the excavations made
since 1900 A.D. on the site of Gnossus, the ancient capital of the island of Crete. At Gnossus
an Englishman, Sir Arthur Evans, has found the remains of an enormous palace, with numerous
courts, passages, and rooms. Here is the royal council chamber with the throne on which the
king once sat. Here are the royal magazines, still filled with huge earthenware jars for the
storage of provisions. A great number of brilliant pictures--hunting scenes, landscapes, portraits
of men and women--cover the palace walls. Buried in some of the chambers were thousands of
clay tablets with inscriptions which, if ever read, will add new chapters to ancient history. [5]

ANTIQUITY OF AEGEAN CIVILIZATION

These discoveries in the Aegean enable us to place another venerable center of civilized life
by the side of Babylonia and Egypt. As early as 3000 B.C. the primitive inhabitants of the
Aegean were giving up the use of stone tools and weapons for those of metal. Bronze soon came
into general use, as is shown by the excavations. The five centuries between 1600 and 1100
B.C. appear to have been the time when the civilization of the Aegean Age reached its highest
development.

THE FINE ARTS

Remarkable progress took place during Aegean times in some of the fine arts. We find imposing
palaces, often splendidly adorned and arranged for a life of comfort. Wall paintings, plaster
reliefs, and fine carvings in stone excite our admiration. Aegean artists made beautiful pottery
of many shapes and cleverly decorated it with plant and animal forms. They carved ivory, engraved
gems, and excelled in the working of metals. Some of their productions in gold, silver, and
bronze were scarcely surpassed by Greek artists a thousand years later. [6]

COMMERCE

There was much intercourse throughout the Mediterranean during this period. Products of Aegean
art have been found as far west as Sicily, Italy, and Spain, Aegean pottery has frequently
been discovered in Egyptian tombs. Some objects unearthed in Babylonia are apparently of Aegean
workmanship. In those ancient days Crete was mistress of the seas. Cretan merchants preceded
the Phoenicians as carriers between Asia and Europe. [7] Trade and commerce thus opened up
the Mediterranean world to all the cultural influences of the Orient.

DOWNFALL OF AEGEAN CIVILIZATION

Aegean civilization did not penetrate beyond the shores of Asia Minor, the islands, and the
coasts of Continental Greece. The interior regions of the Greek peninsula remained the home
of barbarous tribes, which had not yet learned to build cities, to create beautiful objects
of art, or to traffic on the seas. By 1100 B.C. their destructive inroads brought the Aegean
Age to an end.

23. THE HOMERIC AGE (ABOUT 1100-750 B.C.)

COMING OF THE NORTHERN BARBARIANS

The barbarians who overthrew Aegean civilization seem to have entered Greece from the north,
perhaps from the region the Danube River. They pushed gradually southward, sometimes exterminating
or enslaving the earlier inhabitants of the country, but more often settling peaceably in their
new homes. Conquerors and conquered slowly intermingled and so produced the one Greek people
which is found at the dawn of history. These Greeks, as we shall call them henceforth, also
occupied the islands of the Aegean Sea and the coast of Asia Minor. The entire basin of the
Aegean thus became a Greek world.

THE HOMERIC EPICS

The period between the end of the Aegean Age and the opening of historic times in Greece is
usually called the Homeric Age, because many features of its civilization are reflected in
two epic poems called the Iliad and the Odyssey. The former deals with the story of a Greek
expedition against Troy; the latter describes the wanderings of the hero Odysseus on his return
from Troy. The two epics were probably composed in Ionia, and by the Greeks were attributed
to a blind bard named Homer. Many modern scholars, however, consider them the work of several
generations of poets. The references in the Iliad and the Odyssey to industry, social life,
law, government, and religion give us some idea of the culture which the historic Greeks received
as their inheritance.

INDUSTRY

The Greeks as described in the Homeric epics were in a transitional stage between the life
of shepherds and that of farmers. Wealth consisted chiefly of flocks and herds, though nearly
every freeman owned a little plot of land on which he cultivated grain and cared for his orchard
and vineyard. There were few skilled workmen, for almost everything was made at home. A separate
class of traders had not yet arisen. Commerce was little followed. The Greeks depended on Phoenician
sailors to bring to their shores the commodities which they could not produce themselves. Iron
was known and used, for instance, in the manufacture of farm tools. During Homeric times, however,
that metal had not yet displaced copper and bronze. [8]

SOCIAL LIFE

Social life was very simple. Princes tended flocks and built houses; princesses carried water
and washed clothes. Agamemnon, Odysseus, and other heroes were not ashamed to be their own
butchers and cooks. The Homeric knights did not ride on horseback, but fought from chariots.
They sat at table instead of reclining at meals, as did the later Greeks. Coined money was
unknown. Trade was by barter, values being reckoned in oxen or in lumps of gold and silver.
Men bought their wives by making gifts of cattle to the parents. The art of writing is mentioned
only once in the Homeric poems, and doubtless was little used.

LAW AND MORALITY

The times were rude. Wars, though petty, were numerous and cruel. The vanquished suffered death
or slavery. Piracy, flourishing upon the unprotected seas, ranked as an honorable occupation.
It was no insult to inquire of a seafaring stranger whether he was pirate or merchant. Murders
were frequent. The murderer had to dread, not a public trial and punishment, but rather the
personal vengeance of the kinsmen of his victim. The Homeric Greeks, in fact, exhibited the
usual defects and vices of barbarous peoples.

HOMERIC GEOGRAPHY

The Iliad and Odyssey disclose a considerable acquaintance with peninsular Greece and the coasts
of Asia Minor. Cyprus, Egypt, and Sicily are also known in part. The poet imagines the earth
as a sort of flat shield, with Greece lying in the center. [9] The Mediterranean, "The Sea,"
as it is called by Homer, and its continuation, the Euxine, [10] divided the world into two
equal parts. Surrounding the earth was "the great strength of the Stream of Ocean," [11] a
river, broad and deep, beyond which lay the dark and misty realm of the mythical Cimmerians.
The underworld of Hades, home of the dead, was beneath the surface of the earth.

24. EARLY GREEK RELIGION

THE OLYMPIAN COUNCIL

We may learn from the Homeric poems what were the religious ideas held by the early Greeks.
The greater gods and goddesses were not numerous. Less than a score everywhere received worship
under the same names and in all the temples. Twelve of the chief deities formed a select council,
which was supposed to meet on the top of snow-crowned Olympus. The Greeks, however, did not
agree as to what gods and goddesses should be included in this august assemblage.

ATTRIBUTES OF THE DEITIES

Many of the Olympian deities appear to have been simply personifications of natural phenomena.
Zeus, "father of gods and men," as Homer calls him, was a heaven god, who gathered the clouds
in storms and hurled the lightning bolt. Apollo, a mighty god of light, who warded off darkness
and evil, became the ideal of manly beauty and the patron of music, poetry, and healing. Dionysus
was worshiped as the god of sprouting and budding vegetation. Poseidon, brother of Zeus, ruled
the sea. Hera, the wife of Zeus, represented the female principle in nature. Hence she presided
over the life of women and especially over the sacred rites of marriage. Athena, who sprang
full-grown from the forehead of Zeus, embodied the idea of wisdom and all womanly virtues.
Aphrodite, who arose from the foam of the sea, was the goddess of love and beauty. Demeter,
the great earth- mother, watched over seed-time and harvest. Each deity thus had a kingdom
and a function of its own.

CONCEPTIONS OF THE DEITIES

The Greeks made their gods and goddesses after themselves. The Olympian divinities are really
magnified men and women, subject to all human passions and appetites, but possessed of more
than human power and endowed with immortality. They enjoy the banquet, where they feast on
nectar and ambrosia; they take part in the struggles of the battle field; they marry and are
given in marriage. The gods, morally, were no better than their worshipers. They might be represented
as deceitful, dissolute, and cruel, but they could also be regarded as upholders of truth and
virtue. Even Homer could say, "Verily the blessed gods love not evil deeds, but they reverence
justice and the righteous acts of men." [12]

IDEAS OF THE OTHER WORLD

Greek ideas of the other world were dismal to an extreme. The after-life in Hades was believed
to be a shadowy, joyless copy of the earthly existence. In Hades the shade of great Achilles
exclaims sorrowfully, "Nay, speak not comfortably to me of death. [13] It was not until several
centuries after Homer that happier notions of the future life were taught, or at least suggested,
in the Eleusinian mysteries. [14]

25. RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS: ORACLES AND GAMES

ORACLE OF APOLLO AT DELPHI

The Greeks believed that communications from the gods were received from certain inspired persons
at places called oracles. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi in Phocis enjoyed the utmost veneration.
It lay within a deep cave on the rocky side of Mount Parnassus. Out of a chasm rose a volcanic
vapor which had a certain intoxicating power. The Pythia, or prophetess of Apollo, sat on a
tripod over the steaming cleft and inhaled the gas. The words she uttered in delirium were
supposed to come from the god. They were taken down by the attendant priests, written out in
verse, and delivered to the suppliants.

INQUIRIES AT THE ORACLE

The fame of Apollo as the patron of inspiration and prophecy spread throughout Greece and penetrated
to foreign lands. Every year thousands of visitors made their way to Apollo's shrine. Sick
men prayed for health, childless men prayed for offspring. Statesmen wished to learn the fate
of their political schemes; ambassadors sent by kings and cities sought advice as to weighty
matters of peace and war. Above all, colonists came to Delphi in order to obtain directions
as to the best country in which to settle. Some of the noblest cities of the Greek world, Cyrene
and Byzantium, for example, [15] had their sites fixed by Apollo's guidance.

CHARACTER OF THE RESPONSES

The priests who managed the oracle and its responses were usually able to give good advice
to their inquirers, because news of every sort streamed into Delphi. When the priests were
doubtful what answer to give, the prophecy of the god was sometimes expressed in such ambiguous
fashion that, whatever the outcome, neither Apollo nor his servants could be charged with deceit.
For instance, when Croesus, the Lydian king, was about to attack Cyrus, he learned from the
oracle that "if he warred with the Persians he would overthrow a mighty empire" [16]--but the
mighty empire proved to be his own. [17]

THE OLYMPIAN GAMES

Athletic games were held in different parts of Greece from a remote period. The most famous
games were those in honor of Zeus at Olympia in Elis. They took place every fourth year, in
midsummer. [18] A sacred truce was proclaimed for an entire month, in order that the thousands
of spectators from every part of Greece might arrive and depart in safety. No one not of Greek
blood and no one convicted of crime or of the sin of impiety might participate in the contests.
The candidates had also to prove that they were qualified for the severe tests by a long and
hard training. Once accepted as competitors, they could not withdraw. The man who shrank back
when the hour of trial arrived was considered a coward and was punished with a heavy fine.

THE CONTESTS

The games occupied five days, beginning with the contests in running. There was a short-distance
dash through the length of the stadium, a quarter-mile race, and also a longer race, probably
for two or three miles. Then followed a contest consisting of five events: the long jump, hurling
the discus, throwing the javelin, running, and wrestling. It is not known how victory in these
five events taken together was decided. In the long jump, weights like dumb-bells were held
in the hands, the swing of the weights being used to assist the spring. The discus, which weighed
about twelve pounds, was sometimes hurled more than one hundred feet. The javelin was thrown
either by the hand alone or with the help of a thong wound about the shaft and held in the
fingers. In wrestling, three falls were necessary for a victory. The contestants were free
to get their grip as best they could. Other contests included boxing, horse races, and chariot
races. Women were apparently excluded from the games, yet they were allowed to enter horses
for the races and to set up statues in honor of the victors.

THE VICTOR'S REWARD

The Olympian festival was profoundly religious, because the display of manly strength was thought
to be a spectacle most pleasing to the gods. The winning athlete received only a wreath of
wild olive at Olympia, but at home he enjoyed the gifts and veneration of his fellow-citizens.
Poets celebrated his victories in noble odes. Sculptors reproduced his triumphs in stone and
bronze. To the end of his days he remained a distinguished man.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GAMES

There were few Greeks who at least once in their lives did not attend the festival. The crowds
that gathered before and after the games turned the camp into a great fair, at which merchants
set up their shops and money changers their tables. Poets recited their lines before admiring
audiences and artists exhibited their masterpieces to intending purchasers. Heralds read treaties
recently formed between Greek cities, in order to have them widely known. Orators addressed
the multitude on subjects of general interest. The games thus helped to preserve a sense of
fellowship among Greek communities.

26. THE GREEK CITY-STATE

NATURE OF THE CITY STATE

The Greeks in Homeric times had already begun to live in towns and cities. A Greek city, being
independent and self-governing, is properly called a city-state. Just as a modern nation, it
could declare war, arrange treaties, and make alliances with its neighbors. Such a city-state
included not only the territory within its walls, but also the surrounding district where many
of the citizens lived.

THE CITIZENS

The members of a Greek city-state were very closely associated. The citizens believed themselves
to be descended from a common ancestor and so to be all related. They were united, also, in
the worship of the patron god or hero who had them under his protection. These ties of supposed
kinship and common religion were of the utmost importance. They made citizenship a privilege
which came to a person only by birth, a privilege which he lost by removal to another city.
Elsewhere he was only a foreigner without legal rights--a man without a country.

GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY-STATE

The Homeric poems, which give us our first view of the Greek city-state, also contain the most
ancient account of its government. Each city-state had a king, "the shepherd of the people"
[19] as Homer calls him. The king did not possess absolute authority. He was surrounded by
a council of nobles, chiefly the great landowners of the community. They helped him in judgment
and sacrifice, followed him to war, and filled the principal offices. Both king and nobles
were obliged to consult the common people on matters of great importance. For this purpose
the ruler would summon the citizens to the market place to hear the deliberations of his council
and to settle such questions as making war or declaring peace. All men of free birth could
attend the assembly, where they shouted assent to the decision of their leaders or showed disapproval
by silence. This public assembly had little importance in the Homeric Age, but later it became
the center of Greek democracy.

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY-STATE

After the middle of the eighth century B.C., when historic times began in Greece, some interesting
changes took place in the government of the city- states. In some of them, for example, Thebes
and Corinth, the nobles became strong enough to abolish the kingship altogether. Monarchy,
the rule of one, thus gave away to aristocracy, [20] the rule of the nobles. In other states,
for instance, Sparta and Argos, the kings were not driven out, but their power was much weakened.
Some states came under the control of usurpers whom the Greeks called "tyrants." A tyrant was
a man who gained supreme power by force and governed for his own benefit without regard to
the laws. There were many tyrannies in the Greek world during the seventh and sixth centuries
B.C. Still other states went through an entire cycle of changes from kingship to aristocracy,
from aristocracy to tyranny, and from tyranny to democracy or popular rule.

SPARTA AND ATHENS AS TYPES OF THE CITY-STATE

The isolated and independent Greek communities thus developed at an early period many different
kinds of government. To study them all would be a long task. It is better to fix our attention
on the two city-states which held the principal place in Greek history and at the same time
presented the most striking contrasts in government and social life. These were Sparta and Athens.

27. THE GROWTH OF SPARTA (TO 500 B.C.)

SPARTA AND THE PELOPONNESIAN LEAGUE

The Greek invaders who entered southern Greece, or the Peloponnesus, [21] were known as Dorians.
They founded the city of Sparta, in the district of Laconia. By the close of the sixth century
B.C. the Spartans were able to conquer their immediate neighbors and to organize some of the
city-states of the Peloponnesus into a strong confederacy called the Peloponnesian League.
The members of the league did not pay tribute, but they furnished troops to serve in war under
Spartan leaders, and they looked to Sparta for guidance and protection. Thus this single city
became the foremost power in southern Greece.

SPARTA A MILITARY CAMP

It is clear that the Spartans must have been an extremely vigorous and warlike people. Their
city, in fact, formed a military camp, garrisoned by soldiers whose whole life was passed in
war and in preparation for war. The Spartans were able to devote themselves to martial pursuits
because they possessed a large number of serfs, called helots. The helots tilled the lands
of the Spartans and gave up to their masters the entire product of their labor, except what
was necessary for a bare subsistence.

GOVERNMENT OF SPARTA

Spartan government also had a military character. In form the state was a kingdom, but since
there were always two kings reigning at once and enjoying equal authority, neither of them
could become very powerful. The real management of public affairs lay in the hands of five
men, known as ephors, who were elected every year by the popular assembly. The ephors accompanied
the kings in war and directed their actions; guided the deliberations of the council of nobles
and the assembly of freemen; superintended the education of children; and exercised a general
oversight of the private life of citizens. The ephors had such absolute control over the lives
and property of the Spartans that we may describe their rule as socialistic and select Sparta
as an example of ancient state socialism. Nowhere else in the Greek world was the welfare of
the individual man so thoroughly subordinated to the interests of the society of which he formed
a unit.

THE SPARTAN BOY

Spartan education had a single purpose--to produce good soldiers and obedient citizens. A sound
body formed the first essential. A father was required to submit his son, soon after birth,
to an inspection by the elders of his tribe. If they found the child puny or ill-shaped, they
ordered it to be left on the mountain side, to perish from exposure. At the age of seven a
boy was taken from his parents' home and placed in a military school. Here he was trained in
marching, sham fighting, and gymnastics. He learned to sing warlike songs and in conversation
to express himself in the fewest possible words. Spartan brevity of speech became proverbial.
Above all he learned to endure hardship without complaint. He went barefoot and wore only a
single garment, winter and summer. He slept on a bed of rushes. Every year he and his comrades
had to submit to a flogging before the altar of the goddess Artemis, and the hero was the lad
who could bear the whipping longest without giving a sign of pain. It is said that boys sometimes
died under the lash rather than utter a cry. Such ordeals are still a feature of savage life
to-day.

THE ADULT SPARTAN

On reaching the age of twenty the youth was considered a warrior. He did not live at home,
but passed his time in barracks, as a member of a military mess to which he contributed his
proper share of food, wine, and money. At the age of thirty years the young Spartan became
a full citizen and a member of the popular assembly. He was then compelled to marry in order
to raise children for the state. But marriage did not free him from attendance at the public
meals, the drill ground, and the gymnasium. A Spartan, in fact, enjoyed little home life until
his sixtieth year, when he became an elder and retired from actual service.

EXCELLENCE OF THE SPARTAN SOLDIERY

This exclusive devotion to military pursuits accomplished its object. The Spartans became the
finest soldiers of antiquity. "All the rest of the Greeks," says an ancient writer, "are amateurs;
the Spartans are professionals in the conduct of war." [22] Though Sparta never produced great
thinkers, poets or artists, her military strength made her the bulwark of Greece against foreign
foes. The time was to come when Greece, to retain her liberties, would need this disciplined
Spartan soldiery. [23]

28. THE GROWTH OF ATHENS (to 500 B.C.)

ATHENS AS A CITY-STATE

The district of Attica, though smaller than our smallest American commonwealth, was early filled
with a number of independent city-states. It was a great step in advance when, long before
the dawn of Greek history, these tiny communities were united with Athens. The inhabitants
of the Attic towns and villages gave up their separate governments and became members of the
one city-state of Athens. Henceforth a man was a Athenian citizen, no matter in what part of
Attica he lived.

OPPRESSIVE RULE OF THE NOBLES

At an earlier period, perhaps, than elsewhere in Greece, monarchy at Athens disappeared before
the rising power of the nobles. The rule of the nobility bore harshly on the common people.
Popular discontent was especially excited at the administration of justice. There were at first
no written laws, but only the long-established customs of the community. Since all the judges
were nobles, they were tempted to decide legal cases in favor of their own class. The people,
at length, began to clamor for a written code. They could then know just what the laws were.

DRACO'S CODE, 621 B.C.

After much agitation an Athenian named Draco was employed to write out a code for the state.
The laws, as published, were very severe. The penalty for most offenses, even the smallest
theft, was death. The Athenians used to declare that the Draconian code had been written, "not
in ink, but in blood." Its publication, however, was a popular triumph and the first step toward
the establishment of Athenian democracy.

LEGISLATION OF SOLON, 594-593 B.C.

The second step was the legislation of Solon. This celebrated Athenian was accounted among
the wisest men of his age. The people held him in high honor and gave him power to make much-needed
reforms. At this time the condition of the Attic peasants was deplorable. Many of them had
failed to pay their rent to the wealthy landowners, and according to the old custom were being
sold into slavery. Solon abolished the custom and restored to freedom all those who had been
enslaved for debt. He also limited the amount of land which a noble might hold. By still another
law he admitted even the poorest citizens to the popular assembly, where they could vote for
magistrates and judge of their conduct after their year of office was over. By giving the common
people a greater share in the government, Solon helped forward the democratic movement at Athens.

TYRANNY OF PISISTRATUS, 560-527 B.C.

Solon's reforms satisfied neither the nobility nor the commons. The two classes continued their
rivalry until the disorder of the times enabled an ambitious politician to gain supreme power
as a tyrant. [24] He was Solon's own nephew, a noble named Pisistratus. The tyrant ruled with
moderation and did much to develop the Athenian city-state. He fostered agriculture by dividing
the lands of banished nobles among the peasants. His alliances with neighboring cities encouraged
the rising commerce of Athens. The city itself was adorned with handsome buildings by architects
and sculptors whom Pisistratus invited to his court from all parts of Greece.

REFORMS OF CLISTHENES, 508-507 B.C.

Pisistratus was succeeded by his two sons, but the Athenians did not take kindly to their rule.
Before long the tyranny came to an end. The Athenians now found a leader in a noble named Clisthenes,
who proved to be an able statesman. He carried still further the democratic movement begun
by Draco and Solon. One of his reforms extended Athenian citizenship to many foreigners and
emancipated slaves ("freedmen") then living in Attica. This liberal measure swelled the number
of citizens and helped to make the Athenians a more progressive people. Clisthenes, it is said,
also established the curious arrangement known as ostracism. Every year, if necessary, the
citizens were to meet in assembly and to vote against any persons whom they thought dangerous
to the state. If as many as six thousand votes were cast, the man who received the highest
number of votes had to go into honorable exile for ten years. [25] Though ostracism was intended
as a precaution against tyrants, before long it came to be used to remove unpopular politicians.

ATHENS A DEMOCRATIC STATE

There were still some steps to be taken before the rule of the people was completely secured
at Athens. But, in the main, the Athenians by 500 B.C. had established a truly democratic government,
the first in the history of the world. The hour was now rapidly approaching when this young
and vigorous democracy was to show forth its worth before the eyes of all Greece.

29. COLONIAL EXPANSION OF GREECE (ABOUT 750-500 B.C.)

THE GREAT AGE OF COLONIZATION

While Athens, Sparta, and their sister states were working out the problems of government,
another significant movement was going on in the Greek world. The Greeks, about the middle
of the eighth century B.C., began to plant numerous colonies along the shores of the Mediterranean
and of the Black Sea. The great age of colonization covered more than two hundred years. [26]

REASONS FOR FOUNDING COLONIES

Several reasons led to the founding of colonies. Trade was an important motive. The Greeks,
like the Phoenicians, [27] could realize large profits by exchanging their manufactured goods
for the food and raw materials of other countries. Land hunger was another motive. The poor
soil of Greece could not support many inhabitants and, when population increased, emigration
afforded the only means of relieving the pressure of numbers. A third motive was political
and social unrest. Greek cities at this period contained many men of adventurous disposition
who were ready to seek in foreign countries a refuge from the oppression of nobles or tyrants.
They hoped to find in their new settlements more freedom than they had at home.

CHARACTER OF THE GREEK COLONY

A Greek colony was not simply a trading post; it was a center of Greek life. The colonists
continued to be Greeks in customs, language, and religion. Though quite independent of the
parent state, they always regarded it with reverence and affection: they called themselves
"men away from home." Mother city and daughter colony traded with each other and in time of
danger helped each other. A symbol of this unity was the sacred fire carried from the public
hearth of the old community to the new settlement.

COLONIZATION IN THE NORTH AND EAST

The Greeks planted many colonies on the coast of the northern Aegean and on both sides of the
long passage between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Their most important colony was Byzantium,
upon the site where Constantinople now stands. They also made settlements along the shores
of the Black Sea. The cities founded here were centers from which the Greeks drew their supplies
of fish, wood, wool, grain, metals, and slaves. The immense profits to be gained by trade made
the Greeks willing to live in a cold country so unlike their own and among barbarous peoples.

COLONIZATION IN THE WEST

The western lands furnished far more attractive sites for colonization. The Greeks could feel
at home in southern Italy, where the genial climate, pure air, and sparkling sea recalled their
native land. At a very early date they founded Cumae, on the coast just north of the bay of
Naples. Emigrants from Cumae, in turn, founded the city of Neapolis (Naples), which in Roman
times formed a home of Greek culture and even to-day possesses a large Greek population. To
secure the approaches from Greece to these remote colonies, two strongholds were established
on the strait of Messina: Regium (modern Reggio) on the Italian shore and Messana (modern Messina)
on that of Sicily. Another important colony in southern Italy was Tarentum (modern Taranto).

THE SICILIAN COLONIES

Greek settlements in Sicily were mainly along the coast. Expansion over the entire island was
checked by the Carthaginians, who had numerous possessions at its western extremity. The most
celebrated colony in Sicily was Syracuse, established by emigrants from Corinth. It became
the largest of Greek cities.

OTHER MEDITERRANEAN COLONIES

In Corsica, Sardinia, and on the coast of Spain Carthage also proved too obstinate a rival
for the Greeks to gain much of a foothold. The city of Massilia (Marseilles), at the mouth
of the Rhone, was their chief settlement in ancient Gaul. Two colonies on the southern shore
of the Mediterranean were Cyrene, west of Egypt, and Naucratis, in the Delta of the Nile. From
this time many Greek travelers visited Egypt to see the wonders of that strange old country.

RESULTS OF COLONIZATION

Energetic Greeks, the greatest colonizers of antiquity, thus founded settlements from the Black
Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. "All the Greek colonies" says an ancient writer, "are washed by
the waves of the sea, and, so to speak, a fringe of Greek earth is woven on to foreign lands."
[28] To distinguish themselves from the foreigners, or "barbarians," [29] about them, the Greeks
began to call themselves by the common name of Hellenes. Hellas, their country, came to include
all the territory possessed by Hellenic peoples. The life of the Greeks, henceforth, was confined
no longer within the narrow limits of the Aegean. Wherever rose a Greek city, there was a scene
of Greek history.

30. BONDS OF UNION AMONG THE GREEKS

LANGUAGE AS A UNIFYING FORCE

The Greek colonies, as we have seen, were free and independent. In Greece itself the little
city-states were just as jealous of their liberties. Nevertheless ties existed, not of common
government, but of common interests and ideals, which helped to unite the scattered sections
of the Greek world. The strongest bond of union was, of course, the one Greek speech. Everywhere
the people used the same beautiful and expressive language. It is not a "dead" language, for
it still lives in modified form on the lips of nearly three million people in the Greek peninsula,
throughout the Mediterranean, and even in remote America.

LITERATURE AS UNIFYING FORCE; HOMER

Greek literature, likewise, made for unity. The Iliad and the Odyssey were recited in every
Greek village for centuries. They formed the principal textbook in the schools; an Athenian
philosopher calls Homer the "educator of Hellas." It has been well said that these two epics
were at once the Bible and the Shakespeare of the Greek people.

RELIGION AS A UNIFYING FORCE; AMPHICTYONIES

Religion formed another bond of union. Everywhere the Greeks worshiped the same gods and performed
the same sacred rites. Religious influences were sometimes strong enough to bring about federations
known as amphictyonies, or leagues of neighbors. The people living around a famous sanctuary
would meet to observe their festivals in common and to guard the shrine of their divinity.
The Delphic amphictyony was the most noteworthy of these local unions. It included twelve tribes
and cities of central Greece and Thessaly. They established a council, which took the shrine
of Apollo under its protection and superintended the athletic games at Delphi.

A NEW AGE

The seventh and sixth centuries before Christ form a noteworthy epoch in Greek history. Commerce
and colonization were bringing their educating influence to bear upon the Greeks. Hellenic
cities were rising everywhere along the Mediterranean shores. A common language, literature,
and religion were making the people more and more conscious of their unity as opposed to the
"barbarians" about them.

THE GREEK WORLD, 500 B.C.

Greek history has now been traced from its beginnings to about 500 B.C. It is the history of
a people, not of one country or of a united nation. Yet the time was drawing near when all
the Greek communities were to be brought together in closer bonds of union than they had ever
before known.

CHAPTER V

THE GREAT AGE OF THE GREEK REPUBLICS TO 362 B.C. [1]

31. THE PERILS OF HELLAS

ASIATIC GREEKS CONQUERED BY CROESUS

The history of the Greeks for many centuries had been uneventful--a history of their uninterrupted
expansion over barbarian lands. But now the time was approaching when the independent and isolated
Greek communities must meet the attack of the great despotic empires of Asia. The Greek cities
of Asia Minor were the first part of the Hellenic world to be involved. Their conquest by the
Lydian king, Croesus, about the middle of the sixth century B.C., showed how grave was the
danger to Greek independence from the ambitious designs of Oriental monarchs.

CONQUESTS OF CYRUS AND CAMBYSES

As we have already learned, Croesus himself soon had to submit to a foreign overlord, in the
person of Cyrus the Great. The subjugation of Lydia and the Greek seaboard by Cyrus extended
the Persian Empire to the Mediterranean. The conquest of Phoenicia and Cyprus by Cambyses added
the Phoenician navy to the resources of the mighty empire. Persia had now become a sea power,
able to cope with the Greeks on their own element. The subjection of Egypt by the same king
led naturally to the annexation of the Greek colonies on the north African shore. The entire
coast of the eastern Mediterranean had now come under the control of a new, powerful, and hostile
state.

CONQUESTS OF DARIUS

The accession of Darius to the Persian throne only increased the dangers that overshadowed
Hellas. He aimed to complete the work of Cyrus and Cambyses by extending the empire wherever
a natural frontier had not been reached. Accordingly, about 512 B.C., Darius invaded Europe
with a large army, annexed the Greek colonies on the Hellespont (the modern Dardanelles), and
subdued the wild tribes of Thrace and Macedonia. The Persian dominions now touched those of
the Greeks. [2]

THE IONIAN REVOLT, 499-493 B.C.

Not long after this European expedition of Darius, the Ionian cities of Asia Minor revolted
against the Persians. Unable to face their foes single-handed, they sought aid from Sparta,
then the chief military power of Greece. The Spartans refused to take part in the war, but
the Athenians, who realized the menace to Greece in the Persian advance, sent ships and men
to fight for the Ionians. Even with this help the Ionian cities could not hold out against
the vast resources of the Persians. One by one they fell again into the hands of the Great King.

32. EXPEDITIONS OF DARIUS AGAINST GREECE

FIRST EXPEDITION, 492 B.C.

No sooner was quiet restored in Asia Minor than Darius began preparations to punish Athens
for her part in the Ionian Revolt. The first expedition under the command of Mardonius, the
son-in-law of the Persian monarch, was a failure. Mardonius never reached Greece, because the
Persian fleet, on which his army depended for provisions, was wrecked off the promontory of
Mount Athos.

SECOND EXPEDITION, 490 B.C.

Darius did not abandon his designs, in consequence of the disaster. Two years later a second
fleet, bearing a force of perhaps sixty thousand men, set out from Ionia for Greece. Datis
and Artaphernes, the Persian leaders, sailed straight across the Aegean and landed on the plain
of Marathon, twenty-six miles from Athens.

BATTLE OF MARATHON, 490 B.C.

The situation of the Athenians seemed desperate. They had scarcely ten thousand men with whom
to face an army far larger and hitherto invincible. The Spartans promised support, but delayed
sending troops at the critical moment. Better, perhaps, than a Spartan army was the genius
of Miltiades, one of the Athenian generals. Relying on Greek discipline and Greek valor to
win the day, he decided to take the offensive. His heavy armed soldiers made a smashing charge
on the Persians and drove them in confusion to their ships. Datis and Artaphernes then sailed
back to Asia with their errand of vengeance unfulfilled.

POLICIES OF ARISTIDES AND THEMISTOCLES

After the battle of Marathon the Athenians began to make preparations to resist another Persian
invasion. One of their leaders, the eminent Aristides, thought that they should increase their
army and meet the enemy on land. His rival, Themistocles, urged a different policy. He would
sacrifice the army to the navy and make Athens the strongest sea power in Greece. The safety
of Athens, he argued, lay in her ships. In order to settle the question the opposing statesmen
were put to the test of ostracism. [3] The vote went against Aristides, who was obliged to
withdraw into exile. Themistocles, now master of the situation, persuaded the citizens to use
the revenues from some silver mines in Attica for the upbuilding of a fleet. When the Persians
came, the Athenians were able to oppose them with nearly two hundred triremes [4]--the largest
navy in Greece.

33. XERXES AND THE GREAT PERSIAN WAR

PREPARATIONS OF PERSIA

"Ten years after Marathon," says a Greek historian, "the 'barbarians' returned with the vast
armament which was to enslave Hellas." [5] Darius was now dead, but his son Xerxes had determined
to complete his task. Vast quantities of provisions were collected; the Hellespont was bridged
with boats; and the rocky promontory of Mount Athos, where a previous fleet had suffered shipwreck,
was pierced with a canal. An army of several hundred thousand men was brought together from
all parts of the Great King's domain. He evidently intended to crush the Greeks by sheer weight
of numbers.

GREEK PREPARATIONS

Xerxes did not have to attack a united Greece. His mighty preparations frightened many of the
Greek states into yielding, when Persian heralds came to demand "earth and water," the customary
symbols of submission. Some of the other states, such as Thebes, which was jealous of Athens,
and Argos, equally jealous of Sparta, did nothing to help the loyal Greeks throughout the struggle.
But Athens and Sparta with their allies remained joined for resistance to the end. Upon the
suggestion of Themistocles a congress of representatives from the patriotic states assembled
at the isthmus of Corinth in 481 B.C. Measures of defense were taken, and Sparta was put in
command of the allied fleet and army.

BATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE, 480 B.C.

The campaigns of the Great Persian War have been described, once for all, in the glowing pages
of the Greek historian, Herodotus. [6] Early in the year 480 B.C. the Persian host moved out
of Sardis, crossed the Hellespont, and advanced to the pass of Thermopylae, commanding the
entrance to central Greece. This position, one of great natural strength, was held by a few
thousand Greeks under the Spartan king, Leonidas. For two days Xerxes hurled his best soldiers
against the defenders of Thermopylae, only to find that numbers did not count in that narrow
defile. There is no telling how long the handful of Greeks might have kept back the Persian
hordes, had not treachery come to the aid of the enemy. A traitor Greek revealed to Xerxes
the existence of an unfrequented path, leading over the mountain in the rear of the pass. A
Persian detachment marched over the trail by night and took up a position behind the Greeks.
The latter still had time to escape, but three hundred Spartans and perhaps two thousand allies
refused to desert their post. While Persian officers provided with whips lashed their unwilling
troops to battle, Leonidas and his men fought till spears and swords were broken, and hands
and teeth alone remained as weapons. Xerxes at length gained the pass--but only over the bodies
of its heroic defenders. Years later a monument to their memory was raised on the field of
battle. It bore the simple inscription: "Stranger, go tell the Spartans that we lie here in
obedience to their commands." [7]

AFTER THERMOPYLAE

After the disaster at Thermopylae nearly all the states of central Greece submitted to the
Persians. They marched rapidly through Boeotia and Attica to Athens, but found a deserted city.
Upon the advice of Themistocles the non-combatants had withdrawn to places of safety, and the
entire fighting force of Athens had embarked on the ships. The Athenian fleet took up a position
in the strait separating the island of Salamis from Attica and awaited the enemy. [8]

BATTLE OF SALAMIS, 480 B.C.

The battle of Salamis affords an interesting example of naval tactics in antiquity. The trireme
was regarded as a missile to be hurled with sudden violence against the opposing ship, in order
to disable or sink it. A sea fight became a series of maneuvers; and victory depended as much
on the skill of the rowers and steersmen as on the bravery of the soldiers. The Persians at
Salamis had many more ships than the Greeks, but Themistocles rightly believed that in the
narrow strait their numbers would be a real disadvantage to them. Such proved to be the case.
The Persians fought well, but their vessels, crowded together, could not navigate properly
and even wrecked one another by collision. After an all-day contest what remained of their
fleet withdrew from the strait.

AFTER SALAMIS

The victory at Salamis had important results. It so crippled the Persians that henceforth they
lost command of the sea. Xerxes found it difficult to keep his men supplied with provisions
and at once withdrew with the larger part of his force to Asia. The Great King himself had
no heart for further fighting, but he left Mardonius, with a strong body of picked troops,
to subjugate the Greeks on land. So the real crisis of the war was yet to come.

BATTLES OF PLATAEA AND MYCALE, 479 B.C.

Mardonius passed the winter quietly in Thessaly, preparing for the spring campaign. The Greeks
in their turn made a final effort. A strong Spartan army, supported by the Athenians and their
allies, met the Persians near the little town of Plataea in Boeotia. Here the heavy-armed Greek
soldiers, with their long spears, huge shields, and powerful swords, easily overcame the enormous
masses of the enemy. The success at Plataea showed how superior to the Persians were the Greeks
in equipment, leadership, and fighting power. At the same time as this battle the remainder
of the Persian fleet suffered a crushing defeat at Mycale, a promontory off the Ionian coast.
These two battles really ended the war. Never again was Persia to make a serious effort to
secure dominion over Continental Greece.

VICTORIUS HELLAS

The Great Persian War was much more than a conflict between two rival states. It was a struggle
between East and West; between Oriental despotism and Occidental individualism. On the one
side were all the populous, centralized countries of Asia; on the other side, the small, disunited
states of Greece. In the East was the boundless wealth, in men and money, of a world-wide empire.
In the West were the feeble resources of a few petty communities. Nevertheless Greece won.
The story of her victory forms an imperishable record in the annals of human freedom.

34. ATHENS UNDER THEMISTOCLES, ARISTIDES, AND CIMON

THEMISTOCLES AND THE FORTIFICATIONS OF ATHENS

After the battle of Plataea the Athenians, with their wives and children, returned to Attica
and began the restoration of their city, which the Persians had burned. Their first care was
to raise a wall so high and strong Athens in future would be impregnable to attack. Upon the
suggestion of Themistocles it was decided to include within the fortifications a wide area
where all the country people, in case of another invasion, could find a refuge. Themistocles
also persuaded the Athenians to build a massive wall on the land side of Piraeus, the port
of Athens. That harbor town now became the center of Athenian industry and commerce.

ARISTIDES AND THE DELIAN LEAGUE, 477 B.C.

While the Athenians were rebuilding their city, important events were taking place in the Aegean.
After the battle of Mycale the Greek states in Asia Minor and on the islands once more rose
in revolt against the Persians. Aided by Sparta and Athens, they gained several successes and
removed the immediate danger of another Persian attack. It was clearly necessary, however,
for the Greek cities in Asia Minor and the Aegean to remain in close alliance with the Continental
Greeks, if they were to preserve their independence. Under the guidance of Aristides, the old
rival of Themistocles, [9] the allies formed a union known as the Delian League.

CONSTITUTION OF THE LEAGUE

The larger cities in the league agreed to provide ships and crews for a fleet, while the smaller
cities were to make their contributions in money. Athens assumed the presidency of the league,
and Athenian officials collected the revenues, which were placed in a treasury on the island
of Delos. As head of this new federation Athens now had a position of supremacy in the Aegean
like that which Sparta enjoyed in the Peloponnesus. [10]

CIMON AND THE WAR AGAINST PERSIA

The man who succeeded Themistocles and Aristides in leadership of the Athenians was Cimon,
son of Miltiades, the hero of Marathon. While yet a youth his gallantry at the battle of Salamis
gained him a great reputation, and when Aristides introduced him to public life the citizens
welcomed him gladly. He soon became the head of the aristocratic or conservative party in the
Athenian city. To Cimon the Delian League entrusted the continuation of the war with Persia.
The choice was fortunate, for Cimon had inherited his father's military genius. No man did
more than he to humble the pride of Persia. As the outcome of Cimon's successful campaigns
the southern coast of Asia Minor was added to the Delian League, and the Greek cities at the
mouth of the Black Sea were freed from the Persian yoke. Thus, with Cimon as its leader, the
confederacy completed the liberation of the Asiatic Greeks.

THE DELIAN LEAGUE BECOMES SUBJECT TO ATHENS, ABOUT 454 B.C.

While the Greeks were gaining these victories, the character of the Delian League was being
transformed. Many of the cities, instead of furnishing ships, had taken the easier course of
making all their contributions in money. The change really played into the hands of Athens,
for the tribute enabled the Athenians to build the ships themselves and add them to their own
navy. They soon had a fleet powerful enough to coerce any city that failed to pay its assessments
or tried to withdraw from the league. Eventually the common treasure was transferred from Delos
to Athens. The date of this event (454 B.C.) may be taken as marking the formal establishment
of the Athenian naval empire.

DECLINE OF CIMON'S INFLUENCE

Sparta and her Peloponnesian allies viewed with growing jealousy the rapid rise of Athens.
As long, however, as Cimon remained at the head of Athenian affairs, there was little danger
of a break with Sparta. He desired his city to keep on good terms with her powerful neighbor:
Athens should be mistress of the seas, and Sparta should be mistress on the mainland. A contest
between them, Cimon foresaw, would work lasting injury to all Greece. Cimon's pro-Spartan attitude
brought him, however, into disfavor at Athens, and he was ostracized. New men and new policies
henceforth prevailed in the Athenian state.

35. ATHENS UNDER PERICLES

PERICLES

The ostracism of Cimon deprived the aristocrats of their most prominent representative. It
was possible for the democratic or liberal party to assume complete control of public affairs.
Pericles, their leader and champion, was a man of studious habits. He never appeared on the
streets except when walking between his house and the popular assembly or the market place,
kept rigidly away from dinners and drinking bouts, and ruled his household with strict economy
that he might escape the suspicion of enriching himself at the public expense. He did not speak
often before the people, but came forward only on special occasions; and the rarity of his
utterances gave them added weight. Pericles was a thorough democrat, but he used none of the
arts of the demagogue. He scorned to flatter the populace. His power over the people rested
on his majestic eloquence, on his calm dignity of demeanor, and above all on his unselfish
devotion to the welfare of Athens.

AGE OF PERICLES, 461-429 B.C.

The period, about thirty years in length, between the ostracism of Cimon and the death of Pericles,
forms the most brilliant epoch in Greek history. Under the guidance of Pericles the Athenian
naval empire reached its widest extent. Through his direction Athens became a complete democracy.
Inspired by him the Athenians came to manifest that love of knowledge, poetry, art, and all
beautiful things which, even more than their empire or their democracy, has made them famous
in the annals of mankind. The Age of Pericles affords, therefore, a convenient opportunity
to set forth the leading features of Athenian civilization in the days of its greatest glory.

ATHENIAN IMPERIALISM

Athens under Pericles ruled more than two hundred towns and cities in Asia Minor and the islands
of the Aegean Sea. [11] The subjects of Athens, in return for the protection that she gave
them against Persia, owed many obligations. They paid an annual tribute and furnished soldiers
in time of war. In all legal cases of importance the citizens had to go to Athens for trial
by Athenian courts. The Delian communities, in some instances, were forced to endure the presence
of Athenian garrisons and officers. To the Greeks at large all this seemed nothing less than
high-handed tyranny. Athens, men felt, had built up an empire on the ruins of Hellenic liberty.

NATURE OF THE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY

If the Athenians possessed an empire, they themselves were citizens of a state more democratic
than any other that has existed, before or since, in the history of the world. They had now
learned how unjust was the rule of a tyrant or of a privileged class of nobles. They tried,
instead, to afford every one an opportunity to make the laws, to hold office, and to administer
justice. Hence the Athenian popular assembly and law courts were open to all respectable citizens.
The offices, also, were made very numerous--fourteen hundred in all--so that they might be
distributed as widely as possible. Most of them were annual, and some could not be held twice
by the same person. Election to office was usually by lot. This arrangement did away with favoritism
and helped to give the poor man a chance in politics, as well as the man of wealth or noble birth.

THE ASSEMBLY

The center of Athenian democracy was the Assembly. Its membership included every citizen who
had reached twenty years of age. Rarely, however, did the attendance number more than five
thousand, since most of the citizens lived outside the walls in the country districts of Attica.
Forty regular meetings were held every year. These took place on the slopes of the hill called
the Pnyx. A speaker before the Assembly faced a difficult audience. It was ready to yell its
disapproval of his advice, to mock him if he mispronounced a word, or to drown his voice with
shouts and whistles. Naturally, the debates became a training school for orators. No one could
make his mark in the Assembly who was not a clear and interesting speaker. Voting was by show
of hands, except in cases affecting individuals, such as ostracism, when the ballot was used.
Whatever the decision of the Assembly, it was final. This great popular gathering settled questions
of war and peace, sent out military and naval expeditions, voted public expenditures, and had
general control over the affairs of Athens and the empire.

THE TEN GENERALS

The Assembly was assisted in the conduct of public business by many officers and magistrates,
among whom the Ten Generals held the leading place. It was their duty to guide the deliberations
of the Assembly and to execute the orders of that body.

THE JURY COURTS

There was also a system of popular jury courts composed of citizens selected by lot from the
candidates who presented themselves. The number of jurors varied; as many as a thousand might
serve at an important trial. A court was both judge and jury, it decided by majority vote;
and from its decision lay no appeal. Before these courts public officers accused of wrong-doing
were tried; disputes between different cities of the empire and other important cases were
settled; and all ordinary legal business affecting the Athenians themselves was transacted.
Thus, even in matters of law, the Athenian government was completely democratic.

STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF THE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY

Democracy then, reached its height in ancient Athens. The people ruled, and they ruled directly.
Every citizen had some active part in politics. Such a system worked well in the management
of a small city-state like Athens. But if the Athenians could govern themselves, they proved
unable to govern an empire with justice and wisdom. There was no such thing as representation
in their constitution. The subject cities had no one to speak for them in the Assembly or before
the jury courts. We shall notice the same absence of a representative system in republican
Rome. [12]

SYSTEM OF STATE PAY

A large number of Athenians were relieved from the necessity of working for themselves through
the system of state pay introduced by Pericles. Jurors, soldiers, and sailors received money
for their services. Later, in the fourth century, citizens accepted fees for attending the
Assembly. These payments, though small, enabled poor citizens to devote much time to public duties.

INDUSTRIAL ATHENS

Athens contained many skilled workmen whose daily tasks gave them scant opportunity to engage
in the exciting game of politics. The average rate of wages was very low. In spite of cheap
food and modest requirements for clothing and shelter, it must have been difficult for the
laborer to keep body and soul together. Outside of Athens, in the country districts of Attica,
lived the peasants whose little farms produced the olives, grapes, and figs for which Attica
was celebrated.

SLAVERY

There were many thousands of slaves in Athens and Attica at this period. Their number was so
great and their labor so cheap that we may think of them as taking the place of modern machines.
It was the slaves who did most of the work on the large estates owned by wealthy men, who toiled
in the mines and quarries, and who served as oarsmen on the ships. The system of slavery enabled
many an Athenian to live a life of leisure, but it lowered the dignity of labor and tended
to prevent the rise of the poorer citizens to positions of responsibility. In Greece, as in
the Orient, [13] slavery cast its blight over free industry.

COMMERCIAL ATHENS

The Athenian city was now the chief center of Greek commerce. [14] "The fruits of the whole
earth," said Pericles, "flow in upon us; so that we enjoy the goods of other Commercial countries
as freely as of our own." [15] Exports of Athens wine and olive oil, pottery, metal wares,
and objects of art were sent out from Piraeus [16] to every region of the Mediterranean. The
imports from the Black Sea region, Thrace, and the Aegean included such commodities as salt,
dried fish, wool, timber, hides, and, above all, great quantities of wheat. Very much as modern
England, Athens was able to feed all her people only by bringing in food from abroad. To make
sure that in time of war there should be no interruption of food supplies, the Athenians built
the celebrated Long Walls, between the city and its port of Piraeus. (See the map below) Henceforth
they felt secure from attack, as long as their navy ruled the Aegean.

ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL ATHENS

In the days of her prosperity Athens began to make herself not only a strong, but also a beautiful,
city. The temples and other structures which were raised on the Acropolis during the Age of
Pericles still excite, even in their ruins, the envy and wonder of mankind. [17] Athens at
this time was also the center of Greek intellectual life. In no other period of similar length
have so many admirable books been produced. No other epoch has given birth to so many men of
varied and delightful genius. The greatest poets, historians, and philosophers of Greece were
Athenians, either by birth or training. As Pericles himself said in a noble speech, Athens
was "the school of Hellas." [18]

36. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR, 431-404 B.C.

INEVITABLENESS OF THE WAR

The brilliant Age of Pericles had not come to an end before the two chief powers in the Hellenic
world became involved in a deadly war. It would seem that Athens and Sparta, the one supreme
upon the sea, the other at the head of the Peloponnesus, might have avoided a struggle which
was sure to be long and costly. But Greek cities were always ready to fight one another. When
Athens and Sparta found themselves rivals for the leadership of Greece, it was easy for the
smouldering fires of distrust and jealousy to flame forth into open conflict. "And at that
time," says Thucydides, the Athenian historian who described the struggle, "the youth of Sparta
and the youth of Athens were numerous; they had never seen war, and were therefore very willing
to take up arms." [19]

ORIGIN OF THE WAR

The conflict was brought on by Corinth, one of the leading members of the Peloponnesian League
and, next to Athens, the most important commercial power in Greece. She had already seen her
once-profitable trade in the Aegean monopolized by Athens. That energetic city was now reaching
out for Corinthian commerce in Italian and Sicilian waters. When the Athenians went so far
as to interfere in a quarrel between Corinth and her colony of Corcyra, even allying themselves
with the latter city, the Corinthians felt justly resentful and appealed to Sparta for aid.
The Spartans listened to their appeal and, with the apparent approval of the Delphic oracle
which assured them "that they would conquer if they fought with all their might," [20] declared
war.

RESOURCES OF THE CONTESTANTS

The two antagonists were fairly matched. The one was strong where the other was weak. Sparta,
mainly a continental power, commanded all the Peloponnesian states except Argos and Achaea,
besides some of the smaller states of central Greece. Athens, mainly a maritime power, ruled
all the subject cities of the Aegean. The Spartans possessed the most formidable army then
in the world, but lacked money and ships. The Athenians had a magnificent navy, an overflowing
treasury, and a city impregnable to direct attack. It seemed, in fact, as if neither side could
seriously injure the other.

FIRST STAGE OF THE WAR, 431-421 B.C.

The war began in 431 B.C. Its first stage was indecisive. The Athenians avoided a conflict
in the open field with the stronger Peloponnesian army, which ravaged Attica. They were crippled
almost at the outset of the struggle by a terrible plague among the refugees from Attica, crowded
behind the Long Walls. The pestilence slew at least one-fourth of the inhabitants of Athens,
including Pericles himself. After ten years of fighting both sides grew weary of the war and
made a treaty of peace to last for fifty years.

THE SICILIAN EXPEDITION, 4l5-4l3 B.C.

Not long after the conclusion of peace the Athenians were persuaded by a brilliant and ambitious
politician, named Alcibiades, to undertake an expedition against Syracuse in Sicily. This city
was a colony of Corinth, and hence was a natural ally of the Peloponnesian states. The Athenians,
by conquering it, expected to establish their power in Sicily. But the siege of Syracuse ended
in a complete failure. The Athenians failed to capture the city, and in a great naval battle
they lost their fleet. Then they tried to retreat by land, but soon had to surrender. Many
of the prisoners were sold as slaves; many were thrown by their inhuman captors into the stone
quarries near Syracuse, where they perished from exposure and starvation. The Athenians, says
Thucydides, "were absolutely annihilated--both army and fleet--and of the many thousands who
went away only a handful ever saw their homes again." [21]

LAST STAGE OF THE WAR 413-404 B.C.

Athens never recovered from this terrible blow. The Spartans quickly renewed the contest, now
with the highest hopes of success. The Athenians had to guard their city against the invader
night and day; their slaves deserted to the enemy; and they themselves could do no farming
except under the walls of the city. For supplies they had to depend entirely on their ships.
For nearly ten years, however, the Athenians kept up the struggle. At length the Spartans captured
an Athenian fleet near Aegospotami on the Hellespont. Soon afterwards they blockaded Piraeus
and their army encamped before the walls of Athens. Bitter famine compelled the Athenians to
sue for peace. The Spartans imposed harsh terms. The Athenians were obliged to destroy their
Long Walls and the fortifications of Piraeus, to surrender all but twelve of their warships,
and to acknowledge the supremacy of Sparta.

37. THE SPARTAN AND THEBAN SUPREMACIES, 404-362 B.C.

SPARTAN DESPOTISM

Sparta was now the undisputed leader of Continental Greece and of the Aegean. As the representative
of the liberty-loving Greeks she had humbled the pride and power of "tyrant" Athens. A great
opportunity lay before her to reorganize the Hellenic world and to end the struggles for supremacy
between rival cities. But Sparta entered upon no such glorious career. She had always stood
as the champion of aristocracy against democracy, and now in her hour of triumph she began
to overturn every democratic government that still existed in Greece. The Greek cities soon
found they had exchanged the mild sway of Athens for the brutal despotism of Sparta.

THE FREEING OF THEBES 379 B.C.

But Spartan despotism provoked resistance. It was the Boeotian city of Thebes which raised
the standard of revolt. Some of the liberty-loving Thebans, headed by Pelopidas, a patriotic
noble, formed a conspiracy to drive the Spartans out of the city. Disguised as huntsmen, Pelopidas
and his followers entered Thebes at nightfall, killed the tyrants whom Sparta had set over
the people, and forced the Spartan garrison to surrender.

BATTLE OF LEUCTRA, 371 B.C.

The Thebans had now recovered their independence. Eight years later they totally defeated a
superior Peloponnesian force at the battle of Leuctra and brought the supremacy of Sparta to
an end. This engagement from a military standpoint is one of the most interesting in ancient
history. Epaminondas, the skilful Theban commander, massed his best troops in a solid column,
fifty men deep, and hurled it with terrific force against the Spartan ranks. The enemy, drawn
up twelve men deep in the customary formation, could not withstand the impact of the Theban
column; their lines gave way, and the fight was soon won. The battle destroyed once for all
the legend of Spartan invincibility.

PELOPIDAS AND EPAMINONDAS

The sudden rise of Thebes to the position of the first city in Greece was the work of two men
whose names are always linked together in the annals of the time. In Pelopidas and Epaminondas,
bosom friends and colleagues, Thebes found the heroes of her struggle for independence. Pelopidas
was a fiery warrior whose bravery and daring won the hearts of his soldiers. Epaminondas was
both an able general and an eminent statesman. No other Greek, save perhaps Pericles, can be
compared with him. Even Pericles worked for Athens alone and showed no regard for the rest
of Greece. Epaminondas had nobler ideals and sought the general good of the Hellenic race.
He fought less to destroy Sparta than to curb that city's power of doing harm. He aimed not
so much to make Thebes mistress of an empire as to give her a proper place among Greek cities.
The Thebans, indeed, sometimes complained that Epaminondas loved Hellas more than his native city.

BATTLE OF MANTINEA, 362 B.C.

By crippling Sparta, Epaminondas raised Thebes to a position of supremacy. Had he been spared
for a longer service, Epaminondas might have realized his dream of bringing unity and order
into the troubled politics of his time. But circumstances were too strong for him. The Greek
states, which had accepted the leadership of Athens and Sparta, were unwilling to admit the
claims of Thebes to a position of equal power and importance. The period of Theban rule was
filled, therefore, with perpetual conflict. Nine years after Leuctra Epaminondas himself fell
in battle at Mantinea in the Peloponnesus, and with his death ended the brief glory of Thebes.

38. DECLINE OF THE CITY-STATE

WEAKNESS OF CITY-STATES

The battle of Mantinea proved that no single city--Athens, Sparta, or Thebes--was strong enough
to rule Greece. By the middle of the fourth century B.C. it had become evident that a great
Hellenic power could the not be created out of the little, independent city-states of Greece.

A RECORD OF ALMOST CEASELESS CONFLICT

The history of Continental Hellas for more than a century after the close of the Persian War
had been a record of almost ceaseless conflict. We have seen how Greece came to be split up
into two great alliances, the one a naval league ruled by Athens, the other a confederacy of
Peloponnesian cities under the leadership of Sparta. How the Delian League became the Athenian
Empire; how Sparta began a long war with Athens to secure the independence of the subject states
and ended it by reducing them to her own supremacy; how the rough-handed sway of Sparta led
to the revolt of her allies and dependencies and the sudden rise of Thebes to supremacy; how
Thebes herself established an empire on the ruins of Spartan rule-- this is a story of fruitless
and exhausting struggles which sounded the knell of Greek liberty and the end of the city-state.

THE FUTURE

Far away in the north, remote from the noisy conflicts of Greek political life, a new power
was slowly rising to imperial greatness--no insignificant city-state, but an extensive territorial
state like those of modern times. Three years after the battle of Mantinea Philip II ascended
the throne of Macedonia. He established Hellenic unity by bringing the Hellenic people within
a widespread empire. Alexander the Great, the son of this king, carried Macedonian dominion
and Greek culture to the ends of the known world. To this new period of ancient history we
now turn.

CHAPTER VI

MINGLING OF EAST AND WEST AFTER 359 B.C. [1]

39. PHILIP AND THE RISE OF MACEDONIA

MACEDONIA AND THE MACEDONIANS

The land of Macedonia, lying to the north of Greece, for a long time had been an inconspicuous
part of the ancient world. Its people, though only partially civilized, were Greeks in blood
and language. No doubt they formed an offshoot of those northern invaders who had entered the
Balkan peninsula before the dawn of history. The Macedonian kings, from the era of the Persian
wars, seized every opportunity of spreading Greek culture throughout their realm. By the middle
of the fourth century B.C., when Philip II ascended the throne, the Macedonians were ready
to take a leading place in the Greek world.

PHILIP'S AIMS

Philip of Macedonia, one of the most remarkable men of antiquity, was endowed with a vigorous
body, a keen mind, and a resolute will. He was no stranger to Greece and its ways. Part of
his boyhood had been passed as a hostage at Thebes in the days of Theban glory. His residence
there gave him an insight into Greek politics and taught him the art of war as it had been
perfected by Epaminondas. In the distracted condition of Greece, worn out by the rivalries
of contending cities, Philip saw the opportunity of his own country. He aimed to secure for
Macedonia the position of supremacy which neither Athens, Sparta, nor Thebes had been able
to maintain.

THE MACEDONIAN ARMY

Philip's most important achievement was the creation of the Macedonian army, which he led to
the conquest of Greece and which his son was to lead to the conquest of the World. Taking a
hint from the tactics of Epaminondas, Philip trained his infantry to fight by columns, but
with sufficient intervals between the files to permit quick and easy movements. Each man bore
an enormous lance, eighteen feet in length. When this heavy phalanx was set in array, the weapons
carried by the soldiers in the first five ranks presented a bristling thicket of lance-points,
which no onset, however determined, could penetrate. The business of the phalanx was to keep
the front of the foe engaged, while horsemen rode into the enemy's flanks. This reliance on
masses of cavalry to win a victory was something new in warfare. Another novel feature consisted
in the use of engines called catapults, able to throw darts and huge stones three hundred yards,
and of battering rams with force enough to hurl down the walls of cities. All these different
arms working together made a war machine of tremendous power--the most formidable in the ancient
world until the days of the Roman legion.

CONQUESTS OF PHILIP

Philip commanded a fine army; he ruled with absolute sway a territory larger than any other
Hellenic state; and he himself possessed a genius for both war and diplomacy, With such advantages
the Macedonian king entered on the subjugation of disunited Greece. His first great success
was won in western Thrace. Here he founded the city of Philippi [2] and seized some rich gold
mines, the income from which enabled him to keep his soldiers always under arms, to fit out
a fleet, and, by means of liberal bribes, to hire a crowd of agents in nearly every Greek city.
Philip next made Macedonia a maritime state by subduing the Greek cities on the peninsula of
Chalcidice. [3] He also appeared in Thessaly, occupied its principal fortresses, and brought
the frontier of Macedonia as far south as the pass of Thermopylae.

40. DEMOSTHENES AND THE END OF GREEK FREEDOM

DEMOSTHENES, 384-322 B.C.

Philip for many years had been steadily extending his sway over Greece. In the face of his
encroachments would Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, so long the leading cities, submit tamely to
this Macedonian conqueror? There was one man, at least, who realized the menace to Greek freedom
from Philip's onward march. In Demosthenes Greece found a champion of her threatened liberties.

DEMOSTHENES AS AN ORATOR AND A PATRIOT

Demosthenes was the last, as well as the most famous, of the great Athenian orators. When he
first began to speak, the citizens laughed at his long, involved sentences, over-rapid delivery,
and awkward bearing. Friends encouraged him to persist, assuring him that, if the manner of
his speeches was bad, their matter was worthy of Pericles. Numerous stories are told of the
efforts made by Demosthenes to overcome his natural defects. He practiced gesturing before
a mirror and, to correct a stammering pronunciation, recited verses with pebbles in his mouth.
He would go down to the seashore during storms and strive to make his voice heard above the
roar of wind and waves, in order the better to face the boisterous Assembly. Before long he
came to be regarded as the prince of speakers even in the city of orators. Demosthenes was
a man cast in the old heroic mold. His patriotic imagination had been fired by the great deeds
once accomplished by free Greeks. Athens he loved with passionate devotion. Let her remember
her ancient glories, he urged, and, by withstanding Philip, become the leader of Hellas in
a second war for liberty.

LAST STRUGGLE OF THE GREEKS

The stirring appeals of the great orator at first had little effect. There were many friends
of Philip in the Greek states, even in Athens itself. When, however, Philip entered central
Greece and threatened the independence of its cities, the eloquence of Demosthenes met a readier
response. In the presence of the common danger Thebes and Athens gave up their ancient rivalry
and formed a defensive alliance against Philip. Had it been joined by Sparta and the other
Peloponnesian states, it is possible that their united power might have hurled back the invader.
But they held aloof.

BATTLE OF CHAERONEA, 338 B.C.

The decisive battle was fought at Chaeronea in Boeotia. On that fatal field the well-drilled
and seasoned troops of Macedonia, headed by a master of the art of war, overcame the citizen
levies of Greece. The Greeks fought bravely, as of old, and their defeat was not inglorious.
Near the modern town of Chaeronea the traveler can still see the tomb where the fallen heroes
were laid, and the marble lion set up as a memorial to their dauntless struggle.

PHILIP'S POLICY AS A CONQUEROR

Chaeronea gave Philip the undisputed control of Greece. But now that victory was assured, he
had no intention of playing the tyrant. He compelled Thebes to admit a Macedonian garrison
to her citadel, but treated Athens so mildly that the citizens were glad to conclude with him
a peace which left their possessions untouched. Philip entered the Peloponnesus as a liberator.
Its towns and cities welcomed an alliance with so powerful a protector against Sparta.

CONGRESS AT CORINTH, 337 B.C.

Having completely realized his design of establishing Macedonian rule over Greece, Philip's
restless energy drove him forward to the next step in his ambitious program. He determined
to carry out the plans, so long cherished by the Greeks, for an invasion of Asia Minor and,
perhaps, of Persia itself. In the year 337 B.C. a congress of all the Hellenic states met at
Corinth under Philip's presidency. The delegates voted to supply ships and men for the great
undertaking and placed Philip in command of the allied forces. A Macedonian king was to be
the captain-general of Hellas.

DEATH OF PHILIP, 336 B.C.

But Philip was destined never to lead an army across the Hellespont. Less than two years after
Chaeronea he was killed by an assassin, and the scepter passed to his young son, Alexander.

41. ALEXANDER THE GREAT

THE YOUTHFUL ALEXANDER

Alexander was only twenty years of age when he became ruler of Macedonia. From his father he
inherited the powerful Frame, the kingly figure, the masterful will, which made so deep an
impression on all his contemporaries. His mother, a proud and ambitious woman, told him that
the blood of Achilles ran in his veins, and bade him emulate the deeds of that national hero.
We know that he learned the Iliad by heart and always carried a copy of it on his campaigns.
As he came to manhood, Alexander developed into a splendid athlete, skillful in all the sports
of his rough-riding companions, and trained in every warlike exercise.

EDUCATION OF ALEXANDER BY ARISTOTLE

Philip believed that in Alexander he had a worthy son, for he persuaded Aristotle, [4] the
most learned man in Greece, to become the tutor of the young prince. The influence of that
philosopher remained with Alexander throughout life. Aristotle taught him to love Greek art
and science, and instilled into his receptive mind an admiration for all things Grecian. Alexander
used to say that, while he owed his life to his father, he owed to Aristotle the knowledge
of how to live worthily.

ALEXANDER CRUSHES REBELLION

The situation which Alexander faced on his accession might well have dismayed a less dauntless
spirit. Philip had not lived long enough to unite firmly his wide dominions. His unexpected
death proved the signal for uprisings and disorder. The barbarous Thracians broke out in widespread
rebellion, and the Greeks made ready to answer the call of Demosthenes to arms. But Alexander
soon set his kingdom in order. After crushing the tribes of Thrace, he descended on Greece
and besieged Thebes, which had risen against its Macedonian garrison. The city was soon captured;
its inhabitants were slaughtered or sold into slavery; and the place itself was destroyed.
The terrible fate of Thebes induced the other states to submit without further resistance.

SEEMING STRENGTH OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE

With Greece pacified, Alexander could proceed to the invasion of Persia. Since the days of
Darius the Great the empire had remained almost intact-- a huge, loosely-knit collection of
many different peoples, whose sole bond of union was their common allegiance to the Great King.
[5] Its resources were enormous. There were millions of men for the armies and untold wealth
in the royal treasuries. Yet the empire was a hollow shell.

EXPEDITION OF THE "TEN THOUSAND," 401-400 B.C.

Some seventy years before Alexander set forth on his expedition the Greeks had witnessed a
remarkable disclosure of the military weakness of Persia. One of those rare revolts which troubled
the security of the Persian Empire broke out in Asia Minor. It was headed by Cyrus the Younger,
a brother of the Persian monarch. Cyrus gathered a large body of native troops and also hired
about ten thousand Greek soldiers. He led this mixed force into the heart of the Persian dominions,
only to fall in battle at Cunaxa, near Babylon. The Greeks easily routed the enemy arrayed
against them, but the death of Cyrus made their victory fruitless. In spite of their desperate
situation the Greeks refused to surrender and started to return homewards. The Persians dogged
their footsteps, yet never ventured on a pitched battle. After months of wandering in Assyria
and Armenia the little band of intrepid soldiers finally reached Trapezus, (Modern Trebizond)
a Greek city on the Black Sea.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EXPEDITION

The story of this invasion of Persia and the subsequent retreat was written by the Athenian
Xenophon [6] in his Anabasis. It is one of the most interesting books that have come down to
us from antiquity. We can judge from it how vivid was the impression which the adventures of
the "Ten Thousand" made on the Greeks of Xenophon's time. A small army had marched to the center
of the Persian dominions, had overcome a host many times its size, and had returned to Greece
in safety. It was clear proof that the Persian power, however imposing on the outside, could
offer no effective resistance to an attack by a strong force of disciplined Greek soldiers.
Henceforth the Greeks never abandoned the idea of an invasion of Persia.

ALEXANDER'S INVASION

The gigantic task fell, however, to Alexander, as the champion of Hellas against the "barbarians."
With an army of less than forty thousand men Alexander destroyed an empire before which, for
two centuries, all Asia had been wont to tremble. History, ancient or modern, contains no other
record of conquests so widespread, so thorough, so amazingly rapid.

42. CONQUEST OF PERSIA AND THE FAR EAST, 334-323 B.C.

BATTLE OF THE GRANICUS, 334 B.C.

Alexander crossed the Hellespont in the spring of the year 334 B.C. He landed not far from
the historic plain of Troy and at once began his march along the coast. Near the little river
Granicus the satraps of Asia Minor had gathered an army to dispute his passage. Alexander at
once led his cavalry across the river in an impetuous charge, which soon sent the Persian troops
in headlong flight. The victory cost the Macedonians scarcely a hundred men; but it was complete.
As Alexander passed southward, town after town opened its gates--first Sardis, next Ephesus,
then all the other cities of Ionia. They were glad enough to be free of Persian control. Within
a year Asia Minor was a Macedonian possession.

BATTLE OF ISSUS, 333 B.C.

In the meantime Darius III, the Persian king, had been making extensive preparations to meet
the invader. He commanded half a million men, but he followed Alexander too hastily and had
to fight in a narrow defile on the Syrian coast between the mountains and the sea. In such
cramped quarters numbers did not count. The battle became a massacre, and only the approach
of night stayed the swords of the victorious Macedonians. A great quantity of booty, including
the mother, wife, and children of Darius, fell into Alexander's hands. He treated his royal
captives kindly, but refused to make peace with the Persian king.

CAPTURE OF TYRE, 332 B.C.

The next step was to subdue the Phoenician city of Tyre, the headquarters of Persia's naval
power. The city lay on a rocky island, half a mile from the shore. Its fortifications rose
one hundred feet above the waves. Although the place seemed impregnable, Alexander was able
to capture it after he had built a mole, or causeway, between the shore and the island. Powerful
siege engines then breached the walls, the Macedonians poured in, and Tyre fell by storm. Thousands
of its inhabitants perished and thousands more were sold into slavery. The great emporium of
the East became a heap of ruins.

ALEXANDER IN EGYPT

From Tyre Alexander led his ever-victorious army through Syria into Egypt. The Persian forces
here offered little resistance, and the Egyptians themselves welcomed Alexander as a deliverer.
The conqueror entered Memphis in triumph and then sailed down the Nile to its western mouth,
where he laid the foundations of Alexandria, a city which later became the metropolis of the
Orient.

ALEXANDER IN LIBYA

Another march brought Alexander to the borders of Libya, Here he received the submission of
Cyrene, the most important Greek colony in Africa. [7] Alexander's dominions were thus extended
to the border of the Carthaginian possessions. It was at this time that Alexander visited a
celebrated temple of the god Amon, located in an oasis of the Libyan desert. The priests were
ready enough to hail him as a son of Amon, as one before whom his Egyptian subjects might bow
down and adore. But after Alexander's death his worship spread widely over the world, and even
the Roman Senate gave him a place among the gods of Olympus.

BATTLE OF ARBELA, 331 B.C.

The time had now come to strike directly at the Persian king. Following the ancient trade routes
through northern Mesopotamia, Alexander crossed the Euphrates and the Tigris and, on a broad
plain not far from the ruins of ancient Nineveh, [8] found himself confronted by the Persian
host. Darius held an excellent position and hoped to crush his foe by sheer weight of numbers.
But nothing could stop the Macedonian onset; once more Darius fled away, and once more the
Persians, deserted by their king, broke up in hopeless rout.

END OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE

The battle of Arbela decided the fate of the Persian Empire. It remained only to gather the
fruits of victory. The city of Babylon surrendered without a struggle. Susa, with its enormous
treasure, fell into the conqueror's hands. Persepolis, the old Persian capital, was given up
to fire and sword. [9] Darius himself, as he retreated eastward, was murdered by his own men.
With the death of Darius the national war of Greece against Persia came to an end.

CONQUEST OF IRAN

The Macedonians had now overrun all the Persian provinces except distant Iran and India. These
countries were peopled of by warlike tribes of a very different stamp from the effeminate Persians.
Alexander might well have been content to leave them undisturbed, but the man could never rest
while there were still conquests to be made. Long marches and much hard fighting were necessary
to subdue the tribes about the Caspian and the inhabitants of the countries now known as Afghanistan
and Turkestan.

CONQUEST OF INDIA

Crossing the lofty barrier of the Hindu-Kush, Alexander led his weary soldiers into northwestern
India, where a single battle added the Persian province of the Punjab [10] to the Macedonian
possessions. Alexander then pressed forward to the conquest of the Ganges valley, but in the
full tide of victory his troops refused to go any farther. They had had their fill of war and
martial glory; they would conquer no more lands for their ambitious king. Alexander gave with
reluctance the order for the homeward march.

ALEXANDER'S RETURN TO BABYLON

Alexander was of too adventurous a disposition to return by the way he had come. He resolved
to reach Babylon by a new route. He built a navy on the Indus and had it accompany the army
down the river. At the mouth of the Indus Alexander dispatched the fleet under his admiral,
Nearchus, to explore the Indian Ocean and to discover, if possible, a sea route between India
and the West. He himself led the army, by a long and toilsome march through the deserts of
southern Iran, to Babylon. That city now became the capital of the Macedonian Empire.

DEATH OF ALEXANDER, 323 B.C.

Scarcely two years after his return, while he was planning yet more extensive conquests in
Arabia, Africa, and western Europe, he was smitten by the deadly Babylonian fever. In 323 B.C.,
after several days of illness, the conqueror of the world passed away, being not quite thirty-
three years of age.

43. THE WORK OF ALEXANDER

ALEXANDER AS WARRIOR AND STATESMAN

Alexander the Great was one of the foremost, perhaps the first, of the great captains of antiquity.
But he was more than a world-conqueror; he was a statesman of the highest order. Had he been
spared for an ordinary lifetime, there is no telling how much he might have accomplished. In
eleven years he had been able to subdue the East and to leave an impress upon it which was
to endure for centuries. And yet his work had only begun. There were still lands to conquer,
cities to build, untrodden regions to explore. Above all, it was still his task to shape his
possessions into a well-knit, unified empire, which would not fall to pieces in the hands of
his successors. His early death was a calamity, for it prevented the complete realization of
his splendid ambitions.

HELLENIZING OF THE ORIENT

The immediate result of Alexander's conquests was the disappearance of the barriers which had
so long shut in the Orient. The East, until his day, was an almost unknown land. Now it lay
open to the spread of Greek civilization. In the wake of the Macedonian armies followed Greek
philosophers and scientists, Greek architects and artists, Greek colonists, merchants, and
artisans. Everywhere into that huge, inert, unprogressive Oriental world came the active and
enterprising men of Hellas. They brought their arts and culture and became the teachers of
those whom they had called "barbarians."

FUSION OF EAST AND WEST

The ultimate result of Alexander's conquests was the fusion of East and West. He realized that
his new empire must contain a place for Oriental, as well as for Greek and East and Macedonian,
subjects. It was Alexander's aim, therefore, to build up a new state in which the distinction
between the European and the Asiatic should gradually pass away. He welcomed Persian nobles
to his court and placed them in positions of trust. He organized the government of his provinces
on a system resembling that of Darius the Great. [11] He trained thousands of Persian soldiers
to replace the worn-out veterans in his armies. He encouraged by liberal dowries mixed marriages
between Macedonians and Orientals, and himself wedded the daughter of the last Persian king.
To hold his dominions together and provide a meeting place for both classes of his subjects,
he founded no less than seventy cities in different parts of the empire. Such measures as these
show that Alexander had a mind of wide, even cosmopolitan, sympathies. They indicate the loss
which ancient civilization suffered by his untimely end.

44. HELLENISTIC KINGDOMS AND CITIES

THE THREE GREAT KINGDOMS

The half century following Alexander's death is a confused and troubled period in ancient history.
The king had left no legitimate son--no one with an undisputed title to the succession. On
his deathbed Alexander had himself declared that the realm should go "to the strongest." [12]
It was certain, under these circumstances, that his possessions would become the prey of the
leading Macedonian generals. The unwieldy empire at length broke in pieces. Out of the fragments
arose three great states, namely, Macedonia, Egypt, and Syria. The kingdom of Egypt was ruled
by Ptolemy, one of Alexander's generals. Seleucus, another of his generals, established the
kingdom of Syria. It comprised nearly all western Asia. These kingdoms remained independent
until the era of Roman conquest in the East.

MINOR INDEPENDENT STATES

Several small states also arose from the break-up of Alexander's empire. [13] Each had its
royal dynasty, its capital city, and its own national life. Thus the conquests of Alexander,
instead of establishing a world- power under one ruler, led to the destruction of the unity
of government which Persia had given to the East.

CITY LIFE IN THE ORIENT

More significant for the history of civilization than these kingdoms were the Hellenistic [14]
cities, which from the time of Alexander arose in every part of the eastern world. Some were
only garrison towns in the heart of remote provinces or outposts along the frontiers. Many
more, however, formed busy centers of trade and industry, and became seats of Greek influence
in the Orient. Such cities were quite unlike the old Greek city-states. [15] They were not
free and independent, but made a part of the kingdom in which they were situated. The inhabitants
consisted of Greeks and Macedonians, comprising the governing class, together with native artisans
and merchants who had abandoned their village homes for life in a metropolis. In appearance,
also, these cities contrasted with those of old Greece. They had broad streets, well paved
and sometimes lighted at night, enjoyed a good water supply, and possessed baths, theaters,
and parks.

ALEXANDRIA

In the third century B.C. the foremost Hellenistic city was Alexandria. It lay on a strip of
flat, sandy land separating Lake Mareotis from the Mediterranean. On the one side was the lake-harbor,
connected with the Nile; on the other side were two sea-harbors, sheltered from the open sea
by the long and narrow island of Pharos. [16] The city possessed a magnificent site for commerce.
It occupied the most central position that could be found in the ancient world with respect
to the three continents, Africa, Asia, and Europe. The prosperity which this port has enjoyed
for more than two thousand years is ample evidence of the wisdom which led to its foundation.

ANTIOCH

The chief city in the kingdom of Syria was splendid and luxurious Antioch. It lay in the narrow
valley of the Orontes River, so close to both the Euphrates and the Mediterranean that it soon
became an important commercial center. The city must have been a most delightful residence,
with its fine climate, its location on a clear and rapid stream, and the near presence of the
Syrian hills. In the sixth century A.D. repeated earthquakes laid Antioch in ruins. The city
never recovered its prosperity, though a modern town, Antakia, still marks the site of the
once famous capital.

PERGAMUM

Asia Minor, during this period, contained many Hellenistic cities. One of the most important
was Pergamum, the capital of a small but independent kingdom of the same name. Its rulers earned
the gratitude of all the Greeks by their resistance to the terrible Gauls. About fifty years
after Alexander's death this barbarous people, pouring down from central Europe, had ravaged
Greece and invaded Asia Minor. The kings of Pergamum celebrated their victories over the Gauls
with so many works of architecture and sculpture that their city became the artistic rival
of Athens.

RHODES

One other great Hellenistic center existed in the island city of Rhodes. Founded during the
closing years of the Peloponnesian War, Rhodes soon distanced Athens in the race for commercial
supremacy. The merchants of Rhodes framed admirable laws, especially for business affairs,
and many of these were incorporated in the Roman code. Rhodes was celebrated for art. No less
than three thousand statues adorned the streets and public buildings. It was also a favorite
place of education for promising orators and writers. During Roman days many eminent men, Cicero
and Julius Caesar among them, studied oratory at Rhodes.

45. THE HELLENISTIC AGE

HELLENISTIC LITERATURE

These splendid cities in the Orient were the centers of much literary activity. Their inhabitants,
whether Hellenic or "barbarian," used Greek as a common language. During this period Greek
literature took on a cosmopolitan character. It no longer centered in Athens. Writers found
their audiences in all lands where Greeks had settled. At the same time literature became more
and more an affair of the study. The authors were usually professional bookmen writing for
a bookish public. They produced many works of literary criticism, prepared excellent grammars
and dictionaries, but wrote very little poetry or prose of enduring value.

THE MUSEUM AT ALEXANDRIA

The Hellenistic Age was distinguished as an age of learning. Particularly was this true at
Alexandria, where the Museum, founded by the first Macedonian king of Egypt, became a real
university. It contained galleries of art, an astronomical observatory, and even zoological
and botanical gardens. The Museum formed a resort for men of learning, who had the leisure
necessary for scholarly research. The beautiful gardens, with their shady walks, statues, and
fountains, were the haunt of thousands of students whom the fame of Alexandria attracted from
all parts of the civilized world.

THE ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY

In addition to the Museum there was a splendid library, which at one time contained over five
hundred thousand manuscripts--almost everything that had been written in antiquity. The chief
librarian ransacked private collections and purchased all the books he could find. Every book
that entered Egypt was brought to the Library, where slaves transcribed the manuscript and
gave a copy to the owner in place of the original. Before this time the manuscripts of celebrated
works were often scarce and always in danger of being lost. Henceforth it was known where to
look for them.

SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES

The Hellenistic Age was remarkable for the rapid advance of scientific knowledge. Most of the
mathematical works of the Greeks date from this epoch. Euclid wrote a treatise on geometry
which still holds its place in the schools. Archimedes of Syracuse, who had once studied at
Alexandria, made many discoveries in engineering. A water screw of his device is still in use.
He has the credit for finding out the laws of the lever. "Give me a fulcrum on which to rest,"
he said, "and I will move the earth." The Hellenistic scholars also made remarkable progress
in medicine. The medical school of Alexandria was well equipped with charts, models, and dissecting
rooms for the study of the human body. During the second century of our era all the medical
knowledge of antiquity was gathered up in the writings of Galen (born about 130 A.D.). For
more than a thousand years Galen of Pergamum remained the supreme authority in medicine.

ANCIENT AND MODERN SCIENCE COMPARED

In scientific work it seems as if the Greeks had done almost all that could be accomplished
by sheer brain power aided only by rude instruments. They had no real telescopes or microscopes,
no mariner's compass or chronometer, and no very delicate balances. Without such inventions
the Greeks could hardly proceed much farther with their researches. Modern scientists are perhaps
no better thinkers than were those of antiquity, but they have infinitely better apparatus
and can make careful experiments where the Greeks had to rely on shrewd guesses.

EXTENSION OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE

During the Hellenistic Age men began to gain more accurate ideas regarding the shape and size
of the habitable globe. Such events as the expedition of the "Ten Thousand" [17] and Alexander's
conquests in central Asia and India brought new information about the countries and peoples
of the Orient. During Alexander's lifetime a Greek named Pytheas, starting from Massilia, [18]
made an adventurous voyage along the shores of Spain and Gaul and spent some time in Britain.
He was probably the first Greek to visit that island.

ERATOSTHENES, ABOUT 276-194 B.C.

All this new knowledge of East and West was soon gathered together by Eratosthenes, the learned
librarian of Alexandria. He was the founder of scientific geography. Before his time some students
had already concluded that the earth is spherical and not flat, as had been taught in the Homeric
poems. [19] Guesses had even been made of the size of the earth. Eratosthenes by careful measurements
came within a few thousand miles of its actual circumference. Having estimated the size of
the earth, Eratosthenes went on to determine how large was its habitable area. He reached the
conclusion that the distance from the strait of Gibraltar to the east of India was about one-third
of the earth's circumference. The remaining two-thirds, he thought, was covered by the sea.
And with what seems a prophecy he remarked that, if it was not for the vast extent of the Atlantic
Ocean, one might almost sail from Spain to India along the same parallel of latitude.

PTOLEMY

The next two centuries after Eratosthenes saw the spread of Roman rule over Greeks and Carthaginians
in the Mediterranean and over the barbarous inhabitants of Gaul, Britain, and Germany. The
new knowledge thus gained was summed up in the Greek Geography by Ptolemy [20] of Alexandria.
His famous map shows how near he came to the real outlines both of Europe and Asia.

THE PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM

Ptolemy was likewise an eminent astronomer. He believed that the earth was the center of the
universe and that the sun, planets, and fixed stars all revolved around it. This Ptolemaic
system was not overthrown until the grand discovery of Copernicus in the sixteenth century
of our era.

46. THE GRAECO-ORIENTAL WORLD

THE NEW LUXURY

The Hellenistic Age was characterized by a general increase in wealth. The old Greeks and Macedonians,
as a rule, had been content to live plainly. Now kings, nobles, and rich men began to build
splendid palaces and to fill them with the products of ancient art--marbles from Asia Minor,
vases from Athens, Italian bronzes, and Babylonian tapestries. They kept up great households
with endless lords in waiting, ladies of honor, pages, guards, and servants. Soft couches and
clothes of delicate fabric replaced the simple coverlets and coarse cloaks of an earlier time.
They possessed rich carpets and hangings, splendid armor and jewelry, and gold and silver vessels
for the table. The Greeks thus began to imitate the luxurious lives of Persian nobles.

THE SEA ROUTE TO INDIA

These new luxuries flowed in from all parts of the ancient world. Many came from the Far East
in consequence of the rediscovery of the sea route to India, by Alexander's admiral, Nearchus.
[21] The voyage of Nearchus was one of the most important results of Alexander's eastern conquests.
It established the fact, which had long been forgotten, that one could reach India by a water
route much shorter and safer than the caravan roads through central Asia. [22] Somewhat later
a Greek sailor, named Harpalus, found that by using the monsoons, the periodic winds which
blow over the Indian Ocean, he could sail direct from Arabia to India without laboriously following
the coast. The Greeks, in consequence, gave his name to the monsoons.

ORIENTAL INFLUENCE ON THE GREEKS

All this sudden increase of wealth, all the thousand new enjoyments with which life was now
adorned and enriched, did not work wholly for good. With luxury there went, as always, laxity
in morals. Contact with the vice and effeminacy of the East tended to lessen the manly vigor
of the Greeks, both in Asia and in Europe. Hellas became corrupt, and she in turn corrupted Rome.

GREEK INFLUENCE ON THE ORIENT

Yet the most interesting, as well as the most important, feature of the age is the diffusion
of Hellenic culture--the "Hellenizing" of the Orient. It was, indeed, a changed world in which
men were now living. Greek cities, founded by Alexander and his successors, stretched from
the Nile to the Indus, dotted the shores of the Black Sea and Caspian, and arose amid the wilds
of central Asia.

THE NEW COSMOPOLITANISM

Thus, in the period after Alexander the long struggle between East and West reached a peaceful
conclusion. The distinction between Greek and Barbarian gradually faded away, and the ancient
world became ever more unified in sympathies and aspirations. It was this mingled civilization
of Orient and Occident with which the Romans were now to come in contact, as they pushed their
conquering arms beyond Italy into the eastern Mediterranean.

CHAPTER VII

THE RISE OF ROME TO 264 B.C. [1]

47. ITALY AND SICILY

THE APENNINES

The shape of Italy is determined by the course of the Apennines. Branching off from the Alps
at the gulf of Genoa, these mountains cross the peninsula in an easterly direction, almost
to the Adriatic. Here they turn sharply to the southeast and follow the coast for a considerable
distance. The plains of central Italy, in consequence, are all on the western slope of the
Apennines. In the lower part of the peninsula the range swerves suddenly to the southwest,
so that the level land is there on the eastern side of the mountains. Near the southern extremity
of Italy the Apennines separate into two branches, which penetrate the "heel and toe" of the
peninsula.

DIVISIONS OF ITALY

Italy may be conveniently divided into a northern, a central, and a southern section. These
divisions, however, are determined by the direction of the mountains and not, as in Greece,
chiefly by inlets of the sea. Northern Italy contains the important region known in ancient
times as Cisalpine Gaul. This is a perfectly level plain two hundred miles in length, watered
by the Po (Padus), which the Romans called the "king of rivers," because of its length and
many tributary streams. Central Italy, lying south of the Apennines, includes seven districts,
of which the three on the western coast--Etruria, Latium, and Campania--were most conspicuous
in ancient history. Southern Italy, because of its warm climate and deeply indented coast,
early attracted many Greek colonists. Their colonies here came to be known as Magna Graecia,
or Great Greece.

SICILY

The triangular-shaped island of Sicily is separated from Italy by the strait of Messina, a
channel which, at the narrowest part, is only two miles wide. At one time Sicily must have
been joined to the mainland. Its mountains, which rise at their highest point in the majestic
volcano of Aetna, nearly eleven thousand feet above sea level, are a continuation of those
of Italy. The greater part of Sicily is remarkably productive, containing rich grainfields
and hillsides green with the olive and the vine. Lying in the center of the Mediterranean and
in the direct route of merchants and colonists from every direction, Sicily has always been
a meeting place of nations. In antiquity Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans contended for the
possession of this beautiful island.

INFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS

On Italian history, as on that of Greece, [2] we are able to trace the profound influence of
geographical conditions. In the first place, the peninsula of Italy is not cut up by a tangle
of mountains into many small districts. Hence it was easier for the Italians, than for the
Greeks, to establish one large and united state. In the second place, Italy, which has few
good harbors but possesses fine mountain pastures and rich lowland plains, was better adapted
to cattle raising and agriculture than was Greece. The Italian peoples, in consequence, instead
of putting to sea, remained a conservative, home-staying folk, who were slow to adopt the customs
of other nations. Finally, the location of Italy, with its best harbors and most numerous islands
on the western coast, brought that country into closer touch with Gaul, Spain, and northwestern
Africa than with Greece and the Orient. Italy fronted the barbarous West.

48. THE PEOPLES OF ITALY

NEIGHBORS OF THE ROMANS

Long before the Romans built their city by the Tiber every part of Italy had become the home
of wandering peoples, attracted by the mild climate and rich soil of this favored land. Two
of these peoples were neighbors of the Romans--Etruscans on the north and Greeks on the south.

THE ETRUSCANS

The ancestors of the historic Etruscans were probably Aegean sea-rovers who settled in the
Italian peninsula before the beginning of the eighth century B.C. The immigrants mingled with
the natives and by conquest and colonization founded a strong power in the country to which
they gave their name--Etruria. At one time the Etruscans appear to have ruled over Campania
and also in the Po Valley as far as the Alps. Their colonies occupied the shores of Sardinia
and Corsica. Their fleets swept the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Etruscans for several centuries were
the leading nation in Italy.

ETRUSCAN CIVILIZATION

These Etruscans, like the Hittites of Asia Minor, [3] are a mysterious race. No one as yet
has been able to read their language, which is quite unlike any Indo-European tongue. The words,
however, are written in an alphabet borrowed from Greek settlers in Italy. Many other civilizing
arts besides the alphabet came to the Etruscans from abroad. Babylonia gave to them the principle
of the round arch and the practice of divination. [4] Etruscan graves contain Egyptian seals
adorned with hieroglyphics and beautiful vases bearing designs from Greek mythology. The Etruscans
were skillful workers in iron, bronze, and gold. They built their cities with massive walls,
arched gates, paved streets, and underground drains. In the course of time a great part of
this Etruscan civilization was absorbed in that of Rome.

THE GREEKS

As teachers of the Romans the Etruscans were followed by the Greeks. About the middle of the
eighth century B.C. Hellenic colonies began to occupy the coasts of Sicily and southern Italy.
The earliest Greek settlement was Cumae, near the bay of Naples. [5] It was a city as old as
Rome itself, and a center from which Greek culture, including the Greek alphabet, spread to
Latium. A glance at the map [6] shows that the chief Greek Colonies were all on or near the
Sea, from Campania to the gulf of Tarentum. North of the "heel" of Italy extends an almost
harborless coast, where nothing tempted the Greeks to settle. North of Campania, again, they
found the good harbors already occupied by the Etruscans. The Greeks, in consequence, were
never able to make Italy a completely Hellenic land. Room was left for the native Italian peoples,
under the leadership of Rome, to build up their own power in the peninsula.

THE ITALIAN HIGHLANDERS

The Italians were an Indo-European people who spoke a language closely related, on the one
side, to Greek and, on the other side, to the Celtic tongues of western Europe. They entered
Italy through the Alpine passes, long before the dawn of history, and gradually pushed southward
until they occupied the interior of the peninsula. At the beginning of historic times they
had separated into two main branches. The eastern and central parts of Italy formed the home
of the highlanders, grouped in various tribes. Among them were the Umbrians in the northeast,
the Sabines in the upper valley of the Tiber, and the Samnites in the south. Still other Italian
peoples occupied the peninsula as far as Magna Graecia.

THE LATINS

The western Italians were known as Latins. They dwelt in Latium, the "flat land" extending
south of the Tiber between the Apennines and the Tyrrhenian Sea. Residence in the lowlands,
where they bordered on the Etruscans, helped to make the Latins a civilized people. Their village
communities grew into larger settlements, until the whole of Latium became filled with a number
of independent city-states. The ties of kinship and the necessity of defense against Etruscan
and Sabine foes bound them together. At a very early period they had united in the Latin League,
under the headship of Alba Longa. Another city in this league was Rome.

49. THE ROMANS

FOUNDING OF ROME

Rome sprang from a settlement of Latin shepherds, farmers, and traders on the Palatine Mount.
[7] This was the central eminence in a group of low hills south of the Tiber, about fifteen
miles by water from the river's mouth. Opposite the Palatine community there arose on the Quirinal
Hill another settlement, which seems to have been an outpost of the Sabines. After much hard
fighting the rival hill towns united on equal terms into one state. The low marshy land between
the Palatine and Quirinal became the Forum, or common market place, and the steep rock, known
as the Capitoline, formed the common citadel. [8]

UNION OF THE SEVEN HILLS

The union of the Palatine and Quirinal settlements greatly increased the area and population
of the Roman city. In course of time settlements were made on the neighboring hills and these,
too, cast in their lot with Rome. Then a fortification, the so-called "Wall of Servius," was
built to bring them all within the boundaries of the enlarged community. Rome came into existence
as the City of the Seven Hills.

MYTHS OF EARLY ROME

Long after the foundation of Rome, when that city had grown rich and powerful, her poets and
historians delighted to relate the many myths which clustered about the earlier stages of her
career. According to these myths Rome began as a colony of Alba Longa, the capital of Latium.
The founder of this city was Ascanius, son of the Trojan prince Aeneas, who had escaped from
Troy on its capture by the Greeks and after long wanderings had reached the coast of Italy.
Many generations afterwards, when Numitor sat on the throne of Alba Longa, his younger brother,
Amulius, plotted against him and drove him into exile. He had Numitor's son put to death, and
forced the daughter, Rhea Silvia, to take the vows of a Vestal Virgin. [9]

ROMULUS AND REMUS

But Rhea Silvia, beloved by Mars, the god of war, gave birth to twin boys of more than human
size and beauty. The wicked Amulius ordered the children to be set adrift in a basket on the
Tiber. Heaven, however, guarded these offspring of a god; the river cast them ashore near Mount
Palatine, and a she-wolf came and nursed them. There they were discovered by a shepherd, who
reared them in his own household. When the twins, Romulus and Remus, reached manhood, they
killed Amulius and restored their grandfather to his kingdom. With other young men from Alba
Longa, they then set forth to build a new city on the Palatine, where they had been rescued.
As they scanned the sky to learn the will of the gods, six vultures, birds of Jupiter, appeared
to Remus; but twelve were seen by Romulus. So Romulus marked out the boundary of the city on
the Palatine, and Remus, who in derision leaped over the half-finished wall, he slew in anger.
Romulus thus became the sole founder of Rome and its first king.

SUCCESSORS OF ROMULUS

Romulus was followed by a Sabine, Numa Pompilius, who taught the Romans the arts of peace and
the worship of the gods. Another king destroyed Alba Longa and brought the inhabitants to Rome.
The last of Rome's seven kings was an Etruscan named Tarquin the Proud. His tyranny finally
provoked an uprising, and Rome became a republic.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MYTHS

These famous tales have become a part of the world's literature and still possess value to
the student. They show us what the Romans themselves believed about the foundation and early
fortunes of their city. Sometimes they refer to what seem to be facts, such as the first settlement
on the Palatine, the union with the Sabines on the Quirinal, the conquest of Alba Longa, and
Etruscan rule at Rome. The myths also contain so many references to customs and beliefs that
they are a great help in understanding the social life and religion of the early Romans.
