              Correspondence of the Honourable Horace Walpole

1749

13 Letter 1 To Sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, March 4, 1749.

I have been so shut up in the House of Commons for this last fortnight or three weeks, that
I have not had time to write you a line: we have not had such a session since the famous beginning
of last Parliament.  I am come hither for a day or two of rest and air, and find the additional
pleasure of great beauty in my improvements: I could talk to you through the whole sheet, and
with much more satisfaction, upon this head; but I shall postpone my own amusement to yours,
for I am sure you want much more to know what has been doing in Parliament than at Strawberry
Hill.  You will conclude that we have been fighting over the peace; but we have not.  It is
laid before Parliament, but will not be taken up; the Opposition foresee that a vote of approbation
would pass, and therefore will not begin upon it, as they wish to reserve it for censure in
the next reign--or perhaps the next reign does not care to censure now what he must hereafter
maintain--and the ministry do not seem to think their treaty so perfect as not to be liable
to blame, should it come to be canvassed.  We have been then upon several other matters: but
first I should tell you, that from the utmost tranquillity and impotence of a minority, there
is at once started up so formidable an Opposition as to divide 137 against 203.(1)  The minority
is headed by the Prince, who has continued opposing, though very unsuccessfully, ever since
the removal of Lord Granville, and the desertion of the patriots. He stayed till the Pelhams
had brought off every man of parts in his train, and then began to form his party.  Lord Granville
has never come into it., for fear of breaking with the King; and seems now to be patching up
again with his old enemies.  If Lord Bath has dealt with the Prince, it has been underhand.
His ministry has had at the head of it poor Lord Baltimore, a very good-natured, weak, honest
man; and Dr. Lee, a civilian, who was of Lord Granville's admiralty, and is still much attached
to him. He is a grave man, and a good speaker, but of no very bright parts, and, from his way
of life and profession, much ignorant of, and unfit for, a ministry.  You will wonder what
new resources the Prince has discovered-why, he has found them all in Lord Egmont, whom you
have heard of under the name of Lord Perceval; but his father, an Irish Earl, is lately dead.
As he is likely to make a very considerable figure in our history, I shall give you a more
particular account of him.  He has always earnestly studied our history and constitution and
antiquities, with very ambitious views; and practised speaking early in the Irish Parliament.
Indeed, this turn is his whole fund, for though he is between thirty and forty, he knows nothing
of the world, and is always unpleasantly dragging the conversation to political dissertations.
When the change in the ministry happened, and Lord Bath was so abused by the remnant of the
patriots, Lord Egmont published his celebrated pamphlet, called "Faction Detected," a work
which the Pitts and Lytteltons have never forgiven him; and which, though he continued voting
and sometimes speaking with the Pelhams, made him quite unpopular during all the last Parliament.
When the new elections approached, he stood on his own bottom at Weobly in Herefordshire; but
his election being contested, be applied for Mr. Pelham's support, who carried it for him in
the House of Commons.  This will always be a material blot in his life; for he had no sooner
secured his seat, than he openly attached himself to the Prince, and has since been made a
lord of his bedchamber.  At the opening of this session, he published an extreme good pamphlet,
which has made infinite noise, called "An Examination of the Principles and Conduct of the
two Brothers," (the Pelhams,) and as Dr. Lee has been laid up with the gout, Egmont has taken
the lead in the Opposition, and has made as great a figure as perhaps was ever made in so short
a time.  He is very bold and resolved, master of vast knowledge, and speaks at once with fire
and method.  His words are not picked and chosen like Pitt's, but his language is useful, clear,
and strong.  He has already by his parts and resolution mastered his great unpopularity, so
far as to be heard with the utmost attention, though I believe nobody had ever more various
difficulties to combat.  All the old corps hate him on my father and Mr. Pelham's account;
the new part of the ministry on their own.  The Tories have not quite forgiven his having left
them in the last Parliament: besides that, they are now governed by one Prowse, a cold, plausible
fellow. and a great well-wisher to Mr. Pelham.  Lord Strange,(3) a busy Lord of a party by
himself, yet voting generally with the Tories, continually clashes with Lord Egmont; and besides
all this, there is a faction in the Prince's family, headed by Nugent, who are for moderate
measures.

Nugent is most affectedly an humble servant of Mr. Pell)afn, and seems only to have attached
himself to the Prince, in order to make the better bargain with the ministry; he has great
parts, but they never know how to disentangle themselves from bombast and absurdities.  Besides
those, there are two young men who make some figure in the rising Opposition, Bathurst(4) attorney
to the Prince; and Potter, whom I believe you have had mentioned in my letters of last year;
but he has a bad constitution, and is seldom able to be in town.  Neither of these are in the
scale of moderation.

The Opposition set out this winter with trying to call for several negotiations during the
war; but the great storm which has so much employed us of late, was stirred up by Colonel Lyttelton;(5)
who, having been ill-treated by the Duke, has been dealing with the Prince.  He discovered
to the House some innovations in the Mutiny-bill, of which, though he could not make much,
the Opposition have, and fought the bill for a whole fortnight; during the course of which
the world has got much light into many very arbitrary proceedings of the Commander-in-chief,(6)
which have been the more believed too by the defection of my Lord Townshend's(7) eldest son,
who is one of his aide-de-camps.  Though the ministry, by the weight of numbers, have carried
their point in a great measure, yet you may be sure great heats have been raised; and those
have been still more inflamed by a correspondent practice in a new Navy-bill, brought in by
the direction of Lord Sandwich and Lord Anson, but vehemently opposed by half the fleet, headed
by Sir Peter Warren, the conqueror of Cape Breton, richer than Anson, and absurd as Vernon.
The bill has even been petitioned against, and the mutinous were likely to go great lengths,
if' the admiralty had not bought off some by money, and others by relaxing in the material
points.- We began upon it yesterday, and are still likely to have a long affair of it-so much
for politics: and as for any thing else, I scarce know any thing else.  My Lady Huntingdon,(8)
the Queen of the Methodists, has got her daughter named for lady of the bedchamber to the Princesses;
but it is all off again. as she will not let her play at cards on Sundays.  It is equally absurd
on both sides, to refuse it, or to insist upon it.

Pray tell Dr. Cocchi that I shall be extremely ready to do him any service in his intended
edition of the old Physicians,(9) but that I fear it is a kind of work that will lie very little
within my sphere to promote.  Learning is confined to very narrow bounds at present, and those
seldom within the circle in which I necessarily live; but my regard for him and for you would
make me take any pains.  You see, I believe, that I do take pains for you--I have not writ

P. S. I am very sorry for your sake that the Prince and Princess(10) are leaving Florence;
if ever I return thither, as I always flatter myself I shall, I should miss them extremely.

16 Letter 2 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, March 23, 1749.

Our debates on the two military bills, the naval one of which is not yet finished, have been
so tedious, that they have rather whittled down the Opposition than increased it.  In the Lords,
the Mutiny-bill passed pretty easily, there happening no quarrel between Lord Bathurst and
Lord Bath on the method of their measures; so there never divided above sixteen in the minority,
and those scarce any of the Prince's Lords.  Duke William was there and voted, which was too
indecent in a rigorous bill calculated for his own power.  There is a great disunion among
the ministers on the Naval bill: Mr. Pelham and Pitt (the latter out of hatred and jealousy
of Lord Sandwich) gave up the admiralty in a material point, but the paramount little Duke
of Bedford has sworn that they shall recant on the report-what a figure they will make! This
bill was chiefly of Anson's projecting, who grows every day into new unpopularity.(11)  He
has lately had a sea-piece drawn of the victory for which he was lorded, in which his own ship
in a cloud of cannon was boarding the French Admiral.  This circumstance, which was as true
as if Mademoiselle Scudery had written his life (for he was scarce in sight when the Frenchman
struck to Boscawen)(12) has been so ridiculed by the whole tar-hood, that the romantic part
has been forced to be cancelled, and one only gun remains firing at Anson's ship. The two Secretaries
of State(13) grow every day nearer to a breach; the King's going abroad is to decide the contest.
Newcastle, who Hanoverizes more and more every day, pushes on the journey, as he is to be the
attendant minister: his lamentable brother is the constant sacrifice of all these embroils.

At the Leicester-house the jars are as great: Doddington, who
has just resigned the treasuryship of the navy, in hopes of
once more governing that court (and there is no court where he
has not once or twice tried the same scheme!) does not succeed:
Sir Francis Dashwood and Lord Talbot are strongly for him-could
one conceive that he could still find a dupe? Mr. Fox had a
mind to succeed him, but both King and Duke have so earnestly
pressed him to remain secretary at war, that he could not
refuse.  The King would not hear of any of the newer court; and
Legge, who of the old was next oars, has managed in the
Prussian business so clumsily, that the King would not bear him
in his closet: but he has got the navy-office, which Lyttelton
would have had, but could not be rechosen at his borough, which
he had stolen by surprise from his old friend and brother Tom
Pitt.  The treasury is to be filled up with that toad-eater and
spy to all parties, Harry Vane:(14) there is no enumerating all
the circumstances that make his nomination scandalous and
ridiculous!-but such is our world! General Charles Howard and a
Mr. Saville are named to the red riband.
 My friend the Duke of Modena is again coming hither, which
astonishes me, considering how little reason he had to be
satisfied with his first visit; and sure he will have less now!
I believe I told you that King Theodore(15) is here: I am to
drink coffee with him to-morrow at Lady Schaub's.  I have
curiosity to see him, though I am not commonly fond of sights,
but content myself with the oil-cloth picture of them that is
hung out, and to which they seldom come up.  There are two
black Princes of Anamaboe here, who are in fashion at all the
assemblies, of whom I scarce know any particulars, though their
story(16) is very like Oroonoko's: all the women know it-and
ten times more than belongs to it.  Apropos to Indian
historians, half our thoughts are taken up--that is, my Lord
Halifax's are--with colonizing in Nova Scotia: my friend
Colonel Cornwallis is going thither commander-in-chief.  The
Methodists will scarce follow him as they did Oglethorpe; since
the period of his expedition,(17) their lot is fallen in a
better land.  Methodism is more fashionable than any thing but
brag; the women play very deep at both--as deep, it is much
suspected, as the matrons of Rome did at the mysteries of the
Bona Dea.  If gracious Anne was alive, she would make an
admirable defendress of the new faith, and build fifty more
churches for female proselytes.

If I had more paper or time, I could tell you an excellent long history of my brother Ned'S(18)
envy, which was always up at highwater-mark, but since the publication of my book of Houghton
(one should have thought a very harmless performance), has overflowed on a thousand ridiculous
occasions.  Another great object of his jealousy is my friendship with Mr. Fox: my brother
made him a formal visit at nine o'clock the other morning, and in a set speech of three quarters
of an hour, begged his pardon for not attending the last day of the Mutiny bill, which, he
said was so particularly brought in by him, though Mr. Fox assured him that he had no farther
hand in it than from his office.  Another instance: when my brother went to live at Frogmore,
Mr. Fox desired him to employ his tradesmen at Windsor, by way of supporting his interest in
that borough.  My brother immediately went to the Duke of St. Albans, to whom he had never
spoke, (nor indeed was his acquaintance with Mr. Fox much greater), and notified to him, that
if seven years hence his grace should have any contest with Mr. Fox about that borough, he
should certainly espouse the latter.  Guess how the Duke stared at so strange and unnecessary
a declaration!

Pigwiggin's Princess has mis-pigged, to the great joy, I believe, of that family, for you know
a child must have eaten. Adieu!

(11) It was entitled, A bill for amending, explaining, and reducing into one act, the laws
relating to the Navy. "it was," says Sir John Barrow, "a most desirable and highly useful measure.
The principal and , indeed, the only novelties attempted to be introduced, were, first, that
of subjecting half pay officers to courts-martial, which after much opposition was thrown out;
the second was the administration of an oath of secrecy to the members, which was carried,
and continues to the present time." See Life of Lord Anson, p. 218.--E.

(12) The Hon.  Edward Boscawen, third son of Hugh, first Viscount Falmouth.  He was a distinguished
naval commander, and had a large share in the success of Lord Anson's engagement with the French
fleet off Cape Finisterre in 1747.  He died in 1761.-D.

(13) The Dukes of Bedford and Newcastle.-D.

(14) Eldest son of Lord Barnard, and afterwards first Earl of Darlington.  he died in 1758.-E.

(15) Theodore, King of Corsica.-D.

(16) Their story is briefly this: A Moorish king, who had entertained with great hospitality
a British captain trafficking on the coast of Africa, reposed such confidence in him, as to
intrust him with his son, about eighteen years of age, and another sprightly youth, to be brought
to England and educated in the European manners.  The captain received them, and basely sold
them for slaves.  He shortly after died; and, the ship coming to England, the officers related
the whole affair: upon which the government sent to pay their ransom, and they were brought
to England and put under the care of the Earl of Halifax, then at the head of the board of
trade, who had them clothed and educated in a suitable manner.  They were afterwards received
in the higher circles, and introduced to the King.  On the first of February in this year,
they appeared at the Covent-Garden theatre, to see the tragedy of Oroonok; where they were
received with a loud clap of applause, which they returned with a genteel bow.  The tender
interview between Imoinda and Oroonoko so affected the Prince, that he was obliged to retire
at the end of the fourth act.  His companion remained, but wept all the time so bitterly that
it affected the audience more than the play.-E.

(17) General Oglethorpe was the great promoter of the colony of Georgia. Wall replied, "Mais,
mon Die, l'abb`e, ne scavez vous pas que ce n'est pas un op`era boufon!" And here is another
bon-mot of my Lady Townshend: We were talking of the Methodists: somebody said, "Nay, Madam,
is it true that Whitfield has recanted?" "No, Sir, he has only canted."

I must tell you of Stosch's letter, which he had the impertinence to give you without telling
the contents.  It was to solicit the arrears of his pension, which I beg you will Tell him
I have no manner of interest to procure; and to tell me of a Galla Placidia, a gold medal lately
found.  It is not for myself, but I wish you would ask him the price for a friend of mine who
would like to buy it.  Adieu! my dear child; I have been long in arrears to you, but I trust
you will take this huge letter as an acquittal.  You see my villa makes me a good correspondent;
how happy I should be to show it you, if I could, with no mixture of disagreeable circumstances
to you.  I have made a vast plantation! Lord Leicester told me the other day that he heard
I would not buy some old china, because I was laying out all my money in trees; "Yes," said
I, my Lord, I used to love blue trees, but Now I like green ones."

23 Letter 4 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, May 17, 1749.

We have not yet done diverting ourselves: the night before last the Duke of Richmond gave a
firework; a codicil to the peace. He bought the rockets and wheels that remained in the pavilion
which miscarried, and took the pretence of the Duke of Modena being here to give a charming
entertainment.  The garden(30) lies with a slope down to the Thames, on which were lighters,
from whence were thrown up, after a concert of water-music, a great number of rockets.  Then
from boats on every side were discharged water-rockets and fires of that kind; and then the
wheels Which were ranged along the rails of the terrace were played off; and the whole concluded
with the illumination of a pavilion on the top of the slope, of two pyramids on each side,
and of the whole length of the balustrade to the water.  You can't conceive a prettier sight;
the garden filled with every body of fashion, the Duke, the Duke of Modena, and the two black
Princes.  The King and Princess Emily were in their barge under the terrace; the river was
covered with boats, and the shores and adjacent houses with crowds.  The Duke of Modena played
afterwards at brag, and there was a fine supper for him and the foreigners, of whom there are
numbers here; it is grown as much the fashion to travel hither as to France or Italy. Last
week there was a vast assembly and music at Bedford-house for this Modenese; and to-day he
is set out to receive his doctor's degree at the two Universities.  His appearance is rather
better than it used to be, for, instead of wearing his wig down to his nose to hide the humour
in his face, he has taken to paint his forehead white, which, however, with the large quantity
of red that he always wears on the rest of his face, makes him ridiculous enough.  I cannot
say his manner is more polished; Princess Emily asked him if he did not find the Duke much
fatter than when he was here before? He replied, "En verit`e il n'est pas si effroiable qu'on
m'avoit dit."  She commended his diamonds; he said, "Les v`otres sont bien petits."  As I had
been graciously received at his court, I went into his box the first night at the Opera: the
first thing he did was to fall asleep; but as I did not choose to sit waiting his reveil in
the face of the whole theatre, I waked him, and would discourse him: but here I was very unlucky,
for of the only two persons I could recollect at his court to inquire after, one has been dead
these four years, and the other, he could not remember any such man.  However, Sabbatini, his
secretary of state, flattered me extremely: told me he found me beaucoup mieux, and that I
was grown very fat-I fear, I fear it was flattery! Eight years don't improve one,-and for my
corpulence, if I am grown fat, what must I have been in my Modenese days!

I told you we were to have another jubilee masquerade: there was one by the King's command
for Miss Chudleigh, tire maid of honour, with whom our gracious monarch has a mind to believe
himself in love,--so much in love, that at one of the booths he gave her a fairing for her
watch, which cost him five-and-thirty guineas,--actually disbursed out of his privy purse,
and not charged on the civil list.  Whatever you may think of it, this is a more magnificent
present than the cabinet which the late King of Poland sent to the fair Countess Konismark,
replete with all kinds of baubles and ornaments, and ten thousand ducats in one of the drawers.
I hope some future Hollinshed or Stowe will acquaint posterity "that five-and-thirty guineas
were an immense sum in those days!"

You are going to see one of our court-beauties in Italy, my Lady Rochford:(31) they are setting
Out on their embassy to Turin.  She is large, but very handsome, with great delicacy and address.
All the Royals have been in love with her; but the Duke was so in all the forms, till she was
a little too much pleased with her conquest of his brother-in-law the Prince of Hesse.  You
will not find much in the correspondence of her husband: his person is good, and he will figure
well enough as an ambassador; better as a husband where cicisb`es don't expect to be molested.
The Duke is not likely to be so happy with his new passion, Mrs. Pitt,(32) who, besides being
in love with her husband, whom you remember (,lady Mary Wortley's George Pitt), is going to
Italy with him, I think you will find her one of the most glorious beauties you ever saw. 
You are to have another pair of our beauties, the Princess Borghese's, Mr Greville(33) and
his wife, who was the pretty Fanny M'Cartney.

Now I am talking scandal to you, and court-scandal, I must tell you that Lord Conway's sister,
Miss Jenny, is dead suddenly with eating lemonade at the last subscription masquerade.,(34)
It is not quite unlucky for her: she had outlived the Prince's love and her own face, and nothing
remained but her love and her person, which was exceedingly bad.

The graver part of the world, who have not been given up to rockets and masquing, are amused
with a book of Lord Bolinbroke's, just published, but written long ago.  It is composed of
three letters, the first to Lord Cornbury on the Spirit of Patriotism; and two others to Mr.
lyttelton, (but with neither of their names,) on the Idea of a patriot King, and the State
of Parties on the late King's accession.  Mr. Lyttelton had sent him word, that he begged nothing
might be inscribed to him that was to reflect on Lord Orford, for that he was now leagued with
all Lord Orford's friends: a message as abandoned as the book itself: but indeed there is no
describing the impudence with which that set of people unsay what they have been saying all
their lives,-I beg their pardons, I mean the honesty with which they recant! Pitt told me coolly,
that he had read this book formerly, when he admired Lord Bolinbroke more than he does now.
The book by no means answered my expectation: the style, which is his fort, is very fine: the
deduction and impossibility of drawing a consequence from what he is saying, as bad and obscure
as in his famous Dissertation on Parties: Von must know the man, to guess his meaning.  Not
to mention the absurdity and impracticability of this kind of system, there is a long speculative
dissertation on the origin of government, and even that greatly stolen from other writers,
and that all on a sudden dropped, while he hurries into his own times, and then preaches (he
of all men!) on the duty of preserving decency!  The last treatise would not impose upon an
historian of five years old: he tells Mr. Lyttelton, that he may take it from him, that there
was no settled scheme at the end of the Queen's reign to introduce the Pretender; and he gives
this excellent reason: because, if there had been, he must have known it; and another reason
as ridiculous, that no traces of such a scheme have since come to light.  What, no traces in
all cases of himself, Atterbury, the Duke of Ormond, Sir William Windham, and others! and is
it not known that the moment the queen was expired, Atterbury proposed to go in his lawn sleeves
and proclaim the Pretender at Charing-cross, but Bolinbroke's heart failing him, Atterbury
swore, "There was the best cause in Europe lost for want of spirit!"  He imputes Jacobitism
singly to Lord Oxford, whom he exceedingly abuses; and who, so far from being suspected, was
thought to have fallen into disgrace with that faction for refusing to concur with them.  On
my father he is much less severe than I expected; and in general, so obliquely, that hereafter
he will not be perceived to aim at him, though at this time one knows so much what was at his
heart, that it directs one to his meaning.

But there is a preface to this famous book, which makes much more noise than the work itself.
It seems, Lord Bolinbroke had originally trusted Pope with the copy, to have half-a-dozen printed
for particular friends.  Pope, who loved money infinitely beyond any friend, got fifteen hundred
Copies(35) printed privately, intending to outlive Bolingbroke and make great advantage of
them; and not only did this, but altered the copy at his Pleasure, and even made different
alterations in different copies.  Where Lord Bolingbroke had strongly flattered their common
friend lyttelton, Pope suppressed the panegyric: where, in compliment to Pope, he had softened
the satire on Pope's great friend, Lord Oxford, Pope reinstated the abuse.  The first part
of this transaction is recorded in the preface; the two latter facts are reported by Lord Chesterfield
and Lyttelton, the latter of whom went to Bolingbroke to ask how he had forfeited his good
opinion.  In short, it is comfortable to us people of moderate virtue to hear these demigods,
and patriots, and philosophers, inform the world of each other's villanies.(36) What seems
to make Lord Bolinbroke most angry, and I suppose does, is Pope's having presumed to correct
his work.  As to his printing so many copies, it certainly was a compliment, and the more profit
(which however could not be immense) he expected to make, the greater opinion he must have
conceived of the merit of the work: if one had a mind to defend Pope, should not one ask,(37)
if any body ever blamed Virgil's executors for not burning the AEneid, as he ordered them?
Warburton, I fear, does design to defend Pope: and my uncle Horace to answer the book; his
style, which is the worst in the world, must be curious, in opposition to the other.  But here
comes full as bad a part of the story as any: Lord Bolinbroke, to buy himself out of the abuse
in the Duke of Marlborough's life, or to buy himself into the supervisal of it, gave those
letters to Mallet, who is writing this life for a legacy in the old Duchess's will, (and which,
with much humour, she gave, desiring it might not be written in verse,) and Mallet sold them
to the bookseller for a hundred and fifty pounds.  Mallet had many obligations to Pope, no
disobligations to him, and was one of his grossest flatterers; witness the sonnet on his supposed
death, printed in the notes to the Dunciad.  I was this morning told an anecdote from the Dorset
family that is no bad collateral evidence of the Jacobitism Of the Queen'S four last years.
They wanted to get Dover Castle into their hands, and sent down Prior to the present Duke of
Dorset, who loved him, and probably was his brother,(38) to persuade him to give it up.  He
sent Prior back with great an(-,er, and in three weeks was turned out of the government himself
but it is idle to produce proofs; as idle as to deny the scheme.

I have just been with your brother Gal. who has been laid up these two days with the gout in
his ankle; an absolute professed gout in all the forms, and with much pain.  Mr. Chute is out
of town; when he returns, I shall set him upon your brother to reduce him to abstinence and
health.  Adieu!

(34) This event was commemorated in the following doggrel lines:--

"Poor Jenny Conway She drank lemonade, At a masquerade, So now she's dead and gone away."-D.

(35) Lord Bolingbroke discovered what Pope had done during his lifetime, and never forgave
him for it.  He-obliged him to give up the copies, and they were burned on the terrace of Lord
Bolingbroke's house at Battersea, in the presence of Lord B. and Pope.-D.

(36) In reference to this publication, Lord Bolingbroke himself, in a letter to Lord Marchmont,
written on the 7th of June, says, "The book you mention has brought no trouble upon me, though
it has given occasion to many libels upon me.  They are of the lowest form, and seem to be
held in the contempt they deserve.  There I shall leave them, nor suffer a nest of hornets
to disturb the quiet of my retreat.  If these letters of mine come to your hands, your lordship
will find that I have left out all that was said of our friend Lord Lyttelton in one of them.
He desired that it might be so; and I had at once the double mortification of concealing the
good I had said of one friend, and of revealing the turpitude of another.  I hope you will
never have the same treatment that I have met with; neither will you.  I am single in my circumstances--a
species apart in the political society; and they, who dare to attack no one else, may attack
me.  Chesterfield says, I have made a coalition of Wig, Tory, Trimmer, and Jacobite against
myself. Be it so.  I have Truth, that is stronger than all of them, on my side; and, in her
company, and avowed by her, I have more satisfaction than their applause and their favour could
give me." Marchmont Papers.-E.

(37) This thought was borrowed by Mr. Spence, in a pamphlet published on this occasion in defence
of Pope.

(38) Burnet relates that the Earl of Dorset, celebrated for patronage of Genius, found Prior
by chance reading Horace, and was so well pleased with his proficiency, that he undertook the
care and cost of academical education.

27 Letter 5 To George Montagu, Esq. Arlington Street, May 18, 1749,.

Dear George, Whatever you hear of the Richmond fireworks, that is short of the prettiest entertainment
in the world, don't believe it - I really never passed a more agreeable evening.  Every thing
succeeded; all the wheels played in time; Frederick was fortunate, and all the world in good
humour.  Then for royalty--Mr. Anstis himself would have been glutted; there were all the Fitzes
upon earth, the whole court of St. Germains, the Duke,(39) the Duke of Modena, and two Anamaboes.
The King, and Princess Emily bestowed themselves upon the mob on the river and as soon as they
were gone, the Duke had the music into the garden, and himself, with my Lady Lincoln, Mrs.
Pitt, Peggy Banks, and Lord Holderness, entertained the good subjects with singing God save
the King to them over the rails of the terrace.  The Duke of Modena supped there, and the Duke
was asked, but he answered, it was impossible; in short, he could not adjust his dignity to
a mortal banquet.  There was an admirable scene: Lady Burlington brought the Violette, and
the Richmonds had asked Garrick who stood ogling and sighing the whole time, while my Lady
kept a most fierce look-out. Sabbatini, one of the Duke of Modena's court, was asking me who
all the people were? and who is that? "C'est miladi Hartington, la belle fille du Duc de Devonshire."
"Et qui est cette autre dame!" It was a distressing question; after a little hesitation, I
replied, "Mais c'est Mademoiselle Violette?" "Et comment Mademoiselle Violette! j'ai connu
une Mademoiselle Violette, par exemple."(40)  I begged him to look at Miss Bishop.

In the middle of all these principalities and powers was the Duchess of Queensbury, in her
forlorn trim, a white apron and a white hood, and would make the Duke swallow all her undress.
T'other day she drove post to Lady Sophia Thomas, at Parsons-green, and told her that she was
come to tell her something of importance. " What is it!"  "Why take a couple of beef-steaks,
clap them together as if they were for a dumpling, and eat them with pepper and salt; it is
the best thing you ever tasted: I could not help coming to tell you this:" and away she drove
back to town.  Don't a course of folly for forty years make one very sick?

The weather is SO hot, and the roads so dusty, that I can't get to Strawberry; but I shall
begin negotiating with you now about your coming.  You must not expect to find it in beauty.
I hope to get my bill finished in ten days; I have scrambled it through the lords; but altogether,
with the many difficulties and plagues, I am a good deal out of humour; my purchases hitch,
and new proprietors start out of the ground, like the crop of soldiers in the Metamorphosis.
I expect but an unpleasant summer; my indolence and inattention are not made to wade through
leases and deeds.  Mrs. Chenevix brought me one yesterday to sign, and her sister Bertrand,
the toy-woman of Bath, for a witness.  I showed them my cabinet of enamels instead of treating
them with white wine.  The Bertrand said, "Sir, I hope you don't trust all sorts of ladies
with this cabinet!"  What an entertaining assumption of dignity!  I must tell you an anecdote
that I found t'other day in an old French author, which is a great drawback on beaux sentiments
and romantic ideas.  Pasquier, in his "Recherches de la France," is giving an account of the
Queen of Scots' execution; he says, the night before, knowing her body must be stripped for
her shroud, she would have her feet washed, because she used ointment to one of them which
was sore.  I believe I have told you, that in a very old trial of her, which I bought from
Lord Oxford's collection, it is said that she was a large lame woman.  Take sentiments out
of their pantoufles, and reduce them to the infirmities of mortality, what a falling off there
is! I could not help laughing in myself t'other day, as I went through Holborn in a very hot
day, at the dignity of human nature; all those foul old-clothes women panting without handkerchiefs,
and mopping themselves all the way down within their loose jumps.  Rigby gave me a strong picture
of human nature; he and Peter Bathurst t'other night carried a servant of the latter's, who
had attempted to shoot him, before Fielding; who, to all his other vocations, has, by the grace
of Mr. Lyttelton, added that of Middlesex justice.  He sent them word he was at supper, that
they must come next morning.  They did not understand that freedom, and ran up, where they
found him banqueting with a blind man,(41) a whore, and three on some cold mutton and a bone
of ham, both in One dish, and the dirtiest cloth.  He never stirred nor asked them to sit.
The latter has declared his future match with Miss Rich.  George Grenville has been married
these two days to Miss Windham.  Your friend Lord North is, I suppose you know, on the brink
with the countess of Rockingham;(45) and I think your cousin Rice is much inclined to double
the family alliance with her sister Furnese.  It went on very currently for two or three days,
but last night at Vauxhall his minionette face seemed to be sent to languish with Lord R. Berties's.

Was not you sorry for poor Cucumber?  I do assure you I was; it was shocking to be hurried
away so suddenly, and in so much torment.  You have heard I suppose of Lord Harry Beauclerc's
resignation, on his not being able to obtain a respite till November, though the lowest officer
in his regiment has got much longer leave.  It is incredible how Nolkejumskoi has persecuted
this poor man for these four years, since he could not be persuaded to alter his vote at a
court-martial for the acquittal of a man whom the Duke would have condemned.  Lord Ossulston,
too, has resigned his commission.

I must tell you a good story of Charles Townshend: you know his political propensity and importance;
his brother George was at supper at the King's Arms with some more young men.  The conversation
somehow or other rambled into politics, and it was started that the national debt was a benefit.
"I am sure it is not," said Mr. Townshend; I can't tell why, but my brother Charles can, and
I will send to him for arguments."  Charles was at supper at another tavern, but so much the
dupe of this message, that he literally called for ink and paper, wrote four long sides of
arguments, and sent word that when his company broke up, he would come and give them more,
which he did at one o'clock in the morning.  I don't think you will laugh much less at what
happened to me: I wanted a print out of a booth, which I did not care to buy at Osborn's shop:
the next day he sent me the print, and begged that when I had any thing to publish, I would
employ him.

I will now tell you, and finish this long letter, how I shocked Mr. Mackenzie inadvertently
at Vauxhall: we had supped there a great party, and coming out, Mrs. More, who waits at the
gate, said, "Gentlemen and ladies, you will walk in and hear the surprising alteration of voice?"
I forgetting Mackenzie's connexions, and that he was formerly of the band, replied, "No, I
have seen patriots enough."

I intend this letter shall last you till you come to Strawberry Hill.  one might have rolled
it out into half-a-dozen.  My best compliments to your sisters.

(39) The Duke of Cumberland.  Of his translation of Pindar, Dr. Johnson states, that he found
his expectations surpassed, both by its elegance and its exactness.  For his "Observations
on the Resurrection," the University of Oxford, in March 1748, created him a Doctor of Laws
by diploma.  At his residence at Wickham, where he was often visited by Lyttelton and Pitt,
there is a walk designed by the latter; while the former received at this place that conviction
which produced his "Dissertation on St. Paul."-E.

30 Letter 6 To Sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, June 4, 1749.

As summery as June and Strawberry Hill may sound, I assure you I am writing to you by the fire-side:
English weather will give vent to its temper, and whenever it is out of humour it will blow
east and north and all kinds of cold.  Your brothers Ned and Gal. dined with me to-day, and
I carried the latter back to Richmond: as I passed over the green, I saw Lord Bath, Lord Lonsdale,(46)
and half-a-dozen more of the White's club sauntering at the door of a house which they have
taken there, and come to every Saturday and Sunday to play at whist.  You will naturally ask
why they can't play at whist in London on those two days as well as on the other five; indeed
I can't tell you, except that it is so established a fashion to go out of town at the end of
the week, that people do go, though it be only into another town.  It made me smile to see
Lord Bath sitting there, like a citizen that has left off trade.

Your brother Ned has not seen Strawberry Hill since my great improvements; he was astonished:
it is pretty: you never saw so tranquil a scene, without the least air of melancholy: I should
hate it, if it was dashed with that.  I forgot to ask Gal. what is become of the books of Houghton
which I gave him six months ago for you and Dr. Cocchi.  You perceive I have got your letter
of May 23rd, and with it Prince Craon's simple epistle to his daughter:(47) I have no mind
to deliver it: it would be a proper recommendation of a staring boy on his travels, and is
consequently very suitable to my colleague, Master St. Leger; but one hates to be coupled with
a romping grayhound puppy, "qui est moins prudent que Monsieur Valpol!" I did not want to be
introduced to Madame de Mirepoix's assemblies, but to be acquainted with her, as I like her
family: I concluded, simple as he is, that an old Frenchman knew how to make these distinctions.
By thrusting St. Leger into the letter with me, and talking of my prudence, I shall not wonder
if she takes me for his bear-leader, his travelling governor!

Mr. Chute, who went from hence this morning, and is always thinking of blazoning your pedigree(48)
in the noblest colours, has turned over all my library, till he has tapped a new and very great
family for you: in short, by your mother it is very clear that you are descended from Hubert
de Burgh, Grand Justiciary to Richard the Second: indeed I think he was hanged; but that is
a misfortune that ill attend very illustrious genealogies; it is as common to them as to the
pedigrees about Paddington and Blacieheath.  I have had at least a dozen great-great-grandfathers
that came to untimely ends.  All your virtuosos in heraldry are content to know that they had
ancestors who lived five hundred years ago, no matter how they died.  A match with a low woman
corrupts a stream of blood as long as the Danube, tyranny, villainy, and executions are mere
fleabites, and leave no stain.  The good Lord of Bath, whom I saw on Richmond-green this evening,
did intend, I believe, to ennoble my genealogy with another execution: how low is he sunk now
from those views! and how entertaining to have lived to see all those virtuous patriots proclaiming
their mutual iniquities! Your friend Mr. Doddington, it seems, is so reduced as to be relapsing
into virtue.  In my last I told you some curious anecdotes of another part of the band, of
Pope and Bolingbroke.  The friends of the former have published twenty pamphlets against the
latter; I say against the latter, for, as there is no defending Pope, they are reduced to satirize
Bolingbroke.  One of them tells him how little he would be known himself from his own writings,
if he were not immortalized in Pope's; and still more justly, that if be destroys Pope's moral
character, what will become of his own, which has been retrieved and sanctified by the embalming
art of his friend? However, there are still new discoveries made every day of Pope's dirty
selfishness.  Not content with the great profits which he proposed to make of the work in question,
he could not bear that the interest of his money should be lost till Bolingbroke's death; and
therefore told him that it would cost very near as much to have the press set for half-a-dozen
copies as it would for a complete edition, and by this means made Lord Bolingbroke pay very
near the whole expense of the fifteen hundred.  Another story I have been told on this occasion,
was of a gentleman who, making a visit to Bishop Atterbury in France, thought to make his court
by commending Pope.  The Bishop replied not: the gentleman doubled the dose - at last the Bishop
shook his head, and said, "Mens curva in corpore curvo!"  The world will now think justly of
these men: that Pope was the greatest poet, but not the most disinterested man in the world;
and that Bolingbroke had not all those virtues and not all those talents which the other so
proclaimed; and that be did not even deserve the friendship which lent him so much merit; and
for the mere loan of which he dissembled attachment to Pope, to whom in his heart he was as
perfidious and as false as he has been to the rest of the world.

The Duke of Devonshire has at last resigned, for the unaccountable and unenvied pleasure of
shutting himself up at Chatsworth with his ugly mad Duchess;(49) the more extraordinary sacrifice,
as he turned her head, rather than give up a favourite match for his son.  She has consented
to live with him there, and has even been with him in town for a few days, but did not see
either her son or Lady Harrington. On his resignation he asked and obtained an English barony
for Lord Besborough, whose son Lord Duncannon, you know, married the Duke's eldest daughter.
I believe this is a great disappointment to my uncle, who hoped he would ask the peerage for
him or Pigwiggin.  The Duke of Marlborough succeeds as lord steward.  Adieu!

(46)  Henry Lowther, third Viscount Lonsdale, of the first creation.  He was the second son
of John, the first Viscount, and succeeded his elder brother Richard in the title in 1713.
He was a lord of the bedchamber, and at one period of his life was privy seal.-D.

(47) Madame de Mirepoix, French ambassadress in England, to whom her father, Prince Craon,
had written a letter of introduction for Horace Walpole.- D.

(48) Count Richcourt, and some Florentines, his creatures, had been very impertinent about
Mr. Mann's family, which was very good, and which made it necessary to have his pedigree drawn
out, and sent over to Florence.

(49) Coxe, in his Memoirs of Lord Walpole, vol ii. p. 264, says that the Duke of Devonshire
resigned, because be was disgusted with the feuds in the cabinet, and perplexed with the jealous
disposition of Newcastle and the desponding spirit of Pelham. He adds, " that the Duke was
a man of sound judgment and unbiased integrity, and that Sir Robert Walpole used to declare,
that, on a subject which required mature deliberation, he would prefer his sentiments to those
of any other person in the kingdom."-E.

32 Letter 7 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, June 25, 1749.

Don't flatter yourself with your approaching year of jubilee; its pomps and vanities will be
nothing to the shows and triumphs we have had, and are having.  I talk like an Englishman:
here you know we imagine that a jubilee is a season of pageants, not of devotion but our Sabbath
has really been all tilt and tournament.  There have been, I think, no less than eight masquerades,
the fire-works, and a public act at Oxford: to-morrow is an installation of six Knights of
the Bath, and in August of as many Garters: Saturday, Sunday, and Monday next, are the banquets(50)
at Cambridge, for the instalment of the Duke of Newcastle as chancellor.  The whole world goes
to it: he has invited, summoned, pressed the entire body of nobility and gentry from all parts
of England.  His cooks have been there these ten days, distilling essences of every living
creature, and massacring and confounding all the species that Noah and Moses took such pains
to preserve and distinguish.  It would be pleasant to see the pedants and professors searching
for etymologies of strange dishes, and tracing more wonderful transformations than any in the
Metamorphoses.  How miserably Horace's unde et quo Catius will be hacked about in clumsy quotations!
I have seen some that will be very unwilling performers at the creation of this ridiculous
MaMaMOUChi.(51)  I have set my heart on their giving a doctor's degree to the Duchess of Newcastle's
favourite--this favourite is at present neither a lover nor an apothecary, but a common pig,
that she brought from Hanover: I am serious; and Harry Vane, the new lord of the treasury,
is entirely employed, when he is not -,it the Board, in opening and shutting the door for it.
Tell me, don't you very often throw away my letters in a passion, and believe that I invent
the absurdities I relate! Were not we as mad when you was in England?

The King, who has never dined out of his own palaces, has just determined to dine at Claremont
to-morrow--all the cooks are at Cambridge; imagine the distress!

Last Thursday, the Monarch of my last paragraph gave away the six vacant ribands; one to a
Margrave of Anspach, a near relation of the late Queen; others to the Dukes of leeds(52) and
Bedford, lords Albemarle and Granville: the last, you may imagine gives some uneasiness.  The
Duke of Bedford has always been unwilling to take one, having tied himself up in the days of
his patriotism to forfeit great sums if ever he did.  The King told him one day this winter,
that he would give none away but to him and to Anspach.  This distinction struck him: he could
not refuse the honour; but he has endeavoured to waive it, as one imagines, by a scruple he
raised against the oath, which obliges the knights, whenever they are within two miles of Windsor,
to go and offer.  The King would not abolish the oath, but has given a general dispensation
for all breaches of it, past, present, and to come.  Lord Lincoln and Lord Harrington are very
unhappy at not being in the list.  The sixth riband is at last given to Prince George; the
ministry could not prevail for it till within half an hour of the ceremony; then the Bishop
of Salisbury was sent to notify the gracious intention.  The Prince was at Kew, so the message
was delivered to Prince George(53) himself.  The child, with great good sense, desired the
Bishop to give his duty and thanks, and to assure the King that he should always obey him;
but that, as his father was out of town, he could send no other answer.  Was not it clever?
The design of not giving one riband to the Prince's children had made great noise; there was
a Remembrancer(54) on that subject ready for the press.  This is the Craftsman of the present
age, and is generally levelled at the Duke,(55) and filled with very circumstantial cases of
his arbitrary behaviour.  It has absolutely written down Hawly, his favourite general and executioner,
who was to have been upon the staff.

Garrick is married to the famous Violette, first at a Protestant, and then at a Roman Catholic
chapel.  The chapter of this history is a little obscure and uncertain as to the consent of
the protecting Countess,(56) and whether she gives her a fortune or not.

Adieu! I believe I tell you strange rhapsodies; but you must consider that our follies are
not only very extraordinary, but are our business and employment; they enter into our politics,
nay, I think They are our politics(57)--and I don't know which are the simplest.  they are
Tully's description of poetry, "haec studia juventutem alunt, senectutem oblectant; pernoctant
nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur:" so if you will that I write to you, you must be content
with a detail of absurdities. I could tell you of Lord Mountford's(58) making cricket-matches,
and fetching up parsons by express from different parts of England to play matches on Richmond-green;
of his keeping aide-de-camps to ride to all parts to lay bets for him at horse-races, and of
twenty other peculiarities; but I fancy you are tired: in short, you, who know me, will comprehend
all best when I tell you that I live in such a scene of folly as makes me even think myself
a creature of common sense.

(50) Gray, in giving an account of the installation to his friend Wharton, says, "Every one,
while it lasted, was very gay and very busy in the morning, and very owlish and very tipsy
at night.  I make no exceptions, from the Chancellor to Blewcoat. Mason's Ode was the only
entertainment that had any tolerable elegance, and for my own part, I think it (with some little
abatements) uncommonly well on such an occasion.  Works, vol. iii. p. 67.-E.

and then at the playhouse; and in such favour at Burlington-house, that the tickets for her
benefits were designed by Kent, and engraved by Vertue. [In the Gentleman's Magazine, the lady
is stated to have brought Garrick a fortune of ten thousand pounds.)

(57) This was frequently the case while the Duke of Newcastle and Mr.-Pelham were ministers;
it was true, that in the case of the Violette just mentioned, one night that she had advertised
three dances and danced but two, Lord Bury and some young men of fashion began a riot, and
would have had her sent from Burlington-House.  It being feared that she would be hissed on
her next appearance, and Lord Hartington, the cherished of Mr. Pelham, being son-in-law of
Lady Burlington, the ministry were in great agitation to secure a good reception for the Violette
from the audience, and the Duke was even desired to order Lord Bury (one of his lords) not to hiss.

35 Letter 8 To George Montagu, Esq. Mistley, July 5, 1749.

Dear George, I have this moment received your letter, and it makes me very unhappy,.  You will
think me a brute for not having immediately told you how glad I should be to see you and your
sisters; but I trust that you will have seen Mrs. Boscawen, by whom I sent you a message to
invite you to Strawberry Hill, when we should be returned from Roel and Mistley.  I own my
message had rather a cross air; but as you have retrieved all your crimes with me by your letter,
I have nothing to do but to make myself as well with you as you are with me. Indeed I am extremely
unlucky, but I flatter myself that Messrs. Montagus will not drop their kind intention, as
it is not in my power to receive it now: they will give me infinite pleasure by a visit.  I
stay there till Monday se'nnight; will that be too late to see you before your journey to Roel?
You must all promise, at least, to be engaged to me at my return.  If the least impediment
happens afterwards, I shall conclude my brother has got you from me; you know jealousy is the
mark of my family.

Mr. Rigby makes you a thousand compliments, and wishes you would ever think his Roel worth
your seeing: you cannot imagine how he has improved it! You have always heard me extravagant
in the praises of the situation. he has demolished all his paternal intrenchments of walls
and square gardens, opened lawns, swelled out a bow-window, erected a portico, planted groves,
stifled ponds, and flounce himself with flowering shrubs and Kent fences.  You may imagine
that I have a little hand in all this.  Since I came hither, I have projected a colonnade to
join his mansion to the offices, have been the death of a tree that intercepted the view of
the bridge, for which, too, I have drawn a white rail, and shall be absolute travelling Jupiter
at Baucis and Philemon's; for I have persuaded him to transform a cottage into a church, by
exalting a spire upon the end of it, as Talbot has done.  By the way, I have dined at the Vineyard.(59)
I dare not trust you with what I think, but I was a little disappointed.  To-morrow we go to
the ruins of the Abbey of St. Osyth; it is the seat of the Rochfords, but I never chose to
go there while they were there. You will probably hear from Mr. Lyttelton (if in any pause
of love he rests) that I am going to be first minister to the Prince: in short, I have occasioned
great speculation, and diverted myself with the important mysteries that have been alembicked
out of a trifle.  In short, he had seen my AEdes Walpolianae at Sir Luke Schaub's, and sent
by him to desire one.  I sent him one bound quite in coronation robes, and went last Sunday
to thank him for the honour.  There were all the new knights of the garter.  After the prince
had whispered through every curl of lord Granville's periwig, he turned to me, and said such
a crowd of civil things that I did not know what to answer; commended the style and the quotations;
said I had sent him back to his Livy; in short, that there were but two things he disliked--one,
that I had not given it to him of my own accord, and the other, that I had abused his friend
Andrea del Sarto; and that he insisted, when I came to town again, I should come and see two
very fine ones that he has lately bought of that master.  This drew on a very long conversation
on painting, every word of which I suppose will be reported at the other court as a plan of
opposition for the winter.  Prince George was not there: when he went to receive the riband,
the Prince carried him to the closet door, where the Duke of Dorset received and carried him.
Ayscough,(60) or Nugent. or some of the geniuses, had taught him a speech; the child began
it', the Prince cried "No, no!"  When the boy had a little recovered his fright, he began again;
but the same tremendous sounds were repeated, and the oration still-born.

I believe that soon I shall have a pleasanter tale to tell you; it is said my Lady Anson, not
content with the profusion of the absurdities she utters, (by the way, one of her sayings,
and extremely in the style of Mr. Lyttelton's making love, was, as she sat down to play at
brag at the corner of a square table: Lady Fitzwalter said she was sorry she had not better
room; "O! Madam," said my Lady Anson, "I can sit like a nightingale, with my breast against
a thorn;") in short, that, not content with so much wit, she proposes to entertain the town
to the tune of Doctors' Commons.  She does not mince her disappointments: here is an epigram
that has been made on the subject:-

"As Anson his voyage to my lady was reading, And recounting his dangers--thank God she's not
breeding! He came to the passage, where, like the old Roman, He stoutly withstood the temptation
of woman; The Baroness smiled; when continuing, he said, "Think what terror must there fill
the poor lover's head." "Alack!" quoth my lady, "he had nothing to fear, Were that Scipio as
harmless as you are, my dear."

(59) Mr. Chute's.

(60) Francis Ayscough, Dean of Bristol, tutor to Prince George.-E.

36 Letter 9 To George Montagu, Esq. Strawberry Hill, July 20th, 1749.

I am returned to my Strawberry, and find it in such beauty, that I shall be impatient till
I see you and your sisters here. They must excuse me if I don't marry for their reception;
for it is said the Drax's have impeached fifteen more damsels, and till all the juries of matrons
have finished their inquest, one shall not care to make one's choice: I was going to say, "throw
one's handkerchief," but at present that term would be a little equivocal.

As I came to town I was extremely entertained with some excursions I made out of the road in
search of antiquities.  At Layer Marney is a noble old remnant of the palace of the Lords of
Marney, with three very good tombs in the church well preserved.  At Messing I saw an extreme
fine window of painted glass in the church; it is the duties prescribed in the Gospel of visiting
the sick  and prisoners, etc.  I mistook, and called it the seven deadly sins.  There is a
very old tomb of Sir Robert Messing, that built the church.  The hall-place is a fragment of
an old house belonging to Lord  Grimston;(61)  Lady Luckyn his mother, of fourscore and six,
lives in it with an old son and daughter.  The servant who showed it told us much history of
another brother that had been parson there: this history was entirely composed of the anecdotes
of the doctor's drinking. who, as the man told us, had been a blood.  There are some Scotch
arms taken from the rebels in the '15, and many old coats of arms on glass brought from Newhall,
which now belongs to Olmius.  Mr. Conyers bought a window(62) there for only a hundred pounds,
on which is painted Harry the Eighth and one of his queens at full length: he has put it up
at Copt-hall, a seat which he has bought that belonged to Lord North and Grey. You see I persevere
in my heraldry.  T'other day the parson of Rigby's parish dined with us; he has conceived as
high an opinion of my skill in genealogies, as if I could say the first chapter of Matthew
by heart.  Rigby drank my health to him, and that I might come to be garter king at arms: the
poor man replied with great zeal, "I wish he may with all my heart." Certainly, I am born to
preferment; I gave an old woman a penny once, who prayed that I might live to be lord mayor
of London! What pleased me most in my travels was Dr. Sayer's parsonage at Witham, which, with
Southcote's help, whose old Roman Catholic father lives just by him, he has made one of the
most charming villas in England.  There are sweet meadows falling down a hill, and rising again
on t'other side of the pretiest little winding stream you ever saw.  You did not at all surprise
me with the relation of the keeper's brutality to your family, or of his master's to the dowager's
handmaid.  His savage temper increases every day.  George Boscawen is in a scrape with him
by a court-martial, of which he is one; it was appointed on a young poor soldier, who to see
his friends had counterfeited a furlough only for a day.  They ordered him two hundred lashes;
but Molkejunskoi, who loves blood like a leech, insisted it was not enough-has made them sit
three times (though every one adheres to the first sentence,) and swears they shall sit these
six months till they increase the punishment.  The fair Mrs. Pitt has been mobbed in the Park,
and with difficulty rescued by some gentlemen, only because this bashaw is in love with her.
You heard, I suppose, of his other amour with the Savoyard girl.  He sent her to Windsor and
offered her a hundred pounds, which she refused because he was a heretic; he sent her back
on foot.  Inclosed is a new print on this subject, which I think has more humour than I almost
ever saw in one of that sort.

Should I not condole with you upon the death of the head of the Cues?(63)  If' you have not
heard his will, I will tell you. The settled estate of eight thousand a year is to go between
the two daughters, out of which is a jointure of three thousand a year to the Duchess-dowager,
and to that he has added a thousand more out of the unsettled estate, which is nine thousand.
He gives, together with his blessing, four thousand per annum rent-charge to the Duchess of
Manchester in present, provided she will contest nothing with her sister, who is to have all
the rest, and the reversion of the whole after Lady Cardigan and her children; but in case
she disputes, Lady Hinchinbrooke and hers are in the entail next to the Cardigans, who are
to take the Montagu name and livery.  I don't know what Mr. Hussey will think of the blessing,
but they say his Duchess will be inclined to mind it; she always wanted to be well with her
father, but hated her mother.  There are two codicils, one in favour of his servants, and the
other of' his dogs, cats, and creatures; which was a little unnecessary, for lady Cardigan
has exactly his turn for saving every thing's life. As he was making the codicil, One of his
cats jumped on his knee; "What," says he, "have you a mind to be a witness too! You can't,
for you are a party concerned." Lord Stafford is going to send his poor wife with one maid
and one horse to a farm-house in Shropshire for ever.  The Mirepoix's are come; but I have
not yet seen them.  A thousand compliments to your sisters.

(61) Sir Samuel Grimston, Bart. left an heiress, who married Sir Capel Luckyn, bart.  Their
son changed his name to Grimston, and was created a baron and a Viscount.

(62) This window is now in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster.

38 letter 10 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, July 24, 1749.

You and Dr. Cocchi have made me ashamed with the civilities you showed to my book-I hope it
blushed!

You have seen the death of the Duke of Montagu(64) in all the
papers.  His loss will be extremely felt! he paid no less than
2700 pounds a year in private pensions, which ought to be
known, to balance the immense history of his places; of which
he was perpetually obtaining new, and making the utmost of all:
he had quartered on the great wardrobe no less than thirty
nominal tailors and arras-workers. - This employment is to be
dropped; his others are not yet given away.  My father had a
great opinion of his understanding, and at the beginning of the
 war was most desirous of persuading him to be Generalissimo;
but the Duke was very diffident of himself, and, having seen
little service, would not accept it, In short, with some foibles,
he was a most amiable man, and one of the most feeling I ever
knew.  His estate is 17,000 pounds a year; the Duchess of
Manchester must have four of it; all the rest he has given,
after four thousand a year to the Duchess-dowager shall fall
in, to his other daughter Lady Cardigan.  Lord Vere
Beauclerc(65) has thrown his into the list of vacant
employments: he resigned his lordship of the admiralty on
Anson's being preferred to him for vice-admiral of England; but
what heightened the disgust, was Lord Vere's going to a party
to visit the docks with Sandwich and Anson, after this was
done, and yet they never mentioned it to him.  It was not
possible to converse with them upon good terms every day
afterwards.  You perceive our powers and places are in a very
fluctuating situation: the Prince will have a catalogue of
discontented ready to fill the whole civil list.  My Lord
Chancellor was terrified the other day with a vision of such a
revolution; he saw Lord Bath kiss hands, and had like to have
dropped the seals with the agony of not knowing what it was
for--it was only for his going to Spa.  However, as this is an
event which the Chancellor has never thought an impossible one,
he is daily making Christian preparation against it.  He has
just married his other daughter to Sir John Heathcote's
son;(66) a Prince little inferior to Pigwiggin in person; and
procreated in a greater bed of money and avarice than Pigwiggin
himself: they say, there is a peerage already promised to him
by the title of Lord Normanton.  The King has consented to give
two earldoms to replace the great families of Somerset and
Northumberland in their descendants; Lady Betty Smithson is to
have the latter title after the Duke of Somerset's death, and
Sir Charles Windham any other appellation he shall choose.  You
know Lord Granville had got a grant of Northumberland for him,
but it was stopped.  These two hang a little, by the Duke of
Somerset's wanting to have the earldom for his son-in-law,(67)
instead of his daughter.(68)

You ask me about the principles of the Methodists: I have tried to learn them, and have read
one of their books.  The visible part seems to be nothing but stricter practice than that of
our church, clothed in the old exploded cant of mystical devotion. For example, you take a
metaphor; we will say our passions are weeds; you immediately drop every description of the
passions, and adopt every thing peculiar to weeds: in five minutes a true Methodist will talk
with the greatest compunction of hoeing--this catches women of fashion and shopkeepers.

I have now a request to make to you: Mrs. Gibberne is extremely desirous of having her son
come to England for a short time. There is a small estate left to the family, I think by the
uncle; his presence is absolutely necessary: however, the poor woman is so happy in his situation
with you, that she talks Of giving up every thing rather than disoblige you by fetching him
to England.  She has been so unfortunate as to lose a favourite daughter ' that was just married
greatly to a Lisbon merchant: the girl was so divided in her affections, that she had a mind
not to have followed her husband to Portugal.  Mrs. Leneve, to comfort the poor woman, told
her what a distress this would have been either way: she was so struck with this position,
that she said, "Dear Madam, it is very lucky she died!"--and since that, she has never cried,
but for joy! Though it is impossible not to smile at these awkward sensations of unrefined
nature, yet I am sure your good nature will agree with me in giving the poor creature this
satisfaction; and therefore I beg it.  Adieu!

40 Letter 11 To Sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, Aug. 17, 1749.

I hear of nothing but your obliging civilities to the Barrets:(69) I don't wonder you are attentive
to please; my amazement is, when I find it well distributed: you have all your life been making
Florence agreeable to every body that came there, who have almost all forgot it--or worse.
But Mr. and Mrs. Barret do you justice, and as they are very sensible and agreeable, I am persuaded
you will always find that they know how to esteem such goodness as yours.  Mr. Chute has, this
morning received here a letter from Mr. ]Barret, and will answer it very soon.  Mr. Montagu
is here too, and happy to hear he is so -well, and recommends several compliments to your conveyance.

Your brother mentions your being prevented writing to me, by the toothache: I hate you should
have any pain.

You always let us draw upon you for such weight of civilities to any body we recommend, that
if I did not desire to show my attention, and the regard I have for Count LorenZi,(70) yet
it would be burning ingratitude not to repay you.  I have accordingly been trying to be very
civil to the Chevalier; I did see him Once at Florence.  To-morrow I am to fetch him hither
to dinner, from Putney, where the Mirepoix's have got a house.  I gave Madame her father's
simple\ letter, of which she took no more notice than it deserved; but Prince Beauvau(71) has
written her a very particular one about me, and is to come over himself in the winter to make
me a visit: this has warmed their politesse.  I should have known the Ambassadress any where
by the likeness to her family.  He is cold and stately, and not much tasted here.  She is very
sensible; but neither of them satisfy me in one point; I wanted to see something that was the
quintessence of the newest bon ton, that had the last bel air, and spoke the freshest jargon.
These people have scarce ever lived at Paris, are reasonable, and little amusing with follies.
They have brought a cousin of' his, a Monsieur de Levi, who has a tantino of what I wanted
to see.  You know they pique themselves much upon their Jewish name, and call cousins with
the Virgin Mary.  They have a picture in the family, where she is made to say to the founder
of the house, "Couvrez vous, Mon cousin."  He replies, "Non pas, ma tr`es sainte cousine, je
scai trop bien le respect que je vous dois."(72)

There is nothing like news: Kensington Palace was like to have made an article the other night;
it was on fire: my Lady Yarmouth has an ague, and is forced to keep a constant fire in her
room against the damps.  When my Lady Suffolk lived in that apartment, the floor produced a
constant crop of mushrooms. Though there are so many vacant chambers, the King hoards all he
can, and has locked up half the palace since the queen's death: so he does at St. James's,
and I believe would put the rooms out on interest, if he could get a closet a year for them!
Somebody told my Lady Yarmouth they wondered she could live in that unwholesome apartment,
when there are so many other rooms: she replied, "Mais pas pour moy."

The scagliola tables are arrived, and only one has suffered a little on the edge: the pattern
is perfectly pretty.  It would oblige me much if you could make the Friar make a couple more
for me, and with a little more expedition.

Don't be so humble about your pedigree: there is not a pipe of good blood in the kingdom but
we will tap for you: Mr. Chute has it now in painting; and you may depend on having it with
the most satisfactory proofs, as soon as it can possibly be finished.  He has taken great pains,
and fathomed half the genealogies in England for you.

You have been extremely misinformed about my father's writing his own history: I often pressed
it, but he never once threw a thought that way.  He neither loved reading nor writing; and
at last, the only time he had leisure, was not well enough.  He used to say, "that but few
men should ever be ministers, for it let them see too much of the badness of mankind."  Your
story, I imagine, was inoculated on this speech.  Adieu!

42 Letter 12 To George Montagu, Esq. Strawberry Hill, August 26, 1749.

Dear George, I flatter myself that you are quite recovered of your disorder, and that your
sisters will not look with an evil eye on Strawberry Hill.  Mr. Chute and I are returned from
our expedition miraculously well, considering all our distresses. If you love good roads, conveniences,
good inns, plenty of postilions and horses, be so kind as never to go into Sussex. We thought
ourselves in the northest part of England; the whole country has a Saxon air, and the inhabitants
are savage, as if King George the Second had been the first monarch of the East Angles.  Coaches
grow there no more than balm and spices; we were forced to drop our postchaise, that resembled
nothing so much as harlequin's calash, which was occasionally a chaise or a baker's cart. 
We journeyed over Alpine mountains, drenched in clouds, and thought of harlequin again, when
he was driving the chariot of the sun through the morning clouds, and so was glad to hear the
aqua vitae man crying a dram.  At last we got to Arundel Castle, which was visibly built for
defence in an impracticable country.  It is now only a heap of ruins, with a new indifferent
apartment clapt up for the Norfolks, when they reside there for a week or a fortnight.  Their
priest showed us about.  There are the walls of a round tower where the garrison held out against
Cromwell; he planted a battery on the top of the church, and reduced them.  There is a gloomy
gateway and dunccons, in one of which I conclude is kept the old woman who, in the time of
the late rebellion, offered to show Lord Robert Sutton(73) where arms were hidden at Worksop.(74)
The Duchess complimented him into dining before his search, and in the mean time the woman
was spirited away, and adieu the arms.  There are fine monuments of the old Fitzalans, Earls
of Arundel, in the church.  Mr. Chute, whom I have created Strawberry king at arms, has had
brave sport a la chasse aux armes.

We are charmed with the magnificence of the park at Petworth,(75) which is Percy to the backbone;
but the house and garden did not please our antiquarian spirit.  The house is entirely new-fronted
in the style of the Tu'lleries, and furnished exactly like Hampton Court.  There is one room
gloriously flounced all round whole-length pictures, with much the finest carving of Gibbins
that ever my eyes beheld.  There are birds absolutely feathered; and two antique vases with
bas relieves, as perfect and beautiful as if they were carved by a Grecian master.  There is
a noble Claude Lorrain, a very curious Picture of the haughty Anne Stanhope, the Protector's
wife,(76) pretty but not giving one an idea of her character, and many old portraits; but the
housekeeper was at London, and we did not learn half.  The chapel is grand and proper.  At
the inn we entertained ourselves with the landlord, whom my Lord Harvey had cabineted when
he went to woo one of the Lady Seymours.

Our greatest pleasure was in seeing Cowdry, which is repairing; Lord Montacute(77) will at
last live in it.  We thought of old Margaret of Clarence, who lived there; one of her accusations
was built on the bulls found there.  It was the palace of her great uncle, the Marquis of Montacute.
I was charmed with the front, and the court, and the fountain; but the room called Holbein's,
except the curiosity of it, is wretchedly painted, and infinitely inferior to those delightful
stories of Harry the Eighth in the private apartment at Windsor.  I was much pleased with a
whole length picture of Sir Anthony Brown in the very dress in which he wedded Anne of Cleves
by proxy.  He is in blue and white, only his right leg is entirely white, which was certainly
robed for the act of putting into bed to her; but when the King came to marry her, he only
put his leg into bed to kick her out of it.

I have set up my staff, and finished my pilgrimages for this year.  Sussex is a great damper
of curiosity.  Adieu! my compliments to your sisters.

43 Letter 13 To Sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, Sept. 12, 1749,

I have your two letters to answer of August 15th and 26, and, as far as I see before me, have
a great deal of paper, which I don't know how to fill.  The town is notoriously empty; at Kensington
they have scarce company enough to pay for lighting the candles.  The Duke has been for a week
with the Duke of Bedford at Woburn; Princess Emily remains, saying civil things; for example,
the second time she saw Madame de Mircpoix, she cried out, "Ah! Madame, vous n'avez pas tant
de rouge aujourd'hui: la premi`ere fois que vous `etes `a not venue ici, vous aviez une quantit`e
horrible."  This the Mirepoix herself repeated to me; you may imagine her astonishment,--I
mean, as far as your duty will give you leave.  I like her extremely; she has a great deal
of quiet sense.  They try much to be English and whip into frocks without measure, and fancy
they are doing the fashion.  Then she has heard so much of that villanous custom of giving
money to the servants of other people, that there is no convincing her that women of fashion
never give; she distributes with both hands.  The Chevalier Lorenzi has dined with me here:
I gave him venison, and, as he was determined to like it, he protested it was "as good as beef."
You will be delighted with what happened to him: he was impatient to make his brother's compliments
to Mr. Chute, and hearing somebody at Kensington call Mr. Schutz, he easily mistook the sound,
and went up to him, and asked him if he had not been at Florence!  Schutz with the utmost Hanoverian
gravity, replied, "Oui, oui, J'ai `et`e `a Florence, oui, oui:--mais o`u est-il, ce Florence?"

The Richcourts(78) are arrived, and have brought with them a strapping lad of your Count; sure,
is it the boy my Lady O. used to bring up by hand? he is pretty picking for her now. The woman
is handsome, but clumsy to a degree, and as much too masculine as her lover Rice is too little
so.  Sir Charles Williams too is arrived, and tells me how much he has heard in your praise
in Germany.  Villettes is here, but I have had no dealings with him.  I think I talk nothing
but foreign ministers to-day, as if I were just landed from the Diet of Ratisbon. Do you know,
there is scarce a book in the world I love so much as her letters?

How infinitely humane you are about Gibberne!  Shall I amuse you with the truth of that history,
which I have discovered? The woman, his mother, has pressed his coming for a very private reason--only
to make him one of the most considerable men in this country!-and by what wonderful means do
you think this mighty business is to be effected? only by the beauties of his person! As I
remember, he was as little like an Adonis as could be: you must keep this inviolably; but depend
upon the truth of it-I mean, that his mother really has this idea.  She showed his picture
to--why, to the Duchess of Cleveland, to the Duchess of Portsmouth, to Madame Pompadour; in
short, to one of them, I don't know which, I only know it was not to my Lady Suffolk, the King's
former mistress.  "Mon Dieu! Madame, est-il frai que fotrc fils est si sholi que ce bortrait?
il faut que je le garte; je feux apsolument l'afoir."  The woman protested nothing ever was
so handsome as her lad, and that the nasty picture did not do him half justice.  In short,
she flatters herself that the Countess(79) will do him whole justice-.  I don't think it impossible
but, out of charity, she may make him groom of the chambers.  I don't know, indeed, how the
article of beauty may answer; but if you should lose your Gibberne, it is good to have @ a
friend at court.

Lord Granby is going to be married to the eldest of the Lady Seymours; she has above a hundred
and thirty thousand pounds. The Duke of Rutland will take none of it, but gives at present
six thousand a-year.

That I may keep my promise to myself of having nothing to tell you I shall bid you good night;
but I really do know no more. Don't whisper my anecdote even to Gibberne, if he is not yet
set out; nor to the Barrets.  I wish you a merry, merry baths of Pisa, as the link-boys say
at Vauxhall.  Adieu!

(78) Count Richcourt, brother of the minister at Florence, and envoy from the Emperor; his
wife was a Piedmontese.

(79) Lady Yarmouth.

45 Letter 14 To John Chute, Esq. Strawberry Hill, Sept. 22, 1749.

My dear sir, I expect Sir Charles Williams to scold me excessively.  He wrote me a letter,
in which he desired that I would send you word by last Post, that he expected to meet you here
by Michaelmas, according to your promise.  I was unfortunately at London; the letter was directed
hither from Lord Ilchester's, where he is; and so I did not receive it till this morning. 
I /hope, however, this will be time enough to put you in mind of your appointment; but while
I am so much afraid of Sir Charles's anger, I seem to forget the pleasure I shall have in seeing
you myself; I hope you know that: but he is still The more pressing, as he will stay so little
time in England. Adieu!

45 Letter 15 To George Montagu, Esq. Strawberry Hill, Sept. 28, 1749.

I am much obliged to you, dear sir, and agree with your opinion about the painting of Prince
Edward, that it cannot be original and authentic, and consequently not worth copying.  Lord
Cholmondeley is, indeed, an original; but who are the wise people that build for him?  Sir
Philip Harvey seems to be the only person likely to be benefited by this new extravagance.
I have just seen a collection of tombs like those you describe-- the house of Russel robed
in alabaster and painted.  There are seven monuments in all; one is immense, in marble, cherubim'd
and seraphim'd, crusted with bas-reliefs and titles, for the first Duke of Bedford and his
Duchess.(80)  All these are in a chapel of the church at Cheneys, the seat of the first Earls.
There are but piteous fragments of the house remaining, now a farm, built round three sides
of a court.  It is dropping down, in several places without a roof, but in half the windows
are beautiful arms in painted glass.  As these are so totally neglected, I propose making a
push, and begging them of the Duke of Bedford.  They would be magnificent for Strawberry-castle.
Did I tell you that I have found a text in Deuteronomy to authorize my future battlements?
"When thou buildest a new house, then shalt thou make a battlement for thy roof, that thou
bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence."

I saw Cheneys at a visit I have been making to Harry Conway at
Latimers.  This house, which they have hired, is large, and
bad, and old, but of a bad age; finely situated on a hill in a
beech wood, with a river at the bottom, and a range of hills
and woods on the opposite side belonging to the Duke of
Bedford.  They are fond of it; the view is melancholy.  In the
church at Cheneys Mr. Conway put on an old helmet we found
there: you cannot imagine how it suited him, how antique and
handsome he looked; you would have taken him for Rinaldo.  Now
I have dipped you so deep in heraldry and genealogies, I shall
beg you to step into the church of Stoke; I know it is not
asking you to do, a disagreeable thing to call there; I want an
account of the tomb of the first Earl of Huntingdon, an
ancestor of mine, who lies there.  I asked Gray, but he could
tell me little about it. You know how out of humour Gray has
been about our diverting ourselves with pedigrees, which is at
least as wise as making a serious point of haranguing against
the study.  I believe neither Mr. Chute nor I ever contracted a
moment's vanity from any of our discoveries,
 or ever preferred them to any thing but brag and whist.  Well,
Gray has set himself to compute, and has found out that there
must go a million of ancestors in twenty generations to every
body's composition.

I dig and plant till it is dark; all my works are revived and proceeding.  When will you come
and assist? You know I have an absolute promise, and shall now every day expect you.  My compliments
to your sisters.

(80) Anne, daughter of Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset.

46 Letter 16 To Sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, October 27, 1749.

You never was more conveniently in fault in your life: I have been going to make you excuses
these ten days for not writing; and while I was inventing them, your humble letter of Oct.
10th arrives.  I am so glad to find it is you that are to blame, not I. Well, well, I am all
good nature, I forgive you; I can overlook such little negligences.

Mr. Chute is indefatigable in your service, but Anstis(81) has been very troublesome; he makes
as many difficulties in signing a certificate about folks that are dead as if they were claiming
an estate.  I am sorry you are so pressed, for poor Mr. Chute is taken off from this pursuit:
he was fetched from hence this day se'nnight to his infernal brother's, where a Mrs. Mildmay,
whom you must have heard him mention, is dead suddenly: this may turn out a very great misfortune
to our friend.

Your friend, Mr. Doddington, has not quite stuck to the letter of the declaration he sent you:
he is first minister at Carlton-house, and is to lead the Opposition; but the misfortune is,
nobody will be led by him.  That whole court is in disorder by this event: every body else laughs.

I am glad the Barrets please you, and that I have pleased Count Lorenzi.  I must tell a speech
of the Chevalier, which you will reconnoitre for Florentine; one would think he had seen no
more of the world than his brother.(82)  He was visiting Lady Yarmouth with Mirepoix: he drew
a person into a window, and whispered him; Dites moi un peu en ami, je vous en prie; qu'est
ce que c'est que Miledi Yarmouth."--"Eh! bien, vous ne savez pas?"--"Non, ma foi: nous savons
ce que c'est que Miledi Middlesex.,"

Gibberne is arrived.  I don't tell you this apropos to the foregoing paragraph: he has wanted
to come hither, but I have waived his visit till I am in town.

I announce to you the old absurd Countess--not of Orford, but Pomfret.  Bistino will have enough
to do: there is Lady Juliana,(83) who is very like, but not so handsome as Lady Granville;
'and Lady Granville's little child.  They are actually in France; I don't doubt but you will
have them.  I shall pity you under a second edition of her follies.  Adieu! Pray ask my pardon
for my writing you so short a letter.

(81) Garter King at Arms. (It was to him Lord Chesterfield said, "You foolish man, you do not
know your own foolish business."-D.)

47 Letter 17 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Nov. 17, 1749.

At last I have seen le beau Gibberne: I was extremely glad to see him, after I had done contemplating
his person, which surely was never designed to figure in a romance.  I never saw a creature
so grateful!  It is impossible not to be touched with the attachment he has for you.  He talks
of returning; and, indeed, I would advise it for his sake: he is quite spoiled for living in
England, and had entirely forgot what Visigoths his countrymen are.  But I must drop him to
thank you for the charming intaglio which you have stolen for me by his means: it is admired
as much as it deserves; but with me it has all the additional merit of coming from you.  Gibberne
says you will be frightened at a lamentable history(84 that you will read of me in the newspapers;
but pray don't be frightened: -the danger, great as it was, was over before I had any notion
of it; and the hurt did not deserve mentioning.  The relation is so near the truth, that I
need not repeat it; and, indeed, the frequent repetition has 'Been much worse than the robbery.
I have at last been relieved by the riots(85) at the new French theatre, and by Lord Coke's
lawsuit.(86)  The first has been opened twice; the latter to-day.  The young men of fashion,
who espouse the French players, have hitherto triumphed: the old ladies, who countenance Lady
Mary Coke, are likely to have their gray beards brought with sorrow to the grave.  It will
,be a new aera, (or, as my Lord Baltimore calls it, a new area,) in English history, to have
the mob and the Scotch beat out of two points that they have endeavoured to make national.
I dare say the Chevalier Lorenzi will write ample accounts to Florence of these and all our
English phenomena.  I think, if possible, we brutalize more and more: the only difference is,
that though every thing is anarchy, there seems to be less general party than ever.  The humours
abound, but there wants some notable physician to bring them to a head.

The Parliament met yesterday: we had opposition, but no division on the address.

Now the Barrets have left you, Mr. Chute and I will venture to open our minds to you a little;
that is, to comfort you for the loss of your friends - we will abuse them--that is enough in
the way of the world.  Mr. Chute had no kind of acquaintance with Mr. Barret till just before
he set out: I, who have known him all my life, must tell you that all those nerves are imaginary,
and that as long as there are distempers in the world, he will have one or two constantly upon
his list.  I don't know her; I never heard much of her understanding, but I had rather take
your opinion; or at least, if I am not absolutely so complaisant, I will believe that you was
determined to like them on Mr. Chute's account.  I would not speak so plainly to you (and have
not I been very severe?) if I were not sure that your good nature would not relax any offices
of friendship to them.  You will scold me black and blue; but you know I always tell you when
the goodness of your heart makes you borrow a little from that of other people to lend to their
heads.  Good night!

(84) Mr. Walpole had been robbed the week before in Hyde Park, and narrowly escaped being killed
by the accidental going off of the highwayman's pistol, which did stun him, and took off the
skin of his cheekbone.

(85) The mob was determined not to suffer French Players; and Lord Trentham's engaging in their
defence was made great use, of against him at the ensuing election for Westminster; where he
was to be rechosen, on being appointed a lord of the admiralty.

(86) Lady Mary Coke swore the peace against her husband.

48 letter 18 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Jan. 10, 1750.

I don't at all know what to say to you, for not having writ to you since the middle of November:
I only know that nothing has happened, and so I have omitted telling you nothing.  I have had
two from you in the interim, one of Nov. @8th, and one without a date, in which you are extremely
kind about my robbery, of which in my last I assured you there were no consequences: thank
you a thousand times for having felt so much on my account.  Gibberne has been with me again
to-day, as his mother was a fortnight ago: she talked me to death, and three times after telling
me her whole history, she said, "Well then, Sir, upon the whole," and began it all again. 
Upon the whole, I think she has a mind to keep her son in England; (-ind he has a mind to be
kept, though in my opinion he is very unfit for living in England--he is too polished! For
trade, she says, he is in a cold sweat if she mentions it; and so they propose, by the acquaintance,
he says,. his mother has among the quality, to get him that nothing called something.  I assured
them, you had too much friendship for him to desire his return, if it would be a prejudice
to his interest--did not I say right?  He seems a good creature; too good to make his way here.

I beg you will not omit sending me every tittle that happens to compose my Lady Pomfret's second
volume.  We see perpetual articles of the sale of the furniture in the Great Duke's villas:
is there any truth in it? You would know me again, if you saw me playing at pharaoh on one
side of Madame de Mirepoix, as I used to do by her mother: I like her extremely, though she
likes nothing but gaming.  His pleasure is dancing: don't you envy any body that can have spirits
to be so simple as to like themselves in a minuet after fifty?  Don't tell his brother, but
the Chevalier Lorenzi is the object of the family's entertainment.  With all the Italian thirst
for English knowledge, he vents as many absurdities as if he had a passion for Ireland too.
He saw some of the Florentine Gesses at Lord Lincoln's; he showed them to the Ambassadress
with great transport, and assured her that the Great Duke had the originals, and that there
never had been made any copies of them.  He told her the other day that he had seen a sapphire
of the size of her diamond ring,,, and worth more: she said that could not be. "Oh!" said he,
"I mean, supposing your diamond were a sapphire."

I want to know Dr. Cocchi's and your opinion of two new French books, if you have seen them.
One is Montesquieu's "Esprit des Loix;" which I think the best book that ever was written--at
least I never learned half so much from all I ever read.  There is )s much wit as useful knowledge.
He is said to have hurt his reputation by it in France, which I can conceive, for it is almost
the interest of every body there that can understand it to decry it.  The other, far inferior,
but entertaining,, is Hainault's "Abrege Chronologique de l'Histoire de France." It is very
amusing, though very full of Frenchisms; and though an abridgment, often so minute as to tell
you when the Quinzevingts first wore flower-de-luces on their shoulders: but there are several
little circumstances that give one an idea of the manners of old time, like Dr. Cocchi's treatise
on the old rate of expenses.

There has been nothing particular in Parliament - all our conversation has turned on the Westminster
election, on which, after a vast struggle, Lord Trentham had the majority.  Then came on the
scrutiny: after a week's squabbling on the right of election, the High-bailiff declared what
he would take to be the right.  They are now proceeding to disqualify  votes on that foot;
but as his decision could not possibly please both sides, I fear it will come to us at last.

Lord Pembroke(87) died last night: he had been at the Bridge Committee,(88) in the morning,
where, according to custom, he fell into an outrageous passion; as my Lord Chesterfield told
him, that ever since the pier sunk he has constantly been damming and sinking. The watermen
say to-day, that now the great pier (peer) is quite gone.  Charles Stanhope carried him home
in his chariot; he desired the coachman to drive gently, for he could not avoid those passions;
and afterwards, between shame and his asthma, he always felt daggers, and should certainly
one day or other die in one of those fits. Arundel,(89) his great friend and relation, came
to him soon after: he repeated the conversation, and said, he did not know but he might die
by night. "God bless you! If I see you no more, take this as my last farewell!" He died in
his chair at seven o'clock.  He certainly is a public loss; for he was public-spirited and
inflexibly honest, though prejudice and passion were so predominant in him that honesty had
not fair play, whenever he had been set upon any point that had been given him for right. 
In his lawsuit with my Lady Portland he was scurrilously indecent, though to a woman; and so
blasphemous at tennis, that the present primate of Ireland(90) was forced to leave off playing
with him.  Last year he went near to destroy post-chaises, on a quarrel with the postmaster
at Hounslow, who, as he told the Bishop of Chichester, had an hundred devils and Jesuits in
his belly.  In short, he was one of the lucky English madmen who get people to say, that whatever
extravagance they commit "Oh, it is his way." He began his life with boxing, and ended it with
living upon vegetables, into which system avarice a little entered.  At the beginning of the
present war, he very honourably would resign his regiment, though the King pressed him to keep
it, because his rupture hindered his serving abroad.  My father, with whom he was always well,
would at any time have given him the blue riband; but he piqued himself on its being offered
to him without asking it.  the truth was, he did not care for the expense of the instalment.
His great excellence was architecture: the bridge at Wilton is more beautiful than any thing
of Lord Burlington or Kent.  He has left an only son, a fine boy about sixteen.(91)  Last week,
Lord Crawford(92) died too, as is supposed, by taking a large quantity of laudanum, under impatience
at the badness of his circumstances, and at the seventeenth opening of the wound which he got
in Hungary, in a battle with the Turks.  I must tell you a story apropos of two noble instances
of fidelity and generosity.  His servant, a French papist, saw him fall; watched, and carried
him off into a ditch.  Lord Crawford told him the Turks would certainly find them, and that,
as he could not live himself, it was in vain for him to risk his life too, and insisted on
the man making his escape.  After a long contest, the servant retired, found a priest, confessed
himself, came back, and told his lord that he was now prepared to die, and would never leave
him.  The enemy did not return, and both were saved.  After Lord Crawford's death, this story
was related to old Charles Stanhope, Lord Harrington's brother, whom I mentioned just now:
he sent for the fellow, told him he could not take him himself, but, as from his lord's affairs
he concluded he had not been able to provide for him, he would give him fifty pounds, and did.

To make up for my long silence, and to make up for a long letter, I will string another old
story, which I have just heard, to this.  General Wade was at a low gaming-house, and had a
very fine snuffbox, which on a sudden he missed.  Every body denied having taken it: he insisted
on searching the company.  He did: there remained only one man, who had stood behind him, but
refused to be searched, unless the general would go into another room alone with him: there
the man told him, that he was born a gentleman, was reduced, and lived by what little bets
he could pick up there, and by fragments which the waiters sometimes gave him. "At this moment
I have half a fowl in my pocket; I was afraid of being exposed; here it is! Now, Sir, you may
search me." Wade was so struck, that he gave the man a hundred pounds; and immediately the
genius of generosity, whose province is almost a sinecure, was very glad of the opportunity
of making him find his own snuff-box, or another very like it, in his own pocket again.

Lord Marchmont is to succeed Lord Crawford as one of the sixteen: the House of Lords is so
inactive that at last the ministry have ventured to let him in there.  His brother Hume Campbell,
who has been in a state of neutrality, begins to frequent the House again.

It is plain I am no moneyed man; as I have forgot, till I came to My last paragraph, what a
ferment the money-changers are in! Mr. Pelham, who has flung himself entirely into Sir John
Barnard's(93) hands, has just miscarried in a scheme for the reduction of interest, by the
intrigues of the three great companies and other usurers.  They all detest barnard, who, to
honesty and abilities, joins the most intolerable pride. @By my next, I suppose, you will find
that Mr. Pelham is grown afraid of somebody else, of some director, and is governed by him.
Adieu!--Sure I am out of debt now!

P.S. My dear Sir, I must trouble you with a commission, which I don't know whether you can
execute.  I am going to build a little Gothic castle at Strawberry Hill.  If you can pick me
up any fragments of old painted glass, arms, or any thing, I shall be excessively obliged to
you.  I can't say I remember any such things in Italy; but out of old chateaus, I imagine,
one might get it cheap, if there is any.

52 Letter 19 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Jan. 31, 1750.

You will hear little news from England, but of robberies;(94) the numbers of disbanded soldiers
and sailors have all taken to the road, or rather to the street: people are almost afraid of
stirring after it is dark.  My Lady Albemarle(95) was robbed the other night in Great Russell
Street, by nine men: the King gave her a gold watch and chain the next day.  She says, "the
manner was all"-and indeed so it was, for I never saw a more frippery present; especially considering
how great a favourite she is, and my Lady Yarmouth's friend.  The monarch is never less generous
than when he has a mind to be so: the only present he ever made my father was a large diamond,
cracked quite through.  Once or twice, in his younger and gallant days, he has brought out
a handful of maimed topazes and amethysts, and given them to be raffled for by the maids of
honour.  I told my Lady Yarmouth it had been a great loss to me that there was no queen, for
then I suppose I should have had a watch too when I was robbed.

We have had nothing remarkable in Parliament, but a sort of secession the other day on the
Mutiny-bill, when Lord Egmont and the Opposition walked out of the House, because the ministry
would go upon the Report, when they did not like It. It is a measure of the Prince's court
to lie by, and let the ministry demolish one another, which they are hurrying to do. The two
secretaries(96) are on the brink of declaring war: the occasion is likely to be given by a
Turnpike-bill, contested between the counties of Bedford and Northampton; and it (,rows almost
as vehement a contest as the famous one between Aylesbury and Buckingham.  The Westminster
election is still hanging in scrutiny: the Duke of Bedford paid the election,(97) which he
owns to have cost seven thousand pounds; and Lord Gower pays the scrutiny, which will be at
least as much.  This bustling little Duke has just had another miscarriage in Cornwall, where
he attacked a family-borough of the Morrices. The Duke(97) espouses the Bedford; and Lord Sandwich
is espoused by both.  He goes once or twice a-week to hunt with the Duke; and as the latter
has taken a turn of gaming, Sandwich, to make his court and fortune carries a box and dice
in his pocket; and so they throw a main, whenever the hounds are at a fault, "upon every green
hill, and under every green tree."

But we have one shocking piece of news, the dreadful account of the hurricane in the East Indies:
you will see the particulars in the papers; but we reckon that we don't yet know the worst..
Poor Admiral Boscawen(99) has been most unfortunate during his whole expedition; and what increases
the horror is, that I have been assured by a very intelligent person, that Lord Anson projected
this business on purpose to ruin Boscawen, who, when they came together from the victory off
Cape Finisterre, complained loudly of Anson's behaviour.  To silence and to hurt him, Anson
despatched him to Pondicherry, upon slight intelligence and upon improbable views.

Lord Coke's suit is still in suspense; he has been dying; she was to have died, but has recovered
wonderfully on his taking the lead.  Mr. Chute diverted me excessively with a confidence that
Chevalier Lorenzi made him the other night-I have told you the style of his bon-mots! He said
he should certainly return to England again, and that whenever he did, he would land at Bristol,
because baths are the best places to make acquaintance, just as if Mr. Chute, after living
seven years in Italy, and keeping the best company, should return thither, and land at Leghorn,
in order to make Italian acquaintance at Pisa!

Among the robberies, I might have told you of the eldest Miss Pelham leaving a pair of diamond
earrings, which she had borrowed for the birth-day, in a hackney chair; she had put them under
the seat for fear of being attacked, and forgot them.  The chairmen have sunk them.  The next
morning, when they were missed, the damsel began to cry: Lady Catherine(100) grew frightened,
lest her infanta should vex herself sick, and summoned a jury of matrons to consult whether
she should give her hartshorn or lavender drops?  Mrs. Selwyn,(101) who was on the panel, grew
very peevish, and said, "Pho! give her brilliant drops."  Such are the present anecdotes of
the court of England! Adieu!

been robbed in the streets, a proclamation appeared in the London Gazette, offering a reward

53 letter 20 To Sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, Feb. 25, 1750.

I am come hither for a little repose and air.  The fatigue of a London winter, between Parliaments
and rakery, is a little too much without interruption for an elderly personage, that verges
towards--I won't say what.  This accounts easily for my wanting quiet--but air in February
will make you smile--yet it is strictly true, that the weather is unnaturally hot: we have
had eight months of' warmth beyond what was ever known in any other country; Italy is quite
north with respect to us!-You know we have had an earthquake.  Mr. Chute's Francesco says,
that a few evenings before it there was a bright cloud, which the mob called the bloody cloud;
that he had been told there never were earthquakes in England, or else he should have known
by that symptom that there would be one within a week.  I am told that Sir Isaac Newton foretold
a great alteration in Our climate in the year '50, and that he wished he could live to see
it. Jupiter, I think, has jogged us three degrees nearer to the sun.

The Bedford Turnpike, which I announced to you in my last, is thrown out by a majority of fifty-two
against the Duke of Bedford.  The Pelhams, who lent their own persons to him, had set up the
Duke of Grafton, to list their own dependents under against their rival.  When the Chamberlain
would head a party, you may be sure the opposite power is in the wane.  The Newcastle is at
open war, and has left off waiting on the Duke, who espouses the Bedfords.  Mr. Pelham tries
to patch it up, and is getting the Ordnance for the Duke; but there are scarce any terms kept.
Lord Sandwich, who governs the little Duke through the Duchess, is the chief object of the
Newcastle hatred.  Indeed there never was such a composition!  he is as capable of all little
knavery, as if he was not practising all great knavery.  During the turnpike contest, in which
he laboured night and day against his friend Halifax, he tried the grossest tricks to break
agreements, when the opposite side were gone away on the security of a suspension of action:
and in the very middle of that I came to the knowledge of a cruel piece of flattery which he
paid to his protector.  He had made interest for these two years for one Parry, a poor clergyman,
schoolfellow and friend of his, to be fellow of Eton, and had secured a majority for him. 
A Fellow died: another wrote to Sandwich to know if he was not to vote for Parry according
to his engagement,--"No, he must vote for one who had been tutor to the Duke of Bedford," who
by that means has carried it.  My Lady Lincoln was not suffered to go to a ball which Sandwich
made the other night for the Duke, who tumbled down in the middle of a country dance; they
imagined he had beat his nose flat, but he lay like a tortoise on the topshell, his face could
not touch the ground by some feet.  My Lady Anson was there, who insisted on dancing minuets,
though against the rule of the night, with as much eagerness as you remember in my Lady Granville.
Then she proposed herself for a Louvre; all the men vowed they had never heard of such a dance,
upon which she dragged out Lady Leveson,(102) and made her dance one with her.

At the last ball at the same house, a great dispute of precedence, which the Duchess of Norfolk
had set on foot but has dropped, came to trial.  Lord Sandwich contrived to be on the outside
of the door to hand down to supper whatever lady came out first.  Madame de Mirepoix and the
Duchess of Bedford were the rival queens; the latter made a faint offer to the ambassadress
to go first; she returned it, and the other briskly accepted it; upon which the ambassadress,
with great cleverness, made all the other women go before her, and then asked the Duke of Bedford
if he would not go too.  However, though they continue to visit, the wound is incurable: you
don't imagine that a widow(103) of the House of Lorraine, and a daughter of Princess Craon,
can digest such an affront.  It certainly was very absurd, as she is not only an ambassadress
but a stranger; and consequently all English women, as being at home, should give her place.
King George the Second and I don't agree in our explication of this text of ceremony; he approves
the Duchess-so he does Miss Chudleigh, in a point where ceremony is out of the question.  He
opened the trenches before her a fortnight ago, at the masquerade- but at the last she had
the gout, and could not come; he went away flat, cross. His son is not so fickle.  My Lady
Middlesex has been miscarrying; he attends as incessantly as Mrs. Cannon.(104) The other morning
the Princess came to call him to go to Kew; he made her wait in her coach above half an hour
at the door. You will be delighted with a bon-mot of a chair-maker, whom he has discarded for
voting for Lord Trentham; one of his black-caps was sent to tell this Vaughan that the Prince
would employ him no more: "I am going to bid another person make his Royal Highness a chair."--"With
all my heart," said the chair-maker; "I don't care what they make him, so they don't make him
a throne."

The Westminster election, which is still scrutinizing, produced us a parliamentary event this
week, and was very near producing something much bigger.  Mr. Fox and Mr. Pitt moved to Send
for the High-bailiff to inquire into the delay.  The Opposition took it up very high, and on
its being carried against them, the Court of Requests was filled next day with the mob, and
the House crowded, and big with expectation.  Nugent had flamed and abused Lord Sandwich violently,
as author of this outrageous measure.  When the Bailiff appeared, the pacific spirit of the
other part of the administration had operated so much, that he was dismissed with honour; and
Only instructed to abridge all delays by authority of the House-in short, "we spit in his hat
on Thursday, and wiped it off on Friday."  This is a now fashionable proverb, which I must
construe to you.  About ten days ago, at the new Lady Cobham's(105) assembly, Lord Hervey(106)
was leaning over a chair, talking to some women, and holding his hat in his hand.  Lord Cobham
came up and spit in it--yes, spit in it!--and then, with a loud laugh, turned to Nugent, and
said, "Pay me my wager."  In short, he had laid a guinea that he committed this absurd brutality,
and that it was not resented.  Lord Hervey, with great temper and sensibility, asked if he
had any farther occasion for his hat?--"Oh! I see you are angry!"--"Not very well pleased."
Lord Cobham took the fatal hat and wiped it, made a thousand foolish apologies, and wanted
to pass it for a joke.  Next morning he rose with the sun, and went to visit Lord Hervey; so
did Nugent: he would not see them, but wrote to the Spitter, (or, as he is now called, Lord
Gob'em,) to say, that he had affronted him very grossly before company, but having involved
Nugent in it, he desired to know to which he was to address himself for satisfaction.  Lord
Cobham wrote him a most submissive answer, and begged pardon both in his own and Nugent's name.
Here it rested for a few days; till getting wind, Lord Hervey wrote again to insist on an explicit
apology under Lord Cobham's own hand, with a rehearsal of the excuses that had been made to
him.  This, too, was complied with, and the fair conqueror(107) shows all the letters.(108)
Nugent's disgraces have not ended here: the night of his having declaimed so furiously he was
standing by Lady Catherine Pelham, against Lord Sandwich at the masquerade, without his mask:
she was telling him a history of a mad dog, (which I believe she had bit herself.) young Leveson,
the Duchess of Bedford's brother, came up, without his mask too, and looking at Nugent, said,
, I have seen a mad dog to-day, and a silly dog too."--"I suppose, Mr. Leveson,(109) you have
been looking in a glass."--"No, I see him now."  Upon which they walked off together, but were
prevented from fighting, (if Nugent would have fought,) and were reconciled at the side-board.
You perceive by this that our factions are ripening.  The Argyll(110) carried all the Scotch
against the turnpike: they were willing to be carried, for the Duke of Bedford, in case it
should have come into the Lords, had writ to the sixteen Peers to solicit their votes; but
with so little deference, that he enclosed all the letters under one cover, directed to the
British Coffee-house!

The new Duke of Somerset(111) is dead: that title is at last restored to Sir Edward Seymour,
after his branch had been most unjustly deprived of it for about one hundred and fifty years.
Sir Hugh Smithson and Sir Charles Windham are Earls of Northumberland and Egremont, with vast
estates; the former title, revived for the blood of Percy, has the misfortune of being coupled
with the blood of a man that either let or drove coaches--such Was Sir Hugh's grandfather!
This peerage vacates his seat for Middlesex, and has opened a contest for the county, before
even that for Westminster is decided.  The Duchess of Richmond takes care that house shall
not be extinguished: she again lies in, after having been with child seven-and-twenty times:
but even this is not so extraordinary as the Duke's fondness for her, or as the vigour of her
beauty: her complexion is as fair and blooming as when she was a bride.

We expect some chagrin on the new regency, at the head of which is to be the Duke; "Au Augustum
fess`a aetate totiens in Germaniam commeare potuisse," say the mutineers in Tacitus-- Augustus
goes in April.  He has notified to my Lord Orford his having given the reversion of New Park
to his daughter Emily; and has given him leave to keep it in the best repair.  One of the German
women, Madame Munchausen, his minister's wife, contributes very kindly to the entertainment
of the town.  She is ugly, devout, and with that sort of coquetry which proceeds from a virtue
that knows its own weakness so much as to be alarmed, even when nothing is meant to its prejudice.(112)
At a great dinner which they gave last -week, somebody observed that all the sugar figures
in the dessert were girls: the Baron replied, "Sa est frai; ordinairement les petits cupitons
sont des garsons; mais ma femme s'est amus`ee toute la matin`ee `a en `oter tout sa par motestie."
This improvement of hers is a curious refinement, though all the geniuses of the age are employed
in designing new plans for desserts.  The Duke of Newcastle's last was a baby Vauxhall, illuminated
with a million of little lamps of various colours.

I have just received your long letter of February 13th, and am pleased that I had writ this
volume to return it.  I don't know how almost to avoid wishing poor Prince Craon dead, to see
the Princess upon a throne.(114)  I am sure she would invert Mr. Vaughan's wish, and compound
to have nothing else made for her, provided a throne were.

I despise your literati enormously for their opinion of Montesquieu's book.  Bid them read
that glorious chapter on the subject I have been mentioning, the selling of African slaves.
Where did he borrow that?  In what book in the world is there half so much wit, sentiment,
delicacy, humanity?

I shall speak much more gently to you, my dear child, though you don't like Gothic architecture.
The Grecian is only proper for magnificent and public buildings.  Columns and all their beautiful
ornaments look ridiculous when crowded into a closet or a cheesecake-house.  The variety is
little, and admits no charming irregularities.  I am almost as fond of the Sharavaggi, or Chinese
want of symmetry, in buildings, as in grounds or gardens.  I am sure, whenever you come to
England, you will be pleased with the liberty of taste into which we are struck, and of which
you can have no idea! Adieu!

he effectually did."-E.

of a passage in Cowper's Task, written thirty years after:--

We have had nothing in Parliament but trade-bills, on one of which the Speaker humbled the
arrogance of Sir John Barnard, who had reflected upon the proceedings of the House.  It is
to break up on Thursday Se'nnight, and the King goes this day fortnight.  He has made Lord
Vere Beauclerc a baron,(122) at the solicitation of the Pelhams, as this Lord had resigned
upon a pique with Lord Sandwich.  Lord Anson, who is treading in the same path, and leaving
the Bedfords to follow his father-in-law, the Chancellor, is made a privy councillor, with
Sir Thomas Robinson and Lord Hyndford.  Lord Conway is to be an earl,(123) and Sir John Rawdon(124)
(whose follies you remember, and whose boasted loyalty of having been kicked downstairs for
not drinking the Pretender's health, though even that was false, is at last rewarded,) and
Sir John Vesey are to be Irish lords; and a Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, and a Mr. Loyd,
Knights of the Bath.

I was entertained the other night at the house of much such a creature as Sir John Rawdon,
and one whom you remember too, Naylor.  he has a wife who keeps the most indecent house of
all those that are called decent: every Sunday she has a contraband assembly: I had had a card
for Monday a fortnight before.  As the day was new, I expected a great assembly, but found
scarce six persons.  I asked where the company was--I was answered, "Oh! they are not come
yet: they will be here presently; they all supped here last night, stayed till morning, and
I suppose are not up yet."

My Lord Bolinbroke has lost his wife.  When she was dying, he acted grief; flung himself upon
her bed, and asked her if she could forgive him.  I never saw her, but have heard her wit and
parts excessively commended.(125)  Dr. Middleton told me a compliment she made him two years
ago, which I thought pretty. She said she was persuaded that he was a very great writer, for
she understood his works better than any other English book, and that she had observed that
the best writers were always the most intelligible.

Wednesday.

I had not time to finish my letter on Monday.  I return to the earthquake, which I had mistaken;
it is to be to-day.

I shall now tell you something more serious: Lord Dalkeith(129) is dead of the small-pox in
three days.  It is so dreadfully fatal in his family, that besides several uncles and aunts,
his eldest boy died of it last year; and his only brother, who was ill but two days, putrefied
so fast that his limbs fell off as they lifted the body into the coffin.  Lady Dalkeith is
five months gone with child; she was hurrying to him, but was stopped on the road by the physician,
who told her that it was a miliary fever.  They were remarkably happy.

The King goes on Monday se'nnight;(130) it is looked upon as a great event that the Duke of
Newcastle has prevailed on him to speak to Mr. Pitt, who has detached himself from the Bedfords.
The Monarch, who had kept up his Hanoverian resentments, though he had made him paymaster,
is now beat out of the dignity of his silence: he was to pretend not to know Pitt, and was
to be directed to him by the lord in waiting.  Pitt's jealousy is of Lord Sandwich, who knows
his own interest and unpopularity so well, that he will prevent any breach, and thereby what
you fear, which yet I think you would have no reason to fear.  I could not say enough of my
anger to your father, but I shall take care to say nothing, as I have not forgot how my zeal
for you made me provoke him once before.

Your genealogical affair Is in great train, and will be quite finished in a week or two.  Mr.
Chute has laboured at it indefatigably: General Guise has been attesting the authenticity of
it to-day before a justice of peace.  You will find yourself mixed with every drop of blood
in England that is worth bottling up-. the Duchess of Norfolk and you grow on the same bough
of the tree.  I must tell you a very curious anecdote that Strawberry King-at-Arms(131) has
discovered by the way, as he was tumbling over the mighty dead in the Heralds' office.  You
have heard me speak of the great injustice that the Protector Somerset did to the children
of his first wife, in favour of those by his second; so much, that he not only had the dukedom
settled on the younger brood, but to deprive the eldest of the title of Lord Beauchamp, which
he wore by inheritance, he caused himself to be anew created Viscount Beauchamp.  Well, in
Vincent's Baronage, a book of great authority, speaking of the Protector's wives, are these
remarkable words: "Katherina, filia et una Coh. Gul: Fillol de Fillol's hall in Essex, uxor
prima; repudiata, quia Pater ejus post nuptias eam cognovit."  The Speaker has since referred
me to our journals, where are some notes of a trial in the reign of James the First, between
Edward, the second son of Katherine the dutiful, and the Earl of Hertford, son of Anne Stanhope,
which in some measure confirms our MS; for it says, the Earl of Hertford objected, that John,
the eldest son of all, was begotten while the Duke was in France.

the following passage in a letter written by Bolingbroke to Lord Marchmont a few days before
her death, it is difficult to believe that he "acted grief" upon this occasion:--"You are very
good to take my share in that affliction which has lain upon me so long, and which still continues,
with the fear of being increased by a catastrophe I am little able to bear. Resignation is
a principal duty in my system of religion: reason shows that it ought to be willing if not
cheerful; but there are passions and habitudes in human nature which reason cannot entirely
subdue.  I should be ashamed not to feel them in the present case."-E.

The High-bailiff, after commending himself and his own impartiality for an hour this morning,
not unlike your cousin Pelham, has declared Lord Trentham.  The mob declare they will pull
his house down to show their impartiality.  The Princess has luckily produced another boy;
so Sir George Vandeput may be recompensed with being godfather.  I stand to-morrow, not for
a member, but for godfather to my sister's girl, with Mrs. Selwyn and old Dunch: were ever
three such dowagers? when shall three such meet again? If the babe has not a most sentimentally
yellow complexion after such sureties, I will burn my books, and never answer for another skin.

You have heard, I suppose, that Nugent must answer a little more seriously for Lady Lymington's
child.  Why, she was as ugly as Mrs. Nugent, had had more children, and was not so young. 
The pleasure of wronging a woman, who had bought him so dear, could be the only temptation.

Adieu! I have told you all I know, and as much is scandal, very possibly more than is true.
I go to Strawberry on Saturday, and so shall not know even scandal.

66 Letter 24 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, May 19, 1750.

I did not doubt but you would be diverted with the detail of absurdities that were committed
after the earthquake: I could have filled more paper with such relations, If I had not feared
tiring you.  We have swarmed with sermons, essays, relations, poems, and exhortations On that
subject.  One Stukely, a parson, has accounted for it, and I think prettily, by electricity--but
that is the fashionable cause, and every thing is resolved into electrical appearances, as
formerly every thing was accounted for by Descartes's vortices, and Sir Isaac's gravitation.
But they all take care, after accounting for the earthquake systematically, to assure you that
still it was nothing less than a judgment.  Dr. Barton, the rector of St. Andrews, was the
only sensible, or at least honest divine, upon the occasion.  When some women would have had
him to pray to them in his parish church against the intended shock, he excused himself on
having a great cold.  "And besides," said he, "you may go to St. James's church; the Bishop
of Oxford is to preach there all night about earthquakes."  Turner, a great china-man, at the
corner of Dext street, had a jar cracked by the shock: he originally asked ten guineas for
the pair; he now asks twenty, "because it is the only jar in Europe that has been cracked by
an earthquake." But I have quite done with this topic.  The Princess of Wales is lowering the
price of princes, as the earthquake has raised old china; she has produced a fifth boy.  In
a few years we shall have Dukes of York and Lancaster popping out of bagnios and taverns as
frequently as Duke Hamilton.(140)  George Selwyn said a good thing the other day on another
cheap dignity: he was asked who was playing at tennis, He replied, "Nobody but three markers
and a Regent." your friend Lord Sandwich.  While we are undervaluing all principalities and
powers, you are making a rout with them, for which I shall scold you.  We had been diverted
with the pompous accounts of the reception of the Margrave of Baden Dourlach at Rome; and now
you tell me he has been put upon the same foot at Florence! I never heard his name when he
was here, but on his being mob'd as he was going to Wanstead, and the people's calling him
the Prince of Bad-door-lock.  He was still less noticed than he of Modena.

Lord Bath is as well received at Paris as a German Margrave in Italy.  Every body goes to Paris:
Lord Mountford was introduced to the King, who only said brutally enough, "Ma foi! il est bien
nourri!" Lord Albemarle keeps an immense table there, with sixteen people in his kitchen; his
aide-de-camps invite every body, but he seldom graces the banquet himself, living retired out
of the town with his old Columbine.(141)  What an extraordinary man! with no fortune at all,
and with slight parts, he has seventeen thousand a year from the government, which he squanders
away, though he has great debts, and four or five numerous broods of children of one sort or other!

The famous Westminster election is at last determined, and Lord Trentham returned: the mob
were outrageous, and pelted Colonel Waldegrave, whom they took for Mr. Leveson, from Covent-garden
to the Park, and knocked down Mr. Offley, who was with him. Lord Harrington(142) was scarce
better treated when he went on board a ship from Dublin.  There are great commotions there
about one Lucas, an apothecary, and favourite of the mob.  The Lord Lieutenant bought off a
Sir Richard Cox, a patriot, by a place in the revenue, though with great opposition from that
silly mock-virtuoso, Billy Bristow, and that sillier Frederick Frankland, two oafs, whom you
have seen in Italy, and who are commissioners there.  Here are great disputes in the Regency,
where Lord Harrington finds there is not spirit enough to discard these puppet-show heroes!

We have got a second volume of Bower'S(143) History of the Popes, but it is tiresome and pert,
and running into a warmth and partiality that he had much avoided in his first volume. He has
taken such pains to disprove the Pope's supremacy being acknowledged pretty early, that he
has convinced me it was acknowledged.  Not that you and I care whether it were or not. He is
much admired here; but I am not good Christian enough to rejoice over him, because turned Protestant;
nor honour his confessorship, when he ran away with the materials that were trusted to him
to write for the papacy, and makes use of them to write against it.  You know how impartial
I am; I can love him for being shocked at a system of cruelty supporting nonsense; I can be
pleased with the truths he tells; I can and do admire his style, and his genius in recovering
a language that he forgot by six years old, so well as to excel in writing it, and yet I wish
that all this had happened without any breach of trust!

Stosch has grievously offended me; but that he will little regard, as I can be of no use to
him: he has sold or given his charming intaglio of the Gladiator to Lord Duncannon.  I must
reprove you a little who sent it; you know how much I pressed you to buy it for me, and how
much I offered.  I still think it one of the finest rings(144) I ever saw, and am mortified
at not having it.

Apropos to Bower; Miss Pelham had heard that he had foretold the return of the earthquake-fit:
her father sent for him, to COnVince her that Bower was too sensible; but had the precaution
to talk to him first: he replied gravely, that a fire was kindled under the earth, and he could
not tell when it would blaze out.  You may be sure he was not carried to the girl!  Adieu!

and after a series of strange and not very creditable adventures, he arrived in England. Here
he declared himself a Protestant; but, after some years, wishing to swindle the English Jesuits
out of an annuity, be again returned to their order.  Having got all he could from them, he
again returned to Protestantism, and wrote his "History of the Popes," which was his principal
literary work.-D. (Gibbon, speaking of Bower, in his Extraits (le mon Journal for 1764, says,
" He is a rogue unmasked, who enjoyed, for twenty years, the favour of the public, because
he had quitted a sect to which he still secretly adhered; and because he had been a counsellor
of the inquisition in the town of Macerata, where an inquisition never existed." Bower died
in Bond Street, in September, 1766, in his eighty-first year, and was buried in Mary-le-bone
churchyard, where there is a monument to his memory.]

68 Letter 25 To George Montagu, Esq. Arlington Street, June 23, 1750.

Dear George, As I am not Vanneck'd(145) I have been in no hurry to thank you for your congratulation,
and to assure you that I never knew what solid happiness was till I was married.  Your Trevors
and Rices dined with me last week at Strawberry Hill, and would have had me answer you upon
the matrimonial tone, but I thought I should imitate cheerfulness in that style as ill as if
I were really married.  I have had another of your friends with me here some time, whom I adore,
Mr. Bentley; he has more sense, judgment, and wit, more taste, and more misfortunes, than sure
ever met in any man.  I have heard that Dr. Bentley, regretting his want of taste for all such
learning as his, which is the very want of taste, used to sigh and say, "Tully had his Marcus."
If the sons resembled as much as the fathers did, at least in vanity, I would be the modest
agreeable Marquis.  Mr. Bentley tells me that you press him much to visit you at Hawkhurst.
I advise him, and assure him he will make his fortune under you there; that you are an agent
from the board of trade to the smugglers, and wallow in contraband wine, tea, and silk handkerchiefs.
I found an old newspaper t'other day, with a list of outlawed smugglers; there were John Price,
alias Miss Marjoram, Bob Plunder, Bricklayer Tom, and Robin Cursemother, all of Hawkhurst,
in Kent.  When Miss Harriet is thoroughly hardened at Buxton, as I hear she is being,, in a
public room with the whole Wells, from drinking waters, I conclude she will come to sip nothing
but new brandy.

As jolly and as abominable a life as she may have been leading, I defy all her enormities to
equal a party of pleasure that I had t'other night.  I shall relate it to you to show you the
manners of the age, which are always as entertaining to a person fifty miles off, as to one
born an hundred and fifty years after the time.  I had a card from Lady Caroline Petersham
to go with her to Vauxhall.  I went accordingly to her house, and found her and the little
Ashe,(146) or the Pollard Ashe, as they call her; they had just finished their last layer of
red, and looked as handsome as crimson could make them.  On the cabinet-door stood a pair of
Dresden candlesticks, a present from the virgin hands of Sir John Bland: the branches of each
formed  a little bower over a cock and hen * * * *  We issued into the mall to assemble our
company, which was all the town, if we could get it; for just so many had been summoned, except
Harry Vane(147) whom we met by chance.  We mustered the Duke of Kingston, whom Lady Caroline
says she has been trying for these seven years; but alas! his beauty is at the fall of the
leaf; Lord March,(148) Mr. Whitehead, a pretty Miss Beauclerc, and a very foolish Miss Sparre.
These two damsels were trusted by their mothers for the first time of their lives to the matronly
care of Lady Caroline.  As we sailed up the mall with all our colours flying, Lord Petersham,(149)
with his hose and legs twisted to every point of crossness, strode by us on the outside, and
repassed again on the return.  At the end of' the mall she called to him; he would not answer:
she gave a familiar spring and, between laugh and confusion, ran up to him, "My lord! my lord!
why, you don't see us!"  We advanced at a little distance, not a little awkward in expectation
how all this would end, for my lord never stirred his hat, or took the least notice of any
body; she said, "Do you go with us, or are you going any where else?"--"I don't go with you,
I am going somewhere else;" and away he stalked. as sulky as a ghost that nobody will speak
to first.  We got into the best order we could, and marched to our barge,  with a boat of French
horns attending, and little Ashe singing.  We paraded some time up the river, and at last debarked
at Vauxhall - there, if we had so pleased, we might have had the vivacity of our party increased
by a quarrel; for a Mrs.  Loyd,(150)Who is supposed to be married to Lord Haddington, seeing
the two girls following Lady Petersham and Miss Ashe, said aloud, "Poor girls, I am sorry to
see them in such bad company!"  Miss Sparre, who desired nothing so much as the fun of seeing
a duel,--a thing which, though she is fifteen, she has never been so lucky to see,--took due
pains to make Lord March resent this; but he, who is very lively and agreeable, laughed her
out of this charming frolic with a great deal of humour.  Here we picked up Lord Granby, arrived
very drunk from Jenny's Whim;(151) where, instead of going to old Strafford's(152) catacombs
to make honourable love, he had dined with Lady Fanny,(153) and left her and eight other women
and four other men playing at brag.  He would fain have made over his honourable love upon
any terms to poor Miss Beauclerc, who is very modest, and did not know at all what to do with
his whispers or his hands.  He then addressed himself to the Sparre, who was very well disposed
to receive both; but the tide of champagne turned, he hiccupped at the reflection of his marriage
(of which he is wondrous sick), and only proposed to the girl to shut themselves up and rail
at the world for three weeks.  If all the adventures don't conclude as you expect in the beginning
of a paragraph, you must not wonder, for I am not making a history, but relating one strictly
as it happened, and I think with full entertainment enough to content you.  At last, we assembled
in our booth, Lady Caroline in the front, with the vizor of her hat erect, and looking gloriously
jolly and handsome.  She had fetched my brother Orford from the next box, where he was enjoying
himself with his petite partie, to help us to mince chickens.  We minced seven chickens into
a china dish, which Lady Caroline stewed over a lamp with three pats of butter and a flagon
of water, stirring and rattling, and laughing, and we every minute expecting to have the dish
fly about our ears.  She had brought Betty, the fruit-girl, with hampers of strawberries and
cherries from Rogers's, and made her wait upon us, and then made her sup by us at a little
table.  The conversation was no less lively than the whole transaction.  There was a Mr. O'Brien
arrived from Ireland, who would get the Duchess of Manchester from Mr. Hussey, if she were
still at liberty.  I took up the biggest hautboy in the dish, and said to Lady Caroline, "Madam,
Miss Ashe desires you would eat this O'Brien strawberry:" she replied immediately, "I won't,
you hussey."  You may imagine the laugh this reply occasioned.  After the tempest was a little
calmed, the Pollard said, "Now, how any body would spoil this story that was to repeat it,
and say, "I won't, you jade!"  In short, the whole air of our party was sufficient, as you
will easily imagine, to take up the whole attention of the garden; so much so, that from eleven
o'clock till half an hour after one we had the whole concourse round our booth: at last, they
came into the little gardens of each booth on the sides of ours, till Harry Vane took up a
bumper, and drank their healths, and was proceeding to treat them with still greater freedom.
It was three o'clock before we got home.  I think I have told you the chief passages.  Lord
Granby's temper had been a little ruffled the night before; the Prince had invited him and
Dick Lyttelton to Kew, where he won eleven hundred pounds of the latter, and eight of the former,
then cut and told them @e would play with them no longer, for he saw they played so idly, that
they were capable of "losing more than they would like."  Adieu! I expect in return for this
long tale that you will tell me some of your frolics with Robin Cursemother, and some of Miss
Marjoram's bon-mots.

P. S. Dr. Middleton called on me yesterday: he is come to town to consult his physician for
a jaundice and swelled legs, symptoms which, the doctor tells him, and which he believes, can
be easily cured: I think him visibly broke, and near his end.(154)  He lately advised me to
marry, on the sense of his own happiness; but if any body had advised him to the contrary,
at his time of life,(155) I believe he would not have broke so soon.

by what Mr. Yorke told me, his bricklayer will dispute the honour of his death with them.',-E.

(155) The Doctor had recently taken a third wife, the relict of a Bristol merchant.  On making
her a matrimonial visit, Bishop Gooch told Mrs. Middleton that ,he was glad she did not dislike
the Ancients so much as her husband did." She replied, "that she hoped his lordship did not
reckon her husband among the Ancients yet." The Bishop answered, "You, Madam, are the best
judge of that" Nichols's literary Anecdotes, Vol. v. p. 422.-E.

71 Letter 26 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, July 25, 1750.

I told YOU my idle season was coming on, and that I should have great intervals between my
letters; have not I kept my word? For any thing I have to tell you, I might have kept it a
month longer.  I came out of Essex last night, and find the town quite depopulated: I leave
it to-morrow, and go to Mr. Conway's(156) in Buckinghamshire, with only giving a transient
glance on Strawberry Hill.  Don't imagine I am grown fickle; I thrust all my visits into a
heap, and then am quiet for the rest of the season.  It is so much the way in England to jaunt
about, that one can't avoid it; but it convinces me that people are more tired of themselves
and the country than they care to own.

Has your brother told you that my Lord Chesterfield has bought the Houghton lantern? the famous
lantern, that produced so much patriot Wit;(157) and very likely some of his lordship's? My
brother had bought a much handsomer at Lord Cholmondeley's sale; for, with all the immensity
of the celebrated one, it was ugly, and too little for the hall.  He would have given it to
Lord Chesterfield rather than he should not have had it.

You tell us nothing of your big events, of the quarrel of the Pope and the Venetians, on the
Patriarchate of Aquileia.  We look upon it as so decisive that I should not wonder if Mr. Lyttelton,
or Whitfield the Methodist, were to set out for Venice, to make them a tender of some of our
religions.

Is it true too what we hear, that the Emperor has turned the tables on her Caesarean jealousy,(158)
and discarded Metastasio the poet, and that the latter is gone mad upon it, instead of hugging
himself on coming off so much better than his predecessor in royal love and music, David Rizzio?
I believe I told you that one of your sovereigns, and an intimate friend of yours, King Theodore,
is in the King's Bench prison.  I have so little to say, that I don't care if I do tell you
the same thing twice.  He lived in a privileged place; his creditors seized him by making him
believe lord Granville wanted him on business of importance; he bit at it, and concluded they
were both to be reinstated at once.  I have desired Hogarth to go and steal his picture for
me; though I suppose one might easily buy a sitting of him.  The King of Portugal (and when
I have told you this, I have done with kings) has bought a handsome house here,(159) for the
residence of his ministers.

I believe you have often heard me mention a Mr. Ashton,(160) a clergyman, who, in one word,
has great preferments, and owes every thing upon earth to me.  I have long had reason to complain
of his behaviour; in short, my father is dead, and I can make no bishops.  He has at last quite
thrown off the mask, and in the most direct manner, against my will, has written against my
friend Dr. Middleton,(161) taking for his motto these lines,

"Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magistri, Quid verum atque decens curo et rogo, et omnis
in hoc sum".

I have forbid him my house, and wrote this paraphrase upon his picture,

"Nullius addictus munus meminisse Patroni, Quid vacat et qui dat, curo et rogo, et omnis in
hoc sum."

I own it was pleasant to me the other day, on meeting Mr. Tonson, his bookseller, at the Speaker's,
and asking him if he had sold many of Mr. Ashton's books, to be told, "Very few indeed, Sir!"

I beg you will thank Dr. Cocchi much for his book; I will thank him much more when I have received
and read it.  His friend, Dr. Mead, is undone; his fine collection is going to be sold: he
owes about five-and-twenty thousand Pounds.  All the world thought himimmensely  rich; but,
besides the expense of his collection, he kept a table for which alone he is said to have allowed
seventy pounds a-week.

(156)  Mr. Conway had hired Latimers, in Buckinghamshire, for three years.

(157) In one pamphlet, the noise of this lantern, was so exaggerated, that the author said,
on a journey to Houghton, he was first carried into a glass-room, which he supposed was the
porter's lodge, but proved to be the lantern. [This lantern, which hung from the ceiling of
the hall, was for eighteen candles, and of copper gilt.  It was the Craftsman which made so
much noise about it.]

73 Letter 27 To sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, August 2, 1750.

I had just sent my letter to the '@Secretary's office the other day, when I received yours:
it would have prevented my reproving you for not mentioning the quarrel between the Pope and
the Venetians; and I should have had time to tell you that Dr. Mead's bankruptcy is contradicted.
I don't love to send you falsities, so I tell you this is contradicted, though it is by no
means clear that he is not undone-he is scarce worth making an article in two letters.

I don't wonder that Marquis Acciaudi's villa did not answer to you; by what I saw in Tuscany,
and by the prints, their villas are strangely out of taste, and laboured by their unnatural
regularity and art to destroy the romanticness of the situations.  I wish you could see the
villas and seats here! the country wears a new face; every body is improving their places,
and as they don't fortify, their plantations with intrenchments of walls and high hedges, one
has the benefit of them even in passing by.  The dispersed buildings, I mean temples, bridges,
etc. are generally Gothic or Chinese, and give a whimsical air of novelty that is very pleasing.
You would like a drawing-room in the latter style that I fancied and have been executing at
Mr. Rigby's, in Essex.  it has large and Very fine Indian landscapes, with a black fret round
them, and round the whole entablature of the room, and all the ground or hanging is of pink
paper.  While I was there, we had eight of the hottest days that ever were felt; they say,
some degrees beyond the hottest in the East Indies, and that the Thames was more so than the
hot well at Bristol.  The guards died )n their posts at Versailles: and here a captain Halyburton,
brother-in-law of lord Moncton, went mad with the excess

Your brother Gal. will, I suppose, be soon making improvements like the rest of the world:
he has bought an estate in Kent, called Bocton Malherbe, famous enough for having belonged
to two men who, in my opinion, have very little title to fame, Sir Harry Wotton and my lord
Chesterfield.  I must have the pleasure of being the first to tell you that your pedigree is
finished at last; a most magnificent performance, and that will make a pompous figure in a
future great hall at Bocton Malherbe when your great nephews or great-grandchildren shall be
Earls, etc.  My cousin Lord Conway is made Earl of Hertford, as a branch of the somersets:
Sir Edward Seymour gave his approbation handsomely.  He has not yet got the dukedom himself,
as there is started up a Dr. Seymour who claims it, but will be able to make nothing out.

Dr. Middleton is dead--not killed by Mr. Ashton--but of a decay that came Upon him at once.
The Bishop of London(162) will perhaps make a jubilee(163) for his death, and then We shall
draw off some Of your crowds of travellers.  Tacitus Gordon(164) died the same day; he married
the widow of Trenchard(165) (with whom he wrote Cato's letters,) at the same time that Dr.
Middleton married her companion.  The Bishop of Durham (Chandler),(166) another great writer
of controversy, is dead too, immensely rich; he is succeeded by Butler(167) of Bristol, a metaphysic
author, much patronized by the late Queen; she never could make my father read his book, and
-which she Certainly did not understand herself: he told her his religion was fixed, and that
he did not want to change Or improve it.  A report is come of the death of the King of Portugal,
and of the young Pretender; but that I don't believe.

I have been in town for a day or two, and heard no conversation but about M'Lean, a fashionable
highwayman, who is just taken, and who robbed me among others; as Lord Eglinton, Sir Thomas
Robinson, Of Vienna, Mrs. Talbot, etc.  He took an odd booty from the Scotch Earl, a blunderbuss,
which lies very formidably upon the justice's table.  He was taken by selling a laced waistcoat
to a pawnbroker, who happened to carry it to the very man who had just sold the lace. His history
is very Particular, for he confesses every thing, and is so little of a hero that he cries
and begs, and I believe, if Lord Eglinton had been in any luck, might have been robbed of his
own blunderbuss.  His father was an Irish Dean; his brother is a Calvinist minister in great
esteem at the Hague.  He himself was a grocer, but losing a wife that he loved extremely about
two years ago, and by whom he has one little girl, he quitted his business with two hundred
pounds in his pocket, which he soon spent, and then took to the road with only one companion,
Plunket, a journeyman apothecary, my other friend, whom he has impeached, but who is not taken.
M'Lean had a lodging in St. James's Street, over against White's, and another at Chelsea; Plunket
one in Jermyn Street; and their faces are as known about St. James's as any gentleman's who
lives in that quarter, and who perhaps goes upon the road too.  M'Lean had a quarrel at Putney
bowling-green two months ago with an officer, whom he challenged for disputing his rank; but
the captain declined, till M'Lean should produce a certificate of his nobility, which he has
just received.  If he had escaped a month longer, he might have heard of Mr. Chute's genealogic
expertness, and come hither to the college of Arms for a certificate.  There was a wardrobe
of clothes, three-and-twenty purses, and the celebrated blunderbuss found at his lodgings,
besides a famous kept mistress.  As I conclude he will suffer, and wish him no ill, I don't
care to have his idea, and am almost single in not having been to see him.  Lord Mountford,
at the head of half White's, went the first day - his aunt was crying over him: as soon as
they were withdrawn, she said to him, knowing they were of White's, "My dear, what did the
lords say to you?  have you ever been concerned with any of them?"-Was not that admirable?
what a favourable idea people must have of White's!--and what if White's should not deserve
a much better! But the chief personages who have been to comfort and weep over this fallen
hero are Lady Caroline Petersham and Miss Ashe: I call them Polly and Lucy, and asked them
if he did not sing

Thus I stand like the Turk with his doxies around."(168)

Another celebrated Polly has been arrested for thirty pounds, even old Cuzzoni.(169)  The Prince
Of Wales bailed her--who will do as much for him?

I am much obliged to you for your intended civilities to my liking Madame Capello; but as I
never liked any thing of her, but her prettiness, for she is an idiot, I beg you will dispense
with them on my account: I should even be against your renewing your garden assemblies.  you
would be too good to pardon the impertinence of the Florentines, and would very likely expose
yourself to more: besides, the absurdities which English travelling boys are capable of, and
likely to act or conceive, always gave me apprehensions of your meeting with disagreeable scenes-and
then there is another animal still more absurd than Florentine men or English boys, and that
is, travelling governors, who are mischievous into the bargain, and whose pride is always hurt
because they are sure of its never being indulged: they will not learn the world, because they
are sent to teach it, and as they come forth more ignorant of it than their pupils, take care
to return with more prejudices, and as much care to instil all theirs into their pupils.  Don't
assemble them!

Since I began my letter, the King of Portugal's death is contradicted: for the future, I will
be as circumspect as one of your Tuscan residents was, who being here in Oliver's time, wrote
to his court, "Some say the Protector is dead; others that he is not: for my part, I believe
neither one nor t'other."

Will u send me some excellent melon seeds? I have a neighbour who shines in fruit, and have
promised to get him some: Zatte`e, I think he says, is a particular sort.  I don't know the
best season for sending them, but you do, and will oblige me by some of the best sorts.

I suppose you know all that execrable history that occasioned an insurrection lately at Paris,
where they were taking up young children to try to people one of their colonies, in which grown
persons could never live.  You have seen too, to be sure, in the papers the bustle that has
been all this winter about purloining some of our manufacturers to Spain.  I was told to-day
that the informations, if they had had rope given them, would have reached to General Wall.(170)
Can you wonder?  Why should Spain prefer a native of England(171) to her own subjects, but
because he could and would do us more hurt than a Spaniard could?  a grandee is a more harmless
animal by far than an Irish Papist.  We stifled this evidence: we are in their power; We forgot
at the last peace to renew the most material treaty!  Adieu!  You would not forget a material
treaty.

in conjunction with Thomas Gordon, @ a series of political letters, under the signature of
"Cato."  They appeared at first in the " London Journal," and afterwards in the "British Journal,"
two newspapers of the day.  They obtained great celebrity, as well from the merit of their
composition, as from -the boldness of the principles they advocated.  These consisted in an
uncompromising hostility to the Government and to the Church.  Trenchard was member of parliament
for Taunton, and died in 1723.-D.

76 Letter 28 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Sept. 1, 1750.

Here, my dear child, I have two letters of yours to answer.  I will go answer them; and then,
if I have any thing to tell you, I will.  I accept very thankfully all the civilities you showed
to Madame Capello on my account, but don't accept her on my account: I don't know who has told
you that I liked her, but you may believe me, I never did.  For the Damers,(172)they have lived
much in the same world that I do.  He is moderately sensible, immoderately proud, self-sufficient,
and whimsical. She is very sensible, has even humour, if the excessive reserve and silence
that she draws from both father and mother -would let her, I may almost say, ever show it.
You say, "What people do we send you!" I reply, "What people we do not send you!" Those that
travel are reasonable, compared with those who can never prevail on themselves to stir beyond
the atmosphere of their own whims.  I am convinced that the Opinions I give you about several
people must appear very misanthropic; but yet, you see, are generally forced to own at last
that I did not speak from prejudice - but I won't triumph, since you own that I was in the
right about the Barrets.  I was a little peevish with 'you in your last, when I came to the
paragraph where you begin to say "I have made use of all the Interest I have with Mr. Pelham."(173)
I concluded you was proceeding to say, "to procure your arrears;" instead of that, it was to
make him serve Mr. Milbank--will you never have done obliging people? do begin to think of
being obliged.  I dare say Mr. Milbank is a very pretty sort of man, very sensible of your
attentions, and who will never forget them-till he is past the Giogo.(174) You recommend him
to me: to show you that I have not naturally an inclination to hate people, I am determined
not to be acquainted with him, that I may not hate him for forgetting you.  Mr. Pelham will
be a little surprised at not finding his sister(175) at Hanover.  That was all a pretence of
his wise relations here, who grew uneasy that he was happy in a way that they had not laid
out for him: Mrs. Temple is in Sussex.  They looked upon the pleasure of an amour of choice
as a transient affair; so, to Make his satisfaction permanent, they propose to marry him, and
to a girl(176) he scarce ever saw!

I suppose you have heard all the exorbitant demands of the heralds for your pedigree! I have
seen one this morning, infinitely richer and better done, which will not cost more; it is for
my Lady Pomfret.  You would be entertained with all her imagination in it.  She and my lord
both descend from Edward the First, by his two Queens.  The pedigree is painted in a book:
instead of a vulgar genealogical tree, she has devised a pine-apple plant, sprouting out of
a basket, on which is King Edward's head; on the other leaves are all the intermediate arms;
the fruit is sliced open, and discovers the busts of the Earl and Countess, from whence issue
their issue!  I have had the old Vere pedigree lately In my hands, which derives that house
from Lucius Verus; but I am now grown to bear no descent but my Lord Chesterfield's, who has
placed among the portraits of his ancestors two old heads, inscribed Adam de Stanhope and Eve
de Stanhope; the ridicule is admirable.  Old Peter Leneve, the herald, who thought ridicule
consisted in not being of an old family, made this epitaph, and it was a good one, for young
Craggs, whose father had been a footman, "Here lies the last who died before the first of his
family!"  Pray mind, how I string old stories together to-day.  This old Craggs,(177) who was
angry with Arthur More, who had worn a 78 livery too, and who was getting into a coach with
him, turned about and said, "Why, Arthur, I am always going to get up behind; are not you!"
I told this story the other day to George Selwyn, whose passion is to see coffins and corpses,
and executions: he replied, "that Arthur More had had his coffin chained to that of his mistress."--"Lord!"
said I, "how do you know!"--"Why, I saw them the other day in a vault at St. Giles's." He was
walking this week in Westminster Abbey with Lord Abergavenny, and met the man who shows the
tombs, "Oh! your servant, Mr. Selwyn; I expected to have seen you here the other day, when
the old Duke of Richmond's body was taken up." Shall I tell you another story of George Selwyn
before I tap the chapter of Richmond, which you see opens here very apropos? With this strange
and dismal turn, he has infinite fun and humour in him.  He went lately on a party of pleasure
to see places with Lord Abergavenny and a pretty Mrs. Frere, who love one another a little.
At Cornbury there are portraits of all the royalists and regicides, and illustrious headless.(178)
Mrs. Frere ran about, looked at nothing, let him look at nothing, screamed about Indian paper,
and hurried over all the rest.  George grew peevish, called her back, told her it was monstrous.
when he had come so far with her, to let him see nothing; "And you are a fool, you don't know
what you missed in the other room."--"Why, what?"--"Why, my Lord Holland'S(179) picture."--"Well!
what is my Lord Holland to me?"--"Why, do you know," said he, ,that my Lord Holland's body
lies in the same vault in Kensington church with my Lord Abergavenny's mother?" Lord! she 'was
so obliged, and thanked him a thousand times.

The Duke of Richmond is dead, vastly lamented: the Duchess is left in great circumstances.
Lord Albemarle, Lord Lincoln, the Duke of Marlborough, Duke of Leeds, and the Duke of Rutland,
are talked of for master of the horse.  The first is likeliest to succeed; the Pelhams wish
most to have the last: you know he is Lady Catherine's brother, and at present attached to
the Prince.  His son Lord Granby's match, which is at last to be finished to-morrow, has been
a mighty topic of conversation lately.  The bride is one of the great heiresses of old proud
Somerset.  Lord Winchilsea, who is her uncle, and who has married the other sister very loosely
to his own relation, Lord Guernsey, has tied up Lord Granby so rigorously that the Duke of
Rutland has endeavoured to break the match. She has four thousand pounds a year: he is said
to have the same in present, but not to touch hers.  He is in debt ten thousand pounds.  She
was to give him ten, which now Lord Winchilsea refuses.  Upon the strength of her fortune,
Lord Granby proposed to treat her with presents of twelve thousand pounds; but desired her
to buy them.  She, who never saw nor knew the value of ten shillings while her father lived,
and has had no time to learn it, bespoke away so roundly, that for one article of the plate
she ordered ten sauceboats: besides this, she and her sister have squandered seven thousand
pounds apiece in all kind of baubles and frippery; so her four thousand pounds a-year is to
be set apart for two years to pay her debts.  Don't you like this English management? two of
the greatest fortunes meeting and setting out with poverty and want!  Sir Thomas Bootle, the
Prince's chancellor, who is one of the guardians, wanted to have her tradesmen's bills taxed;
but in the mean time he has wanted to marry her Duchess-mother: his love-letter has been copied
and dispersed every where.  To give you a sufficient instance of his absurdity, the first time
he went with the Prince of Wales to Cliefden, he made a nightgown, cap, and slippers of gold
brocade, in which he came down to breakfast the next morning.

My friend M'Lean is still the fashion: have not I reason to call him my friend?  He says, if
the pistol had shot me, he had another for himself.  Can I do less than say I will be hanged
if he is?  They have made a print, a very dull one, of what I think I said to Lady Caroline
Petersham about him,

,Thus I stand like the Turk with his doxies around!"

You have seen in the papers a Hanoverian duel, but may be you don't know that it was an affair
of jealousy.  Swiegel, the slain, was here two years ago, and paid his court so Assiduously
to the Countess(180) that it was intimated to him to return; and the summer we went thither
afterwards, he was advised to stay at his villa.  Since that, he has grown more discreet and
a favourite.  Freychappel came hither lately, was proclaimed a beauty by the monarch, and to
return the compliment, made a tender of all his charms where Swiegel had. the latter recollected
his own passion Jostled Freychappel, fought, and was killed.  I am glad he never heard what
poor Gibberne was intended for.

They have put in the papers a good story made on White's: a man dropped down dead at the door,
was carried in: the club immediately made bets whether he was dead or not, and when they were
going to bleed him, the wagerers for his death interposed, and said it would affect the fairness
of the bet.

Mr. Whithed has been so unlucky as to have a large part of his seat,(181) which he had just
repaired, burnt down: it is a great disappointment to me, too, who was going thither Gothicizing.
I want an act of parliament to make master-builders liable to pay for any damage occasioned
by fire before their workmen have quitted it.  Adieu!  This I call a very gossiping letter;
I wish you don't call it worse.

(172) Joseph Damer, afterwards created Lord Milton in Ireland, married Lady Caroline Sackville,
daughter of Lionel, Duke of Dorset.

(173) Thomas Pelham, of Stanmer; a young gentleman who travelled with Mr. Milbank.

(174) The highest part of the Apennine between Florence and Bologna.

(175) Mrs. Temple, widow of Lord Palmerston's son: she was afterwards married to Lord Abergavenny.

(176) Frances, second daughter of Henry Pelham, chancellor of the exchequer.  Mr. Thomas Pelham
married Miss Frankland.

(177) The two Craggs, father and son, were successively members of the administration during
the reign of George the First, in the post of secretary of state.  The father died in 1718,
and the son in 1720; and Pope consecrated a beautiful epitaph to the memory of the latter.
They are both supposed to have been deeply implicated in the iniquities of the South Sea bubble.-D.

(178) This was the celebrated collection of portraits, principally by Vandyck, which Lord Dartmouth,
in his notes on Burnet, distinctly accuses the Lord Chancellor Clarendon of having obtained
by rapacious and corrupt means; that is, as bribes from the "old rebels," who had plundered
them from the houses of the royalists, and who, at the Restoration, found it necessary to make
fair weather with the ruling powers.  The extensive and miscellaneous nature of the collection
(now divided between Bothwell Castle, in Scotland, and The Grove, in Hertfordshire) very strongly
confirms this accusation.  An additional confirmation is to be found in a letter of Walpole,
addressed to Richard Bentley, Esq. and dated Sept. 1753, in which he says, "At Burford I saw
the house of Mr. Lenthal, the descendant of the Speaker.  The front is good; and a chapel,
connected by two or three arches, which let the garden appear through, has a pretty effect;
but the inside of the mansion is bad, and ill-furnished.  Except a famous picture of Sir Thomas
More's family, the portraits are rubbish, though celebrated.  I am told that the Speaker, who
really had a fine collection, made his peace by presenting them to Cornbury, where they were
well known, till the Duke of Marlborough bought that seat."-D.

(179) Henry Rich, Earl of Holland, the favourite of Queen Henrietta Maria.-D.

180) Lady Yarmouth.

(181) Southwick, in Hampshire.

80 Letter 29 To George Montagu, Esq. Strawberry Hill, Sept. 10, 1750.

You must not pretend to be concerned at having missed one here, when I had repeatedly begged
you, to let me know what day you would call; and even after you had learnt that I was to come
the next day, you paraded by my house with all your matrimonial streamers flying, without even
saluting the future castle.  To punish this slight, I shall accept your offer of a visit on
the return of your progress; I shall be here, and Mrs. leneve will not.

I feel for the poor Handasyde.(182)  If I wanted examples for to deter one from making all
the world happy, from obliging, from being always in good-humour and spirits, she should be
my memento.  You find long wise faces every day, that tell you riches cannot make one happy.
No, can't they? What pleasantry is that poor woman fallen from! and what a joyous feel must
Vanneck(183) have expired in, Who could call and think the two Schutzes his friends, and leave
five hundred pounds apiece to their friendship-. nay, riches made him so happy, that, in the
overflowing of his satisfaction, he has bequeathed a hundred pounds apiece to eighteen fellows,
whom he calls his good friends, that favoured him with their company on Fridays.  He took it
mighty kind that Captain James de Normandie, and twenty such names, that came out of the Minories,
would constrain themselves to live upon him once a week.

I should like to visit the castles and groves of your old Welsh ancestors with you: by the
draughts I have seen, I have always imagined that Wales preserved the greatest remains of ancient
days, and have often wished to visit Picton Castle, the seat of my Philipps-progenitors.

Make my best compliments to your sisters, and with their leave make haste to this side of the
world; you will be extremely welcome hither as soon and for as long as you like; I can promise
you nothing very agreeable, but that I will try to get our favourite Mr. Bentley to meet you.
Adieu!

(182) The widow of Brigadier-General Handasyde.-E.

(183) The legacies bequeathed by Gerard Vanneck amounted altogether to more than a hundred
thousand pounds.  The residue of his property he left to his brother, Joshua Vanneck, ancestor
of Lord Huntingfield.-E.

81 Letter 30 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, September 20, 1750.

I only write you a line to answer some of your questions, and to tell you that I can't answer
others.

I have inquired much about Dr. Mead, but can't tell you any thing determinately: his family
positively deny the foundation of the reports, but every body does 'not believe their evidence.
Your brother is positive that there is much of truth in his being undone, and even that there
will be a sale of his collection(184) when the town comes to town.  I wish for Dr. Cocchi's
sake it be false.  I have given your brother Middleton's last piece to send you.  Another fellow
of Eton(185) has popped out a sermon against the Doctor since his death, with a note to one
of the pages, that is the true sublime of ecclesiastic absurdity.  He is speaking against the
custom of dividing the Bible into chapters and verses, and says it often encumbers the sense.
This note, though long, I must transcribe, for it would wrong the author to paraphrase his
nonsense:--"It is to be wished, therefore, I think, that a fair edition were set forth of the
original Scriptures, for the use of learned men in their closets, in which there should be
no notice, either in text or margin, of chapter, or verse, or paragraph, or any such arbitrary
distinctions, (now mind,) and I might go so far as to say even any pointing or stops.  It could
not but be matter of much satisfaction, and much use, to have it in our power to recur occasionally
to such an edition, where the understanding might have full range, free from any external influence
from the eye, and the continual danger of being either confined or misguided by it."  Well,
Dr. Cocchi, do English divines yield to the Romish for refinements in absurdity! did one ever
hear of a better way (if making sense of any writing than by reading it without stops!  Most
of the parsons that read the first and second lessons practise Mr. Cooke's method of making
them intelligible, for they seldom observe any stops.  George Selwyn proposes to send the man
his own sermon, and desire him to scratch out the stops, in order to help it to some sense.

For the questions in Florentine politics, and who are to be your governors, I am totally ignorant,
you must ask Sir Charles Williams; he is the present ruling star of our negotiations. His letters
are as much admired as ever his verses were.  He has met the ministers of the two angry empresses,
and pacified Russian savageness and Austrian haughtiness.  He is to teach the monarch of Prussia
to fetch and carry, .@;, unless they happen to treat in iambics, or begin to settle the limits
of' Parnassus instead of' those of Silesia.  As he is so good a pacifier, I don't know but
we may want his assistance at home before the end of the winter:

"With secretaries, secretaries jar, And rival bureaus threat approaching war."

Those that deal in elections look still higher, and snuff a new Parliament; but I don't believe
the King ill, for the Prince is building baby-houses at Kew; and the Bishop of Oxford has laid
aside his views on Canterbury, and is come roundly back to St. James's for the deanery of St.
Paul's.(186)  I could not help being diverted the other day with the life of another Bishop
of Oxford, one Parker, who, like Secker, set out a Presbyterian, and died King James the Second's
arbitrary master of Maudlin College.(187)

M'Lean is condemned, and will hang.  I am honourably mentioned in a Grub-street ballad for
not having contributed to his sentence.  There are as many prints and pamphlets about him as
about the earthquake.  His profession grows no joke: I was sitting in my own dining-room on
Sunday night, the clock had not struck eleven, when I heard a loud cry of "Stop thief!" a highwayman
had attacked a postchaise in Picadilly, within fifty yards of this house: the fellow was pursued,
rode over the watchman, almost killed him, and escaped.  I expect to be robbed some night in
my own garden at Strawberry; I have a pond of gold fish, that to be sure they will steal to
burn like old lace; and they may very easily, for the springs are so much sunk with this hot
summer that I am forced to water my pond once a week!  The season is still so fine, that I
yesterday, in Kensington town, saw a horse-chestnut tree in second bloom.

As I am in town, and not within the circle of Pope's walks, I may tell you a story without
fearing he should haunt me with the ghost of a satire.  I went the other day to see little
Spence,(188) who fondles an old mother in imitation of Pope. The good old woman was mighty
civil to me, and, among other chat, said she supposed I had a good neighbour in Mr. Pope. "Lord!
Madam, he has been dead these seven years!"--"Ah! ay, Sir, I had forgot."  When the poor old
soul dies, how Pope will set his mother's spectre upon her for daring to be ignorant "if Dennis
be alive or dead!"(189)

(184) His collection was not sold till after his death, in the years 1754 and 1755.

(185) William Cooke.

(186) Dr. Secker.  In November he was appointed to the said deanery.-E.

(187) There is the following entry in Evelyn's Diary for March 23, 1687-8: "Dr. Parker, Bishop
of Oxford, who so lately published his extraordinary treatise about transubstantiation, and
for abrogating the test and penal laws, died.  He was esteemed a violent, passionate, haughty
man; but yet being pressed to declare for the church of Rome, he utterly refused it.  A remarkable
end."-E.

(188) The Rev. Joseph Spence, author of an Essay on Pope's Odyssey, Polymetus, etc.  See vol.
i. pp. 27, 65.  (He was always strongly attached to his mother.  When on his travels, in 1739,
he thus wrote to her:--"I am for happiness in my own way, and according to my notions of it,
I might as well, and better, have it in living with you, at our cottage in Birchanger, than
in any palace.  As my affairs stand at present, 'tis likely that we shall have enough to live
quite at our ease: when I desire more than that, may I lose what I have!"-E.)

Can sleep without a poem in my head, Nor know if Dennis be alive or dead." Pope, Prologue to
Satires.-E.

83 Letter 31 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Oct. 18, 1750.

I had determined so seriously to write to Dr. Cocchi a letter myself to thank him for his Baths
of Pisa, that it was impossible not to break my resolution.  It was to be in Italian, because
I thought their superlative issimos would most easily express how much I like it, and I had
already gathered a tolerable quantity together, of entertaining, charming, useful, agreeable,
and had cut and turned them into the best sounding! Tuscan adjectives I could find in my memory
or my Crusca:  but, alack! when I came to range them, they did not fadge at all; they neither
expressed what I would say, nor half what I would say, and so I gave it all up, and am reduced
to beg you would say it all for me; and make as many excuses and as many thanks for me as you
can, between your receiving this, and your next going to bully Richcourt, or whisper Count
Lorenzi.  I laughed vastly at your idea of the latter's hopping into matrimony; and I like
as much Stainville's jumping into Richcourt's place.  If your pedigree, which is on its journey,
arrives before his fall, he will not dare to exclude YOU from the libro d'oro-- -why, child,
you will find yourself as sumptuously descended as

--"All the blood of all the Howards."

or as the best-bred Arabian mare, that ever neighed beneath Abou-al-eb-saba-bedin-lolo-ab-alnin!
But pray now, how does cet homme l`a, as the Princess used to call him, dare to tap the chapter
of birth!  I thought he had not had a grandfather since the creation, that was not born within
these twenty years!-But come, I must tell you news, big news!  the treaty of commerce with
Spain is arrived signed.  Nobody expected it would ever come, which I believe is the reason
it is reckoned so good; for autrement one should not make the most favourable conjectures,
as they don't tell us how good it is.  In general, they say, the South Sea Company is to have
one hundred thousand pounds in lieu of their annual ship; which, if it is not over and above
the ninety-five thousand pounds that was allowed to be due to them, it appears to me only as
if there were some halfpence remaining when the bill was paid, and the King of Spain had given
them to the company to drink his health.  What does look well for the treaty is, that stocks
rise to highwater mark; and what is to me as clear, is, that the exploded Don Benjamin(190)
has repaired what the patriot Lord Sandwich had forgot, or not known to do at Aix-la-Chapelle.
I conclude Keene will now come over and enjoy the Sabbath of his toils.  He and Sir Charles
are the plenipotentiaries in fashion.  Pray, brush up your Minyhood and figure too: blow the
coals between the Pope and the Venetians, till the Inquisition burns the latter, and they the
Inquisition.  If you should happen to receive instructions on this head, don't wait for St.
George's day before you present your memorial to the Senate, as they say Sir Harry Wotton was
forced to do for St. James's, when those aquatic republicans had quarrelled with Paul the Fifth,
and James the First thought the best way in the world to broach a schism was by beginning it
with a quibble.  I have had some Protestant hopes too of a civil war in France, between the
King and his clergy: but it is a dull age, and people don't set about cutting one another's
throats with any spirit!  Robbing is the only thing that goes on with any vivacity, though
my friend Mr. M'Lean is hanged. The first Sunday after his condemnation, three thousand people
went to see him; he fainted away twice with the heat of his cell.  You can't conceive the ridiculous
rage there is of going to Newgate; and the prints that are published of the malefactors, and
the memoirs of their lives and deaths set forth with as much parade as--as--Marshal Turenne's--we
have no General's worth making a parallel.

The pasquinade was a very great one.(191)  When I was desiring YOU to make speeches for me
to Dr. Cocchi, I might as well have drawn a bill upon you too in Mr. Chute's name: for I am
sure he will never write himself.  Indeed, at present he is in his brother's purgatory, and
then you will not wonder if he does nothing but pray to get Out of it.  I am glad you are getting
into a villa: my castle will, I believe, begin to rear its battlements next spring.  I have
got an immense cargo of painted glass from Flanders: indeed, several of the pieces are Flemish
arms; but I call them the achievements of the old Counts of Strawberry.  Adieu!

(190) Benjamin Keene, afterwards knight of the bath, ambassador at Madrid, was exceedingly
abused by the Opposition in Sir Robert Walpole's time, under the name of Don Benjamin, for
having made the convention in 1739. [Mr.  Pelham, in a letter to Mr. Pitt of the 12th of October
1750, announcing the signing of the treaty with Spain, says, "I hope and believe, when you
see it and consider the whole, you will be of opinion, that my friend Keene has acted ably,
honestly, and bravely; but, poor man! he is so sore with old bruises, that he still feels the
smart, and fears another thrashing." See Chatham Correspondence, vol. i. P. 50.)

(191) It alluded to the quarrel between the Pope and the Venetians.  Marforio asked Pasquin,
"Perche si triste?"- -"Perche mon avremo pi`u Comedia, Pantalone `e partito."-D.

84 letter 32 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Nov. 19, 1750.

I stayed to write to you, till I could tell you that I had seen Mr. Pelham and Mr. Milbank,
and could give you some history of a new administration--but I found it was too long to wait
for either.  I pleaded with your brother as I did with you against visiting your friends, especially
when, to encourage me, he told me that you had given them a very advantageous opinion of me.
That is the very reason, says I, why I don't choose to see them: they will be extremely civil
to me at first; and then they will be told I have horns and hoofs., and they will shun me,
which I should not like.  I know how unpopular I am with the people with whom they must necessarily
live; and, not desiring to be otherwise, I must either seek your friends where I would most
avoid them, or have them very soon grow to avoid me.  However, I went and left my name for
Mr. Pelham, where your brother told me he lodged, eight days ago; he was to come but that night
to his lodgings, and by his telling your brother he believed I had not been, I concluded he
would not accept that for a visit; so last Thursday, I left my name for both--to-day is Monday,
and I have heard nothing of them--very likely I shall before you receive this--I only mention
it to show you that you was in the wrong and I in the right, to think that there would be no
empressement for an acquaintance.  Indeed, I would not mention it, as you will dislike being
disappointed by any odd behaviour of your friends, if it were not to justify myself, and convince
you of my attention in complying with whatever you desire of me.  The King, I hear, commands
Mr. Pelham's dancing; and he must like Mr. Milbank, as he distinguished himself much in a tournament
of bears at Hanover.

For the Ministry, it is all in shatters: the Duke of Newcastle is returned more averse to the
Bedfords than ever: he smothered that Duke with embraces at their first meeting, and has never
borne to be in the room with him since.  I saw the meeting of Octavia and Cleopatra;(192) the
Newcastle was all haughtiness and coldness.  Mr. Pelham, who foresaw the storm, had prudently
prepared himself for the breach by all kind of invectives against the house of Leveson.  The
ground of all, besides Newcastle's natural fickleness and jealousy, is, that the Bedford and
Sandwich have got the Duke.  A crash @as been expected, but people now seem to think that they
will rub on a little longer, though all the world seems indifferent whether they will or not.
Mankind is so sick of all the late follies and changes, that nobody inquires or cares whether
the Duke of Newcastle is prime minister, or whom he will associate with him.  The Bedfords
have few attachments, and Lord Sandwich is universally hated.  The only difficulty is, who
shall succeed them; and it is even a question whether some of the old discarded must not cross
over and figure in again.  I mean, it has even been said, that Lord Granville(193) will once
more be brought upon the stage:-if he should, and should push too forward, could they again
persuade people to resign with them? The other nominees for the secretaryship are, Pitt, the
Vienna Sir Thomas Robinson, and even that formal piece of dulness -,it the Hague, Lord Holderness.
The talk of the Chancellor's being president, in order to make room, by the promotion of the
Attorney to the seals, for his second son(194) to be solicitor, as I believe I once mentioned
to you, is revived; though he told Mr. Pelham, that if ever he retired, it should be to Wimple.(195)
In the mean time, the Master of the Horse, the Groom of the Stole, the Presidentship, (vacant
by the nomination of Dorset to Ireland in the room of Lord Harrington, who is certainly to
be given up to his master's dislike,) and the Blues, are still vacant.  Indeed, yesterday I
heard that Honeywood(196) was to have the latter.  Such is the Interregnum of our politics!
The Prince's faction lie still, to wait the event, and the disclosing of the new treaty.  Your
friend Lord Fane,(197) some time ago had a mind to go to Spain: the Duke of Bedford, who I
really believe is an honest man, said very bluntly, "Oh! my lord, nobody can do there but Keene."
Lord North is made governor to Prince George with a thousand a-year, and an earl's patent in
his pocket; but as the passing of the patent is in the pocket of time, it would not sell for
much. There is a new preceptor, one Scott,(198) recommended by Lord Bolingbroke.  You may add
that recommendation to the chapter of our wonderful politics.  I have received your letter
from Fiesoli Hill; poor Strawberry blushes to have you compare it with such a prospect as yours.
I say nothing to the abrupt sentences about Mr. B. I have long seen his humour--and a little
of your partiality to his wife.

We are alarmed with the distemper being got among the horses: few have died yet, but a farrier
who attended General Ligonier's dropped down dead in the stable.  Adieu!

either to open a negotiation with Earl Granville for settling a new administration, or to conciliate

86 Letter 33 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Dec. 19, 1750.

Well! you may be easy; your friends have been to see me at last, but it has so happened that
we have never once met, nor have I even seen their persons.  They live at Newcastle-house;
and though I give you my word my politics are exceedingly neutral, I happen to be often at
the court of Bedford.  The Interministerium still subsists; no place is filled up but the Lieutenancy
of Ireland; the Duke of Dorset was too impatient to wait.  Lord Harrington remains a melancholy
sacrifice to the famous general Resignation,(199) which he led up, and of which he is the only
victim.  Overtures have been made to Lord Chesterfield to be president; but he has declined
it; for he says he cannot hear causes, as he is grown deaf.  I don't think the proposal was
imprudent, for if they should happen, as they have now and then happened, to want to get rid
of him again, they might without consequence; that is, I suppose nobody would follow him out,
any more than they did when he resigned voluntarily.  For these two days every body has expected
to see Lord Granville president, and his friend the Duke of Bolton, colonel of the Blues; two
nominations that would not be very agreeable, nor probably calculated to be so to the Duke,
who favours the Bedford faction.  His old governor Mr. Poyntz(200) is just dead, ruined in
his circumstances by a devout brother, whom he trusted, and by a simple wife, who had a devotion
of marrying, dozens of her poor cousins at his expense: you know she was the Fair Circassian.(201)
Mr. Poyntz was called a very great man, but few knew any thing of his talents, for he was timorous
to childishness.  The Duke has done greatly for his family, and secured his places for his
children, and sends his two sons abroad, allowing them eight hundred pounds a year. The little
Marquis of Rockingham has drowned himself in claret; and old Lord Dartmouth is dead of ague.(202)
When Lord Bolingbroke's last work was published, on the State of Parties at the late King's
accession, Lord Dartmouth said, he supposed Lord Bolingbroke believed every body was dead who
had lived at that period.

There has been a droll cause in Westminster Hall: a man laid another a wager that he produced
a person who should weigh as much again as the Duke.  When they had betted, they recollected
not knowing how to desire the Duke to step into a scale.  They agreed to establish his weight
at twenty stone, which, however, is supposed to be two more than he weighs.  One Bright was
then produced, who is since dead, and who actually weighed forty-two stone and a half.)203)
As soon as he was dead, the person who had lost objected that he had been weighed in his clothes,
and thought it was impossible to suppose that his clothes could weigh above two stone, they
went to law.  There were the Duke's twenty stone bawled over a thousand times,-but the righteous
law decided against the man who had won!

Poor Lord Lempster(204) is more Cerberus(205) than ever; (you remember his bon-mot that proved
such a blunder;) he has lost twelve thousand pounds at hazard to an ensign of the Guards-but
what will you think of the folly of a young Sir Ralph Gore,(206) who took it into his head
that he would not be waited on by drawers in brown frocks and blue aprons, and has literally
given all the waiters at the King's Arms rich embroideries and laced clothes!  The town is
still empty: the parties for the two playhouses are the only parties that retain any spirit.
I will tell you one or two bon-mots of Quin the actor.  Barry would have had him play the ghost
in Hamlet, a part much beneath the dignity of Quin, who would give no other answer but, "I
won't catch cold behind."  I don't know whether you remember that the ghost is always ridiculously
dressed, with a morsel of armour before, and only a black waistcoat and breech behind.  The
other is an old one, but admirable.  When Lord Tweedale was nominal secretary of State for
Scotland, Mitchell,(207) his secretary, was supping With Quin, who wanted him to stay another
bottle; but he pleaded my lord's business.  "Then," said Quin, "only stay till I have told
you a story.  A vessel was becalmed: the master called to one of the cabin-boys at the top
of the mast, 'Jack, what are you doing?'  'Nothing, Sir.'  He called to another boy, a little
below the first, 'Will, what are you doing?'  'Helping Jack, sir.'"  Adieu!

88 Letter 34 To Sir Horace Mann. Strawberry Hill, Dec. 22, 1750.

As I am idling away some Christmas days here, I begin a letter to you, that perhaps will not
set out till next year.  Any changes in the ministry will certainly be postponed till that
date: it is even believed that no alteration will be made till after the session; they will
get the money raised -,And the new treaty ratified in Parliament before they break and part.
The German ministers arc more alarmed, and seem to apprehend themselves in as tottering a situation
as some of the English: not that any secretary of state is jealous of them--their Countess(208)
is on the wane.  The housekeeper(209) at Windsor, an old monster that Verrio painted for one
of the Furies, is dead.  The revenue is large, and has been largely solicited. Two days ago,
at the drawing-room, the gallant Orondates strode up to Miss Chudleigh, and told her he was
glad to have an opportunity of obeying her commands, that he appointed her mother housekeeper
at Windsor, and hoped she would not think a kiss too great a reward--against all precedent
he kissed her in the circle.  He has had a hankering these two years.  Her life, which is now
of thirty years' standing, has been a little historic.(210)  Why should not experience and
a charming face on her side, and near seventy years on his, produce a title?

Madame de Mirepoix is returned: she gives a lamentable account of another old mistress,(211)
her mother.  She has not seen her since the Princess went to Florence, which she it seems has
left with great regret; with greater than her beauty, whose ruins she has not discovered: but
with few teeth, few hairs, sore eyes, and wrinkles, goes bare-necked and crowned with jewels!
Madame Mirepoix told me  a reply of Lord Cornbury, that pleased me extremely.  They have revived
at Paris old Fontenelle's opera of Peleus and Thetis: he complained of being dragged upon the
stage again for one of his juvenile performances, and said he could not bear to be hissed now:
Lord Cornbury immediately replied to him out of the very opera,

"Jupiter en courroux
                                                              '
Ne peut rien contre vous,
Vous `etes immortel."

Our old laureat has been dying: when he thought himself at the extremity, he wrote this lively,
good-natured letter to the Duke of Grafton:-

""May it please your Grace: "I know no nearer way of repaying your favours for these last twenty
years than by recommending the bearer, Mr. Henry Jones, for the vacant laurel: Lord Chesterfield
will tell you more of him.  I don't know the day of my death, but while I live, I shall not
cease to be, your Grace's, etc.

"Colley Cibber."                                        '

I asked my Lord Chesterfield who this Jones(212) is; he told me a better poet would not take
the post, and a worse ought not to have it. There are two new bon-mots of his lordship much
repeated, better than his ordinary.  He says, he would not be president, because he would not
be between two fires;(213) and that"the two brothers are like Arbuthnot's Lindamira and Indamora;(214)
the latter was an able, tractable gentlewoman, but her sister was always quarrelling and kicking
and as they grew together, there was no parting them.

You will think my letters are absolute jest-and-story books, unless you will be so good as
to dignify them with the title of Walpoliana.  Under that hope, I will tell you a very odd
new story.  A citizen had advertised a reward for the discovery of a person who had stolen
sixty guineas out of his scrutoire.  He received a message from a condemned criminal in Newgate,
with the offer of revealing the thief.  Being a cautious grave personage, he took two friends
along with him.  The convict told him that he was the robber; and when he doubted, the fellow
began with these circumstances; You came home such a night, and put the money into your bureau:
I was Under your bed: you undressed, and then went to the foot of the garret stairs, and cried,
'Mary, come to bed to me-'"  "Hold, hold," said the citizen, "I am convinced."  "Nay," said
the fellow, "you shell hear all, for our intrigue saved your life.  Mary replied, 'If any body
wants me, they may come up to me:' you went: I robbed your bureau in the mean time, but should
have cut your throat, if you had gone into your bed instead of Mary S."

The conclusion of my letter will be a more serious story, but very proper for the Walpoliana.
I have given you scraps of Ashton's history.  To perfect his ingratitude, he has struck up
an intimacy with my second brother, and done his utmost to make a new quarrel between us, on
the merit of having broke with me on the affair of Dr. Middleton.  I don't know whether I ever
told you that my brother hated Middleton, who was ill with a Dr. Thirlby,(215) a creature of
his.  He carried this and his jealousy of me so far, that once when Lord Mountford brought
Middleton for one night only to Houghton my brother wrote my father a most outrageous letter,
telling him that he knew I had fetched Middleton to Houghton to write my father's life, and
how much more capable Thirlby was of this task.  Can one help admiring in these instances the
dignity of human nature!  Poor Mrs. Middleton is alarmed with a scheme that I think she very
justly suspects as a plot of the clergy to get at and suppress her husband's papers.  He died
in a lawsuit with a builder, who has since got a monition from the Commons for her to produce
all the Doctor's effects and papers.  The whole debt is but eight hundred pounds.  She offered
ten thousand pounds security, and the fellow will not take it.  Is there clergy in it, or no?

89 Letter 35 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, Feb. 9, 1751.

You will wonder that I, who am pretty punctual, even when I have little to say, should have
been so silent at the beginning of a session: I will tell you some reasons why; what I had
to tell you was not finished; I wished to give you an entire account: besides, we have had
so vigorous an attendance, that with that, and the fatigue, it was impossible to write.  Before
the Parliament met, there was a dead tranquillity, and no symptoms of party spirit.  What is
more extraordinary, though the Opposition set out vehemently the very first day, there has
appeared ten times greater spirit on the court side, a Whig vehemence that has rushed on heartily.
I have been much entertained-what should I have been, if I had lived in the times of the Exclusion-bill,
and the end of queen Anne's reign, when votes and debates really tended to something! Now they
tend but to the alteration of a dozen places, perhaps, more or less-but come, I'll tell you,
and you shall judge for yourself. The morning the Houses met, there was universally dispersed,
by the penny post, and by being dropped into the areas of houses, a paper called Constitutional
Queries, a little equivocal, for it is not clear whether they were levelled at the Family,
or by Part of the Family at the Duke.(216)  The Address was warmly opposed, and occasioned
a remarkable speech of Pitt, in recantation of his former orations on the Spanish, war, and
in panegyric on the Duke of Newcastle, wit whom e is pushing himself, and by whom he is pushed
at all rates, in opposition to Lord Sandwich and the Bedfords.  Two or three days afterwards
there were motions in both Houses to have the Queries publicly burnt.  That too occasioned
a debate with us, and a fine speech of Lord Egmont, artfully condemning the paper, though a
little suspected of it, and yet supporting some of the reasonings in it.  There was no division
on the resolution; but two days afterwards we had a very extraordinary and unforeseen one.
Mr. Pelham had determined to have 'but 8,000 seamen this year, instead of 10,000.  Pitt and
his cousins, without any notice given, declared with the Opposition for the greater number.
The key to this you will find in Pit'S whole behaviour; whenever he wanted new advancement,
he used to go off He has openly met with great discouragement now; though he and we know Mr.
Pelham so -well, that it Will not be surprising if, though baffled, he still carries his point
of secretary of state.  However, the old corps resented this violently, and rushed up their
old anger: Mr. Pelham was inclined to give way, but Lord Hartington, at the head of the young
Whigs, divided the House, and Pitt had the mortification of being followed into the minority
by only fifteen persons.  The King has been highly pleased with this event; and has never named
the Pitts and Grenvilles to the Duke of Newcastle, but to abuse them, and to commend the spirit
of the young people.  It has not weakened the Bedford faction, who have got more strength by
the clumsy politics of another set of their enemies.  There has all the summer been a Westminster
petition in agitation, driven on by the independent electors, headed by Lord Elibank, Murray
his brother, and one or two gentlemen. Sir John Cotton, and Cooke the member for Middlesex,
discouraged it all they could, and even stifled the first drawn, which was absolutely treason.
However, Cooke at last presented one from the inhabitants, and Lord Egmont another from Sir
George Vandeput; and Cooke even made a strong invective against the High-bailiff; on which
Lord Trentham produced and read a letter written by Cooke to the High-bailiff, when he was
in their interest, and stuffed with flattery to him.  Lord Trentham's friends then called in
the High-bailiff, who accused some persons of hindering and threatening him on the scrutiny,
and, after some contention, named Crowle, counsel for Sir George Vandeput, Gibson, an upholsterer
and independent, and Mr. Murray.(217)  These three were ordered to attend on the following
Thursday to defend themselves.  Before that day came, we had the report on the eight thousand
seamen, when Pitt and his associates made speeches of lamentation on their disagreement with
Pelham, whom they flattered inordinately.  This ended in a burlesque quarrel between Pitt and
Hampden,(218) a buffoon who hates the cousinhood, and thinks his name should entitle him to
Pitt's office.  We had a very long day on Crowle's defence, who had called the power of the
House brutum fulmen: he was very submissive, and was dismissed with a reprimand on his knees.
Lord Egmont was so severely handled by Fox, that he has not recovered his spirits since.  He
used to cry up Fox against Mr. Pelham, but since the former has seemed rather attached to the
Duke and the Duke of Bedford, the party affect to heap incense on Pelham and Pitt--and it is
returned.

The day that Murray came to the bar he behaved with great confidence, but at last desired counsel,
which was granted: in the mean time we sent Gibson to Newgate.  Last Wednesday was the day
of trial: the accusation was plentifully proved against Murray, and it was voted to send him
close prisoner to Newgate. His party still struggling against the term close, the Whigs grew
provoked, and resolved he should receive his sentence on his knees at the bar.  To this he
refused to submit.  The Speaker stormed, and the House and its honour grew outrageous at the
dilemma they were got into, and indeed out of which we are not got yet.  If he gets the better,
he will indeed be a meritorious martyr for the cause: en attendant, he is strictly shut up
in Newgate.(219)

By these anecdotes you will be able to judge a little of the news you mention in your last,
of January 29th, and will perceive that our ministerial vacancies and successions are not likely
to be determined soon.  Niccolini's account of the aversion to Lord Sandwich is well grounded,
though as to inflexible resentments, there cannot easily be any such thing, where parties and
factions are so fluctuating as in this country.  I was to have dined the other day at Madame
de Mirepoix's with my Lord Bolingbroke, but he was ill.  She said, she had repented asking
me, as she did not know if I should like it. , Oh! Madam, I have gone through too many of those
things to make any objection to the only one that remains!"

I grieve much for the return of pains in your head and breast; I flattered myself that you
had quite mastered them.

I have seen your Pelham and Milbank, not much, but I like the latter; I have some notion, from
thinking that he resembles you in his manner.  The other seems very good-humoured, but he is
nothing but complexion.  Dame is returned; he looks ill; but I like him better than I used
to do, for he commends you.  My Lord Pomfret is made ranger of the parks, and by consequence
my Lady is queen of the Duck Island.(220)  Our greatest miracle is Lady Mary Wortley's son,(221)
whose adventures have made so much noise- his parts are not proportionate, but his expense
is incredible.  His father scarce allows him any thing: yet he plays, dresses, diamonds himself,
even to distinct shoe-buckles for a frock, and has more snuff-boxes than would suffice a Chinese
idol with an hundred noses.  But the most curious part of his dress, which he has brought from
Paris, is an iron wig; you literally would not know it from hair--I believe it is on this account
that the Royal Society have just chosen him of their body.  This may surprise you: what I am
now going to tell you will not, for you have only known her follies - the Duchess of Queensbury
told Lady Di. Egerton,(222) a pretty daughter of the Duchess of Bridgewater, that she was going
to make a ball for her: she did, but did not invite her: the girl was mortified, and Mr. Lyttelton,
her father-in-law, sent the mad Grace a hint of it.  She sent back this card-. "The advertisement
came to hand; it was very pretty and very ingenious; but every thing that is pretty and ingenious
does not always succeed; the Duchess of Q. piques herself on her house being unlike Socrates's;
his was small and held all his friends; hers is large, but will not hold half of hers: postponed,
but not forgot: unalterable." Adieu!

94 Letter 36 To Sir Horace Mann. Arlington Street, March 13, 1751.

You will be expecting the conclusion of Mr. Murray's history, but as he is too great a hero
to submit, and not hero enough to terminate his prison in a more summary, or more English way,
you must have patience, as we shall have, till the end of the session.  His relations, who
had leave to visit him, are excluded again: rougher methods with him are not the style of the
age: in the mean time he is quite forgot.  General Anstruther is now the object in fashion,
or made so by a Sir Harry Erskine, a very fashionable figure in the world of politics, who
has just come into Parliament, and has been laying a foundation for the next reign by attacking
the Mutiny-bill, and occasionally General Anstruther, who treated him hardly ten years ago
in Minorca.  Anstruther has mutually persecuted and been persecuted by the Scotch ever since
Porteous's affair, when, of all that nation, he alone voted for demolishing part of Edinburgh.
This affair would be a trifle, if it had not opened the long-smothered rivalship between Fox
and Pitt: for these ten days they have been civilly at war together; and Mr. Pelham is bruised
between both.  However, this impetuosity of Pitt has almost overset the total engrossment that
the Duke of Newcastle had made of all power, and if they do not, as it is suspected, league
with the Prince, you will not so soon hear of the fall of the Bedfords, as I had made you expect.
With this quantity of factions ind infinite quantity of speakers, we have had a most fatiguing
session, and seldom rise before nine or ten at night.

There have been two events, not political, equal to any absurdities or follies of former years.
My Lady Vane(223) has literally published the memoirs of her own life, Only suppressing part
of her lovers, no part of the success of the others with her: a degree of profligacy not to
be accounted for; she does not want money, none of her lovers will raise her credit; and the
number, all she had to brag of, concealed! The other is a play that has been acted by people
of some fashion at Drury Lane, hired on purpose.  They really acted so well that it is astonishing
they should not have had sense enough not to act at all.  You would know none of their names,
should I tell you; but the chief were a family of Delavals, the eldest of which was married
by one Foote, a player, to Lady Nassau Poulett,(224) who had kept the latter.  The rage was
so great to see this performance that the House of Commons literally adjourned at three o'clock
on purpose: the footman's gallery was strung with blue ribands.  What a wise people! what an
august Senate! yet my Lord Granville once told the Prince, I forget on occasion of what folly,
"Sir, indeed your Royal Highness is in the wrong to act thus; the English are a grave nation."

The King has been much out of order, but he is quite well again, and they say, not above sixty-seven!
Adieu!
