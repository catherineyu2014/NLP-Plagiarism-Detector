Nyctanassa violacea violacea (Linnaeus).--A Yellow-crowned Night Heron in immediate post-juvenile
plumage, No. 36413, was obtained on September 7, 1958, 16 km. south of Cuatro Ciénegas, by
W. L. Minckley. According to him the bird was accompanied by "several" other herons seemingly
of the same species and condition of plumage. The species seems not to have been recorded previously
from Coahuila [Eds.]. I suspect that this is the locality to which Friedmann, Griscom, and
Moore (loc. cit.) referred.

[Branta canadensis leucopareia (Brandt).--Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:38) listed B.
c. leucopareia from "northern Coahuila."]

**Dendrocygna autumnalis (Linnaeus).--Evenden (1952:112) reported a Black-bellied Tree Duck
standing beside a reservoir in southern Coahuila along the railroad between Saltillo, Coahuila,
and Avalos, Zacatecas.

**Anas platyrhynchos Linnaeus.--On March 30, 1952, Olmstead recorded a Mallard from 10 mi.
E Hacienda La Mariposa, 2000 feet.

Anas strepera Linnaeus.--Specimen examined: one, [Male] 31016, from 10 mi. E Hacienda La Mariposa,
2000 ft., March 30, 1952.

The Gadwell is not an uncommon spring migrant; Olmstead saw it 10 mi. E Hacienda La Mariposa
on March 30, 1952, and Baker observed it 8 mi. N and 4 mi. W Múzquiz on March 30, 1952. Friedmann,
Griscom, and Moore (1950:42) recorded the Gadwell from Coahuila.

Anas acuta Linnaeus.--Miller (1955a:161) took a Pintail on September 10 in the Sierra del Carmen.

Anas carolinensis Gmelin.--The Green-winged Teal has been recorded from northern Coahuila.
Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:15) recorded two mated pairs along the Río Grande at Lajitas, Texas,
on May 10. Miller (1955a:161) remarked that a male of the year was taken in the Sierra del
Carmen on September 4.

Anas discors discors Linnaeus.--Specimens examined: total 2: sex ? 31646 and sex ? 31647 from
.5 mi. S Las Margaritas, 2800 ft., September 28, 1953.

The Blue-winged Teal is a fairly common spring and fall migrant in Coahuila. Van Tyne and Sutton
(1937:15) noted the Blue-winged Teal at several different localities along the Río Grande:
"on May 8, four males and several females resting on a mud bar along the Río Grande near Hot
Springs [Texas]; ... on May 7, three pairs in a flock, along the Río Grande, Castalon [Texas];
... and on May 20, three pairs, along the Río Grande, San Vicente [Texas]." Miller (1955a:161)
reported that Marsh took a male of the year in the Sierra del Carmen on September 10. Dickerman
observed Blue-winged Teal 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos on May 18, 1954. Nos. 31646-31647,
which are probably females, represent the subspecies discors because the light edgings of their
crowns are definitely present; the areas of their backs are brownish, not more intensively
black, and their underparts are brownish, less blackish.

**Anas cyanoptera septentrionalium Snyder and Lumsden.--Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:15) listed
several localities along the Río Grande in Brewster County, Texas, where Cinnamon Teal were
seen. I suspect that Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:41) referred to those localities.

Mareca americana (Gmelin).--The American Widgeon is a fairly common spring migrant in Coahuila.
Dickerman saw five to seven American Widgeons 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos on May 18, 1954.

Spatula clypeata (Linnaeus).--The Shoveler is a spring and probably fall migrant in Coahuila,
and has been observed at several localities. Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:16) saw two pairs along
the Río Grande at Castalon, Texas, On May 7 and saw "a fair-sized flock along the Río Grande
on the Johnson ranch [in Texas] on May 13 and 14." Dickerman saw 12 pairs of Shovelers on two
ponds 14 mi. E and 16 mi. N Ocampo on May 9, 1954, and 10 more 8 mi. E and 2 mi. S Americanos
on May 18.
