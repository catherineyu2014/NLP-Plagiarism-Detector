CHAPTER I

"WHO SPEAKS?"

David Steel dropped his eyes from the mirror and shuddered as a man who sees his own soul bared
for the first time. And yet the mirror was in itself a thing of artistic beauty--engraved Florentine
glass in a frame of deep old Flemish oak. The novelist had purchased it in Bruges, and now
it stood as a joy and a thing of beauty against the full red wall over the fireplace. And Steel
had glanced at himself therein and seen murder in his eyes.

He dropped into a chair with a groan for his own helplessness. Men have done that kind of thing
before when the cartridges are all gone and the bayonets are twisted and broken and the brown
waves of the foe come snarling over the breastworks. And then they die doggedly with the stones
in their hands, and cursing the tardy supports that brought this black shame upon them.

But Steel's was ruin of another kind. The man was a fighter to his finger-tips. He had dogged
determination and splendid physical courage; he had gradually thrust his way into the front
rank of living novelists, though the taste of poverty was still bitter in his mouth. And how
good success was now that it had come!

People envied him. Well, that was all in the sweets of the victory. They praised his blue china,
they lingered before his Oriental dishes and the choice pictures on the panelled walls. The
whole thing was still a constant pleasure to Steel's artistic mind. The dark walls, the old
oak and silver, the red shades, and the high artistic fittings soothed him and pleased him,
and played upon his tender imagination. And behind there was a study, filled with books and
engravings, and beyond that again a conservatory, filled with the choicest blossoms. Steel
could work with the passion flowers above his head and the tender grace of the tropical ferns
about him, and he could reach his left hand for his telephone and call Fleet Street to his ear.
