No. 29] SATURDAY, MAY 18. The following paper, which was submitted to Mr. Carlyle for the second
or third edition of his work, contains all the references to the great Protector which are
to be found in the papers now in the possession of the trustees. The appointment of Oliver
Cromwell as a feoffee does not appear in any of the documents now remaining with the governors
of the charity. The records of the proceedings if the feoffees of his time consist only of
the collector's yearly accounts of monies received and expended, and do not show the appointments
of the feoffees. These accounts were laid before the feoffees from time to time, and signed
by them in testimony of their allowance.

Cromwell's name might therefore be expected to be found at the foot of some of them; but it
unfortunately happens that, from the year 1622 to the year 1641, there is an hiatus in the
accounts. At the end of Book No. 1., between forty and fifty leaves have been cut away, and
at the commencement of Book no. 2. about twelve leaves more. Whether some collector of curiosities
has purloined these leaves for the sale of any autographs of Cromwell contained in them, or
whether their removal may be accounted for by the questions which arose at the latter end of
the above period as to the application of the funds of the charity, cannot now be ascertained.

There are however, still in the possession of the governors of the charity, several documents
which clearly show that from the year 1635 to the year 1641 Cromwell was a feoffee or governor,
and took an active part in the management of the affairs of the charity. There is an original
bond, dated the 30th of May, 1638, from one Robert Newborne to "Daniell Wigmore, Archdeacon
of Ely, Oliver Cromwell, Esq., and the rest of the Corporation of Ely." The feoffees had then
been incorporated by royal charter, under the title of "The Governors of the Lands and Possessions
of the Poor of the City or Town of Ely."

There are some detached collectors' accounts extending over a portion of the interval between
1622 and 1641, and indorsed, "The Accoumpts of Mr. John Hand and Mr. William Cranford, Collectors
of the Revenewes belonging to the Towne of Ely."

The following entries are extracted from these accounts:--

  "The Disbursements of Mr. John Hand from the
  of August 1636 unto the      of
  1641."

  "Anno 1636."

After several other items,--

                                                 £  s.  d.
  "Given to diverse Poore People at ye     }
  Worke-house, in the presence of Mr.      }
  Archdeacon of Ely, Mr. Oliver Cromwell,  }    16  14   0
  Mr. John Goodericke, and others, Feb.    }
  10th 1636, as appeareth,                 }    

  Summa Expens. Ann. 1636                       36   3   6"

    "The Disbursements of Mr. Cranford."
  "Item, to Jones, by Mr. Cromwell's consent}    1   0   0"

Mr. Cranford's disbursements show no dates. His receipts immediately followed Mr. Hand's in
point of dates.

About the year 1639 a petition was filed in the Court of Chancery by one Thomas Fowler, on
behalf of himself and others, inhabitants of Ely, against the feoffees of Parson's Charity,
and a commission for charitable uses was issued. The commissioners sat at Ely, on the 25th
of January, 1641, and at Cambridge on the 3rd of March in the same year, when several of the
feoffees with other persons were examined.

At the conclusion of the joint deposition of John Hand and William Cranford, two of the feoffees,
is the following statement:--

    "And as to the Profitts of the said Lands in theire tyme
    receaved, they never disposed of any parte thereof but by the
    direction and appointment of Mr. Daniell Wigmore, Archdeacon
    of Ely, Mr. William March, and Mr. Oliver Cromwell."

    "These last two names were inserted att Camb. 8 Mar. 1641, by
    Mr. Hy. C."

The last name in the above note is illegible, and the last two names in the deposition are
of a different ink and handwriting from the preceding part, but of the same ink and writing
as the note.

An original summons to the feoffees, signed by the commissioners, is preserved. It requires
them to appear before the commissioners at the Dolphin Inn, in Ely, on the 25th of the then
instant January, to produce before the commissioners a true account "of the monies, fines,
rents, and profits by you and every of you and your predecessors feoffees receaved out of the
lands given by one Parsons for the benefitt of the inhabitants of Ely for 16 years past," &c.
The summons is dated at Cambridge, the 13th of January, 1641, and is signed by the three commissioners,

  "Tho. Symon.
  Tho. Duckett.
  Dudley Page."

The summons is addressed

  "To Matthew, Lord Bishop of Ely,
    Willm. Fuller, Deane of Ely, and to
    Daniell Wigmore, Archdeacon of Ely.
    William March, Esq.
    Anthony Page, Esq.
    Henry Gooderick, Gent.
    Oliver Cromwell, Esq.
    Willm. Anger.
    Willm. Cranford.
    John Hand, and
    Willm. Austen."

Whether Cromwell attended the sitting of the commissioners does not appear.

The letter from Cromwell to Mr. John Hand, published in Cromwell's Memoirs of Cromwell, has
not been in the possession of the feoffees for some years.

There is, however, an item in Mr. Hand's disbursements, which probably refers to the person
mentioned in that letter. It is as follows:--

                                             £  s. d.
  "Ffor phisicke and surgery for old Benson, 2  7  4"

Cromwell's letter appears to be at a later date than this item.

John Hand was a feoffee for many years, and during his time executed, as was usual, the office
of collector or treasurer. It may be gathered from the documents preserved that Cromwell never
executed that office. The office was usually taken by the feoffees in turn then, as at the
present time; but Cromwell most probably was called to a higher sphere of action before his
turn arrived.

It is worthy of note, that Cromwell's fellow-trustees, the Bishop of Ely (who was the celebrated
Matthew Wren), Fuller the Dean, and Wigmore the Archdeacon, were all severely handled during
the Rebellion.

DR. SAM. PARR AND DR. JOHN TAYLOR, OF SHREWSBURY AND SHREWSBURY SCHOOL.

Looking at the Index to the Memoirs of Gilbert Wakefield, edit. of 1804, I saw, under the letter
T., the following entries:--

  "Taylor, Rev. Dr. John, Tutor of Warrington Academy, i. 226.
  ---- his latinity, why faulty, ii. 449."

But I instantly suspected an error: for it was my belief that those two notices were designed
for two distinct scholars. Accordingly, I revised both passages, and found that I was right
in my conjecture. The facts are these:--In the former of the references, "The Rev. John Taylor,
D.D.," is pointed out. The other individual, of the same name, was John Taylor, LL.D., a native
of Shrewsbury, and a pupil of Shrewsbury School: HIS latinity it is which Dr. Samuel Parr [ut
supr.] characterises as FAULTY: and for the defects of which he endeavours, successfully or
otherwise, to account. So that whosoever framed the Index has here committed an oversight.

In the quotation which I proceed to make, Parr is assigning causes of what, as I think, he
truly deemed blemishes in G. Wakefield's Latin style; and this is the language of the not unfriendly
censor:--

    "--None, I fear, of his [W.'s] Latin productions are wholly
    free from faults, which he would have been taught to avoid
    in our best public seminaries, and of which I have seen many
    glaring instances in the works of Archbishop Potter, Dr. John
    Taylor, Mr. Toup, and several eminent scholars now living, who
    were brought up in private schools."

But could Parr mean to rank Shrewsbury School among the "private schools?" I am not old enough
to recollect what it was in the times of Taylor, J., the civilian, and the editor of Demosthenes.
Its celebrity, however, in our own day, and through a long term of preceding years, is confessed.
Dr. Parr's judgement in this case might be somewhat influenced by his prepossessions as an
Harrovian.

PROVINCIAL WORDS.

In Twelfth Night, Act ii. Scene 3., occur the words "Sneck up," in C. Knight's edition, or
"Snick up," Mr. Collier's edition. These words appear most unaccountably to have puzzled the
commentators. Sir Toby Belch uses them in reply to Malvolio, as,--

Enter MALVOLIO.

    "Mal. My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have you no
    wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this
    time of night? Do you make an alehouse of my lady's house,
    that you squeak out your cozier's catches without any
    mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place,
    person, nor time, in you?

    "Sir To. We did keep time, Sir, in our catches. Sneck up!"

"Sneck up," according to Mr. C. Knight, is explained thus:--

    "A passage in Taylor, the Water Poet, would show that this
    means 'hang yourself.' A verse from his 'Praise of Hempseed'
    is given in illustration."

"Snick up," according to Mr. Collier, is said to be "a term of contempt," of which the precise
meaning seems to have been lost. Various illustrations are given, as see his Note; but all
are wide of the meaning.

Turn to Halliwell's Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words, 2d edition, and there is this
explanation:--

    "SNECK, that part of the iron fastening of a door which is
    raised by moving the latch. To sneck a door, is to latch
    it."

These quotations will clearly show that "sneck" or "snick" applies to a door; and that to sneck
a door is to shut it. I think, therefore, that Sir Toby meant to say in the following reply:--

    "We did keep time, Sir, in our catches. Sneck up!"

That is, close up, shut up, or, as is said now, "bung up,"--emphatically, "We kept true time;"
and the probability is, that in saying this, Sir Toby would accompany the words with the action
of pushing an imaginary door; or sneck up.

In the country parts of Lancashire, and indeed throughout the North of England, and it appears
Scotland also, the term "sneck the door" is used indiscriminately with "shut the door" or "toin't
dur." And there can be little doubt but that this provincialism was known to Shakspeare, as
his works are full of such; many of which have either been passed over by his commentators,
or have been wrongly noted, as the one now under consideration.

Shakspeare was essentially a man of the people; his learning was from within, not from colleges
or schools, but from the universe and himself. He wrote the language of the people; that is,
the common every-day language of his time: and hence mere classical scholars have more than
once mistaken him, and most egregiously misinterpreted him, as I propose to show in some future
Notes.

May Marriages.--It so happened that yesterday I had both a Colonial Bishop and a Home Archdeacon
taking part in the services of my church, and visiting at my house; and, by a singular coincidence,
both had been solicited by friends to perform the marriage ceremony not later than to-morrow,
because in neither case would the bride-elect submit to be married in the month of May. I find
that it is a common notion amongst ladies, that May marriages are unlucky.

Can any one inform me whence this prejudice arose?

ALFRED GATTY.

Ecclesfield, April 29. 1850.

    [This superstition is as old as Ovid's time, who tells us in
    his Fasti,

      "Nec viduæ tædis eadem, nec virginis apta
        Tempora. Quæ nupsit non diuturna fuit.
      Hac quoque de causa (si te proverbia tangunt),
        Mense malas Maio nubere vulgus ait."

    The last line, as our readers may remember, (see ante, No.
    7. p. 97.), was fixed on the gates of Holyrood on the morning
    (16th of May) after the marriage of Mary Queen of Scots and
    Bothwell.]

Throwing Old Shoes at a Wedding.--At a wedding lately, the bridesmaids, after accompanying
the bride to the hall-door, threw into the carriage, on the departure of the newly-married
couple, a number of old shoes which they had concealed somewhere. On inquiry, I find this custom
is not uncommon; I should be glad to be favoured with any particulars respecting its origin
and meaning, and the antiquity of it.

Sir Thomas Boleyn's Spectre.--Sir Thomas Boleyn, the father of the unfortunate Queen of Henry
VIII., resided at Blickling, distant about fourteen miles from Norwich, and now the residence
of the dowager Lady Suffield. The spectre of this gentleman is believed by the vulgar to be
doomed, annually, on a certain night in the year, to drive, for a period of 1000 years, a coach
drawn by four headless horses, over a circuit of twelve bridges in that vicinity. These are
Aylsham, Burgh, Oxnead, Buxton, Coltishall, the two Meyton bridges, Wroxham, and four others
whose names I do not recollect. Sir Thomas carries his head under his arm, and flames issue
from his mouth. Few rustics are hardy enough to be found loitering on or near those bridges
on that night; and my informant averred, that he was himself on one occasion hailed by this
fiendish apparition, and asked to open a gate, but "he warn't sich a fool as to turn his head;
and well a' didn't, for Sir Thomas passed him full gallop like:" and he heard a voice which
told him that he (Sir Thomas) had no power to hurt such as turned a deaf ear to his requests,
but that had he stopped he would have carried him off.

This tradition I have repeatedly heard in this neighbourhood from aged persons when I was a
child, but I never found but one person who had ever actually seen the phantom. Perhaps some
of your correspondents can give some clue to this extraordinary sentence. The coach and four
horses is attached to another tradition I have heard in the west of Norfolk; where the ancestor
of a family is reported to drive his spectral team through the old walled-up gateway of his
now demolished mansion, on the anniversary of his death: and it is said that the bricks next
morning have ever been found loosened and fallen, though as constantly repaired. The particulars
of this I could easily procure by reference to a friend.

Shuck the Dog-fiend.--This phantom I have heard many persons in East Norfolk, and even Cambridgeshire,
describe as having seen as a black shaggy dog, with fiery eyes, and of immense size, and who
visits churchyards at midnight. One witness nearly fainted away at seeing it, and on bringing
his neighbours to see the place where he saw it, he found a large spot as if gunpowder had
been exploded there. A lane in the parish of Overstrand is called, after him, Shuck's Lane.
The name appears to be a corruption of "shag," as shucky is the Norfolk dialect for "shaggy."
Is not this a vestige of the German "Dog-fiend?"

QUERIES.

NUMISMATIC QUERIES.

Can any numismatical contributor give me any information as to the recurrence elsewhere, &c.,
of the following types of coins in my possession:--

1. A coin of the size of Roman 1 B., of the province of Macedonia Prima.--Obv. A female head,
with symbols behind, and a rich floriated edge: Rev. A club within an oaken garland: Legend
in the field, [Greek: MAKEDONÔN PRÔTÊS].

The type is illustrated by Dr. Horne, in his Introduction to the Study of the Bible, in explanation
of Acts, xvi. 11, 12. The specimen in my possession is in lead, finely struck, and therefore
not a cast, and in all respects equal in point of sharpness and execution to the silver of
the same size and type in the British Museum; and was dug up by a labourer at Chesterton, near
Cambridge. How is the metal of which my specimen is composed to be accounted for?

2. A 3 B. coin apparently by the portrait of Tiberius.--Legend defaced: Rev. The type known
by collectors as the altar of Lyons: Ex. (ROM)AE ET AV(G.)

3. A 3 B. of Herennia Estruscilla.--Rev. The usual seated figure of Pudicitia; and the Legend,
PVDICITIA AVG.

According to Col. Smyth, Akermann, and other authorities, no third brass of this empress exists;
but the specimen before me has been decided as undoubtedly genuine by many competent judges.

4. A 3 B. coin of the Emperor Macrinus, struck in some of the provinces.--Obv. A bearded portrait
of the emperor: Leg., AVT. K.M.O.C.C. MAKPINOC: Rev. An archaic S.C. in a laurel garland, above
L and beneath C. I am anxious to know to what locality I may ascribe this coin, as I have not
been able to find it described.

QUERIES PROPOSED, NO. 2.

When reflecting on my various pen-and-ink skirmishes, I have sometimes half-resolved to avoid
controversy. The resolution would have been unwise; for silence, on many occasions, would be
a dereliction of those duties which we owe to ourselves and the public.

The halcyon days, so much desired, may be far distant! I have to comment, elsewhere, on certain
parts of the Report of the commissioners on the British Museum--which I hope to do firmly,
yet respectfully; and on the evidence of Mr. Panizzi--in which task I must not disappoint his
just expectations. I have also to propose a query on the blunder of Malone--to which I give
precedence, as it relates to Shakspeare.

The query is--have I "mistaken the whole affair"? A few short paragraphs may enable others
to decide.

1. The question at issue arose, I presume to say, out of the statement of Mr. Jebb. I never
quoted the Irish edition. If C. can prove that Malone superintended it, he may fairly tax me
with a violation of my new canon of criticism--not otherwise. What says Mr. James Boswell on
that point? I must borrow his precise words: "The only edition for which Mr. Malone can be
considered as responsible [is] his own in 1790." [Plays and poems of W.S. 1821, i. xxxiii.]

2. I am said to have "repeated what C. had already stated."--I consulted the Shakspere of Malone,
and verified my recollections, when the query of "Mr. JEBB" appeared--but forbore to notice
its misconceptions. Besides, one C., after an interval of two months, merely asserted that
it was not a blunder of Malone; the other C. furnished, off-hand, his proofs and references.

3. To argue fairly, we must use the same words in the same sense. Now C. (No. 24. p. 386.)
asserts the Malone had never seen the introductory fragment; and asks, who forged it? He uses
the word fabrication in the sense of forgery.--The facts are produced (No. 25. p. 404.). He
is informed that the audacious fabrication, which took place before 1770, was first published
by Malone himself, in 1790--yet he expects me to apply the same terms to the blunder committed
by another editor in 1794.

4. As an answer to my assertion that the Irish editor attempted to unite the two fragments,
C. proceeds to prove that he did not unite them. The procedure is rather defective in point
of logical exactness. It proves only what was not denied. Malone refers to the will of John
Shakspere, found by Joseph Moseley, with sufficient clearness; and it is charitable to assume
that the Irish editor intended to observe the instructions of his precursor. He failed, it
seems--but why? It would be useless to go in search of the rationale of a blunder.

Have I "mistaken the whole affair"?--I entreat those readers of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" who
may take up the affirmative side of the question to point out my errors, whether as to facts
or inferences.

AUTHORS WHO HAVE PRIVATELY PRINTED THEIR OWN WORKS.

Can any of your readers refer me to any source whence I can obtain an account of "JOHN PAINTER,
B.A. of St. John's College, Oxford?" He appears to have been a very singular character, and
fond of printing (privately) his own lucubrations; to most of which he subscribes himself "The
King's Fool." Three of these privately printed tracts are now before me:--1. The Poor Man's
Honest Praises and Thanksgiving, 1746. 2. An Oxford Dream, in Two Parts, 1751. 3. A Scheme
designed for the Benefit of the Foundling Hospital, 1751.

Who was ROBERT DEVERELL, who privately printed, in 4to., Andalusia; or Notes tending to show
that the Yellow Fever was well known to the Ancients? The book seems a mass of absurdity; containing
illustrations of Milton's Comus, and several other subjects equally incongruous.

MINOR QUERIES.

Seager a Painter.--Marlow's Autograph.--In a MS., which has lately been placed in my hands,
containing a copy of Henry Howard's translation of the last instructions given by the Emperor
Charles V. to his son Philip, transcribed by Paul Thompson about the end of the sixteenth century,
are prefixed some poems in a different handwriting. The first of these is an eclogue, entitled
Amor Constans, in which the dialogue is carried on by "Dickye" and "Bonnybootes," and begins
thus:--"For shame, man, wilt thou never leave this sorrowe?" At the end is the signature, "Infortunatus,
Ch.M." Following this eclogue are sixteen sonnets, signed also "Ch.M.;" in two of which the
author alludes to a portrait painter named Seager. One of these sonnets commences thus:--

  "Whilest thou in breathinge cullers, crimson white,
    Drewst these bright eyes, whose language sayth to me.
    Loe! the right waye to heaven; Love stoode by the(e),
  Seager! fayne to be drawne in cullers brighte," &c.

Etymology of Totnes.--Can any of your readers suggest a probable etymology for Totnes, the
"prime town of Great Britain," as it is called by Westcote[1], who supposes it to have been
built by Brutus, 1108 years before the Christian era. Mr. Polwhele, who supposed the numerous
Hams in Devon to have owed their names to the worship of Jupiter Hammon, would, I imagine,
have derived Totnes from the Egyptian god Thoth or Taut; or, perhaps, directly from King Thothmes.
Westcote observes that some would have the name from,--

    "The French word tout-à-l'aise, which is in English, all at
    ease; as if Brutus at his arrival in such a pleasant soil ...
    should here assure himself and his fellow-travellers of
    ease, rest, and content; and the l, in this long time, is
    changed into n, and so from tout-à-lesse we now call it
    tout-à-nesse, and briefly Totnessse. This would I willingly
    applaud, could I think or believe that Brutus spake so good
    French, or that the French tongue was then spoken at all.
    Therefore, I shall with the more ease join in opinion with
    those who would have it named Dodonesse, which signifieth
    [in what language?] the rocky-town, or town on stones, which
    is also agreeable with the opinion of Leland."

Totnes is denominated Totenais and Totheneis in Domesday Book; and in other old records variously
spelt, Toteneis, Totteneys, Toteneys, Totton', Totteñ, Totenesse, Tottenesse, Tottonasse, Totonie,
&c. Never, Donodesse.

a very great favour to receive authentic reference to any articles contributed to Blackwood,
Fraser, &c., &c., by Dr. Maginn. The difficulty of determining authorship from internal evidence
alone is well-known, and is aptly illustrated by the fact, that an article on Miss Austen's

The Camp in Bulstrode Park.--Is there any published account of this camp having been opened?
It is well worth the examination of a competent antiquary.... It is not even alluded to in
Mr. Jesse's Favourite Haunts, nor does that gentleman appear to have visited the interesting
village of "Hedgerley" (anciently Hugely), or Jordans, the Quakers' Meeting-house, and burial-place
of Penn, between Beaconsfield and Chalfont. Chalfont was anciently written Chalfhunt, and is
by the natives still called Charffunt; and Hunt is a very common surname in this parish: there
was, however, Tobias Chalfont, Rector of Giston, who died 1631. "Chal" appears to be a common
prefix. In Chalfont (St. Peter's) is an inscription to Sir Robert Hamson, Vycar, alluded to

prior to the church having been beautified in 1822, was suspended on an iron bracket with a
bit of rag, as it then looked, to the best of my memory. I have heard that it belonged to the
family of Gould of Oak End, extinct.

REPLIES.

DR. PERCY AND THE POEMS OF THE EARL OF SURREY.

I have the means of showing what Dr. Percy did with the poems of the Earl of Surrey, because
I have a copy of the work now before me. Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum. 1557. The Bishop
of Dromere made no attempt at editing the work much beyond what was necessary to secure an
exact reimpression. He prefixed no Life of Surrey (a point "G." wishes to ascertain); and,
in fact, the book was never completed. It contains considerably more than the reprint of the
poems of Lord Surrey, and was intended to consist of two volumes with separate pagination;
the first volume extending to p. 272., and the second to p. 342.

As the work is a rarity, owing to an unfortunate accident, some of your readers may like to
see a brief notice of it. Watts (as quoted by "G." for I have not his portly volumes at hand,)
states that the "whole impression" was "consumed in the fire which took place in Mr. Nicholls's
premises in 1808." This was a mistake, as my extant copy establishes; and Restituta (iii. 451.)
informs us that four were saved. Of the history of my own impression I know nothing beyond
the fact, that I paid a very high price for it some twenty years since, at an auction; but
the late Mr. Grenville had another copy, which I had an opportunity of seeing, and which had
belonged to T. Park, and had been sent to him by Dr. Percy for the advantage of his notes and
remarks. This, I presume, is now in the British Museum; whither it came with the rest of Mr.
Grenville's books, four or five years ago.

The "Songs and Sonnets" of Surrey occupy only the first forty pages of vol. i.; then follow
"Songs and sonnets" by Sir Thomas Wyat to p. 111. inclusive; and they are succeeded by poems
"of uncertain authors," which occupy the rest of the the first volume. The second volume begins
with "The Seconde Boke of Virgiles Ænæis," filling thirty pages; while "the Fourth Boke" ends
at p. 57., with the imprint of R. Tottell, and the date of 1557. "Ecclesiastes and Certain
Psalms by by Henry Earl of Surrey," which are "from ancient MSS. never before imprinted," close
at p. 81. "Certayne Psalmes chosen out of the Psalter of David," consisting of the seven penitential
psalms, with the imprint of Thomas Raynald and John Harrington," fill thirty pages; and to
them is added "Sir Thomas Wyat's Defence," from the Strawberry Hill edition; which, with a
few appended notes, carries the work on to p. 141.

A new title-page, at which we now arrive, shows us the intention of Dr. Percy, and the object
at which he had all along aimed: it runs thus:--"Poems in Bland Verse (not Dramatique) prior
to Milton's Paradise Lost. Subsequent to Lord Surrey's in this Volume, and to N.G.'s in the
preceding." In truth, Dr. Percy was making a collection in the two volumes of all the English
undramatic blank verse he could discover, prior to the publication of Milton's great poem.
He was guilty of some important omissions, because bibliographical knowledge was not then as
far advanced as at present, but he performed good service to letters as far as he was able
to go; and the blank verse productions he subjoins are by George Tubervile, George Gascoigne,
Barnabie Riche, George Peele, James Aske, William Vallans, Nicholas Breton, George Chapman,
and Christopher Marlow. These occupy from p. 342. of vol. ii.

This list might now be considerably increased; but my present business is only to answer the
Query of "G.," as to the nature and contents of the work. It has been said, I know not on what
authority, that Steevens assisted Percy in preparing and printing it. I apprehend that the
aid given by Steevens consisted solely in recommending the Bishop to procure certain rare productions
which would contribute to the purpose.

    [To this we may add, that about 1767, when Bishop Percy
    printed these twenty-five sheets of poems of Lord Surrey and
    the Duke of Buckingham, it appears by a letter of the Bishop
    to Horace Walpole, that he presented a copy of them to
    Walpole, with a request for information about Lord Surrey. The
    Bishop never wrote the Life of Surrey; and in 1808 the whole
    impression was burnt, with the exception of a copy or two that
    the Bishop had given to his friends. In the letter to Walpole
    the Bishop says, "A few more leaves will complete that book,
    which with the second and Dr. Surrey's Songs and Sonnets, &c.
    will be sufficient for the book."]

SYMBOLS OF THE FOUR EVANGELISTS.

Horne, in his Introduction, vol. iv. p. 254., says that Irenæus was the first to discover the
analogy between the four animals mentioned by Ezekiel (i. 5. 10.) and the four Evangelists,
which gave rise to the well-known paintings of these latter. He quotes from Iren. adv. Hoer.
lib. iii. cap. 11.:--

    "The first living creature, which is like a lion, signifies
    Christ's efficacy, principality, and regality, viz. John; the
    second, like a calf, denotes His sacerdotal order, viz. Luke;
    the third, having as it were, a man's face, describes His
    coming in the flesh as man, viz. Matthew; and the fourth, like
    a flying eagle, manifests the grace of the Spirit flying into
    the Church, viz. Mark."
There is also an interesting passage in Dionys Carthus. in Apocal.
Enarr. iv. 7., from which the following is an extract:--

    "Although the above exposition of Gregorius, in which by the
    man in meant Matthew, by the calf Luke, &c., be the common
    one, yet other holy men have held a different opinion, for as
    Bede relates on this point, Augustine understood by the lion
    Matthew, because in the beginning of his Gospel he describes
    the royal descent of Christ; by the calf he also understood
    Luke, because he wrote of the priestly descent of Our Lord;
    by the man Mark, because he omits the question of Christ's
    birth, and confines himself more especially to describing
    His acts as a man; by the eagle, all understand John, on
    account of the sublimity to which his Gospel soars. Others
    again understand by the lion Matthew; by the calf Mark,
    on account of the simplicity of his style; and by the man
    Luke, because he has more fully treated of Christ's human
    generation."

Would "JARLZBERG" kindly favour me with a reference to his interesting anecdote of the lion's
whelps?

Your correspondent "JARLZBERG" (No. 24. p. 385.) inquires for the origin of the Evangelistic
symbols. The four living creatures, in Ezekiel, i. 10., and Revelations, iv. 7., were interpreted
from the earliest times to represent the four Gospels. Why the angel is attributed to St. Matthew,
the lion to St. Mark, and so on, is another question: but their order in Ezekiel corresponds
with the order of the Gospels as we have them. Durandus would probably furnish some information.
The fabulous legend of the lion savours of a later origin. Some valuable remarks on the subject,
and a list of references to early writers, will be found in Dr. Wordsworth's Lectures on the
Canon of Scripture (Lect. VI. p. 151.), and his Lectures on the Apocalypse (Lect. IV. pp. 116,
117.)

COMPLEXION.

Complexion is usually (and I think universally) employed to express the tint of the skin; and
the hair and eyes are spoken of separately when the occasion demands a specific reference to
them. "NEMO" (No. 22. p. 352.), moreover, seems to confound the terms "white" and "fair," between
the meanings of which there is considerable difference. A white skin is not fair, nor a fair
skin white. There is no close approach of one to the other; and indeed we never see a white
complexion, except the chalked faces in a Christmas of Easter Pantomime, or in front of Richardson's
booth at Greenwich or Charlton Fair. A contemplation of these would tell us what the "human
face divine" would become, were we any of us truly white-skinned.

The skin diverges in tint from the white, in one direction towards the yellow, and in another
towards the red or pink; whilst sometimes we witness a seeming tinge of blue,--characteristic
of asphyxia, cholera, or some other disease. We often see a mixture of red and yellow (the
yellow predominating) in persons subject to bilious complaints; and not unfrequently a mixture
of all three, forming what the painters call a "neutral tint," and which is more commonly called
"an olive complexion."

The negro skin is black; that is, it does not separate the sun's light into the elementary
colours. When, by the admixture of the coloured races with the negro, we find coloured skins,
they always tend to the yellow, as in the various mulatto shades of the West Indies, and especially
in the Southern States of America; and the same is true of the "half-castes" of British India,
though with a distinct darkness or blackness, which the descendant of the negro does not generally
show.

Though I have, in accordance with the usual language of philosophers, spoken of blue as an
element in the colour of the skin, I have some doubt whether it be a "true blue" or not. It
is quite as likely to arise from a partial participation in the quality of the negro skin--that
of absorbing a large portion of the light without any analysis whatever. This may be called
darkness.

However, to return to the Query: the term pale is applied to the yellow-tinted skin; fair,
to the red or pink; brown, to the mixture of red and yellow, with either blue or such darkness
as above described; sallow, to yellow and darkness; and the only close approach to whiteness
that we ever see, is in the sick room of the long-suffering fair complexion. In death, this
changes to a "blackish grey," a mixture of white and darkness.

The pale complexion indicates a thick, hard, dry skin; the fair, a thin and soft one; and all
the shades of dark skin render a large amount of ablution essential to health, comfort, or
agreeableness to others. If any of your readers should feel curious about the characters of
the wearers of these several skins, they must inquire of Lavater and his disciples.

BALLAD OF DICK AND THE DEVIL.

Looking over some of your back numbers, I find (No. 11. p. 172.) an inquiry concerning a ballad
with this title. I have never met with it in print, but remember some lines picked up in nursery
days from an old nurse who was a native of "the dales." These I think have probably formed
a part of this composition. The woman's name was curiously enough Martha Kendal; and, in all
probability, her forebears had migrated from that place into Yorkshire:--

  "Robin a devil he sware a vow.
    He swore by the sticks[2] in hell--
  By the yelding that crackles to mak the low[3],
    That warms his namsack[4] weel.

  "He leaped on his beast, and he rode with heaste,
    To mak his black oath good;
  'Twas the Lord's Day, and the folk did pray
    And the priest in cancel stood.

  "The door was wide, and in does he ride,
    In his clanking gear so gay;
  A long keen brand he held in his hand,
    Our Dickon for to slay.

  "But Dickon goodhap he was not there,
    And Robin he rode in vain,
  And the men got up that were kneeling in prayer,
    To take him by might and main.

  "Rob swung his sword, his steed he spurred,
    He plunged right through the thrang.
  But the stout smith Jock, with his old mother's crutch[5],
    He gave him a woundy bang.

  "So hard he smote the iron pot,
    It came down plume and all;
  Then with bare head away Robin sped,
    And himself was fit to fall.

  "Robin a devil he way'd[6] him home,
    And if for his foes he seek,
  I think that again he will not come
    To late[7] them in Kendal kirk."[8]

Y.A.C.

    [2] The unlettered bard has probably confused "styx" with the
    kindling, "yelding," of hell-fire.

    [3] Flame.

    [4] I have often wondered what namsac (so pronounced) could
    be, but since I have seen the story as told by "H.J.M." it is
    evidently "namesake."

    [5] Probably crook in the original, to rhyme with Jock.

    [6] "I way'd me" is yet used in parts of Yorkshire for "I went."

    [7] "To late" is "to seek;" from lateo, as if by a confusion
    of hiding and seeking.]

    [8] "Kirk" is not a very good rhyme to "seek;" perhaps it should
    be "search" and "church".]

REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.

Cavell.--In the time of Charles I., a large tract of land lying south-eastward of Doncaster,
called Hatfield Chace, was undertaken to be drained and made fit for tillage and pasture by
one Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, a celebrated Flemish engineer of that day, and his partners, or
"participants," in the scheme, all or most of them Dutchmen. The lands drained were said to
be "cavelled and allotted" to so and so, and the pieces of land were called "cavells." They
were "scottled," or made subject to a tax or assessment for drainage purposes. Two eminent
topographical writers of the present day are inclined to be of opinion that this word cavell
is connected with the Saxon gafol, gavel-tributum--money paid--which we have in gavel-kind
and gavelage. One of them, however, suggests that the word may be only a term used in Holland
as applicable to land, and then introduced by the Dutch at the time of the drainage in question.
I shall be obliged if any of your readers can inform me if the word "cavell" is so used in
Holland, or elsewhere, either as denoting any particular quantity of land, or land laid under
any tax, or tributum, or otherwise.

    [Our correspondent will find, on referring to Kilian's
    Dictionarium Teutonico-Latino-Gallicum, that the word
    Kavel is used for sors, "sors in divisione bonorum:" and
    among other definitions of the verb Kavelen, "sorte dividere
    terram," which corresponds exactly with his cavelled and
    allotted.]

Pimlico (No. 24. p. 383.).--The derivation of this word is explained from the following passage

    "Have at thee, then, my merrie boyes, and hey for old Ben
    Pimlico's nut-browne."

Pimlico kept a place of entertainment in or near Hoxton, and was celebrated for his nut-brown
ale. The place seems afterwards to have been called by his name, and is constantly mentioned
by our early dramatists. In 1609 a tract was printed, entitled Pimlyco, or Runne Red Cap, 'tis
a Mad World at Hogsdon. Isaac Reed (Dodsley's Old Plays, ed. Collier, vii. 51.) says,--

    "A place near Chelsea is still called Pimlico, and was
    resorted to within these few years, on the same account as the
    former at Hogsdon."

Pimlico is still, I believe, celebrated for its fine ale.

    Pemlicoe, Dublin." (Earl of Orrery to Duke of Ormond, Feb.
    5. 1663, in Orrery's State Letters.)

This may be of use to "R.H.," who inquires about the origin of Pimlico. Ranelaugh, in the same
parts, is doubtless also of Irish origin.

bive lambs on the borders of Sussex and Kent; and chute lambs are fat lambs.

Chuet is an old word signifying a fat greasy pudding. It is rightly applied to Falstaff:--

Le Petit Albert (No. 24. p. 385.).--I suspect this Petit Albert, in 32mo.--a size in harmony
with the cognomen--is only a catchpenny publication, to which the title of Le Petit Albert
has been given by way of resembling its name to that of Albertus Magnus, who wrote a work or
works of a character which gave rise, in the middle ages, to the accusation that he practised
magical arts; and hence, probably, any abridgement or compendium of them, or any little work
on such arts, would be styled by the French compiler Le Petit Albert. In the Biographie Universelle,
it is affirmed that the rhapsodies known under the name of Secrets du Petit Albert are not
by Albertus Magnus; a statement which favours the belief that the work mentioned by your correspondent
"JARLZBERG" is one of that vulgar class (like our old Moore's Almanack, &c.) got up for sale
among the superstitious and the ignorant, and palmed on the world under the mask of a celebrated
name. According to Bayle, Albertus Magnus has, by some, been termed Le Petit Albert, owing,
it is said, to the diminutiveness of his stature, which was on so small a scale, that when
he, on one occasion, paid his respects to the pope, the pontiff supposed he was still kneeling
at his feet after he had risen up and was standing erect.

Emancipation of the Jews (No. 25. p. 491.).--"H.M.A." inquires--1. If the story mentioned in
the Thurloe State Papers, that the Jews sought to obtain St. Paul's Cathedral for a Synagogue,
has been confirmed by other writers? In Egan's Status of the Jews in England, I find the following
passage:--

    "Monteith informs us, that during the Commonwealth, overtures
    were made on behalf of the Hebrews to the Parliament and
    Council of War, through the medium of two popular adherents
    of the parliamentarians; the Jews offered to pay for the
    privileges then sought by them, the sum of 500,000l.; several
    debates took place on the subject, but the ultimatum of the
    Puritans being 800,000l., the negotiation was broken off."

The authorities cited on this point by the learned writer are, Monteith's History of Great
Britain, p. 473.; and Thurloe's State Papers, vol. ii. p. 652.

On reference to Monteith, I find the following passage:--

    "What is very remarkable in this is, that the Jews, who
    crucified the Son of God, by whom Kings reign, took then
    occasion of the conjuncture which seemed favourable to them.
    They presented a petition to the Council of War, who crucified
    Him again in the person of the King, His Vicegerent in the
    kingdoms over which God had set him. By their petition, they
    requested that the act of their banishment might be repealed
    and that they might have St. Paul's Church for their
    synagogue, for which, and the library of Oxford, wherewith
    they desired to begin their traffic again, they offered five
    hundred thousand pounds, but the Council of War would have
    eight."--Monteiths's Hist. of the Troubles of Great Britain,
    p. 473.

I conclude that the author of the Status of the Jews, by omitting to notice the alleged desire
of the Jews to obtain St. Paul's Cathedral, considered that the acrimonious statements of Monteith
were not borne out by accredited or unprejudiced authorities; for it is but justice to state,
it has been admitted by some of our most eminent critics, that Mr. Egan's book on the Jews
displays as dispassionate and impartial a review of their condition in this country as it evinces
a profundity of historical and legal research.

"H.M.A.'s" second question I am unable to answer, not being sufficiently versed in the religious
dogmas of the Jews.

As lazy as Ludlum's Dog (No. 24. p. 382.).--This proverb is repeated somewhat differently in
The Doctor, &c., "As lazy as Ludlum's dog, as leaned his head against a wall to bark." I venture
to suggest that this is simply one of the large class of alliterative proverbs so common in
every language, and often without meaning. In Devonshire they say as "Busy as Batty," but no
one knows who "Batty" was. As I have mentioned The Doctor, &c., I may was well jot down two
more odd sayings from the same old curiosity-shop:--"As proud as old COLE's dog which took

"Esquire" and "Gentleman."--The amusing article in No. 27., on the title of "Esquire," recalled
to my memory the resolution passed by the corporation of Stratford-on-Avon, when they presented
the freedom of that town to Garrick. It runs something like this:--

    "Through love and regard to the memory of the immortal
    Mr. William Shakspeare, and being fully sensible of the
    extraordinary merits of his most judicious representative,
    David Garrick, Esquire."

Had David a better right to the title than the great poet? Shakespeare, in the latter part
of his life, was no doubt Master Shakspeare, a title so common as even to be bestowed upon
the geometer of Alexandria. In Bayford's collection is preserved a Catalogue advertising "Master
Euclid's Elements of Plain Geometry."

Pope Felix and Pope Gregory.--"E.M.B." (No. 26. p. 415.) inquires who was "Pope Felix," whom
Ælfric called the "fifth father" of S. Gregory the Great? This is a much disputed question,
and a great deal depends upon the meaning to be attached to the unsatisfactory expression "atavus,"
used by Pope Gregory himself, in Evangel. Hom. xxxviii. § 15., and found also in the dialogues
commonly attributed to him. (Lib. iv. cap. xvi.) Your correspondent may consult Beda, Hist.
Eccl. Gen. Anglor., lib. ii. cap. 1., with the note by Mr. Stevenson, who supposes that Pope
Felix III. was alluded to by his "venerable" author: This is the opinion of Bollandus (ad 25
Feb.), as well as of Cardinal Baronius; (Annall. ad an. 581; et Martyrol. Rom. die Feb. 25.
Conf. De Aste, in Martyrolog. Disceptat., p. 96.; Beneventi, 1716); but Joannes Diaconus (S.
Greg. Vit. lib. i. cap. i.) employs these decisive terms, "quartus Felix, sedis Apostolicæ
Pontifex." It is of course possible to translate "atavus meus" merely "my ancestor;" and this
will leave the relationship sufficiently undefined.

Dayrolles (No. 23. p. 373).--The following information is appended to a description of the
Dayrolles Correspondence, in 21 folio vols. in the Catalogue of Mr. Upcott's Collection, sold
by Messrs. Evans a few years ago:--

Note copied from the Catalogue of Manuscripts, &c., belonging to the late Mr. Upcott.

"James Dayrolles was resident at the Hague from 1717 to his death, 2nd January, 1739.

"Solomon Dayrolles, his nephew, commenced his diplomatic career under James, first Earl of
Waldegrave, when that nobleman was ambassador at Vienna. He was godson of Philip, the distinguished
Earl of Chesterfield, and was sworn a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to George II., 27th Feb.
1740, in the room of Sir Philip Parker, long deceased, and on the accession of George III.
was again appointed, 5th February, 1761.

"In 1745, being at that time secretary to Lord Chesterfield, in Holland, Mr. Dayrolles was
nominated to be secretary to his lordship at Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

"In May, 1747, he was promoted to be President in the United Provinces; and in November, 1751,
Resident at Brussels, where he continued till August, 1757. He died in March, 1786."

veins), in commemoration of being delivered from plagues, of which such states of disease were
concomitant signs.

"M. or N." (No. 26. p. 415.)--I do not think that "M. or N." are used as the initials of any
particular words; they are the middle letters of the alphabet, and, at the time the Prayer
Book was compiled, it seems to have been the fashion to employ them in the way in which we
now use the first two. There are only two offices, the Catechism and the Solemnisation of Matrimony,
in which more than one letter is used. In the former, the answer to the first question has
always stood "N. or M." In the office of Matrimony, however, in Edward the Sixth's Prayer Books,
both the man and woman are designated by the letter N--"I, N., take thee, N., to my wedded
wife;" whilst in our present book M. is applied to the man and N. to the woman. The adoption
of one letter, and the subsequent substitution of another, in this service, evidently for the
sake of a more clear distinction only, sufficiently shows that no particular name or word was
intended by either. Possibly some future "J.C." may inquire of what words the letters "A.B.,"
which our legislators are so fond of using in their Acts of Parliament, are the initials.

Sapcote Motto (No. 23. p. 366.).--This motto is known to be French, and as far as it can be
decyphered is--

  "sco toot X vinic [or umic]
  X pones,"

the first and last letters s being possibly flourishes. This certainly seems unpromising enough.
The name being Sapcote, quasi Sub-cote, and the arms "three dove-cotes," I venture to conjecture
"Sous cote unissons," as not very far from the letters given. If it be objected that the word
"cote" is not in use in this sense, it may be remarked that French, "After the scole of Stratford
atte bowe," might borrow such a meaning to suit the sound, from "côte," in the sense of a side
or declivity. And if the objection is fatal to the conjecture, I would then propose "Sous toit
unissons." If we reject the supposed flourishes at the beginning and ending of the inscription,
and take it to be--

  CO TOOT VNIC
      CONC,

the c being a well-known ancient form of s, there is a difference of only one letter between
the inscription as decyphered and the proposed motto.

If either of these is adopted, the sentiment of family union and family gathering, "As doves
to their windows," is well adapted for a family device.

Finkle or Finkel (No. 24. p. 384.).--Is not "Finkle" very probably derived from Finc, a finch,
in the A.-S.? Fingle Bridge, which spans the river Teign, amidst some most romantic scenery,
has the following etymology assigned to it by a local antiquary, W.T.P. Short, Esq. (vide Essay
on Druidical Remains in Devon, p. 26.): "Fyn, a terminus or boundary; and Gelli, hazel, the
hazeltree limits or boundary." But, Query, is not the second syllable rather Gill, akin to
the numerous tribe of "gills" or "ghylls," in the North Countrie?

Meaning of Finkle.--Referring to No. 24. p. 384. of your most welcome and useful publication,
will you allow me to say, touching the inquiry as to the derivation and meaning of the word
"Finkle" or "Finkel" as applied to a street, that the Danish word "Vincle" applied to an angle
or corner, is perhaps a more satisfactory derivation than "fynkylsede, feniculum," the meaning
suggested by your correspondent "L." in No. 26. p. 419. It is in towns where there are traces
of Danish occupation that a "Finkle Street" is found; at least many of the northern towns which
have a street so designated were inhabited by the Danish people, and some of those streets
are winding or angular. Finchale, a place, as you know, of fame in monastic annals, is a green
secluded spot, half insulated by a bend of the river Wear; and Godric's Garth, the adjacent
locality of the hermitage of its famous saint, is of an angular form. But then the place is
mentioned, by the name of Finchale, as the scene of occurrences that long preceded the coming
of the Danes; and the second syllable may be derived from the Saxon "alh" or "healh," as the
place was distinguished for a building there in Saxon times.

Ecclesiastical Year (No. 24. p. 381.).--"NATHAN" is informed, that, according to the legal
supputation, until A.D. 1752, the year of Our Lord in that part of Great Britain called England,
began on the 25th day of March, as he will find stated in the 24 Geo. II. c. 23., by which
Act it was enacted, that the 1st day of January next following the last day of December, 1751,
should be the first day of the year 1752; and that the 1st day of January in every year in
time to come should be the first day of the year.

Philippe de Thaun, in his Livre des Créatures, which was written in the first half of the twelfth
century, p. 48. of the edition published for the Historical Society of Science, has some remarks
which may interest your correspondent, that are thus literally translated by Mr. Wright:--

  "In March, the year ought always to begin,
  According to that explanation which we find in the book,
  That in the twelve kalends of April, as your understand,
  Our Creator formed the first,
  Where the sun always will begin his course,
  But at all times we make the year begin in January,
  Because the Romans did so first;
  We will not un-make what the elders did."

Hanap.--Among the specimens of ancient and mediæval art now exhibiting in John Street, Adelphi,
I was struck with the number of gilt cups, called in the catalogue hanaps. The word was new
to me; but I have since met with it (as frequently happens after one's interest has been excited
with respect to a word) in Walter Scott's Quentin Durward, in vol. i. chap. 3.; or rather,
vol. xxxi. p. 60. of the edition in 48 vols., Cadell, 1831; in which place the context of the
scene appears to connect the idea of hanap with a cup containing treasure.

Now I cannot find hanap in any dictionary to which I have access; but I find hanaper in every
one. Johnson, and others, give the word Hanaper as synonymous with treasury or exchequer. They
also contract Hanaper into Hamper. For example, in Dyche's English Dictionary, 17th ed. Lond.
1794, we have,--

    "Hamper, or Hanaper, a wicker basket made with a cover to
    fasten it up with; also, an office in Chancery; the clerk or
    warden of the Hanaper receives all monies due to the king
    for seals of charters, &c.... and takes into his custody all
    sealed charters, patents, &c.,... which he now puts into bags,
    but anciently, it is supposed, into Hampers, which gave the
    denomination to the office."

And perhaps it may be remarked here, since we commonly say of a man in difficulties that he
is "exchequered" or in "chancery," that so we probably intend to express the same, when we
say a man is hanapered, or hampered.

Thus, there is no difficulty about the meaning of Hanaper; and its connection with treasure
is plain and clear enough: and, with respect to cups, though chiefly used for drinking, the
presentation of them with sums of money in them has ever been, and indeed is, so very customary,
that it is needless to occupy space here with instances. But I cannot distinctly connect the
hanap of the exhibition with hanaper: and I perhaps ought to look in another direction for
its true signification and etymology.

ROBERT SNOW.

    are referred to Halliwell's Archaic Dictionary, where they
    will find "HANAP, a cup. Test. Vet. p. 99.;" to Ducange,

Life of W. Godwin.--"N.'s" inquiry (No. 26. p. 415.) for an account of the life of W. Godwin,

memoirs of Godwin, which were announced for publication shortly after his death, but which
family disputes, as I have understood, prevented from appearing, may not much longer be denied

Charles II. and Lord R.'s Daughter.--Earl of Ranelagh.--Since I inquired in your columns (No.
25. p. 399.) who was the lady mentioned in a passage of Henry Sidney's Diary, edited by Mr.
Blencowe, as Lord R.'s daughter, and a new mistress of Charles II., who in March 1680 brought
Monmouth to the King for reconciliation, I have, by Mr. Blencowe's kindness, seen the original
Diary, which is in the possession of the Earl of Chichester. The name of the nobleman is there
abbreviated: the letters appear to be Rane., and it is probably Lord Ranelagh who is intended.
I do not remember any other notice of this amour of Charles II., and should be glad to be referred
to any other information on the subject. Charles II.'s mistresses are political characters;
and in this notice of Lord R.'s daughter, we find her meddling in state affairs.

I do not know whether this lady, if indeed a daughter of a Lord Ranelagh, would be the daughter
or sister of the Lord Ranelagh living in 1680, who was the first Earl of Ranelagh and third
Viscount, and who is described by Burnet as a very able and very dissolute man, and a great
favourite of Charles II. (Hist. of his own Time, i. 462., ii. 99., ed. 1823); and who, having
held the office of Vice-Treasurer in Ireland during three reigns, was turned out of it in disgrace
in 1703. He died in 1711, leaving no son, but three daughters, one of whom was unmarried; he
was the last, as well as first, Earl of Ranelagh. The elder title of Viscount went to a cousin,
and still exists.

Runes.--Worsäae (Primeval Antiquities of Denmark, 1849) mentions that inscriptions are found
in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, written in different languages in Runic character. He also
mentions the fact of a Pagan Runic inscription occurring at Jellinge, Denmark, on the tomb
of old King Gorm, A.D. c. 900, found in a huge barrow; and, at the same place, a Christian
Runic inscription on the tomb of his son Harold. Has this inquiry been extended to British
Runes, and might it not throw much light upon many monuments of dates prior to the Conquest?
Crossed slabs with Runes have been found at Hartlepool, Durham; have the inscriptions been
read? (Boutell's Christian Monuments, p. 3.; Cutt's Manual of Sepulchral Slabs, pp. 52. 60.

NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.

The Nibelungenlied, which has been aptly designated the German Iliad, has hitherto been a sealed
book to the mere English reader. Mr. Lettsom has however just published a most successful translation
of it under the title of The Fall of the Nibelungers. Few will rise from a perusal of the English
version of this great national epic--which in its present form is a work of the thirteenth
century--without being struck with the innate power and character of the original poem; and
without feeling grateful to Mr. Lettsom for furnishing them with so pleasing and spirited a
version of it.

Captain Curling, Clerk of the Cheque of what was formerly designated the Band of Gentleman
Pensioners, has, under the influence of a laudable esprit de corps, combined the disjointed
materials which Pegge had collected upon the subject with the fruits of his own researches;
and, under the title of Some Account of the Ancient Corp of Gentlemen-at-Arms, has produced
a volume of great interest doubtless to his "brothers in arms," and containing some curious
illustrations of court ceremonial.[9]

Mr. Timbs, the editor of The Year-Book of Facts, &c., announces for early publication a work
on which he has been engaged for some time, entitled Curiosities of London. It will, we believe,
be altogether of a different character from Mr. Cunningham's Handbook, and treat rather of
present London and its amusements than those of historical and literary associations which
give a charm to Mr. Cunningham's volume.

We are glad to find that the most mysterious and mystified portion of the Greek Geometry is
likely to receive at last a complete elucidation--we mean the "Porisms." There are so many
questions arising out of this subject, respecting the development of the Grecian intellect,
that a full discussion of them is no easy task; especially of those arising out of the conflicting
testimonies furnished by history, and by the internal evidences contained in the existing works
of the "fathers of Geometry." We certainly anticipate, from the known character of the minds
now engaged in this work, that some conclusive evidence as to the state of geometry anterior
to the time of Euclid will be elicited by Messrs. Potts and Davies. The analysis of the writings
of all the authors who have treated on the Porism, will form a subject of interest not only
for its assigning to every author his fair share of credit for his contributions towards perfecting
the poristic method; but for that critical discrimination of principles, which constitutes
one of the marked features of Mr. Davies's writings in the archæology of geometry. We shall
be glad if his slight notice of the intended work shall bring some accession of aid to the
undertaking in the form of subscriptions: as upon adequate support, it appears, must depend
whether the work shall go to press, or the project be abandoned.

We have received the following Catalogues:--Thomas Thorpe's (13. Henrietta Street) General

EDUCATION, SCIENCE, AND GENERAL LITERATURE.

The object of these two Catalogues is, to convey a more satisfactory notion of the contents
of the books in them, than can be drawn from reading the titles. Instead of laudatory extracts
from reviews, general notices are given of the chief subjects and most prominent peculiarities
of the books. The Catalogues are designed to put the reader, as far as possible, in the same
position as if he had inspected for himself, at least cursorily, the works described; and,
with this view, care has been taken, in drawing up the notices, merely to state facts, with
but little comment, and no exaggeration whatever. 1850.
