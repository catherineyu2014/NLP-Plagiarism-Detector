Hippolytus (26) was honoured by our lady Artemis and with her conversed, (27) and in his latter
end, by reason of his sobriety and holiness, was reckoned among the blest.

Palamedes (28) all his days on earth far outshone those of his own times in wisdom, and when
slain unjustly, won from heaven a vengeance such as no other mortal man may boast of. (29)
Yet died he not at their hands (30) whom some suppose; else how could the one of them have
been accounted all but best, and the other a compeer of the good? No, not they, but base men
wrought that deed.

 (28) As to Palamedes, son of Nauplius, his genius and treacherous
    death, see Grote, "H. G." i. 400; "Mem." IV. ii. 33; "Apol." 26;

    somewhat in Xenophon's manner.) See "Mem." IV. ii. 33; "Apol." 26.

Menestheus, (31) through diligence and patient care, the outcome of the chase, so far overshot
all men in love of toil that even the chiefs of Hellas must confess themselves inferior in
the concerns of war save Nestor only; and Nestor, it is said, (32) excelled not but alone might
rival him.

 (31) For Menestheus, who led the Athenians against Troy, cf. Hom.
    "Il." ii. 552; iv. 327; Philostr. "Her." ii. 16; Paus. ii. 25. 6;
    i. 17. 6; Plut. "Thes." 32, 35.

 (32) Or, "so runs the tale," e.g. in "The Catalogue." See "Il." ii.
    l.c.: {Nestor oios erizen}, "Only Nestor rivalled him, for he was
    the elder by birth" (W. Leaf).

Odysseus and Diomedes (33) were brilliant for many a single deed of arms, and mainly to these
two was due the taking of Troy town. (34)

 (33) The two heroes are frequently coupled in Homer, e.g. "Il." v.
    519; x. 241, etc.

 (34) Or, "were brilliant in single points, and broadly speaking were
    the cause that Troy was taken." See Hygin. "Fab." 108; Virg.
    "Aen." ii. 163.

Castor and Polydeuces, (35) by reason of their glorious display of arts obtained from Cheiron,
and for the high honour and prestige therefrom derived, are now immortal.

 (35) Castor, Polydeuces, s. Pollux--the great twin brethren. See
    Grote, "H. G." i. 232 foll.

Machaon and Podaleirius (36) were trained in this same lore, and proved themselves adepts in
works of skill, in argument and feats of arms. (37)

 (36) As to the two sons of Asclepius, Machaon and Podaleirius, the
    leaders of the Achaeans, see "Il." ii. 728; Schol. ad Pind.

    iv. 71. 4; Grote, "H. G." i. 248.

 (37) Or, "in crafts, in reasonings, and in deeds of war."

Antilochus, (38) in that he died for his father, obtained so great a glory that, in the judgment
of Hellas, to him alone belongs the title "philopator," "who loved his father." (39)

 (38) Antilochus, son of Nestor, slain by Memnon. "Od." iv. 186 foll.;
    Pind. "Pyth." vi. 28; Philostr. "Her." iv.; "Icon." ii. 281.

    Plat. "Laws," 730 D, "He shall be proclaimed the great and perfect
    citizen, and bear away the palm of virtue"; and for the epithet
    see Eur. "Or." 1605; "I. A." 68.

Aeneas (40) saved the ancestral gods--his father's and his mother's; (41) yea, and his own
father also, whereby he bore off a reputation for piety so great that to him alone among all
on whom they laid their conquering hand in Troy even the enemy granted not to be despoiled.

 (40) As to Aeneas see Poseidon's speech, "Il." xx. 293 foll.; Grote,
    "H. G." i. 413, 427 foll.

 (41) Cf. "Hell." II. iv. 21.

Achilles, (42) lastly, being nursed in this same training, bequeathed to after-days memorials
so fair, so ample, that to speak or hear concerning him no man wearies.

 (42) "The highest form that floated before Greek imagination was
    Achilles," Hegel, "Lectures on the Philosophy of History" (Eng.
    tr. p. 233); and for a beautiful elaboration of that idea, J. A.
    Symonds, "Greek Poets," 2nd series, ch. ii.

Such, by dint of that painstaking care derived from Cheiron, these all proved themselves; of
whom all good men yet still to-day are lovers and all base men envious. So much so that if
throughout the length and breadth of Hellas misfortunes at any time befell city or king, it
was they who loosed the knot of them; (43) or if all Hellas found herself confronted with the
hosts of the Barbarians in strife and battle, once again it was these who nerved the arms of
Hellenes to victory and rendered Hellas unconquered and unconquerable.

 (43) Reading {eluonto autous}, or if as L. D., {di autous}, transl.
    "thanks to them, they were loosed."

For my part, then, my advice to the young is, do not despise hunting or the other training
of your boyhood, if you desire to grow up to be good men, good not only in war but in all else
of which the issue is perfection in thought, word, and deed.

II

The first efforts of a youth emerging from boyhood should be directed to the institution of
the chase, after which he should come to the rest of education, provided he have the means
and with an eye to the same; if his means be ample, in a style worthy of the profit to be derived;
or, if they be scant, let him at any rate contribute enthusiasm, in nothing falling short of
the power he possesses.

What are the aids and implements of divers sorts with which he who would enter on this field
must equip himself? These and the theory of each in particular I will now explain. With a view
to success in the work, forewarned is forearmed. Nor let such details be looked upon as insignificant.
Without them there will be an end to practical results. (1)

 (1) Or, "The question suggests itself--how many instruments and of
    what sort are required by any one wishing to enter this field? A
    list of these I propose to give, not omitting the theoretical side
    of the matter in each case, so that whoever lays his hand to this
    work may have some knowledge to go upon. It would be a mistake to
    regard these details as trivial. In fact, without them the
    undertaking might as well be let alone."

The net-keeper should be a man with a real passion for the work, and in tongue a Hellene, about
twenty years of age, of wiry build, agile at once and strong, with pluck enough to overcome
the toils imposed on him, (2) and to take pleasure in the work.

 (2) {toutous}, "by this, that, or the other good quality."

The ordinary small nets should be made of fine Phasian or Carthaginian (3) flax, and so too
should the road nets and the larger hayes. (4) These small nets should be nine-threaded (made
of three strandes, and each strand of three threads), (5) five spans (6) in depth, (7) and
two palms (8) at the nooses or pockets. (9) There should be no knots in the cords that run
round, which should be so inserted as to run quite smoothly. (10) The road net should be twelve-threaded,
and the larger net (or haye) sixteen. They may be of different sizes, the former varying from
twelve to twenty-four or thirty feet, the latter from sixty to one hundred and twenty or one
hundred and eighty feet. (11) If larger they will be unwieldy and hard to manage. Both should
be thirty-knotted, and the interval of the nooses the same as in the ordinary small nets. At
the elbow ends (12) the road net should be furnished with nipples (13) (or eyes), and the larger
sort (the haye) with rings, and both alike with a running line of twisted cord. The pronged
stakes (14) for the small nets should be ten palms high, (15) as a rule, but there should be
some shorter ones besides; those of unequal length will be convenient to equalise the height
on uneven ground, and those of equal length on level. They should be sharp-tipped so as to
draw out easily (16) and smooth throughout. Those for the road nets should be twice the height,
(17) and those for the big (haye) nets five spans long, (18) with small forks, the notches
not deep; they should be stout and solid, of a thickness proportionate to their length. The
number of props needed for the nets will vary--many or few, according to circumstances; a less
number if the tension on the net be great, and a larger number when the nets are slack. (19)

 (3) Phasian or Carchedonian. Cf. Pollux, v. 26.

    nets can be fitted on and off easily, with sharp points"; or "off

    1/2 inch; al. 5 x 9 inches = 45 inches = 3 ft. 9 inches.

 (19) Or, "if in the particular position the nets are taut, a larger if
    they lie slack."

Lastly, for the purpose of carrying the nets and hayes, for either sort (20) there must be
a bag of calf-skin; and billhooks to cut down branches and stop gaps in the woods when necessary.
(21)

    ekatera}, transl. "or either separately."

 (21) Or, "for the purpose of felling wood and stopping up gaps where
    necessary."

III

There are two breeds of sporting dogs: the Castorian and the fox-like. (1) The former get their
name from Castor, in memory of the delight he took in the business of the chase, for which
he kept this breed by preference. (2) The other breed is literally foxy, being the progeny
originally of the dog and the fox, whose natures have in the course of ages become blent. (3)

 (1) {Kastoriai}, or Laconian, approaching possibly the harrier type;
    {alopekides}, i.e. vulpocanine, hybrid between fox and dog.

 (2) Or, "get their appellation from the fact that Castor took delight
    in the business of the chase, and kept this breed specially for
    the purpose." Al. {diephulaxen}, "propagated and preserved the
    breed which we now have." See Darwin, "Animals and Plants under
    Domestication," ii. 202, 209.

 (3) Or, "and through lapse of time the twofold characteristics of
    their progenitors have become blent." See Timoth. Gaz. ap.
    Schneid. ad loc. for an ancient superstition as to breeds.

Both species present a large proportion of defective animals (4) which fall short of the type,
as being under-sized, or crook-nosed, (5) or gray-eyed, (6) or near-sighted, or ungainly, or
stiff-jointed, or deficient in strength, thin-haired, lanky, disproportioned, devoid of pluck
or of nose, or unsound of foot. To particularise: an under-sized dog will, ten to one, break
off from the chase (7) faint and flagging in the performance of his duty owing to mere diminutiveness.
An aquiline nose means no mouth, and consequently an inability to hold the hare fast. (8) A
blinking bluish eye implies defect of vision; (9) just as want of shape means ugliness. (10)
The stiff-limbed dog will come home limping from the hunting-field; (11) just as want of strength
and thinness of coat go hand in hand with incapacity for toil. (12) The lanky-legged, unsymmetrical
dog, with his shambling gait and ill-compacted frame, ranges heavily; while the spiritless
animal will leave his work to skulk off out of the sun into shade and lie down. Want of nose
means scenting the hare with difficulty, or only once in a way; and however courageous he may
be, a hound with unsound feet cannot stand the work, but through foot-soreness will eventually
give in. (13)

 (4) Or, "defective specimens (that is to say, the majority) are to be
    noted, as follows."

 (5) {grupai}.

 (6) {kharopoi}. Al. Arrian, iv. 4, 5.

 (7) Or, "will probably retire from the chase and throw up the business
    through mere diminutiveness."

 (8) Or, "a hook-nosed (? pig-jawed, see Stonehenge, "The Dog," p. 19,
    4th ed.) dog has a bad mouth and cannot hold."

 (9) Or, "a short-sighted, wall-eyed dog has defective vision."

 (10) Or, "they are weedy, ugly brutes as a rule."

 (11) Or, "stiffness of limbs means he will come off." Cf. "Mem." III.
    xiii. 6.

 (12) Lit. "a weak, thinly-haired animal is incapable of severe toil."

 (13) Or, "Nor will courage compensate for unsound feet. The toil and
    moil will be too great to endure, and owing to the pains in his
    feet he will in the end give in."

Similarly many different modes of hunting a line of scent are to be seen in the same species
of hound. (14) One dog as soon as he has found the trail will go along without sign or symptom
to show that he is on the scent; another will vibrate his ears only and keep his tail (15)
perfectly still; while a third has just the opposite propensity: he will keep his ears still
and wag with the tip of his tail. Others draw their ears together, and assuming a solemn air,
(16) drop their tails, tuck them between their legs, and scour along the line. Many do nothing
of the sort. (17) They tear madly about, babbling round the line when they light upon it, and
senselessly trampling out the scent. Others again will make wide circuits and excursions; either
forecasting the line, (18) they overshoot it and leave the hare itself behind, or every time
they run against the line they fall to conjecture, and when they catch sight of the quarry
are all in a tremor, (19) and will not advance a step till they see the creature begin to stir.

 (14) Or, "Also the same dogs will exhibit many styles of coursing: one
    set as soon as they have got the trail pursue it without a sign,
    so there is no means of finding out that the animal is on the
    track."

 (15) "Stern."

 (16) Or "with their noses solemnly fixed on the ground and sterns
    lowered."

 (17) Or, "have quite a different action"; "exhibit quite another
    manner."

 (18) i.e. "they cast forwards to make short cuts," of skirters too
    lazy to run the line honestly.

 (19) Reading {tremousi}, "fall a-trembling"; al. {atremousi}, stand
    "stock-still"; i.e. are "dwellers."
