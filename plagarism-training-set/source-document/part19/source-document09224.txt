THE SOLDIER'S DEATH IN MINDANAO.

(By John J. Reidy.)

    The lone shades of evening have fallen o'er the white tented plain,
    And the sun has sank deep in the horizon of the watery main.
    The Camp is all silent, the banners are waving no more,
    And the sound of the waves are echoing from the far distant shore.

    The tire-worn soldier, fatigued from the march of the day,
    Is silently sleeping and dreaming of scenes far away.
    Of his own Native Land where he spent many jovial hours,
    Of the sweetheart with whom he has roved by the shady green bowers.

    He sees in his dreams the cherished home of his boyhood so dear,
    And the mother he loved as she sits by the fireside in tears.
    She is thinking of him who has gone from her side to the war
    To fight the bold Moros in Mindanao's island afar.

    She is patiently waiting for the bright day of gladness to come,
    When with arms outstretched she will welcome the warrior home.
    But lo, as the darkness grows denser in Mindanao's heights,
    The loud pealing of cannons is heard in the dark stilly night.

    The trump'ter's call, echoing loud through the hills and ravines,
    Has aroused the brave soldier from the joy of his whimsical dreams.
    He has joined his brave comrades who have formed in line for the fray,
    Then he thinks of his mother, his sweetheart and home far away.
