Proceeding on these data, M. Moreau de Jonnes has formed a table, showing, 1. the maximum in
Roman measures, the same as the established imperial edict; and 2. the mean price of objects
formed from half the maximum, and reduced into French measures.

The following is the table drawn up by M. Moreau de Jonnes. The slightest inspection of it
will enable us to appreciate the importance of this archaeological discovery, for no monument
of antiquity has furnished so long a series of numerical terms, of statistical data, and positive
testimony of the civil life and domestic economy of the Greeks and Romans:--

We are much surprised at the very high prices in this table. Labour and provisions cost ten
and twenty times as much as with us. But when we come to compare the price of provisions with
the price of labour the dearness of all the necessaries of life appears still more excessive.
M. Moreau de Jonnes makes this comparison. He brings together from the edicts of Diocletian
a great many facts given by historians, and he shows, that, if the abundance of the precious
metals has any influence on raising the prices, the want of labour, industry, and of produce,
must cause it also.

These considerations point out in the strongest manner the poverty of this royal people, of
whom two-thirds, if not three-fourths, were reduced to live on fish and cheese, and drink piquette,
when the expense of the table of Vitellius amounted, in a single year, to 175 millions of Francs.--Brewster's
Journal of Science.

EPIGRAMS,

Written on the Union, 1801, by a celebrated Barrister of Dublin.

Adapted to the Commercial Failures, 1800.

  Why should we exclaim, that the times are so bad,
    Pursuing a querulous strain?
  When Erin gives up all the rights that she had,
    What right has she left to complain?

  The Cit complains to all he meets,
  That grass will grow in Dublin streets,
    And swears that all is over!
  Short-sighted mortals, can't you see,
  Your mourning will be chang'd to glee--
    For then you'll live in clover.

EPITAPH ON A CONTROVERSIALIST.

On the death of that turbulent and refractory enthusiast, John Lilburne, alias Free-born John,
alias Lilburne the Trouble-world, there appeared the following epigrammatic epitaph:--

  Is John departed, and is Lilburne gone?
  Farewell to both, to Lilburne and to John!
  Yet being gone, take this advice from me,
  Let them not both in one grave buried be.

  Here lay ye John; lay Lilburne thereabout,
  For if they both should meet, they would fall out.

This alluded to a saying, that John Lilburne was so quarrelsome, that if he were the only man
in the world, John would quarrel with Lilburne, and Lilburne with John. Lilburne, it will be
remembered, was a sad thorn in Cromwell's sore side, for which the protector amply repaid him.

HOSPITAL OF SURGERY.

A new surgical hospital is to be forthwith erected in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross, where
the King, with his usual and characteristic munificence, has given a spot of ground on which
it is to be erected. A benevolent individual has given, within these few days, 1,500 l. towards
a fund for the building.
