Early on Monday morning we started by train for home; but travelling by rail was much slower
in those days, and although we journeyed the whole of the day and late into the night which
followed, we did not reach our home at Thelwall until Tuesday, November 21st, at two o'clock
in the morning, where we awoke the sleepers by singing "Home, Sweet Home" beneath a bedroom
window on the east side of Cuerden Hall, where we knew our father and mother would be waiting
for us--as they are now, but in no earthly home.

The news of our arrival soon spread through the surrounding country, where we were well known,
and for a time we were lionised and visited by a host of friends, and our well-worn sticks,
which at one time we thought of leaving in the sea at Land's End, were begged from us by intimate
friends and treasured for many years by their new owners in the parish of Grappenhall.

Considerable interest had naturally been taken locally in our long walk, for we had been absent
from our customary haunts for seventy-five days, having travelled by land and sea--apart from
the actual walk from John o' Groat's to Land's End--a distance nearly a thousand miles. Everybody
wanted to be told all about it, so I was compelled to give the information in the form of lectures,
which were repeated in the course of many years in different parts of the country where aid
for philanthropic purposes was required.
