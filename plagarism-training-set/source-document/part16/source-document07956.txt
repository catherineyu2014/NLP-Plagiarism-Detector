CONCLUDING PAPER.

One day--to return to our traveler and his personal experiences--M. Forgues makes the acquaintance
of a Swiss who resides at Paraguari, a small interior town distant about twenty-five leagues
from Asuncion. His new acquaintance invites him to go with him to Paraguari, but before complying
with the invitation M. Forgues crosses the river and rides into the territory of Gran Chaco
as far as the Quinta de la Miseria, situated about two miles and a half from the river-bank.
The owner of this farm, Mequelain, a French pioneer, his wife and three servants, had been
surprised and murdered by the Chaco Indians a short while before the arrival of M. Forgues
in Asuncion. The quinta is on the edge of a vast plain. The unfortunate Mequelain had surrounded
his house with ditches and a small fence of posts. Besides this, he had built a sort of observatory
from which to watch the movements of the Indians. But his precautions, as the end showed, proved
useless. The farm was occupied by new tenants at the time of M. Forgues's visit, and the bodies
of the five victims were buried in one of the ditches. The Quinta de la Miseria derives its
gloomy name from the tragic event that had given it its melancholy prominence in the minds
of the people of Asuncion. To reach Paraguari our traveler avails himself of the railroad which
extends between that town and the capital. The railroad-station presents a lively scene with
its crowd of savage-looking natives thronging it. In connection with this station M. Forgues
mentions a curious circumstance--that in order to prevent the rush of the multitude to the
cars on the departure of the train the station-master has ingeniously replaced gates and fences,
which might be climbed easily, with brushes steeped in pitch and tar, so disposed as to bar
the passage. As the Paraguayan women hold cleanliness to be one of the cardinal virtues, they
religiously avoid these defiling brushes for fear of soiling their garments. The cars are built
on the most approved American model. The train, furthermore, has two platform-cars attached
to it, which are reserved exclusively for the gratuitous use of the poor, who are permitted
to ride on them with as much as they can carry in the way of bundles and other goods. Sometimes
the platforms are so crowded that they are lost to sight under the passengers' heads and legs.
