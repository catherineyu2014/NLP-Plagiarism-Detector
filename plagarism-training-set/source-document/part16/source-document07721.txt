view of Christianizing the several Indian tribes in America, therefore in consideration of
the many advantages that would accrue to the proprietors of Orford if said College could be
settled in said town, and that the same pious design might be carried into immediate execution,

"Voted, in case said College should be settled in said township, to give and grant for the
Use and Benefit of said College, for ever, one thousand acres of land in said town. Also, whereas
the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock is appointed president of said College, and doubtless will settle
himself and family in the town where the College shall be, where it will be very necessary

    "To the Honorable and Reverend Trust of Dartmouth College."

    Newburyport, March 6, 1770.

Reverend Sir: I have lately received an account from Plymouth of a subscription being opened
and there is already three thousand dollars in labor, provisions, etc., subscribed; also another
here worth one thousand dollars, provided the College is fixed in Campton, Rumney, or Plymouth;
also being sensible that you will be at great expense to move into a new country, have opened
another subscription for Rev. Dr. Wheelock, which will be generous; I have lately heard that
the College is to be fixed before the meeting of the trustees, which is the reason of Mr. Call's
journey, the bearer of this, who is a friend to the Indian cause, and in time past has been
a means of collecting a considerable for them. I should be much obliged if you would inform
me the time the College will be fixed, and I will bring or send the subscriptions, which I
make no doubt will be generous when completed. If it should not be agreeable to the trustees
to fix the College in any of the above mentioned towns, these subscriptions will not do any
hurt to the College nor Dr. Wheelock, but spur on others to outdo. I think, where it is fixed,
they ought to do generously, as it must help them much. I conclude with our family's and my
duty to you and Madam Wheelock, and regards to all the family, and remain your most obedient
servant,

    Moses Little.

"P. S. We hear that the most generous subscription is to carry the College, provided the place
is suitable; hope what we offer Dr. Wheelock will not be any damage, for it is not done as
a private thing, but are willing the trustees and everybody else should know.

"M. L. has subscribed:

    20 thousand boards.
    20 tons hay, three years, is 60 tons.
    10 bushels wheat, three years, is 30 bushels.
    10 bushels rye, three years, is 30 bushels.
    10 bushels Indian, three years, is 30 bushels.
    10 days labor, three years, is 30 days.

"Also use of house and barn and land pasturing round it, twenty acres cleared; also Esq. Brainerd,
one right of land, etc., in Rumney; also sent a man with a subscription, to be followed, we
hope, in proportion and more than proportion to the above. Expect some hundred bushels grain
yearly for three years, also land and labor; and if the above is not enough subscribed by Moses
Little, Dr. Wheelock shall have liberty to improve as much of his land as he pleases."

"Reverend Sir: I have had the pleasure to see your letter, directed to the mayor of this city
and others. The subject of it was a very agreeable one. To encourage literature indicates a
great mind; to civilize savages, with a view to their eternal happiness, evinces a goodness
of heart and a charitable disposition truly commendable; whoever attempts it has a right to
claim the assistance of every worthy member of society. I shall be happy if I can be any ways
instrumental in promoting the success of your humane plan; I am informed that Mr. Mayor and
the other gentlemen of the corporation have expressed an equal desire, and I make no doubt
but their offers will be such as a corporation ought to make who are impressed with a sense
of its general utility. I could say much of the advantages that would accrue from fixing the
School near this city, but as you have doubtless considered this affair with attention, you
will have anticipated all I could say on the subject. I shall only remark that I have observed
with much satisfaction that the morals of my fellow-citizens are much less vitiated than those
of other cities that have an immediate foreign trade, and consequently import the vices of
other climes; to this, give me leave to add, that a becoming economy is what characterizes
our people, and may, by way of example, have a very good effect on the Indian children, and
such others as might be allowed to take their education in the proposed seminary.

"Should you, however, reverend sir, after receiving the proposals of the corporation, think
them inadequate to the advantages the city would receive, or should you, for reasons that do
not occur to me, think a more remote situation more eligible (which I wish may not be), I then,
sir, will make an offer, to forward the charity. But though I have already fixed on the proposals
I intend to make, I must yet declare that those that I am told the city intends to offer appear
to me to have the advantage in point of fulfilling the intentions of the gentlemen at home,
but perhaps it may be thought otherwise, and I be mistaken.

"Whenever, sir, this or your other affairs may call you into this county, I shall be extremely
glad to show you any civilities in my power, and beg you will make my house your home, where
I try to keep up to the good old adage, 'to welcome the coming and to speed the going guest.'

"Reverend Sir: As I understand that Colonel Alexander Phelps, Esquire, has been on business
of importance relative to your College, to wit, the consulting the honorable trustees, at Portsmouth,
concerning the place where it will be best to set the said College, and as there is great engagedness
and large subscriptions making by the Proprietors and others of the towns of Plainfield, Hartford,
Harford, Lebanon, Norwich, Hanover, and some other back towns, for the said School, if said
School should be set in Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire, now, sir, I suppose that
Colonel Phelps never heard of this subscription, and I apprehend he has not laid this donation,
with the circumstances of the place, before the Board at Portsmouth.

"Trusting in your wisdom and willingness to hear everything of consequence to said School,
I would therefore pray that the place for the said College may not be fixed on till the donations
may be gathered and the circumstances of the place be properly laid before their Honors.

"P. S. I suppose there can be as much or more said in favor of its going to the said town of
Hanover than any town on the river, which will be laid before their Honors in writing, if desired.

    "From their humble servant and well-wisher to said School,
    James Murch."

In a later letter he says:

"Now, sir, we all hope you will view the place yourself, and the people well all be satisfied
that the College will be set in the best place for its benefit; or, if a disinterested man
should come and view the places, and make a representation, it is generally thought it would
come to Hanover or Lebanon. Now, sir, I shall endeavor to set before you some of the benefits
of this place for the College. First, here is a large tract of land of near three thousand
acres or more, all lying together, and the greater part some of the best of land. I shall only
add that there may be a good road to Portsmouth; and it is in a line to Crown Point from Portsmouth;
and a very narrow place in the great river, for a brig; and it is by a long pair of falls;
and where salt and other articles, brought up the river, will be cheaper than they will be
further up.

"Having given some short hints of what is commonly talked of where I have been, I hope you
will condescend to forgive what is amiss in this broken letter.

"My dear Sir: I trust you have received my two late letters, by my son and Sir Trimble, with
orders, if you can to good advantage, to make sale of my tenement at the Crank, and pay my
debts to Mr. Dean, Mr. Watson, and yourself. If you have successfully attempted the affair,
or shall soon so do, I should be glad to see you, and if it may be with the remainder of the
money as soon as may be; or if you could, before you come, visit Dr. Mead, who was principal
of, and agent for, the first grantees of the town of Landaff, the settlement of which is now
retarded and discouraged by the influence of Mr. Joseph Davenport, who has inspired an apprehension
in the minds of the populace that they shall be exposed to a quarrel, if they should settle
there, etc. I wish I could send you a copy of the College Charter, and enable you to discourse
understandingly with Dr. Mead, and let him see how amply this incorporation is endowed, and
how independent it is made of this government or any other incorporation; that the first object
of the royal grant of said township was the dispersed Indian natives, and to this corporation
only in trust for that purpose; that such a matter of controversy can be decided by no judicatory
but supreme, or one equal to that which incorporated it, that is the Continental Congress;
that unless they can prove that the fee of those lands was not in reality in the king when
the charter thereof was given to the College and the grant made to the grantees (however irregular
and unkind the steps taken may have been), they will find it difficult, if not impracticable,
to recover it. However, to prevent any expense in that matter, quiet the minds of people and
facilitate the settlement, as well as exercise proper regard to those who have looked upon
themselves injured thereby, I would propose some conditions of agreement with those first grantees,
whereby I might obtain their quitclaims to the premises; that is, either a sum of money, or
some other way. What if you should see Dr. Mead and discourse with him before you come hither?
But the bearer is waiting. Accept love to you and yours, etc., from your affectionate,

MISCELLANEOUS MATTER.

"Since there is great misrepresentations by some concerning my life and education, I take this
opportunity to give the world, in few words, the true account of my education. I was born a
heathen in Mmoyanheeunnuck, alias Mohegan, in New London, North America. My parents were altogether
heathens, and I was educated by them in their heathenish notions, though there was a sermon
preached to our Mohegan tribe sometimes, but our Indians regarded not the Christian religion.
They would persist in their heathenish ways, and my parents in particular were very strong
in the customs of their forefathers, and they led a wandering life up and down in the wilderness,
for my father was a great hunter. Thus I lived with them till I was sixteen years old, and
then there was a great stir of religion in these parts of the world both amongst the Indians
as well as the English, and about this time I began to think about the Christian religion,
and was under great trouble of mind for some time. I thought the religion which I heard at
this time was a new thing among mankind, such as they never heard the like before, so ignorant
was I, and when I was seventeen years of age I received a hope, and as I begun to think about
religion, so I began to learn to read, though I went to no school till I was in my nineteenth
year, and then I went to the Rev. Mr. Wheelock's to learning, and spent four years there, and
was very weakly most of the time; this is the true account of my education.

In the "History of the Five Indian Nations," by Cadwallader Colden, we find the following paragraph:

"The French priests had (from time to time) persuaded several of the Five Nations to leave
their own country and to settle near Montreal, where the French are very industrious in encouraging
them. Their numbers have been likewise increased by the prisoners the French have taken in
war, and by others who have run from their own country because of some mischief that they had
done, or debts which they owed to the Christians. These Indians all profess Christianity, and
therefore are commonly called the Praying Indians by their countrymen, and they are called
Cahnuagas (Caghnawagas) by the people of Albany."

"An agreement between the Reverend Doctor Eleazar Wheelock, president of Dartmouth College,
and Mr. John Smith, late tutor of the same, with respect to said Mr. Smith's settlement and
salary in capacity of professor of the languages in Dartmouth College.

"Mr. Smith agrees to settle as Professor of English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, etc., in
Dartmouth College, to teach which, and as many of these and other such languages as he shall
understand, as the Trustees shall judge necessary and practicable for one man, and also to
read lectures on them, as often as the president, tutors, etc., with himself shall judge profitable
for the Seminary. He also agrees, while he can do it consistently with his office as professor,
annually to serve as tutor to a class of students in the College. In consideration of which,
Dr. Wheelock agrees to give him (the said Mr. Smith) one hundred pounds L. My. annually as
a salary to be paid one half in money and the other half in money or in such necessary articles
for a family as wheat, Indian corn, rye, beef, pork, mutton, butter, cheese, hay, pasturing,
etc., as long as he shall continue professor as aforesaid, and that he shall have these articles
delivered to him at the same price for which they were usually sold before the commencement
of the present war in America, viz.: that he shall have wheat at 5s. per bushel, rye at 3s.,
Indian corn at 2s. 6d., fresh beef at 3d. per lb., salt beef at 4-1/2d., fresh pork at 4-1/2d.,
salt do. at 7d., fresh beef at 18s. per ct., do. pork at 25s., mutton at 3d. per lb., butter
at 3d., cheese at 3d., bread at 2d., hay at 30s. per ton, pasturing per season for horse 30s.,
for cow 20s., and also to give him one acre of land near the College for a building spot, a
deed of which he promises to give him whenever he shall request the same. Doctor Wheelock also
agrees that Mr. Smith's salary, viz.: one hundred pounds annually, shall not be diminished
when his business as professor shall be so great that it will render it impracticable for him
to serve as a tutor to a class in College; and that Mr. Smith shall not be removed from his
professorship except the Trustees of Dartmouth College shall judge him incapacitated therefor,
and also that Mr. Smith's salary shall begin with the date hereof. Doctor Wheelock also promises
to lay this agreement before the Trustees of Dartmouth College to be confirmed by them at their
next meeting. Mr. Smith also promises that whenever he shall have a sufficient support from
any fund established for the maintenance of a professor of languages, he will give up the salary
to which the agreement entitles him.

In 1862 an inventory of the Philosophical Apparatus belonging to the college was taken, and
the transfer was made to the Appleton Fund; the amount of this inventory was $2,352.75. While
Rev. H. Fairbanks occupied the chair of Natural Philosophy about $800 was paid out. Prof. C.
A. Young expended over $5,000 for apparatus while he had charge of the department. Most of
the apparatus is in good condition, and its value is not far from $10,000.

For the Astronomical Department Prof. C. A. Young raised among the Alumni and friends of the
college, mostly in New England, over $5,000, to put the Observatory in good condition.

Recent liberal donations to the College from the State, and from Hon. E. W. Stoughton, of New
York, have enabled the Faculty to put the Medical Building in complete repair throughout. A
suitable room for a Pathological Museum has been finished, which is frequently receiving specimens
of diseased structure. The supply of plates, models, etc., is very ample, and is freely used
in illustration of the lectures.

CHARTER OF DARTMOUTH COLLEGE.

Whereupon the said Eleazar Wheelock thought it expedient that endeavors should be used to raise
contributions from well disposed persons in England, for the carrying on and extending said
undertaking, and for that purpose said Eleazar Wheelock requested the Rev. Nathaniel Whitaker,
now Doctor in Divinity, to go over to England for that purpose, and sent over with him the
Rev. Sampson Occom, an Indian minister, who had been educated by the said Wheelock. And to
enable the said Whitaker, to the more successful performance of said work on which he was sent,
said Wheelock gave him a full power of attorney, by which said Whitaker solicited those worthy
and generous contributors to the charity, viz. the Right Hon. William Earl of Dartmouth, the
Hon. Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, Knight, one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer,
John Thornton, of Clapham, in the county of Surrey, Esq., Samuel Roffey, of Lincoln's Innfields,
in the county of Middlesex, Esq., Charles Hardey, of the parish of St. Mary-le-bonne, in said
county, Esq., Daniel West, of Christ's Church, Spitalfields, in the county aforesaid, Esq.,
Samuel Savage, of the same place, gentleman; Josiah Robarts, of the parish of St. Edmund the
King, Lombard Street, London, gentleman, and Robert Keen, of the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate,
London, gentleman; to receive the several sums of money which should be contributed, and to
be trustees to the contributors to such charity: which they cheerfully agreed to.

Whereupon, the said Whitaker did, by virtue of said power of attorney, constitute and appoint
the said Earl of Dartmouth, Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, John Thornton, Samuel Roffey, Charles
Hardey, and Daniel West, Esquires, and Samuel Savage, Josiah Robarts, and Robert Keen, gentlemen,
to be trustees of the money which had then been contributed, and which should by his means
be contributed for said purpose; which trust they have accepted, as by their engrossed declaration
of the same under their hands and seals, well executed fully appears, and the same hath also
been ratified by a deed of trust, well executed by said Wheelock.

And the said Wheelock further represents, that he has, by a power of attorney, for many weighty
reasons, given full power to the said trustees, to fix upon and determine the place for said
school, most subservient to the great end in view. And to enable them understandingly to give
the preference, the said Wheelock has laid before the said trustees the several offers which
have been generously made in the several governments in America to encourage and invite the
settlement of said school among them for their own private emolument, and for the increase
of learning in their respective places, as well as for the furtherance of the general design
in view.

And whereas a large number of the proprietors of lands in the western part of this our province
of New Hampshire, animated and excited thereto by the generous example of his Excellency their
Governor, and by the liberal contributions of many noblemen and gentlemen in England, and especially
by the consideration that such a situation would be as convenient as any for carrying on the
great design among the Indians; and also considering that without the least impediment to the
said design, the same school may be enlarged and improved to promote learning among the English,
and be a means to supply a great number of churches and congregations which are likely soon
to be formed in that new country, with a learned and orthodox ministry, they the said proprietors
have promised large tracts of land for the uses aforesaid, provided the school shall be settled
in the western part of our said province.

And they the said Right Hon. Hon. and worthy trustees before mentioned, having maturely considered
the reasons and arguments in favor of the several places proposed, have given the preference
to the western part of our said province, lying on Connecticut river, as a situation most convenient
for said school.

And the said Wheelock has further represented a necessity of a legal incorporation, in order
to the safety and well being of said seminary, and its being capable of the tenure and disposal
of lands and bequests for the use of the same. And the said Wheelock has also represented,
that for many weighty reasons, it will be expedient, at least in the infancy of said institution,
or till it can be accommodated in that new country, and he and his friends be able to remove
and settle by and round about it, that the gentlemen whom he has already nominated in his last
will (which he has transmitted to the aforesaid gentlemen of the trust in England) to be trustees
in America, should be of the corporation now proposed. And also as there are already large
collections for said school in the hands of the aforesaid gentlemen of the trust in England,
and all reason to believe from their signal wisdom, piety, and zeal, to promote the Redeemer's
cause (which has already procured for them the utmost confidence of the kingdom) we may expect
they will appoint successors in time to come, who will be men of the same spirit, whereby great
good may and will accrue many ways to the institution, and much be done by their example and
influence to encourage and facilitate the whole design in view; for which reasons said Wheelock
desires that the trustees aforesaid, may be vested with all that power therein which can consist
with their distance from the same.

Know ye therefore that We, considering the premises and being willing to encourage the laudable
design of spreading Christian knowledge among the savages of our American wilderness. And also
that the best means of education be established in our province of New Hampshire, for the benefit
of said province, do, of our special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, by and with
the advice of our council for said province, by these presents will, ordain, grant and constitute
that there be a college erected in our said province of New Hampshire, by the name of Dartmouth
College, for the education and instruction of youths of the Indian tribes in this land, in
reading, writing, and all parts of learning, which shall appear necessary and expedient, for
civilizing and christianizing the children of pagans, as well as in all liberal arts and sciences,
and also of English youths, and any others. And the trustees of said college may, and shall
be, one body corporate and politic in deed, action and name, and shall be called, named, and
distinguished by the name of The Trustees of Dartmouth College.

And further, We have willed, given, granted, constituted and ordained, and by this our present
charter, of our special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, with the advice aforesaid,
do for us, our heirs and successors forever, will, give, grant, constitute, and ordain, that
there shall from henceforth and forever, be in the said Dartmouth College, a body politic,
consisting of Trustees of Dartmouth College. And for the more full and perfect erection of
said Corporation and body politic, consisting of Trustees of Dartmouth College, We, of our
special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, do, by these presents, for us, our heirs
and successors, make, ordain, constitute and appoint, our trusty and well beloved John Wentworth,
Esquire, Governor of our said province, and the governor of our said province of New Hampshire,
for the time being, and our trusty and well beloved Theodore Atkinson, Esquire, now president
of our council of our said province, George Jaffrey and Daniel Pierce, Esqrs., both of our
said council, and Peter Gilman, Esq., now Speaker of our House of Representatives in said province,
and William Pitkin, Esq., one of the Assistants of our colony of Connecticut, and our trusty
and well beloved Eleazar Wheelock, of Lebanon, Doctor in Divinity, Benjamin Pomeroy, of Hebron,
James Lockwood, of Weathersfield, Timothy Pitkin and John Smalley, of Farmington, and William
Patten of Hartford, all of our said colony of Connecticut, ministers of the gospel (the whole
number of said trustees consisting, and hereafter forever to consist, of twelve and no more)
to be trustees of said Dartmouth College, in this our province of New Hampshire.

And We do further, of our special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, for us, our heirs
and successors, will, give, grant and appoint that the said trustees and their successors shall,
forever hereafter, be in deed, act and name, a body corporate and politic, and that they the
said body corporate and politic, shall be known and distinguished in all deeds, grants, bargains,
sales, writings, evidences or otherwise however, and in all courts forever hereafter plead
and be impleaded by the name of The Trustees of Dartmouth College. And that the said corporation
by the name aforesaid, shall be able and in law capable for the use of said Dartmouth College,
to have, get, acquire, purchase, receive, hold, possess and enjoy, tenements, hereditaments,
jurisdictions and franchises for themselves and their successors, in fee simple or otherwise
however, and to purchase, receive, or build any house or houses, or any other buildings, as
they shall think needful and convenient for the use of said Dartmouth College, and in such
town in the western part of our said province of New Hampshire, as shall, by said trustees,
or the major part of them be agreed upon, their said agreement to be evidenced by an instrument
in writing under their hands ascertaining the same. And also to receive and dispose of any
lands, goods, chattels and other things of what nature soever, for the use aforesaid. And also
to have, accept and receive any rents, profits, annuities, gifts, legacies, donations or bequests
of any kind whatsoever for the use aforesaid: so nevertheless, that the yearly value of the
premises do not exceed the sum of six thousand pounds sterling. And therewith or otherwise
to support and pay, as the said trustees, or the major part of such of them as are regularly
convened for that purpose, shall agree; the president, tutors, and other officers and ministers
of said Dartmouth College, and also to pay all such missionaries and school masters as shall
be authorized, appointed and employed by them for civilizing, Christianizing, and instructing
the Indian natives of this land, their several allowances, and also their respective annual
salaries or allowances, and also such necessary and contingent charges, as from time to time
shall arise and accrue, relating to said Dartmouth College. And also to bargain, sell, let
or assign lands, tenements, hereditaments, goods or chattels, and all other things whatsoever,
by the name aforesaid, in as full and ample a manner, to all intents and purposes as a natural
person or other body corporate or politic, is able to do by the laws of our realm of Great
Britain, or of said province of New Hampshire.

And further, of our special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, to the intent that our
said corporation and body politic may answer the end of their erection and constitution, and
may have perpetual succession and continuance forever, We do for us, our heirs and successors,
will, give and grant unto the said trustees of Dartmouth College, and to their successors forever,
that there shall be once a year, and every year, a meeting of said trustees, held at said Dartmouth
College, at such time as by said trustees, or the major part of them, at any legal meeting
of said trustees shall be agreed on. The first meeting to be called by the said Eleazar Wheelock,
as soon as conveniently may be, within one year next after the enrolment of these our letters
patent, at such time and place as he shall judge proper. And the said trustees, or the major
part of any seven or more of them, shall then determine on the time for holding the annual
meeting, aforesaid, which may be altered as they shall hereafter find most convenient.

And We do further ordain and direct, that the said Eleazar Wheelock shall notify the time for
holding the first meeting to be called as aforesaid, by sending a letter to each of said trustees,
and causing an advertisement thereof to be printed in the "New Hampshire Gazette," and in some
public newspaper printed in the colony of Connecticut. But in case of the death or incapacity
of said Wheelock, then such meeting to be notified in manner as aforesaid, by the Governor
or Commander in Chief of our said province for the time being.

And We also, for us, our heirs and successors, hereby will, give and grant unto the said trustees
of Dartmouth College aforesaid, and to their successors forever, that when any seven or more
of the said trustees or their successors are convened and met together for the service of said
Dartmouth College, at any time or times, such seven or more shall be capable to act as fully
and amply to all intents and purposes, as if all the trustees of said College were personally
present; and all affairs and actions whatsoever, under the care of said trustees, shall be
determined by the majority or greater number of those seven or more trustees, so convened and
met together.

And we do for us, our heirs and successors, hereby will, give and grant full power and authority
to the president, hereafter by us named, and to his successors, or in case of his failure,
to any three or more of said trustees, to appoint other occasional meetings, from time to time,
of the said seven trustees, or any greater number of them, to transact any matter or thing
necessary to be done, before the next annual meeting, and to order notice to the said seven
or any greater number of them, of the times and places of meetings for the services aforesaid,
by a letter under his or their hands of the same, one month before said meeting. Provided always,
that no standing rule or order be made or altered, for the regulation of said college, or any
president or professor be chosen or displaced, or any other matter or thing transacted or done,
which shall continue in force after the then next annual meeting of said trustees as aforesaid.

And further, We do by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, create, make, constitute,
nominate and appoint our trusty and well beloved Eleazar Wheelock, Doctor in Divinity, the
founder of said college, to be president of said Dartmouth College, and to have the immediate
care of the education and government of such students, as shall be admitted into said Dartmouth
College, for instruction and education; and do will, give and grant to him in said office,
full power, authority and right to nominate, appoint, constitute and ordain by his last will,
such suitable and meet person or persons as he shall choose, to succeed him in the presidency
of said Dartmouth College; and the person so appointed by his last will, to continue in office,
vested with all the powers, privileges, jurisdiction and authority of a president of said Dartmouth
College, that is to say, so long as until such appointment, by said last will, shall be disapproved
by the trustees of said Dartmouth College. And in case of the ceasing of a president as aforesaid,
the senior professor or tutor, being one of the trustees, shall exercise the office of a president,
until the trustees shall make choice of, and appoint a president as aforesaid; and such professor
or tutor, or any three or more of the trustees, shall immediately appoint a meeting of the
body of the trustees for the purpose aforesaid. And also, We do will, give and grant to the
said trustees, convened as aforesaid, that they elect, nominate and appoint, so many tutors
and professors, to assist the president in the education and government of the students belonging
thereto as they the said trustees shall, from time to time, and at any time think needful and
serviceable to the interests of said Dartmouth College. And also that the said trustees, or
their successors, or the major part of any seven or more of them, convened for that purpose
as above directed, shall at any time displace and discharge from the service of said Dartmouth
College, any or all such officers, and elect others in their room and stead as before directed.
And also that the said trustees or their successors, or the major part of any seven of them
which shall convene for that purpose as above directed, do from time to time as occasion shall
require, elect, constitute and appoint a treasurer, a clerk, an usher and a steward, for the
said Dartmouth College, and appoint to them, and each of them, their respective businesses
and trust; and displace and discharge from the service of said college, such treasurer, clerk,
usher or steward, and elect others in their room and stead; which officers so elected as before
directed, We do for us, our heirs and successors, by these presents constitute and establish
in their respective offices, and do give to each and every of them, full power and authority,
to exercise the same in said Dartmouth College, according to the directions and during the
pleasure of the said trustees, as fully and freely as any like officers in any of our universities,
colleges, or seminaries of learning, in our realm of Great Britain, lawfully may or ought to do.

And also, that the said trustees or their successors, or the major part of any seven or more
of them, which shall convene for that purpose, as is above directed, as often as one or more
of said trustees shall die, or by removal or otherwise shall, according to their judgment become
unfit or incapable to serve the interests of said college, do, as soon as may be, after the
death, removal, or such unfitness or incapacity of such trustee or trustees, elect and appoint
such trustee or trustees as shall supply the place of him or them so dying, or becoming incapable
to serve the interests of said college; and every trustee so elected and appointed, shall,
by virtue of these presents, and such election and appointment, be vested with all the powers
and privileges which any of the other trustees of said college are hereby vested with. And
We do further will, ordain and direct, that from and after the expiration of two years from
the enrolment of these presents, such vacancy or vacancies shall be filled up unto the complete
number of twelve Trustees, eight of the aforesaid whole number of the body of the trustees
shall be resident and respectable freeholders of our said Province of New Hampshire, and seven
of said whole number shall be laymen.

And We do further of our special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, will, give and grant
unto the said trustees of Dartmouth College that they and their successors, or the major part
of any seven of them which shall convene for that purpose as above directed, may make, and
they are hereby fully empowered from time to time fully and lawfully to make and establish
such ordinances, orders and laws, as may tend to the good and wholesome government of the said
College, and all the students and the several officers and ministers thereof, and to the public
benefit of the same, not repugnant to the laws and statutes of our realm of Great Britain or
of this our province of New Hampshire (and not excluding any person of any religious denomination
whatsoever from free and equal liberty and advantage of education, or from any of the liberties
and privileges or immunities of the said College on account of his or their speculative sentiments
in religion, and of his or their being of a religious profession different from the said Trustees
of the said Dartmouth College), and such ordinances, orders and laws which shall as aforesaid
be made, we do by these presents, for us, our heirs and successors, ratify, allow of and confirm,
as good and effectual to oblige and bind all the students and the several officers and ministers
of said College. And We do hereby authorize and empower the said Trustees of Dartmouth College,
and the president, tutors and professors by them elected and appointed as aforesaid, to put
such ordinances, laws and orders into execution to all intents and purposes.

And We do further of our special grace, certain knowledge and mere motion, for us, our heirs
and successors, by these presents give and grant unto the Trustees of said Dartmouth College
and to their successors, that they and their successors shall have a common seal under which
they may pass all diplomas or certificates of degrees, and all other affairs of business of
and concerning the said College, which shall be engraven in such form and with such an inscription
as shall be devised by the said Trustees for the time being, or by the major part of any seven
or more of them convened for the service of said College as is above directed.

And further, that the generous contributors to the support of this design of spreading the
knowledge of the only true God and Saviour among the American savages, may from time to time
be satisfied that their liberations are faithfully disposed of in the best manner for that
purpose, and that others may in future time be encouraged in the exercise of the like liberality
for promoting the same pious design; it shall be the duty of the President of said Dartmouth
College and of his successors, annually or as often as he shall be thereunto desired or requested,
to transmit to the Right Hon., Hon. and worthy Gentlemen of the trust in England before mentioned,
a faithful account of the improvements and disbursements of the several sums he shall receive
from the donations and bequests made in England through the hands of the said Trustees, and
also advise them of the general plans laid and prospects exhibited, as well as a faithful account
of all remarkable occurrences, in order if they shall think expedient that they may be published.
And this to continue so long as they shall perpetuate their board of Trust, and there shall
be any of the Indian natives remaining to be proper objects of that charity.

To have and to hold, all and singular the privileges, advantages, liberties, immunities, and
all other the premises herein and hereby granted and given, or which are meant, mentioned,
or intended to be herein and hereby given and granted unto them the said Trustees of Dartmouth
College and to their successors forever.

       *       *       *       *       *

In Testimony whereof We have caused these our letters to be made patent, and the public seal
of our said province of New Hampshire to be hereunto affixed.

Witness our trusty and well beloved John Wentworth, Esq., Governor and Commander in Chief in
and over our said Province, etc., this thirteenth day of December, in the tenth year of our
reign, and in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine.

    J. WENTWORTH.
