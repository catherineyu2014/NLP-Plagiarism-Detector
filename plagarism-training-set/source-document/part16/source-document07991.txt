CHARIVARIA.

"'Strike while the iron is hot' must be the motto," says a business man. Mr. SMILLIE, on the
other hand, says that it doesn't so much matter about the iron being hot.

       * * *

A curious story reaches us from the Midlands. It appears that it had been decided to call out
the workmen in a certain factory, but the strike-leader had unfortunately mislaid his notes
and could not remember their grievance.

       * * *

Mr. C.B. COCHRAN has decided to have nothing further to do with the promotion of boxing-matches
owing to the way in which contracts are continually being broken. It has since been reported
that several of our leading professional boxers are endeavouring to arrange a farewell disappointment.

       * * *

Mr. EVANS, the American golf champion, has invented a new putter. We appreciate America's effort,
but all the same we cannot forget her apathy toward the League of Nations.

       * * *

Last week the largest number of Alpinists ever assembled met on the top of the Matterhorn.
If this sort of thing goes on it is quite likely that the summit will have to be strengthened.

       * * *

Colder weather is promised and the close season for Councillor CLARK should commence about
October 1st.

       * * *

"The ex-Kaiser," says The Western Morning News, "goes in daily fear of being kidnapped." This
is said to be due to the presence at Amerongen of an enterprising party of American curio-hunters.

       * * *

A headline in a weekly paper asks, "What will Charlie Chaplin Turn out this Year?" "His feet,"
is the answer.

       * * *

The language at Billingsgate, according to Sir E.E. COOPER, is much better than it used to
be. Fish porters invariably say "Excuse me" before throwing a length of obsolete eel at a colleague.

       * * *

In the event of a miners' strike arrangements have been made for the staff of the Ministry
of Transport to sleep at the office. It would be more wise, we think, if they remained wide awake.

       * * *

A feature of the new motor charabanc will be the space for passengers' luggage. This is just
what is wanted, as it so easily gets broken even if the corks don't come out.

       * * *

A message from Allahabad states that the appointment of Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL as Viceroy of
India would be very popular. Unfortunately they omit to say where it would be popular.

       * * *

"Drink is Scotland's greatest sin," said a Prohibitionist speaker at Glasgow. The gentleman
does not seem to have heard of haggis.

       * * *

Asked what he would have, a Scotsman, taking advantage of its high price, replied, "A small
petrol, please."

       * * *

The National Gallery with its three thousand pictures is practically priceless, we are informed.
This probably accounts for the fact that the hall-porter invariably takes visitors' umbrellas
as security.

       * * *

What is now wanted, says a contemporary, is a good spell of fine weather. We feel that no good
can be done by rubbing it in like this. The Daily Mail is doing its best.

       * * *

We understand, by the way, that The Daily Mail has definitely decided not to offer a prize
of a hundred pounds for a new world, but to leave the matter entirely in the hands of Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE.

       * * *

The Astronomical Correspondent of The Times suggests that the new star may have been produced
through a sun being struck by a comet. This raises the question as to whether suns ought not
to carry rear lights.

       * * *

There is some talk of a series of week-end summers being arranged for next year.

       * * *

"If necessary I will walk from John-o'-Groats to Land's End, distributing propaganda literature
all the way," announced a well-known strike agitator at a recent conference. Personally we
do not mind if he does, provided that when he reaches Land's End he continues to walk in the
same direction.

       * * *

According to a weekly journal the art of camouflage played a most important part in recent
naval warfare. It is, of course, quite an open secret that the Naval authorities are aware
that one of our largest Dreadnoughts is somewhere in a certain English harbour, but, owing
to the excellence of its camouflage, they have not yet been able to locate it.

       * * *

We now learn that it was merely through an oversight that the pit ponies did not record their
votes at the strike ballot.

THE ASHES.

    [A final salutation to the M.C.C. team, from one who is destined
    to perish in the event of a coal strike.]

  O ship that farest forth, a greater Argo,
    Unto the homeland of the woolly fleece,
  Soft gales attend thee! may thy precious cargo
    Slide over oceans smoothed of every crease,
          So as the very flower, or pick,
  Of England's flanneled chivalry may not be sick!

  And thou, O gentle goddess Hygieia,
    Hover propitious o'er the vessel's poop;
  Keep them from chicken-pox and pyorrhoea,
    Measles and nettle-rash and mumps and croup;
          See they digest their food and drink,
  And land them, even as they leave us, in the pink!

  Thou, too, whose favour they depend so much on
    (Fortune, I mean) in this precarious game,
  Oh let there be no blob on their escutcheon,
    Or, if a few occur, accept the blame;
          Do not, of course, abuse thy powers;
  We'd have the best side win, but let that side be ours.

  Summer awaits them there while we are wheezing
    By empty hearths through bitter days and black;
  Yet we rejoice that, though we die of freezing
    And cannot get cremated, all for lack
          Of coal to feed our funeral pyres,
  Still "in our ashes [yonder] live their wonted fires."

O.S.

THE MINISTRY OF ANCESTRY.

"As you are aware," said a prominent official of the Ministry of Ancestry, "although our department
has only been in existence for a few months the profits have enabled the Government to take
twopence off the income-tax and to provide employment for thousands of deserving clerks dismissed,
in deference to public opinion, from other Government offices."

"Yes. Could you tell me how this brilliant scheme came into being?"

"The Chinese knew and practised it for centuries. Here the credit for its re-discovery must
be assigned to Sir Cuthbert Shover, who, owing to handsome contributions to necessary funds,
combined, of course, with meritorious public service during the War, was offered a baronetcy.
He refused it for himself, but accepted it for his aged father, thereby becoming second baronet
in three months. He deplored the fact that his grandfather was no longer eligible for the honour.
Then we saw light. Why should the mere accident of death prevent us from honouring a man if
his family were prepared to contribute towards the country's exchequer? But these letters will
give you a clearer insight into the working of the department."

The first letter was addressed to Miss Cannon, at Maidstone:--

    "DEAR MADAM,--We have no hesitation in advising you to have a
    bishop in your family. Few purchases give greater satisfaction.
    If, as you say, your late maternal grandfather was curate of
    Slowden, and was, as far as you are aware, a man of exemplary
    character, we could make him a bishop without delay. Your home
    being in Kent, it occurs to us that the see of Carlisle would suit
    the Right Reverend Prelate best. The cost of the proceedings,
    including a pre-dated Congé d'Élire, would be eight hundred
    guineas. An archbishopric would be slightly more expensive and, in
    our opinion, less suitable."

"Amazing," I said.

"But so simple. Here is a letter from a man who wants to have had forbears in the Navy. We say:--

    "'Naturally it would have been an advantage for your son, whom you
    destine for the Navy, to have had relations in that service. But
    it is not too late to remedy this defect.

    "'By virtue of the powers conferred upon us by Act of Parliament
    (Ancestry Act, 1922), we are prepared to give your sometime
    great-great-uncle William, who, according to family tradition,
    always wanted to go to sea, a commission in the Navy, and the
    rank of lieutenant, together with appointment to any ship of the
    line--with the exception of the Victory--which fought under Lord
    NELSON. The making out the commission will be put in hand on the
    receipt of your cheque for three hundred guineas.'"

"Do you always give satisfaction?"

"Occasionally we have to disappoint people. For instance, this letter to a lady at Plymouth:--

    "'We fear we cannot grant your request to reserve a berth on the
    Mayflower for your delightful ancestress, Mrs. Patience Loveday.
    The Mayflower is already overcrowded, and, owing to some
    ill-feeling raised in America, we decided to resign all interest
    in the vessel. Should you desire some other form of Puritan
    distinction how would you like to provide yourself with a
    non-juring clergyman as an ancestor? We could present any suitable
    departed member of your family to a Crown living, and supply
    you with an order of ejectment, dated the anniversary of St.
    Bartholomew's Day, 1662.'"

"Judging from the address on this letter, 'X. O'Finny, Esq.,' your jurisdiction extends to
Ireland?"

"Yes, Mr. O'Finny wants some persecuted ancestors. We offer to supply him with a member of
his family condemned to be beheaded by order of QUEEN ELIZABETH, price one thousand, which
includes a replica of the Great Seal of England; or, to have another member shot by order of
CROMWELL, at half the price; or a sentence of hanging in '98. This would be three hundred only.
We advise him to take the complete set at a reduction, and have no doubt we shall come to terms."

"Have you anything more expensive?" I asked timidly.

"Rather. Here is our answer to Lord--better not give the name, perhaps; the creation is recent.
He wished for a Crusader, but we explained that the Crusades were not under Government. We
offer to introduce his family name into our authorised supplement to the Domesday Book for
five thousand pounds. I call it cheap at the money. Now what can we do for you?"

"I must think it over," I stammered.

"Do. You will come back. Pair of Colours, now, for a great-great-grandfather. How would that
suit you? Only five hundred. Or a place at Court in the Regency? Or, if you wish good business
connection, a directorship of the East India Company? The whole of the past lies before you.
Give your children a fair start in life, that is what we say. Money is good, education is better,
but distinguished ancestry is best of all."
