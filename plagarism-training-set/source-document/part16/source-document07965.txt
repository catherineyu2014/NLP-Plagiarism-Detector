To speak in the style of the period, the meeting just described took place in the year of Rome
747. The month was December, and winter reigned over all the regions east of the Mediterranean.
Such as ride upon the desert in this season go not far until smitten with a keen appetite.
The company under the little tent were not exceptions to the rule. They were hungry, and ate
heartily; and, after the wine, they talked.

"To a wayfarer in a strange land nothing is so sweet as to hear his name on the tongue of a
friend," said the Egyptian, who assumed to be president of the repast. "Before us lie many
days of companionship. It is time we knew each other. So, if it be agreeable, he who came last
shall be first to speak."

Then, slowly at first, like one watchful of himself, the Greek began:

"What I have to tell, my brethren, is so strange that I hardly know where to begin or what
I may with propriety speak. I do not yet understand myself. The most I am sure of is that I
am doing a Master's will, and that the service is a constant ecstasy. When I think of the purpose
I am sent to fulfil, there is in me a joy so inexpressible that I know the will is God's."

The good man paused, unable to proceed, while the others, in sympathy with his feelings, dropped
their gaze.

"Far to the west of this," he began again, "there is a land which may never be forgotten; if
only because the world is too much its debtor, and because the indebtedness is for things that
bring to men their purest pleasures. I will say nothing of the arts, nothing of philosophy,
of eloquence, of poetry, of war: O my brethren, hers is the glory which must shine forever
in perfected letters, by which He we go to find and proclaim will be made known to all the
earth. The land I speak of is Greece. I am Gaspar, son of Cleanthes the Athenian.

"My people," he continued, "were given wholly to study, and from them I derived the same passion.
It happens that two of our philosophers, the very greatest of the many, teach, one the doctrine
of a Soul in every man, and its Immortality; the other the doctrine of One God, infinitely
just. From the multitude of subjects about which the schools were disputing, I separated them,
as alone worth the labor of solution; for I thought there was a relation between God and the
soul as yet unknown. On this theme the mind can reason to a point, a dead, impassable wall;
arrived there, all that remains is to stand and cry aloud for help. So I did; but no voice
came to me over the wall. In despair, I tore myself from the cities and the schools."

At these words a grave smile of approval lighted the gaunt face of the Hindoo.

"In the northern part of my country--in Thessaly," the Greek proceeded to say, "there is a
mountain famous as the home of the gods, where Theus, whom my countrymen believe supreme, has
his abode; Olympus is its name. Thither I betook myself. I found a cave in a hill where the
mountain, coming from the west, bends to the southeast; there I dwelt, giving myself up to
meditation--no, I gave myself up to waiting for what every breath was a prayer--for revelation.
Believing in God, invisible yet supreme, I also believed it possible so to yearn for him with
all my soul that he would take compassion and give me answer."

"And he did--he did!" exclaimed the Hindoo, lifting his hands from the silken cloth upon his lap.

"Hear me, brethren," said the Greek, calming himself with an effort. "The door of my hermitage
looks over an arm of the sea, over the Thermaic Gulf. One day I saw a man flung overboard from
a ship sailing by. He swam ashore. I received and took care of him. He was a Jew, learned in
the history and laws of his people; and from him I came to know that the God of my prayers
did indeed exist; and had been for ages their lawmaker, ruler, and king. What was that but
the Revelation I dreamed of? My faith had not been fruitless; God answered me!"

"As he does all who cry to him with such faith," said the Hindoo.

"But, alas!" the Egyptian added, "how few are there wise enough to know when he answers them!"

"That was not all," the Greek continued. "The man so sent to me told me more. He said the prophets
who, in the ages which followed the first revelation, walked and talked with God, declared
he would come again. He gave me the names of the prophets, and from the sacred books quoted
their very language. He told me, further, that the second coming was at hand--was looked for
momentarily in Jerusalem."

The Greek paused, and the brightness of his countenance faded.

"It is true," he said, after a little--"it is true the man told me that as God and the revelation
of which he spoke had been for the Jews alone, so it would be again. He that was to come should
be King of the Jews. 'Had he nothing for the rest of the world?' I asked. 'No,' was the answer,
given in a proud voice--'No, we are his chosen people.' The answer did not crush my hope. Why
should such a God limit his love and benefaction to one land, and, as it were, to one family?
I set my heart upon knowing. At last I broke through the man's pride, and found that his fathers
had been merely chosen servants to keep the Truth alive, that the world might at last know
it and be saved. When the Jew was gone, and I was alone again, I chastened my soul with a new
prayer--that I might be permitted to see the King when he was come, and worship him. One night
I sat by the door of my cave trying to get nearer the mysteries of my existence, knowing which
is to know God; suddenly, on the sea below me, or rather in the darkness that covered its face,
I saw a star begin to burn; slowly it arose and drew nigh, and stood over the hill and above
my door, so that its light shone full upon me. I fell down, and slept, and in my dream I heard
a voice say:

"'O Gaspar! Thy faith hath conquered! Blessed art thou! With two others, come from the uttermost
parts of the earth, thou shalt see Him that is promised, and be a witness for him, and the
occasion of testimony in his behalf. In the morning arise, and go meet them, and keep trust
in the Spirit that shall guide thee.'

"And in the morning I awoke with the Spirit as a light within me surpassing that of the sun.
I put off my hermit's garb, and dressed myself as of old. From a hiding-place I took the treasure
which I had brought from the city. A ship went sailing past. I hailed it, was taken aboard,
and landed at Antioch. There I bought the camel and his furniture. Through the gardens and
orchards that enamel the banks of the Orontes, I journeyed to Emesa, Damascus, Bostra, and
Philadelphia; thence hither. And so, O brethren, you have my story. Let me now listen to you."

CHAPTER IV

The Egyptian and the Hindoo looked at each other; the former waved his hand; the latter bowed,
and began:

"Our brother has spoken well. May my words be as wise."

He broke off, reflected a moment, then resumed:

"You may know me, brethren, by the name of Melchior. I speak to you in a language which, if
not the oldest in the world, was at least the soonest to be reduced to letters--I mean the
Sanscrit of India. I am a Hindoo by birth. My people were the first to walk in the fields of
knowledge, first to divide them, first to make them beautiful. Whatever may hereafter befall,
the four Vedas must live, for they are the primal fountains of religion and useful intelligence.
From them were derived the Upa-Vedas, which, delivered by Brahma, treat of medicine, archery,
architecture, music, and the four-and-sixty mechanical arts; the Ved-Angas, revealed by inspired
saints, and devoted to astronomy, grammar, prosody, pronunciation, charms and incantations,
religious rites and ceremonies; the Up-Angas, written by the sage Vyasa, and given to cosmogony,
chronology, and geography; therein also are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, heroic poems,
designed for the perpetuation of our gods and demi-gods. Such, O brethren, are the Great Shastras,
or books of sacred ordinances. They are dead to me now; yet through all time they will serve
to illustrate the budding genius of my race. They were promises of quick perfection. Ask you
why the promises failed? Alas! the books themselves closed all the gates of progress. Under
pretext of care for the creature, their authors imposed the fatal principle that a man must
not address himself to discovery or invention, as Heaven had provided him all things needful.
When that condition became a sacred law, the lamp of Hindoo genius was let down a well, where
ever since it has lighted narrow walls and bitter waters.

"These allusions, brethren, are not from pride, as you will understand when I tell you that
the Shastras teach a Supreme God called Brahm; also, that the Puranas, or sacred poems of the
Up-Angas, tell us of Virtue and Good Works, and of the Soul. So, if my brother will permit
the saying"--the speaker bowed deferentially to the Greek--"ages before his people were known,
the two great ideas, God and the Soul, had absorbed all the forces of the Hindoo mind. In further
explanation let me say that Brahm is taught, by the same sacred books, as a Triad--Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva. Of these, Brahma is said to have been the author of our race; which, in
course of creation, he divided into four castes. First, he peopled the worlds below and the
heavens above; next, he made the earth ready for terrestrial spirits; then from his mouth proceeded
the Brahman caste, nearest in likeness to himself, highest and noblest, sole teachers of the
Vedas, which at the same time flowed from his lips in finished state, perfect in all useful
knowledge. From his arms next issued the Kshatriya, or warriors; from his breast, the seat
of life, came the Vaisya, or producers--shepherds, farmers, merchants; from his foot, in sign
of degradation, sprang the Sudra, or serviles, doomed to menial duties for the other classes--serfs,
domestics, laborers, artisans. Take notice, further, that the law, so born with them, forbade
a man of one caste becoming a member of another; the Brahman could not enter a lower order;
if he violated the laws of his own grade, he became an outcast, lost to all but outcasts like
himself."

At this point, the imagination of the Greek, flashing forward upon all the consequences of
such a degradation, overcame his eager attention, and he exclaimed, "In such a state, O brethren,
what mighty need of a loving God!"

"Yes," added the Egyptian, "of a loving God like ours."

The brows of the Hindoo knit painfully; when the emotion was spent, he proceeded, in a softened
voice.

"I was born a Brahman. My life, consequently, was ordered down to its least act, its last hour.
My first draught of nourishment; the giving me my compound name; taking me out the first time
to see the sun; investing me with the triple thread by which I became one of the twice-born;
my induction into the first order--were all celebrated with sacred texts and rigid ceremonies.
I might not walk, eat, drink, or sleep without danger of violating a rule. And the penalty,
O brethren, the penalty was to my soul! According to the degrees of omission, my soul went
to one of the heavens--Indra's the lowest, Brahma's the highest; or it was driven back to become
the life of a worm, a fly, a fish, or a brute. The reward for perfect observance was Beatitude,
or absorption into the being of Brahm, which was not existence as much as absolute rest."

The Hindoo gave himself a moment's thought; proceeding, he said: "The part of a Brahman's life
called the first order is his student life. When I was ready to enter the second order--that
is to say, when I was ready to marry and become a householder--I questioned everything, even
Brahm; I was a heretic. From the depths of the well I had discovered a light above, and yearned
to go up and see what all it shone upon. At last--ah, with what years of toil!--I stood in
the perfect day, and beheld the principle of life, the element of religion, the link between
the soul and God--Love!"

The shrunken face of the good man kindled visibly, and he clasped his hands with force. A silence
ensued, during which the others looked at him, the Greek through tears. At length he resumed:

"The happiness of love is in action; its test is what one is willing to do for others. I could
not rest. Brahm had filled the world with so much wretchedness. The Sudra appealed to me, so
did the countless devotees and victims. The island of Ganga Lagor lies where the sacred waters
of the Ganges disappear in the Indian Ocean. Thither I betook myself. In the shade of the temple
built there to the sage Kapila, in a union of prayers with the disciples whom the sanctified
memory of the holy man keeps around his house, I thought to find rest. But twice every year
came pilgrimages of Hindoos seeking the purification of the waters. Their misery strengthened
my love. Against its impulse to speak I clenched my jaws; for one word against Brahm or the
Triad or the Shastras would doom me; one act of kindness to the outcast Brahmans who now and
then dragged themselves to die on the burning sands--a blessing said, a cup of water given--and
I became one of them, lost to family, country, privileges, caste. The love conquered! I spoke
to the disciples in the temple; they drove me out. I spoke to the pilgrims; they stoned me
from the island. On the highways I attempted to preach; my hearers fled from me, or sought
my life. In all India, finally, there was not a place in which I could find peace or safety--not
even among the outcasts, for, though fallen, they were still believers in Brahm. In my extremity,
I looked for a solitude in which to hide from all but God. I followed the Ganges to its source,
far up in the Himalayas. When I entered the pass at Hurdwar, where the river, in unstained
purity, leaps to its course through the muddy lowlands, I prayed for my race, and thought myself
lost to them forever. Through gorges, over cliffs, across glaciers, by peaks that seemed star-high,
I made my way to the Lang Tso, a lake of marvellous beauty, asleep at the feet of the Tise
Gangri, the Gurla, and the Kailas Parbot, giants which flaunt their crowns of snow everlastingly
in the face of the sun. There, in the centre of the earth, where the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmapootra
rise to run their different courses; where mankind took up their first abode, and separated
to replete the world, leaving Balk, the mother of cities, to attest the great fact; where Nature,
gone back to its primeval condition, and secure in its immensities, invites the sage and the
exile, with promise of safety to the one and solitude to the other--there I went to abide alone
with God, praying, fasting, waiting for death."

Again the voice fell, and the bony hands met in a fervent clasp.

"One night I walked by the shores of the lake, and spoke to the listening silence, 'When will
God come and claim his own? Is there to be no redemption?' Suddenly a light began to glow tremulously
out on the water; soon a star arose, and moved towards me, and stood overhead. The brightness
stunned me. While I lay upon the ground, I heard a voice of infinite sweetness say, 'Thy love
hath conquered. Blessed art thou, O son of India! The redemption is at hand. With two others,
from far quarters of the earth, thou shalt see the Redeemer, and be a witness that he hath
come. In the morning arise, and go meet them; and put all thy trust in the Spirit which shall
guide thee.'

"And from that time the light has stayed with me; so I knew it was the visible presence of
the Spirit. In the morning I started to the world by the way I had come. In a cleft of the
mountain I found a stone of vast worth, which I sold in Hurdwar. By Lahore, and Cabool, and
Yezd, I came to Ispahan. There I bought the camel, and thence was led to Bagdad, not waiting
for caravans. Alone I traveled, fearless, for the Spirit was with me, and is with me yet. What
glory is ours, O brethren! We are to see the Redeemer--to speak to him--to worship him! I am done."

CHAPTER V

The vivacious Greek broke forth in expressions of joy and congratulations; after which the
Egyptian said, with characteristic gravity:

"I salute you, my brother. You have suffered much, and I rejoice in your triumph. If you are
both pleased to hear me, I will now tell you who I am, and how I came to be called. Wait for
me a moment."

He went out and tended the camels; coming back, he resumed his seat.

"Your words, brethren, were of the Spirit," he said, in commencement; "and the Spirit gives
me to understand them. You each spoke particularly of your countries; in that there was a great
object, which I will explain; but to make the interpretation complete, let me first speak of
myself and my people. I am Balthasar the Egyptian."

The last words were spoken quietly, but with so much dignity that both listeners bowed to the
speaker.

"There are many distinctions I might claim for my race," he continued; "but I will content
myself with one. History began with us. We were the first to perpetuate events by records kept.
So we have no traditions; and instead of poetry, we offer you certainty. On the facades of
palaces and temples, on obelisks, on the inner walls of tombs, we wrote the names of our kings,
and what they did; and to the delicate papyri we intrusted the wisdom of our philosophers and
the secrets of our religion--all the secrets but one, whereof I will presently speak. Older
than the Vedas of Para-Brahm or the Up-Angas of Vyasa, O Melchior; older than the songs of
Homer or the metaphysics of Plato, O my Gaspar; older than the sacred books or kings of the
people of China, or those of Siddartha, son of the beautiful Maya; older than the Genesis of
Mosche the Hebrew--oldest of human records are the writings of Menes, our first king." Pausing
an instant, he fixed his large eves kindly upon the Greek, saying, "In the youth of Hellas,
who, O Gaspar, were the teachers of her teachers?"

The Greek bowed, smiling.

"By those records," Balthasar continued, "we know that when the fathers came from the far East,
from the region of the birth of the three sacred rivers, from the centre of the earth--the
Old Iran of which you spoke, O Melchior--came bringing with them the history of the world before
the Flood, and of the Flood itself, as given to the Aryans by the sons of Noah, they taught
God, the Creator and the Beginning, and the Soul, deathless as God. When the duty which calls
us now is happily done, if you choose to go with me, I will show you the sacred library of
our priesthood; among others, the Book of the Dead, in which is the ritual to be observed by
the soul after Death has despatched it on its journey to judgment. The ideas--God and the Immortal
Soul--were borne to Mizraim over the desert, and by him to the banks of the Nile. They were
then in their purity, easy of understanding, as what God intends for our happiness always is;
so, also, was the first worship--a song and a prayer natural to a soul joyous, hopeful, and
in love with its Maker."

Here the Greek threw up his hands, exclaiming, "Oh! the light deepens within me!"

"And in me!" said the Hindoo, with equal fervor.

The Egyptian regarded them benignantly, then went on, saying, "Religion is merely the law which
binds man to his Creator: in purity it has but these elements--God, the Soul, and their Mutual
Recognition; out of which, when put in practise, spring Worship, Love, and Reward. This law,
like all others of divine origin--like that, for instance, which binds the earth to the sun--was
perfected in the beginning by its Author. Such, my brothers, was the religion of the first
family; such was the religion of our father Mizraim, who could not have been blind to the formula
of creation, nowhere so discernible as in the first faith and the earliest worship. Perfection
is God; simplicity is perfection. The curse of curses is that men will not let truths like
these alone."

He stopped, as if considering in what manner to continue.

"Many nations have loved the sweet waters of the Nile," he said next; "the Ethiopian, the Pali-Putra,
the Hebrew, the Assyrian, the Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman--of whom all, except the Hebrew,
have at one time or another been its masters. So much coming and going of peoples corrupted
the old Mizraimic faith. The Valley of Palms became a Valley of Gods. The Supreme One was divided
into eight, each personating a creative principle in nature, with Ammon-Re at the head. Then
Isis and Osiris, and their circle, representing water, fire, air, and other forces, were invented.
Still the multiplication went on until we had another order, suggested by human qualities,
such as strength, knowledge, love, and the like."

"In all which there was the old folly!" cried the Greek, impulsively. "Only the things out
of reach remain as they came to us."

The Egyptian bowed, and proceeded:

"Yet a little further, O my brethren, a little further, before I come to myself. What we go
to will seem all the holier of comparison with what is and has been. The records show that
Mizraim found the Nile in possession of the Ethiopians, who were spread thence through the
African desert; a people of rich, fantastic genius, wholly given to the worship of nature.
The Poetic Persian sacrificed to the sun, as the completest image of Ormuzd, his God; the devout
children of the far East carved their deities out of wood and ivory; but the Ethiopian, without
writing, without books, without mechanical faculty of any kind, quieted his soul by the worship
of animals, birds, and insects, holding the cat sacred to Re, the bull to Isis, the beetle
to Pthah. A long struggle against their rude faith ended in its adoption as the religion of
the new empire. Then rose the mighty monuments that cumber the river-bank and the desert--obelisk,
labyrinth, pyramid, and tomb of king, blent with tomb of crocodile. Into such deep debasement,
O brethren, the sons of the Aryan fell!"

Here, for the first time, the calmness of the Egyptian forsook him: though his countenance
remained impassive, his voice gave way.

"Do not too much despise my countrymen," he began again. "They did not all forget God. I said
awhile ago, you may remember, that to papyri we intrusted all the secrets of our religion except
one; of that I will now tell you. We had as king once a certain Pharaoh, who lent himself to
all manner of changes and additions. To establish the new system, he strove to drive the old
entirely out of mind. The Hebrews then dwelt with us as slaves. They clung to their God; and
when the persecution became intolerable, they were delivered in a manner never to be forgotten.
I speak from the records now. Mosche, himself a Hebrew, came to the palace, and demanded permission
for the slaves, then millions in number, to leave the country. The demand was in the name of
the Lord God of Israel. Pharaoh refused. Hear what followed. First, all the water, that in
the lakes and rivers, like that in the wells and vessels, turned to blood. Yet the monarch
refused. Then frogs came up and covered all the land. Still he was firm. Then Mosche threw
ashes in the air, and a plague attacked the Egyptians. Next, all the cattle, except of the
Hebrews, were struck dead. Locusts devoured the green things of the valley. At noon the day
was turned into a darkness so thick that lamps would not burn. Finally, in the night all the
first-born of the Egyptians died; not even Pharaoh's escaped. Then he yielded. But when the
Hebrews were gone he followed them with his army. At the last moment the sea was divided, so
that the fugitives passed it dry-shod. When the pursuers drove in after them, the waves rushed
back and drowned horse, foot, charioteers, and king. You spoke of revelation, my Gaspar--"

The blue eyes of the Greek sparkled.

"I had the story from the Jew," he cried. "You confirm it, O Balthasar!"

"Yes, but through me Egypt speaks, not Mosche. I interpret the marbles. The priests of that
time wrote in their way what they witnessed, and the revelation has lived. So I come to the
one unrecorded secret. In my country, brethren, we have, from the day of the unfortunate Pharaoh,
always had two religions--one private, the other public; one of many gods, practised by the
people; the other of one God, cherished only by the priesthood. Rejoice with me, O brothers!
All the trampling by the many nations, all the harrowing by kings, all the inventions of enemies,
all the changes of time, have been in vain. Like a seed under the mountains waiting its hour,
the glorious Truth has lived; and this--this is its day!"

The wasted frame of the Hindoo trembled with delight, and the Greek cried aloud,

"It seems to me the very desert is singing."

From a gurglet of water near-by the Egyptian took a draught, and proceeded:

"I was born at Alexandria, a prince and a priest, and had the education usual to my class.
But very early I became discontented. Part of the faith imposed was that after death upon the
destruction of the body, the soul at once began its former progression from the lowest up to
humanity, the highest and last existence; and that without reference to conduct in the mortal
life. When I heard of the Persian's Realm of Light, his Paradise across the bridge Chinevat,
where only the good go, the thought haunted me; insomuch that in the day, as in the night,
I brooded over the comparative ideas Eternal Transmigration and Eternal Life in Heaven. If,
as my teacher taught, God was just, why was there no distinction between the good and the bad?
At length it became clear to me, a certainty, a corollary of the law to which I reduced pure
religion, that death was only the point of separation at which the wicked are left or lost,
and the faithful rise to a higher life; not the nirvana of Buddha, or the negative rest of
Brahma, O Melchior; nor the better condition in hell, which is all of Heaven allowed by the
Olympic faith, O Gaspar; but life--life active, joyous, everlasting--LIFE WITH GOD! The discovery
led to another inquiry. Why should the Truth be longer kept a secret for the selfish solace
of the priesthood? The reason for the suppression was gone. Philosophy had at least brought
us toleration. In Egypt we had Rome instead of Rameses. One day, in the Brucheium, the most
splendid and crowded quarter of Alexandria, I arose and preached. The East and West contributed
to my audience. Students going to the Library, priests from the Serapeion, idlers from the
Museum, patrons of the race-course, countrymen from the Rhacotis--a multitude--stopped to hear
me. I preached God, the Soul, Right and Wrong, and Heaven, the reward of a virtuous life. You,
O Melchior, were stoned; my auditors first wondered, then laughed. I tried again; they pelted
me with epigrams, covered my God with ridicule, and darkened my Heaven with mockery. Not to
linger needlessly, I fell before them."

The Hindoo here drew a long sigh, as he said, "The enemy of man is man, my brother."

Balthasar lapsed into silence.

"I gave much thought to finding the cause of my failure, and at last succeeded," he said, upon
beginning again. "Up the river, a day's journey from the city, there is a village of herdsmen
and gardeners. I took a boat and went there. In the evening I called the people together, men
and women, the poorest of the poor. I preached to them exactly as I had preached in the Brucheium.
They did not laugh. Next evening I spoke again, and they believed and rejoiced, and carried
the news abroad. At the third meeting a society was formed for prayer. I returned to the city
then. Drifting down the river, under the stars, which never seemed so bright and so near, I
evolved this lesson: To begin a reform, go not into the places of the great and rich; go rather
to those whose cups of happiness are empty--to the poor and humble. And then I laid a plan
and devoted my life. As a first step, I secured my vast property, so that the income would
be certain, and always at call for the relief of the suffering. From that day, O brethren,
I travelled up and down the Nile, in the villages, and to all the tribes, preaching One God,
a righteous life, and reward in Heaven. I have done good--it does not become me to say how
much. I also know that part of the world to be ripe for the reception of Him we go to find."

A flush suffused the swarthy cheek of the speaker; but he overcame the feeling, and continued:

"The years so given, O my brothers, were troubled by one thought--When I was gone, what would
become of the cause I had started? Was it to end with me? I had dreamed many times of organization
as a fitting crown for my work. To hide nothing from you, I had tried to effect it, and failed.
Brethren, the world is now in the condition that, to restore the old Mizraimic faith, the reformer
must have a more than human sanction; he must not merely come in God's name, he must have the
proofs subject to his word; he must demonstrate all he says, even God. So preoccupied is the
mind with myths and systems; so much do false deities crowd every place--earth, air, sky; so
have they become of everything a part, that return to the first religion can only be along
bloody paths, through fields of persecution; that is to say, the converts must be willing to
die rather than recant. And who in this age can carry the faith of men to such a point but
God himself? To redeem the race--I do not mean to destroy it--to REDEEM the race, he must make
himself once more manifest; HE MUST COME IN PERSON."

Intense emotion seized the three.

"Are we not going to find him?" exclaimed the Greek.

"You understand why I failed in the attempt to organize," said the Egyptian, when the spell
was past. "I had not the sanction. To know that my work must be lost made me intolerably wretched.
I believed in prayer, and to make my appeals pure and strong, like you, my brethren, I went
out of the beaten ways, I went where man had not been, where only God was. Above the fifth
cataract, above the meeting of rivers in Sennar, up the Bahr el Abiad, into the far unknown
of Africa, I went. There, in the morning, a mountain blue as the sky flings a cooling shadow
wide over the western desert, and, with its cascades of melted snow, feeds a broad lake nestling
at its base on the east. The lake is the mother of the great river. For a year and more the
mountain gave me a home. The fruit of the palm fed my body, prayer my spirit. One night I walked
in the orchard close by the little sea. 'The world is dying. When wilt thou come? Why may I
not see the redemption, O God?' So I prayed. The glassy water was sparkling with stars. One
of them seemed to leave its place, and rise to the surface, where it became a brilliancy burning
to the eyes. Then it moved towards me, and stood over my head, apparently in hand's reach.
I fell down and hid my face. A voice, not of the earth, said, 'Thy good works have conquered.
Blessed art thou, O son of Mizraim! The redemption cometh. With two others, from the remotenesses
of the world, thou shalt see the Saviour, and testify for him. It led me down the river to
Memphis, where I made ready for the desert. I bought my camel, and came hither without rest,
by way of Suez and Kufileh, and up through the lands of Moab and Ammon. God is with us, O my
brethren!"

He paused, and thereupon, with a prompting not their own, they all arose, and looked at each other.

"I said there was a purpose in the particularity with which we described our people and their
histories," so the Egyptian proceeded. "He we go to find was called 'King of the Jews;' by
that name we are bidden to ask for him. But, now that we have met, and heard from each other,
we may know him to be the Redeemer, not of the Jews alone, but of all the nations of the earth.
The patriarch who survived the Flood had with him three sons, and their families, by whom the
world was repeopled. From the old Aryana-Vaejo, the well-remembered Region of Delight in the
heart of Asia, they parted. India and the far East received the children of the first; the
descendant of the youngest, through the North, streamed into Europe; those of the second overflowed
the deserts about the Red Sea, passing into Africa; and though most of the latter are yet dwellers
in shifting tents, some of them became builders along the Nile."

By a simultaneous impulse the three joined hands.

"Could anything be more divinely ordered?" Balthasar continued. "When we have found the Lord,
the brothers, and all the generations that have succeeded them, will kneel to him in homage
with us. And when we part to go our separate ways, the world will have learned a new lesson--that
Heaven may be won, not by the sword, not by human wisdom, but by Faith, Love, and Good Works."

There was silence, broken by sighs and sanctified with tears; for the joy that filled them
might not be stayed. It was the unspeakable joy of souls on the shores of the River of Life,
resting with the Redeemed in God's presence.

Presently their hands fell apart, and together they went out of the tent. The desert was still
as the sky. The sun was sinking fast. The camels slept.

A little while after, the tent was struck, and, with the remains of the repast, restored to
the cot; then the friends mounted, and set out single file, led by the Egyptian. Their course
was due west, into the chilly night. The camels swung forward in steady trot, keeping the line
and the intervals so exactly that those following seemed to tread in the tracks of the leader.
The riders spoke not once.

By-and-by the moon came up. And as the three tall white figures sped, with soundless tread,
through the opalescent light, they appeared like specters flying from hateful shadows. Suddenly,
in the air before them, not farther up than a low hill-top flared a lambent flame; as they
looked at it, the apparition contracted into a focus of dazzling lustre. Their hearts beat
fast; their souls thrilled; and they shouted as with one voice, "The Star! the Star! God is
with us!"
