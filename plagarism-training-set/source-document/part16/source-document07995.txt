AMERICAN FINANCES AND RESOURCES.

LETTER NO. III. OF HON. ROBERT J. WALKER.

                          LONDON, 10 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly,
                                          December 3d, 1863.

It is generally believed, even when the American rebellion should be suppressed, that there
would be a great loss of wealth and resources on the part of the United States. As an economical
question the great truth is not disputed by me, that, as a general rule, wars by a waste of
property, by large expenditures, and by the withdrawal of so much labor from the pursuits of
industry, impair the material interests of the nation. The influence of such considerations
in the United States is not denied; but there are in the cause of this contest, as well as
in its effects and consequences, results which will more than compensate for such losses. Slavery
was the sole cause of this rebellion, and the result will be the reconstruction of the Union,
with slavery everywhere extinguished. On this assumption, the question is, whether the substitution
of free for slave labor throughout every State and Territory of the Union will not, as a question
of augmented wealth and invigorated industry, far more than compensate for the losses incurred
in the contest. Reasoning inductively, it might well be supposed that the willing labor of
educated and energetic freemen would be far more productive than the forced labor of ignorant,
unwilling, and uneducated slaves. In the realm of science, as well as in the direction of labor,
knowledge is power, education is wealth and progress; and that this is applicable to the masses
who compose a community, and especially to the working classes, is demonstrated by our American
official Census. In proof of this position, I will proceed by a reference to the official tables
of our Census of 1860, to show not only in particular Slave States, as compared with other
Free States, whether old or new, Eastern or Western, or making the comparison of the aggregate
of all the Slave with the Free States, the annual product of the latter per capita is more
than double that of the Slave States. I begin with Maryland as compared with Massachusetts,
because Maryland, in proportion to her area, has greater natural advantages than any one of
the Slave or Free States; and if the comparison with the Free States is most unfavorable to
her, it will be more so as to any other Southern State; as the Census shows that, from 1790
to 1860, as well as from 1850 to 1860, Maryland increased in population per square mile more
rapidly than any other slaveholding State.

We must consider the area, soil, climate, mines, hydraulic power, location, shore line, bays,
sounds, and rivers, and such other causes as affect the advance of wealth and population.

The relative progress of Maryland has been slow indeed. The population of the Union, by the
Census of 1790, was 3,929,827, of which Maryland, containing then 319,728, constituted a twelfth
part (12.29). In 1860, the Union numbered 31,445,080, and Maryland 687,034, constituting a
forty-fifth part (45.76). In 1790, the Free States numbered 1,968,455, Maryland's population
then being equal to one sixth (6.12); but, in 1860, the population of the Free States was 18,920,078,
Maryland's number then being equal to one twenty-seventh part (27.52). But, if Maryland had
increased as rapidly from 1790 to 1860 as the whole Union, her proportion, one twelfth part,
would have made her numbers in 1860, 2,620,315; and if her proportional increase had equalled
that of the Free States, her ratio, one sixth, would have made her population in 1860, 3,153,392.

I take the areas from the report (November 29, 1860) of the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, where they are for the first time accurately given, 'excluding the water surface.'
The population is taken from the Census Tables. I compare first Massachusetts and Maryland,
because they are maritime and old States, and both in 1790 had nearly the same population,
but, as will be shown hereafter, with vastly superior natural advantages in favor of Maryland.

Area of Maryland, 11,124 square miles; shore lines, by tables of United States Coast Survey,
viz.: main shore, including bays, sounds, etc., 503 miles, islands 298, rivers to head of tide
water 535; total, 1,336 miles. When we mark the Potomac and its tributaries, the lower Susquehanna,
the deep and numerous streams of the Chesapeake, the commercial advantages of Maryland over
Massachusetts are vast indeed. Looking at the ocean shore of Maryland, and also at the Chesapeake
Bay, the largest and finest estuary in the world, indented with numerous sounds and navigable
inlets, three fourths of its length for both shores being within Maryland, and comparing this
deep and tranquil and protected basin, almost one continuous harbor, with the rockbound coast
of Massachusetts, lashed by the stormy Atlantic, the superiority of Maryland is striking.

Mortality in Maryland, by the late Census, viz., deaths from 1st June, 1859, to 31st May, 1860,
7,370 persons. Same time in Massachusetts, 21,303; making the ratio of deaths to the number
living in Maryland, one to every 92, and in Massachusetts one to every 57; and the percentage
of deaths in Maryland 1.09, and in Massachusetts 1.76. This rate of mortality for Massachusetts
is confirmed by the late official report of their Secretary of State to the Legislature.

As to area, then, Maryland exceeds Massachusetts 43 per cent.; as to the shore line, that of
Maryland is nearly double that of Massachusetts. As to climate, that of Maryland, we have seen,
is far the most salubrious. This is a vast advantage, not only in augmented wealth and numbers,
from fewer deaths, but also as attracting capital and immigration. This milder and more salubrious
climate gives to Maryland longer periods for sowing, working, and harvesting crops, a more
genial sun, larger products, and better and longer crop seasons, great advantages for stock,
especially in winter, decreased consumption of fuel, a greater period for the use of hydraulic
power, and of canals and navigable streams. The area of Maryland fit for profitable culture
is more than double that of Massachusetts, the soil much more fertile, its mines of coal and
iron, with the fluxes all adjacent, rich and inexhaustible; whereas Massachusetts has no coal,
and no valuable mines of iron or fluxes. When we reflect that coal and iron are the great elements
of modern progress, and build up mighty empires, this advantage of Maryland over Massachusetts
is almost incalculable. The hydraulic power of Maryland also greatly exceeds that of Massachusetts.
Such are the vast natural advantages of Maryland over Massachusetts. Now let us observe the
results. Population of Maryland in 1790, 319,728; in 1860, 687,034; increase, 367,300. Population
of Massachusetts in 1790, 378,717; in 1860, 1,231,065; increase, 852,348; difference of increase
in favor of Massachusetts, 485,048; excess of Massachusetts over Maryland in 1790, 58,989,
and in 1860, 544,031. This result is amazing, when we regard the far greater area of Maryland
and her other vast natural advantages. The population of Maryland in 1790 was 28 to the square
mile (28.74), and in 1860, 61 to the square mile (61.76); whereas Massachusetts had 48 to the
square mile in 1790 (48.55), and 157 to the square mile in 1860 (157.82). Thus Massachusetts
had only 20 more to the square mile in 1790, and 96 more to the square mile in 1860. But if
the area of Maryland and Massachusetts had been reversed, Massachusetts with the area of Maryland,
and the population of Massachusetts of 1860 to the square mile, would have numbered then 1,755,661,
and Maryland with the area of Massachusetts, and the population of Maryland of 1860 to the
square mile, would have had then a population of only 481,728 upon that basis, leaving Massachusetts
in 1860, 1,273,393 more people than Maryland.

By the census of 1790, Massachusetts was the fourth in population of all the States, and Maryland
the sixth; but in 1860, Massachusetts was the seventh, and Maryland the nineteenth; and if
each of the thirty-four States increases in the same ratio from 1860 to 1870 as from 1850 to
1860, Maryland will be only the twenty-fifth State.

These facts all conclusively attest the terrible effects of slavery on Maryland, and this is
only one of the dreadful sacrifices she has made in retaining the institution. As to wealth,
power, and intellectual development, the loss cannot be overstated.

Nor can manufactures account for the difference, as shown by the still greater increase of
the agricultural Northwest. Besides, Maryland (omitting slavery) had far greater natural advantages
for manufactures than Massachusetts. She had a more fertile soil, thus furnishing cheaper food
to the working classes, a larger and more accessible coast, and nearly eight times the length
of navigable rivers, greater hydraulic power, vast superiority in mines of coal and iron, a
far more salubrious climate, cotton, the great staple of modern industry, much nearer to Maryland,
her location far more central for trade with the whole Union, and Baltimore, her chief city,
nearer than Boston to the great West, viz.: to the Ohio at Pittsburg and Cincinnati, the Mississippi
at St. Louis, and the lakes at Cleveland, Toledo, and Chicago, by several hundred miles. Indeed,
but for slavery, Maryland must have been a far greater manufacturing as well as commercial
State than Massachusetts--and as to agriculture; there could be no comparison.

But Massachusetts did not become a manufacturing State until after the tariff of 1824. That
measure, as well as the whole protective policy, Massachusetts earnestly opposed in 1820 and
1824, and Daniel Webster, as her representative, denounced it as unconstitutional. From 1790
to 1820, Massachusetts was commercial, not manufacturing, and yet, from 1790 to 1820, Massachusetts
increased in numbers 144,442, and Maryland in the same time only 87,622. Yet, from 1790 to
1820, Massachusetts, the most commercial State, was far more injured by the embargo and the
late war with England than any other State.

It is clear, then, that the accusation of the secession leaders that the North was built up
at the expense of the South, by the tariff, can have no application to the progress of Massachusetts
and Maryland, because the advance of the former over the latter preceded by more than thirty
years the adoption of the protective policy, and a comparison of the relative advance of the
Free and Slave States, during the same period, exhibits the same results.

There is one invariable law, whether we compare all the Slave States with all the Free States,
small States with small, large with large, old with old, new with new, retarding the progress
of the slaveholding States, ever operating, and differing in degree only.

The area of the nine Free States enumerated in 1790, is 169,668 square miles, and of the eight
slaveholding States, 300,580 square miles, while the population of the former in 1790 was 1,968,455,
and of the latter, 1,961,372; but, in 1860, these nine Free States had a population of 10,594,168,
and those eight Slave States only 7,414,684, making the difference in favor of these Free States
in 1860 over those Slave States, 3,179,844, instead of 7,083 in 1790, or a positive gain to
those Free States over those Slave States of 3,172,761. These Free States enumerated in 1790
and 1860, were the six New England States, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and the
Slave States were Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee,
and Kentucky: yet we have seen that the area of those Slave States was nearly double that of
those Free States, the soil much more fertile, the climate more salubrious, as shown by the
Census, that the shore line, including main shore, bays and sounds, islands and rivers, to
head of tide water, was, for those Free States, 4,480 miles, and for those Slave States, 6,560
miles. Thus it is clear that the increase of population of these Slave States should have far
exceeded that of those Free States. The population of these Slave States per square mile in
1790 was 6 (6.52), and in 1860, 24 (24.66), and of those Free States in 1790, was 11 per square
mile (11.60), and in 1860, 62 per square mile (62.44). Thus, while the increase of those Slave
States from 1790 to 1860 was only 18 per square mile, that of those Free States was nearly
51 per square mile (50.84), or in very nearly a triple ratio, while in wealth and education
the proportionate progress was much greater.

No cause except slavery can be assigned to this wonderful difference, for the colonists of
Maryland were distinguished for education, intelligence, and gentle culture. Lord Baltimore
was a statesman and philanthropist, and his colony was a free representative government, which
was the first to repudiate the doctrine of taxation without representation, and the first to
introduce religious toleration. While Maryland has produced many of the most eminent soldiers,
statesmen, and jurists, her relative decline in power, wealth, and population has been deplorable,
and is attributable exclusively to the paralyzing effect of slavery.

While the advance of Massachusetts, with her limited area and sterile soil, especially in view
of the thousands of her native sons who have emigrated to other States, is one of the wonders
of the world, yet the relative increase of the population of New Jersey from 1790 to 1860,
compared with that of Maryland, is still greater than that of Massachusetts. The law is inflexible
wherever slavery disappears. Population of New Jersey in 1790, 184,139, in 1860, 672,035, being
an increase of 264 per cent. (264.96) for New Jersey, of 225 per cent. (225.06) for Massachusetts,
and for Maryland 114 percent. (114.88). The ratio of increase per square mile from 1790 to
1860 was: Massachusetts, 48.55 in 1790, and 157.82 in 1860; Maryland, 28.74 in 1790, and 61.76
in 1860; and New Jersey, 22.01 in 1790, and 80.70 in 1860. Thus, while Maryland from 1790 to
1860, little more than doubled her ratio of increase per square mile (28.74 to 61.76), and
Massachusetts little more than tripled her ratio (48.55 to 157.82), New Jersey very nearly
quadrupled hers (22.01 to 80.70). It must be conceded, however, that the natural advantages
of New Jersey are far greater than those of Massachusetts, whose material and intellectual
progress, in defiance of such serious obstacles, now is, and most probably forever will be,
without a parallel. Now the area of New Jersey is but 8,320 square miles; the soil of Maryland
is far more fertile, the hydraulic power much greater, the shoreline much more than double,
viz.: 531 for New Jersey, to 1,336 for Maryland; while New Jersey, with rich iron mines, has
no coal, and one third of her area is south of the celebrated Mason and Dixon's line, the northern
boundary of Maryland. While the Free States have accomplished these miracles of progress, they
have peopled eleven vast Territories (soon by subdivision to become many more States), immigration
to which has been almost exclusively from the North as compared with the South.

The Slave State which has increased most rapidly to the square mile of all of them from 1790
to 1860, has had a smaller augmentation per square mile than that Free State which has increased
most slowly per square mile during the same time of all the Free States, and the result is
the same as to wealth and education also. Under the best circumstances for the Slave States,
and the worst for the Free States, this result proves the uniformity of the rule (like the
great law of gravitation), knowing no exception to the effect of slavery in depressing the
progress of States in population, wealth, and education.

The isothermals of the great Humboldt (differing so widely from parallels), which trace the
lines of temperature on the earth's surface, prove, as to heat, the climate of the South (running
a line from Charleston to Vicksburg) to be substantially the same as that of Greece and Italy-each,
in its turn, the mistress of the world.

The Census of 1860 exhibits our increase of population from 1790 to 1860 at 35.59 per cent.,
and of our wealth 126.45. Now, if we would increase the wealth of the country only one tenth
in the next ten years, by the gradual disappearance of slavery (far below the results of the
Census), then our wealth being now $16,159,616,068, the effect of such increase would be to
make our wealth in 1870, instead of $36,593,450,585, more than sixteen hundred millions greater,
and in 1880, instead of $82,865,868,849, over three billions six hundred millions, or more
than three times our present debt.

Before the close of this letter, it will be shown that the difference, per capita, of the annual
products of Massachusetts and Maryland exceeds $150. As to the other Southern States, the excess
is much greater. Now, if the annual products of the South were increased $150 each per capita
(still far below Massachusetts) by the exclusion of slavery, then multiplying the total population
of the South, 12,229,727, by 150, the result would be an addition to the annual value of the
products of the South of $1,834,456,050, and in the decade, $18,344,580,500. This change would
not be immediate, but there can be no doubt that with the vastly greater natural advantages
of the South, the superiority of free to slave labor, the immense immigration, especially from
Europe to the South, aided by the Homestead Bill, and the conversion of large plantations into
small farms, an addition of at least one billion of dollars would be made in a decade, by the
exclusion of slavery, to the value of the products of the South.

Having considered the relative progress in population of Massachusetts and Maryland, I will
now examine their advance in wealth.

By Tables 33 and 36, Census of 1860, the value of the products of Massachusetts that year was
$287,000,000; and of Maryland, $66,000,000. Table 33 included domestic manufactories, mines,
and fisheries (p. 59); and Table 36, agricultural products. Dividing these several aggregates
by the total population of each State, the value of that year's product of Massachusetts was
$235 per capita, and of Maryland, $96, making the average annual value of the labor of each
person in the former greatly more than double that of the latter, and the gross product more
than quadruple. This is an amazing result, but it is far below the reality. The earnings of
commerce and navigation are omitted in the Census, which includes only the products of agriculture,
manufactures, the mines, and fisheries. This was a most unfortunate omission, attributable
to the secession leaders, who wished to confine the Census to a mere enumeration of population,
and thus obliterate all the other great decennial monuments which mark the nation's progress
in the pathway of empire.

Some of these tables are given as follows:

First, as to Railroads.--The number of miles in Massachusetts in 1860 (including city roads)
was 1,340, and the cost of construction $61,857,203. (Table 38, pp. 230, 231.) The value of
the freight of these roads in 1860 was $500,524,201. (P. 105.) The number of miles of railroad
in Maryland at the same time was 380, the cost of construction $21,387,157, and the value of
the freight (at the same average rate) $141,111,348, and the difference in favor of Massachusetts
$359,412,883. The difference must have been much greater, because a much larger portion of
the freight in Massachusetts consisted of domestic manufactures, worth $250 per ton, which
is $100 a ton above the average value.

The passengers' account, not given, would vastly swell the difference in favor of Massachusetts.

The tonnage of vessels built in Massachusetts in 1860 was 34,460 tons, and in Maryland, 7,798
tons. (P. 107).

The number of banks in Massachusetts in 1860 was 174; capital, $64,619,200; loans, $107,417,323.
In Maryland the number was 31; capital, $12,568,962; loans, $20,898,762. (Table 34, p. 193.)

The number of insurance companies in Massachusetts, 117; risks, $450,886,263. No statement
given for Maryland, but comparatively very small, as the risks in Massachusetts were nearly
one sixth of all in the Union.

Our exports abroad, from Massachusetts, for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1860, were of
the value of $17,003,277, and the foreign imports $41,187,539; total of imports and exports,
$58,190,816; the clearances, 746,909 tons, the entries, 849,449; total entered and cleared,
1,596,458 tons. In Maryland, exports, $9,001,600, foreign imports, $9,784,773; total imports
and exports, $18,786,323; clearances, 174,000 tons; entries, 186,417; total of entries and
clearances, 360,417. (Table 14, Register of Treasury.) Thus, the foreign imports and exports
abroad, of Massachusetts, were much more than triple those of Maryland, and the entries and
clearances very largely more than quadruple. The coastwise and internal trade are not given,
as recommended by me when Secretary of the Treasury, but the tables of the railroad traffic
indicate in part the immense superiority of Massachusetts.

These statistics, however, prove that, if the earnings of commerce and navigation were added,
the annual value of the products of Massachusetts per capita would be at least $300, and three
times that of Maryland. In estimating values per capita, we must find the earnings of commerce
very large, as a single merchant, in his counting house, engaged in an immense trade, and employing
only a few clerks, may earn as much as a great manufacturing corporation, employing hundreds
of hands. Including commerce, the value, per capita, of the products and earnings of Massachusetts
exceeds not only those of any State in our Union, BUT OF THE WORLD; and would, at the same
rate, make the value of its annual products three hundred billions of dollars; and of our own
country, upward of nine billions of dollars per annum. Such, under great natural disadvantages,
is the grand result achieved in Massachusetts, by education, science, industry, free schools,
free soil, free speech, free labor, free press, and free government. The facts prove that freedom
is progress, that 'knowledge is power,' and that the best way to appreciate the value of property
and augment wealth most rapidly, is to invest a large portion of it in schools, high schools,
academies, colleges, universities, books, libraries, and the press, so as to make labor more
productive, because more skilled, educated, and better directed. Massachusetts has achieved
much in this respect; but when she shall have made high schools as free and universal as common
schools, and the attendance on both compulsory, so as to qualify every voter for governing
a State or nation, she will have made a still grander step in material and intellectual progress,
and the results would be still more astounding.

By Table 35 of the Census, p. 195, the whole value of all the property, real and personal,
of Massachusetts, in 1860, was $815,237,433, and that of Maryland, $376,919,944. We have seen
that the value of the products that year in Massachusetts was $287,000,000 (exclusive of commerce),
and of Maryland, $66,000,000. As a question, then, of profit on capital, that of Massachusetts
was 35 per cent., and of Maryland 17 per cent. Such is the progressive advance (more than two
to one) of free as compared with slave labor. The same law obtains in comparing all the Free
with all the Slave States. But the proof is still more complete. Thus, Delaware and Missouri
(alone of all the Slave States) were ahead of Maryland in this rate of profit, because both
had comparatively fewer slaves; and all the other Slave States, whose servile population was
relatively larger than that of Maryland, were below her in the rate of profit. The law extends
to counties, those having comparatively fewest slaves increasing far more rapidly in wealth
and population. This, then, is the formula as to the rate of profit on capital. First, the
Free States; next, the States and counties of the same State having the fewest relative number
of slaves. The Census, then, is an evangel against slavery, and its tables are revelations
proclaiming laws as divine as those written by the finger of God at Mount Sinai on the tables
of stone.

For seventy years we have had these Census Tables, announcing these great truths more and more
clearly at each decade. They are the records of the nation's movement and condition, the decennial
monuments marking her steps in the path of empire, the oracles of her destiny. They are prophecies,
for each decade fulfils the predictions of its predecessor. They announce laws, not made by
man, but the irrevocable ordinances of the Almighty. We cannot, with impunity, refuse to obey
these laws. For every violation, they enforce their own penalties. From these there is no escape
in the present or the past, nor for the future, except in conformity to their demands. These
laws condemn slavery; and the punishment for disobedience is recorded in the result of every
Census, and finally culminated in the rebellion. Slavery and freedom are antagonistic and discordant
elements: the conflict between them is upon us; it admits of no neutrality or compromise, and
one or the other system must perish.

We have seen that slavery is hostile to the progress of wealth and population: let us now ascertain
its influence on moral and intellectual development.

By Table 15 of the Census of 1860, the result for that year was as follows: In Massachusetts,
value of books printed, $397,500; jobs, $529,347; newspapers, $1,979,069; total, $2,905,916.
Same year in Maryland, books printed, $58,000; jobs, $122,000; newspapers, $169,000; total,
$350,155. By Table 37, Census of 1860, Massachusetts had 222 newspapers and periodicals, of
which 112 were political, 31 religious, 51 literary, miscellaneous 28. Maryland had only 57,
all political. The whole number of copies issued in Massachusetts in 1860 was 102,000,760,
and in Maryland, 20,721,472. Of periodicals, Massachusetts has monthly, 1 political, 10 religious,
18 literary, 7 miscellaneous; quarterly, religious 3, literary 2, miscellaneous 1, and 1 annual.
Maryland had none. Not a religious, literary, scientific, or miscellaneous periodical or journal
in the State! What terrible truths are unfolded in these statistics! None but a political party
press in Maryland, all devoted, in 1860, to the maintenance, extension, and perpetuity of slavery,
which had 57 advocates, and not one for science, religion, or literature.

We have seen that the circulation in 1860 of the press in Massachusetts exceeded that of Maryland
by more than eighty-one millions of copies. These facts all prove that slavery is hostile to
knowledge and its diffusion, to science, literature, and religion, to the press, and to free
government.

For schools, colleges, libraries, and churches, I must take the Tables of the Census of 1850,
those of 1860 not being yet published. There were in 1850 in Massachusetts, 3,679 public schools,
4,443 teachers, 176,475 pupils; native adults who cannot read or write, 1,861. In Maryland,
907 public schools, 1,005 teachers, 33,254 pupils; native adults who cannot read or write,
38,426, excluding slaves, to teach whom is criminal.

Thus, then, slavery is hostile to schools, withholding instruction from the children of the poor.

The number of public libraries in Massachusetts was 1,462, volumes 684,015. In Maryland, 124,
and 125,042 volumes. Value of churches in Massachusetts, $10,206,000. In Maryland, $3,947,884,
of which $2,541,240 is in Baltimore (which has very few slaves), and the remainder is mainly
in the seven counties (from which slavery has nearly disappeared) adjoining Pennsylvania.

As to schools, colleges, books, libraries, churches, newspapers, and periodicals, it thus appears
that Massachusetts is greatly in advance of Maryland.

Now, then, let us contrast loyal Maryland with rebel South Carolina, the author of secession,
and assuming for many years to instruct the nation. By the Census of 1860, she had a population
of 703,708, of whom 402,406 were slaves; and Maryland, numbering 687,049, had 87,189 slaves.
Now, by the Census of 1860, South Carolina had 45 journals and periodicals, and her annual
circulation was 3,654,840 copies. The circulation therefore of Massachusetts exceeded that
of South Carolina more than ninety-eight millions of copies, while Maryland exceeded South
Carolina more than seventeen millions of copies. So much for South Carolina as a great political
teacher. As to schools in 1850: South Carolina had 724 public schools, 739 teachers, 17,838
pupils. Massachusetts, then, had 158,637 more pupils at public schools than South Carolina,
and Maryland 15,416 more pupils at public schools than South Carolina.

The press of Massachusetts, we have seen, circulated in 1860 upward of one hundred and two
millions of copies, equal to 279,454 per day, including journals and periodicals, each read,
on an average, by at least two persons. This is independent of books and pamphlets, and of
the very large circulation of papers from other States and from Europe. What a flood of light
is thus shed daily and hourly upon the people of Massachusetts! This intellectual effulgence
radiates by day and night. It is the sun in its meridian splendor, and the stars in an ever-unclouded
firmament. It has a centre and a circumference, but no darkness. Ignorance vanishes before
it; wealth follows in its train; labor rejoices in its association, and finds its products
more than doubled; freedom hails its presence, and religion gives it a cordial welcome; churches,
schools, academies, colleges, and universities acknowledge its mighty influence. Science penetrates
the secrets of nature, and unfolds each new discovery for the benefit of man. Coal, the offspring
of the sun, develops its latent energy, and water contributes its untiring hydraulic power.
Machinery takes more and more the place of nerves and muscles, cheapens clothing and subsistence
and all the necessaries of life, and opens new fields of industry, and more profitable employment
for labor. Steam and lightning become the slaves of man. He performs the journey of a day in
an hour, and converses in minutes around the globe. The strength of man may not have been much
increased, but his power is augmented a thousand fold.

His life may not have been materially lengthened, but, in the march of knowledge, a year now
is as a century, compared with man's progress in the darkness of the middle ages. The eternal
advance toward omniscience goes on, but is like that of the infinite approach of the asymptote,
which never reaches the hyperbolic curve. The onward of science is in a geometrical ratio,
so that in time, the intellectual progress of a day in the future, must exceed that of a century
in the past. Knowledge is enthroned as king, and grand truths and new ideas are his ministers.
Science takes the diameter of the earth's orbit as a base line and unit of measurement, and
with it spans immensity, and triangulates the nebulous systems amid the shadowy verges of receding
space. Its researches are cosmical upon the earth and the heavens, and all the elements minister
to its progress. Sink to the lowest mine, or fathom the ocean's depth, or climb the loftiest
mountains, or career through the heavens on silken wings, and it is there also. On--on--on;
nearer--nearer--still nearer it moves forever and forever, with accelerated speed, toward the
infinite eternal. Such are the triumphs of knowledge; and he who diffuses it among our race,
or discovers and disseminates new truths, advances man nearer to his Creator; he exalts the
whole race; he elevates it in the scale of being, and raises it into higher and still higher
spheres.

It is science that marks the speed of sound and light and lightning, calculates the eclipses,
catalogues the stars, maps the heavens, and follows, for centuries of the past and the future,
the comet's course. It explores the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. With geology,
it notes the earthquake upheaval of mountains, and, with mineralogy, the laws of crystallization.
With chemistry, it analyzes, decomposes, and compounds the elements. If, like Canute, it cannot
arrest the tidal wave, it is subjecting it to laws and formulas. Taking the sunbeam for its
pencil, it heliographs man's own image, and the scenery of the earth and the heavens. Has science
any limits or horizon? Can it ever penetrate the soul of man, and reveal the mystery of his
existence and destiny? It is certainly exploring the facts of sociology, arranging and generalizing
them, and deducing laws.

Man, elevated by knowledge in the scale of being, controls the forces of nature with greater
power and grander results, and accumulates wealth more rapidly. The educated free labor of
Massachusetts, we have seen, doubles the products of toil, per capita, as compared with Maryland,
and quadruples them (as the Census shows) compared with South Carolina. One day's labor of
a man in Massachusetts is more than equal to two in Maryland, and four in South Carolina. So,
if we take our savage tribes, with their huts and tents, their rude agriculture, their furs,
their few and simple household manufactures, their hunting and fishing, the average product
of their annual labor, at four cents a day each, would be $14.60 a year, or more than a fourth
of that of South Carolina (56.91). So that Massachusetts, in material progress, is farther
in advance of South Carolina than that State is of the savage Indians. Thus we have the successive
steps and gradations of man: Massachusetts, with free labor and free schools, having reached
the highest point of civilization: South Carolina, with slavery and ignorance (except the few),
in a semi-barbarous stage; and the lowest savage condition, called barbarous, but nearer to
South Carolina than that State to Massachusetts.
