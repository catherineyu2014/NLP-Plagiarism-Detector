Behold, Reader, that which I had to say to you, but what defence soever, I have imployed, I
know that it is of works of this nature, as of a place of War, where notwithstanding all the
care the Engineer hath brought to fortifie it, there is alwayes some weak part found, which
he hath not dream'd of, and whereby it is assaulted; but this shall not surprize me; for as
I have not forgot that I am a man, no more have I forgot that I am subject to erre.

  TO THE

  READER.

The Romances in France have for a long Time been the Diversion and Amusement of the whole World;
the People both in the City and at Court have given themselves over to this Vice, and all Sorts
of People have read these Works with a most surprizing Greediness; but that Fury is very much
abated, and they are all fallen off from this Distraction: The Little Histories of this Kind
have taken Place of Romances, whose Prodigious Number of Volumes were sufficient to tire and
satiate such whose Heads were most fill'd with those Notions.

These little Pieces which have banish'd Romances are much more agreeable to the Brisk and Impetuous
Humour of the English, who have naturally no Taste for long-winded Performances, for they have
no sooner begun a Book, but they desire to see the End of it: The Prodigious Length of the
Ancient Romances, the Mixture of so many Extraordinary Adventures, and the great Number of
Actors that appear on the Stage, and the Likeness which is so little managed, all which has
given a Distaste to Persons of good Sense, and has made Romances so much cry'd down, as we
find 'em at present. The Authors of Historical Novels, who have found out this Fault, have
run into the same Error, because they take for the Foundation of their History no more than
one Principal Event, and don't overcharge it with Episodes, which wou'd extend it to an Excessive
Length; but they are run into another Fault, which I cannot Pardon, that is, to please by Variety
the Taste of the Reader, they mix particular Stories with the Principal History, which seems
to me as if they reason'd Ill; in Effect the Curiosity of the Reader is deceiv'd by this Deviation
from the Subject, which retards the Pleasure he wou'd have in seeing the End of an Event; it
relishes of a Secret Displeasure in the Author, which makes him soon lose Sight of those Persons
with whom he began to be in Love; besides the vast Number of Actors who have such different
Interests, embarresses his Memory, and causes some Confusion in his Brain, because 'tis necessary
for the Imagination to labour to recal the several Interests and Characters of the Persons
spoken of, and by which they have interrupted the History.

For the Reader's better Understanding, we ought not to chuse too Ancient Accidents, nor unknown
Heroes, which are fought for in a Barbarous Countrey, and too far distant in Time, for we care
little for what was done a Thousand Years ago among the Tartars or Ayssines.

The Names of Persons ought to have a Sweetness in them, for a Barbarous Name disturbs the Imagination;
as the Historian describes the Heroes to his Fancy, so he ought to give them Qualities which
affect the Reader, and which fixes him to his Fortune; but he ought with great Care to observe
the Probability of Truth, which consists in saying nothing but what may Morally be believed.

For there are Truths that are not always probable; as for Example 'tis an allowed Truth in
the Roman History that Nero put his Mother to Death, but 'tis a Thing against all Reason and
Probability that a Son shou'd embrue his Hand in the Blood of his own Mother; it is also no
less probable that a Single Captain shou'd at the Head of a Bridge stop a whole Army, although
'tis probable that a small Number of Soldiers might stop, in Defiles, Prodigious Armies, because
the Situation of the Place favours the Design, and renders them almost Equal. He that writes
a True History ought to place the Accidents as they Naturally happen, without endeavouring
to sweeten them for to procure a greater Credit, because he is not obliged to answer for their
Probability; but he that composes a History to his Fancy, gives his Heroes what Characters
he pleases; and places the Accidents as he thinks fit, without believing he shall be contradicted
by other Historians, therefore he if obliged to Write nothing that is improbable; 'tis nevertheless
allowable that an Historian shows the Elevation of his Genius, when advancing Improbable Actions,
he gives them Colours and Appearances capable of Perswading.

One of the Things an Author ought first of all to take Care of, is to keep up to the Characters
of the Persons he introduces. The Authors of Romances give Extraordinary Virtues to their Heroins,
exempted from all the Weakness of Humane Nature, and much above the Infirmities of their Sex;
'tis Necessary they shou'd be Virtuous or Vicious to Merit the Esteem or Disesteem of the Reader;
but their Virtue out to be spared, and their Vices exposed to every Trial: It wou'd in no wise
be probable that a Young Woman fondly beloved by a Man of great Merit, and for whom she had
a Reciprocal Tenderness, finding her self at all Times alone with him in Places which favour'd
their Loves, cou'd always resist his Addresses; there are too Nice Occasions; and an Author
wou'd not enough observe good Sense, if he therein exposed his Heroins; 'tis a Fault which
Authors of Romances commit in every Page; they would blind the Reader with this Miracle, but
'tis necessary the Miracle shou'd be feisable, to make an Impression in the Brain of Reasonable
Persons; the Characters are better managed in the Historical Novels, which are writ now-a-days;
they are not fill'd with great Adventures, and extraordinary Accidents, for the most simple
Action may engage the Reader by the Circumstances that attend it; it enters into all the Motions
and Disquiets of the Actor, when they have well express'd to him the Character. If he be Jealous,
the Look of a Person he Loves, a Mouse, a turn of the Head, or the least complaisance to a
Rival, throws him into the greatest Agitations, which the Readers perceive by a Counter-blow;
if he be very Vertuous, and falls into a Mischance by Accident, they Pity him and Commiserate
his Misfortunes; for Fear and Pity in Romance as well as Tragedies are the Two Instruments
which move the Passion; for we in some Manner put our selves in the Room of those we see in
Danger; the Part we take therein, and the fear of falling into the like Misfortunes, causes
us to interest our selves more in their Adventures, because that those sort of Accidents may
happen, to all the World; and it touches so much the more, because they are the common Effect
of Nature.

The Heroes in the Ancient Romances have nothing in them that is Natural; all is unlimited in
their Character; all their Advantages have Something Prodigious, and all their Actions Something
that's Marvellous; in short, they are not Men: A single Prince attact by a great Number of
Enemies, it so far from giving way to the Croud, that he does Incredible Feats of Valour, beats
them, puts them to flight, delivers all the Prisoners, and kills an infinite Number of People,
to deserve the Title of a Hero. A Reader who has any Sense does not take part with these Fabulous
Adventures, or at least is but slightly touch'd with them, because they are not natural, and
therefore cannot be believ'd. The Heroes of the Modern Romances are better Characteriz'd, they
give them Passions, Vertues or Vices, which resemble Humanity; thus all the World will find
themselves represented in these Descriptions, which ought to be exact, and mark'd by Tracts
which express clearly the Character of the Hero, to the end we may not be deceived, and may
presently know our predominant Quality, which ought to give the Spirit all the Motion and Action
of our Lives; 'tis that which inspires the Reader with Curiosity, and a certain impatient Desire
to see the End of the Accidents, the reading of which causes an Exquisite Pleasure when they
are Nicely handled; the Motion of the Heart gives yet more, but the Author ought to have an
Extraordinary Penetration to distinguish them well, and not to lose himself in this Labyrinth.
Most Authors are contented to describe Men in general, they represent them Covetous, Courageous
and Ambitious, without entering into the Particulars, and without specifying the Character
of their Covetousness, Valour or Ambition; they don't perceive Nice Distinctions, which those
who know it Remark in the Passions; in Effect, the Nature, Humour and Juncture, give New Postures
to Vices; the Turn of the Mind, Motion of the Heart, Affection and Interests, alter the very
Nature of the Passions, which are different in All Men; the Genius of the Author marvellously
appears when he Nicely discovers those Differences, and exposes to the Reader's Sight those
almost unperceivable Jealousies which escape the Sight of most Authors, because they have not
an exact Notion of the Turnings and Motions of Humane Understanding; and they know nothing
but the gross Passions, from whence they make but general Descriptions.
