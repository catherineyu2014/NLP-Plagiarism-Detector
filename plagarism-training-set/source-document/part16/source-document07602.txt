Instigated, doubtless, by the pristine reminiscences of former times, no sooner had that most
prudent and considerate dame found herself in the vicinity of the scenes of her earlier days,
than she bethought herself of a visit to the ancient house-keeper of Martindale Castle, Dame
Ellesmere by name, who, long retired from active service, resided at the keeper's lodge, in
the west thicket, with her nephew, Lance Outram, subsisting upon the savings of her better
days, and on a small pension allowed by Sir Geoffrey to her age and faithful services.

Now Dame Ellesmere and Mistress Deborah had not by any means been formerly on so friendly a
footing, as this haste to visit her might be supposed to intimate. But years had taught Deborah
to forget and forgive; or perhaps she had no special objection, under cover of a visit to Dame
Ellesmere, to take the chance of seeing what changes time had made on her old admirer the keeper.
Both inhabitants were in the cottage when, after having seen her master set forth on his expedition
to the Castle, Mistress Debbitch, dressed in her very best gown, footed it through gutter,
and over stile, and by pathway green, to knock at their door, and to lift the hatch at the
hospitable invitation which bade her come in.

Dame Ellesmere's eyes were so often dim, that, even with the aid of spectacles, she failed
to recognise, in the portly and mature personage who entered their cottage, the tight well-made
lass, who, presuming on her good looks and flippant tongue, had so often provoked her by insubordination;
and her former lover, the redoubted Lance, not being conscious that ale had given rotundity
to his own figure, which was formerly so slight and active, and that brandy had transferred
to his nose the colour which had once occupied his cheeks, was unable to discover that Deborah's
French cap, composed of sarsenet and Brussels lace, shaded the features which had so often
procured him a rebuke from Dr. Dummerar, for suffering his eyes, during the time of prayers,
to wander to the maid-servants' bench.

In brief, the blushing visitor was compelled to make herself known; and when known, was received
by aunt and nephew with the most sincere cordiality.

The home-brewed was produced; and, in lieu of more vulgar food, a few slices of venison presently
hissed in the frying pan, giving strong room for inference that Lance Outram, in his capacity
of keeper, neglected not his own cottage when he supplied the larder at the Castle. A modest
sip of the excellent Derbyshire ale, and a taste of the highly-seasoned hash, soon placed Deborah
entirely at home with her old acquaintance.
