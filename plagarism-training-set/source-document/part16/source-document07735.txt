Sid paused a moment for second wind. "When we look about we're bound to own this is a mighty
changing world. Time was when the mountain people rode to the gatherings in Brushy Hollow in
jolt wagons. They kept it up a while, loading the whole family in the jolt wagon. But times
have changed.... A body has to sort o' keep up with the times, like Prof. Koch. Bless you,
he loads his whole pack and passel of boys and girls in a bus and packs them hither and yon
'crost the country to show out with their play-making. The Carolina Playmakers just naturally
fetch the mountain to Mohammed." Sid flung wide his hands, brought them slowly together. "To
get all such folks to work together that's why we formed the American Folkways Association.
What's more we've got us a magazine to tell about what we've done and aim to do--the Arcadian
Life magazine, with our good friend Otto Ernest Rayburn as editor, 'way down in the Ozarks."
Sid Hatfield smiled pleasantly. "There's no excuse for folks not being neighborly nowadays.
No matter where they live, what with good roads and the automobile--we've just got a-bound
to be neighborly. To sing together, to make music together, to show out our crops and our posies
and our handiwork together. Here in Snead's Grove today is the third time we've bore witness
that our Association is not just a theory. We made our first bow in the Kentucky foothills
in June, the second in Maryland in August, and now in Tennessee. In October we aim to join
hands and hearts and our music in Arcadia under the Autumn moon."

That day in Snead's Grove in Tennessee they wanted Sid Hatfield to keep right on but taking
a squint at the sun sinking in the west, he said in conclusion, "I've got a long ways to travel
back to the West Virginia mountains but I hope we'll all be together again here in the Grove
next summer, this day a year, the Lord being willing."

                            VANISHING TRAIL

Perhaps it is merely the result of evolutionary process, economic rather than intentional,
that man has wiped out many reminders of the past; that the forest primeval has passed to make
room for blue grass, tasseled corn, and tobacco; that forts and blockhouses gave way to the
settler's log house encircled by a garden patch; that the windowless cabin has gone to make
room for the weather-boarded frame of many rooms and glass windows; that the village has vanished
for the town--the industrial center.

The Wilderness Trail broken first by mastodon, then panther and bear and frightened deer, has
been transformed into a modern highway. The Shawnee Trail along which Indians lurked and tomahawked
white men has become Mayo Trail, taking its name from a country schoolteacher. He was a far-seeing
man, who stumbled sometimes hopelessly along the lonely way, when he needed help to bring out
of the bowels of the earth the treasure in coal he knew to be hidden there. Mayo Trail is an
amazing engineering feat that connects mountains with level land. Limestone Trail in Mason
County has left along its course only a vestige of vegetation to remind us it was once the
path of buffalo and Indian. To motorists hurrying onward it is merely U. S. 60 that leads to
another city.

The rugged, unbroken path once pursued by the lad Gabriel Arthur, a Cherokee captive, called
on Hutchins Map in 1778 the "War Path to the Cuttawa Country," uniting today with the Wilderness
Trails, has become the open gateway to the West. Boone's Trace, or Boone's Path, leading from
Virginia through Cumberland Gap, to the Ohio River, still is called Boone's Path. Since 1909
it has been a national motorway, being a part of the Dixie Highway which runs from Michigan
to Florida. It was over this same path that Governor Duncannon of Virginia built the first
wagon road in 1790. During the Civil War the region of the Gap was fortified and occupied by
Confederate and Union soldiers in turn. Later, in 1889, the first railroad entered the Gap.
Today Skyline Highway--U. S. 25 and 58--leads from the saddle of the historic Gap to the top
of Pinnacle Mountain, commanding a view of six states, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, North
Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.

And the scene has changed.

Spring has come to the Blue Ridge. The hum of industry echoes along once lonely creeks, through
quiet hollows. We see no more the oxcart lumbering, creaking laboriously along, higher and
higher up the rugged mountain side. The latest model motor glides swiftly over the smooth surface,
winding its way upward and upward. Off yonder the TVA has harnessed the waterpower of the Holston
and Tennessee, made a great valley to burst into a miracle of man's genius. Modern industrial
plants steam along the banks.

Good roads, the automobile, schoolhouses, the airplane have wiped out all barriers between
mountain and plain. The Blue Ridge casts a long, long shadow across blossoming valleys. The
mountaineer of yesterday with his Anglo-Saxon speech of Elizabeth's time, his primitive plow
and loom, has vanished before the juggernaut of progress. But the children of the hills are
blessed with a rich, a priceless heritage in tradition, song, and love of independence that
will not die as long as mountains stand and men of the mountains survive to defend and preserve it.
