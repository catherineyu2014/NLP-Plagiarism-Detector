PUNCH,

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

VOL. 101.

July 18, 1891.

MR. PUNCH'S JUBILEE NUMBER.

"My Reminiscences!" said Mr. Punch, replying to a question put by his Interviewer, ANNO DOMINI
EIGHTEEN-NINETY-ONE; "They are already before the World, in exactly One Hundred Volumes! My
first 'Number' bore date 'for the week ending July 17th, 1841.

  Evenings we knew
  Happy as this;
  Faces we miss
  Pleasant to see.
  Kind hearts and true,
  Gentle and just,
  Peace to their dust!
  We sing round the tree.'

It is one of my proudest memories to recollect that THACKERAY's 'Mahogany Tree,' was my Table."

"To have been Amphitryon to such guests must have been the most pleasant privilege of hospitality,"
said ANNO DOMINI.

"Very true," responded Mr. Punch, "And of all my Deputy-Amphitryons--if I may use the term--who
more fully, fitly, justly, and genially filled the post than the earliest of them all, the
kindly and judicious MARK LEMON? Had not he and clever HENRY MAYHEW, and Mr. Printer LAST,
and EBENEZER LANDELLS, my earliest engraver, foregathered first with me in furtherance of the
'new work of wit and whim,' embellished with cuts and caricatures, to be called:--

PUNCH; OR, THE LONDON CHARIVARI?

"LEMON, and LAST, and MAYHEW, were they here to-day, would probably agree to divide between
them the early honours, as they shared the early responsibility. But doubtless MARK LEMON was
the literary shaper of the 'Guffawgraph,' as he jocularly called it in his 'Prospectus,' and,
from the first, its guiding spirit. Happily so, for his was a spirit fitted to rule, both by
power, and tact, and taste. With 'Uncle MARK' in the chair, I knew there would be neither austere
autocracy, nor fainéant laxity, neither weakness of stroke nor foulness of blow, neither Rosa-Matilda-ish,
mawkishness, nor Rabelaisian coarseness.

"How well I remember my first group of 'Young Men,'" pursued Mr. Punch, musingly. "There was
swift and scathing DOUGLAS JERROLD, with his tossed and tangled mane of grey hair. GILBERT
ABBOTT À BECKETT, too, the whimsically witty, the drolly satirical, the comically caustic.
HENRY MAYHEW, of course, and, a little later, his brother HORACE, the simple, lovable 'PONNY.'
HENNING, NEWMAN and BRINE, were my earliest Artists. HENNING drew the first Cartoon, whilst
NEWMAN and BRINE, and, later, HINE, between them, were responsible for most of the smaller
cuts, head-and-tail-pieces, pictorial puns, and sketchy silhouettes, wherewith Punch's early
pages abounded.

"In the fourth Number of Punch, published on August 7th, 1841, first appeared the soon-to-be-famous
signature of 'JOHN LEECH.'"

"Ah! JOHN LEECH," cried the attentive ANNO DOMINI. "A name to conjure with! How did that 'Star
swim into your ken'?"

"There was a certain clever, scholarly, and genial gentleman," responded Mr. Punch, "who had
lately published, under the pseudonym of 'PAUL PRENDERGAST,' an extremely funny Comic Latin
Grammar. 'PAUL PRENDERGAST' was, in reality, Mr. PERCIVAL LEIGH, originally a medical gentleman,
the well-beloved 'Professor' of later Punch days. The Comic Latin Grammar had been admirably
illustrated by a personal friend, and fellow-student, of LEIGH's named LEECH. The services
of both of the contributors to the Comic Latin Grammar were soon enlisted in my interests.

"Another of LEECH's medical student friends was ALBERT SMITH, and he before long was penning
his 'Physiology of London Evening Parties' (illustrated by PHIZ--HALBOT KNIGHT BROWNE--NEWMAN,
and others) for my pages. KENNY MEADOWS, WATTS PHILLIPS, ALFRED 'CROW-QUILL' (FORRESTER), JOHN
GILBERT, and others, drew also for the young Journal, the printing of which had been taken
over by the Whitefriars firm of BRADBURY AND EVANS, with whom as proprietors and fast friends,
Punch has ever since been happily associated.

"As early as my Fourth Volume," pursued Mr. Punch, "it became obvious that, in the person of
'Our Fat Contributor,' a certain 'MICHAEL ANGELO TITMARSH' was writing and drawing for Punch.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Yours, truly, MELBOURNE.

       *       *       *       *       *

Yes, the lion THACKERAY had joined the Table, and thenceforth for many years he illumined my
pages with his keen wit and ripe wisdom, his graceful prose, his polished verse, and his characteristic
pictures.

"The frontispiece to Volume V. (1843) was by RICHARD DOYLE, a plain foreshadowing of the celebrated
design which was ever after to form the familiar Cover of the Punch Number. DOYLE had now joined
the Staff, and for many years his fine fancy was allowed full play in my pages.

"At the end of the same Volume, upon page 260 of a supplement, entitled, 'Punch's Triumphal
Procession,' appeared TOM HOOD's never-to-be-forgotten 'Song of the Shirt.' It is one of Mr.
Punch's pleasantest Reminiscences that this gentle genius, this true poet, contributed this
famous masterpiece to his pages.

"The scholarly, accomplished, and warm-hearted TOM TAYLOR was the next to join the Table, and
his 'Spanish Ballads' (in 1846), admirably illustrated by DOYLE, made their mark, as did later
his 'Unprotected Female.' In Volume XVI. PERCIVAL LEIGH commenced his 'Mr. PIPS, his Diary,
or, Manners and Customs of ye Englyshe in 1849,' characteristically illustrated by RICHARD
DOYLE at his graphic best. The same year was remarkable for the appearance of LEECH's most
delightful character, the simple-minded, sport-loving, philistine paterfamilias, Mr. BRIGGS,
first met with in connection with 'The Pleasures of Housekeeping,' though subsequently associated
especially with humorous sporting scenes.

"The frontispiece to Volume XIX., for the second half of the year 1850, was by a 'new hand,'
none other than JOHN TENNIEL the 'Cartoonist' par excellence, whose work henceforth was to
be--as happily it still is--the pride of Mr. Punch and the delight of the British Public. TENNIEL's
first Cartoon, 'Lord JACK the Giant-Killer,' graced Mr. Punch's 499th Number, he having taken,
at short notice, the place of RICHARD DOYLE, who after many years of excellent work had voluntarily
withdrawn from the Table, owing to certain religious scruples, not wholly unconnected with
the subject of his successor's first 'Big Cut.'

"Another member of my little army about this time was GEORGE SILVER, and my next recruits were
the polished and witty SHIRLEY BROOKS, and, one who was to develop into the greatest master
of Black-and-White Art this country has produced, CHARLES KEENE to wit, our dear, picturesque,
unsophisticated 'CARLO,' lost to the Table--an irreparable loss!--but a few months ago.

"At the opening of Volume XXVII. for the second half of the year 1854, you will observe, Mr.
ANNO DOMINI, a Picture by JOHN TENNIEL (reproduced above), in which the then existing Staff
of Punch are humorously sketched. They are engaged in somewhat varied sports and pastimes.
Mr. Punch is keeping wicket in a game in which THACKERAY wields the bat, and PERCIVAL LEIGH
is bowling; MARK LEMON, and GILBERT À BECKETT are playing at battledore and shuttlecock, and
DOUGLAS JERROLD is having a solitary game of skittles, the 'pins' being the CZAR of RUSSIA,
&c. SHIRLEY BROOKS, MAYHEW, and TOM TAYLOR are playing at Leapfrog, TOM TAYLOR 'overing' MAYHEW,
whilst SHIRLEY BROOKS is following up. In the background JOHN TENNIEL is sketching the Good
Knight Punchius upon a wall, whilst in the immediate foreground JOHN LEECH, upon a hobby-horse,
is leaping over an easel. These were the chief of my 'Young Men' at this time. In front of
the tent are two gentlemen, one in a black, the other in a white, hat. The first is WILLIAM
BRADBURY, the second is 'Pater' EVANS, our 'proprietors and friends' of that day.

"In 1856 an obituary notice showed that the Table had experienced one of its earliest losses,
that of GILBERT ABBOTT À BECKETT. And on June 8th, in the following year, the boding black
border appeared 'In Memoriam' of DOUGLAS JERROLD. Ah, me, Mr. ANNO DOMINI, the jingling of
the cap-and-bells, howsoever merrily it may sound, is perforce interrupted now and again by
the chiming of a bell of deeper note and sadder tone.

"Volume XXXIX. for 1860 saw the artistic advent of the Society Satirist of the Victorian Era,
GEORGE DU MAURIER; and in Volume XLIV. for the year 1863, the presence of another 'New Boy'
at my Table, was evidenced by the appearance of the burlesque London-Journalish Novel, 'Mokeanna,'
in which FRANCIS COWLEY BURNAND parodied the 'Penny Dreadful.'

"The very first page of my Volume for 1864, Mr. ANNO DOMINI, recorded a great, a grievous,
an irreparable loss to me and to the world. WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY, the greatest of my
contributors, had gone for ever from my Table. And a little later--only a little later--in
my Number for November 12th, 1864, appeared an obituary notice--alas the day!--of the great,
the genial, the loved, the lamented JOHN LEECH.

"In the Volumes for this year, 1865, appear for the first time the fanciful, ingenious, elaborately
symbolical designs of CHARLES H. BENNETT, who unhappily did not long enrich my pages with his
facile execution and singular subtlety of fancy. He died on the 2nd April. His place at my
Table was soon after taken by LINLEY SAMBOURNE.

"On the 23rd May, 1870, he who had sat at the head of my Table ever since its first establishment,
'who wrote the first article in this Journal, who from its establishment had been its conductor,'
left empty the chief seat at my board.

"SHIRLEY BROOKS succeeded him in the editorial chair, which he filled fittingly and faithfully
for--alas!--only four years. In 1874 I lost my second Editor. TOM TAYLOR was his successor,
taking up with the Editorship, the extraction of that weekly 'Essence of Parliament,' so long
and so delightfully distilled by the deceased Chief.

"Meanwhile, on April 30th, 1872, HORACE MAYHEW, had departed from our midst. A little later
the Table received a further accession in the person of ARTHUR WILLIAM À BECKETT, ('Mr. BRIEFLESS
Junior,') son of that GILBERT ABBOTT À BECKETT who was one of my earliest 'Stars.' His brother,
a second GILBERT À BECKETT, took his seat at the Table a few years later. In Volume LXVIII.
for 1875, E.J. MILLIKEN made his first appearance as a Punch Writer. The Author of the 'ARRY
papers, 'CHILDE CHAPPIE's Pilgrimage,' &c., joined my Table two years later.

"On the 12th July, 1880, another great loss befel me. TOM TAYLOR, my third Editor, left that
honourable post vacant, after occupying it with credit and distinction for six years. Mr. F.C.
BURNAND, author of 'Happy Thoughts,' &c., reigns in his stead. R.F. SKETCHLEY, who had a seat
at my Board for several years, resigned it a little later.

"The same year, 1880, saw the introduction of a new Artist, in the person of HARRY FURNISS;
and the next introduced HENRY W. LUCY, the 'TOBY' of Mr. Punch's remodelled Essence of Parliament.

"In 1887, the appearance of 'Mr. Punch's Manual for Young Reciters,' gave evidence of the fact
that the Author of Vice Versâ, Mr. F. ANSTEY, had joined my Table. He, with R.C. LEHMANN, Author
of 'Modern Types,' &c., and E.G. REED, the Artist, are the very latest additions thereto. That
Table has, within the last two years, sustained yet two other losses: PERCIVAL LEIGH, last
survivor of the 'Old Guard,' dying on 24th October, 1889, whilst, early in the present year,
the inimitable CHARLES KEENE, universally acknowledged to be the greatest master of 'Black-and-White'
technique who ever put pencil to wood-block, was taken away from me.

"Merely to mention all the bright pens and pencils which have occasionally contributed to my
pages, would occupy much space. Amongst Writers may be named MAGUIN HANNAY, STIRLING COYNE,
COVENTRY PATMORE, MORTIMER COLLINS, GEORGE AUGUSTUS SALA, ANDREW LANG, JAMES PAYN, and Lord
TENNYSON; amongst Artists, HOWARD (whose signature, a trident, was at one time familiar to
Punch readers), Miss BOWERS, RALSTON, BRYAN, BARNARD, W.S. GILBERT (who illustrated several
of his own articles), CORBOULD, CALDECOTT, RIVIÈRE, H.S. MARKS, FRED WALKER, SIR JOHN MILLAIS,
and Sir FREDERICK LEIGHTON.

"The present Staff, Mr. ANNO DOMINI, you may see assembled 'round the old Tree' in the accompanying
Cartoon. Around on the walls are the counterfeit presentments of their illustrious and honoured
predecessors. My guests, you perceive, are drinking a toast. That toast is, 'Mr. Punch, his
health and Jubilee!'"

"In which I am delighted to join!" responded ANNO DOMINI. "Mr. Punch, you must be as proud
of your 'Mahogany Tree,' and its many memories, as King ARTHUR of his Table Round."

  "'For dear to ARTHUR was that hall of ours,
  As having there so oft with all his Knights
  Feasted,'"

quoted the Sage, musing deeply of many things. Many of my Knights have 'gone before,' but they
have not

  "'Left me gazing at a barren board.'

"Their monograms are carven on this Table, their memories abide with us as we drink to Punch's
Jubilee, and will abide when, as I hope, yet another fifty years hence, our successors drink
with equal heartiness to Punch's Centenary!"

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

House of Commons, July 14th, 1891.--Things going on here much as usual. Rapidly winding up
Session amid familiar surroundings. OLD MORALITY in seat of Leader of the House; Mr. G. opposite;
SPEAKER in Chair; Sergeant-at-Arms on guard by the door; and WINDBAG SEXTON on his feet.

Brings back to my mind the first time I saw House. Wasn't in the House then; a mere puppy,
which, indeed, some say I remain to this day. The date was August the 19th, 1841, and from
seat where Strangers were admitted in the old House (the temporary building occupied whilst
BARRY was erecting this lofty pile) I looked on at the opening of the first Session of the
Fourteenth Parliament of the then United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, appointed to
meet at Westminster in the fifth year of the Reign of HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA.

Remember it as if it were yesterday. It was MELBOURNE's Ministry; but he of course sat in another
place. On the Treasury Bench, distinctly visible under his hat, was JOHNNY RUSSELL, Colonial
Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons. At a safe distance from him sat PAM, then in
the prime of life, and at the time holding the post of Foreign Minister, in which he was able
to make a remarkably large number of people uncomfortable. There was Sir GEORGE GREY, Chancellor
of the Duchy, whilst a sturdily built gentleman, then known as the Right Hon. THOMAS BABBINGTON
MACAULAY, was Secretary for War; HENRY LABOUCHERE (not the SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE) was President
of the Board of Trade, and Master of the Mint; whilst FRANCIS BARING was Chancellor of the
Exchequer, all untroubled by the necessity of constructing a Budget since he knew he would
never be called on to bring one in.

On the Front Bench opposite was Sir ROBERT PEEL with JAMES GRAHAM at his right elbow. In modest
retirement at the end of the Bench sat a young man, of full height, and good figure, with a
mass of black hair crowning a large, well-shaped head. Remember noticing how carefully the
hair was parted down the middle, in a fashion then unusual with men. His face was pleasant
to look upon, even mild in its expression; but from time to time, more particularly when he
spoke, there flashed from beneath his dark and bushy eyebrows a pair of eyes that shone like
stars. This was the Mr. G. of those days, whose highest Ministerial office, as yet, had been
the Under-Secretaryship for the Colonies, held for a few months six years earlier.

Big House on this first night, as Houses were counted then, when the number of Members was
considerably less. First business was to choose SPEAKER. SHAW-LEFEVRE (not the Member for Bradford,
but a forbear) had been SPEAKER in last Parliament; re-elected now, PEEL, who, by the lifting
of a finger, could have put his own nominee in the Chair, graciously consenting.

Of all who filled the House on that night, only two have seats in the present Parliament--Mr.
G., and the humble person who, by favour of the Electors of Barkshire, is permitted to pen
these lines. (CHRISTOPHER TALBOT, then represented Glamorganshire, but he just failed to live
into this Jubilee time.) Yet, when I look round on the Benches now, I see a score of men who
bear the names, and are, in many cases, descendants, of Members who sat in the Parliament that
will ever have a place in history, if only because it was born in the same year, almost in
the same month, as Mr. Punch. There was a THOMAS DYKE ACLAND, representing Devonshire; there
were two HENEAGES, one representing Devizes, and the other, EDWARD, sitting for Grimsby, as
EDWARD HENEAGE sits to-day for the same borough. There was a BORTHWICK, Member for Evesham.
There was a PHILIP STANHOPE, Member for Hertford. STANSFELD sat for Huddersfield, and MARJORIBANKS
for Hythe, a LAWSON for Knaresborough, a BECKETT for Leeds, a CHILDERS for Malton, a MANNERS
for Newark-upon-Trent, having a certain WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE for colleague. He was the Lord
JOHN, well known to students of poetry, who now wears a Ducal coronet.

Of course there was a SMITH, VERNON by Christian name, Member for Northampton; a HOULDSWOTH
representing Nottinghamshire, a MACLEAN for Oxford, a HARCOURT for Oxfordshire--nay, in this
happy Parliament there were two HARCOURTS, GRANVILLE HARCOURT VERNON sitting for East Retford.
A VIVIAN sat for Penrhyn--HUSSEY VIVIAN's father, JOHN HENEY, sat in the same Parliament for
Swansea. Lord EBRINGTON sat for Plymouth, and CHARLES RUSSELL for Reading. ORMSBY GORE represented
North Shropshire, long a possession of his family. The Markiss o' GRANBY sat for Stamford,
with a CLARK for colleague. FREDERICK VILLIERS (not our present Father) kept the name green
at Sudbury, and there was a WYNDHAM for Sussex. The HENRY LABOUCHERE of those less lively days
sat for Taunton, and Sir ROBERT PEEL, our SPEAKER's father, for Tamworth. There was a HAYTER,
GOOD-ENOUGH: for Wells, one LOWTHER represented Westmoreland, and another York. A WALTER LONG
sat for North Wilts, STUART WORTLEY sat for the West Riding, and JAMES DUFF for Banffshire.
We had a BALFOUR for Haddington, and Lord DALMENY of that day, happier than the present head
of the family, sat in the Commons for Inverkeithing, a place long since swept off the electoral
board. These surnames, with one or two others I can't recall--yes, there was a DALRYMPLE for
Wigtonshire--are familiar on the Roll of Parliament to-day.

Amongst the prominent Members of this Parliament I remember ROEBUCK sitting; for Bath; and
PAKINGTON--then plain JOHN all unconscious of the coming marvel of a Ten Minutes' Reform Bill--for
Droitwich. STRATFORD CANNING had a seat for King's Lynn, and MONCKTON' MILNES was Member for
Pomfret. JOHN BRIGHT was not in the House, but RICHARD COBDEN sat for Stockport, and there
was an acidulous person, then known as RALPH BERNAL, who sat for Wycombe. We knew BERNAL OSBORNE
in many later Parliaments.

Curious to think how Ireland at this epoch belonged to the classes! DANIEL O'CONNELL was just
in his prime, and, in addition to himself returned three of his name. SMITH O'BRIEN was yet
far off the cabbage garden, and HENRY GRATTAN sat for Meath. There is a living image of him
now among the busts in the corridor leading out of the Octagon Hall; a fiery dramatic speaker
in the House, who, as someone said of him at the time, used in his passion to throw up his
arms, bend over till he touched the floor with his finger-nails, and thank Heaven he had no
gestures. The O'CONNOR DON whom Members younger than I remember as he sat above the Gangway
in the Parliament of 1874, then represented Roscommon. But for the most part the Irish Members
of those days were Earls, Viscounts, Knights, Baronets, Honourables and Right Honourables.

There were, on the Motion for the Address, big debates in both Houses on this particular night,
when I first saw the SPEAKER in wig and gown. The fate of the Ministry could scarcely be said
to hang in the balance; they knew they were doomed. In the Lords the shrift was short. Not
too late for dinner, their Lordships divided: "Contents 96, Not Contents 168," majority against
Government 72. I well remember COVENTRY's speech; worth reciting as a model for these later
days. He followed LANSDOWNE, and House wanted to hear NORTHAMPTON. When COVENTRY presented
himself, fearful row kicked up. He stood there till silence partially restored, then he said
in deep voice, as who should say "My name is--Norval,"--

"I am Lord COVENTRY. A few words from me. I think the country is in a safe state, and I hope
to find it placed in the hands of the Duke of WELLINGTON. My Lords, I hope I have not detained
you."

Then he sat down.

In the Commons, debate lasted four days; majority against Government 91.

The LABBY of 1841 spoke at length, and was followed by Mr. D'ISRAELI (he spelt it with an apostrophe
in those days): a good Disraelian ring about the last sentence of his speech.

"The House," he said, "ought now to act as it had been acted upon in times when Parliament
was unreformed, when DANBY found himself in a dungeon, and STRAFFORD on a scaffold. Now the
Whigs hold office by abusing the confidence of the Sovereign, and defying the authority of
Parliament."

After him came the still budding BERNAL OSBORNE, CHARLES NAPIER, ROEBUCK, JOHNNIE RUSSELL,
fighting to the last with his back to the wall; COBDEN, HENRY GRATTAN, PAM, MILNER GIBSON,
O'CONNELL, PEEL, and Colonel SIBTHORP.

FROM W.M. THACKERAY TO MR. PUNCH. (FEBRUARY, 1849.)

MR. PUNCH,--"When the future inquirer shall take up your volumes, or a bundle of French plays,
and contrast the performance of your booth with that of the Parisian theatre, he won't fail
to remark how different they are, and what different objects we admire or satirise. As for
your morality.
