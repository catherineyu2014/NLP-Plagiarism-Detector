INTRODUCTION

This discussion of the characters of Pinus is an attempt to determine their taxonomic significance
and their utility for determining the limits of the species. A systematic arrangement follows,
based on the evolution of the cone and seed from the comparatively primitive conditions that
appear in Pinus cembra to the specialized cone and peculiar dissemination of Pinus radiata
and its associates. This arrangement involves no radical change in existing systems. The new
associations in which some of the species appear are the natural result of another point of view.

Experience with Mexican species has led me to believe that a Pine can adapt itself to various
climatic conditions and can modify its growth in response to them. Variations in dimensions
of leaf or cone, the number of leaves in the fascicle, the presence of pruinose branchlets,
etc., which have been thought to imply specific distinctions, are often the evidence of facile
adaptability. In fact such variations, in correlation with climatic variation, may argue, not
for specific distinction, but for specific identity. The remarkable variation in the species
may be attributed partly to this adaptability, partly to a participation, more or less pronounced,
in the evolutionary processes that culminate in the serotinous Pines.

PART I

CHARACTERS OF THE GENUS

THE COTYLEDON. Plate I, figs. 1-3.

The upper half of the embryo in Pinus is a cylindrical fascicle of 4 to 15 cotyledons (fig.
1). The cross-section of a cotyledon is, therefore, a triangle whose angles vary with the number
composing the fascicle. Sections from fascicles of 10 and of 5 cotyledons are shown in figs.
2 and 3. Apart from this difference cotyledons are much alike. Their number varies and is indeterminate
for all species, while any given number is common to so many species that the character is
of no value.

THE PRIMARY LEAF. Plate I, figs. 4-6.

Primary leaves follow the cotyledons immediately (fig. 4) and assume the usual functions of
foliage for a limited period, varying from one to three years, secondary fascicles appearing
here and there in their axils. With the permanent appearance of the secondary leaves the green
primaries disappear and their place is taken by bud-scales, which in the spring and summer
persist as scarious bracts, each subtending a fascicle of secondary leaves. At this stage the
bracts present two important distinctions.

    1. The bract-base is non-decurrent, like the leaf-base
         of Abies                                                fig. 5.
    2. The bract-base is decurrent, like the leaf-base of Picea  fig. 6.

The two sections of the genus, Haploxylon and Diploxylon, established by Koehne on the single
and double fibro-vascular bundle of the leaf, are even more accurately characterized by these
two forms of bract-insertion. The difference between them, however, is most obvious on long
branchlets with wide intervals between the leaf-fascicles.

The bracts of spring-shoots are the scarious bud-scales of the previous winter; but the bracts
of summer-shoots have the form and green color of the primary leaf.

THE BUD. Plate I, figs. 7-11.

The winter-bud is an aggregate of minute buds, each concealed in the axil of a primary leaf
converted into a scarious, more or less fimbriate, bud-scale. Buds from which normal growth
develops appear only at the nodes of the branches. On uninodal branchlets they form an apical
group consisting of a terminal bud with a whorl of subterminal buds about its base. On multinodal
branchlets the inner nodes bear lateral buds which may be latent.

Fig. 7 represents a magnified bud of P. resinosa, first immersed in alcohol to dissolve the
resin, then deprived of its scales. This bud contains both fascicle-buds, destined for secondary
leaves, and larger paler buds at its base. These last are incipient staminate flowers, sufficiently
developed for recognition. Such flower-bearing buds are characteristic of the Hard Pines in
distinction from the Soft Pines whose staminate flowers cannot be identified in the bud.

The want of complete data leaves the invariability of this distinction in question, but with
all species that I have examined, the flowers of Hard Pines are further advanced at the end
of the summer. In the following year they open earlier than those of Soft Pines in the same
locality. The staminate flowers of some Hard Pines (resinosa, sylvestris, etc.,) are not apparent
without removing the bud-scales, but, with most Hard Pines, they form enlargements of the bud
(fig. 9).

Invisible or latent buds are present at the nodes and at the apex of dwarf shoots. The former
are the origin of the numerous shoots that cover the trunk and branches of P. rigida, leiophylla
and a few other species (fig. 10). The latter develop into shoots in the centre of a leaf-fascicle
(fig. 11) when the branchlet, bearing the fascicle, has been injured.

The size, color and form of buds, the presence of resin in quantity, etc., assist in the diagnosis
of species. Occasionally a peculiar bud, like that of P. palustris, may be recognized at once.

THE BRANCHLET. Plate I, figs. 12-14.

The branchlet, as here understood, is the whole of a season's growth from a single bud, and
may consist of a single internode (uninodal, fig. 12-a) or of two or more internodes (multinodal,
fig. 13), each internode being defined by a leafless base and a terminal node of buds.

The spring-shoot is uninodal in all Soft Pines and in many Hard Pines, but, in P. taeda and
its allies and in species with serotinous cones, it is more or less prevalently multinodal.

The uninodal spring-shoot may remain so throughout the growing season and become a uninodal
branchlet. Or a summer-shoot may appear on vigorous branches of any species with the result
of converting a uninodal spring-shoot into an imperfect multinodal branchlet. The summer-shoot
may be recognized, during growth, by its green, not scarious bracts and, at the end of the
season, by the imperfect growth of its wood and foliage (fig. 14).

The perfect multinodal branchlet is formed in the winter-bud (fig. 8-a) and the spring-shoot
is multinodal. It is gradually evolved among the Hard Pines, where it may be absent, rare,
frequent or prevalent, according to the species. In fact there is, in Pinus, an evolutionary
tendency toward multinodal growth, with its beginnings in the summer-shoot and its culmination
in the multinodal winter-bud, most prevalent among the serotinous Pines.

The multinodal shoot is never invariable in a species, but is rare, common or prevalent. This
condition prevents its employment for grouping species. For Pines are not sharply divided into
multinodal and uninodal species, and no exact segregation of them, based on this difference,
is possible. In fact the character is unequally developed among closely related species, such
as P. palustris and caribaea. Both produce multinodal shoots, but the former so rarely that
it should be classed as a uninodal species, while the latter is characteristically multinodal.
The multinodal spring-shoot, however, has a certain correlative value in its relation to other
evolutionary processes that are obvious in the genus.

The length of the branchlet is much influenced by different soils and climates. In species
able to adapt themselves to great changes, the length of the internode may vary from 50 cm.
or more to 1 cm. or less. In the latter case the branch is a series of very short leafless
joints terminated by a crowded penicillate tuft of leaves (fig. 12-b). Such a growth may be
seen on any species (ponderosa, albicaulis, resinosa, etc.) that can survive exposure and poor
nourishment.

The presence of wax, as a bloom on the branchlet, is associated with trees in arid localities,
especially Mexico, where it is very common. With several species the character is inconstant,
apparently dependent on environment, and is a provision against too rapid transpiration.

The branchlet furnishes evidence of the section to which the species belongs, for the bract-bases
persist after the bracts have fallen away. The color of the branchlet, its lustre, the presence
of minute hairs, etc., are often suggestions for determining species.

THE SECONDARY LEAF. Plate II.

Secondary leaves, the permanent foliage of Pines, are borne on dwarf-shoots in the axils of
primary leaves. They form cylindrical fascicles, rarely monophyllous, prevalently of 2, 3 or
5 leaves, occasionally of 4, 6, 7, or 8 leaves. The scales of the fascicle-bud elongate into
a basal sheath, deciduous (fig. 15) in all Soft Pines except P. Nelsonii, persistent (fig.
16) in all Hard Pines except P. leiophylla and Lumholtzii. Inasmuch as these three species
are easily recognized, the fascicle-sheath is useful for sectional distinctions.

EXTERNAL CHARACTERS.

The number of leaves in the fascicle is virtually constant in most species, the variations
being too rare to be worthy of consideration. With some species, however, heteromerous fascicles
are normal. The influences that cause this variation are not always apparent (echinata, etc.),
but with P. ponderosa, leiophylla, sinensis and others, the number of leaves in the fascicle
is, in some degree, dependent on climatic conditions, the smaller number occurring in colder
regions. In Mexico, for example, where snow-capped mountains lie on subtropical table-lands
and extremes of temperature are in juxtaposition, the conditions are favorable for the production
of species with heteromerous fascicles, and the number of leaves in the fascicle possesses
often climatic rather than specific significance.

Among conifers, the leaf of Pinus attains extraordinary length with great variation, from 5
cm. or less to 50 cm. or more, the maximum for each species being usually much more than twice
the minimum. Climate is the predominating influence; for the shortest leaves occur on alpine
and boreal species, the longest leaves on species in or near the tropics.

The length of the leaf is complicated by the peculiarities of individual trees and by pathological
influences; as a general rule, however, the length of leaves is less or greater according to
unfavorable or favorable conditions of temperature, moisture, soil and exposure. Therefore
the dimensions of the leaf may be misleading. It can be said, however, that certain species
always produce short leaves, others leaves of medium length, and others very long leaves.

Persistence of the leaf varies with the species and with the individual tree. But it is noteworthy
that the longest persistence is associated with short leaves (Balfouriana, albicaulis, montana,
etc.).

INTERNAL CHARACTERS.

Since the leaf-fascicle is cylindrical, the cross-section of a leaf is a sector, its proportional
part, of a circle. Theoretically the leaf, in section, should indicate the number of leaves
composing its fascicle. This is absolutely true for fascicles of two leaves only. No fascicle
of five leaves, that I have examined, is equally apportioned among its five members. It may
be divided in various ways, one of which is shown in fig. 18, where the leaf (a) might be mistaken
for one of a fascicle of 3, and the leaf (b) for one of a fascicle of 6. Therefore if absolute
certainty is required, a fascicle of triquetral leaves is best determined by actual count.

The transverse section of a leaf may be conveniently divided into three distinct parts--1,
the dermal tissues, epiderm, hypoderm and stomata (fig. 17-a)--2, the green tissue, containing
the resin-ducts (fig. 17-b)--3, the stelar tissues, enclosed by the endoderm and containing
the fibro-vascular bundle (fig. 17-c).

THE DERMAL TISSUES OF THE LEAF.

The stomata of Pine leaves are depressed below the surface and interrupt the continuity of
epiderm and hypoderm. They are wanting on the dorsal surface of the leaves of several Soft
Pines, constantly in some species, irregularly in others. In Hard Pines, however, all surfaces
of the leaf are stomatiferous. In several species of the Soft Pines the longitudinal lines
of stomata are very conspicuous from the white bloom which modifies materially the general
color of the foliage.

Under the action of hydrochloric acid the hypoderm is sharply differentiated from the epiderm
by a distinct reddish tint, but without the aid of a reagent the two tissues do not always
differ in appearance. The cells of epiderm and hypoderm may be so similar that they appear
to form a single tissue. In most species, however, the epiderm is distinct, while the cells
of the hypoderm are either uniform, with equally thin or thick walls--or biform, with very
thin walls in the outer row of cells and very thick walls in the inner row or rows of cells--or
multiform, with cell-walls gradually thicker toward the centre of the leaf. These conditions
may be tabulated as follows--

    Cells of epiderm and hypoderm similar              fig. 19.
    Cells of epiderm and hypoderm distinct.
      Cells of hypoderm uniform, thin or thick    figs. 20, 21.
      Cells of hypoderm biform                         fig. 22.
      Cells of hypoderm multiform                      fig. 23.

The biform hypoderm is not always obvious (clausa, Banksiana, etc.) where in some leaves there
is but one row of cells. But with the examination of other leaves one or more cells of a second
row will be found with very thick walls. Among Hard Pines there is no Old World species with
a biform hypoderm. But there are a few American species with uniform hypoderm (resinosa, tropicalis,
patula and Greggii); while, in some leaves of the few American Hard Pines with multiform hypoderm,
the uniform hypoderm is a variation.

THE GREEN TISSUE.

In this tissue are the resin-ducts, each with a border of cells, corresponding in appearance
and in chemical reaction with the cells of the hypoderm and with thinner or thicker walls.
With reference to the green tissue the foliar duct may be in one of four positions.

    1. External   against the hypoderm                    fig. 24.
    2. Internal   against the endoderm                    fig. 28.
    3. Medial     in the green tissue, touching neither
                    hypoderm nor endoderm                 fig. 26.
    4. Septal     touching both endoderm and hypoderm,
                    forming a septum                      fig. 30.

Among the Soft Pines the external duct is invariable in the subsection Paracembra. It is also
characteristic of the Strobi, where it is sometimes associated with a medial duct. In the Cembrae
and the Flexiles, however, the ducts are external in some species, or medial or both in others,
without regard to the affinities of these species.

Among the Hard Pines the external duct is characteristic of the Old World, there being but
two American Pines with this character (resinosa and tropicalis). The internal duct is peculiar
to Hard Pines of the New World, its presence in Old World species being extremely rare. The
medial duct is common to species of both hemispheres, either alone or in association with ducts
in other positions (figs. 25, 27). The septal duct is peculiar to a few species (oocarpa, tropicalis,
and less frequently Pringlei and Merkusii). I have also seen it in a leaf of P. canariensis.
The internal and septal ducts appear to be confined to the species of warm-temperate or tropical
countries.

The number of resin-ducts of a single leaf may be limited to two or three (strobus, koraiensis,
etc.), but in many species it is exceedingly variable and often large (pinaster, sylvestris,
etc.). Eighteen or more ducts in a single leaf have been recorded. Such large numbers are peculiar
to Pinus. Occasionally a single leaf, possibly the leaves of a single tree, may be without
ducts, but this is never true of all the leaves of a species.

THE STELAR TISSUES.

The walls of the endoderm are, in most species, uniform, but, with P. albicaulis and some species
of western North America, the outer walls of the cells are conspicuously thickened (fig. 32).
Both thin and thick walls may be found among the leaves of the group Macrocarpae and of the
species longifolia.

The fibro-vascular bundle of the leaf is single in Soft Pines, double in Hard Pines. This distinction
is employed by Koehne as the basis of his two sections, Haploxylon and Diploxylon. The double
bundle is usually obvious even when the two parts are contiguous, but they are sometimes completely
merged into an apparently single bundle. This condition, however, is never constant in a Hard
Pine, and a little investigation will discover a leaf with a true double bundle.

Some cells about the fibro-vascular bundle acquire thick walls with the appearance and chemical
reaction of the hypoderm cells. Among the Soft Pines this condition is most obvious in the
group Cembroides. Among the Hard Pines it appears in all degrees of development, being absent
(figs. 24, 25), sometimes in irregular lines above and below the bundle (figs. 26, 27, 30,
31), or forming a conspicuous tissue between and partly enclosing the two parts of the bundle
(figs. 28, 29).

The leaf-section furnishes sectional and other lesser distinctions. It is often decisive in
separating species otherwise difficult to distinguish (nigra and resinosa or Thunbergii and
sinensis, etc.). Sometimes it is sufficiently distinct to determine a species without recourse
to other characters (tropicalis, oocarpa, Merkusii, etc.). An intimate knowledge of the leaf-section,
with an understanding of the limits of its variation, is a valuable equipment for recognizing
species.

THE FLOWERS. Plate III, figs. 33-39.

The flowers in Pinus are monoecious, the pistillate in the position of a long shoot, taking
the place of a subterminal or lateral bud, the staminate in the position of a dwarf-shoot,
taking the place of a leaf-fascicle but confined to the basal part of the internode.
