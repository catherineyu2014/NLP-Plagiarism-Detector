     I am so much interested to read of the pets that are often written
     about in the Post-office Box that I thought the other children
     might feel the same interest in mine. I have two kittens--a white
     one named Julius Cæsar, and a gray one named Spitz, because it
     spits at everybody who comes near it. I also have three little
     chickens named Bud, Blossom, and Cherry. They have no mother, and
     I am bringing them up by hand. They run after me every time I go
     near their box, and sometimes they seem to think Julius Cæsar is
     their mother, and they try to cuddle in his fur.

     My papa takes YOUNG PEOPLE for me, and I am so happy when it
     comes. Every Saturday, when papa gets off from the street car, I
     run out to meet him, and I say, "Papa, have you got HARPER'S YOUNG
     PEOPLE?"

     I have a pet pigeon with a red breast, a pussy, and a little brown
     calf. I had two beautiful chickens, but they died. I am seven
     years old.

  MONA LAKE, MICHIGAN.

     My home is at Allegan, but now we are staying at this beautiful
     lake. It is only a station on the Grand Haven Railroad, and nobody
     lives here except the station-master and one or two others,
     besides those who are camping out. Most of the people live in
     tents, but we live in a house.

     I think Mona Lake is a beautiful place. There are picnics here
     almost every day. The chief attractions are boating, fishing,
     bathing, and the well of mineral water, which is said to be very
     fine. The lake itself is about seven miles long, and where we live
     it is about a quarter of a mile wide. It was named after my sister
     Mona, who was named after Castle Mona, in the Isle of Man. Papa
     has the American flag on a flag-staff on our house, and the Manx
     flag, with the three legs, on a pole set in the ground.

     Pickerel, bass, cat-fish, sunfish, and perch are caught here. Pa
     caught a cat-fish that weighed fifteen pounds.

     There are two camps here now. They are called "Kat-fish Kamp" and
     "Camp Toodle La." The last one is named after a song they sing
     here a good deal. It begins,

  "Gentleman frog lived in the spring,
      Toodle la! toodle la!"

     I have taken YOUNG PEOPLE from the first number, and I like it
     very much. I think the Post-office Box is splendid. I have read
     the letter from Jennie Anderson, and should like to hear more
     about her home in India.

     We have three canaries, and one of them is almost as old as I am.
     I am fourteen.

     I have four dolls. Their names are Bertha, Fanny, Juliette, and
     Rosy. Bertha has beautiful black hair, and Fanny has golden hair.

     I, too, go very often to Spanish Fort. We had a little canary. It
     was a beautiful singer. But one day my aunt left the door open
     when she cleaned the cage, and it flew away, and never has been
     found. I am ten years old, and I have been to England, France, and
     Germany.

A CONSTANT READER.--During early colonial times both Indians and negroes were held as slaves
in Massachusetts, and advertisements of negroes for sale were common in the Boston News Letter
and other publications of the day. Ship-loads of fresh importations of negroes were constantly
arriving from the African coast. Meanwhile the feeling against slavery was steadily gaining
ground, and much public discussion on the subject took place. The exact date of the abolition
of slavery in Massachusetts is a disputed point, but it is generally conceded to have legally
taken place at the time of the adoption of the State Constitution in 1780, although advertisements
of slave property for sale appear in the newspapers of a later date. In 1788 the Legislature
of Massachusetts passed an act to prevent the slave-trade, inflicting a heavy fine upon any
citizen of the commonwealth who should import, transport, buy, or sell any of the inhabitants
of Africa as slaves, or fit out vessels to be employed in the traffic.

Public feeling was for a long time hostile to the negro race, and during the early part of
the present century "blacks" were repeatedly warned to depart out of the commonwealth, the
pretext being to avoid the increase of a pauper population, "which threatened to become both
injurious and burdensome."
