PREFACE.

It may be regarded as a fortunate circumstance that we are able to add to the Society's publications
this volume of RADISSON'S VOYAGES. The narratives contained in it are the record of events
and transactions in which the author was a principal actor. They were apparently written without
any intention of publication, and are plainly authentic and trustworthy. They have remained
in manuscript more than two hundred years, and in the mean time appear to have escaped the
notice of scholars, as not even extracts from them have, so far as we are aware, found their
way into print. The author was a native of France, and had an imperfect knowledge of the English
language. The journals, with the exception of the last in the volume, are, however, written
in that language, and, as might be anticipated, in orthography, in the use of words, and in
the structure of sentences, conform to no known standard of English composition. But the meaning
is in all cases clearly conveyed, and, in justice both to the author and the reader, they have
been printed verbatim et literatim, as in the original manuscripts. We desire to place upon
record our high appreciation of the courtesy extended to the Editor of this volume by the governors
of the Bodleian Library and of the British Museum, in allowing him to copy the original manuscripts
in their possession. Our thanks likewise are here tendered to Mr. Edward Denham for the gratuitous
contribution of the excellent index which accompanies the volume.

INTRODUCTION.

The author of the narratives contained in this volume was Peter Esprit Radisson, who emigrated
from France to Canada, as he himself tells us, on the 24th day of May, 1651. He was born at
St. Malo, and in 1656, at Three Rivers, in Canada, married Elizabeth, the daughter of Madeleine
Hainault. [Footnote: Vide History of the Ojibways, by the Rev. E. D. Neill, ed. 1885.] Radisson
says that he lived at Three Rivers, where also dwelt "my natural parents, and country-people,
and my brother, his wife and children." [Footnote: The Abbe Cyprian Tanguay, the best genealogical
authority in Canada, gives the following account of the family: Francoise Radisson, a daughter
of Pierre Esprit, married at Quebec, in 1668, Claude Volant de St. Claude, born in 1636, and
had eight children. Pierre and Claude, eldest sons, became priests. Francoise died in infancy:
Marguerite married Noel le Gardeur; Francoise died in infancy; Etienne, born October 29, 1664,
married in 1693 at Sorel, but seems to have had no issue. Jean Francois married Marguerite
Godfrey at Montreal in 1701. Nicholas, born in 1668, married Genevieve Niel, July 30, 1696,
and both died in 1703, leaving two of their five sons surviving.

There are descendants of Noel le Gardeur who claim Radisson as their ancestor, and also descendants
of Claude Volant, apparently through Nicholas. Among these descendants of the Volant family
is the Rt. Rev. Joseph Thomas Duhamel, who was consecrated Bishop of Ottawa, Canada, October
28, 1874.

Of Medard Chouart's descendants, no account of any of the progeny of his son Jean Baptiste,
born July 25, 1654, can be found.] This brother, often alluded to in Radisson's narratives
as his companion on his journeys, was Medard Chouart, "who was the son of Medard and Marie
Poirier, of Charly St. Cyr, France, and in 1641, when only sixteen years old, came to Canada."
[Footnote: Chouart's daughter Marie Antoinette, born June 7, 1661, married first Jean Jalot
in 1679. He was a surgeon, born in 1648, and killed by the Iroquois, July 2, 1690. He was called
Des Groseilliers. She had nine children by Jalot, and there are descendants from them in Canada.
On the 19th December, 1695, she married, secondly, Jean Bouchard, by whom she had six children.
The Bouchard-Dorval family of Montreal descends from this marriage. Vide Genealogical Dictionary
of Canadian Families, Quebec, 1881.] He was a pilot, and married, 3rd September, 1647, Helen,
the daughter of Abraham Martin, and widow of Claude Etienne. Abraham Martin left his name to
the celebrated Plains of Abraham, near Quebec. She dying in 1651, Chouart married, secondly,
at Quebec, August 23, 1653, the sister of Radisson, Margaret Hayet, the widow of John Veron
Grandmenil. In Canada, Chouart acted as a donne, or lay assistant, in the Jesuit mission near
Lake Huron. He left the service of the mission about 1646, and commenced trading with the Indians
for furs, in which he was very successful. With his gains he is supposed to have purchased
some land in Canada, as he assumed the seigneurial title of "Sieur des Groseilliers."

Radisson spent more than ten years trading with the Indians of Canada and the far West, making
long and perilous journeys of from two to three years each, in company with his brother-in-law,
Des Groseilliers. He carefully made notes during his wanderings from 1652 to 1664, which he
afterwards copied out on his voyage to England in 1665. Between these years he made four journeys,
and heads his first narrative with this title: "The Relation of my Voyage, being in Bondage
in the Lands of the Irokoits, which was the next year after my coming into Canada, in the yeare
1651, the 24th day of May." In 1652 a roving band of Iroquois, who had gone as far north as
the Three Rivers, carried our author as a captive into their country, on the banks of the Mohawk
River. He was adopted into the family of a "great captayne who had killed nineteen men with
his own hands, whereof he was marked on his right thigh for as many as he had killed." In the
autumn of 1653 he accompanied the tribe in his village on a warlike incursion into the Dutch
territory. They arrived "the next day in a small brough of the Hollanders," Rensselaerswyck,
and on the fourth day came to Fort Orange. Here they remained several days, and Radisson says:
"Our treaty's being done, overladened with bootyes abundantly, we putt ourselves in the way
that we came, to see again our village."
