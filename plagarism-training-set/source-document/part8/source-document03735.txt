PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.

I wish to say, in a very few words, that this book is intended to be a simple account of the
great Old Masters in painting of every age and country, with descriptions of their most famous
works, for the use of learners and outsiders in art. The book is not, and could not well be,
exhaustive in its nature. I have avoided definitions of schools, considering that these should
form a later and more elaborate portion of art education, and preferring to group my 'painters'
according to what I hold to be the primitive arrangements of time, country, and rank in art.

PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.

The restrictions with regard to space under which the little volume called "The Old Masters"
was originally written, caused me to omit, to my regret, many names great, though not first,
in art. The circulation which the book has attained induces me to do what I can to remedy the
defect, and render the volume more useful by adding two chapters--the one on Italian and the
other on German, Dutch, and Flemish masters. These chapters consist almost entirely of condensed
notes taken from two trustworthy sources, to which I have been already much indebted--Sir C,
and Lady Eastlake's version of Kugler's "Handbook of Italian Art," and Dr. Waagen's "Handbook,"--remodelled
from Kugler--of German, Dutch, and Flemish art, revised by J.A. Crowe. I have purposely given
numerous records of those Dutch painters whose art has been specially popular in England and
who are in some cases better represented in our country than in their own.

THE OLD MASTERS AND THEIR PICTURES.

A pencil and paper, a box of colours, and a scrap-book, form so often a child's favourite toys
that one might expect that a very large portion of men and women would prove painters. But,
as we grow in years and knowledge, the discrepancy between nature and our attempts to copy
nature, strike us more and more, until we turn in dissatisfaction and disgust from the vain effort.

There was only one old woman in an Esquimaux tribe who could be called forward to draw with
a stick on the sand a sufficiently graphic likeness of the Erebus and the Terror. It is only
a few groups of men belonging to different countries, throughout the centuries, who have been
able to give us paintings to which we turn in wonder and admiration, and say that these are
in their degree fair exponents of nature. The old painter's half-haughty, half-humble protest
was true--it is 'God Almighty,' who in raising here and there men above their fellows, 'makes
painters.'

But let us be thankful that the old propensity to delight in a facsimile, or in an idealized
version of nature, survives in the very common satisfaction and joy--whether cultivated or
uncultivated--- derived from looking at pictures, thinking over their details, striving to
understand the meaning of the painters, and proceeding farther to consider the lives and times
which throw light on works of genius. Music itself is not more universally and gladly listened
and responded to, than pictures are looked at and remembered.

Thus I have no fear of failing to interest you, my readers, in my subject if I can only treat
it sympathetically,--enter at a humble distance into the spirit of the painters and of their
paintings, and place before you some of the paintings by reverent and loving word-painting
such as others have achieved, and such as I may strive to attain to, that you may be in a sort
early familiar with these paintings, before you see them in engravings and photographs, and
on canvas and in fresco, as I trust you may be privileged to see many of them, when you may
hail them not only for what they are, the glories of art, but for what they have been to you
in thoughts of beauty and high desires.

Of the old Greek paintings, of which there are left isolated specimens dug up in Herculaneum
and Pompeii, I cannot afford to say anything, and of the more modern Greek art which was spread
over Europe after the fall of Constantinople I need on Europe the birth-place of painting as
of other arts, that Greek painting which illustrated early Christianity, was painting in its
decline and decay, borrowing not only superstitious conventionalities, but barbaric attributes
of gilding and blazoning to hide its infirmity and poverty. Virgins of the same weak and meaningless
type, between attenuated saints or angels, and doll-like child-Christs in the one invariable
attitude holding up two fingers of a baby hand to bless the spectator and worshippers, were
for ever repeated. In a similar manner the instances of rude or meagre contemporary paintings
with which the early Christians adorned their places of worship and the sepulchres of their
dead in the basilicas and catacombs of Rome, are very curious and interesting for their antiquity
and their associations, and as illustrations of faith; but they present no intrinsic beauty
or worth. They are not only clumsy and childish designs ill executed, but they are rendered
unintelligible to all save the initiated in such hieroglyphics, by offering an elaborate ground-work
of type, antitype, and symbol, on which the artist probably spent a large part of his strength.
Lambs and lilies, serpents, vines, fishes, dolphins, phoenixes, cocks, anchors, and javelins
played nearly as conspicuous a part in this art as did the dead believer, or his or her patron
saint, who might have been supposed to form the principal figure in the picture.
