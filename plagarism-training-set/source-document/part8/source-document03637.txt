He afterwards entered into the Portuguese service, where he remained some years; but, being
greatly attached to his own country, he returned. He could not, however, conscientiously take
the oaths to Government, and therefore never had any other military employment. "With much
truth, honour, and humanity," relates Mrs. Grant, "he inherited his father's wit and self-possession,
with a vein of keen satire which he indulged in bitter expressions against the enemies of his
family. Some of these I have seen, and heard many songs of his composing, which showed no contemptible
power of poetic genius, although rude and careless of polish." He sank into habits of dissipation
and over-conviviality, which impaired a reputation otherwise high in his neighbourhood, and
became careless and hopeless of himself. What little he had to bequeath was left to a lady
of his own name to whom he was attached, and who remained unmarried long after his death.

It is rather remarkable that Archibald Campbell Fraser, generally, from his command of the
Invernessshire militia, called Colonel Fraser, should survive his five sons, and that the estates
which Lord Lovat had sacrificed so much to secure to his own line should revert to another
family of the clan Fraser,--the Frasers of Stricken, the present proprietors of Lovat and Stricken,
being in Aberdeenshire the twenty-second in succession from Simon Fraser of Invernessshire.[266]

[118] Anderson's Historical Account of the Family of Frisel or Fraser, p. 5.

[119] One of Lord Lovat's family--it is not easy to ascertain which--emigrated after the Rebellion
of 1745 into Ireland, and settled in that country, where he possessed considerable landed property,
which is still enjoyed by one of his descendants. There is an epitaph on the family vault of
this branch of the Frizells or Frazers, in the churchyard of Old Ross, in the County of Wexford,
bearing this inscription:--"The burial place of Charles Frizell, son of Charles Fraser Frizell
of Ross, and formerly of Beaufort, North Britain." For this information I am indebted to the
Rev. John Frizell, of Great Normanton, Derbyshire, and one of this Irish branch of the family,
of which his brother is the lineal representative.

[123] In speaking of the other members of the family, Mr. Anderson remarks:--"The parish registers
of Kiltarlity, Kirkill, and Kilmorack, were at the same time examined with the view of tracing
the other children of Thomas of Beaufort, but the communications of the various clergymen led
to the knowledge that no memorials of them exist. The remote branches called to the succession
in General Fraser's entail proves, to a certainty, that these children died unmarried."--Anderson's
Historical Account of the Family of Fraser. It appears, however, from a previous note, that
a branch of the family still exists in Ireland.
