CHAPTER I

THE WHITE CHIEF OF KATLEEAN

It was quiet in the great store room of the Alaska Fur and Trading Company's post at Kat-lee-an.
The westering sun streaming in through a side window lighted up shelves of brightly labeled
canned goods and a long, scarred counter piled high with gay blankets and men's rough clothing.
Back of the big, pot-bellied stove--cold now--that stood near the center of the room, lidless
boxes of hard-tack and crackers yawned in open defiance of germs.  An amber, mote-filled ray
slanted toward the moss-chinked log wall where a row of dusty fox and wolverine skins hung--pelts
discarded when the spring shipment of furs had been made, because of flaws visible only to
expert eyes.

At the far end of the room the possessor of those expert eyes sat before a rough home-made
desk.  There was a rustle of papers and he closed the ledger in front of him with an air of
relief.  He clapped his hands smartly.  Almost on the instant the curtain hanging in the doorway
at the side of the desk was drawn aside and a small, brown feminine hand materialized.

"My cigarettes, Decitan."

The man's voice was low, with that particular vibrant quality often found in the voices of
men accustomed to command inferior peoples on the far outposts of civilization.

The curtain wavered again and from behind the folds a brown arm, bare and softly rounded, accompanied
the hand that set down a tray of smoking materials.

With a careless nod toward his invisible servitor, the man picked up a cigarette and lighted
it.  He took one long, deep pull.  Tossing it aside he swung his chair about and faced the
open doorway that gave on a courtyard and the bay beyond.

He readjusted the scarlet band about his narrow hips.  Flannel-shirted, high-booted, he stretched
his six-foot length in the tilting chair and clasped his hands behind his head.  The movement
loosened a lock of black hair which fell heavily across his forehead.  His eyes, long, narrow
and the color of pale smoke, drowsed beneath brows that met above his nose.  Thin, sharply
defined nostrils quivered under the slightest emotion, and startling against the whiteness
of his face, was a short, pointed beard, black and silky as a woman's hair.  When Paul Kilbuck,
the white trader of Katleean, smiled, his thin, red lips parted over teeth white and perfect,
but there was that in the long, pointed incisors that brought to mind the clean fangs of a
wolf-dog.

He closed his pale eyes now and smiled to himself.  His work on the Company's books was finished
for the present.  He hated the petty details of account keeping, but since the death of old
Add-'em-up Sam, his helper and accountant, who had departed this world six months before during
a spell of delirium tremens, the trader had been obliged to do his own.

Queer and clever things had Add-'em-up done to the books.  Down in San Francisco the directors
of the Alaska Fur and Trading Company had long suspected it no doubt, but it was not for nothing
that Paul Kilbuck was known up and down the coast of Alaska as the White Chief.  No other man
in the North had such power and influence among the Thlinget tribes. No other man sent in such
quantities of prime pelts; hence the White Chief of Katleean had never been obliged to give
too strict an accounting of his stewardship.  Taking what belongs to a company is not, in the
elastic code of the North, considered stealing.  "God is high above and the Czar is far away,"
said the plundering, roistering old Russians of Baranoff's day, and the spirit in the isolated
posts had not changed, though Russian adventurers come no more to rape Alaska of her riches,
and the Stars and Stripes now floats over the old-time Russian stronghold at Sitka.

For eighteen years Kilbuck had been the agent of the Company.  In trading-posts up and down
the coast where the trappers and prospectors gather to outfit, many tales of the White Chief
were afloat: his trips to the Outside[1]; his lavish spending of money; his hiring of private
cars to take him from Seattle to New York; his princely entertainment of beautiful women. 
In every story told of Paul Kilbuck there were women.  Sometimes they were white, but more
often they were dusky beauties of the North.

Among the several dark-eyed Thlinget women who occupied the mysterious quarters back of the
log store, there was always rejoicing when the White Chief returned from his visits to the
States.  He was a generous master, bringing back with him many presents from the land of the
white people--rings, beads, trinkets, and yards of bright colored silks.  The favorites of
his household fondled these gifts for a time with soft, guttural cries of delight and gentle
strokings of their slim, brown hands, and then laid them away in fantastically carved Indian
chests of yellow cedar.

Perhaps the strangest of these gifts had been a pair of homing pigeons, which had thrived and
multiplied under the care of Add-'em-up Sam.  A fluttering of wings now outside the doorway
bespoke the presence of some of them, and Kilbuck stirred in his chair and opened his eyes.

He had been many hours alone in the store, but he had been prepared for that today.  The entire
post of Katleean was getting ready for the Potlatch, an Indian festival scheduled for the near
future.  For this occasion Kayak Bill, in his carefully secreted still across the lagoon, had
completed a particularly potent batch of moonshine, known locally as hootch.  The arrival,
earlier in the afternoon, of the jocose old hootch-maker with a canoe-load of his fiery beverage,
had been a signal for a gathering at his cabin across the courtyard.  From the sounds that
now floated out on the late afternoon air, he must already have distributed generous samples
of his brew.

The White Chief rose from his chair and reached for another cigarette. As usual, he tossed
it away after one long, deep inhalation.  Before the smoke cleared from his head, he was crossing
the store room with his easy panther tread--the result of former years of moccasin-wearing.

In the open doorway he paused, leaned against the portal and hooked one thumb beneath his scarlet
belt.  His narrow eyes swept the scene before him.  Across the bay, between purple hills, a
valley lay dreaming in rose-lavender mist.  Blue above the August haze was a glimpse of a glacier,
and farther back, peaks rose tier upon tier in the vague, amethystine distance.
