Kaiser Wilhelm's Speech from the Balcony of the Palace, Berlin, Aug. 2.

     I thank you for the love and loyalty shown me. When I enter upon a
     fight let all party strife cease. We are German brothers and
     nothing else. All parties have attacked me in times of peace. I
     forgive them with all my heart. I hope and wish that the good
     German sword will emerge victorious in the right.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE.

Kaiser Wilhelm II., Opening Special Session of the Reichstag in White Room of the Royal Palace,
Berlin, Aug. 4.

     Honored Sirs: It is in an hour fraught with fate that I have
     assembled about me all the representatives of the German people.
     For almost half a century we have been able to keep to the path of
     peace. The attempts to attribute a warlike temperament to Germany
     and to circumscribe its position in the world have often put to
     severe tests the patience of our people. With unswerving honesty,
     my Government, even in provoking circumstances, has pursued as its
     highest aim the development of all moral, spiritual, and economic
     powers. The world has been witness how tirelessly we strove in the
     first rank during the pressure and confusion of the last few years
     to spare the nations of Europe a war between the great powers.

     The very grave dangers which had arisen owing to the events in the
     Balkans appeared to have been overcome, but then the murder of my
     friend, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, opened up a great abyss. My
     high ally, the Emperor and King Francis Joseph, was compelled to
     take up arms to defend the security of his empire against dangerous
     intrigues from a neighboring State. In the pursuit of her proper
     interests the Dual Monarchy has found her path obstructed by the
     Russian Empire. Not only our duty as an ally calls us to the side
     of Austria-Hungary, but on us falls also the mighty task of
     defending the ancient community of culture of the two kingdoms and
     our own position in the world against the attack of hostile powers.
     With a heavy heart I have been compelled to mobilize my army
     against a neighbor with whom it has fought side by side on so many
     fields of battle. With sincere sorrow I saw a friendship broken of
     which Germany had given faithful proofs. The Imperial Russian
     Government, yielding to the pressure of an insatiable nationalism,
     has taken sides with a State which by encouraging criminal attacks
     has brought on the evil of this war. That France, also, placed
     herself on the side of our enemies could not surprise us. Too often
     have our efforts to arrive at friendlier relations with the French
     Republic come in collision with old hopes and ancient malice.

     Honored Sirs: What human insight and power could do to arm a people
     against the last extremities has been done with your patriotic
     help. The hostility which has been smouldering for a long time in
     the East and in the West has now burst into bright flames. The
     present situation did not proceed from transient conflicts of
     interest or diplomatic entanglements, it is the result of an ill
     will which has for many years been active against the strength and
     the prosperity of the German Empire. We are not incited by lust for
     conquest, we are inspired by the unyielding determination to keep
     for ourselves and all future generations the place which God has
     given us.

     From the proofs which have been given you, you will see how my
     Government, and especially my Chancellor, strove up to the last
     moment to avert the worst. We grasp the sword in compulsory
     self-defense, with clean hands and a clean conscience.

     To the peoples and races of the German Empire my call goes forth to
     defend with all their strength and in brotherly co-operation with
     our ally that which we have created by peaceful labor. After the
     example of our fathers, firmly and faithfully, sincerely and with
     chivalry, humbly before God and battling joyfully before the enemy,
     let us place our trust in the eternal Omnipotence, and may He
     strengthen our defense and bring it to a good end!

     To you, honored sirs, the whole German people, assembled about its
     Princes and its leaders, look this day. Make your decision
     unanimously and quickly. That is my heartfelt wish.

     Gentlemen (addressing the Deputies directly): You have read what I
     said to my people the other day from the balcony of my castle. I
     repeat now that I no longer know any parties. I know only Germans.
     And in order to testify that you are firmly resolved without
     distinction of party to stand by my side through danger and death,
     I call upon the leaders of the different parties in this House to
     come forward and lay their hands in mine as a pledge.

       *       *       *       *       *

TO THE GERMAN ARMY AND NAVY.

Proclamation by Kaiser Wilhelm II.

     After three and forty years of peace I call the men of Germany to
     arms.

     It has become necessary to protect our most sacred possessions, the
     Fatherland, our very hearths against ruthless destruction.

     Enemies on every hand! That is the situation. A mighty struggle, a
     great sacrifice confronts us.

     I trust that the old spirit of battle still lives on in the German
     people, that powerful spirit of battle which grapples with the foe
     wherever it meets it, be the cost what it may, which has ever been
     the terror and fear of our enemies.

     Soldiers of Germany, in you I place my trust! In each one of you
     lives the passionate will to conquer, which nothing can subdue.
     Each one of you knows, if need be, how to die a hero's death.

     Remember our great and glorious past!

     Remember that you are Germans!

     God help us!

     WILHELM.

TO GERMAN WOMEN.

An Appeal from the Kaiserin.

     On the summons of the Emperor our people are preparing for an
     unprecedented struggle, which it did not invoke and which it is
     only carrying on in its defense. Whoever can bear arms will
     joyfully hasten to the colors to defend the Fatherland with his
     blood. The struggle will be gigantic and the wounds to be healed
     innumerable, therefore I call upon you women and girls of Germany,
     and all to whom it is not given to fight for our beloved home, for
     help. Let every one now do what lies in her power to lighten the
     struggle for our husbands, sons, and brothers. I know that in all
     ranks of our people, without exception, the will exists to fulfill
     this high ideal, but may the Lord God strengthen us in our holy
     work of love, which summons us women to devote all our strength to
     the Fatherland in its decisive struggle.

     The organizations primarily concerned who should be supported first
     have already sent out notices regarding the mustering of volunteers
     and the collection of gifts of all kinds.

     AUGUSTE VICTORIA.

"TO THE LAST BREATH OF MAN AND HORSE."

Proclamation by Kaiser Wilhelm II.

     Since the foundation of the empire it has been for forty-three
     years the object of the efforts of myself and my ancestors to
     preserve the peace of the world and to advance by peaceful means
     our vigorous development. But our adversaries were jealous of the
     successes of our work. There has been latent hostility on the east
     and on the west and beyond the sea. It was borne by us till now, as
     we were aware of our responsibility and power. Now, however, these
     adversaries wish to humiliate us, asking that we should look on
     with crossed arms and watch our enemies preparing themselves for a
     coming attack. They will not suffer that we maintain resolute
     fidelity to our ally who is fighting for its position as a great
     power and with whose humiliation our power and honor would equally
     be lost. So the sword must decide.

     In the midst of perfect peace the enemy surprises us. Therefore to
     arms! Any dallying, any temporizing would be which our fathers
     founded; to be or not to be, is the question for the empire which
     our fathers founded. To be or not to be German power and German
     existence. We shall resist to the last breath of man and horse, and
     shall fight out the struggle even against a world of enemies. Never
     has Germany been subdued when it was united. Forward with God, who
     will be with us as He was with our ancestors!

     Berlin, Aug. 6. WILHELM.

JOY IN GLORIOUS VICTORY.

Speech of Kaiser at a Parade During Swift German Advance Toward Paris.

     Comrades: I have gathered you around me here in order to take joy
     with you in the glorious victory which our comrades have in several
     days of hot battle won with their swords. Troops out of every nook
     and cranny of the empire helped one another in invincible bravery
     and unshakable loyalty to win great results. There stood together
     under the leadership of the son of the Bavarian King and fought,
     with equal blades, troops of all ages, active, reservists, and
     landwehr.

     For our victory we are thankful, in the first place, to our God,
     (unserem alten Gott.) He will not desert us, since we stand for a
     holy cause. Many of our comrades have already fallen in battle.
     They died as heroes for the Fatherland. We will think of them with
     honor here, and shout to the honor of those still in the field.
     Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

     We still have many a bloody battle before us. Let us hope for
     further successes like this. We shall not relent, and we shall get
     to the enemy's hide. We shall not lose our faith and trust in our
     good old God up there, (unserem guten alten Gott dort oben.) We are
     determined to win, and we must win.

       *       *       *       *       *

FIRST SUCCESSFUL BATTLE.

Telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm II. to Chief of Troops in Upper Alsace, Aug. 15.

     Grateful to God, Who was with us. I thank you and your troops for
     the first victory. Please convey to all the troops which took part
     in the fight my imperial thanks in the name of the Fatherland.

"UP AND AT THE FOES."

Kaiser's Farewell Speech to First Regiment of Foot Guards at Potsdam.

     I draw the sword that with God's help I have kept all these years
     in the scabbard. I have drawn the sword, which without victory and
     without honor I cannot sheath again. All of you will see to it that
     only in honor is it returned to the scabbard. You are my guarantee
     that I can dictate peace to my enemies. Up and at the foes, and
     down with the enemies of Brandenburg!

ON VICTORY NEAR METZ.

From Cabinet Order of Kaiser Wilhelm II., Published in Berlin Aug. 23.

     The mobilization and concentration of the army is now complete, the
     German railways having carried out the enormous transport movements
     with unparalleled certainty and punctuality. With a heart filled
     with gratitude my first thoughts turn to those who since 1870-71
     have worked quietly upon the development of an organization which
     has emerged from its first serious test with such glorious success.
     To all who have co-operated with them I wish to express my imperial
     thanks for their loyal devotion to duty in making possible in
     obedience to my call the transportation of armed masses of German
     troops against my enemies. The present achievement [near Metz]
     convinces me that the railways of the country will be equal to the
     heaviest demands that might be made upon them during the course of
     the gigantic struggle in which we are engaged for the future of the
     German Nation.

THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN.

Kaiser's Telegram from Dresden to the King of Saxony, Oct. 2.

     I am very glad to be able to send you the best reports of the
     Nineteenth Army Corps and the Twelfth Reserve Corps. I visited
     yesterday the Third Army and greeted especially the brave 181st
     Regiment, to which I expressed my recognition. I found your third
     son and your brother Max as well as Laffert and Kirchbach in the
     best of health. The spirit among the men is splendid. With such an
     army we shall be able to complete victoriously the rest of our
     difficult task. To this end may the Almighty stand by us.

     WILHELM.

HIS INDISCRETION WAS "CALCULATED."

Interview With Kaiser Wilhelm II., Oct. 28, 1908, and Its Consequences.

An interview between the German Emperor and "a representative Englishman, who long since passed
from public to private life," appeared in The London Telegraph on Oct. 28, 1908, and was the
next day authenticated by the German Foreign Office in Berlin with the comment that it was
"intended as a message to the English people." This last expression of the Kaiser toward Great
Britain--until his declarations on the eve of the present war--deeply stirred the German people
in protest and resulted in the Kaiser's pledge to Chancellor von Buelow that henceforth the
imperial views would be subject to the bridle of the Ministry and the Council of the Empire.

Resents a Personal Insult. How can I convince a nation against its will?"

     The Englishman reminded the Kaiser that not only England but the
     whole of Europe viewed with disapproval the recent sending of the
     German Consul at Algiers to Fez and forestalling France and Spain
     by suggesting the recognition of Sultan Mulai Hafid. The Kaiser
     made an impatient gesture and exclaimed: "Yes? that is an excellent
     example of the way German actions are misrepresented," and with
     vivid directness he defended the aforesaid incident, as the German
     Government has already done.

Kaiser and the Boer War.

Reverting to his efforts to show his friendship for England, the Kaiser said they had not been
confined to words. It was commonly believed that Germany was hostile to England throughout
the Boer war. Undoubtedly the newspapers were hostile and public opinion was hostile. "But
what," he asked, "of official Germany?

     "Nor was that all. I did more.

     "Let me add as a curious coincidence that the plan which I
     formulated ran very much on the same lines as that actually adopted
     by Gen. Roberts and carried by him into successful operation. Was
     that the act of one who wished England ill? Let Englishmen be just
     and say."

The German Navy.

Touching then upon the English conviction that Germany is increasing her navy for the purpose
of attacking Great Britain, the Kaiser reiterated the explanation that Chancellor von Bülow
and other Ministers have made familiar, dwelling upon Germany's worldwide commerce, her manifold
interests in distant seas, and the necessity for being prepared to protect them. He said:

     "Patriotic Germans refuse to assign any bounds to their legitimate
     commercial ambitions.

The Consequences.

On Nov. 17 following Prince von Bülow met the Kaiser at Kiel, taking with him evidence of the
feeling in Germany regarding the Emperor's published interview and setting forth:

     First, that the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundesrat, or
     Federal Council, is firm in the opinion formulated at the meeting
     held yesterday that it would be wiser for the Emperor not to
     express views affecting the relations of the empire with other
     countries except through his responsible Ministers. This
     expression, derives weight from the fact that the Governments of
     Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony were represented on the committee.

     Second, that the entire Reichstag assented to the declarations made
     by the speakers on Tuesday that the Emperor had exceeded his
     constitutional prerogatives in private discussion with foreigners
     concerning Germany's attitude on controverted questions.

     Third, that the feeling of the people at large on this matter was
     accurately indicated by the press of the country.

The Kaiser's reply was published on the same date in the Reichsanzeiger, in the form of a communication,
which read:

     During today's audience granted to the Imperial Chancellor, his
     Majesty, the Emperor and King, listened for several hours to a
     report by Prince von Bülow. The Imperial Chancellor described the
     feeling and its causes among the German people in connection with
     the article published in The Daily Telegraph. He also explained the
     position he had taken during the course of the debates and
     interpellations on this subject in the Reichstag. His Majesty the
     Emperor received the statements and explanations with great
     earnestness, and then expressed his will as follows:
