In these scenes the attempt has been made to preserve the spirit and unity of the plays, to
shorten them to practical length, and to adapt them to the demands of the public audience.

To avoid reprinting material which is already universally accessible, we have inserted no scenes
from Shakespeare; but the reader is referred to Fulton and Trueblood's "Choice Readings" (published
by Ginn and Company), which contains copious Indexes to choice scenes from Shakespeare, the
Bible, and hymn-books. The two volumes include a wide field of literature best suited for public
speaking.

The selections throughout the book are arranged under six different classes and cover a wide
range of thought and emotion. While many shades of feeling may be found in the same selection,
it has been our aim to place each one under the division with which, as a whole, it is most
closely allied.

We are grateful to the many authors and publishers who have courteously permitted us to use
their publications. Instead of naming them in the preface we have chosen to make due acknowledgment
in a footnote wherever their selections appear in the volume.

NARRATIVE, DESCRIPTIVE, PATHETIC

THE ARENA SCENE FROM "QUO VADIS"[1]

HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ

The Roman Empire in the first century presents the most revolting picture of mankind to be
found in the pages of history. Society founded on superior force, on the most barbarous cruelty,
on crime and mad profligacy, was corrupt beyond the power of words to describe. Rome ruled
the world, but was also its ulcer, and the horrible monster, Nero, guilty of all hideous and
revolting crimes, seems a fit monarch for such a people.

A few years ago appeared "Quo Vadis?" the story from which this selection is made. The book
attained so great a popularity, that it was translated into almost every tongue. In spite of
its many faults, it invited the attention, and, although it shocked the sensibilities, when
its great purpose was understood it melted the heart.

The author drew a startlingly vivid and horrible picture of humanity at this lowest stage,
and in conflict with it he showed us the Christ spirit.

The extract is the story of how the young Vinicius, a patrician, a soldier, a courtier of Nero,
through the labyrinth of foul sin, of self-worship and self-indulgence, with love for his guide,
found his way home to the feet of Him who commanded, "Be ye pure even as I am pure."

It is the love story of Vinicius and the Princess Lygia, a convert to Christ. The girl's happy
and innocent life was rudely disturbed by a summons to the court of the profligate emperor.
Arrived there, she found that Nero had given her to Vinicius, who had fallen passionately in
love with her; but on the way to Vinicius' house she was rescued by the giant Ursus, one of
her devoted attendants and a member of her own faith. They escaped in safety to the Christians,
who were living in hiding in the city.

The imperious nature of the youthful soldier for the first time in his life met resistance.
He was so transported with rage and disappointment that he ordered the slaves from whom Lygia
had escaped to be flogged to death, while he set out to find the girl who had dared to thwart
his desire. His egotism was so great that he would have seen the city and the whole world sunk
in ruins rather than fail of his purpose. For days and days his search was unceasing, and at
last he found Lygia, but in making a second attempt to carry her off was severely wounded by
the giant Ursus. Finding himself helpless in the Christians' hands, he expected nothing but
death; but instead he was carefully and tenderly nursed back to health. Waking from his delirium,
he found at his bedside Lygia--Lygia, whom he had most injured, watching alone, while the others
had gone to rest. As the days went by, Vinicius was thrilled to the very depths of his soul
by the consciousness that Lygia was learning to love him. With that revelation came the certain
conviction that his religion would forever make an inseparable barrier between them. Then he
hated Christianity with all the powers of his soul, yet he could not but acknowledge that it
had adorned Lygia with that exceptional, unexplained beauty, which was producing in his heart
besides love, respect; besides desire, homage. Yet, when he thought of accepting the religion
of the Nazarene, all the Roman in him rose up in revolt against the idea. He knew that if he
were to accept that teaching he would have to throw, as on a burning pile, all his thoughts,
ideas, ambitions, habits of life, his very nature up to that moment, burn them into ashes and
fill himself with an entirely new life, and from his soul he cried that it was impossible;
it was impossible!

Before Vinicius had entirely recovered Nero commanded his presence at Antium, whither the court
was going for the hot summer months. Nero was ambitious to write an immortal epic poem which
should rival the "Odyssey," and in order that he might describe realistically a burning city,
gave a secret command while he was in Antium that Rome should be set on fire.

One evening, when the court was assembled to hear Nero recite some of his poetry, a slave appeared.

"Pardon, Divine Imperator, Rome is burning! The whole city is a sea of flames!" A moment of
horrified silence followed, broken by the cry of Vinicius. He rushed forth, and, springing
on his horse, dashed into the deep night.

"Not to you, whose temples are burning, do I call, but to Thee. Thou Thyself hast suffered.
Thou alone hast understood people's pain. If Thou art what Peter and Paul declare, save Lygia.
Seek her in the burning; save her and I will give Thee my blood!"

Vinicius' horse, choking with the smoke, became unmanageable. He sprang to the earth and rushed
forward on foot. The tunic began to smolder on him in places; breath failed his lungs; strength
failed his bones; he fell! Two men, with gourds full of water, ran to him and bore him away.
When he regained consciousness he found himself in a spacious cave, lighted with torches and
tapers. He saw a throng of people kneeling, and over him bent the tender, beautiful face of
his soul's beloved.

Lygia was indeed safe from the burning, but before the first thrill of relief was over an infinitely
more horrible danger threatened her. The people were in wrath and threatened violence to Nero
and his court, for it was popularly believed that the city had been set on fire at the emperor's
instigation. The coward, Nero, was startled and thoroughly alarmed, and welcomed gladly the
suggestion that the calamity should be blamed on the Christians, who were viewed with great
suspicion by the common people, and obliged even then to live in hiding. In order to clear
himself and to divert the people's minds, he instituted at once against the Christians the
most horrible persecutions that have ever stained man's history. For days and days the people
came in countless numbers to witness the tortures of the innocent victims; but at last they
grew weary of blood-spilling. Then it was given out that Nero had arranged a climax for the
last of the Christians who were to die at an evening spectacle in a brilliantly lighted amphitheater.
Chief interest both of the Augustinians and the people centered in Lygia and Vinicius, for
the story of their love was now generally known, and everybody felt that Nero was intending
to make a tragedy for himself out of the suffering of Vinicius.

At last the evening arrived. The sight was in truth magnificent. All that was powerful, brilliant
and wealthy in Rome was there. The lower seats were crowded with togas as white as snow. In
a gilded padium sat Nero, wearing a diamond collar and a golden crown upon his head. To his
tortured mind came the thought that faith of itself would spare Lygia. Peter had said that
faith would move the earth to its foundations. He crushed doubt in himself, compressed his
whole being into the sentence, "I believe," and he looked for a miracle.

The prefect of the city waved a red handkerchief, and out of the dark gully into the brilliantly
lighted arena came Ursus. This act displeased the crowd.

Vinicius sprang to his feet.

"Lygia! Oh, ... I believe! I believe! Oh, Christ, a miracle! a miracle!" And he did not even
know that Petronius had covered his head at that moment with a toga. He did not look; he did
not see. And then came deep silence.

The giant removed in a twinkling the ropes that bound the maiden to the horns of the bull.
He raised the unconscious maiden in his arms, and, going to Nero's padium, held her up and
looked up imploringly.

At this the enthusiasm passed everything ever seen in a circus before. Voices choking with
tears began to demand mercy. Yet Nero halted and hesitated. He would have preferred to see
the giant and the maiden rent by the horns of the bull.

Nero was alarmed. He looked once more, and, seeing everywhere frowning brows, excited faces
and eyes fixed on him, he slowly raised his hand and gave the sign for mercy.

Then a thunder of applause broke from the highest seats to the lowest. But Vinicius heard it
not. He dropped on his knees in the arena, stretched his hands toward heaven and cried: "I
believe! Oh, Christ! I believe! I believe!"

THE ARROW AND THE SONG[2]

H. W. LONGFELLOW

     I shot an arrow into the air.
       It fell to earth, I knew not where;
     For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
       Could not follow in its flight.

     I breathed a song into the air.
       It fell to earth, I knew not where;
     For who has sight so keen and strong
       That it can follow the flight of song.

AUX ITALIENS

R. BULWER LYTTON

     At Paris it was, at the opera there;
     And she looked like a queen that night,
     With a wreath of pearl in her raven hair,
     And the brooch in her breast so bright.

     The Emperor there in his box of state,
     Looked grave; as if he had just then seen
     The red flag wave from the city gate,
     Where the eagles in bronze had been.

     The Empress, too, had a tear in her eye;
     You'd have thought that her fancy had gone back again,
     For one moment, under the old blue sky,
     To that old glad life in Spain.

     Well! there in our front row box we sat
     Together, my bride betrothed and I;
     My gaze was fixed on my opera hat,
     And hers on the stage hard by.

     And both were silent and both were sad;
     Like a queen she leaned on her full white arm,
     With that regal indolent air she had;
     So confident of her charm!
