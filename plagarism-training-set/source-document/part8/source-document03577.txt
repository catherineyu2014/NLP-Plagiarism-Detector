O Slawkenbergius! thou faithful analyzer of my Disgrazias--thou sad foreteller of so many of
the whips and short turns which on one stage or other of my life have come slap upon me from
the shortness of my nose, and no other cause, that I am conscious of.--Tell me, Slawkenbergius!
what secret impulse was it? what intonation of voice? whence came it? how did it sound in thy
ears?--art thou sure thou heard'st it?--which first cried out to thee--go--go, Slawkenbergius!
dedicate the labours of thy life--neglect thy pastimes--call forth all the powers and faculties
of thy nature--macerate thyself in the service of mankind, and write a grand Folio for them,
upon the subject of their noses.

How the communication was conveyed into Slawkenbergius's sensorium--so that Slawkenbergius
should know whose finger touch'd the key--and whose hand it was that blew the bellows--as Hafen
Slawkenbergius has been dead and laid in his grave above fourscore and ten years--we can only
raise conjectures.

Slawkenbergius was play'd upon, for aught I know, like one of Whitefield's disciples--that
is, with such a distinct intelligence, Sir, of which of the two masters it was that had been
practising upon his instrument--as to make all reasoning upon it needless.

--For in the account which Hafen Slawkenbergius gives the world of his motives and occasions
for writing, and spending so many years of his life upon this one work--towards the end of
his prolegomena, which by-the-bye should have come first--but the bookbinder has most injudiciously
placed it betwixt the analytical contents of the book, and the book itself--he informs his
reader, that ever since he had arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit down
cooly, and consider within himself the true state and condition of man, and distinguish the
main end and design of his being;--or--to shorten my translation, for Slawkenbergius's book
is in Latin, and not a little prolix in this passage--ever since I understood, quoth Slawkenbergius,
any thing--or rather what was what--and could perceive that the point of long noses had been
too loosely handled by all who had gone before;--have I Slawkenbergius, felt a strong impulse,
with a mighty and unresistible call within me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.

And to do justice to Slawkenbergius, he has entered the list with a stronger lance, and taken
a much larger career in it than any one man who had ever entered it before him--and indeed,
in many respects, deserves to be en-nich'd as a prototype for all writers, of voluminous works
at least, to model their books by--for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject--examined every
part of it dialectically--then brought it into full day; dilucidating it with all the light
which either the collision of his own natural parts could strike--or the profoundest knowledge
of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon it--collating, collecting, and compiling--begging,
borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote or wrangled thereupon in
the schools and porticos of the learned: so that Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered,
not only as a model--but as a thorough-stitched Digest and regular institute of noses, comprehending
in it all that is or can be needful to be known about them.

For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many (otherwise) valuable books and treatises
of my father's collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses--or collaterally touching them;--such
for instance as Prignitz, now lying upon the table before me, who with infinite learning, and
from the most candid and scholar-like examination of above four thousand different skulls,
in upwards of twenty charnel-houses in Silesia, which he had rummaged--has informed us, that
the mensuration and configuration of the osseous or bony parts of human noses, in any given
tract of country, except Crim Tartary, where they are all crush'd down by the thumb, so that
no judgment can be formed upon them--are much nearer alike, than the world imagines;--the difference
amongst them being, he says, a mere trifle, not worth taking notice of;--but that the size
and jollity of every individual nose, and by which one nose ranks above another, and bears
a higher price, is owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts and
sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell'd and driven by the warmth and force of the
imagination, which is but a step from it (bating the case of idiots, whom Prignitz, who had
lived many years in Turky, supposes under the more immediate tutelage of Heaven)--it so happens,
and ever must, says Prignitz, that the excellency of the nose is in a direct arithmetical proportion
to the excellency of the wearer's fancy.

It is for the same reason, that is, because 'tis all comprehended in Slawkenbergius, that I
say nothing likewise of Scroderus (Andrea) who, all the world knows, set himself to oppugn
Prignitz with great violence--proving it in his own way, first logically, and then by a series
of stubborn facts, 'That so far was Prignitz from the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat
the nose, that on the contrary--the nose begat the fancy.'

--The learned suspected Scroderus of an indecent sophism in this--and Prignitz cried out aloud
in the dispute, that Scroderus had shifted the idea upon him--but Scroderus went on, maintaining
his thesis.

My father was just balancing within himself, which of the two sides he should take in this
affair; when Ambrose Paraeus decided it in a moment, and by overthrowing the systems, both
of Prignitz and Scroderus, drove my father out of both sides of the controversy at once.

Be witness--

I don't acquaint the learned reader--in saying it, I mention it only to shew the learned, I
know the fact myself--

That this Ambrose Paraeus was chief surgeon and nose-mender to Francis the ninth of France,
and in high credit with him and the two preceding, or succeeding kings (I know not which)--and
that, except in the slip he made in his story of Taliacotius's noses, and his manner of setting
them on--he was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time, as more knowing in
matters of noses, than any one who had ever taken them in hand.

Now Ambrose Paraeus convinced my father, that the true and efficient cause of what had engaged
so much the attention of the world, and upon which Prignitz and Scroderus had wasted so much
learning and fine parts--was neither this nor that--but that the length and goodness of the
nose was owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurse's breast--as the flatness
and shortness of puisne noses was to the firmness and elastic repulsion of the same organ of
nutrition in the hale and lively--which, tho' happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child,
inasmuch as his nose was so snubb'd, so rebuff'd, so rebated, and so refrigerated thereby,
as never to arrive ad mensuram suam legitimam;--but that in case of the flaccidity and softness
of the nurse or mother's breast--by sinking into it, quoth Paraeus, as into so much butter,
the nose was comforted, nourish'd, plump'd up, refresh'd, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.

I have but two things to observe of Paraeus; first, That he proves and explains all this with
the utmost chastity and decorum of expression:--for which may his soul for ever rest in peace!

And, secondly, that besides the systems of Prignitz and Scroderus, which Ambrose Paraeus his
hypothesis effectually overthrew--it overthrew at the same time the system of peace and harmony
of our family; and for three days together, not only embroiled matters between my father and
my mother, but turn'd likewise the whole house and every thing in it, except my uncle Toby,
quite upside down.

Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife, never surely in any age or
country got vent through the key-hole of a street-door.

My mother, you must know--but I have fifty things more necessary to let you know first--I have
a hundred difficulties which I have promised to clear up, and a thousand distresses and domestick
misadventures crowding in upon me thick and threefold, one upon the neck of another. A cow
broke in (tomorrow morning) to my uncle Toby's fortifications, and eat up two rations and a
half of dried grass, tearing up the sods with it, which faced his horn-work and covered way.--Trim
insists upon being tried by a court-martial--the cow to be shot--Slop to be crucifix'd--myself
to be tristram'd and at my very baptism made a martyr of;--poor unhappy devils that we all
are!--I want swaddling--but there is no time to be lost in exclamations--I have left my father
lying across his bed, and my uncle Toby in his old fringed chair, sitting beside him, and promised
I would go back to them in half an hour; and five-and-thirty minutes are laps'd already.--Of
all the perplexities a mortal author was ever seen in--this certainly is the greatest, for
I have Hafen Slawkenbergius's folio, Sir, to finish--a dialogue between my father and my uncle
Toby, upon the solution of Prignitz, Scroderus, Ambrose Paraeus, Panocrates, and Grangousier
to relate--a tale out of Slawkenbergius to translate, and all this in five minutes less than
no time at all;--such a head!--would to Heaven my enemies only saw the inside of it!

Chapter 2.XXXII.

There was not any one scene more entertaining in our family--and to do it justice in this point;--and
I here put off my cap and lay it upon the table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make
my declaration to the world concerning this one article the more solemn--that I believe in
my soul (unless my love and partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the supreme
Maker and first Designer of all things never made or put a family together (in that period
at least of it which I have sat down to write the story of)--where the characters of it were
cast or contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was, for this end; or in which the
capacities of affording such exquisite scenes, and the powers of shifting them perpetually
from morning to night, were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the
Shandy Family.

Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this whimsical theatre of ours--than what
frequently arose out of this self-same chapter of long noses--especially when my father's imagination
was heated with the enquiry, and nothing would serve him but to heat my uncle Toby's too.

My uncle Toby would give my father all possible fair play in this attempt; and with infinite
patience would sit smoking his pipe for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising
upon his head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive Prignitz and Scroderus's solutions
into it.

Whether they were above my uncle Toby's reason--or contrary to it--or that his brain was like
damp timber, and no spark could possibly take hold--or that it was so full of saps, mines,
blinds, curtins, and such military disqualifications to his seeing clearly into Prignitz and
Scroderus's doctrines--I say not--let schoolmen--scullions, anatomists, and engineers, fight
for it among themselves--

'Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair, that my father had every word of it
to translate for the benefit of my uncle Toby, and render out of Slawkenbergius's Latin, of
which, as he was no great master, his translation was not always of the purest--and generally
least so where 'twas most wanted.--This naturally open'd a door to a second misfortune;--that
in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open my uncle Toby's eyes--my father's ideas ran on
as much faster than the translation, as the translation outmoved my uncle Toby's--neither the
one or the other added much to the perspicuity of my father's lecture.

Chapter 2.XXXIII.

The gift of ratiocination and making syllogisms--I mean in man--for in superior classes of
being, such as angels and spirits--'tis all done, may it please your worships, as they tell
me, by Intuition;--and beings inferior, as your worships all know--syllogize by their noses:
though there is an island swimming in the sea (though not altogether at its ease) whose inhabitants,
if my intelligence deceives me not, are so wonderfully gifted, as to syllogize after the same
fashion, and oft-times to make very well out too:--but that's neither here nor there--

The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, or--the great and principal act of ratiocination
in man, as logicians tell us, is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas
one with another, by the intervention of a third (called the medius terminus); just as a man,
as Locke well observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the same length,
which could not be brought together, to measure their equality, by juxta-position.

Had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated his systems of noses, and observed
my uncle Toby's deportment--what great attention he gave to every word--and as oft as he took
his pipe from his mouth, with what wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of it--surveying
it transversely as he held it betwixt his finger and his thumb--then fore-right--then this
way, and then that, in all its possible directions and fore-shortenings--he would have concluded
my uncle Toby had got hold of the medius terminus, and was syllogizing and measuring with it
the truth of each hypothesis of long noses, in order, as my father laid them before him. This,
by-the-bye, was more than my father wanted--his aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophick
lectures--was to enable my uncle Toby not to discuss--but comprehend--to hold the grains and
scruples of learning--not to weigh them.--My uncle Toby, as you will read in the next chapter,
did neither the one or the other.

Chapter 2.XXXIV.

'Tis a pity, cried my father one winter's night, after a three hours painful translation of
Slawkenbergius--'tis a pity, cried my father, putting my mother's threadpaper into the book
for a mark, as he spoke--that truth, brother Toby, should shut herself up in such impregnable
fastnesses, and be so obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest siege.--

Now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that my uncle Toby's fancy, during
the time of my father's explanation of Prignitz to him--having nothing to stay it there, had
taken a short flight to the bowling-green;--his body might as well have taken a turn there
too--so that with all the semblance of a deep school-man intent upon the medius terminus--my
uncle Toby was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture, and all its pros and cons, as if my
father had been translating Hafen Slawkenbergius from the Latin tongue into the Cherokee. But
the word siege, like a talismanic power, in my father's metaphor, wafting back my uncle Toby's
fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch--he open'd his ears--and my father observing
that he took his pipe out of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with a
desire to profit--my father with great pleasure began his sentence again--changing only the
plan, and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep clear of some dangers my father
apprehended from it.

'Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one side, brother Toby--considering
what ingenuity these learned men have all shewn in their solutions of noses.--Can noses be
dissolved? replied my uncle Toby.

--My father thrust back his chair--rose up--put on his hat--took four long strides to the door--jerked
it open--thrust his head half way out--shut the door again--took no notice of the bad hinge--returned
to the table--pluck'd my mother's thread-paper out of Slawkenbergius's book--went hastily to
his bureau--walked slowly back--twisted my mother's thread-paper about his thumb--unbutton'd
his waistcoat--threw my mother's thread-paper into the fire--bit her sattin pin-cushion in
two, fill'd his mouth with bran--confounded it;--but mark!--the oath of confusion was levell'd
at my uncle Toby's brain--which was e'en confused enough already--the curse came charged only
with the bran--the bran, may it please your honours, was no more than powder to the ball.

'Twas well my father's passions lasted not long; for so long as they did last, they led him
a busy life on't; and it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with in
my observations of human nature, that nothing should prove my father's mettle so much, or make
his passions go off so like gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science met with from
the quaint simplicity of my uncle Toby's questions.--Had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind
in so many different places all at one time--he could not have exerted more mechanical functions
in fewer seconds--or started half so much, as with one single quaere of three words unseasonably
popping in full upon him in his hobby-horsical career.

'Twas all one to my uncle Toby--he smoked his pipe on with unvaried composure--his heart never
intended offence to his brother--and as his head could seldom find out where the sting of it
lay--he always gave my father the credit of cooling by himself.--He was five minutes and thirty-five
seconds about it in the present case.

By all that's good! said my father, swearing, as he came to himself, and taking the oath out
of Ernulphus's digest of curses--(though to do my father justice it was a fault (as he told
Dr. Slop in the affair of Ernulphus) which he as seldom committed as any man upon earth)--By
all that's good and great! brother Toby, said my father, if it was not for the aids of philosophy,
which befriend one so much as they do--you would put a man beside all temper.--Why, by the
solutions of noses, of which I was telling you, I meant, as you might have known, had you favoured
me with one grain of attention, the various accounts which learned men of different kinds of
knowledge have given the world of the causes of short and long noses.--There is no cause but
one, replied my uncle Toby--why one man's nose is longer than another's, but because that God
pleases to have it so.--That is Grangousier's solution, said my father.--'Tis he, continued
my uncle Toby, looking up, and not regarding my father's interruption, who makes us all, and
frames and puts us together in such forms and proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable
to his infinite wisdom,.--'Tis a pious account, cried my father, but not philosophical--there
is more religion in it than sound science. 'Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle Toby's character--that
he feared God, and reverenced religion.--So the moment my father finished his remark--my uncle
Toby fell a whistling Lillabullero with more zeal (though more out of tune) than usual.--

What is become of my wife's thread-paper?

Chapter 2.XXXV.

No matter--as an appendage to seamstressy, the thread-paper might be of some consequence to
my mother--of none to my father, as a mark in Slawkenbergius. Slawkenbergius in every page
of him was a rich treasure of inexhaustible knowledge to my father--he could not open him amiss;
and he would often say in closing the book, that if all the arts and sciences in the world,
with the books which treated of them, were lost--should the wisdom and policies of governments,
he would say, through disuse, ever happen to be forgot, and all that statesmen had wrote or
caused to be written, upon the strong or the weak sides of courts and kingdoms, should they
be forgot also--and Slawkenbergius only left--there would be enough in him in all conscience,
he would say, to set the world a-going again. A treasure therefore was he indeed! an institute
of all that was necessary to be known of noses, and every thing else--at matin, noon, and vespers
was Hafen Slawkenbergius his recreation and delight: 'twas for ever in his hands--you would
have sworn, Sir, it had been a canon's prayer-book--so worn, so glazed, so contrited and attrited
was it with fingers and with thumbs in all its parts, from one end even unto the other.

I am not such a bigot to Slawkenbergius as my father;--there is a fund in him, no doubt: but
in my opinion, the best, I don't say the most profitable, but the most amusing part of Hafen
Slawkenbergius, is his tales--and, considering he was a German, many of them told not without
fancy:--these take up his second book, containing nearly one half of his folio, and are comprehended
in ten decads, each decad containing ten tales--Philosophy is not built upon tales; and therefore
'twas certainly wrong in Slawkenbergius to send them into the world by that name!--there are
a few of them in his eighth, ninth, and tenth decads, which I own seem rather playful and sportive,
than speculative--but in general they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so
many independent facts, all of them turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges of
his subject, and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the doctrines of noses.

As we have leisure enough upon our hands--if you give me leave, madam, I'll tell you the ninth
tale of his tenth decad.

Slawkenbergii Fabella (As Hafen Slawkenbergius de Nasis is extremely scarce, it may not be
unacceptable to the learned reader to see the specimen of a few pages of his original; I will
make no reflection upon it, but that his story-telling Latin is much more concise than his
philosophic--and, I think, has more of Latinity in it.)

Vespera quadam frigidula, posteriori in parte mensis Augusti, peregrinus, mulo fusco colore
incidens, mantica a tergo, paucis indusiis, binis calceis, braccisque sericis coccineis repleta,
Argentoratum ingressus est.

Militi eum percontanti, quum portus intraret dixit, se apud Nasorum promontorium fuisse, Francofurtum
proficisci, et Argentoratum, transitu ad fines Sarmatiae mensis intervallo, reversurum.

Miles peregrini in faciem suspexit--Di boni, nova forma nasi!

At multum mihi profuit, inquit peregrinus, carpum amento extrahens, e quo pependit acinaces:
Loculo manum inseruit; et magna cum urbanitate, pilei parte anteriore tacta manu sinistra,
ut extendit dextram, militi florinum dedit et processit.

Dolet mihi, ait miles, tympanistam nanum et valgum alloquens, virum adeo urbanum vaginam perdidisse:
itinerari haud poterit nuda acinaci; neque vaginam toto Argentorato, habilem inveniet.--Nullam
unquam habui, respondit peregrinus respiciens--seque comiter inclinans--hoc more gesto, nudam
acinacem elevans, mulo lento progrediente, ut nasum tueri possim.

Non immerito, benigne peregrine, respondit miles.

Nihili aestimo, ait ille tympanista, e pergamena factitius est.

Prout christianus sum, inquit miles, nasus ille, ni sexties major fit, meo esset conformis.

Crepitare audivi ait tympanista.

Mehercule! sanguinem emisit, respondit miles.

Miseret me, inquit tympanista, qui non ambo tetigimus!

Eodem temporis puncto, quo haec res argumentata fuit inter militem et tympanistam, disceptabatur
ibidem tubicine et uxore sua qui tunc accesserunt, et peregrino praetereunte, restiterunt.

Quantus nasus! aeque longus est, ait tubicina, ac tuba.

Et ex eodem metallo, ait tubicen, velut sternutamento audias.
