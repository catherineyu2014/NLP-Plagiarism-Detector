[Footnote 15: Scott has "and we might contend with as good a grace," &c. Craik follows Scott.
The reading in the text is that of the "Miscellanies" (1711), Faulkner, and Hawkesworth. [T.S.]]

'Tis again objected, as a very absurd ridiculous custom, that a set of men should be suffered,
much less employed and hired, to bawl one day in seven against the lawfulness of those methods
most in use toward the pursuit of greatness, riches and pleasure, which are the constant practice
of all men alive on the other six. But this objection is, I think, a little unworthy so refined
an age as ours. Let us argue this matter calmly: I appeal to the breast of any polite freethinker,
whether in the pursuit of gratifying a predominant passion, he hath not always felt a wonderful
incitement, by reflecting it was a thing forbidden; and therefore we see, in order to cultivate
this taste, the wisdom of the nation hath taken special care, that the ladies should be furnished
with prohibited silks, and the men with prohibited wine. And indeed it were to be wished, that
some other prohibitions were promoted, in order to improve the pleasures of the town; which,
for want of such expedients begin already, as I am told, to flag and grow languid, giving way
daily to cruel inroads from the spleen.

'Tis likewise proposed as a great advantage to the public, that if we once discard the system
of the Gospel, all religion will of course be banished for ever; and consequently, along with
it, those grievous prejudices of education, which under the names of virtue, conscience, honour,
justice, and the like, are so apt to disturb the peace of human minds, and the notions whereof
are so hard to be eradicated by right reason or freethinking, sometimes during the whole course
of our lives.

Here first, I observe how difficult it is to get rid of a phrase, which the world is once grown
fond of, though the occasion that first produced it, be entirely taken away. For several years
past, if a man had but an ill-favoured nose, the deep-thinkers of the age would some way or
other contrive to impute the cause to the prejudice of his education. From this fountain were
said to be derived all our foolish notions of justice, piety, love of our country, all our
opinions of God, or a future state, Heaven, Hell, and the like: And there might formerly perhaps
have been some pretence for this charge. But so effectual care has been taken to remove those
prejudices, by an entire change in the methods of education, that (with honour I mention it
to our polite innovators) the young gentlemen who are now on the scene, seem to have not the
least tincture of those infusions, or string of those weeds; and, by consequence, the reason
for abolishing nominal Christianity upon that pretext, is wholly ceased.

For the rest, it may perhaps admit a controversy, whether the banishing of all notions of religion
whatsoever, would be convenient for the vulgar. Not that I am in the least of opinion with
those who hold religion to have been the invention of politicians, to keep the lower part of
the world in awe by the fear of invisible powers; unless mankind were then very different to
what it is now: For I look upon the mass or body of our people here in England, to be as freethinkers,
that is to say, as staunch unbelievers, as any of the highest rank. But I conceive some scattered
notions about a superior power to be of singular use for the common people, as furnishing excellent
materials to keep children quiet when they grow peevish, and providing topics of amusement
in a tedious winter-night.

Lastly, 'tis proposed as a singular advantage, that the abolishing of Christianity will very
much contribute to the uniting of Protestants, by enlarging the terms of communion so as to
take in all sorts of dissenters, who are now shut out of the pale upon account of a few ceremonies
which all sides confess to be things indifferent: That this alone will effectually answer the
great ends of a scheme for comprehension, by opening a large noble gate, at which all bodies
may enter; whereas the chaffering with dissenters, and dodging about this or t'other ceremony,
is but like opening a few wickets, and leaving them at jar, by which no more than one can get
in at a time, and that, not without stooping, and sideling, and squeezing his body.[16]

[Footnote 16: "In this passage," says Scott, "the author's High Church principles, and jealousy
of the Dissenters, plainly shew themselves; and it is, perhaps, in special reference to what
is here said, that he ranks it among the pamphlets he wrote in opposition to the party then
in power." [T. S.]]

To all this I answer: that there is one darling inclination of mankind, which usually affects
to be a retainer to religion, though she be neither its parent, its godmother, or its friend;
I mean the spirit of opposition, that lived long before Christianity, and can easily subsist
without it. Let us, for instance, examine wherein the opposition of sectaries among us consists,
we shall find Christianity to have no share in it at all Does the Gospel any where prescribe
a starched, squeezed countenance, a stiff, formal gait, a singularity of manners and habit,
or any affected modes of speech different from the reasonable part of mankind? Yet, if Christianity
did not lend its name to stand in the gap, and to employ or divert these humours, they must
of necessity be spent in contraventions to the laws of the land, and disturbance of the public
peace. There is a portion of enthusiasm assigned to every nation, which, if it hath not proper
objects to work on, will burst out, and set all into a flame. If the quiet of a state can be
bought by only flinging men a few ceremonies to devour, it is a purchase no wise man would
refuse Let the mastiffs amuse themselves about a sheep's skin stuffed with hay, provided it
will keep them from worrying the flock The institution of convents abroad, seems in one point
a strain of great wisdom, there being few irregularities in human passions, which may not have
recourse to vent themselves in some of those orders, which are so many retreats for the speculative,
the melancholy, the proud, the silent, the politic and the morose, to spend themselves, and
evaporate the noxious particles, for each of whom we in this island are forced to provide a
several sect of religion, to keep them quiet And whenever Christianity shall be abolished,
the legislature must find some other expedient to employ and entertain them For what imports
it how large a gate you open, if there will be always left a number who place a pride and a
merit in not coming in?[17]

[Footnote 17: So the "Miscellanies" (1711) and Hawkesworth Faulkner, Scott, and Craik print,
"in refusing to enter." [T. S.]]

Having thus considered the most important objections against Christianity, and the chief advantages
proposed by the abolishing thereof, I shall now with equal deference and submission to wiser
judgments as before, proceed to mention a few inconveniences that may happen, if the Gospel
should be repealed, which perhaps the projectors may not have sufficiently considered.

[Footnote 18: Shocked Swift's habit when using a word of French origin was to keep the French
spelling. [T. S.]]

And to urge another argument of a parallel nature.

Nor do I think it wholly groundless, or my fears altogether imaginary, that the abolishing
of Christianity may perhaps bring the Church into danger, or at least put the senate to the
trouble of another securing vote. I desire I may not be mistaken; I am far from presuming to
affirm or think that the Church is in danger at present, or as things now stand; but we know
not how soon it may be so when the Christian religion is repealed. As plausible as this project
seems, there may a dangerous design lurk under it:[19] Nothing can be more notorious, than
that the Atheists, Deists, Socinians, Anti-trinitarians, and other subdivisions of freethinkers,
are persons of little zeal for the present ecclesiastical establishment: Their declared opinion
is for repealing the Sacramental Test; they are very indifferent with regard to ceremonies;
nor do they hold the jus divinum of Episcopacy. Therefore this may be intended as one politic
step toward altering the constitution of the Church established, and setting up Presbytery
in the stead, which I leave to be further considered by those at the helm.

[Footnote 19: Craik follows Scott in altering this sentence to "there may be a dangerous design
lurking under it"; but all other editors, except Morley and Roscoe, give it as printed in the
text. [T.S.]]

In the last place, I think nothing can be more plain, than that by this expedient, we shall
run into the evil we chiefly pretend to avoid; and that the abolishment of the Christian religion
will be the readiest course we can take to introduce popery. And I am the more inclined to
this opinion, because we know it has been the constant practice of the Jesuits to send over
emissaries, with instructions to personate themselves members of the several prevailing sects
among us. So it is recorded, that they have at sundry times appeared in the guise of Presbyterians,
Anabaptists, Independents and Quakers, according as any of these were most in credit; so, since
the fashion hath been taken up of exploding religion, the popish missionaries have not been
wanting to mix with the freethinkers; among whom, Toland the great oracle of the Antichristians
is an Irish priest, the son of an Irish priest; and the most learned and ingenious author of
a book called "The Rights of the Christian Church,"[20] was in a proper juncture reconciled
to the Romish faith, whose true son, as appears by a hundred passages in his treatise, he still
continues. Perhaps I could add some others to the number; but the fact is beyond dispute, and
the reasoning they proceed by is right: For, supposing Christianity to be extinguished, the
people will never be at ease till they find out some other method of worship; which will as
infallibly produce superstition, as this will end in popery.

[Footnote 20: Dr. Matthew Tindal (see previous note, p. 9). The book was afterwards specially
criticised by Swift in his "Remarks upon a Book entitled 'The Rights of the Christian Church.'"
See also note to the present reprint of these "Remarks." [T.S.]]

And therefore, if notwithstanding all I have said, it still be thought necessary to have a
bill brought in for repealing Christianity, I would humbly offer an amendment; that instead
of the word, Christianity, may be put religion in general; which I conceive will much better
answer all the good ends proposed by the projectors of it. For, as long as we leave in being
a God and his providence, with all the necessary consequences which curious and inquisitive
men will be apt to draw from such premises, we do not strike at the root of the evil, though
we should ever so effectually annihilate the present scheme of the Gospel: For, of what use
is freedom of thought, if it will not produce freedom of action, which is the sole end, how
remote soever in appearance, of all objections against Christianity? And therefore, the freethinkers
consider it as a sort of edifice, wherein all the parts have such a mutual dependence on each
other, that if you happen to pull out one single nail, the whole fabric must fall to the ground.
This was happily expressed by him who had heard of a text brought for proof of the Trinity,
which in an ancient manuscript was differently read; he thereupon immediately took the hint,
and by a sudden deduction of a long sorites, most logically concluded; "Why, if it be as you
say, I may safely whore and drink on, and defy the parson." From which, and many the like instances
easy to be produced, I think nothing can be more manifest, than that the quarrel is not against
any particular points of hard digestion in the Christian system, but against religion in general;
which, by laying restraints on human nature, is supposed the great enemy to the freedom of
thought and action.

Upon the whole, if it shall still be thought for the benefit of Church and State, that Christianity
be abolished; I conceive however, it may be more convenient to defer the execution to a time
of peace, and not venture in this conjuncture to disoblige our allies, who, as it falls out,
are all Christians, and many of them, by the prejudices of their education, so bigoted, as
to place a sort of pride in the appellation. If upon being rejected by them, we are to trust
an alliance with the Turk, we shall find ourselves much deceived: For, as he is too remote,
and generally engaged in war with the Persian emperor, so his people would be more scandalized
at our infidelity, than our Christian neighbours. For they [the Turks] are not only strict
observers of religious worship, but what is worse, believe a God; which is more than required
of us even while we preserve the name of Christians.

NOTE.

In placing this tract second in chronological order I am following Forster and Craik. All the
collected editions of Swift's works, including the "Miscellanies" of 1711, begin with "The
Sentiments of a Church of England Man," continue with the "Argument," and then the "Project."
But the short intervals which separated the publication of all three tracts and the "Letter
on the Sacramental Test," make a strict chronological order of less value than the order of
development of the subject-matter with which they deal, granting even that the "Project" appeared
after "The Sentiments." There seems, however, nothing improbable in the suggestion made by
Forster, that Swift planned the writing of both the "Argument" and the "Project" while on a
visit to the Earl of Berkeley, at Cranford, in 1708; and his dedication of the latter to Lady
Berkeley lends this suggestion added weight. That the original edition of the "Project" is
dated 1709 is nothing to the point, since it is well-known that the booksellers often antedated
their publications, as publishers do now, when the issue occurred towards the end of a year.
Moreover, the letter of the Earl of Berkeley to Swift, which Scott misdates 1706-1707, but
which should be 1708, makes special reference to this very tract, showing that it was certainly
published in 1708. "I earnestly entreat you," writes the earl, "if you have not done it already,
that you would not fail of having your bookseller enable the Archbishop of York [Dr. Sterne]
to give a book to the queen; for, with Mr. Nelson, I am entirely of opinion, that Her Majesty's
reading of that book on the Progress for the Increase of Morality and Piety, may be of very
great use to that end." I have never seen a copy of the first edition of "The Sentiments,"
and I cannot fix the exact date of its publication; but it was certainly not written before
the "Project." The "Project," therefore, must be considered in the light of a preliminary essay
to the fuller and more digested statement of "The Sentiments of a Church of England man"; and
I have, on this account, placed it as the second tract written by Swift in the year 1708.

Whatever may be thought of the particular methods which Swift suggested for realizing his reformatory
scheme, and they were, no doubt, artificial and wooden enough; the tract itself remains an
excellent survey of the evils and gross habits of the time. The methods may be Utopian (Swift
himself thought they were open to discussion), but the spirit of sincerity and piety is unmistakable.
It is worth remembering, however, that several of the proposals, such as those for closing
the public-houses at twelve o'clock at night; the penalizing of publicans who supplied drink
to drunken customers; the building of churches, have since been adopted.

I cannot agree with Mr. Churton Collins ("Jonathan Swift," pp. 59-61) in suspecting Swift of
a special policy of self-interest in writing the "Project." Swift was too honest a man to use
the religious sentiment for the purpose of counteracting any bad impression his previous writings
had made on those who had the power to advance him. However much he might delight in the possession
of high worldly station, he would never so prostitute himself to obtain it. Nor did he care
to let the world into the secret of his heart. Indeed, all his life Swift seemed to hide, almost
jealously, the genuine piety of his nature. Whatever suspicion of policy has surrounded the
tract must be ascribed to the well-intentioned letter of the Earl of Berkeley above quoted;
and the Earl would not have written thus had he felt Swift's motive to be any other than a
purely impersonal one.

Steele, in his review of the "Project" in the fifth "Tatler" (April 20th, 1709), makes some
interesting observations, and seems to take special note of the "Person of Honour," in the
character of which Swift wrote it.

In his "Apology"

The present text is based upon the first edition; but this edition was so wretchedly printed
that I have carefully collated it with those given in the "Miscellanies" (1711), Faulkner (1735),
and Hawkesworth (1762).

Printed and Sold by H. Hills, in Black-fryars, near the Water-side. For the Benefit of the

TO THE COUNTESS OF BERKELEY.[1]

MADAM,

My intention in prefixing your Ladyship's name, is not after the common form, to desire your
protection of the following papers; which I take to be a very unreasonable request; since,
by being inscribed to your Ladyship, though without your knowledge, and from a concealed hand,
you cannot recommend them without some suspicion of partiality. My real design is, I confess,
the very same I have often detested in most dedications; that of publishing your praises to
the world. Not upon the subject of your noble birth, for I know others as noble; or of the
greatness of your fortune, for I know others far greater; or of that beautiful race (the images
of their parents) which call you mother: for even this may perhaps have been equalled in some
other age or country. Besides, none of these advantages do derive any accomplishments to the
owners, but serve at best only to adorn what they really possess. What I intend, is your piety,
truth, good sense, and good nature, affability, and charity; wherein I wish your Ladyship had
many equals, or any superiors; and I wish I could say I knew them too, for then your Ladyship
might have had a chance to escape this address. In the meantime, I think it highly necessary,
for the interest of virtue and religion, that the whole kingdom should be informed in some
parts of your character: For instance, that the easiest and politest conversation, joined with
the truest piety, may be observed in your Ladyship, in as great perfection, as they were ever
seen apart in any other persons. That by your prudence and management under several disadvantages,
you have preserved the lustre of that most noble family into which you are grafted, and which
the immeasurable profusion of ancestors for many generations had too much eclipsed. Then, how
happily you perform every office of life to which Providence has called you: In the education
of those two incomparable daughters, whose conduct is so universally admired; in every duty
of a prudent, complying, affectionate wife; in that care which descends to the meanest of your
domestics; and, lastly, in that endless bounty to the poor, and discretion where to distribute
it. I insist on my opinion, that it is of importance for the public to know this and a great
deal more of your Ladyship; yet whoever goes about to inform them, shall instead of finding
credit, perhaps be censured for a flatterer. To avoid so usual a reproach, I declare this to
be no dedication, but properly an introduction to a proposal for the advancement of religion
and morals, by tracing, however imperfectly, some few lineaments in the character of a Lady,
who hath spent all her life in the practice and promotion of both.

[Footnote 1: This is the same Countess of Berkeley whom Swift hoaxed with his "Meditation on
a Broomstick." She was the daughter of Viscount Campden and sister to the Earl of Gainsborough.
[T.S.]]

Among all the schemes offered to the public in this projecting age, I have observed with some
displeasure, that there have never been any for the improvement of religion and morals; which
beside the piety of the design from the consequence of such a reformation in a future life,
would be the best natural means for advancing the public felicity of the state, as well as
the present happiness of every individual. For, as much as faith and morality are declined
among us, I am altogether confident, they might in a short time, and with no very great trouble,
be raised to as high a perfection as numbers are capable of receiving. Indeed, the method is
so easy and obvious, and some present opportunities so good, that, in order to have this project
reduced to practice, there seems to want nothing more than to put those in mind, who by their
honour, duty, and interest, are chiefly concerned.

But because it is idle to propose remedies before we are assured of the disease, or to be in
pain,[2] till we are convinced of the danger; I shall first shew in general, that the nation
is extremely corrupted in religion and morals; and then I will offer a short scheme for the
reformation of both.

[Footnote 2: Scott follows Faulkner in using the word "fear." The reading in the text is that
of the first edition, the "Miscellanies" (1711), and of Hawkesworth. [T.S.]]

As to the first; I know it is reckoned but a form of speech, when divines complain of the wickedness
of the age: However, I believe, upon a fair comparison with other times and countries, it would
be found an undoubted truth.

For, first; to deliver nothing but plain matter of fact without exaggeration or satire; I suppose
it will be granted, that hardly one in a hundred among our people of quality or gentry, appears
to act by any principle of religion; that great numbers of them do entirely discard it, and
are ready to own their disbelief of all revelation in ordinary discourse. Nor is the case much
better among the vulgar, especially in great towns where the profaneness and ignorance of handicraftsmen,
small traders, servants, and the like, are to a degree very hard to be imagined greater. Then,
it is observed abroad, that no race of mortals hath so little sense of religion, as the English
soldiers; to confirm which, I have been often told by great officers in the army, that in the
whole compass of their acquaintance, they could not recollect three of their profession, who
seemed to regard or believe one syllable of the Gospel: And the same, at least, may be affirmed
of the fleet. The consequences of all which upon the actions of men are equally manifest. They
never go about, as in former time, to hide or palliate their vices, but expose them freely
to view, like any other common occurrences of life, without the least reproach from the world,
or themselves. For instance; any man will tell you he intends to be drunk this evening, or
was so last night, with as little ceremony or scruple, as he would tell you the time of the
day. He will let you know he is going to a whore, or that he has got a clap, with as much indifferency,
as he would a piece of public news. He will swear, curse, or blaspheme, without the least passion
or provocation. And, though all regard for reputation is not quite laid aside in the other
sex, 'tis, however, at so low an ebb, that very few among them seem to think virtue and conduct
of absolute necessity for preserving it. If this be not so, how comes it to pass, that women
of tainted reputations find the same countenance and reception in all public places, with those
of the nicest virtue, who pay, and receive visits from them without any manner of scruple?
which proceeding, as it is not very old among us, so I take it to be of most pernicious consequence:
It looks like a sort of compounding between virtue and vice, as if a woman were allowed to
be vicious, provided she be not a profligate; as if there were a certain point, where gallantry
ends, and infamy begins, or that a hundred criminal amours were not as pardonable as half a score.

Besides those corruptions already mentioned, it would be endless to enumerate such as arise
from the excess of play or gaming: The cheats, the quarrels, the oaths and blasphemies among
the men; among the women, the neglect of household affairs, the unlimited freedoms, the indecent
passion; and lastly, the known inlet to all lewdness, when after an ill run, the person must
answer the defects of the purse; the rule on such occasions holding true in play as it does
in law; quod non habet in crumena, luat in corpore.

But all these are trifles in comparison, if we step into other scenes, and consider the fraud
and cozenage of trading men and shopkeepers; that insatiable gulf of injustice and oppression,
the law. The open traffic for all civil and military employments, (I wish it rested there)
without the least regard to merit or qualifications; the corrupt management of men in office;
the many detestable abuses in choosing those who represent the people, with the management
of interest and factions among the representatives. To which I must be bold to add, the ignorance
of some of the lower clergy; the mean servile temper of others; the pert pragmatical demeanour
of several young stagers in divinity, upon their first producing themselves into the world;
with many other circumstances, needless, or rather invidious, to mention; which falling in
with the corruptions already related, have, however unjustly, almost rendered the whole order
contemptible.

This is a short view of the general depravities among us, without entering into particulars,
which would be an endless labour. Now, as universal and deep-rooted as these appear to be,
I am utterly deceived, if an effectual remedy might not be applied to most of them; neither
am I at present upon a wild speculative project, but such a one as may be easily put in execution.

For, while the prerogative of giving all employments continues in the Crown, either immediately,
or by subordination; it is in the power of the Prince to make piety and virtue become the fashion
of the age, if, at the same time, he would make them necessary qualifications for favour and
preferment.

It is clear, from present experience, that the bare example of the best prince will not have
any mighty influence, where the age is very corrupt. For, when was there ever a better prince
on the throne than the present Queen? I do not talk of her talent for government, her love
of the people, or any other qualities that are purely regal; but her piety, charity, temperance,
conjugal love, and whatever other virtues do best adorn a private life; wherein, without question
or flattery, she hath no superior: yet, neither will it be satire or peevish invective to affirm,
that infidelity and vice are not much diminished since her coming to the crown, nor will, in
all probability, till some more effectual remedies be provided.

Thus human nature seems to lie under this disadvantage, that the example alone of a vicious
prince, will, in time, corrupt an age; but that of a good one, will not be sufficient to reform
it, without further endeavours. Princes must therefore supply this defect by a vigorous exercise
of that authority, which the law has left them, by making it every man's interest and honour,
to cultivate religion and virtue; by rendering vice a disgrace, and the certain ruin to preferment
or pretensions: All which they should first attempt in their own courts and families. For instance;
might not the Queen's domestics of the middle and lower sort, be obliged, upon penalty of suspension,
or loss of their employments, to a constant weekly attendance, at least, on the service of
the church; to a decent behaviour in it; to receive the Sacrament four times in the year; to
avoid swearing and irreligious profane discourses; and, to the appearance, at least, of temperance
and chastity? Might not the care of all this be committed to the strict inspection of proper
persons? Might not those of higher rank, and nearer access to her Majesty's person, receive
her own commands to the same purpose, and be countenanced, or disfavoured, according as they
obey? Might not the Queen lay her injunctions on the Bishops, and other great men of undoubted
piety, to make diligent enquiry, to give her notice, if any person about her should happen
to be of libertine principles or morals? Might not all those who enter upon any office in her
Majesty's family, be obliged to take an oath parallel with that against simony, which is administered
to the clergy? 'Tis not to be doubted, but that if these, or the like proceedings, were duly
observed, morality and religion would soon become fashionable court virtues; and be taken up
as the only methods to get or keep employments there, which alone would have mighty influence
upon many of the nobility and principal gentry.

But, if the like methods were pursued as far as possible, with regard to those who are in the
great employments of state, it is hard to conceive how general a reformation they might in
time produce among us. For, if piety and virtue were once reckoned qualifications necessary
to preferment; every man thus endowed, when put into great stations, would readily imitate
the Queen's example, in the distribution of all offices in his disposal; especially if any
apparent transgression, through favour or partiality, would be imputed to him for a misdemeanour,
by which he must certainly forfeit his favour and station: And there being such great numbers
in employment, scattered through every town and county in this kingdom; if all these were exemplary
in the conduct of their lives, things would soon take a new face, and religion receive a mighty
encouragement: Nor would the public weal be less advanced; since, of nine offices in ten that
are ill executed, the defect is not in capacity or understanding, but in common honesty. I
know no employment, for which piety disqualifies any man; and if it did, I doubt the objection
would not be very seasonably offered at present; because, it is perhaps too just a reflection,
that in the disposal of places, the question whether a person be fit for what he is recommended
to, is generally the last that is thought on, or regarded.
