It does not matter who wrote that--the point is its occurrence in an ordinary collection of
songs to music neither better nor worse than many others. When we read such verses as this,
or as the still more charming Address to Love given on page 122, there is evident at once the
non so che which distinguishes this period. There is a famous story of a good-natured conversation
between Scott and Moore in the latter days of Sir Walter, in which the two poets agreed that
verse which would have made a fortune in their young days appeared constantly in magazines
without being much regarded in their age. No sensible person will mistake the meaning of the
apparent praise. It meant that thirty years of remarkable original production and of much study
of models had made possible and common a standard of formal merit which was very rare at an
earlier time. Now this standard of formal merit undoubtedly did not generally exist in the
days of Elizabeth. But what did generally exist was the "wind blowing where it listeth," the
presence and the influence of which are least likely to be mistaken or denied by those who
are most strenuous in insisting on the importance and the necessity of formal excellence itself.
I once undertook for several years the criticism of minor poetry for a literary journal, which
gave more room than most to such things, and during the time I think I must have read through
or looked over probably not much less than a thousand, certainly not less than five or six
hundred volumes. I am speaking with seriousness when I say that nothing like the note of the
merely casual pieces quoted or referred to above was to be detected in more than at the outside
two or three of these volumes, and that where it seemed to sound faintly some second volume
of the same author's almost always came to smother it soon after. There was plenty of quite
respectable poetic learning: next to nothing of the poetic spirit. Now in the period dealt
with in this volume that spirit is everywhere, and so are its sisters, the spirits of drama
and of prose. They may appear in full concentration and lustre, as in Hamlet or The Faërie
Queene; or in fitful and intermittent flashes, as in scores and hundreds of sonneteers, pamphleteers,
playwrights, madrigalists, preachers. But they are always not far off. In reading other literatures
a man may lose little by obeying the advice of those who tell him only to read the best things:
in reading Elizabethan literature by obeying he can only disobey that advice, for the best
things are everywhere.[69]

[69] In the twenty years which have passed since this book was first published, monographs
on most of the points indicated on p. 459 have appeared, both in England and America.
