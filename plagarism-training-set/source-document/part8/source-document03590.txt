Information is available regarding the activities of some of these personnel.  One of the drivers
of the earth-sampling group's lead-lined tank, an Army sergeant who traveled three times to
ground zero, received an exposure of 15 roentgens.  A second tank driver, also an Army sergeant,
received an exposure of 3.3 roentgens.  Three members of the earth-sampling group, all of whom
traveled in the tank to ground zero, received exposures of 10, 7.5, and 5 roentgens.  An Army
photographer who entered the test area six times between 23 July and 20 October received 12.2
roentgens (1).

Four individuals involved with excavating the buried supports of the TRINITY tower from 8 October
to 10 October 1945 received gamma exposures ranging from 3.4 to 4.7 roentgens.  Film badge
readings for this three-day period indicate that the two individuals who operated mechanical
shovels received 3.4 and 4.3 roentgens, while the two who supervised and monitored the excavation
received exposures of 4.2 and 4.7 roentgens.  The individual receiving 4.7 roentgens during
the excavation operation had received 1.3 roentgens from a previous exposure, making his total
exposure 6 roentgens (1).

An Army captain who accompanied all test and observer parties into the ground zero area between
1 September and 11 October 1945 received a total gamma exposure of 2.6 roentgens (1).  The
activities and times of exposure are not known for other personnel with exposures over 2 roentgens.

According to the dosimetry records for 1946, about 115 people visited the test site that year.
No one ventured inside the fence surrounding ground zero, and no one received an exposure greater
than 1 roentgen (1; 16).
