According to the Parliamentary Returns in May, 1819, the total number of lunatics comprised
in the circle of London and different private asylums, amounted to 2,005, which Dr. Burrows
calculates as proving an increase of only five on an average in twenty years, notwithstanding
the increase of our population. The late Dr. Heberden and Dr. Willan both concurred in this
statement. The large district of Mary-la-bonne, which some years ago comprehended the greatest
proportion of inhabitants in the metropolis, not less than 80,000,--from 1814 to the year 1819
received only 180 female lunatics, and 118 males.

INGREDIENTS OF MODERN LOVE.

  Twenty glances, twenty tears,
  Twenty hopes, and twenty fears,
  Twenty times assail your door,
  And if denied, come twenty more,
  Twenty letters perfumed sweet,
  Twenty nods in every street,
  Twenty oaths, and twenty lies,
  Twenty smiles, and twenty sighs,
  Twenty times in jealous rage,
  Twenty beauties to engage,
  Twenty tales to whisper low,
  Twenty billet-doux to show,
  Twenty times a day to pass,
  Before a flattering looking-glass,
  Twenty times to stop your coach,
  With twenty words of fond reproach,
  Twenty days of keen vexation,
  Twenty opera assignations,
  Twenty nights behind the scenes,
  To dangle after mimic queens,
  Twenty such lovers may be found,
  Sighing for twenty thousand pounds,
  But take my word, ye girls of sense,
  You'll find them not worth twenty-pence.

GREAT AND SMALL.

A shopkeeper at Poncaster had, for his virtues, obtained the name of the little rascal. A stranger
asked him why this application was given him? "To distinguish me from the rest of my trade,"
quoth he, "who are all great rascals."

EPIGRAM FROM THE SPANISH OF REBOLLEDO.

(For the Mirror.)

  Fair Phillis has fifty times registered vows,
  That of Christian or Turk, she would ne'er be the spouse,
    For wedlock so much she disdain'd,
  And neither of these she has married, 'tis true,
  For now she's the wife of a wealthy old Jew;
    And thus she her vow has maintain'd!

THE LAWYER AND HIS CLIENT.

  Two lawyers, when a knotty cause was o'er,
  Shook hands and were as good friends as before,
  "Zounds!" says the losing client, "how come yaw
    To be such friends, who were such foes just naw?"
  "Thou fool," says one, "we lawyers tho' so keen,
  Like shears, ne'er cut ourselves, but what's between."
