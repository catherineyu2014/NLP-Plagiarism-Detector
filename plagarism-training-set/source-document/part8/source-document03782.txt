The prohibition was renewed 8 Edward IV., c. 2., which inflicted a penalty of one hundred shillings
for every person "other than his menial servant, officer, or man learned in the one law or
the other," so retained by anyone "of what estate, degree, or condition that he be." The fine
was to be repeated for every month "that any such person is so retained by him by oath, writing,
indenture or promise," and a similar penalty attached to the person retained. But there were
many exceptions--"Provided that this ordinance do not extend to any livery given or to be given
at the King's or Queen's coronation, or at the installation of an archbishop or bishop, or
erection, creation, or marriage of any lord or lady of estate, or at the creation of Knights
of the Bath, or at the commencement of any clerk in any university, or at the creation of serjeants
in the law, or by any gild, fraternity, or mystery corporate, or by the mayor and sheriffs
of London, or any other mayor, sheriff, or other chief officer of any city, borough, town,
or port of this realm of England for the time being, during that time and for executing their
office or occupation; nor to any badges or liveries to be given in defence of the King or of
this realm of England; nor to the constable and marshal, nor to any of them for giving any
badge, livery or token for any such feat of arms to be done within this realm; nor to any of
the wardens towards Scotland for any livery, badge, or token of them to be given from Trent
northward, at such time only as shall be necessary to levy people for the defence of the said
marches, or any of them."

A MEDIÆVAL HOUSEHOLD

The establishment of a great noble or ecclesiastic sometimes embraced a vast category of persons;
and if we would learn on what an elaborate scale housekeeping might be conducted by subjects,
we cannot do better than turn to Gascoigne's account of Cardinal Wolsey's colossal retinue.
After stating that the ambitious churchman had in attendance upon him "men of great possessions
and for his guard the tallest yeomen in the realm," he proceeds:

"And first, for his house, you shall understand that he had in his hall three boards, kept
with three several officers, that is, a steward that was always a priest; a treasurer that
was ever a knight; and a comptroller that was an esquire; also a confessor, a doctor, three
marshals, three ushers in the hall, besides two almoners and grooms.

"Then had he in the hall-kitchen two clerks, a clerk-comptroller, and a surveyor over the dresser,
with a clerk in the spicery, which kept continually a mess together in the hall; also, he had
in the kitchen two cooks, labourers, and children, twelve persons; four men of the scullery,
two yeomen of the pastry, with two other paste-layers under the yeomen.

"Then had he in his kitchen a master-cook, who went daily in velvet or satin, with a gold chain,
besides two other cooks and six labourers in the same room.

"In the larder, one yeoman and a groom; in the scullery, one yeoman and two grooms; in the
buttery, two yeomen and two grooms; in the ewry, so many; in the cellar three yeomen and three
pages; in the chandlery, two yeomen; in the wafery, two yeomen; in the wardrobe of beds the
master of the wardrobe and twenty persons besides; in the laundry, a yeoman, groom, and thirteen
pages; two yeomen purveyors, and a groom purveyor; in the bakehouse, two yeomen and grooms;
in the woodyard, one yeoman and a groom; in the barn, one yeoman; porters at the gate, two
yeomen and two grooms; a yeoman in his barge, and a master of his horse; a clerk of the stables,
and a yeoman of the same; a farrier and a yeoman of the stirrup; a maltlour and sixteen grooms,
every one of them keeping four geldings.

"Then he had gentlemen cup-bearers, and carvers, and of the sewers, both of the great chamber
and of the privy-chamber, forty persons; six yeomen ushers, eight grooms of his chamber; also,
he had of alms, who were daily waiters of his board at dinner, twelve doctors and chaplains,
besides them of his chapel, which I never rehearsed; a clerk of his closet, and two secretaries,
and two clerks of his signet; four counsellors learned in the law.

"And for that he was chancellor of England, it was necessary to have officers of the chancery
to attend him for the better furniture of the same.

"First he had a riding clerk, a clerk of the crown, a clerk of the hamper, and a chafer; then
he had a clerk of the check, as well upon the chaplains as upon the yeomen of the chamber;
he had also four footmen, garnished with rich running coats, whensoever he had any journey.
Then he had a herald of arms, a physician, an apothecary, four minstrels, a keeper of his tents,
an armourer and instructor of his wards, an instructor of his wardrobe of robes, a keeper of
his chamber continually; he had also in his house a surveyor of York, a clerk of the greencloth.
All these were daily attending, down-lying and up-rising; and at meat he had eight continual
boards for the chamberlains and gentlemen-officers, having a mess of young lords, and another
of gentlemen; besides this there was never a gentleman, or officer, or other worthy person,
but he kept some two, some three persons to wait upon them; and all others at the least had
one, which did amount to a great number of persons.

"Now, having declared the order according to the chain roll, use of his house, and what officers
he had daily attending to furnish the same, besides retainers and other persons, being suitors,
[that] dined in the hall: and, when shall we see any more such subjects that shall keep such
a noble house? Therefore here is an end of his household; the number of persons in the chain
were eight hundred persons."[18]

MINSTRELS AND PAGES

One department of Wolsey's household may not have passed unheeded--namely, the minstrels. As
a class, these musicians were doubtless peripatetic, so that the term "wandering," as applied
to them, has almost the character of a standing epithet. But in the "Romance of Sir Degrevant"
mention occurs of the Earl's "owne mynstralle," and, where these artists were not permanent
members of the establishment, they were always of "great admittance" to the houses of the nobility,
who treated them with high distinction and much liberality. Naturally, the status of minstrels
differed. Of those who played before Edward I. at Whitsuntide, and who were divided into ranks,
five are styled "Kings," and each of them received five marks. A valuable gold cup is recorded
to have been given to a minstrel, but the usual presents were robes and garments.

What is signified by the phrase "great admittance" is rendered clear by a decree of Edward
II. published in the year 1315, and called forth by the dishonest practice of certain persons
who procured entertainment under colour of minstrelsy. It was therefore ordered that "to the
houses of prelates, earls, and barons none resort to meat and drink unless he be a minstrel,
and that of these minstrels there come none except it be three or four Minstrels of Honour
at the most in one day, unless he be desired of the lord of the house; and to the houses of
meaner men that none shall come unless he be desired; and that such as shall come so, hold
themselves contented with meat and drink, and with such courtesy as the master of the house
will show unto them of his own good will, without their asking of anything."

Minstrels, however, were after all only an incident. They served to entertain and amuse, as
well as to keep alive the memory of great deeds and sentiments of truth and honour. But they
were essentially a luxury, not a necessity, for the circumstances of a rough age sufficed to
perpetuate the type which it had created. For more stable and significant elements we must
look elsewhere. Just as the lower fabric of society reposed on the humble apprentice, so its
upper framework depended on the page as the repository of its traditions and guarantee of the
future. As early as the reign of Henry II., and doubtless earlier, the sons of nobles and gentlemen
were entered at the King's Court, baronial halls, and episcopal palaces as "henchmen." To these
scions of chivalry--and a similar remark applies to the "demoiselles," their sisters--such
places were a school of manners wherein they learnt the duties of obedience and reverence to
their elders and betters; and, in process of time, they attained the rank of squire, and, eventually,
the knight's belt. Received into the lord's family on the best terms, as became their birth
and connexions, they had, nevertheless, to wait at table and perform other tasks that would
now be deemed menial, such as walking by the lord's charger; and, until their education was
complete, they had to submit to his orders, whatever they might be.

Perhaps the first of many books on etiquette in English is a treatise written by Grosseteste
for Margaret, Countess of Lincoln, and entitled "Reules Seynt Robert." Here it is laid down
that servants and retainers should be of good character, loyal, diligent; and if they grumble
or gainsay, they should be discharged, as there are many others to take their place.

We have seen that Cardinal Wolsey had young gentlemen in his household. This was also the case
with Thomas à Becket, one of whose protégés was the heir to the throne. Another churchman,
Longchamps, Bishop of Ely and Chancellor of Richard II., was notorious for the rigour of his
discipline towards the young and noble members of his establishment.

The custom, one can scarcely question, was evolved from the military requirements of early
Teutonic society; and, as private war died down, so the status of the page became impaired,
until in the reign of Elizabeth we find him a pampered domestic, whose pert air and gaudy dress
represented all that was left of a formidable troop armed with sword and buckler. Ben Jonson
deplores and ridicules the transformation in lines with which the present volume may well close.
The host in the play has refused his son as page to Lord Lovel, saying that he would hang him
sooner than "damn him to that desperate course of life."

    Lovel. Call you that desperate, which, by a line
  Of institution from our ancestors,
  Hath been derived down to us, and received
  In succession for the noblest way
  Of brushing up our youth, in letters, arms,
  Fair mien, discourses civil, exercise,
  And all the blazon of a gentleman?
  Where can he learn to vault, to fence,
  To move his body gracefully, to speak
  The language pure; or turn his mind
  Or manners more to the harmony of nature
  Than in these nurseries of nobility?
    Host. Ay, that was when the nursery's self was noble
  And only virtue made it, not the market,
  That titles were not vended at the drum
  And common outcry; goodness gave the greatness
  And greatness worship; every house became
  An academy; and those parts
  We see depicted in the practice now
  Quite from the institution.
    Lovel. Why do you say so?
  Or think so enviously? Do they not still
  Learn thus the Centaur's skill, the art of Thrace,
  To ride? or Pollux's mystery, to fence?
  The Pyrrick gestures, both to stand and spring
  In armour, to be active for the wars;
  To study figures, numbers, and proportions
  May yield them great in counsel and the arts:
  To make their English sweet upon their tongues,
  As Chaucer says?
