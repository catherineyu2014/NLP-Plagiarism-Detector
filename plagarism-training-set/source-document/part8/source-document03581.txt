     I am a little Norwegian girl, though I was born in America. I am
     twelve years old. Not all the Norwegian ships in which Leif
     Ericsson and his company sailed to America were as small as the one
     described in "Ships Past and Present," in YOUNG PEOPLE No.
     14, for one of them had sixty men and five women on board. Some of
     the ancient Norwegian ships were quite large. I have read in
     Traditions of Norwegian Kings, by Snorro Sturrleson, about
     Ormen Lange (the Long Serpent), a large and handsome ship
     which belonged to King Olaf Tryggveson. That part of the keel which
     touched the ground when the ship was being built measured 112 feet.
     The ship carried a crew of more than 600 men. It was Leif Ericsson,
     not Olaf Ericsson, who sailed to America.

  E.

Tryggveson, who reigned in Norway A.D. 995-1000, had ships which were the wonder of the North.
His largest war ship was the Long Serpent, supposed to be of the size of a frigate of forty-five
guns. In a great sea-fight with the Kings of Denmark and Sweden, King Olaf Tryggveson was conquered,
and is said to have sprung overboard from the famous Long Serpent into a watery grave.

     Here is a recipe that some little girl may like to try. Two
     table-spoonfuls sugar; one table-spoonful butter; one
     table-spoonful milk; one well-beaten egg; four atoms of cream of
     tartar; two atoms of soda; flour enough to make a batter. You must
     get cook or mamma to measure the atoms. This recipe will make four
     little patty-pans of cake, and there will be some batter left to
     thicken for cookies. I cut out the cookies with mamma's thimble.

     In our parlor there is a little mouse that has a hole in one corner
     of the fire-place. Before I fed it it was quite tame, and would run
     all about the room. I feed it now, and it only comes to get the
     crumbs I put close by its hole. Can any one among your
     correspondents tell me how to tame it?

     I have a rabbit, kitten, parrot, dog, canary, and a pair of
     chickens. I had a crow, but it died. I have a burying-ground for my
     pets, and in it there is the poor crow, a dog, two bantams, and
     seven canaries.

     I want to tell you about my dog Joe. He is a setter. He does a
     great many capers. He watches for the boy who brings the evening
     paper, and takes it, and brings it up stairs to us. He plays
     hide-and-seek with me, and sometimes I tie a rope to his collar,
     and he draws me on my skates. How fast we do go! One day I hitched
     him to a sled for the first time, and he did not know what to make
     of it. He ran a little way, and then tipped me into a snow-bank,
     and made for home.

     I had a pair of pet rabbits which I prized very much. Papa built a
     hutch for them, and they enjoyed their home very much. I fed them
     with clover, cabbage, and apples. Sometimes I gave them a dish of
     sweet milk to drink. They were growing so nice; but we had an old
     cat which I suppose thought if the rabbits were out of the way, she
     would get all the milk herself. One morning I fed them, and forgot
     to give Spiney her milk. (That was the old cat's name.) So she went
     down to the hutch and watched them drink their milk. When they had
     finished, they popped their little heads out between the bars. Old
     Spiney sprang on them, and that was the last of my poor rabbits.

Bertha A. F. saw the bluebirds at Sag Harbor, Long Island, on the day before St. Valentine's,
and on February 20 she picked willow "pussies." O. T. Mason says he found the "pussies" in
Medway, Massachusetts, as early as January 18, but he neglected to report them.

AGGIE R. H.--Nourmahal, afterward called Nourjehan, or "Light of the World," was the wife of
Selim, son of Akbar, Mogul Emperor of Hindostan. Selim succeeded his father in 1605, and was
henceforth known as Jehanghir, or "Conqueror of the World." In the early part of his reign
Selim was intemperate and cruel, but after his marriage with the beautiful Nourmahal his conduct
greatly improved. Her influence over her husband was very great. He took no step without consulting
her, and as she was an extraordinary and accomplished woman, her advice was always wise and
judicious. Jehanghir died in 1627, and was succeeded by his son Shah Jehan, who was the father
of Aurungzebe, whose beautiful daughter, Lalla Rookh, is the heroine of Moore's poem. The historical
facts concerning the beautiful Nourmahal are very meagre, but a few glimpses into her life
are given in the notes to the "Vale of Cashmere," the last story in Lalla Rookh.

W. CLARENCE.--To make a kite, the sticks must first be tied tightly and firmly together in
the centre. A string is then put round the outside. The end of each stick should be notched
to hold the string in place. The paper, which should be thin and tough, is now pasted on. A
tail of pieces of paper or cloth tied at intervals in a string must be fastened at the bottom
to balance the kite in the wind. The length of the tail depends on the size of the kite.

is the best for ordinary use. Translating is not often remunerative.

JOHNNY P.--The long-bow was the English national weapon in early times. It was originally used
by the Norse tribes, and was brought into Western Europe by Rollo, first Duke of Normandy,
a direct ancestor of William the Conqueror. When the Normans invaded England they carried the
long-bow with them, and as the Saxons had no weapon so powerful, they readily adopted it. The
proper length of the long-bow, which was made of yew or ash, was the height of the archer who
used it. The largest ones, however, were six feet long, and as the arrow was always half the
length of the bow, the longest arrows measured three feet, which is just a cloth yard. They
were therefore given the name of "cloth-yard shaft." The arrows were made of oak, ash, or yew.
They were tipped with steel, and ornamented at the other end with three gray goose feathers,
from whence comes the name of "gray-goose shaft," usually applied to those arrows which were
shorter than the cloth yard measure. The arrow or bolt of the cross-bow, or arbalast, was also
tipped with steel, and varied in length according to the size of the cross-bow.
