Satisfied that the work was thoroughly done, the Americans leaped upon the Intrepid's deck,
cut with swords and axes the hawsers lashing them to the Philadelphia, manned the sweeps, and,
just as the flames were scorching their own yards and bulwarks, swung clear. Then came the
struggle for escape, and this last scene can best be told, perhaps, in the words of one of
the participants, Commodore Charles Morriss, who gave on that night, when he was the first
to board the Philadelphia, the earliest proof of the great qualities which afterwards made
him one of the first sailors of his time. "Up to this time," he wrote, "the ships and batteries
of the enemy had remained silent, but they were now prepared to act; and when the crew of the
ketch gave three cheers in exultation of their success, they received the return of a general
discharge from the enemy. The confusion of the moment probably prevented much care in their
direction, and though under the fire of nearly a hundred pieces for half an hour, the only
shot which struck the ketch was one through the topgallant sail. We were in greater danger
from the Philadelphia, whose broadsides commanded the passage by which we were retreating,
and whose guns were loaded, and discharged as they became heated. The appearance of the ship
was, indeed, magnificent. The flames in the interior illuminated her ports, and, ascending
her rigging and masts, formed columns of fire, which, meeting the tops, were reflected into
beautiful capitals; whilst the occasional discharge of her guns gave an idea of some directing
spirit within her. The walls of the city and its batteries, and the masts and rigging of cruisers
at anchor, brilliantly illuminated and animated by the discharge of artillery, formed worthy
adjuncts and an appropriate background to the picture. Fanned by a light breeze our exertions
soon carried us beyond the range of their shot, and at the entrance of the harbour we met the
boats of the Siren, which had been intended to co-operate with us, and whose crew rejoiced
at our success, whilst they grieved at not having been able to partake in it.... The success
of this enterprise added much to the reputation of the navy, both at home and abroad. Great
credit was given, and was justly due to Commodore Preble, who directed and first designed it,
and to Lieutenant Decatur, who volunteered to execute it, and to whose coolness, self-possession,
resources, and intrepidity its success was, in an eminent degree, due."

Commodore Preble, in the meantime, hurried his preparations for more serious work, and on July
25th arrived off Tripoli with a squadron, consisting of the frigate Constitution, three brigs,
three schooners, six gun-boats, and two bomb vessels. Opposed to him were arrayed over a hundred
guns mounted on shore batteries, nineteen gun-boats, one ten-gun brig, two schooners mounting
eight guns each, and twelve galleys. Between August 3rd and September 3rd five attacks were
made, and though the town was never reduced, substantial damage was inflicted, and the subsequent
satisfactory peace rendered possible. Preble was relieved by Barron in September, not because
of any loss of confidence in his ability, but from exigencies of the service, which forbade
the Government sending out an officer junior to him in the relief squadron which reinforced
his own. Upon his return to the United States he was presented with a gold medal, and the thanks
of Congress were tendered him, his officers, and men, for gallant and faithful services.

The blockade was maintained vigorously, and in 1805 an attack was made upon the Tripolitan
town of Derna, by a combined land and naval force; the former being under command of Consul-General
Eaton, who had been a captain in the American army, and of Lieutenant O'Bannon of the Marines.
The enemy made a spirited though disorganized defence, but the shells of the war-ships drove
them from point to point, and finally their principal work was carried by the force under O'Bannon
and Midshipman Mann. Eaton was eager to press forward, but he was denied reinforcements and
military stores, and much of his advantage was lost. All further operations were, however,
discontinued in June, 1805, when, after the usual intrigues, delays, and prevarications, a
treaty was signed by the Pasha, which provided that no further tribute should be exacted, and
that American vessels should be for ever free of his rovers. Satisfactory as was this conclusion,
the uncomfortable fact remains that tribute entered into the settlement. After all the prisoners
had been exchanged man for man, the Tripolitan Government demanded, and the United States paid,
the handsome sum of sixty thousand dollars to close the contract.

This treaty, however, awakened the conscience of Europe, and from the day it was signed the
power of the Barbary Corsairs began to wane. The older countries saw their duty more clearly,
and ceased to legalize robbery on the high seas. To America the success gave an immediate position
which could not easily have been gained in any other way, and, apart from its moral results,
the contest with Tripoli was the most potent factor in consolidating the navy of the United States.

XXI.

THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS.

1816.

Nelson was in the Mediterranean at the beginning of the nineteenth century, as every one knows,
but the suppression of the Barbary Corsairs formed no part of his instructions. Twice, indeed,
he sent a ship of war to inquire into the complaints of the consuls, but without effect; and
then on the glorious Twenty-First of October, 1805, the great admiral fell in the supreme hour
of victory. Collingwood made no attempt to deal with the Algerine difficulty, beyond sending
a civilian agent and a present of a watch, which the Dey consigned to his cook. The British
victories appear to have impressed the pirates' mind but slightly; and in 1812 we find Mr.
A'Court (Lord Heytesbury) condescending to negotiate terms between the Corsairs and our allies
the Portuguese, by which the latter obtained immunity from molestation and the release of their
countrymen by the payment altogether of over a million of dollars, and an annual tribute of
$24,000.

To the United States of America belongs the honour of having first set an example of spirited
resistance to the pretensions of the Corsairs. So long as they had been at war with Great Britain,
the States were unable to protect their commerce in the Mediterranean; and they were forced
to fall in with the prevailing custom and make peace with the robbers on the basis of a bribe
over a million of Spanish dollars, and a large annual tribute in money and naval stores. But
as soon as the Treaty of Ghent set them free in 1815 they sent a squadron to Algiers, bearing
Mr. William Shaler as American consul, and Captains Bainbridge and Stephen Decatur as his assessors
in the impending negotiations. The result was that after only two days a Treaty was concluded
on June 30, 1815, by which all money payment was abolished, all captives and property were
restored, and the United States were placed on the footing of the most favoured nation. The
arguments of the Americans appear to have been more eloquent than British broadsides.

Shamed by this unexpected success, the English Government at length sent Lord Exmouth (formerly
Sir Edward Pellew) to obtain favourable terms for some of the minor Mediterranean Powers, and
to place the Ionian Islands, as British dependencies, on the same footing as England. Yet he
was evidently not authorized to proceed to extreme measures or demand unconditional surrender
of existing pretensions. He arranged terms for Naples, which still included tribute and presents.
Sardinia escaped for a sum down. The Ionians were admitted on the English footing. Then Lord
Exmouth went on to Tunis and Tripoli, and obtained from the two Beys the promise of the total
abolition of Christian slavery.

His proceedings at Tunis were marked by much firmness, and rewarded with commensurate success.
He arrived on the 12th of April, 1816, shortly after a Tunisian Corsair, in devastating one
of the Sardinian islands, had roused the indignation of Europe. Lord Exmouth demanded nothing
less than the total abolition of Christian slavery. "It happened that at this very time Caroline,
Princess of Wales, was enjoying the splendid hospitality of Mahmūd Bey in his city palace.
Neither party seemed inclined to yield, and matters assumed a very threatening aspect. The
mediation of the royal guest was invoked in vain; Lord Exmouth was inexorable. The Princess
sent the greater part of her baggage to the Goletta, the British merchants hastened to embark
on board the vessels of the squadron, the men-of-war were prepared for action, and the Bey
did his best to collect all available reinforcements. The excitement in Tunis was immense,
and a pacific solution was considered almost impossible. On the 16th Lord Exmouth, accompanied
by Mr. Consul-General Oglander and his staff, proceeded to the Bardo Palace. The flagstaff
of the British Agency was previously lowered to indicate a resolution to resort to an appeal
to arms in case of failure, and the Princess of Wales expected every hour to be arrested as
a hostage. The antecedents of the Bey were not precisely calculated to assuage her alarm, but
Mahmūd sent one of his officers to assure her that, come what might, he should never dream
of violating the Moslem laws of hospitality. While the messenger was still with her, Lord Exmouth
entered the room and announced the satisfactory termination of his mission. On the following
morning the Bey signed a Treaty whereby in the name of the Regency he abolished Christian slavery
throughout his dominions. Among the reasons which induced the Bey to yield to the pressure
used by Lord Exmouth was the detention of the Sultan's envoy, bearing the imperial firman and
robe of investiture, at Syracuse. The Neapolitan Government would not allow him to depart until
the news of the successful result of the British mission had arrived, and Mahmūd felt it impossible
to forego the official recognition of his suzerain."[90]

The wife of George IV. was extremely angry at being interrupted in a delightful course of entertainments,
and picnics among the ruins of Carthage and the orange groves, whither she repaired in the
Bey's coach and six, escorted by sixty memlūks. The Tunisians were, of course, indignant at
the Bey's surrender, nor did piracy cease on account of the Treaty. Holland, indeed, repudiated
the blackmail in 1819, but Sweden still paid a species of tribute in the form of one hundred
and twenty-five cannons in 1827.

Having gained his point at Tunis and Tripoli--a most unexpected triumph--Lord Exmouth came
back to Algiers, and endeavoured to negotiate the same concessions there, coolly taking up
his position within short range of the batteries. His proposals were indignantly rejected,
and he was personally insulted; two of his officers were dragged from their horses by the mob,
and marched through the streets with their hands tied behind their backs; the consul, Mr. McDonell,
was put under guard, and his wife and other ladies of his family were ignominiously driven
into the town from the country house.[91] Lord Exmouth had no instructions for such an emergency;
he arranged that ambassadors should be sent from Algiers to London and Constantinople to discuss
his proposal; and then regretfully sailed for England. He had hardly returned when news arrived
of extensive massacres of Italians living under British protection at Bona and Oran by order
of the Dey--an order actually issued while the British admiral was at Algiers. Lord Exmouth
was immediately instructed to finish his work. On the 25th of July in the same year his flagship,
the Queen Charlotte, 108, led a squadron of eighteen men of war, of from ten to one hundred
and four guns, and including three seventy-fours, out of Portsmouth harbour. At Gibraltar the
Dutch admiral, Baron Van Capellan, begged to be allowed to join in the attack with six vessels,
chiefly thirty-sixes, and when the time came he fought his ships admirably. On the 27th of
August they arrived in the roads of Algiers. The Prometheus had been sent ahead to bring off
the consul McDonell and his family. Captain Dashwood succeeded in bringing Mrs. and Miss McDonell
on board; but a second boat was less fortunate: the consul's baby took the opportunity of crying
just as it was being carried in a basket past the sentinel, by the ship's surgeon, who believed
he had quieted it. The whole party were taken before the Dey, who, however, released all but
the boat's crew, and, as "a solitary instance of his humanity," sent the baby on board. The
Consul-General himself remained a prisoner.

No reply being vouchsafed to his flag of truce, Lord Exmouth bore up to the attack, and the
Queen Charlotte dropped anchor in the entrance of the Mole, some fifty yards off, and was lashed
to a mast which was made fast to the shore. A shot from the Mole, instantly answered from the
flagship, opened the battle. "Then commenced a fire," wrote the admiral, "as animated and well-supported
as I believe was ever witnessed, from a quarter before three till nine, without intermission,
and which did not cease altogether till half-past eleven [P.M.]. The ships immediately following
me were admirably and coolly taking up their stations, with a precision even beyond my most
sanguine hope; and never did the British flag receive, on any occasion, more zealous and honourable
support.

"The battle was fairly at issue between a handful of Britons, in the noble cause of Christianity,
and a horde of fanatics, assembled round their city, and enclosed within its fortifications,
to obey the dictates of their Despot. The cause of God and humanity prevailed; and so devoted
was every creature in the fleet, that even British women served at the same guns with their
husbands, and, during a contest of many hours, never shrank from danger, but animated all around
them."

Some of the men-of-war, especially the Impregnable, Rear-Admiral Milne, were hard beset; but
about ten o'clock at night the main batteries were silenced, and in a state of ruin, and "all
the ships in the port, with the exception of the outer frigate [which had been boarded], were
in flames, which extended rapidly over the whole arsenal, storehouses, and gun-boats, exhibiting
a spectacle of awful grandeur and interest no pen can describe."[92] At one o'clock everything
in the Marine seemed on fire: two ships wrapped in flames drifted out of the port. Heavy thunder,
lightning, and rain, increased the lurid effect of the scene.

Next morning, says Mr. Shaler, "the combined fleets are at anchor in the bay, apparently little
damaged; every part of the town appeared to have suffered. The Marine batteries are in ruins,
and may be occupied without any effort. Lord Exmouth holds the fate of Algiers in his hands."

Instead, however, of demolishing the last vestige of the fortifications, and exacting pledges
for future good behaviour, the admiral concluded a treaty by which prisoners of war in future
should be exchanged and not enslaved; and the whole of the slaves in Algiers, to the number
of 1,642 (chiefly Italian, only eighteen English), were at once set at liberty, and the Dey
was made to refund the money, amounting to nearly four hundred dollars, which he had that year
extorted from the Italian States. Finally, he was made to publicly apologize to the unfortunate
McDonell, who had been confined during the siege half naked in the cell for condemned murderers,
loaded with chains, fastened to the wall, exposed to the heavy rain, and momentarily expecting
his doom. He was now reinstated, and publicly thanked by the admiral.

It was, indeed, satisfactory to have at last administered some salutary discipline to the insolent
robbers of Algiers; but it had been well if the lesson had been final. Their fleet was certainly
gone: they had but two vessels left. Their fortifications were severely damaged, but these
were soon repaired. No doubt it was no small advantage to have demonstrated that their batteries
could be turned and silenced; but it would have been better to have taken care that they should
never mount another gun. Even the moral effect of the victory seems to have been shortlived,
for when, in 1819, in pursuance of certain resolutions expressed at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle
(1818) the French and English admirals delivered "identical notes" to the new Dey, that potentate
replied after his manner by throwing up earthworks.

As a matter of fact the same course of insolence and violence continued after the Battle of
Algiers as before. Free European girls were carried off by the Dey; the British consulate was
forced open, and even the women's rooms searched; Mr. McDonell was still victimized; and the
diplomacy and a little fancy firing of Sir Harry Neale in 1824 failed to produce the least
effect. Mr. McDonell had to be recalled, and the Dey as usual had his own way. Nothing but
downright conquest could stop the plague, and that final measure was reserved for another nation
than the English.

stated that the fleet fired 118 tons of powder, 50,000 shot, nearly 1,000 shells, &c. The English
lost 128 killed and 690 wounded. The admiral was wounded in three places, his telescope broken
in his hand, and his coat cut to strips. Nor was the Dey less forward at the post of danger.

XXII.

THE FRENCH IN AFRICA.

1830-1881.

The successes of the English and American fleets had produced their effects, not so much in
arresting the course of piracy, as in encouraging the European States to defy the pirates.
The coup de grâce was administered by France--the vis-à-vis, the natural opponent of the Algerine
Corsairs, and perhaps the chief sufferer by their attacks. A dispute in April, 1827, between
the French consul and the Dey, in which the former forgot the decencies of diplomatic language,
and the latter lost his temper and struck the offender with the handle of his fan, led to an
ineffectual blockade of Algiers by a French squadron for two years, during which the Algerines
aggravated the breach by several acts of barbarity displayed towards French prisoners. Matters
grew to a crisis; in August, 1829, the Dey dismissed a French envoy and fired upon his ship
as he was retiring under a flag of truce; and it became evident that war on a decisive scale
was now inevitable.

Accordingly, on May 26th, 1830, a large fleet sailed out of Toulon. Admiral Duperré commanded,
and the land-forces on board numbered thirty-seven thousand foot, besides cavalry and artillery.
Delayed by stress of weather, the fleet was not sighted off Algiers till June 13th, when it
anchored in the Bay of Sidi Ferrūj, and there landed next day, with little opposition, and
began to throw up entrenchments. A force of Arabs and Kabyles was severely defeated on the
19th, with the loss of their camp and provisions, and the French slowly pushed their way towards
the city, beating back the Algerines as they advanced. The defenders fought game to the last,
but the odds were overwhelming, and the only wonder is that so overpowering a force of besiegers,
both by sea and land, should have evinced so much caution and diffidence of their own immense
superiority. On July 4th, the actual bombardment of the city began; the Fort de l'Empereur
was taken, after the Algerines had blown up the powder magazine; and the Dey asked for terms
of surrender. Safety of person and property for himself and for the inhabitants of the city
was promised by the French commander, and on this condition the enemy occupied Algiers on the
following day, July 5th. A week later the Dey, with his family and attendants and belongings,
sailed for Naples in a French frigate, and Algiers had seen the last of its Mohammedan rulers.[93]

Here, so far as Algiers is concerned, the Story of the Corsairs properly ends. But a glance
at the events which have occurred during the French occupation may usefully supplement what
has already been recorded. The conquest had been marked by a moderation and humanity which
did infinite honour to the French arms; it would have been well if a similar policy had distinguished
their subsequent proceedings. It is not necessary to dwell upon the assurance given by France
to Great Britain that the occupation was only temporary; upon the later announcement of permanent
annexation; or upon England's acquiescence in the perfidy, upon the French engaging never to
push their conquests further to the east or west of Algiers--an engagement curiously illustrated
by the recent occupation of Tunis. But if the aggrandizement of France in North Africa is matter
for regret, infinitely more to be deplored is the manner in which the possession of the interior
of the country has been effected. It is not too much to say that from the moment when the French,
having merely taken the city of Algiers, began the work of subduing the tribes of the interior
in 1830, to the day when they at last set up civil, instead of military, government, after
the lessons of the Franco-German war in 1870, the history of Algeria is one long record of
stupidly brutal camp-rule, repudiation of sacred engagements, inhuman massacres of unoffending
natives of both sexes and all ages, violence without judgment, and severity without reason.
One French general after another was sent out to bring the rebellious Arabs and Kabyles into
subjection, only to display his own incompetence for the inhuman task, and to return baffled
and brutalized by the disgraceful work he thought himself bound to carry out. There is no more
humiliating record in the annals of annexation than this miserable conquest of Algiers. It
is the old story of trying to govern what the conquerors call "niggers," without attempting
to understand the people first. Temper, justice, insight, and conciliation would have done
more in four years than martial intolerance and drum tyranny accomplished in forty.

In all these years of miserable guerilla warfare, in which such well-known commanders as Bugeaud,
Pelissier, Canrobert, St. Arnaud, MacMahon, and many more, learned their first demoralizing
lessons in warfare, the only people who excite our interest and admiration are the Arab tribes.
That they were unwise in resisting the inevitable is indisputable; but it is no less certain
that they resisted with splendid valour and indomitable perseverance. Again and again they
defeated the superior forces of France in the open field, wrested strong cities from the enemy,
and even threatened to extinguish the authority of the alien in Algiers for ever. For all which
the invaders had only to thank themselves. Had General Clausel, the first military governor
of Algiers, been a wise man, the people might have accepted, by degrees, the sovereignty of
France. But the violence of his measures, and his ignorance of the very word "conciliation,"
raised up such strenuous opposition, engendered such terrible reprisals, and set the two parties
so hopelessly against each other, that nothing less than a prolonged struggle could be expected.

The hero of this sanguinary conflict was 'Abd-el-Kādir, a man who united in his person and
character all the virtues of the old Arabs with many of the best results of civilization. Descended
from a saintly family, himself learned and devout, a Hāj or Meccan pilgrim; frank, generous,
hospitable; and withal a splendid horseman, redoubtable in battle, and fired with the patriotic
enthusiasm which belongs to a born leader of men, 'Abd-el-Kādir became the recognized chief
of the Arab insurgents. The Dey of Algiers had foreseen danger in the youth, who was forced
to fly to Egypt in fear of his life. When he returned, a young man of twenty-four, he found
his country in the hands of the French, and his people driven to desperation. His former fame
and his father's name were talismans to draw the impetuous tribes towards him; and he soon
had so large a following that the French deemed it prudent for the moment to recognize him
(1834) as Emīr of Maskara, his native place, of which he had already been chosen king by general
acclamation. Here he prepared for the coming struggle; and when the French discovered a pretext
for attacking him in 1835, they were utterly routed on the river Maska. The fortunes of war
vacillated in the following year, till in May, 1837, 'Abd-el-Kādir triumphantly defeated a
French army in the plain of the Metija. A fresh expedition of twenty thousand met with no better
success, for Arabs and Berbers are hard to trap, and 'Abd-el-Kādir, whose strategy evoked the
admiration of the Duke of Wellington, was for a time able to baffle all the marshals of France.
The whole country, save a few fortified posts, was now under his sway, and the French at last
perceived that they had to deal with a pressing danger. They sent out eighty thousand men under
Marshal Bugeaud, and the success of this officer's method of sweeping the country with movable
columns was soon apparent. Town after town fell; tribe after tribe made terms; even 'Abd-el-Kādir's
capital, Takidemt, was destroyed; Maskara was subdued (1841); and the heroic chief, still repudiating
defeat, retreated to Morocco. Twice he led fresh armies into his own land, in 1843 and 1844;
the one succumbed to the Duc d'Aumale, the other to Bugeaud. Pelissier covered himself with
peculiar glory by smoking five hundred men, women, and children to death in a cave. At last,
seeing the hopelessness of further efforts and the misery they brought upon his people, 'Abd-el-Kādir
accepted terms (1847), and surrendered to the Duc d'Aumale on condition of being allowed to
retire to Alexandria or Naples. It is needless to add that, in accordance with Algerian precedent,
the terms of surrender were subsequently repudiated, though not by the Royal Duke, and the
noble Arab was consigned for five years to a French prison. Louis Napoleon eventually allowed
him to depart to Brusa, and he finally died at Damascus in 1883, not, however, before he had
rendered signal service to his former enemies by protecting the Christians during the massacres
of 1860.

Though 'Abd-el-Kādir had gone, peace did not settle upon Algeria. Again and again the tribes
revolted, only to feel once more the merciless severity of their military rulers. French colonists
did not readily adopt the new field for emigration. It seemed as though the best thing would
be to withdraw from a bootless, expensive, and troublesome venture. Louis Napoleon, however,
when he visited Algiers in 1865, contrived somewhat to reassure the Kabyles, while he guaranteed
their undisturbed possession of their territories; and until his fall there was peace. But
the day of weakness for France was the opportunity for Algiers, and another serious revolt
broke out; the Kabyles descended from their mountains, and Gen. Durieu had enough to do to
hold them in check. The result of this last attempt, and the change of government in France,
was the appointment of civil instead of military governors, and since then Algeria has on the
whole remained tranquil, though it takes an army of fifty thousand men to keep it so. There
are at least no more Algerine Corsairs.

It remains to refer to the affairs of Tunis. If there was provocation for the French occupation
of Algiers in 1830, there was none for that of Tunis in 1881.[94] It was a pure piece of aggression,
stimulated by the rival efforts of Italy, and encouraged by the timidity of the English Foreign
Office, then under the guidance of Lord Granville. A series of diplomatic grievances, based
upon no valid grounds, was set up by the ingenious representative of France in the Regency--M.
Théodore Roustan, since deservedly exposed--and the resistance of the unfortunate Bey, Mohammed
Es-Sādik, to demands which were in themselves preposterous, and which obviously menaced his
semi-independence as a viceroy of the Ottoman Empire, received no support from any of the Powers,
save Turkey, who was then depressed in influence and resources by the adversities of the Russian
invasion. The result was natural: a strong Power, unchecked by efficient rivals, pursued her
stealthy policy of aggression against a very weak, but not dishonest, State; and finally seized
upon the ridiculous pretext of some disturbances among the tribes bordering on Algeria to invade
the territory of the Bey. In vain Mohammed Es-Sādik assured M. Roustan that order had been
restored among the tribes; in vain he appealed to all the Powers, and, above all, to England.
Lord Granville believed the French Government when it solemnly assured him that "the operations
about to commence on the borderland between Algeria and Tunis are meant solely to put an end
to the constant inroads of the frontier clans into Algerian territory, and that the independence
of the Bey and the integrity of his territory are in no way threatened." It was Algiers over
again, but with even more serious consequences to English influence--indeed to all but French
influence--in the Mediterranean. "Perfide Albion" wholly confided in "Perfida Gallia," and
it was too late to protest against the flagrant breach of faith when the French army had taken
Kef and Tabarka (April 26, 1881), when the tricolor was floating over Bizerta, and when General
Bréart, with every circumstance of insolent brutality, had forced the Treaty of Kasr-es-Sa'īd
upon the luckless Bey under the muzzles of the guns of the Republic (May 12th). It is difficult
to believe that the feeling of the English statesmen of the day is expressed in the words--Haec
olim meminisse juvabit.

The Bey had been captured--he and since his death Sidi 'Alī Bey have continued to be the figureheads
of the French Protectorate--but his people were not so easily subdued. The southern provinces
of Tunis broke into open revolt, and for a time there ensued a period of hopeless anarchy,
which the French authorities made no effort to control. At last they bestirred themselves,
and to some purpose. Sfax was mercilessly bombarded and sacked, houses were blown up with their
inhabitants inside them, and a positive reign of terror was inaugurated, in which mutual reprisals,
massacres, and executions heightened the horrors of war. The whole country outside the fortified
posts became the theatre of bloodshed, robbery, and anarchy. It was the history of Algiers
in petto. Things have slowly improved since then, especially since M. Roustan's recall; doubtless
in time Tunis will be as subdued and as docile as Algiers; and meanwhile France is developing
the resources of the land, and opening out one of the finest harbours in existence. Yet M.
Henri de Rochefort did not, perhaps, exaggerate when he wrote: "We compared the Tunisian expedition
to an ordinary fraud. We were mistaken. The Tunis business is a robbery aggravated by murder."
The "Algerian business" was of a similar character. Qui commence bien finit bien, assumes Admiral
Jurien de la Gravière in his chapter entitled "Gallia Victrix." If the history of France in
Africa ends in bringing the southern borderlands of the Mediterranean, the old haunts of the
Barbary Corsairs, within the pale of civilization, it may some day be possible to bury the
unhappy past, and inscribe upon the tombstone the optimistic motto: Finis coronat opus.

PUBLICATIONS OF G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS

THE SCRIPTURES,

HEBREW AND CHRISTIAN.

ARRANGED AND EDITED AS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE.

EDITORS.

REV. EDWARD T. BARTLETT, D.D.,

Dean of the Divinity School of the P. E. Church in Philadelphia, and Mary Wolfe, Prof. of Ecclesiastical
History.

REV. JOHN P. PETERS, PH.D.,

Professor of Old Testament Literature and Language in the Divinity School of the P. E. Church
in Philadelphia, and Professor of Hebrew in the University of Pennsylvania.

The work is to be completed in three volumes, containing each about 500 pages, Vols. I. and
II. now ready.

Vol. I. includes Hebrew story from the Creation to the time of Nehemiah, as in the Hebrew canon.

Vol. II. is devoted to Hebrew poetry and prophecy.

Vol. III. will contain the selections from the Christian Scriptures.

The volumes are handsomely printed in 12mo form, and with an open, readable page, not arranged
in verses, but paragraphed according to the sense of the narrative.

Each volume is complete in itself, and will be sold separately at $1.50.

The editors say in their announcement: "Our object is to remove stones of stumbling from the
path of young readers by presenting Scriptures to them in a form as intelligible and as instructive
as may be practicable. This plan involves some re-arrangements and omissions, before which
we have not hesitated, inasmuch as our proposed work will not claim to be the Bible, but an
introduction to it. That we may avoid imposing our own interpretation upon Holy Writ, it will
be our endeavor to make Scripture serve as the commentary on Scripture. In the treatment of
the Prophets of the Old Testament and the Epistles of the New Testament, it will not be practicable
entirely to avoid comment, but no attempt will be made to pronounce upon doctrinal questions."

The first volume is divided into four parts:

PART I.--Hebrew Story, from the Beginning to the Time of Saul.
 "  II.--The Kingdom of all Israel.
 " III.--Samaria, or the Northern Kingdom.
 "  IV.--Judah, from Rehoboam to the Exile.

The second volume comprises:

PART I.--Hebrew History from the Exile To Nehemiah.
 "  II.--Hebrew Legislation.
 " III.--Hebrew Tales.
 "  IV.--Hebrew Prophecy.
 "   V.--Hebrew Poetry.
 "  VI.--Hebrew Wisdom.

The third volume will comprise the selections from the New Testament, arranged as follows:

   I.--The Gospel according to St. Mark, Presenting the Evangelical
       Story in its Simplest Form; Supplemented by
       Selections from St. Matthew and St. Luke.
  II.--The Acts of the Apostles, with some Indication of the
       Probable Place of the Epistles in the Narrative.
 III.--The Epistles of St. James and the First Epistle of St. Peter.
  IV.--The Epistles of St. Paul.
   V.--The Epistle to the Hebrews.
  VI.--The Revelation of St. John (A Portion).
 VII.--The First Epistle of St. John.
VIII.--The Gospel of St. John.

Full details of the plan of the undertaking, and of the methods adopted by the editors in the
selection and arrangement of the material, will be found in the separate prospectus.

"I congratulate you on the issue of a work which, I am sure, will find a wide welcome, and
the excellent features of which make it of permanent value."--Rt. Rev. Henry C. Potter, Bishop
of New York.

"Should prove a valuable adjunct of Biblical instruction."--Rt. Rev. W. E. Stevens, Bishop
of Pennsylvania.

"Admirably conceived and admirably executed.... It is the Bible story in Bible words. The work
of scholarly and devout men.... Will prove a help to Bible study."--Rev. Howard Crosby, D.D.

"We know of no volume which will better promote an intelligent understanding of the structure
and substance of the Bible than this work, prepared, as it is, by competent and reverent Christian
scholars."--Sunday-School Times. Use of hyphenation and accents have also been made consistent
without note, where there was a definite preference of one variation over the other.

The following amendments have also been made (the errors in the index being amended with reference
to the main text):

  Page viii--41 amended to 40--"... Unsuccessful siege of Bujēya,
  40 ..."

  Page 72--Tinnēs amended to Tinnis--"... Damietta, Alexandria,
  Tinnis, and Cairo ..."

  Page 83--Vizīr amended to Vezīr--"The Grand Vezīr
  Ibrahīm recognized ..."

  Page 133--a closing quote immediately before footnote reference
  [40] has been deleted. The text immediately preceding this quote
  mark does not occur in the referenced work, so I have made the
  assumption that this quote mark was a typographical error and
  deleted it.

  Page 175--battaille amended to bataille--"... the centre corps
  de bataille ..."

  Page 222, footnote--less amended to lest--"... the hold lest it
  should interfere ..."

  Page 230--absoluting amended to absolutely--"... and absolutely
  prohibiting all trade ..."

  Page 233--cruize amended to cruise--"... and cruise across the
  Egyptian trade route ..."

  Page 242, second footnote--Olive amended to Oliver--"second ed.,
  London, Oliver Payne, ..."

  Page 280--omitted word 'to' added--"... from an English frigate
  to which he spoke ..."

  Page 283--Vizir amended to Vezīr--"... a present of female
  slaves for the Grand Vezīr."

  Page 298--Rear-Amiral amended to Rear-Admiral--"Rear-Admiral
  Milne, were hard beset ..."

  Page 311--41 amended to 40--"attacks Bujēya, 40;"

  Page 312--Francis amended to François--"Bourbon, François de, 106"

  Page 312--Castelnuova amended to Castelnuovo--"Castelnuovo, 105"

  Page 314--38 amended to 36--"Kheyr-ed-dīn Barbarossa, birth, 31
  and n., 36 n.;"

Any remaining variations in spelling or unusual usage of language are as in the original text,
for example, the author's use of annihilate in the past tense without the usual 'd' ending.

Some illustrations have been shifted slightly so that they are not in the middle of a paragraph.
The illustration tags for the decorative chapter headers and footers have not been retained
in this version.

The forward advertising material and frontispiece illustration have been moved to follow the
title page.
