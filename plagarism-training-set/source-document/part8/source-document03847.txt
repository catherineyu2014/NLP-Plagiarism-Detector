CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTORY.

Gasoline and electricity have made possible the modern automobile. Each has its work to do
in the operation of the car, and if either fails to perform its duties, the car cannot move.
The action of the gasoline, and the mechanisms that control it are comparatively simple, and
easily understood, because gasoline is something definite which we can see and feel, and which
can be weighed, or measured in gallons. Electricity, on the other hand, is invisible, cannot
be poured into cans or tanks, has no odor, and, therefore, nobody knows just what it is. We
can only study the effects of electricity, and the wires, coils, and similar apparatus in which
it is present. It is for this reason that an air of mystery surrounds electrical things, especially
to the man who has not made a special study of the subject.

Without electricity, there would be no gasoline engine, because gasoline itself cannot cause
the engine to operate. It is only when the electrical spark explodes or "ignites" the mixture
of gasoline and air which has been drawn into the engine cylinders that the engine develops
power. Thus an electrical ignition system has always been an essential part of every gasoline
automobile.

The first step in the use of electricity on the automobile, in addition to the ignition system,
consisted in the installation of an electric lighting system to replace the inconvenient oil
or gas lamps which were satisfactory as far as the light they gave was concerned, but which
had the disadvantage of requiring the driver to leave his seat, and light each lamp separately,
often in a strong wind or rain which consumed many matches, time, and frequently spoiled his
temper for the remainder of the evening. Electric lamps have none of these disadvantages. They
can be controlled from the driver's seat, can be turned on or off by merely turning or pushing
a switch-button, are not affected by wind or rain, do not smoke up the lenses, and do not send
a stream of unpleasant odors back to the passengers.

The apparatus used to supply the electricity for the lamps consisted of a generator, or a "storage"
battery, or both. The generator alone had the disadvantage that the lamps could be used only
while the engine was running. The battery, on the other hand, furnished light at all times,
but had to be removed from the car frequently, and "charged." With both the generator and battery,
the lights could be turned on whether the engine was running or not, and, furthermore, it was
no longer necessary to remove the battery to "charge," or put new life into it. With a generator
and storage battery, moreover, a reliable source of electricity for ignition was provided,
and so we find dry batteries and magnetos being discarded in a great many automobiles and "battery
ignition" systems substituted.

The development of electric lighting systems increased the popularity of the automobile, but
the motor car still had a great drawback-cranking. Owing to the peculiar features of a gasoline
engine, it must first be put in motion by some external power before it will begin to operate
under its own power. This made it necessary for the driver to "crank" the engine, or start
it moving, by means of a handle attached to the engine shaft. Cranking a large engine is difficult,
especially if it is cold, and often results in tired muscles, and soiled clothes and tempers.
It also made it impossible for the average woman to drive a car because she did not have the
strength necessary to "crank" an engine.

The next step in the perfection of the automobile was naturally the development of an automatic
device to crank the engine, and thus make the driving of a car a pleasure rather than a task.
We find, therefore, that in 1912, "self-starters" began to be used. These were not all electrical,
some used tanks of compressed air, others acetylene, and various mechanical devices, such as
the spring starters. The electrical starters, however, proved their superiority immediately,
and filled such a long felt want that all the various makes of automobiles now have electric
starters. The present day motor car, therefore, uses gasoline for the engine only, but uses
electricity for ignition, starting, lighting, for the horn, cigar lighters, hand warmers on
the steering wheel, gasoline vaporizers, and even for shifting speed changing gears, and for
the brakes.

On any car that uses an electric lighting and starting system, there are two sources of electricity,
the generator and the battery, These must furnish the power for the starting, or "cranking"
motor, the ignition, the lights, the horn, and the other devices. The demands made upon the
generator are comparatively light and simple, and no severe work is done by it. The battery,
on the other hand is called upon to give a much more severe service, that of furnishing the
power to crank the engine. It must also perform all the duties of the generator when the engine
is not running, since a generator must be in motion in order to produce electricity.

A generator is made of iron, copper, carbon, and insulation. These are all solid substances
which can easily be built in any size or shape, and which undergo very little change as parts
of the generator. The battery is made mainly of lead, lead compounds, water and sulphuric acid.
Here we have liquids as well as solids, which produce electricity by changes in their composition,
resulting in complicated chemical as well as electrical actions.

  [Fig. 1 The Battery]

The battery is, because of its construction and performance, a much abused, neglected piece
of apparatus which is but partly understood, even by many electrical experts, for to understand
it thoroughly requires a study of chemistry as well as of electricity. Knowledge of the construction
and action of a storage battery is not enough to make anyone an expert battery man. He must
also know how to regulate the operating conditions so as to obtain the best service from the
battery, and he must be able to make complete repairs on any battery no matter what its condition
may be.

========================================================================

CHAPTER 2. BATTERIES IN GENERAL

There are two ways of "generating" electricity on the car: 1. Magnetically, 2. Chemically.
The first method is that used in a generator, in which wires are rotated in a "field" in which
magnetic forces act. The second method is that of the battery, and the one in which we are
now interested.

If two unlike metals or conducting substances are placed in a liquid which causes a greater
chemical change in one of the substances than in the other, an electrical pressure, or "electromotive"
force is caused to exist between the two metals or conducting substances. The greater the difference
in the chemical action on the substances, the greater will be the electrical pressure, and
if the substances are connected together outside of the liquid by a wire or other conductor
of electricity, an electric current will flow through the path or "circuit" consisting of the
liquid, the two substances which are immersed in the liquid, and the external wire or conductor.

As the current flows through the combination of the liquid, and the substances immersed in
it, which is called a voltaic "cell," one or both of the substances undergo chemical changes
which continue until one of the substances is entirely changed. These chemical changes produce
the electrical pressure which causes the current to flow, and the flow will continue until
one or both of the substances are changed entirely. This change due to the chemical action
may result in the formation of gases, or of solid compounds. If gases are formed they escape
and are lost. If solids are formed, no material is actually lost.

Assuming that one of the conducting substances, or "electrodes," which are immersed in the
liquid has been acted upon by the liquid, or "electrolyte," until no further chemical action
can take place, our voltaic cell will no longer be capable of causing a flow of electricity.
If none of the substances resulting from the original chemical action have been lost as gases,
it may be possible to reverse the entire set of operations which have taken place. That is,
suppose we now send a current through the cell from an outside source of electricity, in a
direction opposite to that in which the current produced by the chemical action between the
electrodes and electrolyte flowed. If this current now produces chemical actions between electrodes
and electrolyte which are the reverse of those which occurred originally, so that finally we
have the electrodes and electrolyte brought back to their original composition and condition,
we have the cell just as it was before we used it for the production of an electrical pressure.
The cell can now again be used as a source of electricity as long as the electrolyte acts upon
the electrodes, or until it is "discharged" and incapable of any further production of electrical
pressure. Sending a current through a discharged cell, so as to reverse the chemical actions
which brought about the discharged conditions, is called "charging" the cell.

  [Fig. 2 A complete cell; Negative group; Positive group]

Cells in which an electrical pressure is produced as soon as the electrodes are immersed in
the electrolyte are called it "primary" Cells. In these cells it is often impossible, and always
unsatisfactory to reverse the chemical action as explained above. Cells whose chemical actions
are reversible are called "storage" or "secondary" cells. In the "storage" cells used today,
a current must first be sent through the cell in order to cause the chemical changes which
result in putting the electrodes and electrolyte, in such a condition that they will be capable
of producing an electrical pressure when the chemical changes caused by the current are complete.
The cell now possesses all the characteristics of a primary cell, and may be used as a source
of electricity until "discharged." It may then be "charged" again, and so on, the chemical
action in one case causing a flow of current, and a reversed flow of current causing reversed
chemical actions.

We see from the above that the "storage" battery does not "store" electricity at all, but changes
chemical into electrical energy when "discharging," and changes electrical into chemical energy
when "charging," the two actions being entirely reversible. The idea of "storing" electricity
comes from the fact that if we send a current of electricity through the cell for a certain
length of time, we can at a later time draw a current from the cell for almost the same length
of time.

  [Fig. 3 Complete Element]

  group of plates and separators ready for placing in the hard rubber
  jars.

Three things are therefore required in a storage cell, the liquid or "electrolyte" and two
unlike substances or electrodes, through which a current of electricity can pass and which
are acted upon by the electrolyte with a chemical action that is greater for one substance
than the other. In the storage cell used on the automobile today for starting and lighting,
the electrodes are lead and peroxide of lead, and the electrolyte is a mixture of sulphuric
acid and water. The peroxide of lead electrode is the one upon which the electrolyte has the
greater chemical effect, and it is called the positive or "+" electrode, because when the battery
is sending a. current through an external circuit, the current flows from this electrode through
the external circuit, and back to the lead electrode, which is called the negative, or electrode.

When starting and lighting systems were adopted in 1912, storage batteries had been used for
many years in electric power stations. These were, however, large and heavy, and many difficult
problems of design had to be solved in order to produce a battery capable of performing the
work of cranking the engine, and yet be portable, light, and small enough to occupy only a
very limited space on the automobile. As a result of these conditions governing the design,
the starting and lighting battery of today is in reality "the giant that lives in a box." The
Electric Storage Battery Company estimates that one of its types of batteries, which measures
only 12-5/8 inches long, 7-3/8 wide, and 9-1/8 high, and weighs only 63-1/2 pounds, can deliver
enough energy to raise itself to a height of 6 miles straight up in the air. It must be able
to do its work quickly at all times, and in all sorts of weather, with temperatures ranging
from below 0° to 100° Fahrenheit, or even higher.

The starting and lighting battery has therefore been designed to withstand severe operating
conditions. Looking at such a battery on a car we see a small wooden box in which are placed
three or more "cells," see Fig. 1. Each "cell" has a hard, black rubber top through which two
posts of lead project. Bars of lead connect the posts of one cell to those of the next. To
one of the posts of each end cell is connected a cable which leads into the car, and through
which the current leaves or enters the battery. At the center of each cell is a removable rubber
plug covering an opening through which communication is established with the inside of the
cell for the purpose of pouring in water, removing some of the electrolyte to determine the
condition of the battery, or to allow gases formed within the cell to escape. Looking down
through this opening we can see the things needed to form a storage battery: the electrolyte,
and the electrodes or "plates" as they are called. If we should remove the lead bars connecting
one cell to another, and take off the black cover, we should find that the posts which project
out of the cells are attached to the plates which are broad and flat, and separated by thin
pieces of wood or rubber., If we lift out the plates we find that they are connected alternately
to the two lead posts, and that the two outside ones have a gray color. If we pull the plates
out from each Other, we find that the plates next to the two outside ones, and all other plates
connected to the same lead post as these have a chocolate-brown color. If we remove the jar
of the cell, we find that it is made of hard rubber. Pouring out the electrolyte we find several
ridges which hold the plates off the bottom of the jar. The pockets formed by these ridges
may contain some soft, muddy substance. Thus we have exposed all the elements of a cell, posts,
plates, "separators," and electrolyte. The gray colored plates are attached to the "negative"
battery post, while the chocolate-brown colored ones are connected to the "positive" battery
post. Examination will show that each of the plates consists of a skeleton metallic framework
which is filled with the brown or gray substances. This construction is used to decrease the
weight of the battery. The gray filler material is pure lead in a condition called "spongy
lead." The chocolate-brown filler substance is peroxide of lead.

We have found nothing but two sets of plates--one of pure lead, the other of peroxide of lead,
and the electrolyte of sulphuric acid and water. These produce the heavy current necessary
to crank the engine. How this is done, and what the chemical actions within the cell are, are
described in Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 3. MANUFACTURE OF STORAGE BATTERIES. ---------------------------------

To supply the great number of batteries needed for gasoline automobiles, large companies have
been formed. Each company has its special and secret processes which it will not reveal to
the public. Only a few companies, however, supply batteries in any considerable quantities,
the great majority of cars being supplied with batteries made by not more than five or six
manufacturers. This greatly reduces the number of possible different designs in general use today.

The design and dimensions of batteries vary considerably, but the general constructions are
similar. The special processes of the manufacturers are of no special interest to the repairman,
and only a general description will be given here.

A starting and lighting battery consists of the following principal parts:

1. Plates 2. Separators 3. Electrolyte 4. Jars 5. Covers 6. Cell Connectors and Terminals 7.
Case Plates

Of the two general types of battery plates, Faure and Plante, the Faure, or pasted type, is
universally used on automobiles. In the manufacture of pasted plates there are several steps
which we shall describe in the order in which they are carried out.

Casting the Grid. The grid is the skeleton of the plate. It performs the double function of
supporting the mechanically weak active material and of conducting the current. It is made
of a lead antimony alloy which is melted and poured into a mould. Pure lead is too soft and
too easily attacked by the electrolyte, and antimony is added to give stiffness, and resistance
to the action of the electrolyte in the cell. The amount of antimony used varies in different
makes but probably averages 8 to 10%.
