MR. KENNETH MACKENZIE, MR. M.A. LOWER. MR. GEORGE STEPHENS (of Stockholm), and several anonymous
Correspondents, who have written to us suggesting certain alterations either in our size, price,
mode of publication, or other arrangements, are assured that fully appreciating the kind motives
which have prompted their communications, their respective suggestions will receive our best
attention; and that if we do not adopt them, it will be for reasons the force of which our
Correspondents would, we have no doubt, if they could be made fully acquainted with them, be
the very first to admit.

DELTA, who writes to us respecting the origin of the thought embodied in Cambell's line--

  Like angels' visits, few and far between,"

is referred to our First Vol. p. 102, and our Second Vol. p. 286., for two quotations from
Norris of Bemerton, which embody the same idea.

If MR. JOHN POWERS, who in NOTES AND QUERIES for Jan. 12th. 1850, p. 163., offered to furnish
an extract from Hardiman's Statute of Kilkenny, will have the kindness to so at this distance
of time, and to forward it to us, the Querist to whom he replied, and whose direction we have
just received, will be much obliged to him.

E.T., who inquires respecting the quotation in Sterne,--

  "God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,"

will find many earlier instances of this proverbial expression quoted in our First Vol. pp.
325. 357. 418.

WHERE TO BUY A DRESSING CASE.

In no article perhaps is caution more necessary than in the purchase of a Dressing Case, for
in none are the meretricious arts of the unprincipled manufacturer more frequently displayed.
MECHI, 4. LEADENHALL STREET, near Gracechurch Street, has long enjoyed the reputation of producing
a Dressing Case in the most finished and faultless manner. Those who purchase of him will be
sure of having thoroughly-seasoned and well-prepared wood or leather, with the fittings of
first-rate quality. The prices range from 1l. to 100l. Thus the man of fortune and he of moderate
means may alike be suited, while the traveller will find the Mechian Dressing Case especially
adapted to his necessities.--4. LEADENHALL STREET.
