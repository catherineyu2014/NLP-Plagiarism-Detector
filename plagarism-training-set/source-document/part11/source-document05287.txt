In delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to develop a character different
from those generally portrayed. This woman is neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It
would be vain to mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to remark,
how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the originals of great masters. They
catch the gross parts; but the subtile spirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation
disgusts, when grace was expected to charm.

Those compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing captives, where the soul
of the author is exhibited, and animates the hidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm,
they live in the scenes they represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track, solicitous
to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath, according to the prescribed rules of art.

These chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an echo--even of the sweetest
sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime beams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be
of their own creating--or the prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying principle,
fades and dies.

In an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has thinking powers is displayed.
The female organs have been thought too weak for this arduous employment; and experience seems
to justify the assertion. Without arguing physically about possibilities--in a fiction, such
a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived from the operations of its own faculties,
not subjugated to opinion; but drawn by the individual from the original source.

MARY

CHAP. I.

Mary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who married Eliza, a gentle,
fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in her temper, which might be termed negative good-nature:
her virtues, indeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the shews of things,
and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as the generality approved of. She
was educated with the expectation of a large fortune, of course became a mere machine: the
homage of her attendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never imagined
there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of her own consequence, by these
means, were interwoven in her mind, and the years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial
accomplishments, without having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into the
polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished to be united to; but her
father soon after recommending another in a more distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted
to his will, and promised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.

While they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style, and seldom saw each
other; nor were they much more sociable when they wooed rural felicity for more than half the
year, in a delightful country, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;
for the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved, and sought amusement
in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and after eating an immoderate dinner, generally
fell asleep: this seasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then visit
some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow of health with his wife's
countenance, which even rouge could not enliven, it is not necessary to say which a gourmand
would give the preference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more agreeable
to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was but the shadow of a sound, and
she had, to complete her delicacy, so relaxed her nerves, that she became a mere nothing.

Many such noughts are there in the female world! yet she had a good opinion of her own merit,--truly,
she said long prayers,--and sometimes read her Week's Preparation: she dreaded that horrid
place vulgarly called hell, the regions below; but whether her's was a mounting spirit, I cannot
pretend to determine; or what sort of a planet would have been proper for her, when she left
her material part in this world, let metaphysicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed
spirit.

As she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French waiting-maid, she sent to
the metropolis for all the new publications, and while she was dressing her hair, and she could
turn her eyes from the glass, she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily dissipation,
novels. I say bodily, or the animal soul, for a rational one can find no employment in polite
circles. The glare of lights, the studied inelegancies of dress, and the compliments offered
up at the shrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the senses.

When she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way, she tried another. The
Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other interesting tales were perused with eagerness.
Nothing could be more natural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than
the views of the human heart. What delicate struggles! and uncommonly pretty turns of thought!
The picture that was found on a bramble-bush, the new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught
the swain by the upper-garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.--Fatal image!--It
planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and sent a new kind of a knight-errant into
the world. But even this was nothing to the catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung,
the hornet settling on the sleeping lover's face. What a heart-rending accident! She planted,
in imitation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but there was not a lover to weep in
concert with her, when she watered it with her tears.--Alas! Alas!

If my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit for genius, I would
go on and tell them such tales as would force the sweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious
showers down beautiful cheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so
interesting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to settle the curls himself,
and not interrupt her.

She had besides another resource, two most beautiful dogs, who shared her bed, and reclined
on cushions near her all the day. These she watched with the most assiduous care, and bestowed
on them the warmest caresses. This fondness for animals was not that kind of attendrissement
which makes a person take pleasure in providing for the subsistence and comfort of a living
creature; but it proceeded from vanity, it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest
French expressions of ecstatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned by tenderness.

She was chaste, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word, that is, she did not make
any actual faux pas; she feared the world, and was indolent; but then, to make amends for this
seeming self-denial, she read all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had
she thought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she accompanied the lovers
to the lonely arbors, and would walk with them by the clear light of the moon. She wondered
her husband did not stay at home. She was jealous--why did he not love her, sit by her side,
squeeze her hand, and look unutterable things? Gentle reader, I will tell thee; they neither
of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend to say that they always annexed
an idea to a word; but they had none of those feelings which are not easily analyzed.

CHAP. II.

In due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following year a daughter. After
the mother's throes she felt very few sentiments of maternal tenderness: the children were
given to nurses, and she played with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance
of her recovering strength; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a consumption, to which
her constitution tended. Her children all died in their infancy, except the two first, and
she began to grow fond of the son, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her
time between the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death, though on the borders
of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station occur to her as necessary. Her children
were left in the nursery; and when Mary, the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send
the awkward thing away. To own the truth, she was awkward enough, in a house without any play-mates;
for her brother had been sent to school, and she scarcely knew how to employ herself; she would
ramble about the garden, admire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told
her stories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother talked of enquiring
for a governess when her health would permit; and, in the interim desired her own maid to teach
her French. As she had learned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her
way. Neglected in every respect, and left to the operations of her own mind, she considered
every thing that came under her inspection, and learned to think. She had heard of a separate
state, and that angels sometimes visited this earth. She would sit in a thick wood in the park,
and talk to them; make little songs addressed to them, and sing them to tunes of her own composing;
and her native wood notes wild were sweet and touching.

Her father always exclaimed against female acquirements, and was glad that his wife's indolence
and ill health made her not trouble herself about them. She had besides another reason, she
did not wish to have a fine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter; she still
expected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was very tyrannical and
passionate; indeed so very easily irritated when inebriated, that Mary was continually in dread
lest he should frighten her mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary's tenderness,
and exercised her compassion so continually, that it became more than a match for self-love,
and was the governing propensity of her heart through life. She was violent in her temper;
but she saw her father's faults, and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her
own.--She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon, when she was conscious of having
erred; and her contrition was so exceedingly painful, that she watched diligently the first
movements of anger and impatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.

Sublime ideas filled her young mind--always connected with devotional sentiments; extemporary
effusions of gratitude, and rhapsodies of praise would burst often from her, when she listened
to the birds, or pursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the gloomy
path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen to the sea that was not far
distant. The wandering spirits, which she imagined inhabited every part of nature, were her
constant friends and confidants. She began to consider the Great First Cause, formed just notions
of his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on his wisdom and goodness. Could she have loved
her father or mother, had they returned her affection, she would not so soon, perhaps, have
sought out a new world.

Her sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love; on earth it was not to be found:
her mother had often disappointed her, and the apparent partiality she shewed to her brother
gave her exquisite pain--produced a kind of habitual melancholy, led her into a fondness for
reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious distress.

She had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her feet; and her father had
a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded animals had souls, or they would not have been
subjected to the caprice of man; but what was the soul of man or beast? In this style year
after year rolled on, her mother still vegetating.

A little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. Mary paid her great attention; contrary
to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her mother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged
to leave her sick child while she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit of delirium
stabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal account; and so strongly
did it impress her imagination, that every night of her life the bleeding corpse presented
itself to her when the first began to slumber. Tortured by it, she at last made a vow, that
if she was ever mistress of a family she would herself watch over every part of it. The impression
that this accident made was indelible.

As her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did not understand such a
lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only grown still more whimsical, and that if she
could be prevailed on to exert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In general
he treated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered with his pleasures,
he expostulated in the most cruel manner, and visibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then
assiduously try to turn his attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would
watch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she could not rest. Other causes
also contributed to disturb her repose: her mother's luke-warm manner of performing her religious
duties, filled her with anguish; and when she observed her father's vices, the unbidden tears
would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the gate without being relieved;
if she could do it unperceived, she would give them her own breakfast, and feel gratified,
when, in consequence of it, she was pinched by hunger.

She had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother; they were laughed at, and she
determined never to do it again. In this manner was she left to reflect on her own feelings;
and so strengthened were they by being meditated on, that her character early became singular
and permanent. Her understanding was strong and clear, when not clouded by her feelings; but
she was too much the creature of impulse, and the slave of compassion.

CHAP. III.

Near her father's house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in affluence, but reduced
to great distress by the extravagance of her husband; he had destroyed his constitution while
he spent his fortune; and dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very
scanty pittance. The eldest daughter was for some years educated by a distant relation, a Clergyman.
While she was with him a young gentleman, son to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took
particular notice of her. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung
in concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to her, cultivated her taste,
and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at this juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made
every prospect bright, and gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She returned
to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took no more sweet counsel together.
This disappointment spread a sadness over her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew
fond of solitude, and her character appeared similar to Mary's, though her natural disposition
was very different.

She was several years older than Mary, yet her refinement, her taste, caught her eye, and she
eagerly sought her friendship: before her return she had assisted the family, which was almost
reduced to the last ebb; and now she had another motive to actuate her.

As she had often occasion to send messages to Ann, her new friend, mistakes were frequently
made; Ann proposed that in future they should be written ones, to obviate this difficulty,
and render their intercourse more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling; Mary
had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's letters, whose hand she admired,
she soon became a proficient; a little practice made her write with tolerable correctness,
and her genius gave force to it. In conversation, and in writing, when she felt, she was pathetic,
tender and persuasive; and she expressed contempt with such energy, that few could stand the
flash of her eyes.

As she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she acquired a degree of
equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits were fluctuating, and her movements rapid.
She felt less pain on account of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to
experience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new sorrows, and, as usual,
paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt gratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed
by one object, and friendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced
past scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.

Mary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these consequences produced. When
her friend was all the world to her, she found she was not as necessary to her happiness; and
her delicate mind could not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the
offspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and not perceiving any
thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has shrunk back; and, falling from one extreme
into the other, instead of a warm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions
seemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility.

She would then imagine that she looked sickly or unhappy, and then all her tenderness would
return like a torrent, and bear away all reflection. In this manner was her sensibility called
forth, and exercised, by her mother's illness, her friend's misfortunes, and her own unsettled
mind.

CHAP. IV.

Near to her father's house was a range of mountains; some of them were, literally speaking,
cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested, and gave grandeur to the prospect; and down
many of their sides the little bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river. Through
the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them the birds sung, particularly
the robins; they also found shelter in the ivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story
went; it was situated on the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the sea.
This castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and many tales had the old house-keeper
told her of the worthies who had resided there.

When her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, she would steal to this retirement, where
human foot seldom trod--gaze on the sea, observe the grey clouds, or listen to the wind which
struggled to free itself from the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, she
admired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beautiful tints the gleams of sunshine
gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in existence, and darted into futurity.

One way home was through the cavity of a rock covered with a thin layer of earth, just sufficient
to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs and wild plants, which grew on its sides, and
nodded over the summit. A clear stream broke out of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks
fallen into it. Here twilight always reigned--it seemed the Temple of Solitude; yet, paradoxical
as the assertion may appear, when the foot sounded on the rock, it terrified the intruder,
and inspired a strange feeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat
she read Thomson's Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.

At a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who supported their numerous
children by their precarious labour. In these little huts she frequently rested, and denied
herself every childish gratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants.
Her heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had relieved their wants, or
afforded them pleasure.

In these pursuits she learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet tears of benevolence
frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a sparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not;
on the contrary, they were rather fixed, and would never have been observed if her soul had
not animated them. They were not at all like those brilliant ones which look like polished
diamonds, and dart from every superfice, giving more light to the beholders than they receive
themselves.

Her benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried her out of herself;
and she rested not till she had relieved or comforted them. The warmth of her compassion often
made her so diligent, that many things occurred to her, which might have escaped a less interested
observer.

In like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read, and the emotions thereby
raised were so strong, that it soon became a part of her mind.

Enthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her Creator was almost apparent
to her senses in his works; but they were mostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which
she delighted to contemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of the
voice that could still the tumultuous deep.

These propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions began to exercise their
tyrannic sway, and particularly pointed out those which the soil would have a tendency to nurse.

Years after, when wandering through the same scenes, her imagination has strayed back, to trace
the first placid sentiments they inspired, and she would earnestly desire to regain the same
peaceful tranquillity.

Many nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, conversing with the Author of Nature,
making verses, and singing hymns of her own composing. She considered also, and tried to discern
what end her various faculties were destined to pursue; and had a glimpse of a truth, which
afterwards more fully unfolded itself.

She thought that only an infinite being could fill the human soul, and that when other objects
were followed as a means of happiness, the delusion led to misery, the consequence of disappointment.
Under the influence of ardent affections, how often has she forgot this conviction, and as
often returned to it again, when it struck her with redoubled force. Often did she taste unmixed
delight; her joys, her ecstacies arose from genius.

She was now fifteen, and she wished to receive the holy sacrament; and perusing the scriptures,
and discussing some points of doctrine which puzzled her, she would sit up half the night,
her favourite time for employing her mind; she too plainly perceived that she saw through a
glass darkly; and that the bounds set to stop our intellectual researches, is one of the trials
of a probationary state.

But her affections were roused by the display of divine mercy; and she eagerly desired to commemorate
the dying love of her great benefactor. The night before the important day, when she was to
take on herself her baptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the sun broke in on her meditations,
and found her not exhausted by her watching.

The orient pearls were strewed around--she hailed the morn, and sung with wild delight, Glory
to God on high, good will towards men. She was indeed so much affected when she joined in the
prayer for her eternal preservation, that she could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and
the recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly passions made it grow languid.

These various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the luxuriant shoots restrained
by culture. The servants and the poor adored her.

In order to be enabled to gratify herself in the highest degree, she practiced the most rigid
oeconomy, and had such power over her appetites and whims, that without any great effort she
conquered them so entirely, that when her understanding or affections had an object, she almost
forgot she had a body which required nourishment.

This habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the passions.

We will now enter on the more active field of life.

CHAP. V.

A few months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was attacked by a violent fever,
and died before his father could reach the school.

She was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of consequence, and did not call
her the child. Proper masters were sent for; she was taught to dance, and an extraordinary
master procured to perfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.

A part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir of the person who
still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years younger than our heroine. The fathers,
spite of the dispute, frequently met, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over
a bottle, determined to quash it by a marriage, and, by uniting the two estates, to preclude
all farther enquiries into the merits of their different claims.

While this important matter was settling, Mary was otherwise employed. Ann's mother's resources
were failing; and the ghastly phantom, poverty, made hasty strides to catch them in his clutches.
Ann had not fortitude enough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was
lodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every little comfort; things
that would be no sacrifice when a person is well, are absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily
pain, and support the animal functions.

There were many elegant amusements, that she had acquired a relish for, which might have taken
her mind off from its most destructive bent; but these her indigence would not allow her to
enjoy: forced then, by way of relaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the
pencil he taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagination, and that taste
invigorated love.

Poverty, and all its inelegant attendants, were in her mother's abode; and she, though a good
sort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by her trivial, uninteresting chat, the delirium
in which her daughter was lost.

This ill-fated love had given a bewitching softness to her manners, a delicacy so truly feminine,
that a man of any feeling could not behold her without wishing to chase her sorrows away. She
was timid and irresolute, and rather fond of dissipation; grief only had power to make her reflect.

In every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty, that caught her attention.
And in composition, the polish of style, and harmony of numbers, interested her much more than
the flights of genius, or abstracted speculations.

She often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively imagination, would
frequently study authors whose works were addressed to the understanding. This liking taught
her to arrange her thoughts, and argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most
violent passions.

Ann's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her; she wished so continually
to have a home to receive her in, that it drove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling
on the tender schemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most ardently to
put them in practice.

Fondly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whose decline was so imperceptible,
that they were not aware of her approaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing
the most alarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger; and then first
mentioned to her his designs with respect to his daughter.

She approved of them; Mary was sent for; she was not at home; she had rambled to visit Ann,
and found her in an hysteric fit. The landlord of her little farm had sent his agent for the
rent, which had long been due to him; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remained,
and turn them out, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.

As this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the person to whom he was deputy,
little was to be expected from his forbearance.

All this was told to Mary--and the mother added, she had many other creditors who would, in
all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from them all that had been saved out of the wreck.
"I could bear all," she cried; "but what will become of my children? Of this child," pointing
to the fainting Ann, "whose constitution is already undermined by care and grief--where will
she go?"--Mary's heart ceased to beat while she asked the question--She attempted to speak;
but the inarticulate sounds died away. Before she had recovered herself, her father called
himself to enquire for her; and desired her instantly to accompany him home.

Engrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked silently by his side,
when he roused her out of her reverie by telling her that in all likelihood her mother had
not many hours to live; and before she could return him any answer, informed her that they
had both determined to marry her to Charles, his friend's son; he added, the ceremony was to
be performed directly, that her mother might be witness of it; for such a desire she had expressed
with childish eagerness.

Overwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with a vacant stare, fixed
them on her father's face; but they were no longer a sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain.
As she drew near the house, her wonted presence of mind returned: after this suspension of
thought, a thousand darted into her mind,--her dying mother,--her friend's miserable situation,--and
an extreme horror at taking--at being forced to take, such a hasty step; but she did not feel
the disgust, the reluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.

She loved Ann better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the very jaws of destruction--she
would have encountered a lion. To have this friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy
with respect to her family, would it not be superlative bliss?
