The Blue-throated Hummingbird occurs between 5000 and 9950 feet in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:165)
remarked that it was found in canyon bottoms, "whether at 7500 feet among the rocky slopes,
oaks, and white pines ... or at 5000 feet in the madrone, maples, elms, and basswoods...."
No. 32668, was obtained in a Douglas fir-pine-aspen association at 9950 feet.

[Amazilia yucatanensis chalconota Oberholser.--The Buff-bellied Hummingbird seems to be uncommon
in Coahuila. Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:172) and the AOU Check-list Committee (1957:306)
stated that this hummingbird occurs in Coahuila.]

Megaceryle alcyon alcyon (Linnaeus).--Miller (1955a:165) saw a Belted Kingfisher at Carboneras
Canyon in the Sierra del Carmen. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:15) stated that
one specimen of M. a. alcyon was obtained in Coahuila on November 14.

**Chloroceryle americana hachisukai (Laubmann).--Specimens examined: total 2: [Female] 32053
from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jiménez, June 19, 1952; and [Female] 31038 from 8 mi. N, 4 mi. W Múzquiz,
1800 ft., March 31, 1952.

The Green Kingfisher has been recorded in Coahuila as far south as 8 mi. N and 4 mi. W Múzquiz.
The forehead of No. 31038, when compared with typical representatives of C. a. hachisukai,
is not extensively streaked with white, nor are all the coverts conspicuously spotted with
white, yet it clearly has more extensive white markings than typical representatives of C.
a. septentrionalis. This specimen from 8 mi. N and 4 mi. W Múzquiz probably is intermediate
between hachisukai and septentrionalis. Miller (1955a:165) stated that Marsh took a specimen
at Tanque de los Melones on La Bavia Ranch east of Fresno Mesa in the Sierra del Carmen that
is a typical C. a. hachisukai.

Colaptes cafer collaris Vigors.--Ridgway (1914:34) listed this subspecies of the Red-shafted
Flicker from Saltillo and Agua Nueva.

In suitable habitats in Coahuila the Red-shafted Flicker is common. Miller (1955a:165-166)
stated that C. c. nanus was common at Corte Madera Canyon, Boquillas Canyon, and Carboneras
Canyon in the Sierra del Carmen and recorded a specimen also from Sierra de Jardín on August
7. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:192) recorded C. c. nanus from Diamante Pass and Saltillo. Sutton
and Burleigh (1939a:31) stated that the Red-shafted Flickers, obtained 5 mi. E La Rosa and
at Diamante Pass, may be intermediate between C. c. collaris (then called C. c. chihuahuae)
and C. c. nanus. Nesting of the Red-shafted Flicker in Coahuila was reported by Miller (1955a:165)
and Burleigh and Lowery (1942:192). Hardy saw Red-shafted Flickers 13 mi. E San Antonio de
las Alazanas on July 6, 1955.

The Golden-fronted Woodpecker occurs throughout Coahuila, but uncommonly in the western part.
Wetmore (1948:185-186) examined a series of Golden-fronted Woodpeckers that showed a definite
cline in dorsal coloration from north-central Texas to Jalisco, Michoacán, and Hidalgo in south-central
México. He (loc. cit.) stated that "the extremes are easily separable, but in southern and
southwestern Texas and in northeastern Mexico the two kinds [C. a. aurifrons and C. a. incanescens]
... merge so gradually that over a broad area the whole population is intermediate, making
decisions as to any sharply drawn dividing line difficult and in part arbitrary." C. a. incanescens,
according to Wetmore, occurs in western and central Texas south to northeastern Chihuahua and
northern Coahuila whereas C. a. aurifrons occurs in north-central Coahuila (Monclova) and southern
Texas south to Jalisco, Michoacán, Hidalgo, and central Tamaulipas.

The specimens that I have examined from Coahuila are variably intermediate between the subspecies
aurifrons and incanescens. The dark and white cross-bars on the back of No. 31039 are nearly
equal (dark bands wider in aurifrons; white bands wider in incanescens); the rump and upper
tail coverts are more or less mixed with black as in aurifrons. The dark cross-bars on the
backs of Nos. 32054-32057 are slightly larger than the white cross-bars; the rump and upper
tail coverts of these specimens are somewhat mixed with black.

*Centurus aurifrons incanescens Todd.--This subspecies of the Golden-fronted Woodpecker is
listed by Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:34) from "... northern Coahuila (upper
Río Grande valley)." Burleigh and Lowery (1942:192) stated that the Golden-fronted Woodpecker
"apparently avoids the mountain slopes, but was found to be not uncommon on the arid plateau
about Saltillo." Cory (1919:424) listed the Golden-fronted Woodpecker from Sabinas. Nos. 32055-32057
are juveniles, and thus document breeding by this woodpecker in Coahuila.

The Acorn Woodpecker in Coahuila is common in the oak and pine-oak belts, from 4950 to 8000
feet. Miller (1955a:166) stated that the Acorn Woodpecker in the Sierra del Carmen was an abundant
and conspicuous bird throughout the oak and pine-oak belts, from 5000 to 8000 feet. Breeding
of M. f. formicivorus was reported by Miller (loc. cit.) who took females nearly ready to begin
laying; one of our specimens (No. 29423) had enlarged testes (11 mm.).

Miller (1955a:166) reported this Yellow-bellied Sapsucker as a winter visitant or migrant in
the Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:192) took a female S. v. varius at the summit
of Diamante Pass on April 14. Ridgway (1914:275) listed S. v. varius from Sierra de Guadalupe.

Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis Baird.--Miller (1955a:166) reported this Yellow-bellied Sapsucker
as "indeed common" in the Sierra del Carmen, and indicated that both S. v. nuchalis and S.
v. varius were "found only at the upper levels in the pine-oak formation and usually in relatively
dense clumps of trees in the canyon bottoms." Ridgway (1914:280) listed C. v. nuchalis from
Río Sabinas.

**Dendrocopos villosus icastus (Oberholser).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:39)
remarked that this subspecies of the Hairy Woodpecker occurs, in northwestern México, from
eastern Sonora, Jalisco, Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas to southern Coahuila. Ridgway (1914:222)
stated that D. v. icastus occurs in Coahuila at Carneros and Sierra de Guadalupe, the former
being the easternmost known locality for the subspecies.

In northeastern México this subspecies, according to Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore
(1957:39), occurs in Guanajuato, San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. Nos.
31604 and 32701 represent the first records of D. v. intermedius from Coahuila.

These specimens of the Ladder-backed Woodpecker show signs of intergradation with D. s. symplectus.
Both specimens are pale enough above for D. s. symplectus, but the wing and the tail of each
(wing, 102, 103 mm.; tail, 60, 65 mm.) are too long for symplectus. This suggestion of intergradation
is not unexpected because symplectus occurs in northeastern Coahuila and cactophilus in the
Chisos Mountains of Texas. Miller (1955a:166) also obtained one female D. s. cactophilus from
the Sierra del Carmen that suggested intergradation with symplectus.

Miller (loc. cit.) wrote that D. c. cactophilus was found chiefly in the oaks and was common
in the lower oak belt at 5000 feet. The upper limit of the range of the Ladder-backed Woodpecker,
according to Miller, is 6800 feet. He reported the species as breeding in the Sierra del Carmen.

Miller (1955b:317) took a hybrid woodpecker representing a cross between Dendrocopos villosus
and Dendrocopos scalaris in the Sierra del Carmen, where, although Ladder-backed Woodpeckers
were common, he found no Hairy Woodpeckers.

**Dendrocopos scalaris symplectus (Oberholser).--Specimens examined: total 2: [Male] 32058
from 2 mi. W Jiménez, June 20, 1952; and [Male] 31667 from Sierra Guadalupe, Domingo Canyon
(=10 mi. S, 14 mi. W General Cepeda), 6700 ft., April 18, 1953.

This Ladder-backed Woodpecker, according to the AOU Check-list Committee (1957:327) and Oberholser
(1912:156), occurs in Texas (east of Pecos), northeastern Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas.
The area of intergradation of D. s. symplectus and giraudi is in southeastern Coahuila. The
dark smoky underparts and the equal size of the white and black bars of the upper parts of
No. 31667 suggest intergradation with D. s. giraudi. Yet, the size of the wing indicates that
this specimen is closer to D. s. symplectus. No. 32058 has characters of typical representatives
of D. s. symplectus. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193) reported D. s. symplectus "in the desert
country west of Saltillo." Ridgway (1914:257) listed the Ladder-backed Woodpecker from Sabinas.
Cory (1919:494) listed D. s. symplectus from Pabinas (=Sabinas?).

**Dendrocopos scalaris giraudi (Stone).--Specimen examined: one, [Male] 34623, from 12 mi.
N, 10 mi. E Parras, 3850 ft., July 12, 1953, weight, 35 gms.

Ridgway (1914:259) reported that D. s. giraudi (then called Dryobates scalaris bairdi) has
been recorded from La Ventura, Carneros, and Jaral. Oberholser (1912:159) indicated that the
subspecies giraudi occurs north to Jaral in southern Coahuila, east to La Ventura in southeastern
Coahuila, and south through central México. The present specimen is darker ventrally than specimens
of either D. s. cactophilus or D. s. symplectus, and on its upper surface the black bars are
wider than the white. The specimen is in worn plumage, but nevertheless suggests intergradation
with D. s. symplectus.

Platypsaris aglaiae albiventris (Lawrence).--The Rose-throated Becard, if it occurs in Coahuila
at all, is rare in the State. Without giving any specific locality, Sclater (1857:74) described
Pachyrhamphus aglaiae from Coahuila. Hellmayr (1929:202) considered Sclater's record as representing
Platypsaris aglaiae albiventris (Lawrence).

The small number of records of Cassin's Kingbird in Coahuila is surprising, for I would expect
the species in most areas of the State between 6000 and 7000 feet. All Coahuilan records are
from the southeastern part of the State. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193) found it "on infrequent
occasions in the arid country near Saltillo." Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:71)
reported that T. v. vociferans nested in Coahuila on July 7. The size of the testes (15×7 mm.)
of our specimen from near Bella Unión also indicates breeding.

The status of the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher in Coahuila is uncertain. Although the condition
of the gonads of No. 32063 was not recorded by the collector, the late date (June 19) on which
is was obtained suggests that this female was a resident in northeastern Coahuila. Miller,
Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:69) recorded this flycatcher from Sabinas on April 12.
No other records of Muscivora forficata in Coahuila have come to my attention, but the species
probably occurs in the State in migration.

The Great Crested Flycatcher seems to be rare in Coahuila. Nos. 32065-32067 are the first specimens
that I know of from Coahuila. Bangs (1898:179-180) said that the subspecies crinitus has an
"enormous swollen bill" (exposed culmen of male, 20 mm.; breadth of bill at middle of nostril,
10.3 mm.) whereas M. c. boreus has a "small slender bill" (exposed culmen of male, 18.6 mm.;
breadth of bill at middle of nostril, 8.6 mm.). No. 32066 has a large bill (exposed culmen,
21 mm.; breadth of bill at middle of nostril, 10 mm.). Bangs (loc. cit.) did not give any measurements
for females of M. c. crinitus or boreus. Nevertheless, I suspect that Nos. 32065 and 32067
represent crinitus (No. 32065: exposed culmen, 19 mm.; breadth of bill at middle of nostril,
9 mm.; No. 32067: exposed culmen, 20 mm.; breadth of bill at middle of nostril, 9.5 mm.). The
size of the testes (9 mm. long) of No. 32066 and the dates (June 19 and 20) on which the specimens
were collected indicate breeding by this species in the State. Eastern Coahuila represents
the eastern limit of the range of M. t. cooperi. Measurements of our specimens agree well with
the average measurements of typical M. t. cooperi. According to Ridgway (1907:621), M. t. cooperi
(then called Myiarchus mexicanus mexicanus) has been recorded from Sabinas. The size of the
testes (14×7 mm.) of No. 32068 and the date (June 22) on which the specimens were collected
indicate breeding by this species in the State.

The Ash-throated Flycatcher is common in Coahuila. All specimens examined by me from there
are typical of M. c. cinerascens. Ridgway (1907:626) listed M. c. cinerascens from Monclovia
(=Monclova?) and Sabinas. Miller (1955a:166) found the species "only in the oak belt at 5000
feet, where it was common." Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193) recorded M. c. cinerascens from
"near Saltillo." Dickerman obtained No. 31584 in a mesquite-grassland-shrubby area. Miller,
Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:78) stated that M. c. cinerascens breeds in Coahuila.

Sayornis phoebe (Latham).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:66) recorded the Eastern
Phoebe from Coahuila on November 4-14.

Of the Black Phoebe, the two subspecies semiatra and nigricans intergrade in Coahuila. Typical
representatives of S. n. semiatra are present in northern Coahuila. The under tail coverts
of Nos. 31046-31047 are immaculate and white. Miller (1955:167) noted the two specimens collected
from the Sierra del Carmen to have narrow dark shaft streaks on the under tail coverts. He
(loc. cit.) remarked also that "the marking of the under tail coverts may indicate a beginning
of a gradient in increased darkening of these feathers toward S. n. nigricans in southern Coahuila."

*Sayornis nigricans nigricans (Swainson).--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193) collected several
specimens of S. n. nigricans "on the outskirts of Saltillo" and saw a pair at the Chorro del
Agua on April 19.

Say's Phoebe occurs commonly in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:167) obtained a female with an active
brood patch in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra del Carmen, and remarked that Marsh took a juvenile
on September 2 at El Rincón. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:33) saw this phoebe several times in
southern Coahuila and obtained a male "near San Pedro" on January 29. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193)
recorded this species as "a common breeding bird both on Diamante Pass and on the arid plateau
around Saltillo." No. 32059 was a juvenile.

Empidonax traillii brewsteri Oberholser.--Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) look a Traill Flycatcher
of the subspecies brewsteri at Las Delicias on August 11.

Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) obtained two Least Flycatchers at Las Delicias on August 12.
Dickerman took No. 31470 in pine-oak vegetation.

Empidonax hammondii (Xantus).--Specimen examined: one, sex ? 31657, from the north slope of
Sierra Guadalupe (=11 mi. S, 7 mi. W General Cepeda), 7800 ft., April 20, 1953.

No. 31657 is similar to E. wrightii (Wright's Flycatcher); however, the outmost (tenth) primary
is equal to or slightly larger than the fifth primary. Yet, the underparts of No. 31657 are
darker and more uniform in coloration than those of typical representatives of E. wrightii.
Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:88) stated that Hammond's Flycatcher is "transient"
in Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193-194) reported that E. hammondii was the most prevalent
of the small flycatchers in southeastern Coahuila. They (loc. cit.) obtained specimens of this
flycatcher from the Chorro del Agua and Diamante Pass. Miller (1955a:167) characterized E.
hammondii as a common migrant, "chiefly in stands of low oaks in the pine-oak belt but also
occasionally in the desert scrub" of the Sierra del Carmen.

Empidonax wrightii Baird.--Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) reported one Wright's Flycatcher
from Las Delicias. Miller (1955a:167) stated that this species was a common migrant and occurred
chiefly in the lower oak belt and in the desert scrub. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:34) obtained
specimens of E. wrightii from San Pedro on January 29.

Empidonax griseus Brewster.--Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:34) noted that the Gray Flycatcher
was common "in the San Pedro region" and collected two at San Pedro on January 29. Burleigh
and Lowery (1942:194) collected specimens "near the Chorro del Agua, at Saltillo, and ... in
the open desert some twenty miles west of Saltillo."

Ridgway (1907:576) previously reported the little known and poorly defined Pine Flycatcher
from Sierra Guadalupe. Because of its small size (wing, 75 mm.; tail, 65 mm.), No. 32750 is
referable to E. a. trepidus. No indication of breeding of the subspecies trepidus exists for
Coahuila. Nevertheless, the date (July 6) on which No. 32750 was obtained suggests that this
flycatcher may breed in southeastern Coahuila. According to Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and
Moore (1957:91), this subspecies has been recorded from Sierra Guadalupe. No. 31469 closely
resembles, especially in measurements, the specimens of the Western Flycatcher from the Chisos
Mountains of Texas as reported by Brodkorb (1935:2).

Empidonax difficilis subsp.--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:194) obtained a specimen of E. difficilis
"near the summit of Diamante Pass" that they tentatively identified as E. d. salvini. However,
they considered the specimen as possibly E. d. immemoratus or E. d. occidentalis.

Localities listed by Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:92) of E. d. salvini and E.
d. immemoratus are south of twenty-three degrees north latitude whereas the range of E. d.
occidentalis includes parts of Nuevo León north of twenty-three degrees north latitude (occidentalis
intergrades with hellmayri at Cerro Potosí, Nuevo León, [Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore,
loc. cit.]). Thus, the specimen from Diamante Pass probably is either E. d. hellmayri or E.
d. occidentalis.

**Empidonax fulvifrons pygmaeus Coues.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:95) listed
this subspecies of the Buff-breasted Flycatcher from the Sierra Guadalupe on April 21. This
record represents the eastern limit of the range of E. f. pygmaeus in northeastern México.

**Contopus pertinax pertinax Cabanis and Heine.--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:194) obtained one
female Coues' Flycatcher "in a small gully just below the summit of Diamante Pass."

Contopus virens (Linnaeus).--I judge from the paucity of records in the literature that the
Eastern Wood Pewee is uncommon in Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:194) obtained two males
at the Chorro del Agua, and remarked also that "it is possible that as far west as Saltillo,
this species is a rather uncommon transient." Ridgway (1907:519) listed Contopus virens from
Sabinas.

Specimen No. 31467 of the Western Wood Pewee was obtained in pine and oak vegetation by Dickerman.
Ridgway (1907:523) reported Contopus sordidulus veliei, under the name Myiochanes richardsonii
richardsonii, from Sierra Encarnación. Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) obtained a specimen of
C. sordidulus from Las Delicias. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:83) remarked that
the Western Wood Pewee breeds in the State.

Nuttallornis borealis (Swainson).--Several records of the Olive-sided Flycatcher from Coahuila
are present in the literature. Miller (1955a:167) reported it as a migrant in the desert at
the base of the Sierra del Carmen on April 24. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:82)
reported this species from Ocampo on June 16. Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) obtained one at
Las Delicias on August 16. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:194) collected two males "near the summit
of Diamante Pass" on April 14.

The Vermilion Flycatcher is common in Coahuila. Except in the northwestern part of the State,
the subspecies mexicanus is present throughout Coahuila. The size of No. 32060 (wing, 80 mm.;
tail, 62 mm.) suggests that the specimen is an intergrade between P. r. flammeus and mexicanus.
P. r. flammeus and mexicanus seem to intergrade in northern Coahuila.

Burleigh and Lowery (1942:195) found mexicanus to be "quite plentiful on the plains surrounding
Saltillo." Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:33) noted the Vermilion Flycatcher "near San Pedro."
Cory and Hellmayr (1927:92) listed P. r. mexicanus from Sabinas. The size of the testes (6×4
mm. long) of No. 32060 and the dates (June 19 and 20) on which our specimens were collected
indicate breeding.

Pyrocephalus rubinus flammeus van Rossem.--This subspecies of Vermilion Flycatcher occupies
the northwestern section of Coahuila. Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287) took a specimen of P.
r. flammeus "near Santo Domingo, east of the Del Carmens...." Miller (1955a:167) re-examined
this specimen and stated that "its affinity with the northwest race of the species seems correct
in terms of the characters outlined by van Rossem (1934:353)."

Eremophila alpestris enthymia (Oberholser).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:105)
recorded this subspecies of Horned Lark wintering 4 mi. S Hipólito (November 2 to February
24). They reported also that E. a. enthymia breeds in Coahuila (4 mi. S Hipólito ?).

Burleigh and Lowery (1942:195) wrote that this subspecies of Horned Lark was uncommon "about
Saltillo," but "fairly common" in Diamante Valley, at about 7000 feet. Oberholser (1902:863)
recorded the subspecies aphrasta from La Ventura. Ridgway (1907:326) listed Otocoris alpestris
aphrasta Oberholser from Saltillo and La Ventura. However, Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and
Moore (1957:105) indicated that E. a. diaphora rather than aphrasta was recorded from Saltillo
and La Ventura. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:35) remarked that "specimens collected near Ramos
Arizpe [in southeastern Coahuila]" proved to be E. a. aphrasta. However, this record might
be questioned, as Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (op. cit.) indicated, because diaphora,
rather than aphrasta, seems to occupy the southeastern sector of Coahuila. Possibly typical
representatives of aphrasta and/or intergrades between aphrasta and diaphora are present in
western Coahuila; however, no records of E. a. aphrasta exist from western Coahuila.

The sizes of Nos. 32073-32077 and 31605-31606 (wing, 98.0-101.5 mm., averaging 99.7 mm.), the
bright yellow throat, and the vinaceous color of the hindneck characterize clearly the subspecies
diaphora. The sizes of the testes (9×6 mm.; 8×5 mm.; 10×6 mm.; 8×4 mm.; 11×6 mm.) of Nos. 32073-32077,
the size of the largest ovum (6.5 mm.) of No. 32079, and the juvenile (32078) are evidence
of breeding of E. a. diaphora in Coahuila. Specimens from different localities in the State
represent various stages of intergradation between the two subspecies; generally those from
northern Coahuila seem to be closer to T. t. lepida, and those from southern Coahuila are closer
to T. t. thalassina. Nos. 31471-31473 are intergrades between T. t. thalassina and T. t. lepida;
in size the three resemble T. t. thalassina, but in green, rather than purple, backs and scapulars
resemble T. t. lepida. The rumps of Nos. 31471-31473 show some purple with the green, but are
nearer thalassina in this character.

Gonadal sizes (testes 10×7, 10×8 mm., one ovum 6 mm.) indicate that the Violet-green Swallow
breeds in the Sierra del Pino.

*Tachycineta thalassina lepida Mearns.--Miller (1955a:167) reported that Violet-green Swallows
taken in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra del Carmen are intermediate between T. t. lepida and
thalassina; however, he referred his sample to lepida on the basis of short wing.

Iridoprocne bicolor (Vieillot).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:114) reported
the Tree Swallow from Hipólito on February 22.

Stelgidopteryx ruficollis psammochrous Griscom.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:111)
reported this subspecies of the Rough-winged Swallow from Saltillo.

*Hirundo rustica erythrogaster Boddaert.--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:195) stated that the Barn
Swallow was the most abundant swallow "about Saltillo." Because these swallows occupied houses
about Saltillo and neighboring villages, Burleigh and Lowery (loc. cit.) concluded that the
species nests commonly in the Saltillo area.

*Petrochelidon pyrrhonota minima van Rossem and Hachisuka.--Specimens examined: total 2: [Male]
[Male] 31585-31586 from 14 mi. W San Antonio de las Alazanas, April 9, 1954.

Burleigh and Lowery (1942:196) noted the Cliff Swallow "in small numbers about Saltillo and
the nearby villages" where the species "showed evidence of beginning to nest in many of the
houses...." They (loc. cit.) found Cliff Swallows also at the Chorro del Agua and Diamante
Valley. According to Dickerman, Nos. 31585-31586 were from a colony, members of which were
collecting mud at a stock tank.

*Petrochelidon fulva pallida Nelson.--The Cave Swallow seems to be uncommon in eastern Coahuila.
Selander and Baker (1957:345) list Saltillo, Sabinas, and Monclova as the three known localities
for this swallow in the State.

*Progne subis subis (Linnaeus).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:107) reported,
presumably on the basis of a published record not found by me, that the Purple Martin breeds
in Coahuila.

**Progne chalybea chalybea (Gmelin).--The only record of the Gray-breasted Martin in Coahuila
was given by Ridgway (1904:42) when he listed P. c. chalybea from Sabinas.

From the paucity of records in the literature, I judge that Steller's Jay is uncommon in Coahuila.
Nos. 32787-32788 seemingly represent the first records of this species in the State, and are
referred to the subspecies macrolopha on the basis of relatively long (150, 151 mm.) wing,
near the maximum for stelleri from México. The date (July 6) of collection suggests that these
birds were resident in southeastern Coahuila.

**Aphelocoma coerulescens cyanotis Ridgway.--The Scrub Jay is common in southeastern Coahuila.
Burleigh and Lowery (1942:196) noted this species in small numbers at the summit of Diamante
Pass, daily on the lower slopes of the mountains, and a few birds "on the outskirts of Saltillo,
where they were probably nesting...." Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:35) also noted several flocks
at Diamante Pass. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:123) reported A. c. cyanotis
from El Diamante. Ridgway (1904:335) listed this subspecies of the Scrub Jay (then called Aphelocoma
cyanotis) from Carneros, Sierra Encarnación, and Sierra Guadalupe.

The Mexican Jay is common in Coahuila. This species occupies various habitats in the State
and has been collected at stations ranging from 2100 to 9950 feet.

Miller (1955a:167) stated that the Mexican Jay was the most abundant species of bird in the
Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:196) remarked that specimens of A. u. couchii
were obtained "in the area surrounding the summit of Diamante Pass." At no time did Burleigh
and Lowery (loc. cit.) see this species below 6500 feet. The Mexican Jay is restricted to the
higher altitudes in southern Coahuila but is more widespread in northern Coahuila.
