  Belay, you two lubbers, avast there! avast there!
    What signifies squalling and squabbling?
  You're both argufying a good bit too fast there,
    Whilst that which you stand on seems wobbling.
  You'll be in a mess, Messmates, shortly, the pair of you.
    Give me a thought in the matter!
  My interest's at stake, and it isn't quite fair of you
    Me to ignore 'midst your clatter.

  If 'twere not for me, Mates, this cold Behring's Sea, Mates,
    Would hardly strike you as so tempting.
  Do grant your poor prey, if I may make so free, Mates,
    From slaughter some annual exempting!
  I'm worried and walloped without intermission
    Until even family duties
  Quite fail, whilst your countrymen cudgel and fish on.
    By Jingo, some of 'em are beauties!

  My poor wife and children have not half a chance, Mates.
    That's not to your interest, I reckon.
  Cease shindy, and on a new course make advance, Mates,
    Where sense and humanity beckon.
  There's not much of either in cruelly clubbing
    My progeny all out of season;
  And if you are bent upon mutual drubbing,
    You must quite have parted with reason.

  Mare clausum, be blowed! That's all BLAINE's big bow-wow, Mates.
    Men can't thus monopolise oceans.
  Diplomacy must find a compromise now, Mates,
    And, well--I have told you my notions.
  Give me a close-time,--I shall be very grateful--
    And leave the Sea open! What more, Mates?
  For brothers like you to be huffing, is hateful.
    Be friends, think of me, and--bong swor, Mates!

    [Dives under.

TOO CIVIL BY HALF; OR, PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.

(A DRAMA FOUNDED--MORE OR LESS--UPON FACTS.)

    ACT I.--"PAST."--Interior of the Savings Bank Department of
    the G.P.O. Employés engaged upon their work. The hour for
    customary cessation of labour strikes.

Official of a Higher Grade. Officers and Gentlemen, the exigencies of the Public Service require
your presence for some time longer. I beg you to continue your work.

A Hundred Employés. Never! (Aside.) Ha! ha! the employment of Female Clerks is avenged!

Off. (almost in tears). Reconsider your decision, I beg--I implore!

Another Hundred Employés. Never! (Aside.) Seven hours a day and no longer--shall be secured
at one fell swoop!

Off. (with indescribable emotion). Oh, my country! Oh, my Savings Bank Depositors! Oh, my dignity
of the Civil Service!

    [Faints in the arms of faithful Employés, whilst the other
    Clerks defiantly depart. Tableau.

    ACT II.--"PRESENT."--Magnificent apartments of the
    P.-M.-Gen. in the G.P.O. Deputation of contrite Employés
    listening to the eloquent speech of their Official Chief.

P.M.G. (in effect). I am delighted that you are such good fellows. Your conduct in owning that
you were wrong in refusing to work after regular official hours, almost effaces a painful page
in the history of St. Martin's-le-Grand. Let it be clearly understood that extra work is not
compulsory, but, if not undertaken, may lead (as in the present instance) to immediate suspension,
if not dismissal. Surely no one can object to that? (Contrite Officials express mournful approval.)
And now good-bye, and A Happy New Year. As for the future--hope, my good friends, hope!

    [Exeunt the contrite Employés, leaving the Officials of a
    Higher Grade agitating the nerves controlling their eyelids
    spasmodically.

    ACT III.--"FUTURE."--Same Scene as Act I. Venerable Employés
    discovered, after twenty years' further service.

First Venerable Employé. Remember the words spoken a score of winters ago--Hope, brother, hope!

Second Venerable Employé. Yes--Hope, brother, hope!

    [As the Scene closes, the entire Establishment are left
    continuing the self-sustaining, but rather profitless
    employment, indefinitely. Curtain.

CHARLES KEENE

BORN AUGUST 10, 1823. DIED JANUARY 4, 1891.

  What words avail to honour friends departed,
    Gone from the gatherings which so long they graced?
  What phrase seems fit when comrades loyal-hearted
    Mourn a loved presence late by death displaced?

  No formal elegiacs fashioned coldly,
    Beseem the memory of that manly soul,
  Whose simple, downright spirit trod so boldly
    Life's most sequestered ways from start to goal.

  Not rank's trim pleasaunce, nor parades of fashion
    Tempted his genius; his the great highway
  Where, free from courtly pride and modish passion,
    Toil tramps, free humours crowd, rough wastrels stray.

  Therein his magic pencil laboured gladly,
    Fixing for ever on his chosen page
  In forms fond memory now reviews so sadly
    The crowded pageant of a passing age.

  What an array! How varied a procession!
    The humours of the parlour, shop, and street;
  Philistia's every calling, craft, profession,
    Cockneydom's cheery cheek and patter fleet.
