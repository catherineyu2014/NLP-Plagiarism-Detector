  "No fears hath she! Her giant form
    Majestically calm would go
  O'er wrathful surge, through blackening storm,
    'Mid he deep darkness, white as snow!
  So stately her bearing, so proud her array,
  The main she will traverse forever and aye!
  Many ports shall exult in the gleam of her mast--
  Hush! hush! Thou vain dreamer, this hour is her last!"

THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.

A DOUBLE WEDDING; or, How She Was Won.

HESTER HOWARD'S TEMPTATION.

From Gail Hamilton, author of "Gala Days" etc.

"'The Household of Bouverie' is one of those books that pluck out all your teeth, and then
dare you to bite them. Your interest is awakened at once in the first chapter, and you are
whirled through in a lightning-express train that leaves you no opportunity to look at the
little details of wood, and lawn, and river. You notice two or three little peculiarities of
style--one or two 'bits' of painting--and then you pull on your seven-leagued boots and away
you go."

From George Ripley's Review of "The Household of Bouverie" in Harper's Magazine.

"'The Household of Bouverie,' by Mrs. Warfield, is a wonderful book. I have read it twice--the
second time more carefully than the first--and I use the term 'wonderful,' because it best
expresses the feeling uppermost in my mind, both while reading and thinking it over. As a piece
of imaginative writing, I have seen nothing to equal it since the days of Edgar A. Poe, and
I doubt whether he could have sustained himself and the readers through a book half the size
of the 'Household of Bouverie.' I have literally hurried through it by my intense sympathy,
my devouring curiosity--It was more than interest. I read everywhere--between the courses of
the hotel-table, on the boat, in the cars--until I had swallowed the last line. This is no
common occurrence with a veteran romance reader like myself."

  WILSON, "Isle of Palms."

       *       *       *       *       *

              "Then hold her
  Strictly confined in sombre banishment,
  And Doubt not but she will ere long, full gladly,
  Her freedom purchase at the price you name."

       *       *       *       *       *

              "No, subtle snake!
  It is the baseness of thy selfish mind,
  Full of all guile, and cunning, and deceit,
  That severs us so far, and shall do ever."

       *       *       *       *       *

  "Despair shall give me strength--where is the door?
  Mine eyes are dark! I cannot find it now.
  O God! protect me in this awful pass!"

  JOANNA BAILLIE, Tragedy of "Orra."

AUTHOR OF "THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE."

CHAPTER I.

It was a calm and hazy morning of Southern summer that on which I turned my face seaward from
the "keep" of Beauseincourt, never, I knew, to see its time-stained walls again, save through
the mirage of memory. There is an awe almost as solemn to me in a consciousness like this as
that which attends the death-bed parting, and my straining eye takes in its last look of a
familiar scene as it might do the ever-to-be-averted face of friendship.
