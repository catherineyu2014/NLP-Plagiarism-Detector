BEGINNING OF THE JOURNEY

CHAPTER I

DEATH OF THE REV. CHARLES CARDINAL

Death leapt upon the Rev. Charles Cardinal, Rector of St. Dreots in South Glebeshire, at the
moment that he bent down towards the second long drawer of his washhand-stand; he bent down
to find a clean collar. It is in its way a symbol of his whole life, that death claimed him
before he could find one.

At one moment his mind was intent upon his collar; at the next he was stricken with a wild
surmise, a terror that even at that instant he would persuade himself was exaggerated. He saw
before his clouding eyes a black pit. A strong hand striking him in the middle of his back
flung him contemptuously forward into it; a gasping cry of protest and all was over. Had time
been permitted him he would have stretched out a hand towards the shabby black box that, true
to all miserly convention, occupied the space beneath his bed. Time was not allowed him. He
might take with him into the darkness neither money nor clean clothing.

He had been told on many occasions about his heart, that he must not excite nor strain it.
He allowed that to pass as he allowed many other things because his imagination was fixed upon
one ambition, and one alone. He had made, upon this last and fatal occasion, haste to find
his collar because the bell had begun its Evensong clatter and he did not wish to-night to
be late. The bell continued to ring and he lay his broad widespread length upon the floor.
He was a large and dirty man.

The shabby old house was occupied with its customary life. Down in the kitchen Ellen the cook
was snatching a moment from her labours to drink a cup of tea. She sat at the deal table, her
full bosom pressed by the boards, her saucer balanced on her hand; she blew, with little heaving
pants, at her tea to cool it. Her thoughts were with a new hat and some red roses with which
she would trim it; she looked out with little shivers of content at the falling winter's dusk:
Anne the kitchen-maid scoured the pans; her bony frame seemed to rattle as she scrubbed with
her red hands; she was happy because she was hungry and there would be a beef-steak pudding
for dinner. She sang to herself as she worked.

Upstairs in the dining-room Maggie Cardinal, the only child of the Rev. Charles, sat sewing.
She hoard the jangling of the church hell; she heard also, suddenly, with a surprise that made
her heart beat for a moment with furious leaps, a tapping on the window-pane. Then directly
after that she fancied that there came from her father's room above the thud of some sudden
fall or collapse. She listened. The bell swallowed all other noise. She thought that she had
been mistaken, but the tapping at the window began again, now insistent; the church bell suddenly
stopped and in the silence that followed one could hear the slight creak of some bough driven
by the sea-wind against the wall.
