PREFACE

In offering the American public a carefully studied outline of its national park system, I
have two principal objects. The one is to describe and differentiate the national parks in
a manner which will enable the reader to appreciate their importance, scope, meaning, beauty,
manifold uses and enormous value to individual and nation. The other is to use these parks,
in which Nature is writing in large plain lines the story of America's making, as examples
illustrating the several kinds of scenery, and what each kind means in terms of world building;
in other words, to translate the practical findings of science into unscientific phrase for
the reader's increased profit and pleasure, not only in his national parks but in all other
scenic places great and small.

At the outset I have been confronted with a difficulty because of this double objective. The
rôle of the interpreter is not always welcome. If I write what is vaguely known as a "popular"
book, wise men have warned me that any scientific intrusion, however lightly and dramatically
rendered, will displease its natural audience. If I write the simplest of scientific books,
I am warned that a large body of warm-blooded, wholesome, enthusiastic Americans, the very
ones above all others whose keen enjoyment I want to double by doubling their sources of pleasure,
will have none of it. The suggestion that I make my text "popular" and carry my "science" in
an appendix I promptly rejected, for if I cannot give the scientific aspects of nature their
readable values in the text, I cannot make them worth an appendix.

Now I fail to share with my advisers their poor opinion of the taste, enterprise, and intelligence
of the wide-awake American, but, for the sake of my message, I yield in some part to their
warnings. Therefore I have so presented my material that the miscalled, and, I verily believe,
badly slandered "average reader," may have his "popular" book by omitting the note on the Appreciation
of Scenery, and the several notes explanatory of scenery which are interpolated between groups
of chapters. If it is true, as I have been told, that the "average reader" would omit these
anyway, because it is his habit to omit prefaces and notes of every kind, then nothing has
been lost.

The keen inquiring reader, however, the reader who wants to know values and to get, in the
eloquent phrase of the day, all that's coming to him, will have the whole story by beginning
the book with the note on the Appreciation of Scenery, and reading it consecutively, interpolated
notes and all. As this will involve less than a score of additional pages, I hope to get the
message of the national parks in terms of their fullest enjoyment before much the greater part
of the book's readers.

The pleasure of writing this book has many times repaid its cost in labor, and any helpfulness
it may have in advancing the popularity of our national parks, in building up the system's
worth as a national economic asset, and in increasing the people's pleasure in all scenery
by helping them to appreciate their greatest scenery, will come to me as pure profit. It is
my earnest hope that this profit may be large.

A similar spirit has actuated the very many who have helped me acquire the knowledge and experience
to produce it; the officials of the National Park Service, the superintendents and several
rangers in the national parks, certain zoologists of the United States Biological Survey, the
Director and many geologists of the United States Geological Survey, scientific experts of
the Smithsonian Institution, and professors in several distinguished universities. Many men
have been patient and untiring in assistance and helpful criticism, and to these I render warm
thanks for myself and for readers who may benefit by their work.

The Book of the National Parks

ON THE APPRECIATION OF SCENERY

To the average educated American, scenery is a pleasing hodge-podge of mountains, valleys,
plains, lakes, and rivers. To him, the glacier-hollowed valley of Yosemite, the stream-scooped
abyss of the Grand Canyon, the volcanic gulf of Crater Lake, the bristling granite core of
the Rockies, and the ancient ice-carved shales of Glacier National Park all are one--just scenery,
magnificent, incomparable, meaningless. As a people we have been content to wonder, not to
know; yet with scenery, as with all else, to know is to begin fully to enjoy. Appreciation
measures enjoyment. And this brings me to my proposition, namely, that we shall not really
enjoy our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until we realize that scenery is
the written page of the History of Creation, and until we learn to read that page.

The national parks of America include areas of the noblest and most diversified scenic sublimity
easily accessible in the world; nevertheless it is their chiefest glory that they are among
the completest expressions of the earth's history. The American people is waking rapidly to
the magnitude of its scenic possession; it has yet to learn to appreciate it.

Nevertheless we love scenery. We are a nation of sightseers. The year before the world war
stopped all things, we spent $286,000,000 in going to Europe. That summer Switzerland's receipts
from the sale of transportation and board to persons coming from foreign lands to see her scenery
was $100,000,000, and more than half, it has been stated apparently with authority, came from
America. That same year tourist travel became Canada's fourth largest source of income, exceeding
in gross receipts even her fisheries, and the greater part came from the United States; it
is a matter of record that seven-tenths of the hotel registrations in the Canadian Rockies
were from south of the border. Had we then known, as a nation, that there was just as good
scenery of its kind in the United States, and many more kinds, we would have gone to see that;
it is a national trait to buy the best. Since then, we have discovered this important fact
and are crowding to our national parks.

"Is it true," a woman asked me at the foot of Yosemite Falls, "that this is the highest unbroken
waterfall in the world?"

She was the average tourist, met there by chance. I assured her that such was the fact. I called
attention to the apparent deliberation of the water's fall, a trick of the senses resulting
from failure to realize height and distance.

"To think they are the highest in the world!" she mused.

I told her that the soft fingers of water had carved this valley three thousand feet into the
solid granite, and that ice had polished its walls, and I estimated for her the ages since
the Merced River flowed at the level of the cataract's brink.

"I've seen the tallest building in the world," she replied dreamily, "and the longest railroad,
and the largest lake, and the highest monument, and the biggest department store, and now I
see the highest waterfall. Just think of it!"

If one has illusions concerning the average tourist, let him compare the hundreds who gape
at the paint pots and geysers of Yellowstone with the dozens who exult in the sublimated glory
of the colorful canyon. Or let him listen to the table-talk of a party returned from Crater
Lake. Or let him recall the statistical superlatives which made up his friend's last letter
from the Grand Canyon.

I am not condemning wonder, which, in its place, is a legitimate and pleasurable emotion. As
a condiment to sharpen and accent an abounding sense of beauty it has real and abiding value.

Love of beauty is practically a universal passion. It is that which lures millions into the
fields, valleys, woods, and mountains on every holiday, which crowds our ocean lanes and railroads.
The fact that few of these rejoicing millions are aware of their own motive, and that, strangely
enough, a few even would be ashamed to make the admission if they became aware of it, has nothing
to do with the fact. It's a wise man that knows his own motives. The fact that still fewer,
whether aware or not of the reason of their happiness, are capable of making the least expression
of it, also has nothing to do with the fact. The tourist woman whom I met at the foot of Yosemite
Falls may have felt secretly suffocated by the filmy grandeur of the incomparable spectacle,
notwithstanding that she was conscious of no higher emotion than the cheap wonder of a superlative.
The Grand Canyon's rim is the stillest crowded place I know. I've stood among a hundred people
on a precipice and heard the whir of a bird's wings in the abyss. Probably the majority of
those silent gazers were suffering something akin to pain at their inability to give vent to
the emotions bursting within them.

I believe that the statement can not be successfully challenged that, as a people, our enjoyment
of scenery is almost wholly emotional. Love of beauty spiced by wonder is the equipment for
enjoyment of the average intelligent traveller of to-day. Now add to this a more or less equal
part of the intellectual pleasure of comprehension and you have the equipment of the average
intelligent traveller of to-morrow. To hasten this to-morrow is one of the several objects
of this book.

To see in the carved and colorful depths of the Grand Canyon not only the stupendous abyss
whose terrible beauty grips the soul, but also to-day's chapter in a thrilling story of creation
whose beginning lay untold centuries back in the ages, whose scene covers three hundred thousand
square miles of our wonderful southwest, whose actors include the greatest forces of nature,
whose tremendous episodes shame the imagination of Doré, and whose logical end invites suggestions
before which finite minds shrink--this is to come into the presence of the great spectacle
properly equipped for its enjoyment. But how many who see the Grand Canyon get more out of
it than merely the beauty that grips the soul?

So it is throughout the world of scenery. The geologic story written on the cliffs of Crater
Lake is more stupendous even than the glory of its indigo bowl. The war of titanic forces described
in simple language on the rocks of Glacier National Park is unexcelled in sublimity in the
history of mankind. The story of Yellowstone's making multiplies many times the thrill occasioned
by its world-famed spectacle. Even the simplest and smallest rock details often tell thrilling
incidents of prehistoric tunes out of which the enlightened imagination reconstructs the romances
and the tragedies of earth's earlier days.

How eloquent, for example, was the small, water-worn fragment of dull coal we found on the
limestone slope of one of Glacier's mountains! Impossible companionship! The one the product
of forest, the other of submerged depths. Instantly I glimpsed the distant age when thousands
of feet above the very spot upon which I stood, but then at sea level, bloomed a Cretaceous
forest, whose broken trunks and matted foliage decayed in bogs where they slowly turned to
coal; coal which, exposed and disintegrated during intervening ages, has long since--all but
a few small fragments like this--washed into the headwaters of the Saskatchewan to merge eventually
in the muds of Hudson Bay. And then, still dreaming, my mind leaped millions of years still
further back to lake bottoms where, ten thousand feet below the spot on which I stood, gathered
the pre-Cambrian ooze which later hardened to this very limestone. From ooze a score of thousand
feet, a hundred million years, to coal! And both lie here together now in my palm! Filled thus
with visions of a perspective beyond human comprehension, with what multiplied intensity of
interest I now returned to the noble view from Gable Mountain!

In pleading for a higher understanding of Nature's method and accomplishment as a precedent
to study and observation of our national parks, I seek enormously to enrich the enjoyment not
only of these supreme examples but of all examples of world making. The same readings which
will prepare you to enjoy to the full the message of our national parks will invest your neighborhood
hills at home, your creek and river and prairie, your vacation valleys, the landscape through
your car window, even your wayside ditch, with living interest. I invite you to a new and fascinating
earth, an earth interesting, vital, personal, beloved, because at last known and understood!

It requires no great study to know and understand the earth well enough for such purpose as
this. One does not have to dim his eyes with acres of maps, or become a plodding geologist,
or learn to distinguish schists from granites, or to classify plants by table, or to call wild
geese and marmots by their Latin names. It is true that geography, geology, physiography, mineralogy,
botany and zoology must each contribute their share toward the condition of intelligence which
will enable you to realize appreciation of Nature's amazing earth, but the share of each is
so small that the problem will be solved, not by exhaustive study, but by the selection of
essential parts. Two or three popular books which interpret natural science in perspective
should pleasurably accomplish your purpose. But once begun, I predict that few will fail to
carry certain subjects beyond the mere essentials, while some will enter for life into a land
of new delights.

Let us, for illustration, consider for a moment the making of America. The earth, composed
of countless aggregations of matter drawn together from the skies, whirled into a globe, settled
into a solid mass surrounded by an atmosphere carrying water like a sponge, has reached the
stage of development when land and sea have divided the surface between them, and successions
of heat and frost, snow, ice, rain, and flood, are busy with their ceaseless carving of the
land. Already mountains are wearing down and sea bottoms are building up with their refuse.
Sediments carried by the rivers are depositing in strata, which some day will harden into rock.
