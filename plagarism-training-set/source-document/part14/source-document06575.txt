A vast generalization such as this is never a mushroom growth, nor does it usually spring full
grown from the mind of any single man. Always a number of minds are very near a truth before
any one mind fully grasps it. Pre-eminently true is this of the doctrine of the conservation
of energy. Not Faraday alone, but half a dozen different men had an inkling of it before it
gained full expression; indeed, every man who advocated the undulatory theory of light and
heat was verging towards the goal. The doctrine of Young and Fresnel was as a highway leading
surely on to the wide plain of conservation. The phenomena of electro-magnetism furnished another
such highway. But there was yet another road which led just as surely and even more readily
to the same goal. This was the road furnished by the phenomena of heat, and the men who travelled
it were destined to outstrip their fellow-workers; though, as we have seen, wayfarers on other
roads were within hailing distance when the leaders passed the mark.

In order to do even approximate justice to the men who entered into the great achievement,
we must recall that just at the close of the eighteenth century Count Rumford and Humphry Davy
independently showed that labor may be transformed into heat; and correctly interpreted this
fact as meaning the transformation of molar into molecular motion. We can hardly doubt that
each of these men of genius realized--vaguely, at any rate--that there must be a close correspondence
between the amount of the molar and the molecular motions; hence that each of them was in sight
of the law of the mechanical equivalent of heat. But neither of them quite grasped or explicitly
stated what each must vaguely have seen; and for just a quarter of a century no one else even
came abreast their line of thought, let alone passing it. Carnot did not, indeed, reach the
clear view of his predecessors as to the nature of heat, for he still thought it a form of
"imponderable" fluid; but he reasoned none the less clearly as to its mutual convertibility
with mechanical work. But important as his conclusions seem now that we look back upon them
with clearer vision, they made no impression whatever upon his contemporaries. Carnot's work
in this line was an isolated phenomenon of historical interest, but it did not enter into the
scheme of the completed narrative in any such way as did the work of Rumford and Davy.

The man who really took up the broken thread where Rumford and Davy had dropped it, and wove
it into a completed texture, came upon the scene in 1840. His home was in Manchester, England;
his occupation that of a manufacturer. He was a friend and pupil of the great Dr. Dalton. His
name was James Prescott Joule. When posterity has done its final juggling with the names of
the nineteenth century, it is not unlikely that the name of this Manchester philosopher will
be a household word, like the names of Aristotle, Copernicus, and Newton.

For Joule's work it was, done in the fifth decade of the century, which demonstrated beyond
all cavil that there is a precise and absolute equivalence between mechanical work and heat;
that whatever the form of manifestation of molar motion, it can generate a definite and measurable
amount of heat, and no more. Joule found, for example, that at the sea-level in Manchester
a pound weight falling through seven hundred and seventy-two feet could generate enough heat
to raise the temperature of a pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. There was nothing haphazard,
nothing accidental, about this; it bore the stamp of unalterable law. And Joule himself saw,
what others in time were made to see, that this truth is merely a particular case within a
more general law. If heat cannot be in any sense created, but only made manifest as a transformation
of another kind of motion, then must not the same thing be true of all those other forms of
"force"--light, electricity, magnetism--which had been shown to be so closely associated, so
mutually convertible, with heat? All analogy seemed to urge the truth of this inference; all
experiment tended to confirm it. The law of the mechanical equivalent of heat then became the
main corner-stone of the greater law of the conservation of energy.

But while this citation is fresh in mind, we must turn our attention with all haste to a country
across the Channel--to Denmark, in short--and learn that even as Joule experimented with the
transformation of heat, a philosopher of Copenhagen, Colding by name, had hit upon the same
idea, and carried it far towards a demonstration. And then, without pausing, we must shift
yet again, this time to Germany, and consider the work of three other men, who independently
were on the track of the same truth, and two of whom, it must be admitted, reached it earlier
than either Joule or Colding, if neither brought it to quite so clear a demonstration. The
names of these three Germans are Mohr, Mayer, and Helmholtz. Their share in establishing the
great doctrine of conservation must now claim our attention.

As to Karl Friedrich Mohr, it may be said that his statement of the doctrine preceded that
of any of his fellows, yet that otherwise it was perhaps least important. In 1837 this thoughtful
German had grasped the main truth, and given it expression in an article published in the Zeitschrift
fur Physik, etc. But the article attracted no attention whatever, even from Mohr's own countrymen.
Still, Mohr's title to rank as one who independently conceived the great truth, and perhaps
conceived it before any other man in the world saw it as clearly, even though he did not demonstrate
its validity, is not to be disputed. Two years earlier Dr. Mayer, while surgeon to a Dutch
India vessel cruising in the tropics, had observed that the venous blood of a patient seemed
redder than venous blood usually is observed to be in temperate climates. He pondered over
this seemingly insignificant fact, and at last reached the conclusion that the cause must be
the lesser amount of oxidation required to keep up the body temperature in the tropics. Led
by this reflection to consider the body as a machine dependent on outside forces for its capacity
to act, he passed on into a novel realm of thought, which brought him at last to independent
discovery of the mechanical theory of heat, and to the first full and comprehensive appreciation
of the great law of conservation. Blood-letting, the modern physician holds, was a practice
of very doubtful benefit, as a rule, to the subject; but once, at least, it led to marvellous
results. No straw is go small that it may not point the receptive mind of genius to new and
wonderful truths.

MAYER'S PAPER OF 1842

The paper in which Mayer first gave expression to his revolutionary ideas bore the title of
"The Forces of Inorganic Nature," and was published in 1842. It is one of the gems of scientific
literature, and fortunately it is not too long to be quoted in its entirety. Seldom if ever
was a great revolutionary doctrine expounded in briefer compass:

"What are we to understand by 'forces'? and how are different forces related to each other?
The term force conveys for the most part the idea of something unknown, unsearchable, and hypothetical;
while the term matter, on the other hand, implies the possession, by the object in question,
of such definite properties as weight and extension. An attempt, therefore, to render the idea
of force equally exact with that of matter is one which should be welcomed by all those who
desire to have their views of nature clear and unencumbered by hypothesis.

"Forces are causes; and accordingly we may make full application in relation to them of the
principle causa aequat effectum. If the cause c has the effect e, then c = e; if, in its turn,
e is the cause of a second effect of f, we have e = f, and so on: c = e = f... = c. In a series
of causes and effects, a term or a part of a term can never, as is apparent from the nature
of an equation, become equal to nothing. This first property of all causes we call their indestructibility.

"If the given cause c has produced an effect e equal to itself, it has in that very act ceased
to be--c has become e. If, after the production of e, c still remained in the whole or in part,
there must be still further effects corresponding to this remaining cause: the total effect
of c would thus be > e, which would be contrary to the supposition c = e. Accordingly, since
c becomes e, and e becomes f, etc., we must regard these various magnitudes as different forms
under which one and the same object makes its appearance. This capability of assuming various
forms is the second essential property of all causes. Taking both properties together, we may
say, causes an INDESTRUCTIBLE quantitatively, and quantitatively CONVERTIBLE objects.

"There occur in nature two causes which apparently never pass one into the other," said Mayer.
"The first class consists of such causes as possess the properties of weight and impenetrability.
These are kinds of matter. The other class is composed of causes which are wanting in the properties
just mentioned--namely, forces, called also imponderables, from the negative property that
has been indicated. Forces are therefore INDESTRUCTIBLE, CONVERTIBLE, IMPONDERABLE OBJECTS.

"As an example of causes and effects, take matter: explosive gas, H + O, and water, HO, are
related to each other as cause and effect; therefore H + O = HO. But if H + O becomes HO, heat,
cal., makes its appearance as well as water; this heat must likewise have a cause, x, and we
have therefore H + O + X = HO + cal. It might be asked, however, whether H + O is really =
HO, and x = cal., and not perhaps H + O = cal., and x = HO, whence the above equation could
equally be deduced; and so in many other cases. The phlogistic chemists recognized the equation
between cal. and x, or phlogiston as they called it, and in so doing made a great step in advance;
but they involved themselves again in a system of mistakes by putting x in place of O. In this
way they obtained H = HO + x.

"Chemistry teaches us that matter, as a cause, has matter for its effect; but we may say with
equal justification that to force as a cause corresponds force as effect. Since c = e, and
e = c, it is natural to call one term of an equation a force, and the other an effect of force,
or phenomenon, and to attach different notions to the expression force and phenomenon. In brief,
then, if the cause is matter, the effect is matter; if the cause is a force, the effect is
also a force.

"The cause that brings about the raising of a weight is a force. The effect of the raised weight
is, therefore, also a force; or, expressed in a more general form, SEPARATION IN SPACE OF PONDERABLE
OBJECTS IS A FORCE; and since this force causes the fall of bodies, we call it FALLING FORCE.
Falling force and fall, or, still more generally, falling force and motion, are forces related
to each other as cause and effect--forces convertible into each other--two different forms
of one and the same object. For example, a weight resting on the ground is not a force: it
is neither the cause of motion nor of the lifting of another weight. It becomes so, however,
in proportion as it is raised above the ground. The cause--that is, the distance between a
weight and the earth, and the effect, or the quantity of motion produced, bear to each other,
as shown by mechanics, a constant relation.

"Gravity being regarded as the cause of the falling of bodies, a gravitating force is spoken
of; and thus the ideas of PROPERTY and of FORCE are confounded with each other. If gravity
be called a force, a cause is supposed which produces effects without itself diminishing, and
incorrect conceptions of the causal connections of things are thereby fostered. In order that
a body may fall, it is just as necessary that it be lifted up as that it should be heavy or
possess gravity. The fall of bodies, therefore, ought not to be ascribed to their gravity alone.
The problem of mechanics is to develop the equations which subsist between falling force and
motion, motion and falling force, and between different motions. Here is a case in point: The
magnitude of the falling force v is directly proportional (the earth's radius being assumed--oo)
to the magnitude of the mass m, and the height d, to which it is raised--that is, v = md. If
the height d = l, to which the mass m is raised, is transformed into the final velocity c =
l of this mass, we have also v = mc; but from the known relations existing between d and c,
it results that, for other values of d or of c, the measure of the force v is mc squared; accordingly
v = md = mcsquared. The law of the conservation of vis viva is thus found to be based on the
general law of the indestructibility of causes.

"In many cases we see motion cease without having caused another motion or the lifting of a
weight. But a force once in existence cannot be annihilated--it can only change its form. And
the question therefore arises, what other forms is force, which we have become acquainted with
as falling force and motion, capable of assuming? Experience alone can lead us to a conclusion
on this point. That we may experiment to advantage, we must select implements which, besides
causing a real cessation of motion, are as little as possible altered by the objects to be
examined. For example, if we rub together two metal plates, we see motion disappear, and heat,
on the other hand, make its appearance, and there remains to be determined only whether MOTION
is the cause of heat. In order to reach a decision on this point, we must discuss the question
whether, in the numberless cases in which the expenditure of motion is accompanied by the appearance
of heat, the motion has not some other effect than the production of heat, and the heat some
other cause than the motion.

"A serious attempt to ascertain the effects of ceasing motion has never been made. Without
wishing to exclude a priori the hypothesis which it may be possible to establish, therefore,
we observe only that, as a rule, this effect cannot be supposed to be an alteration in the
state of aggregation of the moved (that is, rubbing, etc.) bodies. If we assume that a certain
quantity of motion v is expended in the conversion of a rubbing substance m into n, we must
then have m + v - n, and n = m + v; and when n is reconverted into m, v must appear again in
some form or other.

"By the friction of two metallic plates continued for a very long time, we can gradually cause
the cessation of an immense quantity of movement; but would it ever occur to us to look for
even the smallest trace of the force which has disappeared in the metallic dust that we could
collect, and to try to regain it thence? We repeat, the motion cannot have been annihilated;
and contrary, or positive and negative, motions cannot be regarded as = o any more than contrary
motions can come out of nothing, or a weight can raise itself.

"Without the recognition of a causal relation between motion and heat, it is just as difficult
to explain the production of heat as it is to give any account of the motion that disappears.
The heat cannot be derived from the diminution of the volume of the rubbing substances. It
is well known that two pieces of ice may be melted by rubbing them together in vacuo; but let
any one try to convert ice into water by pressure, however enormous. The author has found that
water undergoes a rise of temperature when shaken violently. The water so heated (from twelve
to thirteen degrees centigrade) has a greater bulk after being shaken than it had before. Whence
now comes this quantity of heat, which by repeated shaking may be called into existence in
the same apparatus as often as we please? The vibratory hypothesis of heat is an approach towards
the doctrine of heat being the effect of motion, but it does not favor the admission of this
causal relation in its full generality. It rather lays the chief stress on restless oscillations.

"If it be considered as now established that in many cases no other effect of motion can be
traced except heat, and that no other cause than motion can be found for the heat that is produced,
we prefer the assumption that heat proceeds from motion to the assumption of a cause without
effect and of an effect without a cause. Just as the chemist, instead of allowing oxygen and
hydrogen to disappear without further investigation, and water to be produced in some inexplicable
manner, establishes a connection between oxygen and hydrogen on the one hand, and water on
the other.

"We may conceive the natural connection existing between falling force, motion, and heat as
follows: We know that heat makes its appearance when the separate particles of a body approach
nearer to each other; condensation produces heat. And what applies to the smallest particles
of matter, and the smallest intervals between them, must also apply to large masses and to
measurable distances. The falling of a weight is a diminution of the bulk of the earth, and
must therefore without doubt be related to the quantity of heat thereby developed; this quantity
of heat must be proportional to the greatness of the weight and its distance from the ground.
From this point of view we are easily led to the equations between falling force, motion, and
heat that have already been discussed.

"But just as little as the connection between falling force and motion authorizes the conclusion
that the essence of falling force is motion, can such a conclusion be adopted in the case of
heat. We are, on the contrary, rather inclined to infer that, before it can become heat, motion
must cease to exist as motion, whether simple, or vibratory, as in the case of light and radiant
heat, etc.

"If falling force and motion are equivalent to heat, heat must also naturally be equivalent
to motion and falling force. Just as heat appears as an EFFECT of the diminution of bulk and
of the cessation of motion, so also does heat disappear as a CAUSE when its effects are produced
in the shape of motion, expansion, or raising of weight.

"In water-mills the continual diminution in bulk which the earth undergoes, owing to the fall
of the water, gives rise to motion, which afterwards disappears again, calling forth unceasingly
a great quantity of heat; and, inversely, the steam-engine serves to decompose heat again into
motion or the raising of weights. A locomotive with its train may be compared to a distilling
apparatus; the heat applied under the boiler passes off as motion, and this is deposited again
as heat at the axles of the wheels."

Mayer then closes his paper with the following deduction: "The solution of the equations subsisting
between falling force and motion requires that the space fallen through in a given time--e.
g., the first second--should be experimentally determined. In like manner, the solution of
the equations subsisting between falling force and motion on the one hand and heat on the other
requires an answer to the question, How great is the quantity of heat which corresponds to
a given quantity of motion or falling force? For instance, we must ascertain how high a given
weight requires to be raised above the ground in order that its falling force maybe equivalent
to the raising of the temperature of an equal weight of water from 0 degrees to 1 degrees centigrade.
The attempt to show that such an equation is the expression of a physical truth may be regarded
as the substance of the foregoing remarks.

"By applying the principles that have been set forth to the relations
subsisting between the temperature and the volume of gases, we find
that the sinking of a mercury column by which a gas is compressed is
equivalent to the quantity of heat set free by the compression; and
hence it follows, the ratio between the capacity for heat of air under
constant pressure and its capacity under constant volume being taken as
= 1.421, that the warming of a given weight of water from 0 degrees to
 equal weight from the height of about three hundred and sixty-five
metres. If we compare with this result the working of our best
steam-engines, we see how small a part only of the heat applied under
the boiler is really transformed into motion or the raising of weights;
and this may serve as justification for the attempts at the profitable
production of motion by some other method than the expenditure of the
chemical difference between carbon and oxygen--more particularly by
the transformation into motion of electricity obtained by chemical
means."(1)

MAYER AND HELMHOLTZ

Here, then, was this obscure German physician, leading the humdrum life of a village practitioner,
yet seeing such visions as no human being in the world had ever seen before.

The great principle he had discovered became the dominating thought of his life, and filled
all his leisure hours. He applied it far and wide, amid all the phenomena of the inorganic
and organic worlds. It taught him that both vegetables and animals are machines, bound by the
same laws that hold sway over inorganic matter, transforming energy, but creating nothing.
Then his mind reached out into space and met a universe made up of questions. Each star that
blinked down at him as he rode in answer to a night-call seemed an interrogation-point asking,
How do I exist? Why have I not long since burned out if your theory of conservation be true?
No one had hitherto even tried to answer that question; few had so much as realized that it
demanded an answer. But the Heilbronn physician understood the question and found an answer.
His meteoric hypothesis, published in 1848, gave for the first time a tenable explanation of
the persistent light and heat of our sun and the myriad other suns--an explanation to which
we shall recur in another connection.

All this time our isolated philosopher, his brain aflame with the glow of creative thought,
was quite unaware that any one else in the world was working along the same lines. And the
outside world was equally heedless of the work of the Heilbronn physician. There was no friend
to inspire enthusiasm and give courage, no kindred spirit to react on this masterful but lonely
mind. And this is the more remarkable because there are few other cases where a master-originator
in science has come upon the scene except as the pupil or friend of some other master-originator.
Of the men we have noticed in the present connection, Young was the friend and confrere of
Davy; Davy, the protege of Rumford; Faraday, the pupil of Davy; Fresnel, the co-worker with
Arago; Colding, the confrere of Oersted; Joule, the pupil of Dalton. But Mayer is an isolated
phenomenon--one of the lone mountain-peak intellects of the century. That estimate may be exaggerated
which has called him the Galileo of the nineteenth century, but surely no lukewarm praise can
do him justice.

Yet for a long time his work attracted no attention whatever. In 1847, when another German
physician, Hermann von Helmholtz, one of the most massive and towering intellects of any age,
had been independently led to comprehension of the doctrine of the conservation of energy and
published his treatise on the subject, he had hardly heard of his countryman Mayer. When he
did hear of him, however, he hastened to renounce all claim to the doctrine of conservation,
though the world at large gives him credit of independent even though subsequent discovery.

JOULE'S PAPER OF 1843

Meantime, in England, Joule was going on from one experimental demonstration to another, oblivious
of his German competitors and almost as little noticed by his own countrymen. He read his first
paper before the chemical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
in 1843, and no one heeded it in the least. It is well worth our while, however, to consider
it at length. It bears the title, "On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity, and the
Mechanical Value of Heat." The full text, as published in the Report of the British Association,
is as follows:

"Although it has been long known that fine platinum wire can be ignited by magneto-electricity,
it still remained a matter of doubt whether heat was evolved by the COILS in which the magneto-electricity
was generated; and it seemed indeed not unreasonable to suppose that COLD was produced there
in order to make up for the heat evolved by the other part of the circuit. The author therefore
has endeavored to clear up this uncertainty by experiment. His apparatus consisted of a small
compound electro-magnet, immersed in water, revolving between the poles of a powerful stationary
magnet. The magneto-electricity developed in the coils of the revolving electro-magnet was
measured by an accurate galvanometer; and the temperature of the water was taken before and
after each experiment by a very delicate thermometer. The influence of the temperature of the
surrounding atmospheric air was guarded against by covering the revolving tube with flannel,
etc., and by the adoption of a system of interpolation. By an extensive series of experiments
with the above apparatus the author succeeded in proving that heat is evolved by the coils
of the magneto-electrical machine, as well as by any other part of the circuit, in proportion
to the resistance to conduction of the wire and the square of the current; the magneto having,
under comparable circumstances, the same calorific power as the voltaic electricity.

"Professor Jacobi, of St. Petersburg, bad shown that the motion of an electro-magnetic machine
generates magneto-electricity in opposition to the voltaic current of the battery. The author
had observed the same phenomenon on arranging his apparatus as an electro-magnetic machine;
but had found that no additional heat was evolved on account of the conflict of forces in the
coil of the electro-magnet, and that the heat evolved by the coil remained, as before, proportional
to the square of the current. Again, by turning the machine contrary to the direction of the
attractive forces, so as to increase the intensity of the voltaic current by the assistance
of the magneto-electricity, he found that the evolution of heat was still proportional to the
square of the current. The author discovered, therefore, that the heat evolved by the voltaic
current is invariably proportional to the square of the current, however the intensity of the
current may be varied by magnetic induction. But Dr. Faraday has shown that the chemical effects
of the current are simply as its quantity. Therefore he concluded that in the electro-magnetic
engine a part of the heat due to the chemical actions of the battery is lost by the circuit,
and converted into mechanical power; and that when the electro-magnetic engine is turned CONTRARY
to the direction of the attractive forces, a greater quantity of heat is evolved by the circuit
than is due to the chemical reactions of the battery, the over-plus quantity being produced
by the conversion of the mechanical force exerted in turning the machine. By a dynamometrical
apparatus attached to his machine, the author has ascertained that, in all the above cases,
a quantity of heat, capable of increasing the temperature of a pound of water by one degree
of Fahrenheit's scale, is equal to the mechanical force capable of raising a weight of about
eight hundred and thirty pounds to the height of one foot."(2)

JOULE OR MAYER?

Two years later Joule wished to read another paper, but the chairman hinted that time was limited,
and asked him to confine himself to a brief verbal synopsis of the results of his experiments.
Had the chairman but known it, he was curtailing a paper vastly more important than all the
other papers of the meeting put together. However, the synopsis was given, and one man was
there to hear it who had the genius to appreciate its importance. This was William Thomson,
the present Lord Kelvin, now known to all the world as among the greatest of natural philosophers,
but then only a novitiate in science. He came to Joule's aid, started rolling the ball of controversy,
and subsequently associated himself with the Manchester experimenter in pursuing his investigations.

But meantime the acknowledged leaders of British science viewed the new doctrine askance. Faraday,
Brewster, Herschel--those were the great names in physics at that day, and no one of them could
quite accept the new views regarding energy. For several years no older physicist, speaking
with recognized authority, came forward in support of the doctrine of conservation. This culminating
thought of the first half of the nineteenth century came silently into the world, unheralded
and unopposed. The fifth decade of the century had seen it elaborated and substantially demonstrated
in at least three different countries, yet even the leaders of thought did not so much as know
of its existence. In 1853 Whewell, the historian of the inductive sciences, published a second
edition of his history, and, as Huxley has pointed out, he did not so much as refer to the
revolutionizing thought which even then was a full decade old.

By this time, however, the battle was brewing. The rising generation saw the importance of
a law which their elders could not appreciate, and soon it was noised abroad that there were
more than one claimant to the honor of discovery. Chiefly through the efforts of Professor
Tyndall, the work of Mayer became known to the British public, and a most regrettable controversy
ensued between the partisans of Mayer and those of Joule--a bitter controversy, in which Davy's
contention that science knows no country was not always regarded, and which left its scars
upon the hearts and minds of the great men whose personal interests were involved.

And so to this day the question who is the chief discoverer of the law of the conservation
of energy is not susceptible of a categorical answer that would satisfy all philosophers. It
is generally held that the first choice lies between Joule and Mayer. Professor Tyndall has
expressed the belief that in future each of these men will be equally remembered in connection
with this work. But history gives us no warrant for such a hope. Posterity in the long run
demands always that its heroes shall stand alone. Who remembers now that Robert Hooke contested
with Newton the discovery of the doctrine of universal gravitation? The judgment of posterity
is unjust, but it is inexorable. And so we can little doubt that a century from now one name
will be mentioned as that of the originator of the great doctrine of the conservation of energy.
The man whose name is thus remembered will perhaps be spoken of as the Galileo, the Newton,
of the nineteenth century; but whether the name thus dignified by the final verdict of history
will be that of Colding, Mohr, Mayer, Helmholtz, or Joule, is not as, yet decided.

LORD KELVIN AND THE DISSIPATION OF ENERGY

The gradual permeation of the field by the great doctrine of conservation simply repeated the
history of the introduction of every novel and revolutionary thought. Necessarily the elder
generation, to whom all forms of energy were imponderable fluids, must pass away before the
new conception could claim the field. Even the word energy, though Young had introduced it
in 1807, did not come into general use till some time after the middle of the century. To the
generality of philosophers (the word physicist was even less in favor at this time) the various
forms of energy were still subtile fluids, and never was idea relinquished with greater unwillingness
than this. The experiments of Young and Fresnel had convinced a large number of philosophers
that light is a vibration and not a substance; but so great an authority as Biot clung to the
old emission idea to the end of his life, in 1862, and held a following.

Meantime, however, the company of brilliant young men who had just served their apprenticeship
when the doctrine of conservation came upon the scene had grown into authoritative positions,
and were battling actively for the new ideas. Confirmatory evidence that energy is a molecular
motion and not an "imponderable" form of matter accumulated day by day. The experiments of
two Frenchmen, Hippolyte L. Fizeau and Leon Foucault, served finally to convince the last lingering
sceptics that light is an undulation; and by implication brought heat into the same category,
since James David Forbes, the Scotch physicist, had shown in 1837 that radiant heat conforms
to the same laws of polarization and double refraction that govern light. But, for that matter,
the experiments that had established the mechanical equivalent of heat hardly left room for
doubt as to the immateriality of this "imponderable." Doubters had indeed, expressed scepticism
as to the validity of Joule's experiments, but the further researches, experimental and mathematical,
of such workers as Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Rankine, and Tyndall in Great Britain, of Helmholtz
and Clausius in Germany, and of Regnault in France, dealing with various manifestations of
heat, placed the evidence beyond the reach of criticism.

Out of these studies, just at the middle of the century, to which the experiments of Mayer
and Joule had led, grew the new science of thermo-dynamics. Out of them also grew in the mind
of one of the investigators a new generalization, only second in importance to the doctrine
of conservation itself. Professor William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in his studies in thermodynamics
was early impressed with the fact that whereas all the molar motion developed through labor
or gravity could be converted into heat, the process is not fully reversible. Heat can, indeed,
be converted into molar motion or work, but in the process a certain amount of the heat is
radiated into space and lost. The same thing happens whenever any other form of energy is converted
into molar motion. Indeed, every transmutation of energy, of whatever character, seems complicated
by a tendency to develop heat, part of which is lost. This observation led Professor Thomson
to his doctrine of the dissipation of energy, which he formulated before the Royal Society
of Edinburgh in 1852, and published also in the Philosophical Magazine the same year, the title
borne being, "On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy."

From the principle here expressed Professor Thomson drew the startling conclusion that, "since
any restoration of this mechanical energy without more than an equivalent dissipation is impossible,"
the universe, as known to us, must be in the condition of a machine gradually running down;
and in particular that the world we live on has been within a finite time unfit for human habitation,
and must again become so within a finite future. This thought seems such a commonplace to-day
that it is difficult to realize how startling it appeared half a century ago. A generation
trained, as ours has been, in the doctrines of the conservation and dissipation of energy as
the very alphabet of physical science can but ill appreciate the mental attitude of a generation
which for the most part had not even thought it problematical whether the sun could continue
to give out heat and light forever. But those advance thinkers who had grasped the import of
the doctrine of conservation could at once appreciate the force of Thomson's doctrine of dissipation,
and realize the complementary character of the two conceptions.

Here and there a thinker like Rankine did, indeed, attempt to fancy conditions under which
the energy lost through dissipation might be restored to availability, but no such effort has
met with success, and in time Professor Thomson's generalization and his conclusions as to
the consequences of the law involved came to be universally accepted.

The introduction of the new views regarding the nature of energy followed, as I have said,
the course of every other growth of new ideas. Young and imaginative men could accept the new
point of view; older philosophers, their minds channelled by preconceptions, could not get
into the new groove. So strikingly true is this in the particular case now before us that it
is worth while to note the ages at the time of the revolutionary experiments of the men whose
work has been mentioned as entering into the scheme of evolution of the idea that energy is
merely a manifestation of matter in motion. Such a list will tell the story better than a volume
of commentary.

Observe, then, that Davy made his epochal experiment of melting ice by friction when he was
a youth of twenty. Young was no older when he made his first communication to the Royal Society,
and was in his twenty-seventh year when he first actively espoused the undulatory theory. Fresnel
was twenty-six when he made his first important discoveries in the same field; and Arago, who
at once became his champion, was then but two years his senior, though for a decade he had
been so famous that one involuntarily thinks of him as belonging to an elder generation.

Forbes was under thirty when he discovered the polarization of heat, which pointed the way
to Mohr, then thirty-one, to the mechanical equivalent. Joule was twenty-two in 1840, when
his great work was begun; and Mayer, whose discoveries date from the same year, was then twenty-six,
which was also the age of Helmholtz when he published his independent discovery of the same
law. William Thomson was a youth just past his majority when he came to the aid of Joule before
the British Society, and but seven years older when he formulated his own doctrine of the dissipation
of energy. And Clausius and Rankine, who are usually mentioned with Thomson as the great developers
of thermo-dynamics, were both far advanced with their novel studies before they were thirty.
With such a list in mind, we may well agree with the father of inductive science that "the
man who is young in years may be old in hours."

Yet we must not forget that the shield has a reverse side. For was not the greatest of observing
astronomers, Herschel, past thirty-five before he ever saw a telescope, and past fifty before
he discovered the heat rays of the spectrum? And had not Faraday reached middle life before
he turned his attention especially to electricity? Clearly, then, to make this phrase complete,
Bacon should have added that "the man who is old in years may be young in imagination." Here,
however, even more appropriate than in the other case--more's the pity--would have been the
application of his qualifying clause: "but that happeneth rarely."

THE FINAL UNIFICATION

There are only a few great generalizations as yet thought out in any single field of science.
Naturally, then, after a great generalization has found definitive expression, there is a period
of lull before another forward move. In the case of the doctrines of energy, the lull has lasted
half a century. Throughout this period, it is true, a multitude of workers have been delving
in the field, and to the casual observer it might seem as if their activity had been boundless,
while the practical applications of their ideas--as exemplified, for example, in the telephone,
phonograph, electric light, and so on--have been little less than revolutionary. Yet the most
competent of living authorities, Lord Kelvin, could assert in 1895 that in fifty years he had
learned nothing new regarding the nature of energy.

This, however, must not be interpreted as meaning that the world has stood still during these
two generations. It means rather that the rank and file have been moving forward along the
road the leaders had already travelled. Only a few men in the world had the range of thought
regarding the new doctrine of energy that Lord Kelvin had at the middle of the century. The
few leaders then saw clearly enough that if one form of energy is in reality merely an undulation
or vibration among the particles of "ponderable" matter or of ether, all other manifestations
of energy must be of the same nature. But the rank and file were not even within sight of this
truth for a long time after they had partly grasped the meaning of the doctrine of conservation.
When, late in the fifties, that marvellous young Scotchman, James Clerk-Maxwell, formulating
in other words an idea of Faraday's, expressed his belief that electricity and magnetism are
but manifestations of various conditions of stress and motion in the ethereal medium (electricity
a displacement of strain, magnetism a whirl in the ether), the idea met with no immediate popularity.
And even less cordial was the reception given the same thinker's theory, put forward in 1863,
that the ethereal undulations producing the phenomenon we call light differ in no respect except
in their wave-length from the pulsations of electro-magnetism.

At about the same time Helmholtz formulated a somewhat similar electro-magnetic theory of light;
but even the weight of this combined authority could not give the doctrine vogue until very
recently, when the experiments of Heinrich Hertz, the pupil of Helmholtz, have shown that a
condition of electrical strain may be developed into a wave system by recurrent interruptions
of the electric state in the generator, and that such waves travel through the ether with the
rapidity of light. Since then the electro-magnetic theory of light has been enthusiastically
referred to as the greatest generalization of the century; but the sober thinker must see that
it is really only what Hertz himself called it--one pier beneath the great arch of conservation.
It is an interesting detail of the architecture, but the part cannot equal the size of the whole.

More than that, this particular pier is as yet by no means a very firm one. It has, indeed,
been demonstrated that waves of electro-magnetism pass through space with the speed of light,
but as yet no one has developed electric waves even remotely approximating the shortness of
the visual rays. The most that can positively be asserted, therefore, is that all the known
forms of radiant energy-heat, light, electro-magnetism--travel through space at the same rate
of speed, and consist of traverse vibrations--"lateral quivers," as Fresnel said of light--known
to differ in length, and not positively known to differ otherwise. It has, indeed, been suggested
that the newest form of radiant energy, the famous X-ray of Professor Roentgen's discovery,
is a longitudinal vibration, but this is a mere surmise. Be that as it may, there is no one
now to question that all forms of radiant energy, whatever their exact affinities, consist
essentially of undulatory motions of one uniform medium.

A full century of experiment, calculation, and controversy has thus sufficed to correlate the
"imponderable fluids" of our forebears, and reduce them all to manifestations of motion among
particles of matter. At first glimpse that seems an enormous change of view. And yet, when
closely considered, that change in thought is not so radical as the change in phrase might
seem to imply. For the nineteenth-century physicist, in displacing the "imponderable fluids"
of many kinds--one each for light, heat, electricity, magnetism--has been obliged to substitute
for them one all-pervading fluid, whose various quivers, waves, ripples, whirls or strains
produce the manifestations which in popular parlance are termed forms of force. This all-pervading
fluid the physicist terms the ether, and he thinks of it as having no weight. In effect, then,
the physicist has dispossessed the many imponderables in favor of a single imponderable--though
the word imponderable has been banished from his vocabulary. In this view the ether--which,
considered as a recognized scientific verity, is essentially a nineteenth-century discovery--is
about the most interesting thing in the universe. Something more as to its properties, real
or assumed, we shall have occasion to examine as we turn to the obverse side of physics, which
demands our attention in the next chapter.

IX. THE ETHER AND PONDERABLE MATTER

"Whatever difficulties we may have in forming a consistent idea of the constitution of the
ether, there can be no doubt that the interplanetary and interstellar spaces are not empty,
but are occupied by a material substance or body which is certainly the largest and probably
the most uniform body of which we have any knowledge."

Such was the verdict pronounced some thirty years ago by James Clerk-Maxwell, one of the very
greatest of nineteenth-century physicists, regarding the existence of an all-pervading plenum
in the universe, in which every particle of tangible matter is immersed. And this verdict may
be said to express the attitude of the entire philosophical world of our day. Without exception,
the authoritative physicists of our time accept this plenum as a verity, and reason about it
with something of the same confidence they manifest in speaking of "ponderable" matter or of,
energy. It is true there are those among them who are disposed to deny that this all-pervading
plenum merits the name of matter. But that it is a something, and a vastly important something
at that, all are agreed. Without it, they allege, we should know nothing of light, of radiant
heat, of electricity or magnetism; without it there would probably be no such thing as gravitation;
nay, they even hint that without this strange something, ether, there would be no such thing
as matter in the universe. If these contentions of the modern physicist are justified, then
this intangible ether is incomparably the most important as well as the "largest and most uniform
substance or body" in the universe. Its discovery may well be looked upon as one of the most
important feats of the nineteenth century.

For a discovery of that century it surely is, in the sense that all the known evidences of
its existence were gathered in that epoch. True dreamers of all ages have, for metaphysical
reasons, imagined the existence of intangible fluids in space--they had, indeed, peopled space
several times over with different kinds of ethers, as Maxwell remarks--but such vague dreamings
no more constituted the discovery of the modern ether than the dream of some pre-Columbian
visionary that land might lie beyond the unknown waters constituted the discovery of America.
In justice it must be admitted that Huyghens, the seventeenth-century originator of the undulatory
theory of light, caught a glimpse of the true ether; but his contemporaries and some eight
generations of his successors were utterly deaf to his claims; so he bears practically the
same relation to the nineteenth-century discoverers of ether that the Norseman bears to Columbus.

The true Columbus of the ether was Thomas Young. His discovery was consummated in the early
days of the nineteenth century, when he brought forward the first, conclusive proofs of the
undulatory theory of light. To say that light consists of undulations is to postulate something
that undulates; and this something could not be air, for air exists only in infinitesimal quantity,
if at all, in the interstellar spaces, through which light freely penetrates. But if not air,
what then? Why, clearly, something more intangible than air; something supersensible, evading
all direct efforts to detect it, yet existing everywhere in seemingly vacant space, and also
interpenetrating the substance of all transparent liquids and solids, if not, indeed, of all
tangible substances. This intangible something Young rechristened the Luminiferous Ether.

In the early days of his discovery Young thought of the undulations which produce light and
radiant heat as being longitudinal--a forward and backward pulsation, corresponding to the
pulsations of sound--and as such pulsations can be transmitted by a fluid medium with the properties
of ordinary fluids, he was justified in thinking of the ether as being like a fluid in its
properties, except for its extreme intangibility. But about 1818 the experiments of Fresnel
and Arago with polarization of light made it seem very doubtful whether the theory of longitudinal
vibrations is sufficient, and it was suggested by Young, and independently conceived and demonstrated
by Fresnel, that the luminiferous undulations are not longitudinal, but transverse; and all
the more recent experiments have tended to confirm this view. But it happens that ordinary
fluids--gases and liquids--cannot transmit lateral vibrations; only rigid bodies are capable
of such a vibration. So it became necessary to assume that the luminiferous ether is a body
possessing elastic rigidity--a familiar property of tangible solids, but one quite unknown
among fluids.

The idea of transverse vibrations carried with it another puzzle. Why does not the ether, when
set aquiver with the vibration which gives us the sensation we call light, have produced in
its substance subordinate quivers, setting out at right angles from the path of the original
quiver? Such perpendicular vibrations seem not to exist, else we might see around a corner;
how explain their absence? The physicist could think of but one way: they must assume that
the ether is incompressible. It must fill all space--at any rate, all space with which human
knowledge deals--perfectly full.

These properties of the ether, incompressibility and elastic rigidity, are quite conceivable
by themselves; but difficulties of thought appear when we reflect upon another quality which
the ether clearly must possess--namely, frictionlessness. By hypothesis this rigid, incompressible
body pervades all space, imbedding every particle of tangible matter; yet it seems not to retard
the movements of this matter in the slightest degree. This is undoubtedly the most difficult
to comprehend of the alleged properties of the ether. The physicist explains it as due to the
perfect elasticity of the ether, in virtue of which it closes in behind a moving particle with
a push exactly counterbalancing the stress required to penetrate it in front.

To a person unaccustomed to think of seemingly solid matter as really composed of particles
relatively wide apart, it is hard to understand the claim that ether penetrates the substance
of solids--of glass, for example--and, to use Young's expression, which we have previously
quoted, moves among them as freely as the wind moves through a grove of trees. This thought,
however, presents few difficulties to the mind accustomed to philosophical speculation. But
the question early arose in the mind of Fresnel whether the ether is not considerably affected
by contact with the particles of solids. Some of his experiments led him to believe that a
portion of the ether which penetrates among the molecules of tangible matter is held captive,
so to speak, and made to move along with these particles. He spoke of such portions of the
ether as "bound" ether, in contradistinction to the great mass of "free" ether. Half a century
after Fresnel's death, when the ether hypothesis had become an accepted tenet of science, experiments
were undertaken by Fizeau in France, and by Clerk-Maxwell in England, to ascertain whether
any portion of ether is really thus bound to particles of matter; but the results of the experiments
were negative, and the question is still undetermined.

While the undulatory theory of light was still fighting its way, another kind of evidence favoring
the existence of an ether was put forward by Michael Faraday, who, in the course of his experiments
in electrical and magnetic induction, was led more and more to perceive definite lines or channels
of force in the medium subject to electro-magnetic influence. Faraday's mind, like that of
Newton and many other philosophers, rejected the idea of action at a distance, and he felt
convinced that the phenomena of magnetism and of electric induction told strongly for the existence
of an invisible plenum everywhere in space, which might very probably be the same plenum that
carries the undulations of light and radiant heat.

Then, about the middle of the century, came that final revolution of thought regarding the
nature of energy which we have already outlined in the preceding chapter, and with that the
case for ether was considered to be fully established. The idea that energy is merely a "mode
of motion" (to adopt Tyndall's familiar phrase), combined with the universal rejection of the
notion of action at a distance, made the acceptance of a plenum throughout space a necessity
of thought--so, at any rate, it has seemed to most physicists of recent decades. The proof
that all known forms of radiant energy move through space at the same rate of speed is regarded
as practically a demonstration that but one plenum--one ether--is concerned in their transmission.
It has, indeed, been tentatively suggested, by Professor J. Oliver Lodge, that there may be
two ethers, representing the two opposite kinds of electricity, but even the author of this
hypothesis would hardly claim for it a high degree of probability.

The most recent speculations regarding the properties of the ether have departed but little
from the early ideas of Young and Fresnel. It is assumed on all sides that the ether is a continuous,
incompressible body, possessing rigidity and elasticity. Lord Kelvin has even calculated the
probable density of this ether, and its coefficient of rigidity. As might be supposed, it is
all but infinitely tenuous as compared with any tangible solid, and its rigidity is but infinitesimal
as compared with that of steel. In a word, it combines properties of tangible matter in a way
not known in any tangible substance. Therefore we cannot possibly conceive its true condition
correctly. The nearest approximation, according to Lord Kelvin, is furnished by a mould of
transparent jelly. It is a crude, inaccurate analogy, of course, the density and resistance
of jelly in particular being utterly different from those of the ether; but the quivers that
run through the jelly when it is shaken, and the elastic tension under which it is placed when
its mass is twisted about, furnish some analogy to the quivers and strains in the ether, which
are held to constitute radiant energy, magnetism, and electricity.

The great physicists of the day being at one regarding the existence of this all-pervading
ether, it would be a manifest presumption for any one standing without the pale to challenge
so firmly rooted a belief. And, indeed, in any event, there seems little ground on which to
base such a challenge. Yet it may not be altogether amiss to reflect that the physicist of
to-day is no more certain of his ether than was his predecessor of the eighteenth century of
the existence of certain alleged substances which he called phlogiston, caloric, corpuscles
of light, and magnetic and electric fluids. It would be but the repetition of history should
it chance that before the close of another century the ether should have taken its place along
with these discarded creations of the scientific imagination of earlier generations. The philosopher
of to-day feels very sure that an ether exists; but when he says there is "no doubt" of its
existence he speaks incautiously, and steps beyond the bounds of demonstration. He does not
KNOW that action cannot take place at a distance; he does not KNOW that empty space itself
may not perform the functions which he ascribes to his space-filling ether.

Meantime, however, the ether, be it substance or be it only dream-stuff, is serving an admirable
purpose in furnishing a fulcrum for modern physics. Not alone to the student of energy has
it proved invaluable, but to the student of matter itself as well. Out of its hypothetical
mistiness has been reared the most tenable theory of the constitution of ponderable matter
which has yet been suggested--or, at any rate, the one that will stand as the definitive nineteenth-century
guess at this "riddle of the ages." I mean, of course, the vortex theory of atoms--that profound
and fascinating doctrine which suggests that matter, in all its multiform phases, is neither
more nor less than ether in motion.

The author of this wonderful conception is Lord Kelvin. The idea was born in his mind of a
happy union of mathematical calculations with concrete experiments. The mathematical calculations
were largely the work of Hermann von Helmholtz, who, about the year 1858, had undertaken to
solve some unique problems in vortex motions. Helmholtz found that a vortex whirl, once established
in a frictionless medium, must go on, theoretically, unchanged forever. In a limited medium
such a whirl may be V-shaped, with its ends at the surface of the medium. We may imitate such
a vortex by drawing the bowl of a spoon quickly through a cup of water. But in a limitless
medium the vortex whirl must always be a closed ring, which may take the simple form of a hoop
or circle, or which may be indefinitely contorted, looped, or, so to speak, knotted. Whether
simple or contorted, this endless chain of whirling matter (the particles revolving about the
axis of the loop as the particles of a string revolve when the string is rolled between the
fingers) must, in a frictionless medium, retain its form and whirl on with undiminished speed
forever.

While these theoretical calculations of Helmholtz were fresh in his mind, Lord Kelvin (then
Sir William Thomson) was shown by Professor P. G. Tait, of Edinburgh, an apparatus constructed
for the purpose of creating vortex rings in air. The apparatus, which any one may duplicate,
consisted simply of a box with a hole bored in one side, and a piece of canvas stretched across
the opposite side in lieu of boards. Fumes of chloride of ammonia are generated within the
box, merely to render the air visible. By tapping with the band on the canvas side of the box,
vortex rings of the clouded air are driven out, precisely similar in appearance to those smoke-rings
which some expert tobacco-smokers can produce by tapping on their cheeks, or to those larger
ones which we sometimes see blown out from the funnel of a locomotive.

The advantage of Professor Tait's apparatus is its manageableness and the certainty with which
the desired result can be produced. Before Lord Kelvin's interested observation it threw out
rings of various sizes, which moved straight across the room at varying rates of speed, according
to the initial impulse, and which behaved very strangely when coming in contact with one another.
If, for example, a rapidly moving ring overtook another moving in the same path, the one in
advance seemed to pause, and to spread out its periphery like an elastic band, while the pursuer
seemed to contract, till it actually slid through the orifice of the other, after which each
ring resumed its original size, and continued its course as if nothing had happened. When,
on the other hand, two rings moving in slightly different directions came near each other,
they seemed to have an attraction for each other; yet if they impinged, they bounded away,
quivering like elastic solids. If an effort were made to grasp or to cut one of these rings,
the subtle thing shrank from the contact, and slipped away as if it were alive.

And all the while the body which thus conducted itself consisted simply of a whirl in the air,
made visible, but not otherwise influenced, by smoky fumes. Presently the friction of the surrounding
air wore the ring away, and it faded into the general atmosphere--often, however, not until
it had persisted for many seconds, and passed clear across a large room. Clearly, if there
were no friction, the ring's inertia must make it a permanent structure. Only the frictionless
medium was lacking to fulfil all the conditions of Helmholtz's indestructible vortices. And
at once Lord Kelvin bethought him of the frictionless medium which physicists had now begun
to accept--the all-pervading ether. What if vortex rings were started in this ether, must they
not have the properties which the vortex rings in air had exhibited--inertia, attraction, elasticity?
And are not these the properties of ordinary tangible matter? Is it not probable, then, that
what we call matter consists merely of aggregations of infinitesimal vortex rings in the ether?

Thus the vortex theory of atoms took form in Lord Kelvin's mind, and its expression gave the
world what many philosophers of our time regard as the most plausible conception of the constitution
of matter hitherto formulated. It is only a theory, to be sure; its author would be the last
person to claim finality for it. "It is only a dream," Lord Kelvin said to me, in referring
to it not long ago. But it has a basis in mathematical calculation and in analogical experiment
such as no other theory of matter can lay claim to, and it has a unifying or monistic tendency
that makes it, for the philosophical mind, little less than fascinating. True or false, it
is the definitive theory of matter of the twentieth century.

Quite aside from the question of the exact constitution of the ultimate particles of matter,
questions as to the distribution of such particles, their mutual relations, properties, and
actions, came in for a full share of attention during the nineteenth century, though the foundations
for the modern speculations were furnished in a previous epoch. The most popular eighteenth-century
speculation as to the ultimate constitution of matter was that of the learned Italian priest,
Roger Joseph Boscovich, published in 1758, in his Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis. "In this
theory," according to an early commentator, "the whole mass of which the bodies of the universe
are composed is supposed to consist of an exceedingly great yet finite number of simple, indivisible,
inextended atoms. These atoms are endued by the Creator with REPULSIVE and ATTRACTIVE forces,
which vary according to the distance. At very small distances the particles of matter repel
each other; and this repulsive force increases beyond all limits as the distances are diminished,
and will consequently forever prevent actual contact. When the particles of matter are removed
to sensible distances, the repulsive is exchanged for an attractive force, which decreases
in inverse ratio with the squares of the distances, and extends beyond the spheres of the most
remote comets."

This conception of the atom as a mere centre of force was hardly such as could satisfy any
mind other than the metaphysical. No one made a conspicuous attempt to improve upon the idea,
however, till just at the close of the century, when Humphry Davy was led, in the course of
his studies of heat, to speculate as to the changes that occur in the intimate substance of
matter under altered conditions of temperature. Davy, as we have seen, regarded heat as a manifestation
of motion among the particles of matter. As all bodies with which we come in contact have some
temperature, Davy inferred that the intimate particles of every substance must be perpetually
in a state of vibration. Such vibrations, he believed, produced the "repulsive force" which
(in common with Boscovich) he admitted as holding the particles of matter at a distance from
one another. To heat a substance means merely to increase the rate of vibration of its particles;
thus also, plainly, increasing the repulsive forces and expanding the bulk of the mass as a
whole. If the degree of heat applied be sufficient, the repulsive force may become strong enough
quite to overcome the attractive force, and the particles will separate and tend to fly away
from one another, the solid then becoming a gas.

Not much attention was paid to these very suggestive ideas of Davy, because they were founded
on the idea that heat is merely a motion, which the scientific world then repudiated; but half
a century later, when the new theories of energy had made their way, there came a revival of
practically the same ideas of the particles of matter (molecules they were now called) which
Davy had advocated. Then it was that Clausius in Germany and Clerk-Maxwell in England took
up the investigation of what came to be known as the kinetic theory of gases--the now familiar
conception that all the phenomena of gases are due to the helter-skelter flight of the showers
of widely separated molecules of which they are composed. The specific idea that the pressure
or "spring" of gases is due to such molecular impacts was due to Daniel Bournelli, who advanced
it early in the eighteenth century. The idea, then little noticed, had been revived about a
century later by William Herapath, and again with some success by J. J. Waterston, of Bombay,
about 1846; but it gained no distinct footing until taken in hand by Clausius in 1857 and by
Clerk-Maxwell in 1859.

The considerations that led Clerk-Maxwell to take up the computations may be stated in his
own words, as formulated in a paper "On the Motions and Collisions of Perfectly Elastic Spheres."

"So many of the properties of matter, especially when in the gaseous form," he says, "can be
deduced from the hypothesis that their minute parts are in rapid motion, the velocity increasing
with the temperature, that the precise nature of this motion becomes a subject of rational
curiosity. Daniel Bournelli, Herapath, Joule, Kronig, Clausius, etc., have shown that the relations
between pressure, temperature, and density in a perfect gas can be explained by supposing the
particles to move with uniform velocities in straight lines, striking against the sides of
the containing vessel and thus producing pressure. It is not necessary to suppose each particle
to travel to any great distance in the same straight line; for the effect in producing pressure
will be the same if the particles strike against each other; so that the straight line described
may be very short. M. Clausius has determined the mean length of path in terms of the average
of the particles, and the distance between the centres of two particles when the collision
takes place. We have at present no means of ascertaining either of these distances; but certain
phenomena, such as the internal friction of gases, the conduction of heat through a gas, and
the diffusion of one gas through another, seem to indicate the possibility of determining accurately
the mean length of path which a particle describes between two successive collisions. In order
to lay the foundation of such investigations on strict mechanical principles, I shall demonstrate
the laws of motion of an indefinite number of small, hard, and perfectly elastic spheres acting
on one another only during impact. If the properties of such a system of bodies are found to
correspond to those of gases, an important physical analogy will be established, which may
lead to more accurate knowledge of the properties of matter. If experiments on gases are inconsistent
with the hypothesis of these propositions, then our theory, though consistent with itself,
is proved to be incapable of explaining the phenomena of gases. In either case it is necessary
to follow out these consequences of the hypothesis.

"Instead of saying that the particles are hard, spherical, and elastic, we may, if we please,
say the particles are centres of force, of which the action is insensible except at a certain
very small distance, when it suddenly appears as a repulsive force of very great intensity.
It is evident that either assumption will lead to the same results. For the sake of avoiding
the repetition of a long phrase about these repulsive bodies, I shall proceed upon the assumption
of perfectly elastic spherical bodies. If we suppose those aggregate molecules which move together
to have a bounding surface which is not spherical, then the rotatory motion of the system will
close up a certain proportion of the whole vis viva, as has been shown by Clausius, and in
this way we may account for the value of the specific heat being greater than on the more simple
hypothesis."(1)

The elaborate investigations of Clerk-Maxwell served not merely to substantiate the doctrine,
but threw a flood of light upon the entire subject of molecular dynamics. Soon the physicists
came to feel as certain of the existence of these showers of flying molecules making up a gas
as if they could actually see and watch their individual actions. Through study of the viscosity
of gases--that is to say, of the degree of frictional opposition they show to an object moving
through them or to another current of gas--an idea was gained, with the aid of mathematics,
of the rate of speed at which the particles of the gas are moving, and the number of collisions
which each particle must experience in a given time, and of the length of the average free
path traversed by the molecule between collisions, These measurements were confirmed by study
of the rate of diffusion at which different gases mix together, and also by the rate of diffusion
of heat through a gas, both these phenomena being chiefly due to the helter-skelter flight
of the molecules.

It is sufficiently astonishing to be told that such measurements as these have been made at
all, but the astonishment grows when one hears the results. It appears from Clerk-Maxwell's
calculations that the mean free path, or distance traversed by the molecules between collisions
in ordinary air, is about one-half-millionth of an inch; while the speed of the molecules is
such that each one experiences about eight billions of collisions per second! It would be hard,
perhaps, to cite an illustration showing the refinements of modern physics better than this;
unless, indeed, one other result that followed directly from these calculations be considered
such--the feat, namely, of measuring the size of the molecules themselves. Clausius was the
first to point out how this might be done from a knowledge of the length of free path; and
the calculations were made by Loschmidt in Germany and by Lord Kelvin in England, independently.

The work is purely mathematical, of course, but the results are regarded as unassailable; indeed,
Lord Kelvin speaks of them as being absolutely demonstrative within certain limits of accuracy.
This does not mean, however, that they show the exact dimensions of the molecule; it means
an estimate of the limits of size within which the actual size of the molecule may lie. These
limits, Lord Kelvin estimates, are about the one-ten-millionth of a centimetre for the maximum,
and the one-one-hundred-millionth of a centimetre for the minimum. Such figures convey no particular
meaning to our blunt senses, but Lord Kelvin has given a tangible illustration that aids the
imagination to at least a vague comprehension of the unthinkable smallness of the molecule.
He estimates that if a ball, say of water or glass, about "as large as a football, were to
be magnified up to the size of the earth, each constituent molecule being magnified in the
same proportion, the magnified structure would be more coarse-grained than a heap of shot,
but probably less coarse-grained than a heap of footballs."

Several other methods have been employed to estimate the size of molecules. One of these is
based upon the phenomena of contact electricity; another upon the wave-theory of light; and
another upon capillary attraction, as shown in the tense film of a soap-bubble! No one of these
methods gives results more definite than that due to the kinetic theory of gases, just outlined;
but the important thing is that the results obtained by these different methods (all of them
due to Lord Kelvin) agree with one another in fixing the dimensions of the molecule at somewhere
about the limits already mentioned. We may feel very sure indeed, therefore, that the molecules
of matter are not the unextended, formless points which Boscovich and his followers of the
eighteenth century thought them. But all this, it must be borne in mind, refers to the molecule,
not to the ultimate particle of matter, about which we shall have more to say in another connection.
Curiously enough, we shall find that the latest theories as to the final term of the series
are not so very far afield from the dreamings of the eighteenth-century philosophers; the electron
of J. J. Thompson shows many points of resemblance to the formless centre of Boscovich.

Whatever the exact form of the molecule, its outline is subject to incessant variation; for
nothing in molecular science is regarded as more firmly established than that the molecule,
under all ordinary circumstances, is in a state of intense but variable vibration. The entire
energy of a molecule of gas, for example, is not measured by its momentum, but by this plus
its energy of vibration and rotation, due to the collisions already referred to. Clausius has
even estimated the relative importance of these two quantities, showing that the translational
motion of a molecule of gas accounts for only three-fifths of its kinetic energy. The total
energy of the molecule (which we call "heat") includes also another factor--namely, potential
energy, or energy of position, due to the work that has been done on expanding, in overcoming
external pressure, and internal attraction between the molecules themselves. This potential
energy (which will be recovered when the gas contracts) is the "latent heat" of Black, which
so long puzzled the philosophers. It is latent in the same sense that the energy of a ball
thrown into the air is latent at the moment when the ball poises at its greatest height before
beginning to fall.

It thus appears that a variety of motions, real and potential, enter into the production of
the condition we term heat. It is, however, chiefly the translational motion which is measurable
as temperature; and this, too, which most obviously determines the physical state of the substance
that the molecules collectively compose--whether, that is to say, it shall appear to our blunt
perceptions as a gas, a liquid, or a solid. In the gaseous state, as we have seen, the translational
motion of the molecules is relatively enormous, the molecules being widely separated. It does
not follow, as we formerly supposed, that this is evidence of a repulsive power acting between
the molecules. The physicists of to-day, headed by Lord Kelvin, decline to recognize any such
power. They hold that the molecules of a gas fly in straight lines by virtue of their inertia,
quite independently of one another, except at times of collision, from which they rebound by
virtue of their elasticity; or on an approach to collision, in which latter case, coming within
the range of mutual attraction, two molecules may circle about each other, as a comet circles
about the sun, then rush apart again, as the comet rushes from the sun.

It is obvious that the length of the mean free path of the molecules of a gas may be increased
indefinitely by decreasing the number of the molecules themselves in a circumscribed space.
It has been shown by Professors Tait and Dewar that a vacuum may be produced artificially of
such a degree of rarefaction that the mean free path of the remaining molecules is measurable
in inches. The calculation is based on experiments made with the radiometer of Professor Crookes,
an instrument which in itself is held to demonstrate the truth of the kinetic theory of gases.
Such an attenuated gas as this is considered by Professor Crookes as constituting a fourth
state of matter, which he terms ultra-gaseous.

If, on the other hand, a gas is subjected to pressure, its molecules are crowded closer together,
and the length of their mean free path is thus lessened. Ultimately, the pressure being sufficient,
the molecules are practically in continuous contact. Meantime the enormously increased number
of collisions has set the molecules more and more actively vibrating, and the temperature of
the gas has increased, as, indeed, necessarily results in accordance with the law of the conservation
of energy. No amount of pressure, therefore, can suffice by itself to reduce the gas to a liquid
state. It is believed that even at the centre of the sun, where the pressure is almost inconceivably
great, all matter is to be regarded as really gaseous, though the molecules must be so packed
together that the consistency is probably more like that of a solid.

If, however, coincidently with the application of pressure, opportunity be given for the excess
of heat to be dissipated to a colder surrounding medium, the molecules, giving off their excess
of energy, become relatively quiescent, and at a certain stage the gas becomes a liquid. The
exact point at which this transformation occurs, however, differs enormously for different
substances. In the case of water, for example, it is a temperature more than four hundred degrees
above zero, centigrade; while for atmospheric air it is one hundred and ninety-four degrees
centigrade below zero, or more than a hundred and fifty degrees below the point at which mercury
freezes.

Be it high or low, the temperature above which any substance is always a gas, regardless of
pressure, is called the critical temperature, or absolute boiling-point, of that substance.
It does not follow, however, that below this point the substance is necessarily a liquid. This
is a matter that will be determined by external conditions of pressure. Even far below the
critical temperature the molecules have an enormous degree of activity, and tend to fly asunder,
maintaining what appears to be a gaseous, but what technically is called a vaporous, condition--the
distinction being that pressure alone suffices to reduce the vapor to the liquid state. Thus
water may change from the gaseous to the liquid state at four hundred degrees above zero, but
under conditions of ordinary atmospheric pressure it does not do so until the temperature is
lowered three hundred degrees further. Below four hundred degrees, however, it is technically
a vapor, not a gas; but the sole difference, it will be understood, is in the degree of molecular
activity.

It thus appeared that the prevalence of water in a vaporous and liquid rather than in a "permanently"
gaseous condition here on the globe is a mere incident of telluric evolution. Equally incidental
is the fact that the air we breathe is "permanently" gaseous and not liquid or solid, as it
might be were the earth's surface temperature to be lowered to a degree which, in the larger
view, may be regarded as trifling. Between the atmospheric temperature in tropical and in arctic
regions there is often a variation of more than one hundred degrees; were the temperature reduced
another hundred, the point would be reached at which oxygen gas becomes a vapor, and under
increased pressure would be a liquid. Thirty-seven degrees more would bring us to the critical
temperature of nitrogen.

Nor is this a mere theoretical assumption; it is a determination of experimental science, quite
independent of theory. The physicist in the laboratory has produced artificial conditions of
temperature enabling him to change the state of the most persistent gases. Some fifty years
since, when the kinetic theory was in its infancy, Faraday liquefied carbonic-acid gas, among
others, and the experiments thus inaugurated have been extended by numerous more recent investigators,
notably by Cailletet in Switzerland, by Pictet in France, and by Dr. Thomas. Andrews and Professor
James Dewar in England. In the course of these experiments not only has air been liquefied,
but hydrogen also, the most subtle of gases; and it has been made more and more apparent that
gas and liquid are, as Andrews long ago asserted, "only distant stages of a long series of
continuous physical changes." Of course, if the temperature be lowered still further, the liquid
becomes a solid; and this change also has been effected in the case of some of the most "permanent"
gases, including air.

The degree of cold--that is, of absence of heat--thus produced is enormous, relatively to anything
of which we have experience in nature here at the earth now, yet the molecules of solidified
air, for example, are not absolutely quiescent. In other words, they still have a temperature,
though so very low. But it is clearly conceivable that a stage might be reached at which the
molecules became absolutely quiescent, as regards either translational or vibratory motion.
Such a heatless condition has been approached, but as yet not quite attained, in laboratory
experiments. It is called the absolute zero of temperature, and is estimated to be equivalent
to two hundred and seventy-three degrees Centigrade below the freezing-point of water, or ordinary
zero.

A temperature (or absence of temperature) closely approximating this is believed to obtain
in the ethereal ocean of interplanetary and interstellar space, which transmits, but is thought
not to absorb, radiant energy. We here on the earth's surface are protected from exposure to
this cold, which would deprive every organic thing of life almost instantaneously, solely by
the thin blanket of atmosphere with which the globe is coated. It would seem as if this atmosphere,
exposed to such a temperature at its surface, must there be incessantly liquefied, and thus
fall back like rain to be dissolved into gas again while it still is many miles above the earth's
surface. This may be the reason why its scurrying molecules have not long ago wandered off
into space and left the world without protection.

But whether or not such liquefaction of the air now occurs in our outer atmosphere, there can
be no question as to what must occur in its entire depth were we permanently shut off from
the heating influence of the sun, as the astronomers threaten that we may be in a future age.
Each molecule, not alone of the atmosphere, but of the entire earth's substance, is kept aquiver
by the energy which it receives, or has received, directly or indirectly, from the sun. Left
to itself, each molecule would wear out its energy and fritter it off into the space about
it, ultimately running completely down, as surely as any human-made machine whose power is
not from time to time restored. If, then, it shall come to pass in some future age that the
sun's rays fail us, the temperature of the globe must gradually sink towards the absolute zero.
That is to say, the molecules of gas which now fly about at such inconceivable speed must drop
helpless to the earth; liquids must in turn become solids; and solids themselves, their molecular
quivers utterly stilled, may perhaps take on properties the nature of which we cannot surmise.

Yet even then, according to the current hypothesis, the heatless molecule will still be a thing
instinct with life. Its vortex whirl will still go on, uninfluenced by the dying-out of those
subordinate quivers that produced the transitory effect which we call temperature. For those
transitory thrills, though determining the physical state of matter as measured by our crude
organs of sense, were no more than non-essential incidents; but the vortex whirl is the essence
of matter itself. Some estimates as to the exact character of this intramolecular motion, together
with recent theories as to the actual structure of the molecule, will claim our attention in
a later volume. We shall also have occasion in another connection to make fuller inquiry as
to the phenomena of low temperature.
