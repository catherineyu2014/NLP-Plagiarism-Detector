It is obvious that irrigation cannot be practiced without water, and that every ditch which
takes water from a stream lessens the volume of that stream below where the ditch is taken
out. It is conceivable that so many ditches might be taken out of the stream, and so much of
the water lost by evaporation and seepage into the soil irrigated, that a stream which, uninterfered
with, was bank full and even flowing throughout the summer, might, under such changed condition,
become absolutely dry on the lower reaches of its course. And this, in fact, is what has happened
with some streams in the West. Where this is the case, the farmers who live on the lower stretches
of the stream, being without water to put on their land, can raise no crops. Nothing, therefore,
is more important to the agriculturists of the West than to preserve full and as nearly equal
as possible at all seasons the water supply in their streams.

This water is supplied by the annual rain or snow fall; but in the West chiefly by snow. It
falls deep on the high mountains, and, protected there by the pine forests, accumulates all
through the winter, and in spring slowly melts. The deep layer of half-rotted pine needles,
branches, decayed wood and other vegetable matter which forms the forest floor, receives this
melting snow and holds much of it for a time, while the surplus runs off over the surface of
the ground, and by a thousand tiny rivulets at last reaches some main stream which carries
it toward the sea. In the deep forest, however, the melting of this snow is very gradual, and
the water is given forth slowly and gradually to the stream, and does not cause great floods.
Moreover, the large portion of it which is held by the humus, or forest floor, drains off still
more gradually and keeps the springs and sources of the brook full all through the summer.

Without protection from the warm spring sun, the snows of the winter might melt in a week and
cause tremendous torrents, the whole of the melted snowfall rushing down the stream in a very
short time. Without the humus, or forest floor, to act as a soaked sponge which gradually drains
itself, the springs and sources of the brooks would go dry in early summer, and the streams
further down toward the cultivated plains would be low and without sufficient water to irrigate
all the farms along its course.

It was for the purpose of protecting the farmers of the West by insuring the careful protection
of the water supply of all streams that Congress wisely passed the law providing for the establishing
of the forest reserves. It is for the benefit of these farmers and of those others who shall
establish themselves along these streams that the Presidents of the United States for the last
twelve or fourteen years have been establishing forest reserves and have had expert foresters
studying different sections of the western country to learn where the water was most needed
and where it could best be had.

It is gratifying to think that, while at first the establishment of these forest reserves was
very unpopular in certain sections of the West, where their object was not in the least understood,
they have--now that the people have come to see what they mean--received universal approval.
It sometimes takes the public a long time to understand a matter, but their common sense is
sure at last to bring them to the right side of any question.

The list of reservations here given is brought down to December, 1903, and is furnished by
the U.S. Forester--a member of the Club.

Besides these, there are two or three other reservations in Quebec and New Brunswick and Manitoba
that have not as yet been finally reserved, but which are in contemplation. Many of the timber
reserves are still to be cut over under license. On the other hand, many of them find their
chief function as game preserves, as do also to still greater extent the national parks. A
large number of these parks and timber reserves are clothed with beautiful and valuable forests,
as yet untouched by the ax.

APPENDIX

In order to be in a position to make intelligent recommendations, in case legislation authorizing
the setting aside of game refuges should be had, the Boone and Crockett Club, in the year 1901,
made some inquiry into the game conditions on certain of the forest reservations and as to
the suitability as game refuges of these reserves.

Among the reports was one on the Black Mesa Forest Reserve. Mr. Nelson is a trained naturalist
and hunter of wide experience, and possesses the highest qualifications for investigating such
a subject. He is, besides, very familiar with the reservation reported on. His report is printed
here as giving precisely the information needed by any one who may have occasion to deal with
a forest reserve from this viewpoint, and it may well serve as a model for others who may have
occasion to report on the reserves. The report was made to the Executive Committee of the Boone
and Crockett Club through the editor of this volume, and was printed in Forest and Stream about
two years ago. It follows:

Forest Reserves as Game Preserves

THE BLACK MESA FOREST RESERVE OF ARIZONA AND ITS AVAILABILITY AS A GAME PRESERVE.

The Black Mesa Forest Reserve lies in central-eastern Arizona, and contains 1,658,880 acres,
is about 180 miles long in a northwesterly and southeasterly direction and a direct continuation
southeasterly from the San Francisco Mountain Forest Reserve. On the north it contains a part
of the Mogollon Mesa, which is covered with a magnificent open forest of Arizona yellow pine
(Pinus ponderosa) in which there is an abundance of bunch grass and here and there are beautiful
grassy parks. To the southeast the reserve covers a large part of the White Mountains, one
of the largest areas of generally high elevation in Arizona. The yellow pine forest, similar
in character to that on the Mogollon Mesa, is found over a large part of the reserve between
7,000 and 8,500 feet altitude, and its general character is shown in the accompanying view.

The Black Mesa Reserve is irregular in outline. The large compact areas at each end are joined
by a long, narrow strip, very irregular in outline and less than a township broad at various
points. It lies along the southern border of the Great Colorado Plateau, and covers the southern
and western borders of the basin of the Little Colorado River. Taken as a whole, this reserve
includes some of the wildest and most attractive mountain scenery in the West.

Owing to the wide separation of the two main areas of the reserve, and certain differences
in physical character, they will be described separately, beginning with the northwestern and
middle areas, which are similar in character.

THE NORTHWESTERN SECTION OP THE BLACK MESA RESERVE.

With the exception of an area in the extreme western part, which drains into the Rio Verde,
practically all of this portion of the reserve lies along the upper border of the basin of
the Little Colorado. It is a continuation of the general easy slope which begins about 5,000
feet on the river and extends back so gradually at first that it is frequently almost imperceptible,
but by degrees becomes more rolling and steeper until the summit is reached at an altitude
of from 6,000 to 9,000 feet. The reserve occupies the upper portion of this slope, which has
more the form of a mountainous plateau country, scored by deep and rugged canyons, than of
a typical mountain range. From the summit of this elevated divide, with the exception of the
district draining into the Rio Verde, the southern and western slope drops away abruptly several
thousand feet into Tonto Creek Basin. The top of the huge escarpment thus formed faces south
and west, and is known as the rim of Tonto Basin, or, locally, "The Rim." From the summit of
this gigantic rocky declivity is obtained an inspiring view of the south, where range after
range of mountains lie spread out to the distant horizon.

The rolling plateau country sloping toward the Little Colorado is heavily scored with deep
box canyons often hundreds of feet deep and frequently inaccessible for long distances. Most
of the permanent surface water is found in these canyons, and the general drainage is through
them down to the lower plains bordering the river. The greater part of this portion of the
reserve is covered with yellow pine forests, below which is a belt, varying greatly in width,
of piñons, cedars and junipers, interspersed with a more or less abundant growth of gramma
grass. This belt of scrubby conifers contains many open grassy areas, and nearer the river
gives way to continuous broad grassy plains. Nowhere in this district, either among the yellow
pines or in the lower country, is there much surface water, and a large share of the best watering
places are occupied by sheep owners.

The wild and rugged slopes of Tonto Basin, with their southerly exposure, have a more arid
character than the area just described. On these slopes yellow pines soon give way to piñons,
cedars and junipers, and many scrubby oaks and various species of hardy bushes. The watering
places are scarce until the bottom of the basin is approached. Tonto Basin and its slopes are
also occupied by numerous sheep herds, especially in winter.

There are several small settlements of farmers, sheep and cattle growers within the limits
of the narrow strip connecting the larger parts of the reserve, notably Show Low, Pinetop and
Linden. The wagon road from Holbrook, on the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad, to the military post
at Camp Apache, on the White Mountain Indian Reservation, passes through this strip by way
of Show Low. The old trails through Sunset Pass to Camp Verde and across "The Rim" into Tonto
Basin traverse the northern part of the reserve, and are used by stockmen and others at short
intervals, except in midwinter.

The climate of this section of the reserve is rather arid in summer, the rainfall being much
more uncertain than in the more elevated areas about the San Francisco Mountains to the northwest
and the White Mountains to the southeast. The summers are usually hot and dry, the temperature
being modified, however, by the altitude. Rains sometimes occur during July and August, but
are more common in the autumn, when they are often followed by abundant snowfall. During some
seasons snow falls to a depth of three or more feet on a level in the yellow pine forests,
and remains until spring. During other seasons, however, the snowfall is insignificant, and
much of the ground remains bare during the winter, especially on southern exposures. As a matter
of course, the lower slope of the piñon belt and the grassy plains of the Little Colorado,
both of which lie outside of the reserve, have less and less snow, according to the altitude,
and it never remains for any very considerable time. On the southern exposure, facing Tonto
Basin, the snow is still less permanent. The winter in the yellow pine belt extends from November
to April.

LARGE GAME IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE BLACK MESA RESERVE.

Black-tailed deer, antelope, black and silver tipped bears and mountain lions are the larger
game animals which frequent the yellow pine forests in summer. Wild turkeys are also common.
