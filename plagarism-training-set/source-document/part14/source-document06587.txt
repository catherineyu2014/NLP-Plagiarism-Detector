PREFACE

This volume has been called into being by the absence of any brief work covering the evolution
and influence of sea power from the beginnings to the present time. In a survey at once so
comprehensive and so short, only the high points of naval history can be touched. Yet it is
the hope of the authors that they have not, for that reason, slighted the significance of the
story. Naval history is more than a sequence of battles. Sea power has always been a vital
force in the rise and fall of nations and in the evolution of civilization. It is this significance,
this larger, related point of view, which the authors have tried to make clear in recounting
the story of the sea. In regard to naval principles, also, this general survey should reveal
those unchanging truths of warfare which have been demonstrated from Salamis to Jutland. The
tendency of our modern era of mechanical development has been to forget the value of history.
It is true that the 16" gun is a great advance over the 32-pounder of Trafalgar, but it is
equally true that the naval officer of to-day must still sit at the feet of Nelson.

The authors would acknowledge their indebtedness to Professor F. Wells Williams of Yale, and
to the Classical Departments of Harvard and the University of Chicago for valuable aid in bibliography.
Thanks are due also to Commander C. C. Gill, U. S. N., Captain T. G. Frothingam, U. S. N. R.,
Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, and to colleagues of the Department of English at the Naval Academy
for helpful criticism. As to the "References" at the conclusion of each chapter, it should
be said that they are merely references, not bibliographies. The titles are recommended to
the reader who may wish to study a period in greater detail, and who would prefer a short list
to a complete bibliography.

A HISTORY OF SEA POWER

CHAPTER I

THE BEGINNINGS OF NAVIES

Civilization and sea power arose from the Mediterranean, and the progress of recent archeological
research has shown that civilizations and empires had been reared in the Mediterranean on sea
power long before the dawn of history. Since the records of Egypt are far better preserved
than those of any other nation of antiquity, and the discovery of the Rosetta stone has made
it possible to read them, we know most about the beginnings of civilization in Egypt. We know,
for instance, that an Egyptian king some 2000 years before Christ possessed a fleet of 400
fighting ships. But it appears now that long before this time the island of Crete was a great
naval and commercial power, that in the earliest dynasties of Egypt Cretan fleets were carrying
on a commerce with the Nile valley. Indeed, the Cretans may have taught the Egyptians something
of the art of building sea-going ships for trade and war.[1] At all events, Crete may be regarded
as the first great sea power of history, an island empire like Great Britain to-day, extending
its influence from Sicily to Palestine and dominating the eastern Mediterranean for many centuries.
From recent excavations of the ancient capital we get an interesting light on the old Greek
legends of the Minotaur and the Labyrinth, going back to the time when the island kingdom levied
tribute, human as well as monetary, on its subject cities throughout the Ægean.

[Footnote 1: It is interesting to note that the earliest empires, Assyria and Egypt, were not
naval powers, because they arose in rich river valleys abundantly capable of sustaining their
inhabitants. They did not need to command the sea.]

On this sea power Crete reared an astonishingly advanced civilization. Until recent times,
for instance, the Phnicians had been credited with the invention of the alphabet. We know
now that 1000 years before the Phnicians began to write the Cretans had evolved a system of
written characters--as yet undeciphered--and a decimal system for numbers. A correspondingly
high stage of excellence had been reached in engineering, architecture, and the fine arts,
and even in decay Crete left to Greece the tradition of mastery in laws and government.

The power of Crete was already in its decline centuries before the Trojan War, but during a
thousand years it had spread its own and Egyptian culture over the shores of the Ægean. The
destruction of the island empire in about 1400 B.C. apparently was due to some great disaster
that destroyed her fleet and left her open to invasion by a conquering race--probably the Greeks--who
ravaged her cities by sword and fire. On account of her commanding position in the Mediterranean,
Crete might again have risen to sea power but for the endless civil wars that marked her subsequent
history.

The successor to Crete as mistress of the sea was Phnicia. The Phnicians, oddly enough, were
a Semitic people, a nomadic race with no traditions of the sea whatever. When, however, they
migrated to the coast and settled, they found themselves in a narrow strip of coast between
a range of mountains and the sea. The city of Tyre itself was erected on an island. Consequently
these descendants of herdsmen were compelled to find their livelihood upon the sea--as were
the Venetians and the Dutch in later ages--and for several hundred years they maintained their
control of the ocean highways.

The Phnicians were not literary, scientific, or artistic; they were commercial. Everything
they did was with an eye to business. They explored the Mediterranean and beyond for the sake
of tapping new sources of wealth, they planted colonies for the sake of having trading posts
on their routes, and they developed fighting ships for the sake of preserving their trade monopolies.
Moreover, Phnicia lay at the end of the Asiatic caravan routes. Hence Phnician ships received
the wealth of the Nile valley and Mesopotamia and distributed it along the shores of the Mediterranean.
Phnician ships also uncovered the wealth of Spain and the North African coast, and, venturing
into the Atlantic, drew metals from the British Isles. According to Herodotus, a Phnician
squadron circumnavigated Africa at the beginning of the seventh century before Christ, completing
the voyage in three years. We should know far more now of the extent of the explorations made
by these master mariners of antiquity were it not for the fact that they kept their trade routes
secret as far as possible in order to preserve their trade monopoly.

In developing and organizing these trade routes the Phnicians planted colonies on the islands
of the Mediterranean,--Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and Malta. They held both shores of the Straits
of Gibraltar, and on the Atlantic shores of Spain established posts at Cadiz and Tarshish,
the latter commonly supposed to have been situated just north of Cadiz at the mouth of the
Guadalquivir River. Cadiz was their distributing point for the metals of northern Spain and
the British Isles. The most famous colony was Carthage, situated near the present city of Tunis.
Carthage was founded during the first half of the ninth century before Christ, and on the decay
of the parent state became in turn mistress of the western Mediterranean, holding sway until
crushed by Rome in the Punic Wars.

Of the methods of the Phnicians and their colonists in establishing trade with primitive peoples,
we get an interesting picture from Herodotus,[1] who describes how the Carthaginians conducted
business with barbarous tribes on the northern coast of Africa.

[Footnote 1: HISTORY, translated by Geo. Rawlinson, vol.

In addition to the enormous profits of the carrying trade the Phnicians had a practical monopoly
of the famous "Tyrian dyes," which were in great demand throughout the known world. These dyes
were obtained from two kinds of shellfish together with an alkali prepared from seaweed. Phnicians
were also pioneers in the art of making glass. It is not hard to understand, therefore, how
Phnicia grew so extraordinarily rich as to rouse the envy of neighboring rulers, and to maintain
themselves the traders of Tyre and Sidon had to develop fighting fleets as well as trading fleets.

Early in Egyptian history the distinction was made between the "round" ships of commerce and
the "long" ships of war. The round ship, as the name suggests, was built for cargo capacity
rather than for speed. It depended on sail, with the oars as auxiliaries. The long ship was
designed for speed, depending on oars and using sail only as auxiliary. And while the round
ship was of deep draft and rode to anchor, the shallow flat-bottomed long ships were drawn
up on shore. The Phnicians took the Egyptian and Cretan models and improved them. They lowered
the bows of the fighting ships, added to the blunt ram a beak near the water's edge, and strung
the shields of the fighting men along the bulwarks to protect the rowers. To increase the driving
force and the speed, they added a second and then a third bank of oars, thus producing the
"bireme" and the "trireme." These were the types they handed down to the Greeks, and in fact
there was little advance made beyond the Phnician war galley during all the subsequent centuries
of the Age of the Oar.

About the beginning of the seventh century before Christ the Phnicians had reached the summit
of their power on the seas. Their extraordinary wealth tempted the king of Assyria, in 725
B.C., to cross the mountain barrier with a great army. He had no difficulty in overrunning
the country, but the inhabitants fled to their colonies. The great city of Tyre, being on an
island, defied the invader, and finally the Assyrian king gave up and withdrew to his own country.
Having realized at great cost that he could not subdue the Phnicians without a navy, he set
about finding one. By means of bribes and threats he managed to seduce three Phnician cities
to his side. These furnished him sixty ships officered by Phnicians, but manned by Assyrian crews.
