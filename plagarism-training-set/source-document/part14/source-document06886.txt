(Suggestion: "Take care of No. 1.")

PUNCHINELLO TO THE PUBLIC, GREETING:

His name, PUNCHINELLO hopes, will not be found a difficult one to articulate. He flatters himself
that it has a smack of grape-juice and olives about it. It rhymes with "mellow," which naturally
brings us to "good fellow.". On occasions PUNCHINELLO can "bellow," cut a "tremendous swell,"
O, and he never throws away a chance of pocketing the "yellow." He would like to rhyme with
"swallow;" but alas! it can not, can not be.

And yet, in spite of (or perhaps on account of) PUNCHINELLO'S mellifluous name, much cavil
has been brought to bear upon him. (Prepare to receive cavilry.)

Squadrons of well-meaning persons with speaking-trumpets marched to and fro before the sponsors
of PUNCHINELLO, each roaring at them to stop such a name as that, and attend to his suggestion,
and his only.

One did not like PUNCHINELLO because it means a "little Punch," and he--the speaking-trumpeter--liked
a great deal; and lo! while he spoke, he changed his trumpet for several horns. Then he was
taken with a fit of herpetology in his boots, and sank to advise no more.

Another--a fellow with an infinite fancy for buffo minstrelsy--was vociferous that PUNCHINELLO
should be called "Tommy Dodd." The discussion upon this lasted for three months; but finally,
"Tommy Dodd" was rejected on account of the superfluously aristocratic aroma that exhaled from
the name.

Four divisions of men with banners then came by, each division respectively composed of members
of the waning families of Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson, and each division bawled and thundered
that the name round which it rallied should be adopted instead of PUNCHINELLO, on pain of death.

And thousands of others came with suggestions of a like sort; for which some of them wanted
"stamps." And when they had all had their say, PUNCHINELLO was called PUNCHINELLO, and nothing
else--a name by which he means to stand or fall.

And now to business. PUNCHINELLO is not going to define his position here. He refrains from
boring his readers with prolix gammon about his foreign and domestic relations. He will content
himself (and readers, he hopes) by briefly mentioning that he has foreign and domestic relations
in every part of the habitable globe, and that they each and all furnish him with correspondence
of the most reliable and spicy character, regularly and for publication. Among his foreign
relations he is happy to reckon M. MEISSONNIER, the celebrated French artist, to whom he is
indebted for the original painting from which PUNCHINELLO, as he appears on his own title-page,
is taken.

A preface is not the place in which to enlarge upon topics of great humanitarian interest,
political importance, or social progress. PUNCHINELLO will merely touch a few of such matters,
then, and these with a light finger. (No allusion, here, to the "light-fingered gentry," for
whom PUNCHINELLO keeps a large grape vine in pickle.)

PUNCHINELLO observes the incipient tendency to return to specie payments. To this revival,
however, he is not as yet prepared to give his adhesion, though, on the whole, he considers
it preferable to relapsing fever, which is also noted on 'Change. Cuba shall have her due share
of attention from him. And if She-Cuba, (Queen of the Antilles, you know,) why not also He-Cuba?--lovely
and preposterous woman, who, from her eagerness to slip on certain habiliments that are masculine,
but shall here be nameless, shall henceforth be appropriately distinguished by that name.

Let other important topics take care of themselves. PUNCHINELLO will only add that he would
at any time rather suspend the public plunderers than habeas corpus, and that he means to take
the gloss off the grim joke that "Hanging for murder's played out in New-York."

It is pleasant for PUNCHINELLO to draw the attention of his readers to the fact that this,
his First Number, is dated April 2d--the day after All Fools' Day. This is cheering; since
thus it is manifest that PUNCHINELLO leaves all the fools and jesters behind, and is, therefore,
first in the race for the crown of comic laurel and the quiver of satiric shafts.

And now, by DAN PHOEBUS!--that's the DAN (ah!) that drives the Sun, you know, and is the biggest
spot upon it--here we find that we have talked ourself all the way to DELMONICO'S, and there's
CHARLEY on the lookout.

Punchinello: "Good evening, Mr. DELMONICO; have you any room for us?"

Delmonico: "You are very welcome, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, and your rooms are quite ready; for we have
been expecting you ever so long. Of course, your staff of artists can be accommodated in our
Drawing-room, if you will permit me to throw off so insignificant a joke."

Punchinello: "Tut, CHARLES!--'tis a joke of the first water, (first brandy-and-water, CHARLES.)
Cap your joke with another as good, and then consider yourself on our staff. Lead us to our
apartments, CHARLES."

And so, looking from his pleasant Fifth Avenue windows, PUNCHINELLO waves a salutation to his
audience with a "May you be happy, each and all of you, and live all your days in clover,"
(admission ten cents.)

PUNCHINELLO'S NEW CHARTER.

THE GREAT PLATFORM OF THE RINGS.

    The Lions and the Lambs lie down together,
    While the "Sun" stands still.

The People of the State of New-York, represented by PUNCHINELLO and his troop of admirers,
hereby enact:

§ 1. All the offices now provided by law with within the City and County of New-York, shall
be put in a grand grab-bag;

§ 2. It shall be the duty of the Commissioners of the Central Park to devote said Park, on
the Fourth day of July next, to the erection of poles (or polls) for the purpose of enabling
voters to grab from the grab-bag.

§ 3. HORACE GREELEY, PETER COOPER, the Rev. Dr. THOMPSON, DANIEL DREW, and REDDY THE BLACKSMITH,
are hereby constituted Inspectors and Canvassers for the grabbers.

§ 4. It shall be the duty of the said inspectors to prepare a registry-list of all the persons
intending to grab, who are required to serve a notice of intention through the post-office
upon REDDY THE BLACKSMITH, the Chairman. DANIEL DREW is to provide funds wherewith to pay the
postage.

§ 5. The registry-list shall be alphabetically prepared, and the number of chances shall be
determined by dividing the number of grabbers by the number of offices.

§ 6. The grabbers shall be selected by lot.

§ 7. The lots shall be drawn by REDDY THE BLACKSMITH from his own hat, his eyes wide open,
while every other inspector, and the voters, shall be blindfolded with newspapers from the
files of the Christian Union; whereupon, as the names of the fortunate grabbers are called,
each one shall proceed to the grab-bag and grab his office.

§ 8. There shall be no repeaters of the process.

§ 9. The persons thus grabbing offices shall be then and there, by the Inspectors, declared
duly elected to the offices grabbed, for life.

§ 10. Any vacancy occurring by assassination shall be immediately filled by the Inspectors
appointing the assassin.

§ 11. Every person owning real estate on the Island shall contribute one ninety-ninth part
of his income to the said grab-bag. On the following Christmas, in the presence of the grab
income-bents of offices, the Inspectors shall proceed to divide the proceeds of these taxable
contributions, and one half of these proceeds shall be equally divided among the grab income-bents
of offices. The other half shall be devoted to paving every conceivable surface of the city
with wooden pavement.

§ 12. Owners of real estate in the city of New York are hereby allowed to make their own arrangements
with the gas companies for the supply of light; but nothing herein shall be construed to devote
any part of the proceeds to light the public streets at night and real estate owners shall
be allowed to make their own arrangements for the supply of water with the grab income-bents
of the Croton Grab Board.

§ 13. The sewers of the city shall be converted to burial places for persons assassinated at
political meetings.

§ 14. Nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to permit any judge to grant an injunction
against any grabbers of the offices.

§ 15. The "dead-beats," heretofore known as policemen and soldiers of the first division, are
hereby legislated out of office, and it shall be a felony punishable with assassination for
any one to go unarmed with a six-shooter.

§ 16. All provisions of the United States or State constitutions inconsistent with the above
provisions are hereby repealed.

HINTS FOR THE FAMILY.

As it is intended that the mission of PUNCHINELLO shall be extended into all circles of society,
that of the family shall not be neglected. Every other weekly journal abounds in wise domestic
counsels, apt recipes, cunning plans, and helpful patterns of all sorts; and PUNCHINELLO, intending
to offer the most advantages, expects to become so necessary to the economical housewife and
the prudent bread-winner that no family will be able to do without him. So, with no further
prologue, we will present our readers with some valuable hints in regard to the use that can
be made of things that often lie about the house gathering dust--idle clutter and of no service
to any body. The first hint, we know, if followed up, will be found of the greatest advantage
to all, yielding great measure of convenience at little cost. Take a wide board--as wide as
you can get it--and as long as it will cut without cracks or knotholes, and saw the ends off
square. Then bore four large holes in the corners, and insert the ends of four sticks, each
about three feet long. Place it upon the floor, so that the board will be supported by the
sticks, thus:

This contrivance will be found very useful for various purposes. It will do to put books upon,
to write upon, to iron clothes upon, and for any other purpose where it is considered desirable
to support household objects at a distance from the floor. One of its chief advantages is to
serve as a receptacle for the food of a family during meals. If on such occasions it be covered
with a white linen or cotton cloth, its appearance will be much improved, and in time it can
not fail to become a favorite article of furniture.

The next hint will please the ladies. Take two pieces of cotton or woolen cloth, of any size
from two inches to a foot square, and sew them together at the edges, leaving, however, a small
place unsewed at one corner. You will now find that you have something like a square bag. This
is to be tightly filled with wool, bran, mowings, clippings of human hair, or something of
the kind, and the open corner is then to be sewed up. When finished, the affair will assume
this appearance and will be found very useful for the preservation of pins. The manner of using
it is as follows: you take the pin in the hand and firmly press it into the bag, when it will
be found that the body of the pin will easily enter, but that the head will prevent its entire
disappearance. The stuffing of the bag will retain the pin in its position until a slight degree
of force is used to withdraw it. With the use of this ingenious little contrivance, pins can
be kept in safety with the points always hidden and their heads exposed to view. It will be
found much more economical and convenient than the plan of carrying pins loose in the pocket,
and eventually will be generally adopted, we think. The top and corners can be ornamented à
discrétion.

Hint the third is especially addressed to country families. Take one of the ordinary toilet-tables
that are to be found in so many rural habitations, and, on removing the white cover, you will
probably find that the table is formed of an empty flour-barrel with a board nailed on top
of it. Remove this board; get a head from another barrel of the same size; place it properly
upon the top; put some good hoops around the ends, nail it all up tightly, and you will find
that you will have a very good barrel.

THE MARINER'S WRONGS.

Within the memories of men who are not yet old, the sailor was always looked upon and talked
about as "a jolly dog." There was a glamour of romance about him when he was at sea, and "JACK
ashore" was for ages held up as the presentment of all that was happy, and contented, and free
from care. His hardest duty was supposed to be shinning up the ratlin to "reef," or "brail
up," or "splice the mainbrace," or do some other of those mysterious things that caused him
to look so mythical to the minds of land-lubbers and the simple-hearted kind of women that
used to be, but now no longer are. His lighter hours (about eighteen out of the twenty-four)
were passed in terpsichorean performances on the "fo'k'sl," and were so fascinating to the
shorey mind that music was specially composed for them, and the "Sailor's Hornpipe" is one
of the scourges inflicted upon mortals, for their sins, by barrel-organists at the present
day. Grog was dealt out to him by the gallon, and, as for "backy," the light-hearted fellow
was never allowed to suffer for want of that; so that his happiness may be said to have been
complete.

Things are sadly changed, now, with regard to poor JACK. Every day we read of outrageous assaults
upon him with marline-spikes and other perverted marine stores, by brutal skippers and flagitious
mates, whose proper end would be the yard-arm and the rope's end. All belaying-pin and no pay
has made JACK a dull boy. His windpipe refuses to furnish the whilom exhilarating tooraloo
for his hornpipe. Silent are the "yarns" with which he used to while away the time when off
his watch and huddling under the lee of the capstan with his messmates. And then, when he comes
ashore, it is only to be devoured by the sharks that lie in wait for him and drag him away
bodily to their obscene "boarding-house" dens.

Once on a time JACK, when in dock, used to make holiday of it on Sunday. He looked as gay as
a tobacconist's sign when rigged out in his best blue for a lark ashore, where he was occasionally
to be seen on horseback with a row of his jovial messmates, all of them sitting with their
backs to the horse's head, and the sternmost of them steering the bewildered animal by his
tail. Now there seems to be a movement to cut off from JACK even the holiday to which he is
surely entitled. The captain of a bark, lying at San Francisco, has lately stopped wages, to
the amount of sixty-five dollars, from a seaman, because the latter refused to assist in discharging
cargo on Sunday. Blue has, in one sense, always been JACK's favorite color; but if this sort
of thing goes on much further, he must become bluer than ever, and his cheerless condition
will be such that he will not have a cheer left to shake the welkin with when he helps to man
the yards.

The Plays and Shows.

HAMLET--WITH A YELLOW WIG.

The poet--his name is of no consequence--has defined the evening as

"The close of the day when the HAMLET is still."

Evidently he was a bucolic, and not a metropolitan poet. Otherwise he would have remembered
that the close of the day, or, to speak with mathematical accuracy, the hour of eight P.M.,
is precisely the time when the HAMLET of a well-regulated theatrical community begins to make
himself vocally prominent. A few nights since, we had no less than three HAMLETS propounding
at the same time the unnecessary question, whether to be or not to be is the correct thing.
The serious HAMLET of the eagle eye, and the burlesque HAMLET of the vulpine nose, are with
us yet; but the rival of the latter, the HAMLET of the taurine neck, has gone to Boston, where
his wiggish peculiarity will he better appreciated than it was in this Democratic city.

The late Mr. WEGG prided himself upon being a literary man--with a wooden leg. Mr. FECHTER
aspires to be a HAMLET--with a yellow wig. Mr. WEGG had this advantage over Mr. FECHTER, that
his literary ability did not wholly depend upon his ligneous leg. Mr. FECHTER'S HAMLET, on
the contrary, owes its existence solely to his wig. The key to his popularity must he sought
in his yellow locks.

There are, it is true, meritorious points in Mr. FECHTER'S Dane. One is his skill in fencing;
another, the fact that he finally suffers himself to be killed. Unfortunately, this latter
redeeming incident takes place only in the last scene of the play, and the Fat Prince has therefore
abundant previous opportunity to mar the superb acting of Miss LECLERCQ. Why this admirable
artist did not insist that her OPHELIA should receive a better support than was furnished by
Messrs. BANGS, LEVICK, and FECHTER, at Niblo's Garden, is an insoluble mystery. She must have
perceived the absurdity of drowning herself for a Prince--fair, fat, and faulty--who refused
to give her a share of his "loaf," and denied, with an evident eye to a possible breach of
promise suit, that he had given her any "bresents."

That Mr. FECHTER speaks English imperfectly is, however, the least of his defects. If he could
not speak at all, his audience would have reason for self-congratulation. We might, too, forget
that he is an obese, round-shouldered, short-necked, and eminently beery HAMLET, with a tendency
to speak through his nose. But how can we overlook his incapacity to express the subtle changes
of HAMLET'S ever questioning mind? One of his admirers has recently quoted RUSKIN in his support.
MR. FECHTER gives no heed to RUSKIN'S axiom, that all true art is delicate art. There is no
delicacy in his conception of HAMLET. True, he is impulsive and sensitive; but this is due
to his physical and not to his mental organization. A HAMLET without delicacy is quite as intolerable
a spectacle as a Grande Duchesse without decency.

What, then, has given him his reputation? The answer is evident;--His yellow wig. NAPOLEON
gilded the dome of the Invalides, and the Parisians forgot to murmur at the arbitrary acts
of his reign. Mr. FECHTER crowns himself with a golden wig, and the public forgets to murmur
at the five acts of his HAMLET.

In all other respects Mr. FECHTER'S HAMLET is inferior to that of his rival Mr. FOX. It is
not nearly as funny, and it is much less impressive. Both actors are wrong, however, in not
omitting the graveyard scene. To make a burlesque of Death is to unlawfully invade the province
of Messrs. BEECHER and FROTHINGHAM.

The popularity of Mr. FECHTER is only a new proof of the potency of yellow hair. It is the
yellow hair of the British blonde, joined to that kindliness of disposition with which--like
a personification of Charity--she "bareth all things," that makes her a thing of beauty in
the eyes of R.G.W., and a joy for as many seasons as her hair will keep its color. It is because
Mr. FECHTER decided that the hair presumptive of the Royal Dane must have been yellow, that
his name has grown famous in England.

The veracious chronicler relates that, on one occasion, Mr. VENUS deprived his literary friend
with a wooden leg of that useful appendage. But that act of constructive mayhem did not destroy
Mr. WEGG'S literary reputation. Can MR. FECHTER'S HAMLET endure an analogous test? If he has
confidence in himself, let him try it. He has gone to BOSTON for a change of air. When he returns
to NEW-YORK, let it be for a change of hair. When he succeeds in drawing full houses to see
him play HAMLET with raven curls, we shall believe that he is something more than simply a
HAMLET--with a yellow wig. Until then we shall be constrained to class him with the other blonde
burlesquers.

MATADOR.

THE BALLAD OF CAPTAIN EYRE,

OF THE PACIFIC AND ORIENTAL STEAMSHIP "BOMBAY."

    My name was ARTHUR EYRE, when I sailed,
    When I sailed;
    My name was ARTHUR EYRE, when I sailed;
    My name was ARTHUR EYRE, a true British snob, I swear,
    Who for Yankees didn't care, as I sailed.

    I'd been taught at 'ome, per'aps, ere I sailed,
    Ere I sailed;
    I'd been taught at 'ome, per'aps, ere I sailed;
    I'd been taught at 'ome, per'aps, that JOHN BULL his fingers snaps
    At the "cussed Yankee chaps," ere I sailed.

    So I steered across the seas, as I sailed,
    As I sailed;
    I steered across the seas, as I sailed;
    I steered across the seas, and swilled my hale at hease;
    I was master, "if you please," as I sailed.

    VICTORIA'S flag I flew, as I sailed,
    As I sailed;
    VICTORIA'S flag I flew, as I sailed;
    VICTORIA'S flag I flew, and wore her colors too,
    Like a British sailor true, as I sailed.

    Off the shore of far Japan, as I sailed,
    As I sailed;
    Off the shore of far Japan, as I sailed;
    Off the shore of far Japan, I a Yankee ship did scan,
    That with helm a-starboard ran, as I sailed.

    A curse rose to my lip, as I sailed,
    As I sailed;
    A curse rose to my lip, as I sailed;
    A curse rose to my lip as on the Yankee ship
    Through the darkness I did slip, as I sailed.

    And I ran the Yankee down, as I sailed,
    As I sailed;
    And I ran the Yankee down, as I sailed;
    Ay, I ran the Yankee down, and I left the dogs to drown,
    While to Yokohama town on I sailed.

    They say they showed a light, as I sailed,
    As I sailed;
    They say they showed a light, as I sailed;
    They say they showed a light, to tell their hopeless plight,
    But "I served them bloody right," as I sailed!

    For my name is Captain EYRE, as I sail,
    As I sail;
    My name is Captain EYRE, as I sail;
    For my name is Captain EYRE, and it's d-----d absurd, I swear,
    That for Yankees I should care, as I sail!

PUNCHINELLO IN WALL STREET.

That it is not PUNCHINELLO'S intention to overlook Wall street, may be absolutely taken at
par. To look over Wall street is quite another matter, and P. knows how to do it to a T. Many
a time at midnight, from his perch on the tip of the spire of Old Trinity, (a tip-top point
from which to look over Wall street--you see the point?) has PUNCHINELLO beheld the ghosts
of dead speculations floating hopelessly through the murky air. It could not be said of them
that there was "no speculation in those eyes." The ghost of a dead speculation was never so
utterly damned, the eyes of a ghost of a dead speculation were never so absolutely dimmed,
but that speculation of some kind might be discerned fluttering like a mummy-cloth from the
shadowy outline of the former, and gleaming feebly from the gloomy goggles of the latter. Gleam
on, poor ghosts! Goggle while you may, and gibber. PUNCHINELLO watches you with interest, (25
per cent.,) as you are weighed down to the very dirt of The Street by the night-fog of Despair,
flapping your wings on a very small "margin," as if attempting vainly to "operate for a rise."
Go down, poor ghosts; repair to your incandescent place below, for there is no hope for you.
As we sit here upon our spire, we can not say to you, Dum spiramus speramus. Alas! no. We would
like to do so, of course; but our sense of truth revolts against the enunciation of such a
taradiddle.
