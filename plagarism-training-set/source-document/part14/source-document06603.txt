Dedication.

TO ROBERT TOOMBS DU BOSE, WHOSE INTEREST AND AID WERE INVALUABLE, AND WITHOUT WHOSE COÖPERATION
THE BIOGRAPHY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREPARED, THIS WORK IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.

      "There are courageous and honest men enough in both
      sections to fight. There is no question of courage
      involved. The people of both sections of this Union have
      illustrated their courage on too many battlefields to be
      questioned. They have shown their fighting qualities
      shoulder to shoulder whenever their country has called upon
      them; but that they may never come in contact with each
      other in fratricidal war, should be the ardent wish of
      every true man and honest patriot."--Robert Toombs, Speech
      in U. S. Senate, 1856.
