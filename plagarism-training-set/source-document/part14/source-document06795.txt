§ 69. As the relative dates and proportions of chancel chapels vary so greatly, it is obvious
that in many cases only one will be found. We frequently meet with churches which have only
one aisle to the nave; but these are for the most part small buildings, and one aisle usually,
in larger buildings, presupposes another, although symmetry of proportion need not be expected.
However, many important churches have one chancel chapel, and no more. Raunds in Northamptonshire,
and Leverington in Cambridgeshire, have south, but not north, chapels. Stanion in Northamptonshire,
and Hullavington in Wiltshire, have north, but not south chapels. In both these last cases,
the chapels are simply continuations of the aisles, without a break or intermediate arch; and
the chapel at Stanion is neither more nor less than a second chancel. As the dedication of
Stanion church is to St Peter and St Paul, it is not unlikely that the prominence given to
the north chapel may be due to the provision of altars for both saints. The same consideration
may have influenced the building of the church at Wisbech, which is also dedicated to St Peter
and St Paul. Here, the twelfth century chancel had a south chapel; but when, at the end of
the thirteenth century, the chancel was lengthened, the south chapel was also enlarged into
what is practically a second chancel. Not only this, but the south aisle of the church was
rebuilt on the scale of a second nave, a second south aisle was built out beyond it, and the
whole church, which afterwards was enlarged towards the north and otherwise altered, was more
than doubled in size.

§ 70. Where chantry chapels are attached to one side or other of a chancel, their variations
in size and plan are almost infinite. In the smallest examples, they are mere projections from
the wall of the chancel, and little more than tomb recesses, such as the Cresacre chapel at
Barnburgh, near Rotherham, or the Booth chapel on the south side of the chancel at Sawley in
Derbyshire. The little north chapel of the chancel at Clapton-in-Gordano in Somerset may have
served as a vestry. At Brancepeth, near Durham, where there is a long chancel and an aisled
nave with transeptal chapels, a south chantry chapel adjoins the east side of the south transeptal
chapel, while a north chantry chapel forms an independent excrescence from the north wall,
and is shut off from the chancel by a doorway. Brigstock in Northamptonshire has a very large
north chancel chapel, which is virtually the eastern portion of a widened aisle: the south
chapel, on the other hand, is of much later date, and is so small that there must have been
room in it for an altar and little more. These smaller chantry chapels, like the beautiful
south chapel at Aldwinkle All Saints, Northants, have often great architectural beauty of their
own, and give great variety to the plan of the church. But chancel chapels are often larger
and more important, like the fourteenth century south chapel at Leverton, near Boston, which
is practically a separate building, separated from the chancel by a wall without an arcade,
or like the very spacious north chapel of the priory church at Brecon. The south chapel of
the chancel at Berkeley in Gloucestershire, and the Clopton chapel at Long Melford in Suffolk,
are shut off from the adjacent parts of the church, and belong to that class of chantry chapel
of which our cathedrals furnish many examples. In this case, the chapel is a small separate
building, attached to the fabric of the church, but hardly forming an integral part of it.

§ 71. One very important consequence of the addition of aisles and chantry chapels to chancels,
at any rate on a large scale, is seen where they are applied to plans originally cruciform.
We have already seen that at St Mary's, Shrewsbury, and at Arksey, although much of the fabric
of the old transepts was left, broad chancel chapels tended to obliterate the cruciform character
of the building. The transepts at Spalding almost escape notice, owing to the double aisle
on the south side of the nave, the aisle and north chapel on the opposite side, and the large
chapel east of the south transept. Moreover, when, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
aisles were rebuilt or widened, there was always, as at Tansor, a tendency to decide the width
of the aisle by the length of an existing transept or transeptal chapel, and to build the new
outer wall flush with its gable wall. In this case, the aisle would be planned to communicate
with the transept, and the west wall of the transept would have to be cut through. Where, as
at Arksey, there was a central tower, the old transept was structurally necessary, and only
as much of its masonry would be removed as was absolutely necessary. But we have seen that
there were cases in which it was thought advisable to take down the central tower altogether,
and build a new one at the west end, in which case the transepts were of no structural use;
and there were far more cases in which the transeptal excrescences were merely projecting chapels.
In these instances, the transept was felt to intervene awkwardly between the aisles of nave
and chancel. Accordingly, its side walls and gabled roof were taken down, its end wall was
remodelled, and it was placed under one roof with the adjacent aisles, in which it became merged.
The cruciform plan was thus lost in certain churches, becoming absorbed in the ordinary elongated
plan, with aisles to nave and chancel. Tamworth church in Staffordshire, and Marshfield in
Gloucestershire, had twelfth century central towers. These were removed or destroyed, at Tamworth
in the fourteenth, at Marshfield in the fifteenth century, and the aisles and chancel chapels
were widened to the original length, approximately, of the transepts. The north and south arches
of the crossing, however, remain in a blocked condition, and tell the tale of what has happened.
Wakefield cathedral is another instance of a large parish church whose aisleless cruciform
plan has gradually disappeared within the aisles, until the plan is--or was till the additions
of a few years ago--an aisled rectangle, the origin of which is certainly not obvious at first
sight. The transformations here described must clearly be understood not to apply to cruciform
churches generally, but merely to churches which, with an originally cruciform plan, needed
enlargement. Many handsome late Gothic buildings, like the churches of Rotherham and Chesterfield,
or St Mary's at Nottingham, are regular cruciform churches with central towers; and sometimes,
as at Newark, transeptal chapels were the latest of all additions to a church. But, where the
transeptal chapel cramped necessary space, it had to disappear. At St Margaret's, Leicester,
the arches into the transeptal chapels remain; but the chapels themselves have entirely disappeared,
and the arches merely form part of the arcade between the nave and its broad aisles.

§ 72. The aim of restorers and rebuilders from the middle of the fourteenth century onwards
was to convert the church into a rectangle with aisles. As we have seen, the chancel was constantly,
in late Gothic churches, an aisleless projection from the main fabric; but, where it was aisled,
the old haphazard methods were often abandoned, and the aisles were made of approximately equal
size. The old distinction between nave and chancel, marked by the chancel arch, and the arches
between chapels and aisles, begin to vanish. Where the chancel arch was kept, as at Long Sutton
in Lincolnshire, new chancel chapels were prolonged westward on each side of the nave, in place
of the old nave aisles. Fairford church in Gloucestershire was rebuilt towards the end of the
fifteenth century, to contain the splendid stained glass which had just been acquired for it.
A central tower was built on strong piers, as a concession to the old plan; but the aisles
of the nave were continued on either side of the tower and along the sides of the chancel till
within a bay of the east end. But, in a great many churches, not merely the aisles, but the
nave and chancel also became continuous, without a structural division. This feature, common
in East Anglia and the south-west of England, was the result of the importance of carved and
painted wood-work in late Gothic churches. The rood screen, stretching across nave and aisles,
appeared to full advantage, when unbroken by the chancel arch. The splendid timber roofs of
nave and aisles gained in effect, if they formed, as at Southwold, or in the churches of Norwich,
an unbroken covering to the church from end to end. In Norfolk and Suffolk, where the work
of rebuilding began in the fourteenth century, as at Cawston, Worstead, or Tunstead, the chancel
arch was often kept. At Worstead and other Norfolk churches the method pursued by the builders
was precisely opposite to that which we have seen employed by Gloucestershire masons at Cirencester
and other places, and may see in most of the fifteenth century churches of Somerset. The arcades
were rebuilt first, and the aisles followed. Many of these churches were doubtless enlarged
from much smaller buildings. The south aisle at Ingham was probably the nave of the earlier
church, to which the present nave, north aisle, chancel, and west tower, were added. The aisles
in most cases continued at a uniform width eastward as chancel chapels. The north aisle at
Worstead was continued by a two-storied sacristy to the level of the east wall of the chancel.
The south aisle stops at a bay short of the east wall, leaving the end of the chancel projecting
as an altar space. Whether the chancel arch was retained or not, the projection of this aisleless
eastern bay became a very general feature of the larger churches of East Anglia, and, in churches
like Trunch, Southwold, and Clare, its tall side windows flood the space with light The most
striking example of this plan is at Long Melford in Suffolk, where there is no chancel arch,
and the actual chancel projects beyond the aisles. Here, however, it is flanked on the north
by the Clopton chapel, and on the south by the vestry, which forms a covered way to the detached
lady chapel further east. The Long Melford plan, with a projecting altar space, and without
a chancel arch, is nearly universal in Cornwall, and is common in south Devon, where, as at
Totnes, the aisles of the chancel are usually little more than comparatively short chapels,
and sometimes, as at West Alvington, near Kingsbridge, extend only a bay beyond the screen.
Its great advantages, apart from the display of wood-work which it permits, are the gain of
internal space permitted by the reduction of the solid portions of the building to a minimum,
the additional light admitted by the same means, and the long uninterrupted clerestory which
forms a wall of glass, with thin stone divisions, on each side of the upper part of the church.

§ 73. The tendency to give the whole church aisles of equal width throughout, and extending
along its whole length, was irresistible, especially in East Anglia. The church of North Walsham,
rebuilt towards the end of the fourteenth century, is a great rectangle of three parallel divisions,
with axes from east to west, and of nearly equal breadth. The chapel of St Nicholas at Lynn,
rebuilt in 1419, is an even more striking example of the same design: in both cases the simple
and somewhat monotonous plan is varied by the projection of a handsome south porch. At Lynn,
the thirteenth century west tower, with a spire, was kept at the south-west corner of the aisled
building. But the aisled rectangular plan, if it attained its highest development in East Anglia,
had been reached already in other parts of England by gradual methods. It has sometimes been
fathered upon aisled naves of friary churches, which, like the great nave of the Black friars
at Norwich, afforded space for large congregations who came to hear sermons. But it is probable
that the first churches which followed the course of expansion into the aisled rectangle were
directly influenced by the example of the larger churches, like Lincoln, or, at a later date,
York, which, in extending their eastern arms, aisled their quires, presbyteries, and eastern
chapels, right up to the east wall. Thus the whole quire and chancel of Newark, with aisles
extending their whole length, were planned in the early part of the fourteenth century, when
the great eastern chapel, the "Angel Quire," of Lincoln, was little more than a generation
old; and, although the progress of the work was long delayed, the eventual arrangement, in
which the high altar was brought two bays forward from the east wall, and a spacious chapel
was left at the back, exactly recalls the arrangements of Lincoln and York. Similarly the quire
and chancel of the cruciform church of Holy Trinity at Hull are aisled to their full length:
the arrangement, again, is that of a cathedral rather than a parish church. The influence of
cathedral plans is clearly visible in St Mary Redcliffe at Bristol, and in the collegiate churches
of Ottery St Mary and Crediton: but here the type followed is not that of Lincoln and York,
but that more usual in the west and south of England at Hereford, Wells, Salisbury, Exeter,
and elsewhere, where the aisles of the chancel are returned at the back of the east wall, and
form a vestibule to a projecting aisleless lady chapel. This type of plan occurs outside its
regular district at Tickhill, on the borders of Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. But it is naturally
exceptional, and would be used only where there was plenty of money and space to spare: it
demands for its full effect a considerable elevation, involving a large clerestory, and a church
could seldom, if ever, be found whose original plan invited expansion on these lines. On the
other hand, the aisling of the chancel throughout was simply the logical development of the
ordinary church plan: if the plans of cathedrals may have suggested the later developments
at churches like Newark or Hull, the simple aisled rectangle, with its three parallel divisions,
and without any clerestory to distinguish the nave from the aisles--a plan remarkably characteristic
of Cornwall--came into existence in the ordinary course of things, by an extension of the wings
of the building until they flanked the whole of the nave and chancel.

§ 74. The work done at Grantham in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries illustrates the purely
natural development of the ordinary aisled church into the aisled rectangle. We have seen,
in an earlier chapter, that, soon after 1300, the church consisted of an aisleless chancel,
which was, however, overlapped at the west end by the north aisle of the nave; a nave, the
north and south aisles of which followed different systems of spacing; a western tower and
spire, engaged within the aisles; and north and south porches. Several chantries were founded
in the church during the fourteenth century. Not long after the Black Death of 1349, the south
aisle was extended eastward to the whole length of the chancel. The south wall of the chancel
was pierced by an arcade; and the lady chapel thus formed was raised upon a double crypt. It
was not until more than a century later that the east wall of the north aisle was taken down,
and the "Corpus Christi chancel" built out, continuing the north aisle without a break, and
completely flanking the north wall of the chancel, through which an arcade was made. Here the
reason of expansion was obviously the growth of chantry chapels; and the expansion follows
the simplest course. The last addition to the fabric was the present vestry, in which was a
chantry founded by the Hall family. This was built out at right angles to the north aisle,
at the point where the old work was met by the later extension. Not until the church had been
fully aisled, and afforded no further room for new altars, were chantry chapels usually added
in the shape of excrescences from the fabric.

§ 75. One interesting feature in the planning of chancels, which has been much discussed, is
worth a note. This is the fact that the axis of the chancel is frequently out of line with
the axis of the nave, and generally has a slight northward inclination. Sometimes, as at Henbury
in Gloucestershire, the inclination is very considerable, so that, from the west end of the
church, nearly a quarter of the east wall is out of sight. Usually, the inclination is very
slight; and there are many cases in which it is not northward, but southward--Sidbury and Salcombe
Regis, near Sidmouth, Eastbourne in Sussex and Aldwinkle St Peter in Northants, are cases in
point. The popular explanation is that it symbolises the leaning of our Saviour's head upon
the cross. Like most symbolical explanations, this is founded entirely upon fancy: the inclination
is by no means confined to churches with cross plans, and, if it were, the theorists who argue
from this standpoint confound the symbolism of the cross-plan between the cross itself and
the Body which it bore. Others have sought to explain the phenomenon by suggesting that the
orientation of the chancel followed the direction in which the sun rose on the morning of the
patronal feast. A succession of visits at sunrise to churches on appropriate dates has not
hitherto been attempted upon a comprehensive scale: if it were undertaken, it probably would
be found that the sun, instead of rising obediently opposite the middle light of every east
window, as the theory requires, would have many puzzling exceptions in reserve. The marked
divergence of axis at Henbury is explained by the site of the building, which is on a gentle
slope, with the axis of the nave distinctly from south-east to north-west. When the chancel
was rebuilt in the thirteenth century, the masons kept as high upon the slope as they could,
and so twisted the axis of the chancel a little further east. But we must also remember that,
when chancels were lengthened and rebuilt, the work was done while the old chancels were still
standing. The axis of the old chancel might be out of line with that of the nave. Unless very
careful measurements were taken, the new east wall would probably be not quite parallel with
the old east wall of the chancel. The side walls would be set out at right angles to the new
east wall; and thus, when the new chancel was joined to the church, the divergence of axis
would be more palpable than before. Or, for the same reason, a divergence of axis might be
created for the first time. This seems to be the common sense explanation of a very common
feature. But it must be added that there are instances in which the inclination is so decided
that one is tempted to conclude either that the masons had very crooked sight, or that they
were playing tricks with their perspective. The feature, where it is at all marked, is something
of a deformity. In our own day it has been introduced, apparently by design, into the plan
of Truro cathedral. In medieval work, however, it will seldom be found in a chancel where no
enlargement upon an early site has taken place; and it seems safe to conclude that, like so
much else in medieval building which is irregular, it generally arises from the rebuilding
of a fabric upon an encumbered site.
