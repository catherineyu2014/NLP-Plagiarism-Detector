[224] Almost all beginners have an unfortunate tendency to wander off into superfluous digressions,
to amass reflections and pieces of information which have no relevance to the main subject;
they would recognise, if they reflected, that the causes of this tendency are bad taste, a
kind of naïve vanity, sometimes mental confusion.

[225] We meet with declarations like the following: "I have been long familiar with the documents
of this period and this class. I have an impression that such and such conclusions, which I
cannot prove, are true." Of two things one: either the author can give the reasons for his
impression, and then we can judge them, or he cannot give them, and we may assume that he has
none of serious value.

[226] This difference has a tendency to disappear. The most recent alphabetical collections
of historical facts (the Realencyclopædie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft of Pauly-Wissowa,
the Dictionnaire des antiquités of Daremberg and Saglio, the Dictionary of National Biography
of Leslie Stephen and Sidney Lee) are furnished with a sufficiently ample apparatus. It is
principally in biographical dictionaries that the custom of giving no proofs tends to persist;
see the Allgemeine deutsche Biographie, &c.

[227] Revue Critique, 1874, i. p. 327.

[228] The custom of appending to "histories," that is to narratives of political events, summaries
of the results obtained by the special historians of art, literature, &c., still persists.
A "History of France" would not be considered complete if it did not contain chapters on the
history of art, literature, manners, &c., in France. However, it is not the summary account
of special evolutions, described at second hand from the works of specialists, which is in
its proper place in a scientific "History"; it is the study of those general facts which have
dominated the special evolutions in their entirety.

[229] It is hard to imagine what it is possible for the most interesting and best established
results of modern criticism to become, in the hands of negligent and unskilful popularisers.
The persons who know most of these possibilities are those who have occasion to read the improvised
"compositions" of candidates in history examinations: the ordinary defects of inferior popularisation
are here pushed sometimes to an absurd length.

["Past times are to us a book with seven seals. What you call the spirit of the times is at
bottom your own spirit, in which the times are mirrored."--Goethe, Faust, i. 3.]

[232] A saying attributed to a "Sorbonne professor" by M. de la Blanchère (Revue Critique,
1895, i. p. 176). Others have declaimed on the theme that the knowledge of history is mischievous
and paralyses. See F. Nietzsche, Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen, II. Nutzen und Nachtheil der
Historie für das Leben, Leipzig, 1874, 8vo.

[233] History and the social sciences are mutually dependent on each other; they progress in
parallel lines by a continual interchange of services. The social sciences furnish a knowledge
of the present, required by history for the purpose of making representations of the facts
and reasoning from documents. History gives the information about evolutions which is necessary
in order to understand the present.

[234] The same institution has been adopted in German-speaking countries under the name of
Leitfaden (guiding-thread), and in English-speaking countries under the name of Text-book.

[235] We must make an exception of Michelet's Précis de l'histoire moderne, and do Duruy the
justice to acknowledge that in his school-books, even in the first editions, he has endeavoured,
often successfully, to make his narratives both interesting and instructive.

[236] For a criticism of this method, see above, p. 265.

[237] The most complete, and probably the most accurate, account of the state of the secondary
teaching of history after the reforms has been given by a Spaniard, R. Altamira, La Enseñanza
de la historia, 2nd edition, Madrid, 1895, 8vo.

[238] We are here treating only of France. But, in order to dispel an illusion of the French
public, we may remark that historical pedagogy is still less advanced in English-speaking countries,
where the methods used are still mechanical, and even in German-speaking countries, where it
is hampered by the conception of patriotic teaching.

[239] I have endeavoured, in a course of lectures at the Sorbonne, to do a part of this work.--[Ch.
S.]

[240] Let it be noted, however, that to the question put to the candidates for the modern Baccalaureate
in July 1897, "What purpose is served by the teaching of history?" eighty per cent. of the
candidates answered, in effect, either because they believed it, or because they thought it
would please, "To promote patriotism."--[C. V. L.]

[241] This is what has been produced in Germany under the name of Quellenbuch.

[242] The same pedagogic theory will be found in the preface to my Histoire narrative et descriptive
des anciens peuples de l'Orient, Supplement for the use of professors, Paris, 1890, 8vo.--[Ch. S.]

[243] I have treated this question in the Revue universitaire, 1896, vol. i.--[Ch. S.]

[244] On the organisation of higher education in France at this epoch and on the first reforms,
see the excellent work of M. L. Liard, l'Enseignement supérieur en France, Paris, 1888-94,
