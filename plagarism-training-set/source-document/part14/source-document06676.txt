PREFACE.

The following pages may truthfully be said to be the result of labours, extending over many
years, and of researches in directions too many to tell.

Born within almost a mile of Horncastle, and only by a few months escaping being born in it,
since his father, on first coming to the neighbourhood, resided for a time in Horncastle, {0}
the author, from his earliest years (except for periodical absences) has been connected with
the life, social or civil, of the place, probably more closely and more continuously, than
any other person living, in like circumstances.

The notes on which this compilation is based were begun more than 30 years ago.  While writing
a volume of Records of more than 30 Parishes around Horncastle, published in 1904; and, before
that, while describing about as many more, in a volume, Woodhall Spa and Neighbourhood, published
in 1899, he had constantly in view the crowning of the series, by the history of the old town,
round which these sixty, or more, parishes cluster; the haunt, if not quite the home, of his
boyhood, and familiarized to him by a life-long connection.

For this purpose sources of information have been tapped in every possible direction; of public
institutions, the official records, and title deeds, where available, have been carefully consulted;
especially should be here mentioned various deeds and charters, which are quoted in Chapter
II, from the archives of Carlisle Cathedral, which have not hitherto been brought before the
public, but of which the author has been allowed free use, through the courtesy of the librarian.
These are of special value, from the long connection of the Manor of Horncastle with the See
of Carlisle.

In other cases the author has been allowed the privilege of more private testimony; for instance,
his old friend, the late Mr. John Overton (of a highly respectable family, for generations
connected with the town and county), has most kindly given him the use of various family MS.
notes, bearing on parish and other matters.  Mr. Henry Sharp has freely assisted him with most
varied information, derived from long years of connection with the town, in public or private
capacity.  The late Mr. Henry Boulton, ancestrally connected with various parts of the county,
was remarkable for a mind stored with memories of persons and things, in town and neighbourhood,
which he freely communicated to the author, who saw much of him in his later years.  While,
last but not least, the late Mr. William Pacey, whether in his “Reminisences of Horncastle,”
which he contributed to the public newspapers, or in his personal conversations, which the
present writer enjoyed for many years, yielded up to him treasure, collected by an indefatigable
student of local lore, who entered into such work con amore.

To all these the author would now fully, and gratefully, acknowledge his indebtedness; but
for them this work could not have been produced in anything like its present fulness.  In some
of the matters dealt with, as for instance in the accounts of the Grammar School, as well as
in other portions, he may fairly say, in the language of “the pious Æneas” (slightly modified),
“quorum pars (ipse) fui,” (Æneid ii, 6); and in these he has drawn not a few of the details
from his own recollections.

In stringing these records together, of such varied character, and on subjects so numerous,
he cannot but be conscious that, in the endeavour to give all possible information, and to
omit nothing of real interest, he may, on the other hand, have laid himself open to the charge
of being too diffuse, or even needlessly prolix.  Others not sharing his own interest in the
subjects treated of, may think that he has occasionally “ridden his hobby too hard.”  If this
should be the judgment of any of his readers, he would crave their indulgence out of consideration
for the motive.

These are the days of historic “Pageants,” drawn from life, and with living actors to illustrate
them.  We have also our “Gossoping Guides,” to enable the tourist to realize more fully the
meaning of the scenes which he visits.  From both of these the author “has taken his cue.”
He had to cater for a variety of tastes; and while, for the general reader he has cast his
discriptions in a colloquial, or even at times in a “gossoping,” form, he believes that the
old town, with its “Bull Ring,” its “Maypole Hill,” its “Fighting Cocks,” its “Julian Bower,”
and other old time memories, can still afford pabulum for the more educated student, or the
special antiquary.

Like the composer of a Pageant play, his endeavour has been rather to clothe the scenes, which
he conjures up, with the flesh and blood of quickened reality, than in the bare skin and bones
of a dry-as-dust’s rigid skeleton.  How far he has succeeded in this he leaves to others to
decide; for himself he can honestly say, that it has not been from lack of care, enquiry, or
labour, if he has fallen short of the ideal aimed at.

CHAPTER I.

PART I—PREHISTORIC.  HORNCASTLE—ITS INFANCY.

In dealing with what may be called “the dark ages” of local history, we are often compelled
to be content with little more than reasonable conjecture.  Still, there are generally certain
surviving data, in place-names, natural features, and so forth, which enable those who can
detect them, and make use of them, to piece together something like a connected outline of
what we may take, with some degree of probability, as an approximation to what have been actual
facts, although lacking, at the time, the chronicler to record them.

It is, however, by no means a mere exercise of the imagination, if we assume that the site
of the present Horncastle was at a distant period a British settlement. {1a}  Dr. Brewer says,
“nearly three-fourths of our Roman towns were built on British sites,” (Introduction to Beauties
of England, p. 7), and in the case of Horncastle, although there is nothing British in the
name of the town itself, yet that people have undoubtedly here left their traces behind them.
The late Dr. Isaac Taylor {1b} says, “Rivers and mountains, as a rule, receive their names
from the earliest races, towns and villages from later colonists.”  The ideas of those early
occupants were necessarily limited.  The hill which formed their stronghold against enemies,
{1c} or which was the “high place” of their religious rites, {1d} and the river which was so
essential to their daily existence, of these they felt the value, and therefore naturally distinguished
them by name before anything else.  Thus the remark of an eloquent writer is generally true,
who says “our mountains and rivers still murmur the voices of races long extirpated.”  “There
is hardly (says Dr. Taylor {2a}) throughout the whole of England a river name which is not
Celtic,” i.e. British.

As the Briton here looked from the hill-side, down upon the valley beneath him, two of the
chief objects to catch his eye would be the streams which watered it, and which there, as they
do still, united their forces.  They would then also, probably, form a larger feature in the
prospect than they do at the present day, for the local beds of gravel deposit would seem to
indicate that these streams were formerly of considerably greater volume, watering a wider
area, and probably having ramifications which formed shoals and islands. {2b}  The particular
names by which the Briton designated the two main streams confirm this supposition.  In the
one coming from the more distant wolds, he saw a stream bright and clear, meandering through
the meadows which it fertilized, and this he named the “Bain,” {2c} that word being Celtic
for “bright” or “clear,” a characteristic which still belongs to its waters, as the brewers
of Horncastle assure us.  In the other stream, which runs a shorter and more rapid course,
he saw a more turbid current, and to it he gave the name “Waring,” {2d} which is the Celtic
“garw” or “gerwin,” meaning “rough.”  Each of these names, then, we may regard as what the
poet Horace calls “nomen præsente notâ productum,” {2e} they are as good as coin stamped in
the mint of a Cunobelin, or a Caradoc, bearing his “image and superscription,” and after some
17 centuries of change, they are in circulation still.  So long as Horncastle is watered by
the Bain and the Waring she will bear the brand of the British sway, once paramount in her valley.

These river names, however, are not the only relics of the Britons found in Horncastle.  Two
British urns were unearthed about 50 years ago, where is now the garden of the present vicarage,
and another was found in the parish of Thornton, about a mile from the town, when the railway
was being made in 1856.  The latter the present writer has seen, although it is now unfortunately
lost. {2f}

These Britons were a pastoral race, as Cæsar, their conqueror, tells us, {2g} not cultivating
much corn, but having large flocks and herds, living on the milk and flesh of their live stock,
and clad in the skins of these, or of other animals taken in the chase.  The well-watered pastures
of the Bain valley would afford excellent grazing for their cattle, while the extensive forests
{2h} of the district around would provide them with the recreations of the chase, which also
helped to make them the skilled warriors which the Romans found them to be. {3}  Much of these
forests remained even down to comparatively recent times, and very large trees have been dug
up, black with age, in fields within four or five miles of Horncastle, within very recent years,
which the present writer has seen.

Such were some of the earlier inhabitants of this locality, leaving their undoubted traces
behind them, but no “local habitation” with a name; for that we are first indebted to the Romans,
who, after finding the Briton a foe not unworthy of his steel, ultimately subjugated him and
found him not an inapt pupil in Roman arts and civilization.  Of the aptitude of the Briton
to learn from his conquerors we have evidence in the fact, mentioned by the Roman writer Eumenius,
that when the Emperor Constantius wished to rebuild the town Augustodunum (now Antun) in Gaul,
about the end of the 3rd century, he employed workmen chiefly from Britain, such was the change
effected in our “rude forefathers” in 250 years.

We may sum up our remarks on the Britons by saying that in them we have ancestors of whom we
have no occasion to be ashamed.  They had a Christian church more than 300 years before St.
Augustine visited our shores.  They yet survive in the sturdy fisher folk of Brittany; in those
stout miners of Cornwall, who in the famed Botallack mine have bored under the ocean bed, the
name Cornwall itself being Welsh (i.e. British) for corner land; in the people who occupy the
fastnesses of the Welsh mountains, as well as in the Gaels of the Scottish Highlands and the
Erse of Ireland.  Their very speech is blended with our own.  Does the country labourer go
to the Horncastle tailor to buy coat and breeches?  His British forefather, though clad chiefly
in skins, called his upper garment his “cotta,” his nether covering his “brages,” scotice “breeks.”

PART II—THE DIMLY HISTORIC PERIOD.

The headquarters of the Roman forces in our own part of Britain were at York, where more than
one Roman Emperor lived and died, but Lindum, now Lincoln, was an important station.  About
A.D. 71 Petillius Cerealis was appointed governor of the province by the Emperor Vespasian,
he was succeeded by Julius Frontinus, both being able generals.  From A.D. 78 to 85 that admirable
soldier and administrator, Julius Agricola, over-ran the whole of the north as far as the Grampians,
establishing forts in all directions, and doubtless during these and the immediately succeeding
years, a network of such stations would be constructed in our own country, connected by those
splendid highways which the Romans carried, by the forced labour of the natives, through the
length and breadth of their vast empire.

Coins of nearly all the Roman Emperors have been found at Horncastle; one was brought to the
present writer in the 1st year of the 20th century, bearing the superscription of the Emperor
Severus, who died at York A.D., 211.

A Roman milestone was discovered in the Bail, at Lincoln, in 1891, {5a} inscribed with the
name of Marcus Piavonius Victorinus, who commanded in Gaul and Britain, and which must have
been set up during his period of office, about A D. 267.  The site of this was the point of
intersection of the two main streets, which would be the centre of the Roman Forum at Lindum,
one of these streets leading to Horncastle; from Horncastle also there branched off, as will
be hereafter noted, several main Roman roads.

As Horncastle stands on the banks of the river Bain it has been taken by Stukeley, the antiquarian,
and by others following him, {5b} to have been the Roman Banovallum or “Fort on the Bain,”
mentioned by the Roman geographer of Ravenna; {5c} although, however, most probably correct,
this is a mere conjecture.  On the road between Horncastle and Lincoln we have the village
of Baumber, also called Bamburgh, and this latter form of the name might well mean a “burgh,”
or fort, on the Bain, the river running just below the village.  The two names, however, might
well exist at different periods.  It may be here mentioned that this form, Bamburg, is found
in Harleian Charter 56, c. i, B.M., dated at Wodehalle, December, 1328.

Tacitus, the Roman historian, {5e} tells us that the Romans “wore out the bodies and hands
of the Britons in opening out the forests, and paving or fortifying the roads,” and we can
well imagine that those skilled generals would see the advantageous position for a stronghold
in the angle formed by the junction of the two rivers, and would employ the subjugated Britons
of the locality in constructing, it may be, at first only a rude fort, protected on two sides
by the streams and in the rear by a “vallum,” or embankment, and that on the site thus secured
and already a native stronghold, they would, at a later period, erect the “castrum,” of which
massive fragments still remain, testifying to its great strength.

These remains, indeed, in almost their whole course can be traced through present-day gardens
and back premises, shewing the four sides of an irregular parallelogram.  Their dimensions,
roughly speaking, are on the north and south sides about 600-ft., by about 350-ft. at the eastern,
and 300-ft. at the western end, their thickness being about 16-ft.  The material employed was
the Spilsby sandstone, obtainable within five miles, cemented by course grouting poured into
the interstices between the massive blocks.  These walls inclose a portion of the High Street
as far eastward as the site of the present Corn Exchange, westward they include the present
manor house and form the boundary of the churchyard in that direction.  On the north they run
at the back of the houses on that side of the Market Place, and on the south they extend from
St. Mary’s Square, past the Grammar School, and through sundry yards, parallel with the branch
of the canal, which is the old Waring river. The masonry of these walls, as now seen, is very
rude.  It is supposed that, originally as built by the Romans, they had an external coating
of neat structure, but this has entirely disappeared, it is still, however, to be seen in the
wells, which are next to be described.

In a cellar, south of the High Street, at a baker’s shop, and close to the eastern wall of
the castle, is a Roman well; there is another close to the north-east angle of the castle walls,
in what is called Dog-kennel Yard, and a third just within the western wall, near the present
National Schools.  Thus, although the two rivers were without the castle walls, the Roman garrison
was well supplied with water.

The Roman roads branching from the town were (1st) the “Ramper,” {6a} as it is still called,
running north-west, and connecting it with the Roman station Lindum; from this, at Baumber,
{6b} distant about 4 miles, a branch running northwards led to the Roman Castrum, now Caistor;
(2nd) north-eastwards via West Ashby, being the highway to Louth, the Roman Luda; (3rd) eastwards,
by High Toynton, Greetham, &c, to Waynflete, the Roman Vain-ona; (4th) southward, by Dalderby,
Haltham, &c., to Leeds Gate, Chapel Hill, and there crossing the river Witham to Sleaford and
Ancaster, the Roman Causennæ, situated on the great Roman Ermin Street. This also was continued
to another Roman Castrum, now Castor, near Peterborough; (5th) south-west, by Thornton, &c.,
to Tattershall, locally supposed to have been the Roman Durobrivæ, and where traces of a Roman
camp still remain.

Besides these Roman viæ and Roman coins, quite an abundance of Roman pottery has from time
to time been unearthed, and fragments are continually being found in gardens in the town. 
A collection of these, probably cinerary urns, was preserved until quite recently in the library
of the Mechanics’ Institute, where the writer has frequently seen them, {7a} they varied in
height from 8 inches to 18 inches.  Unfortunately, for lack of funds, that institution was
broken up about 1890, the books were stowed away in a room at the workhouse, a valuable collection,
and the urns were sold by the late Mr. Joseph Willson, who acted as sole trustee.  Other Roman
relics have been fragments of mortars of white clay, found on the site of the present union,
one bearing the word “fecit,” though the maker’s name was lost.  Portions also of Samian ware
have been found, one stamped with a leopard and stag, another bearing part of the potter’s
name, ILIANI; with fragments of hand-mills, fibulæ, &c. {7b}  The present writer has two jars,
or bottles, of buff coloured ware, of which about a dozen were dug up when the foundations
of the workhouse were being laid in 1838, they are probably Samian, a friend having exactly
similar vessels which she brought from Cyprus.  The writer has in his possession the head of
a porphyritic mallet which was found in a garden in the south of the town a few years ago,
it is probably Roman; the handle, which would be of wood, had entirely disappeared; it is much
“pitted” through damp and age, is 6½ inches long and weighs 3-lb. 9-oz.

 [Picture: Hammer Head, found near the Wong, length 6⅝-in., width 3⅞-in.

             The stone was probably part of a large boulder]

A discovery of further interesting Roman relics of another kind was made in 1896.  The owner
of a garden near Queen Street, in the south-eastern part of the town, was digging up an apple
tree when he came across a fine bed of gravel.  Continuing the digging, in order to find the
thickness of this deposit, his spade struck against a hard substance, which proved to be a
lead coffin.  After this had been examined by others invited to inspect it, without any satisfactory
result, the present writer was requested to conduct further investigation.  The coffin was
found to be 5-ft. 2-in. in length, containing the skeleton, rather shorter, of a female.  A
few days later a second coffin was found, lying parallel to the first, 5-ft. 7-in. in length,
the bones of the skeleton within being larger and evidently those of a male.  Subsequently
fragments of decayed wood and long iron nails and clamps were found, showing that the leaden
coffins had originally been enclosed in wooden cases.  Both these coffins lay east and west.
A description was sent to a well-known antiquarian, the late Mr. John Bellows of Gloucester,
and he stated that if the lead had an admixture of tin they were Roman, if no tin, post-Roman.
The lead was afterwards analysed by Professor Church, of Kew, and by the analytical chemist
of Messrs. Kynoch & Co., of Birmingham, with the result that there was found to be a percentage
of 1.65 of tin to 97.08 of lead and 1.3 of oxygen, “the metal slightly oxidised.”  It was thus
proved that the coffins were those of Romans, their “orientation” implying that they were Christian.
It should be added that three similar coffins were found in the year 1872, when the foundations
were being laid of the New Jerusalem Chapel in Croft Street, within some 100 yards of the two
already described; and further, as confirmatory of their being Roman, a lead coffin was also
found in the churchyard of Baumber, on the restoration of the church there in 1892, this being
close to the Roman road (already mentioned) between the old Roman stations Banovallum and Lindum.
Lead coffins have also been found in the Roman cemeteries at Colchester, York, and at other
places. {8}
