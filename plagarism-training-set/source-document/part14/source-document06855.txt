~Sand Molding.~--Molding concrete ornaments in sand is in all respects like molding iron castings
in a foundry. Sand molding gives perhaps the handsomest ornament of any kind of molding process,
the surface texture and detail of the block being especially fine. It is, however, a more expensive
process than molding in wooden or iron molds, since a separate mold must be made for each piece
molded. The process was first employed and patented in 1899, by Mr. C. W. Stevens, of Harvey,
Ill., and for this reason it is often called the Stevens process. Sand molded ornaments and
blocks are made by a number of firms to order to any pattern. The process as employed at the
works of the Roman Stone Co., of Toronto, Ont., is as follows: The stone employed for aggregate,
is a hard, coarse, crystalline limestone of a light grey color, being practically 97 per cent.
calcium carbonate, with a small percentage of iron, aluminia and magnesia. Nothing but carefully
selected quarry clippings are used and these are crushed and ground at the factory and carefully
screened into three sizes, the largest about the size of a kernel of corn. Daily granulometric
tests are made of the crusher output to regulate the amount of each size got from the machines.
It has been found that next in importance to properly graded aggregates is the gaging of the
amount of water used in the mixture. This is done by an automatically filled tank into which
lead both hot and cold water and in which is fixed a thermometer to properly regulate the temperature.
In gaging the mix about 20% of water is used, but of course when the cast is made the surplus
is immediately drawn off into the sand, where it is retained and serves as a wet blanket to
protect the cast and supply it with the proper amount of water during crystallization. Experiments
seem to indicate that about 15% by weight gives the greatest amount of strength of mortar at
the age of six months, while, giving less strength at shorter time tests than mortar gaged
with a smaller percentage of water.

The method of handling the mix and casting is quite simple and almost identical with the practice
in iron foundries. The mixture is made in a batch mixer to about the same consistency as molasses,
from which it is poured into a mechanical agitator and carried about the foundry by a traveling
crane. This agitator is so constructed that it keeps the materials in motion constantly and
prevents their segregation. In each cast is inserted the proper reinforcing rods, lifting hooks
and tie rods, and the casts are allowed to remain for a proper period in the wet sand after
they are poured; they are then taken to the seasoning room which is kept at as constant a temperature
as it is practical to maintain. Each cast is marked with the number which determines its location
in the building and the date it was cast, and it is then kept in the storage shed a fixed time
before shipping.

Records are kept of each cast made and the company is able to get, as in mills rolling structural
steel, the exact number and location of all casts made from the same mix. Careful records are
always kept of the tests of cement and material, and test cubes are made from each consignment
of cement so tested; in this way all danger of defective stone through inferior cement is eliminated.
The patterns used in making the molds and the method of molding are quite similar to ordinary
iron foundry practice except that the sand used is of special nature. The finish of the stone
is generally tooled finish molded in the sand, the different textures of natural stone being
produced by the veneering of the pattern with thin strips of wood which are run through a machine
producing the different finishes. Each stone is provided with setting hooks cast in the blocks
which take the place of the ordinary lewis holes used in cut stone.

~Plaster Molds.~--Plaster of Paris molds are made from clay, gelatin or other patterns in the
usual manner adopted by sculptors. They are particularly adapted to fine line and under cut
ornaments. The concrete is poured into the plaster mold and after the cement has become hard,
the plaster is broken or chiseled away, leaving the concrete exposed. Two examples of excellent
work in intricate concrete ornaments are furnished by the power house for the Sanitary District
of Chicago, and by the State Normal School building, at Kearney, Neb. In the power house, the
ornamental work consisted of molded courses, cornice work; and particularly of heavy capitals
for pilasters. These capitals were very heavy, being 7½ ft. long and of the Ionic design. These
were made from plaster molds; made so as to be taken apart or knocked down and to release in
this way, perfectly. There were also scrolls, keystones and arches in curved design over all
of the 40 windows. None of this ornament was true under cut work. In building the Normal School
building, Corinthian capitals, in quarters, halves, corners and full rounds were made in plaster
molds. There were some 30 of these capitols. They were made in solid plaster molds; the molds
having been cast in gelatine molds, one for each capitol. Into these, the concrete was tamped,
made very wet, and after the concrete had hardened, the plaster cast was chiseled away. This
was very easily accomplished. These capitols were true Corinthians, having all the floriation
and under-cut usually seen in such capitols.

~ORNAMENTS MOLDED IN PLACE.~--Molding ornaments in place is usually, and generally should be,
confined to belt courses, cornices, copings and plain panels. Relief work, like keystones,
scrolls or rosettes, can be molded in place if desired, by setting plaster molds in the wooden
forms at the proper points. This method is often advantageous in bridge work, where comparatively
few ornaments are required, such as keystones.

The construction of forms for ornamental work in place is best described by taking specific
examples. Figure 293, shows the face form for the arch ring, spandrel wall and cornice or coping
course of the Big Muddy River Bridge on the Illinois Central R. R. The section is taken near
the crown of the arch. The lagging only is shown; this was, of course, backed with studding.
The point to be noted in this form is the avoidance of any approach to under cut work; there
are, in fact, very few straight cut details. This brings up a point that must be carefully
watched if trouble is to be avoided, namely, the construction of the form work in sections
which can be removed without fracturing the ornament. To illustrate by an assumed example,
supposing it is required to mold the wall and cornice shown by Fig. 294. It is clear that if
the backing studs are in single pieces, notched as shown, the forms cannot be removed without
fracturing at least the corner A. If the studs and lagging be constructed in two parts, separated
along the line a b, the form is possible of removal if great care is used without damage to
the concrete. The construction shown by this sketch does not greatly exaggerate matters. Figure
295 shows a wall form that has been given several times as a presumably good example in which,
as will be seen it is impossible to remove the board a, without breaking the concrete even
if the narrow face were not broken by the swelling of the lumber before ever it became time
to take down the forms.

This matter of making provision for the swelling of the forms is another point to be watched.
Referring again to Fig. 294 it will be seen that the swelling of the lagging, even if the cornice
instead of being under cut at A were straight cut on the line c d, is liable so to crowd the
lagging into the corner A and B that the concrete is cracked along the lines e f or g h. A
suggested remedy for this danger is shown by Fig. 296. At a distance of every 3 or 4 ft. insert
a narrow piece of lagging a and behind these lagging strips cut notches b in the studs. When
the concrete has got its initial set pull back the lagging strip a into the notches b, leaving
an open joint to provide for expansion due to swelling. The completed facade is shown by Fig.
298. The ceiling slab was first built and allowed to set and then the forms were erected for
the frieze and coping. After these were molded the forms were continued upward as shown for
the base of the railing. Above this point the several parts were separately molded as shown
by Fig. 285 previously described. Molded in this manner the ceiling cost 25 cts. per sq. ft.;
the frieze and coping cost $2 per lin. ft., and the railing base cost 45 cts. per lin. ft.
In constructing the concrete abutments of this same structure use was made of the forms shown
by Fig. 299. These abutments had curved wing walls and for molding these girts cut to the radii
of the curves were fastened to the studs and vertical lagging was nailed to the girts. All
the lagging was tongue and groove stuff.

In constructing an open spandrel arch bridge at St. Paul, Minn., the cornice form shown by
Fig. 300, supported as shown by Fig. 301, was used. The particular feature of this form was
the use of a lath and plaster lining to the lagging. This lining was used for all exposed surfaces
of the bridge. So called patent lath consisting of boards with parallel dovetail grooves and
ridges was used. This was plastered with cement mortar and the concrete was deposited directly
against the plaster after smearing the plaster surface with boiled linseed oil. This lining
is stated to have given an excellent surface finish to the concrete. It cost 55 cts. per sq.
ft. for materials and labor. A section of the balustrade and cornice is shown by Fig. 302.
The posts, balusters and railing were molded separately. The balusters were molded in zinc
molds. At first some trouble was had in getting good casts on account of air pockets. This
was largely done away with by filling the mold as compactly as possible and then driving a
¾-in. iron rod through the center vertically; this rod crowded the concrete into all parts
of the mold and also served to strengthen the baluster. The baluster molds were made in two
parts; this proved a mistake--three parts would have been better.

CHAPTER XXIV.

MISCELLANEOUS DATA ON MATERIALS, MACHINES AND COSTS.

The following cost data comprise such miscellaneous items as do not properly come in the preceding
chapters. They are given not as including all the miscellaneous purposes for which concrete
is used but as being such items of costs as were secured in collecting the more important data
given in preceding sections.

~DRILLING AND BLASTING CONCRETE.~--Concrete is exceedingly troublesome material in which to
drill deep holes, and this statement is particularly true if the concrete is green. The following
mode of procedure proved successful in drilling 1½-in. anchor bolt holes 6 ft. and over in
depth in green concrete. The apparatus used is shown by Fig. 303, re-drawn from a rough sketch
made on the work by one of the authors, and only approximately to scale. The drill is hung
on a small pile driver frame, occupying exactly the position the hammer would occupy in a pile
driver, and is raised and lowered by a hand windlass. By this arrangement a longer drill could
be used than with the ordinary tripod mounting and less changing of drills was necessary. A
wide flare bit was used, permitting a small copper pipe to be carried into the hole with the
drill; through this pipe water was forced under pressure, carrying off the chips so rapidly
that no wedging was possible. By this device drilling which had previously cost over 25 cts.
a hole was done at a cost of less than 5 cts. a hole.

In removing an old cable railway track in St. Louis, Mo., holes 8 ins. deep were drilled in
the concrete with a No. 2 Little Jap drill, using a 1¼-in. bit and air at 90 lbs. pressure.
A dry hole was drilled, the exhaust air from the hollow drill blowing the dust from the hole
keeping it clean. The concrete was about 18 years old and very hard. Two holes across track
were drilled, one 10 ins. inside each rail; lengthwise of the track the holes were spaced 24
ins. apart, or four pairs of holes between each pair of yokes.

Common labor was used to run the drills and very little mechanical trouble was experienced.
Three cars were fitted up, one for each gang, each car being equipped with a motor-driven air
compressor, water for cooling the compressors being obtained from the fire plugs along the
route. The air compressors were taken temporarily from those in use in the repair shops, no
special machines being bought for the purpose. Electricity for operating the air compressor
motors was taken from the trolley wire over the tracks. The car was moved along as the holes
were drilled, air being conveyed from the car to the drills through a flexible hose. Two drills
were operated normally from each car. One of the air compressors was exceptionally large and
at times operated four drills. The total number of holes drilled in the reconstruction of the
track was 31,000. The total feet of hole drilled was 20,700 ft.

With the best one of the plants operating two to three drills 30 8-in. holes, or 20.3 ft. of
hole, were drilled per hour per drill at a labor cost of 2.7 cts. per foot.

For blasting, a 0.1-lb. charge of 40 per cent. dynamite was used in each hole. A fulminating
cap was used to explode the charge, and 12 holes were shot at one time by an electric firing
machine. The dynamite was furnished from the factory in 0.1-lb. packages, and all the preparation
necessary on the work was to insert the fulminating cap in the dynamite, tamp the charge into
the hole and connect the wires to the firing machine. In order to prevent any damage being
done by flying rocks at the time of the explosion, each blasting gang was supplied with a cover
car, which was merely a flat car with a heavy bottom and side boards. When a charge was to
be fired, this car was run over the 12 holes and the side boards let down, so that the charge
was entirely covered. This work was remarkably free from accidents. There were no personal
accident claims whatever, and the total amount paid out for property damages for the whole
six miles of construction was $685. Most of this was for glass broken by the shock of explosion.
There was no glass broken by flying particles. The men doing this work, few of whom had ever
done blasting before, soon became very skillful in handling the dynamite, and the work advanced
rapidly. The report made by the firing of the 12 holes was no greater than that made by giant
fire-crackers.

For the drilling and blasting the old rail had been left in place to carry the air compressor
car and the cover car. After the blasting, this rail was removed and the concrete, excavated
to the required depth. In most cases the cable yokes had been broken by the force of the blast.
Where these yokes had not been broken, they were knocked out by blows from pieces of rail.
The efficacy of the blasting depended largely upon the proper location of the hole. Where the
holes had been drilled close to the middle of the concrete block, so that the dynamite charge
was exploded a little below the center of gravity of the section, the concrete was well shattered
and could be picked out in large pieces. Where the hole had been located too close to either
side of the concrete block, however, the charge would blow out at one side and a large mass
of solid concrete would be left intact on the other side. The total estimated quantity of concrete
blasted was 6,558 cu. yds., or 0.2 cu. yd. of concrete per lineal foot of track. The cost of
the dynamite delivered in 0.1 lb. packages was 13 cts. per pound. The exploders cost $0.0255 each.

The cost of drilling and blasting was as follows:

  Item.                        Per mile.  Per lin. ft.  Per cu. yd.
Labor, drilling                 $ 89.76         $0.017       $0.085
Blasting labor and materials.    285.12          0.054        0.268
                                -------         ------       ------
  Total drilling and blasting.  $374.88         $0.071       $0.353

The cost of blasting with labor and materials, separately itemized, was as follows, per cubic yard:

Dynamite and exploders     $0.192
Labor                       0.076
                           ------
  Total                    $0.268

Two cubic yards of concrete were blasted per pound of dynamite.

~BENCH MONUMENTS, CHICAGO, ILL.~--The standard bench monuments, Fig. 304, used in Chicago,
Ill., are mostly placed in the grass plot between the curb and the lot line, so that the top
of the iron cover comes just level with the street grade or flush with the surface of the cement
walk. The monument consists of a pyramidal base 6 ft. high and 42 ins. square at the bottom,
with a ¼-in.×2-ft. copper rod embedded, and of a cast iron top and cover constructed as shown
by the drawing. Mr. W. H. Hedges, Bench and Street Grade Engineer, Department of Public Works,
Chicago, Ill., gives the following data regarding quantities and cost. The materials required
for each monument are: 1.78 cu. yd. crushed stone, 0.6 cu. yd. torpedo sand, 1½ bbls. cement,
60 ft. B. M. lumber, one ¼×24-in. copper rod, one top and cover. A gang consisting of 1 foreman,
4 laborers and 2 teams construct from one to three monuments per day, the average number being
two per 8-hour day. In 1906 the average cost of the monuments was $24.12 each, based on above
material and labor charges.

~POLE BASE.~--Figure 305 shows a concrete base for transmission line poles invented by Mr.
M. H. Murray, of Bakersfield, Cal., and used by the Power Transit & Light Co. of that city.
These bases are molded and shipped to the work ready for placing. They weigh about 420 lbs.
each. One base requires 37½ lbs. of 2×¼-in. steel bar, 40 lbs. of Portland cement, 3 cu. ft.
of broken stone or gravel and enough sand to fill the form or mold, which is 10×10 ins. by
4½ ft. Unskilled labor is employed in the molding and two men can mold ten bases per 8-hour
day. The cost of molding is as follows per base:

2 men at $2 per day         $0.40
Brace irons per set          2.50
1-9 cu. yd. stone at $4.05   0.45
40 lbs. cement at 1½ cts.    0.60
Sand                         0.15
                            -----
  Total cost                $4.10

Two men at $2 per day each set five bases in eight hours, making the cost of setting 80 cts.
per base. The bases were sunk to a depth of 3 ft. 3 ins. In many cases they were placed under
poles without interrupting service by sawing off the pole, dropping it into the ground, placing
the new base and setting the sawed-off pole on it and bolting up the straps.

~MILE POST, CHICAGO & EASTERN ILLINOIS R. R.~--The dimensions of the post are shown by Fig.
306. Each post weighs 498 lbs. They are made when other concrete work is being done. The form
is laid flat, with the molds for the letters on the bottom, and bottom and sides are plastered
with mortar, which is backed up with a 1-1-2 stone concrete. The cost of the post is given
as follows:

¼ barrel of cement at $2                          $0.50
267 lbs. crushed stone                             0.01
133 lbs. sand                                      0.01
1-1/3 hours labor at 15 cts.                       0.20
1/3 hour carpenter changing letters at 25 cts.     0.08
Coloring cement                                    0.02
                                                  -----
  Total                                           $0.82

~BONDING NEW CONCRETE TO OLD.~--Concrete which has set hard has a surface skin or glaze to
which fresh concrete will not adhere strongly unless special effort is made to perfect the
bond. Various ways of doing this are practiced. The most common is to clean the hardened surface
from all loose material and give it a thorough wash of cement grout against which the fresh
concrete is deposited and rammed before the grout has had time to set. Washing the old surface
with a hose or scrubbing it with a brush and water improves the bond, as does also the hard
tamping of the concrete immediately over the joint. Mortar may be used in place of grout. The
thorough cleansing of the surface is, however, quite as essential as the bonding coat, in fact
in the opinion of the authors it is more essential. As a rule, a good enough joint for ordinary
purposes can be got by tamping the fresh concrete directly against the old concrete, without
grout or mortar coating, if the surface of the latter is thoroughly cleaned by scrubbing and
flushing. The secret of securing a good bond between fresh concrete and concrete that has set
lies largely in getting rid of the glaze skin and the slime and dust which forms on it. Washing
will go far toward doing this. The glaze skin can be removed entirely by acid solutions, but
the acid wash must be flushed free from the surface before placing the fresh concrete. Ransomite,
made by the Ransome Concrete Machinery Co., Dunellen, N. J., is a prepared acid wash which
to the authors' knowledge has given excellent success in a number of cases. The glaze coat
can also be removed by picking the hardened surface, but the picking should be followed by
washing to remove all loose chips and dust.
