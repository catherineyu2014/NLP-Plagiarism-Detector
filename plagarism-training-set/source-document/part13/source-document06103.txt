TO HER MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THE QUEEN.                           (p. iii)

MADAM,

The gracious intimation of your Royal pleasure that these Memoirs of your renowned Predecessor
should be dedicated to your Majesty, while it increases my solicitude, suggests at the same
time new and cheering anticipations. I cannot but hope that, appearing in the world under the
auspices of your great name, the religious and moral purposes which this work is designed to
serve will be more widely and effectually realised.

       *       *       *       *       *

Under a lively sense of the literary defects which render these volumes unworthy of so august
a patronage, to one point I may revert with feelings of satisfaction and encouragement. I have
gone only   (p. iv) where Truth seemed to lead me on the way: and this, in your Majesty's judgment,
I am assured will compensate for many imperfections.

       *       *       *       *       *

That your Majesty may ever abundantly enjoy the riches of HIS favour who is the Spirit of Truth,
and having long worn your diadem here in honour and peace, in the midst of an affectionate
and happy people, may resign it in exchange for an eternal crown in heaven, is the prayer of
one who rejoices in the privilege of numbering himself,

     Madam,

        Among your Majesty's

            Most faithful and devoted

                Subjects and servants.

                      J. ENDELL TYLER.

24, Bedford Square,
    May 24, 1838.

PREFACE.                                                             (p. v)

Memoirs such as these of Henry of Monmouth might doubtless be made more attractive and entertaining
were their Author to supply the deficiencies of authentic records by the inventions of his
fancy, and adorn the result of careful inquiry into matters of fact by the descriptive imagery
and colourings of fiction. To a writer, also, who could at once handle the pen of the biographer
and of the poet, few names would offer a more ample field for the excursive range of historical
romance than the life of Henry of Monmouth. From the day of his first compulsory visit to Ireland,
abounding as that time does with deeply interesting incidents, to his last hour in the now-ruined
castle of Vincennes;--or rather, from his mother's espousals to the interment of his earthly
remains within the sacred precincts of Westminster, every period teems with animating suggestions.
So far, however, from possessing such adventitious recommendations, the point on which (rather
perhaps than any other) an apology might be expected for this work, is, that it has freely
tested by the standard of     (p. vi) truth those delineations of Henry's character which have
contributed to immortalize our great historical dramatist. The Author, indeed, is willing to
confess that he would gladly have withdrawn from the task of assaying the substantial accuracy
and soundness of Shakspeare's historical and biographical views, could he have done so safely
and without a compromise of principle. He would have avoided such an inquiry, not only in deference
to the acknowledged rule which does not suffer a poet to be fettered by the rigid shackles
of unbending facts; but from a disinclination also to interfere, even in appearance, with the
full and free enjoyment of those exquisite scenes of humour, wit, and nature, in which Henry
is the hero, and his "riotous, reckless companions" are subordinate in dramatical excellence
only to himself. The Author may also not unwillingly grant, that (with the majority of those
who give a tone to the "form and pressure" of the age) Shakspeare has done more to invest the
character of Henry with a never-dying interest beyond the lot of ordinary monarchs, than the
bare records of historical verity could ever have effected. Still he feels that he had no alternative.
He must either have ascertained the historical worth of those scenic representations, or have
suffered to remain in their full force the deep and prevalent impressions, as to Henry's principles
and conduct, which owe, if not their origin, yet, at least, much of their universality and
vividness, to Shakspeare. (p. vii) The poet is dear, and our early associations are dear; and
pleasures often tasted without satiety are dear: but to every rightly balanced mind Truth will
be dearer than all.

       *       *       *       *       *

It must nevertheless be here intimated, that these volumes are neither exclusively, nor yet
especially, designed for the antiquarian student. The Author has indeed sought for genuine
information at every fountain-head accessible to him; but he has prepared the result of his
researches for the use (he would trust, for the improvement as well as the gratification,)
of the general reader. And whilst he has not consciously omitted any essential reference, he
has guarded against interrupting the course of his narrative by an unnecessary accumulation
of authorities. He is, however, compelled to confess that he rises from this very limited sphere
of inquiry under an impression, which grew stronger and deeper as his work advanced, that,
before a history of our country can be produced worthy of a place among the records of mankind,
the still hidden treasures of the metropolis and of our universities, together with the stores
which are known to exist in foreign libraries, must be studied with far more of devoted care
and zealous perseverance than have hitherto been bestowed upon them. That the honest and able
student, however unwearied in zeal and industry, may be supplied with the indispensable means
of verifying what    (p. viii) tradition has delivered down, enucleating difficulties, rectifying
mistakes, reconciling apparent inconsistencies, clearing up doubts, and removing that mass
of confusion and error under which the truth often now lies buried,--our national history must
be made a subject of national interest. It is a maxim of our law, and the constant practice
of our courts of justice, never to admit evidence unless it be the best which under the circumstances
can be obtained. Were this principle of jurisprudence recognised and adopted in historical
criticism, the student would carefully ascend to the first witnesses of every period, on whom
modern writers (however eloquent or sagacious) must depend for their information. How lamentably
devoid of authority and credit is the work of the most popular and celebrated of our modern
English historians in consequence of his unhappy neglect of this fundamental principle, will
be made palpably evident by the instances which could not be left unnoticed even within the
narrow range of these Memoirs. And the Author is generally persuaded that, without a far more
comprehensive and intimate acquaintance with original documents than our writers have possessed,
or apparently have thought it their duty to cultivate, error will continue to be propagated
as heretofore; and our annals will abound with surmises and misrepresentations, instead of
being the guardian depositories of historical verity. Only by the acknowledgment and application
of the principle here advocated will (p. ix) England be supplied with those monuments of our
race, those "POSSESSIONS FOR EVER," as the Prince of Historians[1] once named them, which may
instruct the world in the philosophy of moral cause and effect, exhibit honestly and clearly
the natural workings of the human heart, and diffuse through the mass of our fellow-creatures
a practical assurance that piety, justice, and charity form the only sure groundwork of a people's
glory and happiness; while religious and moral depravity in a nation, no less than in an individual,
leads, (tardily it may be and remotely, but by ultimate and inevitable consequence,) to failure
and degradation.

                   [Footnote 1: Thucydides.]

In those portions of his work which have a more immediate bearing upon religious principles
and conduct, the Author has not adopted the most exciting mode of discussing the various subjects
which have naturally fallen under his review. Party spirit, though it seldom fails to engender
a more absorbing interest for the time, and often clothes a subject with an importance not
its own, will find in these pages no response to its sentiments, under whatever character it
may give utterance to them. In these departments of his inquiry, to himself far the most interesting,
(and many such there are, especially in the second volume,) the Author trusts that he has been
guided by the Apostolical maxim of "SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE." He has not willingly advanced
a single sentiment which should unnecessarily     (p. x) cause pain to any individual or to
any class of men; he has not been tempted by morbid delicacy or fear to suppress or disguise
his view of the very TRUTH.

The reader will readily perceive that, with reference to the foreign and domestic policy of
our country,--the advances of civilization,--the manners of private life, as well in the higher
as in the more humble grades of society,--the state of literature,--the progress of the English
constitution,--the condition and discipline of the army, which Henry greatly improved,--and
the rise and progress of the royal navy, of which he was virtually the founder, many topics
are either purposely avoided, or only incidentally and cursorily noticed. To one point especially
(a subject in itself most animating and uplifting, and intimately interwoven with the period
embraced by these Memoirs,) he would have rejoiced to devote a far greater portion of his book,
had it been compatible with the immediate design of his undertaking;--THE PROMISE AND THE DAWN
OF THE REFORMATION.

       *       *       *       *       *

However the value of his labours may be ultimately appreciated, the Author confidently trusts
that their publication can do no disservice to the cause of truth, of sound morality, and of
pure religion. He would hope, indeed, that in one point at least the power of an      (p. xi)
example of pernicious tendency might be weakened by the issue of his investigation. If the
results of these inquiries be acquiesced in as sound and just, no young man can be encouraged
by Henry's example (as it is feared many, especially in the higher classes, have been encouraged,)
in early habits of moral delinquency, with the intention of extricating himself in time from
the dominion of his passions, and of becoming, like Henry, in after-life a pattern of religion
and virtue, "the mirror of every grace and excellence." The divine, the moralist, and the historian
know that authenticated instances of such sudden moral revolutions in character are very rare,--exceptions
to the general rule; and among those exceptions we cannot be justified in numbering Henry of
Monmouth.

He was bold and merciful and kind, but he was no libertine, in his youth; he was brave and
generous and just, but he was no persecutor, in his manhood. On the throne he upheld the royal
authority with mingled energy and mildness, and he approved himself to his subjects as a wise
and beneficent King; in his private individual capacity he was a bountiful and considerate,
though strict and firm master, a warm and sincere friend, a faithful and loving husband. He
passed through life under the habitual sense of an overruling Providence; and, in his premature
death, he left us the example of a Christian's patient and pious resignation to the Divine
Will. As long as he lived, he was  (p. xii) an object of the most ardent and enthusiastic admiration,
confidence, and love; and, whilst the English monarchy shall remain among the unforgotten things
on earth, his memory will be honoured, and his name will be enrolled among the NOBLE and the GOOD.

MEMOIRS OF HENRY OF MONMOUTH.

1387-1398.

Henry the Fifth was the son of Henry of Bolinbroke and Mary daughter of Humfrey Bohun, Earl
of Hereford. No direct and positive evidence has yet been discovered to fix with unerring accuracy
the day or the place of his birth. If however we assume the statement of the chroniclers[2]
to be true, that he was born at Monmouth on the ninth day of August in the year 1387,[3] history
supplies many ascertained facts not only consistent with that hypothesis, but in          
(p. 002) confirmation of it; whilst none are found to throw upon it the faintest shade of improbability.
At first sight it might perhaps appear strange that the exact time of the birth as well of
Henry of Monmouth, as of his father, two successive kings of England, should even yet remain
the subject of conjecture, tradition, and inference; whilst the day and place of the birth
of Henry VI. is matter of historical record. A single reflection, however, on the circumstances
of their respective births, renders the absence of all precise testimony in the one case natural;
whilst it would have been altogether unintelligible in the other. When Henry of Bolinbroke
and Henry of Monmouth were born, their fathers were subjects, and nothing of national interest
was at the time associated with their appearance in the world; at Henry of Windsor's birth
he was the acknowledged heir to the throne both of England and of France.

                   [Footnote 2: Monomothi in Wallia natus v. Id.
                   Aug.--Pauli Jov. Ang. Reg. Chron.; William of
                   Worcester, &c.]

                   [Footnote 3: At the foot of the Wardrobe Account of
                   Henry Earl of Derby from 30th September 1387 to
                   30th September 1388, (and unfortunately no account
                   of the Duke of Lancaster's expenses is as yet found
                   extant before that very year,) an item occurs of
                   341l. 12s. 5d., paid 24th September 1386, for
                   the household expenses of the Earl and his family
                   at Monmouth. This proves that his father made the
                   castle of Monmouth his residence within less than a
                   year of the date assigned for Henry's birth.]

To what extent Henry of Monmouth's future character and conduct were, under Providence, affected
by the circumstances of his family and its several members, it would perhaps be less philosophical
than presumptuous to define. But, that those circumstances were         (p. 003) peculiarly
calculated to influence him in his principles and views and actions, will be acknowledged by
every one who becomes acquainted with them, and who is at the same time in the least degree
conversant with the growth and workings of the human mind. It must, therefore, fall within
the province of the inquiry instituted in these pages, to take a brief review of the domestic
history of Henry's family through the years of his childhood and early youth.

John, surnamed "of Gaunt," from Ghent or Gand in Flanders, the place of his birth, was the
fourth son of King Edward the Third. At a very early age he married Blanche, daughter and heiress
of Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Lancaster, great-grandson of Henry the Third.[4] The time of
his marriage with Blanche,[5] though recorded with sufficient precision, is indeed comparatively
of little consequence; whilst the date of their son Henry's birth, from the influence which
the age of a father may have on the destinies of his child, becomes matter of much importance
to those who take any interest in the    (p. 004) history of their grandson, Henry of Monmouth.
On this point it has been already intimated that no conclusive evidence is directly upon record.
The principal facts, however, which enable us to draw an inference of high probability, are
associated with so pleasing and so exemplary a custom, though now indeed fallen into great
desuetude among us, that to review them compensates for any disappointment which might be felt
from the want of absolute certainty in the issue of our research. It was Henry of Bolinbroke's
custom[6] every year on the Feast of the Lord's Supper, that is, on the Thursday before Easter,
to clothe as many poor persons as equalled the number of years which he had completed on the
preceding birthday; and by examining the accounts still preserved in the archives of the Duchy
of Lancaster, the details of which would be altogether uninteresting in this place, we are
led to infer that Henry Bolinbroke was born on the 4th of April 1366. Blanche, his mother,
survived the birth of Bolinbroke probably not more than three years. Whether this lady found
in John of Gaunt a faithful and loving husband, or whether his libertinism caused her to pass
her short life in disappointment and sorrow, no authentic document enables us to pronounce.
It is, however, impossible to close our eyes against the painful fact, that Catherine Swynford,
who    (p. 005) was the partner of his guilt during the life of his second wife, Constance,
had been an inmate of his family, as the confidential attendant on his wife Blanche, and the
governess of her daughters, Philippa and Elizabeth of Lancaster. That he afterwards, by a life
of abandoned profligacy, disgraced the religion which he professed, is, unhappily, put beyond
conjecture or vague rumour. Though we cannot infer from any expenses about her funeral and
her memory, that Blanche was the sole object of his affections, (the most lavish costliness
at the tomb of the departed too often being only in proportion to the unkindness shown to the
living,) yet it may be worth observing, that in 1372 we find an entry in the account, of 20l.
paid to two chaplains (together with the expenses of the altar) to say masses for her soul.
He was then already[7] married to his second wife, Constance, daughter of Peter the Cruel,
King of Castile. By this lady, whom he often calls "the Queen," he appears to have had only
one child, married, it is said, to Henry III. King of Castile.[8] Constance, the mother, is
represented to have been one of the most (p. 006) amiable and exemplary persons of the age,
"above other women innocent and devout;" and from her husband she deserved treatment far different
from what it was her unhappy lot to experience. But however severe were her sufferings, she
probably concealed them within her own breast: and she neither left her husband nor abandoned
her duties in disgust. It is indeed possible, though in the highest degree improbable, that
whilst his unprincipled conduct was too notorious to be concealed from others, she was not
herself made fully acquainted with his infidelity towards her. At all events we may indulge
in the belief that she proved to her husband's only legitimate son, Henry (p. 007) of Bolinbroke,
a kind and watchful mother.

                   William, Duke of Holland and Zealand, dying without
                   issue, John of Gaunt succeeded to the undivided
                   estates and honours of the late duke.]

                   [Footnote 5: Froissart reports that Henry
                   Bolinbroke was a handsome young man; and declares
                   that he never saw two such noble dames, nor ever
                   should were he to live a thousand years, so good,
                   liberal, and courteous, as his mother the Lady
                   Blanche, and "the late Queen of England," Philippa
                   of Hainault, wife of Edward the Third. These were
                   the mother, and the consort of John of Gaunt.]

                   [Footnote 6: For this fact and the several items by
                   which it is substantiated, the Author is indebted

                   succeeded in obtaining from the King of Spain very
                   large sums in hand, and hostages for the payment of
                   10,000l. annually to himself and his duchess for
                   life. Wals. Neust. 544.]

                   [Footnote 8: There is an order, dated June 6th,
                   1372, to lodge two pipes of good wine in Kenilworth
                   Priory, and to hasten with all speed Dame Ilote,
                   the midwife, to the Queen Constance at Hertford on
                   horse or in carriage as should be best for her
                   ease. The same person attended the late Duchess
                   Blanche.

                   The Author has lately discovered on the Pell Rolls
                   a payment, dated 21st February 1373, which refers
                   to the birth of a daughter, and at the same time
                   informs us that his future wife was then probably a
                   member of his household. "To Catherine Swynford
                   twenty marks for announcing to the King (Richard
                   the Second) the birth of a daughter of the Queen of
                   Spain, consort of John, King of Castile and Leon,
                   and Duke of Lancaster."

                   The marriage of John of Gaunt with Catherine
                   Swynford took place only the second year after the
                   death of Constance, and seems to have excited among
                   the nobility equal surprise and disgust. "The great
                   ladies of England, (as Stowe reports,) as the
                   Duchess of Gloucester, &c. disdained that she
                   should be matched with the Duke of Lancaster, and
                   by that means accounted second person in the realm,
                   and be preferred in room before them."

                   King Richard however made her a handsome present of
                   a ring, at the same time that he presented one to
                   Henry, Earl of Derby, (Henry IV.) and another to
                   Lady Beauchamp. Pell Rolls.]

At that period of our history, persons married at a much earlier age than is usually the case
among us now; and the espousals of young people often preceded for some years the period of
quitting their parents' home, and living together, as man and wife. In the year 1381 Henry,
at that time only fifteen years of age, was espoused[9] to his future wife, Mary Bohun, daughter
of the Earl of Hereford, who had (p. 008) then not reached her twelfth year. These espousals
were in those days accompanied by the religious service of matrimony, and the bride assumed
the title of her espoused husband.[10]

                   [Footnote 9: In this same year Bolinbroke's life
                   was put into imminent peril during the insurrection
                   headed by Wat Tiler. The rebels broke into the
                   Tower of London, though it was defended by some
                   brave knights and soldiers; seized and murdered the
                   Archbishop and others; and, carrying the heads of
                   their victims on pikes, proceeded in a state of
                   fury to John of Gaunt's palace at the Savoy, which
                   they utterly destroyed and burnt to the ground.
                   Gaunt himself was in the North: but his son
                   Bolinbroke was in the Tower of London, and owed his
                   life to the interposition of one John Ferrour of
                   Southwark. This is a fact not generally known to
                   historians; and since the document which records
                   it, bears testimony to Bolinbroke's spirit of
                   gratitude, it will not be thought out of place to
                   allude to it here. This same John Ferrour, with Sir
                   Thomas Blount and others, was tried in the Castle
                   of Oxford for high treason, in the first year of
                   Henry IV. Blount and the others were condemned and
                   executed; but to John Ferrour a free pardon, dated
                   Monday after the Epiphany, was given, "our Lord the
                   King remembering that in the reign of Richard the
                   Second, during the insurrection of the Counties of
                   Essex and Kent, the said John saved the King's life
                   in the midst of that commonalty, in a wonderful and
                   kind manner, whence the King happily remains alive
                   unto this day. For since every good whatever
                   naturally and of right requires another good in
                   return, the King of his especial grace freely
                   pardons the said John." Plac. Cor. in Cast. Oxon.]

                   [Footnote 10: Thus, in a warrant, dated 6th March
                   1381, an order is given by the Duke for payment to
                   a Goldsmith in London, of 10l. 18s. for a
                   present made by our dear daughter Philippa, to our
                   very dear daughter Mary, Countess of Derby, on the
                   day of her marriage; and also "40 shillings for as
                   many pence put upon the book on the day of the
                   espousals of our much beloved son, the Earl of
                   Derby." Eight marks are ordered to be paid for "a
                   ruby given by us to our very dear daughter Mary:"
                   13s. 4d. for the offering at the mass. Ten
                   marks from us to the King's minstrels being there
                   on the same day; and ten marks to four minstrels of
                   our brother the Earl of Cambridge being there; and
                   fifty marks to the officers of our cousin, the
                   Countess of Hereford! On the 31st of January
                   following, the Duke lays himself under a bond to
                   pay to "Dame Bohun, Countess of Hereford, her
                   mother, the sum of one hundred marks annually, for
                   the charge and cost of his daughter-in-law, Mary,
                   Countess of Derby, until the said Mary shall attain
                   the full age of fourteen years."]

We shall probably not be in error, if we fix the period of the Countess of Derby leaving her
mother's for her husband's roof somewhere in the year 1386, when he was twenty, and she sixteen
years old; and we are not without reason for believing that they made Monmouth Castle their home.

Some modern writers affirm that this was the favourite residence of John of Gaunt's family:
but it is very questionable whether from having themselves experienced the beauty and loveliness
of the spot, they have not been unconsciously tempted to venture this assertion (p. 009) without
historical evidence. Monmouth is indeed situated in one of the fairest and loveliest valleys
within the four seas of Britain. Near its centre, on a rising ground between the river Monnow
(from which the town derives its name) and the Wye and not far from their confluence, the ruins
of the Castle are still visible. The poet Gray looked over it from the side of the Kymin Hill,
when he described the scene before him as "the delight of his eyes, and the very seat of pleasure."
With his testimony, unbiassed as it was by local attachment, it would be unwise to mingle the
feelings of affection entertained by one whose earliest associations, "redolent of joy and
youth," can scarcely rescue his judgment from the suspicion of partiality. At that time John
of Gaunt's estates and princely mansions studded, at various distances, the whole land of England
from its northern border to the southern coast. And whether he allowed Henry of Bolinbroke
to select for himself from the ample pages of his rent-roll the spot to which he would take
his bride, or whether he assigned it of his own choice to his son as the fairest of his possessions;
or whether any other cause determined the place of Henry the Fifth's birth, we have no reasonable
ground for doubting that he was born in the Castle of Monmouth, on the 9th of August 1387.

Of Monmouth Castle, the dwindling ruins are now very scanty, and in point of architecture present
nothing worthy of an antiquary's     (p. 010) research. They are washed by the streams of the
Monnow, and are embosomed in gardens and orchards, clothing the knoll on which they stand;
the aspect of the southern walls, and the rocky character of the soil admirably adapting them
for the growth of the vine, and the ripening of its fruits. In the memory of some old inhabitants,
who were not gathered to their fathers when the Author could first take an interest in such
things, and who often amused his childhood with tales of former days, the remains of the Hall
of Justice were still traceable within the narrowed pile; and the crumbling bench on which
the Justices of the Circuit once sate, was often usurped by the boys in their mock trials of
judge and jury. Somewhat more than half a century ago, a gentleman whose garden reached to
one of the last remaining towers, had reason to be thankful for a marked interposition in his
behalf of the protecting hand of Providence. He was enjoying himself on a summer's evening
in an alcove built under the shelter and shade of the castle, when a gust of wind blew out
the candle by his side, just at the time when he felt disposed to replenish and rekindle his
pipe. He went consequently with the lantern in his hand towards his house, intending to renew
his evening's recreation; but he had scarcely reached the door when the wall fell, burying
his retreat, and the entire slope, with its shrubs and flowers and fruits, under one mass of ruin.

From this castle, tradition says, that being a sickly child, Henry (p. 011) was taken to Courtfield,
at the distance of six or seven miles from Monmouth, to be nursed there. That tradition is
doubtless very ancient; and the cradle itself in which Henry is said to have been rocked, was
shown there till within these few years, when it was sold, and taken from the house. It has
since changed hands, if it be any longer in existence. The local traditions, indeed, in the
neighbourhood of Courtfield and Goodrich are almost universally mingled with the very natural
mistake that, when Henry of Monmouth was born, his father was king; and so far a shade of improbability
may be supposed to invest them all alike; yet the variety of them in that one district, and
the total absence of any stories relative to the same event on every other side of Monmouth,
should seem to countenance a belief that some real foundation existed for the broad and general
features of these traditionary tales. Thus, though the account acquiesced in by some writers,
that the Marchioness of Salisbury was Henry of Monmouth's nurse at Courtfield, may have originated
in an officious anxiety to supply an infant prince with a nurse suitable to his royal birth;
still, probably, that appendage would not have been annexed to a story utterly without foundation,
and consequently throws no incredibility on the fact that the eldest son of the young Earl
of Derby was nursed at Courtfield. Thus, too, though the recorded salutation of the ferryman
of Goodrich congratulates his Majesty on the birth of a   (p. 012) noble prince, as the King
was hastening from his court and palace of Windsor to his castle of Monmouth; yet the unstationary
habits of Bolingbroke, his love of journeyings and travels, and his restlessness at home, render
it very probable that he was absent from Monmouth even when the hour of perilous anxiety was
approaching; and thus on his return homeward (perhaps too from Richard's court at Windsor)
the first tidings of the safety of his Countess and the birth of the young lord may have saluted
him as he crossed the Wye at Goodrich Ferry. So again in the little village of Cruse, lying
between the church and the castle of Goodrich, the cottagers still tell, from father to son,
as they have told for centuries over their winter's hearth, how the herald, hurrying from Monmouth
to Goodrich fast as whip and spur could urge his steed onward, with the tidings of the Prince
of Wales' birth, fell headlong, (the horse dropping under him in the short, steep, and rugged
lane leading to the ravine, beyond which the castle stands,) and was killed on the spot. No
doubt the idea of its being the news of a prince's birth, that was thus posted on, has added,
in the imagination of the villagers, to the horse's fleetness and the breathless impetuosity
of the messenger; but it is very probable that the news of the young lord's birth, heir to
the dukedom of Lancaster, should have been hastened from the castle of Monmouth to Goodrich;
and there is no solid reason for discrediting the story.           (p. 013)

Still, beyond tradition, there is no evidence at all to fix the young lord either at Courtfield,
or indeed at Monmouth, for any period subsequently to his birth. On the contrary, several items
of expense in the "Wardrobe account of Henry, Earl of Derby," would induce us to infer either
that the tradition is unfounded, or that at the utmost the infant lord was nursed at Courtfield
only for a few months. In that account[11] we find an entry of a charge for a "long gown" for
the young lord Henry; and also the payment of 2l. to a midwife for her attendance on the Countess
during her confinement at the birth of the young lord Thomas, the gift of the Earl, "at London".
By this document it is proved that Henry's younger brother, the future Duke of Clarence, was
born before October 1388, and that some time in the preceding year Henry was himself still
in the long robes of an infant; and that the family had removed from Monmouth to London. In
the Wardrobe expenses of the Countess for the same year, we find several items of sums defrayed
for the clothes of the young lords Henry and Thomas together, but no allusion whatever to the
brothers being separate: one entry,[12] fixing Thomas and his nurse at Kenilworth soon after
his birth, leaves no ground for supposing that his      (p. 014) elder brother was either at
Monmouth or at Courtfield. It may be matter of disappointment and of surprise that Henry's
name does not occur in connexion with the place of his birth in any single contemporary document
now known. The fact, however, is so. But whilst the place of Henry's nursing is thus left in
uncertainty, the name of his nurse--in itself a matter not of the slightest importance--is
made known to us not only in the Wardrobe account of his mother, but also by a gratifying circumstance,
which bears direct testimony to his own kind and grateful, and considerate and liberal mind.
Her name was Johanna Waring; on whom, very shortly after he ascended the throne, he settled
an annuity of 20l. "in consideration of good service done to him in former days."[13]

                   [Footnote 11: Between 30th Sept. 1387 and 1st Oct.
                   1388.]

                   [Footnote 12: An item of five yards of cloth for
                   the bed of the nurse of Thomas at Kenilworth; and
                   an ell of canvass for his cradle.]

                   [Footnote 13: This is one of those incidents,
                   occurring now and then, the discovery of which
                   repays the antiquary or the biographer for wading,
                   with toilsome search, through a confused mass of
                   uninteresting details, and often encourages him to
                   persevere when he begins to feel weary and
                   disappointed.]

Very few incidents are recorded which can throw light upon Henry's childhood, and for those
few we are indebted chiefly to the dry details of account-books. In these many particular items
of expense occur relative as well to Henry as to his brothers; which, probably, would differ
very little from those of other young noblemen of England at that period of her history. The
records of the Duchy of Lancaster provide us with a very scanty supply of such particulars
as convey (p. 015) any interesting information on the circumstances and occupations and amusements
of Henry of Monmouth. From these records, however, we learn that he was attacked by some complaint,
probably both sudden and dangerous, in the spring of 1395; for among the receiver's accounts
is found the charge of "6s. 8d. for Thomas Pye, and a horse hired at London, March 18th, to
carry him to Leicester with all speed, on account of the illness of the young lord Henry."
In the year 1397, when he was just ten years old, a few entries occur, somewhat interesting,
as intimations of his boyish pursuits. Such are the charge of "8d. paid by the hands of Adam
Garston for harpstrings purchased for the harp of the young lord Henry," and "12d. to Stephen
Furbour for a new scabbard of a sword for young lord Henry," and "1s. 6d. for three-fourths
of an ounce of tissue of black silk bought at London of Margaret Stranson for a sword of young
lord Henry." Whilst we cannot but be sometimes amused by the minuteness with which the expenditure
of the smallest sum in so large an establishment as John of Gaunt's is detailed, these little
incidents prepare us for the statement given of Henry's early youth by the chroniclers,--that
he was fond both of minstrelsy and of military exercises.

The same dry pages, however, assure us that his more severe studies were not neglected. In
the accounts for the year ending February 1396, we find a charge of "4s. for seven books of
Grammar contained    (p. 016) in one volume, and bought at London for the young Lord Henry."
The receiver-general's record informs us of the name of the lord Humfrey's tutor;[14] but who
was appointed to instruct the young lord Henry does not appear; nor can we tell how soon he
was put under the guidance of Henry Beaufort. If, as we have reason to believe, he had that
celebrated man as his instructor, or at least the superintendent of his studies, in Oxford
so early as 1399, we may not, perhaps, be mistaken in conjecturing, that even this volume of
Grammar was first learned under the direction of the future Cardinal.

                   [Footnote 14: "Thomæ Rothwell informanti Humfridum
                   filium Domini Regis pro salario suo de termino
                   Paschæ, 13s. 4d."--1 Hen. IV.]

Scanty as are the materials from which we must weave our opinion with regard to the first years
of Henry of Monmouth, they are sufficient to suggest many reflections upon the advantages as
well as the unfavourable circumstances which attended him: We must first, however, revert to
a few more particulars relative to his family and its chief members.

His father, who was then about twenty-four years of age, certainly left England[15] between
the 6th of May 1390 and the 30th of April (p. 017) 1391, and proceeded to Barbary. During his
absence his Countess was delivered of Humfrey, his fourth son. Between the summers of 1392
and 1393 he undertook a journey to Prussia, and to the Holy Sepulchre.

                   [Footnote 15: The treasurer's account, during the
                   Earl's absence, contains some items which remove
                   all doubt from this statement: among others, 20l.
                   to Lancaster the herald, on Nov. 5, going toward
                   England; and in the same month, to three
                   "persuivantes," being with the Earl, eight nobles;
                   and to a certain English sailor, carrying the news
                   of the birth of Humfrey, son of my lord, 13s.
                   4d.]

The next year visited Henry with one of the most severe losses which can befall a youth of
his age. His mother,[16] then only twenty-four years old, having given birth to four sons and
two daughters, was taken away from the anxious cares and comforts of her earthly career, in
the very prime of life.[17] Nor was this the only bereavement which befell the family at this
time. Constance, the second wife of John of Gaunt, a lady to whose religious and moral worth
the strongest and warmest testimony is borne by the chroniclers of the time; and who might
(had it so pleased the Disposer of all things) have watched  (p. 018) over the education of
her husband's grandchildren, was also this same year removed from them to her rest: they were
both buried at Leicester, then one of the chief residences of the family.

                   [Footnote 16: King Richard II, the Duke of
                   Lancaster, and his son, Henry of Bolinbroke, became
                   widowers in the same year.]

                   [Footnote 17: That Henry cherished the memory of
                   his mother with filial tenderness, may be inferred
                   from the circumstance that only two months after he
                   succeeded to the throne, and had the means and the
                   opportunity of testifying his grateful remembrance
                   of her, we find money paid "in advance to William
                   Goodyere for newly devising and making an image in
                   likeness of the Mother of the present lord the
                   King, ornamented with diverse arms of the kings of
                   England, and placed over the tomb of the said
                   king's mother, within the King's College at
                   Leicester, where she is buried and entombed."--Pell
                   Rolls, May 20, 1413.]

The mind cannot contemplate the case of either of these ladies without feelings of pity rather
than of envy. They were both nobly born, and nobly married; and yet the elder was joined to
a man, who, to say the very least, shared his love for her with another; and the younger, though
requiring, every year of her married state, all the attention and comfort and support of an
affectionate husband, yet was more than once left to experience a temporary widowhood. And
if we withdraw our thoughts from those of whom this family was then deprived, there is little
to lessen our estimate of their loss, when we think of those whom they left behind. Henry's
maternal grandmother, indeed, the Countess of Hereford, survived her daughter many years; and
we are not without an intimation that she at least interested herself in her grandson's welfare.
In his will, dated 1415, he bequeaths to Thomas, Bishop of Durham, "the missal and portiphorium[18]
which we had of the gift of our dear grandmother, the Countess of Hereford."[19] We may fairly
infer from this circumstance that Henry had at least one    (p. 019) near relation both able
and willing to guide him in the right way. How far opportunities were afforded her of exercising
her maternal feelings towards him, cannot now be ascertained; and with the exception of this
noble lady, there is no other to whom we can turn with entire satisfaction, when we contemplate
the salutary effects either of precept or example in the case of Henry of Monmouth.

                   [Footnote 18: The portiphorium was a breviary,
                   containing directions as to the services of the
                   church.]

                   [Footnote 19: He bequeaths also, in the same will,
                   "to Joan, Countess of Hereford, our dear
                   grandmother, a gold cyphus." This lady, however,
                   died before Henry. In the Pell Rolls we find the
                   payment of "442l. 17s. 5d. to Robert Darcy
                   and others, executors of Joan de Bohun, late
                   Countess of Hereford, on account of live and dead
                   stock belonging to her, February 27, 1421."]

His father indeed was a gallant young knight, often distinguishing himself at justs and tournaments;[20]
of an active, ardent and enterprising spirit; nor is any imputation against his moral character
found recorded. But we have no ground for believing, that he devoted much of his time and thoughts
to the education of his children.

                   [Footnote 20: Soon after Henry IV's accession, the
                   Pell Rolls, May 8, 1401, record the payment of
                   "10l. to Bertolf Vander Eure, who fenced with the
                   present lord the King with the long sword, and was
                   hurt in the neck by the said lord the King." The
                   Chronicle of London for 1386 says "there were
                   joustes at Smithfield. There bare him well Sir
                   Harry of Derby, the Duke's son of Lancaster."]

Henry Beaufort, the natural son of John of Gaunt, a person of commanding talent, and of considerable
attainments for that age, whilst there is no reason to believe him to have been that abandoned
worldling whose eyes finally closed in black despair without a     (p. 020) hope of Heaven,
yet was not the individual to whose training a Christian parent would willingly intrust the
education of his child. And in John of Gaunt[21] himself, little perhaps can be discovered
either in principle, or judgment, or conduct, which his grandson could imitate with religious
and moral profit. Thus we find Henry of Monmouth in his childhood labouring under many disadvantages.
Still our knowledge of the domestic arrangements and private circumstances of his family is
confessedly very limited; and it would be unwise to conclude that there were no mitigating
causes in operation, nor any advantages to put as a counterpoise into the opposite scale. He
may have been under the guidance and tuition of a good Christian and   (p. 021) well-informed
man; he may have been surrounded by companions whose acquaintance would be a blessing. But
this is all conjecture; and probably the question is now beyond the reach of any satisfactory
solution.

                   [Footnote 21: The Author would gladly have
                   presented to the reader a different portrait of the
                   religious and moral character of "Old John of
                   Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster;" but a careful
                   examination of the testimony of his enemies and of
                   his eulogists, as well as of the authentic
                   documents of his own household, seems to leave no
                   other alternative, short of the sacrifice of truth.
                   Godwin, in his Life of Chaucer, has undertaken his
                   defence, but on such unsound principles of morality
                   as must be reprobated by every true lover of
                   Religion and Virtue. The same domestic register of
                   the Duchy which records the wages paid to the
                   adulteress, and the duke's losses by gambling,
                   proves (as many other family accounts would prove)
                   that no fortune however princely can supply the
                   unbounded demands of profligacy and dissipation.
                   Even John of Gaunt, with his immense possessions,
                   was driven to borrow money. This fact is
                   accompanied in the record by the curious
                   circumstance, that an order is given for the
                   employment of three or four stout yeomen, because
                   of the danger of the road, to guard the bearers of
                   a loan made by the Earl of Arundel to the Duke, and
                   sent from Shrewsbury to London.]

With regard to the next step also in young Henry's progress towards manhood, we equally depend
upon tradition for the views which we may be induced to take: still it is a tradition in which
we shall probably acquiesce without great danger of error. He is said to have been sent to
Oxford, and to have studied in "The Queen's College" under the tuition of Henry Beaufort, his
paternal uncle, then Chancellor of the University. No document is known to exist among the
archives of the College or of the University, which can throw any light on this point; except
that the fact has been established of Henry Beaufort having been admitted a member of Queen's
College, and of his having been chancellor of the university only for the year 1398.

This extraordinary man was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln, July 14, 1398, as appears by the
Episcopal Register of that See; after which he did not reside in Oxford. If therefore Henry
of Monmouth studied under him in that university, it must have been through the spring and
summer of that year, the eleventh of his age. And on this we may rely as the most probable
fact. Certainly in the old buildings of Queen's College, a chamber used to be pointed out by
successive generations as Henry the Fifth's. It stood over the gateway opposite to St.    
(p. 022) Edmund's Hall. A portrait of him in painted glass, commemorative of the circumstance,
was seen in the window, with an inscription (as it should seem of comparatively recent date)
in Latin:

        To record the fact for ever.
         The Emperor of Britain,
       The Triumphant Lord of France,
 The Conqueror of his enemies and of himself,
                Henry V.
          Of this little chamber,
        Once the great Inhabitant.[22]

                   [Footnote 22: Fuller in his Church History, having
                   informed us that Henry's chamber over the College
                   gate was then inhabited by the historian's friend
                   Thomas Barlow, adds "His picture remaineth there to
                   this day in brass".]

It may be observed that in the tender age of Henry involved in this supposition, there is nothing
in the least calculated to throw a shade of improbability on this uniform tradition. Many in
those days became members of the university at the time of life when they would now be sent
to school.[23] And possibly we shall be most right in supposing that Henry (though perhaps
without himself being enrolled among the regular academics) lived with his uncle, then chancellor,
and studied under his superintendence. There is nothing on record (hitherto    (p. 023) discovered)
in the slightest degree inconsistent with this view; whereas if we were inclined to adopt the
representation of some (on what authority it does not appear) that Henry was sent to Oxford
soon after his father ascended the throne, many and serious difficulties would present themselves.
In the first place his uncle, who was legitimated only the year before, was prematurely made
Bishop of Lincoln by the Pope, through the interest of John of Gaunt, in the year 1398, and
never resided in Oxford afterwards. How old he was at his consecration, has not yet been satisfactorily
established; conjecture would lead us to regard him as a few years only (perhaps ten or twelve)
older than his nephew. Otterbourne tells us that he was made Bishop[24] when yet a boy.

                   [Footnote 23: Those who were designed for the
                   military profession were compelled to bear arms,
                   and go to the field at the age of fifteen:
                   consequently the little education they received was
                   confined to their boyhood.]

                   [Footnote 24: "Admodum parvo."]

In the next place we can scarcely discover six months in Henry's life after his uncle's consecration,
through which we can with equal probability suppose him to have passed his time in Oxford.
It is next to certain that before the following October term, he had been removed into King
Richard's palace, carefully watched (as we shall see hereafter); whilst in the spring of the
following year, 1399, he was unquestionably obliged to accompany that monarch in his expedition
to Ireland. Shortly after his return, in the autumn of that year, on his father's accession
to the throne, he was created Prince of Wales; and through the following spring the probability
is strong that his father was too anxiously engaged in negotiating a marriage between him 
(p. 024) and a daughter of the French King, and too deeply interested in providing for him
an adequate establishment in the metropolis, to take any measures for improving and cultivating
his mind in the university. Independently of which we may be fully assured that had he become
a student of the University of Oxford as Prince of Wales, it would not have been left to chance,
to deliver his name down to after-ages: the archives of the University would have furnished
direct and contemporary evidence of so remarkable a fact; and the College would have with pride
enrolled him at the time among its members: as the boy of the Earl of Derby, or the Duke of
Hereford, living with his uncle, there is nothing[25] in the omission of his name inconsistent
with our hypothesis. At all events, whatever evidence exists of Henry having resided under
any circumstances in Oxford, fixes him there under the tuition of the future Cardinal; and
that well-known personage is proved not to have resided there subsequently to his appointment
to the see[26] of Lincoln, in the summer of 1398.[27]

                   [Footnote 25: On the 29th of the preceding

                   which the Author is indebted to the present Bishop)

                   Beaufort's consecration from July 14, 1398.]

                   [Footnote 27: It is a curious fact, not generally
                   known, that Henry IV. in the first year of his
                   reign took possession of all the property of the
                   Provost and Fellows of Queen's College (on the
                   ground of mismanagement), and appointed the
                   Chancellor, the Chief Justice, the Master of the
                   Rolls, and others, guardians of the College. This
                   is scarcely consistent with the supposition of his
                   son being resident there at the time, or of his
                   selecting that college for him afterwards.]

What were Henry's studies in Oxford, whether, like Ingulphus some  (p. 025) centuries before,
he drank to his fill of "Aristotle's[28] Philosophy and Cicero's Rhetoric," or whether his
mind was chiefly directed to the scholastic theology so prevalent in his day, it were fruitless
(p. 026) to inquire. His uncle (as we have already intimated) seems to have been a person of
some learning, an excellent man of business, and in the command of a ready eloquence. In establishing
his positions    (p. 027) before the parliament, we find him not only quoting from the Bible,
(often, it must be acknowledged, without any strict propriety of application,) but also citing
facts from ancient Grecian history. We may, however, safely conclude that the Chancellor of
Oxford confined himself to the general superintendence of his nephew's education, intrusting
the details to others more competent to instruct him in the various branches of literature.
It is very probable that to some arrangement of that kind Henry was indebted for his acquaintance
with such excellent men as his friends John Carpenter of Oriel, and Thomas Rodman, or Rodburn,
of Merton.[29]

                   [Footnote 28: The Author trusts to be pardoned, if
                   he suffers these conjectures on Henry's studies in
                   Oxford to tempt him to digress in this note further
                   than the strict rules of unity might approve. They
                   brought a lively image to his mind of the
                   occupations and confessions of one of the earliest
                   known sons of Alma Mater. Perhaps Ingulphus is the
                   first upon record who, having laid the foundation
                   of his learning at Westminster, proceeded for its
                   further cultivation to Oxford. From the
                   biographical sketch of his own life, we learn that
                   he was born of English parents and a native of the
                   fair city of London. Whilst a schoolboy at
                   Westminster, he was so happy as to have interested
                   in his behalf Egitha, daughter of Earl Godwin, and
                   queen of Edward the Confessor. He describes his
                   patroness as a lady of great beauty, well versed in
                   literature, of most pure chastity and exalted moral
                   feeling, together with pious humbleness of mind,
                   tainted by no spot of her father's or her brother's
                   barbarism, but mild and modest, honest and
                   faithful, and the enemy of no human being. In
                   confirmation of his estimate of her excellence, he
                   quotes a Latin verse current in his day, not very
                   complimentary to her sire: "As a thorn is the
                   parent of the rose, so was Godwin of Egitha." I
                   have often seen her (he continues) when I have been
                   visiting my father in the palace. Many a time, as
                   she met me on my return from school, would she
                   examine me in my scholarship and verses; and
                   turning with the most perfect familiarity from the
                   solidity of grammar to the playfulness of logic, in
                   which she was well skilled, when she had caught me
                   and held me fast by some subtle chain, she would
                   always direct her maid to give me three or four
                   pieces of money, and sending me off to the royal
                   refectory would dismiss me after my refreshment."
                   It is possible that many of our fair countrywomen
                   in the highest ranks now, are not aware that, more
                   than eight hundred years ago, their fair and noble
                   predecessors could play with a Westminster scholar
                   in grammar, verses, and logic. Egitha left behind
                   her an example of high religious, moral, and
                   literary worth, by imitating which, not perhaps in
                   its literal application, but certainly in its
                   spirit, the noble born among us will best uphold
                   and adorn their high station. Ingulphus (in the
                   very front of whose work the Author thinks he sees
                   the stamp of raciness and originality, though he
                   cannot here enter into the question of its
                   genuineness) tells us then, how he made proficiency
                   beyond many of his equals in mastering the
                   doctrines of Aristotle, and covered himself to the
                   very ankles in Cicero's Rhetoric. But, alas, for
                   the vanity of human nature! His confession here
                   might well suggest reflections of practical wisdom
                   to many a young man who may be tempted, as was
                   Ingulphus, in the university or the wide world, to
                   neglect and despise his father's roof and his
                   father's person, after success in the world may
                   have raised him in society above the humble station
                   of his birth,--a station from which perhaps the
                   very struggles and privations of that parent
                   himself may have enabled him to emerge. "Growing up
                   a young man (he says) I felt a sort of disdainful
                   loathing at the straitened and lowly circumstances
                   of my parents, and desired to leave my paternal
                   hearth, hankering after the halls of kings and of
                   the great, and daily longing more and more to array
                   myself in the gayest and most luxurious costume."
                   Ingulphus lived to repent, and to be ashamed of his
                   weakness and folly.]

                   [Footnote 29: John Carpenter. This learned and good
                   man could not have been much, if at all, Henry's
                   senior. He was made Bishop of Worcester (not as
                   Goodwin says by Henry V. but) in the year 1443. He
                   died in 1476; so that if he was in Oxford when we
                   suppose Henry to have studied there and to have
                   been only his equal in age, he would have been
                   nearly ninety when he died. Thomas Rodman was an
                   eminent astronomer as well as a learned divine, of
                   Merton College. He was not promoted to a bishopric
                   till two years after Henry's death.

                   Among other learned and pious men who were much
                   esteemed by Henry, we find especially mentioned
                   Robert Mascall, confessor to his father, and
                   Stephen Partington. The latter was a very popular
                   preacher, whom some of the nobility invited to
                   court. Henry, delighted with his eloquence, treated
                   him with favour and affectionate regard, and
                   advanced him to the see of St. David's. Robert
                   Mascall was of the order of Friars Carmelites. In
                   1402 he was ordered to be continually about the
                   King's person, for the advantage and health of his
                   soul. Two years afterwards he was advanced to the
                   see of Hereford. Pell Rolls.]

But whatever course of study was chalked out for him, and through  (p. 028) however long or
short a period before the summer of 1398, or under what guides soever he pursued it, it is
impossible to read his letters, and reflect on what is authentically recorded of him, without
being involuntarily impressed by an assurance that he had imbibed a very considerable knowledge
of Holy Scripture, even beyond the young men of his day. His conduct also in after-life would
prepare us for the testimony borne to him by chroniclers, that "he held in great veneration
such as surpassed in learning and virtue." Still, whilst we regret that history throws no fuller
light on the early days of Henry of Monmouth, we cannot but hope that in the hidden treasures
of manuscripts hereafter to be again brought into the light of day, much may be yet ascertained
on satisfactory evidence; and we must leave the subject to those more favoured times.[30]

                   [Footnote 30: Many ancient documents (of the
                   existence of which in past years, often not very
                   remote, there can be no doubt,) now, unhappily for
                   those who would bring the truth to light, are in a
                   state of abeyance or of perdition. To mention only
                   one example; the work of Peter Basset, who was
                   chamberlain to Henry V. and attended him in his
                   wars, referred to by Goodwin, and reported to be in
                   the library of the College of Arms, is no longer in
                   existence; at least it has disappeared and not a
                   trace of it can be found there.]

But whilst doubts may still be thought to hang over the exact time and the duration of Henry's
academical pursuits, it is matter of       (p. 029) historical certainty, that an event took
place in the autumn of 1398, which turned the whole stream of his life into an entirely new
channel, and led him by a very brief course to the inheritance of the throne of England. His
father, hitherto known as the Earl of Derby, was created Duke of Hereford by King Richard II.
Very shortly after his creation, he stated openly in parliament[31] that the Duke of Norfolk,
whilst they were riding together between Brentford and London, had assured him of the King's
intention to get rid of them both, and also of the Duke of Lancaster with other noblemen, of
whose designs against his throne or person he was apprehensive. The Duke of Norfolk denied
the charge, and a trial of battle was appointed to decide the merits of the question. The King,
doubting probably the effect on himself of the issue of that wager of battle, postponed the
day from time to time. At length he fixed finally upon the 16th of September, and summoned
the two noblemen to redeem their pledges at Coventry. Very splendid preparations had been made
for the struggle; and the whole kingdom shewed the most anxious interest in the result. On
the day appointed, the Lord High Constable and the Lord High Marshal of England, with a very
great company, and splendidly arrayed, first entered the lists. About the hour of prime the
Duke of Hereford appeared at the barriers on a white courser, barbed with blue and  (p. 030)
green velvet, sumptuously embroidered with swans and antelopes[32] of goldsmith's work,[33]
and armed at all points. The King himself soon after entered with great pomp, attended by the
peers of the realm, and above ten thousand men in arms to prevent any tumult. The Duke of Norfolk
then came on a steed "barbed with crimson velvet embroidered with mulberry-trees and lions
of silver." At the proclamation of the herald, Hereford sprang upon his horse, and advanced
six or seven paces to meet his adversary. The king upon this suddenly threw down his warder,
and commanded the spears to be taken from the combatants, and that they should resume their
chairs of state. He then ordered proclamation to be made that the Duke of Hereford had honourably[34]
fulfilled his duty; and yet, without assigning any reason, he immediately sentenced him to
be banished for ten years: at the same time he condemned the Duke of Norfolk to perpetual exile,
adding also the confiscation of his property, except only one thousand pounds by the year.
This act of tyranny towards Bolinbroke,[35] contrary,    (p. 031) as the chroniclers say, to
the known laws and customs of the realm, as well as to the principles of common justice, led
by direct consequence to the subversion of Richard's throne, and probably to his premature death.

                   [Footnote 31: Rot. Parl. 21 Rich. II. & Rot. Cart.]

                   [Footnote 32: It is curious to find that when Henry
                   V. met his intended bride Katharine of France, the
                   tent prepared for him by her mother the Queen, was
                   composed of blue and green velvet, and embroidered
                   with the figures of antelopes.]

                   [Footnote 33: The Duke of Hereford's armour was
                   exceedingly costly and splendid. He had sent to
                   Italy to procure it on purpose for that day; he
                   spared no expense in its preparation; and it was
                   forwarded to him by the Duke of Milan.]

                   [Footnote 34: "Rex proclamari fecit quod Dux
                   Herefordiæ debitum suum honorificè
                   adimplesset."--Wals. 356.]

                   [Footnote 35: The "Chronicle of London" asserts
                   that Richard sought and obtained from the Pope of
                   Rome a confirmation of his statutes and ordinances
                   made at this time.]

Whilst however the people sympathized with the Duke of Hereford, and reproached the King for
his rashness, as impolitic as it was iniquitous, they seemed to view in the sentence of the
Duke of Norfolk, the visitation of divine justice avenging on his head the cruel murder of
the Duke of Gloucester. It was remarked (says Walsingham) that the sentence was passed on him
by Richard on the very same day of the year on which, only one twelvemonth before, he had caused
that unhappy prince to be suffocated in Calais.

CHAPTER II.

1398-1399.

The first years of Henry of Monmouth fall, in part at least, as we have seen, within the province
of conjecture rather than of authentic history: and the facts for reasonable conjecture to
work upon are much more scanty with regard to this royal child, than we find to be the case
with many persons far less renowned, and still further removed from our day. But from the date
of his father's banishment, very few months in any one year elapse without supplying some clue,
which enables us to trace him step by step through the whole career of his eventful life, to
the very last day and hour of his mortal existence.

His father's exile dates from October 13, 1398, when Henry had just concluded his eleventh
year. Whether up to that time he had been   (p. 033) living chiefly in his father's house,
or with his grandfather John of Gaunt, or with his maternal grandmother, or with his uncle
Henry Beaufort either at Oxford or elsewhere, we have no positive evidence. John of Gaunt did
not die till the 3rd of the following February, and he would, doubtless, have taken his grandson
under his especial care, at all events on his father's banishment, probably assigning Henry
Beaufort to be his tutor and governor. But when Richard sentenced Henry of Bolinbroke, he was
too sensible of his own injustice, and too much alive, in this instance at least, to his own
danger, to suffer Henry of Monmouth to remain at large. One of the most ancient, and most widely
adopted principles of tyranny, pronounces the man "to be a fool, who when he makes away with
a father, leaves the son in power to avenge his parent's wrongs." Accordingly Richard took
immediate possession of the persons both of the son of the murdered Duke of Gloucester, and
of Henry of Monmouth, of whose relatives, as the chroniclers say, he had reason to be especially
afraid.

John of Gaunt, we may conclude, now disabled as he was, by those infirmities[36] which hastened
him to the grave[37] more rapidly than the mere progress of calm decay, could exert no effectual
means    (p. 034) either of sheltering his son from the unjust tyrant who sentenced him to
ten years banishment from his native land, or of rescuing his grandson from the close custody
of the same oppressor. Still the very name of that renowned duke must have put some restraint
upon his royal nephew. The lion had yet life, and might put forth one dying effort, if the
oppression were carried past his endurance; and it might have been thought well to let him
linger and slumber on, till nature should have struggled with him finally. We find, consequently,
that though before Bolinbroke's departure from England Richard had remitted four years of his
banishment, as a sort of peace-offering perhaps to John of Gaunt, no sooner was that formidable
person dead, than Richard, throwing off all semblance of moderation, exiled Bolinbroke for
life, and seized and confiscated his property.[38]

                   [Footnote 36: See the Remains of Thomas Gascoyne, a
                   contemporary writer. Brit. Mus. 2 I. d. p. 530.]

                   [Footnote 37: John of Gaunt died on the 3rd of
                   February 1399, at the house of the Bishop of Ely in
                   Holborn. Will. Worc.]

                   [Footnote 38: Two candelabra which belonged to
                   Henry Duke of Lancaster, were presented by Richard
                   to the abbot and convent of Westminster, 30th June
                   1399.--Pell Rolls. He also granted to Catherine
                   Swynford, the late duke's widow, some of the
                   possessions which she had enjoyed before, but which
                   had fallen into the king's hands by the
                   confiscation of the present duke's property.--Pat.
                   22 Ric. II. Froissart expressly says, that Richard
                   confiscated Bolinbroke's estates, and divided them
                   among his own favourites. He acquaints us,
                   moreover, with an act of cruel persecution and
                   enmity on the part of Richard, which must have
                   rendered Bolinbroke's exile far more galling, and
                   have exasperated him far more bitterly against his
                   persecutor. Richard, says Froissart, sent Lord
                   Salisbury over to France on express purpose to
                   break off the contemplated marriage between
                   Bolinbroke and the daughter of the Duke of Berry,
                   in the presence of the French court calling him a
                   false and wicked traitor. Ed. 1574. Vol. iv. p.
                   290.]

Though Richard behaved towards Bolinbroke with such reckless       (p. 035) injustice, he does
not appear to have been forgetful of his wants during his exile. Within two months of the date
of his banishment the Pell Rolls record payment (14 November 1398) "of a thousand marks to
the Duke of Hereford, of the King's gift, for the aid and support of himself, and the supply
of his wants, on his retirement from England to parts beyond the seas assigned for his sojourn."
And on the 20th of the following June payment is recorded of "1586l. 13s. 4d. part of the 2000l.
which the king had granted to him, to be advanced annually at the usual times." But this was
a poor compensation for the honours and princely possessions of the Dukedom of Lancaster, and
the comforts of his home. No wonder if he were often found, as historians tell, in deep depression
of spirits, whilst he thought of "his four brave boys, and two lovely daughters," now doubly
orphans.

The plan of this work does not admit of any detailed enumeration of the exactions, nor of any
minute inquiry into the violence and reckless tyranny of Richard. It cannot be doubted that
a long series of oppressive measures at this time alienated the affections of many of his subjects,
and exposed his person and his throne to the      (p. 036) attacks of proud and powerful, as
well as injured and insulted enemies. His conduct appears to evince little short of infatuation.
He was determined to act the part of a tyrant with a high hand, and he defied the consequences
of his rashness. He had stopped his ears to sounds which must have warned him of dangers setting
thick around him from every side; and he had wilfully closed his eyes, and refused to look
towards the precipice whither he was every day hastening.[39] He rushed on, despising the danger,
till he fell once, and for ever. The murder of the Duke of Gloucester, involving on the part
of the king one of the most base and cold-hearted pieces of treachery ever recorded of any
ruthless tyrant, had filled the whole realm with indignation; and chroniclers do not hesitate
to affirm that Richard would have been then deposed and destroyed, had it not been for the
interposition of John of Gaunt; and now the eldest son of that very man, who alone had sheltered
him from his people's vengeance, Richard banishes for ever without cause, confiscating his
princely estates, and pursuing him with bitter and insulting vengeance even in his exile.

                   [Footnote 39: The chroniclers give us an idea of
                   expense in Richard both about his person, his
                   houses, and his presents, which exceeds belief.
                   Both the Monk of Evesham and the author of the
                   Sloane Manuscript speak of a single robe which cost
                   thirty thousand marks.]

If his own reason had not warned him beforehand against such       (p. 037) self-destroying
acts of iniquity and violence, yet the signs of the popular feeling which followed them, would
have recalled any but an infatuated man to a sense of the danger into which he was plunging.
When Henry of Bolinbroke left London for his exile, forty thousand persons are said to have
been in the streets lamenting his fate; and the mayor, accompanied by a large body of the higher
class of citizens, attended him on his way as far as Dartford; and some never left him till
they saw him embark at Dover.[40] But to all these clear and strong indications of the tone
and temper of his subjects, Richard was obstinately blind and deaf. If he heard and saw them,
he hardened himself against the only practical influence which they were calculated to produce.
Setting the approaching political storm, and every moral peril, at defiance, he quitted England
just as though he were leaving behind him contented and devoted subjects.

                   [Footnote 40: Froissart tells us that Bolinbroke
                   was much beloved in London. He represents also his
                   reception in France to have been most cordial;
                   every city opening its gates to welcome him.--See
                   Froissart, vol. iv. p. 280.]

Having assigned Wallingford Castle for the residence of his Queen Isabel, he departed for Ireland
about the 18th of May; but did not set sail from Milford Haven till the 29th; he reached Waterford
on the last day of the month. Though Richard[41] was prompted solely by   (p. 038) reasons
of policy and by a regard to his own safety to take with him to Ireland Henry of Monmouth,
(together with Humphrey, son of the murdered Duke of Gloucester,) we should do him great injustice
were we to suppose that he treated him as an enemy.[42] On the contrary, we have reason to
believe that he behaved towards him with great kindness and respect.[43]

                   [Footnote 41: Froissart says that Richard sent
                   expressly both to Northumberland and Hotspur,
                   requiring their attendance in his expedition to
                   Ireland; that they both refused; and that he
                   banished them the realm. Vol. iv. p. 295.]

                   [Footnote 42: March 5, 1399, the Pell Rolls record
                   the payment of "10l. to Henry, son of the Duke of
                   Hereford, in part payment of 500l. yearly, which
                   our present lord the King has granted to be paid
                   him at the Exchequer during pleasure." Twenty
                   pounds also were paid to him on the 21st of the
                   preceding February.]

                   [Footnote 43: Whether as a measure of security, or
                   on a principle of kind considerateness for Henry of
                   Monmouth, when Richard left England he took with
                   him Henry Beaufort, (Pat. p. 3. 22 Ric. II, n.
                   11.): though it is curious to remark that when on
                   his return to England he left Henry of Monmouth in
                   Trym Castle, we find Henry Beaufort in the company
                   of Richard.]

About midsummer the king advanced towards the country and strong-holds of Macmore, his most
formidable antagonist. On the opening of that campaign he conferred upon young Henry the order
of knighthood;[44] and wishing to signalize this mark of the royal favour with unusual celebrity,
he conferred on that day the same distinction (expressly in honour of Henry) upon ten others
his companions in arms. The    (p. 039) particulars of this transaction, and the details of
the entire campaign against the Wild Irish, as they were called, are recorded in a metrical
history by a Frenchman named Creton, who was an eye-witness of the whole affair. This gentleman
had accepted the invitation of a countryman of his own, a knight, to accompany him to England.
On their arrival in London they found the king himself in the very act of starting for Ireland,
and thither they went in his company as amateurs.

                   [Footnote 44: In 1379, his grandfather John of
                   Gaunt required aid of his tenants towards making
                   his eldest son, Henry of Bolinbroke, a knight.]

This writer thus describes[45] the courteous act and pledge of friendship bestowed by Richard
on his youthful companion and prisoner, recording, with some interesting circumstances, the
very words of knightly and royal admonition with which the distinguished honour was conferred.
"Early on a summer's morning, the vigil of St. John, the King marched directly to Macmore[46],
who would neither submit,    (p. 040) nor obey him in any way, but affirmed that he was himself
the rightful king of Ireland, and that he would never cease from war and the defence of his
country till death. Then the King prepared to go into the depths of the deserts in search of
him. For his abode is in the woods, where he is accustomed to dwell at all seasons; and he
had with him, according to report, 3000 hardy men. Wilder people I never saw; they did not
appear to be much dismayed at the English. The whole host were assembled at the entrance of
the deep woods; and every one put himself right well in his array: for it was thought for the
time that we should have battle; but I know that the Irish did not show themselves on this
occasion. Orders were then given by the King that every thing around should be set fire to.
Many a village and house were then consumed. While this was going on, the King, who bears leopards
in his arms, caused a space to be cleared on all sides, and pennon and standards to be quickly
hoisted. Afterwards, out of true and entire affection, he sent for the son of the Duke of Lancaster,
a fair young and handsome bachelor,[47] and knighted him, saying, 'My fair cousin, henceforth
be gallant and bold, for, unless you conquer, you will have little name for valour.' And for
his greater honour and satisfaction, to the end that it might be better imprinted on his memory,
he made eight or ten other knights; but indeed I do not    (p. 041) know what their names were,
for I took little heed about the matter, seeing that melancholy, uneasiness and care had formed,
and altogether chosen my heart for their abode, and anxiety had dispossessed me of joy."

                   [Footnote 45: M. Creton's Metrical History is

                   of danger, more than once: and probably he was in
                   higher esteem in the hall among the guests for his
                   minstrelsy and song, than in the battle-field for

                   knighted.]

The English suffered much from hunger and fatigue during this expedition in search of the archrebel,
and after many fruitless attempts to reduce him, reached Dublin, where all their sufferings
were forgotten in the plenty and pleasures of that "good city."

       *       *       *       *       *

The day on which Richard conferred upon Henry so distinguished a mark of his regard and friendship,
offering the first occasion on which any reference is made to his personal appearance and bodily
constitution, the present may, perhaps, be deemed an appropriate place for recording what we
may have been able to glean in that department of biographical memoir with which few, probably,
are inclined to dispense.

M. Creton, in his account of this memorable knighthood, represents Henry as "a handsome young
bachelor," then in his twelfth year; and very little further, of a specific character, is recorded
by his immediate contemporaries. The chroniclers next in succession describe him as a man of
"a spare make, tall, and well-proportioned," "exceeding," says Stow, "the ordinary stature
of men;" beautiful   (p. 042) of visage, his bones small: nevertheless he was of marvellous
strength, pliant and passing swift of limb; and so trained was he to feats of agility by discipline
and exercise, that with one or two of his lords he could, on foot, readily give chase to a
deer without hounds, bow, or sling, and catch the fleetest of the herd. By the period of his
early youth he must have outgrown the weakness and sickliness of his childhood, or he could
never have endured the fatigues of body and mind to which he was exposed through his almost
incessant campaigns from his fourteenth to his twentieth year. These hardships, nevertheless,
may have been all the while sowing the seeds of that fatal disease which at the last carried
him so prematurely from the labours, and vexations, and honours of this world.[48]

                   [Footnote 48: Fuller, in his Church History, thus
                   speaks of him, mingling with his description,
                   however, the verification of the proverb, "An ill
                   youth may make a good man," a maxim far less true
                   (though far more popular) than one of at least
                   equally remote origin, "Like sapling, like oak." He
                   was "one of a strong and active body, neither
                   shrinking in cold nor slothful in heat, going
                   commonly with his head uncovered; the wearing of
                   armour was no more cumbersome to him than a cloak.
                   He never shrunk at a wound, nor turned away his
                   nose for ill savour, nor closed his eyes for smoke
                   or dust; in diet, none less dainty or more
                   moderate; his sleep very short, but sound;
                   fortunate in fight, and commendable in all his
                   actions."]

With regard to his habits of social intercourse, his powers of conversation, the disposition
and bent of his mind when he mingled (p. 043) with others, whether in the seasons of public
business, or the more private hours of retirement and relaxation, (whilst the never-ending
tales of his dissipation among his unthrifty reckless playmates are reserved for a separate
inquiry,) a few words only will suffice in this place. In addition to the testimony of later
authors, the records of contemporaneous antiquity, sometimes by direct allusion to him, sometimes
incidentally and as it were undesignedly, lead us to infer that he was a distinguished example
of affability and courteousness; still not usually a man of many words; clear in his own conception
of the subject of conversation or debate, and ready in conveying it to others, yet peculiarly
modest and unassuming in maintaining his opinion, listening with so natural an ease and deference,
and kindness to the sentiments and remarks and arguments of others, as to draw into a close
and warm personal attachment to himself those who had the happiness to be on terms of familiarity
with him. Certainly the unanimous voice of Parliament ascribed to him, when engaged in the
deeper and graver discussions involving the interests and welfare of the state, qualities corresponding
in every particular with these representations of individual chroniclers. The glowing, living
language of Shakspeare seems only to have recommended by becoming and graceful ornament, what
had its existence really and substantially in truth.

Soon after Richard reached Dublin, the Duke of Albemarle, Constable of England, arrived with
a large fleet, and with forces all ready for a campaign: but he came too late for any good
purpose, and better had it been for Richard had he never come at all. His advice was the king's
ruin. Richard with his army passed full six weeks in Dublin, in the free enjoyment of ease
and pleasure, altogether ignorant of the terrible reverse which awaited him. In consequence
of the uninterrupted prevalence of adverse winds, his self-indulgence was undisturbed by the
news which the first change of weather was destined to bring. Through the whole of this momentous
crisis the weather was so boisterous that no vessel dared to brave the tempest. On the return
of a quiet sea, a barge arrived at Dublin upon a Saturday, laden with the appalling tidings
that Henry, Duke of Lancaster, had returned from exile and was carrying all before him; supported
by Richard's      (p. 045) most powerful subjects, now in open rebellion against his authority;
and encouraged by the Archbishop, who in the Pope's name preached plenary absolution and a
place in paradise to all who would assist the duke to recover his just rights from his unjust
sovereign. The King grew pale at this news, and instantly resolved to return to England on
the Monday following. But the Duke of Albemarle advised that unhappy monarch, fatally for his
interests, to remain in Ireland till his whole navy could be gathered; and in the mean time[49]
to send over the Earl of Salisbury. That nobleman departed forthwith, (Richard solemnly promising
to put to sea in six days,) and landed at Conway, "the strongest and fairest town in Wales."

                   [Footnote 49: M. Creton, the author of the Metrical
                   History, acceded to the earnest request of the Earl
                   of Salisbury to accompany him, for the sake of his
                   minstrelsy and song. From the day of his departure
                   from Dublin his knowledge of public affairs, as far
                   as they are immediately connected with Henry of
                   Monmouth, ceases almost, if not altogether. He must
                   no longer be followed implicitly; whatever he
                   relates of the intervening circumstances till
                   Richard himself came to Conway, he must have
                   derived from hearsay. In one circumstance too
                   afterwards he must have been mistaken, when he says
                   the Duke of Lancaster committed Richard at Chester
                   to the safe keeping of the son of the Duke of
                   Gloucester and the son of the Earl of Arundel, at
                   least if Humfrey be the young man he means. Stow
                   and others follow him here, but, as it should seem,
                   unadvisedly.]

Either before the Earl of Salisbury's departure, or as is the more probable, towards the last
of those eighteen days through which    (p. 046) afterwards, to the ruin of his cause, Richard
wasted his time (the only time left him) in Ireland, he sent for Henry of Monmouth, and upbraided
him with his father's treason. Otterbourne minutely records the conversation which is said
then to have passed between them. "Henry, my child," said the King, "see what your father has
done to me. He has actually invaded my land as an enemy, and, as if in regular warfare, has
taken captive and put to death my liege subjects without mercy and pity. Indeed, child, for
you individually I am very sorry, because for this unhappy proceeding of your father you must
perhaps be deprived of your inheritance." 'To whom Henry, though a boy, replied in no boyish
manner,' "In truth, my gracious king and lord, I am sincerely grieved by these tidings; and,
as I conceive, you are fully assured of my innocence in this proceeding of my father."--"I
know," replied the King, "that the crime which your father has perpetrated does not attach
at all to you; and therefore I hold you excused of it altogether."

Soon after this interview the unfortunate Richard set off from Dublin to return to his kingdom,
which was now passing rapidly into other hands: but his two youthful captives, Henry of Monmouth,
and Humfrey, son of the late Duke of Gloucester, he caused to be shut up in the safe keeping
of the castle of Trym.[50] From that day, which must have been somewhere about the 20th of
August, till the following        (p. 047) October,[51] when he was created Prince of Wales
in a full assembly of the nobles and commons of England, we have no direct mention made of
Henry of Monmouth. That much of the intervening time was a season of doubt and anxiety and
distress to him, we have every reason to believe. Though he had been previously detained as
a hostage, yet he had been treated with great kindness; and Richard, probably inspiring him
with feelings of confidence and attachment towards himself, had led him to forget his father's
enemy and oppressor in his own personal benefactor and friend. Richard had now left him and
his cousin (a youth doubly related to him) as prisoners in a solitary castle far from their
friends, and in the custody of men at whose hands they could not anticipate what treatment
they might receive. How long they remained in this state of close and, as they might well deem
it, perilous confinement, we do not learn. Probably the Duke of Lancaster, on hearing of Richard's
departure from Dublin, sent off immediately to release the two captive youths; or at the latest,
as soon as he had the unhappy king within his power. On the one hand it may be       (p. 048)
argued that had Henry of Monmouth joined his father before the cavalcade reached London, so
remarkable a circumstance would have been noticed by the French author, who accompanied them
the whole way. On the other hand we learn from the Pell Rolls that a ship was sent from Chester
to conduct him to London, though the payment of a debt does not fix the date at which it was
incurred.[52] We may be assured no time was lost by the Duke, by those whom he employed, or
by his son; at all events that Henry was restored to his father at Chester (a circumstance
which would be implied had Richard there been consigned to the custody of young Humphrey),
is not at all in evidence. The far more reasonable inference from what is recorded is, that
Humphrey, his young fellow-prisoner and companion, and near relative and friend, was snatched
from him by sudden death at the very time when Providence seemed to have opened to him a joyous
return to liberty and to his widowed mother. There is no reason to doubt that the news of Richard's
captivity, and the Duke of Lancaster's success, reached the two friends whilst prisoners in
Trym Castle; nor that they were both released, and embarked together for England. Where they
were when  (p. 049) the hand of death separated them is not certainly known. The general tradition
is, that poor Humphrey had no sooner left the Irish coast than he was seized by a fever, or
by the plague, which carried him off before the ship could reach England. But whether he landed
or not, whether he had joined the Duke or not before the fatal malady attacked him, there is
no doubt that his death followed hard upon his release. His mother, the widowed duchess of
his murdered father, who had moreover never been allowed the solace of her child's company,
now bereft of husband and son, could bear up against her affliction no longer. On hearing of
her desolate state, excessive grief overwhelmed her; and she fell sick and died.[53]

                   [Footnote 50: The castle of Trym, though described
                   by Walsingham as a strong fort, was in so
                   dilapidated a state, that, in 1402, the council, in
                   taking the King's pleasure about its repairs,
                   represent it as on the point of falling into
                   ruins.]

                   [Footnote 51: M. Creton expressly states that Henry
                   IV. made Henry of Monmouth Prince of Wales on the
                   day of his election to the throne, the first
                   Wednesday in October; but in this he is not borne
                   out by authority.]

                   [Footnote 52: 1401, March 5, "To Henry Dryhurst of
                   West Chester, payment for the freightage of a ship
                   to Dublin: also for sailing to the same place and
                   back again, to conduct the lord the Prince, the
                   King's son, from Ireland to England; together with
                   the furniture of a chapel and ornaments of the
                   same, which belonged to King Richard."]

                   [Footnote 53: Her death took place on the 3rd
                   October 1399, four days after the accession of
                   Henry IV. On the 6th of the preceding May the Pell
                   Rolls record payment of the residue of 155l.

                   Gloucester, for the maintenance of a master, twelve
                   chaplains, and eight clerks, appointed to perform
                   divine service in the College of Plecy.]

It is impossible to contemplate these two youthful relatives setting out from the prison doors
full of joy, and happy auguries, and mutual congratulations, in health and spirits, panting
for their dearest friends,--one going to a princedom, and a throne, and a brilliant career
of victories, the other to disease and death,--without being impressed with the wonderful acts
of an inscrutable Providence, with the ignorance and weakness of man, and with the resistless
will    (p. 050) of the merciful Ruler of man's destinies. Even had young Humphrey foreseen
his dissolution, then so nigh at hand, as the gates of Trym Castle opened for their release,
he might well have addressed his companion in words once used by the prince of Grecian philosophers
at the close of his defence before the court who condemned him. "And now we are going, I indeed
to death, you to life; to which of the two is the better fate assigned is known only to God!"[54]

                   [Footnote 54: Socrates, in his Defence before his
                   Judges.]

Since this page was first written, the Author has been led to examine the Pell Rolls;[55] and
he is induced to confess that, independently of the full confirmation afforded by those original
documents to numberless facts referred to in these Memoirs, many an interesting train of thought
is suggested by the inspection of them. The bare and dry entries of one single roll at the
period now under consideration, bring with them to his mind associations of a truly affecting,
serious, and solemn character. The very last roll of Richard II. by the merest details of expenditure
records the payment of sums made by that unhappy monarch to Bolinbroke, then in exile, expatriated
by his unjust and wanton decree; to Humphrey, the orphan son of the late  (p. 051) murdered
Duke of Gloucester; to Henry of Monmouth his cousin, both then in Richard's safe keeping; and
to Eleanor, the widowed mother of Humphrey, and maternal aunt of Henry. Can any event paint
in deeper and stronger colouring the vicissitudes and reverses of mortality, "the changes and
chances" of our life on earth? Before the scribe had filled the next half-year's roll, (now
lying with it side by side, and speaking like a monitor from the grave to high and low, rich
and poor, prince and peasant alike,)--of those five persons, Richard had lost both his crown
and his life; Bolinbroke had mounted the throne from which Richard had fallen; Henry of Monmouth
had been created Prince of Wales, and was hailed as heir apparent to that throne; his cousin
Humphrey, once the companion of his imprisonment, and the sharer of his anticipations of good
or ill, had been carried off from this world by death at the very time of his release; and
the broken-hearted Eleanor, (the root and the branch of her happiness now gone for ever,) unable
to bear up against her sorrows, had sunk under their weight into her grave![56]

                   [Footnote 55: May 2nd & 6th, 1399, payments are
                   recorded to both these boys of different sums to
                   purchase dresses, and coat-armour, &c. preparatory
                   to their voyage to Ireland in company with the
                   King.]

                   few days only before the news of her son's death
                   paralyzed her whole frame, they appear peculiarly
                   appropriate: "Observing and considering the
                   mischances and uncertainties of this changeable and
                   transitory world." The will bears date August 9,

CHAPTER III.

1398-1399.

Whether Henry of Monmouth met his father and the cavalcade at Chester, or joined them on their
road to London, or followed them thither; whether he witnessed on the way the humiliation and
melancholy of his friend, and the triumphant exaltation of his father, or not; every step taken
by either of those two chieftains through the eventful weeks which intervened between King
Richard making the youth a knight in the wilds of Ireland, and King Henry creating him Prince
of Wales in the face of the nation at Westminster, bears immediately upon his destinies. And
the whole complicated tissue of circumstances then in progress is so inseparably connected
with him both individually and as the future monarch of England, that a brief review of the
proceedings as well of the falling as of the rising antagonist seems           (p. 053) indispensable
in this place.

       *       *       *       *       *

Henry Bolinbroke (having now, by the death of John of Gaunt,[57] succeeded to the dukedom of
Lancaster,) found himself, during his exile, far from being the only victim of Richard's rash
despotism; nor the only one determined to try, if necessary, and when occasion should offer,
by strength of hand to recover their lost country, together with their property and their homes.
Indeed, others proved to have (p. 054) been far more forward in that bold measure than himself.
Whilst he was in Paris[58], he received by the hands of Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury,
an invitation to return, and set up his standard in their native land. Arundel,[59] himself
one of Richard's victims, had been banished two years before the Duke, by a sentence which
confiscated[60] all his property. He made his way, we are told, to Valenciennes in the disguise
of a pilgrim, and, proceeding to Paris, obtained an interview with Henry; whom he found at
first less sanguine perhaps, and less (p. 055) ready for so desperate an undertaking, than
he expected. The Duke for some time remained, apparently, absorbed in deep thought, as he leaned
on a window overlooking a garden; and at length replied that he would consult his friends.
Their advice, seconding the appeal of the Archbishop, prevailed upon Henry to prepare for the
hazardous enterprise; in which success might indeed be rewarded with the crown of England,
over and above the recovery of his own vast possessions, but in which defeat must lead inevitably
to ruin. He left Paris for Brittany; and sailing from one of its ports with three ships, having
in his company only fifteen lances or knights, he made for the English coast.[61] About the
4th of July he came to shore at the spot where of old time had (p. 056) stood the decayed town
of Ravenspur. Landing boldly though with such a handful of men, he was soon joined by the Percies,
and other powerful leaders; and so eagerly did the people flock to him as their deliverer from
a headstrong reckless despot, that in a short time he numbered as his followers sixty thousand
men, who had staked their property, their liberty, and their lives, on the same die. The most
probable account of his proceedings up to his return to Chester, immediately before the unfortunate
Richard fell into his hands, is the following, for which we are chiefly indebted to the translator
of the "Metrical History."[62]

                   [Footnote 57: Froissart relates, in a very lively
                   manner, how the English nobility amused themselves
                   in devising the probable schemes by which
                   Bolinbroke might dispose of himself during his
                   exile. "He is young, said they, and he has already
                   travelled enough, in Prussia, and to the Holy
                   Sepulchre, and St. Katharine: he will now take
                   other journeys to cheat the time. Go where he will,
                   he will be at home; he has friends in every
                   country."

                   The same author tells us that forty thousand
                   persons accompanied him on his exile, not with
                   music and song, but with sighs and tears and
                   lamentations; and that on Gaunt's death the people
                   of England "spoke much and loudly of Derby's
                   return,--especially the Londoners, who loved him a
                   hundred times more than they did the King. The
                   Earl, he says, heard of the death of his father,
                   even before the King of France, though Richard had
                   posted off the event to that monarch as joyful
                   tidings. He put himself and his household in deep
                   mourning, and caused the funeral obsequies to be
                   solemnized with much grandeur. The King, the Duke
                   of Orleans, and very many nobles and prelates were
                   present at the solemnity, for the Earl was much
                   beloved by them all, and they deeply sympathized
                   with his grief, for he was an agreeable knight,
                   well-bred, courteous, and gentle to every one."]

                   [Footnote 58: Froissart gives also a very animated
                   description of the manner in which Bolinbroke was
                   received by the King of France on his first
                   arrival, and by the Dukes of Orleans, Brittany,
                   Burgundy, and Bourbon. The meeting, he says, was
                   joyous on both sides, and they entered Paris in
                   brilliant array: but Henry was nevertheless very
                   melancholy, being separated from his family,--four
                   sons and two daughters.

                   The author translated by Laboureur, states that
                   Richard no sooner heard of the welcome which
                   Bolinbroke met with in France than he sent over a
                   messenger, praying that court not to countenance
                   his traitors. He adds, that as soon as Lancaster
                   was dead, Richard regarded his written engagements
                   with no greater scruple than he had before observed
                   his promises by word of mouth.]

                   sojourned, during his exile, at Utrecht (Trajecti).
                   Froissart is certainly mistaken in relating that
                   the Londoners sent the Archbishop in a boat down
                   the Thames with a message to Bolinbroke. It is very
                   probable that they sent a messenger to the
                   Archbishop, and through him communicated with their
                   favourite.]

                   very correct information of Bolinbroke's
                   proceedings up to the time of his embarking on the
                   French coast for England, but from that hour to

                   circumstances, relates that he left Paris under
                   colour of paying a visit to the Duke of Brittany;
                   that he went by the way of D'Estamps (one Guy de
                   Baigneux acting as his guide); that he stayed at
                   Blois eight days, where he received a most kind
                   answer in reply to his message to the Duke, who
                   gave him a cordial meeting at Nantes. The Duke
                   promised him a supply of vessels and men to protect
                   him in crossing the seas, and forwarded him with
                   all kind sympathy from one of his ports: "and,"
                   continues Froissart, "I have heard that it was
                   Vennes." It might have been, perhaps, during this
                   visit that Henry formed, or renewed, an
                   acquaintance with the Duchess, to whom, after the
                   Duke's death, in 1402, he made an offer of his
                   hand, and was accepted.]

                   [Footnote 62: See Archæologia, vol. xx. p. 61, note

The Duke of Lancaster's first measures, upon his landing, are not very accurately recorded
by historians, nor do the accounts impress us with an opinion that they had arisen out of any
digested plan of operation. But a comparison of the desultory information which is furnished
relative to them, with what may fairly be supposed to be most advisable on his part, will,
perhaps, show that they were the result of good calculation. The following is offered as the
outline of the scheme. To secure to Henry a chance of success, it was in the first instance
necessary, not only that the most powerful nobles remaining at home should join him, but that
means should be devised for detaining the King in Ireland. It would be expedient to try the
disposition of the people on the eastern coast, and that he should (p. 057) select a spot for
his descent, from which he could immediately put himself in communication with his friends:
Yorkshire afforded the greatest facility. The wind which took Albemarle over into Ireland must
have been advantageous to Lancaster; and the tempestuous weather which succeeded must have
been equally in his favour. He landed at Ravenspur, and marched to Doncaster, where the Percies
and others came down to him. Knaresborough and Pontefract were his own by inheritance. Having
thus gained a footing, he marched toward the south; and his opponents withdrew from before
him.[63] The council, consisting of the Regent, Scroop, Bussy, Green, and Bagot, could interpose
no obstacle, and were driven by fear to Bristol. The Duke of York made some show of resistance.
Perhaps the others intended to make for Milford, and thence to Ireland, or to await the King's
arrival. Henry advanced to Leicester and Kenilworth, both his own castles; and went through
Evesham to Gloucester and Berkeley. At Berkeley he came to an agreement with the Duke of York,
secured many of Richard's adherents, passed on to Bristol, took the castle, slew three out
of four of the unfortunate ministers, and gained possession of a place entirely disaffected
(p. 058) to the King. From Bristol he directed his course back to Gloucester, thence bearing
westward to Ross and Hereford. Here he was joined by the Bishop and Lord Mortimer;[64] and,
passing through Leominster and Ludlow, he moved onward,[65] increasing his forces as he advanced
towards Shrewsbury and Chester. In the mean time the plans of Albemarle (if we acknowledge
the reality of his alleged treason) were equally successful. At all events Richard's course
was most favourable for Henry. Had he gone from Dublin to Chester, he might have anticipated
his enemy, and infused a spirit into his loyal subjects. But he came southward whilst Henry
was going northward; and, about the time that Richard came on shore at Milford, Henry must
have been at Chester, surrounded by his friends, at the head of an immense force, master of
London, Bristol, and Chester, and of all the fortresses that had been his own, or had belonged
to Richard, within a triangle, the apex of which is to be found in Bristol, the base extending
from the mouth of the Humber to that of the Dee.

                   [Footnote 63: Sir James Mackintosh seems to have
                   been mistaken in supposing that Bolinbroke visited
                   London on his first march southward. "His march
                   from London against the few advisers of Richard,
                   who had forfeited the hope of mercy, was a
                   triumphant procession."]

                   [Footnote 64: Monk of Evesham.]

                   [Footnote 65: He had many castles of his own in
                   that part of the country, as Monmouth, Grosmont,
                   Skenfrith, White Castle, &c.]

       *       *       *       *       *

If in like manner we trace the steps of the misguided and infatuated Richard, treacherous at
once and betrayed, from the hour when the news of Bolinbroke's hostile and successful measures
reached him in     (p. 059) Dublin to the day when he fell powerless into the hands of his
enemy, we shall find much to reprehend; much to pity; little, perhaps nothing, which can excite
the faintest shadow of respect. When the Earl of Salisbury left Ireland, Richard solemnly promised
him that he would himself put to sea in six days; and the Earl, whose conduct is marked by
devoted zeal and fidelity in the cause of his unfortunate master, acted upon that pledge. But
whether misled by the treacherous suggestions of Albemarle, or following his own self-will
or imbecility of judgment, Richard allowed eighteen days to pass away before he embarked, every
hour of which was pregnant with most momentous consequences to himself and his throne. He landed
at length at Milford Haven, and then had with him thirty-two thousand men; but in one night
desertions reduced this body to six thousand. It is said that, on the morrow after his return,
looking from his window on the field where his forces were encamped overnight, he was panic-struck
by the smallness of the number that remained. After deliberation, he resolved on starting in
the night for Conway, disguised in the garb of a poor priest of the Friars-Minor, and taking
with him only thirteen or fourteen friends. He so planned his journey as to reach Conway at
break of day, where he found the Earl of Salisbury no less dejected than himself. That faithful
adherent had taken effectual means,    (p. 060) on his first arrival in Wales, to collect an
army of Cambrians and Cheshiremen in sufficient strength, had the King joined them with his
forces, to offer a formidable resistance to Bolinbroke. But, at the end of fourteen days, despairing
of the King's arrival, they had disbanded themselves, and were scattered over the country,
or returned to their own homes. On his clandestine departure also from Milford, the wreck of
his army, who till then had remained true, were entirely dispersed: and his great treasure
was plundered by the Welshmen, who are said to have been indignant at the treachery of those
who were left in charge of it. Among many others, Sir Thomas Percy himself escaped naked and
wounded to the Duke of Lancaster.

The page of history which records the proceedings of the two hostile parties, from the day
of Richard's reaching Conway to the hour of his falling into the hands of Henry, presents in
every line transactions stained with so much of falsehood and baseness, such revolting treachery
and deceit, such wilful deliberate perjury, that we would gladly pass it over unread, or throw
upon it the most cursory glance compatible with a bare knowledge of the facts. But whilst the
desperate wickedness of the human heart is made to stand out through these transactions in
most frightful colours, and whilst we shudder at the wanton prostitution of the most solemn
ordinances of the Gospel, there so painfully    (p. 061) exemplified, the same page suggests
to us topics of gratitude and of admonition,--gratitude that we live in an age when these shameless
violations of moral and religious bonds would not be tolerated; and admonition that the principles
of integrity and righteousness can alone exalt a people, or be consistent with sound policy.
The truth of history here stamps the king, the nobleman, the prelate, and the more humble instruments
of the deeds then done, with the indelible stain of dishonour and falsehood, and a reckless
violation of law human and divine.

The King, believing his case to be desperate, implored his friends to advise him what course
to adopt. At their suggestion he sent off the Dukes of Exeter and Surrey to remonstrate with
Bolinbroke, and to ascertain his real designs. Meanwhile he retired with his little party of
adherents, not more than sixteen in all, first to Beaumaris; then to Caernarvon, where he stayed
four or five days, living on the most scanty supply of the coarsest food, and having nothing
better to lie upon than a bed of straw. Though this was a very secure place for him to await
the issue of the present course of events, yet, unable to endure such privations any longer,
he returned to Conway. Henry, meanwhile, having reduced Holt Castle,[66] and possessed himself
(p. 062) of an immense treasure deposited there by Richard, was bent on securing the person
of that unhappy King. He consequently detained the two Dukes in Chester Castle; and then, at
the suggestion, it is said, of Arundel, sent off the Earl of Northumberland with an injunction
not to return till either by truce or force he should bring back the King with him. The Duke,
attended by one thousand archers and four hundred lances, advanced to Flint Castle, which forthwith
surrendered to him. From Flint he proceeded along a toilsome road over mountains and rocks
to Ruddlan, the gates of which were thrown open to him; when he promised the aged castellan
the enjoyment of his post there for life. Richard knew nothing of these proceedings, and wondered
at the absence of his two noble messengers, who had started for Chester eight days before.
Northumberland, meanwhile, having left his men concealed in ambush "under the rough and lofty
cliffs of a rock," proceeded with five or six only towards Conway. When he reached the arm[67]
of the sea which washes the walls of that fortress, he sent over a herald, who immediately
obtained permission for his approach. Northumberland, having reached the royal presence, proposed
that the King should proceed with Bolinbroke amicably to London, and there hold a parliament,
and suffer certain individuals named to be put on their trial.     (p. 063) "I will swear,"
continued he, "on the body of our Lord, consecrated by a priest's hand, that Duke Henry shall
faithfully observe all that I have said; for he solemnly pledged it to me on the sacrament
when we parted." Northumberland then withdrew from the royal presence, when Richard thus immediately
addressed his few counsellors: "Fair sirs, we will grant it to him, for I see no other way.
But I swear to you that, whatever assurance I may give him, he shall be surely put to a bitter
death; and, doubt it not, no parliament shall be held at Westminster. As soon as I have spoken
with Henry, I will summon the men of Wales, and make head against him; and, if he and his friends
be discomfited, they shall die: some of them I will flay alive." Richard had declared, before
he left Ireland, that if he could but once get Henry into his power, he "would put him to death
in such a manner as that it should be spoken of long enough, even in Turkey." Northumberland
was then called in; and Richard assured him that, if he would swear upon the Host, he would
himself keep the agreement. "Sire," said the Earl, "let the body of our Lord be consecrated.
I will swear that there is no deceit in this affair; and that the Duke will observe the whole
as you have heard me relate it here." Each of them heard mass with all outward devotion, and
the Earl took the oath. Never was a contract made more solemnly, nor with a more fixed purpose
on both sides    (p. 064) not to abide by its engagements: it is indeed a dark and painful
page of history. Upon this pledge of faith, mutually given, the King readily agreed to start,
sending the Earl on to prepare dinner at Ruddlan. No sooner had he reached the top of the rock
than he beheld the Earl and his men below; and, being now made aware of the treachery by which
he had fallen, he sank into despair, and had recourse only to unmanly lamentations. His company
did not amount to more than five-and-twenty, and retreat was impossible. His remonstrance with
the Earl as he charged him with perjury and treason availed nothing, and he was compelled to
proceed. They dined at Ruddlan, and in the afternoon advanced to Flint Castle.[68] Northumberland
lost no time in apprising the Duke of the success of his enterprise. The messenger arrived
at Chester by break of day; and the Duke set off with his army, consisting, it is said, of
not less than one hundred thousand men. After mass, Richard beheld the Duke's army approaching
along the sea-shore. "It was marvellously great, and showed such joy that the sound and noise
of their instruments, horns, buisines, and trumpets, were heard even as far as the castle."
The Duke sent forward the Archbishop, with two or three more, who approached the King with
profound reverence. In this interview, the first which the King    (p. 065) had with Arundel
since he banished him the realm and confiscated his property, they conversed long together,
and alone. Whether any allusion was then made to the necessity of the King abdicating the throne,
must remain matter of conjecture. The Archbishop (as the Earl of Salisbury reported) then comforted
the King in a very gentle manner, bidding him not to be alarmed, for no harm should happen
to his person.

                   [Footnote 66: Some think the castle then taken was
                   Beeston.]

                   [Footnote 67: Over this estuary is now thrown a
                   beautiful suspension-bridge, one of the ornaments
                   of North Wales.]

                   [Footnote 68: The author of the Metrical History
                   has certainly made a mistake here. He says, Duke
                   Henry started from Chester on Tuesday, August the
                   22nd; but in 1399 the 22nd day of August was on a
                   Friday.]

The Duke did not enter the castle till Richard had dined, for he was fasting. At the table
he protracted the repast as long as possible, dreading what would follow. Dinner ended, he
came down to meet the Duke, who, as soon as he perceived him, bowed very low. The King took
off his bonnet, and first addressed Bolinbroke. The French writer pledges himself to the words,
for, as he says, he heard them distinctly, and understood them well. "Fair cousin of Lancaster,
you be right welcome." Then Duke Henry replied, bowing very low to the ground, "My lord, I
am come sooner than you sent for me; the reason whereof I will tell you. The common report
of your people is, that you have for the space of twenty years and more governed them very
badly and very rigorously; and they are not well contented therewith: but, if it please our
Lord, I will help you to govern them better." King Richard answered, "Fair cousin, since it
pleaseth you, it pleaseth me well."

Upon this Henry, when the time of departure was come, knowing that (p. 066) Richard was particularly
fond of fine horses, is said to have called out with a stern and savage voice, "Bring out the
King's horses;" and then they brought him two little horses not worth forty francs: the King
mounted one, and the Earl of Salisbury the other. If this statement of the French author be
accurate, Henry compelled his king to endure a studied mortification, as uncalled for as it
was galling. Starting from Flint about two o'clock, they proceeded to Chester,[69] where the
Duke was received with much reverence, whilst the unhappy monarch was exposed to the insults
of the populace. He was immediately lodged in the castle with his few friends, and committed
to the safe keeping[70] of his enemies. In Chester they remained three days,[71] and then set
out on the direct road for London. Their route lay through         (p. 067) Nantwich, Newcastle-under-Line,
Stafford, Lichfield, Daventry, Dunstable, and St. Alban's. Nothing worthy of notice occurred
during the journey, excepting that at Lichfield the captive monarch endeavoured to escape at
night, letting himself down into a garden from the window of a tower in which they kept him.
He was however discovered, and from that time was watched most narrowly.

                   [Footnote 69: Great confusion and unnumbered deeds
                   of injustice and cruelty prevailed through the
                   kingdom between the landing of Bolinbroke and his
                   accession to the throne; some of these outrages
                   were, doubtless, of a political character, between
                   the partisans of Richard and the Duke, many others
                   the result of private revenge and rapine. To put a
                   stop to these enormities, Richard was advised
                   (perhaps the more meet expression would be
                   'compelled') to sign two proclamations, one dated
                   Chester, August 20; the other Lichfield, August 24.
                   In these he calls Bolinbroke his very dear
                   relative.]

                   [Footnote 70: The Metrical History says, Richard's
                   keepers were the son of the Duke of Gloucester, and
                   the son of the Earl of Arundel. The reasons for
                   doubting this have been already assigned. Humphrey
                   was probably at that time no longer numbered among
                   the living.]

                   [Footnote 71: The question naturally offers itself
                   here, Might not this delay have been occasioned by
                   Lancaster's desire not to start before Henry of
                   Monmouth had returned from Ireland, and joined
                   him?]

When they arrived within five or six miles of London, they were met by various companies of
the citizens, who carried Richard first to Westminster, and next day to the Tower. Henry did
not accompany him, but turned aside to enter the city by the chief gate. Proceeding along Cheapside
to St. Paul's amidst the shouts of the people, he advanced in full armour to the high altar;
and, having offered his devotions there, he turned to the tomb of his father and mother, at
the sight of which he was deeply affected. He lodged the first five or six days in the Bishop's
house; and, having passed another fortnight in the hospital of St. John without Smithfield,
he went to Hertford, where he stayed three weeks. From that place he returned to meet the parliament,
which was to assemble in Westminster Hall on Wednesday the first day of October.

CHAPTER IV.

1399-1400.

When the Parliament assembled in Westminster Hall on Wednesday, October 1st, a deed of resignation
of the crown, signed by the unhappy Richard, and witnessed by various noblemen, was publicly
read. Whether, whilst a prisoner in the Tower, his own reflections on the present desperate
state of his affairs had persuaded him to sever himself from the cares and dangers of a throne;
whether he was prevailed upon to take this view of his interests and his duty by the honest
and kind representations of his friends; or whether any degree of violence by threat and intimidation,
and alarming suggestions of future evils had been applied, it would be fruitless to inquire.
The instrument indeed itself is couched in terms expressive of most    (p. 069) voluntary and
unqualified self-abasement, containing, among others, such expressions as these: "I do entirely,
of my own accord, renounce and totally resign all kingly dignity and majesty; purely, voluntarily,
simply, and absolutely." On the other hand, if we believe Hardyng,[72] the Earl of Northumberland
asserted in his hearing, that Richard was forced to resign under fear of death. Probably from
his first interview with the Archbishop in Flint Castle, to the hour before he consented to
execute the deed, his mind had been gradually and incessantly worked upon by various agents,
and different means, short of actual violence, for the purpose of inducing him to make, ostensibly
at least, a voluntary resignation. He seems more than once to have received both from Arundel
and from Bolinbroke himself an assurance of personal safety; and he is said to have expressed
a hope that "his cousin would be a kind lord to him."

                   [Footnote 72: Hardyng's testimony must, on every
                   subject, be received with much caution. Confessedly
                   he was a sad example of a time-server; and was
                   skilled in giving facts a different colouring, just
                   as they would be the more welcome to those for
                   whose inspection he was writing. His version of the
                   same events, when presented to members of the house
                   of York, varies much from the original work, edited
                   when a Lancastrian was in the ascendant.]

The accounts which have reached us of the proceedings, from the hour when Richard entered the
Tower, to the day of his death, are by no means uniform and consistent. The discrepancies however
of the     (p. 070) various traditions neither involve any questions of great moment, nor deeply
affect the characters of those who were engaged in the transactions. Of one point indeed we
must make an exception, the cause and circumstances of Richard's death; which, whether we look
to Henry of Monmouth's previous attachment to him, and the respect which he industriously and
cordially showed to the royal remains immediately upon his becoming king himself; or whether
we reflect on the vast consequence, affecting Bolinbroke's character, involved in the solution
of that much-agitated question, may seem not only to justify, but to call for, a distinct examination
in these pages. The broad facts, meanwhile, relative to the deposition of Richard and the accession
of Henry, are clear and indisputable; whilst some minor details, which have excited discussions
carried on in the spirit rather of angry contention than of the simple love of truth, and which
do not bear immediately upon the objects of this work, may well be omitted altogether.

After Richard had signed the deed of resignation, the steps were few and easy which brought
Henry of Bolinbroke to the throne. The Parliament, either by acquiescence in his demand of
the crown, or in answer to the questions put by the Archbishop, elected Henry IV. to be king,
and denounced all as traitors who should gainsay his election or dispute his right.[73] He
was crowned on the Feast of St.       (p. 071) Edward, Monday, October 13, when his eldest
son, Henry of Monmouth, bore the principal sword of state; who, on the Wednesday following,
by assent of all the Estates of Parliament, was created Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall,
and Earl of Chester, and declared also to be heir to the throne.[74] On this occasion his father
caused him to be brought into his presence as he sate upon the throne; and placing a gold coronet,
adorned with pearls, on his head, and a ring on his finger, and delivering into his hand a
golden rod, kissed him and blessed him. Upon which the Duke of York conducted him to the place
assigned to him in right of his principality. The Estates swore "the same faith, loyalty, aid,
assistance, and fealty" to the Prince, as they had sworn to his father. Much interest seems
to have been excited by this creation of Henry of Monmouth as Prince of Wales. On the 3rd of
November the "Commons pray that they may be entered on the record  (p. 072) at the election
of the Prince." Their petition can scarcely be interpreted as betraying a jealousy of the King's[75]
right to create a Prince of Wales independently of themselves; we must suppose it to have originated
in a desire to be recorded as parties to an act so popular and national. At all events, in
the then transition-state of the royal authority, it was wise to combine the suffrages of all:
and the prayer of the Commons was granted. Another petition, presented on the same day, acquaints
us with the lively interest taken from the very first by the nation at large in the safety
and welfare of their young Prince. They pray the King, "for-as-much as the Prince is of tender
age, that he may not pass forth from this realm: for we, the Commons, are informed that the
Scots are coming with a mighty hand; and they of Ireland are purposed to elect a king among
them, and disdain to hold of you." This lively interest evinced thus early, and in so remarkable
a manner, by the Commons, in the safety and well-being of Henry of Monmouth, seems never to
have slackened at any single period of his life, but to have grown still warmer and wider to
the very close of his career on earth. After the date of his creation as Prince of Wales, history
records but few facts relating to him, either in his private or in his public capacity, till
we find him  (p. 073) personally engaged in suppressing the Welsh rebellion; a point of time,
however, far less removed from the commencement of his princedom than seems to have been generally
assumed. In the same month, (November 1399,) a negociation was set on foot, with the view of
bringing about a marriage between the Prince and one of the daughters of the King of France.
Since, however, he apparently took no part whatever in the affair, the whole being a state-device
to avoid the restoration to France of Isabella's valuable paraphernalia; and since the proposals
of the treaty were for the marriage of a daughter of France with the Prince, OR any other of
the King's children; we need not dwell on a proceeding which reflects no great credit on his
father, or his father's counsellors.[76] Not that the vague offers of the negociation stamp
the negociators with any especial disgrace. We cannot read many pages of history without being
apprised, sometimes by painful instances, sometimes by circumstances rather ludicrous than
grave, that marriages were regarded as subjects of fair and honourable negociation; but requiring
no greater delicacy than nations would observe in bargaining for a line of territory, or individuals
in   (p. 074) the purchase and sale of an estate. The negociation, however, though the Bishop
of Durham and the Earl of Worcester, both able diplomatists, were employed on the part of England,
was eventually broken off; and Isabella was reluctantly and tardily restored to France.

                   [Footnote 73: M. Creton says (and in this he is
                   followed by others) that the King, on the very day
                   of his accession, created his eldest son Prince of
                   Wales, who in that character stood on the right
                   hand of the King at the coronation, holding in his
                   hand a sword without any point, the emblem of peace
                   and mercy. But in this he seems to have been
                   partially mistaken. Henry was not created Prince of
                   Wales till after his father's coronation, and he
                   bore in right of the Duchy of Lancaster, and by
                   command of the King, the blunted sword called
                   Curtana, which belonged to Edward the
                   Confessor.--Rot. Serv.]

                   creation of a dignity. The Lords and Commons were
                   consulted on this occasion only out of courtesy by
                   the King.]

                   [Footnote 76: The proposal, of which Froissart has
                   left a graphic description, that Isabella, the

                   child who was the espoused wife) of Richard II,
                   should remain in England and be married to the
                   Prince of Wales, was not made till after Richard's
                   death.]

About the close of the present year, or the commencement of the following (1400), the Prince
makes a direct appeal to the council,[77] that they would forthwith fulfil the expressed desire
of his royal father with reference to his princely state and condition in all points. He requires
them first of all to determine upon his place of residence, and the sources of his income;
and then to take especial care that the King's officers, each in his own department and post
of duty, should fully and perfectly put into execution whatever orders the council might give.
"You are requested (says the memorial) to consider how my lord the Prince is utterly destitute
of every kind of appointment relative to his household." The enumeration of his wants specified
in detail is somewhat curious: "that is to say, his chapels,[78] chambers, halls, wardrobe,
pantry, buttery, kitchen,  (p. 075) scullery, saucery, almonry, anointry, and generally all
things requisite for his establishment."

                   [Footnote 77: Minutes of Privy Council, vol. ii. p.
                   42.]

                   [Footnote 78: "Ses chapelles." Under this word were
                   included not only the place of prayer, but the
                   books, and vestments, and furniture, together with
                   the priests, and whatever else was necessary for
                   divine worship. Indeed, the word has often a still
                   wider signification. We shall see hereafter that
                   Henry was always attended by his chapel during his
                   campaigns in France.]

       *       *       *       *       *

It has been already intimated in the Preface, that an examination would be instituted in the
course of this work into the correspondence of Shakspeare's representations of Henry's character
and conduct with the real facts of history, and we will not here anticipate that inquiry. Only
it may be necessary to observe, as we pass on, that the period of his life when the poet first
describes him to be revelling in the deepest and foulest sinks of riot and profligacy, as nearly
as possible corresponds with the date of this petition to the council to supply him with a home.

It was in the very first week of the year 1400 that Henry IV. discovered the treasonable plot,
laid by the Lords Salisbury, Huntingdon, and others, to assassinate him during some solemn
justs intended to be held at Oxford, professedly in honour of his accession. The King was then
at Windsor; and, immediately on receiving information of the conspiracy, he returned secretly,
but with all speed, to London.[79] The defeat of these treasonable designs, and (p. 076) the
execution of the conspirators, are matter of general history; and, as the name of the Prince
does not occur even incidentally in any accounts of the transaction, we need not dwell upon
it. Probably he was then living with his father under the superintendence of Henry Beaufort,
now Bishop of Winchester, from whom indeed up to this time he seems to have been much less
separated than from his parent. We have already seen that, whether for the benefit of the "young
bachelor," or, with an eye to his own security, unwilling to leave so able an enemy behind,
King Richard, when he took the boy Henry with him to Ireland, caused his uncle and tutor (Henry
Beaufort) to accompany him also.[80] The probability also has been shown to approach demonstration
that his residence in Oxford could not have taken place at this time; but that it preceded
his father's banishment, rather than followed his accession to the throne. Be this as it may,
history (as far as it appears) makes no direct mention of the young Prince Henry through the
spring of 1400.

                   [Footnote 79: Some chroniclers say, that the
                   conspiracy was made known to the Mayor of London,
                   who forthwith hastened to the King at Windsor, and
                   urged him to save himself and his children. The
                   same pages tell us that John Holland Earl of
                   Huntingdon was seized and beheaded in Essex by the
                   Dowager Countess of Hereford.--Sloane MS.]

                   [Footnote 80: Pat. p. 3, 22 Ric. II.]

Soon, however, after the conspiracy against his father's life had been detected and frustrated,
an event took place, already alluded to, which must have filled the warm and affectionate heart
of Henry with feelings of sorrow and distress,--the premature death of Richard. That Henry
had formed a sincere attachment for Richard, and long cherished    (p. 077) his memory with
gratitude for personal kindness, is unquestionable; and doubtless it must have been a source
of anxiety and vexation to him that his father was accused in direct terms of having procured
the death of the deposed monarch. He probably was convinced that the charge was an ungrounded
calumny; yet, with his generous indignation roused by the charge of so foul a crime, he must
have mingled feelings of increased regret at the miserable termination of his friend's life.

The name of Henry of Monmouth has never been associated with Richard's except under circumstances
which reflect credit on his own character. The bitterest enemies of his house, who scrupled
not to charge Henry IV. with the wilful murder of his prisoner, have never sought to implicate
his son in the same guilt in the most remote degree, or even by the gentlest whisper of insinuation.
Whether Richard died in consequence of any foul act at the hand of an enemy, or by the fatal
workings of a harassed mind and broken heart, or by self-imposed abstinence from food, (for
to every one of these, as well as to other causes, has his death been severally attributed,)
is a question probably now beyond the reach of successful inquiry. The whole subject has been
examined by many able and, doubtless, unprejudiced persons; but their verdicts are far from
being in accordance with each other. The general (though, as it should now seem, the mistaken)
opinion appears to be, that after Richard had been removed from the Tower  (p. 078) to Leeds
Castle, and thence to other places of safe custody, and had finally been lodged in Pontefract,[81]
the partisans of Henry IV. hastened his death. The Archbishop of York directly charged the
King with the foul crime of murder, which he as positively and indignantly denied.[82] The
minutes of the Privy Council have not been sufficiently noticed by former writers on this event;
and the reflections of the Editor,[83] in his Preface, are so sensible and so immediately to
the point, that we may be contented in these pages to do little more than record his sentiments.[84]

                   [Footnote 84: Mr. Tytler, in his History of
                   Scotland, maintains with much ingenuity the
                   paradoxical position, that Richard escaped from
                   Pontefract, made his way in disguise to the Western
                   Isles, was there recognised, and was conducted to
                   the Regent; that, taken into the safe keeping of
                   the government, and sick of the world and its
                   disappointments, he lived for many years in
                   Stirling Castle; and that he there died, and there
                   was buried. It falls not within the province of
                   these Memoirs to examine the facts and reasonings
                   by which that writer supports his theory, or to
                   weigh the value of the objections which have been
                   alleged against it. The Author, however, in
                   confessing that the result of his own inquiries is
                   opposed to the hypothesis of Richard's escape, and
                   that he acquiesces in the general tradition that he
                   died in Pontefract, cannot refrain from making one
                   remark. Whilst he is persuaded that Glyndowr, and
                   many others, believed that Richard was alive in
                   Scotland, yet he thinks it almost capable of
                   demonstration that Henry IV, with his sons and his
                   court, in England; and Charles VI, with his court
                   and clergy, and Isabella herself, and her second
                   husband, had no doubt whatever as to Richard's
                   death. If they had, if they were not fully assured
                   that he was no longer among the living, it is
                   difficult to understand Henry IV.'s proposals to
                   Charles VI. for a marriage between Isabella and one
                   of his sons; or how, on any other hypothesis than
                   the conviction of his death, the Earl of Angouleme,
                   afterwards Duke of Orleans, would have sought her
                   in marriage; how her father and his clergy could
                   have consented to her nuptials; or how she could
                   for a moment have entertained the thought of
                   becoming a bride again. She had not only been
                   betrothed to Richard, but had been with all
                   solemnity married to him by the Archbishop of
                   Canterbury in the face of the church; and she had
                   been crowned queen. Yet she was married to
                   Angouleme in 1406, and died in childbed in 1409.
                   Had she believed Richard to be still alive, she
                   would have been more inclined to follow the bidding
                   which Shakspeare puts into her husband's mouth at
                   their last farewell, than to have given her hand
                   before the altar to another:

                                            "Hie thee to France,
                         And cloister thee in some religious house."

                   Froissart says expressly that the French resolved
                   to wage war with the English as long as they knew
                   Richard to be alive; but when certain news of his
                   death reached them, they were bent on the
                   restoration of Isabella.]

"Shortly after the attempt of the Earls of Kent, Salisbury, and    (p. 079) Huntingdon to restore
Richard to the throne, a great council was held for the consideration of many important matters.
The first point was 'that if Richard the late king be alive, as some suppose he is,    (p.
080) it be ordained that he be well and securely guarded for the salvation of the state of
the King and of his kingdom.' On which subject the council resolved, that it was necessary
to speak to the King, that, in case Richard the late king be still living, he be placed in
security agreeably to the law of the realm; but if he be dead, then that he be openly showed
to the people, that they may have knowledge thereof." These minutes (observes Sir Harris Nicolas)
appear to exonerate Henry[85] from the generally received charge of having sent Sir Piers Exton
to Pontefract for the purpose of murdering his prisoner. Had such been the fact, it is impossible
to believe that one of Henry's ministers would have gone through the farce of submitting the
above question to the council; or that the council would, with still greater absurdity, have
deliberated on the subject, and gravely expressed the opinion which they offered to the King.
A corpse, which was said to be that of Richard, was publicly exhibited at St. Paul's by Henry's
direction, and he has been accused of substituting the body of some other person; but these
minutes prove that the idea of such an exposure came from the council, and, at the moment when
it was suggested, they actually did not know whether Richard was dead or alive, because they
provided for either contingency. It is also    (p. 081) demonstrated by them that, so far from
any violence or ill-treatment being meditated in case he were living, the council merely recommended
that he should be placed in such security as might be approved by the peers of the realm.[86]
It must be observed that this new piece of evidence, coupled with the fact that a corpse said
to be the body of Richard was exhibited shortly after the meeting of the council, strongly
supports the belief that he died about the 14th of February 1400, and that Henry and his council
were innocent of having by unfair means produced or accelerated his decease."

                   [Footnote 85: It is painful to hear the Church
                   historian, without any qualifying expression of
                   doubt or hope, call Henry IV. "the murderer of
                   Richard."--Milner, cent. xv.]

                   [Footnote 86: Froissart expressly says, that,
                   though often urged to it, Henry would never consent
                   to have Richard put to death.]

Such we may hope to have been the case: at all events, the purpose of this work does not admit
of any fuller investigation of the points at issue. If Henry were accessory to Richard's death,
(to use an expression quoted as that unhappy king's own words,)[87] "it would be a reproach
to him for ever, so long as the world shall endure, or the deep ocean be able to cast up tide
or wave." It is, however, satisfactory to find in these authentic documents evidence which
seems to justify us in adopting no other alternative than to return for Bolinbroke a verdict
of "Not guilty." The corpse[88] of Richard was carried through the city of London to St. Paul's
with much of religious ceremony and solemn pomp, Henry himself as King bearing the pall,  (p.
082) "followed by all those of his blood in fair array." After it had been inspected by multitudes,
(Froissart[89] says by more than twenty thousand,) it was buried at Langley, where Richard
had built a Dominican convent. Henry V, soon after his accession, removed the corpse to Westminster
Abbey, and, laid it by the side of Ann, Richard's former queen, in the tomb which he had prepared
for her and himself.[90]

                   [Footnote 87: See Archæologia, xx. 290.]

                   [Footnote 88: M. Creton.]

                   [Footnote 89: Froissart asserts that the corpse was
                   exposed in the street of Cheap to public inspection
                   for two hours, at the least.]

                   [Footnote 90: A manuscript in the French King's
                   library (No. 8448) states that Sir Piers d'Exton
                   and seven other assassins entered the room to kill
                   him; but that Richard, pushing down the table,
                   darted into the midst of them, and, snatching a
                   battleaxe from one, laid four of them dead at his
                   feet, when Exton felled him with a blow at the back
                   of his head, and, as he was crying to God for
                   mercy, with another blow despatched him. This
                   account is supposed to be entirely disproved by the
                   fact that, when Richard's tomb was accidentally
                   laid open a few years ago in Westminster Abbey, the
                   head was carefully examined, and no marks of
                   violence whatever appeared on it. (See Archæologia,
                   vol. vi. p. 316, and vol. xx. p. 284.) On the other
                   hand, it is equally obvious to remark, that, if
                   Henry IV. did exhibit to the people the body of
                   another person for that of Richard, it was the
                   substituted body which was buried, first at Langley
                   and afterwards at Westminster. The absence,
                   consequently, of all marks of violence on that
                   body, till its identity with the corpse of Richard
                   is established, proves nothing. But surely there is
                   no reason to believe that any deception was
                   practised. There could have been no motive for such
                   fraud, and the strongest reasons must have existed
                   to dissuade Henry from adopting it. The only object
                   wished to be secured by the exposure of Richard's
                   corpse, (and it was exposed at all the chief places
                   between Pontefract and London,--at night after the
                   offices for the dead, in the morning after mass,)
                   was the removal of all doubt as to his being really
                   dead. The false rumours were, not that he was
                   murdered, but that he was alive. Among the
                   thousands who flocked to see him were doubtless
                   numbers of his friends and wellwishers, familiarly
                   acquainted with his features, many of whom, it is
                   thought, must have detected any imposture, and some
                   of whom would surely have been bold enough to
                   publish it. Still, on the other hand, it is
                   suggested that a very short lapse of time after
                   dissolution effects so material a change in a
                   corpse, that the most intimate of a man's friends
                   would often not be able to recognise a single
                   feature in his countenance. And certainly many of
                   Richard's friends remained unconvinced.]

Henry IV. had no sooner gained the throne of England, than he was made to feel that he could
retain possession of it only by unremitting watchfulness, and by a vigorous overthrow of each
successive       (p. 083) design of his enemies as it arose. In addition as well to the hostility
of France (whose monarch and people were grievously incensed by the deposition of Richard),
as to the restless warfare of the Scots, he was compelled to provide against the more secret
and more dangerous machinations of his own subjects.[91] After the discovery and defeat of
the plot laid by the malcontent lords in the beginning of January (1400), he first employed
himself in making preparations to repress the threatened aggressions of his northern neighbours.
His council (p. 084) had received news as early as the 9th of February of the intention of
the Scots to invade England; indeed, as far back as the preceding November, the petition of
the Commons informs us that they considered war with Scotland inevitable. On this campaign
Henry IV. resolved to enter in his own person, and he left London for the North in the June
following. Our later historians seem not to have entertained any doubts as to the accuracy
of some early chroniclers, when they state that Henry of Monmouth was sent on towards Scotland
as his father's representative, in command of the advanced guard, in the opening of the summer[92]
of 1400. Elmham states the general fact that Henry was sent on with the first troops, but in
the manuscript there is a "Quære" in the margin in the same hand-writing. And the querist seems
to have had sufficient reasons for expressing his doubts as to the accuracy of such a statement.
The renown of the Prince as a youthful warrior will easily account for any premature date assigned
to his earliest campaign; whilst the age of his father, who was seen at the head of the invading
army in Scotland, might perhaps have contributed to a mistake. The King himself, at that time
personally little known among his subjects, was not more than thirty-four years old.[93]  
(p. 085) Be this as it may, we have great reason to believe that Henry IV, when he proceeded
northward, left the Prince of Wales at home. In the first place, we must remember that, among
their primary and most solemn acts after the King's coronation, the Commons, anticipating the
certainty of this expedition into Scotland, preferred to him a petition, praying that the Prince
by reason of his tender age might not go thither, "nor elsewhere forth of the realm." The letter
too of Lord Grey of Ruthyn, to which we must hereafter refer, announcing the turbulent state
of Wales, and the necessity of suppressing its disorders with a stronger hand, can best be
explained on the supposition that the King was absent at the date of that letter,[94] about
Midsummer 1400, and that the Prince was at home. Lord Grey addresses his letter to the Prince,
and not to the King; though the King, as well as the Prince, had commissioned him to put down
the rising disturbances in his neighbourhood.[95] Some, perhaps, may think this intelligible
on the ground that Lord Grey wrote to Henry as Prince of Wales, and therefore more immediately
(p. 086) intrusted with the preservation of its peace. But his suggestion to the Prince to
take the advice of the King's council,--"with advice of our liege lord his council,"--is scarcely
consistent with the idea of the King himself being at hand to give the necessary directions
and a "more plainer commission."

                   extraordinary instrument of death laid in Henry's
                   bed by some secret plotter against his life. The
                   Sloane Manuscript describes it as a machine like
                   the engine called the Caltrappe; and the Monk of

                   same time tells us that such amusements were by no
                   means unexpensive in those days: "Sixteen pounds

Be this however as it may: whether Henry of Monmouth's noviciate in arms was passed on the
Scotch borders, (for in Ireland, as the companion of Richard, he had been merely a spectator,)
or whether, as the evidence seems to preponderate, we consider the chroniclers to have antedated
his first campaign, he was not allowed to remain long without being personally engaged in a
struggle of far greater magnitude in itself, and of vastly more importance to the whole realm
of England, than any one could possibly infer from the brief and cursory references made to
it by the historians who are the most generally consulted by our countrymen. The rebellion
of Owyn Glyndowr[96] is despatched by Hume in less than two octavo pages, though it once certainly
struck a      (p. 087) panic into the very heart of England, and through the whole of Henry
IV.'s reign, more or less, involved a considerable portion of the kingdom in great alarm; carrying
devastation far and wide through some of its fairest provinces; and at one period of the struggle,
by the succour of Henry's foreign and domestic enemies, with whom the Welsh made common cause,
threatening to wrest the sceptre itself from the hands of that monarch. The part which his
son Henry of Monmouth was destined to take personally in resisting the progress of this rebellion,
and the evidence which the indisputable facts recorded of that protracted contest bear to his
character, (facts, most of which are comparatively little known, and many of which are altogether
new in history,) seem to require at our hands a somewhat fuller investigation into the origin,
progress, and circumstances of this rebellion, than has hitherto been undertaken by our chroniclers.

                   [Footnote 96: The name of this extraordinary man is
                   very variously spelt. His Christian name is either
                   Owyain, or Owen, or Owyn. On his surname the
                   original documents, as well as subsequent writers,
                   ring many changes: the etymology of the name is
                   undoubtedly The Glen of the waters of the Dee, or,
                   Of the black waters. The name consequently is
                   sometimes spelt Glyndwffrduy, and Glyndwrdu. In
                   general, however, it assumes the form in English
                   documents of Glendor, or Glyndowr: in Henry of
                   Monmouth's first letter it is Oweyn de Glyndourdy.
                   In these Memoirs the form generally adhered to is
                   Owyn Glyndowr.

1400-1401.

Previously to the accession of Henry IV, Wales had enjoyed, for nearly seventy years, a season
of comparative security and rest. During the desperate struggles in the reign of Henry III,
in which its inhabitants, chiefly under their Prince Llewellin, fought so resolutely for their
freedom, many districts of the Principality, especially the border-lands, had been rendered
all but deserts. From this melancholy devastation they had scarcely recovered, when Queen Isabella,
wife of Edward II, headed the rebel army against her own husband, who had taken refuge in Glamorganshire;
and carried with her the most dreadful of all national scourges,--a sanguinary civil war. The
whole country of South Wales, we are told, was so miserably ravaged by these intestine horrors,
(p. 089) and the dearth consequent upon them was so excessive, that horses and dogs became
at last the ordinary food of the miserable survivors. From the accession of Edward III, and
throughout his long reign, Wales seems to have enjoyed undisturbed tranquillity and repose.
Its oppressors were improving their fortunes, rapidly and largely, in France, reaping a far
more abundant harvest in her rich domains than this impoverished land could have offered to
their expectations. Through the whole reign also of Richard II, we hear of no serious calamity
having befallen these ancient possessors of Britain. A friendly intercourse seems at that time
to have been formed between the Principality and the kingdom at large; and a devoted attachment
to the person of the King appears to have sprung up generally among the Welsh, and to have
grown into maturity. We may thus consider the natives of Wales to have enjoyed a longer period
of rest and peace than had fallen to their lot for centuries before, when the deposition of
Richard, who had taken refuge among their strongholds, and in defence of whom they would have
risked their property and their lives, prepared them to follow any chieftain who would head
his countrymen against the present dynasty, and direct them in their struggle to throw off
the English, or rather, perhaps, the Lancastrian yoke.

The French writer to whom we have so often referred, M. Creton,    (p. 090) in describing the
creation of Henry of Monmouth as Prince of Wales, employs these remarkable words: "Then arose
Duke Henry. His eldest son, who humbly knelt before him, he made Prince of Wales, and gave
him the land; but I think he must conquer it if he will have it: for in my opinion the Welsh
would on no account allow him to be their lord, for the sorrow, evil, and disgrace which the
English, together with his father, had brought upon King Richard." How correctly this foreigner
had formed an estimate of the feelings and principles of the Welsh, will best appear from that
portion of Henry's life on which we are now entering. His prediction was fully verified by
the event. Henry of Monmouth was compelled to conquer Wales for himself; and in a struggle,
too, which lasted through an entire third part of his eventful career.

       *       *       *       *       *

In accounting for the origin of the civil war in Wales, historians generally dwell on the injustice
and insults committed by Lord Grey of Ruthyn on Owyn Glyndowr, and the consequent determination
of that resolute chief to take vengeance for the wrongs by which he had been goaded. Probably
the far more correct view is to consider the Welsh at large as altogether ready for revolt,
and the conduct of Lord Grey as having only instigated Owyn to put himself at their head; at
all events to accept the office of leader, to which, as we are told, his countrymen[97] elected
him. The train was already laid in the      (p. 091) unshaken fidelity of the Welsh to their
deposed monarch, whom they believed to be still alive[98] and in the deadly hatred against
all who had assisted Henry of Lancaster in his act of usurpation; the spark was supplied by
the resentment of a personal injury. His countrymen were ripe for rebellion, and Owyn was equally
ready to direct their counsels, and to head them in the field of battle.

                   [Footnote 97: The proceedings of the Welsh, in
                   detail, at this time, are not found in any
                   contemporary documents, on the authenticity of
                   which we may rely. As to the general facts,
                   however, whether we draw them from the traditions
                   of the Welsh or the English chroniclers, no
                   reasonable doubt can be entertained. But the Author
                   cannot take upon himself the responsibility of
                   vouching for the truth of the biographical
                   particulars recorded of Owyn's early life and
                   adventures, or the measures which he adopted
                   previously to his breaking out into open revolt,
                   any more than he can undertake to establish by
                   proof the genealogy of that chieftain, and trace
                   him through Llewellin ap Jorwarth to Bleddyn ap
                   Cynfyn, or the third of the five royal tribes.]

                   [Footnote 98: It is curious, in point of history,
                   to observe for how very long a time rumours that
                   Richard was still alive were industriously spread,
                   and as greedily received. The royal proclamations
                   again and again denounced the authors of such false
                   rumours. In the rebellion of the Percies it was
                   asserted that Richard was still alive in the Castle
                   of Chester. In 1406 the Earl of Northumberland
                   (though he had charged Henry with the murder of
                   Richard), in his letter to the Duke of Orleans
                   states the alternative of his being still alive.
                   And even Sir John Oldcastle, in 1418, when before
                   the Parliament, protested that he never would
                   acknowledge that court so long as his liege lord,
                   Richard, was alive in Scotland.--See Archæologia,
                   vol. xx. p. 220.]

Owyn Glyndowr was no upstart adventurer. He was of an ancient      (p. 092) family, or rather,
we must say, of princely extraction, being descended from Llewellin ap Jorwarth Droyndon, Prince
of Wales. We have reason to conclude that he succeeded to large hereditary property. The exact
time of his birth is not known: most writers have placed it between 1349 and 1354; but it was
probably later by five years than the latter of those two dates.[99] This extraordinary man,
whose unwearied zeal and indomitable bravery, had they taken a different direction, would have
merited, humanly speaking, a better fate, was invested by the superstitions of the times with
a supernatural character. His vaunt to Hotspur is not so much the offspring of Shakspeare's
imagination, as an echo to the popular opinions generally entertained of him:[100]

                   [Footnote 99: Owyn and his brother Tudor were both
                   examined at Chester, September 3, 1386, during the
                   controversy between the families of Scrope and
                   Grosvenor as to the arms of the latter; and it
                   appears from their own evidence that Owyn was born
                   before Sept. 3, 1359, and that his brother Tudor
                   (who was slain in the battle of Grosmont, or Mynydd
                   Pwl Melin) was three years younger. The record of
                   this controversy assigns to Owyn himself this
                   honourable title "Oweyn Sire [Lord] de Glendore del
                   age XXVII ans et pluis."]

                   [Footnote 100: Strange wonders, says Walsingham,
                   happened, as men reported, at the birth of this
                   man; for, the same night he was born, all his
                   father's horses were found to stand in blood up to
                   their bellies. It is curious to find both the
                   Sloane MS. and the Monk of Evesham pointing to the
                   fulfilment of this prophetic prodigy during the
                   battle in which Edmund Mortimer was taken, when the
                   bodies of the slain lay between the horses feet
                   rolling in blood.]

  The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
  The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
  Were strangely clamorous in the frighted fields.
  These signs have marked me extraordinary,

                                 1 HENRY IV. iii. 1.

Whether Owyn had persuaded himself to believe the fabulous stories told of his birth; or whether
for purposes of policy he merely countenanced, in the midst of an ignorant and superstitious
people, what others had invented and spread; there is no doubt that even in his lifetime he
was supposed, not only within the borders of his father-land, but even through England itself,
to have intercourse with the spirits of the invisible world, and through their agency to possess,
among other vague and indefinite powers, a supernatural influence over the elements, and to
have the winds and storms at his bidding. Absurd as were the fables told concerning him, they
exercised great influence on his enemies as well as his friends; and few, perhaps, dreaded
the powers of his spell more than the King himself. Still, independently of any aid from superstition,
Glyndowr combined in his own person many qualities fitting him for the prominent station which
he acquired, and which he so long maintained among his countrymen; and as the enemy of Henry
IV. he was one of a very numerous and powerful body, formed from among the first persons of
the whole realm. He received his        (p. 094) education in London, and studied in one of
the Inns of Court. He became afterwards an esquire of the body to King Richard; and he was
one of the few faithful subjects who remained in his suite till he was taken prisoner in Flint
Castle. After his master's fall he was for a short time esquire to the Earl of Arundel, whose
castle, situated in the immediate neighbourhood of Glyndowrdy, was called Castel Dinas Bran.
Its ruins, with the hill on the crown of which it was built, still form a most striking object
near Llangollen, on the right of the magnificent road leading from Shrewsbury to Bangor.

A few months only had elapsed after the deposition of Richard when those occurrences took place
which are said to have driven Glyndowr into open revolt. He was residing on his estate, which
lay contiguous to the lands of Lord Grey of Ruthyn. That nobleman claimed and seized some part
of Owyn's property. Against this act of oppression Owyn petitioned the Parliament, which sate
early in 1400, praying for redress. The Bishop of St. Asaph is said to have cautioned the Parliament
not to treat the Welshman with neglect, lest his countrymen should espouse his cause and have
recourse to arms. This advice was disregarded, and Owyn's petition was dismissed in the most
uncourteous manner.[101]

                   [Footnote 101: Leland records the expressions of
                   contempt and insult with which the dismissal of
                   Owyn's petition was accompanied, and the advice of
                   the Bishop of St. Asaph scorned. "They said they
                   cared not for barefooted blackguards:"--"se de
                   scurris nudipedibus non curare." We cannot wonder
                   if their national pride was wounded by such
                   contumely.]

Another act of injustice and treachery on the part of Lord Grey    (p. 095) drove Owyn to take
the desperate step either of raising the standard of rebellion, or of joining his countrymen
who had already raised it. Lord Grey withheld the letter of summons for the Welsh chief to
attend the King in his expedition against Scotland, till it was too late for him to join the
rendezvous. Owyn excused himself on the shortness of the notice; but Lord Grey reported him
as disobedient. Aware that he had incurred the King's displeasure, and could expect no mercy,
since his deadly foe had possession of the royal ear, Owyn put himself boldly at the head of
his rebellious countrymen, who almost unanimously renounced their allegiance to the crown of
England, and subsequently acknowledged Owyn as their sovereign lord.

The Monk of Evesham, and the MS. Chronicle which used to be regarded as the compilation of
one of Henry V.'s chaplains, both preserved in the British Museum, speak of the Welsh as having
first risen in arms, and as having afterwards elected Owyn for their chief. It is, however,
remarkable that no mention is made of Owyn Glyndowr in the King's proclamations, or any public
document till the spring of 1401. Probably at first the proceedings, in which he took afterwards
so           (p. 096) pre-eminent a part, resembled riotous outrages, breaking forth in entire
defiance of the law, but conducted neither on any preconcerted plan, nor under the direction
of any one leader.

Lord Grey's ancestors had received Ruthyn with a view to the protection of the frontier; and
on the first indication of the rebellious spirit breaking out in acts of disorder and violence,
both the King and the Prince wrote separately to Lord Grey, reminding him of his duty to disperse
the rioters, and put down the insurgents. These mandates were despatched probably in the beginning
of June 1400, some days before the King departed for the borders of Scotland. Lord Grey, in
the letter[102] to which we have above referred, supposing that the    (p. 097) King had already
started on that expedition, returned an answer only to the Prince, acknowledging the receipt
of his and his father's commands; but pleading the impossibility of executing them with effect,
unless the Prince, with the advice of the King's council, would forward to him a commission
with more ample powers, authorizing him to lay hands on the insurgents in whatever part of
the country they might chance to be found; ordaining also that no lord's land should be respected
as a sanctuary to shield them from the law; and that all the King's officers should be enjoined
through the whole territory to aid and assist in quelling the insurrection.[103]

                   [Footnote 102: Sir Henry Ellis, to whom we are
                   deeply indebted for his succinct and clear
                   statement of the events of these times, appears, in
                   his introductory remarks on Lord Grey's letter, to
                   have overlooked the date of Henry IV.'s departure
                   for Scotland. He says: "Upon Henry's return, the
                   Welsh were rising in arms, and Lord Grey was
                   ordered to go against them. It seems to have been
                   at this point of time that the letter was penned.
                   It was apparently written in the month of June
                   1400." But the King did not leave London till
                   towards Midsummer, and we have a letter from him
                   (on his march northward) dated York, July 4, 1400,
                   commanding the mayor and authorities of London to
                   provide corn, wine, &c. for the King's use in
                   Scotland, and as much money as they could raise on
                   his jewels. The writ in consequence of this letter
                   was issued July 12. Walsingham, indeed, says that
                   they seized the opportunity of the King's absence,
                   and rose under their leader Owyn. The King, on his
                   return from Scotland, was at Newcastle upon Tyne on
                   the 3rd of September.]

                   [Footnote 103: At the back of this letter of Lord
                   Grey to Prince Henry we now find another, pasted,
                   sent by David ap Gruffyth to Lord Grey, probably
                   the very epistle which the Earl says he had
                   received "from the greatest thief in Wales;" the
                   few last sentences of which, apparently written in
                   a sort of jingling rhyme, indicate the character of
                   its author and the spirit of the times. "We hope we
                   shall do thee a privy thing: a rope, a ladder, and

                   there to helpyng, and we on our behalf shall be
                   well willing." The conclusion of another letter
                   from the same pen, in defiance of Lord Grey's
                   power, breathes the feelings with which the Welsh
                   entered upon this rebellion. "And it was told me
                   that ye been in perpose for to make your men burn

                   GRUFFUTH."]

This nobleman had evidently taken a very alarming view of the state of the country; and the
first documents which we inspect manifest     (p. 098) the uncurbed fury and deadly hatred
with which the Welsh rushed into this rebellion. Indeed, the general character of Owyn's campaigns
breathes more "of savage warfare than of chivalry." Lord Grey's letter is dated June 23, and
must have been written in the year 1400; for, long before the corresponding month in the following
year had come round, the Prince had himself been personally engaged in the district which the
Earl was more especially appointed to guard.

It does not appear what steps were taken in consequence of this communication of Lord Grey;
except that the King, on the 19th of September, issued his first proclamation against the rebels.
Probably on his return from Scotland, the King went himself immediately towards Wales; for
the Monk of Evesham states expressly that he came from Worcester to Evesham on the 19th of
October, and returned the next day for London. In the course, however, of a very few months
at the latest, a commission to suppress the rebellion, and restore peace in the northern counties
of the Principality, was entrusted to an individual whose character, and fortunes, and death,
deeply involved as they are in an eventful period of the history of our native land, could
not but   (p. 099) have recommended the part he then took in Wales to our especial notice under
any circumstances whatsoever; whilst his name excites in us feelings of tenfold greater interest
when it offers itself in conjunction with the name of Henry of Monmouth.

Henry Percy, eldest son of the Earl of Northumberland, known more familiarly as HOTSPUR,--a
name which historians and poets have preferred as characteristic of his decision, and zeal,
and the impetuosity of his disposition,--very shortly after Henry IV.'s accession had been
appointed not only Warden of the East Marches of Scotland and Governor of Berwick, but also
Chief Justice of North Wales and Chester, and Constable of the Castles of Chester, Flint, Conway,
and Caernarvon. In this latter capacity, with the utmost promptitude and decision, Hotspur
exerted himself to the very best of his power, at great personal labour and expense, to crush
the rebellion in its infancy.[104]

                   [Footnote 104: At as early a date as April 19,
                   1401, the Pell Rolls record the payment to him of
                   "200l. for continuing at his own cost the siege
                   of Conway Castle immediately after the rebels had
                   taken it, without the assistance of any one except
                   the people of the country."]

The letters of this renowned and ill-fated nobleman, the originals of which are preserved among
the records of the Privy Council, seem to have escaped the notice of our historians.[105] They
throw, however,    (p. 100) much light on the affairs of Wales and on Glyndowr's rebellion
at this early stage, and to the Biographer of Henry of Monmouth are truly valuable. The first
of these original papers, all of which are beautifully corroborative of Hotspur's character
as we have received it, both from the notices of the historian and the delineations of the
poet, is dated Denbigh, April 10, 1401. It is addressed to the King's council under feelings
of annoyance that they could have deemed it necessary to admonish him to exert himself in putting
down the insurgents, and restoring peace to the turbulent districts over which his commission
gave him authority. His character, he presumes, ought to have been a pledge to them of his
conduct. In this letter there is not a shade of anything but devoted loyalty.

                   [Footnote 105: The observations of Sir Harris
                   Nicolas, to whom we are indebted for the
                   publication of these letters, are very just: "Much
                   information respecting the state of affairs in
                   Wales is afforded by the correspondence of Sir
                   Henry Percy, the celebrated Hotspur; five letters
                   from whom are now for the first time brought to
                   light. Besides their historical value, these
                   letters derive great interest from being the only
                   relics of Hotspur which are known to be preserved,
                   from throwing some light on the cause of his
                   discontent and subsequent rebellion, and still more
                   from being in strict accordance with the supposed
                   haughty, captious, and uncompromising character of
                   that eminent soldier."--Preface, vol. i. p.
                   xxxviii.]

The reference which Hotspur makes in this first letter to "those of the council of his most
honoured and redoubted Prince being in these parts," is perhaps the very earliest intimation
we have of Henry   (p. 101) of Monmouth being himself personally engaged in suppressing the
rebellion in his principality, with the exception, at least, of the inference to be fairly
drawn from the acts of the Privy Council in the preceding month. The King at his house, "Coldharbour,"
(the same which he afterwards assigned to the Prince,) had assented to a proclamation against
the Welsh on the 13th of March; and on the 21st of March the council had agreed to seal an
instrument with the great seal, authorizing the Prince himself to discharge any constables
of the castles who should neglect their duty, and not execute their office in person. It is,
however, to the second letter of Hotspur, dated Caernarvon, May 3rd, 1401, that any one who
takes a lively interest in ascertaining the real character of Henry of Monmouth will find his
mind irresistibly drawn; he will meditate upon it again and again, and with increasing interest
as he becomes more familiar with the circumstances under which it was written; and comparing
it with the prejudices almost universally adopted without suspicion and without inquiry, will
contemplate it with mingled feelings of surprise and satisfaction. The name of Harry Hotspur,
when set side by side with the name of Harry of Monmouth, has been too long associated in the
minds of all who delight in English literature, with feelings of unkindness and jealous rivalry.
At the risk of anticipating what may hereafter be established more at large, we cannot introduce
this document to the reader without saying that we hail the preservation of this (p. 102) one,
among the very few letters of Percy now known to be in existence, with satisfaction and thankfulness.
It is as though history were destined of set purpose to correct the fascinating misrepresentations
of the poet, and to vindicate a character which has been too long misunderstood. In the fictions
of our dramatic poet Hotspur is the very first to bear to Bolinbroke testimony of the reckless,
dissolute habits of Henry of Monmouth.[106] Hotspur is the very first whom the truth of history
declares to have given direct and voluntary evidence to the military talents of this same Prince,
and the kindness of his heart,--to his prowess at once and his mercy; the combination of which
two noble qualities characterizes his whole life, and of which, blended in delightful harmony,
his campaigns in Wales supply this, by no means solitary, example. Hotspur informs the council
that North Wales, where he was holding his sessions, was obedient to the law in all points,
excepting the rebels in Conway, and in Rees Castle which was in the mountains. "And these,"
continues Percy, "will be well chastised, if it so please God, by the force and governance
which my redoubted lord the Prince has sent against them, as well of his council as of his
retinue, to besiege these rebels in the said castles; which siege, (p. 103) if it can be continued
till the said rebels be taken, will bring great ease and profit to the governance of the same
country in time to come." "Also," he proceeds, "the commons of the said country of North Wales,
that is, the counties of Caernarvon and Merioneth, who have been before me at present, have
humbly offered their thanks to my lord the Prince for the great exertions of his kindness and
goodwill in procuring their pardon at the hands of our sovereign lord the King."[107] The pardon
itself, dated Westminster, 10th of March 1401, bears testimony to these exertions of Prince
Henry in behalf of the rebels: "Of our especial grace, and at the prayer of our dearest first-born
son, Henry Prince of Wales, we have pardoned all treasons, rebellions, &c."[108] Henry of Monmouth,
when one of the first noblemen and most renowned warriors of the age bears this testimony to
his character for valour and for kind-heartedness, had not quite completed his fourteenth year.

                   [Footnote 107: The commons at the same time, of

                   Castle of Conway, and William with thirty-one more
                   received the royal pardon, dated 8th July 1401.
                   Pardons in the same terms had been granted on the
                   6th May to the rebels of Chirk; on the 10th, to
                   those of Bromfield and Oswestry; on the 16th, to
                   those of Ellesmere; and, upon June 15th, to the
                   rebels of Whityngton.]

This communication of Henry Percy, as remarkable as it is          (p. 104) interesting, appears
to fix to the year 1401 the date of the following, the very first letter known to exist from
Henry of Monmouth. It is dated Shrewsbury, May 15, and is addressed to the Lords of the Council,
whom he thanks for the kind attention paid by them to all his wants during his absence in Wales.
The epistle breathes the spirit of a gallant young warrior full of promptitude and intrepidity.[109]
It may be surmised, perhaps, that the letter was written by the Prince's secretary; and that
the sentiments and turn of thought here exhibited may, after all, be no fair test of his own
mind. But this is mere conjecture and assumption, requiring the testimony of facts to confirm
it: and, against it, we must observe, that there is a simplicity, a raciness and an individuality
of character pervading Henry's letters which seem to stamp them for his own. Especially do
they stand out in broad contrast, when put side by side with the equally characteristic despatches
of Hotspur.

     LETTER OF PRINCE HENRY TO THE COUNCIL.

     "Very dear and entirely well-beloved, we greet you much from our
     whole heart, thanking you very sincerely for the kind attention
     you have given to our wants during our absence; and we pray of
     you very earnestly the continuance of your good and friendly  (p. 105)
     services, as our trust is in you. As to news from these parts,
     if you wish to hear of what has taken place, we were lately
     informed that Owyn Glyndowr [Oweyn de Glyndourdy] had assembled
     his forces, and those of other rebels, his adherents, in great
     numbers, purposing to commit inroads; and, in case of any
     resistance to his plans on the part of the English, to come
     to battle with them: and so he boasted to his own people.
     Wherefore we took our men, and went to a place of the said Owyn,
     well built, which was his chief mansion, called Saghern, where we
     thought we should have found him, if he wished to fight, as he
     said. And, on our arrival there, we found no person. So we caused
     the whole place to be set on fire, and many other houses around
     it, belonging to his tenants. And then we went straight to his
     other place of Glyndourdy, to seek for him there. There we burnt
     a fine lodge in his park, and the whole country round. And we
     remained there all that night. And certain of our people sallied
     forth, and took a gentleman of high degree of that country, who
     was one of the said Owyn's chieftains. This person offered five
     hundred pounds for his ransom to save his life, and to pay that
     sum within two weeks. Nevertheless that was not accepted, and he
     was put to death; and several of his companions, who were taken
     the same day, met with the same fate. We then proceeded to the
     commote of Edirnyon in Merionethshire, and there laid waste a
     fine and populous country; thence we went to Powys, and, there
     being in Wales a want of provender for horses, we made our people
     carry oats with them, and we tarried there for ---- days.[110]
     And to give you fuller information of this expedition, and all
     other news from these parts at present, we send to you our
     well-beloved esquire, John de Waterton, to whom you will be
     pleased to give entire faith and credence in what he shall report
     to you on our part with respect to the above-mentioned        (p. 106)
     affair. And may our Lord have you always in his holy keeping.--Given
     under our signet, at Shrewsbury, the 15th day of May."

                   preserved in the British Museum.--Cotton, Cleop.
                   viii. fol. 117 b.]

                   [Footnote 110: The original is here imperfect.]

Two days only after the date of this epistle, Hotspur despatched another letter from Denbigh,
which seems to convey the first intimation of his dissatisfaction with the King's government;
a feeling which rapidly grew stronger, and led probably to the subsequent outbreaking of his
violence and rebellion. Hotspur presses upon the council the perilous state of the Welsh Marches,
at the same time declaring that he could not endure the expense and labour then imposed upon
him more than one month longer; within four days at furthest from the expiration of which time
he must absolutely resign his command.

In less than ten days after this despatch of Percy, the King's proclamation mentions Owyn Glyndowr
by name, as a rebel determined to invade and ravage England. The King, announcing his own intention
to proceed the next day towards Worcester to crush the rebellion himself, commands the sheriffs
of various counties to join him with their forces, wheresoever he might be. At this period
the rebels entered upon the campaign with surprising vigour. Many simultaneous assaults appear
to have been made against the English in different parts of the borders. On the 28th of May
a proclamation declares Glyndowr to be in the Marches of Caermarthen; and, only ten days before
(May 18th),  (p. 107) a commission was issued to attack the Welsh, who were besieging William
Beauchamp and his wife in the Castle of Abergavenny; whilst, at the same time, the people of
Salop were excused a subsidy, in consideration of the vast losses they had sustained by the
inroads of the Welsh.

1401.

When Owyn Glyndowr raised the standard of rebellion in his native land, and assuming to himself
the name and state and powers of an independent sovereign, under the title of "Prince of Wales,"
declared war against Henry of Bolinbroke and his son, he was fully impressed with the formidable
power of his antagonists, and with the fate that might await him should he fail in his attempt
to rescue Wales from the yoke of England. Embarked in a most perilous enterprise, a cause of
life or death, he vigorously entered on the task of securing every promising means of success.
His countrymen, whom he now called his subjects, soon flocked to his standard from all quarters.
Not only (p. 109) did those who were already in the Principality take up arms; but numbers
also who had left their homes, and were resident in distant parts of the kingdom, returned
forthwith as at the command of their prince and liege lord. The Welsh scholars,[111] who were
pursuing their studies in the University of Oxford, were summoned by Owyn, and the names of
some who obeyed the mandate are recorded. Owyn at the same time negociated for assistance from
France, with what success we shall see hereafter; and sent also his emissaries to Scotland
and "the distant isles." On those of his countrymen who espoused the cause of the King, and
refused to join his standard, he afterwards poured the full fury of his vengeance; and in the
uncurbed madness of his rage, forgetful of the future welfare of his native land, and of his
own interests should he be established as its prince, unmindful also of the respect which even
enemies pay to the sacred edifices of the common faith, he reduced to ashes not only the houses
of his opponents, but Episcopal palaces, monasteries, and cathedrals within the Principality.

                   [Footnote 111: See Ellis's Original Letters, second
                   series, vol. i. p. 8.]

Owyn Glyndowr was in a short time so well supported by an army, undisciplined no doubt, and
in all respects ill appointed, but yet devoted to him and their common cause, that he was emboldened
to try his strength with Lord Grey in the field. A battle, fought (as it  (p. 110) should seem)
in the very neighbourhood of Glyndowrdy,[112] terminated in favour of Owyn, who took the Earl
prisoner, and carried him into the fastnesses of Snowdon. The precise date of this conflict
is not known; probably it was at the opening of spring: the circumstances also of his capture
are very differently represented. It is generally asserted that a marriage with one of Owyn's
daughters was the condition of regaining his liberty proposed to the Earl; that the marriage
was solemnized; and that Owyn then, instead of keeping his word and releasing him, demanded
of him a most exorbitant ransom. It is, moreover, affirmed, that the Earl remained Glyndowr's
prisoner to the day of his death. Now, that Lord Grey fell into the Welsh chieftain's hands
as a prisoner, is beyond question; so it is that he paid a heavy ransom: but that he died in
confinement is certainly not true, for he accompanied Henry V. to France, and also served him
by sea. The report of his marriage with Owyn's daughter, might have originated in some confusion
of Lord Grey with Sir Edmund Mortimer; who unquestionably did take one of the Welsh chieftain's
daughters for his wife.[113] It is scarcely probable that both Owyn's prisoners should have
married his daughters; and still (p. 111) less probable that he should have exacted so large
a ransom from his son-in-law as to exhaust his means, and prevent him from acting as a baron
of the realm was then expected to act. Dugdale's Baronage gives the Earl two wives, without
naming the daughter of Glyndowr. Hardyng, in his Chronicle presented to Henry VI, thus describes
the affair:

  Soone after was the same Lord Gray in feelde
  Fightyng taken, and holden prisoner
  By Owayne, so that hym in prison helde
  Till his ransom was made, and fynaunce clear,
  Ten thousand marks, and fully payed were;
  For whiche he was so poor then all his life,
  That no power he had to war, nor stryfe.

                   [Footnote 112: Lingard places the site of Owyn's
                   victory over Lord Grey on the banks of the
                   "Vurnway."]

                   [Footnote 113: The Monk of Evesham reports that
                   Lord Grey was released about the year 1404, having
                   first paid to Owyn five thousand marks for his
                   ransom, and leaving his two sons as pledges for the
                   payment of five thousand more. The same authority
                   informs us that Edmund Mortimer espoused the
                   daughter of Owyn with great solemnity. The Pell
                   Rolls (1 Henry V. June 27) leave us in no doubt as
                   to the fact of that marriage.]

Another letter from Henry Percy to the council, dated June 4, 1401, is very interesting in
several points of view. It proves that the negociations "carried in and out," mentioned in
a letter written by the chamberlain of Caernarvon to the King's council, had been successful,
and that the Scots had sent aid to the Welsh chieftain: it proves also that Hotspur himself
was at this time (though bitterly dissatisfied) carrying on the war for the King in the very
heart of Wales, and amidst its mountain-recesses and strongholds; and that Owyn was at that
time assailed on all sides by the English forces, a    (p. 112) circumstance which might probably
have led to his "good intention to return to his allegiance," at the close of the present year.
Henry Percy declares to the council that he can support the expenses of the campaign no longer.
He informs them of an engagement in which, assisted by Sir Hugh Browe and the Earl of Arundel,
the only Lords Marchers who had joined him in the expedition, he had a few days before routed
the Welsh at Cader Idris. News, he adds, had just reached him of a victory gained by Lord Powis[114]
over Owyn; also that an English vessel had been retaken from the Scots, and a Scotch vessel
of war had been captured at Milford. Another letter, dated 3rd July, (probably the same year,
1401,) reiterates his complaints of non-payment of his forces, and of the government having
underrated his services; it expresses his hope also that, since he had written to the King
himself with a statement of his destitute condition, should any evil happen to castle, town,
or march, the blame would not be cast on him, whose means were so utterly crippled, but would
fall on the heads of those who refused the supplies. Henry IV. had certainly not neglected
this rebellion in Wales, though evidently the measures adopted against the insurgents were
not so vigorous at the commencement as the         (p. 113) urgency of the case required. His
exchequer was exhausted, and he had other business in hand to drain off the supplies as fast
as they could possibly be collected. He was, therefore, contented for the present to keep the
rebels in check, without attempting to crush them by pouring in an overwhelming force from
different points at once.

                   [Footnote 114: This nobleman, John Charlton, Lord
                   Powis, died on the 19th of October following, and
                   was succeeded by his son Edward, who, on the 5th of
                   August, (probably in 1402 or 1403,) applied to the
                   council for a reinforcement.--Min. of Coun.]

Towards the middle of this summer, the King marched in person to Worcester. He had directed
the sheriffs to forward their contingents thither; but, when he arrived at that city, he changed
his purpose and soon returned to London. Among the considerations which led to this change
in his plans, we may probably reckon the following. In the first place, he found his son the
Prince, Lord Powis, and Henry Percy, in vigorous operation against the rebels; his arrival
at Worcester having been only three or four days after the date of Percy's last letter. In
the next place, the council had urged him not to go in person against the rebels: besides,
almost all the inhabitants of North Wales had returned to their allegiance, and had been pardoned.
He was, moreover, naturally anxious to summon a parliament, with a view of replenishing his
exhausted treasury, and enabling himself to enter upon the campaign with means more calculated
to insure success.

In a letter to his council, dated Worcester, 8th June 1401, the King refers to two points of
advice suggested by them. "Inasmuch as     (p. 114) you have advised us," he says, "to write
to our much beloved son, the Prince, and to others, who may have in their possession any jewels
which ought to be delivered with our cousin the Queen, (Isabella,) know ye, that we will send
to our said son, that, if he has any of such jewels, he will send them with all possible speed
to you at our city of London, where, if God will, we intend to be in our own person before
the Queen's departure; and we will cause to be delivered to her there the rest of the said
jewels, which we and others our children have in our keeping." In answer to their advice that
he would not go in person against the rebels, because they were not in sufficient strength,
and of too little reputation to warrant that step, he said that he found they had risen in
great numbers, and called for his personal exertions. He forwarded to them at the same time
a copy of the letter which he had just received from Owyn himself. Not from this correspondence
only, but from other undisputed documents, and from the loud complaints of French writers,[115]
we are compelled to infer something extremely unsatisfactory in the conduct of Henry IV. with
regard to the valuable paraphernalia of Isabella, the maiden-widow of Richard. To avoid restoring
these treasures, which fell into his hands on the capture of that unfortunate monarch, Henry
proposed, in     (p. 115) November 1399, a marriage between one of his sons and one of the
daughters of the French monarch. In January 1400 a truce was signed between the two kingdoms,
and the same negociators (the Bishop of Durham and the Earl of Worcester) were directed to
treat with the French ambassadors on the terms of the restitution of Isabella; and so far did
they immediately proceed, that horses were ordered for her journey to Dover. But legal doubts
as to her dower (she not being twelve years of age) postponed her departure till the next year.
She had arrived at Boulogne certainly on the 1st of August 1401; and was afterwards delivered
up to her friends by the Earl of Worcester, with the solemn assurance of her spotless purity.

                   [Footnote 115: Many of our own historians have,
                   either in ignorance or design, very much misled
                   their readers on the subject.]

It is impossible to glance at this lady's brief and melancholy career without feelings of painful
interest:--espoused when yet a child to the reigning monarch of England; whilst yet a child,
crowned Queen of England; whilst yet a child, become a virgin-widow; when she was not yet seventeen
years old, married again to Charles, Earl of Angouleme; and three years afterwards, before
she reached the twentieth anniversary of her birthday, dying in childbed.[116]

                   [Footnote 116: It is not generally understood,
                   (indeed, some of our historians have not only been
                   ignorant of the fact, but have asserted the
                   contrary,) that this princess was the elder sister
                   of Katharine of Valois, married thirteen years
                   after Isabella's death to Henry of Monmouth.
                   Katharine was not born till after Isabella's
                   restoration from England to her father's home.
                   Isabella was born November 9, 1389; was solemnly
                   married by the Archbishop of Canterbury to Richard
                   II. in Calais, November 4, 1397 (not quite nine
                   years old); was crowned at Westminster on the 8th
                   of January following; was married to her second
                   husband, 29th June 1406; and died at Blois, 13th
                   September 1409.--Anselme, vol. i. p. 114.]

By the above letter of the King, which led to this digression,     (p. 116) we are informed
that the Prince was neither with his father, nor in London; for the King promised to write
to him to send the jewels to London. He was probably at that time on the borders of North Wales;
or engaged in reducing the Castles of Conway and Rhees, and in bringing that district into
subjection. Indeed, that the Prince was still personally exerting himself in suppressing the
Welsh towards the north of the Principality, seems to be put beyond all question by the records
of the Privy Council, which state that "certain members of the Prince's council brought with
them to the King's council the indenture between the said Prince and Henry Percy the son (Chief
Justice) on one part, and those who seized the Castle[117] of Conway on the other  (p. 117)
part, made at the time of the restitution of the same castle."[118]

                   [Footnote 117: One of these, Wm. ap Tudor, with
                   thirty-one others, was pardoned July 8. In his
                   petition he suggests that in all disputes between
                   the burgesses and themselves, there ought to be a
                   fair inquest, half Welsh and half English. This is
                   supposed to have been the usual law; but probably
                   in these turbulent times it might too often have
                   been dispensed with for a less impartial mode of
                   trial. Besides, among the many severe enactments
                   against the Welsh, the King, in 1400, had assented
                   to an ordinance proposed by the Commons, to remain
                   in force for three years, that no Englishman should
                   have judgment against him at the suit of a
                   Welshman, except at the hands of judges and a jury
                   entirely English.]

                   [Footnote 118: The castles in Wales were at this
                   time very scantily garrisoned; indeed, the
                   smallness of the number of the men by whom some of
                   them were defended is scarcely credible. And yet,
                   in the exhausted state of the treasury of the King,
                   of the Prince, of Henry Percy and others, those
                   castles, even in the miserably limited extent of
                   their establishments, could with difficulty be
                   retained. When besieged, the garrison could never
                   venture upon a sally. For example, Conway had only
                   fifteen men-at-arms and sixty archers, kept at an
                   expense of 714l. 15s. 10d. annually:
                   Caernarvon had twenty men-at-arms and eighty
                   archers: Harlech had ten men-at-arms and thirty
                   archers.--See Sir H. Ellis's Original Letters.]

Owyn appears to have left his own country, in which the spirit of rebellion had received a
considerable though temporary check; and to have been at this period exciting and heading the
rebels in South Wales, especially about Caermarthen and Gower.

Hotspur himself left Wales probably about the July or August of this year, 1401; for on the
1st of September he was appointed one of the commissioners to treat with the Scots for peace;
and he was present at the solemn espousals which were celebrated by proxy at Eltham, April
3, 1402, between Henry IV. and Joan of Navarre. We must, therefore, refer to a subsequent date
the information quoted by Sir Henry Ellis from an original paper in the British Museum, "that
Jankin Tyby of the north countri bringthe lettres owte of the northe country to       (p. 118)
Owein, as thei demed from Henr. son Percy." Soon after the departure of Percy, a proclamation,
dated 18th September 1401, notifies the rapid progress of disaffection and rebellion among
the Welsh: whether it was secretly encouraged by him at this early date, or not, is matter
only of conjecture. His growing discontent, visibly shown in his own letters, this vague rumour
that Jankin Tyby might be the confidential messenger for his treasonable purposes, and his
subsequent conduct, combine to render the suspicion by no means improbable. The proclamation
states that a great part of the inhabitants of Wales had gone over to Owyn, and commands all
ablebodied men to meet the King at Worcester on the 1st, or, at the furthest, the 2nd of October.
Perhaps this, like his former visit to Worcester, was little more than a demonstration of his
force.[119] Historians generally say that he made the first of his expeditions into Wales in
the July of the following year; the Minutes of Council prove at all events that he was there
in the present autumn, but how long or with what results does not appear. The council met (p.
119) in November 1401, to deliberate, among other subjects, upon the affairs of Wales, "from
which country (as the Minute expressly states) our sovereign lord the King hath but lately
returned,[120] having appointed the Earl of Worcester to be Lieutenant of South Wales, and
Captain of Cardigan."[121]

                   [Footnote 119: The Monk of Evesham states expressly
                   that, towards the end of this year, the King,
                   intending to hasten to Wales for the third time,
                   came to Evesham on Michaelmas-day, September 29,
                   but not with so large a force as before; and on the
                   third day, after breakfast, he proceeded to
                   Worcester, whence, after the ninth day, with the
                   advice of his council, he returned through Alcester
                   to London.]

                   [Footnote 120: On Monday, October 16, 1402, the
                   Commons "thank the King for his great labour in
                   body and mind, especially in his journey to
                   Scotland; and because, on his return, when he heard
                   at Northampton of the rebellion in Wales, he had at
                   that time, and three times since, with a great
                   army (as well the King as my lord the Prince)
                   laboured in divers parts." It throws great light on the state of Owyn's mind, and his
attachment to the Percies; on the confidence still reposed by the
King's government in Percy, and on the condition of Prince Henry
himself. The several chastisements which Owyn and his party had
received from the Prince, from Percy, from Lord Powis and others, had
perhaps at this time made him very doubtful of the issue of the struggle,
and inclined him to negociate for his own pardon, and the peace of the
country. The Minute of Council says, "To know the King's will      (p. 120)
about treating with Glyndowr to return to his allegiance, seeing his
good intention at present thereto". His readiness to treat is
accompanied, as we find in the same record, with a declaration that he
was not himself the cause of the destruction going on in his native
land, nor of the daily captures, and the murders there; and that he
would most gladly return to peace. As to his inheritance, he protests
that he had only received a part, and not his own full right. And even
now he would willingly come to the borders, and speak and treat with
any lords, provided the commons would not raise a rumour and clamour
that he was purposed to destroy "all who spoke the English language".
He seems to have been apprehensive, should he venture to approach the
marches to negociate a peace, that the violence and rage of the people
at large would endanger his personal safety. No wonder, for his
footsteps were to be traced everywhere by the blood of men, and the
ashes of their habitations and sacred edifices. At the same time, he
expressed his earnest desire to carry on the treaty of peace through
the Earl of Northumberland, for whom he professes to entertain great
regard and esteem, in preference to any other English nobleman.

Whether any steps were taken in consequence of this present opening for peace, or not, we are
not told. But we have reason to suppose that Wales was in comparative tranquillity through
the following        (p. 121) winter[122] and spring. The rebel chief, however, again very
shortly carried the sword and flame with increased horrors through his devoted native land.
We read of no battle or skirmish till the campaign of the next year.

                   [Footnote 122: The Pell Rolls contain many items of
                   payment about this time to the Prince of Wales; one
                   of which specifies the sum "of 400l. for one
                   hundred men-at-arms, each 12d. per day, and four
                   hundred archers at 6d. per day, for one month,
                   who were sent with despatch to Harlech Castle to
                   remove the besiegers." Probably they had been sent
                   some considerable time before the date of this
                   payment, Dec. 14, 1401.]

The questions relating to Prince Henry, which were submitted to this council, inform us incidentally
of the important fact, that though he was now intrusted with the command of the forces against
the Welsh, and was assisted in his office (just as was the King) by a council, yet it was deemed
right to appoint him an especial governor, or tutor (maistre). He was now in his fifteenth
year. These Minutes also make it evident that the soldiers employed in his service looked for
their pay to him, and not to the King's exchequer. We shall have frequent occasion to observe
the great personal inconveniences to which this practice subjected the Prince, and how injurious
it was to the service generally. But the evil was unavoidable; for at that time the royal exchequer
was quite drained.

"As to the article touching the governance of the Prince, as well (p. 122) for him to have
a tutor or guardian, as to provide money for the support of his vast expenses in the garrisons
of his castles in Wales, and the wages of his men-at-arms and archers, whom he keeps from day
to day for resisting the malice of the rebels of the King, it appears to the council, if it
please the King, that the Isle of Anglesey ought to be restored to the prince, and that Henry
Percy[123] should agree, and have compensation from the issues of the lands which belonged
to the Earl of March; and that all other possessions which ought to belong to the Prince should
be restored, and an amicable arrangement be made with those in whose hands they are. And as
for a governor for the Prince, may it please the King to choose one of these,--the Earl of
Worcester, Lord Lovel, Mr. Thomas Erpyngham, or the Lord Say; and, for the Prince's expenses,
that 1000l. be assigned from the rents of the Earl of March, which were due about last Michaelmas."
We have reason to believe that the Earl of Worcester, Thomas Percy, was appointed Henry of
Monmouth's tutor and preceptor. He remained in attendance upon him till, with the guilt of
aggravated treachery, he abruptly left his prince and pupil to join his nephew Hotspur before
the battle of Shrewsbury.

                   [Footnote 123: The whole of Anglesey was granted to
                   Hotspur for life. 1 Hen. IV, 12th October
                   1399.--MS. Donat. 4596.]

We are not informed how long Prince Henry remained at this period  (p. 123) in Wales, after
Percy had left it. Probably (as it has been already intimated) there was an armistice virtually,
though not by any formal agreement, through that winter and the spring of 1402. The next undoubted
information as to the Prince fixes him in London in the beginning of the following May, when
being in the Tower, in the presence of his father, and with his consent, he declares himself
willing to contract a marriage with Katharine, sister of Eric, King of Norway;[124] and on
the 26th of the same month, being then in his castle of Tutbury, in the diocese of Lincoln,
he confirms this contract, and authorises the notary public to affix his seal to the agreement.
The pages of authentic history remind us, that too many marriage-contracts in every rank of
life, and in every age of the world, have been the result, not of mutual affection between
the affianced bride and bridegroom, but of pecuniary and political considerations. Perhaps
when kings negociate and princes approve, their exalted station renders the transaction more
notorious, and the stipulated conditions may be more unreservedly confessed. But it may well
be doubted whether the same motives do not equally operate in every grade of life; whilst those
objects which should be primary and indispensable, are regarded as secondary     (p. 124) and
contingent. Happiness springing from mutual affection, may doubtless grow and ripen, despite
of such arrangements, in the families of the noble, the wealthy, the middle classes, and the
poor; but the chances are manifold more, that coldness, and dissatisfaction, and mutual carelessness
of each other's comforts will be the permanent result. We must however bear in mind, when estimating
the moral worth of an individual, that negociations of this kind in the palaces of kings imply
nothing of that cold-heartedness by which many are led into connexions from which their affections
revolt. The individual's character seems altogether protected from reprobation by the usage
of the world, and the necessity of the case. State-considerations impose on princes restraints,
compelling them to acquiesce in measures which excite in us other feelings than indignation
or contempt. We regret the circumstance, but we do not condemn the parties. Henry IV. of England,
and Eric of Norway, fancied they saw political advantages likely to arise from the nuptials
of Henry's son with Eric's sister; and the document we have just quoted tells us that the boy
Henry, then not fifteen, and still under tutors and governors, gave his consent to the proposed
alliance.

                   [Footnote 124: He was present in the Castle of
                   Berkhamsted on the 14th of May, at the sealing of
                   the marriage contract of his sister Philippa with
                   King Eric.--Foed. viii. 259, 260.]

The more rare however the occurrence, the more general is the admiration with which an union
in the palaces of monarchy is contemplated when mutual respect and attachment precede the marriage,
and conjugal love and (p. 125) domestic happiness attend it. And here we are irresistibly tempted
to contemplate with satisfaction and delight the unsuccessful issue of this negociation, whilst
Henry was yet a boy; and to anticipate what must be repeated in its place, that, to whatever
combination of circumstances, and course of events and state-considerations, the marriage of
Henry of Monmouth with Katharine of France may possibly be referred, he proved himself to have
formed for her a most sincere and heartfelt attachment before their union; and, whenever his
duty did not separate them, to have lived with her in the possession of great conjugal felicity.
Even the dry details of the Exchequer issues bear most gratifying, though curious, testimony
to their domestic habits, and their enjoyment of each other's society.

Whilst the King was thus negociating a marriage for his son, he was himself engaged by solemn
espousals to marry, as his second wife, Joan of Navarre, Duchess of Brittany. As well in the
most exalted, as in the most humble family in the realm, such an event as this can never take
place without involving consequences of deepest moment and most lively interest to all parties,--to
the husband, to his wife, and to their respective children. If he has been happy in his choice,
a man cannot provide a more substantial blessing for his offspring than by joining himself
by the most sacred of all ties to a woman who will (p. 126) cheerfully and lovingly perform
the part of a conscientious and affectionate mother towards them. If the choice is unhappy;
if there be a want of sound religious and moral principle, a neglect, or carelessness and impatience
in the discharge of domestic duties; if a discontented, suspicious, cold, and unkind spirit
accompany the new bride, domestic comfort must take flight, and all the proverbial evils of
such a state must be realized. The marriage of Henry of Monmouth's father with Joan of Navarre
does not enable us to view the bright side of this alternative. Of the new Queen we hear little
for many years;[125] but, at the end of those years of comparative silence, we find Henry V.
compelled to remove from his mother-in-law all her attendants, and to commit her to the custody
of Lord John Pelham in the castle of Pevensey.[126] She was charged with having entertained
malicious and treasonable designs against the life of the King, her son-in-law. The Chronicle
of London, (1419,) throwing[127] an air of mystery and superstition over the whole affair,
asserts that Queen Joanna excited her confessor, one friar Randolf,[128] a master in  (p. 127)
divinity, to destroy the King; "but, as God would, his falseness was at last espied:" "wherefore,"
as the Chronicle adds, "the Queen forfeited her lands."[129] Of this marriage of Henry IV.
with Joan of Navarre very little notice beyond the bare fact has been taken by our English
historians. Many particulars, however, are found in the histories of Brittany. It appears that
the Duchess, who was the widow of Philip de Mont Forte, Duke of Brittany, by whom she had sons
and daughters, was solemnly contracted to Henry by her proxy, Anthony Rys, at Eltham, on the
3rd of April 1402, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of Somerset, the
Earl of Northumberland and his son Hotspur, the Earl of Worcester, Thomas Langley, Keeper of
the Privy Seal, and others. Having appointed guardians for her son, the young Duke of Brittany,
she left Nantes on the 26th December, embarked on board one of the ships sent by Henry, at
Camaret, on the 13th   (p. 128) January, and sailed the next day, intending to land at Southampton.
After a stormy passage of five days, the squadron was forced into a port in Cornwall. She was
married on the 7th, and was crowned at Westminster on the 25th, of February following.[130]
By Henry she had no child.

                   information as to the family of this royal lady. In

                   Brittany, son of the Queen, to come to England, to
                   tarry and to return, with twenty men and
                   horses.--Rymer, May 20, 1412.]
