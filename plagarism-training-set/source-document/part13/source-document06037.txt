 De Spain covered a hardly perceptible black object on
     the trail.                                           Frontispiece

 Hugging his shield, de Spain threw his second shot over
     Sandusky's left shoulder.                                     135
 "Stand away from that girl!" repeated de Spain harshly,
     backing the words with a step forward.                        200
 "I've promised you I would. I will promise every time
     you ask me."                                                  417

NAN OF MUSIC MOUNTAIN

CHAPTER I

FRONTIER DAY

Lefever, if there was a table in the room, could never be got to sit on a chair; and being
rotund he sat preferably sidewise on the edge of the table. One of his small feet--his feet
were encased in tight, high-heeled, ill-fitting horsemen's boots--usually rested on the floor,
the other swung at the end of his stubby leg slowly in the air. This idiosyncrasy his companion,
de Spain, had learned to tolerate.

But Lefever's subdued whistle, which seemed meditative, always irritated de Spain more or less,
despite his endeavor not to be irritated. It was like the low singing of a tea-kettle, which,
however unobtrusive, indicates steam within. In fact, John Lefever, who was built not unlike
a kettle, and whose high, shiny forehead was topped by a pompadour shock of very yellow hair,
never whistled except when there was some pressure on his sensibilities.
