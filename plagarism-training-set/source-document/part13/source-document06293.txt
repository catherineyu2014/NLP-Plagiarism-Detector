    "It was called Gloucester Furnace in honour of the Duke of
    Gloucester, Queen Anne's son, who, in the year 1698, visited it
    from Tunbridge Wells. The iron rails round St. Paul's
    Churchyard, in London, were cast at this furnace. They compose
    the most magnificent balustrade, perhaps, in the universe, being
    of the height of five feet six inches, in which there are, at
    intervals, seven iron gates of beautiful workmanship, which,
    together with the rails, weigh two hundred tons and eighty-one
    pounds; the whole of which cost 6d. per pound, and with other
    charges, amounted to the sum of 11,202l. 0s. 6d."

NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES, ETC.

If there was any ground, and we are inclined to believe there was, for the objection urged
by the judicious few against that interesting series of illustrations of English history, Lodge's
Illustrious Portraits, namely, that in engraving the portraits selected, truth had often times
been sacrificed to effect; so that one had a better picture, though a less faithful copy,--such
an objection cannot be urged against a work to which our attention has just been directed,
Harding's Historical Portraits. In this endeavour to bring before us the men of past time,
each "in his habit as he lived," the scrupulous accuracy with which Mr. Harding copies an old
portrait has been well seconded by the engravers, so that this work is unrivalled for the fidelity
with which it exhibits, as by a Daguerrotype, copies in little of some very curious portraits
of old-world worthies. The collection is limited in extent; but, as it contains plates of individuals
of whom no other engraving exists, will be a treasure to illustrators of Clarendon, Granger,
&c. Among the most interesting subjects are Henry VIII. and Charles V., from the remarkable
picture formerly at Strawberry Hill; Sir Robert Dudley, son of Elizabeth's favourite; Lord
Russel of Thornhaugh, from the picture at Woburn; Speaker Lenthall; and the remarkable portrait
of Henry Carey Viscount Falkland, dressed in white, painted by Van Somer, which suggested to
Horace Walpole his Castle of Otranto.

Messrs. Sotheby and Co. will sell on Thursday next, a small but superb collection of drawings
by modern artists; and on the following Monday will commence a six days' sale of the third
portion of the important stock of prints of Messrs. Smith; comprising some of the works of
the most eminent engravers of the continental and English schools, including a matchless collection
of the works of the Master of Fontainebleau, engraver's proofs of book plates, and a few fine
drawings.

We have received the following Catalogues:--J. Peteram's (94. High Holborn) Catalogue, Part
CXI., No. 5. for 1850 of Old and New Books; and J. Miller's (43.

JOLDERVY'S COLLECTION OF ENGLISH EPITAPHS, or any other.

NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.

Although we have this week again enlarged NOTES AND QUERIES from 16 to 24 pages, in fulfilment
of our promise to do so when the number and extent of our communications called for it, we
have been compelled to omit many Notes, Queries, and Replies of great interest.

Our attention has been called by more than one of our earliest contributors to the inconvenience
of the single initial, which they had originally adopted, being assumed by subsequent correspondents,
who probably had no idea that the A., B., or C., by which they thought to distinguish their
communications, was already in use. Will our friends avoid this in future by prefixing another
letter or two to their favourite A., B., or C.

Errata..--No. 25. p. 398. col. 2. line 44., for "L.D." read "L.R."; No 26. p. 416. col. 2.
line 52., for "Beattie" read "Bentley"; and the Latin Epigram, p. 422., should commence "Longè"
instead of "Longi," and be subscribed "T.D." instead of "W. (1)."
