~Physical properties.~ Hydrochloric acid is a colorless gas which has an irritating effect
when inhaled, and possesses a sour, biting taste, but no marked odor. It is heavier than air
(density = 1.26) and is very soluble in water. Under standard conditions 1 volume of water
dissolves about 500 volumes of the gas. On warming such a solution the gas escapes, until at
the boiling point the solution contains about 20% by weight of HCl. Further boiling will not
drive out any more acid, but the solution will distill with unchanged concentration. A more
dilute solution than this will lose water on boiling until it has reached the same concentration,
20%, and will then distill unchanged. Under high pressure the gas can be liquefied, 28 atmospheres
being required at 0°. Under these conditions it forms a colorless liquid which is not very
active chemically. It boils at -80° and solidifies at -113°. The solution of the gas in water
is used almost entirely in the place of the gas itself, since it is not only far more convenient
but also more active.

~Chemical properties.~ The most important chemical properties of hydrochloric acid are the
following:

1. Action as an acid. In aqueous solution hydrochloric acid has very strong acid properties;
indeed, it is one of the strongest acids. It acts upon oxides and hydroxides, converting them
into salts:

    NaOH + HCl = NaCl + H{2}O,
    CuO + 2HCl = CuCl{2} + H{2}O.

It acts upon many metals, forming chlorides and liberating hydrogen:

    Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl{2} + 2H,
    Al + 3HCl = AlCl{3} + 3H.

Unlike nitric and sulphuric acids it has no oxidizing action, so that when it acts on metals
hydrogen is always given off.

2. Relation to combustion. Hydrochloric acid gas is not readily decomposed, and is therefore
neither combustible nor a supporter of combustion.

3. Action on oxidizing agents. Although hydrochloric acid is incombustible, it can be oxidized
under some circumstances, in which case the hydrogen combines with oxygen, while the chlorine
is set free. Thus, when a solution of hydrochloric acid acts upon manganese dioxide part of
the chlorine is set free:

    MnO{2} + 4HCl = MnCl{2} + 2H{2}O + 2Cl.

~Aqua regia.~ It has been seen that when nitric acid acts as an oxidizing agent it usually
decomposes, as represented in the equation

    2HNO{3} = H{2}O + 2NO + 3O.

The oxygen so set free may act on hydrochloric acid:

    6HCl + 3O = 3H{2}O + 6Cl.

The complete equation therefore is

    2HNO{3} + 6HCl = 4H{2}O + 2NO + 6Cl.

When concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids are mixed this reaction goes on slowly, chlorine
and some other substances not represented in the equation being formed. The mixture is known
as aqua regia and is commonly prepared by adding one volume of nitric acid to three volumes
of hydrochloric acid. It acts more powerfully upon metals and other substances than either
of the acids separately, and owes its strength not to acid properties but to the action of
the nascent chlorine which it liberates. Consequently, when it acts upon metals such as gold
it converts them into chlorides, and the reaction can be represented by such equations as

    Au + 3Cl = AuCl{3}.

~Salts of hydrochloric acid,--chlorides.~ The chlorides of all the metals are known and many
of them are very important compounds. Some of them are found in nature, and all can be prepared
by the general method of preparing salts. Silver chloride, lead chloride, and mercurous chloride
are insoluble in water and acids, and can be prepared by adding hydrochloric acid to solutions
of compounds of the respective elements. While the chlorides have formulas similar to the fluorides,
their properties are often quite different. This is seen in the solubility of the salts. Those
metals whose chlorides are insoluble form soluble fluorides, while many of the metals which
form soluble chlorides form insoluble fluorides.

~Compounds of chlorine with oxygen and hydrogen.~ Chlorine combines with oxygen and hydrogen
to form four different acids. They are all quite unstable, and most of them cannot be prepared
in pure form; their salts can easily be made, however, and some of them will be met with in
the study of the metals. The formulas and names of these acids are as follows:

    HClO       hypochlorous acid.

    HClO{2}   chlorous acid.

    HClO{3}   chloric acid.

    HClO{4}   perchloric acid.

~Oxides of chlorine.~ Two oxides are known, having the formulas Cl{2}O and ClO{2}. They decompose
very easily and are good oxidizing agents.

BROMINE

~Historical.~ Bromine was discovered in 1826 by the French chemist Ballard, who isolated it
from sea salt. He named it bromine (stench) because of its unbearable fumes.

~Occurrence.~ Bromine occurs almost entirely in the form of bromides, especially as sodium
bromide and magnesium bromide, which are found in many salt springs and salt deposits. The
Stassfurt deposits in Germany and the salt waters of Ohio and Michigan are especially rich
in bromides.

~Preparation of bromine.~ The laboratory method of preparing bromine is essentially different
from the commercial method.

1. Laboratory method. As in the case of chlorine, bromine can be prepared by the action of
hydrobromic acid (HBr) on manganese dioxide. Since hydrobromic acid is not an article of commerce,
a mixture of sulphuric acid and a bromide is commonly substituted for it. The materials are
placed in a retort arranged as shown in Fig. 55. The end of the retort just touches the surface
of the water in the test tube. On heating, the bromine distills over and is collected in the
cold receiver. The equation is

    2NaBr + 2H{2}SO{4} + MnO{2} = Na{2}SO{4} + MnSO{4}
      + 2H{2}O + 2Br.

2. Commercial method. Bromine is prepared commercially from the waters of salt wells which
are especially rich in bromides. On passing a current of electricity through such waters the
bromine is first liberated. Any chlorine liberated, however, will assist in the reaction, since
free chlorine decomposes bromides, as shown in the equation

    NaBr + Cl = NaCl + Br.

When the water containing the bromine is heated, the liberated bromine distills over into the
receiver.

~Physical properties.~ Bromine is a dark red liquid about three times as heavy as water. Its
vapor has a very offensive odor and is most irritating to the eyes and throat. The liquid boils
at 59° and solidifies at -7°; but even at ordinary temperatures it evaporates rapidly, forming
a reddish-brown gas very similar to nitrogen peroxide in appearance. Bromine is somewhat soluble
in water, 100 volumes of water under ordinary conditions dissolving 1 volume of the liquid.
It is readily soluble in carbon disulphide, forming a yellow solution.

~Chemical properties and uses.~ In chemical action bromine is very similar to chlorine. It
combines directly with many of the same elements with which chlorine unites, but with less
energy. It combines with hydrogen and takes away the latter element from some of its compounds,
but not so readily as does chlorine. Its bleaching properties are also less marked.

Bromine finds many uses in the manufacture of organic drugs and dyestuffs and in the preparation
of bromides.

~Hydrobromic acid (HBr).~ When sulphuric acid acts upon a bromide hydrobromic acid is set free:

    2NaBr + H{2}SO{4} = Na{2}SO{4} + 2HBr.

At the same time some bromine is set free, as may be seen from the red fumes which appear,
and from the odor. The explanation of this is found in the fact that hydrobromic acid is much
less stable than hydrochloric acid, and is therefore more easily oxidized. Concentrated sulphuric
acid is a good oxidizing agent, and oxidizes a part of the hydrobromic acid, liberating bromine:

    H{2}SO{4} + 2HBr = 2H{2}O + SO{2} + 2Br.

     ~Preparation of pure hydrobromic acid.~ A convenient way to make
     pure hydrobromic acid is by the action of bromine upon moist
     red phosphorus. This can be done with the apparatus shown in
     Fig. 56. Bromine is put into the dropping funnel A, and red
     phosphorus, together with enough water to cover it, is placed
     in the flask B. By means of the stopcock the bromine is
     allowed to flow drop by drop into the flask, the reaction
     taking place without the application of heat. The equations are

    (1) P + 3Br = PBr{3},

    (2) PBr{3} + 3H{2}O = P(OH){3} + 3HBr.

     The U-tube C contains glass beads which have been moistened
     with water and rubbed in red phosphorus. Any bromine escaping
     action in the flask acts upon the phosphorus in the U-tube. The
     hydrobromic acid is collected in the same way as hydrochloric
     acid.

~Properties.~ Hydrobromic acid very strikingly resembles hydrochloric acid in physical and
chemical properties. Chemically, the chief point in which it differs from hydrochloric acid
is in the fact that it is much more easily oxidized, so that bromine is more readily set free
from it than chlorine is from hydrochloric acid.

~Salts of hydrobromic acid,--bromides.~ The bromides are very similar to the chlorides in their
properties. Chlorine acts upon both bromides and free hydrobromic acid, liberating bromine
from them:

    KBr + Cl = KCl + Br,

    HBr + Cl = HCl + Br.

Silver bromide is extensively used in photography, and the bromides of sodium and potassium
are used as drugs.

     ~Oxygen compounds.~ No oxides of bromine are surely known, and
     bromine does not form so many oxygen acids as chlorine does.
     Salts of hypobromous acid (HBrO) and bromic acid (HBrO{3}) are
     known.

IODINE

~Historical.~ Iodine was discovered in 1812 by Courtois in the ashes of certain sea plants.
Its presence was revealed by its beautiful violet vapor, and this suggested the name iodine
(from the Greek for violet appearance).

~Occurrence.~ In the combined state iodine occurs in very small quantities in sea water, from
which it is absorbed by certain sea plants, so that it is found in their ashes. It occurs along
with bromine in salt springs and beds, and is also found in Chili saltpeter.

~Preparation.~ Iodine may be prepared in a number of ways, the principal methods being the
following:

1. Laboratory method. Iodine can readily be prepared in the laboratory from an iodide by the
method used in preparing bromine, except that sodium iodide is substituted for sodium bromide.
It can also be made by passing chlorine into a solution of an iodide.

2. Commercial method. Commercially iodine was formerly prepared from seaweed (kelp), but is
now obtained almost entirely from the deposits of Chili saltpeter. The crude saltpeter is dissolved
in water and the solution evaporated until the saltpeter crystallizes. The remaining liquors,
known as the "mother liquors," contain sodium iodate (NaIO{3}), in which form the iodine is
present in the saltpeter. The chemical reaction by which the iodine is liberated from this
compound is a complicated one, depending on the fact that sulphurous acid acts upon iodic acid,
setting iodine free. This reaction is shown as follows:

    2HIO{3} + 5H{2}SO{3} = 5H{2}SO{4} + H{2}O + 2I.

     ~Purification of iodine.~ Iodine can be purified very
     conveniently in the following way. The crude iodine is placed
     in an evaporating dish E (Fig. 57), and the dish is set upon
     the sand bath S. The iodine is covered with the inverted
     funnel F, and the sand bath is gently heated with a Bunsen
     burner. As the dish becomes warm the iodine rapidly evaporates
     and condenses again on the cold surface of the funnel in
     shining crystals.

     This process, in which a solid is converted into a vapor and is
     again condensed into a solid without passing through the liquid
     state, is called sublimation.

~Physical properties.~ Iodine is a purplish-black, shining, heavy solid which crystallizes
in brilliant plates. Even at ordinary temperatures it gives off a beautiful violet vapor, which
increases in amount as heat is applied. It melts at 107° and boils at 175°. It is slightly
soluble in water, but readily dissolves in alcohol, forming a brown solution (tincture of iodine),
and in carbon disulphide, forming a violet solution. The element has a strong, unpleasant odor,
though by no means as irritating as that of chlorine and bromine.

~Chemical properties.~ Chemically iodine is quite similar to chlorine and bromine, but is still
less active than bromine. It combines directly with many elements at ordinary temperatures.
At elevated temperatures it combines with hydrogen, but the reaction is reversible and the
compound formed is quite easily decomposed. Both chlorine and bromine displace it from its salts:

    KI + Br = KBr + I,

    KI + Cl = KCl + I.

When even minute traces of iodine are added to thin starch paste a very intense blue color
develops, and this reaction forms a delicate test for iodine. Iodine is extensively used in
medicine, especially in the form of a tincture. It is also largely used in the preparation
of dyes and organic drugs, iodoform, a substance used as an antiseptic, has the formula CHI{3}.

~Hydriodic acid (HI).~ This acid cannot be prepared in pure condition by the action of sulphuric
acid upon an iodide, since the hydriodic acid set free is oxidized by the sulphuric acid just
as in the case of hydrobromic acid, but to a much greater extent. It can be prepared in exactly
the same way as hydrobromic acid, iodine being substituted for bromine. It can also be prepared
by passing hydrosulphuric acid into water in which iodine is suspended. The equation is

    H{2}S + 2I = 2HI + S.

The hydriodic acid formed in this way dissolves in the water. It is, however, more unstable
than either hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids, and on exposure to the air it gradually decomposes
in accordance with the equation

    2HI + O = H{2}O + 2I.

Owing to the slight affinity between iodine and hydrogen the acid easily gives up its hydrogen
and is therefore a strong reducing agent. This is seen in its action on sulphuric acid.

The salts of hydriodic acid, the iodides, are, in general, similar to the chlorides and bromides.
Potassium iodide (KI) is the most familiar of the iodides and is largely used in medicine.

     ~Oxygen compounds.~ Iodine has a much greater affinity for oxygen
     than has either chlorine or bromine. When heated with nitric
     acid it forms a stable oxide (I{2}O{5}). Salts of iodic acid
     (HIO{3}) and periodic acid (HIO{4}) are easily prepared, and
     the free acids are much more stable than the corresponding
     acids of the other members of this family. With bromine and iodine similar
combining ratios hold good. These facts recall the simple volume
relations already noted in the study of the composition of steam and
ammonia. These relations may be represented graphically in the following
way:

              +---+   +----+    +------+    +------+
              | H | + | Cl | =  | H Cl |  + | H Cl |
              +---+   +----+    +------+    +------+

       +---+  +---+   +---+    +--------+   +--------+
       | H |  | H | + | O |  = | H{2}O | + | H{2}O |
       +---+  +---+   +---+    +--------+   +--------+

+---+  +---+  +---+   +---+    +--------+   +--------+ | H |  | H |  | H | + | N |  = | NH{3}
| + | NH{3} | +---+  +---+  +---+   +---+    +--------+   +--------+

In the early part of the past century Gay-Lussac, a distinguished French chemist, studied the
volume relations of many combining gases, and concluded that similar relations always hold.
His observations are summed up in the following law: When two gases combine chemically there
is always a simple ratio between their volumes, and between the volume of either one of them
and that of the product, provided it is a gas. By a simple ratio is meant of course the ratio
of small whole numbers, as 1 : 2, 2 : 3.

CHAPTER XVII

CARBON AND SOME OF ITS SIMPLER COMPOUNDS

~The family.~ Carbon stands at the head of a family of elements in the fourth group in the
periodic table. The resemblances between the elements of this family, while quite marked, are
not so striking as in the case of the elements of the chlorine family. With the exception of
carbon, these elements are comparatively rare, and need not be taken up in detail in this chapter.
Titanium will be referred to again in connection with silicon which it very closely resembles.

~Occurrence.~ Carbon is found in nature in the uncombined state in several forms. The diamond
is practically pure carbon, while graphite and coal are largely carbon, but contain small amounts
of other substances. Its natural compounds are exceedingly numerous and occur as gases, liquids,
and solids. Carbon dioxide is its most familiar gaseous compound. Natural gas and petroleum
are largely compounds of carbon with hydrogen. The carbonates, especially calcium carbonate,
constitute great strata of rocks, and are found in almost every locality. All living organisms,
both plant and animal, contain a large percentage of this element, and the number of its compounds
which go to make up all the vast variety of animate nature is almost limitless. Over one hundred
thousand definite compounds containing carbon have been prepared. In the free state carbon
occurs in three allotropic forms, two of which are crystalline and one amorphous.

~Crystalline carbon.~ Crystalline carbon occurs in two forms,--diamond and graphite.

1. Diamond. Diamonds are found in considerable quantities in several localities, especially
in South Africa, the East Indies, and Brazil. The crystals belong to the regular system, but
the natural stones do not show this very clearly. When found they are usually covered with
a rough coating which is removed in the process of cutting. Diamond cutting is carried on most
extensively in Holland.

The density of the diamond is 3.5, and, though brittle, it is one of the hardest of substances.
Black diamonds, as well as broken and imperfect stones which are valueless as gems, are used
for grinding hard substances. Few chemical reagents have any action on the diamond, but when
heated in oxygen or the air it blackens and burns, forming carbon dioxide.

Lavoisier first showed that carbon dioxide is formed by the combustion of the diamond; and
Sir Humphry Davy in 1814 showed that this is the only product of combustion, and that the diamond
is pure carbon.

     ~The diamond as a gem.~ The pure diamond is perfectly transparent
     and colorless, but many are tinted a variety of colors by
     traces of foreign substances. Usually the colorless ones are
     the most highly prized, although in some instances the color
     adds to the value; thus the famous Hope diamond is a beautiful
     blue. Light passing through a diamond is very much refracted,
     and to this fact the stone owes its brilliancy and sparkle.

     ~Artificial preparation of diamonds.~ Many attempts have been
     made to produce diamonds artificially, but for a long time
     these always ended in failure, graphite and not diamonds being
     the product obtained. The French chemist Moissan, in his
     extended study of chemistry at high temperatures, finally
     succeeded (1893) in making some small ones. He accomplished
     this by dissolving carbon in boiling iron and plunging the
     crucible containing the mixture into water, as shown in Fig.
     58. Under these conditions the carbon crystallized in the iron
     in the form of the diamond. The diamonds were then obtained by
     dissolving away the iron in hydrochloric acid.

2. Graphite. This form of carbon is found in large quantities, especially in Ceylon, Siberia,
and in some localities of the United States and Canada. It is a shining black substance, very
soft and greasy to the touch. Its density is about 2.15. It varies somewhat in properties according
to the locality in which it is found, and is more easily attacked by reagents than is the diamond.
It is also manufactured by heating carbon with a small amount of iron (3%) in an electric furnace.
It is used in the manufacture of lead pencils and crucibles, as a lubricant, and as a protective
covering for iron in the form of a polish or a paint.

~Amorphous carbon.~ Although there are many varieties of amorphous carbon known, they are not
true allotropic modifications. They differ merely in their degree of purity, their fineness
of division, and in their mode of preparation. These substances are of the greatest importance,
owing to their many uses in the arts and industries. As they occur in nature, or are made artificially,
they are nearly all impure carbon, the impurity depending on the particular substance in question.

1. Pure carbon. Pure amorphous carbon is best prepared by charring sugar. This is a substance
consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the latter two elements being present in the ratio
of one oxygen atom to two of hydrogen. When sugar is strongly heated the oxygen and hydrogen
are driven off in the form of water and pure carbon is left behind. Prepared in this way it
is a soft, lustrous, very bulky, black powder.

2. Coal and coke. Coals of various kinds were probably formed from vast accumulations of vegetable
matter in former ages, which became covered over with earthy material and were thus protected
from rapid decay. Under various natural agencies the organic matter was slowly changed into
coal. In anthracite these changes have gone the farthest, and this variety of coal is nearly
pure carbon. Soft or bituminous coals contain considerable organic matter besides carbon and
mineral substances. When heated strongly out of contact with air the organic matter is decomposed
and the resulting volatile matter is driven off in the form of gases and vapors, and only the
mineral matter and carbon remain behind. The gaseous product is chiefly illuminating gas and
the solid residue is coke. Some of the coke is found as a dense cake on the sides and roof
of the retort. This is called retort carbon and is quite pure.

3. Charcoal. This is prepared from wood in the same way that coke is made from coal. When the
process is carried on in retorts the products expelled by the heat are saved. Among these are
many valuable substances such as wood alcohol and acetic acid. Where timber is abundant the
process is carried out in a wasteful way, by merely covering piles of wood with sod and setting
the wood on fire. Some wood burns and the heat from this decomposes the wood not burned, forming
charcoal from it. The charcoal, of course, contains the mineral part of the wood from which
it is formed.

4. Bone black. This is sometimes called animal charcoal, and is made by charring bones and
animal refuse. The organic part of the materials is thus decomposed and carbon is left in a
very finely divided state, scattered through the mineral part which consists largely of calcium
phosphate. For some uses this mineral part is removed by treatment with hydrochloric acid and
prolonged washing.

5. Lampblack. Lampblack and soot are products of imperfect combustion of oil and coal, and
are deposited from a smoky flame on a cold surface. The carbon in this form is very finely
divided and usually contains various oily materials.

~Properties.~ While the various forms of carbon differ in many properties, especially in color
and hardness, yet they are all odorless, tasteless solids, insoluble in water and characterized
by their stability towards heat. Only in the intense heat of the electric arc does carbon volatilize,
passing directly from the solid state into a vapor. Owing to this fact the inside surface of
an incandescent light bulb after being used for some time becomes coated with a dark film of
carbon. It is not acted on at ordinary temperatures by most reagents, but at a higher temperature
it combines directly with many of the elements, forming compounds called carbides. When heated
in the presence of sufficient oxygen it burns, forming carbon dioxide.

~Uses of carbon.~ The chief use of amorphous carbon is for fuel to furnish heat and power for
all the uses of civilization. An enormous quantity of carbon in the form of the purer coals,
coke, and charcoal is used as a reducing agent in the manufacture of the various metals, especially
in the metallurgy of iron. Most of the metals are found in nature as oxides, or in forms which
can readily be converted into oxides. When these oxides are heated with carbon the oxygen is
abstracted, leaving the metal. Retort carbon and coke are used to make electric light carbons
and battery plates, while lampblack is used for indelible inks, printer's ink, and black varnishes.
Bone black and charcoal have the property of absorbing large volumes of certain gases, as well
as smaller amounts of organic matter; hence they are used in filters to remove noxious gases
and objectionable colors and odors from water. Bone black is used extensively in the sugar
refineries to remove coloring matter from the impure sugars.

~Chemistry of carbon compounds.~ Carbon is remarkable for the very large number of compounds
which it forms with the other elements, especially with oxygen and hydrogen. Compounds containing
carbon are more numerous than all others put together, and the chemistry of these substances
presents peculiarities not met with in the study of other substances. For these reasons the
systematic study of carbon compounds, or of organic chemistry as it is usually called, must
be deferred until the student has gained some knowledge of the chemistry of other elements.
An acquaintance with a few of the most familiar carbon compounds is, however, essential for
the understanding of the general principles of chemistry.

~Compounds of carbon with hydrogen,--the hydrocarbons.~ Carbon unites with hydrogen to form
a very large number of compounds called hydrocarbons. Petroleum and natural gas are essentially
mixtures of a great variety of these hydrocarbons. Many others are found in living plants,
and still others are produced by the decay of organic matter in the absence of air. Only two
of them, methane and acetylene, will be discussed here.

~Methane~ (marsh gas) (CH{4}). This is one of the most important of these hydrocarbons, and
constitutes about nine tenths of natural gas. As its name suggests, it is formed in marshes
by the decay of vegetable matter under water, and bubbles of the gas are often seen to rise
when the dead leaves on the bottom of pools are stirred. It also collects in mines, and, when
mixed with air, is called fire damp by the miners because of its great inflammability, damp
being an old name for a gas. It is formed when organic matter, such as coal or wood, is heated
in closed vessels, and is therefore a principal constituent of coal gas.

~Preparation.~ Methane is prepared in the laboratory by heating sodium or calcium acetate with
soda-lime. Equal weights of fused sodium acetate and soda-lime are thoroughly dried, then mixed
and placed in a good-sized, hard-glass test tube fitted with a one-holed stopper and delivery
tube. The mixture is gradually heated, and when the air has been displaced from the tube the
gas is collected in bottles by displacement of water. Soda-lime is a mixture of sodium and
calcium hydroxides. Regarding it as sodium hydroxide alone, the equation is

    NaC{2}H{3}O{2} + NaOH = Na{2}CO{3} + CH{4}.

~Properties.~ Methane is a colorless, odorless gas whose density is 0.55. It is difficult to
liquefy, boiling at -155° under standard pressure, and is almost insoluble in water. It burns
with a pale blue flame, liberating much heat, and when mixed with oxygen is very explosive.

~Davy's safety lamp.~ In 1815 Sir Humphry Davy invented a lamp for the use of miners, to prevent
the dreadful mine explosions then common, due to methane mixed with air. The invention consisted
in surrounding the upper part of the common miner's lamp with a mantle of wire gauze and the
lower part with glass (Fig. 59). It has been seen that two gases will not combine until raised
to their kindling temperature, and if while combining they are cooled below this point, the
combination ceases. A flame will not pass through a wire gauze because the metal, being a good
conductor of heat, takes away so much heat from the flame that the gases are cooled below the
kindling temperature. When a lamp so protected is brought into an explosive mixture the gases
inside the wire mantle burn in a series of little explosions, giving warning to the miner that
the air is unsafe.

~Acetylene~ (C{2}H{2}). This is a colorless gas usually having a disagreeable odor due to impurities.
It is now made in large quantities from calcium carbide (CaC{2}). This substance is formed
when coal and lime are heated together in an electric furnace. When treated with water the
carbide is decomposed, yielding acetylene:

    CaC{2} + 2H{2}O = C{2}H{2} + Ca(OH){2}.
