North and South had scarcely grasped the full significance of Lee's surrender, when, only five
days later, Lincoln was assassinated. "It would be impossible for me," said Grant, "to describe
the feeling that overcame me at the news. I felt that reconstruction had been set back, no
telling how far." "Of all the men I ever met," said Sherman, "he seemed to possess more of
the elements of greatness, combined with goodness, than any other."

On the very day of the assassination Sherman had written to Johnston offering the same terms
Grant had given Lee and Lincoln had most heartily approved. Three days later, on the seventeenth,
just as Sherman was entering the train for his meeting with Johnston, the operator handed him
a telegram announcing the assassination. Enjoining secrecy till he returned, Sherman took the
telegram with him and showed it to Johnston, whom he watched intently. When Sherman got back
to Raleigh he published the news in general orders, and experienced the supreme satisfaction
of finding that not one man in all that mournful army had to be restrained from a single act
of revenge.

After much misunderstanding with Washington now in lesser hands, the surrender of Johnston's
and the other Confederate armies was effected. Each body of troops laid down its arms and quietly
dispersed. One day the bugles called, the camp fires burned, and comrades were together in
the ranks. The next, like morning mists, they disappeared, thenceforth to be remembered and
admired only as the heroes of a hopeless cause.

It was a very different scene through which their rivals marched into lasting fame with all
the pride, pomp, and circumstance of war. On the twenty-third and twenty-fourth of May, in
perfect weather, and in the stirring presence of a loyal, vast, enthusiastic throng, the Union
armies were reviewed in Washington. For over six full hours each day the troops marched past--the
very flower of those who had come back victorious. The route was flagged from end to end with
Stars and Stripes, and banked with friends of each and every regiment there. Between these
banks, and to the sound of thrilling martial music, the long blue column flowed--a living stream
of men whose bayonets made its surface flash like burnished silver under the glorious sun.

Then, when the pageantry was finished, and the volunteers that formed the vast bulk of those
magnificent Federal armies had again become American civilians in thought and word and deed,
these steadfast men, whose arms had saved the Union in the field, were first in peace as they
had been in war: first in the reconstruction of their country's interrupted life, first in
recognizing all that was best in the splendid fighters with whom they had crossed swords, and
first--incomparably first--in keeping one and indivisible the reunited home land of both North
and South.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

Thousands of books have been written about the Civil War; and more about the armies than about
the navies and the civil interests together. Yet, even about the armies, there are very few
that give a just idea of how every part of the war was correlated with every other part and
with the very complex whole; while fewer still give any idea of how closely the navies were
correlated with the armies throughout the long amphibious campaigns.

The only works mentioned here are either those containing the original evidence or those written
by experts directly from the original evidence. And of course there are a good many works belonging
to both these classes for which no room can be found in a bibliography so very brief as the
present one must be. (1894-), form two magnificent collections of original evidence published
by the United States Government. But they have some gaps which nothing else can fill. Battles
and Leaders of the Civil War (1887-89), written by competent witnesses on both sides, gives
the gist of the story in four volumes (published afterwards in eight). The Rebellion Record,
12 vols. (1862-68), edited by Frank Moore, forms an interesting collection of non-official
documents. The Story of the Civil War, 4 vols. (1895-1913), begun by J. C. Ropes, and continued
by W. R. Livermore, is an historical work of real value. Larned's Literature of American History
contains an excellent bibliography; but it needs supplementing by bibliographies of the present
century. Inquiring readers should consult the bibliographies in volumes 20 and 21 (by J. K.
Hosmer) in the American Nation series.

There are many works of a more special kind that deserve particular attention. General E. P.
Alexander's Military Memoirs of a Confederate (1907), the Transactions of the Military Historical
Society of Massachusetts, Major John Bigelow's The Campaign of Chancellorsville (1910), and
J. D. Cox's Military Reminiscences, 2 vols. (1900), are admirable specimens of this very extensive
class.

The two greatest generals on the Northern side have written their own memoirs, and written
them exceedingly well: Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, 2 vols. (1885-86), and Memoirs of General
W. T. Sherman, 2 vols. (1886). But the two greatest on the Southern side wrote nothing themselves;
and no one else has written a really great life of that very great commander, Robert Lee. Fitzhugh
Lee's enthusiastic sketch of his uncle, General Lee (1894), is one of the several second-rate
books on the subject. Colonel G. F. R. Henderson's Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil
War, 2 vols. (1898), is, on the other hand, among the best of war biographies. Henderson's
strategical study of the Valley Campaign is a masterpiece. Two good works of very different
kinds are: A History of the Civil War in the United States (1905), by W. Birkbeck Wood and
Major J. E. Edmonds, and A History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850, 8 vols.
(1893-1919), by James Ford Rhodes. The first is military, the second political. Mr. Rhodes
has also written a single volume History of the Civil War (1917). American Campaigns by Major
M. F. Steele, issued under the supervision of the War Department (1909), deals chiefly with
the military operations of the Civil War.

The naval side of this, as of all other wars, has been far too much neglected. But that great
historian of sea-power, Admiral Mahan, has told the best of the story in his Admiral Farragut
(1892).

An interesting contemporary account of the war will be found in the five volumes of Appleton's
American Annual Cyclopdia for the years from 1861 to 1865. B. J. Lossing's Pictorial History
of the Civil War, 3 vols. (1866-69), and Harper's Pictorial History of the Rebellion, 2 vols.
(1868), give graphic pictures of military life as seen by contemporaries. Personal reminiscences
of the war, of varying merit, have multiplied rapidly in recent years. These are appraised
for the unwary reader in the bibliographies already mentioned. Frank Wilkeson's Recollections
of a Private Soldier in the Army of the Potomac (1887), George C. Eggleston's A Rebel's Recollections
(1905), and Mrs. Mary B. Chestnut's Diary from Dixie (1905) are among the best of these personal
recollections.

The political and diplomatic history has been dealt with already in the two preceding Chronicles.
Abraham Lincoln: a History, by John G. Nicolay and John Hay, in ten volumes (1890), and The
Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln, in twelve volumes (1905), form the quarry from which all
true accounts of his war statesmanship must be built up. Lord Charnwood's Abraham Lincoln (1917)
is an admirable summary. To these titles should be added Gideon Welles's Diary, 3 vols. (1870).
The best life of Jefferson Davis is that by William E. Dodd in the American Crisis Biographies
(1907). W. H. Russell's My Diary North and South (1863) records the impressions of an intelligent
foreign observer.

The present Chronicle is based entirely on the original evidence, with the convenient use only
of such works as have themselves been written by qualified experts directly from the original
evidence.
