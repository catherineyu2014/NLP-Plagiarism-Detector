A thick mist having risen up from the valley, the Vaudois set out, late at night, under the
guidance of Captain Poulat, a native of the district, who well knew the paths in the mountains.
They climbed up on to the heights above, over icy slopes, passing across gaping crevices and
along almost perpendicular rocks, admitting of their passage only in single file, sometimes
dragging themselves along on their bellies, clinging to the rocks or to the tufts of grass,
occasionally resting and praying, but never despairing. At length they succeeded, after a long
détour of the mountain crests, in gaining the northern slope of Guinevert. Here they came upon
and surprised the enemy's outpost, which fled towards the main body; and the Vaudois passed
on, panting and half dead with fatigue. When the morning broke, and the French proceeded to
penetrate the last redoubt on the Balsille, lo, it was empty! The defenders had abandoned it,
and they could scarcely believe their eyes when they saw the dangerous mountain escarpment
by which they had escaped in the night. Looking across the valley, far off, they saw the fugitives,
thrown into relief by the snow amidst which they marched, like a line of ants, apparently making
for the mass of the central Alps.

For three days they wandered from place to place, gradually moving southwards, their object
now being to take up their position at the Pra du Tour, the ancient fortress of the Barbas
in the valley of Angrogna. Before, however, they could reach this stronghold, and while they
were still at Pramol in the valley of Perosa, news of the most unexpected kind reached them,
which opened up the prospect of their deliverance. The news was no other than this--Savoy had
declared war against France!

A rupture between the two powers had for some time been imminent. Louis XIV. had become more
and more exacting in his demands on the Duke of Savoy, until the latter felt himself in a position
of oppressive vassalage. Louis had even intimated his intention of occupying Verrua and the
citadel of Turin; and the Duke, having previously ascertained through his cousin, Prince Eugène,
the willingness of the Emperor of Austria, pressed by William of Orange, to assist him in opposing
the pretensions of France, he at length took up his stand and declared war against Louis.

The Vaudois were now a power in the state, and both parties alike appealed to them for help,
promising them great favours. But the Vaudois, notwithstanding the treachery and cruelty of
successive Dukes of Savoy, were true to their native prince. They pledged themselves to hold
the valleys and defend the mountain passes against France.

In the first engagements which took place between the French and the Piedmontese, the latter
were overpowered, and the Duke became a fugitive. Where did he find refuge? In the valleys
of the Vaudois, in a secluded spot in the village of Rora, behind the Pelice, he found a safe
asylum amidst the people whose fathers he had hunted, proscribed, and condemned to death.

But the tide of war turned, and the French were eventually driven out of Piedmont. Many of
the Vaudois, who had settled in Brandenburg, Holland, and Switzerland, returned and settled
in the valleys; and though the Dukes of Savoy, with their accustomed treachery, more than once
allowed persecution to recommence, their descendants continue to enjoy the land, and to worship
after the manner of their fathers down to the present day.

The Vaudois long laboured under disabilities, and continued to be deprived of many social and
civil rights. But they patiently bided their time; and the time at length arrived. In 1848
their emancipation was one of the great questions of North Italy. It was taken up and advocated
by the most advanced minds of Piedmont. The petition to Charles Albert in their favour was
in a few days covered with the names of its greatest patriots, including those of Balbo, Cavour,
and D'Azeglio. Their emancipation was at length granted, and the Vaudois now enjoy the same
rights and liberties as the other subjects of Victor Emanuel.

Nor is the Vaudois Church any longer confined to the valleys, but it has become extended of
late years all over Italy--to Milan, Florence, Brescia, Verona, Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Palermo,
Cataneo, Venice, and even to Rome itself. In most of these places there are day-schools and
Sunday-schools, besides churches. The new church at Venice, held in the Cavagnis palace, seems
to have proved especially successful, the Sunday services being regularly attended by from
three to four hundred persons; while the day-schools in connection with the churches at Turin,
Leghorn, Naples, and Cataneo have proved very successful.

Thus, in the course of a few years, thirty-three Vaudois churches and stations, with about
an equal number of schools, have been established in various parts of Italy. The missionaries
report that the greatest difficulties they have to encounter arise from the incredulity and
indifference which are the natural heritage of the Romish Church; but that, nevertheless, the
work makes satisfactory progress--the good seed is being planted, and will yet bring forth
its increase in God's due time.

Finally, it cannot but be acknowledged that the people of the valleys, in so tenaciously and
conscientiously adhering to their faith, through good and through evil, during so many hundred
years, have set a glorious example to Piedmont, and have possibly been in no small degree instrumental
in establishing the reign of right and of liberty in Italy.
