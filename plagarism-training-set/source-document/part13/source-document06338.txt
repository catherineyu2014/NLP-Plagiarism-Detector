In ministry, this dear friend was pertinent and edifying, at times close and searching; in
the exercise of her gift, she travelled at different intervals in several of the English counties.
In the summer of 1848 her health began to decline; her demeanour under pain and suffering evinced
her humble dependence upon the Lord, and the language of her soul was, "not my will, but thine,
oh Father, be done!"  Some alleviation was permitted, and she so far recovered as to be able
to assemble with her friends for divine worship; on these occasions, her communications evinced
her undiminished interest in the cause of truth and righteousness.  In the last meeting she
attended, she bowed the knee in solemn supplication, craving for herself and those present,
the attainment of perfect purity and holiness, and that this might be the chief concern of
their lives.  A few days after, she was seized with paralysis, and although consciousness was
not entirely effaced, she said but little; she retained a grateful sense of her many mercies,
and a fervent affection towards her husband and near connections.  Gradually declining, she
passed away as falling into a sweet sleep, and we cannot doubt exchanged the tribulations of
time, for the blissful joys of eternity.

In an unexpected hour, and in the enjoyment of usual health, it pleased our heavenly Father
to lay his hand of affliction upon this dear friend, and after a severe illness of about four
weeks, to gather her, as we reverently believe, into "the rest which remaineth for the people
of God."

It appears, that in early life, "the grace which bringeth salvation," wrought effectually in
her heart, so that her surviving relatives cannot recall the time when the fear of God did
not influence her conduct; her pious mother, who for many years filled the station of Elder
in our Society; was deeply interested in the religious welfare of her children, and earnestly
sought, in the morning of their day, to imbue their minds with the principles and precepts
of the gospel of Christ, and her labours of love in reference to this beloved daughter were
graciously owned.  From her childhood, she was more than commonly dutiful and affectionate
to her parents, rarely giving them any cause for uneasiness; an aged grandmother also, who
resided for many years with them, she waited on with such tender care, as to call forth the
expression of her belief, that a blessing would rest on her on that account.

Great meekness, tenderness, and humility clothed her mind, not only throughout the season of
her affliction, but for a long course of previous years, binding her in very tender bonds to
her husband and children, as well as to her other endeared relatives and friends.

It appears, from the first day on which her illness assumed a more serious character, that
an impression pervaded her mind, that it would be unto death, and accompanying this impression,
a deep and earnest desire for entire resignation to the divine will; and this desire was graciously
answered; for during the period of her illness, her resignation, and consequent tranquillity,
were indeed remarkable; attended by a precious measure of "the peace of God which passeth all
understanding."  So fully was this the case, and so little of the appearance of death accompanied
her illness, that a lively hope of her restoration to health, was, even to the last day of
her life, earnestly cherished by those around her, and in addition to this, such was the nature
of her disease, that great stillness and uninterrupted rest were considered necessary; thus
circumstanced, whilst both her mind, and their minds, were abundantly satisfied with the precious
evidence of the love of God in Christ Jesus, shed abroad in her heart, they were not anxious
for much expression, or careful to commit to writing what, from season to season, fell from
her lips; feeling that her mind "wore thanksgiving to her Maker."

She evinced, throughout her married life, a deep interest in the well- being of her tenderly
beloved children, making it her frequent practice to spend some portion of her time in retirement
with them, in reading the holy scriptures and in prayer; and this interest increasingly appeared
as she lay on the bed of affliction, having them daily in her chamber, and again and again,
in tender affection, impressing on their minds the importance of divine and eternal things,
urging them to walk in the way of God's commandments, and to regard his favour and approbation
as the one thing, beyond all other things, necessary both to their present peace and everlasting
salvation: similar counsel was also extended to the other members of her household and family,
to the friends who kindly visited her, to her medical attendants, and to her neighbours.  More
might be said in reference to the Christian graces which marked the character of this beloved
friend, but the object is not to magnify the creature, but to set forth the excellency and
sufficiency of the "grace which is from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ," and by
the effectual operation of which, she was what she was.  The last words she addressed to her
tenderly beloved husband were: "All is well:" and again, shortly before the final close: "My
foundation is on the Rock;" that Rock, we undoubtingly believe, which "no tempest overthrows."

The sudden death, by Cholera, of this dear young friend, caused at the time a very lively emotion
among a wide circle of friends.  She was the only and much beloved child of her bereaved parents;--naturally
of a most amiable disposition, and of that lively temperament which gives a peculiar zest to
life and all its passing enjoyments, she diffused around her somewhat of the buoyancy and sunshine
which seemed ever to attend her own steps.  Thus attractive and admired, and drinking largely
of the cup of present pleasures, the thoughts of the future appear to have had but little place
in her mind.  In a state of excellent health, she had gone to Mountmelick to pass a few weeks
with some near relatives, when she was seized with the disorder which, in a few hours, closed
her life.  Those hours were passed in much bodily suffering, but sorer still were the conflicts
of her mind.  The scales which had prevented her from seeing the real worth of life and the
awful realities of the future, at once fell from her eyes, and she saw or rather felt with
indescribable clearness, that the great truths which appertain to the welfare of the soul belong
alike to the young and the healthy, to the sick and the dying.  She saw that she had been living
to herself and not to God, and this, whatever particulars she might lament, was the heavy burden
of her awakened spirit.  In the depths of contrition, and in the earnestness of faith, she
was enabled to pray to her heavenly Father, and Saviour, to draw near and to have mercy upon her.

Thus passed some hours never to be forgotten.  The rapid progress of her disease hardly allowed
time for much further mental exercise or expression.  She sank into a state of quietude of
body and of mind.  And when all was over, the sorrowing parents were condoled in the hope,
that the prayers of their beloved child had been heard, through the mercy of Him who never
turned away his ear from the truly repentant suppliant.

What lessons does this brief narrative offer to survivors.  Awfully does it speak to the children
of pleasure, of the inestimable value of the soul--of the importance of time--of the folly
of living in forgetfulness of God, and unmindful of their high destiny as immortal beings.
What a light does it throw on the responsibility of parents; and whilst affording no encouragement
to delay in the hope of a death-bed repentance, what a view does it open of the infinite mercy
of our heavenly Father in Christ Jesus.
