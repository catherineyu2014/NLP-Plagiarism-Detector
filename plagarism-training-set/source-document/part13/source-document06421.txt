It may readily be understood that an alloy containing four essential elements, namely: iron,
carbon, tungsten and chromium, is one whose study presents problems of extreme complexity.
It is possible that complex carbides may be formed, as in chromium steels, and that compounds
between iron and tungsten exist. Behavior of these combinations on heating and cooling must
be better known before we are able to explain many peculiarities of tungsten steels.

MOLYBDENUM

Molybdenum steels have been made commercially for twenty-five years, but they have not been
widely exploited until since the war. Very large resources of molybdenum have been developed
in America, and the mining companies who are equipped to produce the metal are very active
in advertising the advantages of molybdenum steels.

It was early found that 1 part molybdenum was the equivalent of from 2 to 2-1/2 parts of tungsten
in tool steels, and magnet steels. It fell into disrepute as an alloy for high-speed tool steel,
however, because it was found that the molybdenum was driven out of the surface of the tool
during forging and heat treating.

Within the last few years it has been found that the presence of less than 1 per cent of molybdenum
greatly enhances certain properties of heat-treated carbon and alloy steels used for automobiles
and high-grade machinery.

In general, molybdenum when added to an alloy steel, increases the figure for reduction of
area, which is considered a good measure of "toughness." Molybdenum steels are also relatively
insensible to variations in heat treatment; that is to say, a chromium-nickel-molybdenum steel
after quenching in oil from 1,450°F. may be drawn at any temperature between 900 and 1,100°F.
with substantially the same result (static tensile properties and hardness).

SILICON

Silicon prevents, to a large extent, defects such as gas bubbles or blow holes forming while
steel is solidifying. In fact, steel after it has been melted and before it has been refined,
is "wild" and "gassy." That is to say, if it would be cast into molds it would froth up, and
boil all over the floor. A judicious amount of silicon added to the metal just before pouring,
prevents this action--in the words of the steel maker, silicon "kills" the steel. If about
1.75 per cent metallic silicon remains in a 0.65 carbon steel, it makes excellent springs.

PHOSPHORUS

Phosphorus is one of the impurities in steel, and it has been the object of steel makers for
years to eliminate it. On cheap grades of steel, not subject to any abnormal strain or stress,
0.1 per cent phosphorus is not objectionable. High phosphorus makes steel "cold short," i.e.,
brittle when cold or moderately warm.

SULPHUR

Sulphur is another impurity and high sulphur is even a greater detriment to steel than phosphorus.
High sulphur up to 0.09 per cent helps machining properties, but has a tendency to make the
steel "hot short," i.e., subject to opening up cracks and seams at forging or rolling heats.
Sulphur should never exceed 0.06 per cent nor phosphorus 0.08 per cent.

Steel used for tool purposes should have as low phosphorus and sulphur contents as possible,
not over 0.02 per cent.

We can sum up the various factors something as follows for ready reference.

The ingredient        Its effect

  Iron            The basis of steel
  Carbon          The determinative
  Sulphur         A strength sapper
  Phosphorus      The weak link
  Oxygen          A strength destroyer
  Manganese       For strength
  Nickel          For strength and toughness
  Tungsten        Hardener and heat resister
  Chromium        For resisting shocks
  Vanadium        Purifier and fatigue resister
  Silicon         Impurity and hardener
  Titanium        Removes nitrogen and oxygen
  Molybdenum      Hardener and heat resister
  Aluminum        Kills or deoxidizes steel

PROPERTIES OF ALLOY STEELS

The following table shows the percentages of carbon, manganese, nickel, chromium and vanadium
in typical steel alloys for engineering purposes. It also gives the elastic limit, tensile
strength, elongation and reduction of area of the various alloys, all being given the same
heat treatment with a drawing temperature of 1,100°F. (600°C.). The specimens were one inch
rounds machined after heat treatment.

Tungsten is not shown in the table because it is seldom used in engineering construction steels
and then usually in combination with chromium. Tungsten is used principally for the magnets
of magnetos, to some extent in the manufacture of hacksaws, and for special tool steels.

NON-SHRINKING, OIL-HARDENING STEELS

Certain steels have a very low rate of expansion and contraction in hardening and are very
desirable for test plugs, gages, punches and dies, for milling cutters, taps, reamers, hard
steel bushings and similar work.

It is recommended that for forging these steels it be heated slowly and uniformly to a bright
red, but not in a direct flame or blast. Harden at a dull red heat, about 1,300°F. A clean
coal or coke fire, or a good muffle-gas furnace will give best results. Fish oil is good for
quenching although in some cases warm water will give excellent results. The steel should be
kept moving in the bath until perfectly cold. Heated and cooled in this way the steel is very
tough, takes a good cutting edge and has very little expansion or contraction which makes it
desirable for long taps where the accuracy of lead is important.

The composition of these steels is as follows:

               Per cent
  Manganese  1.40 to 1.60
  Carbon     0.80 to 0.90
  Vanadium   0.20 to 0.25

EFFECT OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF COPPER IN MEDIUM-CARBON STEEL

This shows the result of tests by C. R. Hayward and A. B. Johnston on two types of steel: one
containing 0.30 per cent carbon, 0.012 per cent phosphorus, and 0.860 per cent copper, and
the other 0.365 per cent carbon, 0.053 per cent phosphorus, and 0.030 per cent copper. The
accompanying chart in Fig. 13 shows that high-copper steel has decided superiority in tensile
strength, yield point and ultimate strength, while the ductility is practically the same. Hardness
tests by both methods show high-copper steel to be harder than low-copper, and the Charpy shock
tests show high-copper steel also superior to low-copper. The tests confirm those made by Stead,
showing that the behavior of copper steel resembles that of nickel steel. The high-copper steels
show finer grain than the low-copper. The quenched and drawn specimens of high-copper steel
were found to be slightly more martensitic.

HIGH-CHROMIUM OR RUST-PROOF STEEL

High-chromium, or what is called stainless steel containing from 11 to 14 per cent chromium,
was originally developed for cutlery purposes, but has in the past few years been used to a
considerable extent for exhaust valves in airplane engines because of its resistance to scaling
at high temperatures.

                                Percentage
  Carbon                       0.20 to 0.40
  Manganese, not to exceed         0.50
  Phosphorus, not to exceed        0.035
  Sulphur, not to exceed           0.035
  Chromium                    11.50 to 14.00
  Silicon, not to exceed           0.30

The steel should be heated slowly and forged at a temperature above 1,750°F. preferably between
1,800 and 2,200°F. If forged at temperatures between 1,650 and 1,750°F. there is considerable
danger of rupturing the steel because of its hardness at red heat. Owing to the air-hardening
property of the steel, the drop-forgings should be trimmed while hot. Thin forgings should
be reheated to redness before trimming, as otherwise they are liable to crack.

The forgings will be hard if they are allowed to cool in air. This hardness varies over a range
of from 250 to 500 Brinell, depending on the original forging temperature.

ANNEALING can be done by heating to temperatures ranging from 1,290 to 1,380°F. and cooling
in air or quenching in water or oil. After this treatment the forgings will have a hardness
of about 200 Brinell and a tensile strength of 100,000 to 112,000 lb. per square inch. If softer
forgings are desired they can be heated to a temperature of from 1,560 to 1,650°F. and cooled
very slowly. Although softer the forgings will not machine as smoothly as when annealed at
the lower temperature.

HARDENING.--The forgings can be hardened by cooling in still air or quenching in oil or water
from a temperature between 1,650 and 1,750°F.

The physical properties do not vary greatly when the carbon is within the range of composition
given, or when the steel is hardened and tempered in air, oil, or water.

When used for valves the following specification of physical properties have been used:

  Yield point, pounds per square inch       70,000
  Tensile strength, pounds per square inch  90,000
  Elongation in 2 in., per cent                 18
  Reduction of area, per cent                   50

The usual heat treatment is to quench in oil from 1,650°F. and temper or draw at 1,100 to 1,200°F.
One valve manufacturer stated that valves of this steel are hardened by heating the previously
annealed valves to 1,650°F. and cooling in still air. This treatment gives a scleroscope hardness
of about 50.

In addition to use in valves this steel should prove very satisfactory for shafting for water-pumps
and other automobile parts subject to objectionable corrosion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This steel can be drawn into wire, rolled into sheets and strips and drawn into seamless tubes.

CORROSION.--This steel like any other steel when distorted by cold working is more sensitive
to corrosion and will rust. Rough cut surfaces will rust. Surfaces finished with a fine cut
are less liable to rust. Ground and polished surfaces are practically immune to rust.

When chromium content is increased to 16 to 18 per cent and silicon is added, from 2 to 4 per
cent, this steel becomes rust proof in its raw state, as soon as the outside surface is removed.
It does not need to be heat-treated in any way. These compositions are both patented.

S. A. E. STANDARD STEELS

The following steel specifications are considered standard by the Society of Automotive Engineers
and represents automobile practice in this country. These tables give the S. A. E. number,
the composition of the steel and the heat treatment. These are referred to by letter--the heat
treatments being given in detail on pages 134 to 137 in Chap. 8. It should be noted that the
percentage of the different ingredients desired is the mean, or halfway between the minimum
and maximum.

LIBERTY MOTOR CONNECTING RODS

The requirements for materials for the Liberty motor connecting rods are so severe that the
methods of securing the desired qualities will be of value in other lines. The original specifications
called for chrome-nickel but the losses due to the difficulty of handling caused the Lincoln
Motor Company to suggest the substitution of chrome-vanadium steel, and this was accepted by
the Signal Corps. The rods were accordingly made from chromium-vanadium steel, containing carbon,
0.30 to 0.40 per cent; manganese, 0.50 to 0.80 per cent; phosphorus, not over 0.04 per cent;
sulphur, not over 0.04 per cent; chromium, 0.80 to 1.10 per cent; vanadium, not less than 0.15
per cent. This steel is ordinarily known in the trade as 0.35 carbon steel, S. A. E., specification
6,135, which provides a first-rate quality steel for structural parts that are to be heat-treated.
The fatigue resisting or endurance qualities of this material are excellent. It has a tensile
strength of 150,000 lb. minimum per square inch; elastic limit, 115,000 lb. minimum per square
inch; elongation, 5 per cent minimum in 2 in.; and minimum reduction in area, 25 per cent.

The original production system as outlined for the manufacturers had called for a heat treatment
in the rough-forged state for the connecting rods, and then semi-machining the rod forgings
before giving them the final treatment. The Lincoln Motor Company insisted from the first that
the proper method would be a complete heat treatment of the forging in the rough state, and
machining the rod after the heat treatment. After a number of trial lots, the Signal Corps
acceded to the request and production was immediately increased and quality benefited by the
change. This method was later included in a revised specification issued to all producers.

The original system was one that required a great deal of labor per unit output. The Lincoln
organization developed a method of handling connecting rods whereby five workmen accomplished
the same result that would have required about 30 or 32 by the original method. Even after
revising the specification so as to allow complete heat treatments in the rough-forged state,
the ordinary methods employed in heat-treating would have required 12 to 15 men. With the fixtures
employed, five men could handle 1,300 connecting rods, half of which are plain and half, forked,
in a working period of little over 7 hr.

The increase in production was gained by devising fixtures which enabled fewer men to handle
a greater quantity of parts with less effort and in less time.

In heat-treating the forgings were laid on a rack or loop A, Fig. 14, made of 1-1/4-in. double
extra-heavy pipe, bent up with parallel sides about 9 in. apart, one end being bent straight
across and the other end being bent upward so as to afford an easy grasp for the hook. Fifteen
rods were laid on each loop, there being four loops of rods charged into a furnace with a hearth
area of 36 by 66 in. The rods were charged at a temperature of approximately 900°F. They were
heated for refining over a period of 3 hr. to 1,625°F., soaked 15 min, at this degree of heat
and quenched in soluble quenching oil.

In pulling the heat to quench the rods, the furnace door was raised and the operator pulls
one of the loops A, Fig. 15 forward to the shelf of the furnace, supporting the straight end
of the loop by means of the porter bar B. They swung the loop of rods around from the furnace
shelf and set the straight end of the loop on the edge of the quenching tank, then raise the
curved end C, by means of their hook D so that all the rods on the loop slide into the oil bath.

Before the rods cooled entirely, the baskets in the quenching tank were raised and the oil
allowed to partly drain off the forgings, and they were stacked on curved-end loops or racks
and charged into the furnace for the second or hardening heat. The temperature of the furnace
was raised in 1-1/2 hr. to 1,550°F., the rods soaked for 15 min. at this degree of heat and
quenched in the same manner as above.

They were again drained while yet warm, placed on loops and charged into the furnace for the
third or tempering heat. The temperature of the furnace was brought to 1,100°F. in 1 hr., and
the rods soaked at this degree of heat for 1 hr. They were then removed from the furnace the
same as for quenching, but were dumped onto steel platforms instead of into the quenching oil,
and allowed to cool on these steel platforms down to the room temperature.

PICKLING THE FORGINGS

The forgings were then pickled in a hot solution of either niter cake or sulphuric acid and
water at a temperature of 170°F., and using a solution of about 25 per cent. The solution was
maintained at a constant point by taking hydrometer readings two or three times a day, maintaining
a reading of about 1.175. Sixty forked or one hundred single rods were placed in wooden racks
and immersed in a lead-lined vat 30 by 30 by 5 ft. long. The rack was lowered or lifted by
means of an air hoist and the rods were allowed to stay in solution from 1/2 to 1 hr., depending
on the amount of scale. The rods were then swung and lowered in the rack into running hot water
until all trace of the acid was removed.

The rod was finally subjected to Brinell test. This shows whether or not the rod has been heat-treated
to the proper hardness. If the rods did not read between 241 and 277, they were re-treated
until the proper hardness is obtained.

CHAPTER IV

APPLICATION OF LIBERTY ENGINE MATERIALS TO THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY[1]

[Footnote 1: Paper presented at the summer meeting of the S. A. E. at Ottawa Beach in June, 1919.]

The success of the Liberty engine program was an engineering achievement in which the science
of metallurgy played an important part. The reasons for the use of certain materials and certain
treatments for each part are given with recommendations for their application to the problems
of automotive industry.

The most important items to be taken into consideration in the selection of material for parts
of this type are uniformity and machineability. It has been demonstrated many times that the
ordinary grades of bessemer screw stock are unsatisfactory for aviation purposes, due to the
presence of excessive amounts of unevenly distributed phosphorus and sulphide segregations.
For this reason, material finished by the basic open hearth process was selected, in accordance
with the following specifications: Carbon, 0.150 to 0.250 per cent; manganese, 0.500 to 0.800
per cent; phosphorus, 0.045 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.060 to 0.090 per cent.

This material in the cold-drawn condition will show: Elastic limit, 50,000 lb. per square inch,
elongation in 2 in., 10 per cent, reduction of area, 35 per cent.

This material gave as uniform physical properties as S. A. E. No. 1020 steel and at the same
time was sufficiently free cutting to produce a smooth thread and enable the screw-machine
manufacturers to produce, to the same thread limits, approximately 75 per cent as many parts
as from bessemer screw stock.

There are but seven carbon-steel carbonized parts on the Liberty engine. The most important
are the camshaft, the camshaft rocker lever roller and the tappet. The material used for parts
of this type was S. A. E. No. 1,020 steel, which is of the following chemical analysis: Carbon
0.150 to 0.250 per cent; manganese, 0.300 to 0.600 per cent; phosphorus, 0.045 maximum per
cent; sulphur, 0.050 maximum per cent.

The heat treatment consisted in carbonizing at a temperature of from 1,650 to 1,700°F. for
a sufficient length of time to secure the proper depth of case, cool slowly or quench; then
reheat to a temperature of 1,380 to 1,430°F. to refine the grain of the case, and quench in
water. The only thing that should limit the rate of cooling from the carbonizing heat is distortion.
Camshaft rocker lever rollers and tappets, as well as gear pins, were quenched directly from
the carbonizing heat in water and then case-refined and rehardened by quenching in water from
a temperature of from 1,380 to 1,430°F.

The advantage of direct quenching from the carbonizing heat is doubtless one of economy, and
in many cases will save the cost of a reheating. Specifications for case hardening, issued
by the Society of Automotive Engineers, have lately been revised; whereas they formerly called
for a slow cooling, they now permit a quenching from the pot. Doubtless this is a step in advance.
Warpage caused by quenching can be reduced to a minimum by thoroughly annealing the stock before
any machine work is done on it.

Another advantage obtained from rapid cooling from the carbonizing heat is the retaining of
the majority of the excess cementite in solution which produces a less brittle case and by
so doing reduces the liability of grinding checks and chipping of the case in actual service.

In the case of the camshaft, it is not possible to quench directly from the carbonizing heat
because of distortion and therefore excessive breakage during straightening operations. All
Liberty camshafts were cooled slowly from carbonizing heat and hardened by a single reheating
to a temperature of from 1,380 to 1,430°F. and quenching in water.

Considerable trouble has always been experienced in obtaining uniform hardness on finished
camshafts. This is caused by insufficient water circulation in the quenching tank, which allows
the formation of steam pockets to take place, or by decarbonization of the case during heating
by the use of an overoxidizing flame. Another cause, which is very often overlooked, is due
to the case being ground off one side of cam more than the other and is caused by the roughing
master cam being slightly different from the finishing master cam. Great care should be taken
to see that this condition does not occur, especially when the depth of case is between 1/32
and 3/64 in.

CARBON-STEEL FORGINGS

Low-stressed, carbon-steel forgings include such parts as carbureter control levers, etc. The
important criterion for parts of this type is ease of fabrication and freedom from over-heated
and burned forgings.

Forgings subjected to this heat treatment are free from hard spots and will show a Brinell
hardness of 177 to 217, which is proper for all ordinary machining operations. Great care should
be taken not to use steel for parts of this type containing less than 0.25 per cent carbon,
because the lower the carbon the greater the liability of hard spots, and the more difficult
it becomes to eliminate them. The only satisfactory method so far in commercial use for the
elimination of hard spots is to give forgings a very severe quench from a high temperature
followed by a proper tempering heat to secure good machine ability as outlined above.

To obtain these physical properties, the forgings were quenched in water from a temperature
of 1,500 to 1,550°F., followed by tempering to meet proper Brinell requirements by heating
to a temperature of 1,150 to 1,200°F. and cooled slowly or quenched. No trouble of any kind
was ever experienced with parts of this type.

The principal carbon-steel pressed parts used on the Liberty engine were the water jackets
and the exhaust manifolds. The material used for parts of this type was S. A. E. No. 1,010
steel, which is of the following chemical composition: Carbon, 0.05 to 0.15 per cent; manganese,
0.30 to 0.60 per cent; phosphorus, 0.045 maximum per cent; sulphur, 0.045 maximum per cent.

No trouble was experienced in the production of any parts from this material with the exception
of the water jacket. Due to the particular design of the Liberty cylinder assembly, many failures
occurred in the early days, due to the top of the jacket cracking with a brittle fracture.
It was found that these failures were caused primarily from the use of jackets which showed
small scratches or die marks at this joint and secondarily by improper annealing of the jackets
themselves between the different forming operations. By a careful inspection for die marks
and by giving the jackets 1,400°F. annealing before the last forming operation, it was possible
to completely eliminate the trouble encountered.

HIGHLY STRESSED PARTS

The highly stressed parts on the Liberty engine consisted of the connecting-rod bolt, the main-bearing
bolt, the propeller-hub key, etc. The material used for parts of this type was selected at
the option of the manufacturer from standard S. A. E. steels, the composition of which are
given in Table 11.

TABLE 11.--COMPOSITION OF S. A. E. STEELS Nos.

The heat treatment employed to obtain these physical properties consisted in quenching from
a temperature of 1,525 to 1,575°F., in oil, followed by tempering at a temperature of from
925 to 975°F.

Due to the extremely fine limits used on all threaded parts for the Liberty engine, a large
percentage of rejection was due to warpage and scaling of parts. To eliminate this objection,
many of the Liberty engine builders adopted the use of heat-treated and cold-drawn alloy steel
for their highly stressed parts. On all sizes up to and including 3/8 in. in diameter, the
physical properties were secured by merely normalizing the hot-rolled bars by heating to a
temperature of from 1,525 to 1,575°F., and cooling in air, followed by the usual cold-drawing
reductions. For parts requiring stock over 3/8 in. in diameter, the physical properties desired
were obtained by quenching and tempering the hot-rolled bars before cold-drawing. It is the
opinion that the use of heat-treated and cold-drawn bars is very good practice, provided proper
inspection is made to guarantee the uniformity of heat treatment and, therefore, the uniformity
of the physical properties of the finished parts.

The question has been asked many times by different manufacturers, as to which alloy steel
offers the best machineability when heat-treated to a given Brinell hardness. The general consensus
of opinion among the screw-machine manufacturers is that S. A. E. No. 6,130 steel gives the
best machineability and that S. A. E. No. 2,330 steel would receive second choice of the three
specified.

In the finishing of highly stressed parts for aviation engines, extreme care must be taken
to see that all tool marks are eliminated, unless they are parallel to the axis of strain,
and that proper radii are maintained at all changes of section. This is of the utmost importance
to give proper fatigue resistance to the part in question.

GEARS

The material used for all gears on the Liberty engine was selected at the option of the manufacturer
from the following standard S. A. E. steels, the composition of which are given in Table 12,

TABLE 12.--COMPOSITION OF STEELS NOS. X-3,340 AND 6,140

  Steel No              X-3,340   6,140
  Carbon, minimum        0.350    0.350
  Carbon, maximum        0.450    0.450
  Manganese, minimum     0.450    0.500
  Manganese, maximum     0.750    0.800
  Phosphorus, maximum    0.040    0.040
  Sulphur, maximum       0.045    0.045
  Nickel, minimum        2.750
  Nickel, maximum        3.250
  Chromium, minimum      0.700    0.800
  Chromium, maximum      0.950    1.100
  Vanadium, minimum               0.150

All gears were heat-treated to a scleroscope hardness of from 55 to 55. The heat treatment
used to secure this hardness consisted in quenching the forgings from a temperature of 1,550
to 1,600°F. in oil and annealing for good machineability at a temperature of from 1,300 to
1,350°F. Forgings treated in this manner showed a Brinell hardness of from 177 to 217.

RATE OF COOLING

At the option of the manufacturer, the above treatment of gear forgings could be substituted
by normalizing the forgings at a temperature of from 1,550 to 1,600°F. The most important criterion
for proper normalizing, consisted in allowing the forgings to cool through the critical temperature
of the steel, at a rate not to exceed 50°F. per hour. For the two standard steels used, this
consisted in cooling from the normalizing temperature down to a temperature of 1,100°F., at
the rate indicated. Forgings normalized in this manner will show a Brinell hardness of from
177 to 217. The question has been repeatedly asked as to which treatment will produce the higher
quality finished part. In answer to this I will state that on simple forgings of comparatively
small section, the normalizing treatment will produce a finished part which is of equal quality
to that of the quenched and annealed forgings. However, in the case of complex forgings, or
those of large section, more uniform physical properties of the finished part will be obtained
by quenching and annealing the forgings in the place of normalizing.

The heat treatment of the finished gears consisted of quenching in oil from a temperature of
from 1,420 to 1,440°F. for the No. X-3,340 steel, or from a temperature of from 1,500 to 1,540°F.
for No. 6,140 steel, followed by tempering in saltpeter or in an electric furnace at a temperature
of from 650 to 700°F.

The question has been asked by many engineers, why is the comparatively low scleroscope hardness
specified for gears? The reason for this is that at best the life of an aviation engine is
short, as compared with that of an automobile, truck or tractor, and that shock resistance
is of vital importance. A sclerescope hardness of from 55 to 65 will give sufficient resistance
to wear to prevent replacements during the life of an aviation engine, while at the same time
this hardness produces approximately 50 per cent greater shock-resisting properties to the
gear. In the case of the automobile, truck or tractor, resistance to wear is the main criterion
and for that reason the higher hardness is specified.

Great care should be taken in the design of an aviation engine gear to eliminate sharp corners
at the bottom of teeth as well as in keyways. Any change of section in any stressed part of
an aviation engine must have a radius of at least 1/32 in. to give proper shock and fatigue
resistance. This fact has been demonstrated many times during the Liberty engine program.

TABLE 13.--COMPOSITION OF STEELS NOS.

The heat treatment used to secure these physical properties consisted in normalizing the forgings
at a temperature of from 1,550 to 1,600°F., followed by cooling in the furnace or in air. The
forgings were then quenched in oil from a temperature of from 1,420 to 1,440°F. for the No.
X-3,335 steel, or from a temperature of from 1,500 to 1,525°F. for No. 6,135 steel, followed
by tempering at a temperature of from 1,075 to 1,150°F. At the option of the manufacturer,
the normalizing treatment could be substituted by quenching the forgings from a temperature
of from 1,550 to 1,600°F., in oil, and annealing for the best machineability at a temperature
of from 1,300 to 1,350°F. The double quench, however, did not prove satisfactory on No. X-3,335
steel, due to the fact that it was necessary to remove forgings from the quenching bath while
still at a temperature of from 300 to 500°F. to eliminate any possibility of cracking. In view
of the fact that this practice is difficult to carry out in the average heat-treating plant,
considerable trouble was experienced.

The most important criterion in the production of aviation engine connecting rods is the elimination
of burned or severely overheated forgings. Due to the particular design of the forked rod,
considerable trouble was experienced in this respect because of the necessity of reheating
the forgings before they are completely forged. As a means of elimination of burned forgings,
test lugs were forged on the channel section as well as on the top end of fork. After the finish
heat treatment, these test lugs were nicked and broken and the fracture of the steel carefully
examined. This precaution made it possible to eliminate burned forgings as the test lugs were
placed on sections which would be most likely to become burned.

There is a great difference of opinion among engineers as to what physical properties an aviation
engine connecting rod should have. Many of the most prominent engineers contend that a connecting
rod should be as stiff as possible. To produce rods in this manner in any quantity, it is necessary
for the final heat treatment to be made on the semi-machined rod. This practice would make
it necessary for a larger percentage of the semi-machined rods to be cold-straightened after
the finish heat treatment. The cold-straightening operation on a part having important functions
to perform as a connecting rod is extremely dangerous.

In view of the fact that a connecting rod functions as a strut, it is considered that this
part should be only stiff enough to prevent any whipping action during the running of the engine.
The greater the fatigue-resisting property that one can put into the rod after this stiffness
is reached, the longer the life of the rod will be. This is the reason for the Brinell limits
mentioned being specified.

In connection with the connecting rod, emphasis must be laid on the importance of proper radii
at all changes of section. The connecting rods for the first few Liberty engines were machined
with sharp corners at the point where the connecting-rod bolt-head fits on assembly. On the
first long endurance test of a Liberty engine equipped with rods of this type, failure resulted
from fatigue starting at this point. It is interesting to note that every rod on the engine
which did not completely fail at this point had started to crack. The adoption of a 1/32-in.
radius at this point completely eliminated fatigue failures on Liberty rods.

CRANKSHAFT

The crankshaft was the most highly stressed part of the entire Liberty engine, and, therefore,
every metallurgical precaution was taken to guarantee the quality of this part.

For every increase of 4,000 lb. per square inch in the elastic limit above 116,000 lb. per
square inch, the minimum Izod impact required was reduced 1 ft.-lb.

A prolongation of not less than the diameter of the forging bearing was forged on one end of
each crankshaft. This was removed from the shaft after the finish heat treatment, and physical
tests were made on test specimens which were cut from it at a point half way between the center
and the surface. One tensile test and one impact test were made on each crankshaft, and the
results obtained were recorded against the serial number of the shaft in question. This serial
number was carried through all machining operations and stamped on the cheek of the finished
shaft. In addition to the above tensile and impact tests, at least two Brinell hardness determinations
were made on each shaft.

All straightening operations on the Liberty crankshaft which were performed below a temperature
of 500°F. were followed by retempering at a temperature of approximately 200°F. below the original
tempering temperature.
