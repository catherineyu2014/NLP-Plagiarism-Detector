March 2. A very bitter wind blowing and it was a cheerless job waiting for six hours to get
a sleep in the bag. I walked down from our tent to the hut and watched whales blowing in the
semi-darkness out in the black water of the Strait. When we turned out in the morning the pony
party was still on floating ice but not any further from the Barrier ice. By a merciful providence
the current was taking them rather along the Barrier edge, where they went adrift, instead
of straight out to sea. We could do nothing more for them, so we set to our work with the dogs.
It was blowing a bitter gale of wind from the S.E. with some drift and we made a number of
journeys backwards and forwards between the Gap and the hut, carrying our tent and camp equipment
down and preparing a permanent picketing line for the dogs. As the ice had all gone out of
the Strait we were quite cut off from any return to Cape Evans until the sea should again freeze
over, and this was not likely until the end of April. We rigged up a small fireplace in the
hut and found some wood and made a fire for an hour or so at each meal, but as there was no
coal and not much wood we felt we must be economical with the fuel, and so also with matches
and everything else, in case Bowers should lose his sledge loads, which had most of the supplies
for the whole party to last twelve men for two months. The weather had now become too thick
for us to distinguish anything in the distance and we remained in ignorance as to the party
adrift until Saturday. I had also lent my glasses to Captain Scott. This night I had first
go in the bag, and turned out to shiver for eight hours till breakfast. There was literally
nothing in the hut that one could cover oneself with to keep warm and we couldn't run to keeping
the fire going. It was very cold work. There were heaps of biscuit cases here which we had
left in Discovery days, and with these we built up a small inner hut to live in.

March 3. Spent the day in transferring dogs in couples from the Gap to the hut. In the afternoon
Teddie Evans and Atkinson turned up from over the hills, having returned from their Corner
Camp journey with one horse and two seamen, all of which they had left encamped at Castle Rock,
three miles off on the hills. They naturally expected to find Scott here and everyone else
and had heard nothing of the pony party going adrift, but having found only open water ahead
of them they turned back and came to land by Castle Rock slopes. We fed them and I walked half-way
back to Castle Rock with them.

March 4. Meares, Gran, and I walked up Ski Slope towards Castle Rock to meet Evans's party
and pilot them and the dogs safely to Hut Point, but half-way we met Atkinson, who told us
that they had now been joined by Scott and all the catastrophe party, who were safe, but who
had lost all the ponies except one--a great blow. However, no lives were lost and the sledge
loads and stores were saved, so Meares and I returned to Hut Point to make stables for the
only two ponies that now remained, both in wretched condition, of the eight with which we started.
[Dr. Wilson's Journal.]

Note 15, p. 140.--March 12. Thawed out some old magazines and picture papers which were left
here by the Discovery, and gave us very good reading. [Dr. Wilson's Journal.]

Note 16, p. 151.--April 4. Fun over a fry I made in my new penquin lard. It was quite a success
and tasted like very bad sardine oil. [Dr. Wilson's Journal.]

Note 17, p. 169.--'Voyage of the Discovery,' chap. ix. 'The question of the moment is, what
has become of our boats?' Early in the winter they were hoisted out to give more room for the
awning, and were placed in a line about one hundred yards from the ice foot on the sea ice.
The earliest gale drifted them up nearly gunwale high, and thus for two months they remained
in sight whilst we congratulated ourselves on their security. The last gale brought more snow,
and piling it in drifts at various places in the bay, chose to be specially generous with it
in the neighbourhood of our boats, so that afterwards they were found to be buried three or
four feet beneath the new surface. Although we had noted with interest the manner in which
the extra weight of snow in other places was pressing down the surface of the original ice,
and were even taking measurements of the effects thus produced, we remained fatuously blind
to the risks our boats ran under such conditions. It was from no feeling of anxiety, but rather
to provide occupation, that I directed that the snow on top of them should be removed, and
it was not until we had dug down to the first boat that the true state of affairs dawned on
us. She was found lying in a mass of slushy ice, with which also she was nearly filled. For
the moment we had a wild hope that she could be pulled up, but by the time we could rig shears
the air temperature had converted the slush into hardened ice, and she was found to be stuck
fast. At present there is no hope of recovering any of the boats: as fast as one could dig
out the sodden ice, more sea-water would flow in and freeze ... The danger is that fresh gales
bringing more snow will sink them so far beneath the surface that we shall be unable to recover
them at all. Stuck solid in the floe they must go down with it, and every effort must be devoted
to preventing the floe from sinking. As regards the rope, it is a familiar experience that
dark objects which absorb heat will melt their way through the snow or ice on which they lie.

Note 19, p. 215.--These hints on Polar Surveying fell on willing ears. Members of the afterguard
who were not mathematically trained plunged into the very practical study of how to work out
observations. Writing home on October 26, 1911, Scott remarks:

'"Cherry" has just come to me with a very anxious face to say that I must not count on his
navigating powers. For the moment I didn't know what he was driving at, but then I remembered
that some months ago I said that it would be a good thing for all the officers going South
to have some knowledge of navigation so that in emergency they would know how to steer a sledge
home. It appears that "Cherry" thereupon commenced aserious and arduous course of study of
abstruse navigational problems which he found exceedingly tough and now despaired mastering.
Of course there is not one chance in a hundred that he will ever have to consider navigation
on our journey and in that one chance the problem must be of the simplest nature, but it makes
matters much easier for me to have men who take the details of one's work so seriously and
who strive so simply and honestly to make it successful.'

And in Wilson's diary for October 23 comes the entry: 'Working at latitude sights--mathematics
which I hate--till bedtime. It will be wiser to know a little navigation on the Southern sledge
journey.'

Note 20, p. 300.--Happily I had a biscuit with me and I held it out to him a long way off.
Luckily he spotted it and allowed me to come up, and I got hold of his head again. [Dr. Wilson's
Journal.]

Note 21, p. 338.--December 8. I have left Nobby all my biscuits to-night as he is to try and
do a march to-morrow, and then happily he will be shot and all of them, as their food is quite
done.

December 9. Nobby had all my biscuits last night and this morning, and by the time we camped
I was just ravenously hungry. It was a close cloudy day with no air and we were ploughing along
knee deep.... Thank God the horses are now all done with and we begin the heavy work ourselves.
[Dr. Wilson's Journal.]

Note 22, p. 339.--December 9. The end of the Beardmore Glacier curved across the track of the
Southern Party, thrusting itself into the mass of the Barrier with vast pressure and disturbance.
So far did this ice disturbance extend, that if the travellers had taken a bee-line to the
foot of the glacier itself, they must have begun to steer outwards 200 miles sooner.

The Gateway was a neck or saddle of drifted snow lying in a gap of the mountain rampart which
flanked the last curve of the glacier. Under the cliffs on either hand, like a moat beneath
the ramparts, lay a yawning ice-cleft or bergschrund, formed by the drawing away of the steadily
moving Barrier ice from the rocks. Across this moat and leading up to the gap in the ramparts,
the Gateway provided a solid causeway. To climb this and descend its reverse face gave the
easiest access to the surface of the glacier.

Note 23, p. 359.--Return of first Southern Party from Lat. 85° 72 S. top of the Beardmore Glacier.

Party: E. L. Atkinson, A. Cherry-Garrard, C. S. Wright, Petty Officer Keohane.

On the morning of December 22, 1911, we made a late start after saying good-bye to the eight
going on, and wishing them all good luck and success. The first 11 miles was on the down-grade
over the ice-falls, and at a good pace we completed this in about four hours. Lunched, and
on, completing nearly 23 miles for the first day. At the end of the second day we got among
very bad crevasses through keeping too far to the eastward. This delayed us slightly and we
made the depot on the third day. We reached the Lower Glacier Depot three and a half days after.
The lower part of the glacier was very badly crevassed. These crevasses we had never seen on
the way up, as they had been covered with three to four feet of snow. All the bridges of crevasses
were concave and very wide; no doubt their normal summer condition. On Christmas Day we made
in to the lateral moraine of the Cloudmaker and collected geological specimens. The march across
the Barrier was only remarkable for the extremely bad lights we had. For eight consecutive
days we only saw an exceedingly dim sun during three hours. Up to One Ton Depot our marches
had averaged 14.1 geographical miles a day. We arrived at Cape Evans on January 28, 1912, after
being away for three months. [E.L.A.]

Note 24, p. 364.--January 3. Return of the second supporting party.

Under average conditions, the return party should have well fulfilled Scott's cheery anticipations.
Three-man teams had done excellently on previous sledging expeditions, whether in Discovery
days or as recently as the mid-winter visit to the Emperor penguins' rookery; and the three
in this party were seasoned travellers with a skilled navigator to lead them. But a blizzard
held them up for three days before reaching the head of the glacier. They had to press on at
speed. By the time they reached the foot of the glacier, Lieut. Evans developed symptoms of
scurvy. His spring work of surveying and sledging out to Corner Camp and the man-hauling, with
Lashly, across the Barrier after the breakdown of the motors, had been successfully accomplished;
this sequel to the Glacier and Summit marches was an unexpected blow. Withal, he continued
to pull, while bearing the heavy strain of guiding the course. While the hauling power thus
grew less, the leader had to make up for loss of speed by lengthening the working hours. He
put his watch on an hour. With the 'turning out' signal thus advanced, the actual marching
period reached 12 hours. The situation was saved, and Evans flattered himself on his ingenuity.
But the men knew it all the time, and no word said!

At One Ton Camp he was unable to stand without the support of his ski sticks; but with the
help of his companions struggled on another 53 miles in four days. Then he could go no farther.
His companions, rejecting his suggestion that he be left in his sleeping-bag with a supply
of provisions while they pressed on for help, 'cached' everything that could be spared, and
pulled him on the sledge with a devotion matching that of their captain years before, when
he and Wilson brought their companion Shackleton, ill and helpless, safely home to the Discovery.
Four days of this pulling, with a southerly wind to help, brought them to Corner Camp; then
came a heavy snowfall: the sledge could not travel. It was a critical moment. Next day Crean
set out to tramp alone to Hut Point, 34 miles away. Lashly stayed to nurse Lieut. Evans, and
most certainly saved his life till help came. Crean reached Hut Point after an exhausting march
of 18 hours; how the dog-team went to the rescue is told by Dr. Atkinson in the second volume.
At the Discovery hut Evans was unremittingly tended by Dr. Atkinson, and finally sent by sledge
to the Terra Nova. It is good to record that both Lashly and Crean have received the Albert medal.

Note 25, p. 396.--At this point begins the last of Scott's notebooks. The record of the Southern
Journey is written in pencil in three slim MS. books, some 8 inches long by 5 wide. These little
volumes are meant for artists' notebooks, and are made of tough, soft, pliable paper which
takes the pencil well. The pages, 96 in number, are perforated so as to be detachable at need.

In the Hut, large quarto MS. books were used for the journals, and some of the rough notes
of the earlier expeditions were recast and written out again in them; the little books were
carried on the sledge journeys, and contain the day's notes entered very regularly at the lunch
halts and in the night camps. But in the last weeks of the Southern Journey, when fuel and
light ran short and all grew very weary, it will be seen that Scott made his entries at lunch
time alone. They tell not of the morning's run only, but of 'yesterday.'

The notes were written on the right-hand pages, and when the end of the book was reached, it
was 'turned' and the blank backs of the leaves now became clean right-hand pages. The first
two MS. books are thus entirely filled: the third has only part of its pages used and the Message
to the Public is written at the reverse end.

Inside the front cover of No. 1 is a 'ready' table to convert the day's run of geographical
miles as recorded on the sledgemeter into statute miles, a list of the depots and their latitude,
and a note of the sledgemeter reading at Corner Camp.

These are followed in the first pages by a list of the outward camps and distances run as noted
in the book, with special 'remarks' as to cairns, latitude, and so forth. At the end of the
book is a full list of the cairns that marked the track out.

Inside the front cover of No. 2 are similar entries, together with the ages of the Polar party
and a note of the error of Scott's watch.

Inside the front cover of No. 3 are the following words: 'Diary can be read by finder to ensure
recording of Records, &c., but Diary should be sent to my widow.' And on the first page:

                        'Send this diary to my widow.

                                        'R. SCOTT.'

The word 'wife' had been struck out and 'widow' written in.

Note 26, p. 398.--At this, the barrier stage of the return journey, the Southern Party were
in want of more oil than they found at the depots. Owing partly to the severe conditions, but
still more to the delays imposed by their sick comrades, they reached the full limit of time
allowed for between depots. The cold was unexpected, and at the same time the actual amount
of oil found at the depots was less than they had counted on.

Under summer conditions, such as were contemplated, when there was less cold for the men to
endure, and less firing needed to melt the snow for cooking, the fullest allowance of oil was
1 gallon to last a unit of four men ten days, or 1/40 of a gallon a day for each man.

The amount allotted to each unit for the return journey from the South was apparently rather
less, being 2/3 gallon for eight days, or 1/48 gallon a day for each man. But the eight days
were to cover the march from depot to depot, averaging on the Barrier some 70-80 miles, which
in normal conditions should not take more than six days. Thus there was a substantial margin
for delay by bad weather, while if all went well the surplus afforded the fullest marching
allowance.

The same proportion for a unit of five men works out at 5/6 of a gallon for the eight-day stage.

Accordingly, for the return of the two supporting parties and the Southern Party, two tins
of a gallon each were left at each depot, each unit of four men being entitled to 2/3 of a
gallon, and the units of three and five men in proportion.

The return journey on the Summit had been made at good speed, taking twenty-one days as against
twenty-seven going out, the last part of it, from Three Degree to Upper Glacier Depot, taking
nearly eight marches as against ten, showing the first slight slackening as P.O. Evans and
Oates began to feel the cold; from Upper Glacier to Lower Glacier Depot ten marches as against
eleven, a stage broken by the Mid Glacier Depot of three and a half day's provisions at the
sixth march. Here, there was little gain, partly owing to the conditions, but more to Evans'
gradual collapse.

The worst time came on the Barrier; from Lower Glacier to Southern Barrier Depot (51 miles),
6 1/2 marches as against 5 (two of which were short marches, so that the 5 might count as an
easy 4 in point of distance);from Southern Barrier to Mid Barrier Depot (82 miles), 6 1/2 marches
as against 5 1/2; from Mid Barrier to Mt. Hooper (70 miles), 8 as against 4 3/4, while the
last remaining 8 marches represent but 4 on the outward journey. (See table on next page.)
