At the unveiling of the statue to its founder by the S.I.D.R.I. (Society for Insisting on the
Divine Right of Iconoclasts) it is understood that several conversions were effected through
the conduct of a band of youthful enthusiasts who, faithful to their principles and unable
to restrain their zeal for the cause, rushed at the newly-revealed masterpiece and smashed
it to atoms.

The S.F.S. (Society for the Formation of Societies) and the S.F.S.F.S. (Society for the Formation
of Societies for the Formation of Societies) are both doing splendid work.

THE SMILE OF THE SEA-KINGS.

(A reflection on the recent Amateur Golf Championship at Sandwich suggested by a study of the
illustrated papers.)

 They swung with the accurate grace of the clockwork at Greenwich;
   Their brassies unswervingly held to the line of the pegs;
 Their chip-shots came down on the greens and mistook them for spinach,
     And stopped like poached eggs;
     Not theirs the desire for the sandpit, not theirs the inadequate legs.

 Or if over they failed to lie moribund, dauntless the heroes
     Stooped down to impossible putts for a half or a win,
 Stooped down in voluminous knickers and all sorts of queer hose
     And stuffed the ball in,
     Like American packers of pig-meat, hard home to the floor of the tin.

 These things I admired; but I wondered still more when the mighty,
     The mystical thumpers of pills by the marge of the spray,
 Having somehow offended Poseidon or else Aphrodite,
     Got chucked from the fray,
     Passed forth till they left Mr. JENKINS sole lord of the hazardous
       bay.

 When the ultimate putt was holed out in each notable duel
     How grandly they took it, remarking "I think (or I guess)
 That the right man has conquered," not shouting that Fortune was cruel,
     Not murmuring, "Bless!"
     What a glory illumined their features when snapped by the popular
         Press!

 Full glad is the face of the earth when the vineyards are laden;
     Loud laughs with innumerous laughter in wreath upon wreath
 The ocean at Blackpool or Margate; most blithely the maiden
     Unfastens the sheath
     Of her mouth like the bloom of a musk rose, when Fangol has furbished
         her teeth;

 So fair was the smile of the sea-kings; so sweet was the look on
     The faces of HEZLET and OUIMET and most of their peers
 When they passed from the contest, a smile with a sort of a hook on,
     Unclouded with tears;
     It went slap through their cheeks down the fair-way and bunkered
         itself by their ears.

 And if e'er in the future, cast down from the promise of Heaven,
     Half-stymied by William, I grumble and groan at my fate
 When he captures the hole (and the game) with a pretty bad 7,
     Whilst my score is 8,
     And I bubble with impotent anger, I seethe with tumultuous hate.

 Let me think of my album of photos, whose title is "After,"
     All cut from the dailies; it gives you most wonderful tips
 For producing without any pressure the right kind of laughter;
     It gives you the grips
     And the stance of the teeth of the plus men, and how to get length
         from the lips.

  EVOE.

Illustration: A HOLIDAY TASK.

PRIME AND WAR MINISTER. "AFRAID I'VE LET YOU IN FOR RATHER AN AWKWARD JOB WITH THIS AMENDING BILL."

LORD CREWE. "MY DEAR FELLOW, YOU'RE SO VERSATILE--WHY NOT SPEND THE REST OF THE RECESS MAKING
YOURSELF A BARON OR A BISHOP? THEN YOU COULD TAKE IT ON INSTEAD OF ME." It is a farce, and
I think a contemptible farce."

Thus BONNER LAW--the farce being the Third Reading of the Home Rule Bill.

The curtain had risen on a thronged and excited House. Were it the custom at the T. R. Westminster
to put out notice-boards one might have borne the legend dear to the heart of the manager,
"Standing room Only." Even late-comers among the peers were fain to stand by the doorway opening
on the Gallery, where earlier birds had found twigs on which to sit. Overflow of Commoners
into the side galleries gave the last touch to stirring scene presented but twice or thrice
in history of a Session.

Ordered business of sitting was the stage of the measure alluded to in phrase quoted from LEADER
OF OPPOSITION. But, as was testified anew last Thursday, business in House of Commons does
not always run through expected courses. In strained temper of the hour anything might happen,
even a bout of fisticuffs. What actually did happen was that within space of hour and a-half
from SPEAKER'S taking the Chair, a period including the ordinary Question-hour, Home Rule Bill
was read a third time and carried over to House of Lords through cheering crowd waiting in
Central Lobby.

SPEAKER introduced soothing note by frank confession that, when on Thursday he invited LEADER
OF OPPOSITION to state whether he approved the outburst of disorder among his followers which
prevented their authorised spokesman being heard, he "was betrayed into an expression he ought
not to have used." BONNER LAW "gratefully accepted the explanation," and eloquently extolled
the character of the SPEAKER.

SPEAKER invited PREMIER to yield to insistent demand of Opposition and give further particulars
with regard to the Amending Bill. The PREMIER, always ready to oblige, responded in a few luminous,
courteous sentences, which did not add a syllable of information beyond what had been reiterated
in previous references to subject. It was then that BONNER LAW, with rare dramatic gesture,
gave the command, "Ring down the curtain!" "It is the end of the Act, but not of the play,"
he added amid loud cheers from host behind him, reinforced this afternoon by arrival of recruits
from North-East Derbyshire and Ipswich. "The final Act in the drama will be played not in the
House of Commons, but in the country, and there, Sir, it will not be a farce."
