CHAPTER I.

A PRACTICAL JOKE.

On a cloudy December morning a gentleman, two ladies, and a boy stepped down from the express
train at a station just above the Highlands on the Hudson. A double sleigh, overflowing with
luxurious robes, stood near, and a portly coachman with difficulty restrained his spirited
horses while the little party arranged themselves for a winter ride.  Both the ladies were
young, and the gentleman's anxious and almost tender solicitude for one of them seemed hardly
warranted by her blooming cheeks and sprightly movements.  A close observer might soon suspect
that his assiduous attentions  were caused by a malady of his own rather than by indisposition
on her part.

The other young lady received but scant politeness, though seemingly in greater need of it.
But the words of Scripture applied to her beautiful companion, "Whosoever hath, to him shall
be given, and he shall have more abundance." She had been surfeited all her life with attention,
and though she would certainly have felt its absence, as she would the loss of wealth, life-long
familiarity with both led her to place no special value upon them.

Therefore during the half-hour's ride her spirits rose with the rapid motion, and even the
leaden sky and winter's bleakness could not prevent the shifting landscape from being a source
of pleasure to her city eyes, while the devotion  of her admirer or lover was received as a
matter of course.

The frosty air brought color into her companion's usually pale face, but not of an attractive
kind, for the north-east wind that deepened the vermilion in the beauty's cheek could only
tinge that of the other with a ghastly blue. The delicate creature shivered and sighed.

"I wish we were there."

"Really, Bel, I sometimes think your veins are filled with water instead of blood. It's not
cold to-day, is it, Mr. De Forrest?"

"Well, all I can say with certainty," he replied, "is that I have been in a glow for the last
two hours. I thought it was chilly before that."
