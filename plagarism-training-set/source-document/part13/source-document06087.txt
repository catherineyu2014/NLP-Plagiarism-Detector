The same summer and simultaneously with the expedition against Plataea, the Athenians marched
with two thousand heavy infantry and two hundred horse against the Chalcidians in the direction
of Thrace and the Bottiaeans, just as the corn was getting ripe, under the command of Xenophon,
son of Euripides, with two colleagues. Arriving before Spartolus in Bottiaea, they destroyed
the corn and had some hopes of the city coming over through the intrigues of a faction within.
But those of a different way of thinking had sent to Olynthus; and a garrison of heavy infantry
and other troops arrived accordingly. These issuing from Spartolus were engaged by the Athenians
in front of the town: the Chalcidian heavy infantry, and some auxiliaries with them, were beaten
and retreated into Spartolus; but the Chalcidian horse and light troops defeated the horse
and light troops of the Athenians. The Chalcidians had already a few targeteers from Crusis,
and presently after the battle were joined by some others from Olynthus; upon seeing whom the
light troops from Spartolus, emboldened by this accession and by their previous success, with
the help of the Chalcidian horse and the reinforcement just arrived again attacked the Athenians,
who retired upon the two divisions which they had left with their baggage. Whenever the Athenians
advanced, their adversary gave way, pressing them with missiles the instant they began to retire.
The Chalcidian horse also, riding up and charging them just as they pleased, at last caused
a panic amongst them and routed and pursued them to a great distance. The Athenians took refuge
in Potidaea, and afterwards recovered their dead under truce, and returned to Athens with the
remnant of their army; four hundred and thirty men and all the generals having fallen. The
Chalcidians and Bottiaeans set up a trophy, took up their dead, and dispersed to their several
cities.

The same summer, not long after this, the Ambraciots and Chaonians, being desirous of reducing
the whole of Acarnania and detaching it from Athens, persuaded the Lacedaemonians to equip
a fleet from their confederacy and send a thousand heavy infantry to Acarnania, representing
that, if a combined movement were made by land and sea, the coast Acarnanians would be unable
to march, and the conquest of Zacynthus and Cephallenia easily following on the possession
of Acarnania, the cruise round Peloponnese would be no longer so convenient for the Athenians.
Besides which there was a hope of taking Naupactus. The Lacedaemonians accordingly at once
sent off a few vessels with Cnemus, who was still high admiral, and the heavy infantry on board;
and sent round orders for the fleet to equip as quickly as possible and sail to Leucas. The
Corinthians were the most forward in the business; the Ambraciots being a colony of theirs.
While the ships from Corinth, Sicyon, and the neighbourhood were getting ready, and those from
Leucas, Anactorium, and Ambracia, which had arrived before, were waiting for them at Leucas,
Cnemus and his thousand heavy infantry had run into the gulf, giving the slip to Phormio, the
commander of the Athenian squadron stationed off Naupactus, and began at once to prepare for
the land expedition. The Hellenic troops with him consisted of the Ambraciots, Leucadians,
and Anactorians, and the thousand Peloponnesians with whom he came; the barbarian of a thousand
Chaonians, who, belonging to a nation that has no king, were led by Photys and Nicanor, the
two members of the royal family to whom the chieftainship for that year had been confided.
With the Chaonians came also some Thesprotians, like them without a king, some Molossians and
Atintanians led by Sabylinthus, the guardian of King Tharyps who was still a minor, and some
Paravaeans, under their king Oroedus, accompanied by a thousand Orestians, subjects of King
Antichus and placed by him under the command of Oroedus. There were also a thousand Macedonians
sent by Perdiccas without the knowledge of the Athenians, but they arrived too late. With this
force Cnemus set out, without waiting for the fleet from Corinth. Passing through the territory
of Amphilochian Argos, and sacking the open village of Limnaea, they advanced to Stratus the
Acarnanian capital; this once taken, the rest of the country, they felt convinced, would speedily
follow.

The Acarnanians, finding themselves invaded by a large army by land, and from the sea threatened
by a hostile fleet, made no combined attempt at resistance, but remained to defend their homes,
and sent for help to Phormio, who replied that, when a fleet was on the point of sailing from
Corinth, it was impossible for him to leave Naupactus unprotected. The Peloponnesians meanwhile
and their allies advanced upon Stratus in three divisions, with the intention of encamping
near it and attempting the wall by force if they failed to succeed by negotiation. The order
of march was as follows: the centre was occupied by the Chaonians and the rest of the barbarians,
with the Leucadians and Anactorians and their followers on the right, and Cnemus with the Peloponnesians
and Ambraciots on the left; each division being a long way off from, and sometimes even out
of sight of, the others. The Hellenes advanced in good order, keeping a look-out till they
encamped in a good position; but the Chaonians, filled with self-confidence, and having the
highest character for courage among the tribes of that part of the continent, without waiting
to occupy their camp, rushed on with the rest of the barbarians, in the idea that they should
take the town by assault and obtain the sole glory of the enterprise. While they were coming
on, the Stratians, becoming aware how things stood, and thinking that the defeat of this division
would considerably dishearten the Hellenes behind it, occupied the environs of the town with
ambuscades, and as soon as they approached engaged them at close quarters from the city and
the ambuscades. A panic seizing the Chaonians, great numbers of them were slain; and as soon
as they were seen to give way the rest of the barbarians turned and fled. Owing to the distance
by which their allies had preceded them, neither of the Hellenic divisions knew anything of
the battle, but fancied they were hastening on to encamp. However, when the flying barbarians
broke in upon them, they opened their ranks to receive them, brought their divisions together,
and stopped quiet where they were for the day; the Stratians not offering to engage them, as
the rest of the Acarnanians had not yet arrived, but contenting themselves with slinging at
them from a distance, which distressed them greatly, as there was no stirring without their
armour. The Acarnanians would seem to excel in this mode of warfare.

As soon as night fell, Cnemus hastily drew off his army to the river Anapus, about nine miles
from Stratus, recovering his dead next day under truce, and being there joined by the friendly
Oeniadae, fell back upon their city before the enemy's reinforcements came up. From hence each
returned home; and the Stratians set up a trophy for the battle with the barbarians.

Meanwhile the fleet from Corinth and the rest of the confederates in the Crissaean Gulf, which
was to have co-operated with Cnemus and prevented the coast Acarnanians from joining their
countrymen in the interior, was disabled from doing so by being compelled about the same time
as the battle at Stratus to fight with Phormio and the twenty Athenian vessels stationed at
Naupactus. For they were watched, as they coasted along out of the gulf, by Phormio, who wished
to attack in the open sea. But the Corinthians and allies had started for Acarnania without
any idea of fighting at sea, and with vessels more like transports for carrying soldiers; besides
which, they never dreamed of the twenty Athenian ships venturing to engage their forty-seven.
However, while they were coasting along their own shore, there were the Athenians sailing along
in line with them; and when they tried to cross over from Patrae in Achaea to the mainland
on the other side, on their way to Acarnania, they saw them again coming out from Chalcis and
the river Evenus to meet them. They slipped from their moorings in the night, but were observed,
and were at length compelled to fight in mid passage. Each state that contributed to the armament
had its own general; the Corinthian commanders were Machaon, Isocrates, and Agatharchidas.
The Peloponnesians ranged their vessels in as large a circle as possible without leaving an
opening, with the prows outside and the sterns in; and placed within all the small craft in
company, and their five best sailers to issue out at a moment's notice and strengthen any point
threatened by the enemy.

The Athenians, formed in line, sailed round and round them, and forced them to contract their
circle, by continually brushing past and making as though they would attack at once, having
been previously cautioned by Phormio not to do so till he gave the signal. His hope was that
the Peloponnesians would not retain their order like a force on shore, but that the ships would
fall foul of one another and the small craft cause confusion; and if the wind should blow from
the gulf (in expectation of which he kept sailing round them, and which usually rose towards
morning), they would not, he felt sure, remain steady an instant. He also thought that it rested
with him to attack when he pleased, as his ships were better sailers, and that an attack timed
by the coming of the wind would tell best. When the wind came down, the enemy's ships were
now in a narrow space, and what with the wind and the small craft dashing against them, at
once fell into confusion: ship fell foul of ship, while the crews were pushing them off with
poles, and by their shouting, swearing, and struggling with one another, made captains' orders
and boatswains' cries alike inaudible, and through being unable for want of practice to clear
their oars in the rough water, prevented the vessels from obeying their helmsmen properly.
At this moment Phormio gave the signal, and the Athenians attacked. Sinking first one of the
admirals, they then disabled all they came across, so that no one thought of resistance for
the confusion, but fled for Patrae and Dyme in Achaea. The Athenians gave chase and captured
twelve ships, and taking most of the men out of them sailed to Molycrium, and after setting
up a trophy on the promontory of Rhium and dedicating a ship to Poseidon, returned to Naupactus.
As for the Peloponnesians, they at once sailed with their remaining ships along the coast from
Dyme and Patrae to Cyllene, the Eleian arsenal; where Cnemus, and the ships from Leucas that
were to have joined them, also arrived after the battle at Stratus.

The Lacedaemonians now sent to the fleet to Cnemus three commissioners--Timocrates, Bradidas,
and Lycophron--with orders to prepare to engage again with better fortune, and not to be driven
from the sea by a few vessels; for they could not at all account for their discomfiture, the
less so as it was their first attempt at sea; and they fancied that it was not that their marine
was so inferior, but that there had been misconduct somewhere, not considering the long experience
of the Athenians as compared with the little practice which they had had themselves. The commissioners
were accordingly sent in anger. As soon as they arrived they set to work with Cnemus to order
ships from the different states, and to put those which they already had in fighting order.
Meanwhile Phormio sent word to Athens of their preparations and his own victory, and desired
as many ships as possible to be speedily sent to him, as he stood in daily expectation of a
battle. Twenty were accordingly sent, but instructions were given to their commander to go
first to Crete. For Nicias, a Cretan of Gortys, who was proxenus of the Athenians, had persuaded
them to sail against Cydonia, promising to procure the reduction of that hostile town; his
real wish being to oblige the Polichnitans, neighbours of the Cydonians. He accordingly went
with the ships to Crete, and, accompanied by the Polichnitans, laid waste the lands of the
Cydonians; and, what with adverse winds and stress of weather wasted no little time there.

While the Athenians were thus detained in Crete, the Peloponnesians in Cyllene got ready for
battle, and coasted along to Panormus in Achaea, where their land army had come to support
them. Phormio also coasted along to Molycrian Rhium, and anchored outside it with twenty ships,
the same as he had fought with before. This Rhium was friendly to the Athenians. The other,
in Peloponnese, lies opposite to it; the sea between them is about three-quarters of a mile
broad, and forms the mouth of the Crissaean gulf. At this, the Achaean Rhium, not far off Panormus,
where their army lay, the Peloponnesians now cast anchor with seventy-seven ships, when they
saw the Athenians do so. For six or seven days they remained opposite each other, practising
and preparing for the battle; the one resolved not to sail out of the Rhia into the open sea,
for fear of the disaster which had already happened to them, the other not to sail into the
straits, thinking it advantageous to the enemy, to fight in the narrows. At last Cnemus and
Brasidas and the rest of the Peloponnesian commanders, being desirous of bringing on a battle
as soon as possible, before reinforcements should arrive from Athens, and noticing that the
men were most of them cowed by the previous defeat and out of heart for the business, first
called them together and encouraged them as follows:

"Peloponnesians, the late engagement, which may have made some of you afraid of the one now
in prospect, really gives no just ground for apprehension. Preparation for it, as you know,
there was little enough; and the object of our voyage was not so much to fight at sea as an
expedition by land. Besides this, the chances of war were largely against us; and perhaps also
inexperience had something to do with our failure in our first naval action. It was not, therefore,
cowardice that produced our defeat, nor ought the determination which force has not quelled,
but which still has a word to say with its adversary, to lose its edge from the result of an
accident; but admitting the possibility of a chance miscarriage, we should know that brave
hearts must be always brave, and while they remain so can never put forward inexperience as
an excuse for misconduct. Nor are you so behind the enemy in experience as you are ahead of
him in courage; and although the science of your opponents would, if valour accompanied it,
have also the presence of mind to carry out at in emergency the lesson it has learnt, yet a
faint heart will make all art powerless in the face of danger. For fear takes away presence
of mind, and without valour art is useless. Against their superior experience set your superior
daring, and against the fear induced by defeat the fact of your having been then unprepared;
remember, too, that you have always the advantage of superior numbers, and of engaging off
your own coast, supported by your heavy infantry; and as a rule, numbers and equipment give
victory. At no point, therefore, is defeat likely; and as for our previous mistakes, the very
fact of their occurrence will teach us better for the future. Steersmen and sailors may, therefore,
confidently attend to their several duties, none quitting the station assigned to them: as
for ourselves, we promise to prepare for the engagement at least as well as your previous commanders,
and to give no excuse for any one misconducting himself. Should any insist on doing so, he
shall meet with the punishment he deserves, while the brave shall be honoured with the appropriate
rewards of valour."

The Peloponnesian commanders encouraged their men after this fashion. Phormio, meanwhile, being
himself not without fears for the courage of his men, and noticing that they were forming in
groups among themselves and were alarmed at the odds against them, desired to call them together
and give them confidence and counsel in the present emergency. He had before continually told
them, and had accustomed their minds to the idea, that there was no numerical superiority that
they could not face; and the men themselves had long been persuaded that Athenians need never
retire before any quantity of Peloponnesian vessels. At the moment, however, he saw that they
were dispirited by the sight before them, and wishing to refresh their confidence, called them
together and spoke as follows:

"I see, my men, that you are frightened by the number of the enemy, and I have accordingly
called you together, not liking you to be afraid of what is not really terrible. In the first
place, the Peloponnesians, already defeated, and not even themselves thinking that they are
a match for us, have not ventured to meet us on equal terms, but have equipped this multitude
of ships against us. Next, as to that upon which they most rely, the courage which they suppose
constitutional to them, their confidence here only arises from the success which their experience
in land service usually gives them, and which they fancy will do the same for them at sea.
But this advantage will in all justice belong to us on this element, if to them on that; as
they are not superior to us in courage, but we are each of us more confident, according to
our experience in our particular department. Besides, as the Lacedaemonians use their supremacy
over their allies to promote their own glory, they are most of them being brought into danger
against their will, or they would never, after such a decided defeat, have ventured upon a
fresh engagement. You need not, therefore, be afraid of their dash. You, on the contrary, inspire
a much greater and better founded alarm, both because of your late victory and also of their
belief that we should not face them unless about to do something worthy of a success so signal.
An adversary numerically superior, like the one before us, comes into action trusting more
to strength than to resolution; while he who voluntarily confronts tremendous odds must have
very great internal resources to draw upon. For these reasons the Peloponnesians fear our irrational
audacity more than they would ever have done a more commensurate preparation. Besides, many
armaments have before now succumbed to an inferior through want of skill or sometimes of courage;
neither of which defects certainly are ours. As to the battle, it shall not be, if I can help
it, in the strait, nor will I sail in there at all; seeing that in a contest between a number
of clumsily managed vessels and a small, fast, well-handled squadron, want of sea room is an
undoubted disadvantage. One cannot run down an enemy properly without having a sight of him
a good way off, nor can one retire at need when pressed; one can neither break the line nor
return upon his rear, the proper tactics for a fast sailer; but the naval action necessarily
becomes a land one, in which numbers must decide the matter. For all this I will provide as
far as can be. Do you stay at your posts by your ships, and be sharp at catching the word of
command, the more so as we are observing one another from so short a distance; and in action
think order and silence all-important--qualities useful in war generally, and in naval engagements
in particular; and behave before the enemy in a manner worthy of your past exploits. The issues
you will fight for are great--to destroy the naval hopes of the Peloponnesians or to bring
nearer to the Athenians their fears for the sea. And I may once more remind you that you have
defeated most of them already; and beaten men do not face a danger twice with the same determination."

Such was the exhortation of Phormio. The Peloponnesians finding that the Athenians did not
sail into the gulf and the narrows, in order to lead them in whether they wished it or not,
put out at dawn, and forming four abreast, sailed inside the gulf in the direction of their
own country, the right wing leading as they had lain at anchor. In this wing were placed twenty
of their best sailers; so that in the event of Phormio thinking that their object was Naupactus,
and coasting along thither to save the place, the Athenians might not be able to escape their
onset by getting outside their wing, but might be cut off by the vessels in question. As they
expected, Phormio, in alarm for the place at that moment emptied of its garrison, as soon as
he saw them put out, reluctantly and hurriedly embarked and sailed along shore; the Messenian
land forces moving along also to support him. The Peloponnesians seeing him coasting along
with his ships in single file, and by this inside the gulf and close inshore as they so much
wished, at one signal tacked suddenly and bore down in line at their best speed on the Athenians,
hoping to cut off the whole squadron. The eleven leading vessels, however, escaped the Peloponnesian
wing and its sudden movement, and reached the more open water; but the rest were overtaken
as they tried to run through, driven ashore and disabled; such of the crews being slain as
had not swum out of them. Some of the ships the Peloponnesians lashed to their own, and towed
off empty; one they took with the men in it; others were just being towed off, when they were
saved by the Messenians dashing into the sea with their armour and fighting from the decks
that they had boarded.

Thus far victory was with the Peloponnesians, and the Athenian fleet destroyed; the twenty
ships in the right wing being meanwhile in chase of the eleven Athenian vessels that had escaped
their sudden movement and reached the more open water. These, with the exception of one ship,
all outsailed them and got safe into Naupactus, and forming close inshore opposite the temple
of Apollo, with their prows facing the enemy, prepared to defend themselves in case the Peloponnesians
should sail inshore against them. After a while the Peloponnesians came up, chanting the paean
for their victory as they sailed on; the single Athenian ship remaining being chased by a Leucadian
far ahead of the rest. But there happened to be a merchantman lying at anchor in the roadstead,
which the Athenian ship found time to sail round, and struck the Leucadian in chase amidships
and sank her. An exploit so sudden and unexpected produced a panic among the Peloponnesians;
and having fallen out of order in the excitement of victory, some of them dropped their oars
and stopped their way in order to let the main body come up--an unsafe thing to do considering
how near they were to the enemy's prows; while others ran aground in the shallows, in their
ignorance of the localities.

Elated at this incident, the Athenians at one word gave a cheer, and dashed at the enemy, who,
embarrassed by his mistakes and the disorder in which he found himself, only stood for an instant,
and then fled for Panormus, whence he had put out. The Athenians following on his heels took
the six vessels nearest them, and recovered those of their own which had been disabled close
inshore and taken in tow at the beginning of the action; they killed some of the crews and
took some prisoners. On board the Leucadian which went down off the merchantman, was the Lacedaemonian
Timocrates, who killed himself when the ship was sunk, and was cast up in the harbour of Naupactus.
The Athenians on their return set up a trophy on the spot from which they had put out and turned
the day, and picking up the wrecks and dead that were on their shore, gave back to the enemy
their dead under truce. The Peloponnesians also set up a trophy as victors for the defeat inflicted
upon the ships they had disabled in shore, and dedicated the vessel which they had taken at
Achaean Rhium, side by side with the trophy. After this, apprehensive of the reinforcement
expected from Athens, all except the Leucadians sailed into the Crissaean Gulf for Corinth.
Not long after their retreat, the twenty Athenian ships, which were to have joined Phormio
before the battle, arrived at Naupactus.

Thus the summer ended. Winter was now at hand; but dispersing the fleet, which had retired
to Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf, Cnemus, Brasidas, and the other Peloponnesian captains allowed
themselves to be persuaded by the Megarians to make an attempt upon Piraeus, the port of Athens,
which from her decided superiority at sea had been naturally left unguarded and open. Their
plan was as follows: The men were each to take their oar, cushion, and rowlock thong, and,
going overland from Corinth to the sea on the Athenian side, to get to Megara as quickly as
they could, and launching forty vessels, which happened to be in the docks at Nisaea, to sail
at once to Piraeus. There was no fleet on the look-out in the harbour, and no one had the least
idea of the enemy attempting a surprise; while an open attack would, it was thought, never
be deliberately ventured on, or, if in contemplation, would be speedily known at Athens. Their
plan formed, the next step was to put it in execution. Arriving by night and launching the
vessels from Nisaea, they sailed, not to Piraeus as they had originally intended, being afraid
of the risk, besides which there was some talk of a wind having stopped them, but to the point
of Salamis that looks towards Megara; where there was a fort and a squadron of three ships
to prevent anything sailing in or out of Megara. This fort they assaulted, and towed off the
galleys empty, and surprising the inhabitants began to lay waste the rest of the island.

Meanwhile fire signals were raised to alarm Athens, and a panic ensued there as serious as
any that occurred during the war. The idea in the city was that the enemy had already sailed
into Piraeus: in Piraeus it was thought that they had taken Salamis and might at any moment
arrive in the port; as indeed might easily have been done if their hearts had been a little
firmer: certainly no wind would have prevented them. As soon as day broke, the Athenians assembled
in full force, launched their ships, and embarking in haste and uproar went with the fleet
to Salamis, while their soldiery mounted guard in Piraeus. The Peloponnesians, on becoming
aware of the coming relief, after they had overrun most of Salamis, hastily sailed off with
their plunder and captives and the three ships from Fort Budorum to Nisaea; the state of their
ships also causing them some anxiety, as it was a long while since they had been launched,
and they were not water-tight. Arrived at Megara, they returned back on foot to Corinth. The
Athenians finding them no longer at Salamis, sailed back themselves; and after this made arrangements
for guarding Piraeus more diligently in future, by closing the harbours, and by other suitable
precautions.

About the same time, at the beginning of this winter, Sitalces, son of Teres, the Odrysian
king of Thrace, made an expedition against Perdiccas, son of Alexander, king of Macedonia,
and the Chalcidians in the neighbourhood of Thrace; his object being to enforce one promise
and fulfil another. On the one hand Perdiccas had made him a promise, when hard pressed at
the commencement of the war, upon condition that Sitalces should reconcile the Athenians to
him and not attempt to restore his brother and enemy, the pretender Philip, but had not offered
to fulfil his engagement; on the other he, Sitalces, on entering into alliance with the Athenians,
had agreed to put an end to the Chalcidian war in Thrace. These were the two objects of his
invasion. With him he brought Amyntas, the son of Philip, whom he destined for the throne of
Macedonia, and some Athenian envoys then at his court on this business, and Hagnon as general;
for the Athenians were to join him against the Chalcidians with a fleet and as many soldiers
as they could get together.

Beginning with the Odrysians, he first called out the Thracian tribes subject to him between
Mounts Haemus and Rhodope and the Euxine and Hellespont; next the Getae beyond Haemus, and
the other hordes settled south of the Danube in the neighbourhood of the Euxine, who, like
the Getae, border on the Scythians and are armed in the same manner, being all mounted archers.
Besides these he summoned many of the hill Thracian independent swordsmen, called Dii and mostly
inhabiting Mount Rhodope, some of whom came as mercenaries, others as volunteers; also the
Agrianes and Laeaeans, and the rest of the Paeonian tribes in his empire, at the confines of
which these lay, extending up to the Laeaean Paeonians and the river Strymon, which flows from
Mount Scombrus through the country of the Agrianes and Laeaeans; there the empire of Sitalces
ends and the territory of the independent Paeonians begins. Bordering on the Triballi, also
independent, were the Treres and Tilataeans, who dwell to the north of Mount Scombrus and extend
towards the setting sun as far as the river Oskius. This river rises in the same mountains
as the Nestus and Hebrus, a wild and extensive range connected with Rhodope.

The empire of the Odrysians extended along the seaboard from Abdera to the mouth of the Danube
in the Euxine. The navigation of this coast by the shortest route takes a merchantman four
days and four nights with a wind astern the whole way: by land an active man, travelling by
the shortest road, can get from Abdera to the Danube in eleven days. Such was the length of
its coast line. Inland from Byzantium to the Laeaeans and the Strymon, the farthest limit of
its extension into the interior, it is a journey of thirteen days for an active man. The tribute
from all the barbarian districts and the Hellenic cities, taking what they brought in under
Seuthes, the successor of Sitalces, who raised it to its greatest height, amounted to about
four hundred talents in gold and silver. There were also presents in gold and silver to a no
less amount, besides stuff, plain and embroidered, and other articles, made not only for the
king, but also for the Odrysian lords and nobles. For there was here established a custom opposite
to that prevailing in the Persian kingdom, namely, of taking rather than giving; more disgrace
being attached to not giving when asked than to asking and being refused; and although this
prevailed elsewhere in Thrace, it was practised most extensively among the powerful Odrysians,
it being impossible to get anything done without a present. It was thus a very powerful kingdom;
in revenue and general prosperity surpassing all in Europe between the Ionian Gulf and the
Euxine, and in numbers and military resources coming decidedly next to the Scythians, with
whom indeed no people in Europe can bear comparison, there not being even in Asia any nation
singly a match for them if unanimous, though of course they are not on a level with other races
in general intelligence and the arts of civilized life.

It was the master of this empire that now prepared to take the field. When everything was ready,
he set out on his march for Macedonia, first through his own dominions, next over the desolate
range of Cercine that divides the Sintians and Paeonians, crossing by a road which he had made
by felling the timber on a former campaign against the latter people. Passing over these mountains,
with the Paeonians on his right and the Sintians and Maedians on the left, he finally arrived
at Doberus, in Paeonia, losing none of his army on the march, except perhaps by sickness, but
receiving some augmentations, many of the independent Thracians volunteering to join him in
the hope of plunder; so that the whole is said to have formed a grand total of a hundred and
fifty thousand. Most of this was infantry, though there was about a third cavalry, furnished
principally by the Odrysians themselves and next to them by the Getae. The most warlike of
the infantry were the independent swordsmen who came down from Rhodope; the rest of the mixed
multitude that followed him being chiefly formidable by their numbers.

Assembling in Doberus, they prepared for descending from the heights upon Lower Macedonia,
where the dominions of Perdiccas lay; for the Lyncestae, Elimiots, and other tribes more inland,
though Macedonians by blood, and allies and dependants of their kindred, still have their own
separate governments. The country on the sea coast, now called Macedonia, was first acquired
by Alexander, the father of Perdiccas, and his ancestors, originally Temenids from Argos. This
was effected by the expulsion from Pieria of the Pierians, who afterwards inhabited Phagres
and other places under Mount Pangaeus, beyond the Strymon (indeed the country between Pangaeus
and the sea is still called the Pierian Gulf); of the Bottiaeans, at present neighbours of
the Chalcidians, from Bottia, and by the acquisition in Paeonia of a narrow strip along the
river Axius extending to Pella and the sea; the district of Mygdonia, between the Axius and
the Strymon, being also added by the expulsion of the Edonians. From Eordia also were driven
the Eordians, most of whom perished, though a few of them still live round Physca, and the
Almopians from Almopia. These Macedonians also conquered places belonging to the other tribes,
which are still theirs--Anthemus, Crestonia, Bisaltia, and much of Macedonia proper. The whole
is now called Macedonia, and at the time of the invasion of Sitalces, Perdiccas, Alexander's
son, was the reigning king.

These Macedonians, unable to take the field against so numerous an invader, shut themselves
up in such strong places and fortresses as the country possessed. Of these there was no great
number, most of those now found in the country having been erected subsequently by Archelaus,
the son of Perdiccas, on his accession, who also cut straight roads, and otherwise put the
kingdom on a better footing as regards horses, heavy infantry, and other war material than
had been done by all the eight kings that preceded him. Advancing from Doberus, the Thracian
host first invaded what had been once Philip's government, and took Idomene by assault, Gortynia,
Atalanta, and some other places by negotiation, these last coming over for love of Philip's
son, Amyntas, then with Sitalces. Laying siege to Europus, and failing to take it, he next
advanced into the rest of Macedonia to the left of Pella and Cyrrhus, not proceeding beyond
this into Bottiaea and Pieria, but staying to lay waste Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Anthemus.

The Macedonians never even thought of meeting him with infantry; but the Thracian host was,
as opportunity offered, attacked by handfuls of their horse, which had been reinforced from
their allies in the interior. Armed with cuirasses, and excellent horsemen, wherever these
charged they overthrew all before them, but ran considerable risk in entangling themselves
in the masses of the enemy, and so finally desisted from these efforts, deciding that they
were not strong enough to venture against numbers so superior.

Meanwhile Sitalces opened negotiations with Perdiccas on the objects of his expedition; and
finding that the Athenians, not believing that he would come, did not appear with their fleet,
though they sent presents and envoys, dispatched a large part of his army against the Chalcidians
and Bottiaeans, and shutting them up inside their walls laid waste their country. While he
remained in these parts, the people farther south, such as the Thessalians, Magnetes, and the
other tribes subject to the Thessalians, and the Hellenes as far as Thermopylae, all feared
that the army might advance against them, and prepared accordingly. These fears were shared
by the Thracians beyond the Strymon to the north, who inhabited the plains, such as the Panaeans,
the Odomanti, the Droi, and the Dersaeans, all of whom are independent. It was even matter
of conversation among the Hellenes who were enemies of Athens whether he might not be invited
by his ally to advance also against them. Meanwhile he held Chalcidice and Bottice and Macedonia,
and was ravaging them all; but finding that he was not succeeding in any of the objects of
his invasion, and that his army was without provisions and was suffering from the severity
of the season, he listened to the advice of Seuthes, son of Spardacus, his nephew and highest
officer, and decided to retreat without delay. This Seuthes had been secretly gained by Perdiccas
by the promise of his sister in marriage with a rich dowry. In accordance with this advice,
and after a stay of thirty days in all, eight of which were spent in Chalcidice, he retired
home as quickly as he could; and Perdiccas afterwards gave his sister Stratonice to Seuthes
as he had promised. Such was the history of the expedition of Sitalces.
