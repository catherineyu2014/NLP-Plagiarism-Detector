~Avogadro's hypothesis.~ We have seen that the laws of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac apply
to all gases irrespective of their chemical character. This would lead to the inference that
the structure of gases must be quite simple, and that it is much the same in all gases.

In 1811 Avogadro, an Italian physicist, suggested that if we assume all gases under the same
conditions of temperature and pressure to have the same number of molecules in a given volume,
we shall have a probable explanation of the simplicity of the gas laws. It is difficult to
prove the truth of this hypothesis by a simple experiment, but there are so many facts known
which are in complete harmony with this suggestion that there is little doubt that it expresses
the truth. Avogadro's hypothesis may be stated thus: Equal volumes of all gases under the same
conditions of temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules.

~Avogadro's hypothesis and molecular weights.~ Assuming that Avogadro's hypothesis is correct,
we have a very simple means for deciding upon the relative weights of molecules; for if equal
volumes of two gases contain the same number of molecules, the weights of the two volumes must
be in the same ratio as the weights of the individual molecules which they contain. If we adopt
some one gas as a standard, we can express the weights of all other gases as compared with
this one, and the same figures will express the relative weights of the molecules of which
the gases are composed.

~Oxygen as the standard.~ It is important that the same standard should be adopted for the
determination of molecular weights as has been decided upon for atomic weights and equivalents,
so that the three values may be in harmony with each other. Accordingly it is best to adopt
oxygen as the standard element with which to compare the molecular weights of other gases,
being careful to keep the oxygen atom equal to 16.

~The oxygen molecule contains two atoms.~ One point must not be overlooked, however. We desire
to have our unit, the oxygen atom, equal to 16. The method of comparing the weights of gases
just suggested compares the molecules of the gases with the molecule of oxygen. Is the molecule
and the atom of oxygen the same thing? This question is answered by the following considerations.

We have seen that when steam is formed by the union of oxygen and hydrogen, two volumes of
hydrogen combine with one volume of oxygen to form two volumes of steam. Let us suppose that
the one volume of oxygen contains 100 molecules; then the two volumes of steam must, according
to Avogadro's hypothesis, contain 200 molecules. But each of these 200 molecules must contain
at least one atom of oxygen, or 200 in all, and these 200 atoms came from 100 molecules of
oxygen. It follows that each molecule of oxygen must contain at least two atoms of oxygen.

Evidently this reasoning merely shows that there are at least two atoms in the oxygen molecule.
There may be more than that, but as there is no evidence to this effect, we assume that the
molecule contains two atoms only.

It is evident that if we wish to retain the value 16 for the atom of oxygen we must take twice
this value, or 32, for the value of the oxygen molecule, when using it as a standard for molecular
weights.

~Determination of the molecular weights of gases from their weights compared with oxygen.~
Assuming the molecular weight of oxygen to be 32, Avogadro's hypothesis gives us a ready means
for determining the molecular weight of any other gas, for all that is required is to know
its weight compared with that of an equal volume of oxygen. For example, 1 l. of chlorine is
found by experiment to weigh 2.216 times as much as 1 l. of oxygen. The molecular weight of
chlorine must therefore be 2.216 × 32, or 70.91.

If, instead of comparing the relative weights of 1 l. of the two gases, we select such a volume
of oxygen as will weigh 32 g., or the weight in grams corresponding to the molecular weight
of the gas, the calculation is much simplified. It has been found that 32 g. of oxygen, under
standard conditions, measure 22.4 l. This same volume of hydrogen weighs 2.019 g.; of chlorine
70.9 g.; of hydrochloric acid 36.458 g. The weights of these equal volumes must be proportional
to their molecular weights, and since the weight of the oxygen is the same as the value of
its molecular weight, so too will the weights of the 22.4 l. of the other gases be equal to
the value of their molecular weights.

As a summary we can then make the following statement: The molecular weight of any gas may
be determined by calculating the weight of 22.4 l. of the gas, measured under standard conditions.

~Determination of molecular weights from density of gases.~ In an actual experiment it is easier
to determine the density of a gas than the weight of a definite volume of it. The density of
a gas is usually defined as its weight compared with that of an equal volume of air. Having
determined the density of a gas, its weight compared with oxygen may be determined by multiplying
its density by the ratio between the weights of air and oxygen. This ratio is 0.9046. To compare
it with our standard for atomic weights we must further multiply it by 32, since the standard
is 1/32 the weight of oxygen molecules. The steps then are these:

1. Determine the density of the gas (its weight compared with air).

2. Multiply by 0.9046 to make the comparison with oxygen molecules.

3. Multiply by 32 to make the comparison with the unit for atomic weights.

We have, then, the formula:

    molecular weight = density × 0.9046 × 32;

or, still more briefly,

    M. = D. × 28.9.

The value found by this method for the determination of molecular weights will of course agree
with those found by calculating the weight of 22.4 l. of the gas, since both methods depend
on the same principles.

     ~Determination of densities of gases.~ The relative weights of
     equal volumes of two gases can be easily determined. The
     following is one of the methods used. A small flask, such as is
     shown in Fig. 69, is filled with one of the gases, and after
     the temperature and pressure have been noted the flask is
     sealed up and weighed. The tip of the sealed end is then broken
     off, the flask filled with the second gas, and its weight
     determined. If the weight of the empty flask is subtracted from
     these two weighings, the relative weights of the gases is
     readily found.

~3. Deduction of atomic weights from molecular weights and equivalents.~ We have now seen how
the equivalent of an element and the molecular weight of compounds containing the element can
be obtained. Let us see how it is possible to decide which multiple of the equivalent really
is the true atomic weight. As an example, let us suppose that the equivalent of nitrogen has
been found to be 7.02 and that it is desired to obtain its atomic weight. The next step is
to obtain the molecular weights of a large number of compounds containing nitrogen. The following
will serve:

==================+============+=============+================+==============

Hydrocyanic acid  |   0.930    |    26.87    |     51.90      |    13.94
==================+============+=============+================+==============

~Method of calculation.~ The densities of the various gases in the first column of this table
are determined by experiment, and are fairly accurate but not entirely so. By multiplying these
densities by 28.9 the molecular weights of the compounds as given in the second column are
obtained. By chemical analysis it is possible to determine the percentage composition of these
substances, and the percentages of nitrogen in them as determined by analysis are given in
the third column. If each of these molecular weights is multiplied in turn by the percentage
of nitrogen in the compound, the product will be the weight of the nitrogen in the molecular
weight of the compound. This will be the sum of the weights of the nitrogen atoms in the molecule.
These values are given in the fourth column in the table.

If a large number of compounds containing nitrogen are studied in this way, it is probable
that there will be included in the list at least one substance whose molecule contains a single
nitrogen atom. In this case the number in the fourth column will be the approximate atomic
weight of nitrogen. On comparing the values for nitrogen in the table it will be seen that
a number which is approximately 14 is the smallest, and that the others are multiples of this.
These compounds of higher value, therefore, contain more than one nitrogen atom in the molecule.

~Accurate determination of atomic weights.~ Molecular weights cannot be determined very accurately,
and consequently the part in them due to nitrogen is a little uncertain, as will be seen in
the table. All we can tell by this method is that the true weight is very near 14. The equivalent
can however be determined very accurately, and we have seen that it is some multiple or submultiple
of the true atomic weight. Since molecular-weight determinations have shown that in the case
of nitrogen the atomic weight is near 14, and we have found the equivalent to be 7.02, it is
evident that the true atomic weight is twice the equivalent, or 7.02 × 2 = 14.04.

~Summary.~ These, then, are the steps necessary to establish the atomic weight of an element.

1. Determine the equivalent accurately by analysis.

2. Determine the molecular weight of a large number of compounds of the element, and by analysis
the part of the molecular weight due to the element. The smallest number so obtained will be
approximately the atomic weight.

3. Multiply the equivalent by the small whole number (usually 1, 2, or 3), which will make
a number very close to the approximate atomic weight. The figure so obtained will be the true
atomic weight.

~Molecular weights of the elements.~ It will be noticed that the molecular weight of nitrogen
obtained by multiplying its density by 28.9 is 28.08. Yet the atomic weight of nitrogen as
deduced from a study of its gaseous compounds is 14.04. The simplest explanation that can be
given for this is that the gaseous nitrogen is made up of molecules, each of which contains
two atoms. In this respect it resembles oxygen; for we have seen that an entirely different
line of reasoning leads us to believe that the molecule of oxygen contains two atoms. When
we wish to indicate molecules of these gases the symbols N{2} and O{2} should be used. When
we desire to merely show the weights taking part in a reaction this is not necessary.

The vapor densities of many of the elements show that, like oxygen and nitrogen, their molecules
consist of two atoms. In other cases, particularly among the metals, the molecule and the atom
are identical. Still other elements have four atoms in their molecules.

While oxygen contains two atoms in its molecules, a study of ozone has led to the conclusion
that it has three. The formation of ozone from oxygen can therefore be represented by the equation

    3O{2} = 2O{3}.

~Other methods of determining molecular weights.~ It will be noticed that Avogadro's law gives
us a method by which we can determine the relative weights of the molecules of two gases because
it enables us to tell when we are dealing with an equal number of the two kinds of molecules.
If by any other means we can get this information, we can make use of the knowledge so gained
to determine the molecular weights of the two substances.

~Raoult's laws.~ Two laws have been discovered which give us just such information. They are
known as Raoult's laws, and can be stated as follows:

1. When weights of substances which are proportional to their molecular weights are dissolved
in the same weight of solvent, the rise of the boiling point is the same in each case.

2.

By taking advantage of these laws it is possible to determine when two solutions contain the
same number of molecules of two dissolved substances, and consequently the relative molecular
weights of the two substances.

~Law of Dulong and Petit.~ In 1819 Dulong and Petit discovered a very interesting relation
between the atomic weight of an element and its specific heat, which holds true for elements
in the solid state. If equal weights of two solids, say, lead and silver, are heated through
the same range of temperature, as from 10° to 20°, it is found that very different amounts
of heat are required. The amount of heat required to change the temperature of a solid or a
liquid by a definite amount compared with the amount required to change the temperature of
an equal weight of water by the same amount is called its specific heat. Dulong and Petit discovered
the following law: The specific heat of an element in the solid form multiplied by its atomic
weight is approximately equal to the constant 6.25. That is,

    at. wt. × sp. ht. = 6.25.

Consequently,

                6.25
    at. wt. = --------
               sp. ht.

This law is not very accurate, but it is often possible by means of it to decide upon what
multiple of the equivalent is the real atomic weight. Thus the specific heat of iron is found
by experiment to be 0.112, and its equivalent is 27.95. 6.25 ÷ 0.112 = 55.8. We see, therefore,
that the atomic weight is twice the equivalent, or 55.9.

~How formulas are determined.~ It will be well in connection with molecular weights to consider
how the formula of a compound is decided upon, for the two subjects are very closely associated.
Some examples will make clear the method followed.

The molecular weight of a substance containing hydrogen and chlorine was 36.4. By analysis
36.4 parts of the substance was found to contain 1 part of hydrogen and 35.4 parts of chlorine.
As these are the simple atomic weights of the two elements, the formula of the compound must
be HCl.

A substance consisting of oxygen and hydrogen was found to have a molecular weight of 34. Analysis
showed that in 34 parts of the substance there were 2 parts of hydrogen and 32 parts of oxygen.
Dividing these figures by the atomic weights of the two elements, we get 2 ÷ 1 = 2 for H; 32
÷ 16 = 2 for O. The formula is therefore H{2}O{2}.

A substance containing 2.04% H, 32.6% S, and 65.3% O was found to have a molecular weight of
98. In these 98 parts of the substance there are 98 × 2.04% = 2 parts of H, 98 × 32.6% = 32
parts of S, and 98 × 65.3% = 64 parts of O. If the molecule weighs 98, the hydrogen atoms present
must together weigh 2, the sulphur atoms 32, and the oxygen atoms 64. Dividing these figures
by the respective atomic weights of the three elements, we have, for H, 2 ÷ 1 = 2 atoms; for
S, 32 ÷ 32 = 1 atom; for O, 64 ÷ 16 = 4 atoms. Hence the formula is H{2}SO{4}.

We have, then, this general procedure: Find the percentage composition of the substance and
also its molecular weight. Multiply the molecular weight successively by the percentage of
each element present, to find the amount of the element in the molecular weight of the compound.
The figures so obtained will be the respective parts of the molecular weight due to the several
atoms. Divide by the atomic weights of the respective elements, and the quotient will be the
number of atoms present.

~Avogadro's hypothesis and chemical calculations.~ This law simplifies many chemical calculations.

1. Application to volume relations in gaseous reactions. Since equal volumes of gases contain
an equal number of molecules, it follows that when an equal number of gaseous molecules of
two or more gases take part in a reaction, the reaction will involve equal volumes of the gases.
In the equation

    C{2}H{2}O{4} = H{2}O + CO{2} + CO,

since 1 molecule of each of the gases CO{2} and CO is set free from each molecule of oxalic
acid, the two substances must always be set free in equal volumes.

Acetylene burns in accordance with the equation

    2C{2}H{2} + 5O{2} = 4CO{2} + 2H{2}O.

Hence 2 volumes of acetylene will react with 5 volumes of oxygen to form 4 volumes of carbon
dioxide and 2 volumes of steam. That the volume relations may be correct a gaseous element
must be given its molecular formula. Thus oxygen must be written O{2} and not 2O.

2. Application to weights of gases. It will be recalled that the molecular weight of a gas
is determined by ascertaining the weight of 22.4 l. of the gas. This weight in grams is called
the gram-molecular weight of a gas. If the molecular weight of any gas is known, the weight
of a liter of the gas under standard conditions may be determined by dividing its gram-molecular
weight by 22.4. Thus the gram-molecular weight of a hydrochloric acid gas is 36.458. A liter
of the gas will therefore weigh 36.458 ÷ 22.4 = 1.627 g.

==================================================

~The family.~ The elements constituting this family belong in the same group with nitrogen
and therefore resemble it in a general way. They exhibit a regular gradation of physical properties,
as is shown in the above table. The same general gradation is also found in their chemical
properties, phosphorus being an acid-forming element, while bismuth is essentially a metal.
The other two elements are intermediate in properties.

~Compounds.~ In general the elements of the family form compounds having similar composition,
as is shown in the following table:

    PH{3}  PCl{3}   PCl{5}   P{2}O{3}   P{2}O{5}
    AsH{3} AsCl{3}  AsCl{5}  As{2}O{3}  As{2}O{5}
    SbH{3} SbCl{3}  SbCl{5}  Sb{2}O{3}  Sb{2}O{5}
     ....   BiCl{3}  BiCl{5}  Bi{2}O{3}  Bi{2}O{5}

In the case of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony the oxides are acid anhydrides. Salts of at
least four acids of each of these three elements are known, the free acid in some instances
being unstable. The relation of these acids to the corresponding anhydrides may be illustrated
as follows, phosphorus being taken as an example:

    P{2}O{3} + 3H{2}O = 2H{3}PO{3} (phosphorous acid).

    P{2}O{5} + 3H{2}O = 2H{3}PO{4} (phosphoric acid).

    P{2}O{5} + 2H{2}O = H{4}P{2}O{7} (pyrophosphoric acid).

    P{2}O{5} + H{2}O = 2HPO{3} (metaphosphoric acid).

PHOSPHORUS

~History.~ The element phosphorus was discovered by the alchemist Brand, of Hamburg, in 1669,
while searching for the philosopher's stone. Owing to its peculiar properties and the secrecy
which was maintained about its preparation, it remained a very rare and costly substance until
the demand for it in the manufacture of matches brought about its production on a large scale.

~Occurrence.~ Owing to its great chemical activity phosphorus never occurs free in nature.
In the form of phosphates it is very abundant and widely distributed. Phosphorite and sombrerite
are mineral forms of calcium phosphate, while apatite consists of calcium phosphate together
with calcium fluoride or chloride. These minerals form very large deposits and are extensively
mined for use as fertilizers. Calcium phosphate is a constituent of all fertile soil, having
been supplied to the soil by the disintegration of rocks containing it. It is the chief mineral
constituent of bones of animals, and bone ash is therefore nearly pure calcium phosphate.

~Preparation.~ Phosphorus is now manufactured from bone ash or a pure mineral phosphate by
heating the phosphate with sand and carbon in an electric furnace. The materials are fed in
at M (Fig. 70) by the feed screw F. The phosphorus vapor escapes at P and is condensed under
water, while the calcium silicate is tapped off as a liquid at S. The phosphorus obtained in
this way is quite impure, and is purified by distillation.

     ~Explanation of the reaction.~ To understand the reaction which
     occurs, it must be remembered that a volatile acid anhydride is
     expelled from its salts when heated with an anhydride which is
     not volatile. Thus, when sodium carbonate and silicon dioxide
     are heated together the following reaction takes place:

         Na{2}CO{3} + SiO{2} = Na{2}SiO{3} + CO{2}.

     Silicon dioxide is a less volatile anhydride than phosphoric
     anhydride (P{2}O{5}), and when strongly heated with a
     phosphate the phosphoric anhydride is driven out, thus:

         Ca{3}(PO{4}){2} + 3SiO{2} = 3CaSiO{3} + P{2}O{5}.

     If carbon is added before the heat is applied, the P{2}O{5}
     is reduced to phosphorus at the same time, according to the
     equation

         P{2}O{5} + 5C = 2P + 5CO.

~Physical properties.~ The purified phosphorus is a pale yellowish, translucent, waxy solid
which melts at 43.3° and boils at 269°. It can therefore be cast into any convenient form under
warm water, and is usually sold in the market in the form of sticks. It is quite soft and can
be easily cut with a knife, but this must always be done while the element is covered with
water, since it is extremely inflammable, and the friction of the knife blade is almost sure
to set it on fire if cut in the air. It is not soluble in water, but is freely soluble in some
other liquids, notably in carbon disulphide. Its density is 1.8.

~Chemical properties.~ Exposed to the air phosphorus slowly combines with oxygen, and in so
doing emits a pale light, or phosphorescence, which can be seen only in a dark place. The heat
of the room may easily raise the temperature to the kindling point of phosphorus, when it burns
with a sputtering flame, giving off dense fumes of oxide of phosphorus. It burns with dazzling
brilliancy in oxygen, and combines directly with many other elements, especially with sulphur
and the halogens. On account of its great affinity for oxygen it is always preserved under water.

Phosphorus is very poisonous, from 0.2 to 0.3 gram being a fatal dose. Ground up with flour
and water or similar substances, it is often used as a poison for rats and other vermin.

     ~Precaution.~ The heat of the body is sufficient to raise
     phosphorus above its kindling temperature, and for this reason
     it should always be handled with forceps and never with the
     bare fingers. Burns occasioned by it are very painful and slow
     in healing.

~Red phosphorus.~ On standing, yellow phosphorus gradually undergoes a remarkable change, being
converted into a dark red powder which has a density of 2.1. It no longer takes fire easily,
neither does it dissolve in carbon disulphide. It is not poisonous and, in fact, seems to be
an entirely different substance. The velocity of this change increases with rise in temperature,
and the red phosphorus is therefore prepared by heating the yellow just below the boiling point
(250°-300°). When distilled and quickly condensed the red form changes back to the yellow.
This is in accordance with the general rule that when a substance capable of existing in several
allotropic forms is condensed from a gas or crystallized from the liquid state, the more unstable
variety forms first, and this then passes into the more stable forms.

     ~Matches.~ The chief use of phosphorus is in the manufacture of
     matches. Common matches are made by first dipping the match
     sticks into some inflammable substance, such as melted
     paraffin, and afterward into a paste consisting of (1)
     phosphorus, (2) some oxidizing substance, such as manganese
     dioxide or potassium chlorate, and (3) a binding material,
     usually some kind of glue. On friction the phosphorus is
     ignited, the combustion being sustained by the oxidizing agent
     and communicated to the wood by the burning paraffin. In
     sulphur matches the paraffin is replaced by sulphur.

     In safety matches red phosphorus, an oxidizing agent, and
     some gritty material such as emery is placed on the side of the
     box, while the match tip is provided as before with an
     oxidizing agent and an easily oxidized substance, usually
     antimony sulphide. The match cannot be ignited easily by
     friction, save on the prepared surface.

~Compounds of phosphorus with hydrogen.~ Phosphorus forms several compounds with hydrogen,
the best known of which is phosphine (PH{3}) analogous to ammonia (NH{3}).

~Preparation of phosphine.~ Phosphine is usually made by heating phosphorus with a strong solution
of potassium hydroxide, the reaction being a complicated one.

     The experiment can be conveniently made in the apparatus shown
     in Fig. 71. A strong solution of potassium hydroxide together
     with several small bits of phosphorus are placed in the flask
     A, and a current of coal gas is passed into the flask through
     the tube B until all the air has been displaced. The gas is
     then turned off and the flask is heated. Phosphine is formed in
     small quantities and escapes through the delivery tube, the
     exit of which is just covered by the water in the vessel C.
     Each bubble of the gas as it escapes into the air takes fire,
     and the product of combustion (P{2}O{5}) forms beautiful
     small rings, which float unbroken for a considerable time in
     quiet air. The pure phosphine does not take fire spontaneously.
     When prepared as directed above, impurities are present which
     impart this property.

~Properties.~ Phosphine is a gas of unpleasant odor and is exceedingly poisonous. Like ammonia
it forms salts with the halogen acids. Thus we have phosphonium chloride (PH{4}Cl) analogous
to ammonium chloride (NH{4}Cl). The phosphonium salts are of but little importance.

~Oxides of phosphorus.~ Phosphorus forms two well-known oxides,--the trioxide (P{2}O{3}) and
the pentoxide (P{2}O{5}), sometimes called phosphoric anhydride. When phosphorus burns in an
insufficient supply of air the product is partially the trioxide; in oxygen or an excess of
air the pentoxide is formed. The pentoxide is much the better known of the two. It is a snow-white,
voluminous powder whose most marked property is its great attraction for water. It has no chemical
action upon most gases, so that they can be very thoroughly dried by allowing them to pass
through properly arranged vessels containing phosphorus pentoxide.

~Acids of phosphorus.~ The important acids of phosphorus are the following:

    H{3}PO{3}       phosphorous acid.
    H{3}PO{4}       phosphoric acid.
    H{4}P{2}O{7}   pyrophosphoric acid.
    HPO{3}           metaphosphoric acid.

These may be regarded as combinations of the oxides of phosphorus with water according to the
equations given in the discussion of the characteristics of the family.

1. Phosphorous acid (H{3}PO{3}). Neither the acid nor its salts are at all frequently met with
in chemical operations. It can be easily obtained, however, in the form of transparent crystals
when phosphorus trichloride is treated with water and the resulting solution is evaporated:

    PCl{3} + 3H{2}O = H{3}PO{3} + 3HCl.

Its most interesting property is its tendency to take up oxygen and pass over into phosphoric acid.

2. Orthophosphoric acid (phosphoric acid) (H{3}PO{4}).

It is usually made by treating calcium phosphate with concentrated sulphuric acid. The calcium
sulphate produced in the reaction is nearly insoluble, and can be filtered off, leaving the
phosphoric acid in solution. Very pure acid is made by oxidizing phosphorus with nitric acid.
It forms large colorless crystals which are exceedingly soluble in water. Being a tribasic
acid, it forms acid as well as normal salts. Thus the following compounds of sodium are known:

    NaH{2}PO{4}   monosodium hydrogen phosphate.
    Na{2}HPO{4}   disodium hydrogen phosphate.
    Na{3}PO{4}    normal sodium phosphate.

These salts are sometimes called respectively primary, secondary, and tertiary phosphates.
They may be prepared by bringing together phosphoric acid and appropriate quantities of sodium
hydroxide. Phosphoric acid also forms mixed salts, that is, salts containing two different
metals. The most familiar compound of this kind is microcosmic salt, which has the formula
Na(NH{4})HPO{4}.

Orthophosphates. The orthophosphates form an important class of salts. The normal salts are
nearly all insoluble and many of them occur in nature. The secondary phosphates are as a rule
insoluble, while most of the primary salts are soluble.

3. Pyrophosphoric acid (H{4}P{2}O{7}). On heating orthophosphoric acid to about 225° pyrophosphoric
acid is formed in accordance with the following equation:

    2H{3}PO{4} = H{4}P{2}O{7} + H{2}O.

It is a white crystalline solid. Its salts can be prepared by heating a secondary phosphate:

    2Na{2}HPO{4} = Na{4}P{2}O{7} + H{2}O.

4. Metaphosphoric acid (glacial phosphoric acid) (HPO{3}). This acid is formed when orthophosphoric
acid is heated above 400°:

    H{3}PO{4} = HPO{3} + H{2}O.

It is also formed when phosphorus pentoxide is treated with cold water:

    P{2}O{5} + H{2}O = 2HPO{3}.

It is a white crystalline solid, and is so stable towards heat that it can be fused and even
volatilized without decomposition. On cooling from the fused state it forms a glassy solid,
and on this account is often called glacial phosphoric acid. It possesses the property of dissolving
small quantities of metallic oxides, with the formation of compounds which, in the case of
certain metals, have characteristic colors. It is therefore used in the detection of these metals.

While the secondary phosphates, on heating, give salts of pyrophosphoric acid, the primary
phosphates yield salts of metaphosphoric acid. The equations representing these reactions are
as follows:

    2Na{2}HPO{4} = Na{4}P{3}O{7} + H{2}O,

      NaH{2}PO{4} = NaPO{3} + H{2}O.

~Fertilizers.~ When crops are produced year after year on the same field certain constituents
of the soil essential to plant growth are removed, and the soil becomes impoverished and unproductive.
To make the land once more fertile these constituents must be replaced. The calcium phosphate
of the mineral deposits or of bone ash serves well as a material for restoring phosphorus to
soils exhausted of that essential element; but a more soluble substance, which the plants can
more readily assimilate, is desirable. It is better, therefore, to convert the insoluble calcium
phosphate into the soluble primary phosphate before it is applied as fertilizer. It will be
seen by reference to the formulas for the orthophosphates (see page 244) that in a primary
phosphate only one hydrogen atom of phosphoric acid is replaced by a metal. Since the calcium
atom always replaces two hydrogen atoms, it might be thought that there could be no primary
calcium phosphate; but if the calcium atom replaces one hydrogen atom from each of two molecules
of phosphoric acid, the salt Ca(H{2}PO{4}){2} will result, and this is a primary phosphate.
It can be made by treatment of the normal phosphate with the necessary amount of sulphuric
acid, calcium sulphate being formed at the same time, thus:

    Ca{3}(PO{4}){2} + 2H{2}SO{4} = Ca(H{2}PO{4}){2} + 2CaSO{4}.

The resulting mixture is a powder, which is sold as a fertilizer under the name of "superphosphate
of lime."

ARSENIC

~Occurrence.~ Arsenic occurs in considerable quantities in nature as the native element, as
the sulphides realgar (As{2}S{2}) and orpiment (As{2}S{3}), as oxide (As{2}O{3}), and as a
constituent of many metallic sulphides, such as arsenopyrite (FeAsS).

~Preparation.~ The element is prepared by purifying the native arsenic, or by heating the arsenopyrite
in iron tubes, out of contact with air, when the reaction expressed by the following equation
occurs:

    FeAsS = FeS + As.

The arsenic, being volatile, condenses in chambers connected with the heated tubes. It is also
made from the oxide by reduction with carbon:

    2As{2}O{3} + 3C = 4As + 3CO{2}.

~Properties.~ Arsenic is a steel-gray, metallic-looking substance of density 5.73. Though resembling
metals in appearance, it is quite brittle, being easily powdered in a mortar. When strongly
heated it sublimes, that is, it passes into a vapor without melting, and condenses again to
a crystalline solid when the vapor is cooled. Like phosphorus it can be obtained in several
allotropic forms. It alloys readily with some of the metals, and finds its chief use as an
alloy with lead, which is used for making shot, the alloy being harder than pure lead. When
heated on charcoal with the blowpipe it is converted into an oxide which volatilizes, leaving
the charcoal unstained by any oxide coating. It burns readily in chlorine gas, forming arsenic
trichloride,--

    As + 3Cl = AsCl{3}.

Unlike most of its compounds, the element itself is not poisonous.

~Arsine~ (AsH{3}). When any compound containing arsenic is brought into the presence of nascent
hydrogen, arsine (AsH{3}), corresponding to phosphine and ammonia, is formed. The reaction
when oxide of arsenic is so treated is

    As{2}O{3} + 12H = 2AsH{3} + 3H{2}O.

Arsine is a gas with a peculiar garlic-like odor, and is intensely poisonous. A single bubble
of pure gas has been known to prove fatal. It is an unstable compound, decomposing into its
elements when heated to a moderate temperature. It is combustible, burning with a pale bluish-white
flame to form arsenic trioxide and water when air is in excess:

    2AsH{3} + 6O = As{2}O{3} + 3H{2}O.

When the supply of air is deficient water and metallic arsenic are formed:

    2AsH{3} + 3O = 3H{2}O + 2As.

These reactions make the detection of even minute quantities of arsenic a very easy problem.

     ~Marsh's test for arsenic.~ The method devised by Marsh for
     detecting arsenic is most frequently used, the apparatus being
     shown in Fig. 72. Hydrogen is generated in the flask A by the
     action of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc, is dried by passing
     over calcium chloride in the tube B, and after passing
     through the hard-glass tube C is ignited at the jet D. If a
     substance containing arsenic is now introduced into the
     generator A, the arsenic is converted into arsine by the
     action of the nascent hydrogen, and passes to the jet along
     with the hydrogen. If the tube C is strongly heated at some
     point near the middle, the arsine is decomposed while passing
     this point and the arsenic is deposited just beyond the heated
     point in the form of a shining, brownish-black mirror. If the
     tube is not heated, the arsine burns along with the hydrogen at
     the jet. Under these conditions a small porcelain dish crowded
     down into the flame is blackened by a spot of metallic arsenic,
     for the arsine is decomposed by the heat of the flame, and the
     arsenic, cooled below its kindling temperature by the cold
     porcelain, deposits upon it as a black spot. Antimony conducts
     itself in the same way as arsenic, but the antimony deposit is
     more sooty in appearance. The two can also be distinguished by
     the fact that sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) dissolves the arsenic
     deposit, but not that formed by antimony.

~Oxides of arsenic.~ Arsenic forms two oxides, As{2}O{3} and As{2}O{5}, corresponding to those
of phosphorus. Of these arsenious oxide, or arsenic trioxide (As{2}O{3}), is much better known,
and is the substance usually called white arsenic, or merely arsenic. It is found as a mineral,
but is usually obtained as a by-product in burning pyrite in the sulphuric-acid industry. The
pyrite has a small amount of arsenopyrite in it, and when this is burned arsenious oxide is
formed as a vapor together with sulphur dioxide:

    2FeAsS + 10O = Fe{2}O{3} + As{2}O{3} + 2SO{2}.

The arsenious oxide is condensed in appropriate chambers. It is a rather heavy substance, obtained
either as a crystalline powder or as large, vitreous lumps, resembling lumps of porcelain in
appearance. It is very poisonous, from 0.2 to 0.3 g. being a fatal dose. It is frequently given
as a poison, since it is nearly tasteless and does not act very rapidly. This slow action is
due to the fact that it is not very soluble, and hence is absorbed slowly by the system. Arsenious
oxide is also used as a chemical reagent in glass making and in the dye industry.

~Acids of arsenic.~ Like the corresponding oxides of phosphorus, the oxides of arsenic are
acid anhydrides. In solution they combine with bases to form salts, corresponding to the salts
of the acids of phosphorus. Thus we have salts of the following acids:

    H{3}AsO{3} arsenious acid.

    H{3}AsO{4} orthoarsenic acid.

    H{4}As{2}O{3} pyroarsenic acid.

    HAsO{3} metarsenic acid.

Several other acids of arsenic are also known. Not all of these can be obtained as free acids,
since they tend to lose water and form the oxides. Thus, instead of obtaining arsenious acid
(H{3}AsO{3}), the oxide As{2}O{3} is obtained:

    2H{3}AsO{3} = As{2}O{3} + 3H{2}O.

Salts of all the acids are known, however, and some of them have commercial value. Most of
them are insoluble, and some of the copper salts, which are green, are used as pigments. Paris
green, which has a complicated formula, is a well-known insecticide.

~Antidote for arsenical poisoning.~ The most efficient antidote for arsenic poisoning is ferric
hydroxide. It is prepared as needed, according to the equation

    Fe{2}(SO{4}){3} + 3Mg(OH){2} = 2Fe(OH){3} + 3MgSO{4}.

~Sulphides of arsenic.~ When hydrogen sulphide is passed into an acidified solution containing
an arsenic compound the arsenic is precipitated as a bright yellow sulphide, thus:

    2H{3}AsO{3} + 3H{2}S = As{2}S{3} + 6H{2}O,

    2H{3}AsO{4} + 5H{2}S = As{2}S{5} + 8H{2}O.

In this respect arsenic resembles the metallic elements, many of which produce sulphides under
similar conditions. The sulphides of arsenic, both those produced artificially and those found
in nature, are used as yellow pigments.

ANTIMONY

~Occurrence.~ Antimony occurs in nature chiefly as the sulphide (Sb{2}S{3}), called stibnite,
though it is also found as oxide and as a constituent of many complex minerals.

~Preparation.~ Antimony is prepared from the sulphide in a very simple manner. The sulphide
is melted with scrap iron in a furnace, when the iron combines with the sulphur to form a slag,
or liquid layer of melted iron sulphide, while the heavier liquid, antimony, settles to the
bottom and is drawn off from time to time. The reaction involved is represented by the equation

    Sb{2}S{3} + 3Fe = 2Sb + 3FeS.

~Physical properties.~ Antimony is a bluish-white, metallic-looking substance whose density
is 6.7. It is highly crystalline, hard, and very brittle. It has a rather low melting point
(432°) and expands very noticeably on solidifying.

~Chemical properties.~ In chemical properties antimony resembles arsenic in many particulars.
It forms the oxides Sb{2}O{3} and Sb{2}O{5}, and in addition Sb{2}O{4}. It combines with the
halogen elements with great energy, burning brilliantly in chlorine to form antimony trichloride
(SbCl{3}). When heated on charcoal with the blowpipe it is oxidized and forms a coating of
antimony oxide on the charcoal which has a characteristic bluish-white color.

~Stibine~ (SbH{3}). The gas stibine (SbH{3}) is formed under conditions which are very similar
to those which produce arsine, and it closely resembles the latter compound, though it is still
less stable. It is very poisonous.

     ~Acids of antimony.~ The oxides Sb{2}O{3} and Sb{2}O{5} are
     weak acid anhydrides and are capable of forming two series of
     acids corresponding in formulas to the acids of phosphorus and
     arsenic. They are much weaker, however, and are of little
     practical importance.

     ~Sulphides of antimony.~ Antimony resembles arsenic in that
     hydrogen sulphide precipitates it as a sulphide when conducted
     into an acidified solution containing an antimony compound:

        2SbCl{3} + 3H{2}S = Sb{2}S{3} + 6HCl,

        2SbCl{5} + 5H{2}S = Sb{2}S{5} + 10HCl.

     The two sulphides of antimony are called the trisulphide and
     the pentasulphide respectively. When prepared in this way they
     are orange-colored substances, though the mineral stibnite is
     black.

~Metallic properties of antimony.~ The physical properties of the element are those of a metal,
and the fact that its sulphide is precipitated by hydrogen sulphide shows that it acts like
a metal in a chemical way. Many other reactions show that antimony has more of the properties
of a metal than of a non-metal. The compound Sb(OH){3}, corresponding to arsenious acid, while
able to act as a weak acid is also able to act as a weak base with strong acids. For example,
when treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid antimony chloride is formed:

    Sb(OH){3} + 3HCl = SbCl{3} + 3H{2}O.

A number of elements act in this same way, their hydroxides under some conditions being weak
acids and under others weak bases.

ALLOYS

Some metals when melted together thoroughly intermix, and on cooling form a homogeneous, metallic-appearing
substance called an alloy. Not all metals will mix in this way, and in some cases definite
chemical compounds are formed and separate out as the mixture solidifies, thus destroying the
uniform quality of the alloy. In general the melting point of the alloy is below the average
of the melting points of its constituents, and it is often lower than any one of them.

Antimony forms alloys with many of the metals, and its chief commercial use is for such purposes.
It imparts to its alloys high density, rather low melting point, and the property of expanding
on solidification. Such an alloy is especially useful in type founding, where fine lines are
to be reproduced on a cast. Type metal consists of antimony, lead, and tin. Babbitt metal,
used for journal bearings in machinery, contains the same metals in a different proportion
together with a small percentage of copper.

BISMUTH

~Occurrence.~ Bismuth is usually found in the uncombined form in nature. It also occurs as
oxide and sulphide. Most of the bismuth of commerce comes from Saxony, and from Mexico and
Colorado, but it is not an abundant element.

~Preparation.~ It is prepared by merely heating the ore containing the native bismuth and allowing
the melted metal to run out into suitable vessels. Other ores are converted into oxides and
reduced by heating with carbon.

~Physical properties.~ Bismuth is a heavy, crystalline, brittle metal nearly the color of silver,
but with a slightly rosy tint which distinguishes it from other metals. It melts at a low temperature
(270°) and has a density of 9.8. It is not acted upon by the air at ordinary temperatures.

~Chemical properties.~ When heated with the blowpipe on charcoal, bismuth gives a coating of
the oxide Bi{2}O{3}. This has a yellowish-brown color which easily distinguishes it from the
oxides formed by other metals. It combines very readily with the halogen elements, powdered
bismuth burning readily in chlorine. It is not very easily acted upon by hydrochloric acid,
but nitric and sulphuric acids act upon it in the same way that they do upon copper.

~Uses.~ Bismuth finds its chief use as a constituent of alloys, particularly in those of low
melting point. Some of these melt in hot water. For example, Wood's metal, consisting of bismuth,
lead, tin, and cadmium, melts at 60.5°.

~Compounds of bismuth.~ Unlike the other elements of this group, bismuth has almost no acid
properties. Its chief oxide, Bi{2}O{3}, is basic in its properties. It dissolves in strong
acids and forms salts of bismuth:

    Bi{2}O{3} + 6HCl = 2BiCl{3} + 3H{2}O,

    Bi{2}O{3} + 6HNO{3} = 2Bi(NO{3}){3} + 3H{2}O.

The nitrate and chloride of bismuth can be obtained as well-formed colorless crystals. When
treated with water the salts are decomposed in the manner explained in the following paragraph.

HYDROLYSIS

Many salts such as those of antimony and bismuth form solutions which are somewhat acid in
reaction, and must therefore contain hydrogen ions. This is accounted for by the same principle
suggested to explain the fact that solutions of potassium cyanide are alkaline in reaction
(p. 210). Water forms an appreciable number of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, and very weak bases
such as bismuth hydroxide are dissociated to but a very slight extent. When Bi^{+++} ions from
bismuth chloride, which dissociates very readily, are brought in contact with the OH^{-} ions
from water, the two come to the equilibrium expressed in the equation

    Bi^{+++} + 3OH^{-} <--> Bi(OH){3}.

For every hydroxyl ion removed from the solution in this way a hydrogen ion is left free, and
the solution becomes acid in reaction.

Reactions of this kind and that described under potassium cyanide are called hydrolysis.

DEFINITION: Hydrolysis is the action of water upon a salt to form an acid and a base, one of
which is very slightly dissociated.

~Conditions favoring hydrolysis.~ While hydrolysis is primarily due to the slight extent to
which either the acid or the base formed is dissociated, several other factors have an influence
upon the extent to which it will take place.

1. Influence of mass. Since hydrolysis is a reversible reaction, the relative masses of the
reacting substances influence the point at which equilibrium will be reached. In the equilibrium

    BiCl{3} + 3H{2}O <--> Bi(OH){3} + 3HCl

the addition of more water will result in the formation of more bismuth hydroxide and hydrochloric
acid. The addition of more hydrochloric acid will convert some of the bismuth hydroxide into
bismuth chloride.

2. Formation of insoluble substances. When one of the products of hydrolysis is nearly insoluble
in water the solution will become saturated with it as soon as a very little has been formed.
All in excess of this will precipitate, and the reaction will go on until the acid set free
increases sufficiently to bring about an equilibrium. Thus a considerable amount of bismuth
and antimony hydroxides are precipitated when water is added to the chlorides of these elements.
The greater the dilution the more hydroxide precipitates. The addition of hydrochloric acid
in considerable quantity will, however, redissolve the precipitate.

~Partial hydrolysis.~ In many cases the hydrolysis of a salt is only partial, resulting in
the formation of basic salts instead of the free base. Most of these basic salts are insoluble
in water, which accounts for their ready formation. Thus bismuth chloride may hydrolyze by
successive steps, as shown in the equations

    BiCl{3} + H{2}O = Bi(OH)Cl{2} + HCl,

    BiCl{3} + 2H{2}O = Bi(OH){2}Cl + 2HCl,

    BiCl{3} + 3H{2}O = Bi(OH){3} + 3HCl.

The basic salt so formed may also lose water, as shown in the equation

    Bi(OH){2}Cl = BiOCl + H{2}O.

The salt represented in the last equation is sometimes called bismuth oxychloride, or bismuthyl
chloride. The corresponding nitrate, BiONO{3}, is largely used in medicine under the name of
subnitrate of bismuth. In these two compounds the group of atoms, BiO, acts as a univalent
metallic radical and is called bismuthyl. Similar basic salts are formed by the hydrolysis
of antimony salts.

Boron       |   B    |  11.0  |   2.45  | BCl{3}   | B{2}O{3}
=================================================================

~General.~ Each of the three elements, silicon, titanium, and boron, belongs to a separate
periodic family, but they occur near together in the periodic grouping and are very similar
in both physical and chemical properties. Since the other elements in their families are either
so rare that they cannot be studied in detail, or are best understood in connection with other
elements, it is convenient to consider these three together at this point.

The three elements are very difficult to obtain in the free state, owing to their strong attraction
for other elements. They can be prepared by the action of aluminium or magnesium on their oxides
and in impure state by reduction with carbon in an electric furnace. They are very hard and
melt only at the highest temperatures. At ordinary temperatures they are not attacked by oxygen,
but when strongly heated they burn with great brilliancy. Silicon and boron are not attacked
by acids under ordinary conditions; titanium is easily dissolved by them.

SILICON

~Occurrence.~ Next to oxygen silicon is the most abundant element. It does not occur free in
nature, but its compounds are very abundant and of the greatest importance. It occurs almost
entirely in combination with oxygen as silicon dioxide (SiO{2}), often called silica, or with
oxygen and various metals in the form of salts of silicic acids, or silicates. These compounds
form a large fraction of the earth's crust. Most plants absorb small amounts of silica from
the soil, and it is also found in minute quantities in animal organisms.

~Preparation.~ The element is most easily prepared by reducing pure powdered quartz with magnesium
powder:

    SiO{2} + 2Mg = 2MgO + Si.

~Properties.~ As would be expected from its place in the periodic table, silicon resembles
carbon in many respects. It can be obtained in several allotropic forms, corresponding to those
of carbon. The crystallized form is very hard, and is inactive toward reagents. The amorphous
variety has, in general, properties more similar to charcoal.

~Compounds of silicon with hydrogen and the halogens.~ Silicon hydride (SiH{4}) corresponds
in formula to methane (CH{4}), but its properties are more like those of phosphine (PH{3}).
It is a very inflammable gas of disagreeable odor, and, as ordinarily prepared, takes fire
spontaneously on account of the presence of impurities.

Silicon combines with the elements of the chlorine family to form such compounds as SiCl{4}
and SiF{4}. Of these silicon fluoride is the most familiar and interesting. As stated in the
discussion of fluorine, it is formed when hydrofluoric acid acts upon silicon dioxide or a
silicate. With silica the reaction is thus expressed:

    SiO{2} + 4HF = SiF{4} + 2H{2}O.

It is a very volatile, invisible, poisonous gas. In contact with water it is partially decomposed,
as shown in the equation

    SiF{4} + 4H{2}O = 4HF + Si(OH){4}.

The hydrofluoric acid so formed combines with an additional amount of silicon fluoride, forming
the complex fluosilicic acid (H{2}SiF{6}), thus:

    2HF + SiF{4} = H{2}SiF{6}.

~Silicides.~ As the name indicates, silicides are binary compounds consisting of silicon and
some other element. They are very stable at high temperatures, and are usually made by heating
the appropriate substances in an electric furnace. The most important one is carborundum, which
is a silicide of carbon of the formula CSi. It is made by heating coke and sand, which is a
form of silicon dioxide, in an electric furnace, the process being extensively carried on at
Niagara Falls. The following equation represents the reaction

    SiO{2} + 3C = CSi + 2CO.

The substance so prepared consists of beautiful purplish-black crystals, which are very hard.
Carborundum is used as an abrasive, that is, as a material for grinding and polishing very
hard substances. Ferrosilicon is a silicide of iron alloyed with an excess of iron, which finds
extensive use in the manufacture of certain kinds of steel.

~Manufacture of carborundum.~ The mixture of materials is heated in a large resistance furnace
for about thirty-six hours. After the reaction is completed there is left a core of graphite
G. Surrounding this core is a layer of crystallized carborundum C, about 16 in. thick. Outside
this is a shell of amorphous carborundum A. The remaining materials M are unchanged and are
used for a new charge.

~Silicon dioxide~ (silica) (SiO{2}). This substance is found in a great variety of forms in
nature, both in the amorphous and in the crystalline condition. In the form of quartz it is
found in beautifully formed six-sided prisms, sometimes of great size. When pure it is perfectly
transparent and colorless. Some colored varieties are given special names, as amethyst (violet),
rose quartz (pale pink), smoky or milky quartz (colored and opaque). Other varieties of silicon
dioxide, some of which also contain water, are chalcedony, onyx, jasper, opal, agate, and flint.
Sand and sandstone are largely silicon dioxide.

~Properties.~ As obtained by chemical processes silicon dioxide is an amorphous white powder.
In the crystallized state it is very hard and has a density of 2.6. It is insoluble in water
and in most chemical reagents, and requires the hottest oxyhydrogen flame for fusion. Acids,
excepting hydrofluoric acid, have little action on it, and it requires the most energetic reducing
agents to deprive it of oxygen. It is the anhydride of an acid, and consequently it dissolves
in fused alkalis to form silicates. Being nonvolatile, it will drive out most other anhydrides
when heated to a high temperature with their salts, especially when the silicates so formed
are fusible.

~Silicic acids.~ Silicon forms two simple acids, orthosilicic acid (H{4}SiO{4}) and metasilicic
acid (H{2}SiO{3}). Orthosilicic acid is formed as a jelly-like mass when orthosilicates are
treated with strong acids such as hydrochloric. On attempting to dry this acid it loses water,
passing into metasilicic or common silicic acid:

    H{4}SiO{4} = H{2}SiO{3} + H{2}O.

Metasilicic acid when heated breaks up into silica and water, thus:

    H{2}SiO{3} = H{2}O + SiO{2}.

     ~Salts of silicic acids,--silicates.~ A number of salts of the
     orthosilicic and metasilicic acids occur in nature. Thus mica
     (KAlSiO{4}) is a salt of orthosilicic acid.

~Polysilicic acids.~ Silicon has the power to form a great many complex acids which may be
regarded as derived from the union of several molecules of the orthosilicic acid, with the
loss of water. Thus we have

    3H{4}SiO{4} = H{4}Si{3}O{8} + 4H{2}O.

These acids cannot be prepared in the pure state, but their salts form many of the crystalline
rocks in nature. Feldspar, for example, has the formula KAlSi{3}O{8}, and is a mixed salt of
the acid H{4}Si{3}O{8}, whose formation is represented in the equation above. Kaolin has the
formula Al{2}Si{2}O{7}·2H{2}O. Many other examples will be met in the study of the metals.

~Glass.~ When sodium and calcium silicates, together with silicon dioxide, are heated to a
very high temperature, the mixture slowly fuses to a transparent liquid, which on cooling passes
into the solid called glass.

The mixture is heated below the fusing point for some time, so that the escaping carbon dioxide
may not spatter the hot liquid; the heat is then increased and the mixture kept in a state
of fusion until all gases formed in the reaction have escaped.

Molding and blowing of glass. The way in which the melted mixture is handled in the glass factory
depends upon the character of the article to be made. Many articles, such as bottles, are made
by blowing the plastic glass into hollow molds of the desired shape. The mold is first opened,
as shown in Fig. 74. A lump of plastic glass A on the hollow rod B is lowered into the mold,
which is then closed by the handles C. By blowing into the tube the glass is blown into the
shape of the mold. The mold is then opened and the bottle lifted out. The neck of the bottle
must be cut off at the proper place and the sharp edges rounded off in a flame.

Other objects, such as lamp chimneys, are made by getting a lump of plastic glass on the end
of a hollow iron rod and blowing it into the desired shape without the help of a mold, great
skill being required in the manipulation of the glass. Window glass is made by blowing large
hollow cylinders about 6 ft. long and 1-1/2 ft. in diameter. These are cut longitudinally,
and are then placed in an oven and heated until they soften, when they are flattened out into
plates (Fig. 75). Plate glass is cast into flat slabs, which are then ground and polished to
perfectly plane surfaces.

Varieties of glass. The ingredients mentioned above make a soft, easily fusible glass. If potassium
carbonate is substituted for the sodium carbonate, the glass is much harder and less easily
fused; increasing the amount of sand has somewhat the same effect. Potassium glass is largely
used in making chemical glassware, since it resists the action of reagents better than the
softer sodium glass. If lead oxide is substituted for the whole or a part of the lime, the
glass is very soft, but has a high index of refraction and is valuable for making optical instruments
and artificial jewels.

Coloring of glass. Various substances fused along with the glass mixture give characteristic
colors. The amber color of common bottles is due to iron compounds in the glass; in other cases
iron colors the glass green. Cobalt compounds color it deep blue; those of manganese give it
an amethyst tint and uranium compounds impart a peculiar yellowish green color. Since iron
is nearly always present in the ingredients, glass is usually slightly yellow. This color can
be removed by adding the proper amount of manganese dioxide, for the amethyst color of manganese
and the yellow of iron together produce white light.

Nature of glass. Glass is not a definite chemical compound and its composition varies between
wide limits. Fused glass is really a solution of various silicates, such as those of calcium
and lead, in fused sodium or potassium silicate. A certain amount of silicon dioxide is also
present. This solution is then allowed to solidify under such conditions of cooling that the
dissolved substances do not separate from the solvent. The compounds which are used to color
the glass are sometimes converted into silicates, which then dissolve in the glass, giving
it a uniform color. In other cases, as in the milky glasses which resemble porcelain in appearance,
the color or opaqueness is due to the finely divided color material evenly distributed throughout
the glass, but not dissolved in it. Milky glass is made by mixing calcium fluoride, tin oxide,
or some other insoluble substance in the melted glass. Copper or gold in metallic form scattered
through glass gives it shades of red.

TITANIUM

     Titanium is a very widely distributed element in nature, being
     found in almost all soils, in many rocks, and even in plant and
     animal tissues. It is not very abundant in any one locality,
     and it possesses little commercial value save in connection
     with the iron industry. Its most common ore is rutile
     (TiO{2}), which resembles silica in many respects.

     In both physical and chemical properties titanium resembles
     silicon, though it is somewhat more metallic in character. This
     resemblance is most marked in the acids of titanium. It not
     only forms metatitanic and orthotitanic acids but a great
     variety of polytitanic acids as well.

BORON

~Occurrence.~ Boron is never found free in nature. It occurs as boric acid (H{3}BO{3}), and
in salts of polyboric acids, which usually have very complicated formulas.

~Preparation and properties.~ Boron can be prepared from its oxide by reduction with magnesium,
exactly as in the case of silicon. It resembles silicon very strikingly in its properties.
It occurs in several allotropic forms, is very hard when crystallized, and is rather inactive
toward reagents. It forms a hydride, BH{3}, and combines directly with the elements of the
chlorine family. Boron fluoride (BF{3}) is very similar to silicon fluoride in its mode of
formation and chemical properties.

~Boric oxide~ (B{2}O{3}). Boron forms one well-known oxide, B{2}O{3}, called boric anhydride.
It is formed as a glassy mass by heating boric acid to a high temperature. It absorbs water
very readily, uniting with it to form boric acid again:

    B{2}O{3} + 3H{2}O = 2H{3}BO{3}.

In this respect it differs from silicon dioxide, which will not combine directly with water.

~Boric acid~ (H{3}BO{3}). This is found in nature in considerable quantities and forms one
of the chief sources of boron compounds. It is found dissolved in the water of hot springs
in some localities, particularly in Italy. Being volatile with steam, the vapor which escapes
from these springs has some boric acid in it. It is easily obtained from these sources by condensation
and evaporation, the necessary heat being supplied by other hot springs.

Boric acid crystallizes in pearly flakes, which are greasy to the touch. In the laboratory
it is easily prepared by treating a strong, hot solution of borax with sulphuric acid. Boric
acid being sparingly soluble in water crystallizes out on cooling:

    Na{2}B{4}O{7} + 5H{2}O + H{2}SO{4} = Na{2}SO{4} + 4H{3}BO{3}.

The substance is a mild antiseptic, and on this account is often used in medicine and as a
preservative for canned foods and milk.

~Metaboric and polyboric acids.~ When boric acid is gently heated it is converted into metaboric
acid (HBO{2}):

    H{3}BO{3} = HBO{2} + H{2}O.

On heating metaboric acid to a somewhat higher temperature tetraboric acid (H{2}B{4}O{7}) is
formed:

    4HBO{2} = H{2}B{4}O{7} + H{2}O.

Many other complex acids of boron are known.

~Borax.~ Borax is the sodium salt of tetraboric acid, having the formula Na{2}B{4}O{7}·10 H{2}O.
It is found in some arid countries, as southern California and Tibet, but is now made commercially
from the mineral colemanite, which is the calcium salt of a complex boric acid. When this is
treated with a solution of sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate is precipitated and borax crystallizes
from the solution.

When heated borax at first swells up greatly, owing to the expulsion of the water of crystallization,
and then melts to a clear glass. This glass has the property of easily dissolving many metallic
oxides, and on this account borax is used as a flux in soldering, for the purpose of removing
from the metallic surfaces to be soldered the film of oxide with which they are likely to be
covered. These oxides often give a characteristic color to the clear borax glass, and borax
beads are therefore often used in testing for the presence of metals, instead of the metaphosphoric
acid bead already described.

     The reason that metallic oxides dissolve in borax is that borax
     contains an excess of acid anhydride, as can be more easily
     seen if its formula is written 2NaBO{2} + B{2}O{3}. The
     metallic oxide combines with this excess of acid anhydride,
     forming a mixed salt of metaboric acid.

Borax is extensively used as a constituent of enamels and glazes for both metal ware and pottery.
It is also used as a flux in soldering and brazing, and in domestic ways it serves as a mild
alkali, as a preservative for meats, and in a great variety of less important applications.

EXERCISES

1. Account for the fact that a solution of borax in water is alkaline.

2. What weight of water of crystallization does 1 kg. of borax contain?

3. When a concentrated solution of borax acts on silver nitrate a borate of silver is formed.
If the solution of borax is dilute, however, an hydroxide of silver forms. Account for this
difference in behavior.

CHAPTER XXII

THE METALS

~The metals.~ The elements which remain to be considered are known collectively as the metals.
They are also called the base-forming elements, since their hydroxides are bases. A metal may
therefore be defined as an element whose hydroxide is a base. When a base dissolves in water
the hydroxyl groups form the anions, while the metallic element forms the cations. From this
standpoint a metal can be defined as an element capable of forming simple cations in solution.

The distinction between a metal and a non-metal is not a very sharp one, since the hydroxides
of a number of elements act as bases under some conditions and as acids under others. We have
seen that antimony is an element of this kind.

~Occurrence of metals in nature.~ A few of the metals are found in nature in the free state.
Among these are gold, platinum, and frequently copper. They are usually found combined with
other elements in the form of oxides or salts of various acids. Silicates, carbonates, sulphides,
and sulphates are the most abundant salts. All inorganic substances occurring in nature, whether
they contain a metal or not, are called minerals. Those minerals from which a useful substance
can be extracted are called ores of the substance. These two terms are most frequently used
in connection with the metals.

~Extraction of metals,--metallurgy.~ The process of extracting a metal from its ores is called
the metallurgy of the metal. The metallurgy of each metal presents peculiarities of its own,
but there are several methods of general application which are very frequently employed.

1. Reduction of an oxide with carbon. Many of the metals occur in nature in the form of oxides.
When these oxides are heated to a high temperature with carbon the oxygen combines with it
and the metal is set free. Iron, for example, occurs largely in the form of the oxide Fe{2}O{3}.
When this is heated with carbon the reaction expressed in the following equation takes place:

    Fe{2}O{3} + 3 C = 2 Fe + 3 CO.

Many ores other than oxides may be changed into oxides which can then be reduced by carbon.
The conversion of such ores into oxides is generally accomplished by heating, and this process
is called roasting. Many carbonates and hydroxides decompose directly into the oxide on heating.
Sulphides, on the other hand, must be heated in a current of air, the oxygen of the air entering
into the reaction. The following equations will serve to illustrate these changes in the case
of the ores of iron:

    FeCO{3} = FeO + CO{2},

    2Fe(OH){3} = Fe{2}O{3} + 3H{2}O,

    2FeS{2} + 11O = Fe{2}O{3} + 4SO{2}.

2. Reduction of an oxide with aluminium. Not all oxides, however, can be reduced by carbon.
In such cases aluminium may be used. Thus chromium may be obtained in accordance with the following
equation:

    Cr{2}O{3} + 2 Al = 2 Cr + Al{2}O{3}.

This method is a comparatively new one, having been brought into use by the German chemist
Goldschmidt; hence it is sometimes called the Goldschmidt method.

3. Electrolysis. In recent years increasing use is being made of the electric current in the
preparation of metals. In some cases the separation of the metal from its compounds is accomplished
by passing the current through a solution of a suitable salt of the metal, the metal usually
being deposited upon the cathode. In other cases the current is passed through a fused salt
of the metal, the chloride being best adapted to this purpose.

~Electro-chemical industries.~ Most of the electro-chemical industries of the country are carried
on where water power is abundant, since this furnishes the cheapest means for the generation
of electrical energy. Niagara Falls is the most important locality in this country for such
industries, and many different electro-chemical products are manufactured there. Some industries
depend upon electrolytic processes, while in others the electrical energy is used merely as
a source of heat in electric furnaces.

~Preparation of compounds of the metals.~ Since the compounds of the metals are so numerous
and varied in character, there are many ways of preparing them. In many cases the properties
of the substance to be prepared, or the material available for its preparation, suggest a rather
unusual way. There are, however, a number of general principles which are constantly applied
in the preparation of the compounds of the metals, and a clear understanding of them will save
much time and effort in remembering the details in any given case. The most important of these
general methods for the preparation of compounds are the following:

1. By direct union of two elements. This is usually accomplished by heating the two elements
together. Thus the sulphides, chlorides, and oxides of a metal can generally be obtained in
this way. The following equations serve as examples of this method:

    Fe + S = FeS,

    Mg + O = MgO,

    Cu + 2Cl = CuCl{2}.

2. By the decomposition of a compound. This decomposition may be brought about either by heat
alone or by the combined action of heat and a reducing agent. Thus when the nitrate of a metal
is heated the oxide of the metal is usually obtained. Copper nitrate, for example, decomposes
as follows:

    Cu(NO{3}){2} = CuO + 2NO{2} + O.

Similarly the carbonates of the metals yield oxides, thus:

    CaCO{3} = CaO + CO{2}.

Most of the hydroxides form an oxide and water when heated:

    2Al(OH){3} = Al{2}O{3} + 3H{2}O.

When heated with carbon, sulphates are reduced to sulphides, thus:

    BaSO{4} + 2C = BaS + 2CO{2}.

3. Methods based on equilibrium in solution. In the preparation of compounds the first requisite
is that the reactions chosen shall be of such a kind as will go on to completion. In the chapter
on chemical equilibrium it was shown that reactions in solution may become complete in either
of three ways: (1) a gas may be formed which escapes from solution; (2) an insoluble solid
may be formed which precipitates; (3) two different ions may combine to form undissociated
molecules. By the judicious selection of materials these principles may be applied to the preparation
of a great variety of compounds, and illustrations of such methods will very frequently be
found in the subsequent pages.

4. By fusion methods. It sometimes happens that substances which are insoluble in water and
in acids, and which cannot therefore be brought into double decomposition in the usual way,
are soluble in other liquids, and when dissolved in them can be decomposed and converted into
other desired compounds. Thus barium sulphate is not soluble in water, and sulphuric acid,
being less volatile than most other acids, cannot easily be driven out from this salt When
brought into contact with melted sodium carbonate, however, it dissolves in it, and since barium
carbonate is insoluble in melted sodium carbonate, double decomposition takes place:

    Na{2}CO{3} + BaSO{4} = BaCO{3} + Na{2}SO{4}.

On dissolving the cooled mixture in water the sodium sulphate formed in the reaction, together
with any excess of sodium carbonate which may be present, dissolves. The barium carbonate can
then be filtered off and converted into any desired salt by the processes already described.

5. By the action of metals on salts of other metals. When a strip of zinc is placed in a solution
of a copper salt the copper is precipitated and an equivalent quantity of zinc passes into
solution:

    Zn + CuSO{4} = Cu + ZnSO{4}.

In like manner copper will precipitate silver from its salts:

    Cu + Ag{2}SO{4} = 2Ag + CuSO{4}.

It is possible to tabulate the metals in such a way that any one of them in the table will
precipitate any one following it from its salts. The following is a list of some of the commoner
metals arranged in this way:

    Zinc
    Iron
    Tin
    Lead
    Copper
    Bismuth
    Mercury
    Silver
    Gold

According to this table copper will precipitate bismuth, mercury, silver, or gold from their
salts, and will in turn be precipitated by zinc, iron, tin, or lead. Advantage is taken of
this principle in the purification of some of the metals, and occasionally in the preparation
of metals and their compounds.

~Important insoluble compounds.~ Since precipitates play so important a part in the reactions
which substances undergo, as well as in the preparation of many chemical compounds, it is important
to know what substances are insoluble. Knowing this, we can in many cases predict reactions
under certain conditions, and are assisted in devising ways to prepare desired compounds. While
there is no general rule which will enable one to foretell the solubility of any given compound,
nevertheless a few general statements can be made which will be of much assistance.

1. Hydroxides. All hydroxides are insoluble save those of ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium,
barium, and strontium.

2. Nitrates. All nitrates are soluble in water.

3. Chlorides. All chlorides are soluble save silver and mercurous chlorides. (Lead chloride
is but slightly soluble.)

4. Sulphates. All sulphates are soluble save those of barium, strontium, and lead. (Sulphates
of silver and calcium are only moderately soluble.)

5. Sulphides. All sulphides are insoluble save those of ammonium, sodium, and potassium. The
sulphides of calcium, barium, strontium, and magnesium are insoluble in water, but are changed
by hydrolysis into acid sulphides which are soluble. On this account they cannot be prepared
by precipitation.

6. Carbonates, phosphates, and silicates. All normal carbonates, phosphates, and silicates
are insoluble save those of ammonium, sodium and potassium.

EXERCISES

1. Write equations representing four different ways for preparing Cu(NO{3}){2}.

2. Write equations representing six different ways for preparing ZnSO{4}.

3. Write equations for two reactions to illustrate each of the three ways in which reactions
in solutions may become complete.

4. Give one or more methods for preparing each of the following compounds: CaCl{2}, PbCl{2},
BaSO{4}, CaCO{3}, (NH{4}){2}S, Ag{2}S, PbO, Cu(OH){2} (for solubilities, see last paragraph
of chapter). State in each case the general principle involved in the method of preparation chosen.

=================================================================

~The family.~ The metals listed in the above table constitute the even family in Group I in
the periodic arrangement of the elements, and therefore form a natural family. The name alkali
metals is commonly applied to the family for the reason that the hydroxides of the most familiar
members of the family, namely sodium and potassium, have long been called alkalis.

1. Occurrence. While none of these metals occur free in nature, their compounds are very widely
distributed, being especially abundant in sea and mineral waters, in salt beds, and in many
rocks. Only sodium and potassium occur in abundance, the others being rarely found in any considerable
quantity.

2. Preparation. The metals are most conveniently prepared by the electrolysis of their fused
hydroxides or chlorides, though it is possible to prepare them by reducing their oxides or
carbonates with carbon.

3. Properties. They are soft, light metals, having low melting points and small densities,
as is indicated in the table. Their melting points vary inversely with their atomic weights,
while their densities (sodium excepted) vary directly with these. The pure metals have a silvery
luster but tarnish at once when exposed to the air, owing to the formation of a film of oxide
upon the surface of the metal. They are therefore preserved in some liquid, such as coal oil,
which contains no oxygen. Because of their strong affinity for oxygen they decompose water
with great ease, forming hydroxides and liberating hydrogen in accordance with the equation

    M + H{2}O = MOH + H,

where M stands for any one of these metals. These hydroxides are white solids; they are readily
soluble in water and possess very strong basic properties. These bases are nearly equal in
strength, that is, they all dissociate in water to about the same extent.

4. Compounds. The alkali metals almost always act as univalent elements in the formation of
compounds, the composition of which can be represented by such formulas as MH, MCl, MNO{3},
M{2}SO{4}, M{3}PO{4}. These compounds, when dissolved in water, dissociate in such a way as
to form simple, univalent metallic ions which are colorless. With the exception of lithium
these metals form very few insoluble compounds, so that it is not often that precipitates containing
them are obtained. Only sodium and potassium will be studied in detail, since the other metals
of the family are of relatively small importance.

The compounds of sodium and potassium are so similar in properties that they can be used interchangeably
for most purposes. Other things being equal, the sodium compounds are prepared in preference
to those of potassium, since they are cheaper. When a given sodium compound is deliquescent,
or is so soluble that it is difficult to purify, the corresponding potassium compound is prepared
in its stead, provided its properties are more desirable in these respects.

SODIUM

~Occurrence in nature.~ Large deposits of sodium chloride have been found in various parts
of the world, and the water of the ocean and of many lakes and springs contains notable quantities
of it. The element also occurs as a constituent of many rocks and is therefore present in the
soil formed by their disintegration. The mineral cryolite (Na{3}AlF{6}) is an important substance,
and the nitrate, carbonate, and borate also occur in nature.

~Preparation.~ In 1807 Sir Humphry Davy succeeded in preparing very small quantities of metallic
sodium by the electrolysis of the fused hydroxide. On account of the cost of electrical energy
it was for many years found more economical to prepare it by reducing the carbonate with carbon
in accordance with the following equation:

    Na{2}CO{3} + 2C = 2Na + 3CO.

The cost of generating the electric current has been diminished to such an extent, however,
that it is now more economical to prepare sodium by Davy's original method, namely, by the
electrolysis of the fused hydroxide or chloride. When the chloride is used the process is difficult
to manage, owing to the higher temperature required to keep the electrolyte fused, and because
of the corroding action of the fused chloride upon the containing vessel.

     ~Technical preparation.~ The sodium hydroxide is melted in a
     cylindrical iron vessel (Fig. 76) through the bottom of which
     rises the cathode K. The anodes A, several in number, are
     suspended around the cathode from above. A cylindrical vessel
     C floats in the fused alkali directly over the cathode, and
     under this cap the sodium and hydrogen liberated at the cathode
     collect. The hydrogen escapes by lifting the cover, and the
     sodium, protected from the air by the hydrogen, is skimmed or
     drained off from time to time. Oxygen is set free upon the
     anode and escapes into the air through the openings O without
     coming into contact with the sodium or hydrogen. This process
     is carried on extensively at Niagara Falls.

~Properties.~ Sodium is a silver-white metal about as heavy as water, and so soft that it can
be molded easily by the fingers or pressed into wire. It is very active chemically, combining
with most of the non-metallic elements, such as oxygen and chlorine, with great energy. It
will often withdraw these elements from combination with other elements, and is thus able to
decompose water and the oxides and chlorides of many metals.

~Sodium peroxide~ (NaO). Since sodium is a univalent element we should expect it to form an
oxide of the formula Na{2}O. While such an oxide can be prepared, the peroxide (NaO) is much
better known. It is a yellowish-white powder made by burning sodium in air. Its chief use is
as an oxidizing agent. When heated with oxidizable substances it gives up a part of its oxygen,
as shown in the equation

    2NaO = Na{2}O + O.

Water decomposes it in accordance with the equation

    2NaO + 2H{2}O = 2NaOH + H{2}O{2}.

Acids act readily upon it, forming a sodium salt and hydrogen peroxide:

    2NaO + 2HCl = 2NaCl + H{2}O{2}.

In these last two reactions the hydrogen dioxide formed may decompose into water and oxygen
if the temperature is allowed to rise:

    H{2}O{2} = H{2}O + O.

     ~Peroxides.~ It will be remembered that barium dioxide (BaO{2})
     yields hydrogen dioxide when treated with acids, and that
     manganese dioxide gives up oxygen when heated with sulphuric
     acid. Oxides which yield either hydrogen dioxide or oxygen when
     treated with water or an acid are called peroxides.

~Sodium hydroxide~ (caustic soda) (NaOH). 1. Preparation. Sodium hydroxide is prepared commercially
by several processes.

(a) In the older process, still in extensive use, sodium carbonate is treated with calcium
hydroxide suspended in water. Calcium carbonate is precipitated according to the equation

    Na{2}CO{3} + Ca(OH){2} = CaCO{3} + 2NaOH.

The dilute solution of sodium hydroxide, filtered from the calcium carbonate, is evaporated
to a paste and is then poured into molds to solidify. It is sold in the form of slender sticks.

(b) The newer methods depend upon the electrolysis of sodium chloride. In the Castner process
a solution of salt is electrolyzed, the reaction being expressed as follows:

    NaCl + H{2}O = NaOH + H + Cl.

The chlorine escapes as a gas, and by an ingenious mechanical device the sodium hydroxide is
prevented from mixing with the salt in the solution.

In the Acker process the electrolyte is fused sodium chloride. The chlorine is evolved as a
gas at the anode, while the sodium alloys with the melted lead which forms the cathode. When
this alloy is treated with water the following reaction takes place:

    Na + H{2}O = NaOH + H.

~Technical process.~ A sketch of an Acker furnace is represented in Fig. 77. The furnace is
an irregularly shaped cast-iron box, divided into three compartments, A, B, and C. Compartment
A is lined with magnesia brick. Compartments B and C are filled with melted lead, which also
covers the bottom of A to a depth of about an inch. Above this layer in A is fused salt, into
which dip carbon anodes D. The metallic box and melted lead is the cathode.

     When the furnace is in operation chlorine is evolved at the
     anodes, and is drawn away through a pipe (not represented) to
     the bleaching-powder chambers. Sodium is set free at the
     surface of the melted lead in A, and at once alloys with it.
     Through the pipe E a powerful jet of steam is driven through
     the lead in B upwards into the narrow tube F. This forces
     the lead alloy up through the tube and over into the chamber
     G.

     In this process the steam is decomposed by the sodium in the
     alloy, forming melted sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. The melted
     lead and sodium hydroxide separate into two layers in G, and
     the sodium hydroxide, being on top, overflows into tanks from
     which it is drawn off and packed in metallic drums. The lead is
     returned to the other compartments of the furnace by a pipe
     leading from H to I. Compartment C serves merely as a
     reservoir for excess of melted lead.

2. Properties. Sodium hydroxide is a white, crystalline, brittle substance which rapidly absorbs
water and carbon dioxide from the air. As the name (caustic soda) indicates, it is a very corrosive
substance, having a disintegrating action on most animal and vegetable tissues. It is a strong
base. It is used in a great many chemical industries, and under the name of lye is employed
to a small extent as a cleansing agent for household purposes.

~Sodium chloride~ (common salt) (NaCl). 1. Preparation. Sodium chloride, or common salt, is
very widely distributed in nature. Thick strata, evidently deposited at one time by the evaporation
of salt water, are found in many places. In the United States the most important localities
for salt are New York, Michigan, Ohio, and Kansas. Sometimes the salt is mined, especially
if it is in the pure form called rock salt. More frequently a strong brine is pumped from deep
wells sunk into the salt deposit, and is then evaporated in large pans until the salt crystallizes
out. The crystals are in the form of small cubes and contain no water of crystallization; some
water is, however, held in cavities in the crystals and causes the salt to decrepitate when heated.

2. Uses. Since salt is so abundant in nature it forms the starting point in the preparation
of all compounds containing either sodium or chlorine. This includes many substances of the
highest importance to civilization, such as soap, glass, hydrochloric acid, soda, and bleaching
powder. Enormous quantities of salt are therefore produced each year. Small quantities are
essential to the life of man and animals. Pure salt does not absorb moisture; the fact that
ordinary salt becomes moist in air is not due to a property of the salt, but to impurities
commonly occurring in it, especially calcium and magnesium chlorides.

~Sodium sulphate~ (Glauber's salt) (Na{2}SO{4}·10H{2}O). This salt is prepared by the action
of sulphuric acid upon sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid being formed at the same time:

    2NaCl + H{2}SO{4} = Na{2}SO{4} + 2HCl.

Some sodium sulphate is prepared by the reaction represented in the equation

    MgSO{4} + 2NaCl = Na{2}SO{4} + MgCl{2}.

The magnesium sulphate required for this reaction is obtained in large quantities in the manufacture
of potassium chloride, and being of little value for any other purpose is used in this way.
The reaction depends upon the fact that sodium sulphate is the least soluble of any of the
four factors in the equation, and therefore crystallizes out when hot, saturated solutions
of magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride are mixed together and the resulting mixture cooled.

Sodium sulphate forms large efflorescent crystals. The salt is extensively used in the manufacture
of sodium carbonate and glass. Small quantities are used in medicine.

~Sodium sulphite~ (Na{2}SO{3}·7H{2}O). Sodium sulphite is prepared by the action of sulphur
dioxide upon solutions of sodium hydroxide, the reaction being analogous to the action of carbon
dioxide upon sodium hydroxide. Like the carbonate, the sulphite is readily decomposed by acids:

    Na{2}SO{3} + 2HCl = 2NaCl + H{2}O + SO{2}.

Because of this reaction sodium sulphite is used as a convenient source of sulphur dioxide.
It is also used as a disinfectant and a preservative.

~Sodium thiosulphate~ (hyposulphite of soda or "hypo") (Na{2}S{2}O{3}·5H{2}O). This salt, commonly
called sodium hyposulphite, or merely hypo, is made by boiling a solution of sodium sulphite
with sulphur:

    Na{2}SO{3} + S = Na{2}S{2}O{3}.

It is used in photography and in the bleaching industry, to absorb the excess of chlorine which
is left upon the bleached fabrics.

     ~Thio compounds.~ The prefix "thio" means sulphur. It is used to
     designate substances which may be regarded as derived from
     oxygen compounds by replacing the whole or a part of their
     oxygen with sulphur. The thiosulphates may be regarded as
     sulphates in which one atom of oxygen has been replaced by an
     atom of sulphur. This may be seen by comparing the formula
     Na{2}SO{4} (sodium sulphate) with the formula
     Na{2}S{2}O{3} (sodium thiosulphate).

~Sodium carbonate~ (sal soda)(Na{2}CO{3}·10H{2}O). There are two different methods now employed
in the manufacture of this important substance.

1. Le Blanc process. This older process involves several distinct reactions, as shown in the
following equations.

(c) The sodium sulphide is then heated with calcium carbonate, when double decomposition takes
place:

    Na{2}S + CaCO{3} = CaS + Na{2}CO{3}.

     ~Technical preparation of sodium carbonate.~ In a manufacturing
     plant the last two reactions take place in one process. Sodium
     sulphate, coal, and powdered limestone are heated together to a
     rather high temperature. The coal reduces the sulphate to
     sulphide, which in turn reacts upon the calcium carbonate. Some
     limestone is decomposed by the heat, forming calcium oxide.
     When treated with water the calcium oxide is changed into
     hydroxide, and this prevents the water from decomposing the
     insoluble calcium sulphide.

     The crude product of the process is a hard black cake called
     black ash. On digesting this mass with water the sodium
     carbonate passes into solution. The pure carbonate is obtained
     by evaporation of this solution, crystallizing from it in
     crystals of the formula Na{2}CO{3}·10H{2}O. Since over 60%
     of this salt is water, the crystals are sometimes heated until
     it is driven off. The product is called calcined soda, and is,
     of course, more valuable than the crystallized salt.

2. Solvay process. This more modern process depends upon the reactions represented in the equations

    NaCl + NH{4}HCO{3} = NaHCO{3} + NH{4}Cl,

    2NaHCO{3} = Na{2}CO{3} + H{2}O + CO{2}.

The reason the first reaction takes place is that sodium hydrogen carbonate is sparingly soluble
in water, while the other compounds are freely soluble. When strong solutions of sodium chloride
and of ammonium hydrogen carbonate are brought together the sparingly soluble sodium hydrogen
carbonate is precipitated. This is converted into the normal carbonate by heating, the reaction
being represented in the second equation.

     ~Technical preparation.~ In the Solvay process a very
     concentrated solution of salt is first saturated with ammonia
     gas, and a current of carbon dioxide is then conducted into the
     solution. In this way ammonium hydrogen carbonate is formed:

     NH{3} + H{2}O + CO{2} = NH{4}HCO{3}.

     This enters into double decomposition with the salt, as shown
     in the first equation under the Solvay process. After the
     sodium hydrogen carbonate has been precipitated the mother
     liquors containing ammonium chloride are treated with lime:

     2NH{4}Cl + CaO = CaCl{2} + 2 NH{3} + H{2}O.

     The lime is obtained by burning limestone:

     CaCO{3} = CaO + CO{2}.

     The ammonia and carbon dioxide evolved in the latter two
     reactions are used in the preparation of an additional quantity
     of ammonium hydrogen carbonate. It will thus be seen that there
     is no loss of ammonia. The only materials permanently used up
     are calcium carbonate and salt, while the only waste product is
     calcium chloride.

     ~Historical.~ In former times sodium carbonate was made by
     burning seaweeds and extracting the carbonate from their ash.
     On this account the salt was called soda ash, and the name is
     still in common use. During the French Revolution this supply
     was cut off, and in behalf of the French government Le Blanc
     made a study of methods of preparing the carbonate directly
     from salt. As a result he devised the method which bears his
     name, and which was used exclusively for many years. It has
     been replaced to a large extent by the Solvay process, which
     has the advantage that the materials used are inexpensive, and
     that the ammonium hydrogen carbonate used can be regenerated
     from the products formed in the process. Much expense is also
     saved in fuel, and the sodium hydrogen carbonate, which is the
     first product of the process, has itself many commercial uses.
     The Le Blanc process is still used, however, since the
     hydrochloric acid generated is of value.

     ~By-products.~ The substances obtained in a given process, aside
     from the main product, are called the by-products. The success
     of many processes depends upon the value of the by-products
     formed.

     Thus hydrochloric acid, a by-product in the Le Blanc process,
     is valuable enough to make the process pay, even though sodium
     carbonate can be made cheaper in other ways.

~Properties of sodium carbonate.~ Sodium carbonate forms large crystals of the formula Na{2}CO{3}
· 10 H{2}O. It has a mild alkaline reaction and is used for laundry purposes under the name
of washing soda. Mere mention of the fact that it is used in the manufacture of glass, soap,
and many chemical reagents will indicate its importance in the industries. It is one of the
few soluble carbonates.

~Sodium hydrogen carbonate~ (bicarbonate of soda) (NaHCO{3}). This salt, commonly called bicarbonate
of soda, or baking soda, is made by the Solvay process, as explained above, or by passing carbon
dioxide into strong solutions of sodium carbonate:

    Na{2}CO{3} + H{2}O + CO{2} = 2NaHCO{3}.

The bicarbonate, being sparingly soluble, crystallizes out. A mixture of the bicarbonate with
some substance (the compound known as cream of tartar is generally used) which slowly reacts
with it, liberating carbon dioxide, is used largely in baking. The carbon dioxide generated
forces its way through the dough, thus making it porous and light.

~Sodium nitrate~ (Chili saltpeter) (NaNO{3}). This substance is found in nature in arid regions
in a number of places, where it has been formed apparently by the decay of organic substances
in the presence of air and sodium salts. The largest deposits are in Chili, and most of the
nitrate of commerce comes from that country. Smaller deposits occur in California and Nevada.
The commercial salt is prepared by dissolving the crude nitrate in water, allowing the insoluble
earthy materials to settle, and evaporating the clear solution so obtained to crystallization.
The soluble impurities remain for the most part in the mother liquors.

Since this salt is the only nitrate found extensively in nature, it is the material from which
other nitrates as well as nitric acid are prepared. It is used in enormous quantities in the
manufacture of sulphuric acid and potassium nitrate, and as a fertilizer. Since phosphoric
acid has three replaceable hydrogen atoms, three sodium phosphates are possible,--two acid
salts and one normal. All three can be made without difficulty, but disodium phosphate is the
only one which is largely used, and is the salt which is commonly called sodium phosphate.
It is made by the action of phosphoric acid on sodium carbonate:

    Na{2}CO{3} + H{3}PO{4} = Na{2}HPO{4} + CO{2} + H{2}O.

It is interesting as being one of the few phosphates which are soluble in water, and is the
salt commonly used when a soluble phosphate is needed.

~Normal sodium phosphate~ (Na{3}PO{4}). Although this is a normal salt its solution has a strongly
alkaline reaction. This is due to the fact that the salt hydrolyzes in solution into sodium
hydroxide and disodium phosphate, as represented in the equation

    Na{3}PO{4} + H{2}O = Na{2}HPO{4} + NaOH.

Sodium hydroxide is strongly alkaline, while disodium phosphate is nearly neutral in reaction.
The solution as a whole is therefore alkaline. The salt is prepared by adding a large excess
of sodium hydroxide to a solution of disodium phosphate and evaporating to crystallization.
The excess of the sodium hydroxide reverses the reaction of hydrolysis and the normal salt
crystallizes out.

~Sodium tetraborate ~(borax) (Na{2}B{4}O{7}·10H{2}O). The properties of this important compound
have been discussed under the head of boron.

POTASSIUM

~Occurrence in nature.~ Potassium is a constituent of many common rocks and minerals, and is
therefore a rather abundant element, though not so abundant as sodium. Feldspar, which occurs
both by itself and as a constituent of granite, contains considerable potassium. The element
is a constituent of all clay and of mica and also occurs in very large deposits at Stassfurt,
Germany, in the form of the chloride and sulphate, associated with compounds of sodium and
magnesium. In small quantities it is found as nitrate and in many other forms.

The natural decomposition of rocks containing potassium gives rise to various compounds of
the element in all fertile soils. Its soluble compounds are absorbed by growing plants and
built up into complex vegetable substances; when these are burned the potassium remains in
the ash in the form of the carbonate. Crude carbonate obtained from wood ashes was formerly
the chief source of potassium compounds; they are now mostly prepared from the salts of the
Stassfurt deposits.

     ~Stassfurt salts.~ These salts form very extensive deposits in
     middle and north Germany, the most noted locality for working
     them being at Stassfurt. The deposits are very thick and rest
     upon an enormous layer of common salt. They are in the form of
     a series of strata, each consisting largely of a single mineral
     salt. A cross section of these deposits is shown in Fig. 78.
     While these strata are salts from a chemical standpoint, they
     are as solid and hard as many kinds of stone, and are mined as
     stone or coal would be. Since the strata differ in general
     appearance, each can be mined separately, and the various
     minerals can be worked up by methods adapted to each particular
     case. The chief minerals of commercial importance in these
     deposits are the following:

        Sylvine       KCl.
        Anhydrite     CaSO{4}.
        Carnallite    KCl·MgCl{2}·6H{2}O.
        Kainite       K{2}SO{4}·MgSO{4}·MgCl{2}·6H{2}O.
        Polyhalite    K{2}SO{4}·MgSO{4}·2CaSO{4}·2H{2}O.
        Kieserite     MgSO{4}·H{2}O.
        Schönite      K{2}SO{4}·MgSO{4}·6H{2}O.

~Preparation and properties.~ The metal is prepared by the same method used in the preparation
of sodium. In most respects it is very similar to sodium, the chief difference being that it
is even more energetic in its action upon other substances. The freshly cut, bright surface
instantly becomes dim through oxidation by the air. It decomposes water very vigorously, the
heat of reaction being sufficient to ignite the hydrogen evolved. It is somewhat lighter than
sodium and is preserved under gasoline.

~Potassium hydroxide~ (caustic potash) (KOH). Potassium hydroxide is prepared by methods exactly
similar to those used in the preparation of sodium hydroxide, which compound it closely resembles
in both physical and chemical properties. It is not used to any very great extent, being replaced
by the cheaper sodium hydroxide.

~Action of the halogen elements on potassium hydroxide.~ When any one of the three halogen
elements--chlorine, bromine, and iodine--is added to a solution of potassium hydroxide a reaction
takes place, the nature of which depends upon the conditions of the experiment. Thus, when
chlorine is passed into a cold dilute solution of potassium hydroxide the reaction expressed
by the following equation takes place:

    (1) 2KOH + 2Cl = KCl + KClO + H{2}O.

If the solution of hydroxide is concentrated and hot, on the other hand, the potassium hypochlorite
formed according to equation (1) breaks down as fast as formed:

    (2) 3KClO = KClO{3} + 2KCl.

Equation (1), after being multiplied by 3, may be combined with equation (2), giving the following:

    (3) 6KOH + 6Cl = 5KCl + KClO{3} + 3H{2}O.

This represents in a single equation the action of chlorine on hot, concentrated solutions
of potassium hydroxide. By means of these reactions one can prepare potassium chloride, potassium
hypochlorite, and potassium chlorate. By substituting bromine or iodine for chlorine the corresponding
compounds of these elements are obtained. Some of these compounds can be obtained in cheaper ways.

If the halogen element is added to a solution of sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide, the
reaction which takes place is exactly similar to that which takes place with potassium hydroxide.
It is possible, therefore, to prepare in this way the sodium and calcium compounds corresponding
to the potassium compounds given above.

~Potassium chloride~ (KCl). This salt occurs in nature in sea water, in the mineral sylvine,
and, combined with magnesium chloride, as carnallite (KCl·MgCl{2}·6H{2}O). It is prepared from
carnallite by saturating boiling water with the mineral and allowing the solution to cool.
The mineral decomposes while in solution, and the potassium chloride crystallizes out on cooling,
while the very soluble magnesium chloride remains in solution. The salt is very similar to
sodium chloride both in physical and chemical properties. It is used in the preparation of
nearly all other potassium salts, and, together with potassium sulphate, is used as a fertilizer.

~Potassium bromide~ (KBr). When bromine is added to a hot concentrated solution of potassium
hydroxide there is formed a mixture of potassium bromide and potassium bromate in accordance
with the reactions already discussed. There is no special use for the bromate, so the solution
is evaporated to dryness, and the residue, consisting of a mixture of the bromate and bromide,
is strongly heated. This changes the bromate to bromide, as follows:

    KBrO{3} = KBr +3O.

The bromide is then crystallized from water, forming large colorless crystals. It is used in
medicine and in photography.

~Potassium iodide~ (KI). Potassium iodide may be made by exactly the same method as has just
been described for the bromide, substituting iodine for bromine. It is more frequently made
as follows. Iron filings are treated with iodine, forming the compound Fe{3}I{8}; on boiling
this substance with potassium carbonate the reaction represented in the following equation occurs:

    Fe{3}I{8} + 4K{2}CO{3} = Fe{3}O{4} + 8KI + 4CO{2}.

Potassium iodide finds its chief use in medicine.

~Potassium chlorate~ (KClO{3}). This salt, as has just been explained, can be made by the action
of chlorine on strong potassium hydroxide solutions. The chief use of potassium chlorate is
as an oxidizing agent in the manufacture of matches, fireworks, and explosives; it is also
used in the preparation of oxygen and in medicine.

     ~Commercial preparation.~ By referring to the reaction between
     chlorine and hot concentrated solutions of potassium hydroxide,
     it will be seen that only one molecule of potassium chlorate is
     formed from six molecules of potassium hydroxide. Partly
     because of this poor yield and partly because the potassium
     hydroxide is rather expensive, this process is not an
     economical one for the preparation of potassium chlorate. The
     commercial method is the following. Chlorine is passed into hot
     solutions of calcium hydroxide, a compound which is very cheap.
     The resulting calcium chloride and chlorate are both very
     soluble. To the solution of these salts potassium chloride is
     added, and as the solution cools the sparingly soluble
     potassium chlorate crystallizes out:

          Ca(ClO{3}){2} + 2KCl = 2KClO{3} + CaCl{2}.

     Electro-chemical processes are also used.

~Potassium nitrate~ (saltpeter) (KNO{3}). This salt was formerly made by allowing animal refuse
to decompose in the open air in the presence of wood ashes or earthy materials containing potassium.
Under these conditions the nitrogen in the organic matter is in part converted into potassium
nitrate, which was obtained by extracting the mass with water and evaporating to crystallization.
This crude and slow process is now almost entirely replaced by a manufacturing process in which
the potassium salt is made from Chili saltpeter:

    NaNO{3} + KCl = NaCl + KNO{3}.

This process has been made possible by the discovery of the Chili niter beds and the potassium
chloride of the Stassfurt deposits.

     The reaction depends for its success upon the apparently
     insignificant fact that sodium chloride is almost equally
     soluble in cold and hot water. All four factors in the equation
     are rather soluble in cold water, but in hot water sodium
     chloride is far less soluble than the other three. When hot
     saturated solutions of sodium nitrate and potassium chloride
     are brought together, sodium chloride precipitates and can be
     filtered off, leaving potassium nitrate in solution, together
     with some sodium chloride. On cooling, potassium nitrate
     crystallizes out, leaving small amounts of the other salts in
     solution.

Potassium nitrate is a colorless salt which forms very large crystals. It is stable in the
air, and when heated is a good oxidizing agent, giving up oxygen quite readily. Its chief use
is in the manufacture of gunpowder.

     ~Gunpowder.~ The object sought for in the preparation of
     gunpowder is to secure a solid substance which will remain
     unchanged under ordinary conditions, but which will explode
     readily when ignited, evolving a large volume of gas. When a
     mixture of carbon and potassium nitrate is ignited a great deal
     of gas is formed, as will be seen from the equation

         2KNO{3} + 3C = CO{2} + CO + N{2} + K{2}CO{3}.

     By adding sulphur to the mixture the volume of gas formed in
     the explosion is considerably increased:

         2KNO{3} + 3C + S = 3CO{2} + N{2} + K{2}S.

     Gunpowder is simply a mechanical mixture of these three
     substances in the proportion required for the above reaction.
     While the equation represents the principal reaction, other
     reactions also take place. The gases formed in the explosion,
     when measured under standard conditions, occupy about two
     hundred and eighty times the volume of the original powder.
     Potassium sulphide (K{2}S) is a solid substance, and it is
     largely due to it that gunpowder gives off smoke and soot when
     it explodes. Smokeless powder consists of organic substances
     which, on explosion, give only colorless gases, and hence
     produce no smoke. Sodium nitrate is cheaper than potassium
     nitrate, but it is not adapted to the manufacture of the best
     grades of powder, since it is somewhat deliquescent and does
     not give up its oxygen so readily as does potassium nitrate. It
     is used, however, in the cheaper grades of powder, such as are
     employed for blasting.

~Potassium cyanide~ (KCN). When animal matter containing nitrogen is heated with iron and potassium
carbonate, complicated changes occur which result in the formation of a substance commonly
called yellow prussiate of potash, which has the formula K{4}FeC{6}N{6}. When this substance
is heated with potassium, potassium cyanide is formed:

    K{4}FeC{6}N{6} + 2 K = 6KCN + Fe.

Since sodium is much cheaper than potassium it is often used in place of it:

    K{4}FeC{6}N{6} + 2Na = 4KCN + 2NaCN + Fe.

The mixture of cyanides so resulting serves most of the purposes of the pure salt. It is used
very extensively in several metallurgical processes, particularly in the extraction of gold.
Potassium cyanide is a white solid characterized by its poisonous properties, and must be used
with extreme caution.

~Potassium carbonate~ (potash) (K{2}CO{3}). This compound occurs in wood ashes in small quantities.
It cannot be prepared by the Solvay process, since the acid carbonate is quite soluble in water,
but is made by the Le Blanc process. Its chief use is in the manufacture of other potassium salts.

~Other salts of potassium.~ Among the other salts of potassium frequently met with are the
sulphate (K{2}SO{4}), the acid carbonate (KHCO{3}), the acid sulphate (KHSO{4}), and the acid
sulphite (KHSO{3}). These are all white solids.

LITHIUM, RUBIDIUM, CÆSIUM

Of the three remaining elements of the family--lithium, rubidium, and cæsium--lithium is by
far the most common, the other two being very rare. Lithium chloride and carbonate are not
infrequently found in natural mineral waters, and as these substances are supposed to increase
the medicinal value of the water, they are very often added to artificial mineral waters in
small quantities.

COMPOUNDS OF AMMONIUM

~General.~ As explained in a previous chapter, when ammonia is passed into water the two compounds
combine to form the base NH{4}OH, known as ammonium hydroxide. When this base is neutralized
with acids there are formed the corresponding salts, known as the ammonium salts. Since the
ammonium group is univalent, ammonium salts resemble those of the alkali metals in formulas;
they also resemble the latter salts very much in their chemical properties, and may be conveniently
described in connection with them. Among the ammonium salts the chloride, sulphate, carbonate,
and sulphide are the most familiar.

~Ammonium chloride~ (sal ammoniac) (NH{4}Cl). This substance is obtained by neutralizing ammonium
hydroxide with hydrochloric acid. It is a colorless substance crystallizing in fine needles,
and, like most ammonium salts, is very soluble in water. When placed in a tube and heated strongly
it decomposes into hydrochloric acid and ammonia. When these gases reach a cooler portion of
the tube they at once recombine, and the resulting ammonium chloride is deposited on the sides
of the tube. In this way the salt can be separated from nonvolatile impurities. Ammonium chloride
is sometimes used in preparation of ammonia; it is also used in making dry batteries and in
the laboratory as a chemical reagent.

~Ammonium sulphate~ ((NH{4}){2}SO{4}). This salt resembles the chloride very closely, and,
being cheaper, is used in place of it when possible. It is used in large quantity as a fertilizer,
the nitrogen which it contains being a very valuable food for plants.

~Ammonium carbonate~ ((NH{4}){2}CO{3}). This salt, as well as the acid carbonate (NH{4}HCO{3}),
is used as a chemical reagent. They are colorless solids, freely soluble in water. The normal
carbonate is made by heating ammonium chloride with powdered limestone (calcium carbonate),
the ammonium carbonate being obtained as a sublimate in compact hard masses:

    2NH{4}Cl + CaCO{3} = (NH{4}){2}CO{3} + CaCl{2}.

The salt always smells of ammonia, since it slowly decomposes, as shown in the equation

    (NH{4}){2}CO{3} = NH{4}HCO{3} + NH{3}.

The acid carbonate, or bicarbonate, is prepared by saturating a solution of ammonium hydroxide
with carbon dioxide:

    NH{4}OH + CO{2} = NH{4}HCO{3}.

It is a well-crystallized stable substance.

~Ammonium sulphide~ ((NH{4}){2}S). Ammonium sulphide is prepared by the action of hydrosulphuric
acid upon ammonium hydroxide:

    2NH{4}OH + H{2}S = (NH{4}){2}S + 2H{2}O.

If the action is allowed to continue until no more hydrosulphuric acid is absorbed, the product
is the acid sulphide, sometimes called the hydrosulphide:

    NH{4}OH + H{2}S = NH{4}HS + H{2}O.

If equal amounts of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium acid sulphide are brought together, the
normal sulphide is formed:

    NH{4}OH + NH{4}HS = (NH{4}){2}S + H{2}O

It has been obtained in the solid state, but only with great difficulty. As used in the laboratory
it is always in the form of a solution. It is much used in the process of chemical analysis
because it is a soluble sulphide and easily prepared. On exposure to the air ammonium sulphide
slowly decomposes, being converted into ammonia, water, and sulphur:

    (NH{4}){2}S + O = 2NH{3} + H{2}O + S.

As fast as the sulphur is liberated it combines with the unchanged sulphide to form several
different ammonium sulphides in which there are from two to five sulphur atoms in the molecule,
thus: (NH{4}){2}S{2}, (NH{4}){2}S{3}, (NH{4}){2}S{5}. These sulphides in turn decompose by
further action of oxygen, so that the final products of the reaction are those given in the
equation. A solution of these compounds is yellow and is sometimes called yellow ammonium sulphide.

     FLAME REACTION--SPECTROSCOPE

     When compounds of either sodium or potassium are brought into
     the non-luminous flame of a Bunsen burner the flame becomes
     colored. Sodium compounds color it intensely yellow, while
     those of potassium color it pale violet. When only one of these
     elements is present it is easy to identify it by this simple
     test, but when both are present the intense color of the sodium
     flame entirely conceals the pale tint characteristic of
     potassium compounds.

     It is possible to detect the potassium flame in such cases,
     however, in the following way. When light is allowed to shine
     through a very small hole or slit in some kind of a screen,
     such as a piece of metal, upon a triangular prism of glass, the
     light is bent or refracted out of its course instead of passing
     straight through the glass. It thus comes out of the prism at
     some angle to the line at which it entered. Yellow light is
     bent more than red, and violet more than yellow. When light
     made up of the yellow of sodium and the violet of potassium
     shines through a slit upon such a prism, the yellow and the
     violet lights come out at somewhat different angles, and so two
     colored lines of light--a yellow line and a violet line--are
     seen on looking into the prism in the proper direction. The
     instrument used for separating the rays of light in this way is
     called a spectroscope (Fig. 79). The material to be tested is
     placed on a platinum wire and held in the colorless Bunsen
     flame. The resulting light passes through the slit in the end
     of tube B, and then through B to the prism. The resulting
     lines of light are seen by looking into the tube A, which
     contains a magnifying lens. Most elements give more than one
     image of the slit, each having a different color, and the
     series of colored lines due to an element is called its
     spectrum.

The spectra of the known elements have been carefully studied, and any element which imparts
a characteristic color to a flame, or has a spectrum of its own, can be identified even when
other elements are present. Through the spectroscopic examination of certain minerals a number
of elements have been discovered by the observation of lines which did not belong to any known
element. A study of the substance then brought to light the new element. Rubidium and cæsium
were discovered in this way, rubidium having bright red lines and cæsium a very intense blue

===========================================================================

~The family.~ The alkaline-earth family consists of the very abundant element calcium and the
much rarer elements strontium and barium. They are called the alkaline-earth metals because
their properties are between those of the alkali metals and the earth metals. The earth metals
will be discussed in a later chapter. The family is also frequently called the calcium family.

1. Occurrence. These elements do not occur free in nature. Their most abundant compounds are
the carbonates and sulphates; calcium also occurs in large quantities as the phosphate and
silicate.

2. Preparation. The metals were first prepared by Davy in 1808 by electrolysis. This method
has again come into use in recent years. Strontium and barium have as yet been obtained only
in small quantities and in the impure state, and many of their physical properties, such as
their densities and melting points, are therefore imperfectly known.

3. Properties. The three metals resemble each other very closely. They are silvery-white in
color and are about as hard as lead. Their densities increase with their atomic weights, as
is shown in the table on opposite page. Like the alkali metals they have a strong affinity
for oxygen, tarnishing in the air through oxidation. They decompose water at ordinary temperatures,
forming hydroxides and liberating hydrogen. When ignited in the air they burn with brilliancy,
forming oxides of the general formula MO. These oxides readily combine with water, according
to the equation

    MO + H{2}O = M(OH){2}.

Each of the elements has a characteristic spectrum, and the presence of the metals can easily
be detected by the spectroscope.

4. Compounds. The elements are divalent in almost all of their compounds, and these compounds
in solution give simple, divalent, colorless ions. The corresponding salts of the three elements
are very similar to each other and show a regular variation in properties in passing from calcium
to strontium and from strontium to barium. This is seen in the solubility of the sulphate and
hydroxide, and in the ease of decomposition of the carbonates, as given in the table. Unlike
the alkali metals, their normal carbonates and phosphates are insoluble in water.

CALCIUM

~Occurrence.~ The compounds of calcium are very abundant in nature, so that the total amount
of calcium in the earth's crust is very large. A great many different compounds containing
the clement are known, the most important of which are the following:

    Calcite (marble)     CaCO{3}.
    Phosphorite          Ca{3}(PO{4}){2}.
    Fluorspar            CaF{2}.
    Wollastonite         CaSiO{3}.
    Gypsum               CaSO{4}·2H{2}O.
    Anhydrite            CaSO{4}.

~Preparation.~ Calcium is now prepared by the electrolysis of the melted chloride, the metal
depositing in solid condition on the cathode. It is a gray metal, considerably heavier and
harder than sodium. It acts upon water, forming calcium hydroxide and hydrogen, but the action
does not evolve sufficient heat to melt the metal. It promises to become a useful substance,
though no commercial applications for it have as yet been found.

~Calcium oxide~ (lime, quicklime) (CaO). Lime is prepared by strongly heating calcium carbonate
(limestone) in large furnaces called kilns:

    CaCO{3} = CaO + CO{2}.

When pure, lime is a white amorphous substance. Heated intensely, as in the oxyhydrogen flame,
it gives a brilliant light called the lime light. Although it is a very difficultly fusible
substance, yet in the electric furnace it can be made to melt and even boil. Water acts upon
lime with the evolution of a great deal of heat,--hence the name quicklime, or live lime,--the
process being called slaking. The equation is

    CaO + H{2}O = Ca(OH){2}.

Lime readily absorbs moisture from the air, and is used to dry moist gases, especially ammonia,
which cannot be dried by the usual desiccating agents. It also absorbs carbon dioxide, forming
the carbonate

    CaO + CO{2} = CaCO{3}.

Lime exposed to air is therefore gradually converted into hydroxide and carbonate, and will
no longer slake with water. It is then said to be air-slaked.

     ~Limekilns.~ The older kiln, still in common use, consists of a
     large cylindrical stack in which the limestone is loosely
     packed. A fire is built at the base of the stack, and when the
     burning is complete it is allowed to die out and the lime is
     removed from the kiln. The newer kilns are constructed as shown
     in Fig. 80. A number of fire boxes are built around the lower
     part of the kiln, one of which is shown at B. The fire is
     built on the grate F and the hot products of combustion are
     drawn up through the stack, decomposing the limestone. The kiln
     is charged at C, and sometimes fuel is added with the
     limestone to cause combustion throughout the contents of the
     kiln. The burned lime is raked out through openings in the
     bottom of the stack, one of which is shown at D. The
     advantage of this kind of a kiln over the older form is that
     the process is continuous, limestone being charged in at the
     top as fast as the lime is removed at the bottom.

~Calcium hydroxide ~ (slaked lime) (Ca(OH){2}). Pure calcium hydroxide is a light white powder.
It is sparingly soluble in water, forming a solution called limewater, which is often used
in medicine as a mild alkali. Chemically, calcium hydroxide is a moderately strong base, though
not so strong as sodium hydroxide. Owing to its cheapness it is much used in the industries
whenever an alkali is desired. A number of its uses have already been mentioned. It is used
in the preparation of ammonia, bleaching powder, and potassium hydroxide. It is also used to
remove carbon dioxide and sulphur compounds from coal gas, to remove the hair from hides in
the tanneries (this recalls the caustic or corrosive properties of sodium hydroxide), and for
making mortar.

~Mortar~ is a mixture of calcium hydroxide and sand. When it is exposed to the air or spread
upon porous materials moisture is removed from it partly by absorption in the porous materials
and partly by evaporation, and the mortar becomes firm, or sets. At the same time carbon dioxide
is slowly absorbed from the air, forming hard calcium carbonate:

    Ca(OH){2} + CO{2} = CaCO{3} + H{2}O.

By this combined action the mortar becomes very hard and adheres firmly to the surface upon
which it is spread. The sand serves to give body to the mortar and makes it porous, so that
the change into carbonate can take place throughout the mass. It also prevents too much shrinkage.

~Cement.~ When limestone to which clay and sand have been added in certain proportions is burned
until it is partly fused (some natural marl is already of about the right composition), and
the clinker so produced is ground to powder, the product is called cement. When this material
is moistened it sets to a hard stone-like mass which retains its hardness even when exposed
to the continued action of water. It can be used for under-water work, such as bridge piers,
where mortar would quickly soften. Several varieties of cement are made, the best known of
which is Portland cement.

~Growing importance of cement.~ Cement is rapidly coming into use for a great variety of purposes.
It is often used in place of mortar in the construction of brick buildings. Mixed with crushed
stone and sand it forms concrete which is used in foundation work. It is also used in making
artificial stone, terra-cotta trimmings for buildings, artificial stone walks and floors, and
the like. It is being used more and more for making many articles which were formerly made
of wood or stone, and the entire walls of buildings are sometimes made of cement blocks or
of concrete.

~Calcium carbonate~ (CaCO{3}). This substance is found in a great many natural forms to which
various names have been given. They may be classified under three heads:

1. Amorphous carbonate. This includes those forms which are not markedly crystalline. Limestone
is the most familiar of these and is a grayish rock usually found in hard stratified masses.
Whole mountain ranges are sometimes made up of this material. It is always impure, usually
containing magnesium carbonate, clay, silica, iron and aluminium compounds, and frequently
fossil remains. Marl is a mixture of limestone and clay. Pearls, chalk, coral, and shells are
largely calcium carbonate.

2. Hexagonal carbonate. Calcium carbonate crystallizes in the form of rhomb-shaped crystals
which belong to the hexagonal system. When very pure and transparent the substance is called
Iceland spar. Calcite is a similar form, but somewhat opaque or clouded. Mexican onyx is a
massive variety, streaked or banded with colors due to impurities. Marble when pure is made
up of minute calcite crystals. Stalactites and stalagmites are icicle-like forms sometimes
found in caves.

3. Rhombic carbonate. Calcium carbonate sometimes crystallizes in needle-shaped crystals belonging
to the rhombic system. This is the unstable form and tends to go over into the other variety.
Aragonite is the most familiar example of this form.

~Preparation and uses of calcium carbonate.~ In the laboratory pure calcium carbonate can be
prepared by treating a soluble calcium salt with a soluble carbonate:

    Na{2}CO{3} + CaCl{2} = CaCO{3} + 2NaCl.

When prepared in this way it is a soft white powder often called precipitated chalk, and is
much used as a polishing powder.

The natural varieties of calcium carbonate find many uses, such as in the preparation of lime
and carbon dioxide; in metallurgical operations, especially in the blast furnaces; in the manufacture
of soda, glass, and crayon (which, in addition to chalk, usually contains clay and calcium
sulphate); for building stone and ballast for roads.

~Calcium chloride~ (CaCl{2}). This salt occurs in considerable quantity in sea water. It is
obtained as a by-product in many technical processes, as in the Solvay soda process. When crystallized
from its saturated solutions it forms colorless needles of the composition CaCl{2}·6H{2}O.
By evaporating a solution to dryness and heating to a moderate temperature calcium chloride
is obtained anhydrous as a white porous mass. In this condition it absorbs water with great
energy and is a valuable drying agent.

~Bleaching powder~ (CaOCl{2}). When chlorine acts upon a solution of calcium hydroxide the
reaction is similar to that which occurs between chlorine and potassium hydroxide:

    2 Ca(OH){2} + 4 Cl = CaCl{2} + Ca(ClO){2} + 2 H{2}O.

If, however, chlorine is conducted over calcium hydroxide in the form of a dry powder, it is
absorbed and a substance is formed which appears to have the composition represented in the
formula CaOCl{2}. This substance is called bleaching powder, or hypochlorite of lime. It is
probably the calcium salt of both hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids, so that its structure
is represented by the formula

       /ClO
    Ca
       \Cl.

In solution this substance acts exactly like a mixture of calcium chloride (CaCl{2}) and calcium
hypochlorite (Ca(ClO){2}), since it dissociates to form the ions Ca^{++}, Cl^{-}, and ClO^{-}.

Bleaching powder undergoes a number of reactions which make it an important substance.

1. When treated with an acid it evolves chlorine:

      /ClO
    Ca + H{2}SO{4} = CaSO{4} + HCl + HClO,
      \Cl

    HCl + HClO = H{2}O + 2Cl.

This reaction can be employed in the preparation of chlorine, or the nascent chlorine may be
used as a bleaching agent.

2. It is slowly decomposed by the carbon dioxide of the air, yielding calcium carbonate and
chlorine:

    CaOCl{2} + CO{2} = CaCO{3} + 2Cl.

Owing to this slow action the substance is a good disinfectant.

3. When its solution is boiled the substance breaks down into calcium chloride and chlorate:

    6CaOCl{2} = 5CaCl{2} + Ca(ClO{3}){2}.

This reaction is used in the preparation of potassium chlorate.

~Calcium fluoride~ (fluorspar) (CaF{2}). Fluorspar has already been mentioned as the chief
natural compound of fluorine. It is found in large quantities in a number of localities, and
is often crystallized in perfect cubes of a light green or amethyst color. It can be melted
easily in a furnace, and is sometimes used in the fused condition in metallurgical operations
to protect a metal from the action of the air during its reduction. It is used as the chief
source of fluorine compounds, especially hydrofluoric acid.

~Calcium sulphate~ (gypsum) (CaSO{4}·2H{2}O). This abundant substance occurs in very perfectly
formed crystals or in massive deposits. It is often found in solution in natural waters and
in the sea water. Salts deposited from sea water are therefore likely to contain this substance
(see Stassfurt salts).

It is very sparingly soluble in water, and is thrown down as a fine white precipitate when
any considerable amounts of a calcium salt and a soluble sulphate (or sulphuric acid) are brought
together in solution. Its chief use is in the manufacture of plaster of Paris and of hollow
tiles for fireproof walls. Such material is called gypsite. It is also used as a fertilizer.

Calcium sulphate, like the carbonate, occurs in many forms in nature. Gypsum is a name given
to all common varieties. Granular or massive specimens are called alabaster, while all those
which are well crystallized are called selenite. Satin spar is still another variety often
seen in mineral collections.

~Plaster of Paris.~ When gypsum is heated to about 115° it loses a portion of its water of
crystallization in accordance with the equation

    2(CaSO{4}·2H{2}O) = 2CaSO{4}·H{2}O + 2H{2}O.

The product is a fine white powder called plaster of Paris. On being moistened it again takes
up this water, and in so doing first forms a plastic mass, which soon becomes very firm and
hard and regains its crystalline structure. These properties make it very valuable as a material
for forming casts and stucco work, for cementing glass to metals, and for other similar purposes.
If overheated so that all water is driven off, the process of taking up water is so slow that
the material is worthless. Such material is said to be dead burned. Plaster of Paris is very
extensively used as the finishing coat for plastered walls.

~Hard water.~ Waters containing compounds of calcium and magnesium in solution are called hard
waters because they feel harsh to the touch. The hardness of water may be of two kinds,--(1)
temporary hardness and (2) permanent hardness.

1. Temporary hardness. We have seen that when water charged with carbon dioxide comes in contact
with limestone a certain amount of the latter dissolves, owing to the formation of the soluble
acid carbonate of calcium. The hardness of such waters is said to be temporary, since it may
be removed by boiling. The heat changes the acid carbonate into the insoluble normal carbonate
which then precipitates, rendering the water soft:

    Ca(HCO{3}){2} = CaCO{3} + H{2}O + CO{2}.

Such waters may also be softened by the addition of sufficient lime or calcium hydroxide to
convert the acid carbonate of calcium into the normal carbonate. The equation representing
the reaction is

    Ca(HCO{3}){2} + Ca(OH){2} = 2CaCO{3} + 2H{2}O.

2. Permanent hardness. The hardness of water may also be due to the presence of calcium and
magnesium sulphates or chlorides. Boiling the water does not affect these salts; hence such
waters are said to have permanent hardness. They may be softened, however, by the addition
of sodium carbonate, which precipitates the calcium and magnesium as insoluble carbonates:

    CaSO{4} + Na{2}CO{3} = CaCO{3} + Na{2}SO{4}.

This process is sometimes called "breaking" the water.

     ~Commercial methods for softening water.~ The average water of a
     city supply contains not only the acid carbonates of calcium
     and magnesium but also the sulphates and chlorides of these
     metals, together with other salts in smaller quantities. Such
     waters are softened on a commercial scale by the addition of
     the proper quantities of calcium hydroxide and sodium
     carbonate. The calcium hydroxide is added first to precipitate
     all the acid carbonates. After a short time the sodium
     carbonate is added to precipitate the other soluble salts of
     calcium and magnesium, together with any excess of calcium
     hydroxide which may have been added. The quantity of calcium
     hydroxide and sodium carbonate required is calculated from a
     chemical analysis of the water. It will be noticed that the
     water softened in this way will contain sodium sulphate and
     chloride, but the presence of these salts is not objectionable.

~Calcium carbide~ (CaC{2}). This substance is made by heating well-dried coke and lime in an
electrical furnace. The equation is

    CaO + 3C = CaC{2} + CO.

The pure carbide is a colorless, transparent, crystalline substance. In contact with water
it is decomposed with the evolution of pure acetylene gas, having a pleasant ethereal odor.
The commercial article is a dull gray porous substance which contains many impurities. The
acetylene prepared from this substance has a very characteristic odor due to impurities, the
chief of these being phosphine. It is used in considerable quantities as a source of acetylene
gas for illuminating purposes.

     ~Technical preparation.~ Fig. 81 represents a recent type of a
     carbide furnace. The base of the furnace is provided with a
     large block of carbon A, which serves as one of the
     electrodes. The other electrodes B, several in number, are
     arranged horizontally at some distance above this. A mixture of
     coal and lime is fed into the furnace through the trap top C,
     and in the lower part of the furnace this mixture becomes
     intensely heated, forming liquid carbide. This is drawn off
     through the taphole D.

     The carbon monoxide formed in the reaction escapes through the
     pipes E and is led back into the furnace. The pipes F
     supply air, so that the monoxide burns as it reënters the
     furnace and assists in heating the charge. The carbon dioxide
     so formed, together with the nitrogen entering as air, escape
     at G. An alternating current is used.

~Calcium phosphate~ (Ca{3}(PO{4}){2}). This important substance occurs abundantly in nature
as a constituent of apatite (3Ca{3}(PO{4}){2}·CaF{2}), in phosphate rock, and as the chief
mineral constituent of bones. Bone ash is therefore nearly pure calcium phosphate. It is a
white powder, insoluble in water, although it readily dissolves in acids, being decomposed
by them and converted into soluble acid phosphates, as explained in connection with the acids
of phosphorus.

STRONTIUM

~Occurrence.~ Strontium occurs sparingly in nature, usually as strontianite (SrCO{3}) and as
celestite (SrSO{4}). Both minerals form beautiful colorless crystals, though celestite is sometimes
colored a faint blue. Only a few of the compounds of strontium have any commercial applications.

~Strontium hydroxide~ (Sr(OH){2}·8H{2}O). The method of preparation of strontium hydroxide
is analogous to that of calcium hydroxide. The substance has the property of forming an insoluble
compound with sugar, which can easily be separated again into its constituents. It is therefore
sometimes used in the sugar refineries to extract sugar from impure mother liquors from which
the sugar will not crystallize.

~Strontium nitrate~ (Sr(NO{3}){2}·4H{2}O). This salt is prepared by treating the native carbonate
with nitric acid. When ignited with combustible materials it imparts a brilliant crimson color
to the flame, and because of this property it is used in the manufacture of red lights.

BARIUM

Barium is somewhat more abundant than strontium, occurring in nature largely as barytes, or
heavy spar (BaSO{4}), and witherite (BaCO{3}). Like strontium, it closely resembles calcium
both in the properties of the metal and in the compounds which it forms.

~Oxides of barium.~ Barium oxide (BaO) can be obtained by strongly heating the nitrate:

    Ba(NO{3}){2} = BaO + 2NO{2} + O.

Heated to a low red heat in the air, the oxide combines with oxygen, forming the peroxide (BaO{2}).
If the temperature is raised still higher, or the pressure is reduced, oxygen is given off
and the oxide is once more formed. The reaction

    BaO{2} <--> BaO + O

is reversible and has been used as a means of separating oxygen from the air. Treated with
acids, barium peroxide yields hydrogen peroxide:

    BaO{2} + 2HCl = BaCl{2} + H{2}O{2}.

~Barium chloride~ (BaCl{2}·2H{2}O). Barium chloride is a white well-crystallized substance
which is easily prepared from the native carbonate. It is largely used in the laboratory as
a reagent to detect the presence of sulphuric acid or soluble sulphates.

~Barium sulphate~ (barytes) (BaSO{4}). Barium sulphate occurs in nature in the form of heavy
white crystals. It is precipitated as a crystalline powder when a barium salt is added to a
solution of a sulphate or sulphuric acid:

    BaCl{2} + H{2}SO{4} = BaSO{4} + 2HCl.

This precipitate is used, as are also the finely ground native sulphate and carbonate, as a
pigment in paints. On account of its low cost it is sometimes used as an adulterant of white
lead, which is also a heavy white substance.

Barium compounds color the flame green, and the nitrate (Ba(NO{3}){2}) is used in the manufacture
of green lights. Soluble barium compounds are poisonous.

RADIUM

~Historical.~ In 1896 the French scientist Becquerel observed that the mineral pitchblende
possesses certain remarkable properties. It affects photographic plates even in complete darkness,
and discharges a gold-leaf electroscope when brought close to it. In 1898 Madam Curie made
a careful study of pitchblende to see if these properties belong to it or to some unknown substance
contained in it. She succeeded in extracting from it a very small quantity of a substance containing
a new element which she named radium.

In 1910 Madam Curie succeeded in obtaining radium itself by the electrolysis of radium chloride.
It is a silver-white metal melting at about 700°. It blackens in the air, forming a nitride,
and decomposes water. Its atomic weight is about 226.5.

~Properties.~ Compounds of radium affect a photographic plate or electroscope even through
layers of paper or sheets of metal. They also bring about chemical changes in substances placed
near them. Investigation of these strange properties has suggested that the radium atoms are
unstable and undergo a decomposition. As a result of this decomposition very minute bodies,
to which the name corpuscles has been given, are projected from the radium atom with exceedingly
great velocity. It is to these corpuscles that the strange properties of radium are due. It
seems probable that the gas helium is in some way formed during the decomposition of radium.

Two or three other elements, particularly uranium and thorium, have been found to possess many
of the properties of radium in smaller degree.

~Radium and the atomic theory.~ If these views in regard to radium should prove to be well
founded, it will be necessary to modify in some respects the conception of the atom as developed
in a former chapter. The atom would have to be regarded as a compound unit made up of several
parts. In a few cases, as in radium and uranium, it would appear that this unit is unstable
and undergoes transformation into more stable combinations. This modification would not, in
any essential way, be at variance with the atomic theory as propounded by Dalton.

CHAPTER XXV

THE MAGNESIUM FAMILY

===========================================================================
           |SYMBOL   |ATOMIC   |DENSITY   |MELTING   |BOILING | OXIDE
           |         |WEIGHT   |          | POINT    | POINT  |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magnesium  | Mg      | 24.36   |  1.75    | 750°     | 920°   |   MgO
Zinc       | Zn      | 65.4    |  7.00    | 420°     | 950°   |   ZnO
Cadmium    | Cd      |112.4    |  8.67    | 320°     | 778°   |   CdO
===========================================================================

~The family.~ In the magnesium family are included the four elements: magnesium, zinc, cadmium,
and mercury. Between the first three of these metals there is a close family resemblance, such
as has been traced between the members of the two preceding families. Mercury in some respects
is more similar to copper and will be studied in connection with that metal.

1. Properties. When heated to a high temperature in the air each of these metals combines with
oxygen to form an oxide of the general formula MO, in which M represents the metal. Magnesium
decomposes boiling water slowly, while zinc and cadmium have but little action on it.

2. Compounds. The members of this group are divalent in nearly all their compounds, so that
the formulas of their salts resemble those of the alkaline-earth metals. Like the alkaline-earth
metals, their carbonates and phosphates are insoluble in water. Their sulphates, however, are
readily soluble. Unlike both the alkali and alkaline-earth metals, their hydroxides are nearly
insoluble in water. Most of their compounds dissociate in such a way as to give a simple, colorless,
metallic ion.

MAGNESIUM

~Occurrence.~ Magnesium is a very abundant element in nature, ranking a little below calcium
in this respect. Like calcium, it is a constituent of many rocks and also occurs in the form
of soluble salts.

~Preparation.~ The metal magnesium, like most metals whose oxides are difficult to reduce with
carbon, was formerly prepared by heating the anhydrous chloride with sodium:

    MgCl{2} + 2Na = 2NaCl + Mg.

It is now made by electrolysis, but instead of using as the electrolyte the melted anhydrous
chloride, which is difficult to obtain, the natural mineral carnallite is used. This is melted
in an iron pot which also serves as the cathode in the electrolysis. A rod of carbon dipping
into the melted salt serves as the anode. The apparatus is very similar to the one employed
in the preparation of sodium.

~Properties.~ Magnesium is a rather tough silvery-white metal of small density. Air does not
act rapidly upon it, but a thin film of oxide forms upon its surface, dimming its bright luster.
The common acids dissolve it with the formation of the corresponding salts. It can be ignited
readily and in burning liberates much heat and gives a brilliant white light. This light is
very rich in the rays which affect photographic plates, and the metal in the form of fine powder
is extensively used in the production of flash lights and for white lights in pyrotechnic displays.

~Magnesium oxide~ (magnesia) (MgO). Magnesium oxide, sometimes called magnesia or magnesia
usta, resembles lime in many respects. It is much more easily formed than lime and can be made
in the same way,--by igniting the carbonate. It is a white powder, very soft and light, and
is unchanged by heat even at very high temperatures. For this reason it is used in the manufacture
of crucibles, for lining furnaces, and for other purposes where a refractory substance is needed.
It combines with water to form magnesium hydroxide, but much more slowly and with the production
of much less heat than in the case of calcium oxide.

~Magnesium hydroxide~ (Mg(OH){2}). The hydroxide formed in this way is very slightly soluble
in water, but enough dissolves to give the water an alkaline reaction. Magnesium hydroxide
is therefore a fairly strong base. It is an amorphous white substance. Neither magnesia nor
magnesium salts have a very marked effect upon the system; and for this reason magnesia is
a very suitable antidote for poisoning by strong acids, since any excess introduced into the
system will have no injurious effect.

     ~Magnesium cement.~ A paste of magnesium hydroxide and water
     slowly absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and becomes very
     hard. The hardness of the product is increased by the presence
     of a considerable amount of magnesium chloride in the paste.
     The hydroxide, with or without the chloride, is used in the
     preparation of cements for some purposes.

~Magnesium carbonate~ (MgCO{3}). Magnesium carbonate is a very abundant mineral. It occurs
in a number of localities as magnesite, which is usually amorphous, but sometimes forms pure
crystals resembling calcite. More commonly it is found associated with calcium carbonate. The
mineral dolomite has the composition CaCO{3}·MgCO{3}. Limestone containing smaller amounts
of magnesium carbonate is known as dolomitic limestone. Dolomite is one of the most common
rocks, forming whole mountain masses. It is harder and less readily attacked by acids than
limestone. It is valuable as a building stone and as ballast for roadbeds and foundations.
Like calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate is insoluble in water, though easily dissolved
by acids.

~Basic carbonate of magnesium.~ We should expect to find magnesium carbonate precipitated when
a soluble magnesium salt and a soluble carbonate are brought together:

    Na{2}CO{3} + MgCl{2} = MgCO{3} + 2NaCl.

Instead of this, some carbon dioxide escapes and the product is found to be a basic carbonate.
The most common basic carbonate of magnesium has the formula 4MgCO{3}·Mg(OH){2}, and is sometimes
called magnesia alba. This compound is formed by the partial hydrolysis of the normal carbonate
at first precipitated:

    5MgCO{3} + 2H{2}O = 4MgCO{3}·Mg(OH){2} + H{2}CO{3}.

~Magnesium chloride~ (MgCl{2}·6H{2}O). Magnesium chloride is found in many natural waters and
in many salt deposits (see Stassfurt salts). It is obtained as a by-product in the manufacture
of potassium chloride from carnallite. As there is no very important use for it, large quantities
annually go to waste. When heated to drive off the water of crystallization the chloride is
decomposed as shown in the equation

    MgCl{2}·6H{2}O = MgO + 2HCl + 5H{2}O.

Owing to the abundance of magnesium chloride, this reaction is being used to some extent in
the preparation of both magnesium oxide and hydrochloric acid.

     ~Boiler scale.~ When water which contains certain salts in
     solution is evaporated in steam boilers, a hard insoluble
     material called scale deposits in the boiler. The formation
     of this scale may be due to several distinct causes.

     1. To the deposit of calcium sulphate. This salt, while
     sparingly soluble in cold water, is almost completely insoluble
     in superheated water. Consequently it is precipitated when
     water containing it is heated in a boiler.

     2. To decomposition of acid carbonates.

     3. To hydrolysis of magnesium salts. Magnesium chloride, and
     to some extent magnesium sulphate, undergo hydrolysis when
     superheated in solution, and the magnesium hydroxide, being
     sparingly soluble, precipitates:

     MgCl{2} + 2H{2}O <--> Mg(OH){2} + 2HCl.

     This scale adheres tightly to the boiler in compact layers and,
     being a non-conductor of heat, causes much waste of fuel. It is
     very difficult to remove, owing to its hardness and resistance
     to reagents. Thick scale sometimes cracks, and the water coming
     in contact with the overheated iron occasions an explosion.
     Moreover, the acids set free in the hydrolysis of the magnesium
     salts attack the iron tubes and rapidly corrode them. These
     causes combine to make the formation of scale a matter which
     occasions much trouble in cases where hard water is used in
     steam boilers. Water containing such salts should be softened,
     therefore, before being used in boilers.

~Magnesium sulphate~ (Epsom salt) (MgSO{4}·7H{2}O). Like the chloride, magnesium sulphate is
found rather commonly in springs and in salt deposits. A very large deposit of the almost pure
salt has been found in Wyoming. Its name was given to it because of its abundant occurrence
in the waters of the Epsom springs in England.

Magnesium sulphate has many uses in the industries. It is used to a small extent in the preparation
of sodium and potassium sulphates, as a coating for cotton cloth, in the dye industry, in tanning,
and in the manufacture of paints and laundry soaps. To some extent it is used in medicine.

~Magnesium silicates.~ Many silicates containing magnesium are known and some of them are important
substances. Serpentine, asbestos, talc, and meerschaum are examples of such substances.

ZINC

~Occurrence.~ Zinc never occurs free in nature. Its compounds have been found in many different
countries, but it is not a constituent of common rocks and minerals, and its occurrence is
rather local and confined to definite deposits or pockets. It occurs chiefly in the following ores:

    Sphalerite (zinc blende) ZnS.
    Zincite ZnO.
    Smithsonite ZnCO{3}.
    Willemite Zn{2}SiO{4}.
    Franklinite ZnO·Fe{2}O{3}.

One fourth of the world's output of zinc comes from the United States, Missouri being the largest
producer.

~Metallurgy.~ The ores employed in the preparation of zinc are chiefly the sulphide, oxide,
and carbonate. They are first roasted in the air, by which process they are changed into oxide:

    ZnCO{3} = ZnO + CO{2},
    ZnS + 3O = ZnO + SO{2}.

The oxide is then mixed with coal dust, and the mixture is heated in earthenware muffles or
retorts, natural gas being used as fuel in many cases. The oxide is reduced by this means to
the metallic state, and the zinc, being volatile at the high temperature reached, distills
and is collected in suitable receivers. At first the zinc collects in the form of fine powder,
called zinc dust or flowers of zinc, recalling the formation under similar conditions of flowers
of sulphur. Later, when the whole apparatus has become warm, the zinc condenses to a liquid
in the receiver, from which it is drawn off into molds. Commercial zinc often contains a number
of impurities, especially carbon, arsenic, and iron.

~Physical properties.~ Pure zinc is a rather heavy bluish-white metal with a high luster. It
melts at about 420°, and if heated much above this temperature in the air takes fire and burns
with a very bright bluish flame. It boils at about 950° and can therefore be purified by distillation.

Many of the physical properties of zinc are much influenced by the temperature and previous
treatment of the metal. When cast into ingots from the liquid state it becomes at ordinary
temperatures quite hard, brittle, and highly crystalline. At 150° it is malleable and can be
rolled into thin sheets; at higher temperatures it again becomes very brittle. When once rolled
into sheets it retains its softness and malleability at ordinary temperatures. When melted
and poured into water it forms thin brittle flakes, and in this condition is called granulated
or mossy zinc.

~Chemical properties.~ Zinc is tarnished superficially by moist air, but beyond this is not
affected by it. It does not decompose even boiling water. When the metal is quite pure, sulphuric
and hydrochloric acids have scarcely any action upon it; when, however, it contains small amounts
of other metals such as magnesium or arsenic, or when it is merely in contact with metallic
platinum, brisk action takes place and hydrogen is evolved. For this reason, when pure zinc
is used in the preparation of hydrogen a few drops of platinum chloride are often added to
the solution to assist the chemical action. Nitric acid dissolves the metal readily, with the
formation of zinc nitrate and various reduction products of nitric acid. The strong alkalis
act upon zinc and liberate hydrogen:

    Zn + 2KOH = Zn(OK){2} + 2H.

The product of this reaction, potassium zincate, is a salt of zinc hydroxide, which is thus
seen to have acid properties, though it usually acts as a base.

~Uses of zinc.~ The metal has many familiar uses. Rolled into sheets, it is used as a lining
for vessels which are to contain water. As a thin film upon the surface of iron (galvanized
iron) it protects the iron from rust. Iron is usually galvanized by dipping it into a bath
of melted zinc, but electrical methods are also employed. Zinc plates are used in many forms
of electrical batteries. In the laboratory zinc is used in the preparation of hydrogen, and
in the form of zinc dust as a reducing agent.

One of the largest uses of zinc is in the manufacture of alloys. Brass, an alloy of zinc and
copper, is the most important of these; German silver, consisting of copper, zinc, and nickel,
has many uses; various bronzes, coin metals, and bearing metals also contain zinc. Its ability
to alloy with silver finds application in the separation of silver from lead (see silver).

~Compounds of zinc.~ In general, the compounds of zinc are similar in formula and appearance
to those of magnesium, but in other properties they often differ markedly. A number of them
have value in commercial ways.

~Zinc oxide~ (zinc white) (ZnO). Zinc oxide occurs in impure form in nature, being colored
red by manganese and iron compounds. It can be prepared just like magnesium oxide, but is more
often made by burning the metal.

Zinc oxide is a pure white powder which becomes yellow on heating and regains its white color
when cold. It is much used as a white pigment in paints, under the name of zinc white, and
has the advantage over white lead in that it is not changed in color by sulphur compounds,
while lead turns black. It is also used in the manufacture of rubber goods.

     ~Commercial preparation of zinc oxide.~ Commercially it is often
     made from franklinite in the following way. The franklinite is
     mixed with coal and heated to a high temperature in a furnace,
     by which process the zinc is set free and converted into vapor.
     As the vapor leaves the furnace through a conduit it meets a
     current of air and takes fire in it, forming zinc oxide. The
     oxide passes on and is filtered from the air through canvas
     bags, which allow the air to pass but retain the oxide. It is
     thus made by burning the metal, though the metal is not
     actually isolated in the process.

~Soluble salts.~ The soluble salts of zinc can be made by dissolving the metal or the oxide
in the appropriate acid. They are all somewhat poisonous. The sulphate and chloride are the
most familiar.

~Zinc sulphate~ (white vitriol) (ZnSO{4}·7H{2}O). This salt is readily crystallized from strong
solutions in transparent colorless crystals. It is prepared commercially by careful roasting
of the sulphide:

    ZnS + 4O = ZnSO{4}.

~Zinc chloride~ (ZnCl{2}·H{2}O). When a solution of zinc chloride is slowly evaporated a salt
of the composition ZnCl{2}·H{2}O crystallizes out. If the water is completely expelled by heat
and the residue distilled, the anhydrous chloride is obtained and may be cast into sticks or
broken into lumps. In this distillation, just as in heating magnesium chloride, some of the
chloride is decomposed:

    ZnCl{2}·H{2}O = ZnO + 2HCl.

The anhydrous chloride has a great affinity for water, and is used as a dehydrating agent.
It is also a germicide, and wood which is to be exposed to conditions which favor decay, as,
for example, railroad ties, is often soaked in solutions of this salt.

~Insoluble compounds.~ The insoluble compounds of zinc can be prepared by precipitation. The
most important are the sulphide, carbonate, and hydroxide.

~Zinc sulphide~ (ZnS). This substance occurs as the mineral sphalerite, and is one of the most
valued ores of zinc. Very large deposits occur in southwestern Missouri. The natural mineral
is found in large crystals or masses, resembling resin in color and luster. When prepared by
precipitation the sulphide is white.

CADMIUM

~The element.~ This element occurs in small quantities in some zinc ores. In the course of
the metallurgy of zinc the cadmium compounds undergo chemical changes quite similar to those
of the zinc compounds, and the cadmium distills along with the zinc. Being more volatile, it
comes over with the first of the zinc and is prepared from the first portions of the distillate
by special methods of purification. The element very closely resembles zinc in most respects.
Some of its alloys are characterized by having low melting points.

~Compounds of cadmium.~ Among the compounds of cadmium may be mentioned the chloride (CdCl{2}·2H{2}O),
the sulphate (3CdSO{4}·8H{2}O), and the nitrate (Cd(NO{3}){2}·4H{2}O). These are white solids
soluble in water. The sulphide (CdS) is a bright yellow substance which is insoluble in water
and in dilute acids. It is valuable as a pigment in fine paints.

CHAPTER XXVI

THE ALUMINIUM FAMILY

~The family.~ The element aluminium is the most abundant member of the group of elements known
as the aluminium family; indeed, the other members of the family--gallium, indium, and thallium--are
of such rare occurrence that they need not be separately described. The elements of the family
are ordinarily trivalent, so that the formulas for their compounds differ from those of the
elements so far studied. Their hydroxides are practically insoluble in water and are very weak
bases; indeed, the bases are so weak that their salts are often hydrolyzed into free base and
free acid in solution. The salts formed from these bases usually contain water of crystallization,
which cannot be driven off without decomposing them more or less.

The trivalent metals, which in addition to aluminium include also iron and chromium, are sometimes
called the earth metals. The name refers to the earthy appearance of the oxides of these metals,
and to the fact that many earths, soils, and rocks are composed in part of these substances.

ALUMINIUM

~Occurrence.~ Aluminium never occurs in the free state in nature, owing to its great affinity
for oxygen. In combined form, as oxides, silicates, and a few other salts, it is both abundant
and widely distributed, being an essential constituent of all soils and of most rocks excepting
limestone and sandstone. Cryolite (Na{3}AlF{6}), found in Greenland, and bauxite, which is
an aluminium hydroxide usually mixed with some iron hydroxide, are important minerals. It is
estimated that aluminium composes about 8% of the earth's crust. In the industries the metal
is called aluminum, but its chemical name is aluminium.

~Preparation.~ Aluminium was first prepared by Wöhler, in 1827, by heating anhydrous aluminium
chloride with potassium:

    AlCl{3} + 3K = 3KCl + Al.

This method was tried after it was found impossible to reduce the oxide of aluminium with carbon.
The metal possessed such interesting properties and promised to be so useful that many efforts
were made to devise a cheap way of preparing it. The method which has proved most successful
consists in the electrolysis of the oxide dissolved in melted cryolite.

     ~Metallurgy.~ An iron box A (Fig. 82) about eight feet long and
     six feet wide is connected with a powerful generator in such a
     way as to serve as the cathode upon which the aluminium is
     deposited. Three or four rows of carbon rods B dip into the
     box and serve as the anodes. The box is partially filled with
     cryolite and the current is turned on, generating enough heat
     to melt the cryolite. Aluminium oxide is then added, and under
     the influence of the electric current it decomposes into
     aluminium and oxygen. The temperature is maintained above the
     melting point of aluminium, and the liquid metal, being heavier
     than cryolite, sinks to the bottom of the vessel, from which it
     is tapped off from time to time through the tap hole C. The
     oxygen in part escapes as gas, and in part combines with the
     carbon of the anode, the combustion being very brilliant. The
     process is carried on at Niagara Falls.

     The largest expense in the process, apart from the cost of
     electrical energy, is the preparation of aluminium oxide free
     from other oxides, for most of the oxide found in nature is too
     impure to serve without refining. Bauxite is the principal ore
     used as a source of the aluminium because it is converted into
     pure oxide without great difficulty. Since common clay is a
     silicate of aluminium and is everywhere abundant, it might be
     expected that this would be utilized in the preparation of
     aluminium. It is, however, very difficult to extract the
     aluminium from a silicate, and no practical method has been
     found which will accomplish this.

~Physical properties.~ Aluminium is a tin-white metal which melts at 640° and is very light,
having a density of 2.68. It is stiff and strong, and with frequent annealing can be rolled
into thin foil. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity, though not so good as copper
for a given cross section of wire.

~Chemical properties.~ Aluminium is not perceptibly acted on by boiling water, and moist air
merely dims its luster. Further action is prevented in each case by the formation of an extremely
thin film of oxide upon the surface of the metal. It combines directly with chlorine, and when
heated in oxygen burns with great energy and the liberation of much heat. It is therefore a
good reducing agent. Hydrochloric acid acts upon it, forming aluminium chloride: nitric acid
and dilute sulphuric acid have almost no action on it, but hot, concentrated sulphuric acid
acts upon it in the same way as upon copper:

    2Al + 6H{2}SO{4} = Al{2}(SO{4}){3} + 6H{2}O + 3SO{2}.

Alkalis readily attack the metal, liberating hydrogen, as in the case of zinc:

    Al + 3KOH = Al(OK){3} + 3H.

Salt solutions, such as sea water, corrode the metal rapidly. It alloys readily with other metals.

~Uses of aluminium.~ These properties suggest many uses for the metal. Its lightness, strength,
and permanence make it well adapted for many construction purposes. These same properties have
led to its extensive use in the manufacture of cooking utensils. The fact that it is easily
corroded by salt solutions is, however, a disadvantage. Owing to its small resistance to electrical
currents, it is replacing copper to some extent in electrical construction, especially for
trolley and power wires. Some of its alloys have very valuable properties, and a considerable
part of the aluminium manufactured is used for this purpose. Aluminium bronze, consisting of
about 90% copper and 10% aluminium, has a pure golden color, is strong and malleable, is easily
cast, and is permanent in the air. Considerable amounts of aluminium steel are also made.

~Goldschmidt reduction process.~ Aluminium is frequently employed as a powerful reducing agent,
many metallic oxides which resist reduction by carbon being readily reduced by it. The aluminium
in the form of a fine powder is mixed with the metallic oxide, together with some substance
such as fluorspar to act as a flux. The mixture is ignited, and the aluminium unites with the
oxygen of the metallic oxide, liberating the metal. This collects in a fused condition under
the flux.

An enormous quantity of heat is liberated in this reaction, and a temperature as high as 3500°
can be reached. The heat of the reaction is turned to practical account in welding car rails,
steel castings, and in similar operations where an intense local heat is required. A mixture
of aluminium with various metallic oxides, ready prepared for such purposes, is sold under
the name of thermite.

     ~Preparation of chromium by the Goldschmidt method.~ A mixture of
     chromium oxide and aluminium powder is placed in a Hessian
     crucible (A, Fig. 83), and on top of it is placed a small
     heap B of a mixture of sodium peroxide and aluminium, into
     which is stuck a piece of magnesium ribbon C. Powdered
     fluorspar D is placed around the sodium peroxide, after which
     the crucible is set on a pan of sand and the magnesium ribbon
     ignited. When the flame reaches the sodium peroxide mixture
     combustion of the aluminium begins with almost explosive
     violence, so that great care must be taken in the experiment.
     The heat of this combustion starts the reaction in the chromium
     oxide mixture, and the oxide is reduced to metallic chromium.
     When the crucible has cooled a button of chromium will be found
     in the bottom.

~Aluminium oxide~ (Al{2}O{3}). This substance occurs in several forms in nature. The relatively
pure crystals are called corundum, while emery is a variety colored dark gray or black, usually
with iron compounds. In transparent crystals, tinted different colors by traces of impurities,
it forms such precious stones as the sapphire, oriental ruby, topaz, and amethyst. All these
varieties are very hard, falling little short of the diamond in this respect. Chemically pure
aluminium oxide can be made by igniting the hydroxide, when it forms an amorphous white powder:

    2Al(OH){3} = Al{2}O{3} + 3H{2}O.

The natural varieties, corundum and emery, are used for cutting and grinding purposes; the
purest forms, together with the artificially prepared oxide, are largely used in the preparation
of aluminium.

~Aluminium hydroxide~ (Al(OH){3}). The hydroxide occurs in nature as the mineral hydrargyllite,
and in a partially dehydrated form called bauxite. It can be prepared by adding ammonium hydroxide
to any soluble aluminium salt, forming a semi-transparent precipitate which is insoluble in
water but very hard to filter. It dissolves in most acids to form soluble salts, and in the
strong bases to form aluminates, as indicated in the equations

    Al(OH){3} + 3HCl = AlCl{3} + 3H{2}O,
    Al(OH){3} + 3NaOH = Al(ONa){3} + 3H{2}O.

It may act, therefore, either as a weak base or as a weak acid, its action depending upon the
character of the substances with which it is in contact. When heated gently the hydroxide loses
part of its hydrogen and oxygen according to the equation

    Al(OH){3} = AlO·OH + H{2}O.

This substance, the formula of which is frequently written HAlO{2}, is a more pronounced acid
than is the hydroxide, and its salts are frequently formed when aluminium compounds are fused
with alkalis. The magnesium salt Mg(AlO{2}){2} is called spinel, and many other of its salts,
called aluminates, are found in nature.

When heated strongly the hydroxide is changed into oxide, which will not again take up water
on being moistened.

     ~Mordants and dyeing.~ Aluminium hydroxide has the peculiar
     property of combining with many soluble coloring materials and
     forming insoluble products with them. On this account it is
     often used as a filter to remove objectionable colors from
     water. This property also leads to its wide use in the dye
     industry. Many dyes will not adhere to natural fibers such as
     cotton and wool, that is, will not "dye fast." If, however, the
     cloth to be dyed is soaked in a solution of aluminium compounds
     and then treated with ammonia, the aluminium salts which have
     soaked into the fiber will be converted into the hydroxide,
     which, being insoluble, remains in the body of it. If the fiber
     is now dipped into a solution of the dye, the aluminium
     hydroxide combines with the color material and fastens, or
     "fixes," it upon the fiber. A substance which serves this
     purpose is called a mordant, and aluminium salts,
     particularly the acetate, are used in this way.

~Aluminium chloride~ (AlCl{3}·6 H{2}O). This substance is prepared by dissolving the hydroxide
in hydrochloric acid and evaporating to crystallization. When heated it is converted into the
oxide, resembling magnesium in this respect:

    2(AlCl{3}·6 H{2}O) = Al{2}O{3} + 6HCl + 9H{2}O.

The anhydrous chloride, which has some important uses, is made by heating aluminium turnings
in a current of chlorine.

~Alums.~ Aluminium sulphate can be prepared by the action of sulphuric acid upon aluminium
hydroxide. It has the property of combining with the sulphates of the alkali metals to form
compounds called alums. Thus, with potassium sulphate the reaction is expressed by the equation

    K{2}SO{4} + Al{2}(SO{4}){3} + 24H{2}O
       = 2(KAl(SO{4}){2}·12H{2}O).

Other trivalent sulphates besides aluminium sulphate can form similar compounds with the alkali
sulphates, and these compounds are also called alums, though they contain no aluminium. They
all crystallize in octahedra and contain twelve molecules of water of crystallization. The
alums most frequently prepared are the following:

    Potassium alum               KAl(SO{4}){2}·12H{2}O.
    Ammonium alum                NH{4}Al(SO{4}){2}·12H{2}O.
    Ammonium iron alum           NH{4}Fe(SO{4}){2}·12H{2}O.
    Potassium chrome alum        KCr(SO{4}){2}·12H{2}O.

An alum may therefore be regarded as a compound derived from two molecules of sulphuric acid,
in which one hydrogen atom has been displaced by the univalent alkali atom, and the other three
hydrogen atoms by an atom of one of the trivalent metals, such as aluminium, iron, or chromium.

     Very large, well-formed crystals of an alum can be prepared by
     suspending a small crystal by a thread in a saturated solution
     of the alum, as shown in Fig. 84. The small crystal slowly
     grows and assumes a very perfect form.

~Other salts of aluminium.~ While aluminium hydroxide forms fairly stable salts with strong
acids, it is such a weak base that its salts with weak acids are readily hydrolyzed. Thus,
when an aluminium salt and a soluble carbonate are brought together in solution we should expect
to have aluminium carbonate precipitated according to the equation

    3Na{2}CO{3} + 2AlCl{3} = Al{2}(CO{3}){3} + 6NaCl.

But if it is formed at all, it instantly begins to hydrolyze, the products of the hydrolysis
being aluminium hydroxide and carbonic acid,

    Al{2}(CO{3}){3} + 6H{2}O = 2Al(OH){3} + 3H{2}CO{3}.

Similarly a soluble sulphide, instead of precipitating aluminium sulphide (Al{2}S{3}), precipitates
aluminium hydroxide; for hydrogen sulphide is such a weak acid that the aluminium sulphide
at first formed hydrolyzes at once, forming aluminium hydroxide and hydrogen sulphide:

    3Na{2}S + 2AlCl{3} + 6H{2}O = 2Al(OH){3} + 6NaCl + 3H{2}S.

~Alum baking powders.~ It is because of the hydrolysis of aluminium carbonate that alum is
used as a constituent of some baking powders. The alum baking powders consist of a mixture
of alum and sodium hydrogen carbonate. When water is added the two compounds react together,
forming aluminium carbonate, which hydrolyzes into aluminium hydroxide and carbonic acid. The
carbon dioxide from the latter escapes through the dough and in so doing raises it into a porous
condition, which is the end sought in the use of a baking powder.

~Aluminium silicates.~ One of the most common constituents of rocks is feldspar (KAlSi{3}O{8}),
a mixed salt of potassium and aluminium with the polysilicic acid (H{4}Si{3}O{8}). Under the
influence of moisture, carbon dioxide, and changes of temperature this substance is constantly
being broken down into soluble potassium compounds and hydrated aluminium silicate. Mica is
another very abundant mineral, having varying composition, but being essentially of the formula
KAlSiO{4}. Serpentine, talc, asbestos, and meerschaum are important complex silicates of aluminium
and magnesium, and granite is a mechanical mixture of quartz, feldspar, and mica.

     ~Ceramic industries.~ Many articles of greatest practical
     importance, ranging from the roughest brick and tile to the
     finest porcelain and chinaware, are made from some form of
     kaolin, or clay. No very precise classification of such ware
     can be made, as the products vary greatly in properties,
     depending upon the materials used and the treatment during
     manufacture.

     Porcelain is made from the purest kaolin, to which must be
     added some less pure, plastic kaolin, since the pure substance
     is not sufficiently plastic. There is also added some more
     fusible substance, such as feldspar, gypsum, or lime, together
     with some pure quartz. The constituents must be ground very
     fine, and when thoroughly mixed and moistened must make a
     plastic mass which can be molded into any desired form. The
     article molded from such materials is then burned. In this
     process the article is slowly heated to a point at which it
     begins to soften and almost fuse, and then it is allowed to
     cool slowly. At this stage, a very thin vessel will be
     translucent and have an almost glassy fracture; if, however, it
     is somewhat thicker, or has not been heated quite so high, it
     will still be porous, and partly on this account and partly to
     improve its appearance it is usually glazed.

     Glazing is accomplished by spreading upon the object a thin
     layer of a more fusible mixture of the same materials as
     compose the body of the object itself, and again heating until
     the glaze melts to a transparent glassy coating upon the
     surface of the vessel. In some cases fusible mixtures of quite
     different composition from that used in fashioning the vessel
     may be used as a glaze. Oxides of lead, zinc, and barium are
     often used in this way.

     When less carefully selected materials are used, or quite thick
     vessels are made, various grades of stoneware are produced. The
     inferior grades are glazed by throwing a quantity of common
     salt into the kiln towards the end of the first firing. In the
     form of vapor the salt attacks the surface of the baked ware
     and forms an easily fusible sodium silicate upon it, which
     constitutes a glaze.

     Vitrified bricks, made from clay or ground shale, are burned
     until the materials begin to fuse superficially, forming their
     own glaze. Other forms of brick and tile are not glazed at all,
     but are left porous. The red color of ordinary brick and
     earthenware is due to an oxide of iron formed in the burning
     process.

     The decorations upon china are sometimes painted upon the baked
     ware and then glazed over, and sometimes painted upon the glaze
     and burned in by a third firing. Care must be taken to use such
     pigments as are not affected by a high heat and do not react
     chemically with the constituents of the baked ware or the
     glaze.

===================================================================

~The family.~ The elements iron, cobalt, and nickel form a group in the eighth column of the
periodic table. The atomic weights of the three are very close together, and there is not the
same gradual gradation in the properties of the three elements that is noticed in the families
in which the atomic weights differ considerably in magnitude. The elements are very similar
in properties, the similarity being so great in the case of nickel and cobalt that it is difficult
to separate them by chemical analysis.

The elements occur in nature chiefly as oxides and sulphides, though they have been found in
very small quantities in the native state, usually in meteorites. Their sulphides, carbonates,
and phosphates are insoluble in water, the other common salts being soluble. Their salts are
usually highly colored, those of iron being yellow or light green as a rule, those of nickel
darker green, while cobalt salts are usually rose colored. The metals are obtained by reducing
the oxides with carbon.

IRON

~Occurrence.~ The element iron has long been known, since its ores are very abundant and it
is not difficult to prepare the metal from them in fairly pure condition. It occurs in nature
in many forms of combination,--in large deposits as oxides, sulphides, and carbonates, and
in smaller quantities in a great variety of minerals. Indeed, very few rocks or soils are free
from small amounts of iron, and it is assimilated by plants and animals playing an important
part in life processes.

~Metallurgy.~ It will be convenient to treat of the metallurgy of iron under two heads,--Materials
Used and Process.

~Materials used.~ Four distinct materials are used in the metallurgy of iron:

     1.
         Siderite      FeCO{3}.
         Limonite      2Fe{2}O{2}·3H{2}O.

     These ores always contain impurities, such as silica,
     sulphides, and earthy materials. All ores, with the exception
     of the oxides, are first roasted to expel any water and carbon
     dioxide present and to convert any sulphide into oxide.

     2. Carbon. Carbon in some form is necessary both as a fuel
     and as a reducing agent. In former times wood charcoal was used
     to supply the carbon, but now anthracite coal or coke is almost
     universally used.

     3. Hot air. To maintain the high temperature required for the
     reduction of iron a very active combustion of fuel is
     necessary. This is secured by forcing a strong blast of hot air
     into the lower part of the furnace during the reduction
     process.

     4. Flux. (a) Purpose of the flux. All the materials which
     enter the furnace must leave it again either in the form of
     gases or as liquids. The iron is drawn off as the liquid metal
     after its reduction. To secure the removal of the earthy matter
     charged into the furnace along with the ore, materials are
     added to the charge which will, at the high temperature of the
     furnace, combine with the impurities in the ore, forming a
     liquid. The material added for this purpose is called the
     flux; the liquid produced from the flux and the ore is called
     slag.

     (b) Function of the slag. While the main purpose of adding
     flux to the charge is to remove from the furnace in the form of
     liquid slag the impurities originally present in the ore, the
     slag thus produced serves several other functions. It keeps the
     contents of the furnace in a state of fusion, thus preventing
     clogging, and makes it possible for the small globules of iron
     to run together with greater ease into one large liquid mass.

     (c) Character of the slag. The slag is really a kind of
     readily fusible glass, being essentially a calcium-aluminium
     silicate. The ore usually contains silica and some aluminium
     compounds, so that limestone (which also contains some silica
     and aluminium) is added to furnish the calcium required for the
     slag. If the ore and the limestone do not contain a sufficient
     amount of silica and aluminium for the formation of the slag,
     these ingredients are added in the form of sand and feldspar.
     In the formation of slag from these materials the ore is freed
     from the silica and aluminium which it contained.

~Process.~ The reduction of iron is carried out in large towers called blast furnaces. The
blast furnace (Fig. 85) is usually about 80 ft. high and 20 ft. in internal diameter at its
widest part, narrowing somewhat both toward the top and toward the bottom. The walls are built
of steel and lined with fire-brick. The base is provided with a number of pipes T, called tuyers,
through which hot air can be forced into the furnace. The tuyers are supplied from a large
pipe S, which circles the furnace as a girdle. The base has also an opening M, through which
the liquid metal can be drawn off from time to time, and a second opening P, somewhat above
the first, through which the excess of slag overflows. The top is closed by a movable trap
C and C, called the cone, and through this the materials to be used are introduced. The gases
produced by the combustion of the fuel and the reduction of the ore, together with the nitrogen
of the air forced in through the tuyers, escape through pipes D, called downcomer pipes, which
leave the furnace near the top. These gases are very hot and contain combustible substances,
principally carbon monoxide; they are therefore utilized as fuel for the engines and also to
heat the blast admitted through the tuyers. The lower part of the furnace is often furnished
with a water jacket. This consists of a series of pipes W built into the walls, through which
water can be circulated to reduce their temperature.

Charges consisting of coke (or anthracite coal), ore, and flux in proper proportions are introduced
into the furnace at intervals through the trap top. The coke burns fiercely in the hot-air
blast, giving an intense heat and forming carbon monoxide. The ore, working down in the furnace
as the coke burns, becomes very hot, and by the combined reducing action of the carbon and
carbon monoxide is finally reduced to metal and collects as a liquid in the bottom of the furnace,
the slag floating on the molten iron. After a considerable amount of the iron has collected
the slag is drawn off through the opening P. The molten iron is then drawn off into large ladles
and taken to the converters for the manufacture of steel, or it is run out into sand molds,
forming the bars or ingots called "pigs." The process is a continuous one, and when once started
it is kept in operation for months or even years without interruption.

     It seems probable that the first product of combustion of the
     carbon, at the point where the tuyers enter the furnace, is
     carbon dioxide. This is at once reduced to carbon monoxide by
     the intensely heated carbon present, so that no carbon dioxide
     can be found at that point. For practical purposes, therefore,
     we may consider that carbon monoxide is the first product of
     combustion.

~Varieties of iron.~ The iron of commerce is never pure, but contains varying amounts of other
elements, such as carbon, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, and manganese. These elements may either
be alloyed with the iron or may be combined with it in the form of definite chemical compounds.
In some instances, as in the case of graphite, the mixture may be merely mechanical.

The properties of iron are very much modified by the presence of these elements and by the
form of the combination between them and the iron; the way in which the metal is treated during
its preparation has also a marked influence on its properties. Owing to these facts many kinds
of iron are recognized in commerce, the chief varieties being cast iron, wrought iron, and steel.

~Cast iron.~ The product of the blast furnace, prepared as just described, is called cast iron.
It varies considerably in composition, usually containing from 90 to 95% iron, the remainder
being largely carbon and silicon with smaller amounts of phosphorus and sulphur. When the melted
metal from the blast furnace is allowed to cool rapidly most of the carbon remains in chemical
combination with the iron, and the product is called white cast iron. If the cooling goes on
slowly, the carbon partially separates as flakes of graphite which remain scattered through
the metal. This product is softer and darker in color and is called gray cast iron.

~Properties of cast iron.~ Cast iron is hard, brittle, and rather easily melted (melting point
about 1100°). It cannot be welded or forged into shape, but is easily cast in sand molds. It
is strong and rigid but not elastic. It is used for making castings and in the manufacture
of other kinds of iron. Cast iron, which contains the metal manganese up to the extent of 20%,
together with about 3% carbon, is called spiegel iron; when more than this amount of manganese
is present the product is called ferromanganese. The ferromanganese may contain as much as
80% manganese. These varieties of cast iron are much used in the manufacture of steel.

~Wrought iron.~ Wrought iron is made by burning out from cast iron most of the carbon, silicon,
phosphorus, and sulphur which it contains. The process is called puddling, and is carried out
in a furnace constructed as represented in Fig. 86. The floor of the furnace F is somewhat
concave and is made of iron covered with a layer of iron oxide. A long flame produced by burning
fuel upon the grate G is directed downward upon the materials placed upon the floor, and the
draught is maintained by the stack S. A is the ash box and T a trap to catch the solid particles
carried into the stack by the draught. Upon the floor of the furnace is placed the charge of
cast iron, together with a small amount of material to make a slag. The iron is soon melted
by the flame directed upon it, and the sulphur, phosphorus, and silicon are oxidized by the
iron oxide, forming oxides which are anhydrides of acids. These combine with the flux, which
is basic in character, or with the iron oxide, to form a slag. The carbon is also oxidized
and escapes as carbon dioxide. As the iron is freed from other elements it becomes pasty, owing
to the higher melting point of the purer iron, and in this condition forms small lumps which
are raked together into a larger one. The large lump is then removed from the furnace and rolled
or hammered into bars, the slag; being squeezed out in this process. The product has a stranded
or fibrous structure. The product of a puddling furnace is called wrought iron.

~Properties of wrought iron.~ Wrought iron is nearly pure iron, usually containing about 0.3%
of other substances, chiefly carbon. It is tough, malleable, and fibrous in structure. It is
easily bent and is not elastic, so it will not sustain pressure as well as cast iron. It can
be drawn out into wire of great tensile strength, and can also be rolled into thin sheets (sheet
iron). It melts at a high temperature (about 1600°) and is therefore forged into shape rather
than cast. If melted, it would lose its fibrous structure and be changed into a low carbon steel.

~Steel.~ Steel, like wrought iron, is made by burning out from cast iron a part of the carbon,
silicon, phosphorus, and sulphur which it contains; but the process is carried out in a very
different way, and usually, though not always, more carbon is found in steel than in wrought
iron. A number of processes are in use, but nearly all the steel of commerce is made by one
of the two following methods.

1. Bessemer process. This process, invented about 1860, is by far the most important. It is
carried out in great egg-shaped crucibles called converters (Fig. 87), each one of which will
hold as much as 15 tons of steel. The converter is built of steel and lined with silica. It
is mounted on trunnions T, so that it can be tipped over on its side for filling and emptying.
One of the trunnions is hollow and a pipe P connects it with an air chamber A, which forms
a false bottom to the converter. The true bottom is perforated, so that air can be forced in
by an air blast admitted through the trunnion and the air chamber.

White-hot, liquid cast iron from a blast furnace is run into the converter through its open
necklike top O, the converter being tipped over to receive it; the air blast is then turned
on and the converter rotated to a nearly vertical position. The elements in the iron are rapidly
oxidized, the silicon first and then the carbon. The heat liberated in the oxidation, largely
due to the combustion of silicon, keeps the iron in a molten condition. When the carbon is
practically all burned out cast iron or spiegel iron, containing a known percentage of carbon,
is added and allowed to mix thoroughly with the fluid. The steel is then run into molds, and
the ingots so formed are hammered or rolled into rails or other forms. By this process any
desired percentage of carbon can be added to the steel. Low carbon steel, which does not differ
much from wrought iron in composition, is now made in this way and is replacing the more expensive
wrought iron for many purposes.

     ~The basic lining process.~ When the cast iron contains
     phosphorus and sulphur in appreciable quantities, the lining of
     the converter is made of dolomite. The silicon and carbon burn,
     followed by the phosphorus and sulphur, and the anhydrides of
     acids so formed combine with the basic oxides of the lining,
     forming a slag. This is known as the basic lining process.

2. Open-hearth process. In this process a furnace very similar to a puddling furnace is used,
but it is lined with silica or dolomite instead of iron oxide. A charge consisting in part
of old scrap iron of any kind and in part of cast iron is melted in the furnace by a gas flame.
The silicon and carbon are slowly burned away, and when a test shows that the desired percentage
of carbon is present the steel is run out of the furnace. Steel may therefore be defined as
the product of the Bessemer or open-hearth processes.

~Properties of steel.~ Bessemer and open-hearth steel usually contain only a few tenths of
a per cent of carbon, less than 0.1% silicon, and a very much smaller quantity of phosphorus
and sulphur. Any considerable amount of the latter elements makes the steel brittle, the sulphur
affecting it when hot, and the phosphorus when cold. This kind of steel is used for structural
purposes, for rails, and for nearly all large steel articles. It is hard, malleable, ductile,
and melts at a lower temperature than wrought iron. It can be forged into shape, rolled into
sheets, or cast in molds.

~Relation of the three varieties of iron.~ It will be seen that wrought iron is usually very
nearly pure iron, while steel contains an appreciable amount of alloy material, chiefly carbon,
and cast iron still more of the same substances. It is impossible, however, to assign a given
sample of iron to one of these three classes on the basis of its chemical composition alone.
A low carbon steel, for example, may contain less carbon than a given sample of wrought iron.
The real distinction between the three is the process by which they are made. The product of
the blast furnace is cast iron; that of the puddling furnace is wrought iron; that of the Bessemer
and open-hearth methods is steel.

~Tool steel.~ Steel designed for use in the manufacture of edged tools and similar articles
should be relatively free from silicon and phosphorus, but should contain from 0.5 to 1.5%
carbon. The percentage of carbon should be regulated by the exact use to which the steel is
to be put. Steel of this character is usually made in small lots from either Bessemer or open-hearth
steel in the following way.

A charge of melted steel is placed in a large crucible and the calculated quantity of pure
carbon is added. The carbon dissolves in the steel, and when the solution is complete the metal
is poured out of the crucible. This is sometimes called crucible steel.

~Tempering of steel.~ Steel containing from 0.5 to 1.5% carbon is characterized by the property
of "taking temper." When the hot steel is suddenly cooled by plunging it into water or oil
it becomes very hard and brittle. On carefully reheating this hard form it gradually becomes
less brittle and softer, so that by regulating the temperature to which steel is reheated in
tempering almost any condition of temper demanded for a given purpose, such as for making springs
or cutting tools, can be obtained.

~Steel alloys.~ It has been found that small quantities of a number of different elements when
alloyed with steel very much improve its quality for certain purposes, each element having
a somewhat different effect. Among the elements most used in this connection are manganese,
silicon, chromium, nickel, tungsten, and molybdenum.

The usual method for adding these elements to the steel is to first prepare a very rich alloy
of iron with the element to be added, and then add enough of this alloy to a large quantity
of the steel to bring it to the desired composition. A rich alloy of iron with manganese or
silicon can be prepared directly in a blast furnace, and is called ferromanganese or ferrosilicon.
Similar alloys of iron with the other elements mentioned are made in an electric furnace by
reducing the mixed oxides with carbon.

~Pure iron.~ Perfectly pure iron is rarely prepared and is not adapted to commercial uses.
It can be made by reducing pure oxide of iron in a current of hydrogen at a high temperature.
Prepared in this way it forms a black powder; when melted it forms a tin-white metal which
is less fusible and more malleable than wrought iron. It is easily acted upon by moist air.

~Compounds of iron.~ Iron differs from the metals so far studied in that it is able to form
two series of compounds in which the iron has two different valences. In the one series the
iron is divalent and forms compounds which in formulas and many chemical properties are similar
to the corresponding zinc compounds. It can also act as a trivalent metal, and in this condition
forms salts similar to those of aluminium. Those compounds in which the iron is divalent are
known as ferrous compounds, while those in which it is trivalent are known as ferric.

~Oxides of iron.~ Iron forms several oxides. Ferrous oxide (FeO) is not found in nature, but
can be prepared artificially in the form of a black powder which easily takes up oxygen, forming
ferric oxide:

    2FeO + O = Fe{2}O{3}.

Ferric oxide is the most abundant ore of iron and occurs in great deposits, especially in the
Lake Superior region. It is found in many mineral varieties which vary in density and color,
the most abundant being hematite, which ranges in color from red to nearly black. When prepared
by chemical processes it forms a red powder which is used as a paint pigment (Venetian red)
and as a polishing powder (rouge).

Magnetite has the formula Fe{3}O{4} and is a combination of FeO and Fe{2}O{3}. It is a very
valuable ore, but is less abundant than hematite. It is sometimes called magnetic oxide of
iron, or lodestone, since it is a natural magnet.

~Ferrous salts.~ These salts are obtained by dissolving iron in the appropriate acid, or, when
insoluble, by precipitation. They are usually light green in color and crystallize well. In
chemical reactions they are quite similar to the salts of magnesium and zinc, but differ from
them in one important respect, namely, that they are easily changed into compounds in which
the metal is trivalent. Thus ferrous chloride treated with chlorine or aqua regia is changed
into ferric chloride:

    FeCl{2} + Cl = FeCl{3}.

Ferrous hydroxide exposed to moist air is rapidly changed into ferric hydroxide:

    2Fe(OH){2} + H{2}O + O = 2Fe(OH){3}.

~Ferrous sulphate~ (copperas, green vitriol) (FeSO{4}·7H{2}O). Ferrous sulphate is the most
familiar ferrous compound. It is prepared commercially as a by-product in the steel-plate mills.
Steel plates are cleaned by the action of dilute sulphuric acid upon them, and in the process
some of the iron dissolves. The liquors are concentrated and the green vitriol separates from them.

~Ferrous sulphide~ (FeS). Ferrous sulphide is sometimes found in nature as a golden-yellow
crystalline mineral. It is formed as a black precipitate when a soluble sulphide and an iron
salt are brought together in solution:

    FeSO{4} + Na{2}S = FeS + Na{2}SO{4}.

It can also be made as a heavy dark-brown solid by fusing together the requisite quantities
of sulphur and iron. It is obtained as a by-product in the metallurgy of lead:

    PbS + Fe = FeS + Pb.

It is used in the laboratory in the preparation of hydrosulphuric acid:

    FeS + 2HCl = FeCl{2} + H{2}S.

~Iron disulphide~ (pyrites) (FeS{2}). This substance bears the same relation to ferrous sulphide
that hydrogen dioxide does to water. It occurs abundantly in nature in the form of brass-yellow
cubical crystals and in compact masses. Sometimes the name "fool's gold" is applied to it from
its superficial resemblance to the precious metal.

~Ferrous carbonate~ (FeCO{3}). This compound occurs in nature as siderite, and is a valuable
ore. It will dissolve to some extent in water containing carbon dioxide, just as will calcium
carbonate, and waters containing it are called chalybeate waters. These chalybeate waters are
supposed to possess certain medicinal virtues and form an important class of mineral waters.

~Ferric salts.~ Ferric salts are usually obtained by treating an acidified solution of a ferrous
salt with an oxidizing agent:

    2FeCl{2} + 2HCl + O = 2FeCl{3} + H{2}O,

    2FeSO{4} + H{2}SO{4} + O = Fe{2}(SO{4}){3} + H{2}O.

They are usually yellow or violet in color, are quite soluble, and as a rule do not crystallize
well. Heated with water in the absence of free acid, they hydrolyze even more readily than
the salts of aluminium. The most familiar ferric salts are the chloride and the sulphate.

~Ferric chloride~ (FeCl{3}). This salt can be obtained most conveniently by dissolving iron
in hydrochloric acid and then passing chlorine into the solution:

    Fe + 2HCl = FeCl{2} + 2H,

    FeCl{2} + Cl = FeCl{3}.

When the pure salt is heated with water it is partly hydrolyzed:

    FeCl{3} + 3 H{2}O <--> Fe(OH){3} + 3HCl.

This is a reversible reaction, however, and hydrolysis can therefore be prevented by first
adding a considerable amount of the soluble product of the reaction, namely, hydrochloric acid.

~Ferric sulphate~ (Fe{2}(SO{4}){3}). This compound can be made by treating an acid solution
of green vitriol with an oxidizing agent. It is difficult to crystallize and hard to obtain
in pure condition. When an alkali sulphate in proper quantity is added to ferric sulphate in
solution an iron alum is formed, and is easily obtained in large crystals. The best known iron
alums have the formulas KFe(SO{4}){2}·12H{2}O and NH{4}Fe(SO{4}){2}·12H{2}O. They are commonly
used when a pure ferric salt is required.

~Ferric hydroxide~ (Fe(OH){3}). When solutions of ferric salts are treated with ammonium hydroxide,
ferric hydroxide is formed as a rusty-red precipitate, insoluble in water.

~Iron cyanides.~ A large number of complex cyanides containing iron are known, the most important
being potassium ferrocyanide, or yellow prussiate of potash (K{4}FeC{6}N{6}), and potassium
ferricyanide, or red prussiate of potash (K{3}FeC{6}N{6}). These compounds are the potassium
salts of the complex acids of the formulas H{4}FeC{6}N{6} and H{3}FeC{6}N{6}. The same equation
may be written

    2Fe^{++}, 2SO{4}^{--} + 2H^{+}, SO{4}^{--} + O
      = 2Fe^{+++}, 3SO{4}^{--} + H{2}O.

Hydrogen ions have been oxidized to water, while the charge of each iron ion has been increased
from 2 to 3.

In a similar way the conversion of ferrous chloride into ferric chloride may be written

    Fe^{++}, 2Cl^{-} + Cl = Fe^{+++}, + 3Cl^{-}.

Here again the valence of the iron and the charge on the iron ion has been increased from 2
to 3, though no oxygen has entered into the reaction. As a rule, however, changes of this kind
are brought about by the use of an oxidizing agent, and are called oxidations.

The term "oxidation" is applied to all reactions in which the valence of the metal of a compound
is increased, or, in other words, to all reactions in which the charge of a cation is increased.

~Reduction of ferric salts.~ The changes which take place when a ferric salt is converted into
a ferrous salt are the reverse of the ones just described. This is seen in the equation

    FeCl{3} + H = FeCl{2} + HCl

In this reaction the valence of the iron has been changed from 3 to 2. The same equation may
be written

    Fe^{+++}, 3Cl{-} + H = Fe^{++}, + H^{+} + 3Cl{-}

It will be seen that the charge of the iron ions has been diminished from 3 to 2. Since these
changes are the reverse of the oxidation changes just considered, they are called reduction
reactions. The term "reduction" is applied to all processes in which the valence of the metal
of a compound is diminished, or, in other words, to all processes in which the charge on the
cations is diminished.

NICKEL AND COBALT

These elements occur sparingly in nature, usually combined with arsenic or with arsenic and
sulphur. Both elements have been found in the free state in meteorites. Like iron they form
two series of compounds, but the salts corresponding to the ferrous salts are the most common,
the ones corresponding to the ferric salts being difficult to obtain. Thus we have the chlorides
NiCl{2}·6H{2}O and CoCl{2}·6H{2}O; the sulphates NiSO{4}·7H{2}O and CoSO{4}·7H{2}O; the nitrates
Ni(NO{3}){2}·6H{2}O and Co(NO{3}){2}·6H{2}O.

Nickel is largely used as an alloy with other metals. Alloyed with copper it forms coin metal
from which five-cent pieces are made, with copper and zinc it forms German silver, and when
added to steel in small quantities nickel steel is formed which is much superior to common
steel for certain purposes. When deposited by electrolysis upon the surface of other metals
such as iron, it forms a covering which will take a high polish and protects the metal from
rust, nickel not being acted upon by moist air. Salts of nickel are usually green.

Compounds of cobalt fused with glass give it an intensely blue color. In powdered form such
glass is sometimes used as a pigment called smalt. Cobalt salts, which contain water of crystallization,
are usually cherry red in color; when dehydrated they become blue.

==================================================================

~The family.~ By referring to the periodic arrangement of the elements (page 168), it will
be seen that mercury is not included in the same family with copper and silver. Since the metallurgy
of the three elements is so similar, however, and since they resemble each other so closely
in chemical properties, it is convenient to class them together for study.

1. Occurrence. The three elements occur in nature to some extent in the free state, but are
usually found as sulphides. Their ores are easy to reduce.

2. Properties. They are heavy metals of high luster and are especially good conductors of heat
and electricity. They are not very active chemically. Neither hydrochloric nor dilute sulphuric
acid has any appreciable action upon them. Concentrated sulphuric acid attacks all three, forming
metallic sulphates and evolving sulphur dioxide, while nitric acid, both dilute and concentrated,
converts them into nitrates with the evolution of oxides of nitrogen.

3. Two series of salts. Copper and mercury form oxides of the types M{2}O and MO, as well as
two series of salts. In one series the metals are univalent and the salts have formulas like
those of the sodium salts. They are called cuprous and mercurous salts. In the other series
the metals are divalent and resemble magnesium salts in formulas. These are called cupric and
mercuric salts. Silver forms only one series of salts, being always a univalent metal.

COPPER

~Occurrence.~ The element copper has been used for various purposes since the earliest days
of history. It is often found in the metallic state in nature, large masses of it occurring
pure in the Lake Superior region and in other places to a smaller extent. The most valuable
ores are the following:

    Cuprite         Cu{2}O.
    Chalcocite      Cu{2}S.
    Chalcopyrite    CuFeS{2}.
    Bornite         Cu{3}FeS{3}.
    Malachite       CuCO{3}·Cu(OH){2}.
    Azurite         2CuCO{3}·Cu(OH){2}.

~Metallurgy of copper.~ Ores containing little or no sulphur are easy to reduce. They are first
crushed and the earthy impurities washed away. The concentrated ore is then mixed with carbon
and heated in a furnace, metallic copper resulting from the reduction of the copper oxide by
the hot carbon.

     ~Metallurgy of sulphide ores.~ Much of the copper of commerce is
     made from chalcopyrite and bornite, and these ores are more
     difficult to work. They are first roasted in the air, by which
     treatment much of the sulphur is burned to sulphur dioxide. The
     roasted ore is then melted in a small blast furnace or in an
     open one like a puddling furnace. In melting, part of the iron
     combines with silica to form a slag of iron silicate. The
     product, called crude matte, contains about 50% copper together
     with sulphur and iron. Further purification is commonly carried
     on by a process very similar to the Bessemer process for steel.
     The converter is lined with silica, and a charge of matte from
     the melting furnace, together with sand, is introduced, and air
     is blown into the mass. By this means the sulphur is
     practically all burned out by the air, and the remaining iron
     combines with silica and goes off as slag. The copper is poured
     out of the converter and molded into anode plates for refining.

~Refining of copper.~ Impure copper is purified by electrolysis. A large plate of it, serving
as an anode, is suspended in a tank facing a thin plate of pure copper, which is the cathode.
The tank is filled with a solution of copper sulphate and sulphuric acid to serve as the electrolyte.
A current from a dynamo passes from the anode to the cathode, and the copper, dissolving from
the anode, is deposited upon the cathode in pure form, while the impurities collect on the
bottom of the tank. Electrolytic copper is one of the purest of commercial metals and is very
nearly pure copper.

     ~Recovery of gold and silver.~ Gold and silver are often present
     in small quantities in copper ores, and in electrolytic
     refining these metals collect in the muddy deposit on the
     bottom of the tank. The mud is carefully worked over from time
     to time and the precious metals extracted from it. A surprising
     amount of gold and silver is obtained in this way.

~Properties of copper.~ Copper is a rather heavy metal of density 8.9, and has a characteristic
reddish color. It is rather soft and is very malleable, ductile, and flexible, yet tough and
strong; it melts at 1084°. As a conductor of heat and electrical energy it is second only to
silver.

Hydrochloric acid, dilute sulphuric acid, and fused alkalis are almost without action upon
it; nitric acid and hot, concentrated sulphuric acid, however, readily dissolve it. In moist
air it slowly becomes covered with a thin layer of green basic carbonate; heated in the air
it is easily oxidized to black copper oxide (CuO).

~Uses.~ Copper is extensively used for electrical purposes, for roofs and cornices, for sheathing
the bottom of ships, and for making alloys. In the following table the composition of some
of these alloys is indicated:

COMPOSITION OF ALLOYS OF COPPER IN PERCENTAGES

    Aluminium bronze copper (90 to 97%), aluminium (3 to 10%).
    Brass copper (63 to 73%), zinc (27 to 37%).
    Bronze copper (70 to 95%), zinc (1 to 25%), tin (1 to 18%).
    German silver copper (56 to 60%), zinc (20%), nickel (20 to 25%).
    Gold coin copper (10%), gold (90%).
    Gun metal copper (90%), tin (10%).
    Nickel coin copper (75%), nickel (25%)
    Silver coin copper (10%), silver (90%).

     ~Electrotyping.~ Matter is often printed from electrotype plates
     which are prepared as follows. The matter is set up in type and
     wax is firmly pressed down upon the face of it until a clear
     impression is obtained. The impressed side of the wax is coated
     with graphite and the impression is made the cathode in an
     electrolytic cell containing a copper salt in solution. When
     connected with a current the copper is deposited as a thin
     sheet upon the letters in wax, and when detached is a perfect
     copy of the type, the under part of the letters being hollow.
     The sheet is strengthened by pouring on the under surface a
     suitable amount of molten metal (commercial lead is used). The
     sheet so strengthened is then used in printing.

~Two series of copper compounds.~ Copper, like iron, forms two series of compounds: in the
cuprous compounds it is univalent; in the cupric it is divalent. The cupric salts are much
the more common of the two, since the cuprous salts pass readily into cupric by oxidation.

~Cuprous compounds.~ The most important cuprous compound is the oxide (Cu{2}O), which occurs
in nature as ruby copper or cuprite. It is a bright red substance and can easily be prepared
by heating copper to a high temperature in a limited supply of air. It is used for imparting
a ruby color to glass.

By treating cuprous oxide with different acids a number of cuprous salts can be made. Many
of these are insoluble in water, the chloride (CuCl) being the best known. When suspended in
dilute hydrochloric acid it is changed into cupric chloride, the oxygen taking part in the
reaction being absorbed from the air:

    2CuCl + 2HCl + O = 2CuCl{2} + H{2}O.

~Cupric compounds.~ Cupric salts are easily made by dissolving cupric oxide in acids, or, when
insoluble, by precipitation. Most of them are blue or green in color, and the soluble ones
crystallize well. Since they are so much more familiar than the cuprous salts, they are frequently
called merely copper salts.

~Cupric oxide~ (CuO). This is a black insoluble substance obtained by heating copper in excess
of air, or by igniting the hydroxide or nitrate. It is used as an oxidizing agent.

~Cupric hydroxide~ (Cu(OH){2}). The hydroxide prepared by treating a solution of a copper salt
with sodium hydroxide is a light blue insoluble substance which easily loses water and changes
into the oxide. Heat applied to the liquid containing the hydroxide suspended in it serves
to bring about the reaction represented by the equation

    Cu(OH){2} = CuO + H{2}O.

~Cupric sulphate~ (blue vitriol) (CuSO{4}·5H{2}O). This substance, called blue vitriol or bluestone,
is obtained as a by-product in a number of processes and is produced in very large quantities.
It forms large blue crystals, which lose water when heated and crumble to a white powder. The
salt finds many uses, especially in electrotyping and in making electrical batteries.

~Cupric sulphide~ (CuS). The insoluble black sulphide (CuS) is easily prepared by the action
of hydrosulphuric acid upon a solution of a copper salt:

    CuSO{4} + H{2}S = CuS + H{2}SO{4}.

It is insoluble in water and dilute acids.

MERCURY

~Occurrence.~ Mercury occurs in nature chiefly as the sulphide (HgS) called cinnabar, and in
globules of metal inclosed in the cinnabar. The mercury mines of Spain have long been famous,
California being the next largest producer.

~Metallurgy.~ Mercury is a volatile metal which has but little affinity for oxygen. Sulphur,
on the other hand, readily combines with oxygen. These facts make the metallurgy of mercury
very simple. The crushed ore, mixed with a small amount of carbon to reduce any oxide or sulphate
that might be formed, is roasted in a current of air. The sulphur burns to sulphur dioxide,
while the mercury is converted into vapor and is condensed in a series of condensing vessels.
The metal is purified by distillation.

~Properties.~ Mercury is a heavy silvery liquid with a density of 13.596. It boils at 357°
and solidifies at -39.5°. Small quantities of many metals dissolve in it, forming liquid alloys,
while with larger quantities it forms solid alloys. The alloys of mercury are called amalgams.

Toward acids mercury conducts itself very much like copper; it is easily attacked by nitric
and hot, concentrated sulphuric acids, while cold sulphuric and hydrochloric acids have no
effect on it.

~Uses.~ Mercury is extensively used in the construction of scientific instruments, such as
the thermometer and barometer, and as a liquid over which to collect gases which are soluble
in water. The readiness with which it alloys with silver and gold makes it very useful in the
extraction of these elements.

~Compounds of mercury.~ Like copper, mercury forms two series of compounds: the mercurous,
of which mercurous chloride (HgCl) is an example; and the mercuric, represented by mercuric
chloride (HgCl{2}).

~Mercuric oxide~ (HgO). Mercuric oxide can be obtained either as a brick-red or as a yellow
substance. When mercuric nitrate is heated carefully the red modification is formed in accordance
with the equation

    Hg(NO{3}){2} = HgO + 2NO{2} + O.

The yellow modification is prepared by adding a solution of a mercuric salt to a solution of
sodium or potassium hydroxide:

    Hg(NO{3}){2} + 2NaOH = 2NaNO{3} + Hg(OH){2},

    Hg(OH){2} = HgO + H{2}O.

When heated the oxide darkens until it becomes almost black; at a higher temperature it decomposes
into mercury and oxygen. It was by this reaction that oxygen was discovered.

~Mercurous chloride~ (calomel) (HgCl). Being insoluble, mercurous chloride is precipitated
as a white solid when a soluble chloride is added to a solution of mercurous nitrate:

    HgNO{3} + NaCl = HgCl + NaNO{3}.

Commercially it is manufactured by heating a mixture of mercuric chloride and mercury. When
exposed to the light it slowly changes into mercuric chloride and mercury:

    2HgCl = HgCl{2} + Hg.

It is therefore protected from the light by the use of colored bottles. It is used in medicine.

Most mercurous salts are insoluble in water, the principal soluble one being the nitrate, which
is made by the action of cold, dilute nitric acid on mercury.

~Mercuric chloride~ (corrosive sublimate) (HgCl{2}). This substance can be made by dissolving
mercuric oxide in hydrochloric acid. On a commercial scale it is made by subliming a mixture
of common salt and mercuric sulphate:

    2NaCl + HgSO{4} = HgCl{2} + Na{2}SO{4}.

The mercuric chloride, being readily volatile, vaporizes and is condensed again in cool vessels.
Like mercurous chloride it is a white solid, but differs from it in that it is soluble in water.
It is extremely poisonous and in dilute solutions is used as an antiseptic in dressing wounds.

~Mercuric sulphide~ (HgS). As cinnabar this substance forms the chief native compound of mercury,
occurring in red crystalline masses. By passing hydrosulphuric acid into a solution of a mercuric
salt it is precipitated as a black powder, insoluble in water and acids. By other means it
can be prepared as a brilliant red powder known as vermilion, which is used as a pigment in
fine paints.

     ~The iodides of mercury.~ If a solution of potassium iodide is
     added to solutions of a mercurous and a mercuric salt
     respectively, the corresponding iodides are precipitated.
     Mercuric iodide is the more important of the two, and as
     prepared above is a red powder which changes to yellow on
     heating to 150°. The yellow form on cooling changes back again
     to the red form, or may be made to do so by rubbing it with a
     knife blade or some other hard object.

SILVER

~Occurrence.~ Silver is found in small quantities in the uncombined state; usually, however,
it occurs in combination with sulphur, either as the sulphide (Ag{2}S) or as a small constituent
of other sulphides, especially those of lead and copper. It is also found alloyed with gold.

~Metallurgy.~ Parkes's process. Silver is usually smelted in connection with lead. The ores
are worked over together, as described under lead, and the lead and silver obtained as an alloy,
the silver being present in small quantity. The alloy is melted and metallic zinc is stirred
in. Zinc will alloy with silver but not with lead, and it is found that the silver leaves the
lead and, in the form of an alloy with zinc, forms as a crust upon the lead and is skimmed
off. This crust, which, of course, contains lead adhering to it, is partially melted and the
most of the lead drained off. The zinc is removed by distillation, and the residue is melted
on an open hearth in a current of air; by this means the zinc and lead remaining with the silver
are changed into oxides and the silver remains behind unaltered.

     ~Amalgamation process.~ In some localities the old amalgamation
     process is used. The silver ore is treated with common salt and
     ferrous compounds, which process converts the silver first into
     chloride and then into metallic silver. Mercury is then added
     and thoroughly mixed with the mass, forming an amalgam with the
     silver. After some days the earthy materials are washed away
     and the heavier amalgam is recovered. The mercury is distilled
     off and the silver left in impure form.

~Refining silver.~ The silver obtained by either of the above processes may still contain copper,
gold, and iron, and is refined by "parting" with sulphuric acid. The metal is heated with strong
sulphuric acid which dissolves the silver, copper, and iron present, but not the gold. In the
solution of silver sulphate so obtained copper plates are suspended, upon which the pure silver
precipitates, the copper going into solution as sulphate, as shown in the equation

    Ag{2}SO{4} + Cu = 2Ag + CuSO{4}.

The solution obtained as a by-product in this process furnishes most of the blue vitriol of
commerce. Silver is also refined by electrolytic methods similar to those used in refining copper.

~Properties of silver.~ Silver is a heavy, rather soft, white metal, very ductile and malleable
and capable of taking a high polish. It surpasses all other metals as a conductor of heat and
electricity, but is too costly to find extensive use for such purposes. It melts at a little
lower temperature than copper (961°). It alloys readily with other heavy metals, and when it
is to be used for coinage a small amount of copper--from 8 to 10%--is nearly always melted
with it to give it hardness.

It is not acted upon by water or air, but is quickly tarnished when in contact with sulphur
compounds, turning quite black in time. Hydrochloric acid and fused alkalis do not act upon
it, but nitric acid and hot, concentrated sulphuric acid dissolve it with ease.

     ~Electroplating.~ Since silver is not acted upon by water or air,
     and has a pleasing appearance, it is used to coat various
     articles made of cheaper metals. Such articles are said to be
     silver plated. The process by which this is done is called
     electroplating. It is carried on as follows: The object to be
     plated (such as a spoon) is attached to a wire and dipped into
     a solution of a silver salt. Electrical connection is made in
     such a way that the article to be plated serves as the cathode,
     while the anode is made up of one or more plates of silver
     (Fig. 88, A). When a current is passed through the
     electrolyte silver dissolves from the anode plate and deposits
     on the cathode in the form of a closely adhering layer. By
     making the proper change in the electrolyte and anode plate
     objects may be plated with gold and other metals.

~Compounds of silver.~ Silver forms two oxides but only one series of salts, namely, the one
which corresponds to the mercurous and cuprous series.

~Silver nitrate~ (lunar caustic) (AgNO{3}). This salt is easily prepared by dissolving silver
in nitric acid and evaporating the resulting solution. It crystallizes in flat plates, and
when heated carefully can be melted without decomposition. When cast into sticks it is called
lunar caustic, for it has a very corrosive action on flesh, and is sometimes used in surgery
to burn away abnormal growths.

     The alchemists designated the metals by the names of the
     heavenly bodies. The moon (luna) was the symbol for silver;
     hence the name "lunar caustic."

~Silver sulphide~ (Ag{2}S). This occurs in nature and constitutes one of the principal ores
of silver. It can be obtained in the form of a black solid by passing hydrosulphuric acid through
a solution of silver nitrate.

~Compounds of silver with the halogens.~ The chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver are insoluble
in water and acids, and are therefore precipitated by bringing together a soluble halogen salt
with silver nitrate:

    AgNO{3} + KCl = AgCl + KNO{3}.

They are remarkable for the fact that they are very sensitive to the action of light, undergoing
a change of color and chemical composition when exposed to sunlight, especially if in contact
with organic matter such as gelatin.

     ~Photography.~ The art of photography is based on the fact that
     the halogen compounds of silver are affected by the light,
     particularly in the presence of organic matter. From a chemical
     standpoint the processes involved may be described under two
     heads: (1) the preparation of the negative; (2) the preparation
     of the print.

     1. Preparation of the negative. The plate used in the
     preparation of the negative is made by spreading a thin layer
     of gelatin, in which silver bromide is suspended (silver iodide
     is sometimes added also), over a glass plate or celluloid film
     and allowing it to dry. When the plate so prepared is placed in
     a camera and the image of some object is focused upon it, the
     silver salt undergoes a change which is proportional at each
     point to the intensity of the light falling upon it. In this
     way an image of the object photographed is produced upon the
     plate, which is, however, invisible and is therefore called
     "latent." It can be made visible by the process of developing.

     To develop the image the exposed plate is immersed in a
     solution of some reducing agent called the developer. The
     developer reduces that portion of the silver salt which has
     been affected by the light, depositing it in the form of black
     metallic silver which closely adheres to the plate.

     The unaffected silver salt, upon which the developer has no
     action, must now be removed from the plate. This is done by
     immersing the plate in a solution of sodium thiosulphate
     (hypo). After the silver salt has been dissolved off, the plate
     is washed with water and dried. The plate so prepared is
     called the negative because it is a picture of the object
     photographed, with the lights exactly reversed. This is called
     fixing the negative.

     2. Preparation of the print. The print is made from paper
     which is prepared in the same way as the negative plate. The
     negative is placed upon this paper and exposed to the light in
     such a way that the light must pass through the negative before
     striking the paper. If the paper is coated with silver
     chloride, a visible image is produced, in which case a
     developer is not needed. The proofs are made in this way. In
     order to make them permanent the unchanged silver chloride must
     be dissolved off with sodium thiosulphate. The print is then
     toned by dipping it into a solution of gold or platinum salts.
     The silver on the print passes into solution, while the gold or
     platinum takes its place. These metals give a characteristic
     color or tone to the print, the gold making it reddish brown,
     while the platinum gives it a steel-gray tone. If a silver
     bromide paper is used in making the print, a latent image is
     produced which must be developed as in the case of the negative
     itself. The silver bromide is much more sensitive than the
     chloride, so that the printing can be done in artificial light.
     Since the darkest places on the negative cut off the most
     light, it is evident that the lights of the print will be the
     reverse of those of the negative, and will therefore correspond
     to those of the object photographed. The print is therefore
     called the positive.

Lead |   Pb   |  206.9 |  11.38  |   327°  | PbO Pb{3}O{4} PbO{2}
====================================================================

~The family.~ Tin and lead, together with silicon and germanium, form a family in Group IV
of the periodic table. Silicon has been discussed along with the non-metals, while germanium,
on account of its rarity, needs only to be mentioned.

The other family of Group IV includes carbon, already described, and a number of rare elements.

TIN

~Occurrence.~ Tin is found in nature chiefly as the oxide (SnO{2}), called cassiterite or tinstone.
The most famous mines are those of Cornwall in England, and of the Malay Peninsula and East
India Islands; in small amounts tinstone is found in many other localities.

~Metallurgy.~ The metallurgy of tin is very simple. The ore, separated as far as possible from
earthy materials, is mixed with carbon and heated in a furnace, the reduction taking place
readily. The equation is

    SnO{2} + C = Sn + CO{2}.

The metal is often purified by carefully heating it until it is partly melted; the pure tin
melts first and can be drained away from the impurities.

~Properties.~ Pure tin, called block tin, is a soft white metal with a silver-like appearance
and luster; it melts readily (235°) and is somewhat lighter than copper, having a density of
7.3. It is quite malleable and can be rolled out into very thin sheets, forming tin foil; most
tin foil, however, contains a good deal of lead.

Under ordinary conditions it is quite unchanged by air or moisture, but at a high temperature
it burns in air, forming the oxide SnO{2}. Dilute acids have no effect upon it, but concentrated
acids attack it readily. Concentrated hydrochloric acid changes it into the chloride

    Sn + 2HCl = SnCl{2} + 2H.

With sulphuric acid tin sulphate and sulphur dioxide are formed:

    Sn + 2H{2}SO{4} = SnSO{4} + SO{2} + 2H{2}O

Concentrated nitric acid oxidizes it, forming a white insoluble compound of the formula H{2}SnO{3},
called metastannic acid:

    3Sn + 4HNO{3} + H{2}O = 3H{2}SnO{3} + 4NO.

~Uses of tin.~ A great deal of tin is made into tin plate by dipping thin steel sheets into
the melted metal. Owing to the way in which tin resists the action of air and dilute acids,
tin plate is used in many ways, such as in roofing, and in the manufacture of tin cans, cooking
vessels, and similar articles.

Many useful alloys contain tin, some of which have been mentioned in connection with copper.
When tin is alloyed with other metals of low melting point, soft, easily melted alloys are
formed which are used for friction bearings in machinery; tin, antimony, lead, and bismuth
are the chief constituents of these alloys. Pewter and soft solder are alloys of tin and lead.

~Compounds of tin.~ Tin forms two series of compounds: the stannous, in which the tin is divalent,
illustrated in the compounds SnO, SnS, SnCl{2}; the stannic, in which it is tetravalent as
shown in the compounds SnO{2}, SnS{2}. There is also an acid, H{2}SnO{3}, called stannic acid,
which forms a series of salts called stannates. While this acid has the same composition as
metastannic acid, the two are quite different in their chemical properties. This difference
is probably due to the different arrangement of the atoms in the molecules of the two substances.
Only a few compounds of tin need be mentioned.

~Stannic oxide~ (SnO{2}). Stannic oxide is of interest, since it is the chief compound of tin
found in nature. It is sometimes found in good-sized crystals, but as prepared in the laboratory
is a white powder. When fused with potassium hydroxide it forms potassium stannate, acting
very much like silicon dioxide:

    SnO{2} + 2KOH = K{2}SnO{3} + H{2}O.

~Chlorides of tin.~ Stannous chloride is prepared by dissolving tin in concentrated hydrochloric
acid and evaporating the solution to crystallization. The crystals which are obtained have
the composition SnCl{2}·2H{2}O, and are known as tin crystals. By treating a solution of stannous
chloride with aqua regia, stannic chloride is formed:

    SnCl{2} + 2Cl = SnCl{4}.

The salt which crystallizes from such a solution has the composition SnCl{4}·5H{2}O, and is
known commercially as oxymuriate of tin. If metallic tin is heated in a current of dry chlorine,
the anhydrous chloride (SnCl{4}) is obtained as a heavy colorless liquid which fumes strongly
on exposure to air.

The ease with which stannous chloride takes up chlorine to form stannic chloride makes it a
good reducing agent in many reactions, changing the higher chlorides of metals to lower ones.
Thus mercuric chloride is changed into mercurous chloride:

    SnCl{2} + 2HgCl{2} = SnCl{4} + 2HgCl.

Ferric chloride is in like manner reduced to ferrous chloride:

    SnCl{3} + 2FeCl{3} = SnCl{4} + 2FeCl{2}.

The chlorides of tin, as well as the alkali stannates, are much used as mordants in dyeing
processes. The hydroxides of tin and free stannic acid, which are easily liberated from these
compounds, possess in very marked degree the power of fixing dyes upon fibers, as explained
under aluminium.

LEAD

~Occurrence.~ Lead is found in nature chiefly as the sulphide (PbS), called galena; to a much
smaller extent it occurs as carbonate, sulphate, chromate, and in a few other forms. Practically
all the lead of commerce is made from galena, two general methods of metallurgy being in use.

~Metallurgy.~ 1. The sulphide is melted with scrap iron, when iron sulphide and metallic lead
are formed; the liquid lead, being the heavier, sinks to the bottom of the vessel and can be
drawn off:

    PbS + Fe = Pb + FeS.

2. The sulphide is roasted in the air until a part of it has been changed into oxide and sulphate.
The air is then shut off and the heating continued, the reactions indicated in the following
equations taking place:

    2PbO + PbS = 3Pb + SO{2},

    PbSO{4} + PbS = 2Pb + 2SO{2}.

The lead so prepared usually contains small amounts of silver, arsenic, antimony, copper, and
other metals. The silver is removed by Parkes's method, as described under silver, and the
other metals in various ways. The lead of commerce is one of the purest commercial metals,
containing as a rule only a few tenths per cent of impurities.

~Properties.~ Lead is a heavy metal (den. = 11.33) which has a brilliant silvery luster on
a freshly cut surface, but which soon tarnishes to a dull blue-gray color. It is soft, easily
fused (melting at 327°), and quite malleable, but has little toughness or strength.

It is not acted upon to any great extent by the oxygen of the air under ordinary conditions,
but is changed into oxide at a high temperature. With the exception of hydrochloric and sulphuric
acids, most acids, even very weak ones, act upon it, forming soluble lead salts. Hot, concentrated
hydrochloric and sulphuric acids also attack it to a slight extent.

~Uses.~ Lead is employed in the manufacture of lead pipes and in large storage batteries. In
the form of sheet lead it is used in lining the chambers of sulphuric acid works and in the
preparation of paint pigments. Some alloys of lead, such as solder and pewter (lead and tin),
shot (lead and arsenic), and soft bearing metals, are widely used. Type metal consists of lead,
antimony, and sometimes tin. Compounds of lead form several important pigments.

~Compounds of lead.~ In nearly all its compounds lead has a valence of 2, but a few corresponding
to stannic compounds have a valence of 4.

~Lead oxides.~ Lead forms a number of oxides, the most important of which are litharge, red
lead or minium, and lead peroxide.

1. Litharge (PbO). This oxide forms when lead is oxidized at a rather low temperature, and
is obtained as a by-product in silver refining. It is a pale yellow powder, and has a number
of commercial uses. It is easily soluble in nitric acid:

    PbO + 2HNO{3} = Pb(NO{3}){2} + H{2}O.

2. Red lead, or minium (Pb{3}O{4}). Minium is prepared by heating lead (or litharge) to a high
temperature in the air. It is a heavy powder of a beautiful red color, and is much used as
a pigment.

3. Lead peroxide (PbO{2}). This is left as a residue when minium is heated with nitric acid:

Pb{3}O{4} + 4HNO{3} = 2Pb(NO{3}){2} + PbO{2} + 2H{2}O.

It is a brown powder which easily gives up a part of its oxygen and, like manganese dioxide
and barium dioxide, is a good oxidizing agent.

~Soluble salts of lead.~ The soluble salts of lead can be made by dissolving (Pb(C{2}H{3}O{2}){2}·3H{2}O),
litharge in acids. Lead acetate called sugar of lead, and lead nitrate (Pb(NO{3}){2}) are the
most familiar examples. They are while crystalline solids and are poisonous in character.

~Insoluble salts of lead; lead carbonate.~ While the normal carbonate of lead (PbCO{3}) is
found to some extent, in nature and can be prepared in the laboratory, basic carbonates of
varying composition are much more easy to obtain. One of the simplest of these has the composition
2PbCO{3}·Pb(OH){2}. A mixture of such carbonates is called white lead. This is prepared on
a large scale as a paint pigment and as a body for paints which are to be colored with other
substances.

     ~White lead.~ White lead is an amorphous white substance which,
     when mixed with oil, has great covering power, that is, it
     spreads out in an even waxy film, free from streaks and lumps,
     and covers the entire surface upon which it is spread. Its
     disadvantage as a pigment lies in the fact that it gradually
     blackens when exposed to sulphur compounds, which are often
     present in the air, forming black lead sulphide (PbS).

     ~Technical preparation of white lead.~ Different methods are used
     in the preparation of white lead, but the old one known as the
     Dutch process is still the principal one employed. In this
     process, earthenware pots about ten inches high and of the
     shape shown in Fig. 89 are used. In the bottom A is placed a
     3% solution of acetic acid (vinegar answers the purpose very
     well). The space above this is filled with thin, perforated,
     circular pieces of lead, supported by the flange B of the
     pot. These pots are placed close together on a bed of tan bark
     on the floor of a room known as the corroding room. They are
     covered over with boards, upon which tan bark is placed, and
     another row of pots is placed on this. In this way the room is
     filled. The white lead is formed by the fumes of the acetic
     acid, together with the carbon dioxide set free in the
     fermentation of the tan bark acting on the lead. About three
     months are required to complete the process.

~Lead sulphide~ (PbS). In nature this compound occurs in highly crystalline condition, the
crystals having much the same luster as pure lead. It is readily prepared in the laboratory
as a black precipitate, by the action of hydrosulphuric acid upon soluble lead salts:

    Pb(NO{3}){2} + H{2}S = PbS + 2HNO{3}.

It is insoluble both in water and in dilute acids.

~Other insoluble salts.~ Lead chromate (PbCrO{4}) is a yellow substance produced by the action
of a soluble lead salt upon a soluble chromate, thus:

    K{2}CrO{4} + Pb(NO{3}){2} = PbCrO{4} + 2 KNO{3}.

It is used as a yellow pigment. Lead sulphate (PbSO{4}) is a white substance sometimes found
in nature and easily prepared by precipitation. Lead chloride (PbCl{2}) is likewise a white
substance nearly insoluble in cold water, but readily soluble in boiling water.

     ~Thorium and cerium.~ These elements are found in a few rare
     minerals, especially in the monazite sand of the Carolinas and
     Brazil. The oxides of these elements are used in the
     preparation of the Welsbach mantles for gas lights, because of
     the intense light given out when a mixture of the oxides is
     heated. These mantles contain the oxides of cerium and thorium
     in the ratio of about 1% of the former to 99% of the latter.
     Compounds of thorium, like those of radium, are found to
     possess radio-activity, but in a less degree.

====================================================================

~General.~ Manganese and chromium, while belonging to different families, have so many features
in common in their chemical conduct that they may be studied together with advantage. They
differ from most of the elements so far studied in that they can act either as acid-forming
or base-forming elements. As base-forming elements each of the metals forms two series of salts.
In the one series, designated by the suffix "ous," the metal is divalent; in the other series,
designated by the suffix "ic," the metal is trivalent. Only the manganous and the chromic salts,
however, are of importance. The acids in which these elements play the part of a non-metal
are unstable, but their salts are usually stable, and some of them are important compounds.

MANGANESE

~Occurrence.~ Manganese is found in nature chiefly as the dioxide MnO{2}, called pyrolusite.
In smaller amounts it occurs as the oxides Mn{2}O{3} and Mn{3}O{4}, and as the carbonate MnCO{3}.
Some iron ores also contain manganese.

~Preparation and properties.~ The element is difficult to prepare in pure condition and has
no commercial applications. It can be prepared, however, by reducing the oxide with aluminium
powder or by the use of the electric furnace, with carbon as the reducing agent. The metal
somewhat resembles iron in appearance, but is harder, less fusible, and more readily acted
upon by air and moisture. Acids readily dissolve it, forming manganous salts.

~Oxides of manganese.~ The following oxides of manganese are known: MnO, Mn{2}O{3}, Mn{3}O{4},
MnO{2}, and Mn{2}O{7}. Only one of these, the dioxide, needs special mention.

~Manganese dioxide~ (pyrolusite) (MnO{2}). This substance is the most abundant manganese compound
found in nature, and is the ore from which all other compounds of manganese are made. It is
a hard, brittle, black substance which is valuable as an oxidizing agent. It will be recalled
that it is used in the preparation of chlorine and oxygen, in decolorizing glass which contains
iron, and in the manufacture of ferromanganese.

~Compounds containing manganese as a base-forming element.~ As has been stated previously,
manganese forms two series of salts. The most important of these salts, all of which belong
to the manganous series, are the following:

    Manganous chloride           MnCl{2}·4H{2}O.
    Manganous sulphide           MnS.
    Manganous sulphate           MnSO{4}·4H{2}O.
    Manganous carbonate          MnCO{3}.
    Manganous hydroxide          Mn(OH){2}. Most of the manganous salts are rose colored. They
not only have formulas similar to the ferrous salts, but resemble them
in many of their chemical properties.

~Compounds containing manganese as an acid-forming element.~ Manganese forms two unstable acids,
namely, manganic acid and permanganic acid. While these acids are of little interest, some
of their salts, especially the permanganates, are important compounds.

~Manganic acid and manganates.~ When manganese dioxide is fused with an alkali and an oxidizing
agent a green compound is formed. The equation, when caustic potash is used, is as follows:

    MnO{2} + 2KOH + O = K{2}MnO{4} + H{2}O.

The green compound (K{2}MnO{4}) is called potassium manganate, and is a salt of the unstable
manganic acid (H{2}MnO{4}). The manganates are all very unstable.

~Permanganic acid and the permanganates.~ When carbon dioxide is passed through a solution
of a manganate a part of the manganese is changed into manganese dioxide, while the remainder
forms a salt of the unstable acid HMnO{4}, called permanganic acid. The equation is

    3K{2}MnO{4} + 2CO{2} = MnO{2} + 2KMnO{4} + 2K{2}CO{3}.

Potassium permanganate (KMnO{4}) crystallizes in purple-black needles and is very soluble in
water, forming an intensely purple solution. All other permanganates, as well as permanganic
acid itself, give solutions of the same color.

~Oxidizing properties of the permanganates.~ The permanganates are remarkable for their strong
oxidizing properties. When used as an oxidizing agent the permanganate is itself reduced, the
exact character of the products formed from it depending upon whether the oxidation takes place
(1) in an alkaline or neutral solution, or (2) in an acid solution.

1. Oxidation in alkaline or neutral solution. When the solution is either alkaline or neutral
the potassium and the manganese of the permanganate are both converted into hydroxides, as
shown in the equation

    2KMnO{4} + 5H{2}O = 2Mn(OH){4} + 2KOH + 3O.

2. Oxidation in acid solution.

Under ordinary conditions, however, neither one of these reactions takes place except in the
presence of a third substance which is capable of oxidation. The oxygen is not given off in
the free state, as the equations show, but is used up in effecting oxidation.

Potassium permanganate is particularly valuable as an oxidizing agent not only because it acts
readily either in acid or in alkaline solution, but also because the reaction takes place so
easily that often it is not even necessary to heat the solution to secure action. The substance
finds many uses in the laboratory, especially in analytical work. It is also used as an antiseptic
as well as a disinfectant.

CHROMIUM

~Occurrence.~ The ore from which all chromium compounds are made is chromite, or chrome iron
ore (FeCr{2}O{4}). This is found most abundantly in New Caledonia and Turkey. The element also
occurs in small quantities in many other minerals, especially in crocoisite (PbCrO{4}), in
which mineral it was first discovered.

~Preparation.~ Chromium, like manganese, is very hard to reduce from its ores, owing to its
great affinity for oxygen. It can, however, be made by the same methods which have proved successful
with manganese. Considerable quantities of an alloy of chromium with iron, called ferrochromium,
are now produced for the steel industry.

~Properties.~ Chromium is a very hard metal of about the same density as iron. It is one of
the most infusible of the metals, requiring a temperature little short of 3000° for fusion.
At ordinary temperatures air has little action on it; at higher temperatures, however, it burns
brilliantly. Nitric acid has no action on it, but hydrochloric and dilute sulphuric acids dissolve
it, liberating hydrogen.

~Compounds containing chromium as a base-forming element.~ While chromium forms two series
of salts, chromous salts are difficult to prepare and are of little importance. The most important
of the chromic series are the following:

    Chromic hydroxide       Cr(OH){3}.
    Chromic chloride        CrCl{3}·6H{2}O.
    Chromic sulphate        Cr{2}(SO{4}){3}.
    Chrome alums

~Chromic hydroxide~ (Cr(OH){3}). This substance, being insoluble, can be obtained by precipitating
a solution of the chloride or sulphate with a soluble hydroxide. It is a greenish substance
which, like aluminium hydroxide, dissolves in alkalis, forming soluble salts.

     ~Dehydration of chromium hydroxide.~ When heated gently chromic
     hydroxide loses a part of its oxygen and hydrogen, forming the
     substance CrO·OH, which, like the corresponding aluminium
     compound, has more pronounced acid properties than the
     hydroxide. It forms a series of salts very similar to the
     spinels; chromite is the ferrous salt of this acid, having the
     formula Fe(CrO{2}){2}. When heated to a higher temperature
     chromic hydroxide is completely dehydrated, forming the
     trioxide Cr{2}O{3}. This resembles the corresponding oxides
     of aluminium and iron in many respects. It is a bright green
     powder, and when ignited strongly becomes almost insoluble in
     acids, as is also the case with aluminium oxide.

~Chromic sulphate~ (Cr{2}(SO{4}){3}). This compound is a violet-colored solid which dissolves
in water, forming a solution of the same color. This solution, however, turns green on heating,
owing to the formation of basic salts.

These form beautiful dark purple crystals and have some practical uses in the tanning industry
and in photography. A number of the salts of chromium are also used in the dyeing industry,
for they hydrolyze like aluminium salts and the hydroxide forms a good mordant.

     ~Hydrolysis of chromium salts.~ When ammonium sulphide is added
     to a solution of a chromium salt, such as the sulphate,
     chromium hydroxide precipitates instead of the sulphide. This
     is due to the fact that chromic sulphide, like aluminium
     sulphide, hydrolyzes in the presence of water, forming chromic
     hydroxide and hydrosulphuric acid. Similarly, a soluble
     carbonate precipitates a basic carbonate of chromium.

~Compounds containing chromium as an acid-forming element.~ Like manganese, chromium forms
two unstable acids, namely, chromic acid and dichromic acid. Their salts, the chromates and
dichromates, are important compounds.
