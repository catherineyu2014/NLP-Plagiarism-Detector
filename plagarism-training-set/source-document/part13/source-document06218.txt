    "What d'ye want? Why come you here?"
      Said the Beetle inside the bark
    Unto the crafty Woodpecker
      Who rapped on the pine-tree in the park.

    "Never mind what, and never mind why,"
      Replied the Woodpecker, hammering still,
    "The question will be, 'How's this for high?'
      When I send in my little bill."

Hand and Glove.

The scarcity of kid gloves, caused by this war, will, no doubt, force many a fair one to bare
a hand during its continuance. Yet the conservative bigots say that women should not vote unless
they are willing to do their part in the fighting.

Q.E.D.

Astronomers say that there is no water on the moon's surface. We, on the contrary, know that
there are large oceans there. No one ever heard of ship captains in a place destitute of water;
and, as the moon is made of green cheese, there must of course be "skippers" there.

A Christmas Joke.

Theatrical.

The "Gods" at our theatres generally evince good taste in selecting their favorite actresses,
and as they usually choose blondes, we cannot believe that "those whom the gods love dye young."

PROTECTION PROTECTED.

A Western editor has issued a conundrum in a volume with the title Does Protection Protect?
and undertakes to prove by statistics that answer is No. These Western people are in the habit,
we know, of bragging a good deal of their exploits, and so the writer referred to says he used
to think the answer to his conundrum was Yes, but investigation has shown him he was wrong.
What business has he to investigate it? There is Mr. GREELEY, he says the answer is YES!! and
does any one suppose that he ever investigated it, or could so investigate any subject as to
change his opinion about it? Of course not.

Then there is H.C. CAREY, who used to say, when he was interested in statistics, that the answer
was No; but now that he is more interested in mining, he says the answer is Yes. Could there
be any better proof that the Western man is wrong?

Besides, has not Mr. KELLEY proved a thousand times that protection does protect his constituents,
and that by making everybody pay dearer for iron, the money goes where, according to the true
laws of trade, it ought to go--into the pockets of the mine-owners? Can it be possible that
the castor-oil man, the thread man, the salt man, the steel man, and all the others of this
kind, don't know that protection protects them, and that they are the important persons in
the country?

If this freedom of inquiry is allowed much longer, protection itself will have to be protected.
Let that Western editor prosecute his studies further, until he becomes convinced that Americans
are naturally a lazy, idle, and shiftless people, and never would, or could, engage in any
industry unless they were so protected in it that it can be made as flourishing as ship-building,
machine-shops, and manufactures of all kinds are now. Or, if he thinks that would take too
much time, let him join some snug little ring, if he can find such a vacancy, and enjoy the
reflection, when Republican orators talk of the glorious results of protection to American
industry, that he is one of the glorious results.
