4. The Second Empire.--In December, 1852, the president took the title of Emperor, calling
himself Napoleon III., as successor to the young son of the great Napoleon. He kept up a splendid
and expensive court, made Paris more than ever the toy-shop of the world, and did much to improve
it by the widening of streets and removal of old buildings. Treaties were made which much improved
trade, and the country advanced in prosperity. The reins of government were, however, tightly
held, and nothing was so much avoided as the letting men think or act for themselves, while
their eyes were to be dazzled with splendour and victory. In 1853, when Russia was attacking
Turkey, the Emperor united with England in opposition, and the two armies together besieged
Sebastopol, and fought the battles of Alma and Inkermann, taking the city after nearly a year's
siege; and then making what is known as the Treaty of Paris, which guaranteed the safety of
Turkey so long as the subject Christian nations were not misused. In 1859 Napoleon III. joined
in an attack on the Austrian power in Italy, and together with Victor Emanuel, King of Sardinia,
and the Italians, gained two great victories at Magenta and Solferino; but made peace as soon
as it was convenient to him, without regard to his promises to the King of Sardinia, who was
obliged to purchase his consent to becoming King of United Italy by yielding up to France his
old inheritance of Savoy and Nice. Meantime discontent began to spring up at home, and the
Red Republican spirit was working on. The huge fortunes made by the successful only added to
the sense of contrast; secret societies were at work, and the Emperor, after twenty years of
success, felt his popularity waning.

5. The Franco-German War.--In 1870 the Spaniards, who had deposed their queen, Isabel II.,
made choice of a relation of the King of Prussia as their king. There had long been bitter
jealousy between France and Prussia, and, though the prince refused the offer of Spain, the
French showed such an overbearing spirit that a war broke out. The real desire of France was
to obtain the much-coveted frontier of the Rhine, and the Emperor heated their armies with
boastful proclamations which were but the prelude to direful defeats, at Weissenburg, Wörth,
and Forbach. At Sedan, the Emperor was forced to surrender himself as a prisoner, and the tidings
no sooner arrived at Paris than the whole of the people turned their wrath on him and his family.
His wife, the Empress Eugènie, had to flee, a republic was declared, and the city prepared
to stand a siege. The Germans advanced, and put down all resistance in other parts of France.
Great part of the army had been made prisoners, and, though there was much bravado, there was
little steadiness or courage left among those who now took up arms. Paris, which was blockaded,
after suffering much from famine, surrendered in February, 1871; and peace was purchased in
a treaty by which great part of Elsass and Lorraine, and the city of Metz, were given back
to Germany.

AN HISTORICAL READER

FOR THE USE OF

Classes in Academies, High Schools, and Grammar Schools.

By HENRY E. SHEPHERD, M.A., Superintendent of Public Instruction, Baltimore, Maryland.

This work consists of a collection of extracts representing the purest historical literature
that has been produced in the different stages of our literary development, from the time of
Clarendon to the era of Macaulay and Prescott, its design being to present to the minds of
young pupils typical illustrations of classic historical style, gathered mainly from English
and American writers, and to create and develop a fondness for historical study.

The book is totally devoid of sectarian or partisan tendencies, the aim being simply to instill
a love for historical reading, and not to suggest opinions or inculcate views in regard to
any of those great civil and religious revolutions whose effects and whose influence must remain
open questions till the last act in the historical drama shall be completed.

The biographical and critical notes are just sufficient to stimulate inquiry and independent
research. The intention of notes and comments is to suggest new lines of thought, and to develop
a taste for more extended investigation.

Price, post-paid, $1.25.

APPLETONS' GEOGRAPHIES

Another Signal Improvement.

The remarkable success which Appletons' Readers have attained, both commercially and educationally,
is due to the fact that no effort or expense was spared to make them not only mechanically
superior, but practically and distinctively superior, in their embodiment of modern experiences
in teaching, and of the methods followed by the most successful and intelligent educators of
the day.

We now offer a new series of Geographies, in two books, which will as far excel all geographical
text-books hitherto published as our Readers are in advance of the old text-books in Reading.

THE SERIES.
