Before explaining what I conceive to have been the true causes which led the captain-general
to act so contrary to my passport, as to imprison me and seize my vessel, charts, and papers;
it will be proper to give the reader a knowledge of some points in His Excellency's character,
in addition to those he will have extracted from the abridged narrative. At the time of my
arrival, he entertained, and does I believe still entertain, an indiscriminate animosity against
Englishmen, whether this arose from his having been deprived of the advantage of fixing the
seat of his government at Pondicherry, by the renewal of war in 1803, or from any antecedent
circumstance, I cannot pretend to say; but that he did harbour such animosity, and that in
an uncommon degree, is averred by his keeping in irons, contrary to the usages of war, the
first English seamen that were brought to the island (Narrative page 58 and 70); by the surprise
he testified at the proceeding of a French gentleman, who interceded with him for the liberty
on parole of a sick English officer; on which occasion he said amongst other things, that had
he his own will, he would send all the English prisoners to the Marquis Wellesley without their
ears: this animosity is, besides, as well known at the Isle of France, as the existence of
the island.

It is probably owing to an original want of education, and to having passed the greater part
of his life in the tumult of camps during the French revolution, that arises his indifference
for the arts and sciences, other than those which have an immediate relation to war. His Excellency's
ideas seem even to be so strictly military, that the profession of a seaman has very little
share in his  estimation; and his ignorance of nautical affairs has been shewn by various circumstances
to be greater than would be supposed in a moderately well informed man, who had made a voyage
from Europe to India.

36. EXTRACT FROM FLINDERS' LETTER-BOOK, REFERRING TO OXLEY'S APPOINTMENT AS SURVEYOR-GENERAL.

(Melbourne Public Library.)

To Captain Thos. Hurd, Hydrographer, Admiralty Office.

London April 2, 1812.

My dear Sir

Understanding that Lieut. John Oxley of the Navy is going out surveyor-general of Lands in
New South Wales, I wish to point out to you, that if he should be enabled, in intervals of
his land duty, to accomplish the following nautical objects, in the vicinity of Port Jackson,
and of the settlements in Van Diemen's Land, our knowledge of those coasts would be thereby
improved, and some material advantages to the colonies probably obtained.

1st. Jervis Bay, a large piece of water whose entrance is in 35.5 south, and not from than
75 miles from Port Jackson, has never yet, to my knowledge been surveyed. There have been two
or three eye sketches made of it; but it would be desirable to have it surveyed, with the streams
which are said to fall into its North and western sides; and also the corresponding line of
the sea coast, in which there are thought to be strata of coal.

The great semicircular range of mountains which has hitherto resisted all attempts to penetrate
into the interior country behind Port Jackson, appears to terminate at Point Bass in latitude
about 34.43; and the land behind Jervis Bay is represented to be low and flat. It is, therefore,
probable, that a well conducted effort to obtain some knowledge of the interior of that vast
country, would be attended with success if made by steering a West or N.N.W. course from the
head of Jervis Bay.

37. FLINDERS' MEMORIAL IN PARISH CHURCH, AT HIS BIRTHPLACE, DONINGTON, LINCOLNSHIRE.

IN MEMORY OF CAPTAIN MATTHEW FLINDERS, R.N. WHO DIED JULY 19TH 1814, AGED 40 YEARS.

AFTER HAVING TWICE CIRCUMNAVIGATED THE GLOBE, HE WAS SENT BY THE ADMIRALTY IN THE YEAR 1801,
TO MAKE DISCOVERIES ON THE COAST OF TERRA AUSTRALIS. RETURNING FROM THIS VOYAGE HE SUFFERED
SHIPWRECK, AND BY THE INJUSTICE OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WAS IMPRISONED SIX YEARS IN THE ISLAND
OF MAURITIUS.

IN 1810, HE WAS RESTORED TO HIS NATIVE LAND, AND NOT LONG AFTER WAS ATTACKED BY AN EXCRUCIATING
DISEASE, THE ANGUISH OF WHICH HE BORE UNTIL DEATH WITH UNDEVIATING FORTITUDE.

HIS COUNTRY WILL LONG REGRET THE LOSS OF ONE WHOSE EXERTIONS IN HER CAUSE WERE ONLY EQUALLED
BY HIS PERSEVERANCE: BUT HIS FAMILY WILL MOST DEEPLY FEEL THE IRREPARABLE DEPRIVATION.

THEY DO NOT MERELY LAMENT A MAN OF SUPERIOR INTELLECT. THEY MOURN AN AFFECTIONATE HUSBAND,
A TENDER FATHER, A KIND BROTHER, AND A FAITHFUL FRIEND.

38. MEMORIAL TO BASS AND FLINDERS AT THE COMMONWEALTH NAVAL BASE, WESTERNPORT, VICTORIA.)

The maps have been copied from Flinders' Atlas, with the omission of a few details, which,
on the small scale necessarily adopted, would have caused confusion; it has been thought better
to make what is given quite legible to the unassisted eye. All names on the maps are as Flinders
spelt them, but in the body of the book modern spellings have been adopted. In the case of
the Duyfhen the usual spelling, which is also that of Flinders, is retained; but the late J.
Backhouse Walker has shown reason to believe that the real name of the vessel was Duyfken.
