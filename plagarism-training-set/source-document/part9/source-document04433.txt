[Sidenote: Fermentacione is fermentacione, and not dawbing even metaphorically.] Fermentac{i}o{n}e
yo{u} expounde Dawbinge, whiche cannott anye way be metaphoricallye so vsed in Chaucer, althoughe
yt sholde be improperlye or harsely applied. For fermentac{i}one ys a peculier terme of Alchymye,
deduced from the bakers fermente or levyne. And therefore the Chimicall philosophers defyne
the fermente to bee anima, the sowle or lyfe, of the philosophers stoone. Whereunto agreethe
Clauiger Bincing, one chimicall author, sayinge, ante viuificatio{ne}m id est fermentac{i}o{ne}m,
w{hi}che is before tinctinge, or gyvinge tincture or cooler; that beinge as muche to saye as
gyvinge sowle or lyfe to the philosophers stoone, wherby that may fermente or cooler or gyue
lyfe to all other metaline bodyes. The lieger booke of Elye, speakinge of Ediswetha daughter
to Brightnothus, aldermanne, erle or duke, of northumberlande before the Conquest sayethe;
cui tradita Coveneia, locus monasterio vicinus, vbi aurifrixorie et texturæ secretiùs cu{m}
puellis vacabat; and a little after, Tunica Rubra purpura per gyrum et ab humeris aurifri vndiq{ue}
circumdatu{m}. Then, after the conquest, mathew Paris speakethe thereof aboute ornamentes to
be sente to the Poope. but because I haue not my mathewe Paris here, I will vouche one whose
name hathe muche affinytye with hym, and that is Mathewe Parker Archbyshoppe of Canterburye,
who, in the Lyfe of Bonifacius Archbishoppe of that see, hathe these wordes. “A^o. Domini 1246,
Romæ multi Anglicani aderant Clerici, qui capis vt aiu{n}t chorealibus, et infulis, ornamentisq{ue}
ecclesiasticis, ex Anglice tunc more gentis, ex lana tenuissima et auro artificiosè intexto
fabricatis, vterentur. Huius modi ornamentoru{m} aspectu et concupiscentia provocatus Papa,
rogavit cuiusmodi essent. Responsu{m} est, aurifrisia appellari, quia et eminens ex panno et
lana qua{m} Angli fryse appellant, simul contexta sunt. Cui subridens et dulcedine captus Papa,
Vere, inquit,” (for these are the woordes of Mathewe Paris whiche lyved at that tyme,) “Hortus
noster delitiaru{m} est Anglia, verus puteus est inexhaustus, et vbi multa abundant, de multis
multa sumere licet. Itaq{ue}, concupiscentia illectus oculorum, litteras suas Bullatas sacras
misit ad Cistercienses in Anglia Abbates, quoru{m} orationibus se devotè commendabat, vt ipsi
hec aurifrisia speciosissima ad suum ornandu{m} choru{m} compararent. Hoc Londoniensibus placuit,
quia ea tum venalia habebant, tantiq{ue} quanti placuit vendiderunt.” In whiche discourse you
not onlye see that orefryes was a weued clothe of golde and not goldsmythe worke, and that
Englande had before and since the conqueste the arte to compose suche kynde of delicate Cloothe
of golde as Europe had not the lyke; for yf yt hadd, the poope wolde haue made suche prouis{i}one
thereof in other places, and not from Englande. And because you shall not thinke that yt was
onlye vsed of the Clergye, you shall fynde in a record of the Towre that yt was also one ornamente
of the kings garmente, since the Conqueste, for, in Rotulo Patentiu{m} 6. Joh{ann}is in Dorso
(in whiche the kinge comaunded the templers to deliuer suche jewells, garmentes, and ornamentes
as they had of the kings in kepinge,) are these wordes: “Dalmaticam de eodem samitto vrlatani
de orfreyes et cu{m} lapidibus.” Whiche is to saye, the kings Dalmaticall garmente of the same
samitte (spoken of before, whiche was crymsone,) vrled or bordrede (suche as we nowe calle
garded) withe orfreyes.

[Sidenote: Oundye and Crispe meaneth wavy like water.] fforthlye Oundye and Crispe is by you
expounded slyked and curled, whiche sence althoughe yt may beare after some sorte; yet the
proprytye of the true sence of oundye (beinge an especiall terme appropriate to the arte of
Heraldye) dothe signifye wavinge or movinge, as the water dothe; being called vndye, of Latyne
vnda for water, for so her haire was oundye, that is, layed in rooles vppone and downe, lyke
waves of water when they are styrred with the winde, and not slyked or playne, etc.

[Sidenote: Resager is ratsbane or arsenic.] ffyftlye You expounde not Resager, beinge a terme
of Alchymye; as yo{u} leave manye of them vntouched. This worde sholde rather be resalgar,
wherefore I will shewe yo{u} what resalgar ys in that abstruse science, whiche Chawcer knewe
full well, althoughe he enveye againste the sophisticall abuse thereof in the chanons Yeomans
Tale. This Resalgar is that w{hi}che by some is called Ratesbane, a kynde of poysone named
Arsenicke, which the chimicall philosophers call their venome or poysone. Whereof I coulde
produce infynyte examples; but I will gyve yo{u} onlye these fewe for a taste. Aristotle, in
Rosario Philosophoru{m}, sayethe, “nullu{m} tingens venenum generatur absq{ue} sole et eius
vmbra, id est, uxore.” whiche venome they call by all names presentinge or signifyinge poysone,
as a toode, a dragon, a Basilyske, a serpente, arsenicke, and suche lyke; and by manye other
names, as “in exercitacio{n}e ad turbam philosophorum,” apperethe, wher aqua simplex is called
venenu{m}, Argentum vivum, Cinnabar, aqua permanens, gumma, acetu{m}, urina, aqua maris, Draco,
serpens, etc. And of this poysone the treatyce de phenice,[7] or the philosophers stoone, written
in Gothyshe rymynge verse, dothe saye;

  Moribunda, corporis virus emanabat
  quod materna{m} faciem ca{n}dida{m} fœdabat.

    [Footnote 7: A copy of this curious poem in Thynne’s
    hand-writing, and marvellously illustrated by him, is in the
    Brit. Mus., MSS. Add. No. 11,388.]

[Sidenote: Begyns are nuns, though it cometh to mean superstitious and hypocritical women from
their nature.] Begyn and Bigott yo{u} expounde sup{er}sticious hypocrites, whiche sence I knowe
yt maye somewhat beare, because yt sauorethe of the disposit{i}one of those begins, or Beguines,
for that ys the true wrytinge. But this woorde Begyn sholde in his owne nature rightlye haue
ben expounded, sup{er}sticious or hipocriticall wemenne, as appereth by chaucer himselfe, w{hi}che
nombrethe them emongest the wemen in the Romante of the Roose when he sayethe,

  But empresses, & duchesses,
  These queenes, & eke countesses
  These abbasses, & eke Bigins,
  These greate ladyes palasins.

And a little after, in the same Romante, he doth write,

  That dame abstinence streyned
  Tooke one a Robe of camelyne,
  And ganne her gratche as a Bygin.
  A large cover-cherfe of Thredde
  She wrapped all aboute her hedde.

These wemene the Frenche call Beguynes or nonnes; being in Latyne called Bigrinæ or Biguinæ.
Whose originall order, encrease, and contynuance are sett downe by mathewe Paris and Mathewe
Westm{inster}. But as I sayed, since I haue not my mathewe Paris at hand, I will sett you downe
the wordes of mathewe Westmynster (otherwise called “Flores Historiarum” or “Florilegus”) in
this sorte. Sub eisdem diebus (w{hi}ch was in the yere of Christe 1244, and aboute the 28 of
kinge Henry the thirde,) quidam in Almania precipuè se asserentes vitam et habitu{m} relligionis
elegisse, in utroq{ue} sexu, sed maximè in muliebri, continentia{m}, cu{i}u{s} vitæ simplicitate
profitentes, se voto priuato deo obligaru{n}t. Mulieresq{ue}, quas Bigrinas vulgaritèr vocamus,
adeò multiplicatæ sunt, quòd earu{m} numerus in vna ciuitate, scilicèt Colonia, ad plus quam
mille asseritur ascendisse, etc. After whiche, speakinge yn the yere of Christe 1250 of the
encrease of relligious orders, he sayeth, Item in Alemania et Francia mulieres, quas Biguinas
nominant, etc.

[Sidenote: Citrinatione or perfect digestion.] Citrinatione yo{u} do not expounde, beinge a
terme of Alchymye. Whiche Citrinatione is bothe a color and parte of the philosophers stoone.
for, as hathe Tractatus Avicennæ (yf yt be his and not liber suppositi[ti]us, as manye of the
Alchimicall woorkes are foysted in vnder the names of the best lerned authors and philosophers,
as Plato, Aristotle, Avicen, and suche others,) in parte of the 7 chapter. Citrinatio est que
fit inter albu{m} et rubru{m}, et non dicitur coolor perfectus, whiche Citrinat{i}one, as sayethe
Arnoldus de Nova Villa, li. i. ca. 5. nihil aliud est quàm completa digestio. For the worke
of the philosophers stoone, following the worke of nature, hathe lyke color in the same degree.
for as the vrine of manne, being whityshe, sheweth imp{er}fecte digestione: But when he hathe
well rested, and slepte after the same, and the digestione p{er}fected: the vrine becomethe
citrine, or of a depe yellowe cooler: so ys yt in Alchymye. whiche made Arnolde call this citrinatione
perfect digestion, or the cooler provinge the philosophers stoone broughte almoste to the heigh[t]e
of perfect{i}one.

[Sidenote: Forage is old and hard provision made for horses and cattle in winter,] Forage in
one place you expounde meate, and in other place fodder. boothe whiche properly cannott stande
in this place of chaucer in the reves prologue, where he sayeth, “my fodder is forage.” for
yf forrage be fodder, then is the sence of that verse, “my fodder is fodder.” But fodder beinge
a generall name for meate gyven to Cattle in winter, and of affynytie withe foode applied to
menne and beasts, dothe onlye signyfye meate. And so the sence is, “my meate ys forage,” that
is, my meate is suche harde and olde provis{i}one as ys made for horses and Cattle in winter.
for so doth this worde forragiu{m} in latyne signyfye. and so dothe Chaucer meane. for the
word next before dothe well shewe yt, when the Reve sayeth,

  I ame olde, me liste not play for age,
  Grasse tyme is donne, my fodder is forrage.

[Sidenote: or metaphorically, or to help out the ryme it may mean grass.] Yet metaphorically
yt may be taken for other than drye horse meate, although improperlye; as Chaucer hathe, in
Sir Topas Ryme, where he makethe yt grasse for his horse, and vseth the woorde rather to make
vpp the ryme than to shewe the true nature thereof; sayinge,

  That downe he layed hym in that place,
  to make his steede some solace
  and gyve hym good forage.

[Sidenote: Heroner is a long-winged hawk for the heron.] Heroner yo{u} expounde a certeyne
kynde of hawke, whiche is true, for a gowshawke, sparrowe hawke, tassell, &c. be kyndes of
hawkes. But this heroner, is an especiall hawke (of anye of the kyndes of longe winged hawkes)
of moore accompte then other hawkes are, because the flighte of the Herone ys moore daungerous
than of other fowles, insomuch, that when she fyndeth her selfe in danger, she will lye in
the ayre vppon her backe, and turne vpp her bellye towardes the hawke; and so defile her enymye
with her excrementes, that eyther she will blinde the hawke, or ells with her byll or talons
pierce the hawkes brest yf she offer to cease vppon her.

[Sidenote: The Hyppe is the berye of the sweet bryer or eglantine.] The Hyppe is not simplye
the redde berrye one the Bryer, vnlest yo{u} adde this epithetone and saye, the redde Berrye
one the swete Bryer, (which is the Eglantyne,) to distinguyshe yt from the comone Bryer or
Bramble beringe the blacke Berye, for that name Bryer ys comone to them boothe; when the Hyppe
is proper but to one, neither maye yt helpe yo{u} that yo{u} saye the redd Berye, to distinguyshe
yt from the Blacke, for the blacke berye ys also redde for a tyme, and then may be called the
redde Berye of the Bryer for that tyme.

[Sidenote: Nowell meaneth more than Christmas.] Nowell yo{u} expounde Christmasse, whiche ys
that feaste and moore, for yt is that tyme, whiche is properlye called the Advente together
with Christmasse and Newe yeres tyde, wherefore the true etymologye of that worde ys not Christmasse,
or the twelve dayes, but yt is godd with us, or, oure Godde, expressinge to vs the comynge
of Christe in the fleshe, whiche p{er}adventure after a sorte, by the figure synecdoche, yo{u}
may seeme to excuse, placinge ther xþemas (Christmasse) a p{ar}te of this tyme of Nowell for
all the tyme that Nowell conteynethe. for in the same worde is conteyned sometyme xx, but for
the most p{ar}te thirtye dayes before Christmesse, aswell as the Christmesse yt selfe, that
woorde being deduced as hathe Will{iel}m{u}s Postellus in Alphabet. 12 Linguarum, from the
hebrue worde Noell: for thus he writethe: ‏‏ נאלnoel, sonat deus noster sive Deus nobis advenit,
solitaq{ue} est hec vox cantari a plebe ante xþi ({Christi}) natalitia viginti aut triginta
dies quodam desiderio.

[Sidenote: Porpherye is a peculiar marble, not marble in common.] Porpherye you expounde marble,
w{hi}che m{ar}ble ys genus, but porpherye is species, for as there is white and grey marble,
so ys there redde marbell, whiche is this porpherye, a stone of reddish purple coolor, distincte
or enterlaced with white veynes as yo{u} may see in the great pillars entringe into the royall
exchange or burse in Cornhill.

[Sidenote: Sendale, a sylke stuffe.] Sendale you expounde a thynne stuffe lyke cypres. but
yt was a thynne stuffe lyke sarcenette, and of a rawe kynde of sylke or sarcenett, but courser
and narrower, than the sarcenett nowe ys, as my selfe canne remember.

[Sidenote: The trepegett is not the battering-ram, but an engine to cast stones.] Trepegett
you expounde a ramme to batter walles. But the trepegete was the same that the magonell; for
Chaucer calleth yt a trepegett or magonell; wherefore the trepegett and magonell being all
one, and the magonell one instrumente to flynge or cast stones (as youre selfe expounde yt)
into a towne, or against a towne walles, (an engine not muche vnlyke to the catapulte, an instrumente
to cast forthe dartes, stones, or arrowes,) the trepeget must nedes also be one instrumente
to cast stones or such lyke against a wall or into a towne, and not a Ramme to batter wales;
since the Ramme was no engine to flinge anye thinge, but by mens handes to be broughte and
pusshed againste the walles; a thinge farr different in forme from the magonell or catapulte,
as appereth by Vigetius and Robertus Valturius de re militari.

[Sidenote: Wiuer or Wyvern, a serpent like unto a dragon.] Wiuer yo{u} expounde not. Wherefore
I will tell you, a wyuer is a kynde of serpent of good Bulke, not vnlyke vnto a dragon, of
whose kinde he is, a thinge well knowen vnto the Heroldes, vsinge the same for armes, and crestes,
& supporters of manye gentle and noble menne. As the erle of Kent beareth a wiuer for his creste
and supporters, the erle of Pembroke, a wiuer vert for his creste; the erle of Cumberlande,
a wiuer geules for his supporters.

[Sidenote: Autenticke meaneth a thing of auctoritye, not of antiquitye.] Autenticke yo{u} expounde
to be antiquytye. But howe yo{u} may seme to force and racke the worde to Chaucers meaninge,
I knowe not; but sure I ame the proper signyficat{i}one of autenticke is a thinge of auctoritye
or credit allowed by menne of auctoritye, or the originall or fyrste archetypu{m} of any thinge;
whiche I muse that you did not remember.

[Sidenote: Abandone is not liberty though Hollyband sayeth so.] Abandone you expounde libertye;
whiche in all Italiane, Frenche, and Spanishe, signifyeth relinquere, to forsake and leave
a thinge; w{hi}che me thinkethe yo{u} most hardely stretche to libertye, vnlest yo{u} will
saye that, when one forsakethe a thinge, he leaveth yt at libertye; whiche ys but a streyned
speche, although the frenche Hollybande, not vnderstandinge the true energye of our tongue,
hath expounded yt libertye; whiche may be some warrante vnto you.

VNDER THE TITLE OF YOURE Annotacions and Corrections.

[Sidenote: Of the Vernacle.] IN YOURE ANNOTACIONS you describe, oute of the prologues, the
vernacle to be a broche or figure, wherein was sett the instruments wherewith Christe was crucyfyed,
and withall a napkyn whereine was the printe of his face. but the vernacle did not conteyne
the instrumentes of his deathe, but only the clothe wherein was the figure of his face; as
I conceve yt with others.

[Sidenote: Master Thynne would read Campaneus for Capaneus, and giveth reasons.] Fo: 1. pa:
2. For Campaneus you wolde reade Capaneus, wherunto I cannott yelde. for althoughe Statius
and other latine authors do call hym Capaneus; yet all the writers of Englande in that age
call him campaneus; as Gower, in confessione amantis, and Lidgat in the historye of Thebes
taken out of Statius, and Chaucer hym selfe in many other places. so that yt semethe they made
the pronu{n}tiatione of Campaneus to be the dialecte of our tongue for Capaneus. Besides chaucer
is in this to be p{ar}doned, in that taking his knightes tale out of the Thesayde of Bocas,
written in Italiane (and of late translated into frenche,) doth there, after the Italiane manner,
call him campaneus; for so the Italians pronounce woordes beginninge with cap: with the interposit{i}one
of the l{ette}re m, pronouncinge yt camp: for, that w{hi}che the Latins call capitoliu{m},
the Italians call campidoglio; and suche lyke. Wherefore since yt was vniversallye receued
in that age, to call him Campaneus: lett vs not nowe alter yt, but p{er}mytte yt to have free
passage accordinge to the pronuntiat{i}one and wrytinge of that age. since, in deducinge woordes
from one language to one other, there ys often additione and substract{i}one of letters, or
of Sillabes, before, in the middle, and in the ende of those wordes. whereof infynyte examples
mighte be produced, whiche I nowe shonne for brevytye.

[Sidenote: Liketh the reading of Eros, but preferreth that of Heros, and giveth reasons.] Fo:
3. pa: 2. (“Noughte comelye lyke to lovers maladye of Hereos.”) for whiche woorde hereos you
reade eros, i. cupide, a very good and probable correct{i}one, well gathered out of Luciane.
But (salua patient{i}a vestra, and reservinge to myselfe better iudgmente hereafter yf I nowe
mystake yt,) I wolde, for the printed hereos of Chaucer, read heroes. whiche two woordes onlye
differ in misplacinge of the letters; a comone thinge for the printer to do, and the corrector
to overpasse. for Arcyte, in this furye of his love, did not shewe those courses of gouer[n]mente,
whiche the Heroes, or valiante p{er}sons, in tymes past vsed, for thoughe they loued, yet that
passione did not generallye so farre overrule them (althoughe yt mighte in some one p{ar}ticuler
personne) as that theye lefte to contynewe the valor, and heroicke actions, whiche they before
performed. for the Heroes sholde so love, as that they sholde not forgett, what they were in
place, valor, or magnanymytye, whiche Arcite, in this pass{i}one, did not observe “lyke to
lovers malady of Heroes.” Whereof I coulde produce six hundred examples, (as the proverbe ys,)
were yt not that I avoyde tedious prolixytye.

[Sidenote: Of florins and their name from the Florentines.] Fo: 6. pa: 2. (“Manye a florence.”)
In whiche noote yo{u} expounde a florence to be ij^s frenche, and a gelder to be the same in
dutche. Wherein yo{u} mistake the valewe of the florens, suche as was vsed in Chaucers tyme,
w{hic}he taking his name of the woorkemenne, beinge florentynes, (of the terrytorye of florence
in Italye,) were called Florens; [Sidenote: Sterling money taketh its name from the Esterlings.]
as sterlinge money tooke their name of Esterlinges, whiche refyned and coyned the silver in
the tyme of kinge Henry the seconde. for two shillinges frenche ys not equall in valewe (as I
nowe take yt) to two shillinges Englishe: and much lesse equall to the florens in Chaucers
tyme, whiche was of the valewe of thre shillings, fowre pence, or halfe a noble, or, at the
leaste, of two shillinges tenne pence farthinge, as apperethe by recorde and historye: some
of them being called florens de scuto or of the valewe of the shelde or frenche crowne and
some of them called florens regall. Whereof yo{u} shall fynde, in the recorde of pellis exitus
in the exchequer in michelmas terme 41. Ed. 3. this note. Bartholomeo de Burgershe militi in
denariis sibi liberatis in parte solutionis 8000 florenoru{m} de scuto pretii petii iij^s.
iiij^d. sibi debitis de illis 30000 florenoru{m} de scuto in quibus Rex tenebatur eidem Bartholomeo

127, [Sidenote: King John of France, his ransom of three millions of florens.] where setting
downe the ransome of the frenche kinge taken at Poyters to the valewe of thre milliones of
florens, he sayethe “of w{hic}he florens duo valebant vj^s. viij^d.” These florens the same
Walsingha{m} in another place callethe scutes or frenche crownes, pa. 170, sayinge: Rex quidem
Franciæ pro sua redemptione soluit regi Angliæ tres milliones scutoru{m}, quoru{m} duo valent
vnu{m} nobile, videlicet, sex solidos et octo denarios. Whiche scutes in lyke manner, in the
tyme of kinge Henry the sixte were of the same valewe, as apperethe in Fortescues commentaries
of the lawes of Englande. But as those florens for the redempt{i}one of the frenche kinge,
were of the valewe of half one noble: so at the tyme of that kings reigne there were also one
other sorte of florens, not of lyke valewe, but conteyned within the price of ij^s. x^d. [QR].
called florene regales, as apperethe in this record, of Easter terme, of Pellis exitus before
sayed, where yt is thus entred one the sixte of Julye: Guiscardo de Angles. Domino de pleyne
martyne, In denariis sibi liberatis per manus Walteri Hewett militis in pretio 4000 florenoru{m}
regaliu{m} pretii petii --ij^s. x^d. [QR] de quibus florenis regal{ibus} 7 computantur pro
tribus nobilibus, eidem Guiscardo debitis. Whereby yo{u} see the meanest of these florens did
exceed the valewe of ij^s. frenche, (although you sholde equall that with ii^s. Englishe,)
as yt did also in other countryes. for in the lowe countryes at those dayes yt was much aboute
the valewe of iij^s. iiij^d. beinge halfe a pistolet Italiane or Spanyshe. for so sayethe Heuterius
Delphicus, (in the Historye of Burgundye, in the lyfe of Philippe le hardye,) lyving at that
tyme, and sonne to the frenche kinge taken prisoner by the Inglishe. Heuterius’ woordes be
these. Illustris viri aliorumq{ue} nobiliu{m} mors adeò comite{m} com{m}ovit, vt relicta obsidione
exercitus ad co{m}meatus ducendos in proxima loca distribuerit. Decem millibus florenorum (moneta

[Sidenote: Of the oken garland of Emelye.] Fo: 7. pa: 2. For unseriall yo{u} will vs to reade
cerriall, for cerrus[8] is a kynde of tree lyke one oke, bearinge maste; and therefore by yo{ur}
correct{i}one yt sholde be a garland of grene oke cerriall: But for the same reasone (because
cerrus ys a kynde of oke as ys also the Ilex) I judge yt sholde not be redde cerriall but unseriall,
that ys, (yf you will nedes have this worde cerriall,) a garlande of greene oke not cerriall,
as who sholde saye, she had a Garlande of Grene oke, but not of the oke Cerriall. and therefore
a garlande of oke unseriall, signifyinge a garlande that was freshe and Grene, and not of dedd
wannyshe Coolor as the oke Cerriall in some parte ys. for the Cerrus, being the tree w{hi}che
we comonly call the holme oke, (as Cooper also expoundeth the ilex to be that which wee call
holme,) produceth two kyndes; whereof the one hathe greater, and the other lesser acornes,
whose leaves beinge somewhat grene one the one syde, and of one ouer russett and darkyshe Coolor
on the other syde, were not mete for this garland of Emelye, whiche sholde be freshe and Grene
one everye parte, as were her younge and grene yeres, lyke to the goddesse to whome she sacryfyced,
and therefore a garlande of Grene oke unseriall, not beinge of oke cerriall, for yf yt had
byn oke serriall, yt wolde haue shewed duskyshe and as yt were of dedishe leaves, and not freshe
and orient as chaucer wolde haue her garlande. And this for yo{u}r e[x]posit{i}one of unseriall,
in some parte: for I wolde suppose that this worde unseriall dothe not vnaptly signifye perfectione
of coolor, so that She having a Garlande of Grene oke unseriall, doth signyfye the oke to be
grene and unseriall, that is, (as some do expounde this worde unseriall,) unsered, unsinged,
unwithered, of freshe coolor, lyke unto the oke Quercus whiche hath no sered nor withered cooloor
in his leafes. And yt was of necessytye that Emely (sacryfysinge to Diana) must haue a garlande
of the Grene oke Quercus, because that they whiche sacryfyced vnto Diana, otherwise called
Hecate, (which name is attribute to Diana, as natalis Comes affirmethe with statius in his
Acheleidos in his first Booke sayinge,

  Sic vbi virgineis Hecate lassata pharetris,

being Diana adorned with her bowe and arrowes, called also Triuia because Luna, Diana, and
Heccate, were all one, whereof Virgil speaketh,

  Tergemina{m}q{ue} Hecaten, tria virginis ora Dianæ,)

were adorned w{i}th a crowne of the grene oke Quercus, because that Heccate was wont to be
crowned therewith, as hath Pierius Valerianus in his 51 booke of Hieroglyphes, sayinge, Heccate
quoquè Quercu coronari solita est. for although Quercus be consecrate to Jupiter, because he
gave his oracles in the same in Sylva Dodonea, and therefore called Jupiter Dodoneus; yet Antiqutye
adorned and crowned Diana Heccate with the same crowne also. Wherefore I conclude, since she
(Emelye) had a garlande of Grene oke, (as Chaucer of purpose addeth that woorde Greene to explane
unseriall, whiche signyfyethe unsered, unparched, unwithered in every parte, not lyke to the
oke Serriall, whose leafe one the one syde is duskyshe as though yt were somewhat withered,)
that the same word unseriall must stand unamended, as well (as I sayed before) by youre owne
correct{i}one and the nature of the worde; as for that Diana, called Heccate, was crowned with
the oke Quercus and not with the oke cerrus. But yf yo{u} obiecte to mee that, in this place,
yt must be a garlande of oke cerriall accordinge to the woordes of Chaucer in one other place,
because that he in the flower and the leafe (newely printed by yo{u}) hath these woordes;

  I sie come first all in theire clokes white
  a companye that were for delight.
  Chapletts freshe of oke serriall
  Newly spronge and Trompetts they were all;

I denye that therefore in the Knightes Tale yt must be oke serriall. for yt may well bee, that
such meane persons as trompettes might be crowned with so base one oke as the serriall ys,
whiche I call base in respecte of the oke Quercus (dedicate to the godd Jupiter) wherewithe
Heccate was crowned, and whereof Garlands were gyven to the Romans for their nooble desarts
in the warres, as apperethe in the Quernall crowne gyven to those whiche had saved a cytyzen.
Wherefore Chaucer dothe rightly (and of purpose with great iudgm{en}t in my conceyte) make
a difference in the chaplettes of the Trompettes and the garlands of Emelye, in that the trompetts
chapletts were of oke seriall newly spronge; and not come to perfect{i}one, whiche yet yf they
had byn p{er}fecte wolde not haue byn soo oryente and Greene one bothe sydes as ys the oke
Quercus, wherewithe he wolde haue this Emelye crowned, as was her goddesse Heccate Diana (to whom
she dyd sacryfyce) accustomed to bee. for so in tymes past (as I sayed before) the sacryfycer
sholde be adorned with garlandes of suche thinges, as were consecrate to the goddes to whome
they sacryfyced. for whiche cause also I ame not moved, thoughe Caxtone in his seconde editione
do call yt one oke serriall. for I knowe (not withstandinge his fayre prologe of printing that
by a true copye) there be manye imperfections in that Booke.

[Sidenote: Eyther for euerye, an overnice correction.] Fo: 9. pa: 1. For euerye) yo{u} will
us to reade eyther. But the sence ys good, as well that they dyd ryde one euerye syde of hym,
as of eyther syde of him. for they boothe colde not ryde of euerye syde of hym, no moore then
they both colde ryde of eyther syde of him; and therefore they two ryding one euerye side of
hym, canne haue noone other construct{i}one then that the one did ryde of the one syde and
the other one the other side, aud therefore an ouer nice correct{i}one, thoughe some coppies
do warrant yt:

[Sidenote: The intellect of Arcite had not wholly gone, or he would not have known Emelye.]
Fo: 10. pa: 1. for save only the intellecte,) yo{u} wolde haue us to reade “and also the intellecte.”
But yf yo{u} well consider the woordes of Chaucer, (as I have donne in all the written copyes
whiche I haue yet seene,) his meaninge ys not that the intellecte was wholye goonne, as yt
wolde bee yf yo{u} sholde reade, “and also the intellecte” for “save only the intellecte.”
for Chaucers meanynge ys, that all his streng[t]he and vitall Sprites aboute his outewarde
partes were gonne, save onlye the intellecte or vnderstandinge, w{hi}che remayned sounde and
good, as apperethe after by the followinge woordes, for when deathe approched, and that all
outwarde senses fayled, he (Arcite) yet cast eye vppon Emelye, remembringe her, thoughe the
cheifest vitall sprite of his harte and his streng[th]e were gonne from hym. but he colde not
haue cast his eye vppon Emelye, yf his intellecte had fayled hym. Yet yf you liste to reade,
“and also the intellecte,” for saue only the intellecte, yt may after a sorte somewhat be borne
withall, notwithstandinge that a pointe at streng[t]he is looste; and a parenthesis includynge
(Save only the intellecte, without moore,) will make the sence good in this sort as I have
here pointed yt:

  And yet moore ouer from his armes two
  the vital streng[t]he is lost; and all agoo
  (save only the intellecte without moore)
  that dwelleth in his hart sicke and sore
  gan faylen: When the hart felt death &c.

[Sidenote: Straught, a better word than haughte.] Fo: 10. pa: 2. For armes straughte you wolde
reade yt haughte, when straughte is moore significa{n}t (and moore answerable to Chaucers woordes
whiche followethe) than haughte ys. for he speakethe of the Bredthe and spredinge of the boughes
or armes or branches of the tree, whiche this woorde straughte doth signyfye, and is moore
aptlye sett downe for stretched, then this woorde haughte, whiche signyfyethe catchinge holde,
or holdinge faste, or (yf you will streyne yt againste his nature) stretching on heigh, whiche
agreethe not well with Chaucers meanynge. for these be his words:

  And twenty fadome of breedth, armes straughte;
  That is to sayen, the Bowes were so broode, &c.

[Sidenote: Visage for vassalage, an impertinent correction.] Fo: 11. pa: 1. For all forgotten
in his vassalage, yow wolde haue vs reade, “for all forgotten is then his visage;” a thinge
mere impertinente. for the forgettinge of his visage and personage is not materiall, nor regarded
of anye to haue his face forgotten, but yt is muche materiall (and so ys Chaucers meanynge)
that his vassalage, and the good service donne in his youthe, shold be forgotten when he waxethe
olde. And therefore yt must bee “his vassalage forgotten;” as presently after Chaucer sayeth,
better for a manne to dye when he is yonge, and his honor in price, than when he is olde, and
the service of his youthe forgotten; w{hic}he I coulde dilate and prove by manye examples;
but I cannott stande longe vppon euerye pointe, as well for that I wolde not be tedious vnto
yo{u}, as for that leysure serveth me not thereunto.

[Sidenote: Leefe for lothe, a nedeless correction.] Fo: 13. pa: 1. For lothe yo{u} bidde vs
reade leefe, which annotacione neded not to haue byn there sett downe, because the verye woorde
in the texte is lefe.

[Sidenote: It is more likely that Absolon knocked than that he coughed at the window.] Fo:
14. pa: 1. for knocked yo{u} reade coughed, but, the circumstance considered, (althoughe they
may both stande,) yt is moore probable that he[9] knocked at her[10] windowe, than that he
coughed. for although those woordes “with a semely sownde” may haue relatione to the voyce,
yet they may as well and with as much consonancye haue reference to a semely and gentle kynde
of knockinge at the windowe as to the voyce, and so his meanynge was by that sounde to wake
her, whiche wolde rather be by the noyse of a knocke than of a coughe. for so he determyned
before to knocke, as apperethe in these verses, when he sayed,

  So mote I thryve, I shall at cockes crow
  Full priuily knocke at his windowe:

And so apperethe by the tale afterwarde that he knocked, as he did before, although he coughed
also at the latter tyme, for he knocked twyce.

    [Footnote 9: [Absolon.]]

    [Footnote 10: [The Carpenter’s wife’s.]]

[Sidenote: Surrye or Russye, indifferent which.] Fo: 23. pa: 2. For Surrye you read Russye.
true yt is, that some written copies haue Russye, and some Surrye. And therefore indifferent
after the written copies, and some auncient printed copies before my fathers editione. But
yf I shall interpone my opynione, I wolde more willingly (for this tyme) receve Surrey, because
yt is most lykelye that the tartarians whiche dwelt at Sara (a place yet well knowen, and bordering
vppon the lake Mare Casp{iu}m,) are nerer to Sorria or the countryes adioynynge called Syria,
than to Russya. For as Hato the Armeniane, in his Tartariane Historye, sayeth, The cyttye of
Sara was auncyently the famous cyttye of the countrye of Cumania; and the Tartarians obteyned
the kingdome of Syria in the yere 1240, w{hi}che must be in the tyme of the fyrst Tartariane
emperor called Caius canne, [Sidenote: Cambuscan is Caius canne.] beinge (as I suppose) he
whome Chaucer namethe Cambiuscan, for so ys the written copies, such affynytye is there betwene
those two names. And, as I gather, yt was after that tyme that the Tartarians had warres in
Russia. But I leave yt indifferent at this tyme, as meanynge further to consider of yt.

[Sidenote: “That may not saye naye,” better than “there may no wighte say naye.”] Fo: 31. pa:
2. for these woordes, “that may not saye naye,” yo{u} reade “there may no wighte say naye.”
bothe whiche are good, and boothe founde in written coppyes; and yet the firste will better
stande, in my conceyte, because [the king of Faerie] there speakinge to his wyfe, he urgethe
her that she cannott denye yt; when he sayeth, my wyfe that cannott say naye, as who sholde
saye yo{u} cannot denye yt because you knowe yt; and experience teacheth yt, so that these
woordes, “that cannott say naye,” must be taken as spoken of his wyfes knowledge, and so as
good or rather better than “there may no wighte saye naye,” consideringe that these wordes
“that cannott saye naye,” dothe signyfye, “whoe cannott saye naye,” in such sorte that this
relatyve (that) meanynge (whoe) must haue reference to his antecedente, i. e. this worde wyfe.

[Sidenote: Theophraste, not Paraphraste.] Fo: 35. pa: 2. For “He cleped yt valerye and theophraste,”
you saye some wolde haue vs reade “Valery and his Paraphraste.” But as yo{u} haue left yt at
libertee to the reader to iudge, so I thinke yt must nedes be Theophraste; as the author [of]
Policraticon in his eighte Booke, ca. 11. [Sidenote: The wife of Bath’s Prologue taken from
the author of Policraticon.] (from whome Chaucer borrowethe almost worde for worde a great
parte of the Wyfe of Bathes Prologe,) doth vouche yt, for the author of that booke, Johannes
Sarisburiensis, lyvinge in the tyme of Henrye the seconde, sayethe, Fertur authore Hieronimo
Aureolus Theophrasti liber, de nuptiis, in quo quæritur an vir sapiens ducat vxorem, etc. And
the frenche molinet, moralizinge the Romant of the roose in frenche, and turnynge it oute of
verse into proese, writeth, Ha si i’eusse creu Theophraste, &c. Oh, yf I had beleved Theophraste,
I had never maried womanne, for he doth not holde hym wise that marieth anye womanne, be she
fayre, foule, poore, or riche; as he sayeth in his Booke Aureolle; whiche verye wordes chaucer
doth recyte.

[Sidenote: Country, not Couentry.] Fo: 38. pa: 2. for this worde Countrye you will vs to reade
Couentrye. But in my writtene copies yt is, “in my Countrye,” whiche I holde the truer and
for the sence as good yf not better.

[Sidenote: Maketh, not waketh.] Fo: 41. pa: 1. This woorde makethe is corrected by you, who
for the same do place wakethe; w{hi}che cannott well stande, for Chaucers woordes being, “this
maketh the fende,” dothe signyfye (by a true conuers{i}one after the dialecte of our tonge,
w{hi}che with beawtye vsethe suche transmutac{i}one as I coulde gyve yo{u} manye pretye instances,)
that the sence thereof ys, “the fende makethe this,” for whiche Chaucer vseth these wordes
by Transposit{i}one, (accordinge to the rhethoricall figure Hiperbatone) “This makethe the
fende:” Whiche this? Anger: for that comethe, ys made, or occasioned, by the deuell. But yf
yt sholde be wakethe, then must the sence bee, that this (whiche is the anger he speakethe
of before) wakethe the fende; whiche oure offences cannot do, because he cannott be waked,
in that he neyther slumbrethe nor slepethe, but alwayes watcheth and howrely seekethe occas{i}one
to destroye us, lyke a roringe lyone. But yf you will nedes saye “this wakethe the fende,”
that is, by conuersione after this manner, “the fende waketh this,” whiche signyfyeth the fende
waketh or styrreth this in manne, yt may, after a harde and over-streyned sorte, beare some
sence, whiche yet hath not that energye, sprite or lyfe, w{hi}che haue Chaucers woordes, “this
maketh the fende.” Whiche woordes are in my written copies, and in all written and auncient
printed copies whiche I have yet seene.
