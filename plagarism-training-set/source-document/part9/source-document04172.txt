Mr. Wm. B. Fuller found by tests that a dry sand, having 34 per cent. voids, shrunk 9.6 per
cent. in volume upon thorough tamping until it had 27 per cent. voids. The same sand moistened
with 6 per cent. water and loose had 44 per cent. voids, which was reduced to 31 per cent.
by ramming. The same sand saturated with water had 33 per cent. voids and by thorough ramming
its volume was reduced 8½ per cent. until the sand had only 26¼ per cent. voids. Further experiments
might be quoted and will be found recorded in several general treatises on concrete, but these
are enough to demonstrate conclusively that any theory of the quantity of cement in mortar
to be correct must take into account the effect of moisture on the voids in sand.

The effect of the size and the shape of the component grains on the amount of voids in sand
is considerable. Feret's experiments are conclusive on these points, and they alone will be
followed here. Taking for convenience three sizes of sand Feret mixed them in all the varying
proportions possible with a total of 10 parts; there were 66 mixtures. The sizes used were:
Large (L), sand composed of grains passing a sieve of 5 meshes per linear inch and retained
on a sieve of 15 meshes per linear inch; medium (M>), sand passing a sieve of 15 meshes and
retained on a sieve of 50 meshes per linear inch, and fine (F), sand passing a 50-mesh sieve.
With a dry sand whose grains have a specific gravity of 2.65, the weight of a cubic yard of
either the fine, or the medium, or the large size, was 2,190 lbs., which is equivalent to 51
per cent. voids. The greatest weight of mixture, 2,840 lbs. per cu. yd., was an L{6}M{0}F{4}
mixture, that is, one composed of six parts large, no parts medium and 4 parts fine; this mixture
was the densest of the 66 mixtures made, having 36 per cent. voids. It will be noted that the
common opinion that the densest mixture is obtained by a mixture of gradually increasing sizes
of grains is incorrect; there must be enough difference in the size of the grains to provide
voids so large that the smaller grains will enter them and not wedge the larger grains apart.
Turning now to the shape of the grains, the tests showed that rounded grains give less voids
than angular grains. Using sand having a composition of L{5}M{3}F{2} Feret got the following
results:

                                     --Per cent. Voids--
Kind of Grains.                       Shaken.     Unshaken.
Natural sand, rounded grains           25.6        35.9
Crushed quartzite, angular grains      27.4        42.1
Crushed shells, flat grains            31.8        44.3
Residue of quartzite, flat grains      34.6        47.5

The sand was shaken until no further settlement occurred. It is plain from these data on the
effect of size and shape of grains on voids why it is that discrepancies exist in the published
data on voids in dry sand. An idea of the wide variation in the granulometric composition of
different sands is given by Table II. Table III shows the voids as determined for sands from
different localities in the United States.

~Voids in Broken Stone and Gravel.~--The percentage of voids in broken stone varies with the
nature of the stone: whether it is broken by hand or by crushers; with the kind of crusher
used, and upon whether it is screened or crusher-run product. The voids in broken stone seldom
exceed 52 per cent. even when the fragments are of uniform size and the stone is shoveled loose
into the measuring box. The following records of actual determinations of voids in broken stone
cover a sufficiently wide range of conditions to show about the limits of variation.

The following are results of tests made by Mr. A. N. Johnson, State Engineer of Illinois, to
determine the variation in voids in crushed stone due to variation in size and to method of
loading into the measuring box. The percentage of voids was determined by weighing the amount
of water added to fill the box:

           Method of          Per cent.

3/8 in.    Shovels              40.6
3/8 in.    Shovels              41.0

The table shows clearly the effect on voids of compacting the stone by dropping it; it also
shows for the ¾-in. and the 3/8-in. stone loaded by shovels how uniformly the percentages of
voids run for stone of one size only. Dropping the stone 20 ft. reduced the voids some 12 to
15 per cent. as compared with shoveling.

Table IV gives the voids in broken stone as determined by various engineers; it requires no
explanation. Table V, taken from Feret's tests, shows the effect of changes in granulometric
composition on the amount of voids in both broken stone and gravel. Considering the column
giving voids in stone it is to be noted first how nearly equal the voids are for stone of uniform
size whatever that size be. As was the case with sand a mixture of coarse and fine particles
gives the fewest voids; for stone an L{1}M{0}F{1} mixture and for gravel an L{8}M{0}F{2} mixture.
Tamping reduces the voids in broken stone. Mr. Geo. W. Rafter gives the voids in clean, hand-broken
limestone passing a 2½-in. ring as 43 per cent. after being lightly shaken and 37½ per cent.
after being rammed. Generally speaking heavy ramming will reduce the voids in loose stone about
20 per cent.

It is rare that gravel has less than 30 per cent. or more than 45 per cent. voids. If the pebbles
vary considerably in size so that the small fit in between the large, the voids may be as low
as 30 per cent. but if the pebbles are tolerably uniform in size the voids will approach 45
per cent. Table V shows the effect of granulometric composition on the voids in gravel as determined
by Feret. Mr. H. Von Schon gives the following granulometric analysis of a gravel having 34.1
per cent. voids:

Retained on 1-in. ring, per cent.          10.70 Retained on 3/8-in. ring, per cent.      
23.65 Retained on No. 4 sieve, per cent.          8.70 Retained on No. 10 sieve, per cent.
17.14 Retained on No. 20 sieve, per cent.        21.76 Retained on No. 30 sieve, per cent.
6.49 Retained on No. 40 sieve, per cent.         5.96 Passed a No. 40 sieve, per cent.    
5.59 Passed a 1½-in ring, per cent.            100.00

As mixtures of broken stone and gravel are often used the following determinations of voids
in such mixtures are given. The following determinations were made by Mr. Wm. M. Hall for mixtures
of blue limestone and Ohio River washed gravel:

Per cent.         Per cent.   Per cent.

    0      "        100          35

The dust was screened from the stone all of which passed a 2½-in. ring; the gravel all passed
a 1½-in. screen. Using the same sizes of gravel and Hudson River trap rock, the results were:

Per cent.     Per cent.           Per cent.
 Trap.         Gravel.          Voids in Mix.
Pure quartz weighs 165 lbs., per cu. ft., hence broken quartz having 40
per cent. voids weighs 165 × .60 = 99 lbs. per cu. ft. Few gravels are
entirely quartz, and many contain stone having a greater specific
gravity like some traps or a less specific gravity like some shales and
sandstone. Tables VI and VII give the specific gravities of common
stones and minerals and Table VIII gives the weights corresponding to
different percentages of voids for different specific gravities.

In buying broken stone by the cubic yard it should be remembered that hauling in a wagon compacts
the stone by shaking it down and reduces the volume. Table IX shows the results of tests made
by the Illinois Highway Commission to determine the settlement of crushed stone in wagon loads
for different lengths of haul. The road over which the tests were made was a macadam road,
not particularly smooth, but might be considered as an average road surface. The wagon used
was one with a dump bottom supported by chains, which were drawn as tight as possible, so as
to reduce the sag to a minimum. It will be noticed that about 50 per cent. of the settlement
occurs within the first 100 ft., and 75 per cent. of the settlement in the first 200 ft. Almost
all of the settlement occurs during the first half mile, as the tests showed practically no
additional settlement for distances beyond. Some of the wagons were loaded from the ground
with shovels, others were loaded from bins, the stone having a 15-ft. drop, which compacted
the stone a little more than where loaded with shovels, so that there was somewhat less settlement.
But at the end of a half mile the density was practically the same, whatever the method of
loading. The density at the beginning and at the end of the haul can be compared by the weight
of a given volume of crushed stone. For convenience, the weight of a cubic yard of the material
at the beginning of the haul and at the end was computed from the known contents of a wagon.

~THEORY OF THE QUANTITY OF CEMENT IN MORTAR AND CONCRETE.~--All sand contains a large percentage
of voids; in 1 cu. ft. of loose sand there is 0.3 to 0.5 cu. ft. of voids, that is, 30 to 50
per cent. of the sand is voids. In making mortar the cement is mixed with the sand and the
flour-like particles of the cement fit in between the grains of sand occupying a part or all
of the voids. The amount of cement required in a mortar will naturally depend upon the amount
of voids in the particular sand with which it is mixed and since a correct estimate of the
number of barrels of cement per cubic yard of mortar is very important, and since it is not
always possible to make actual mixtures before bidding, rules based on various theories have
been formulated for determining these quantities. In this volume the rule based on the theory
outlined by one of the authors in 1901 will be followed. The following is a discussion of the
authors' theory:

When loose sand is mixed with water, its volume or bulk is increased; subsequent jarring will
decrease its volume, but still leave a net gain of about 10 per cent.; that is, 1 cu. ft. of
dry sand becomes about 1.1 cu. ft. of damp sand. Not only does this increase in the volume
of the sand occur, but, instead of increasing the voids that can be filled with cement, there
is an absolute loss in the volume of available voids. This is due to the space occupied by
the water necessary to bring the sand to the consistency of mortar; furthermore, there is seldom
a perfect mixture of the sand and cement in practice, thus reducing the available voids. It
is safe to call this reduction in available voids about 10 per cent.

When loose, dry Portland cement is wetted, it shrinks about 15 per cent, in volume, behaving
differently from the sand, but it never shrinks back to quite as small a volume as it occupies
when packed tightly in a barrel. Since barrels of different brands vary widely in size, the
careful engineer or contractor will test any brand he intends using in large quantities, in
order to ascertain exactly how much cement paste can be made. He will find a range of from
3.2 cu. ft. to 3.8 cu. ft. per barrel of Portland cement. Obviously the larger barrel may be
cheaper though its price is higher. Specifications often state the number of cubic feet that
will be allowed per barrel in mixing the concrete ingredients, so that any rule or formula
to be of practical value must contain a factor to allow for the specified size of the barrel,
and another factor to allow for the actual number of cubic feet of paste that a barrel will
yield--the two being usually quite different.

The deduction of a rational, practical formula for computing the quantity of cement required
for a given mixture will now be given, based upon the facts above outlined.

     Let p = number of cu. ft. cement paste per bbl., as determined
                     by actual test.
         n = number of cu. ft. of cement per bbl., as specified in
                     the specifications.
         s = parts of sand (by volume) to one part of cement, as
                     specified.
         g = parts of gravel or broken stone (by volume) to one
                     part of cement, as specified.
         v = percentage of voids in the dry sand, as determined
                     by test.
         V = percentage of voids in the gravel or stone, as determined
                     by test.

Then, in a mortar of 1 part cement to s parts sand, we have:

               n s = cu. ft. of dry sand to 1 bbl. of cement.
             n s v = "   "   "  voids in the dry sand.
         0.9 n s v = "   "   "  available voids in the wet sand.
           1.1 n s = "   "   "  wet sand.
     p - 0.9 n s v = "   "   "  cement paste in excess of the voids.

Therefore:

     1.1 n s + (p - 0.9 n s v) = cu. ft. of mortar per bbl.

Therefore:

                    27                            27
     N = -------------------------   =    --------------------
         1.1 n s + (p - 0.9 n s v)        p + n s (1.1 - 0.9 v)

N being the number of barrels of cement per cu. yd. of mortar.

When the mortar is made so lean that there is not enough cement paste to fill the voids in
the sand, the formula becomes:

           27
     N = -------
         1.1 n s

A similar line of reasoning will give us a rational formula for determining the quantity of
cement in concrete; but there is one point of difference between sand and gravel (or broken
stone), namely, that the gravel does not swell materially in volume when mixed with water.
However, a certain amount of water is required to wet the surface of the pebbles, and this
water reduces the available voids, that is, the voids that can be filled by the mortar. With
this in mind, the following deduction is clear, using the nomenclature and symbols above given:

           ng = cu. ft. of dry gravel (or stone).
         ng V = "    "   " voids in dry gravel.
     0.9 ng V = "    "   " "available voids" in the wet gravel.
     p + n s (1.1 - 0.9 v) - 0.9 ng V = excess of mortar over the available
                  voids in the wet gravel.
     ng + p + n s (1.1 - 0.9 v) - 0.9 ng V = cu. ft. of concrete from
                 1 bbl. cement.

                              27
    N = -----------------------------------------------
         p + n s (1.1 - 0.9v) + ng (1 - 0.9V)

N being the number of barrels of cement required to make 1 cu. yd. of concrete.

This formula is rational and perfectly general. Other experimenters may find it desirable to
use constants slightly different from the 1.1 and the 0.9, for fine sands swell more than coarse
sands, and hold more water.

The reader must bear in mind that when the voids in the sand exceed the cement paste, and when
the available voids in the gravel (or stone) exceed the mortar, the formula becomes:

           27
     N = ------
           ng

These formulas give the amounts of cement in mortars and concretes compacted in place. Tables
X to XIII are based upon the foregoing theory, and will be found to check satisfactorily with
actual tests.

In using these tables remember that the proportion of cement to sand is by volume, and not
by weight. If the specifications state that a barrel of cement shall be considered to hold
4 cu. ft., for example, and that the mortar shall be 1 part cement to 2 parts sand, then 2
barrel of cement is mixed with 8 cu. ft. of sand, regardless of what is the actual size of
the barrel, and regardless of how much cement paste can be made with a barrel of cement. If
the specifications fail to state what the size of a barrel will be, then the contractor is
left to guess.

due both to the variation in the per cent. of voids, and to the variation in the kind of minerals
of which the sand is composed. A quartz sand having 35 per cent. voids weighs 107 lbs. per
cu. ft.; but a quartz sand having 45 per cent. voids weighs only 91 lbs. per cu. ft. If the
weight of the sand must be guessed at, assume 100 lbs. per cu. ft. If the specifications require
a mixture of 1 cement to 2 of sand by weight, we will have 380 lbs. (or 1 bbl.) of cement mixed
with 2 × 380, or 760 lbs. of sand; and if the sand weighs 90 lbs. per cu. ft., we shall have
760 ÷ 90, or 8.44 cu. ft. of sand to every barrel of cement. In order to use the tables above
given, we may specify our own size of barrel; let us say 4 cu. ft.; then 8.44 ÷ 4 gives 2.11
parts of sand by volume to 1 part of cement. Without material error we may call this a 1 to
2 mortar, and use the tables, remembering that our barrel is now "specified to be" 4 cu. ft.
If we have a brand of cement that yields 3.4 cu. ft. of paste per bbl., and sand having 45
per cent. voids, we find that approximately 3 bbls. of cement per cu. yd. of mortar will be
required.

     NOTE.--This table is to be used where cement is measured packed
     in the barrel, for the ordinary barrel holds 3.8 cu. ft.

It should be evident from the foregoing discussions that no table can be made, and no rule
can be formulated that will yield accurate results unless the brand of cement is tested and
the percentage of voids in the sand determined. This being so the sensible plan is to use the
tables merely as a rough guide, and, where the quantity of cement to be used is very large,
to make a few batches of mortar using the available brands of cement and sand in the proportions
specified. Ten dollars spent in this way may save a thousand, even on a comparatively small
job, by showing what cement and sand to select.

It will be seen that Tables XII and XIII can be condensed into the following rule:

Add together the number of parts and divide this sum into ten, the quotient will be approximately
the number of barrels of cement per cubic yard. Barrel specified to be 4.4 cu. ft.)

     NOTE.--This table is to be used when the cement is measured
     loose, after dumping it into a box, for under such conditions a
     barrel of cement yields 4.4 cu. ft. of loose cement.

Thus for a 1:2:5 concrete, the sum of the parts is 1 + 2 + 5, which is 8; then 10 ÷ 8 is 1.25
bbls., which is approximately equal to the 1.30 bbls. given in the table. Neither is this rule
nor are the tables applicable if a different size of cement barrel is specified, or if the
voids in the sand or stone differ materially from 40 per cent. to 45 per cent. respectively.
There are such innumerable combinations of varying voids, and varying sizes of barrel, that
the authors do not deem it worth while to give other tables. Sabin           | 7.40 | 4.17

The proportions were by barrels of cement to barrels of sand, and Sabin called a 380-lb. barrel
3.65 cu. ft., whereas Fuller called a 380-lb. barrel 3.80 cu. ft.; and Boardman called a 380-lb.
barrel 3.5 cu. ft. Sabin used a sand having 38 per cent. voids; Fuller used a sand having 45
per cent. voids; and Boardman used a sand having 38 per cent. voids. It will be seen that the
cement used by Sabin yielded 3.65 cu. ft. of cement paste per bbl. (i. e. 27 ÷ 7.4), whereas
the (Atlas) cement used by Fuller yielded 3.4 cu. ft. of cement paste per bbl. Sabin found
that a barrel of cement measured 4.37 cu. ft. when dumped and measured loose. Mr. Boardman
states a barrel (380 lbs., net) of Lehigh Portland cement yields 3.65 cu. ft. of cement paste;
and that a barrel (265 lbs., net) of Louisville natural cement yields 3.0 cu. ft. of cement paste.

Mr. J. J. R. Croes, M. Am. Soc. C. E., states that 1 bbl. of Rosendale cement and 2 bbl. of
sand (8 cu. ft.) make 9.7 cu. ft. of mortar, the extreme variations from this average being
7 per cent.

Frequently concrete is made by mixing one volume of cement with a given number of volumes of
pit gravel; no sand being used other than the sand that is found naturally mixed with the gravel.
In such cases the cement rarely increases the bulk of the gravel, hence Table XIV will give
the approximate amount of cement, assuming 1 cu. yd. of gravel per cubic yard of concrete.

~PERCENTAGE OF WATER IN CONCRETE.~--Tests show that dry mixtures when carefully deposited and
well tamped produce the stronger concrete. This superiority of dry mixtures it must be observed
presupposes careful deposition and thorough tamping, and these are tasks which are difficult
to have accomplished properly in actual construction work and which, if accomplished properly,
require time and labor. Wet mixtures readily flow into the corners and angles of the forms
and between and around the reinforcing bars with only a small amount of puddling and slicing
and are, therefore, nearly always used because of the time and labor saved in depositing and
tamping. The following rule by which to determine the percentage of water by weight for any
given mixture of mortar for wet concrete will be found satisfactory:

Multiply the parts of sand by 8, add 24 to the product, and divide the total by the sum of
the parts of sand and cement.

For example if the percentage of water is required for a 1-3 mortar:

     (3 × 8) + 24
     ------------  = 12.
           4

Hence the water should be 12 per cent. of the combined weight of cement and sand. For a 1-1
mortar the rule gives 16 per cent.; for a 1-2 mortar it gives 13½ per cent., and for a 1-6
mortar it gives 10.3 per cent.

To calculate the amount of water per cubic yard of 1-3-6 concrete for example the procedure
would be as follows: By the above rule a 1-3 mortar requires

     (3 × 8) + 24
     ------------ = 12 per cent. water.
         4

A 1-3-6 concrete, according to Table XII, contains 1.05 bbls. cement and 0.44 cu. yd. sand.
Cement weighs 380 lbs. per barrel, hence 1.05 bbls. would weigh 380 × 1.05 = 399 lbs. Sand
weighs 2,700 lbs. per cu. yd., hence 0.44 cu. yd. of sand would weigh 2,700 × 0.44 = 1,188
lbs. The combined weight of the cement and sand would thus be 399 + 1,188 = 1,587 lbs. and
12 per cent. of 1.587 lbs. is 190 lbs. of water. Water weighs 8.355 lbs. per gallon, hence
190 × 8.355 = 23 gallons of water per cubic yard of 1-3-6 concrete.

~METHODS OF MEASURING AND WEIGHING.~--The cement, sand and aggregate for concrete mixtures
are usually measured by hand, the measuring being done either in the charging buckets or in
the barrows or other receptacles used to handle the material to the charging buckets. The process
is simple in either case when once the units of measurement are definitely stated. This is
not always the case. Some engineers require the contractor to measure the sand and stone in
the same sized barrel that the cement comes in, in which case 1 part of sand or aggregate usually
means 3.5 cu. ft. Other engineers permit both heads of the barrel to be knocked out for convenience
in measuring the sand and stone, in which case a barrel means 3.75 cu. ft. Still other engineers
permit the cement to be measured loose in a box, then a barrel usually means from 4 to 4.5
cu. ft. Cement is shipped either in barrels or in bags and the engineer should specify definitely
the volume at which he will allow the original package to be counted, and also, if cement barrels
are to be used in measuring the sand and stone, he should specify what a "barrel" is to be.
When the concrete is to be mixed by hand the better practice is to measure the sand and stone
in bottomless boxes of the general type shown by Fig. 10 and of known volume, and then specify
that a bag of cement shall be called 1 cu. ft., 0.6 cu. ft., or such other fraction of a cubic
foot as the engineer may choose. The contractor then has a definite basis on which to estimate
the quantity of cement required for any specified mixture. The same is true if the measuring
of the sand and stone be done in barrows or in the charging bucket. The volume of the bag or
barrel of cement being specified the contractor has a definite and simple problem to solve
in measuring his materials.

To avoid uncertainty and labor in measuring the cement, sand and stone or gravel various automatic
measuring devices have been designed. A continuous mixer with automatic measuring and charging
mechanism is described in Chapter XIV. Figure 11 shows the Trump automatic measuring device.
It consists of a series of revolving cylinders, each opening onto a "table," which revolves
with the cylinders, and of a set of fixed "knives," which, as the "tables" revolve, scrape
off portions of the material discharged from each cylinder onto its "table." The illustration
shows a set of two cylinders; for concrete work a third cylinder is added. The three tables
are set one above the other, each with its storage cylinder, and being attached to the same
spindle all revolve together. For each table there is a knife with its own adjusting mechanism.
These knives may be adjusted at will to vary the percentage of material scraped off.

Automatic measuring devices are most used in connection with continuous mixers, but they may
be easily adapted to batch mixers if desired. One point to be observed is that all of these
automatic devices measure the cement loose and this must be allowed for in proportioning the
mixture.

CHAPTER III.

METHODS AND COST OF MAKING AND PLACING CONCRETE BY HAND.

The making and placing of concrete by hand is divided into the following operations: (1) Loading
the barrows, buckets, carts or cars used to transport the cement, sand and stone to the mixing
board; (2) Transporting and dumping the material; (3) Mixing the material by turning with shovels
and hoes; (4) Loading the concrete by shovels into barrows, buckets, carts or cars; (5) Transporting
the concrete to place; (6) Dumping and spreading; (7) Ramming.

~LOADING INTO STOCK PILES.~--Stock piles should always be provided unless there is some very
good reason to the contrary. They prevent stoppage of work through irregularities in the delivery
of the material, and they save foreman's time in watching that the material is delivered as
promptly as needed for the work immediately in hand. The location of the stock piles should
be as close to the work as possible without being in the way of construction; forethought both
in locating the piles and in proportioning their size to the work will save the contractor money.

The stone and sand will ordinarily be delivered in wagons or cars. If delivered in cars, effort
should be made to secure delivery in flat cars when the unloading is to be done by shoveling;
this is more particularly necessary for the broken stone. Stone can be shoveled from hopper
bottom cars only with difficulty as compared with shoveling from flat bottom cars; the ratio
is about 14 cu. yds. per day per man from hopper bottom cars as compared with 20 cu. yds. per
day per man from flat bottom cars. When the cars can be unloaded through a trestle, hopper
bottom cars should by all means be secured for delivering the stone. If the amount of work
will justify the expense, a trestle may be built; often there is a railway embankment which
can be dug away for a short distance and the track carried on stringers to make a dumping place,
from which the stone can be shoveled.

Sand can be dumped directly on the ground, but broken stone unless it is very small, ¾-in.
or less, should always be dumped on a well made plank floor. A good floor is made of 2-in.
plank, nailed to 4×6-in. mud sills, spaced 3 ft. apart, and well bedded in the ground. Loose
plank laid directly on the ground settle unevenly and thus the smooth shoveling surface which
is sought is not obtained; the object of the floor is to provide an even surface, along which
a square pointed shovel can be pushed; it is very difficult to force such a shovel into broken
stone unless it is very fine. A spading fork is a better tool than a shovel, with which to
load broken stone from piles. A man can load from 18 to 20 cu. yds. of broken stone into wheelbarrows
or carts in 10 hours when shoveling from a good floor, but he can load only 12 to 14 cu. yds.
per day when shoveling from a pile without such a floor. It is a common thing to see stone
unloaded from cars directly onto the sloping side of a railway embankment. This makes very
difficult shoveling and results in a waste of stone. Stone can usually be delivered by a steel
lined chute directly to a flooring located at the foot of the embankment; coarse broken stone
if given a start when cast from a shovel will slide on an iron chute having a slope as flat
as 3 or 4 to 1; sand will not slide on a slope of 1½ to 1. When chuting is not practicable
it will pay often to shovel the stone into buckets handled by a stiff-leg derrick rather than
to unload it onto the bank. Stock piles of ample storage capacity are essential when delivery
is by rail, because of the uncertainty of rail shipments. When the contractor is taking the
sand and stone direct from pit and quarry by wagon it is not necessary to have large stock piles.

~LOADING FROM STOCK PILES.~--In loading sand into wheelbarrows or carts with shovels a man
will load 20 cu. yds. per 10-hour day if he is energetic and is working under a good foreman.
Under opposite conditions 15 cu. yds. per man per day is all that it is safe to count on. A
man shoveling from a good floor will load 20 cu. yds. of stone per 10-hour day; this is reduced
to 15 cu. yds. per day if the stone is shoveled off the ground and to 12 cu. yds. per day if
in addition the management is poor. There are ordinarily in a cubic yard of concrete about
1 cu. yd. of stone and 0.4 cu. yd. of sand, so that the cost of loading the materials into
barrows or carts, with wages at 15 cts. per hour and assuming 15 cu. yds. to be a day's work,
would be:

1   cu. yd. stone loaded for        10 cts.
0.4 cu. yd. sand loaded for          4 cts.
                                    -------
    Total                           14 cts.

To this is to be added the cost of loading the cement. This will cost not over 2 cts. per cu.
yd. of concrete; the total cost of loading concrete materials into barrows or carts, therefore,
does not often exceed 16 cts. per cu. yd. of concrete.

~TRANSPORTING MATERIALS TO MIXING BOARDS~--Carrying the sand and stone from stock piles to
mixing board in shovels should never be practiced. It takes from 100 to 150 shovelfuls of stone
to make 1 cu. yd.; it, therefore, costs 50 cts. per cu. yd. to carry it 100 ft. and return
empty handed, for in walking short distances the men travel very slowly--about 150 ft. per
minute. It costs more to walk a half dozen paces with stone carried in shovels than to wheel
it in barrows.

The most common method of transporting materials from stock piles to mixing boards is in wheelbarrows.
The usual wheelbarrow load on a level plank runway is 3 bags of cement (300 lbs) or 3 cu. ft.
of sand or stone. If a steep rise must be overcome to reach the mixing platform the load will
be reduced to 2 bags (200 lbs.) of cement or 2 cu. ft. of sand or stone. A man wheeling a barrow
travels at a rate of 200 ft. per minute, going and coming, and loses ¾ minute each trip dumping
the load, fixing run planks, etc. An active man will do 20 to 25 per cent. more work than this,
while a very lazy man may do 20 per cent. less. With wages at 15 cts. per hour, the cost of
wheeling materials for 1 cu. yd. of concrete may be obtained by the following rule:

To a fixed cost of 4 cts. (for lost time) add 1 ct. for every 20 ft. of distance away from
the stock pile if there is a steep rise in the runway, but if the runway is level, add 1 ct.
for every 30 ft. distance of haul.

Since loading the barrows, as given above, was 16 cts. per cu. yd., the total fixed cost is
16 + 4 = 20 cts. per cu. yd., to which is added 1 ct. for every 20 or 30 ft. haul depending
on the grade of the runway.

The preceding figures assume the use of plank runways for the wheelbarrows. These should never
be omitted, and the barrows wheeled over the ground. Even a hard packed earth path in dry weather
is inferior to a plank runway and when the ground is soft or muddy the loss in efficiency of
the men is serious. Where the runway must rise to the mixing board, give it a slope or grade
seldom steeper than 1 in 8, and if possible flatter. Make a runway on a trestle at least 18
ins. wide, so that men will be in no danger of falling. See to it, also, that the planks are
so well supported that they do not spring down when walked over, for a springy plank makes
hard wheeling. If the planks are so long between the "horses" or "bents" used to support them,
that they spring badly, it is usually a simple matter to nail a cleat across the underside
of the planks and stand an upright strut underneath to support and stiffen the plank.

When two-wheeled carts of the type shown by Fig. 12 are used the runway requires two lines
of planks.

Two-wheeled carts pushed by hand have been less used for handling concrete materials than for
handling concrete, but for distances from 50 to 150 ft. from stock pile to mixing board such
carts are probably cheaper for transporting materials than are wheelbarrows. These carts hold
generally three wheelbarrow loads and they are handled by one man practically as rapidly and
easily as is a wheelbarrow.

For all distances over 50 ft. from stock pile to mixing board, it is cheaper to haul materials
in one-horse dump carts than it is in wheelbarrows. A cart should be loaded in 4 minutes and
dumped in about 1 minute, making 5 minutes lost time each round trip. It should travel at a
speed of not less than 200 ft. per minute, although it is not unusual to see variations of
15 or 20 per cent., one way or another, from this average, depending upon the management of
the work. A one-horse cart will readily carry enough stone and sand to make ½ cu. yd. of concrete,
if the roads are fairly hard and level; and a horse can pull this load up a 10 per cent. (rise
of 1 ft. in 10 ft.) planked roadway provided with cleats to give a foothold. If a horse, cart
and driver can be hired for 30 cts. per hour, the cost of hauling the materials for 1 cu. yd.
of concrete is given by the following rule:

To a fixed cost of 5 cts. (for lost time at both ends of haul) add 1 ct. for every 100 ft.
of distance from stock pile to mixing board.

Where carts are used it is possible to locate the stock piles several hundred feet from the
mixing boards without adding materially to the cost of the concrete. It is well, however, to
have the stock piles in sight of the foreman at the mixing board, so as to insure promptness
of delivery.

~METHODS AND COST OF MIXING.~--In mixing concrete by hand the materials are spread in superimposed
layers on a mixing board and mixed together first dry and then with water by turning them with
shovels or hoes. The number of turns, the relative arrangement of the layers, and the sequence
of operations vary in practice with the notions of the engineer controlling the work. No one
mode of procedure in hand mixing can, therefore, be specified for general application; the
following are representative examples of practice in hand mixing:

Measure the stone in a bottomless box and spread it until its thickness in inches equals its
parts by volume. Measure the sand in a bottomless box set on the stone and spread the sand
evenly over the stone layer. Place the cement on the sand and spread evenly. Turn the material
twice with a square pointed shovel and then turn it a third time while water is gently sprinkled
on. A fourth turn is made to mix thoroughly the water and the concrete is then shoveled into
barrows, giving it a fifth turn. Mr. Ernest McCullough, who gives this method, states that
it is the cheapest way to mix concrete by hand and still secure a good quality of output.

In work done by Mr. H. P. Boardman the sand is measured in a bottomless box and over it is
spread the cement in an even layer. The cement and sand are mixed dry with hoes, the water
is added in pailfuls and the whole mixed to a uniform porridge-like consistency. Into this
thin mortar all the stone for a batch is dumped, the measuring box is lifted and the mixture
turned by shovels. A pair of shovelers, one on each side, is started at one end turning the
material back and working toward the opposite end. A second pair of shovelers takes the turned
material and turns it again. The concrete is then shoveled into the barrows by the wheelers
themselves as fast as it is turned the second time. By this method a good gang of 20 to 25
men, using two boxes, will, Mr. Boardman states, mix and place 45 to 60 cu. yds. of concrete
in 10 hours, depending on the wheelbarrow travel necessary. Assuming a gang of 25 men, this
is a rate of 1.8 to 2.4 cu. yds. per man per 10-hour day, concrete mixed and placed.

A method somewhat similar to the one just outlined is given by Mr. O. K. Morgan. A mixing board
made of 7/8-in. matched boards nailed to 2×3-in. sills is used, with a mixing box about 8 ft.
long, 4 ft. wide and 10 to 12 ins. deep. This box is set alongside the mixing board and in
it the cement and sand are mixed first dry and then wet; a fairly wet mortar is made. Meanwhile
the stone is spread in an even layer 6 ins. thick on the mixing board and thoroughly drenched
with water. The mortar from the mixing box is cast by shovels in a fairly even layer over the
stone and the whole is turned two or three times with shovels, generally two turns are enough.
Six men are employed; two prepare the mortar, while four get the stone in readiness, then all
hands finish the operation.

The following method is given by Mr. E. Sherman Gould: Spread the sand in a thin layer on the
mixing board and over it spread the cement. Mix dry with shovels, using four men, one at each
corner, turning outward and then working back again. Over the dry sand and cement mixture spread
the broken stone which has been previously wetted and on top of the stone apply water evenly.
The water will thus percolate through the stone without splashing and evenly wet the sand and
cement. Finally turn the whole, using the same number of men and the same mode of procedure
as were used in dry mixing the sand and cement. Mr. Gould states that by this method the contractor
should average 2 cu. yds. of mixed concrete per man per 10-hour day.

A novel method of hand mixing and an unusual record of output is described by Maj. H. M. Chittenden,
U. S. A., in connection with the construction of a concrete arch bridge. The mixing was done
by hand on a single board 25 ft. long and sloping slightly from one end to the other. The materials
were dumped together on the upper end of the board. Sixteen men were stationed along the board,
eight on each side. The first two men turned the mixture dry. Next to them stood a man who
applied the water after each shovelful. The next mixers kept turning the material along and
another waterman assisted in wetting it further down the board. The men at the end of the board
shoveled the concrete into the carts which took it to the work. Each batch contained 18 cu.
ft., or 0.644 cu. yd., and the rate of mixing was 10 cu. yds. per hour, or 6.25 cu. yds. per
man per 10-hour day. The work of getting the materials properly proportioned to the mixing
board is not included in this figure, but the loading of the mixed concrete is included.

It is plain from the foregoing, that specifications for hand mixing should always state the
method to be followed, and particularly the number of turns necessary. If these matters are
not specified the contractor has to guess at the probable requirements of the engineer. The
authors have known of inspectors demanding from 6 to 9 turns of the materials when specifications
were ambiguous. It should also be made clear whether or not the final shoveling into the barrows
or carts constitutes a turn, and whether any subsequent shoveling of the concrete into place
constitutes a turn. Inspectors and foremen have frequent disputes over these questions.

Estimates of the cost of hand mixing may usually be figured upon the number of times that the
materials are to be turned by shovels. A contractor is seldom required to turn the sand and
cement more than three times dry and three times wet, and then turn the mortar and stone three
times. A willing workman, under a good foreman, will turn over mortar at the rate of 30 cu.
yds. in 10 hours, lifting each shovelful and casting it into a pile. With wages at $1.50 and
six turns, this means a cost of 5 cts. per cubic yard of mortar for each turn; as there is
seldom more than 0.4 cu. yd. of mortar in a cubic yard of concrete, we have a cost of 2 cts.
per cubic yard of concrete for each turn that is given the mortar. So if the mortar is given
six turns before the stone is added and then the stone and mortar are mixed by three turns
we have: (2 cts. × 6) + (5 cts. × 3) = 12 + 15 = 27 cts. per cubic yard for mixing concrete.
In pavement foundation work two turns of the mortar followed by two turns of the mortar and
stone are considered sufficient. The cost of mixing per cubic yard of concrete is then (2 cts.
× 2) + (5 cts. × 2) = 4 + 10 = 14 cts. per cubic yard of concrete. One specification known
to the authors, requires six turns dry and three turns wet for the mortar; under such specifications
the cost of mixing the mortar would be 50 per cent. higher than in the first example assumed.
On the other hand, they have seen concrete mixed for street pavement foundation with only three
turns before shoveling it into place. These costs of mixing apply to work done by diligent
men; easy going men will make the cost 25 to 50 per cent greater.

~LOADING AND HAULING MIXED CONCRETE.~--Wheelbarrows and carts are employed to haul the mixed
concrete to the work. The loading of these with mixed concrete by shoveling costs less than
the loading of the materials separately before mixing. While the weight is greater because
of the added water the volume of the concrete is much less than that of the ingredients before
mixing. Again the shoveling is done off a smooth board with the added advantage of having the
material lubricated and, finally, the foreman is usually at this point to crowd the work. A
good worker will load 12½ cu. yds. of concrete per 10-hour day, and with wages at $1.50 per
day this would give a cost of 12 cts. per cu. yd. for loading.

Practically the same principles govern the transporting of concrete in barrows as govern the
handling of the raw materials in them. The cost of wheeling concrete is practically the same
as for wheeling the dry ingredients, so that the total cost of loading and wheeling may be
estimated by the following rule:

To a fixed cost of 16 cts. for loading and lost time add 1 ct. for every 30 ft. of level haul.

Within a few years wheelbarrows have been supplanted to a considerable extent by hand carts
of the general type shown by Fig. 12, which illustrates one made by the Ransome Concrete Machinery
Co. The bowl of this cart has a capacity of 6 cu. ft. water measure. It is hung on a 1¼-in.
steel axle; the wheels are 42 ins. in diameter with staggered spokes and 2-in. half oval tires.
The top of the bowl is 29½ ins. from the ground. Owing to the large diameter of the wheels
and the fact that no weight comes on the wheeler, as with a wheelbarrow, this cart is handled
by one man about as rapidly and easily as is a wheelbarrow. It will be noted that the two ends
of the bowl differ in shape; the handle is removable and can be attached to either end of the
bowl. With the handle attached as shown the bowl can be inverted for discharging onto a pavement
or floor; with the handle transferred to the opposite end the bowl is fitted for dumping into
narrow beam or wall forms. The maximum load of wet concrete for a wheelbarrow is 2 cu. ft.,
and this is a heavy load and one that is seldom averaged--1 to 1½ cu. ft. is more nearly the
general average. A cart of the above type will, therefore, carry from 3 to 5 wheelbarrow loads,
and on good runways, which are essential, may be pushed and dumped about as rapidly as a wheelbarrow.
In succeeding pages are given records of actual work with hand carts which should be studied
in this connection.

Portland cement concrete can be hauled a considerable distance in a dump cart or wagon before
it begins to harden; natural cement sets too quickly to permit of its being hauled far. Portland
cement does not begin to set in less than 30 minutes. On a good road, with no long, steep hills
a team will haul a loaded wagon at a speed of about 200 ft. per minute; it, therefore, takes
6½ minutes to travel a quarter of a mile, 13 minutes to travel half a mile, and 26 minutes
to travel a mile. Portland cement concrete can, therefore, be hauled a mile before it begins
to set. The cost of hauling concrete in carts is about the same as the cost of hauling the
raw materials as given in a preceding section.

When hand mixing is employed in building piers, abutments, walls, etc., the concrete often
has to be hoisted as well as wheeled. A gallows frame or a mast with a pulley block at the
top and a team of horses can often be used in such cases as described in Chapter XII for filling
cylinder piers, or in the same chapter for constructing a bridge abutment. It is also possible
often to locate the mixing board on high ground, perhaps at some little distance from the forms.
If this can be done, the use of derricks may be avoided as above suggested or by building a
light pole trestle from the mixing board to the forms. The concrete can then be wheeled in
barrows and dumped into the forms. If the mixing board can be located on ground as high as
the top of the concrete structure is to be, obviously a trestle will enable the men to wheel
on a level runway. Such a trestle can be built very cheaply, especially where second-hand lumber,
or lumber that can be used subsequently for forms is available. A pole trestle whose bents
are made entirely of round sticks cut from the forest is a very cheap structure, if a foreman
knows how to throw it together and up-end the bents after they are made. One of the authors
has put up such trestles for 25 cts. per lineal foot of trestle, including all labor of cutting
the round timber, erecting it, and placing a plank flooring 4 ft. wide on top. The stringers
and flooring plank were used later for forms, and their cost is not included. A trestle 100
ft. long can thus be built at less cost than hauling, erecting and taking down a derrick; and
once the trestle is up it saves the cost of operating a derrick.

In conclusion, it should be remarked that the comparative economy for concrete work of the
different methods of haulage described, does not depend wholly on the comparative transportation
costs; the effect of the method of haulage on the cost of dumping and spreading costs must
be considered. For example, if carts deliver the material in such form that the cost of spreading
is greatly increased over what it would be were the concrete delivered in wheelbarrows, the
gain made by cart haulage may be easily wiped out or even turned into loss by the extra spreading
charges. These matters are considered more at length in the succeeding section.

~DUMPING, SPREADING AND RAMMING.~--The cost of dumping wheelbarrows and carts is included in
the rules of cost already given, excepting that in some cases it is necessary to add the wages
of a man at the dump who assists the cart drivers or the barrow men. Thus in dumping concrete
from barrows into a deep trench or pit, it is usually advisable to dump into a galvanized iron
hopper provided with an iron pipe chute. One man can readily dump all the barrows that can
be filled from a concrete mixer in a day, say 150 cu. yds. At this rate of output the cost
of dumping would be only 1 ct. per cu. yd., but if one man were required to dump the output
of a small gang of men, say 25 cu. yds., the cost of dumping would be 6 cts. per cu. yd.

Concrete dumped through a chute requires very little work to spread it in 6-in. layers; and,
in fact, concrete that can be dumped from wheelbarrows, which do not all dump in one place,
can be spread very cheaply; for not more than half the pile dumped from the barrow needs to
be moved, and then moved merely by pushing with a shovel. Since the spreader also rams the
concrete, it is difficult to separate these two items. As nearly as the authors have been able
to estimate this item of spreading "dry" concrete dumped from wheelbarrows in street paving
work, the cost is 5 cts. per cu. yd. If, on the other hand, nearly all the concrete must be
handled by the spreaders, as in spreading concrete dumped from carts, the cost is fully double,
or 10 cts. per cu. yd. And if the spreader has to walk even 3 or 4 paces to place the concrete
after shoveling it up, the cost of spreading will be 15 cts. per cu. yd. For this reason it
is apparent that carts are not as economical as wheelbarrows for hauling concrete up to about
200 ft., due to the added cost of spreading material delivered by carts.

The preceding discussion of spreading is based upon the assumption that the concrete is not
so wet that it will run. Obviously where concrete is made of small stones and contains an excess
of water, it will run so readily as to require little or no spreading.

The cost of ramming concrete depends almost entirely upon its dryness and upon the number of
cubic yards delivered to the rammers. Concrete that is mixed with very little water requires
long and hard ramming to flush the water to the surface. The yardage delivered to the rammers
is another factor, because if only a few men are engaged in mixing they will not be able to
deliver enough concrete to keep the rammers properly busy, yet the rammers by slow though continuous
pounding may be keeping up an appearance of working. Then, again, it has been noticed that
the slower the concrete is delivered the more particular the average inspector becomes. Concrete
made "sloppy" requires no ramming at all, and very little spading. The authors have had men
do very thorough ramming of moderately dry concrete for 15 cts. per cu. yd., where the rammers
had no spreading to do, the material being delivered in shovels. It is rare indeed that spreading
and ramming can be made to cost more than 40 cts. per cu. yd., under the most foolish inspection,
yet one instance is recorded which, because of its rarity, is worth noting: Mr. Herman Conrow
is the authority for the data: 1 foreman, 9 men mixing, 1 ramming, averaged 15 cu. yds. a day,
or only 1½ cu. yds. per man per day, when laying wet concrete. When laying dry concrete the
same gang averaged only 8 cu. yds. a day, there being 4 men ramming. With foreman at $2 and
laborers at $1.50 a day, the cost was $2.12 per cu. yd. for labor on the dry concrete as against
$1.13 per cu. yd. for the wet concrete. Three turnings of the stone with a wet mortar effected
a better mixture than four turnings with a dry mortar. The ramming of the wet concrete cost
10 cts. per cu. yd., whereas the ramming of the dry concrete cost 75 cts. per cu. yd. The authors
think this is the highest cost on record for ramming. It is evident, however, that the men
were under a poor foreman, for an output of only 15 cu. yds. per day with 10 men is very low
for ordinary conditions. Moreover, the expensive amount of ramming indicates either poor management
or the most foolish inspection requirements.

In conclusion it may be noted that if engineers specify a dry concrete and "thorough ramming,"
they would do well also to specify what the word "thorough" is to mean, using language that
can be expressed in cents per cubic yard. It is a common thing, for example, to see a sewer
trench specification in which one tamper is required for each two men shoveling the back-fill
into the trench; and some such specific requirement should be made in a concrete specification
if close estimates from reliable contractors are desired. Surely no engineer will claim that
this is too unimportant a matter for consideration when it is known that ramming can easily
be made to cost as high as 40 cts. per cu. yd., depending largely upon the whim of the inspector.

~THE COST OF SUPERINTENDENCE.~--This item is obviously dependent upon the yardage of concrete
handled under one foreman and the daily wages of the foreman. If a foreman receives $3 a day
and is bossing a job where only 12 cu. yds. are placed daily, we have a cost of 25 cts. per
cu. yd. for superintendence. If the same foreman is handling a gang of 20 men whose output
is 50 cu. yds., the superintendence item is only 6 cts. per cu. yd. If the same foreman is
handling a concrete-mixing plant having a daily output of 150 cu. yds., the cost of superintendence
is but 2 cts. per cu. yd. These elementary examples have been given simply because figures
are more impressive than generalities, and because it is so common a sight to see money wasted
by running too small a gang of men under one foreman.

Of all classes of contract work, none is more readily estimated day by day than concrete work,
not only because it is usually built in regular shapes whose volumes are easily ascertained
at the end of each day, but because a record of the bags, or barrels, or batches gives a ready
method of computing the output of each gang. For this reason small gangs of concrete workers
need no foreman at all, provided one of the workers is given command and required to keep tally
of the batches. If the efficiency of a gang of 6 men were to fall off, say, 15 per cent., by
virtue of having no regular non-working foreman in charge, the loss would be only $1.35 a day--a
loss that would be more than counterbalanced by the saving of a foreman's wages. Indeed, the
efficiency of a gang of 6 men would have to fall off 25 per cent., or more, before it would
pay to put a foreman in charge. In many cases the efficiency will not fall off at all, provided
the gang knows that its daily progress is being recorded, and that prompt discharge will follow
laziness. Indeed, one of the authors has more than once had the efficiency increased by leaving
a small gang to themselves in command of one of the workers who was required to punch a hole
in a card for every batch.

To reduce the cost of superintendence there is no surer method than to work two gangs of 18
to 20 men, side by side, each gang under a separate foreman who is striving to make a better
showing than his competitor. This is done with marked advantage in street paving, and could
be done elsewhere oftener than it is.

In addition to the cost of a foreman in direct charge of the laborers, there is always a percentage
of the cost of general superintendence and office expenses to be added. In some cases a general
superintendent is put in charge of one or two foremen; and, if he is a high-salaried man, the
cost of superintendence becomes a very appreciable item.

~SUMMARY OF COSTS.~--Having thus analyzed the costs of making and placing concrete, we can
understand why it is that printed records of costs vary so greatly. Moreover, we are enabled
to estimate the labor cost with far more accuracy than we can guess it; for by studying the
requirements of the specifications, and the local conditions governing the placing of stock
piles, mixing boards, etc., we can estimate each item with considerable accuracy. The purpose,
however, has not been solely to show how to predict the labor cost, but also to indicate to
contractors and their foremen some of the many possibilities of reducing the cost of work once
the contract has been secured. An analysis of costs, such as above given, is the most effective
way of discovering unnecessary "leaks," and of opening one's eyes to the possibilities of effecting
economies in any given case.

To indicate the method of summarizing the costs of making concrete by hand, let us assume that
the concrete is to be put into a deep foundation requiring wheeling a distance of 30 ft.; that
the stock piles are on plank 60 ft. distant from the mixing board; that the specifications
call for 6 turns of gravel concrete thoroughly rammed in 6-in. layers; and that a good sized
gang of, say, 16 men (at $1.50 a day each), is to work under a foreman receiving $2.70 a day.
We then have the following summary by applying the rules already given:

                                                Per cu. yd.
                                                concrete.
Loading sand, stone and cement                    $ .17
Wheeling 60 ft. in barrows (4 + 2 cts.)             .06
Mixing concrete, 6 turns at 5 cts.                  .30
Wheeling 30 ft. (4 + 1 ct.)                         .05
Dumping barrows (1 man helping barrowman)           .05
Spreading and heavy ramming                         .15
                                                 ------
Total cost of labor                                $.90
Foreman, at $2.70 a day                             .10
                                                 ------
Grand total                                       $1.00

To estimate the daily output of this gang of 16 laborers proceed thus: Divide the daily wages
of all the 16 men, expressed in cents, by the labor cost of the concrete in cents, the quotient
will be the cubic yards output of the gang. Thus, 2,400 ÷ 90 is 27 cu. yds., in this case.

In street paving work where no man is needed to help dump the wheelbarrows, and where it is
usually possible to shovel concrete direct from the mixing board into place, and where half
as much ramming as above assumed is usually satisfactory, we see that the last four labor items
instead of amounting to 12 + 5 + 5 + 15, or 37 cts., amount only to one-half of the last item,
one-half of 15 cts., or 7½ cts. This makes the total labor cost only 60 cts. instead of 90
cts. If we divide 2,400 cts. (the total day's wages of 16 men) by 60 cts. (the labor cost per
cu. yd.), we have 40, which is the cubic yards output of the 16 men. This greater output of
the 16 men reduces the cost of superintendence to 7 cts. per cu. yd.

The making and placing of concrete is virtually a manufacturing process. This process as performed
by manual labor is discussed in the preceding chapter; it will be discussed here as it is performed
by machinery. The objects sought in using machinery for making and placing concrete are: (1)
The securing of a more perfectly mixed and uniform concrete, and (2) the securing of a cheaper
cost of concrete in place. As in every other manufacturing process both objects cannot be obtained
to the highest degree without co-ordinate and universal efficiency throughout in plant and
methods. For example, the substitution of machine mixing for hand mixing will not alone ensure
cheaper concrete. If all materials are delivered to the machine in wheelbarrows and if the
concrete is conveyed away in wheelbarrows, the cost of making concrete even with machine mixers
is high. On the other hand, where the materials are fed from bins by gravity into the mixer
and when the mixed concrete is hauled away in cars, the cost of making the concrete may be
very low. Making and placing concrete by machinery involves not one but several mechanical
operations working in conjunction--in a word, a concrete making plant is required.

The mechanical equipment of a concrete making plant has four duties to perform. (1) It has
to transport the raw materials from the cars or boats or pits and place them in the stock piles
or storage bins; (2) it has to take the raw materials from stock and charge them to the mixer;
(3) it has to mix the raw materials into concrete and discharge the mixture into transportable
vehicles; and (4) it has to transport these vehicles from the mixer to the work and discharge
them. As all these operations are interrelated component parts of one great process, it is
plain why one operation cannot lag without causing all the other operations to slow up.

The mechanical devices which may be used for each of these operations are various, and they
may be combined in various ways to make the complete train of machinery necessary to the complete
process. In this chapter we shall describe the character and qualities of each type of devices
separately. The practicable ways of combining them to form a complete concrete making plant
are best illustrated by descriptions and records of work of actual plants, and such descriptions
and records for each class of structure considered in this book are given in the following
chapters and may be found by consulting the index. In describing the various machines and devices
we have made one classification for those used in handling raw materials and mixed concrete,
for the reason that nearly all of them are suitable for either purpose.

~UNLOADING WITH GRAB BUCKETS.~--The orange-peel or clam-shell bucket is an excellent device
for unloading sand or stone from cars or barges. The cost of unloading, including cleaning
up the portions not reached by the bucket, is not more than from 2 to 5 cts. per cu. yd. A
grab bucket of either of these types can be applied to any derrick. In unloading broken stone
from barges at Ossining, N. Y., a Hayward clam-shell on a stiff-leg derrick unloaded 100 cu.
yds. of broken stone per day from barge into wagons, with one engineman and one helper. In
addition to the bucket work there was 24 hours' labor cleaning on each 500-cu. yd. barge load.
The labor cost of unloading a 500-cu. yd. barge was as follows:

                                     Per Cu. Yd.
One engineman, at $2.50                 2.5 cts.
One helper, at $1.50                    1.5 cts.
Labor cleaning, at $1.50                0.7 cts.
                                        --------
Total cost per cubic yard               4.7 cts.

~INCLINES.~--Inclines to reach the tops of mixer and storage bins and the level of concrete
work can be operated on about the following grades: For teams hauling wagons or cars, 2 per
cent. maximum grade. A single heavy team will haul a 5-cu. yd. car, with ordinary bearings,
weighing 2½ tons empty and 12 tons loaded, with ease on a 1½ per cent. grade, and with some
difficulty on a 2 per cent. grade. A locomotive will handle cars on a grade of from 4 to 5
per cent. For team haulage 20-lb. rails may be used, and for locomotives 30-lb. rails. Grades
steeper than about 5 per cent. require cable haulage.

~TRESTLE AND CAR PLANTS.~--Trestle and car plants for handling both concrete materials and
mixed concrete have a wide range of application and numerous examples of such plants are described
in succeeding chapters, and are noted in the index at the end of the book. The following estimates
of the cost of a trestle and car plant are given by Mr. Wm. G. Fargo. The work is assumed to
cover an area of 100×200 ft. and to have three-fourths of its bulk below the economical elevation
of the mixer, which stands within 50 ft. of the near side of the work. If the work is under
3,000 cu. yds. in bulk and there is a reasonable time limit for completion one mixer of 200
cu. yds. capacity per 10-hour day is assumed to be sufficient. The items of car plant cost
will be about as follows:

150 ft. trestle, at $1.50                               $225
5 split switches with spring bridles, at $18              90
2 iron turntables, at $30                                 60
3-2/3 cu. yd. steel cars with roller bearings            190
                                                      ------
Total                                                   $565

The trestle assumed is double 24-in. gage track, 6 ft. on centers; stringers 6×8 ins.×22 to
24 ft.; ties 2×6 ins., 2½ ft. on centers; running boards 2×12 ins. for each track, and 12-lb.
rails; trestle legs, average length 30 ft., of green poles at 5 cts. per foot. This outfit
with repairs and renewals amounting to 10 per cent., is considered good for five season's work
and the timber work for several jobs if not too far apart. The yearly rental on the basis of
five seasons' work would be $124.30, or $1 per working day for a season of five months. Three
cars delivering ½ cu. yd. batches can deliver 200 cu. yds. of concrete, an average of 100 ft.
from the mixer in 10 hours. Five men, including a man tending switches and turntable and one
man to help dump, can operate the plant. With wages at $1.75 per day the labor cost of handling
200 cu. yds. of concrete would be 4-1/8 cts. per cu. yd.

~CABLEWAYS.~--Cableways arranged to span the work and if the area is wide to travel across
the work at right angles to the span will handle concrete, concrete materials, forms, steel
and supplies with great economy. They are particularly suitable for bridge and dam work, filter
and reservoir work, building foundations and low buildings. The arrangement of a cableway plant
for bridge work is described in Chapter XVII. A cableway of 800 ft. clear span on fixed towers
45 ft. high will cost complete from $4,500 to $5,000, and will handle 200 cu. yds. of concrete
per 10-hour day. To put the cableway on traveling towers will cost about $1,000 more. In constructing
the Pittsburg filtration work four traveling cableways from 250 to 600 ft. span were used.
The towers were from 50 to 60 ft. in height and each traveled on a 5-rail track. The cableways
were self-propelling. With conditions favorable each cableway delivered 300 cu. yds. of concrete
per day. A cableway plant for heavy fortification work is described in Chapter XI.

~BELT CONVEYORS.~--Belt conveyors may be used successfully for handling both concrete materials
and mixed concrete. For handling wet concrete the slope must be quite flat, and the belt must
be provided with some means of cleaning off the sticky mortar paste. In several cases rotating
brushes stationed at the end of the belt, where it turns over the tail pulley, have worked
successfully; these brushes sweep the belt clean. Except for the cleaning device the ordinary
arrangement of belt conveyor for dry materials serves for concrete.

In constructing a large gas works at Astoria, Long Island, near New York city, belt conveyors
were used to handle both the sand, gravel and cement bags and the mixed concrete. The belt
for handling sand and gravel is shown by Fig. 13. A derrick operating a clam-shell unloaded
the sand and gravel into a small hopper, discharging into dump cars operated by a "dinky" up
an incline, passing over sand and gravel storage bins. A 20-in. belt conveyor ran horizontally
105 ft. under the bins, then up an incline of 3.4 ft. in 125 ft. to feeding hoppers over the
mixers. This conveyor received alternately sand and gravel by chute from the storage bins and
bags of cement loaded by hand, and carried them to the feeding bins and mixer platform. The
speed of the belt was 350 ft. per minute, and it required 6 h.p. to operate it when carrying
100 tons per hour. The mixing was done in two Smith mixers, which turned out 70 cu. yds. or
35 cu. yds. each per hour. The mixed concrete was delivered onto a 50-ft. 24-in. belt conveyor
traveling at a speed of 400 ft. per minute and dumping through a chute into cars. Only 1 h.p.
was required to run the concrete conveyor. A rotating brush was used to keep the belt clean
at the dumping end. It will be noted that only a small amount of power is required for operation.

~CHUTES.~--Chutes of wood or iron are among the simplest and most efficient means of moving
the cement, sand and stone and the mixed concrete when the ground levels permit such devices.

Bags of cement if given a start in casting will slide down a steel or very smooth wooden chute
with a slope of 1 ft. in 5 or 6 ft. A wooden trough 12 ins. deep and 24 ins. wide with boards
dressed on the inside may be used. When the inclination is steep and the fall is great, some
device is necessary to diminish the velocity of descent; the following is an example of such
a device which was successfully employed in a chute of the above dimensions, 400 ft. long and
having a drop of 110 ft. This chute had a maximum inclination of 45° and its lower end curved
to a horizontal tangent, running into the storehouse. Near the bottom of the chute a horizontal
strip was nailed across the upper edges and to it was nailed the upper end of a 20 ft., 1×12-in.
board, the lower end of which rested on the bottom of the chute. Several pieces of timber spiked
to the upper side loaded the lower end of this board. The cement bag in descending wedged itself
into the angle between the chute and the board and lifted the latter, the spring of the board
and the weight at the lower end offering enough resistance to cut down the velocity. After
the chute had been in use for some time and had worn smooth it was found necessary to add two
more brakes to check the bags.

Broken stone will slide down a steel or steel lined chute with a slope of 1 in 3 or 4 ft. if
given a start in casting. Damp sand will not slide down a chute with a slope of 1½ in 1.

A wet cement grout will flow down a smooth plank chute, with a slope of 1 in 4 ft., and wet
concrete will move on the same slope; comparatively dry concrete requires a slope of nearly
1 in 1, or 45°, to secure free movement. Mr. W. J. Douglas gives the following examples of
conveying concrete by chute, prefaced by the statement that his experience indicates that concrete
can thus be conveyed considerable distances without material injury if proper precautions are
taken.

In the first case a semi-circular steel trough about 2 ft. wide and 1 ft. deep and 15 ft. long
set on a slope of 45° was used. A lift gate of sheet steel was set in the chute about 2 ft.
from the upper end. The concrete was allowed to accumulate behind this gate until a wheelbarrow
load was had, when the batch was let loose by lifting the gate and was discharged into barrows
at the bottom. In another case a vertical chute 15 ft. long, consisting of a 15-in. square
box with a canvas end, was used. The concrete was dumped into the chute in batches of about
8 cu. ft.; two men at the bottom "cut down" the pile with hoes to keep it from coning and causing
separation of the stone. In a third case a continuous mixer fed into a sheet iron lined rectangular
chute about 2½ ft. wide and 1 ft. deep, with a vertical drop of 60 ft. on a slope of 1 in 1,
or 45°. A gate was fixed in the chute 2 ft. from the top and at the bottom the chute fed into
a pyramidal hopper 3 ft. square at the top, 1 ft. square at the bottom and 4½ ft. deep. This
hopper was provided with a bottom gate and was set on legs so that its top was about 10 ft.
above ground. As the concrete filled in the hopper was raised and the chute cut off. The hopper
was kept full all the time and was discharged by bottom gate and spout into wheelbarrows. In
a fourth case the apparatus shown by the sketch, Fig. 14, was used. The continuous mixer discharged
onto an 18-in. rubber conveyor belt on conical rollers and 18 ft. long. The inner end of the
conveyor frame was carried on the ground at the edge of the pit and the outer end was supported
by ropes from the top of a gallows frame standing on the pit bottom. The belt discharged over
end into a vertical steel chute 12 ins. in diameter and 8 ft. long; this chute was fastened
to the conveyor frame. Encircling and overlapping the 12-in. chute was a second slightly larger
chute suspended by means of two ropes from the gallows frame. The bottom of this second chute
was kept about 6 ins. below the top edges of a pyramidal hopper like the one described above.
In operation the chutes and the hopper were kept filled with concrete so that the only drop
of the concrete was 3 ft. from the conveyor belt into the topmost chute.

Concrete may be handled in long flat chutes by stationing men along the chute with shovels
which they work like paddles to keep the mixture moving. In one case concrete was so handled
in a chute 200 ft. long having a slope of 1 in 10 ft. The chute was a V-shaped trough made
of 1×12-in. boards in sections 16 ft. long. The men paddling were stationed 10 ft. apart, so
that with wages at $1.50 per day the cost would be 1½ cts. per cu. yd. for every 10 ft. the
concrete was conveyed. In connection with this particular work we are informed that a Eureka
continuous mixer was used. The gravel was dumped near the mixer and a team hitched to a drag
scraper delivered the gravel alongside the mixer. Four men shoveled the gravel into the measuring
hopper, but only two men worked at a time, shoveling for a period of 15 minutes and then resting
for a corresponding period while the other two men worked. In this manner the four men shoveled
enough gravel to make 100 cu. yds. of concrete per day. A fifth man opened the cement bags
and kept the cement hopper filled.

~METHODS OF CHARGING MIXERS.~--By charging is meant the process of delivering raw materials
from stock into the mixer. Several methods are practiced and will be considered in the following
order: (1) By gravity from overhead bins; (2) by wheelbarrow or hand cart (a) to charging chute
and (b) to elevating charging hoppers; (3) by charging cars operated by cable or other means;
(4) by shoveling directly into mixer; (5) by derricks or other hoists.

~Charging by Gravity from Overhead Bins.~--Chuting the sand and stone from overhead bins to
the charging hopper is a simple, rapid and economical method of charging mixers. The bottoms
of the bins should always be high enough above the charging floor to give ample head room for
men to move about erect, and the length of chute may be anything reasonable more than this
that conditions such as the side hill delivery of material may necessitate. When the mixer
is located to one side of the bins the slope of the chute will have to be watched. Broken stone
or pebbles will move on a comparatively flat slope but sand, particularly if damp, requires
a steep chute. The measuring hopper is best kept entirely independent of the mixer so that
it can be filled with a new charge while the mixer is turning and discharging the preceding
batch. One man can attend the sand and cement chutes if they be conveniently arranged, and
one man can open and empty the cement bags if they be stacked close at hand. A third man will
level off the sand and stone in the measuring hopper and help in the chuting. A gang of this
size will easily measure up a charge every 2 minutes when no delays occur.

A number of plants charging by gravity from overhead bins are described in succeeding chapters
and are referenced in the index. As a general example a side hill plant of conventional construction
is shown by Fig. 15. The trestle work was made of 12×12-in. timbers and was approximately 40
ft. in height. Three tracks occupy the top platform. Under each track was a material bin; one
on each side for gravel and a middle bin for sand. The sand bin was divided by a partition
into two compartments. These bins discharged into two measuring hoppers one gravel bin and
one compartment of the sand bin into each hopper. Two cement chutes from the top platform provided
for the delivery of the cement to the mixers, either directly from cars or from the cement
storage house. The mixing was done in two Smith No. 5 mixers, one under each measuring hopper,
and these mixers discharged by chutes into buckets on flat cars. Thus the concrete materials
brought directly from a siding in car load lots to the top of the platform were handled entirely
by gravity to the cars delivering the mixed concrete to the work. The gang operating the mixing
plant, with the wages paid, was composed as follows: 1 foreman and engineer at $3 per day,
1 fireman at $2 per day and 15 laborers at $1.50 per day. With this gang the two mixers turned
out 400 cu. yds. of concrete per day and, frequently, 800 cu. yds. in 24 hours. Taking these
figures the labor cost from raw materials in cars on the platform to mixed concrete in cars
on the delivery track was as follows:

1 foreman and engineer at $3            $ 3.00
1 fireman at $2                           2.00
15 laborers at $1.50                     22.50
                                         -----
Total labor                             $27.50

Assuming 400 cu. yds. output, this gives a cost of $27.50 ÷ 400 = 6.875 cts. per cu. yd.

~Charging with Wheelbarrows.~--The economics of wheelbarrow haulage are discussed in some detail
in Chapter III. For machine mixer work the problem of loading, transporting and dumping is
complicated by the greater rapidity with which the mixing is done and by the necessity, usually,
of using inclines to reach the charging hopper level. The incline cuts down the output of the
wheelers or in other words makes necessary a larger gang to handle the same amount of material.
Conditions being the same, the height of the charging chute of the mixer determines the height
of incline and the size of the charging gang, so that a mixer with a high charging level costs
more to charge with wheelbarrows than does one with a low charging level. Exact figures of
the increased cost of a few feet extra elevation of the wheelbarrow incline are not available,
but some idea may be had from a brief calculation. The materials for a cubic yard of concrete
will weigh about 3,700 lbs., so that to raise the materials for 100 cu. yds. of concrete, including
weight of barrows, 1 ft. calls for about 400,000 ft. lbs. of work. A man will do about 800,000
ft. lbs. of useful work in a day, so that each foot of additional height of incline means an
additional half-day's work for one man.

Wheeling to elevating charging hoppers obviates the use of inclines. Figure 19 shows a mixer
equipped with such a hopper, and the arrangement provided for other makes of mixer is much
similar. When the hopper is lowered ready to receive its load its top edge over which the wheelbarrows
are dumped is from 12 to 14 ins. above ground level. The wheeling is all done on the level.
The elevating bucket is operated by the mixer engine and is usually detachable. Where mixers
have to be moved frequently, requiring the erection and moving of the incline each time, an
elevating charging hopper is particularly useful; it can be hoisted clear of the ground and
moved with the mixer, so that it is ready to use the moment that the mixer is set at its new
station.

While the ordinary wheelbarrow is generally used for charging, better work can be done under
some conditions by using special charging barrows of larger capacity and dumping from the end
and ahead of the wheel. Two forms of charging barrow are shown by Figs. 16 and 17. The Acme
barrow will hold 4 cu. ft. and the Ransome barrow is made in 3 to 6 cu. ft. capacities. Where
inclines are necessary these barrows can often be hauled up the incline by power. A sprocket
chain in the plane of the incline and operated by the mixer engine is an excellent arrangement.
A prong riveted to the rear face of the barrow and projecting downward is "caught into" the
chain, which pulls the barrow to the top, the man following to dump and return for another load.

~Charging with Cars.~--Cars moved by cable, team or hand are a particularly economic charging
device when the mixer is located a little distance from the stock piles or bins. Either separate
cars for cement, sand and stone, each holding the proper amount of its material for a batch,
can be used, or a single car containing enough of all three materials for a batch. The last
arrangement is ordinarily more economical in time and labor, and in plant required. In either
case the car serves as the measuring hopper, there being no further proportioning of the materials
after they have been loaded into the car, and it must be arranged for measuring. Usually all
that is necessary, where one car is used, is to mark the levels on the sides to which it is
to be filled with sand and then stone; the car is run to the sand stock and filled to the level
marked for sand and then to the stone stock and filled to the level marked for stone. The cement
may be added to the charge either before or after it is run to the mixer as convenience in
storing the cement stock dictates. Instead of having marks to show the proper proportions of
sand and stone, the car is sometimes divided into two compartments, one for each material and
each holding the proper proportion of its material when level full. This arrangement makes
proper proportioning somewhat more certain, since the men charging the car cannot over-run
the marks. In case separate cars are used for each material, they are simply filled level full
or to mark, and dumped in succession into the feeding hopper. Trestle and car plant construction
and costs are given in a preceding section.

~Charging by Shoveling.~--Charging by shoveling directly into the mixer is seldom practiced
except in street work with continuous mixers or in charging gravity mixers of the trough type.
Shoveling is not an economic method of handling materials where the work involves carrying
in shovels, and it is only in a few classes of concrete work or in isolated, exceptional cases
that charging with shovels does not involve carrying. The amount of material that men will
load with shovels is given in Chapter III, and the reader who wishes a full discussion of the
subject is referred to Gillette and Hauer, "Earth Excavation and Embankments; Methods and Cost."

In charging continuous mixers with shovels the usual practice for mixers without automatic
feed devices is to work from a continuous stock pile of sand, stone and cement spread in layers
in the proper proportions. The shoveling is done in such a manner that each shovelful contains
a mixture of cement, sand and stone, and so that the rate of delivery to the mixer is as uniform
as possible. In charging mixers having automatic feed devices the sand and stone are simply
shoveled into the sand and stone hoppers, whence they are fed automatically to the mixer. In
charging gravity mixers by shoveling the method is essentially the same; the cement, sand and
stone properly proportioned are spread in layers on the shoveling board at the head of the
mixer and the mixture then shoveled into the mixer. In both of these cases mixing is performed
to a certain extent by the shoveling, and in both the provision of the combination stock pile
from which the men work involves labor which comes within the meaning of the term charging
as we have used it here. Examples of street work in which the mixers were charged by shoveling
are given in Chapter XIV.

~Charging with Derricks.~--When the stock piles are located close to the mixer and the plant
is fixed or is not frequently moved derricks can be used economically for charging, particularly
if the mixer be elevated so that inclines become expensive. The following mode of operation
will be found to work well: Set the derrick so that its boom "covers" the sand and stone piles
and the mixer, and provide it with three buckets so that there will always be one bucket at
the stone pile and another at the sand pile while the third is being handled. The derrick swinging
from the mixer, where it has discharged a bucket, drops the empty bucket at the stone pile
and picks up the bucket standing there, which has received its proper charge of stone, and
swings it to the sand pile and drops it to get its charge of sand. Here it picks up the bucket
standing at the sand pile and which has its charges of both stone and sand, and swings it to
the mixer. By this arrangement the work of the derrick and of the men filling the buckets is
practically continuous. The buckets can be provided with marks on the inside to show the proper
points to which to fill the stone and the sand or a partition may be riveted in making a compartment
for sand and another for stone. A special charging-bucket that is arranged with a wheel and
detachable handles which permit it to be handled like a wheelbarrow is shown by Fig. 18. This
bucket can be used to advantage where the stock piles are too far from the mixer for the derrick
to reach both, the bucket being loaded and wheeled to within reach of the derrick.

~TYPES OF MIXERS.~--There are two types of concrete mixing machines or concrete mixers as they
are more commonly called: (1) Batch mixers and (2) continuous mixers. In mixers of the first
type a charge of cement, sand, aggregate and water is put into the machine which mixes and
discharges the batch before taking in another charge; charging, mixing and discharging is done
in batches. In continuous mixers the cement sand, stone and water are charged into the machine
in a continuous stream and the mixed concrete is discharged in another continuous stream. While
all concrete mixers are either batch or continuous mixers, it is common practice because of
their distinctive character to separate gravity mixers, whether batch or continuous, into a
third type. In gravity mixers the concrete materials are made to mingle by falling through
specially constructed troughs, or tubes, or hoppers. We shall describe mixers in this chapter
as (1) batch mixers, (2) continuous mixers, and (3) gravity mixers. No attempt will be made,
however, to describe all or even all the leading mixers of each type; a representative mixer
or two of each type will be described, enough to give an indication of the range of practice,
and the reader referred to manufacturers' literature for further information.

~Batch Mixers.~--Batch mixers are made in two principal forms which may be designated as tilting
and non-tilting mixers. In the first form the mixer drum is tilted as one would tilt a bucket
of water to discharge the batch. In non-tilting mixers the mixer drum remains in one position,
the batch being discharged by special mechanism which dips it out a portion at a time. In both
forms the charge is put into the mixer as a unit and kept confined as a unit during the time
of mixing, which may be any period wished by the operator.

Chicago Improved Cube Tilting Mixer.--Figure 19 shows the improved cube mixer made by the Municipal
Engineering & Contracting Co., Chicago, Ill. The drum consists of a cubical box with rounded
corners and edges. This box has hollow gudgeons at two diagonally opposite corners and these
gudgeons are open as shown to provide for charging and discharging. The box is rotated by gears
meshing with a circumferential rack midway between gudgeons and another set of gears operate
to tilt the mixer. The inside of the box is smooth, there being no deflectors, as its shape
is such as to fold the batch repeatedly and thus accomplish the mixing.

Ransome Non-Tilting Mixer.--Figure 20 shows a representative non-tilting mixer made by the
Ransome Concrete Machinery Co., Dunellen, N. J. It consists of a cylindrical drum riding on
rollers and rotated by a train of gears meshing with circumferential racks on the drum. The
drum has a circular opening at each end; a charging chute enters one opening and a tilting
discharge chute may be thrown into or out of the opposite opening. The cylindrical shell of
the drum is provided inside with steel plate deflectors, which plow through and pick up and
drop the concrete mixture as the drum revolves. The shape and arrangement of the deflectors
are such that the batch is shifted back and forth axially across the mixer. To discharge the
batch the discharge chute is tilted so that its end projects into the mixer, in which position
the material picked up by the deflectors drops back onto the chute and runs out. The discharge
chute being independent of the mixing drum it can be thrown into and out of discharge position
at will without stopping the rotation of the drum, and so can discharge any part or all of
the batch at once. The top edge of the charging chute ranges from 30½ to 38 ins. in height
above the top of the frame, varying with the size of the mixer.

Smith Tilting Mixer.--Figure 21 shows a tilting mixer, known as the Smith mixer, made by the
Contractors' Supply & Equipment Co., Chicago, Ill. The drum consists of two truncated cones
with their large ends fastened together and their small ends open for receiving the charge
and discharge of the batch. The drum is operated by a train of gears meshing into a rack at
mid-length where the cones join. In addition there is another set of gears which tilt the drum
to make the concrete flow out of the discharge end.

~Continuous Mixers.~--Continuous mixers are those in which the cement, sand and stone are fed
to the charging hopper in a continuous stream and the mixed concrete is discharged in another
continuous stream. They are built in two principal forms. In one form the cement, sand and
stone properly proportioned are shoveled directly into the mixing drum. In the other form these
materials are dumped into separate charging hoppers and are automatically fed into the mixing
drum in any relative proportions desired. One form of continuous mixer with automatic feed
is described in the succeeding paragraph and another form is described in Chapter XIV. The
continuous mixer without automatic feed consists simply of a trough with a rotating paddle
shaft and its driving mechanism. The charging, the mixing and the discharging are done in what
is virtually a succession of very small batches.

Eureka Automatic Feed Mixer.--Figure 22 shows the construction of the continuous mixer built
by the Eureka Machine Co., Lansing, Mich. The cement bin and feeder is the small one in the
foreground. There is a pocketed cylinder revolving between concave plates, opening into the
hopper above, from which the pockets in the feeder are filled, and discharging directly into
the mixing trough below. Back of this is shown the feeder for sand or gravel up to 2-in. screen
size. This is a pocketed cylinder similar to that used in the cement feeder, except that it
is larger, and instead of being provided on the discharge side with a concave plate, is surmounted
by a roller, held by springs. This serves to cut off the excessive flow of material, but provides
sufficient flexibility to allow the rough coarse material to be fed through the machine without
its catching. The feeder for crushed stone is a similar construction on larger lines, to handle
material up to 3-in. size. These several feeders can be set to give any desired mixture. On
any material fit to be used in concrete, they will measure with an error of less than 5 per
cent., an agitator being provided in the sand bin to prevent damp sand from bridging over the
feeder, and preventing its action. The mixer consists of a trough, with a square shaft, on
which are mounted 37 mixing paddles, which are slipped on in rotation, so as to form practically
a continuous conveyor, but as each paddle is distinct, and is shaped like the mold board of
a plow, the material, as it passes from one to the next, is turned over and stirred. Water
is sprayed into the mass at the center of the trough. The result is a dry mix, followed by
a wet mix. The mixing trough is made of heavy gage steel, well reinforced, and practically
indestructible. To take care of the discharge of material while changing wheelbarrows, a hood
is provided on the discharge end of the machine, which can be lowered, and will hold about
a wheelbarrow load.

~Gravity Mixers.~--Gravity mixers are constructed in two general forms. The first form is a
trough whose bottom or sides or both are provided with pegs, deflectors or other devices for
giving the material a zig-zag motion as it flows down the trough. The second form consists
of a series of hoppers set one above the other so that the batch is spilled from one into the
next and is thus mixed.

The chief advantage claimed for gravity mixers is that no power is required to operate them.
This is obviously so only in the sense that gravity mixers have no power-operated moving mechanism,
and the fact should not be overestimated. The cost of power used in the actual performance
of mixing is a very small item. The distance between feed and discharge levels is always greater
for gravity mixers than for machine mixers, and the power required to raise the concrete materials
the excess height may easily be greater than the power required to operate a machine mixer.
On the other hand the simplicity of the gravity mixer insures low maintenance costs.

Gilbreth Trough Mixer.--Figure 23 shows the construction of one of the best known makes of
gravity mixers of the trough form. In operation the cement, sand and stone in the proper proportions
are spread in superimposed layers on a shoveling board at hopper level and are then shoveled
as evenly as possible into the hopper. From the hopper the materials flow down the trough,
receiving the water about half way down, and are mixed by being cut and turned by the pins
and deflectors. The trough of the mixer is about 10 ft. long.

Hains Gravity Mixer.--The form of gravity mixer made by the Hains Concrete Mixer Co., Washington,
D. C., is shown by Figs. 24 and 25. The charge passes through the hoppers in succession. Considering
first the stationary plant, shown by Fig. 24, the four hoppers at the top have a combined capacity
of one of the lower hoppers. Each top hopper is charged with cement, sand and stone in the
order named and in the proper proportions. Water is then dashed over the tops of the filled
hoppers and they are dumped simultaneously into the hopper next below. This hopper is then
discharged into the next and so on to the bottom. Meanwhile the four top hoppers have been
charged with materials for another batch. It will be observed that (1) the concrete is mixed
in separate batches and (2) the ingredients making a batch are accurately proportioned and
begin to be mixed for the whole batch at once. The best arrangement is to have the top of the
hopper tower carry sand and stone bins which chute directly into the top hoppers. In the telescopic
mixer shown by Fig. 25 the purpose has been to provide a mixer which, hung from a derrick or
cableway, will receive a charge of raw materials at stock pile and deliver a batch of mixed
concrete to the work, the operation of mixing being performed during the hoist to the work.
By providing two mixers so that one can be charged while the other is being hoisted continuous
operation is secured. The following are records of operation of stationary gravity mixers of
this type.

In building a dock at Baltimore, Md., a plant consisting of two large hoppers and four charging
hoppers with sand and stone bins above was used. One man at each large conical hopper tending
the gates and two men charging the four pyramidal hoppers composed the mixer gang. A scow load
of sand and another of stone were moored alongside the work and a clam-shell bucket dredge
loaded the material from these barges into the mixer bins. Each batch was 25 cu. ft. of 1-2-5
concrete rammed in place. The men at the upper hoppers would empty a sack of cement in each,
and then by opening gates in the bottom of the bins above, allow the necessary amounts of sand
and stone to flow in, marks having been previously made on the sides of the hoppers to show
the correct proportion of each of the ingredients. The amount of water found by experience
to be necessary, would then be dashed into the hoppers, and the charges allowed to run into
the first cone hopper below. Refilling would begin at the top while the men were caring for
the first charge in the lower hoppers. The process was thus continuous. The concrete was chuted
directly into place from the bottom hopper. The record of output was 110 batches per 10-hour
day. Wages of common labor were $1.50 per day. The labor cost per cubic yard of concrete in
place was 35 cts.

In constructing the Cedar Grove reservoir at Newark, N. J., a Hains mixer made the following
records of output:

                                           Cu. yds.
Best output per 10-hour day                     403
Average daily output for best month             302
Average daily output for whole job              225

The stone, sand and cement were all raised by bucket elevators to the top of the high wooden
tower that supported the bins and mixer. There were 10 men operating the mixer so that (exclusive
of power, interest and depreciation) the labor cost of mixing averaged only 7 cts. per cu.
yd.; during one month it was as low as 5 cts. per cu. yd. This does not include delivering
the materials to the men at the mixer, nor does it include conveying the concrete away and
placing it. The work was done by contract.

~OUTPUT OF MIXERS.~--With a good mixer the output depends upon the methods of conveying the
materials to and from the mixer. Most makers of mixers publish capacities of their machines
in batches or cubic yards output per hour; these figures may generally be taken as stating
nearly the maximum output possible. Considering batch mixers, as being the type most commonly
used, it may be assumed that where the work is well organized and no delay occurs in delivering
the materials to the mixer that a batch every 2 minutes, or 300 batches in 10 hours, will be
averaged, and there are a few records of a batch every 1½ minutes.

To illustrate to how great an extent the output of a mixer depends on the methods adopted in
handling the materials to and from the mixer we compare two actual cases that came under the
authors' observation. The mixers used were of the same size and make. In one case the stone
was shoveled into the charging hopper by four men and the sand and cement were delivered in
barrows by four other men; six men took the concrete away in wheelbarrows. The output of the
mixer was one batch every 5 minutes, or 120 batches, or 60 cu. yds., in 10 hours. In the other
case the sand and the stone were chuted directly into the charging hopper from overhead bins
and the mixer discharged into one-batch buckets on cars. In the first case the capacity of
the mixer was limited by the ability of a gang of workable size to get the raw materials to
and the mixed concrete away from the mixer. In the second case the capacity was limited only
by the amount of mixing deemed necessary.

While the necessity of rapid charging of a mixer to secure its best output is generally realized
it is often forgotten that the rapidity of discharge is also a factor of importance. The size
of the conveyor by which the concrete is removed affects the time of discharge. By timing a
string of wheelbarrows in line the authors have found that it takes about 7 seconds to fill
each barrow; as a rule slight delays will increase this time to 10 seconds. With a load of
1 cu. ft. per barrow it requires 13 barrow loads to take away a ½ cu. yd. batch. This makes
the time of discharging a batch 130 seconds, or say 2 minutes. The same mixer discharging into
a batch size bucket will discharge in 15 to 20 seconds, saving at least 1½ minutes in discharging
each batch.

~MIXER EFFICIENCY.~--Various attempts have been made to rate the efficiency of concrete mixers.
In all cases a percentage basis of comparison has been adopted; arbitrary values are assigned
to the several functions of a mixer, such as 40 per cent. for perfect mixing, 10 per cent.
for time of mixing and 25 per cent. for control of water, the total being 100 per cent., and
each mixer analyzed and given a rating according as it is considered to approach the full value
of any function. Such percentage ratings are unscientific and misleading; they present definite
figures for what are mere arbitrary determinations. The values assigned to the several functions
are purely arbitrary in the first place, and in the second place the decision as to how near
those values any mixer approaches are matters of personal judgment.

The most efficient mixer is the one that gives the maximum product of standard quality at the
least cost for production.

This rule recognizes the fact that in practical construction different standards of quality
are accepted for different kinds of work. No engineer demands, for example, the same quality
of mixture for a pavement base that he does for a reinforced concrete girder. If mixer A turns
out concrete of a quality suitable for pavement base cheaper than does mixer B, then it is
the more efficient mixer for the purpose, even though mixer B will make the superior quality
of concrete required for a reinforced girder while mixer A will not. This method of determining
efficiency holds accurate for any standard of quality that may be demanded.

Mixed concrete if emptied loose and allowed to sink through water is destroyed; the cement
paste is washed away and the sand and stone settle onto the bottom more or less segregated
and practically without cementing value. In fact, if concrete is deposited with the utmost
care in closed buckets and there is any current to speak of a considerable portion of cement
is certain to wash out of the deposited mass. Even in almost still water some of the cement
will rise to the surface and appear as a sort of milky scum, commonly called laitance. Placing
concrete under water, therefore, involves the distinctive task of providing means to prevent
the washing action of the water. It is also distinguished from work done in air by the fact
that it cannot be compacted by ramming, but the main problem is that of preventing wash during
and after placing.

~DEPOSITING IN CLOSED BUCKETS.~--Special buckets for depositing concrete under water are made
by several manufacturers of concrete buckets. These buckets vary in detail but are all similar
in having doors to close the concrete away from the water and, generally, in being bottom dumping.

The bucket shown by Fig. 26 was designed by Mr. John F. O'Rourke, and is built by the Cockburn
Barrow & Machine Co., of Jersey City, N. J. This bucket was used in depositing the concrete
for the City Island Bridge foundations described in Chapter XII and also in a number of other
works. It consists of a nearly cubical shell of steel open at top and bottom, and having heavy
timbers rivetted around the bottom edges. The open top has two flat flap doors. Two similar
doors hinged about midway of the sides close to form a V-shaped hopper bottom inside the shell
and serve when open, to close the openings in the sides of the shell. In loading the bucket
the bottom doors are drawn inward and upward by the chains and held by a temporary key. The
loaded bucket is then lifted by the bail and the key removed, since when suspended the pull
on the bail holds the chains taut and the doors closed. As soon as the bucket rests on the
bottom the pull of the concrete on the doors slides the bail down and the doors swing downward
and back discharging the concrete. The timbers around the bottom edges keep the bucket from
sinking into the deposited concrete, and the doors and shell exclude all water from the batch
until it is finally in place.

The subaqueous concrete bucket shown by Figs. 27 and 28 is made by the Cyclopean Iron Works
Co., Jersey City, N. J. Fig. 27 shows the bucket suspended full ready for lowering; the cover
is closed and latched and the bail is held vertical by the tag line catch A. Other points to
be noted are the eccentric pivoting of the bail, the latch unlocking lever and roller B and
C, and the stop D. In the position shown the bucket is lowered through the water and when at
the proper depth just above bottom the tag line is given a sharp pull, uncatching the bail.
The body of the bucket turns bottom side up, revolving on the bail pivots, and just as the
revolution is completed the bail engages the roller C on the latch unlocking lever and swings
the lever enough to unlatch the top and allow it to swing down as shown by Fig. 28 and release
the concrete. The stop D keeps the body of the bucket from swinging beyond the vertical in dumping.

Figures 29 and 30 show the subaqueous concrete bucket made by the G. L. Stuebner Iron Works,
Long Island City, N. Y., essentially the same bucket, omitting the cover and with a peaked
bail, is used for work in air. For subaqueous work the safety hooks A are lifted from the angles
B and wired to the bail in the position shown by the dotted lines, and a tag line is attached
to the handle bar C. The bucket being filled and the cover placed is lowered through the water
to the bottom and then discharged by a pull on the tag line.

~DEPOSITING IN BAGS.~--Two methods of depositing concrete in bags are available to the engineer;
one method is to employ a bag of heavy tight woven material, from which the concrete is emptied
at the bottom, the bag serving like the buckets previously described simply as means of conveyance,
and the other method is to use bags of paper or loose woven gunnysack which are left in the
work, the idea being that the paper will soften or the cement will ooze out through the openings
in the cloth sufficiently to bond the separate bagfuls into a practically solid mass.

The bag shown by Fig. 31 was used to deposit concrete for leveling up a rough rock bottom and
so provide a footing for a concrete block pier constructed in 1902 at Peterhead, N. B., by
Mr. William Shield, M. Inst. C. E. Careful longitudinal profiles were taken of the rock bottom
one at each edge of the footing. Side forms were then made in 20-ft. sections as shown by Fig.
32; the lagging boards being cut to fit the determined profile and the top of the longitudinal
piece being flush with the top of the proposed footing. The concrete was filled in between
the side forms and leveled off by the T-rail straight-edge. In placing the side forms the longitudinal
pieces were placed by divers who were given the proper elevations by level rods having 10 to
15-ft. extension pieces to raise the targets above the water surface. When leveled the side
pieces were anchor-bolted as shown to the rock, the anchor-bolts being wedged into the holes
to permit future removal. The concrete was then lowered in the bag shown by Fig. 31, the divers
assisting in guiding the bag to position. The mouth of the bag being tied by one turn of a
line having loops through which a wooden key is slipped to hold the line tight, a sharp tug
on the tripping rope loosens the key and empties the bag. The bags used on this work had a
capacity of 2¼ cu. ft. To permit the removal of the side forms after the concrete had hardened,
a strip of jute sacking was spread against the lagging boards with a flap extending 15 to 18
ins. under the concrete. The forms were removed by divers who loosened the anchor bolt wedges.

In placing small amounts of concrete for bridge foundations in Nova Scotia, bags, made of rough
brown paper were used to hold the concrete. Each bag held about 1 cu. ft. The bags were made
up quickly and dropped into the water one after the other so that the following one was deposited
before the cement escaped from the former one. The paper was immediately destroyed by submersion
and concrete remained. The bags cost $1.35 per hundred or 35 cts. per cu. yd. of concrete.
Concrete was thus deposited in 18 ft. of water without a diver.

~DEPOSITING THROUGH A TREMIE.~--A tremie consists of a tube of wood or, better, of sheet metal,
which reaches from above the surface to the bottom of the water; it is operated by filling
the tube with concrete and keeping it full by successive additions while allowing the concrete
to flow out gradually at the bottom by raising the tube slightly to provide the necessary opening.
A good example of a sheet steel tremie is shown by Fig. 33. This tremie was used by Mr. Wm.
H. Ward in constructing the Harvard Bridge foundations and numerous other subaqueous structures
of concrete. In these works the tube was suspended from a derrick. Wheelbarrows filled the
tube and hopper with concrete and kept them full; the derrick raised the tube a few inches
and swung it gently so as to move it slowly over the area to be filled. Care being taken to
keep the tube at one height, the concrete was readily deposited in even layers. Concrete thus
deposited in 18 ft. of water was found to be level and solid on pumping the pit dry.

Another method of handling a tremie was employed in constructing the foundations for the Charlestown
Bridge at Boston, Mass. Foundation piles were driven and sawed off under water. A frame was
built above water and supported by a curbing attached to certain piles in the outer rows of
the foundation reserved for this purpose. In this frame the vertical members were Wakefield
sheet-piling plank, spaced 6 to 10 ft. apart, and connected by three lines of double waling
bolted to the verticals at three different heights. This frame was lowered to the bottom so
as to enclose the bearing piles. The posts or verticals were then driven, one by one, into
the bottom, the frame being flexible enough to permit this. The spaces between the posts or
verticals were then filled by sheet-piling and the frame was bolted to the curbing piles. This
curbing afterward supported the traveler used in laying the concrete. Thus a coffer dam was
formed to receive the concrete as shown in Fig. 34. The 1-2-5 concrete was deposited up to
within 5½ ft. of the mean low water level, the last foot being laid after water was pumped
out. The tremie used to deposit the concrete was a tube 14 ins. in diameter at the bottom and
11 ins. at the neck, with a hopper at the top. It was made in removable sections, with outside
flanges, and was suspended by a differential hoist from a truck moving laterally on a traveler,
Fig. 34. The foot of the chute rested on the bottom until filled with concrete; then the chute
was slowly raised and the concrete allowed to run but into a conical heap, more concrete being
dumped into the hopper. As the truck moved across the traveler a ridge of concrete was made;
then the traveler was moved forward and another parallel ridge was made. The best results were
obtained when the layers were 2½ ft. thick, but layers up to 6 ft. thick were laid. If the
layer was too thick, or uneven, or if the chute was moved or raised too quickly, the charge
in the tube was "lost." This was objectionable because the charging of the chute anew resulted
in "washing" the cement more or less out of the concrete until the chute was again filled.
To reduce this objection the contractor was directed to dump some neat cement into the tube
before filling with concrete. A canvass piston was devised which could be pushed ahead of the
concrete when filling the chute. It consisted of two truncated cones of canvass, one flaring
downward to force the water ahead, and the other flaring upward to hold the concrete. The canvass
was stiffened and held against the sides of the chute by longitudinal ribs of spring steel
wire; the waist was filled by a thick block of wood to which all the springs were attached;
and to this block were connected additional steel guides to prevent overturning and a rope
to regulate the descent. Very little water forced its way past this piston and it was a success,
but as the cost was considerable and a piston was lost each time, its use was abandoned as
the evil to be avoided did not justify the outlay.

The chute worked best when the concrete was mixed not quite wet enough to be plastic. If mixed
too wet the charge was liable to be "lost," and if dry it would choke the chute. An excess
of gravel permitted water to ascend in the tube; and an excess of sand tended to check the
flow of concrete.

In constructing the piers for a masonry arch bridge in France in 1888 much the same method
was followed, except that a wooden tremie 16 ins. square made in detachable sections was used.
This tremie had a hopper top and was also provided with a removable cap or cover for the bottom
end, the latter device being intended to keep the water out of the tube and prevent "washing"
the first charge of concrete. The piers were constructed by first driving piles and sawing
them off several feet above the bottom but below water level, and then filling them nearly
to their tops with broken stone. An open box caisson was then sunk onto the stone and embracing
the pile tops and then filled around the outside with more broken stone. The caisson was then
filled with concrete through the tremie which was handled by a traveling crane. The crane was
mounted and traveled transversely of the pier on a platform which in turn moved along tracks
laid lengthwise of the caisson. The tube was gradually filled with concrete and lowered, the
detachable bottom of the tube was then removed, allowing the concrete to run out. The tube
was first moved across the caisson and then downstream and back across the caisson, and this
operation repeated until a 16-in. layer was completed. The tube was then raised 16 ins. and
the operations repeated to form another layer. There was almost no laitance. From 90 to 100
cu. yds. were deposited daily.

Still another example of tremie work is furnished by the task of depositing a large mass of
concrete under water in the construction of the Nussdorf Lock at Vienna. This lock has a total
width of 92 ft. over all, and is 49.2 ft. clear inside. The excavation, which was carried to
a depth of 26.24 ft. below water level, was made full width, between sheet piling, and the
bottom was filled in with rammed sand and gravel, forming a kind of invert with its upper surface
horizontal in the middle and sloping upwards a trifle at both sides. A mass of concrete having
a total thickness of 13.12 ft. was built on this foundation in the center where the upper surfaces
were 13.12 ft. below the water level. Concrete walls were carried up at the sides of the lock
to a height of 3.28 ft.; these walls were 8.2 ft. thick. The methods used in placing the concrete
were as follows: Three longitudinal rows of piles were driven on each side of the axis of the
lock, these piles supporting a 6-rail track about 7 ft. above the water level. Three carriages
spanning the full width of the lock transversely moved on this track. Each carriage had three
trolleys, one in each of the main panels of the transverse pile bends. These trolleys each
carried a vertical telescopic tube, by means of which the concrete was deposited at the bottom
of the lock. These tubes or chutes were of different lengths in the three carriages; the first
ones deposited the concrete up to a level of 23 ft. below the surface; the next set deposited
the concrete between that level and 19.7 ft., and the last set completed the subaqueous work
up to the final height of 16.4 ft. below the surface. The tops of the tubes were level with
a transverse track extending the full length of the carriage. The ends of these tracks just
cleared the outside rows of piles, which, on one side of the lock, supported a distribution
track parallel to the axis of the lock. Dump cars running on this distribution track delivered
the concrete to smaller dump cars on the carriage tracks, and in turn these smaller cars dumped
into either of these chutes on each carriage. The carriages were moved from end to end of the
lock, the whole area of the lock coming under the nine chutes, inasmuch as each chute moved
one-third the length of the carriage. The concrete was deposited in three horizontal layers
3.28 ft. thick, the layers being built in comparatively narrow banks, so that the different
layers would key together and form a corrugated mass. The chutes were shortened as the concrete
was deposited, three layers being placed successively. The main body of the bottom and the
side walls were built by this method, and then the water was pumped out and a 2.3 ft. layer
of concrete rammed over the bottom and completed with a finished surface 9 ft. thick.

~GROUTING SUBMERGED STONE.~--Masses of gravel, broken or rubble stone deposited under water
may be cemented into virtually a solid concrete by charging the interstices with grout forced
through pipes from the surface. Mr. H. F. White gives the following records of grouting submerged
gravel:

In experiment No. 1 a reservoir 10 ft. square was filled to a depth of 18 ins. with clean gravel
ballast (1½ to 2-in. size) submerged in water. A 2-in. gas pipe rested on the gravel and was
surmounted with a funnel. A 1:1 Portland grout was poured in. After 21 days set the water was
drawn off, and it was found that the grout had permeated the ballast for a space of 8 ft. square
at the bottom and 6 ft. square at the top, leaving a small pile of pure cement mortar 6 ins.
high about the base of the pipe; 16 cu. ft. of cement and 16 cu. ft. of sand concreted 100
cu. yds. of ballast. In experiment No. 2, under the same conditions, a grout made of 1 part
lime, 1 part surki (puzzulana or trass) and 1 part sand, was found to have spread over the
entire bottom, 10 ft. square, rising 5 ins. on the sides, and making the concreted mass about
3½ ft. square at the top; 25 cu. ft. of the dry materials concreted 100 cu. ft. of ballast.
In experiment No. 3 the ballast was 2½ ft. deep. A grout (using 8 cu. ft. of each ingredient)
made as in experiment No. 2 covered the bottom, rose 14 ins. on the sides and made a top surface
4½ ft. square; 32 cu. ft. of the dry materials grouted 100 cu. ft. of ballast. In experiment
No. 4 the ballast was of bats and pieces 3 or 4 ins. in size laid 7 ft. deep. A grout made
as in experiment No. 2 (using 88 cu. ft. of each ingredient) concreted the whole mass to a
depth of 6 ft. up the sides, and 2½ ft. square at the pipe on the surface of the ballast. Mr.
White says that a grout containing more than 1 part of sand to 1 of Portland cement will not
run freely through a 2-in. pipe, as the sand settles out and chokes the pipe. Even with 1:1
grout it must be constantly stirred and a steady flow into the pipe maintained. The lime-trass
grout does not give the same trouble.

Mr. W. R. Knipple describes the work of grouting rubble stone and gravel for the base of the
Hermitage Breakwater. This breakwater is 525 ft. long, 50 ft. wide at base and 42 ft. wide
at top, and 68 ft. high, was built on the island of Jersey. Where earth (from 0 to 8½ ft. deep)
overlaid the granite rock, it was dredged and the trench filled in with rubble stones and gravel
until a level foundation was secured. Cement grout was then forced into this filling through
pipe placed 8 to 10 ft. apart. The grouting was done in sections 12½ ft. long, from 7 to 10
days being taken to complete each. Upon this foundation concrete blocks, 4×4×9 to 12 ft., were
laid in courses inclined at an angle of 68°. The first four courses were laid by divers, the
blocks being stacked dry two courses high at a time. The joints below water were calked by
divers and above water by masons, and a section was then grouted. When two courses had been
laid and grouted, two more courses were laid and grouted in turn, and so on. In places, grouting
was done in 50 ft. of water. The grout should be a thick paste; a 30-ft. column of grout will
balance a 60-ft. column of water.

Two kinds of concrete which vary in composition and character from the common standard mixtures
of cement, sand and broken aggregate are extensively employed in engineering construction.
These are rubble concrete and asphaltic concrete.

~RUBBLE CONCRETE.~--In constructing massive walls and slabs a reduction in cost may often (not
always) be obtained by introducing large stones into the concrete. Concrete of this character
is called rubble concrete, and the percentage of rubble stone contained varies from a few per
cent. to, in some cases, over half of the volume. The saving effected comes partly from the
reduction in the cement required per cubic yard of concrete and partly from the saving in crushing.

The saving in cement may be readily figured if the composition of the concrete and the volume
of the added rubble stones be known. A 1-2½-5 concrete requires according to Table X in Chapter
II 1.13 bbls. of cement per cubic yard. Assuming a barrel of cement to make 3.65 cu. ft. of
paste, we have 3.65 × 1.13 = 4.12 cu. ft. of cement paste per cubic yard of 1-2½-5 concrete.
This means that about 15 per cent. of the volume of the concrete structure is cement. If rubble
stone be introduced to 50 per cent. of the volume, then the structure has about 7½ per cent.
of its volume of cement. It is of interest to note in this connection that rubble masonry composed
of 65 per cent. stone and 35 per cent. of 1-2½ mortar would have some 11½ per cent. of its
volume made up of cement.

The saving in crushing is not so simple a determination. Generally speaking, the fact that
a considerable volume of the concrete is composed of what, we will call uncrushed stone, means
a saving in the stone constituent of one structure amounting to what it would have cost to
break up and screen this volume of uncrushed stone, but there are exceptions. For example,
the anchorages of the Manhattan Bridge over the East River at New York city were specified
to be of rubble concrete, doubtless because the designer believed rubble concrete to be cheaper
than plain concrete. In this case an economic mistake was made, for all the rubble stone used
had to be quarried up the Hudson River, loaded onto and shipped by barges to the site and then
unloaded and handled to the work using derricks. Now this repeated handling of large, irregular
rubble stones is expensive. Crushed stone as we have shown in Chapter IV can be unloaded from
boats at a very low cost by means of clam shells. It can be transported on a belt conveyor,
elevated by bucket conveyer, mixed with sand and cement and delivered to the work all with
very little manual labor when the installation of a very efficient plant is justified by the
magnitude of the job. Large rubble stones cannot be handled so cheaply or with so great rapidity
as crushed stone; the work may be so expensive, due to repeated handlings, as to offset the
cost of crushing as well as the extra cost of cement in plain concrete. On the other hand,
the cost of quarrying rock suitable for rubble concrete is no greater than the cost of quarrying
it for crushing--it is generally less because the stone does not have to be broken so small--so
that when the cost of getting the quarried rock to the crusher and the crushed stone into the
concrete comes about the same as getting the quarried stone into the structure it is absurd
practice to require crushing. To go back then to our first thought, the question whether or
not saving results from the use of rubble concrete, is a separate problem in engineering economics
for each structure.

In planning rubble concrete work the form of the rubble stones as they come from the quarry
deserves consideration. Stones that have flat beds like many sandstones and limestones can
be laid upon layers of dry concrete and have the vertical interstices filled with dry concrete
by tamping. It requires a sloppy concrete to thoroughly embed stones which break out irregularly.
In the following examples of rubble concrete work the reader will find structures varying widely
enough in character and in the percentages of rubble used to cover most ordinary conditions
of such work.

Where the rubble stones are very large it is now customary to use the term "cyclopean masonry"
instead of rubble concrete. Many engineers who have not studied the economics of the subject
believe that the use of massive blocks of stone bedded in concrete necessarily gives the cheapest
form of masonry. We have already indicated conditions where ordinary concrete is cheaper than
rubble concrete. We may add that if the quarry yields a rock that breaks up naturally into
small sized blocks, it is the height of economic folly to specify large sized cyclopean blocks.
Nevertheless this blunder has been frequently made in the recent past.

~Chattahoochee River Dam.~--The roll-way portion, 680 ft. long, of the dam for the Atlanta
Water & Electric Power Co., shown in section by Fig. 35, was built of a hearting of rubble
concrete with a fine concrete facing and a rubble rear wall. The facing, 12 ins. thick of 1-2-4
concrete, gave a smooth surface for the top and face of the dam, while the rubble rear wall
enabled back forms to be dispensed with and, it was considered, made a more impervious masonry.
The concrete matrix for the core was a 1-2-5 stone mixture made very wet. The rubble stones,
some as large as 4 cu. yds., were bedded in the concrete by dropping them a few yards from
a derrick and "working" them with bars; a well formed stone was readily settled 6 ins. into
a 10-in. bed of concrete. The volume of rubble was from 33 to 45 per cent. of the total volume
of the masonry. The 1-2-4 concrete facing was brought up together with the rubble core, using
face forms and templates to get the proper profile. The work was done by contract and the average
was 5,500 cu. yds. of concrete placed per month.

~Barossa Dam, South Australia.~--The Barossa Dam for the water-works for Gawler, South Australia,
is an arch with a radius of 200 ft., and an arc length on top of 422 ft.; its height above
the bed of the stream is 95 ft. Figure 36 is a cross-section of the dam at the center. The
dam contains 17,975 cu. yds. of rubble concrete in the proportions of 2,215 cu. yds. of rubble
stone to 15,760 cu. yds. of concrete; thus about 12.3 per cent. of the dam was of rubble. The
concrete was mixed by weight of 1 part cement, 1½ parts sand, and a varying proportion of aggregate
composed of 4½ parts 1¼ to 2-in. stone, 2 parts ½ to 1¼-in. stone and 1 part 1/8 to ½-in. stone
or screenings. The sand was one-half river sand and one-half crusher sand. The following shows
the amounts by weight of the several materials for each of the several classes of concrete
per cubic yard:

                       -------------Stone----------
Class. Excess Mortar.    1¼-2.      ½-1¼.    1/8-½.    Sand.  Cement.
  A         7.5%       1,500        661½     333¼       804    434
  B        12.5        1,433-1/3    637      318        858½   463
  C        12.5        1,434        637      318½       859    474
  D        15          1,402        623      312        884    484

The average composition of the concrete was 1-1½-3½. Its cost per cubic yard in place including
rubble was 38s 9d per cu. yd. or about $9.30. In proportioning the mixture on the work use
was made of the device shown by Fig. 37 to weigh the aggregate. The measuring car is pushed
back under the stone hopper chute until the wheels drop into shallow notches in the balanced
track rails; stone is then admitted until the lead weight begins to rise, when the car is pushed
forward and dumps automatically as indicated.

~Other Rubble Concrete Dams.~--Rubble concrete containing from 55 to 60 per cent. rubble was
used in constructing the Boonton Dam at Boonton, N. J. The stones used measured from 1 to 2½
cu. yds. each; the concrete was made so wet that when the stones were dropped into it, it flowed
into every crevice. The materials were all delivered on cars, from which they were delivered
to the dam by derricks provided with bull-wheels. On the dam there were 4 laborers and 1 mason
to each derrick, and this gang dumped the concrete and joggled the rubble stones into it. Records
of 125 cu. yds. per 10 hours, with one derrick, were made. With 35 derricks, 20 of which were
laying masonry and 15 either passing materials or being moved, as much as 21,000 cu. yds. of
masonry were laid in one month. The amount of cement per cubic yard of masonry is variously
stated to have been 0.6 to 0.75 bbl. The stone was granite.

The Spier Falls Dam on the upper Hudson River was built of rubble concrete containing about
33 per cent. rubble stone. The concrete was a 1-2½-5 mixture, and the engineer states that
about 1 bbl. of cement was used per cubic yard of rubble concrete. This high percentage of
cement may be accounted for by the fact that there was a considerable amount of rubble masonry
in cement mortar included in the total. The stones and concrete were delivered along the dam
by cableways and stiff-leg derricks set on the downstream sloping face of the dam delivered
them from the cableways into place. There were two laborers to each mason employed in placing
the materials, wages being 15 and 35 cts. per hour, respectively. The labor cost of placing
the materials was 60 cts. per cubic yard of masonry. The stone was granite.

Granite rubble laid in layers on beds of concrete and filled between with concrete was used
in constructing the Hemet Dam in California. The concrete was a 1-3-6 mixture, and was thoroughly
tamped under and between the stones. For face work the stones were roughly scabbled to shape
and laid in mortar. The stone was taken from the quarry 400 ft. away and delivered directly
on the dam by cableways; here two derricks handled the stone into place, the dam being only
246 ft. arc length on top, though it was 122½ ft. high. The cableways would take a 10-ton load;
stones could be taken from the quarry, hoisted 150 ft. and delivered to the work in 40 to 60
seconds. Common labor at $1.75 per day was used for all masonry except facing, where masons
at $3.50 were employed. Cement cost delivered $5 per barrel, of which from $1 to $1.50 per
barrel was the cost of hauling 23 miles by team over roads having 18 per cent. grades in places.
Sand was taken from the stream bed and delivered to the work by bucket conveyor. "Under favorable
conditions some of the masonry was put in for as low as $4 per cu. yd." There were 31,100 cu.
yds. of masonry in the dam, which required 20,000 bbls. of cement, or 0.64 bbl. per cubic yard.

The following novel method of making rubble concrete was employed in enlarging two old dams
and in constructing two new dams for a small water-works. The available time was short, the
amount of work was too small and too scattered to justify the installation of a stone crusher,
and suitable gravel was not at hand. Sufficient small boulders in old walls, and borrow pits
and on surface of fields were available, and were used with thin Portland cement mortar. One
part of Alpha or Lehigh cement and three parts sand were mixed dry at first and then wet with
just enough water to make the resulting mortar flow by gravity. This mortar was shoveled into
the forms continuously by one set of men while other men were throwing into the mortar in the
forms the boulders which were cleaned and broken so as not to be more than 7 ins. long. In
general the performance was continuous. Three mortar beds were placed parallel with, and against,
one side of the forms, with spaces of about 4 ft. between the ends of the beds. The boulders
were dumped on the opposite side of the forms. Two men shoveled in all the mortar and did nothing
else. While they were emptying one bed the mortar was being mixed in the preceding bed by two
other men and the materials placed in the third bed by still others. Another gang was continually
throwing in the boulders and small stones and still another was breaking stone. One man should
keep the mortar well stirred while the bed is being emptied. About 20 men were necessary to
do all parts of the work. The forms were of 2-in. planed plank tongued and grooved. Especial
pains were taken to make the forms tight, and all leaks that appeared were quickly stopped
with dry cement. Some pains were taken to prevent a flat side of large stones from coming in
direct contact with the forms, but round boulders and small stones needed no care to prevent
their showing in the finished work.

In conclusion it is interesting to note, perhaps, the earliest use of rubble concrete for dam
construction in this country in constructing the Boyd's Corner Dam on the Croton River near
New York. This dam was begun in 1867 and for a time rubble concrete was used, but was finally
discontinued, due to the impression that it might not be watertight. The specifications called
for dry concrete to be thoroughly rammed in between the rubble stones, and to give room for
this ramming the contractor was not permitted to lay any two stones closer together than 12
ins. As a result not more than 33 per cent. of the concrete was rubble.

~Abutment for Railway Bridge.~--Figure 38 shows a bridge abutment built of rubble concrete
at a cost of about $4.50 per cu. yd. The concrete was a 1-2½-4½ mixture laid in 4-in. layers.
On each layer were laid large rubble stones bedded flat and spaced to give 6-in. vertical joints;
the vertical joints were filled with concrete by ramming and then another layer of concrete
placed and so on. A force of 28 men and a foreman averaged 40 cu. yds. of rubble concrete per
day. The following is the itemized cost per cubic yard, not including forms, for 278 cu. yds:

Item.                                       Per Cu. Yd.
0.82 bbls. cement, at $2.60                    $2.14
0.22 cu. yd. sand, at $1.00                     0.22
0.52 cu. yd. broken stone, at $0.94             0.49
0.38 cu. yd. rubble stone, at $0.63             0.24
Water                                           0.07

Total                                          $4.44

~Some English Data on Rubble Concrete.~--Railway work, under Mr. John Strain, in Scotland and
Spain, involved the building of abutments, piers and arches of rubble concrete. The concrete
was made of 1 part cement to 5 parts of ballast, the ballast consisting of broken stone or
slag and sand mixed in proportions determined by experiment. The materials were mixed by turning
with shovels 4 times dry, then 4 times more during the addition of water through a rose nozzle.
A bed of concrete 6 ins. thick was first laid, and on this a layer of rubble stones, no two
stones being nearer together than 3 ins., nor nearer the forms than 3 ins. The stones were
rammed and probed around with a trowel to leave no spaces. Over each layer of rubble, concrete
was spread to a depth of 6 ins. The forms or molds for piers for a viaduct were simply large
open boxes, the four sides of which could be taken apart. The depth of the boxes was uniform,
and they were numbered from the top down, so, that, knowing the height of a given pier, the
proper box for the base could be selected. As each box was filled, the next one smaller in
size was swung into place with a derrick. The following bridge piers for the Tharsis & Calanas
Railway were built:

                    Length     Height     No.    Cu. Yds.  Weeks

16 to 23       8       420       4

It is stated that the construction of some of these piers in ordinary masonry would have taken
four times as long. The rock available for rubble did not yield large blocks, consequently
the percentage of pure concrete in the piers was large, averaging 70 per cent. In one case,
where the stones were smaller than usual, the percentage of concrete was 76½ per cent. In other
work the percentage has been as low as 55 per cent., and in still other work where a rubble
face work was used the percentage of concrete has been 40 per cent.

In these piers the average quantities of materials per cubic yard of rubble concrete were:

448 lbs. (0.178 cu. yd.) cement. 0.36 cu. yd. sand. 0.68 cu. yd. broken stone (measured loose
in piles). 0.30 cu. yd. rubble (measured solid).

Several railway bridge piers and abutments in Scotland are cited. In one of these, large rubble
stones of irregular size and weighing 2 tons each were set inside the forms, 3 ins. away from
the plank and 3 ins. from one another. The gang to each derrick was: 1 derrick man and 1 boy,
1 mason and 10 laborers, and about one-quarter of the time of 1 carpenter and his helper raising
the forms. For bridges of 400 cu. yds., the progress was 12 to 15 cu. yds. a day. The forms
were left in place 10 days.

To chip off a few inches from the face of a concrete abutment that was too far out, required
the work of 1 quarryman 5 days per cu. yd. of solid concrete chipped off.

Concrete was used for a skew arch over the River Dochart, on the Killin Railway, Scotland.
There were 5 arches, each of 30 ft. span on the square or 42 ft. on the skew, the skew being
45°. The piers were of rubble concrete. The concrete in the arch was wheeled 300 ft. on a trestle,
and dumped onto the centers. It was rammed in 6-in. layers, which were laid corresponding to
the courses of arch stones. As the layers approached the crown of the arch, some difficulty
was experienced in keeping the surfaces perpendicular. Each arch was completed in a day.

In a paper by John W. Steven, in Proc. Inst. C. E., the following is given:

Mr. Martin Murphy describes some bridge foundations in Nova Scotia. Rubble concrete was used
in some of the piers. The rubble concrete consisted of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, 1 part
clean gravel, and 5 parts of large stones weighing 20 lbs. each and upwards. The sand, cement
and gravel were turned three times dry and three times wet, and put into the forms. The rubble
stones were bedded in the concrete by hand, being set on end, 2 or 3 ins. apart. No rubble
stones were placed within 6 ins. of the forms, thus leaving a face of plain concrete; and the
rubble stones were not carried higher than 18 ins. below the top of the pier. One cubic yard
of this rubble concrete required 0.8 to 0.9 bbl. of cement.

~ASPHALT CONCRETE.~--Asphalt or tar concrete in which steam cinders or broken stone or gravel
and sand are mixed with asphaltum or tar instead of cement paste are used to some extent in
lining reservoirs, constructing mill floors, etc. Such mixtures differ in degree only from
the mixtures used for asphalt street paving, for discussion of which the various books on paving
and asphalts should be consulted. The two examples of asphalt concrete work given here are
fairly representative of the mixtures and methods employed for concrete work as distinguished
from asphalt work.

~Slope Paving for Earth Dam.~--Mr. Robert B. Stanton describes a small log dam faced upstream
with earth, upon which was laid an asphalt concrete lining to make it water tight. The stone
was broken to 2-in. pieces, all the fines being left in and sufficient fine material added
to fill the voids. The stone was heated and mixed in pans or kettles from a street paving outfit;
and the asphaltum paste, composed of 4 parts California refined asphaltum and 1 part crude
petroleum, was boiled in another kettle. The boiling hot paste was poured with ladles over
the hot stone, and the whole mixed over the fire with shovels and hoes. The asphalt concrete
was taken away in hot iron wheelbarrows, placed in a 4-in. layer rammed and ironed with hot
irons. The concrete was laid in strips 4 to 6 ft. wide, the edges being coated with hot paste.
This paste was put on very hot and ironed down. It should not be more than {1/8}-in. thick
or it will "creep" on slopes of 1½ to 1. After two hot summers and one cold winter there was
not a single crack anywhere in the lining. A mixture of sand and asphalt will creep on slopes
of 1½ to 1, but asphalt concrete will not. With asphalt at $20 a ton, and labor at $2 a day,
the cost was 15 cts. a sq. ft. for 4-in. asphalt concrete. On a high slope Mr. Stanton recommends
making slight berms every 6 ft. to support the concrete and prevent creeping. Asphalt concrete
resists the wear of wind and water that cuts away granite and iron.

~Base for Mill Floor.~--In constructing 17,784 sq. ft. of tar concrete base for a mill floor,
Mr. C. H. Chadsey used a sand, broken stone and tar mixture mixed in a mechanical mixer. The
apparatus used and the mode of procedure followed were as follows:

Two parallel 8-in. brick walls 26 ft. long were built 4 ft. apart and 2½ ft. high to form a
furnace. On these walls at one end was set a 4×6×2 ft. steel plate tar heating tank. Next to
this tank for a space of 4×8 ft. the walls were spanned between with steel plates. This area
was used for heating sand. Another space of 4×8 ft. was covered with 1½ in. steel rods arranged
to form a grid; this space was used for heating the broken stones. The grid proved especially
efficient, as it permitted the hot air to pass up through the stones, while a small cleaning
door at the ground allowed the screenings which dropped through the grid to be raked out and
added to the mixture. A fire from barrel staves and refuse wood built under the tank end was
sufficient to heat the tar, sand and stone.

For mixing the materials a Ransome mixer was selected for the reason that heat could be supplied
to the exterior of the drum by building a wood fire underneath. This fire was maintained to
prevent the mixture from adhering to the mixing blades, and it proved quite effective, though
occasionally they would have to be cleaned with a chisel bar, particularly when the aggregate
was not sufficiently heated before being admitted to the mixer. A little "dead oil" applied
to the discharge chute and to the shovels, wheelbarrows and other tools effectually prevented
the concrete from adhering to them.

The method of depositing the concrete was practically the same as that used in laying cement
sidewalks. Wood strips attached to stakes driven into the ground provided templates for gaging
the thickness of the base and for leveling off the surface. The wood covering consisted of
a layer of 2-in. planks, covered by matched hardwood flooring. In placing the planking, the
base was covered with a ¼-in. layer of hot pitch, into which the planks were pressed immediately,
the last plank laid being toe-nailed to the preceding plank just enough to keep the joint tight.
After a few minutes the planks adhered so firmly to the base that they could be removed only
with difficulty. The hardwood surface was put on in the usual manner. The prices of materials
and wages for the work were as follows:

Pitch, bulk, per lb.                     $ 0.0075 Gravel, per cu. yd.                     
1.50 Spruce sub-floor, per M. ft. B. M.        15.00 Hardwood surface, per M. ft. B. M.   
33.00 Laborers, per 10-hour day.                 1.50 Foreman, per 10-hour day.           
4.00 Carpenters, per 10-hour day.

Reinforced concrete work may be done in freezing weather if the end to be gained warrants the
extra cost. Laboratory experiments show beyond much doubt that Portland cement concrete which
does not undergo freezing temperatures until final set has taken place, or which, if frozen
before it has set, is allowed to complete the setting process after thawing without a second
interruption by freezing, does not suffer loss of ultimate strength or durability. These requirements
for safety may be satisfied by so treating the materials or compounding the mixture that freezing
will not occur at normal freezing temperature or else will be delayed until the concrete has
set, by so housing in the work and artificially treating the inclosed space that its temperature
never falls as low as the freezing point, or, by letting the concrete freeze if it will and
then by suitable protection and by artificial heating produce and maintain a thawing temperature
until set has taken place.

~LOWERING THE FREEZING POINT OF THE MIXING WATER.~--Lowering the freezing point of the mixing
water is the simplest and cheapest method by which concrete can be mixed and deposited in freezing
weather. The method consists simply in adding some substance to the water which will produce
a brine or emulsion that freezes at some temperature below 32° F. determined by the substance
added and the richness of the admixture. A great variety of substances may be added to water
to produce low freezing brines, but in concrete work only those may be used that do little
or no injury to the strength and durability of the concrete. Practice has definitely determined
only one of these, namely, sodium chloride or common salt, though some others have been used
successfully in isolated cases. A point to be borne in mind is that cold retards the setting
of cement and that the use of anti-freezing mixtures emphasizes this phenomenon and its attendant
disadvantages in practical construction. The accompanying diagram, Fig. 39, based on the experiments
of Tetmajer, show the effect on the freezing point of water by the admixtures of various substances
that have been suggested for reducing the freezing point of mortar and concrete mixtures.

~Common Salt (Sodium Chloride).~--The substance most usually employed to lower the freezing
point of water used in concrete is common salt. Laboratory experiments show that the addition
of salt retards the setting and probably lowers the strength of cement at short periods, but
does not, when not used to excess, injure the ultimate strength. The amount beyond which the
addition of salt begins to affect injuriously the strength of cement is stated variously by
various authorities. Sutcliffe states that it is not safe to go beyond 7 or 8 per cent. by
weight of the water; Sabin places the safe figures at 10 per cent., and the same figure is
given by a number of other American experimenters. A number of rules have been formulated for
varying the percentage of salt with the temperature of the atmosphere. Prof. Tetmajer's rule
as stated by Prof. J. B. Johnson, is to add 1 per cent. of salt by weight of the water for
each degree Fahrenheit below 32°. A rule quoted by many writers is "1 lb. of salt to 18 gallons
of water for a temperature of 32° F., and an increase of 1 oz. for each degree lower temperature."
This rule gives entirely inadequate amounts to be effective, the percentage by weight of the
water being about 1 per cent. The familiar rules of enough salt to make a brine that will "float
an egg" or "float a potato" are likewise untrustworthy; they call respectively, according to
actual tests made by Mr. Sanford E. Thompson, for 15 per cent. and 11 per cent. of salt which
is too much, according to the authorities quoted above, to be used safely. In practice an arbitrary
quantity of salt per barrel of cement or per 100 lbs. of water is usually chosen. Preferably
the amount should be stated in terms of its percentage by weight of the water, since if stated
in terms of pounds per barrel of cement the richness of the brine will vary with the richness
of the concrete mixture, its composition, etc. As examples of the percentages used in practice,
the following works may be quoted: New York Rapid Transit Railway, 9 per cent. by weight of
the water; Foster-Armstrong Piano Works, 6 per cent. by weight of the water. In summary, it
would seem that if a rule for the use of salt is to be adopted that of Tetmajer, which is to
add 1 per cent. by weight of the water for each degree Fahrenheit below 32°, is as logical
and accurate as any. It should, however, be accompanied by the proviso that no more than 10
per cent. by weight of salt should be considered safe practice, and that if the frost is too
keen for this to avail some other method should be adopted or the work stopped. It may be taken
that each unit per cent. of salt added to water reduces the freezing temperature of the brine
about 1.08° F.; a 10 per cent. salt brine will therefore freeze at 32° - 11° = 21° F. The range
of efficiency of salt as a preventative of frost in mixing and laying concrete is, obviously,
quite limited.

~HEATING CONCRETE MATERIALS.~--Heating the sand, stone and mixing water acts both to hasten
the setting and to lengthen the time before the mixture becomes cold enough to freeze. At temperatures
not greatly below freezing the combined effects are sufficient to ensure the setting of the
concrete before it can freeze. More specific data of efficiency are difficult to arrive at.
There are no test data that show how long it takes a concrete mixture at a certain temperature
to lose its heat and become cold enough to freeze at any specific temperature of the surrounding
air, and a theoretical calculation of this period is so beset with difficulties as to be impracticable.
Strength tests of concrete made with heated materials have shown clearly enough that the heating
has no effect worth mentioning on either strength or durability. Either the water, the sand,
the aggregate or all three may be heated; usually the cement is not heated but it may be if
desired.

~Portable Heaters.~--An ordinary half cylinder of sheet steel set on the ground like an arch
is the simplest form of sand heater. A wood fire is built under the arch and the sand to be
heated is heaped on the top and sides. The efficiency of this device may be improved by closing
one end of the arch and adding a short chimney stack, but even the very crude arrangement of
sheets of corrugated iron bent to an arc will do good service where the quantities handled
are small. This form of heater may be used for stone or gravel in the same manner as for sand.
It is inexpensive, simple to operate and requires only waste wood for fuel, but unless it is
fired with exceeding care the sand in contact with the metal will be burned. The drawings of
Fig. 40 show the construction of a portable heater for sand, stone and water used in constructing
concrete culverts on the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad. This device weighs 1,200
lbs., and costs about $50.

~Heating in Stationary Bins.~--The following arrangement for heating sand and gravel in large
quantities in bins was employed in constructing the Foster-Armstrong Piano Works at Rochester,
N. Y. The daily consumption of sand and gravel on this work was about 50 cu. yds. and 100 cu.
yds., respectively. To provide storage for the sand and gravel, a bin 16 ft. square in projected
plan was constructed with vertical sides and a sloping bottom as illustrated in Fig. 41. This
bin was divided by a vertical partition into a large compartment for gravel and a small compartment
for sand and was provided with two grates of boiler tubes arranged as shown. These grates caused
V-shaped cavities to be formed beneath in the gravel and sand. Into these cavities penetrated
through one end of the bin 6-in. pipes from a hot air furnace and 1-in. pipes from a steam
boiler. The hot air pipes merely pass through the wall but the steam pipes continue nearly
to the opposite side of the bin and are provided with open crosses at intervals along their
length. In addition to the conduits described there is a small pipe for steam located below
and near the bottom of the bin. The hot air pipes connected with a small furnace and air was
forced through them by a Sturtevant No. 6 blower. The steam pipes connected with the boiler
of a steam heating system installed to keep the buildings warm during construction.

~Other Examples of Heating Materials.~--In the construction of the power plant of the Billings
(Mont.) Water Power Co., practically all of the concrete work above the main floor level was
put in during weather so cold that it was necessary to heat both the gravel and water used.
A sand heater was constructed of four 15-ft. lengths of 15-in. cast iron pipe, two in series
and the two sets placed side by side. This gave a total length of 30 ft. for heating, making
it possible to use the gravel from alternate ends and rendering the heating process continuous.
The gravel was dumped directly on the heater, thus avoiding the additional expense of handling
it a second time. The heater pipes were laid somewhat slanting, the fire being built in the
lower end. A 10-ft. flue furnished sufficient draft for all occasions. With this arrangement
it was possible to heat the gravel to a temperature of 80° or 90° F. even during the coldest
weather. Steam for heating the water was available from the plant. The temperature at which
the concrete was placed in the forms was kept between 65° and 75° F. This was regulated by
the man on the mixer platform by varying the temperature of the water to suit the conditions
of the gravel. When the ingredients were heated in this manner it was found advisable to mix
the concrete "sloppy," using even more water than would be commonly used in the so-called "sloppy"
concrete. No difficulty was experienced with temperature cracks if the concrete, when placed,
was not above 75° F. All cracks of this nature which did appear were of no consequence, as
they never extended more than ½ in. below the surface. The concrete was placed in as large
masses as possible. It was covered nights with sacks and canvas and, when the walls were less
than 3 ft. in width, the outside of the forms was lagged with tar paper. An air space was always
left between the surface of the concrete and the covering. Under these conditions there was
sufficient heat in the mass to prevent its freezing for several days, which was ample time
for permanent setting.

During the construction in 1902 of the Wachusett Dam at Clinton, Mass., for the Metropolitan
Water Works Commission the following procedures were followed in laying concrete in freezing
weather: After November 15 all masonry was laid in Portland cement, and after November 28 the
sand and water were heated and salt added in the proportion of 4 lbs. per barrel of cement.
The sand was heated in a bin, 16½×15½×10 ft. deep, provided with about 20 coils of 2-in. pipe,
passing around the inside of the bin. The sand, which was dumped in the top of the bin and
drawn from the bottom, remained there long enough to become warm. The salt for each batch of
mortar was dissolved in the water which was heated by steam; steam was also used to thaw ice
from the stone masonry. The laying of masonry was not started on mornings when the temperature
was lower than 18° F. above zero, and not even with this temperature unless the day was clear
and higher temperature expected. At the close of each day the masonry built was covered with
canvas.

In the construction of dams for Huronian Company's power development in Canada a large part
of the concrete work in dams, and also in power house foundations, was done in winter, with
the temperature varying from a few degrees of frost to 15 degrees below zero, and on several
occasions much lower. No difficulty was found in securing good concrete work, the only precaution
taken being to heat the mixing water by turning a ¾-in. steam pipe into the water barrel supplying
the mixer, and, during the process of mixing, to use a jet of live steam in the mixer, keeping
the cylinder closed by wooden coverings during the process of mixing. No attempt was made to
heat sand or stone. In all the winter work care was taken to use only cement which would attain
its initial set in not more than 65 minutes.

In constructing a concrete arch bridge at Plano, Ill., the sand and gravel were heated previous
to mixing and the mixed concrete after placing was kept from freezing by playing a steam jet
from a hose connected with the boiler of the mixer on the surface of the concrete until it
was certain that initial set had taken place. Readings taken with thermometers showed that
in no instance did the temperature of the concrete fall below 32° F. within a period of 10
or 12 hours after placing.

From experience gained in doing miscellaneous railway work in cold weather Mr. L. J. Hotchkiss
gives the following:

"For thin reinforced walls, it is not safe to rely on heating the water alone or even the water
and sand, but the stone also must be heated and the concrete when it goes into the forms should
be steaming hot. For mass walls the stone need not be heated except in very cold weather. Where
concrete is mixed in small quantities the water can be heated by a wood fire, and if a wood
fire be kept burning over night on top of the piles of stone and sand a considerable quantity
can be heated. The fire can be kept going during the day and moved back on the pile as the
heated material is used. This plan requires a quantity of fuel which in most cases is prohibitive
and is not sufficient to supply a power mixer. For general use steam is far better.

"A convenient method is to build a long wooden box 8 or 10 in. square with numerous holes bored
in its sides. This is laid on the ground, connected with a steam pipe and covered with sand,
stone or gravel. The steam escaping through the holes in the box will heat over night a pile
of sand, or sand and gravel, 8 or 10 ft. high. Perforated pipes can be substituted for boxes.
Material can be heated more rapidly if the steam be allowed to escape in the pile than if it
is confined in pipes which are not perforated. Crushed stone requires much more heat than sand
or sand and gravel mixed because of the greater volume of air spaces. In many cases material
which has already been unloaded must be heated. The expense of putting steam boxes or pipes
under it is considerable. To avoid this one or more steam jets may be used, the end of the
jet pipe being pushed several feet into the pile of material. If the jets are connected up
with steam hose they are easily moved from place to place. It is difficult to heat stone in
this way except in moderate weather.

"On mass work and at such temperatures as are met with in this latitude (Chicago, Ill.) it
is not usually necessary to protect concrete which has been placed hot except in the top of
the form. This can be done by covering the top of the form with canvas and running a jet of
steam under it. If canvas is not available boards and straw or manure answer the purpose. If
heat is kept on for 36 hours after completion, this is sufficient, except in unusually cold
weather. The above treatment is all that is required for reinforced retaining walls of ordinary
height. But where box culverts or arches carrying heavy loads must be placed in service as
soon as possible, the only safe way is to keep the main part of the structure warm until the
concrete is thoroughly hardened. Forms for these structures can be closed at the ends and stoves
or salamanders kept going inside, or steam heat may be used. The outside may be covered with
canvas or boards, and straw and steam jets run underneath. After the concrete has set enough
to permit the removal of the outer forms of box culverts, fires may be built near the side
walls and the concrete seasoned rapidly. Where structures need not be loaded until after the
arrival of warm weather, heat may be applied for 36 hours, and the centering left in place
until the concrete has hardened. Careful inspection of winter concrete should be made before
loads are applied. In this connection it may be noted that concrete which has been partly seasoned
and then frozen, closely resembles thoroughly seasoned concrete. Pieces broken off with a smooth
fracture through all the stones and showing no frost marks, when thawed out, can be broken
with the hands."

In building Portland cement concrete foundations for the West End St. Ry., Boston, and the
Brooklyn Heights R. R., much of the work was done in winter. A large watertight tank was constructed,
of such size that three skips or boxes of stone could be lowered into it. The tank was filled
with water, and a jet of steam kept the water hot in the coldest weather. The broken stone
was heated through to the temperature of the water in a few minutes. One of the stone boxes
was then hoisted out, and dumped on one side of the mixing machine, and then run through the
machine with sand, cement and water. The concrete was wheeled to place without delay and rammed
in 12-in. layers. The heat was retained until the cement was set. In severely cold weather
the sand was heated and the mixing water also. A covering of hay or gunnysacks may be used.

~COVERING AND HOUSING THE WORK.~--Methods of covering concrete to protect it from light frosts
such as may occur over night will suggest themselves to all; sacking, shavings, straw, etc.,
may all be used. Covering wall forms with tar paper nailed to the studding so as to form with
the lagging a cellular covering is an excellent device and will serve in very cold weather
if the sand and stone have been heated. From these simple precautions the methods used may
range to the elaborate systems of housing described in the following paragraphs.

~Method of Housing in Dam, Chaudiere Falls, Quebec.~--In constructing a dam for the water power
plant at Chaudiere Falls, P. Q., the work was housed in. The wing dam and its end piers aggregated
about 250 ft. in length by about 20 ft. in width. A house 100 ft. long and 24 ft. wide was
constructed in sections about 10 ft. square connected by cleats with bolts and nuts. This house
was put up over the wing dam. It was 20 ft. high to the eaves, with a pitched roof, and the
ends were closed up; in the roof on the forebay side were hatchways with sliding doors along
the whole length. Small entrance doors for the workmen were provided in the ends of the building.
The house was heated by a number of cylindrical sheet-iron stoves about 18 ins. in diameter
by 24 ins. high, burning coke; thermometers placed at different points in the shed gave warning
to stop work when the temperature fell below freezing, which, however, rarely occurred. Mixing
boards were located in the shed, and concrete, sand and broken stone were supplied in skipfuls
by guy derricks located in the forebay, which passed the material through the hatchways in
the roof, the proper hatchway being opened for the purpose and quickly closed. The mortar was
first mixed on a board, and then a skip-load of stone was dumped into the middle of the batch
and the whole well mixed. The water was made lukewarm by introducing a steam-jet into several
casks which were kept full. The sand was heated outside in the forebay on an ordinary sand
heater. The broken stone was heated in piles by a steam-jet; a pipe line on the ground was
made up of short lengths of straight pipe alternating with T-sections--turned up. The stone
was piled 3 to 4 ft. deep over the pipe and a little steam turned into the pipe. Several such
piles kept going all the time supplied enough stone for the work; the stone was never overheated,
and was moist enough not to dry out the mortar when mixed with it. In this manner the concreting
was successfully carried on and the wing dam built high enough to keep high water out of the
forebay.

Some danger from freezing was also encountered the next season, when the last part of the wing
dam was being constructed. This work was done when the temperature was close to freezing, and
it became necessary to keep the freshly placed concrete warm over night. This was done by covering
the work loosely with canvas, under which the nozzle of a steam hose was introduced. By keeping
a little steam going all night the concrete was easily kept above freezing temperature.

~Method of Housing in Building Work.~--The following method of housing in building work is
used by Mr. E. L. Ransome. The feature of the system is that the enclosing structure is made
up of a combination of portable units which can be used over and over again in different jobs.
The construction is best explained in connection with sketches.

Figure 43 shows a first floor wall column with the wall girder surmounting it and the connecting
floor system. It will be seen that the open sides are enclosed by canvas curtains and the floor
slab is covered with wood shutters. The curtains are composed of separate pieces so devised
that they may be attached to each other by means of snaps and eyes; one of these curtain units
is shown by Fig. 42. Referring now to Fig. 43, the curtain A is held by the tying-rings to
a continuous string piece B, the upper portion or flap D being held down by a metal bar or
other heavy object so as to lap over the floor covers E. The lower edge of the curtain is attached
to the string piece C. The sketch has been made to show how the curtain adjusts itself to irregular
projections such as the supports for a wall girder form; to prevent the curtain tearing on
such projections it is well to cover or wrap the rough edges with burlap, bagging or other
convenient material. The details of the wooden floor covers are shown by Fig. 44; they are
constructed so as to give a hollow space between them and the floor and holes are left in the
floor slab as at H, Fig. 43, to permit the warm air from below to enter this hollow space.
This warm air is provided by heating the enclosed story of the building by any convenient adequate
means. In constructing factory buildings, 50×200 ft. in plan at Rochester, N. Y., Mr. Ransome
used a line of 3/4 to 3/8-in. steam pipe located at floor level and running around all four
sides and a similar line running lengthwise of the building at the center, these pipes discharging
live steam through openings into the enclosed space. In addition to the steam piping 10 braziers
in which coke fires were kept were scattered around the floor. This equipment kept the enclosed
story, 50×100 ft.×13 ft. high, at a temperature of 80° F. and at temperature of about 40° F.
between the floor top and its board covering. The work was not stopped at any time because
of cold and the temperatures outside ranged from zero to 10° above.

CHAPTER VIII.

METHODS AND COST OF FINISHING CONCRETE SURFACES.

Good design in concrete as well as in steel, masonry and wood, requires that the structure
shall be good to look at. This means that the proportions must be good and that the surface
finish must be pleasing. Good proportions are a matter of design but a pleasing surface finish
is a matter of construction. Many, perhaps the majority of, concrete structures do not have
a pleasing surface finish; the surface is irregular, uneven in texture, and stained or discolored
or of lifeless hue. The reasons for these faults and the possible means of remedying them are
matters that concern the construction engineer and the contractor.

Imperfections in the surface of concrete are due to one or more of the following causes: (1)
Imperfectly made forms; (2) imperfectly mixed concrete; (3) carelessly placed concrete; (4)
use of forms with dirt or cement adhering to the boards; (5) efflorescence and discoloration
of the surface after the forms are removed.

~IMPERFECTLY MADE FORMS.~--In well mixed and placed concrete the film of cement paste which
flushes to the surface will take the impress of every flaw in the surface of the forms. It
will even show the grain marks in well dressed lumber. From this it will be seen how very difficult
it is so to mold concrete that the surface will not bear evidence of the mold used. The task
is impracticable of perfect accomplishment and the degree of perfection to which it can be
carried depends upon the workmanship expended in form construction. Forms with a smooth and
even surface are difficult and expensive to secure. It is impracticable in the first place
to secure lagging boards dressed to exact thickness and in the second place it is impracticable
to secure perfect carpenter work; joints cannot be got perfectly close and a nail omitted here
or there leaves a board free to warp. From this point on the use of imperfectly sized lumber
and careless carpentry can go to almost any degree of roughness in the form work. Only approximately
smooth and unmarked concrete surfaces can be secured in plain wooden forms and this only with
the very best kind of form construction. So much for the limitations of form work in the matter
of securing surface finish. These limitations may be reduced in various ways. Joint marks may
be eliminated wholly or partly by pointing the joints with clay or mortar or by pasting strips
of paper or cloth over them, or the whole surface of the lagging can be papered; by the use
of oiled paper there will be little trouble from the paper sticking. Grain marks and surface
imperfections can be reduced by oiling the lumber so as to fill the pores or by first oiling
and then filling the coat of oil with fine sand blown or cast against the boards.

The preceding remarks are of course based on the assumption that as nearly as possible a smooth
and even surface finish is desired. If something less than this is sufficient, and in many
cases it is, form produced surface defects become negligible in the proportion that they do
not exceed the standards of roughness and irregularity considered permissible by the engineer
and these standards are individual with the engineer; what one considers excessive roughness
and irregularity another may consider as amply even and smooth. The point to be kept in mind
is that beyond a certain state of evenness and regularity form produced surfaces are impracticable
to obtain, because to construct forms of the necessary perfection to obtain them costs far
more than it does to employ special supplementary finishing processes.

Surface blemishes due to dirt or cement adhering to the form boards have no excuse if the engineer
or contractor cares to avoid them. It is a simple matter to keep the lagging clean and free
from such accumulations.

~IMPERFECT MIXING AND PLACING.~--Imperfectly mixed and placed concrete gives irregularly colored,
pitted and honeycombed surfaces with here a patch of smooth mortar and there a patch of exposed
stone. Careful mixing and placing will avoid this defect, or all chance of it may be eliminated
by using surface coatings of special mixtures. There is no great difficulty, however, in obtaining
a reasonably homogeneous surface with concrete; the task merely requires that the mixing shall
be reasonably uniform and homogeneous and that in placing this mixture the spading next to
the lagging shall be done in such a way as to pull the coarse stones back and flush the mortar
to the surface. Spading forks are excellent for this purpose. A better tool is a special spade
made with a perforated blade; this special spade costs $3.

~EFFLORESCENCE.~--Efflorescence is the term applied to the whitish or yellowish accumulations
which often appear on concrete surfaces. "Whitewash" is another name given to these blotches.
Efflorescence is due to certain salts leaching out of the concrete and accumulating into thin
layers where the water evaporates on the surface. These salts are most probably sulphates of
calcium and magnesium, both of which are contained in many cements and both of which are slightly
soluble in water. Efflorescence is very erratic in its appearance. Some concretes never exhibit
it; in some it may not appear for several years, and in others it shows soon after construction
and may appear in great quantities. The most effective way to prevent efflorescence would naturally
be to use cements entirely free from sulphates, chlorides or whatever other soluble salts are
the cause of the phenomenon, but the likelihood of engineers resorting to the trouble of such
selection, except in rare instances, is not great, even if they knew what cements to select,
so that other means must be sought. The most common place for efflorescence to appear in walls
is at the horizontal junction of two days' work or where a coping is placed after the main
body of the wall has been completed. The reason of this seems to be that the salt solutions
seep down through the concrete until they strike the nearly impervious film of cement that
forms on the top surface of the old concrete before the new is added, and then they follow
along this impervious film to the face of the wall. The authors have suggested that this cause
might be remedied by ending the day's work by a layer whose top has a slight slope down toward
the rear of the wall or perhaps by placing all the concrete in similarly sloping layers. Mr.
C. H. Cartlidge is authority for the statement that this leaching at joints can be largely
done away with by the simple process of washing the top surface of concrete which has been
allowed to set over night by scrubbing it with wire brushes in conjunction with thorough flushing
with a hose. But efflorescence frequently appears on the faces of walls built without construction
joints and in which a wet concrete is puddled in and not tamped in layers, and here other means
are obviously essential. Waterproofing the surface of the wall should be effective so long
as the waterproofing lasts; indeed one of the claims made for some of these waterproofing compounds
is that efflorescence is prevented. The various waterproofing mixtures capable of such use
will be found described in Chapter XXV. Failing in any or all of these methods of preventing
efflorescence the engineer must resort to remedial measures. The saline coating must be scraped,
or chipped, or better, washed away with acids.

Efflorescence was removed from a concrete bridge at Washington, D. C, by using hydrochloric
(muriatic) acid and common scrubbing brushes; 30 gals. of acid and 36 scrubbing brushes were
used to clean 250 sq. yds. of concrete. The acid was diluted with 4 or 5 parts water to 1 of
acid; water was constantly played with a hose on the concrete while being cleaned to prevent
penetration of the acid. One house-front cleaner and 5 laborers were employed, and the total
cost was $150, or 60 cts. per sq. yd. This high cost was due to the difficulty of cleaning
the balustrades. It is thought that the cost of cleaning the spandrels and wing walls did not
exceed 20 cts. per sq. yd. The cleaning was perfectly satisfactory. An experiment was made
with wire brushes without acid, but the cost was $2.40 per sq. yd. The flour removed by the
wire brushes was found by analysis to be silicate of lime. Acetic acid was tried in place of
muriatic, but required more scrubbing.

~SPADED AND TROWELED FINISHES.~--With wet-concrete and ordinarily good form construction a
reasonably good surface appearance can be obtained by spading and troweling. For doing the
spading a common gardener's hoe, straightened out so that the blade is nearly in line with
the handle will do good work. The blade of the tool is pushed down next to the lagging and
the stone pulled back giving the grout opportunity to flush to the face. Troweling, that is
troweling without grout wash, requires, of course, that the concrete be stripped before it
has become too hard to be worked. As troweling is seldom required except for tops of copings
and corners it is generally practicable to bare the concrete while it is still fairly green.
In this condition the edges of copings, etc., can be rounded by edging tools such as cement
sidewalk workers use.

~PLASTER AND STUCCO FINISH.~--The ordinary concrete surface with a film-like cement covering
will not hold plaster or stucco. To get proper adhesion the concrete surface must be scrubbed,
treated with acid or tooled before the plaster or stucco is applied and this makes an expensive
finish since either of the preliminary treatments constitutes a good finish by itself. When
a coarse grained facing is made of very dry mixtures, as described in a succeeding section,
it has been made to hold plaster very well on inside work. In general plaster and stucco finishes
can be classed as uncertain even when the concrete surface has been prepared to take them,
and when the concrete has not been so prepared such finishes can be classed as absolutely unreliable.

~MORTAR AND CEMENT FACING.~--Where a surface finish of fine texture or of some special color
or composition is desired the concrete is often faced with a coat of mortar or, sometimes,
neat cement paste or grout. Mortar facing is laid from 1 to 2 ins. thick, usually 1½-ins.,
the mortar being a 1-1, 1-2 or 1-3 mixture and of cement and ordinary sand where no special
color or texture is sought. This facing often receives a future special finish as described
in succeeding sections, but it is more usually used as left by the forms or at best with only
a troweling or brushing with grout. Engineers nearly always require that the mortar facing
and the concrete backing shall be constructed simultaneously. This is accomplished by using
facing forms, two kinds of which are shown by Figs. 45 and 46. In use the sheet steel plates
are placed on edge the proper distance back of the lagging and the space between them and the
lagging is filled with the facing mortar. The concrete backing is then filled in to the height
of the plate, which is then lifted vertically and the backing and facing thoroughly bonded
by tamping them together. The form shown by Fig. 46, though somewhat the more expensive, is
the preferable one, since the attached ribs keep the plate its exact distance from the lagging
without any watching by the men, while the flare at the top facilitates filling. The facing
mortar has to be rather carefully mixed; it must be wet enough to work easily and completely
into the narrow space and yet not be so soft that in tamping the backing the stones are easily
forced through it. Also since the facing cannot proceed faster than the backing the mortar
has to be mixed in small batches so that it is always fresh. A cubic yard of mortar will make
216 sq. ft. of 1½-in. facing. Cement facing is seldom made more than 1 in. thick. If placed
as a paste the process is essentially the same as for placing mortar. When grout is used a
form is not used; place and tamp the concrete in 6 to 8-in layers, then shove a common gardener's
spade down between the concrete and the lagging and pull back the concrete about an inch and
pour the opening full of grout and withdraw the spade. If this work is carefully done there
will be very few stones showing when the forms are removed. When stiff pastes or mortars are
used the contractor often places the facing by plastering the lagging just ahead of the concreting;
this process requires constant watching to see that the plaster coat does not slough or peel
off before it is backed up with concrete.

~SPECIAL FACING MIXTURES FOR MINIMIZING FORM MARKS.~--The ordinary facing mixture of mortar
or cement is so fine grained and plastic that it readily takes the impress of every irregularity
in the form lagging; where a particularly good finish is desired this makes necessary subsequent
finishing treatments. To avoid these subsequent treatments and at the same time to reduce the
form marks, special facing mixtures, which will not take the imprint of and which will minimize
rather than exaggerate every imperfection in the forms, have been used with very considerable
success in the concrete work done for the various Chicago, Ill., parks. The mixture used consists
usually of 1 part cement, 3 parts fine limestone screenings and 3 parts ¾-in. crushed limestone;
these materials are mixed quite dry so no mortar will flush to the surface when rammed hard.
With moderately good form work the imprint of the joints is hardly noticeable and grain marks
do not show at all. For thin building walls the special mixture is used throughout the wall,
but for more massive structures it is used only for the facing.

~GROUT WASHES.~--Grout finishes serve only to fill the small pits and pores in the surface
coating; cavities or joint lines, if any exist, must be removed by plastering or rubbing before
the grout is applied or else by applying the grout by rubbing. In ordinary work the grout is
applied with a brush after the holes have been plastered and the joint marks rubbed down. The
grout to be applied with a brush should be about the consistency of whitewash; a 1 cement 2
sand mixture is a good one. Where a more perfect finish of dark color is desired the grout
of neat cement and lampblack in equal parts may be applied as follows: Two coats with a brush,
the second coat after the first has dried, and one coat by sweeping with a small broom. The
broom marks give a slightly rough surface. Instead of a liquid grout a stiff grout or semi-liquid
mortar applied with a trowel or float can be used. In this case the grout should be applied
in a very thin coat and troweled or floated so that only the pores are filled and no body of
mortar left on the surface or else it will scale off. A more expensive but very superior grout
finish is obtained by rubbing and scouring the wet grout into the surface with cement mortar
bricks, carborundum bricks, or such like abrasive materials. A 1 cement 1 sand mortar brick,
with a handle molded into it, and having about the dimensions of an ordinary building brick
makes a good tool for rubbing down joint marks as well as for applying grout.

~FINISHING BY SCRUBBING AND WASHING.~--A successful finish for concrete structures consists
in removing the forms while the concrete is green and then scrubbing the surface with a brush
and water until the film of cement is removed and the clean sand or stone left exposed. This
method has been chiefly used in concrete work done by the city of Philadelphia, Pa., Mr. Henry
M. Quimby, Bridge Engineer. Figure 47 shows an example of scrubbed finish, but of course the
texture or color of the surface will vary with the character of the face mixture and the hue
of the sand or chips used. Warm tones can be secured by the use of crushed brick or red gravel;
a dark colored stone with light sand gives a color much resembling granite; fine gravel or
coarse sand gives a texture like sandstone. In much of this work done in Philadelphia a mixture
composed of 1 part cement, 2 parts bank sand and 3 parts crushed and cleaned black, slaty shale
from 3/8 to 1/4 in. in size, has been used with good results both in appearance and in durability.
The scrubbing is done with an ordinary house scrubbing brush at the same time flushing the
concrete with water from a sponge or bucket or, preferably, from a hose. In general the washing
is done on the day following the placing of the concrete but the proper time depends upon the
rapidity with which the concrete sets. In warm weather 24 hours after placing is generally
about right, but in cold weather 48 hours may be required, and in very cold weather the concrete
has been left to set a week and the scrubbing has been successful. With the concrete in just
the proper condition a few turns of the brush with plenty of water will clean away the cement,
but if a little too hard wire brushes must be used and if still harder a scouring brick or
an ordinary brick with sand is necessary to cut the cement film. The process requires that
the forms shall be so constructed that the lagging can be removed when the concrete has reached
the proper age for treatment. Mr. Quimby sets the studs 8 to 12 ins. from the face and braces
the lagging boards against them by cleats nailed so as to be easily loosened. His practice
is to use boards in one width the full depth of the course and to nail a triangular bead strip
to the face at each edge. These bead strips mark the joints between courses as shown by Fig.
48. When a "board" is taken off it is cleaned and oiled and reset for a new course by inserting
the bottom bead strip in the half indentation left by the top bead in the concrete. This is,
of course, for work of such size that one course is a day's work of concreting. In such work,
two carpenters with perhaps one helper will remove a course of "boards" say 100 ft. long in
from 4 to 8 hours. While forms of the kind described cost more to construct there is a saving
by repeated re-use of the lagging boards. The indentations or beads marking the courses serve
perfectly to conceal the construction joints. The cost of scrubbing varies with the hardness
of the concrete; when in just the right condition for effective work one man can scrub 100
sq. ft. in an hour; on the other hand it has taken one man a whole day to scrub and scour the
same area when the concrete was allowed to get hard.

~FINISHING BY ETCHING WITH ACID.~--The acid etched or acid wash process of finishing concrete
consists in first washing the surface with an acid preparation to remove the surface cement
and expose the sand and stone, then with an alkaline solution to remove all free acid, and
finally, with clear water in sufficient volume to cleanse and flush the surface thoroughly.
The work can be done at any time after the forms are removed and does not require skilled labor;
any man with enough judgment to determine when the etching has progressed far enough can do
the work. This process has been very extensively used in Chicago by the South Park Commission,
Mr. Linn White, Engineer. In this work the concrete is faced with a mixture of cement, sand
and stone chips, any stone being used that is not affected by acid. Limestone is excluded.
Where some color is desired the facing can be mixed with mineral pigments or with colored sand
or stone chips. This acid wash process has been patented, the patentees being represented by
Mr. J. K. Irvine, Sioux City, Ia.

~TOOLING CONCRETE SURFACES.~--Concrete surfaces may be bush-hammered or otherwise tool finished
like natural stone, exactly the same methods and tools being used. Tooling must wait, however,
until the concrete has become fairly hard. As the result of his experience in tooling some
43,000 sq. ft. of concrete, Mr. W. J. Douglas states that the concrete should be at least 30
days old and, preferably, 60 days old, if possible, when bush-hammered. There is a great variation
in the costs given for tooling concrete. Mr. C. R. Neher states that a concrete face can be
bush-hammered by an ordinary laborer at the rate of 100 sq. ft. in 10 hours or at a cost of
1½ cts. per square foot with wages at 15 cts. per hour. Mr. E. L. Ransome states that bush-hammering
costs from 1½ to 2½ cts. per square foot, wages of common laborers being 15 cts. per hour.
The walls of the Pacific Borax Co.'s factory at Bayonne, N. J., were dressed by hand at the
rate of 100 to 200 sq. ft. per man per day; using pneumatic hammer one man was able to dress
from 300 to 600 sq. ft. per day. In constructing the Harvard Stadium the walls were dressed
with pneumatic hammers fitted with a tool with a saw-tooth cutting blade like an ice chopper.
Men timed by one of the authors on a visit to this work were dressing wall surface at the rate
of 50 sq. ft. per hour, but the contractor stated that the average work per man per day was
200 sq. ft. Common laborers were employed. The average cost of bush-hammering some 43,000 sq.
ft. of plain and ornamental blocks for the Connecticut Avenue Bridge at Washington, D. C, was
26 cts. per square foot. Both pneumatic tools and hand tooling were employed and the work of
both is lumped in the above cost, but hand tooling cost about twice as much as machine tooling.
The work was done by high-priced men, foremen stone cutters at $5 per day and stone cutters
at $4 per day. Moreover a grade of work equal to the best bush-hammered stone work was demanded.
Full details of the cost of this work are given in Chapter XVII. Mr. H. M. Quimby states that
the cost of tooling concrete runs from 3 cts. to 12 cts. per square foot, according to the
character and extent of the work and the equipment.

~GRAVEL OR PEBBLE SURFACE FINISH.~--An effective variation of the ordinary stone concrete surface
is secured by using an aggregate of rounded pebbles of nearly uniform size and by scrubbing
or etching remove the cement enough to leave the pebbles about half exposed at the surface.
In constructing a bridge at Washington, D. C, the concrete was a 1-2-5 gravel mixture of 1½
to 2-in. pebbles for the spandrels and arch ring face and of 1-in. pebbles for the parapet
walls. The forms were removed while the concrete was still green and the cement scrubbed from
around the faces and sides of the pebbles using wire brushes and water. Tests showed that at
12 hours age the concrete was not hard enough to prevent the pebbles from being brushed loose
and that at 36 hours age it was too hard to permit the mortar to be scrubbed away without excessive
labor; the best results were obtained when the concrete was about 24 hours old.

~COLORED FACING.~--Where occasion calls for concrete of a color or tint other than is obtained
by the use of the ordinary materials either an aggregate of a color suitable for the purpose
may be used or the mixture may be colored by the addition of some mineral pigment. The first
method is by all odds the preferable one; it gives a color which will endure for all time and
it in no way injures the strength or durability of the concrete. Mineral pigments may be secured
from any of several well-known firms who make them for coloring concrete, and they may be had
in almost every shade. Directions for using these colors can be had from the makers. All but
a very few of these mineral colors injure the strength and durability of the concrete if used
in amounts sufficient to produce the desired color and all of them fade in time. The best method
of producing a colored mortar or concrete facing is to mix the cement with screenings produced
by crushing a natural stone of the desired color.

CHAPTER IX.

METHODS AND COST OF FORM CONSTRUCTION.

Concrete being a plastic material when deposited requires molds or forms to give it the shape
required and to maintain it in that shape until it has hardened to sufficient strength to require
no exterior support. The material used in constructing forms is wood. Beyond the use of metal
molds for building blocks for sewer construction and for ornamental and a few architectural
shapes, iron and steel are used in form construction only as ties and clamps to hold parts
of wood forms together--except in rare instances. A discussion of form construction, therefore,
is essentially a discussion of wood forms.

Before taking up this discussion, however, attention deserves to be called to the opportunities
for the development of metal forms. Lumber is costly and is growing more scarce and costly
all the time. A substitute which can be repeatedly used and whose durability and salvage value
are great presents itself in steel if only a system of form units can be devised which is reasonably
adjustable to varying conditions. Cylindrical steel column molds have been used to some extent
and are discussed in Chapter XIX. In Chapter XVI we describe a steel form for side walls of
a tunnel lining. In some building work done in the northwest corrugated steel panels or sheets
have been used as lagging for floor slab centers. A number of styles of metal forms or centers
for sewer and tunnel work have been devised and used and are discussed in Chapter XXI. Despite
this considerable use of metal for special forms nothing approaching its general use like wood
has been attempted, and the field lies wide open for invention.

The economics of form construction deserve the most serious attention of the engineer and contractor.
It is seldom that form work, outside of very massive foundation construction, costs less than
50 cts. per cubic yard of concrete in place, and it is not unusual in the more complex structures
for it to cost $5 per cubic yard of concrete in place. These costs include the cost of materials
and of framing, handling and removing the forms but they do not embrace extremely high or low
costs. It is evident without further demonstration that time spent in planning economic form
construction for any considerable job of concrete work is time spent profitably.

In the following sections we review the general considerations which enter into all form work.
Specific details of construction and specific costs of form work are given in succeeding chapters
where each class of concrete work is discussed separately. This chapter is intended principally
to familiarize the reader with general principles governing form work.

~EFFECT OF DESIGN ON FORM WORK.~--The designing engineer can generally aid largely in reducing
the cost of form work if he will. This is particularly true in building work in which, also,
form costs run high. By arranging his beam spacing and sizes with a little care he will enable
the contractor to use his forms over and over and thus greatly reduce the expense for lumber.
In the same way columns may be made of dimensions which will avoid frequent remaking of column
forms. Panel recesses in walls may be made the thickness of a board or plank, instead of some
odd depth that will require a special thickness of lumber, or beams may be made of such size
that certain dimension widths of lumber can be used without splitting. In general, carpenter
work costs more than concrete and where a little excess concrete may be contributed to save
carpenter work it pays to contribute it. The figures given in Chapter XIX, showing the reduction
in lumber cost coming from using the same material over a second or third time, should be studied
in this connection. The leading firms of engineering-contractors which both design and construct
reinforced concrete buildings fully realize these opportunities and take advantage of them,
but the general practitioner, particularly if he be an architect, does not do so. The authors
have personal knowledge of one building in which a slight change in spacing and dimensions
of beams--a change that would have been of no architectural or structural significance--would
have reduced the successful contractor's bid for the work by $10,000. The designing engineer
should hold it as a cardinal point in design that form work, and we will add here reinforcement
also, should so far as possible be made interchangeable from bay to bay and from floor to floor.

~KIND OF LUMBER.~--The local market and the character of the work generally determine the kind
of lumber to be used for forms. The hardwoods are out of the question for form construction
because they cost too much and are too hard to work. Among the soft woods white pine costs
too much for general use and hemlock is unreliable when exposed to the weather. This reduces
the list generally available to spruce, Norway pine and the southern pines. Neither green nor
kiln-dried lumber is so good as partially dry stuff, since the kiln-dried lumber swells and
crushes or bulges the joints and green lumber does not swell enough to close the joints. Forms
have to withstand, temporarily, very heavy loads, therefore, knots, shakes and rot must be
watched after. The choosing of good lumber is a simple process and the contractor who wants
to be able to rely on his forms will look after it carefully, without going to extremes which
the work does not warrant.

~FINISH AND DIMENSIONS OF LUMBER.~--Dressing the lumber serves four important purposes: It
permits the forms to be constructed more nearly true to line and surface; it permits tighter
joint construction; it gives a smoother surface finish to the concrete, and it facilitates
the removal and cleaning of the forms. Undressed lumber may be used for the backs of walls
and abutments, for work below ground and wherever a smooth and true surface is unimportant;
there are some contractors, however, who prefer lumber dressed on one side even for these purposes
because of the smaller cost of cleaning. For floor and wall forms the lumber should always
be dressed on one side; where the work is very particular both sides should be dressed, and
in special cases the sides of the joists or studs against which the lagging lies may be dressed.
For ordinary work a square edge finish does well enough but for fine face work a tongue and
groove or bevel edge finish is preferable. The tongue and groove finish gives a somewhat tighter
joint on first laying but it does not take up swelling or resist wear so well as the bevel
edge finish.

When ordering new lumber for forms the contractor will save much future work and waste if he
does it from plans. Timber cut to length and width to go directly into the forms reduces both
mill and carpenter work on the site, and in many cases it can be so ordered if ordered from
plans. Waste is another item that is reduced by ordering from plans; with lumber costing its
present prices crop ends run into money very rapidly. When old lumber from a previous job is
to be used the contractor can only make the best of his stock, but even here form plans will
result in saving. Sort and pile the old lumber according to sizes and make a schedule of the
quantity of each size on hand; this schedule in the hands of the man who designs the forms
and of the head carpenter will materially reduce waste and carpenter work. It is often possible
especially in making concrete foundations for frame buildings to use lumber for forms which
is subsequently used for floor beams, etc., in the building.

Contractors differ greatly in their ideas of the proper thickness of lumber to use for various
parts of form work. Generally speaking 1¼ to 2-in. stuff is used for wall lagging held by studding
and 1-in. stuff when built into panels; for floor lagging 1-in stuff with joists spaced up
to 24 ins. or when built into panels; for column lagging 1¼ to 2-in. stuff; for sides of girders
1, 1¼, 1½ and 2-in. stuff are all used; and for bottoms of girders, 1½ and 2-in. stuff. These
figures are by no means invariable as a study of the numerous examples of actual form work
given throughout this book will show.

~COMPUTATION OF FORMS.~--If the minimum amount of lumber consistent with a given deflection
is to be used in form work the sizes and spacing of the supporting members must be actually
computed for the loading. As a practical matter of fact the amount of material used and the
arrangement of the supports are often subject to requirements of unit construction, clearance,
staging, etc., which supersede the matter of economical adaptation of material to loading.
The designing of form work is at best, therefore, a compromise between rules of thumb and scientific
calculation. In wall work empirical methods are nearly always followed. In girder and floor
slab work, on the other hand, design is commonly based on computation.

In the matter of loads the general practice is to assume the weight of concrete as a liquid
at some amount which it is considered will also cover the weight of men, barrows, runways and
current construction materials. The assumed weights vary. One prominent engineering firm assumes
the load to be the dead weight of concrete as a liquid and the load due to placing and specifies
that the forms shall be designed to carry this load without deflection. Mr. W. J. Douglas,
Engineer of Bridges, Washington, D. C, assumes for lateral thrust on wall forms that concrete
is a liquid of half its own weight, or 75 lbs. per cu. ft. Mr. Sanford E. Thompson, Consulting
Engineer, Newton Highlands, Mass., assumes for dead load, weight of concrete including reinforcement
as 154 lbs. per cu. ft., and for live load, 75 lbs. per sq. ft. on slabs and 50 lbs. per sq.
ft. in figuring beam and girder forms and struts.

The assumed safe stresses in form work may be taken somewhat higher than is usual in timber
construction, because of the temporary character of the load. In calculating beams the safe
extreme fiber stress may be assumed at 750 lbs. per sq. in. The safe stress in pounds per square
inch for struts or posts is shown by Table XV, compiled by Mr. Sanford E. Thompson. The sizes
of struts given are those most commonly used in form work.

TABLE XV.--SAFE STRENGTH OF TIMBER STRUTS FOR FRAME WORK.

                            --Dimensions of Strut.--

 6                 1,000       1,200      1,200      1,200

In using this table it must be borne in mind that bracing both ways reduces the length of a
long strut. For example, if a strut 24 ft. long be divided into three panels by bracing the
length of strut so far as the table is concerned is 8 ft.

As stated above wall forms are rarely computed. Experience has shown that the maximum spans
of various thicknesses of lagging between supports are: 1-in. boards, 24 ins.; 1½-in. plank,
4 ft., and 2-in. plank, 5 ft. Studding will vary in size from 2×4 to 4×6 ins., strutted and
braced horizontally to meet conditions. Column forms, like wall forms, are rarely computed,
yokes being spaced 2 ft. apart for 1¼-in. lagging up to 3 to 3½ ft. apart for 2-in. lagging.

Floor forms, including girder and slab forms, are computed on the basis of a maximum deflection
and not on the basis of strength. Sagging forms are liable to rupture the beam or slab. The
amount of deflection considered allowable varies from no deflection up to 3/8 to ½ in. Assuming
the deflection, permissible thickness of the timber necessary to carry the load is determined
by the formulas:

     d = 5 W l³ ÷ 384 E I       (1)

and

         bh³
     I = ---                 (2)
         12

Formula (1) is the familiar one for computing deflection for a beam supported (not fixed) at
the ends. Mr. Sanford F. Thompson suggests using the constant {3/384}, which is an approximate
mean between {1/384} that for beams with fixed ends and {5/384} that for beams with ends supported.
Formula (1) then becomes

     d = 3 W l³ ÷ 384 E I,

in which as above:

     d = maximum deflection in inches.
     W = total load on plank or joist.
     l = length between supports in inches.
     E = modulus of elasticity of lumber.
     I = moment of inertia of cross-section.
     b = breadth of lumber.
     h = depth of lumber.

The deflection, d, being assumed formula (1) is solved for I, moment of inertia. Substituting
the value of I in formula (2) we can readily estimate the size of joist or thickness of plank
to use.--For spruce, yellow pine and the other woods commonly used in form work E may be taken
equal to 1,300,000 lbs. per sq. in.

~DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.~--The main points to be kept in mind in the original design and construction
of forms are: Economy in lumber, economy in carpenter work, and economy in taking down, carrying
and re-erecting. Economy in lumber is not merely the matter of using the least amount of lumber
that will serve the purpose considering the form as an isolated structure. It may be possible
to build a column form, for example, of very light material which will serve to mold a single
column, but it is evident that we could better afford to use twice this amount of lumber if
by doing so we obtained a form which could be used over again to mold a second column; no more
lumber per column would be used while the cost of erecting a form already framed is less than
the cost of framing a new form. Economy in lumber in form construction involves, therefore,
recognition of the economies to be gained by repeated use of the lumber. A certain amount of
additional sturdiness is required in the shape of heavier form lumber and stronger framing
to provide for the wear and tear of repeated use, and it is always economy to provide it when
repeated use is possible. The thing can be overdone, however; there is an economical limit
to repeated use, as we demonstrate further on. In the matter of economy in carpenter work,
a certain amount of extra work put into framing the forms to withstand the stress of repeated
use is economically justifiable. Also carpenter work put into framing which substitutes clamps
and wedges for nails is sound economy; generally speaking a skillful form carpenter is recognized
by the scarcity of nails he uses. The possibility of reducing carpenter work by ordering lumber
to length and width from plans has already been mentioned. It is possible often to go a step
further by having certain standard panels, boxes, etc., made in regular shops. Piece work is
often possible and will frequently reduce framing costs. In designing for economy in taking
down, carrying and re-erecting forms a cardinal point should be that the work be such that
it can be executed by common laborers. This result can be very nearly approached by careful
design, even for form work that is quite complex, if a special gang is devoted to the work
and trained a little in the various operations. Design the forms so that they come apart in
units by simply removing bolts, clamps and wedges. They can then be taken down, carried and
erected by common laborers with a skilled man in charge to meet emergencies and to true and
line up the work.

In the matter of details the joints deserve particular attention. In column and girder forms,
generally, joints will be square or butt joints, and to get them tight the lumber must be dressed
true to edge. Tight joints are considered essential by many not only to avoid joint marks but
for the more important reason that otherwise, with wet mixtures, a honeycombed concrete is
produced by leakage. Where tight joints are desired tongue and groove stock or stock cut with
one edge beveled and the other square give the best results. The authors believe that the best
general satisfaction will be got from the bevel edge stock placed so that the bevel edge of
one board comes against the square edge of the next board; undue swelling then results in the
bevel edge cutting into the adjacent square edge without bulging. Tongues and grooves suffer
badly from breakage. As a matter of fact square edged stock, if well dressed and sized and
well filled with moisture, can be used and is used with entire success in nearly all kinds
of work. The leakage will be very slight with ordinarily good butt joints and so far as surface
appearance goes joint marks are more cheaply and more satisfactorily eliminated by other means
than attempting to get cabinet work in form construction. Where girder forms join columns or
beams connect with girders and at the angles of floor slabs with beams the edges or corners
of the forms should be rounded. The edges of beams and column corners will appear better if
beveled; a triangular strip in the corners of the forms will provide this bevel. Forms and
mold construction for ornamental work call for and are given special consideration in Chapter
XXIII. In conclusion, the reader should study the specific examples of form construction for
different purposes that are given throughout the book for hints as to special practice and details.

~UNIT CONSTRUCTION OF FORMS.~--Unit construction has a somewhat variable meaning in form work.
In wall and tank work and in some other kinds of work unit construction means the use of form
units which are gradually moved ahead or upward as the concreting progresses or of form units
which are used one after another in continuous succession as the concreting progresses. In
column, girder and floor work unit construction means the division of the form work as a whole
and also of the individual forms into independent structural units; thus in forms for a building
the column forms may be independent of the girder forms and also each column and girder form
be made up of several separate units. In all cases unit construction has for its purpose the
use of the same form or at least the same form lumber over and over for molding purposes. Every
time the use of the same form is repeated, the cost of form work per cubic yard of concrete
placed is reduced. The theoretical limit of economical repetition is then the limit of endurance
of the form, the practical limit, however, is something quite different. Most concrete work
varies in form or dimensions often enough to prevent the use of the same forms more than a
few times, and even if these variations did not exist the time element would enter to prevent
the same form or form lumber being used more than a certain number of times. Unit construction
to give repeated use of forming has, therefore, its economic limits. The significance of this
conclusion does not lie in any novelty that it possesses but in the fact that for any piece
of work it determines the labor that may profitably be expended in working out and constructing
form units.

~LUBRICATION OF FORMS.~--All forms for concrete require a coating of some lubricant to prevent
the concrete from adhering to the wood with which it comes in contact. Incidentally this coating
tends to give a smoother surface to the concrete and to preserve the wood against damage by
its alternate wetting and drying. The great value of lubrication is, however, that it reduces
the cost of removing forms. The requisite of a good coating material is that it shall be thin
enough to spread evenly and to fill the pores and grain of the wood. Crude oil or petroline
makes one of the best coatings, but various other greasy substances will serve. Where the forms
are not to be removed until the concrete has set hard a thorough wetting of the wood just before
the concrete is placed is all the coating necessary. Any concrete adhering to forms should
be thoroughly cleaned off before they are used again and the wood underneath given a special
heavy coating.

~FALSEWORKS AND BRACING.~--The falseworks which support the forms proper and stagings for workmen,
runways, material hoists, etc., do not call for any striking differences in construction and
arrangement from such work elsewhere. For wall forms inclined props reaching from ground to
studding are used for walls of moderate height such as retaining walls, wing walls, and abutments.
For building walls of some height a gallows frame arrangement or the common braced staging
used by masons and carpenters is used. In building construction, however, movable forms are
commonly employed for walls more than one story high and should always be employed above one
story to save staging timber. Column forms are seldom braced unless erected without connecting
girder or floor forms at their tops, and then only by diagonal props to the floor or ground.
Girder and floor supports usually consist of uprights set under the girder form at intervals
and occasionally under floor slab forms. The spacing of props and uprights will be regulated
by the judgment of the foreman and boss carpenter; no general rule is applicable, except that
enough lumber must be used to hold the forms rigid and true to line and level. The various
illustrations of actual formwork which follow are the best guides to good practice.

~TIME FOR AND METHOD OF REMOVING FORMS.~--No exact time schedule for removing forms is wise
in concrete work. Concrete which is mixed wet sets slower than dry concrete and concrete sets
slower in cold weather than it does in warm weather. Again the time of removal is influenced
by the risk taken by too early removal, and also by the nature of the stresses in the member
to be relieved of support. In all cases the forms should be removed as soon as possible so
that they can be used over again and so that the concrete may be exposed to the air to hasten
hardening. The following suggestions as to time of removal are general and must be followed
with judgment.

Using dry concrete in warm weather the forms for retaining walls, pedestals, isolated pillars,
etc., can be removed in 12 hours; using wet or sloppy concrete the time will be increased to
24 hours. In cold weather the setting is further delayed and inspection is the only safe guide
to follow. Very cold weather delays setting indefinitely. Forms for small arch work like sewers
and culverts may be removed in 18 to 24 hours if dry concrete is used, and in 24 to 48 hours
if wet concrete is used. The time for removing large arch centers should not be less than 14
days for spans up to 50 ft. if the arch is back-filled at once; when the center is not to be
used again it is better to let it stand 28 days. For very large arches the problem becomes
a special one and is considered in Chapter XVII. In building construction the following schedule
is a common one. Remove the column forms in 7 days and the sides of the girder forms and the
floor lagging in 14 days leaving the bottom boards of the girder forms and their supports in
place for 21 days.

As an example of individual practice the following requirements of a large firm of concrete
contractors are given:

Walls in mass work, 1 to 3 days, or until the concrete will bear pressure of the thumb without
indentation.

Thin walls, in summer, 2 days; in cold weather, 5 days.

Slabs up to 6-ft. span, in summer, 6 days; in cold weather, 2 weeks.

Beams and girders and long span slabs, in summer, 10 days or 2 weeks; in cold weather, 3 weeks
to 1 month. If shores are left without disturbing them, the time of removal of the sheeting
in summer may be reduced to 1 week.

Column forms, in summer, 2 days; in cold weather, 4 days, provided girders are shored to prevent
appreciable weight reaching columns.

Conduits, 2 or 3 days, provided there is not a heavy fill upon them.

Arches, of small size, 1 week; for large arches with heavy dead load, 1 month.

The method of removing forms will vary in detail with the character of the structure. With
proper design and lubrication of forms they will ordinarily come away from the concrete with
a moderate amount of sledge and bar work. If the work will warrant it, have a special gang
under a competent foreman for removing forms. The organization of this gang and the procedure
it should follow will vary with the nature of the form work, and they are considered in succeeding
chapters for each kind of work.

~ESTIMATING AND COST OF FORM WORK.~--It is common practice to record the cost of forms in cents
per cubic yard of concrete, giving separately the cost of lumber and labor. This should be
done, but the process of analysis should be carried further. The records should be so kept
as to show the first cost per 1,000 ft. B. M. of lumber, the number of times the lumber is
used, the labor cost of framing, the labor cost of erecting and the labor cost of taking down,
all expressed in M. ft. B. M. In this way only is it possible to compare the cost of forms
on different kinds of concrete work, and thus only can accurate predictions be made of the
cost of forms for concrete work having dimensions differing from work previously done. It is
well, also, to make a note of the number of square feet of exposed concrete surface to which
the forms are applied.

Some of the items mentioned demand brief explanation. Framing and erecting costs are kept separate
for the reason that the framing is done only once, whereas the erecting occurs two or more
times. The lumber cost, where the material is used more than once, can be computed in two ways.
An example will illustrate the two modes of procedure. In one of the buildings described in
Chapter XIX the lumber cost $30 per M. ft. B. M. and was used three times. As 34,000 ft. B.
M. were required to encase the 200 cu. yds. of concrete in one floor, including columns, it
would have required 34,000 ÷ 200 = 170 ft. B. M. of lumber at $30 per M. per cubic yard of
concrete if it had been used only once. But since it was used three times we may call it 170
ft. B. M. at $10 per M. per cubic yard of concrete, or we may call it 170 ÷ 3 = 57 ft. B. M.
at $30 per M. per cubic yard of concrete. The authors prefer the first method, due to the fact
that it is 170 ft. B. M. that is handled and taken down each time and it is more consistent
to have the lumber cost on the same basis thus:

170 ft. B. M. of lumber at $10 per M         $1.70
170 ft. B. M. handled at $2 per M             0.34
170 ft. B. M. erected at $7 per M             1.19
                                             -----
    Total 170 ft. B. M. per cu. yd           $3.23

Returning to our main thought, there are three ways of recording the cost of form work: (1)
In cents per cubic yard of concrete; (2) in cents per square foot of concrete face to which
forms are applied, and (3) in dollars per 1,000 ft. B. M. of lumber used. In all cases the
cost of materials and of labor should be kept separate. It is well if it can be done to attach
a sketch of the forms to the record. So much for the general method of recording costs in form
work.

In estimating the probable cost of forms for any job the following method will be found reliable:
Having the total cubic yards of concrete in the work and the time limit within which the work
must be completed determine the number of cubic yards that must be placed per day, making liberal
allowances for delays. Next estimate the number of thousands of feet board measure of forms
required to encase the concrete to be placed in a day. This will give the minimum amount of
lumber required, for it is seldom permissible to remove the forms until the concrete has hardened
over night. Now we come to the very important and puzzling question of the time element, particularly
in work where it is possible to use the same forms or the same form lumber two or more times.

It has already been pointed out that wet concrete sets more slowly than dry concrete; that
all concrete sets more slowly in cold than in warm weather, and that the support of forms is
necessary a longer time for pieces subject to bending stress like arches and girders. General
suggestions as to specific times for removing forms have also been given. Where the specifications
state the time of removal the contractor has a definite guide, but where they do not, as is
most often the case, he must depend very largely on judgment and previous experience. Another
matter which deserves consideration is the use of the forms as staging for runways or tracks.
Such use may result in forms having to stand on work for sake of their service as trestles
much longer than there is any necessity so far as supporting the concrete is concerned. A derrick
or cableway may often prove cheaper than tieing up form lumber by trying to make it serve the
double purpose of a trestle.

The possibilities of repeated use of forms and of unit construction of forms have already been
noted. This is the next point to be considered in estimating form lumber. At the expense of
a little planning movable forms can be used to materially reduce the amount of lumber required.
The reader is referred particularly to the chapters on retaining wall, conduit and building
work for specific data on movable form work.

Having estimated the amount of lumber required and the number of times it can be used the labor
cost of framing, erecting and taking down can be figured. In ordinary retaining wall work forms
will cost for framing and erection from $6 to $7 per M. ft. B. M. To tear down such forms carefully
and to carry the lumber a short distance will cost some $1.50 to $2 per M. ft. B. M. We have
then a cost of $7.50 to $9 per M. ft. B. M. for each time the forms are erected and torn down.
Where movable panels are used and the forms not ripped apart and put together again each time
there is of course only the cost of moving, which may run as low as 50 cts. per M. ft. B. M.
Framing and erecting centers for piers will run about the same as for retaining wall. At this
point it may be noted that in estimating the cost of forms for plain rectangular piers the
following method will give very accurate results. Ascertain the surface area of the four sides
of the pier. Multiply this area by 2, and the product will be the number of feet board measure
of 2-in. plank required. Add 40 per cent. to this, and the total will be the number of feet
board measure of 2-in. plank and of upright studs (4×6), spaced 2½ ft. centers. Sometimes 3×6-in.
studs are used, and spaced 2 ft. centers, which requires practically the same percentage (40
per cent.) of timber for the studs as where 4×6-in. studs are used and spaced 2½ ft. centers.
No allowance is made for timber to brace the studs, since, in pier work, it is customary to
hold the forms together either with bolts or with ordinary No. 9 telegraph wire, which weighs
0.06 lb. per foot. The foregoing data can be condensed into a rule that is easily remembered:

Multiply the number of square feet surface area of the sides and ends of a concrete pier by
2.8, and the product will be the number of feet board measure required for sheet plank and
studs for the forms.

If the form lumber can be used more than once, divide the number of feet board measure by the
number of times that it can be used, to ascertain the amount to be charged to each pier. Forms
can be erected and taken down for $8 per M. carpenters being paid $2.50 and laborers $1.50
a day. Since there are 2.8 ft. B. M. of forms per square foot of surface area of concrete to
be sheeted, it costs 2¼ cts. for the labor of carpenters per square foot of surface area to
be sheeted. If lumber is worth $24 per M., and is used three times, then the lumber itself
also costs 2¼ cts. per sq. ft. of surface area of concrete. By dividing the total number of
cubic yards of concrete into the total number of square feet of area of surface to be sheeted
with forms, the area per cubic yard is obtained. Multiply this area by 4½ cts., and the product
is the cost per cubic yard for material in the forms (assumed to be used three times) and the
labor of erecting it and taking it down.

Two general methods of concrete pile construction are available for engineering work. By one
method a hole is formed in the ground by driving a steel shell or by other special means and
this hole is filled with concrete. By the other method the pile is molded in suitable forms
and after becoming hard is driven as a wood or steel pile is driven. Piles constructed by the
first method may be either plain or reinforced, but piles constructed by the second method
are always reinforced to strengthen them for handling and driving. Concrete piers for foundation
work are simply piles of enlarged diameter.

~MOLDING PILES IN PLACE.~--Molding piles in place requires the use of special apparatus, and
this apparatus is to a very large degree controlled by patents. Pile work of this kind is thus
generally done by concerns which control the use of the apparatus employed and the general
contractor can undertake it only by permission of the proprietary companies. The methods of
work followed and the cost of work are thus of direct interest only as general information.

~Method and Cost of Constructing Raymond Piles.~--The machinery and processes employed in the
construction of Raymond concrete piles are patented and all piling work by this method is controlled
by the Raymond Concrete Pile Co. As detail costs of construction are not given out by the company
the following figures collected by the authors are subject to revision. They are believed to
be fairly approximate, having in one case been obtained by personal watch on the work and in
the other case from authentic records of the engineers on the work.

The pile is made as follows: A collapsible steel core 30 ft. long, 20 ins. diameter at the
top and 6 ins. diameter at the bottom, encased in a thin sheet steel shell, is driven into
the ground by an ordinary pile driver. When it has reached the proper depth, a wedge is loosened,
permitting the two sections of the core to come closer together so that the core can be pulled
out of the hole, leaving the steel shell behind as a casing to prevent the sides from caving
in. The shell is made of No. 20 gage steel, usually in four or more sections, which telescope
one over the other. A nest of sections is slipped over the lower end of the core as it hangs
in the leads, a rope is hitched around the outer section and the engine hoists away until the
sections are "un-telescoped" and drawn snug onto the core. The rope is then unfastened and
the driving begins. Figure 49 shows the usual pile driving rig used. The following are examples
of pile construction in actual work:

Example I.--In this work, for a building foundation in New York City, the pile driver was mounted
on a turntable, the framework of the turntable in turn resting on rollers traveling on timbers
laid on the ground. The driver was moved along and rotated when necessary by ropes passing
around the winch head of the engine. The driver had 50-ft. leads and a 3,100-lb. hammer operated
by an ordinary friction clutch hoisting engine. The hammer blow was received by an oak block
fitting into a recess at the top of the steel core. This block was so battered by the blows
that it had to be renewed about every five or six piles driven. A ¾-in. wire rope passing over
a 10-in. sheave lasted for the driving of 130 piles and then broke. When the work was first
begun the crew averaged 10 piles per 10-hour day, but the average for the job was 13 piles
per day, and the best day's work was 17 piles. The cost of labor and fuel per pile was as follows:

5 men on driver at $1.75                   $ 8.75
2 men handling shells at $1.75               3.50
1 engineman                                  3.00
6 men mixing and placing concrete           10.50
1 foreman                                    5.00
Coal and oil                                 2.50
                                          -------
     Total, 13 piles, at $2.55             $33.25

Deducting the cost of placing the concrete we get a cost of $1.75 for driving the cores. The
pile, 25 ft. long, 6 ins. at the point and 18 ins. at the head, contains 21¼ cu. ft., or 0.8
cu. yd., of concrete, and has a surface area of 77 ft. As No. 20 steel weighs 1.3 lbs. per
sq. ft., each shell weighed approximately 100 lbs. The cost per pile may then be summarized
as follows:

1.2 bbls. cement in 0.8 cu. yd., at $1.75        $2.10
0.8 cu. yd. stone at $1.25                        1.00
1/3 cu. yd. sand at $1.05                         0.35
100 lbs. steel in shell at 3½ cts.                3.50
Labor and fuel as above                           2.55
                                                 -----
    Total per pile (38 cts. per lin. ft.)        $9.50

This cost, it should be carefully noted, does not include cost of moving plant to and from
work or general expenses.

Example II.--In constructing a building at Salem, Mass., 172 foundation piles, 14 to 37 ft.
long, 6 ins. diameter at the point and 20 ins. diameter at the top, were constructed by the
Raymond process. The general contractor made the necessary excavations and provided clear and
level space for the pile driver, braced all trenches and pier holes, set stakes for the piles
and gave all lines and levels. The piles were driven by a No. 2 Vulcan steam hammer with a
3,000-lb. plunger having a drop of 3 ft., delivering 60 blows per minute. Figure 49 shows the
driver at work. Sixteen working days were occupied in driving the piles after the driver was
in position. The greatest number driven in one day was 20, and the average was 11 piles per
day. When in position for driving, the average time required to complete driving was 12 minutes.
The total number of blows varied from about 310 to 360, the average being about 350. The piles
were driven until the penetration produced by 8 to 10 blows equaled 1 in. When in full operation,
a crew of 5 men operated the pile driver. Seven men were engaged in making the concrete and
5 men working upon the metal shells.

Assuming the ordinary organization and the wages given below, we have the following labor cost
per day:

1 foreman at $5                           $ 5.00
1 engineman at $3                           3.00
4 laborers on driver at $1.75               7.00
6 laborers making concrete at $1.75        10.50
5 laborers handling shells at $1.75         8.75
                                          ------
    Total                                 $34.25

As 172 piles averaging 20 ft. in length were driven in 16 days, the total labor cost of driving,
given by the figures above, is 16 × $34.25 = $548, or practically 16 cts. per lineal foot of
pile driven.

The concrete used in the piles was a 1-3-5 Portland cement, sand and 1½-in. broken stone mixture.
A 20-ft. pile of the section described above contains about 20 cu. ft. of concrete, or say
0.75 cu. yd. We can then figure the cost of concrete materials per pile as follows:

0.85 bbl. cement at $1.60                 $1.36
0.36 cu. yd. sand at $1                    0.36
0.60 cu. yd. stone at $1.25                0.75
                                          -----
     Total per pile                       $2.47

The steel shell has an area of about 72 sq. ft., and as No. 20 gage steel weighs 1.3 lbs. per
sq. ft., its weight for each pile was about 94 lbs. Assuming the cost of coal, oil, etc., at
$2.50 per day, we have the following summary of costs:

                                        Per lin. ft.
                                            of pile.
Labor driving and concreting                   $0.16
Concrete materials                             0.123
94 lbs. steel shell at 3 cts.                  0.145
Coal, oil, etc.                                0.011
                                              ------
    Total                                     $0.439

The cost does not include interest on plant, cost of moving plant to and from work and general
expenses.

~Method of Constructing Simplex Piles.~--The apparatus employed in driving Simplex piles resembles
closely the ordinary wooden pile driven, but it is much heavier and is equipped to pull as
well as to drive. A 3,300-lb. hammer is used and it strikes on a hickory block set in a steel
drive head which rests on the driving form or shell. This form consists of a ¾-in. steel shell
16 ins. in diameter made in a single 40-ft. length. Around the top of the shell a ½-in. thick
collar or band 18 ins. deep is riveted by 24 1-in. countersunk rivets. This band serves the
double purpose of preventing the shell being upset by the blows of the hammer and of giving
a grip for fastening the pulling tackle. The bottom of the form or shell is provided with a
point. Two styles of point are employed. One style consists of two segments of a cylinder of
the same size as the form, so cut that they close together to form a sort of clam shell point.
In driving, the two jaws are held closed by the pressure of the earth and in pulling they open
apart of their own weight to permit the concrete to pass them. This point, known as the alligator
point, is pulled with the shell. It is suitable only for driving in firm, compact soil, in
loose soil the pressure inward of the walls keeps the jaws partly closed and so contracts the
diameter of the finished pile. The second style of point is a hollow cast iron point, 10 ins.
deep and 16½ ins. in diameter, having a neck over which the driving form slips and an annular
shoulder outside the neck to receive the circular edge of the shell. The projected sectional
area of this point is 1.4 sq. ft. It is left in the ground when the form is withdrawn. The
form is withdrawn by means of two 1-in. cables fastened to a steel collar which engages under
the band at the top of the form. The cables pass in the channel leads on each side over the
head of the driver and down in back to a pair of fivefold steel blocks, the lead line from
which passes to one of the drums of the engine. In this manner the power of the drum is increased
ten times and it is not unusual to break the pulling cables when the forms are in hard ground.
The general method of construction is about as shown by Fig. 50, being changed slightly to
meet varying conditions. The form resting on a cast iron point is driven to hard ground. A
heavy weight is then lowered into the form to make sure the point is loose. While the weight
is at the bottom of the form a target is placed on its line at the top of the form, the purpose
of which will be apparent later. The weight is then withdrawn. Given the length of the pile
and sectional area, it is an easy matter to determine the volume of concrete necessary to fill
the hole.

This amount is put into the form by means of a specially designed bottom dump bucket, which
permits the concrete to leave it in one mass, reaching its destination with practically no
disintegration. It will be noticed that when the full amount of concrete is in the form its
surface is considerably above the surface of the ground. This is due to the fact that the thickness
of the form occupies considerable space that is to be occupied by the concrete. The weight
is now placed on top of the concrete and the form is pulled. The target previously mentioned
now becomes useful. As the form is withdrawn the concrete settles down to occupy the space
left by the walls of the form. Obviously this settlement should proceed at a uniform rate,
and as it is difficult to watch the weight, the target on its line further up is of considerable
help. By watching this target in connection with a scale on the leads of the driver, it can
be readily told how the concrete in the form is acting. As another check, the target, just
as the bottom of the form is leaving the ground should be level with the top of the form. This
would indicate that the necessary amount of concrete has gone into the ground and that, other
conditions being all right, the pile is a good one. In some grounds where the head of concrete
in the form exerts a greater pressure than the back pressure or resistance of the earth, the
concrete will be forced out into the sides of the hole, making the pile of increased diameter
at that point and necessitating the use of more concrete to bring the pile up to the required
level.

~Method of Constructing Piles with Enlarged Footings.~--A pile with an enlarged base or footing
has been used in several places by Mr. Charles R. Gow of Boston, Mass., who has patented the
construction. A single pipe or a succession of pipes connected as the work proceeds is driven
by hammer to the depths required. The material inside the shell is then washed out by a water
jet to the bottom of the shell and then for a further distance below the shell bottom. An expanding
cutter is then lowered to the bottom of the hole and rotated horizontally so as to excavate
a conical chamber, the water jet washing the earth out as fast as it is cut away. When the
chamber has been excavated the water is pumped out and the chamber and shell are filled with
concrete. The drawings of Fig. 51 show the method of construction clearly. The chambering machine
is used only in clay or other soil which does not wash readily. In soil which is readily washed
the chamber can be formed by the jet alone. The practicability of this method of construction
is stated by Mr. Gow to be limited to pipe sizes up to about 14 ins. in diameter.

~Method of Constructing Piles by the "Compressol" System.~--The compressol system of concrete
pile or pillar construction is a French invention that has been widely used abroad and which
is controlled in this country by the Hennebique Construction Co., of New York, N. Y. The piles
are constructed by first ramming a hole in the ground by repeatedly dropping a conical "perforator"
weighing some two tons. This perforator is raised and dropped by a machine resembling an ordinary
pile driver. The conical weight gradually sinks the hole deeper and deeper by compacting the
earth laterally; this lateral compression is depended upon so to consolidate the walls of the
hole that they do not cave before the concrete can be placed. The concrete is deposited loose
in the hole and rammed solid by dropping a pear-shaped weight onto it as it is placed. The
view Fig. 52 shows the "perforator" and the tamping apparatus at work. Very successful work
has been done abroad by this method.

~Method of Constructing Piers in Caissons.~--For piles or pillars of diameters larger than
say 18 ins. the use of driving shells and cores becomes increasingly impracticable. Concrete
pillars of large size are then used. They are constructed by excavating and curbing a well
or shaft and filling it with concrete. This construction has been most used in Chicago, Ill.,
for the foundations for heavy buildings, but it is of general application where the sub-soil
conditions are suitable. The method is not patented or controlled by patents in any particular,
except that certain tools and devices which may be used are proprietary.

General Description.--The caisson method of construction is simple in principle. A well is
dug by successive excavations of about 5 ft. each. After each excavation of 5 ft. is completed,
wood lagging is placed around the sides and supported by internal steel rings, so that the
soft ground around the excavation is maintained in its former position. The methods of excavating
and removing the soil and of constructing the lagging are considered in detail further on.
The caissons vary in diameter according to the load; some as large as 12 ft. in diameter have
been sunk, but the usual diameter is 6 ft.; a caisson of 3 ft. in diameter is as small as a
man can get into and work. When the pier goes to bed rock the caisson is made of uniform diameter
from top to bottom, but where the pier rests on hardpan the bottom portion of the well is belled
out to give greater bearing area. It is customary to load the piers about 20 tons per square foot.

Caisson Construction.--The caisson construction, or more correctly the form of curbing most
commonly used, is that indicated by the sketch, Fig. 53. The lagging is 2×6 in. or 3×6 in.,
stuff 5 ft. 4 ins. or 4 ft. long set vertically around the well and held in place by interior
wrought iron rings. For a 6-ft. diameter caisson these hoops are ¾ by 3 ins.; they are made
in two parts, which are bolted together as shown by Fig. 53. Generally there are two rings
for each length of lagging; for 5-ft. lagging they are placed about 9 ins. from each end. In
some cases, however, engineers have specified three rings for the upper sections in soft clay
and two rings for the sections in the hard ground lower down. The lagging used is not cut with
radial edges, but is rough, square cut stuff; the rings, therefore, take the inward pressure
altogether.

In some recent work done by the inventor use has been made of the caisson construction shown
by Fig. 54 and patented by Mr. Geo. W. Jackson. In place of the plain rings a combination of
T-beam ribs and jacks is used; this construction is clearly shown by the drawing. The advantages
claimed for the construction are that it gives absolute security to the workmen and the work,
that the lagging can be jacked tightly against the outer walls of the well, that the braces
form a ladder by which the workmen can enter and leave the well, and that the possibility of
shifting the bracing easily permits the concrete to be placed to the best advantage. On the
other hand the braces abstruct the clear working space of the caissons.

Excavating and Handling Material.--The excavation of the wells is done by hand, using shovels
and picks, and, in the hardpan, special grubs made by A. J. Pement and George Racky, Chicago
blacksmiths. The excavated material is hoisted out of the well in buckets made by the Variety
Iron Works, of Chicago. For caissons which are not specified to go to rock it is considered
more economical to do the hoisting by windlass derricks operated by hand. These derricks have
four 6×6-in. legs and a 3×6-in. top piece. When the caissons go to rock the hoisting is done
by power, so-called "cable set-ups" being used in most cases. To illustrate this method the
following account of the foundation work for the Cook County Court House is given:

The Cook County Court House foundations consist of 126 caissons varying from 4 ft. to 10½ ft.
in diameter and averaging$ 7½ ft. in diameter. They were sunk to rock at a depth of 115 ft.
below street level. The work involved 22,000 cu. yds. of excavation and the placing in the
caissons of 17,000 cu. yds. of concrete. Over 1,000 piles about 40 ft. long, that had formed
the foundation of the old Court House built in 1875, were removed. These piles were found to
be in good condition. The work was done by the George A. Fuller Co., of Chicago, Ill., Contractors,
with Mr. Edgar S. Belden Superintendent in Charge. The details which follow have been obtained
from Mr. Belden.

The foundation area was 157×375 ft., and was excavated to a depth of 15 ft. below the street
surface before the caissons were started. The caissons, of which there were 126, were arranged
in rows across the lot, there being from six to eight caissons in a row. The arrangement of
the plant for the work is indicated by Fig. 55. One row of caissons formed a unit. A platform
or "stand" was erected over each caisson and carried in its top a tripod fitted with a "nigger
head" operated by a rope sheave. This arrangement is shown by Fig. 56. An engine on the bank
operated by a rope drive all the tripod sheaves for a row of six or eight caissons. The arrangement
is indicated by Fig. 55. The clay hoisted from the pits was dumped into 1 cu. yd. hoppers with
which the stands were fitted, as shown by Fig. 56; when a hopper was full it was dumped into
a car running on a 24-in. gage portable track. Side dump Koppel cars of 1 cu. yd. capacity
were used; they dumped their load into an opening connected with the tracks of the Illinois
Tunnel Co., where the material passed into tunnel cars and was taken to the lake front about
one mile away. As soon as one row of caissons was completed the stands, tripods, etc., which
were made portable, were shifted to another row. At times as many as five units were in operation,
sinking 40 caissons.

Fig. 56 shows the arrangement in detail at one caisson. In this work the lagging used was 3×6-in.
maple, 5 ft. 4 ins. long, and was supported by 3×¾-in. steel hoops. The lagging was matched
and dressed. The "nigger head," as will be seen, is operated by a rope sheave on the same axle.
As stated above, an endless rope drive operated all the "nigger heads" on a row of caissons.
A 26-in. driving sheave was attached to an ordinary hoisting engine equipped with a governor.
The driving rope was 5/8-in. steel. It was wrapped twice around the driving sheave and once
around the "nigger head" sheaves. These latter were 18 ins. in diameter. For the hoists 1-in.
Manila rope was used. The other details, the bucket, bucket hook, swivel block, etc., are made
clear by the drawing. The platforms, tripods, etc., were of the standard dimensions and construction
adopted by the contractors of the work. Detail drawings of the standard platform are given
by Fig. 57. One of these platforms contains about 1,000 ft. B. M. of lumber. As will be seen,
all connections are bolted, no nails being used anywhere. A platform can thus be taken down
and stored or shipped and erected again on another job with very little trouble.

The plant described handled some 22,000 cu. yds. of excavated material on this work. Work was
kept up night and day, working three 8-hour shifts. It took an average of 35 shifts to excavate
one row of caissons. No figures of the working force or the cost of excavation of this work
are available.

Mixing and Placing Concrete.--The placing of the concrete in the excavated wells is done by
means of tremies, or, which is more usual, by simply dumping it in from the top, workmen going
down to distribute it. The manner of mixing the concrete and of handling it to the caisson
varies of course with almost every job. As an example of the better arranged mixing and handling
plants the one used on the Cook County Court House work may be described. This plant is shown
by the sketch, Fig. 58.

Bins for the sand and stone were built at one side of the lot on the sloping bank; their tops
were level with the street surface and their bottoms were just high enough to permit their
contents to be delivered by chutes into 1 cu. yd. cars. Wagons dumping through traps in the
platform over the bin delivered the sand and stone. The sketches indicate the arrangement of
the bins and mixer and the car tracks connecting them. The raw material cars were first run
under the stone bin and charged with the required proportion of stone, and then to the sand
bin, where the required proportion of sand was chuted on top of the stone. The loaded car was
then hauled up the incline and dumped into the hopper, where cement and water were added. A
No. 2½ Smith mixer was used and discharged into cars which delivered their loads on tracks
leading to the caissons. The same cars and portable tracks were used as had been used to handle
the excavated material. In operation a batch of raw materials was being prepared in the hopper
while the previous batch was being mixed and while the concrete car was delivering the still
previous batch to the caissons. An average of 40 batches an hour mixed and put into the caissons
was maintained with a force of 25 men. In all some 17,000 cu. yds. of concrete were mixed and
deposited.

Cost of Caisson Work.--The following attempt to get at the cost of caisson work is based largely
upon information obtained from Mr. John M. Ewen, John M. Ewen Co., Engineers and Builders,
Chicago, Ill. Mr. Ewen says:

"My experience has taught me that it is almost impossible to determine any definite data of
cost for this work. This is due to the fact that no two caisson jobs will average the same
cost, notwithstanding the fact that the cost of material used and the labor conditions are
exactly the same. This condition is due to the great variety in texture of the soil gone through.
For instance, it has come under my experience that in caissons of the same diameter on the
same job it required but fifteen 8-hour shifts to reach bedrock in some of these, while it
required as many as 21 to 25 shifts to reach rock in the others, rock being at the same elevation.
In fact, the digging all the way to rock in some was the best that could be wished for, while
in the others boulders and quicksand were encountered, and the progress was slower, and the
cost consequently greater.

"Again, we have known it to require eight hours for two men to dig 8 ins. in hardpan in one
caisson, while on a job going on at the same time and on the opposite corner of the street
two men made progress of 2 ft. in 8 hours through apparently the same stuff, the depth of hardpan
from grade being 61 ft. 6 ins. in both instances, and the quality of labor exactly the same.

"There have been more heavy losses among contractors due to the unexpected conditions arising
in caisson digging than in any other item of their work, and I predict a loss to some of them
that will be serious indeed if an attempt be made to base future bids for caisson work entirely
upon the data kept by them on past work. If a contractor is fortunate enough to find the ordinary
conditions existing in his caisson work, and by ordinary conditions I mean few boulders, no
quicksand, ordinary hardpan and no gas, the following items may be considered safe for figuring
caisson work:

"Figure that it will require from 22 to 25 shifts of 8 hours each to strike bedrock, bedrock
being from 90 to 95 ft. below datum, and datum being 15 ft. below street grade; figure 2 diggers
to the shift in all caissons over 5 ft. in diameter, 45 cts. per hour for each digger; figure
1 top man at 40 cts. per hour, and 1 mucker or common laborer at 30 cts. per hour for all caissons
in which there are two diggers, and 1 top man less if 1 digger is in the caisson, which condition
exists generally in caissons less than 5 ft. in diameter. Add the cost of 5/8-in. cable, tripods,
sheaves, 1-in. Hauser laid line, nigger heads, ball-bearing blocks, etc., for rigging of the
job. Lagging, which is 2×6 ins. and 3×6 ins. hemlock or some hard wood, in length of 5 ft.
4 ins. and 4 ft., is priced all the way from $20 to $22.50 and $21 to $24.50 per M. ft. B.
M., respectively. The price of caisson rings is $2.40 per 100 lbs. The cost of specially made
grubs for digging in hardpan is about $26 per dozen. Shovels are furnished by the diggers themselves
in Chicago, Ill. The cost of temporary electric light is $10 per caisson. This includes cost
of cable, lamps, guards, etc. Add the cost of or rental of engine or motors for power.

"Some engineers specify three rings to be used to each set of lagging below the top set until
hardpan is reached, then two rings for each of the remaining sets from hardpan to rock. This
is, of course, to insure against disaster from great pressure of the swelling clay above the
hardpan strata, and may or may not be necessary. These rings are ¾×3 ins. wrought iron.

"For caissons which are not specified to go to rock, it is not considered economical to rig
up cable set-ups, but rather to use windlass derricks. In this case 1-in. Hauser laid line
is used as the means of hoisting the buckets of clay out of the caisson, as is the case in
cable set-ups, hand power being used on the windlass derricks instead of steam or electricity.
The windlass derricks are made with four legs out of 6×6-in. yellow pine lumber. The top piece
is generally a piece of 3×6-in. lagging. The cost of windlass and boxes is about $35 per dozen.
Hooks for caisson buckets cost 45 cts. each. Caisson buckets cost $8 each.

"With the above approximate units as a basis, I have seen unit prices given per lineal foot
in caisson work which ranged all the way from $12 to $16.50 for 6-ft. diameter caissons, larger
and smaller sized caissons being graded in price according to their size. This unit price included
rings, lagging, concrete, power, light, labor, etc."

From the above data the following figures of cost can be arrived at, assuming a 6-ft. caisson:

  Labor.                                Per day.
2 diggers in caisson, at $3.60            $ 7.20
1 top man, at $3.20                         3.20
1 mucker, at $2.40                          2.40
                                          ------
                                          $12.80

The depth sunk varies from 3½ to 8 ft. per 8-hour day, depending on the material. Assuming
an average of 4 ft., we have then 4 lin. ft. of caisson, or 2.8 cu. yds. excavated at a labor
cost of $12.80, which is at the rate of $3.20 per lin. ft., or $4.57 per cu. yd. We now get
the following:

                                               Per lin. ft.
                                                   Caisson.
40 ft. B. M. (2×6-in. lagging) at $25                 $1.00
60 lbs. iron (¾×3-in. rings) at 2½ c.                  1.50
0.7 cu. yd. excavation at $4.57                        3.20
0.7 cu. yd. muck hauled away at $1                     0.70
0.7 cu. yd. concrete at $5                             3.50
Electric light                                         0.10
                                                     ------
  Total                                              $10.00

If 3×6-in. lagging is used add 50 cts. per lin. ft. of caisson.

~MOLDING PILES FOR DRIVING.~--Piles for driving are molded like columns in vertical forms or
like beams in horizontal forms. European constructors have a strong preference for vertical
molding, believing that a pile better able to withstand the strain of driving is so produced;
such lamination as results from tamping and settling is, in vertical molding, in planes normal
to the axis of the pile and the line of driving stress. Vertical molding has been rarely employed
in America and then only for molding round piles. The common belief is that horizontal molding
is the cheaper method. In the ordinary run of work, where comparatively few piles are to be
made, it is probably cheaper to use horizontal molds, but where a large number of piles is
to be made, the vertical method has certain economic advantages which are worth considering.

Vertical molding necessitates a tower or staging to support the forms and for handling and
placing the concrete; an example of such a staging is shown by Fig. 59. To counterbalance this
staging, horizontal molding necessitates a molding platform of very solid and rigid construction
if it is to endure continued and repeated use. In the matter of space occupied by molding plant,
vertical molding has the advantage. A tower 40 ft. square will give ample space around its
sides for 80 vertical forms for 12-in. piles and leaves 1 ft. of clear working space between
each pair of forms. The ground area occupied by this tower and the forms is 1,764 sq. ft. With
the same spacing of molds a horizontal platform at least 25 × 160 ft. = 4,000 sq. ft., would
be required for the molds for the same number of piles 25 ft. long. For round piles, vertical
molding permits the use of sectional steel forms; horizontal forms for round piles are difficult
to manage. For square piles vertical molding requires forms with four sides; horizontal forms
for square piles consist of two side pieces only, the molding platform serving as the bottom
and no top form being necessary. Thus, for square piles horizontal molding reduces the quantity
of lumber per form by 50 per cent. The side forms for piles molded on their sides can be removed
much sooner than can the forms for piles molded on end, so that the form material is more often
released for reuse. The labor of assembling and removing forms is somewhat less in horizontal
molding than in vertical molding. Removing the piles from molding bed to storage yard for curing
requires derricks or locomotive cranes in either case and as a rule this operation will be
about as expensive in plant and labor in one case as in the other. In the ease and certainty
of work in placing the reinforcement, horizontal molding presents certain advantages, the placing
and working of the concrete around the reinforcement is also easier in horizontal molding.
Mixing and transporting the concrete materials and the concrete is quite as cheap in vertical
molding as in horizontal molding. If anything, it is cheaper with vertical molding, since the
mixer and material bins can be placed within the tower or close to one side where a tower derrick
can hoist and deposit the concrete directly into the molds. Car tracks, cars, runways and wheelbarrows
are thus done away with in handling the concrete from mixer to molds. Altogether, therefore,
the choice of the method of molding is not to be decided off-hand.

~DRIVING MOLDED PILES.~--Driving molded concrete piles with hammer drivers is an uncertain
operation. It has been done successfully even in quite hard soils and it can be done if time
is taken and the proper care is exercised. The conditions of successful hammer driving are:
Perfect alignment of the pile with the line of stroke of the hammer; the use of a cushion cap
to prevent shattering of the pile-head, and a heavy hammer with a short drop. The pile itself
must have become well cured and hardened. At best, hammer driving is uncertain, however; shattered
piles have frequently to be withdrawn and the builder is never sure that fractures do not exist
in the portion of the pile that is underground and hidden. The actual records of concrete pile
work given in succeeding sections illustrate successful examples of hammer driving. The plant
required need not vary from that ordinarily used for driving wooden piles, except that more
power must be provided for handling the heavier concrete pile and that means must be provided
for holding the pile in line and protecting its head.

Sinking concrete piles by means of water jets is in all respect a process similar to that of
jetting wooden piles. Examples of jetting are given in succeeding section. The piles varied
in length with the depth of the water, the longest being 34½ ft. Their construction is shown
by Fig. 60, which also shows the floor girders carried by each pair of piles and forming with
them a bent, and the struts bracing the bents together. In molding and driving the piles the
old steel pier was used as a working platform.

The forms for the piles were set on end on small pile platforms located close to the positions
to be occupied by the piles and were braced to the old pier. The forms were of wood and the
bulb point, the shaft and the knee braces were molded in one piece. Round iron rods were used
for reinforcement. The concrete was composed of 1 part Vulcanite Portland cement, 2 parts of
fine and coarse sand mixed and 4 parts of gravel 1 in. and under in size. The mixture was made
wet and was puddled into the forms with bamboo fishing rods, which proved very efficient in
working the mixture around the reinforcing rods and in getting a good mortar surface. The concrete
was placed in small quantities; it was mostly all hand mixed. The forms were removed in from
5 to 7 days, depending on the weather.

The piles were planned to be sunk by water jet and to this end had molded in them a 2-in. jet
pipe as shown. They were sunk to depths of from 8 ft. to 14 ft. into the beach sand. Water
from the city water mains at a pressure of 65 lbs. per sq. in. was used for jetting; this water
was furnished under special ordinance at a price of $1 per pile, and a record of the amount
used per pile was not kept. The piles were swung from the molding platforms and set by derricks
and block and fall. The progress of jetting varied greatly owing to obstructions in places
in the shape of logs, old iron pipes, etc. In some cases several days were required to get
rid of a single pipe. In clear sand, with no obstruction, a 12-in. pile could be jetted down
at the rate of about 8 ft. per hour, working 1 foreman and 6 men. The following is the itemized
actual cost of molding and sinking a 26-ft. pile with bulb point and knee braces complete:

                                                                Cost per

      Total cost per pile                                         $36.60

The pile being 26 ft. long, the cost in place was $1.41 per foot. Subtracting the cost of sinking
amounting to $7.09 per pile, we have the cost of a 26-ft. pile molded and ready to sink coming
to about $1.10 per foot. It should be noted that this is the cost for a pile of rather complicated
construction; a plain cylindrical pile should be less expensive.

~Method of Molding and Jetting Square Piles for a Building Foundation.~--The foundation covered
about an acre. The soil was a deposit of semi-fluid mud and quicksand overlying a very irregular
rock bottom and encircled by a ledge of rock. The maximum depth of the mud pocket was 40 ft.,
and interspersed were floating masses of hard pan. Soundings were made at the locations of
all piles; a ½-in. gas pipe was coupled to a hose fed by city pressure and jetted down to rock,
the depth was measured, the sounding was numbered and the pile was molded to length and numbered
like the sounding. In all 414 piles were required, ranging in length from 1½ to 40 ft.; all
piles up to 6 ft. were built in place in wooden forms. The piles were 13 ins. square and were
of 1-2½-4 concrete reinforced with welded wire fabric. A tin speaking tube was molded into
each pile at the center. This tube was stopped about 10 ins. from the head and by means of
an elbow and threaded nipple projected through the side of the pile to allow of attaching a
pressure hose. The piles were handled to the pile driver, the hose attached and water supplied
at 100 lbs. pressure by a pump. Churning the pile up and down aided the driving. A hammer was
used to force the piles through the hard pan layers. A wooden follower was used to protect
the pile head. A 2,800-lb. hammer falling 20 ft. did not injure the piles. One pile was given
300 blows with a 2,800-lb. hammer falling 12 ft., and when pulled was unbroken. It was found
that 30 ft. piles and under could be picked up safely by one end; longer piles cracked at the
center when so handled. These long piles were successfully handled by a long chain, one end
being wrapped around the pile at the center and the other end similarly wrapped near the head;
the hook of the hoisting fall was hooked into the loop of the chain and as the pile was hoisted
the hook slipped along the chain toward the top gradually up ending the pile. The piles weighed
175 lbs. per lin. ft. It was attempted to mold the piles directly on the ground by leveling
it off and covering it with tar paper, but the ground settled and the method proved impracticable.

~Method of Molding and Jetting Piles for Building Foundations.~--In a number of foundations
Mr. Frank B. Gilbreth has used a polygonal pile, either octagonal or hexagonal, with the sides
corrugated or fluted as indicated in Fig. 61. In longitudinal section these piles have a uniform
taper from butt to point and have flat points. Each pile is cored in the center, the core being
4 ins. in diameter at the top and 2 ins. at the bottom end. On each of the octagon or hexagon
sides the pile has a half-round flute usually from 2½ to 3 ins. in diameter. The principal
object of these flutes or "corrugations" is to give passage for the escape to the surface of
the water forced through the center core hole in driving the pile. They are also for the purpose
of increasing the perimeter of the pile and thereby gaining greater surface for skin friction.

The piles are reinforced longitudinally and transversely. On this particular job the reinforcement
was formed with Clinton Electrically Welded Fabric, the meshes being 3 ins.×12 ins.; the longer
dimension being lengthwise with the pile and of No. 3 wire; the horizontal or transverse reinforcement
being of No. 10 wire. The meshes being electrically welded together, the reinforcement was
got out from a wide sheet taking the form of a cone. No part of the reinforcement was closer
than 1 in. from the outside of the concrete. In general only sufficient sectional area of material
is put in the reinforcement to take the tensile stresses caused by the bending action when
handling the pile preparatory to driving; more reinforcement than this only being necessary
when the piles are used for wharves, piers or other marine structures, where a considerable
length of pile is not supported sidewise or when they are subjected to bending stresses.

Molding.--The forms for molding the piles are made from 2-in. stuff, gotten out to the required
dimensions, the corrugations being formed by nailing pieces on the inside whose section is
the segment of a circle. The sides of the octagon are fastened to the ends through which the
core projects some 6 or 8 ins. At times while the molding of the pile is in progress, the central
core is given a partial turn to prevent the setting of the cement holding it fast and thereby
preventing the final removal.

The stripping of the forms from the piles is usually done from 24 to 48 hours after molding,
and from this time on great care is taken that there is a sufficient amount of moisture in
the pile to permit of the proper action for setting of the cement. This is usually accomplished
by covering the piles over with burlaps and saturating with water from a hose; the operation
of driving the pile not being attempted until the concrete is at least ten days old.

Driving.--The operation of driving corrugated concrete piles is somewhat similar to that for
driving ordinary wooden piles by water jet, but a much heavier hammer with less drop is used.
The jetting is accomplished by inserting a 2-in. pipe within the pile. This pipe is tapered
at the bottom end to 1-in. diameter, forming a nozzle, and the water pressure used is about
120 lbs. per sq. in. As a rule, this pressure is obtained by the use of a steam pump which
may be connected with the boiler which operates the pile driver, or with a separate steam supply.
At the upper end of this 2-in. pipe an elbow is placed and a short length of pipe is connected
to this and to the hose from the water supply.

As it is not practicable to drop the hammer directly on the head of the concrete piles, the
driving is accomplished by the use of a special cap, Fig. 62. This cap is about 3 ft. in height
and the bottom end fits over the head of the pile. In one side of this cap is a slot from the
outside to the center, which permits the 2-in. pipe, which supplies the water jet for driving
the pile, to project. The outside of this cap is formed with a steel shell, the inside has
a compartment filled with rubber packing and the top has a wooden block which receives a blow
from the hammer. In this way the head of the pile is cushioned, which prevents the blow of
the hammer from bruising or breaking the concrete.

During the operation of driving, the water from the jet comes up on the outside of the pile
and carries with it the material which it displaces in driving. This, with the assistance of
the hammer, allows the pile to be driven in place, and, contrary to what might be supposed,
after the operation of driving when the water has saturated into the ground or been drained
away, this operation puddles the earth around the pile, so that after a few hours' time the
skin friction is much more than it would be with the pile driven into more compact soil without
the use of a jet.

~Method of Molding and Driving Round Piles.~--In constructing a warehouse at Bristol, England,
some 600 spirally-reinforced piles of the Coignet type were used. Coignet piles are in section
circles with two longitudinal flat faces to facilitate guiding during driving; this section
is the same as would be found by removing two thin slabs from opposite sides of a timber pile.
The reinforcement consists of longitudinal bars set around the periphery and drawn together
to a point at one end and then inserted into a conical shoe; these longitudinal bars are wound
spirally with a ¼-in. rod wire tied to the bars at every intersection. This spiral rod has
a pitch of only a few inches, but to bind it in place and give rigidity to the skeleton it
is wound by a second spiral with a reverse twist and a pitch of 4 or 5 ft. As thus constructed,
the reinforcing frame is sufficiently rigid to bear handling as a unit. The piles used at Bristol
were 14 to 15 ins. in diameter and 52 ft. long, and weighed about 4 tons gross each. The mixture
used was cement, river sand and crushed granite.

Molding.--In molding Coignet piles the reinforcement is assembled complete as shown by Fig.
63 and then suspended as a unit in a horizontal mold constructed as shown by the cross-section
Fig. 64. The concrete is deposited in the top opening and rammed and worked into place around
the steel after which the opening is closed by the piece A. After 24 hours the curved side
pieces B and C are removed and the pile is left on the sill D until hard enough to be shifted;
a pile is considered strong enough for driving when about six weeks old.

Driving.--Coignet piles at the Bristol work were handled by a traveling crane. The material
penetrated was river mud and they were driven with a hammer weighing 2 tons gross; in driving
the pile head was encircled by a metal cylinder into which fitted a wooden plunger or false
pile with a bed of shavings and sawdust between plunger and pile head.

~Molding and Driving Square Piles for a Building Foundation.~--The Dittman Factory Building
at Cincinnati, O., is founded on reinforced concrete piles varying from 8 to 22 ft. in length.
The piles were square in cross-section, with a 2-in. bevel on the edges; a 16-ft. pile was
10 ins. square at the point and 14 ins. square at the head, shorter or longer piles had the
same size of point, but their heads were proportionally smaller or larger, since all piles
were cast in the same mold by simply inserting transverse partitions to get the various lengths.
Each pile was reinforced by four ¾-in. twisted bars, one in each corner, bound together by
¼-in hoops every 12 ins.. The bars were bent in at the point and inserted in a hollow pyramidal
cast iron shoe weighing about 50 lbs. The concrete was a 1-2-4 stone mixture and the pile was
allowed to harden four weeks before driving. They were cast horizontally in wooden molds which
were removed after 30 hours.

Driving.--Both because of their greater weight and because of the care that had to be taken
not to shatter the head, it took longer to adjust and drive one of these concrete piles than
it would take with a wooden pile. The arrangement for driving the piles was as follows: A metal
cap was set over the head of the pile, on this was set the guide cap having the usual wood
deadener and on this was placed a wood deadener about 1 ft. long. The metal cap was filled
with wet sand to form a cushion, but as the pile head shattered in driving the sand cushion
was abandoned and pieces of rubber hose were substituted. With this rubber cushion the driving
was accomplished without material damage to the pile head. The hammer used weighed 4,000 lbs.
and the drop was from 4 to 6 ft. The blows per pile ranged from 60 up. The average being about
90. In some cases where the driving was hard it took over 400 blows to drive a 14-ft. pile.
An attempt to drive one pile with a 16-ft. drop resulted in the fracture of the pile.

~Method of Molding and Driving Octagonal Piles.~--The piles were driven in a sand fill 18 ft.
deep to form a foundation for a track scales in a railway yard. They were octagonal and 16
ins. across the top, 16 ft. long, and tapered to a diameter of 12 ins. at the bottom. They
were also pointed for about a foot. The reinforcement consisted of four ½-in. Johnson corrugated
bars spaced equally around a circle concentric with the center of the pile, the bars being
kept 1½ ins. from the surface of the concrete. A No. 11 wire wrapped around the outside of
the bars secured the properties of a hooped-concrete column. The piles were cast in molds laid
on the side. They were made of 1:4½ gravel concrete, and were seasoned at least three weeks
before being driven.

An ordinary derrick pile driver, with a 2,500-lb. hammer falling 18 ft., was used in sinking
them. A timber follower 6 ft. long and banded with iron straps at both ends was placed over
the head of the pile to receive directly the hammer blows. The band on the lower end was 10
ins. wide and extended 6 ins. over the end of the follower. In this 6-in. space a thick sheet
of heavy rubber was placed, coming between the head of the pile and the follower. Little difficulty
was experienced in driving the piles in this manner, although 250 to 300 blows of the hammer
were required to sink each pile. The driving being entirely through fine river sand there is
every probability that any kind of piles would have been driven slowly. The heads of the first
4 or 5 piles were battered somewhat, but after the pile driver crew became familiar with the
method of driving, no further battering resulted and the heads of most of the piles were practically
uninjured.

~Method and Cost of Making Reinforced Concrete Piles by Rolling.~--In molding reinforced concrete
piles exceeding 30 or 40 ft. in length, the problem of molds or forms becomes a serious one.
A pile mold 50 or 60 ft. long is not only expensive in first cost, but is costly to maintain,
because of the difficulty of keeping the long lagging boards from warping. To overcome these
difficulties a method of molding piles without forms has been devised and worked out practically
by Mr. A. C. Chenoweth, of Brooklyn, N. Y. This method consists in rolling a sheet of concrete
and wire netting into a solid cylinder on a mandril, by means of a special machine. Fig. 65
is a sketch showing a cross-section of a finished pile, in which the dotted line shows the
wire netting, the hollow circle is the gas pipe mandril, and the solid circles are the longitudinal
reinforcing bars.

In making the pile the netting is spread flat, with the reinforcing bars attached as shown
at (a), Fig. 66, and is then covered with a layer of concrete. One edge of the netting is fastened
to the platform, the other edge is attached to the winding mandril. The winding operation is
indicated by sketch (b), Fig. 66. Fig. 67 shows the machine for rolling the pile. It consists
of a platform and a roll. The platform is mounted on wheels and is so connected up that it
moves back under the roll at exactly the circumferential speed of the roll; thus the forming
pile is under constant, heavy pressure between the roll and platform. When the pile has been
completely rolled it is bound at intervals by wire ties; the wire for these ties is carried
on spools arranged under the edge of the platform at intervals of 4 ins. for the first 10 ft.
from the point and of 6 ins. for the remainder of the length. The binding is done by giving
the pile two or three extra revolutions and then cutting and tying the wire; then by means
of a long removable shelf which contains the flushing mortar, as the pile revolves it becomes
coated on the outside with a covering that protects the ties and other surface metal. Finally
the pile is rolled onto a suitable table to harden.

An exhibition pile rolled by the process described is 61 ft. long and 13 ins. in diameter.
This pile was erected as a pole by hoisting with a tackle attached near one end and dragging
the opposite end along the ground exactly as a timber pole would be erected. It was also suspended
free by a tackle attached at the center; in this position the ends deflected 6 ins. Neither
of these tests resulted in observable cracks in the pile. The pile contains eight 1-in. diameter
steel bars 61 ft. long, one 2½-in. pipe also 61 ft. long, 366 sq. ft., or 40.6 sq. yds. ½-in.
mesh 14 B. & S. gage wire netting, and 2 cu. yds. loose concrete. Its cost for materials and
labor was as follows:

  Materials--
Gravel, 28.8 cu. ft., at $1 per cu. yd.                   $ 1.05
Sand, 19.8 cu. ft., at $1 per cu. yd.                        .73
Cement, 3 bbls., at $1.60 per bbl.                          4.80
Netting, 40.6 sq. yds., at 17½ cts. per sq. yd.             7.10
Rods, wire, etc., 1,826 lbs., at 2½ cts. per lb.

The construction problem in building concrete structures of massive form and volume is chiefly
a problem of plant arrangement and organization of plant operations. In most such work form
construction is simple and of such character that it offers no delay to placing the concrete
as rapidly as it can be produced. The same is true of the character of the structure, it is
seldom necessary for one part of the work to wait on the setting and hardening of another part.
As a rule, there is no reinforcement to fabricate and place and where there is it is of such
simple character as not to influence the main task of mixing, handling, and placing concrete.
Stated broadly, the contractor in such work generally has a certain large amount of concrete
to manufacture, transport and deposit in a certain space with nothing to limit the rapidity
of these operations, except the limitations of plant capacity and management. Installation
and operation of mixing and conveying plant, then are matters to be considered carefully in
heavy concrete work.

In the following sections we have given one or more examples of nearly every kind of heavy
concrete work excepting bridge foundations and retaining walls, which are considered in Chapters
XII and XIII, and except rubble concrete work, which is considered in Chapter VI. In each case
so far as the available records made it possible, we have given an account of the plant used
and of its operation.

~FORTIFICATION WORK.~--Concrete for fortification work consists very largely of heavy platforms
and walls for gun foundations and enclosures and of heavily roofed galleries and chambers for
machinery and ammunition. The work is very massive and in the majority of cases of simple form.
A large number of data are to be found in the reports of the Chief of Engineers, U. S. A.,
on all classes of fortification work, but the manner in which they are recorded makes close
analysis of relative efficiencies of methods or of relative costs almost impossible. The following
data are given, therefore, as examples that may be considered fairly representative of the
costs obtained in fortification work done under the direction of army engineers; these data
are not susceptible of close analysis because wages, working force, outputs, etc., are nearly
always lacking.

~Gun Emplacements, Staten Island, N. Y.~--The work comprised 5,609 cu. yds. of concrete in
two 12-in. gun emplacements, and 3,778 cu. yds. of concrete in two 6-in. gun emplacements.
Concrete was mixed in a revolving cube mixer with the exception of 809 cu. yds. in the 6-in.
emplacements which were mixed by hand at a cost of 56 cts. more per cubic yard than machine
mixing cost. The body of the concrete was a 1-3-5 Portland cement, beach sand and broken trap
rock mixture. The floors and upper surface of the concrete had a pavement consisting of 6 ins.
of 1-3-5 concrete surfaced with 2 ins. of 1-3 mortar. Wages are not given, but for the time
and place should have been about $1.50 per 8-hour day for common labor. The cost of materials was:

Alpha Portland cement, per bbl.                   $1.98 Broken trap rock, per cu. yd.

~Mortar Battery Platform, Tampa Bay, Fla.~--The platform contained 8,994 cu. yds. of concrete
composed of a mixture of Portland cement, sand, shells and broken stone. The broken stone and
cement were brought in by vessel and the sand and shells were obtained from the beach near
by. The plant for the work was arranged as shown by the sketch, Fig. 68. Sand, stone and shells
were stored in separate compartments in the storage bins. Box cars, divided into compartments
of such size that when each was filled with its proper material, the car would contain the
proper proportions for one batch of concrete, were pushed by hand under the several compartments
of the bin in succession until charged; then they were hooked to a cable and hauled to the
platform over the mixer and dumped. The charge was then turned over with shovels and shoveled
into the hopper of a continuous mixer, located beneath. Two cars were used for charging the
mixer, running on separate tracks as shown. The mixer discharged into buckets set on flat cars,
which were hauled by mules under the cableway, which then lifted and dumped the bucket and
returned it empty to the car. By using three bucket cars, one was always ready to receive the
mixer discharge as soon as the preceding one had been filled, so that the mixer operated continuously.
The cableway had a working span of 270 ft., the cable being carried by traveling towers 69
ft. high; the cableway was very easily operated back and forth along the work. The cableway
complete, with 497 ft. of six-rail track for each tower, cost $4,700. The cost of materials
and labor for the 8,994 cu. yds. of concrete was as follows:

                                      Per cu. yd.
1 bbl. cement at $2.46                      $2.46

The above batch tamped in place to 30 cu. ft., or 1-1/9 cu. yds., which gives the cost as follows:

                                         Per cu. yd.
Cost of concrete tamped in place              $5.381

Total cost                                    $5.751

In the preceding prices of cement and stone, 59 cts. and 29 cts. per cubic yard, respectively,
are included for storage. The costs of sand and shells are costs of screening and storing.
Rough lumber for forms cost $10.25, and dressed lumber $12.75 per M. ft. B. M.

~Emplacement for Battery, Tampa Bay, Fla.~--The emplacement contained 6,654 cu. yds. of Portland
cement, sand, shells and broken stone concrete. The plant arrangement is shown by Fig. 69.
The sand and shells were got near the site, using an inclined cableway running from a 40-ft.
mast near the mixer to a deadman at the shell bank. All the sand for the fill around the emplacement
was obtained in the same way. The other materials were brought by vessel to a wharf, loaded
by derrick onto cars operated by an endless cable, and taken to the work. The storage bins
and mixing plant were operated much like those for the mortar battery work, previously described.
A cube mixer was used, and the concrete was handled from it to the work by a crane derrick
covering a circle of 100 ft. in diameter. The cost of materials and concrete was as follows:

Cement, plus 7 cts. for storage per bbl.            $ 2.532
Stone, plus 38 cts. for storage per cu. yd.           3.047

      Total for 30 cu. ft.                 $ 6.284

This gives a cost per cubic yard of concrete in place as follows:

     Total cost of concrete per cu. yd.    $ 5.875

~United States Fortification Work.~--The following methods and cost of mixing and placing concrete
by hand and by cubical mixers is given by Mr. L. R. Grabill for U. S. Government fortification
work done in 1899.

Hand Mixing and Placing.--The work was done by contract, using a 1 cement, 2 sand, 2 pebbles
and 3 stone mixture turned four times. A board large enough for three batches at a time was
used; one batch was being placed, one being mixed and one being removed at the same time so
that the mixers moved without interval from one to the other. Two gangs were worked, each mixing
64 batches of 0.75 cu. yd., or 48 cu. yds. of concrete per day at the following cost:

                                            Per      Per

      Totals                              $39.25    $0.82

The entire cost of plant for this work was about $500.

Machine Mixing and Placing.--The concrete was mixed in a 4-ft. cubical mixer operated by a
12 hp. engine which also hauled the material cars up the incline to the mixer. These cars passed
by double track under the material bins where the compartments of the car body were filled
through trap doors; they then passed the cement house where the cement was placed on the load,
then up the incline to the mixer and dumped, and then empty down an opposite incline. Seven
turns of the mixer mixed the charge which was discharged into iron tubs on cars hauled by horses
to two derricks whose booms covered the work. One gang by day labor mixed and placed 168 batches
of 0.7 cu. yd., or 117.6 cu. yds. per day at the following cost:

~LOCK WALLS, CASCADES CANAL.~--Four-fifths or 70,000 cu. yds. of lock masonry was concrete,
the bulk of which was mixed and deposited by the plant shown by Fig. 70. The concrete was Portland
cement, sand, gravel and broken stone. Cement was brought in in barrels by railway, stored
and tested; from the store house the barrels were loaded onto cars and taken 250 ft. to a platform
onto which the barrels were emptied and from which the cement was shoveled into the cement
hopper and chuted to cars which took it to the charging hopper of the mixer. The stone was
crushed from spalls and waste ends from the stone cutting yards, where stone for wall lining
and coping and other special parts was prepared. These spalls and ends were brought in cars
and dumped into the hopper of a No. 5 Gates crusher, with a capacity of 30 tons per hour. From
the crusher the stone passed to a 2½-in. screen, the pieces passing going to a bin below and
the rejections going to a smaller Blake crusher and thence to the bin. The dust and small particles
were not screened out. The sand and gravel were obtained by screening and washing pit gravel.
The gravel was excavated and brought in cars to the washer. This consisted of a steel cylinder
2 ft. 6½ ins. in diameter and about 18 ft. long, having an inclination of 1 in. per foot. An
axial gudgeon supported the cylinder at the lower end and it rested on rollers at the other
end and at an intermediate point. The gravel was fed by hopper and chute into the upper end
and into this same end a 3-in. perforated pipe projected and extended to about mid-length of
the cylinder. The cylinder shell was solid and provided with internal fins for about half its
length from the feed end. For the remainder of its length nearly to the end, the shell was
perforated with 2½-in. holes. For a length of 4 ft. beyond mid-point it was encircled by a
concentric screen of 1/8-in. holes, and this screen for 3 ft. of its length was encircled by
another screen of 30 meshes to the inch. The pit mixture fed into the cylinder was gradually
passed along by the combined inclination and rotation, being washed and screened in the process.
The sand fell into one bin and the gravel into another, and the waste water was carried away
by a flume. The large stones passed out through openings at the lower end of the shell and
were chuted into cars. The cars came to the mixer as clearly shown by Fig. 70.

The stone and gravel cars were side dump and the cement car was bottom dump. The mixers were
of the cube type 4 ft. on each edge and operated by a 7×12-in. double cylinder engine at nine
revolutions per minute. The usual charge was 32 cu. ft. of the several ingredients, and it
was found that 15 revolutions requiring about 1½ minutes were sufficient for mixing. The average
work of one mixer was 17 batches or about 13 cu. yds. per hour, but this could be speeded up
to 20 batches per hour when the materials were freely supplied and the output freely removed.
Two cars took the concrete from the mixer to the hopper, from which it was fed to the work
by chute. The hopper was mounted on a truck and the chute was a wrought iron cylinder trussed
on four sides and having a 45° elbow at the lower end to prevent scattering. The chute fed
into a car running along the wall and distributing the material. It was found impracticable
to move the chute readily enough to permit of feeding the concrete directly into place. As
the concreting progressed upward the trestle was extended and the chute shortened. It was found
that wear would soon disable a steel chute so that the main trussed cylinder had a smaller,
cheaply made cylinder placed inside as a lining to take the wear and be replaced when necessary.

The plant described worked very successfully. Records based on 9,614.4 cu. yds. of concrete
laid, gave the following:

The average mixture was 1 cement, 3.7 sand, 4.8 gravel and 2.6 broken stone. The average product
was 1.241 cu. yds. concrete per barrel of cement and 1.116 cu. yds. of concrete per cubic yard
of stone and gravel. The average materials for 1 cu. yd. of concrete were: Cement 0.805 bbl.,
sand 0.456 cu. yd., gravel 0.579 cu. yd., and stone 0.317 cu. yd.

~LOCKS, COOSA RIVER, ALABAMA.~--The following methods and costs are given by Mr. Charles Firth
for constructing lock No. 31 for the Coosa River canalization, Alabama. This lock is 420 ft.
long over all, 322 ft. between quoins, 52 ft. clear width, 14.7 ft. lift and 8 ft. depth of
water on sills; it contained 20,000 cu. yds. of concrete requiring 21,500 bbls. cement, half
Alsen and half Atlas.

Figure 71 shows the concrete mixing plant, consisting of two 4×4 ft. cube mixer, driven by
a 10×16-in. engine. The top floor of the mixer house stored the cement, 2,000 bbls. The concrete
was a 1-3-5½ stone mixture. Each mixer charge consisted of 3 cu. ft. cement, 9 cu. ft. sand
and 16.5 cu. ft. stone; the charge was turned over four times before and six times after watering
at a speed not exceeding eight revolutions per minute. The average output of the plant was
200 cu. yds. per 8-hour day, or 100 cu. yds. per mixer, but it was limited by the means for
placing.

The concrete was mixed dry, deposited in 6 to 8-in. layers, and rammed with 30-lb. iron rammers
with 6-in. square faces. For all exposed surfaces a 6-in. facing of 1-3 mortar was placed by
setting 2×12-in. planks 4 ins. from the laggings, being kept to distance by 2×4-in. spacers,
placing and ramming the concrete behind them, then withdrawing them, filling the 6-in. space
with mortar and tamping it to bond with the concrete. The walls were carried up in lifts, each
lift being completed entirely around the lock before beginning the next; the first lift was
10.7 ft. high and the others 6 ft., except the last, which was 4.5 ft., exclusive of the 18-in.
coping. The coping was constructed of separately molded blocks 3 ft. long, made of 1-2-3 concrete
faced with 1-1 mortar and having edges rounded to 3 ins. radius.

In constructing the forms a row of 6×8-in. posts 24 ft. long and 5 to 7 ft. apart was set up
along the inside of each wall and a similar row of posts 12 ft. long was set up along the outside.
From the tops of the short posts 6×8-in. caps reached across the wall and were bolted to the
long posts; these caps carried the stringers for the concrete car tracks. The lagging consisted
of 3×10-in. planks dressed on all sides. The backs of the walls were stepped and as each step
was completed the rear 12-ft. posts were lifted to a footing on its top and carried in the
necessary distance. The front posts remained undisturbed until the wall was completed. The
lagging was moved up as the filling progressed. As no tie bolts were permitted, these forms
required elaborate bracing.

From the mixing plant, which was located on the bank above reach of floods, the concrete cars
were dropped by elevator to the level of the track over the walls and then run along the wall
and dumped onto platforms inside the forms and just below the track. This arrangement was adopted,
because it was found that even a small drop separated the stone from the mortar. The concrete
was shoveled from the platforms to place and rammed. The cars were bottom dumping with a single
door hinged at the side; this door when swinging back struck the track stringers and jarred
the form so that constant attention was necessary to keep it in line. It would have been much
better to have had double doors swinging endwise of the car. Another point noted was that unless
the track was high enough to give good head room at the close of a lift the placing and ramming
were not well done.

The cost of 8,710 cu. yds. of concrete placed during 1895 by day labor employing negroes at
$1 per 8-hour day was as follows per cubic yard:

1 bbl. cement                                   $2.48
0.88 cu. yd. stone at $0.76                      0.67

Total                                           $4.57

~LOCK WALLS, ILLINOIS & MISSISSIPPI CANAL.~--The locks and practically all other masonry for
the Illinois & Mississippi Canal are of concrete. The following account of the methods and
cost of doing this concrete work is taken from information published by Mr. J. W. Woermann
in 1894 and special information furnished by letter. The decision to use concrete was induced
by the fact that no suitable stone for masonry was readily available (the local stone was a
flinty limestone, usually without bed, or, at best, in thin irregular strata, and cracked in
all directions with the cracks filled with fire clay) while good sand and gravel and good stone
for crushing were plentifully at hand. The concrete work done in 1893-4 comprised dam abutments,
piers for Taintor gates and locks.

Dam Abutments.--Four dam abutments were constructed, three of which were L-shaped, with sides
next to the river 40 ft. long and sides extending into the banks 20 ft. long; the top thickness
was 3 ft., the faces were vertical and the backs stepped with treads of 14 to 16 ins., and
the width of base was 0.4 of the height. Each of these abutments was built in four 30-cu. yd.
sections, each section being a day's work. The forms consisted of 2×8-in. planks, dressed on
both sides, 2×8-in. studs spaced 2 ft. on centers and 4×6-in. braces. For the first two of
the four abutments, the forms were erected in sections, the alternate sections being first
erected and filled. When these sections had hardened the forms were shifted to the vacant sections
and lined up to and braced against the completed sections. This method did not give well aligned
walls, so in subsequent work the forms were erected all at once.

The concrete was mixed by hand. The sand and cement were mixed dry, being turned four times
and spread in a layer Pebbles and broken stone previously wetted were spread over the sand
and cement and the whole turned four times, the last turn being into wheelbarrows; about five
common buckets of water were added during the mixing. The mixture sought was one that would
ram without quaking. Two forms of rammers were used; for work next to forms a 4×6-in. rammer
and for inside work 6-in diameter circular rammer weighing 20 lbs. The gang mixing and placing
concrete consisted usually of:

    Item.                                Per Day.    Per Cu. Yd.

Total, 26 men                              $39.00       $1.30

These cubic yard costs are based on 30 cu. yds. of wall completed per 8-hour day. The cost
in detail of two abutments containing 254 cu. yds. was per cubic yard as follows:

     Item.                                          Per Cu. Yd.

[Footnote D: Charging ¼ of first cost of $18 per M. ft.]

[Footnote E: Carpenters $3.50, laborers $1.50 per day; there was one laborer to two carpenters.]

The large amount of cement 1.65 bbls. per cubic yard was due to facing the abutments with 8
ins. of 1-2 mortar. The concrete in the body of the wall was 1 cement, 2 sand, 2 gravel and
2 broken stone mixture. A dry mixture was used and this fact is reflected in the cost of ramming,
25 cts. per cu. yd. The cost of mixing was also high.

Piers for Taintor Gates.--The masonry at this point consisted of three piers 6×30 ft., and
two abutments 30 ft. long, 6 ft. thick at base and 4 ft. thick at top, with wing walls; it
amounted to 460 cu. yds. The feet of the inclined braces were set into gains in the horizontal
braces and held by an 8-in. lag screw; after the posts were plumbed a block was lag-screwed
at the upper end of each brace. These forms proved entirely satisfactory. The cost of the work
per cubic yard was as follows:

Mixing Plant.--The concrete for all the lock work of 1893-4 was mixed by the plant shown by
Figs. 72 and 73. The mixer plant proper consisted of a king truss carried by two A-frames of
unequal height; under the higher end of the truss was a frame carrying a 4-ft. cubical mixer
and under the lower end a pit for a charging box holding 40 cu. ft. This charging box was hoisted
by ½-in. steel cable running through a pair of double blocks as shown; the slope of the lower
chord of the truss was such that the cable hoisted the box and carried it forward without the
use of any latching devices. On two sides of the pit were tracks from the sand and stone piles
and on the other two sides were the cement platform and water tank. The charging box dumped
into the hopper above the mixer and the mixer discharged into cars underneath. A 15-HP. engine
operated the hoist by one pulley and the mixer by the other pulley. Nine revolutions of the
mixer made a perfect mixture. The plant as illustrated was slightly changed as the result of
experience in constructing the guard lock. The charging hopper was lowered 6 ins. and the space
between the mixer and lower platform reduced by 9 ins.; diagonal braces were also inserted
under the timbers carrying the mixer axles. This plant cost for framing and erection $300 and
for machinery delivered $706. The crushing plant shown by Fig. 73 consisted of a No. 2 Gates

Guard Lock.--The forms employed in constructing the guard lock are shown by Fig. 74, and in
this drawing the trestle and platform for the concrete cars are to be noted. The walls were
concreted in sections. A batch of concrete consisted of 1 bbl. cement, 10 cu. ft. sand and
20 cu. ft. crushed stone. The average run per 8-hour day was 40 batches of facing and 60 batches
concrete, representing 100 bbls. cement. The gang worked was as follows:

The percentages of cost in this statement have been calculated by the authors upon the assumption
that each laborer received one-half as much wages as each engineman, foreman and horse and
driver per 8 hours, which would make the total daily wages equivalent to the wages of 57 men.
Wages of common labor were $1.50 per day. Considering the size of the gang the output of 40
batches of mortar and 60 batches of concrete per day was very small. The total yardage of concrete
in the guard lock was 3,762 cu. yds., 2,212 cu. yds. in the walls and 1,550 cu. yds. in foundations,
culverts, etc. Its cost per cubic yard was made up as follows:

Lock No. 37.--The character of the forms used in constructing the lock walls is shown by Fig.
75. The walls were built in sections and work was continuous with three 8-hour shifts composed
about as specified for the guard lock work except that one or two men were added in several
places making the total number 58 men. The average output per shift was 65 batches of concrete
and 31 batches of facing mortar. The cost of the work, comprising 3,767 cu. yds., was as follows:

Lock No. 36.--The forms used were of the construction shown by Fig. 75. Three shifts were worked,
each composed as specified for the guard lock, except that the number of tampers and spreaders
was doubled, bringing the gang up to 65 men. The average output per gang per shift was 76 batches
of concrete and 35 batches of facing mortar. The cost of 2,141 cu. yds. of concrete in this
lock was as follows:

The preceding data, made public by Mr. Woermann in 1894, are supplemented by the following
information prepared for the authors:

"If any criticism was to be made of the concrete masonry erected in 1893 and 1894, it would
probably be to the effect that it was too expensive. The cost of the masonry erected during
those two seasons was $8 to $9 per cu. yd. Our records showed that about 45 per cent. of this
cost was for Portland cement alone, and moreover, that 40 per cent. of the total cement used
at a lock was placed in the 8-in. facing and 5-in. coping. So in the seven locks erected in
1895 on the eastern section, the facing was reduced to 3 ins. and the proportions changed from
1-2 to 1-2½.

"In 1898 this cost received another severe cut, and Major Marshall's instructions stated that
the facing should not exceed 1½ ins. in thickness nor be less than ¾-in., while the layer of
fine material on top of the coping was to be only sufficient to cover the stone and gravel.
The amount of sand was again increased so that the proportions were 1-3.

"The cost of the Portland cement concrete was likewise cheapened by increasing the amount of
aggregates. On the earlier work the proportions were 1-2-2-3, while on the work in 1898 the
proportions were 1-4-4. The cost of the walls was further cheapened by using Utica cement in
the lower steps of the wall, with 2 ft. of Portland cement concrete on the face. The proportions
used in the Utica cement concrete were 1-2½-2½. This lower step is one-third of the height,
or about 7 ft.

"The forms were of the same character as those used on the first locks, except that for lining
the inner face, 3×10-in. hard pine planks were substituted for the 4×8-in. white pine. The
hard pine was damaged less by the continuous handling, and the cost was practically the same.
There was also an important change made in the manner of fastening the plank to the 8×10-in.
posts. A strip 1¾ ins. square was thoroughly nailed to each post, once for all, with 20d. spikes,
and the planking was then nailed from the outside, as shown in Fig. 76. This kept the face
of the plank in a perfectly smooth condition, and prevented the formation of the little knobs
on the face of the concrete which represented all the old nail holes. This style of forming
was also easier to take apart after the setting of the concrete. Rough pine planks, 2×12-in.,
were used for the back of the form, the same as before.

"In order to keep ahead of the concrete force it was necessary to use two gangs of carpenters,
erecting the forms for the next two locks. Each gang consisted of about 20 carpenters (at $2.25)
and 10 helpers (at $1.50); but men were transferred from one to the other, according to the
stage of completion of the two locks. In addition to these two gangs, two carpenters were on
duty with each concrete shift to put in the steps in the back of the forms. Sufficient lumber
was required for the forms for three complete locks, and 14 locks (Nos. 8 to 21) were built.

"The same type of mixer has been used as on the earlier work at Milan, namely, a 4-ft. cubical
steel box mounted on corners diagonally opposite. On account of the greater number of locks
to be built on the eastern section, however, two mixers were found necessary, so that while
the concrete force was at work at one lock, the carpenters and helpers were erecting the mixer
at the next lock. The facing was mixed by hand. After turning over the dry cement and sand
at least twice with shovels, the mixture was then cast through a No. 5 sieve, after which the
water was incorporated slowly by the use of a sprinkling can so as to avoid washing. The secret
of good concrete, after the selection of good materials, is thorough mixing and hard tamping.
Each batch of concrete, consisting of about 1.2 cu. yds. in place, was turned in the mixer
for not less than 2 mins. at the rate of 9 revolutions per minute. The amount of tamping is
indicated by the fact that about 16 men out of 72 on each shift did nothing but tamp. The rammers
used were 6 ins. square and weighed 33 lbs. The bottom of the rammer consisted of three ridges,
each 1-in. in height, so as to make more bond between the successive layers.

"On the eastern section the top of the lock walls was higher above the ground, as a rule, than
at the Milan locks, and the cars were run up an incline with a small hoisting engine. A 15-HP.
portable engine and boiler operated the bucket hoist from one pulley, the mixer from the other
pulley, and also furnished steam for the hoist which pulled the cars up the incline. The incline
made an angle of about 30° with the ground. The practice of carrying on two sections at once
was continued the same as on the western section. Each main wall was systematically divided
into 11 sections, making each section about 20 ft. long. The corners of the coping were dressed
to a quadrant of about 3 ins. radius with a round trowel like those used on cement walks. In
fact, the whole method of finishing the coping was the same as is used on concrete walks. The
mortar was put on rather wet and then allowed to stand for about 20 mins. before finishing.
This allowed the water to come to the surface and prevented the formation of the fine water
cracks which are sometimes seen on concrete work. After its final set the coping was covered
with several inches of fine gravel which was kept wet for at least a week.

"The last concrete laid during the season was in November, on Lock No. 21, and Aqueducts Nos.
2 and 3. Portions of these structures were built when the temperature was below freezing. The
water was warmed to about 60° or 70° F., by discharging exhaust steam into the tank. Salt was
used only in the facing, simply sufficient to make the water taste saline. The maximum amount
used on the coldest night when the temperature was about 20° F. was 1½ per cent.

The concrete force on each shift was as follows:

~COST OF HAND MIXING AND PLACING, CANAL LOCK FOUNDATION.~--Mr. Geo. P. Hawley gives the following
record of mixing and placing 4,000 cu. yds. of 1-4½ gravel concrete for the foundation of a
lock constructed for the Illinois and Mississippi Canal in 1897. The concrete was mixed on
14×16-ft. board platforms, from which it was shoveled directly into place. The materials were
brought to the board in wheelbarrows. Two boards were used, the usual gang for each being 4
men wheeling gravel, 4 men mixing, 1 man sprinkling, 2 men depositing and leveling and 2 men
tamping. The two gangs were worked against each other. Ten hours constituted a day's work,
and the average time and cost per cubic yard for mixing and placing were:

                                                    Cts.

Foreman, 0.21 hr., at 30 cts                        6.30

~BREAKWATER AT MARQUETTE, MICH.~--The breakwater extends out from the shore and consists of
a prism of concrete resting on timber cribs filled with stone. Originally the cribs carried
a timber superstructure; this was removed to give place to the concrete work. A typical cross-section
of the concrete prism is shown by Fig. 77; the prism is 23 ft. wide on the base. Farther in
shore the base width was reduced to 20 ft., and in the shore section the prism was changed
to a triangular trapezoid by continuing the first slope to the bottom cutting off the berm
and second slope. The wooden structure was removed to a level 1 ft. below mean low water and
on it a concrete footing approximately 2 ft. thick was constructed for the prism proper. This
footing reached the full width of the crib and was constructed in various ways during the 5
years through which the work continued. At first the footing concrete was deposited loose under
water by means of bottom dumping buckets; later the stone filling of the cribs was simply leveled
up by depositing concrete in bags, and last toe and heel blocks were molded and set flush with
the sides of the crib and filled between. Methods of construction and records of cost are reported
for portions only of the work and these are given here.

Footing Placed under Water with Buckets.--Besides the material track which was constructed
along the old wooden structure the plant consisted of a mixing scow and a derrick scow, which
were moored alongside the work. The sand, stone and cement were brought out in cars between
working hours and stored on the mixing scow, enough for one day's work at a time. The derrick
handled a 40-cu. ft. bottom dump bucket, which sat in a well on the mixing scow with its top
flush with the deck. The concrete was mixed by hand on the deck and shoveled into the bucket;
the bucket was then handled by the derrick to the crib and lowered and dumped under water.
The gang consisted of 24 men, 1 foreman, 1 master laborer, 14 men shoveling and mixing, 3 men
wheeling materials, 1 derrick man and 3 men placing and depositing concrete. No record of output
of this gang is available. The cost of the concrete in place with wages $1.25 to $1.40 per
day for common labor is given as follows:

These figures are based on some 757 cu. yds. of concrete footing. In explanation of the items
of burlap, etc., it should be said that the cribs were carpeted with burlap to prevent waste
of concrete into the stone fill.

Leveling Off Cribs with Concrete in Bags.--The sketch, Fig. 78, shows the method of leveling
off the cribs with concrete in bags. The concrete was mixed by hand on shore and filled into
8-oz. burlap bags, 6 ft. long and 80 ins. around, holding 2,000 lbs. The bags were filled while
lying in position in a skip holding one bag. A skip was lifted by gallows frame and tackle
onto a car and run out to the work where the derrick scow handled the skip to the crib, lowered
it into the water and dumped the bag. The cost of making and placing some 375 cu. yds. of concrete
in bags is given as follows:

with a 2×8-in. dressed plank floor on 12×12-in. sills. The floor formed the bottoms of the
block molds. Four molds were used, each consisting of four sides. Three laborers molded one
block, 2.22 cu. yds. per day, wheeling, mixing, erecting and removing forms, placing concrete
and doing all other work. The cost of making 40 blocks was recorded as follows:

Molding Concrete Prism in Place.--The concrete prism was molded in alternate sections 10 ft.
long; the form for the isolated sections consisted of eight pieces so constructed that when
assembled in place and secured with bolts and turnbuckles the form was self-contained as to
strength and required no outside support or bracing. The form once in place, all that remained
to be done was to fill it, the block with the gallery through it being molded in one operation.
The forms for the connecting blocks consisted of two slope panels, a panel for the harbor face
and the gallery form, the blocks previously molded making the other sides of the form. The
concrete was mixed by hand on shore, conveyed to the work in 1 cu. yd. cars and shoveled into
the forms, where it was rammed with 35-lb. rammers. The following record covers 1,231 cu. yds.
of concrete prism. In this concrete some 214 cu. yds. of rubble stone were embedded. The costs
given are as follows:

~BREAKWATER, BUFFALO, N. Y.~--The following methods and costs of mixing and placing some 2,561
cu. yds. of concrete are given by Mr. Emile Low, for 10 parapet wall sections and 17 parapet
deck sections for a breakwater at Buffalo, N. Y.

The concrete used was a 1 cement, 1 gravel, 1 sand grit and 4 unscreened broken stone. One
bag of cement was assumed to measure 0.9 cu. ft. The voids in the sand grit and gravel were
27 per cent. and in the unscreened stone 39 per cent. The hardened concrete weighed 152 lbs.
per cu. ft.

Figure 80 shows the arrangement of the mixing plant. The mixer was a 5-ft. cube mixer holding
125 cu. ft., mounted on a trestle and operated by a 9×12-in. horizontal engine taking steam
from a 4×10-ft. locomotive boiler, also supplying steam to two derrick engines. The material
scow contained two pockets for sand, one for gravel and one housed over for cement. Two inside
cement men passed out the bags in lots of six to one outside cement man who cut and emptied
them into the charging bucket. Three sand shovelers each loaded a 3.6 cu. ft. barrow and wheeled
them tandem to the bucket, and two gravel men each loaded a 2.7 cu. ft. barrow and wheeled
them tandem to the bucket. The broken stone was loaded by eight shovelers into another bucket,
also containing 21.6 cu. ft. The two buckets were alternately hoisted and emptied into the
mixer hopper, there being a dump man on the mixer who dumped the buckets and attended to the
water supply. A charger put the mixer in operation and when the charge was mixed the car men
dumped it into a skip resting on a small car which was then run out on the track under the
mixer to the derrick which handled the skip to the work. Derrick A handled the materials from
the scows and derrick B handled the mixed concrete. The force on the derricks consisted of
two enginemen, four tagmen and the fireman.

The ten parapet wall sections containing 841 cu. yds. were built in 46 hours, making 17 batches
of 1.07 cu. yds., or 18.2 cu. yds. placed per hour. The 17 parapet deck sections containing
1,720 cu. yds. were built in 88 hours, making 18.8 batches of 1.08 cu. yds., or 19.5 cu. yds.
placed per hour. For the parapet deck work the force was increased by 2 men handling materials
and 1 man on the mixer. The labor cost of mixing and placing the concrete was as follows:

~PIER CONSTRUCTION, PORT COLBORNE, ONT.~--In constructing the new harbor at Port Colborne,
Ont., on Lake Erie, the piers consisted of parallel rows of timber cribs set the width of the
pier apart and filled in and between with stone blasted and dredged from the lake bottom in
deepening the harbor. The tops of the cribs terminated below water level and were surmounted
by concrete walls set on the outer edges. These walls were filled between with stone and the
top of the filling was floored part way or entirely across, as the case might be, with a thick
concrete slab. The footings of the walls to just above the water level were made of concrete
blocks 4½×4×7 ft., constructed as shown by Fig. 81. The wall above the footing course and the
floor slab were of concrete molded in place. The concrete work consisted of molding and setting
concrete blocks and of molding concrete wall and slab in place.

The blocks were molded on shore, shipped to the work on scows and set in place by a derrick.
Figure 82 shows the construction of the forms for molding the blocks; the bottom tie rods passed
through the partitions forming the ends of the molds. The sides were removed in 48 hours and
used over again. Figure 83 shows the hooks used for handling the molded blocks. Considerable
trouble was had in setting these blocks level and close jointed, owing to the difficulty of
leveling up the stone filling under water.

The mass concrete was mixed and placed by the scow plant, shown by Fig. 84. The scow was loaded
with sufficient sand and cement for a day's work and towed to and moored alongside the pier.
Forms were set for the wall on top of the block footing. These forms were placed in lengths
of 60 to 75 ft. of wall and resembled the block forms with partitions omitted. The bottoms
of the rear uprights were held by being wedged into the grooves in the blocks, and the bottoms
of the front uprights were held by bolts resting on top of the blocks. The tops of the uprights
were held together across the wall by tie bolts. The forms being placed, the mode of procedure
was as follows:

The crusher fed directly into a measuring box. After some 6 ins. of stone had run into the
box the door of the crusher spout was closed. A wheelbarrow load of sand was spread over the
stone in the box and over this were emptied and spread two or three bags of cement. Another
layer of stone and then of sand and of cement were put in and these operations repeated until
the box was full. The box was then hoisted and dumped into the hopper of a gravity mixer of
the trough type which ran along a track on the scow and fed directly into the forms. The gang
worked consisted of 1 foreman, 1 derrickman and 18 common laborers. This gang placed from 65
to 75 cu. yds. of concrete per day at a labor cost of 50 cts. per cu. yd.

~CONCRETE BLOCK PIER, SUPERIOR ENTRY, WIS.~--The methods and cost of constructing a concrete
pier 3,023 ft. long and of the cross-section shown by Fig. 85 at Superior entry, Wisconsin,
are given in the following paragraphs.

Molds and Molding.--About 80 per cent. of the concrete was deposited in molds under water,
according to a plan devised by Major D. D. Galliard, corps of engineers. In brief the concrete
was built in place in two tiers of blocks, the lower tier resting directly on piles and being
entirely under water and the upper tier being almost entirely above water. As shown by Fig.
85, a pile trestle was built on each side of the proposed pier and a traveler for raising and
lowering the molds spanned the space between trestles.

The molds were bottomless boxes built in four pieces, two sides and two ends, held together
by tie rods. Fig. 86 shows an end and a side of one of the shallow water molds and Fig. 87
shows in detail the method of fastening the end to the side. It will be seen that the 1¼-in.
turnbuckle rods pass through the ends of beams that bear against the outside of the mold. These
tie rods have eyes at each end in which rods with wedge-shaped ends are inserted. The molds
were erected on the trestle by a locomotive crane and were then lifted by the mold traveler,
carried and lowered into place. The largest one of these molds with its iron ballast, weighed
40 tons. To remove a mold, after the block had hardened, the nuts on the wedge-ended rods were
turned, thus pulling the wedge end from the eye of the tie rod and releasing the sides of the
mold from the ends. The locomotive crane then raised the ends and sides, one at a time, and
assembled them ready to be lowered again for the next block. The time required to remove one
of these 40-ton molds, reassemble and set it again rarely exceeded 60 minutes and was sometimes
reduced to 45 minutes.

The concrete was deposited in alternate blocks and the molds described were for the first blocks;
for the intermediate blocks molds of two side pieces alone were used, the blocks already in
place serving in lieu of end pieces. The two side pieces were bolted together with three tie
rods at each end; the tie rods were encased in a box of 1-in. boards 4×4 ins. inside which
served as a strut to prevent the sides from closing together and as a means of permitting the
tie rods to be removed after the concrete had set. The mold was knocked down just as was the
full mold described above and the boxes encasing the tie rods were left in the concrete.

An important feature was the device for handling the molds; this, as before stated, was a traveler,
which straddled the pier site, it having a gage of 31 ft. It carried a four-drum engine, the
drums of which were actuated, either separately or together, by a worm gear so as to operate
positively in lowering as well as in raising. The load was hung from four hooks, depending
by double blocks and 5/8-in. wire rope from four trolleys suspended from the trusses of the
traveler; this arrangement allowed a lateral adjustment of the mold. The hoisting speed was
6 ft. per minute and the traveling speed 100 ft. per minute. The locomotive crane also deserves
mention because it was mounted on a gantry high enough to permit material cars to pass under
it on the same trestle, thus making it practicable to work two cranes.

The concrete was received from the mixer into drop bottom buckets of the form shown by Fig.
88. The buckets were taken to the work four at once on cars, and there lifted by the locomotive
crane and lowered into the mold where they were dumped by tripping a latch connected by rope
to the crane. To prevent the concrete from washing, the open tops of the buckets were covered
with 3×4 ft. pieces of 12-oz. canvas in which were quilted 110 pieces of 1/16×1×3-in sheets
of lead. Two covers were used on each bucket and were attached one to each side of the bucket
top so as to fold over the top with a lap. This arrangement was entirely successful for its
purpose.

Concrete Mixing.--The proportions of the subaqueous concrete were 1-2½-5 by volume, or 1-2.73-5.78
by weight, cement being assumed to weigh 100 lbs. per cu. ft.; the proportions of the superaqueous
concrete were 1-3.12-6.25 by volume, or 1-3.41-7.22 by weight. The dry sand weighed 109.2 lbs.
per cu. ft., the voids being 35.1 per cent.; the pebbles weighed 115.5 lbs. per cu. ft., the
voids being 31 per cent.

The pebbles for the concrete were delivered by contract and were unloaded from scows by clam-shell
bucket into a hopper. This hopper fed onto an endless belt conveyor which delivered the pebbles
to a rotary screen. Inside this screen water was discharged under a pressure of 60 lbs. per
sq. in. from a 4-in. pipe to wash the pebbles. From the screen the pebbles passed through a
chute into 4-cu. yd cars which were hauled up an incline to a height of 65 ft. by means of
a hoisting engine. The cars were dumped automatically, forming a stock pile. Under the stock
pile was a double gallery or tunnel provided with eight chutes through the roof and from these
chutes the cars were loaded and hauled by a hoisting engine up an inclined trestle to the bins
above the concrete mixer. The sand was handled from the stock pile in the same manner. The
cement was loaded in bags on a car in the warehouse, hauled to the mixer and elevated by a
sprocket chain elevator.

Chutes from the bins delivered the materials into the concrete mixer, which was of the Chicago
Improved Cube type, revolving on trunnions about an axial line through diagonal corners of
the cube. The mixer possessed the advantage of charging and discharging without stopping. It
was driven by a 7×10-in. vertical engine with boiler. The mixer demonstrated its ability to
turn out a batch of perfectly mixed concrete every 1-1/3 minutes. It discharged into a hopper
provided with a cut-off chute which discharged into the concrete buckets on the cars.

Labor Force and Costs.--In the operation of the plant 55 men were employed, 43 being engaged
on actual concrete work and 12 building molds and appliances for future work. The work was
done by day labor for the government and the cost of operation was as follows for one typical
week, when in six days of eight hours each, the output was 1,383 cu. yds., or an average of
230 cu. yds. per day. The output on one day was considerably below the average on account of
an accident to the plant, but this may be considered as typical.

$0.5861

The total cost of each cubic yard of concrete in place was estimated to be as follows:

                                                          Per cu. yd.

Total                                                         $4.6427

It will be noted that the sand cost nothing as it was dredged from the trench in which the
pier was built, and paid for as dredging. The cost of the plant is distributed over this south
pier and over the proposed north pier work on the basis of only 20 per cent. salvage value
after the completion of both piers. It is said, however, that 80 per cent. is too high an allowance
for the probable depreciation.

~DAM, RICHMOND, INDIANA.~--The dam shown in cross-section in Fig. 89 was built at Richmond,
Ind. It was 120 ft. long and was built between the abutments of a dismantled bridge. The concrete
was made in the proportion of 1 bbl. Portland cement to 1 cu. yd. of gravel; old iron was used
for reinforcement. The foundations were put down by means of a cofferdam which was kept dry
by pumping. On completion it was found that there was a tendency to scour in front of the apron
and accordingly piling was driven and the intervening space rip-rapped with large stone. Labor
was paid as follows per day: Foreman, $3; carpenter, $2.50; cement finisher, $2; laborers,
$1.50. The concrete was mixed by hand and wheeled to place in wheelbarrows. The cost of the
work was as follows:

~DAM AT ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL, ILLINOIS.~--The dam was in the shape of an L with one side 192
ft. and the other side 208 ft. long; it consists of a wall 30½ ft. high, 3½ ft. wide at the
top and 6½ ft. wide at the bottom with a counterfort every 16 ft., 26 in all. Each counterfort
extended back 16 ft. and was 4 ft. thick for a height of 6 ft. and then 3 ft. thick. There
were 3,500 cu. yds. of concrete in the work, which was done by day labor under the direction
of the U. S. Engineer in charge.

The forms consisted of front and back uprights of 8×10-in. stuff 24 ft. high, connected through
the wall by ¾-in. rods which were left in the concrete. The lagging was 2×12-in. plank dressed
down 1¾ ins. placed inside the uprights. These forms were built full height in 16-ft. sections
with a counterfort coming at the center of each section. Each section contained 95 cu. yds.
of concrete and was filled in a day's work. The concrete was a 1-4-7 mixture wet enough to
quake when rammed. Run of crusher limestone was used of which 50 per cent. passed a 1-in. sieve,
17 per cent. a No. 3 sieve and 9 per cent. a No. 8 sieve. The concrete was mixed in Cockburn
Barrow & Machine Co.'s screw-feed mixer which discharged into 2-in. plank skips 2 ft. wide
5-1/3 ft. long and 14 ins. deep, holding ¼ cu. yd. These skips were taken on cars to a derrick
crane overhanging the forms and by it hoisted and dumped into the forms. The derrick was moved
along a track at the foot of the wall as the work progressed. The concrete was spread and rammed
in 6-in. layers. The men were paid $1.50 per 8-hour's work and the work cost including footing,
as follows:

~DAM AT McCALL FERRY, PA.~--The dam was 2,700 ft. long and 48 ft. high of the cross-section
shown by Fig. 90 and with its subsidiary works required some 350,000 cu. yds. of concrete.
The plant for mixing and placing the concrete was notable chiefly for its size and cost. Parallel
to the dam, which extended straight across the river, and just below its toe a service bridge
consisting of a series of 40-ft. concrete arch spans was built across the river. This service
bridge was 50 ft. wide and carried four standard gage railway tracks besides a traveling crane
track of 44 ft. gage. This very heavy construction of a temporary structure was necessitated
by the frequency of floods against which only a solid bridge could stand; it was considered
cheaper in the long run to provide a bridge which would certainly last through the work than
to chance a structure of less cost which would certainly go out with the floods. The concrete
service bridge was designed to be destroyed by blasting when the dam had been completed. The
method of construction was to build the dam in alternate 40 ft. sections, mixing the concrete
on shore, taking it out along the service bridge in buckets on cars and handling the buckets
from cars to forms by traveling cranes.

The concrete mixing plant is shown by Fig. 91. Cars loaded with cement, sand and stone were
brought in over the tracks carried on the wall tops of the bins and were unloaded respectively
into bins A, B and C, of which there were eight sets. Each set supplied material by means of
measuring cars to a 1 cu. yd. Smith mixer. Two sets of cars were used for each mixer so that
one could be loading while the other was charging. The mixers discharged into 1 cu. yd. buckets
set two on a car and eight cars were hauled to the work in train by an 18-ton "dinky." At the
work the buckets were picked up by the traveling cranes and the concrete dumped into the forms.
Figure 90 shows the construction of the steel forms. Six sets of forms were used. Each set
consisted of five frames spaced 10 ft. apart and braced together in the planes parallel to
the dam, and each set molded 40 ft. of dam. The lagging consisted of wooden boxes 8½ ft. wide
and 10 ft. long. For the vertical face of the dam these boxes were attached by bolts to the
vertical post, for the curved face they were bolted to a channel bent to the curve and held
by struts from the inclined post of the steel frame.

In construction the footing and the body of the dam to an elevation of 5 ft. above the beginning
of the curve were built continuously across the river; above this elevation the dam was built
in alternate 40-ft. sections. The strut back to the service bridge shown in the lower right
hand corner of Fig. 90, shows the manner of bracing the first 30-ft. section of the inclined
post to hold the lagging for the continuous portion. The lagging was added a piece at a time
as concreting progressed. The ends of each set of frames for a 40-ft. section were for the
isolated sections closed by timber bulkheads carrying box forms to mold grooves into which
the concrete of the intermediate sections would bond.

The concrete used was a 1-3-5 mixture, the stone ranging in size from 2 to 5 ins. Rubble stone
from one man size to ½ ton were bedded in the concrete. The capacity of the concrete plant
was 2,000 cu. yds. per day or about 250 cu. yds. per mixer per 10-hour day.

~DAM, CHAUDIERE FALLS, QUEBEC.~--The dam was 800 ft. long and from 16 to 20 ft. high, constructed
of 1-2-4 concrete with rubble stone embedded. The rubble stones were separated at least 9 ins.
horizontally and 12 ins. vertically and were kept 20 ins. from faces. At one point the rubble
amounted to 40 per cent. of the volume, but the average for the dam was 25 to 30 per cent.
The stone was broken at the work, some by hand, but most by machine, all to pass a 2-in. ring.
Hand-broken stone ran very uniform in size and high in voids, often up to 50 per cent. Stone
broken by crusher with jaws 2 ins. apart would run 20 to 30 per cent. over 2 ins. in size and
give about 45 per cent. voids; with crusher jaws 1½ ins. apart from 98 to 100 per cent. was
under 2 ins. in size and contained about 42 per cent. of voids. It was found that if the crushers
were kept full all the time the product was much smaller, particularly with Gates gyratory
crusher, though a little more than rated power was required when the crusher was thus kept
full. This practice secured increased economy in both quantity and quality of product. The
concrete was made and placed by means of a movable traveler shown by Fig. 92. Concrete materials
were supplied to the charging platform of the traveler by means of a traveling derrick moving
on a parallel track. In placing the concrete on the rock bottom it was found necessary in order
to secure good bond to scrub the rock with water and brooms and cover it with a bed of 2 ins.
of 1-2 mortar. The method of concreting in freezing weather is described in Chapter VII.

The construction of piers and abutments for bridges is best explained by describing individual
examples of such work. So far, in America, bridge piers have been nearly always of plain concrete
and of form and section differing little from masonry piers; where reinforcement has been used
at all it has consisted of a surface network of bars introduced chiefly to ensure monolithic
action of the pier under lateral stresses. In Europe cellular piers of reinforced concrete
have been much used. Plain concrete abutments differ little in form and volume from masonry
abutments. Reinforced concrete abutments are usually of L-section with counterforts bracing
the upright slab and bridge seat to the base slab.

Form work for reinforced abutments is somewhat complex; that for plain abutments and piers
is of simple character, the only variations from plain stud and sheathing construction being
in the forms for moldings and coping and for cut-waters. For piers of moderate height the form
is commonly framed complete for the whole pier, but for high piers it is built up as the work
progresses by removing the bottom boards and placing them at the top. Opposite forms are held
together by wire ties through the concrete. Movable panel forms have been successfully employed,
but they rarely cheapen the cost much. Sectional forms, which can be shifted from pier to pier
where a number of piers of identical size are to be built, may frequently be used to advantage.
An example of such use is given in this chapter.

Derricks are the recognized appliances for hoisting and placing the concrete in pier work;
they are the only practicable appliance where the pier is high and particularly where it stands
in water and mixing barges are employed. For abutment work and land piers of moderate height
derricks and wheelbarrow or cart inclines are both available and where much shifting of the
derricks is involved the apparently more crude method compares favorably in cost.

The methods of placing concrete under water for pier foundations are described in Chapter V,
and the use of rubble concrete for pier construction is illustrated by several examples in
Chapter VI. The following examples of pier and abutment construction cover both large and small
work and give a clear idea of current practice.

~COST OF CONSTRUCTING RECTANGULAR PIER FOR A RAILWAY BRIDGE.~--This pier, Fig. 93, was built
in water averaging 5 ft. deep. The cofferdam consisted of triple-lap sheet piling, of the Wakefield
pattern, the planks being 2 ins. thick, and spiked together so as to give a cofferdam wall
6 ins thick. The cofferdam enclosed an area 14×20 ft., giving a clearance of 1 ft. all around
the base of the concrete pier, and a clearance of 2 ft. between the cofferdam and the outer
edge of the nearest pile. The cofferdam sheet piles were 18 ft. long, driven 11 ft. deep into
sand, and projecting 2 ft. above the surface of the water.

The concrete base resting on the foundation piles was 12×18 ft. The concrete pier resting on
this base was 7×13 ft. at the bottom, and 5×11 ft. at the top. The pier supported deck plate
girders. There were 100 cu. yds. of concrete in the pier and base.

The cost of this pier, which is typical of a large class of concrete pier work, has been obtained
in such detail that we analyze it in detail, giving the costs of cofferdam construction and
excavation as well as of mixing and placing the concrete.

Regarding the item of plant rental, it should be said that the plant consisted of a pile driver,
a derrick, a hoisting engine, and sundry timbers for platforms. There was no concrete mixer.
Hence an allowance $5 per day for use of plant is sufficient.

It will be noted that no salvage has been allowed on the lumber for forms. As a matter of fact,
all this lumber was recovered, and was used again in similar work.

Referring to the cost of cofferdam work, we see that, in order to excavate the 58 cu. yds.
inside the cofferdam, it was necessary to spend $284, or nearly $5 per cu. yd. before the actual
excavation was begun. The work of excavating cost only 57 cts. per cu. yd., but this does not
include the cost of erecting the derrick which was used in raising the loaded buckets of earth,
as well as in subsequently placing the concrete. The sheet piles were not pulled, in this instance,
but a contractor who understands the art of pile pulling would certainly not leave the piles
in the ground. A hand pump served to keep the cofferdam dry enough for excavating; but in more
open material a power pump is usually required.

The above costs are the actual costs, and do not include the contractor's profits. His bid
on the work was as follows:

Piles delivered               12 cts. per ft. Piles driven                         $5 each
Cofferdam                          $37 per M. Wet excavation              $1.00 per cu. yd.
Concrete                    $8.00 per cu. yd.

In order to ascertain whether or not these prices yielded a fair profit, it is necessary to
distribute the cost of the plant transportation and rental over the various items. We have
allowed $120 for plant transportation and rental, and $70 for setting up and taking down the
plant, or $190 in all. The working time of the plant was as follows:

                                   Per cent.    Prorated
                         Days.     of time.     plant cost.
Cofferdam                 7           39           $74
Excavation                2           11            21
Foundation piles          4           22            42
Concrete                  5           28            53
                         --          ---          ----
Totals                   18          100          $190

As above given, the labor on the 7,900 ft. B. M. in the cofferdam cost $126, or $16 per M.;
but this additional $74 of prorated plant costs, adds another $9 per M., bringing the total
labor and plant to $25 per M., to which must be added the $20 per M. paid for the timber in
the cofferdam, making a grand total of $45 per M. This shows that the contractor's bid of $37
per M. was much too low.

The labor on the excavation cost 57 cts. per cu. yd., to which must be added the prorated plant
cost of $21 distributed over the 58 cu. yds., or 36 cts. per cu. yd., making a total of 93
cts. per cu. yd. This shows that the bid of $1 per cu. yd. was hardly high enough.

The labor on the 24 foundation piles cost $80, or $3.33 each. The prorated plant cost is $42,
or $1.75 per pile, which, added to $3.33, makes a total of $5.08. This shows that the bid of
$5 Per pile for driving was too low. However there was a profit of 2 cts. per ft., or 80 cts.
per pile, on the cost of piles delivered.

The concrete amounted to 100 cu. yds. Hence the prorated plant cost of $53 is equivalent to
53 cts. per cu. yd. Hence the total cost of the concrete was:

                                 Per cu. yd.
Cement, sand and stone             $3.20
Foreman (at $5)                     0.25
Labor (at $2)                       1.00
Engineman (at $3)                   0.15
Coal (at $3)                        0.06
Carpenters (at $3)                  0.24
Forms (at $23.50, used once)        0.80
Wire, nails, etc                    0.02
Prorated plant cost                 0.53
                                   -----
Total                              $6.25

Since the contract price for concrete was $8 per cu. yd., there was a good profit in this item.

~BACKING FOR BRIDGE PIERS AND ABUTMENTS.~--Six piers and two abutments of the City Island bridge
were constructed in 1906 at New York city, of masonry backed with 1-2-4 concrete below and
1-3-5 concrete above high water. The piers and abutments were all sunk to rock or hard material
by means of timber cofferdams. Table XVI gives the labor cost of mixing and placing the concrete
backing for one abutment and three piers, after the materials were delivered on the scows.
The concrete was mixed by a rectangular horizontal machine mixer and deposited by 2-cu. yd.
bottom dump buckets handled by derrick scows and stiff leg derricks. The high cost of concreting
on Pier 2 was due to the fact that the concrete was improperly deposited and had to be removed
and the higher cost in Abutment 1 was probably due to the fact that the abutment was so long
and narrow that it was difficult to handle the bucket.

~PNEUMATIC CAISSONS, WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE.~--Mr. Francis L. Pruyn, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.,
gives the following costs of concreting the pneumatic caissons for the Brooklyn tower of the
Williamsburg bridge at New York city. The work comprised the mixing and placing of some 13,637
cu. yds. of concrete in two caissons. Table XVII shows the itemized costs for one caisson and
Table XVIII shows them for the other caisson. The methods of work were as follows:

After each caisson was built it was towed to its proper site, where it was held in place by
temporary pile dock built completely around it. On these docks the concrete was placed; a 2
cu. yd. cubical mixer of the usual pattern being used for mixing. The concrete materials, consisting
of sand, stone and cement was handled direct from barges alongside, into the mixer. The concrete
was placed by a derrick located in the center of the caisson, which was a bad feature as the
caisson was usually out of level and considerable difficulty was experienced in swinging the
derrick. On the South caisson ¾ cu. yd. bottom dump buckets were used in placing the concrete,
on the North caisson the size of these was increased to 1½ cu. yd. which reduced the cost of
placing 15 cts. per cu. yd. There were placed in the South caisson 3,827 cu. yds. in 32 days
of actual working time--120 cu. yds. per day of 10 hrs. The gross time was 2 months. On the
North caisson 5,693 cu. yds. were placed in 46 days worked--124 cu. yds. per day. The gross
time was 4 months.

The rates of labor were as follows per 10-hour day:

Foreman                   $5.00 Assistant foreman          2.50 Hoisters                  
2.50 Fireman                    1.60 Laborer                    1.50

Proportions concrete were 1: 2.5: 6.

The low price of sand in the North caisson was brought about by the finding of good building
sand in the excavation for the anchorage, which work was done by the same contractor.
