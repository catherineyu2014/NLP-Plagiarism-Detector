TO INA D. COOLBRITH

    WITH WILDER SIGHING IN THE PINE
      THE WIND WENT BY, AND SO I DREAMED;
      AND IN THAT DUSK OF SLEEP IT SEEMED
    A CITY BY THE SEA WAS MINE.

    TO STATELIER SPRANG THE WALLS OF TYRE
      FROM SEAWARD CLIFF OR STABLE HILL;
      AND LIGHT AND MUSIC MET TO FILL
    THE SPLENDID COURTS OF HER DESIRE--

    (EXTOLLING CHORDS THAT CRIED HER PRAISE,
      AND GOLDEN REEDS WHOSE MELLOW MOAN
      WAS LIKE AN OCEAN'S UNDERTONE
    DYING AND LOST ON FOREST WAYS).

    BUT SWEETER FAR THAN ANY SOUND
      THAT RANG OR RIPPLED IN HER HALLS,
      WAS ONE BEYOND HER EASTERN WALLS,
    BY SUMMER GARDENS GIRDLED ROUND.

    TWAS FROM A NIGHTINGALE, AND OH!
      THE SONG IT SANG HATH NEVER WORD!
      SWEETER IT SEEMED THAN LOVE'S, FIRST-HEARD,
    OR LUTES IN AIDENN MURMURING LOW.

    FAINT, AS WHEN DROWSY WINDS AWAKE
      A SISTERHOOD OF FAERY BELLS,
      IT WON REPLY FROM HIDDEN DELLS,
    LOYAL TO ECHO FOR ITS SAKE....

    I DREAMT I SLEPT, BUT CANNOT SAY
      HOW MANY DREAMLAND SEASONS FLED,
      NOR WHAT HORIZON OF THE DEAD
    GAVE BACK MY DREAM'S UNCERTAIN DAY.

    BUT STILL BESIDE THE TOILING SEA
      I LAY, AND SAW--FOR WALLS O'ERGROWN--
      THE CITY THAT WAS MINE HAD KNOWN
    TIME'S SURE AND ANCIENT TREACHERY.

    ABOVE HER RAMPARTS, BROAD AS TYRE'S,
      THE GRASSES' MOUNTING ARMY BROKE;
      THE SHADOW OF THE SPRAWLING OAK
    USURPT THE SPLENDOR OF HER FIRES.

    BUT O'ER THE FALLEN MARBLES PALE
      I HEARD, LIKE ELFIN MELODIES
      BLOWN OVER FROM ENCHANTED SEAS,
    THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHTINGALE.

               GEORGE STERLING.

WHEREFORE?

Wherefore this book of fiction by Californian writers? And why its appeal otherwise than that
of obvious esthetic and literary qualities? They who read what follows will know.

The fund, which the sale of this book is purposed to aid, was planned by The Spinners soon
after the eighteenth of April, 1906, and was started with two hundred dollars from their treasury.
To this, Mrs. Gertrude Atherton added another two hundred dollars. Several women's clubs and
private individuals also generously responded, so that now there is a thousand dollars to the
credit of the fund. A bond has been bought and the interest from it will be paid to Ina D.
Coolbrith, the poet, and first chosen beneficiary of the fund. The Spinners feel assured that
this book will meet with such a ready sale as to make possible the purchase of several bonds,
and so render the accruing interest a steady source of aid to Miss. Coolbrith.

All who have read and fallen under the charm of her "Songs from the Golden Gate," or felt the
beauty and tenderness of the verses "When the Grass Shall Cover Me," will, without question,
unite in making "assurance doubly sure" to such end.

From the days of the old Overland Monthly, when she worked side by side with Bret Harte and
Charles Warren Stoddard, to the present moment, Miss. Coolbrith's name has formed a part of
the literary history of San Francisco.

The eighteenth of April, 1906, and the night which followed it, left her bereft of all literary,
and other, treasures; but her poem bearing the refrain, "Lost city of my love and my desire,"
rings with the old genius, and expresses the feeling of many made desolate by the destruction
of the city which held their most cherished memories.

When Miss. Coolbrith shall no longer need to be a beneficiary of the fund, it is intended that
it shall serve to aid some other writer, artist or musician whose fortunes are at the ebb.

To the writers, artists and publishers who have so heartily and generously made this book possible,
The Spinners return unmeasured thanks.

San Francisco, June 22, 1907.
