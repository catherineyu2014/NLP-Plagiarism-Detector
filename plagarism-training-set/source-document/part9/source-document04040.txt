 Slade's matchless
specimens of Glass, and Dr. Rock's Superaltare.

Mr. Charles Knight has just put forth a small pamphlet, entitled Case of the Authors as regards
the Paper Duty, in which he shows most ably and most clearly the social advantages which must
result from the repeal of a tax which, as Mr. Knight proves, "encourages the production of
inferior and injurious works by unskilled labourers in literature."

The Gentleman's Magazine of the present month is a capital number. Mr. Cunningham has commenced
in it, what promises to be an interesting series of papers upon a subject which that gentleman's
well-known tact and judgment ill prevent from being objectionable, The Story of Nell Gwyn;
and the numerous friends of the late Mr. Amyot--and how numerous were his friends!--cannot
but be pleased with the characteristic portrait which accompanies the interesting memoir of
that kind-hearted and accomplished gentleman.

Oracles from the British Poets, A Drawing-Room Table Book and pleasant Companion for a Round
Party, by James Smith exhibits a good idea carried out with excellent taste, and justifies
the author's motto:

  "Out of them scatter'd Sibyl's leaves,
  Strange prophecies my fancy weaves."

A game which, while it amuses the family circle, will make its members acquainted with so many
beautiful passages from our poets as are here assembled, must find a welcome in many a home
at the present season. The publisher of the Oracles has availed himself of the demand, at this
period of the year, for "Song of knight and lady bright," to re-issue in one volume instead
of two, and at a reduced price, his Pictorial Book of Ballads Traditional and Romantic.

A Monumentarium of Exeter Cathedral, carefully compiled by the Rev. J.W. Hewett, the result
of six months regular labour, has been printed in the Transactions of the Exeter Architectural
Society. By this work Mr. Hewett has done good service to all genealogists, local and general
historians, &c., and we know no greater benefit that could be conferred on this branch of literature,
than that some of our now super-abundant brass-rubbers should follow Mr. Hewett's example,
and note with accuracy all the inscriptions, monuments, coats of arms, &c., preserved in the
churches in their respective neighbourhoods. They may then either hand them over for publication
to the nearest Archæological Society, or the Archæological Institute, or the Society of Antiquaries;
or transmit a copy of them to the MS. department of the British Museum.

Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson, of Wellington Street, will sell, on Monday next and two following
days, the valuable Collection of Ancient and Modern Engravings of the late James Brown, Esq.

"This work is a condensation of all that is known respecting the coins of ancient nations,
and a lucid and well-arranged narrative of monetary history. A novel and excellent mode of
illustration has been adopted, representing the coins in exact fac-simile in gold, silver,
and copper, produced by casts from the originals, many of which would be quite unattainable,
and all costly."--Art Journal.

"It is needless to remark how desirable an addition such a work as this must be to the library
of the historian, the classical scholar, and the clergyman, no less than to the artist."--Daily
News.
