  The type-specimen figured by Lambert does not show the longest cone
  and leaf of this species. They are better represented by specimens
  which have been named P. filifolia. Such dimensions prevail in
  subtropical localities. At temperate altitudes these dimensions are
  much reduced, but here are found a longer form of cone and leaf (var.
  Lindleyi, Loudon) and a shorter form (var. rudis, Shaw). At still
  higher altitudes and up to the timber-limit the var. Hartwegii,
  Engelmann, with short leaves and a small nearly black cone is found.
  Among these varieties there is no such sharp distinction as these
  definitions imply. All dimensions of fruit and foliage and the various
  brown and black shades of the cone blend into each other through
  endless intergradations. A monograph of this species, by one who could
  devote some years to it on the superb volcanoes and in the delightful
  climates where this tree abounds, would be a valuable contribution to
  science.

Spring-shoots uninodal, sometimes pruinose. Bark-formation early. Leaves prevalently in fascicles
of 3, but varying from 2 to 5 or more, from 12 to 36 cm. long; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm
uniform or multiform, outer walls of the endoderm thick. Conelet mucronate, the mucro often
reflexed. Cones from 8 to 20 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical, deciduous and usually leaving
a few basal scales on the tree; apophyses tawny yellow to fuscous brown, lustrous, elevated
along a transverse keel, sometimes protuberant and reflexed, the umbo salient and forming the
base of a pungent, persistent prickle.

  This species ranges from southern British Columbia over the mountains
  between the Pacific and the eastern foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains,
  including the Black Hills of South Dakota, to the northeastern Sierras
  of Mexico, to northern Jalisco and Lower California, forming, in many
  localities, large forests and furnishing the best Hard Pine timber of
  the western United States. It attains its best growth on the Sierras
  of California and is, next to P. Lambertiana, the tallest of the
  Pines.

  Like P. Montezumae, and under like influences, it shows much
  dimensional variation, and the leaf-fascicles are heteromerous, with
  the larger number in the southern part of its range. Many authors
  consider the variety Jeffreyi Vasey to be a distinct species; but
  here, it seems to me, too much importance is attached to the pruinose
  branchlet, clearly a provision against transpiration and associated
  rather with a dry environment than with a species. Most observers
  discover many intermediate forms between this variety and the species.
  The var. scopulorum Engelm. is the Rocky Mountain form with leaves in
  2's and 3's and with small cones passing into P. arizonica, Engelm., a
  more southern form with small cones and leaves in fascicles of 3 to 5.
  The var. macrophylla (Shaw, Pines Mex. 24), in addition to its long
  and stout leaves, bears a cone with protuberant apophyses, somewhat
  comparable to the intermediate forms of P. pseudostrobus var.
  apulcensis Shaw (l. c.). Fascicles of 6 and 7 leaves are sometimes
  found, and specimens that I have collected in Sandia, Durango (issued
  by Pringle, through a misunderstanding, under the name P. Roseana,
  ined.) show such fascicles on the fertile branches.

40. PINUS TEOCOTE

    1830 P. teocote Schlechtendal & Chamisso in Linnaea, v. 76.

Spring-shoots uninodal, or sometimes multinodal. Leaves prevalently in fascicles of 3, but
varying from 3 to 5, from 10 to 20 cm. long; resin-ducts medial, sometimes with an internal
duct, hypoderm biform, endoderm with thick outer walls. Conelets mucronate. Cones usually very
small, from 4 to 6 cm. long, but with a larger varietal form, ovate to long-conic, symmetrical;
apophyses nut-brown, flat or tumid, the mucro usually deciduous.

  This species grows at temperate altitudes from Chiapas to Nuevo Leon,
  associated with temperate Mexican species such as P. patula, P.
  leiophylla and others, and is easily recognized by its small cone. The
  variety with a larger cone (var. macrocarpa, Shaw, Pines Mex. t. 10) I
  have found growing in mixed groves of P. teocote and P. leiophylla. It
  resembles the latter in cone and leaf, but lacks the peculiar
  character that distinguishes P. leiophylla from all other Mexican
  species--the triennial cone. Some of the specimens of Hartweg No. 441
  belong here, as well as Pringle's specimens, Nos. 10013, 10018,
  distributed as P. eslavae, ined.

    1905 P. Altamirani Shaw in Sargent, Trees & Shrubs, i. 209, t. 99.

Spring-shoots conspicuously pruinose, uninodal or not infrequently multinodal. Leaves in fascicles
of 3, 4 or 5, not exceeding 24 cm. in length; resin-ducts internal, often with one or two medial
ducts, hypoderm biform, endoderm usually with thin outer walls. Conelets mucronate. Cones from
5 to 7 cm. long on pliant peduncles, ovate or ovate-conic, oblique or sometimes symmetrical,
deciduous, or persistent with a weak hold on the branch; apophyses nut-brown, flat or tumid,
often protuberant on the posterior face of the cone, the umbo usually large and salient, forming
a rounded button-like projection, on which the mucro is wanting.

  A subtropical species of central and western Mexico, growing alone or
  associated with P. oocarpa, P. Pringlei and the subtropical forms of
  P. Montezumae and P. pseudostrobus. It is recognized among its
  associate species by its conspicuously glaucous foliage. The cone is
  very variable on trees of the same grove, both in size and in the
  protuberance of its apophyses. Gordon's specimen in the Kew herbarium
  consists of a single detached cone and a few leaves. The leaves differ
  from all that I have examined in showing thick-walled endoderm cells,
  but the cone corresponds with many of my own collection.

    1880 P. Wrightii Engelmann in Trans. Acad. Sci. St. Louis, iv. 185.

Spring-shoots uninodal, pruinose. Leaves in fascicles of 2 to 5, from 15 to 22 cm. long; resin-ducts
internal, hypoderm biform, endoderm with thin outer walls. Conelets erect, aristate. Cones
from 5 to 8 cm. long, reflexed, ovate, symmetrical, deciduous; apophyses nut-brown, lustrous,
flat or tumid, the umbo often thin and, together with the slender prickle, bent sharply downward.

  This species is confined to San Domingo, Hayti and eastern Cuba. Its
  erect conelet and reflexed cone distinguish it from P. caribaea, which
  has both its conelet and cone reflexed. Moreover the conelet is
  usually, perhaps always, subterminal in P. occidentalis.

43. PINUS PALUSTRIS

    1768 P. palustris Miller, Gard. Dict. ed. 8.
    1810 P. australis Michaux f. Hist. Arbr. Am. i. 64, t. 6.

Spring-shoots uninodal, rarely multinodal. Buds peculiarly large, white, and conspicuously
fringed with the long free cilia of the bud-scales. Cones from 15 to 20 cm. long, narrow, tapering
from a rounded base to a blunt point, symmetrical, deciduous and usually leaving a few scales
on the tree; apophyses dull nut-brown, elevated along a transverse keel, the umbo salient and
forming the broad base of a small persistent prickle.

  Its thin sap-wood, its very strong heavy wood of large dimensions with
  abundant resin of excellent quality make this the most valuable
  species of the genus. It ranges over the sandy plain that borders the
  Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, from southeastern Virginia to eastern
  Texas. The northern limit is approximately the centre of the Southern
  and Gulf States, with a northern extension in Alabama to the base of
  the Appalachian Mountains and to northwestern Louisiana. Its southern
  limit lies near the centre of the Florida peninsula.

  Among its associates this species is recognized by its large white
  fringed bud and its elongated cone. Its leaves attain, on vigorous
  trees, the maximum length among Pines, but on most trees the leaves do
  not differ in length from the longer forms of those of P. caribaea or
  P. taeda. A peculiarity, which it shares with P. caribaea, is the
  deciduous scaly bark of mature trees, constantly falling away in thin
  irregular scales.

    1893 P. heterophylla Sudworth in Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, xx. 45.
    1903 P. recurvata Rowley in Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, xxx. 107.

Spring-shoots multinodal, more or less pruinose. Buds pale chestnut-brown. Cones from 5 to
15 cm. long, ovate or oblong-ovate, symmetrical, deciduous and leaving often a few basal scales
on the branch; apophyses lustrous, rufous-brown, tumid, the umbo somewhat salient and minutely
mucronate.

  The northern limit of the range of P. caribaea extends from the coast
  of southeastern S. Carolina through southeastern Georgia and southern
  Alabama to southeastern Louisiana. It is associated with P. palustris,
  taeda, serotina, echinata and glabra in this part of its range. It
  continues through Florida, where it encounters P. clausa. On the
  Bahamas it is the only Pine. On the Isle of Pines it finds in P.
  tropicalis another associate. It also grows in Honduras and Guatemala.
  The wood and resin of this species are of such excellent quality that
  no commercial distinction is made between P. caribaea and P.
  palustris.

    1788 P. lutea Walter Fl. Carol. 237.
    1903 P. heterophylla Small, Fl. Southeast. U. S. 28 (not Sudworth).

Spring-shoots multinodal. Cones from 6 to 10 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical; apophyses
dull pale nut-brown, rarely lustrous, elevated along a transverse keel, the whole umbo forming
a stout triangular spine with slightly concave sides.

  The species ranges from southern New Jersey to southern Arkansas,
  Oklahoma, eastern Texas and southwestern Tennessee, but does not occur
  in the lower half of the Florida peninsula. It is an important
  timber-tree, manufactured into all descriptions of scantlings,
  boarding and finish, but the wood is of various qualities. It may be
  recognized by the spine of its cone in both years of growth. Excepting
  the formidable armature of the cone of P. pungens, the spines are the
  strongest and most persistent of all the species of eastern North
  America.

46. PINUS GLABRA

    1788 P. glabra Walter, Fl. Carol. 237.

Spring-shoots multinodal. Bark-formation late, the upper trunks of mature trees smooth. Leaves
in fascicles of 2, from 9 to 12 cm. long; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm weak, sometimes of a
single row, biform when of two rows, endoderm with thin outer walls. Conelets reflexed, mucronate.
Cones from 4 to 7 cm. long, reflexed, ovate, symmetrical, deciduous on some trees, persistent
on others; apophyses pale dull nut-brown, thin or slightly thickened, the prickle usually deciduous.

  A tree that sometimes attains important dimensions, growing singly or
  in small groves from the neighborhood of Charleston, S. C., to eastern
  Louisiana and central Mississippi, most abundant in a strip of
  territory on either side of the northern boundary of Florida. Among
  the Pines of the southeastern United States it is the only species
  with late bark-formation, and is therefore easily identified.

    1803 P. variabilis Lambert, Gen. Pin. i. 22, t. 15.
    1854 P. Royleana Jamieson in Jour. Hort. Soc. Lond. ix. 52, f.

Spring-shoots multinodal, somewhat pruinose. Bark forming early, rough on the upper trunk.
Conelets mucronate. Cones from 4 to 6 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical, often persistent;
apophyses dull pale nut-brown, thin or somewhat thickened along a transverse keel, the umbo
salient, the mucro more or less persistent.

  This species ranges from southeastern New York to northern Florida, to
  West Virginia and eastern Tennessee, and through the Gulf States to
  eastern Louisiana, eastern Texas, southern Missouri and southwestern
  Illinois. It is extensively manufactured into material of all kinds
  that enters into the construction of buildings. It differs from P.
  virginiana in its longer leaves, brittle branches, and much greater
  height, from P. glabra in its rough upper trunk, and from both by the
  frequent presence of trimerous leaf-fascicles.

  Of the six or seven pines of the southeastern United States, this
  species covers a larger area and ascends the slopes of the Alleghany
  Mountains far enough to meet the northern species, P. virginiana, P.
  rigida, and P. strobus. Unlike the western members of this group, P.
  echinata and its associates are not variable. Their characters are
  singularly constant, as their limited synonymy and total lack of
  varietal names attest.

48. PINUS PRINGLEI

    1905 P. Pringlei Shaw in Sargent, Trees & Shrubs, i. 211, t. 100.

Spring-shoots uninodal, sometimes pruinose. Leaves ternate, from 15 to 25 cm. long; resin-ducts
internal or with an occasional septal duct, hypoderm biform, in thick masses, often projecting
far into the green tissue and sometimes touching the endoderm. Conelets mucronate. Cones from
5 to 10 cm. long, reflexed on a rigid peduncle, subsymmetrical or more or less oblique, tenaciously
persistent, often serotinous; apophyses sublustrous tawny yellow or fulvous brown, convex,
the posterior scales often more prominently developed, the mucro usually wanting; seed with
a perceptibly thickened wing-blade.

  A tree with long erect bright green foliage, confined, so far as
  known, to the subtropical altitudes of western Mexico. As it grows in
  Uruapan, Michoacan, there are two forms of the cone, large and small,
  both with the same long rigid leaf.

Spring-shoots uninodal, pruinose. Leaves in fascicles of 3, 4 or 5, from 15 to 30 cm. long,
erect; resin-ducts mostly septal, sometimes internal, hypoderm biform or multiform. Conelets
on very long peduncles, mucronate. Cones from 4 to 10 cm. long, long-pedunculate, broad-ovate
to ovate-conic, symmetrical or sometimes oblique, persistent, more or less serotinous; apophysis
gray-yellow or greenish yellow of high lustre, flat or variously convex, delicately and radially
carinate, the umbo often salient, the prickle usually broken away; seed-wing appreciably thickened
at the base of the blade.

  A subtropical species, ranging from Guatemala to the northern border
  of Sinaloa in northern Mexico; remarkable for the length of the
  peduncle of the cone and for the prevalence of septal resin-ducts in
  the leaf.

Spring-shoots often multinodal. Bark-formation late, the branches ashen gray and smooth for
several years. Leaves binate, from 6 to 15 cm. long; resin-ducts external, hypoderm uniform.
Conelets obscurely mucronate near the apex. Cones from 8 to 12 cm. long, ovate-conic, symmetrical
or subsymmetrical, persistent, often serotinous; apophyses red with a lighter or deeper brownish
shade, lustrous, flat, convex or low-pyramidal, radially carinate, the umbo often ashen gray
and unarmed.

  A tree ranging from Portugal to Afghanistan, and from Algeria to
  Dalmatia and to northern Italy and Southern France. It is a vigorous
  species in its own home, growing readily in poor soils, but not
  successful in colder climates. The wood is resinous and valuable for
  fuel. The turpentine industry, once associated with this species, has
  gradually been abandoned for the more copious product of P. pinaster.

  It is recognized by its lustrous red cones and by the ashen gray
  cortex of its branches and upper trunk. Tenore's P. brutia (pyrenaica
  of some authors) is founded on a difference in the length of the leaf
  and on an erect cone with a shorter peduncle. To recognize species on
  such distinctions would not be consistent with the purpose and spirit
  of this discussion.

    1789 P. pinaster Aiton, Hort. Kew. iii. 367.
    1798 P. laricio Savi, Fl. Pisa. ii. 353 (not Poiret).

Spring-shoots sometimes multinodal. Bark-formation early. Leaves binate, from 10 to 20 cm.
long, stout and rigid; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm multiform, the inner cells gradually larger,
remarkably large in the angles of the leaf. Conelets minutely mucronate. Cones from 9 to 18
cm. long, nearly sessile, ovate-conic, symmetrical or subsymmetrical, persistent, sometimes
serotinous; apophyses lustrous nut-brown or rufous brown, conspicuously pyramidal, the umbo
salient and pungent.

  A maritime tree corresponding nearly, in its range, with the preceding
  species, but more hardy in cooler climates. It grows from Portugal to
  Greece, and from Algeria to Dalmatia, but its area has been much
  extended by cultivation. Under favorable conditions it attains large
  dimensions, but its exploitation for resin and turpentine tends to
  diminish its size and disfigure its habit (Mathieu, Fl. Forest, ed. 4,
  611). Its rapid growth, strong root-system, and its ability to thrive
  on poor sandy soil, have led to the employment of this species for the
  forestation of sand-dunes in France.

  The tree can be recognized by its long stout leaves and persistent
  brown cones. Its leaf-section is peculiar in the remarkable size of
  the inner cells of the hypoderm, especially in the angles of the leaf.

52. PINUS VIRGINIANA

    1768 P. virginiana Miller, Gard. Dict. ed. 8.
    1789 P. inops Aiton, Hort. Kew. iii. 367.

Spring-shoots multinodal, pruinose; branchlets pliant and tough. Bark-formation slow, the cortex
not rifted for some years. Conelets with long tapering sharp scales.

  Western Long Island to central Georgia and north Alabama, and from
  eastern Tennessee to southern Indiana and southeastern Ohio. It is a
  low bushy tree in the north, but in the south and west it attains
  small timber-size and is locally exploited. It is hardy beyond the
  limits of its natural range, growing readily in the vicinity of
  Boston. Its short binate leaves, the persistent long prickles of its
  cone, and its tough branches, combine to distinguish this Pine from
  its associates. The obvious relationship of P. virginiana and P.
  clausa places the former in this, rather than in the preceding group.

53. PINUS CLAUSA

    1884 P. clausa Vasey ex Sargent, Rep. 10th Cens. U. S. ix. 199.

Spring-shoots multinodal. Bark-formation slow, as in the preceding species. Conelets with long
tapering acute scales.

  A species of limited range, confined to the sandy coast of Alabama and
  to Florida. It sometimes attains timber-size, but is usually a low
  spreading tree of no commercial importance and never seen in
  cultivation. It is recognized by its smooth branches, binate leaves
  and numerous, often multiserial, clusters of persistent, often closed,
  cones. It is associated with P. caribaea and, in the northern part of
  its range, it grows with the other Southern species. By its close
  resemblance it may be considered the serotinous form of P. virginiana.

54. PINUS RIGIDA

    1768 P. rigida Miller, Gard. Dict. ed. 8.
    1909 P. serotina Long, in Bartonia, ii. 17 (not Michaux).

Spring-shoots multinodal. Scales of the conelet abruptly prolonged into a spine.

  A tree with bright green foliage in spreading tufts. The northern
  limit of its range is in southwestern New Brunswick, southern Maine,
  central New Hampshire and Vermont, the Thousand Islands of the St.
  Lawrence River and central Ohio. It ranges into Pennsylvania and
  Delaware at low levels and thence over the Alleghanies into northern
  Georgia. It is associated with P. strobus and P. resinosa and, further
  south, with P. virginiana. The cones are rarely serotinous, but it is
  remarkably like P. serotina in many characters, and is therefore
  placed in this group.

55. PINUS SEROTINA

    1803 P. serotina Michaux, Fl. Bor. Am. ii. 205.

Spring-shoots multinodal. Leaves ternate, from 12 to 20 cm. long; resin-ducts medial or medial
and internal, hypoderm biform. Conelet long-mucronate. Cones from 5 to 7 cm. long, subglobose
or short-ovate, symmetrical, persistent, serotinous; apophyses lustrous tawny yellow, slightly
elevated along a transverse keel, the umbo forming the broad base of a slender, rather fragile
prickle.

  This species is confined to low wet lands from southeastern Virginia
  to northern Florida and central Alabama. It is one of the associated
  six timber-Pines of the Southern States and the only one of them with
  serotinous cones. Its wood is of like value with that of P. taeda, the
  two species being constantly confused by lumbermen. It is never
  associated with P. rigida, but its resemblance to that Pine is so
  great that it may be regarded as its serotinous form. Its leaf is
  longer, its cone usually more orbicular and the prickle weaker.

    1806 P. pungens Lambert in Ann. Bot. ii. 198.
    1852 P. montana Noll, Bot. Class Book, 340. (not Miller).

Spring-shoots multinodal. Cones from 5 to 9 cm. long, symmetrical or subsymmetrical, tenaciously
persistent, serotinous; apophyses lustrous or sublustrous fulvous brown, much elevated along
a transverse keel, the umbo forming a stout formidable spine, uniform or nearly uniform on
all faces of the cone.

  A mountain species ranging from central Pennsylvania to northern
  Georgia, with isolated stations in western New Jersey and Maryland. It
  is remarkable among the Pines of eastern North America for the size
  and strength of the spines of its cone. The armature resembles that of
  the cone of the western P. muricata, but with the difference that the
  western cone is strongly oblique, the anterior and posterior spines
  varying greatly in size.

    1811 P. divaricata Dumont de Courset, Bot. Cult. ed. 2, vi. 457.

Spring-shoots multinodal. Leaves binate, from 2 to 4 cm. long; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm
biform. Conelets minutely mucronate. Cones from 3 to 5 cm. long, erect, ovate-conic, oblique,
much curved or variously warped from the irregular development of the scales, serotinous; apophyses
lustrous tawny yellow, concave, flat or convex, the umbo small and unarmed.

  The most northern American Pine, growing near the Arctic Circle in the
  valley of the Mackenzie River, whence it ranges southeasterly to
  central Minnesota and the south shore of Lake Michigan, and easterly
  through the Dominion of Canada to northern Vermont, southern Maine,
  and Nova Scotia. In the northern part of its range it is the only
  Pine, but further south it is associated with P. strobus and P.
  resinosa. It is easily identified by its curious curved or deformed
  cones.

    1833 P. inops Bongard in Mém. Acad. Sci. St. Pétersb. ii. 163,
              (not Aiton).
    1838 P. contorta Douglas ex Loudon, Arb. Brit. iv. 2292, f. 2211.

    1869 P. tamrac Murray in Gard. Chron. 191, ff. 1-9.
    1898 P. tenuis Lemmon in Erythea, vi. 77.

Spring-shoots multinodal. Cones from 2 to 5 cm. long, sessile, ovate-conic, symmetrical or
very oblique, persistent, serotinous; apophyses lustrous tawny-yellow, flat or protuberant,
on oblique cones abruptly larger on the posterior face; the umbo armed with a slender fragile
prickle.

  It grows from the valley of the Yukon, near the Alaskan boundary,
  along the Pacific coast to Mendocino county, California. It covers the
  plains and slopes of British Columbia and follows the Rocky Mountains
  into western Colorado, with an outlying station on the Black Hills of
  South Dakota. It grows on the Sierras and mountains of southern
  California and in northern Lower California. On the seashore this Pine
  is of low dense growth, but inland it is a slender tree with a long
  tapering stem. It is easily recognized by its very short leaves and
  very small cone.

59. PINUS GREGGII

    1868 P. Greggii Engelmann ex Parlatore in DC. Prodr. xvi-2, 396.

Spring-shoots uninodal and multinodal, pruinose. Bark-formation late, the branches and upper
trunk smooth. Leaves ternate, from 7 to 10 cm. long, erect; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm of
uniform thin-walled cells. Conelets mucronate. Cones from 6 to 12 cm. long, ovate-conic, oblique,
serotinous, reflexed; apophyses lustrous tawny yellow, convex, the posterior gradually larger
and more prominent than the anterior scales, the umbo flat or depressed, the mucro deciduous.

  This species is known, at present, from specimens collected in the
  vicinity of the city of Saltillo, in northeastern Mexico. Were it not
  for the difference of bark it might be considered to be a northern
  variety of P. patula with shorter erect leaves. With both species the
  long peduncle of the conelet becomes overgrown by the basal scales of
  the ripe cone, which appears to be sessile. With both, the cones are
  in crowded nodal clusters, reflexed against the branch. They are so
  much alike that earlier descriptions of P. patula included the smooth
  gray bark of P. Greggii. The first correct description of the scaly
  red bark of P. patula appeared in the second edition of Veitch's
  Manual of Conifers.

60. PINUS PATULA

    1831 P. patula Schlechtendal & Chamisso in Linnaea, vi. 354.

Spring-shoots multinodal, more or less pruinose. Bark-formation early, the scales deciduous,
the upper trunk and branches red.

  Patula grows in the warm-temperate climates of Hidalgo, Puebla and
  Vera Cruz, in eastern and central Mexico. It can be at once recognized
  by its slender drooping foliage, its persistent cones, and its red
  upper trunk. It is cultivated in northern Italy and in the warmer
  parts of Great Britain.

    1837 P. muricata D. Don in Trans. Linn. Soc. xvii. 441.
    1848 P. Edgariana Hartweg in Jour. Hort. Soc. Lond. iii. 217.

Spring-shoots multinodal. Leaves binate, from 10 to 15 cm. long; resin-ducts medial, hypoderm
biform. Scales of the conelet prolonged into a triangular spine. Cones from 5 to 9 cm. long,
in verticillate clusters, sessile, reflexed, ovate-conic, oblique, serotinous; apophyses lustrous
nut-brown, abruptly much larger on the posterior face of the cone, each armed with a formidable
spine varying in size with the varying size of the apophysis.

  This species grows on the coast of California, in scattered stations
  between Mendocino and San Luis Obispo Counties, and on the northwest
  coast of Lower California and on Cedros Island. It is recognized by
  its oblique cones, conspicuously spinose, indefinitely persistent and
  very serotinous. The unequal development of its cone-scales
  distinguishes the cone from the more symmetrically developed cone of
  P. pungens. Fruiting trees of P. muricata may be seen in the Royal
  Gardens at Kew.

              f. (not D. Don).
    1892 P. attenuata Lemmon in Mining & Sci. Press, lxiv. 45.

Spring-shoots multinodal.

  A tree of slender habit and gray-green foliage, the trunk studded with
  persistent nodal cone-clusters; growing on dry mountain slopes, from
  southwestern Oregon over the foot-hills of the northern mountains of
  California and its coastal ranges as far as the southern slopes of the
  San Bernardino Mountains. It attains its best development in the
  northern part of its range, but is never a tree of importance. The
  serotinous habit is more pronounced in this than in any other species.
  It is distinct from P. radiata, its nearest relative, by the color of
  the cone, by its smooth upper trunk and by its much smaller size.

  The possibility of identifying P. californiana Loiseleur (Nouv. Duham.
  v. 293), through a cone said to have been sent to the Museum at Paris,
  may cause this name to be applied, by reason of its early date (1812),
  to some existing species. Don's radiata and tuberculata, although
  considered to be the same species, were nevertheless founded on
  different forms of the cone. Under a very narrow conception of
  specific limits tuberculata Don might therefore acquire specific rank.
  These considerations seem to make it advisable to abandon for this
  species the names californica Hartw. and tuberculata Gord. for the
  later name attenuata.
