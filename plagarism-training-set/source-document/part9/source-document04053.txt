WILMINGTON AND ITS INDUSTRIES.

Sleepy travelers on the great route to Washington, having passed Philadelphia and expecting
Baltimore, are attracted, if it is a way-train, by a phenomenon. The engine is observed to
slacken, and a little elderly man with a lantern, looking in the twilight like an Arabian Night's
phantom with one red eye in the middle of its body, places himself just in advance of the locomotive.
He trots nimbly along, defending himself from incessant death by the sureness of his legs,
and after a long race guides up to the station the clattering train, which is all the time
threatening to catch him by the heel. "Wilmington!" shouts the brakesman. Every train into
Wilmington is thus attended, as the palfrey of an Eastern pasha by the running footman. The
man's life is passed in a perpetual race with destruction, and having beaten innumerable locomotives,
he still survives, contentedly wagging his crimson eye, and hardly conscious that his existence
is a perpetual escape.

Something quaint, peremptory, old-world and feudal strikes the traveler as adhering in this
custom, by which Wilmington constantly pays for the general safety of her promenaders with
the offering of a citizen's life and limbs. This impression is right. The city is the best-defined
spot on the American map where the South begins and the North ends. Wilmington is, for its
own part, a perfect crystal of Yankee grit, run out and fixed in a country which in the highest
degree represents the soft, contented, lazy, incoherent Bourbon temper. We select it for our
subject because it is so complete a terminal image. There is no other instance in the country
of such sharp, close contrast. A man might step out to the city limit, and stand with one leg
in full Yankeeland, thrilling with enterprise and emulation, and the other planted, as it were,
in the "Patriarchal Times." Elsewhere along the effaced line of Mason and Dixon the sections
die away into each other: here they stand face to face, and stare.

Wilmington's legend belongs to the general story of the settlements along the Delaware. The
discoveries of its site overlapped each other, the Quakers discovering the Swedes, who had
discovered the Dutch, who had discovered the Indians. It was first called Willing's Town, from
a settler, and then Wilmington, from the earl of that name in England, to whom Thomson dedicated
his poem of Winter. But the spirit of enterprise--the spirit whose results we are now to chronicle--came
in only with William Shipley, for whose story we must refer the reader, strange as it may seem,
to the latest novel of the first living master of English fiction.

This introduces to our notice the most singular literary partnership that ever was or ever
will be. Dumas used to be helped out in his splendid fictions by Maquet, but Dumas and Maquet
were Frenchmen, and had plenty of sympathies in common. Charles Reade, however, in his romance
of The Wandering Heir, written to minister to the Tichborne excitement, takes for his helper
the most unlikely colleague in nature--a grave, tranquil, intensely respectable Friend, a writer
of colonial histories in a far pastoral retreat by the Delaware. Such workmen were never matched
before; yet the words of Benjamin Ferris, the Wilmington antiquarian, form a part, and a telling
part, of the exciting romance signed by Charles Reade. The words of Ferris, unexpectedly earning
renown in a work of imagination, trace the true tale of the Quaker prophetess, Elizabeth Shipley,
who brought her practical husband to Wilmington through the influence of a brilliant dream.
The words of Ferris, adopted and sold to the publishers by Reade, describe the terrestrial
Paradise now known as Wilmington in just those glowing and golden terms we should have needed
for the prologue to this article if we had not been so anticipated. Reade, so long as he keeps
up his partnership with Ferris, is safe, sane and true. It would have been well if he had kept
it up a little longer, for the moment he lets go Ferris's coat-cuff he falls into mistakes--calling
the Delaware hereabouts a "bay," and speaking of a prickly-pear hedge on a farm only sixty
miles from Philadelphia.

The Reade Ferris legend, precluding any necessity of a story from us, brings good Elizabeth
Shipley into Wilmington, which was then a garden and is now a mart, from her former home at
Ridley, which was then a forest-clearing and is now a garden, being in truth the site of Ridley
Park, the landscape-city which was described in this Magazine last September. The legend gives
all proper emphasis to the location, endowing it with beauty enough to tempt a celestial guide
from heaven for the meek Quakeress's benefit, and with practical advantages enough to tempt
the worldly-minded husband. To get a high idea of the natural attractions of Wilmington, therefore,
read The Wandering Heir, thus advertised gratuitously. Wilmington lies, says the author of
Peg Woffington, "between the finger and thumb of two rivers," and also upon the broad palm
of the Delaware. The two minor streams which embrace it are entirely different in character:
one is a picturesque torrent, named by the Dutch Brand-wijn (Brandywine), from the circumstance
of a ship loaded with brandy having foundered at its mouth; the other, serene and navigable,
is the Christine, named by the Swedes from Christina, their favorite princess. Hereabouts George
Fox, the first Quaker, built a fire in 1672 to dry his immortal leather breeches. "We came
to Christian River," he says, "where we swam over our horses." The stream in that day, before
the destruction of inland forests, had about six times its present volume, but it is still
good for vessels of considerable burden. The thriving settlers made it carry down the harvests
of the interior, and then made the Brandywine grind them. The focus of the rivers became a
rich milling centre, and was also a post for whaling-ships. The Otaheitan prince stepped from
the deck of the whaler to court with gifts of shells the demure Quaker maidens of Wilmington,
and Kanaka sailors were almost as familiar on its wharves as Indian chiefs. About the time
of the Revolution the town became a well-known station for the export of quercitron bark, and
all the while the clacking mills were busy along the uneasy rapids of the Brandywine.

Shall we take a glance at a historic mill? The best location for such a structure where water-power
just met tide-water, and shallops drawing eight feet could load up at the shore, was selected
in 1762 for mill-buildings which still stand, and which were for many years the most famous
in the country, regulating the price of grain for the United States. The business soon overflowed,
and necessitated the building, in 1770, of the structures represented in the engraving on page
371, the whole group, on the two sides of the stream, being under one ownership, and known
as "Lea's Brandywine Mills." Hither would come the long lines of Conestoga wagons, from distant
counties, such as Dauphin and Berks, with fat horses, and wagoners persuading them by means
of biblical oaths jabbered in Pennsylvania Dutch. From these mills Washington removed the runners
(or upper stones), lest they should be seized and used by the British, hauling them up into
Chester county. When independence was secured the State of Delaware hastened to pass laws putting
foreign trade on a more liberal footing than the neighbor commonwealths, thus securing for
her mills the enviable commerce with the West Indies. Much shipping was thus attracted to Wilmington,
and the trade with Cuba in corn-meal was particularly large. It was found, however, that the
flour of maize invariably rotted in a tropical voyage, and thereupon the commodity known as
kiln-dried corn was invented at the Brandywine Mills: two hundred bushels would be dried per
day on brick floors, and be thought a large amount, though the "pan-kiln" now in use dries
two thousand in the same time. The dried meal was delivered at Havana perfectly fresh, and
pay received, in those good old days of barter, in Jamaica rum, sugar and coffees. In the old
times flour was heaped in the barrels and patted down with wooden shovels: then, when full,
a cloth was laid over the top, and the fattest journeyman on the premises clambered up to a
seat on the heap, to "cheese it down" and imprint his callipyge upon it. Flour thus made and
branded was always safe to bring a high price, but never so high as in the short epoch of the
Continental currency, when the old entries of the Brandywine Mill books show (1780) wheat bought
at twenty-four pounds a bushel, a pair of the miller's leather small-clothes at eighty pounds,
and some three or four hundred barrels of his flour charged at a gross sum of twenty-one thousand
pounds.

The fine old mills are still in lively operation, manufacturing into meal about a million bushels
of wheat and Indian corn every year. The principal proprietor receives us in his domain, the
living image of easy, old-fashioned prosperity, and narrates the long history of the structures,
showing his little museum of curiosities--now a whale's jaw bequeathed from the old fishing
days, now a Revolutionary cannon-ball--and helps us to realize the ancient times by means of
the music of the mill, which is loquacious now as it was under George III.

Such is a specimen of one of the stout old industries of a hundred years ago, still surviving
and hale as ever, though out of its former proportion amongst the immense enterprises of modern
days. This article, however, must pass out of the atmosphere of ancient tradition as quickly
as possible, being intended to show the handsome city of Wilmington with its sleeves rolled
up as it were, and in the thick of the hardest work belonging to the nineteenth century. When
steam was introduced to revolutionize labor, and railroads came to supplement water-transport,
they found the manufacturers of this prosperous town ready to avail themselves of every improvement,
and pass at once from the chrysalis state into the soaring development of modern enterprise.

That is a feature the citizens point out with a good deal of honest pride--the prosperity of
the old families, enabling them at once to invest in the most enormous of modern mechanical
applications. The wealthy companies now found here did not go to work by calling for capital
from the large cities: they went to the old stocking, and found it there. The manufacturers
show you, reared in a back office or sticking on a wall, the ancient family sign, which Washington
and La Fayette regarded at the time of their disasters along the Brandywine. It is one continuity
of thrift.

Take, for instance, some of these Lairds of America, who build ships along the Delaware as
their prototypes upon the Clyde. The Harlan & Hollingsworth Company claims to be the oldest
iron shipbuilding establishment in America. The money in this concern was local. The partners
were old neighbors, relatives or friends. They worked along as a firm until 1868, when the
huge proportions of their business induced them to incorporate themselves as a company, still
distinguished by the good old proper names. We stroll into their domain by the river-side,
and if we previously cherished any notion that shipbuilding was a decayed institution in America,
the lively tumult here will effectually drive the insulting thought out of our heads. Among
a shoal of leviathans stretched out beside the waters there is the iron steamer Acapulco, waiting
for her compound engines from John Elder & Co. of Glasgow: she is three hundred feet long (and
that is a dimension that looks almost immeasurable when dry on land), forty feet beam and twenty-five
hundred tons burden. Another, of similar dimensions, is building beside her, and they are both
intended for the Pacific Mail Company's line, and will ply between California and China. The
various operations going on upon the ground--the laying of an iron keel three hundred feet
long, the modeling into true and fine curves the enormous plates for a ship's side, the joining
of these so neatly that the rivets are not visible, and the bending of stout iron timbers on
vast iron floors--are interesting even as a mere spectacle; and the trains of men who go about
to minister to the various great machines seem like races of beings suddenly diminished in
the scale of magnitude, and to be so many wise Lilliputians attending around the bodies of
creatures of Brobdingnag. It is true that neat mechanical contrivances save their muscle wherever
it is possible. A great plate of iron or a bundle of deck flooring is picked up, by a hand
which swings down from aloft, like a visiting-card by a lady: a single man turning a windlass,
it sails into the air, gets up as high as it chooses to, and drops delicately just where it
is wanted along the length of the structure. Out on the wharf a double "hoister," working by
steam, and able to pick up and swing a hundred tons, is used in handling the materials of the
works. The dry-docks are, in winter, a singular spectacle. They are a vast hospital of interesting
invalids, the patients being steamers, barges and canal-boats. For instance, the old Edwin
Forrest, which has paddled up the Delaware with excursionists since a time whereof the mind
of man runneth not to the contrary, comes up into the dry-dock complaining of its bunions.
The dry-dock accommodates a ship as long as three hundred and forty feet, and is one hundred
feet across. The gouty steamer potters comfortably in, and lays up its tired keel, while the
dock is being discharged, as serenely as a patient who lays his foot on the knee of a corn-doctor:
in due time, relieved and sound, the invalid is ready to take the stage of life again. Another
boat comes in to be lengthened: it has growing-pains, and wants assistance. The stern is sliced
off, the keel is spliced, and the adolescent leaves the docks longer by twenty feet. On the
steamers that are being finished we notice the extreme beauty of the upholstery and of the
engraved, inlaid and polished woodwork: it is all done on the spot, and before we leave Wilmington
we shall have many occasions to admire the luxury with which the higher kinds of joinery are
prepared for the various structures made there. On our way to the car-works--for this versatile
corporation is a great manufacturer of railway-carriages too--we notice the throngs of workers
scattered like ants over every part of the huge area, and it occurs to us to ask if there are
any strikes. Our conductor is Mr. J. Taylor Gause, a big, hearty, shrewd man, who knows every
bolt and rivet on the whole premises as Bunyan knew the words of his Bible.

"We never have any trouble," replies Mr. Gause; "and it is owing to a way we have of nipping
sea-lawyers in the bud."

And what, may we ask, are sea-lawyers?

"Sea-lawyer is a workman's term. The sea-lawyer is the calculating, dissatisfied, eloquent
man. He is the Henri Rochefort of their assemblies. A supposed grievance arises, the men have
a meeting, and the sea-lawyer begins to stir them up, big in his opportunity. We find who he
is, pay him on the instant, and send him away. The men run about for a while with their complaints
in their heads, but with nobody to utter them by. It ends by their coming to us in a body to
receive back the mischief-maker, by this time repentant. This we generally do, getting a friend
converted from an enemy."

In fact, the workmen of this city do not strike. The principal remedy for the disease is a
simple one. They are householders, being aided to own their own houses. They are therefore
committed to the interests of the place, and do not deal in revolutions which would make wandering
Ishmaelites of them.

The Harlan & Hollingsworth Company makes great numbers of railway-cars, from the ordinary kind
to the most luxurious saloon-cars, and the examination of the shops is entertaining enough.
Pullman, in fact, is said to have had more of his luxurious parlor-cars built in Wilmington
than in any other city. As we are going, however, to see these carriages constructed where
their manufacture is a specialty, we will not linger here, where they occupy but a part of
an enormous establishment.

We will visit some more of the American Lairds. Pusey, Jones & Co. show you the vast extent
of their premises, occupying ten acres and extending along the water in a thousand feet of
wharfage. Their iron ships--one of which the artist has caught just after its completion--and
other boats are moving to-day on nearly every river emptying into our Atlantic coast or the
Gulf of Mexico. Steamboats of their build are now troubling the more distant waters of the
Atrato, Magdalena, Orinoco, Amazon, Purus, Madeira, Tocantins, Ucayali, La Plata, Parana and
Guayaquil Rivers of South America. They have other branches of manufacture, uniting the industries
of the land to the toil of the sea. They turn out great quantities of machinery and many engines
for paper-mills and iron-rolling mills, either of which they supply in every detail. This is
an old and experienced firm, fully settled in character, credit and reputation.

Another great industrial combination is the Diamond State Works, established in 1853, occupying
a whole block, and enjoying a frontage of three hundred and fifty feet on the Christine. Here
are made the vast variety of things into which iron can be rolled or pinched. The eye is puzzled
and pleased at the groups of intelligent machines standing up in their places and moulding
with their steel fingers the rivets and the bolts; the railroad spikes, washers and fish-joints;
the nuts, whether hot-pressed or cold-pressed; the lag-screws and the bolt-ends. Bars of all
sizes and for an endless number of uses are pressed out like dough, and stored for sale in
enormous warehouses. Mr. Mendinhall and Mr. Clement B. Smyth, the president and vice-president
of this company, are of long experience in the management of their business; and the business
of the company increases from year to year, demanding all the room in its commodious location,
and necessitating an office in New York, where, at No. 71 Broadway, the large disbursing interests
of the works are partly attended to.

Such are the bare commercial facts. But stand in one of these noisy working-grounds of a manufacturing
place like Wilmington, or ride up to the top of one of their buildings on the steam-elevators
which some of them employ. Think how these men of iron are changing the surface of the earth,
spiking rails to the prairie in distant territories, or sending into Polynesian archipelagoes
the rivet on whose integrity depends the safety of the iron ship. How needful to human progress
is the conscientious perfection of their work! What tact they must employ in dealing with phalanxes
of laborers of different nations and imperfect intelligence! What a stimulus to genius they
are, with their readiness to catch at any labor-saving machine! See that astute-looking dwarf
of an apparatus, biting off red-hot ends of rods, closing its jaws together upon them in such
a way as to form a four-square mould, then smartly hitting one end so as to make a projecting
head: a railroad spike is turned off in a moment. See this other making "nuts" as smartly as
a baker makes ginger-nuts: some are raw and some are cooked--that is, some are punched hot
and some cold, sufficing for different purposes: the cold are the softer, and the easier to
"tap" or perforate with the screw--thread. Other machines are scissors trimming plates of iron
like cardboard; others, in a careless kind of way, spend all their time in nipping off whatever
bolts and bars are presented to them; and others make pretty rows of rivet-holes all along
the edges of huge iron plates. These animated creatures of the mill, performing their tasks
like child's play, are efforts of intellectual genius as truly as are the dramas of Shakespeare.
And busy talents are growing up in our manufacturing centres as in hotbeds, each one trying
to carry the domain of mechanical substitution a little farther, and so escape the necessity,
so costly in America, of paying for man-power. In several ways a grand manufactory is a college,
stimulating the human minds engaged there in the highest degree, setting a premium on intellect
and culture, and reminding us that whoever caused some idea to take shape that never had an
existence before, was called by the ancients a "poeta."

We will explore another of these great working-places--this time, a group of mills as large
as a modest village, yet devoted to one special product. In 1864, Mr. Henry B. Seidel purchased
a rolling-mill which had already been in operation with varied success for eighty years, and
established the manufacture of large plates for iron ships and boilers. In a few years, associating
with himself his superintendent, Mr. Hastings, he greatly enlarged his operations, and the
firm found their edifice too small. An ample new one, one hundred and twenty-five feet long,
was put up in 1870, upon the Church street side of their property, and with the introduction
of all the new machines became capable of the quickest and completest operations. Seidel &
Hastings now run both mills, and turn out, when working night and day, at the rate of between
five and six thousand tons of plate iron per annum. They prepare their own "blooms" of charcoal
iron at a great forge erected on their premises: this forge has five fires, and is provided
with the engines and blowing-cylinders for the manufacture of boiler iron, and the monster
steam-hammers necessary in its preparation. Nature's products are here taught manners with
a witness: whatever shape they enter in, they leave in the form of pie-crust. The tough old
genius of iron, which has been trying since the creation to build itself into mountains or
dissipate itself in bogs, is taught by the powerful persuasions of these gentlemen to pack
and toughen itself into cards, and is only recognized by the foreman when he takes count of
stock as "plate inch and a half" or "plate one-eighth."

But the reader has had enough of iron. We will relieve him--though we cannot promise not to
revert to the metals--with a glimpse of some different kinds of employment. Nothing, now, can
be softer than kid, nothing more scholarly than a morocco book-binding, nothing is more brilliant
in the autumn woods than sumach, nothing is more graceful than the pet goat of Esmeralda. We
will pay a visit to one of the morocco-factories, premising that our independent little city
of Wilmington has a wide reputation in the trade for her excellence in this special article,
and that her product in morocco is actually the largest single item of her trade, the production
last year having exceeded two million dollars' worth. We will enter a specimen factory, where
the tame African goats playing about the yard, by putting their skins into contact with the
powdered sumach lying up stairs in the bags, are to yield us specimens of about the best American
morocco known to commerce. The superiority of the Wilmington product is attributed by buyers
to something in the quality of the Brandywine water, but probably the high condition and tone
of the workmen has more to do with it. In Wilmington, where a workman finds that a given rate
of wages represents better living and more happiness than in any large city, the labor obtainable
for the pay is naturally of a higher character; and this, in a business where everything depends
upon hand manipulation, is a controlling influence. The factory we select is that of Pusey,
Scott & Co., at Madison and Third streets, five stories high and a hundred and sixty feet deep.
Over this scented labyrinth we go, up stairs and down; now among the slippery vats, where the
hides are deprived of their hair; now into a bright room, where half a dozen pretty sewing-machine
girls are stitching the wet, slimy skins into bags; now into gloomy cellars, where these bags
are filled with sumach-dust and water. The scene in these dark apartments, where many of the
workmen are negroes, is especially high-flavored and like a chapter in Vathek. Writers usually
talk of "life in the iron-mills" as conducing to the development of herculean strength. But
iron-workers are apt to be dry and wiry, their flesh half sweated off and their complexions
unnaturally pale. For true muscular development, rather Flemish and beefy in quality, we would
instance the workmen in this department of a morocco-factory. The skins when filled with water
are very heavy, and the jolly fellows who play at aquatic games with them, now ducking into
the tanks, now holding a bag under the hopper whence the sumach descends, and anon stirring,
manipulating and inspecting the mass of floating pillows, are true heroes out of Rubens' pictures.
The scenes up stairs again, where young Swedes and Irish boys dress the dry skins, painting
them over with black, and polishing and graining them by rubbing them with stones (a back-breaking
operation, apparently, in the attitude of laundresses bent over an eternal washboard), are
all highly entertaining. In the store-rooms we see the handsome sheets of morocco, including
the kangaroo skins from Australia, perforated here and there with the hunter's shot, and distinguishable
by the enormous flap which has, in the creature's life, encased the tail. Among them all the
little orphaned kid skins, clothed in mourning colors and so soft and small, look very innocent
and interesting. The distinguishing claim of Wilmington is that of having been the pioneer
to introduce machinery into this as into other kinds of business. Several kinds of labor-saving
apparatus are explained to us, and the foresight in building the apartments so that the skins
travel from stage to stage with the least possible lifting is pointed out. These economies
are said to be unmatched in the world. In this manufacture the relations of employers with
employed, and amongst each other, would appear to be particularly happy. The morocco-makers
of Wilmington seem to believe that worth makes the man, that readiness to do a favor to fellow-manufacturers
is what shows the true "grain," and that "the rest is naught but leather and prunello." In
dealing with their men, Messrs. Pusey, Scott & Co. have kept up the best relations, and have
solved the difficult, the crucial problem in these latitudes, of inducing whites and negroes
to labor side by side at the same task in harmony. We believe that this one fact alone, if
we were able to develop it eloquently, would be found to stamp the character of the principals
with the best traits of benevolence, tact and sense. Mr. Warner, our guide through the premises,
concludes the exhibition by showing us a curious set of great books in the counting house,
where the foreman of each department records his answer daily to a list of printed questions,
stating his figures, his ideas, reports, suggestions and complaints. This diurnal inquisition,
which morally gives ventilation to the whole establishment, and relieves difficulties at their
start, seems to be another indication of an enviable relationship, keeping up an excellent,
old-fashioned sympathy between employers and operatives.

From morocco-dressing to carriages, which are curtained and cushioned with morocco, is not
a difficult step. La Bruyère, who wrote a whole book without making any transitions, would
have passed without effort from the establishment of Pusey, Scott & Co. to the coach-factory
of McLear & Kendall. It should be premised that coach-building is another of the very special
successes of Wilmington. She produced last year an amount, in cash value, of carriages greater
than her iron ships, greater than her cotton fabrics, being one million four hundred thousand
dollars. The engraving shows the outside magnitude of McLear & Kendall's factory, the largest
in the city, but cannot show the curious effect of the great show-room, filled with rockaways,
buggies of all kinds, and park phaetons. The building, which was put up in 1865, is on Ninth,
King and French streets, and is two hundred and eighteen feet in length. These makers produce
annually fifteen hundred vehicles, which are shipped to all parts of the United States. An
engine of forty horse-power assists the workmen, of whom a hundred and seventy-five are kept
in employment, earning the high wages commanded by skilled labor, or, on an average throughout
the factory, twenty dollars per week.

After the ponderous establishments near the mouth of the Christine, and the neater sorts of
industries which can be carried on within the city, we come to notice some of the mills and
factories up stream. Many of these are of great antiquity.

Walton, Whann & Co. boast that fully one-half the arrivals and departures of shipping at Wilmington
are in connection with their business. What is that business? Why, it is the revival of the
fertility of the South, exhausted by the land-murdering agriculture of slavery. The demand
from the cotton regions since the war has been enormous for the best artificial fertilizers,
and the appreciation of the particular kind made by Walton, Whann & Co. is very marked. Planters
have learned the fact, which science and experience demonstrate, that a reliable compost must
be now used for the remunerative culture of cotton, as well as of their corn and other staples;
and their preference for the superphosphate prepared by this firm over most other fertilizers
is evinced by the fact that their demand has for several years been largely in excess of the
supply. We need not wonder, then, at the formidable preparations made for this mighty overdriven
business. The cargoes discharging by means of steam-power into the barges proceed from mills
covering several acres of ground, and worked by three engines, aggregating one hundred horse-power.
Think of it! the strength of one hundred horses overtasked day by day to provide this magic
powder, through which the tired real horse is to drag the plough in so many thousands of distant
acres! The machinery for grinding the organic materials is of the most approved excellence,
and is tested by the turning out, with the power stated, of full fifteen hundred tons of the
phosphate per month. A visit to the store-house of this factory is a strange sight, reminding
the tourist of the open-air cemetery of the Capuchins at Rome. It is a realm of bones. Bones
from the South American pampas, bones from the pork-packing houses of Cincinnati, bones from
the grazing plains of Texas, come here to mingle. The skeletons of half a continent meet in
these whirling mills for a prodigious Dance of Death, being most emphatically denied what is
the last wish of all sentient creatures--rest for their bones.

This factory is on the Christine River, just outside the limit of the city. On Redclay Creek--a
tributary to the Christine, running into it parallel with the Brandywine--a number of mills
have seated themselves, attracted by its swift torrent, amid scenery of steeps and rapids comparable
to that on the Lehigh about Mauch Chunk. Of these the most interesting traditions attach to
the Faulkland Mills. Their name may remind the reader of the first novel of the late Lord Lytton--Falkland,
written in 1828--but it was given to the spot long before in designation of a primitive settlement,
Faulk's Land. The association with this site is that of Oliver Evans, the true inventor of
the locomotive, who here worked and dreamed in a mill enriched with his contrivances.

Evans, like Fitch, is one of the world's lost renowns. Had the legislators of his time possessed
sagacity enough to endow his inventions, the advantages of steam-transport would have been
anticipated by several years, and the glory would have radiated from the Delaware River instead
of from the Hudson. His design for a locomotive was sent to England in 1787, disputing priority
with the "steam-wagons" of James Watt. He built steamboats at Philadelphia in 1802 and 1803,
and ran them successfully, antedating by five years the Clermont of Robert Fulton--Fulton,
whom people are beginning to regard, with Mr. Stone, author of the recent History of New York,
as the man who has received the greatest quantity of undeserved praise of all who ever lived.
Oliver Evans, born in 1755 of a respectable family, was a miller at Faulkland, where his smaller
inventions were first put in use. The plank just under the apex of the roof, which he used
to retire to as his private study, was shown until 1867, when the old mill was burned. Up among
the swallows, as he lay on the board--to which, as Beecher expresses it, he "brought the softness"--the
children of his genius were conceived and delivered. The mill was full of his labor-saving
machines, which clattered to the babbling Redclay. One of his notions was the mill "elevator"
(an improvement of something he had seen in Marshall's mill at Stanton), by which grain was
raised to the top of the building in buckets set along a revolving belt which passed from the
roof to the bottom, distributing the wheat with spouts to the bolt. This was set up, by contributions
among the millers, at Shipley's great mill in Wilmington, and also introduced into his own,
where his other inventions of the "conveyer" and the "hopper-boy" attracted the stares of the
rival millwrights. Poor Oliver was known to the fat millers of this neighborhood as the inconvenient
person who was always wanting the loan of a thousand dollars to carry out a new invention.
The "thinking men" among them sagely argued that his improvements would benefit the consumer,
by increasing the supply of flour and making it cheap--a clear detriment to the interests of
capital. Then Oliver plunged desperately into his idea of steam-motion, losing the faint vestiges
of his repute for wit, and died poor and heartbroken in 1819, the hero of an unwritten tragedy.
The happy hours of his life were the hours on the dusty plank in the mill-gable at Faulkland.

Evans's mill was bought in 1828 by Mr. Jonathan Fell, and turned into the spice-grinding establishment
which is still operated by his descendants on the same ground. But Fell's business was much
older than that purchase, being a good representative of the ancestral industries that exist
in such numbers among Penn's settlers. Early in this century the passengers in Front street
in Philadelphia laughed at the juxtaposition of a sign just put up with an older one, the two
reading thus: "James Scholl--Jonathan Fell." He had purchased the spice-grinding business of
an English immigrant on that site, and now the same business is carried on at Faulkland, one
hundred and seven years from its commencement, in the thirteenth generation of Fell's descendants,
after a career of accumulated and undeviating success. Moving the factory to Faulkland, and
retaining the Philadelphia situation as a warehouse, the family have kept the old system unchanged,
served by employés as steady as themselves, two of the latter having died of old age after
forty years in their service. The present works of C.J. Fell & Brother, combining steam and
turbine-wheel power, are represented as the most complete in America, and produce a great variety
of condiments, which season the traveler's meal in whatever State or Territory of the Union
he may visit.

A chalybeate spring at Faulkland, formerly much resorted to, is now in railway communication
with Wilmington, and will recover its ancient prestige. Under the ownership of Mr. Matthew
Newkirk, the late railway manager of Philadelphia, a large hotel at the Brandywine Springs
was filled with rich Southerners for many summers, but the house was destroyed by fire, and
the flow of visitors turned aside. One of the smaller houses, with accommodation for two hundred
guests, is the present claimant for watering-place custom. Its situation, with the fine water-scenery,
and a natural coliseum of wooded hills, is very attractive, and the restorative properties
of the spring are proved and valuable.

One more interest attaches to Faulkland. Close by were the earthworks where Washington protected
his army, expecting the British attack, but, drawn from his intrenchments by a flank movement,
was tempted on, to sustain disaster at Chadd's Ford on the Brandywine.

We have just mentioned the site as in railway communication with the city of Wilmington. It
is time to speak of the town in its relation to means of transport and as a railroad centre.

The location of the burgh, so near the ocean, on the beach of an immense river, and in the
clasp of two smaller but partly navigable streams, kept it, in the old times, outside the latitude
of railway improvement. Its naval facilities were thought to be sufficient for what business
it had. The Baltimore line from Philadelphia passed through it, and could move its freight
either north or south. With the development of its iron manufactures, however, the necessity
of other connections became pressing, and in 1869 a road was opened to the coal-regions at
Reading, crossing the Pennsylvania Central at Coatesville. Another road leads to New Castle.
And now a short road has been opened to the westward, through a very rich region for way-freight;
and with some notice of this, an artery for various mines and quarries, we finish our duty
toward Wilmington as a railway nucleus.

The Wilmington and Western Railroad has not yet got over the excitement of being constructed.
The creative spirit, it may be said, was Mr. Joshua T. Heald, an enterprising Wilmingtonian,
already a director of the Wilmington and Reading line. It was he who drummed up the stock-subscriptions
among his fellow townsmen. On July 8, 1871, he struck the first pick into the line as president,
and in October, 1872, the road was opened for travel as far as Landenberg in Pennsylvania.
The Wilmington and Western Road crosses Christine River in the suburbs, then follows the valley
of Redclay Creek, past all its mills and local improvements, sends visitors to Brandywine Springs,
and passes the birthplace of the inventor Oliver Evans, while its contemplated extension will
pass it close to the birthplace of Robert Fulton, in the Peachbottom slate region of Pennsylvania.
No bad omen for a steam-road, to have had its ground first broken at the cradle of one steam
inventor and to lead to the cradle of another!

Regarding a map, to the west of Wilmington we see that there is a continuous tier of counties,
from one extremity of Pennsylvania to the other, which has no great railway running east and
west. A few of these counties are penetrated by feeders to the Pennsylvania Railroad or by
other lateral roads, but they are not opened by any general comprehensive system; yet this
section of Pennsylvania is one of the richest in mineral wealth. It has limestone, slate, iron
ore, bituminous coal and other deposits. From one extremity to the other it is a region well
worth development, and sure to reward by a large and valuable traffic the line of railway which
will carry its products to the tide-water markets for sale or transhipment. The road is still
an infant, but a good symptom is, that within six weeks of its opening the gross earnings of
the company had reached a sum more than equal to the weekly interest on its bonded debt. Its
extension to Oxford and the Susquehanna River is a matter for the immediate future.

So much for the facilities of moving Wilmington's many products by railway. It would be too
unjust, however, to pay court to these roads, which are matters of yesterday, and show no attention
to the system of water-transport for the sake of which her site was chosen two hundred years since.

Long years ago, Wilmington millers, wishing to ship flour to Philadelphia, used to walk down
to Market street wharf, and pulling a bellcord that hung outside a little brick office by the
river, summon to his duty the easy-going and cheerful freight-clerk of the transport line.
The old sign, with the name of "Warner" upon it, is still upon the office, but the bell is
gone, and the premises of Charles Warner & Co. have blossomed out into store-sheds and coal-sheds
beyond all calculation. The guiding instinct of the firm was found to be concentrated in the
handsome head of Mr. E. Tatnall Warner, a son and now a partner; and it was he who sketched
out the amplitude of the store-houses, and determined to bring the line into victorious competition
with the rail for all the freight of the port that would bear slow moving. The wharves of Warner
& Co. now extend from Water street to the Christine River, and from Market to King streets.
There are three communications daily with Philadelphia, and tri-weekly ones with New York and
Boston. Their Philadelphia line consists of two steam-barges of one hundred and fifty tons,
and they are constructing a third at a shipyard we have yet to examine--that of the Jackson
& Sharp Company--of two hundred and fifty tons burden. The four railroads of Wilmington--the
Baltimore line, the Wilmington and Reading, the Western, and the Delaware Road--all run their
cars by continuous rails to the wharves of Warner & Co., where freight is transferred from
cars to steamers with extreme rapidity, by four steam-hoisters placed on the ground for the
purpose. A stationary engine also takes hold of the cars, and moves them from place to place
on the rail as wanted. The handling by steam-power--a great change from the days of the old
bell under the eaves!--of course reduces greatly the necessity for mere human porters. The
steamers ply to a wharf at Chestnut street, Philadelphia, and also, as aforesaid, to New York.
In respect to the latter port, the Messrs. Warner anticipate an early day when various novel
manufactures established at Wilmington will demand new freights from the New York market, and
to hasten that day they offer very strong inducements for return cargoes. Such is a specimen
of a transport-office, transformed from old-fashioned ideas to the newest ambitions of the
time. While the iron road will always collect a large portion of moving merchandise, there
will still be another large portion for which the superior cheapness of water-transport will
be a successful inducement.

An immense bid which Wilmington makes for future greatness is in the excellence of her harbor.
Shipping there is at once safe and unimpeded in its exit. The Delaware and its bay below the
city are broad and without sudden bends. Ice does not gather, and the influence of the ocean,
by its tidal movement and salt water, makes the breaking of a channel comparatively easy. The
Christine harbor, from any point near its mouth, can be kept open to the sea in all ordinary
winters by a stout and well-built tug. The Christine is much wider--probably by three times--than
the Chicago River, upon which every ton of the magnificent commerce of that great city is delivered.
It has a better entrance and deeper water, as well as greater breadth. Wilmington believes
she has a better issue for her manufactures in the Christine and Delaware than Glasgow possesses
in the Clyde. The Clyde is narrower and more difficult to keep in order than the Christine,
and Glasgow's facilities for getting materials for shipbuilding are not as great as Wilmington's.

The difference in the cost of production of iron ships in Wilmington and on the Clyde, exclusive
of the premium on gold, is at this time about ten per cent. only. Taking the present price
of gold (fourteen), this increases the difference to about twenty-four per cent. The falling
off in the price of gold, which is so generally expected, together with the advance in labor
in Great Britain, and the consequent advance in the price of iron there, will soon bring the
cost nearly equal in both countries. Indeed, if our shipbuilders would use the light and inferior
iron in their ships that is used on the Clyde, the cost would not now materially differ. This
will not be done, however, for reasons that are too evident to need stating; and by waiting
until the prices have adjusted themselves naturally and permanently, a more lasting and desirable
prosperity will be gained. Meditating these considerations, Wilmington is quite serene and
fearless under the present temporary depression of American shipbuilding.

There are some features connected with the life and education of the operatives so abundant
in this town, some additional industries, a few items of religious history, and a few evidences
of modern taste or luxury, that we wish to consider; but these must be reserved for a second paper.

THE ROUMI IN KABYLIA.

SECOND PAPER.

The Roumi who leaves Constantina for Setif has a choice of two routes--one picturesque, lively
and covered with Roman remains; the other perfectly arid, and distinguished by the fact that
in five miles there are just four trees.

He turns, however, as he settles himself in his stirrup amongst the interested Arab population
of Constantina, to cast a last look at the ugly French streets in which, as a tourist, his
lot was cast. The Arab quarters, where life still flows on in the old African style, have seized
his attention exclusively, and he remembers with a kind of contemptuous remorse that he has
paid no regard to the smart modern edifices and offices that belong to French occupation. Yet
one of these, at least, the staring Napoleonic Palais de Justice, would yield him a romance
from time to time.

Here, in December, 1872, twenty-one natives of the Belezma were tried at a court of assizes
for the massacre, last April, of twelve French colonists. The affair was a sequel of the French-Prussian
war. The natives, for a long time past on good terms with strangers, became insolent, boasting
that France was ruined, and that all the French would soon disappear from Algeria. Some of
the tribes, however, remained, if not friendly, at least less hostile. The revolt had become
almost general, and on the 21st of April the sheikh Brahim of the Halymias informed the little
colony near Batna that they were no longer safe in the forest, and offered to escort them into
Batna. These colonists were the workmen at the saw-mills of a M. Prudhomme, about ten miles
out of the town. The Europeans, consisting of thirteen men, one woman named Dorliat and her
four children, set out the next morning, accompanied by Brahim and about forty of his men.
On arriving in a ravine they were suddenly attacked by a large body of the rebels. Six of the
party, who were in the rear, succeeded in escaping, but twelve of the men were massacred. Madame
Dorliat, it is said, owed her life to a native named Abdallah at the saw-mills, who, on seeing
her in tears before starting, said to her: "Woman, you have nothing to fear: no harm will be
done to you or to your children. As for the men, I will not answer for them." As she continued
to weep, he added: "Listen! When you see the guns pointed at your breast, say this prayer:
'Allah! Allah! Mohammed racoul Allah!' and you will be saved." He also taught the same prayer
to her children. In the midst of the slaughter several Arabs had leveled their firearms at
her to shoot her, when she remembered Abdallah's lesson, and throwing herself on her knees
to them repeated the invocation. The murderers stopped, made her say it over again, and asked,
"Do you mean it?" On her replying in the affirmative they spared her, but stripped her entirely
naked, and took from her three of her children: she only recovered them thirty-two days later,
and one of them died from a sabre-cut in the head, received during the fight. The woman's husband
was among the killed, and so was the proprietor of the mill, M. Prudhomme. Of the twenty accused
brought to trial at Constantina, twelve were condemned to death and three to hard labor; the
others, among whom was the sheikh Brahim, being acquitted.

Severe justice is the only condition on which French supremacy can be maintained in the country,
and probably for the general Arab populace the rule of the Gauls is a judicious one. But it
is to be questioned whether the rule of talion is the right one for the Kabyles. In 1871, at
the height of the French troubles with the Commune, formidable revolts were going on among
the descendants of those untamable wretches whom Saint Arnaud smoked out in a cave. In July
the garrison at Setif heard the plaint of a friendly cadi, named D'joudi, who had been wantonly
attacked for his loyalty to the French by some organized mutineers under Mohammed Ben-Hadad.
The poor wretch had been obliged to flee, with his women and his flocks, into the protection
of his country's oppressors. Since the chassepot has succeeded in reducing the Kabyles once
more to a superficial obedience, the courts have been busy with the sentences of their insubordinate
leaders. France imitates England's sanguinary policy in her treatment of rebellious and semi-civilized
tribes. Eight of the leaders of the Kabyle revolt of 1871 have been condemned to death, and
a number of others have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The Kabyles will take
their revenge when another European war places the Algiers colonists at their mercy.

The guides who accompany the traveler serve, in the absence of the trees, to attract his scrutiny.
These mountain Arabs are superb fellows. Lips almost black, and shaded with lustrous beards,
set off their perfect teeth, white, small, and separated like those of a young dog. Their black
eyes are soft or stern at will. They are usually of middle size, large-chested, as befits Arabs
from the hills, with small heads and finely-tapered wrists and ankles. They are dressed in
red, with a covering of two bornouses--a white one beneath, and a black one fastened over.
Long iron spurs are attached to their boots of red morocco, which come up to the knee; for
the Algerian Arab, a bare-legged animal when walking, is a booted cavalier when mounted. The
white haik, or toga, is fastened around the temples. The horse of the principal guide is a
fine iron-gray, with an enormous tail of black--high-stepping, and carrying his elaborately-draped
burden as proudly as a banner.

In contrast to this imposing guard of honor, the traveler minces along on a dumb, timid mule,
who smells the ground in a sordid and vulgar manner, and is guided by a pitiful rope bridle.
Such are the hackneys and the guides, engaged on the recommendation of the commandant of Constantina,
who undertake to carry us to Setif and on to Bou-Kteun in Kabylia.

Setif, the ancient metropolis of this part of Mauritania, and celebrated for a brave defence
against the invading Saracens, is now the healthiest spot occupied by the French in all Algeria.
It lies on a great table a mile above the sea, is fortified, and has four good streets, but
pays for its salubrity by the extreme outspokenness of the climate. It is subject to snow for
six months, and is enveloped in a cloud of dust the other six. It is in the midst of a great
grain-producing country, and is famed for its market, held every Sabbath. The surrounding folk
dress for market, instead of dressing for Sunday, and exhibit the whitest of bornouses above
the dustiest of legs as they sit crooning over trays of eggs or onions, brought far on foot
through the powdery roads.

As we leave Setif we are overtaken by the lumbering stage-coach, which plunges and jolts over
the road to Sibou-Areridj--a coach apparently about the age of the carriage of General Washington,
for Algeria is the infirmary of all the worn-out French diligences. Sibou-Areridj is reached
and passed, and a few miles farther on is encountered an Arab douar, or assemblage of tents
forming a tribal fraction. This woven village, although we have attained the limits of Kabylia,
reminds us that we have not yet reached the Kabylian abodes: an Arab lives in a tent in all
localities outside the great cities--a Kabyle, never. However poor the hut in which the Kabylian
artisan starves and labors, it must be a solid mansion founded upon the soil, and its master
must feel himself a householder. Our douar proves to be an encampment belonging to the marabouts,
or high religious orders, situated on a large plot of ground in the ownership of the saints,
and extending up to the limits of Kabylia. Composed of a circle of tents numbering about fifty,
and exhibiting numbers of fine horses picketed near the tent-doors, it is as fine a specimen
as we shall see of the patriarchal life inherited from the unfatherly father of Ishmael. The
pavilions are of a thick camel's hair stuff, very laboriously made by the women, which swells
up in the rain and completely excludes moisture. They are striped brown and yellow, but a splendid
tabernacle in the centre, of richer colors and finer fabric, bears at the apex a golden ball
with plumes of ostrich feathers, the sign of authority. This tent is oval in form, resembling
an overturned ship. It is the residence and office of the sheikh, or chief of the douar: several
douars united form a tribe, governed by a caid. We venture to visit the sheikh, assured by
our spahi guides that we shall be welcome. We are received blandly by the officer, offensively
by his dogs, a throng of veritable jackals who scream around our feet as we enter. The interior,
rich and severe at once, exhibits saddles and arms, gilded boxes and silken curtains, without
a single article of furniture. The sheikh treats us to mild tobacco in chiboukhs--another sign
that we are not yet in Kabylia: never is a Kabyle seen smoking. We reciprocate by offering
coffee, made on the spot over our spirit-lamp--a process which the venerable sheikh watches
as a piece of jugglery, and then dismisses us on our way with the polite but final air which
Sarah may be supposed to have used in dismissing Hagar.

The douar, like a city, has suburbs of greater squalor than its interior, and among them, under
the palm trees, we see women washing clothes or engaged in the manufacture of couscoussou,
a dish common to the Arab, the Kabyle and the traveler hereabouts, and so important that a
description of its preparation may be acceptable.

In the opening of a small tent, then, we paused to watch an old moukere (or daughter of Araby),
whose hands look as if she had been stirring up the compost-heap of bones, pickings and dirt
before the door. With these hands she rolls dexterously a quantity of moistened flour upon
a plate. Long habit has made it easy to her, and in an incredibly short time she has formed
a multitude of small grains--her hands, it must be said, looking a great deal cleaner after
the process. On the fire is a pot of water, just placed. She interrupts her labor to throw
in a piece of kid, which, with a quantity of spices, she stirs around with her callous hand,
almost to the boiling-pitch of the water. She then addicts herself once more to the manufacture
of the flour-grains, of which she has directly made a perfect mountain. The water now boiling,
she places the granulated paste in a second earthen pot or vase, whose bottom, pierced like
a colander with holes, fits like a cover upon that in which the meat is boiling. The steam
cooks the grains, which are afterward served upon a platter, with the meat on top and the soup
poured over. All travelers agree that, when you do not witness the preparation, couscoussou
is a toothsome and attractive dish, fit to be set beside the maccaroni of Rossini.

On the plateau outside the douar we find the cemetery, with its tombs; for the Arab, content
to sleep under tissue while he lives, must needs sleep under mason-work after he is dead. Under
the koubba, or dome, is seen a sarcophagus covered with a crimson pall, the tomb of a dead
marabout: banners of yellow or green silk, the testimony of so many pilgrimages to Mecca, hang
over the dead. In the graveyard round about are tombstones roughly sculptured, and the stone
turbans indicating the cranium of a Mussulman; the Arab, again, after building his house of
camel's hair, ordering his last turban to be woven by the stone-mason!

We pass along a sterile country, with chalky rocks cropping from the ground and making our
way increasingly difficult. All is dry as a lime-basket. The climate here, completely wanting
in the sense of a just medium, knows no resource between the utter desiccation of all the water-courses
in summer and an outpouring in winter which carries away trees, crops and arable earth, presenting
the farmer with a result of boulders and sand. The rocks sound beneath our animals' feet for
an hour or two: we dip into a ravine and attain Bou-Kteun, our first Kabylian town.

It is night, and we invoke the hospitality of the village chief, called by the Kabyles the
amin. Our prayers are not refused. The amin receives the strangers, not so much from a feeling
of social etiquette, of which he knows little, as from his religion, which commands him to
receive the guest as the messenger of God. He comes to the threshold, kisses our hands without
servility, waits on us at a supper which he is too polite to share, and presents us with a
prayer at our bedside. Bou-Kteun, situated halfway up the "Red Plateau," guards the pass called
the Gates of Iron. It is an uninteresting village, the official house being alone respectable
amidst a town of huts. As the amin accompanies us a little way outside the burgh, we remark,
among the young orchards, stumps of olive and fig trees sawn away at the base. The amin shows
them with sad satire, saying in explanation, "French Roumi:" it was the Christian French.

That is the term, meaning no compliment, which the Kabyle fits to all Europeans alike. In vain
the Frenchman, writhing with intellectual repugnance, explains that he is not a Christian--that
he is a Voltairean, a creature of reason, an illuminé. The Kabyle continues to call him a Roumi,
which will bear to be translated Romanist, being imitated from the word Rome and applied to
all Catholics. These same tribes doubtless called Saint Augustine a Roumi, and he returned
the epithet Barbari or Berbers--a name which the emperors applied with vast contempt to the
hordes and mongrel population of exiles and convicts that peopled Mauritania, and which the
natives retained until the Arab invasion, when they changed Berber for Kebaïle.

The Romans conquered the shores and the plains. You find none of their ruins among the mountains,
where the Berbers, from the Roman occupation to the French, have preserved an independence
never completely subdued.

The Kabyle villages are united into federations. If these federations engage in quarrels--which
is by no means rare--or if a village is menaced by an enemy, signals are placed in the minarets
to appeal to the towns of the same party. These are easily seen, for all the villages are on
hilly crests and visible from a distance. From the summit of Taourit el Embrank we can count
more than twenty of these Kabyle towns, perched on the peaks around us, and separated by profound
chasms.

Every trait points out the distinction between the Kabyles and the surrounding Arabs. The Arabs
seek laziness as a sovereign good; the Kabyles are great artificers. The Arabs imprison their
wives; the Kabyle women are almost as free as our own. The Kabylian adherence to the Mohammedan
faith is but partial, and is variegated by a quantity of superstitions and articles of belief
indicating quite another origin. While the Koran proclaims the law of retaliation, eye for
eye and tooth for tooth, the more humane Kabyle law simply exiles the criminal for ever, confiscating
his goods to the community. It is true, the family of a murdered person are expected to pursue
the homicide with all the tenacity of a Corsican vendetta, but the tribal laws are kept singularly
clean from the ferocity of individual habits. A strange thing, indicating probably a derivation
from times at least as early as Augustine, is that the Kabyle code (a mixture, like all primitive
codes, of law and religion) is called by the Greek term canon (kanoun). An institution of great
protective use, in practice, is the safe-conduct, or anaya, a token given to a guest, traveler
or prescript, and which protects the bearer as far as the acquaintance of the giver extends:
it may be a gun, a stick, a bornouse or a letter. The anaya is the sultan of the Kabyles, doing
charity and raising no taxes--"the finest sultan in the world," says the native proverb. The
Kabyles press into all the towns and seaports for employment with the same independence as
if they were a neighboring nationality. They build houses, they work in carpentry, they forge
weapons, gun-barrels and locks, swords, knives, pickaxes, cards for wool, ploughshares, gun-stocks,
shovels, wooden shoes, and frames for weaving. They weave neatly, and their earthenware is
renowned. In addition, they are expert and shameless counterfeiters. Yes, the fact must be
admitted: these rugged mountaineers, so proud, and, according to their own code, so honorable,
never blush to prepare imitations of the circulating medium, which they only know as an appurtenance
and invention of their civilized conquerors. In his rude hovel, with all the sublimities of
Nature around him, this child of the wilderness looks up to the summits of the Atlas, "with
peaky tops engrailed," and immediately thereafter looks down again to attend to the engrailing
of his neat five-franc pieces, which can hardly be told from the genuine. This multiplication
of finance was punished under the beys with death. The bey of Constantina arrested in one day
the men of three tribes notorious for counterfeiting, and decapitated a hundred of them. There
was lately to be seen at Constantina the executioner who was charged with this punishment,
the very individual who cut off the ingenious heads of all these poor money-makers, and did
not "cut them off with a shilling." He appeared to modern visitors as a modest coffee-house
keeper in the Arab quarters, who would serve you, for two cents, a cup of coffee with the hand
that had wielded the yataghan. He was an old Turk, with wide gray moustaches, dressed in a
remarkable and theatrical fashion. He wore a yellow turban of colossal size, and an ample orange
girdle over a dress of light green. Poor Tobriz--that was his name--was violently opposed to
the introduction of the guillotine in Algeria. In the days of his prosperity an enormous sabre
was passed through his flaming girdle. In the early years of the French conquest Tobriz was
employed in the decapitations, which were executed with a saw, and must have been a horrible
spectacle. He remembered well the execution of the hundred counterfeiters in one night, and
their heads exposed in the market.

A rapid descent from Bou-Kteun to the bed of a river of the same name, and a pursuit of the
latter to its confluence with the river Biban, lead through impressive ravines to the Iron
Gates. The waters of the Biban, impregnated with magnesia, leave their white traces on the
bottoms of the precipices which enclose them. The mules pick their way over paths of terrible
inclination. At length, at a turn in the overhanging reddish cliffs, where a hundred men could
hold in check an entire army, we find ourselves in front of the first gate. It is a round arch
four yards in width, pierced by Nature between the rocks. The second is at twenty paces off,
and two others are found at a short distance. Between the first and second we observe, chiseled
in the stone above the reach of the water, "L'Armée Française, 1839," engraved by the sappers
attached to the army of the duke of Orleans on the passage of the expedition.

[TO BE CONTINUED.]

A CHINESE STORY.

  None are so wise as they who make pretence
  To know what fate conceals from mortal sense.
  This moral from a tale of Ho-hang-ho
  Might have been drawn a thousand years ago,
  Long ere the days of spectacles and lenses,
  When men were left to their unaided senses.

  Two young short-sighted fellows, Chang and Ching,
  Over their chopsticks idly chattering,
  Fell to disputing which could see the best:
  At last they agreed to put it to the test.
  Said Chang: "A marble tablet, so I hear,
  Is placed upon the Bo-hee temple near,
  With an inscription on it. Let us go
  And read it (since you boast your optics so),
  Standing together at a certain place
  In front, where we the letters just may trace.
  Then he who quickest reads the inscription there
  The palm for keenest eyes henceforth shall bear."
  "Agreed," said Ching; "but let us try it soon:
  Suppose we say to-morrow afternoon."

  "Nay, not so soon," said Chang: "I'm bound to go,
  To-morrow, a day's ride from Ho-hang-ho,
  And sha'n't be ready till the following day:
  At ten A.M. on Thursday let us say."

  So 'twas arranged. But Ching was wide awake:
  Time by the forelock he resolved to take;
  And to the temple went at once, and read
  Upon the tablet: "To the illustrious dead--
  The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang."
  Scarce had he gone when stealthily came Chang,
  Who read the same; but, peering closer, he
  Spied in a corner what Ching failed to see--
  The words, "This tablet is erected here
  By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear."

  So, on the appointed day--both innocent
  As babes, of course--these honest fellows went
  And took their distant station; and Ching said,
  "I can read plainly, 'To the illustrious dead--
  The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang.'"
  "And is that all that you can spell?" said Chang.
  "I see what you have read, but furthermore,
  In smaller letters, toward the temple-door,
  Quite plain, 'This tablet is erected here
  By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear.'"

  "My sharp-eyed friend, there are no such words!" said Ching.
  "They're there," said Chang, "if I see anything--
  As clear as daylight!" "Patent eyes, indeed,
  You have!" cried Ching. "Do you think I cannot read?"
  "Not at this distance, as I can," Chang said,
  "If what you say you saw is all you read."

  In fine, they quarreled, and their wrath increased,
  Till Chang said, "Let us leave it to the priest:
  Lo, here he comes to meet us." "It is well,"

C.P. CRANCH.

BERRYTOWN.

CHAPTER I.

A straggling old house, painted yellow, and set down between a corn-field and the village pasture
for family cows; old walnut trees growing close to its back and front, young walnut trees thrusting
themselves unhindered through beet and tomato patches, and even through the roof of the hennery
in the rear, which had been rebuilt to accommodate them, spreading a heavy shade all about,
picturesque but unprofitable.

Old Peter Guinness used to sit on the doorstep every hot summer evening, smoking his cigar,
and watching the hens go clucking up to roost in the lower branches and the cattle gathered
underneath.

"What a godsend the trees are to those poor beasts!" he said a dozen times every summer.

"Yes. We risk dampness and neuralgia and ague to oblige the town cows," Mrs. Guinness would
reply calmly.

"I shall cut them down this fall, Fanny. I'm not unreasonable, I hope. Don't say a word more:
I forgot your neuralgia, my dear. Down they come!"

But they never did come down. Mrs. Guinness never expected them to come down, any more than
she expected Peter to give up his cigar. When they were first married she explained to him
daily the danger of smoking, the effect of nicotine on the lungs, liver and stomach: then she
would appeal to him on behalf of his soul against this debasing temptation of the devil. "It
is such a gross way to fall," she would plead--"such a mean, sensual appetite!"

Peter was always convinced, yielding a ready assent to all her arguments: then he would turn
his mild, cow-like regards on her: "But, my dear, I smoke the best Partagas: they're very expensive,
I assure you."

Long ago his wife had left him to go his own way downward. As with smoking, so with other ungodly
traits and habits. She felt his condemnation was sure. It was a case for submission at the
female prayer-meeting; bemoaning his eternal damnation became indeed a part of her religion,
but the matter was not one to render her apple-cheeks a whit less round or her smile less placid.
The mode in which Peter earned their bread and butter interfered more with her daily comfort
and digestion. Dealing in second-hand books, half of which were dramatic works, was a business
not only irreligious, but ungenteel. She never passed under the swinging sign over the door
without feeling that her cross was indeed heavy, and the old parlor, which had been turned
into a shop, she left to the occupancy of her husband and Kitty.

Out of the shop, one summer afternoon, had come for an hour the perpetual scrape, scrape of
Peter's fiddle. He jumped up at last, suddenly, bow in hand, and went to the doorstep, where
his stepdaughter sat sewing. From the words he had overheard in the next room he was sure that
the decisive hour of life had just struck for the girl, and there she was stitching her flannel
and singing about "Alpine horns, tra-la!" She ought to have known, he thought, without hearing.
A woman ought to be of the kindred of the old seeresses, and by the divine ichor or the animal
instinct in her know when the supreme moment of love approached.

But what kind of love was this coming to Kitty?

He twanged the strings just over her head, to keep her from hearing, but quite out of tune,
he was so agitated with the criticalness of the moment. But then most moments were critical
to Peter Guinness, and agitation, his wife was wont smilingly to assure him, was his normal
condition.

He anxiously watched Catharine's restless glances into the room where her mother and the clergyman
sat in council. She had guessed their object then? She was opposed to it?

A thoughtful frown contracted her forehead. Suddenly it cleared: "Oysters? Yes, it is oysters
Jane is broiling. I'm horribly hungry. I could go round the back way and bring us a little
lunch in here, father. They'll never see us behind the books."

"Shame on you, Kit! You're nothing but a greedy child." But he laughed with a sudden sense
of relief. She really was nothing yet but a healthy child with a very sharp remembrance of
meal-times. It would be years before her mother or Mr. Muller would talk to her of the marriage
or the work they had planned for her.

"Just as you please," taking up her flannel again. "Very likely it will be midnight before
we have supper: Mr. Muller often forgets to eat altogether. From what mother tells me, I suppose
approving conscience and a plate of grits now and then carry him through the day. It's different
with me."

"Very different, Kitty. Don't flatter yourself that you will ever be like him in any way. William
Muller is a Christian of the old type. Though, as for grits, a man should not disregard the
requirements of the stomach too much," with an inward twinge as he smelt the oysters. He began
to play thoughtfully, while Kitty looked again through the book-shop to the room beyond. The
books about her always made unfamiliar pictures when one looked at them suddenly. They lay
now in such weights of age and mustiness on the floor, the counters, the beams overhead, the
yellow walls of them were lost in such depths of cobwebs and gloom, that they made a dark retreating
frame, in which she sat like a clear, fine picture in the doorway, the yellow sunset light
behind her. She could see her mother looking in at her, and the plump, neat little clergyman
in his tight-fitting ribbed suit of brown and spotless shirt-front. He gently stroked his small
black imperial as he talked, but his eyes behind their gold eye-glasses never wavered in their
mild regard of her. Kitty grew restless under it.

"Mr. Muller is talking of the class of books you keep, father," she said, lowering her voice:
"I'm sure of it. They are as unsavory in his nostrils as to the reformers in the village. They'd
all excommunicate you if they could."

"Guinness, Book Agent, Kitty," finishing his tune with a complacent scrape, "has been known
for twenty years, while Berrytown belongs to yesterday. But the intolerance of these apostles
of toleration is unaccountable. They mean well, though. I really never knew people mean better;
yet--" He finished the sentence with a shake of the head, solemnly burying the fiddle in its case.

Both he and Catharine turned involuntarily to the window. Five years ago there had been half
a dozen old buildings like the Book-house stretched along Indian Creek, the roofs curled and
black, the walls bulging with age and damp. Now, there was Berrytown.

Berrytown was the Utopia in actual laths, orchards and bushel-measures of the advance-guard
of the reform party in the United States. It was the capital of Progress, where social systems
and raspberries grew miraculously together. Thither hied every man who had any indictment against
the age, or who had invented an inch-rule of a theory which was to bring the staggering old
world into shape. Woman-Suffrage, Free-Love, Spiritualism, off-shoots from Orthodoxy in every
sect, had there food and shelter. Radical New England held the new enterprise dear as the apple
of her eye: Western New York stretched toward it hands of benediction. As Catharine looked
out, not a tree stood between her and the sky-line. Row after row of cottages replete with
white paint and the modern conveniences; row after row of prolific raspberry bushes on the
right, cranberry bogs on the left--the great Improved Canning-houses for fruit flanking the
town on one side, Muller's Reformatory for boys on the other. The Book-house behind its walnut
trees, its yellow walls clammy with lichen, was undeniably a blot, the sole sign of age and
conservatism in a landscape which, from horizon to horizon, Reform swept with the newest of
brooms. No wonder that the Berrytownites looked askance at it, and at the book-fanciers who
had haunted the place for years, knowing old Guinness to be the keenest agent they could put
upon the trail of a pamphlet or relic.

The old man grew surly sometimes when sorely goaded by the new-comers. "There's not a man of
them, Kitty," he would say, "but has ideas; and there's not an idea in the town five years
old." But generally he was cordial with them all, going off into rapt admiration of each new
prophet as he arose, and he would willingly have stood cheek by jowl with them in their planting
and watering and increase if they had not snubbed him from the first. Book-shops full of old
plays, and a man who talked of Scott's width of imagination and Clay's statesmanship, were
indigestible matter which Berrytown would gladly have spewed out of her mouth. "What have aimless
imagination and temporizing policy to do with the Advancement of Mankind? Dead weight, sir,
dead weight! which but clogs the wheels of the machine." Any schoolboy in Berrytown could have
so reasoned you the matter. While Catharine was growing up, therefore, the walnut trees had
shut the Guinnesses into complete social solitude until deliverance came in the shape of Mr.
Muller.

CHAPTER II.

Besides her supper now, Catharine wanted her share of this visitor. Nothing else, in fact,
came in or went out of her life. Outside lay emancipated Berrytown, to unemancipated Kitty
only a dumb panorama: inside, her meals, her lessons and perpetual consultations with her mother
on bias folds and gussets while they made their dresses or sewed for the Indian missions. Kitty
was quite willing to believe that the Berrytown women were mad and unsexed, but ought the events
of life to consist of beef and new dresses and far-off Sioux? She laughed good-humoredly at
her own grumbling, but she looked longingly out of the window at the girls going by chattering
in the evenings with their sweet-hearts; and certainly the Man coming into her life had affected
her not unpleasantly. Not that the clergyman, with his small jokes and small enthusiasms, was
any high revelation to her mind; but there was no other.

"It's something to hear a heavy step about the house, and to see the carpet kicked crooked,"
she said sometimes. Her mother would shake her hand gently and smile.

She shook her head and smiled in precisely the same way now. Mr. Muller, who had grown excited
as he talked, felt a wave of insipid propriety wash over his emotions, bringing them to a dead
level.

"However the matter may conclude," said Mrs. Guinness pleasantly, "why should you and I lose
our self-control, Mr. Muller? Now, why should we? Ah?"

There was something numbing in the very note of prolonged interrogation. The folds of Mrs.
Guinness's glossy alpaca lay calmly over her plump breast; her colorless hair (both her own
and the switch) rolled and rose high above her head; her round cheeks were unchanging pink,
her light eyes steady; the surprised lift of those flaxen eyelashes had made many a man ashamed
of his emotions and his slipshod grammar together.

Mr. Muller was humbled, he did not know why. "It is practical enough, I suppose," he said irritably,
"to ask what Catharine herself thinks of marriage with me?"

"You never tried to discover for yourself?" with an attempt at roguish shrewdness.

"No, upon my honor, no!" The little man fairly lost his breath in his haste. "I have a diffidence
in speaking to her."

"To Kitty!" with an amused, indulgent smile, which worsted him again.

He struggled back into the hardest common sense: "Of course it is not diffidence in me. I feel
no hesitation in discussing the question of marriage with anybody else. My family wish me to
marry: my sister has suggested several young ladies to me in well-to-do religious families
in the city. There are marriageable young women here, too, whose acquaintance I have made with
that object in view. Very intelligent girls: they have given me some really original views
on religion and politics. One can talk to them about anything--social evils or what not. But
Catharine--she is so young! It is like broaching marriage to a baby!"

Mrs. Guinness was silent. The sudden silence struck like a dead wall before the little man,
and bewildered and alarmed him: "Perhaps, Mrs. Guinness, you think I ought not to look upon
Catharine as another man would? I should regard a wife only as a fellow-servant of the Lord?
I oughtn't to--to make love to Kitty, in short?"

"She is a dear, pious child. I love to think of her in the midst of your Reformed boys," said
the lady evasively.

There was another pause. "Of course, you know," he said with an anxious laugh, "I never had
a serious thought of those young ladies chosen by my sister. Social position or wealth does
not weigh with me, Mrs. Guinness--not a feather!" earnestly. If he really had meant to give
her a passing reminder that marriage with Kitty would be a step down the social grade for him,
he was thoroughly scared out of his intention. As he talked, reiterating the same thing again
and again, the heat rose into his neatly-shaved face and little aquiline nose.

Mrs. Guinness observed his agitation with calm triumph. She knew but one ladder into heaven,
and that, short and narrow, was through her own Church. Kitty was stepping up on a high rung
of it. Once the wife of this good Christian man, and her soul was safe. A sudden vision of
her flitted before her mother in grave but rich attire (fawn-colored velvet, for instance,
for next winter, trimmed with brown fur), to suit her place as the wife of the wealthy Muller,
head of the congregation and the Reformatory school: she would be instant, too, at prayer--meetings
and Dorcas societies. This was Mrs. Guinness's world, and she reasoned according to the laws
of it. She rejoiced as Hannah did when she had safely placed her child within the temple of
the Lord.

And yet with that hint of the social position of the Mullers had come the certainty to her
that this marriage could never be. A shadow had stood suddenly before her--a boy's face, the
only one before which her calm, complacent soul had ever quailed or shrunk. The pleasant, apple-cheeked
woman, like the rest of us, had her ghost--her sin unwhipped of justice. She stood calmly as
Mr. Muller hurried his explanations, piling them one on top of the other, but she did not hear
a word of them. If he should ever hear Hugh's story! Dead though he was, if that were known
not a beggar in the street would marry Catharine.

But since Fanny Guinness was an amiable, pink-cheeked belle in the village choir, she had never
turned her back on an enemy: why should she now? Hugh Guinness had hated her as the vicious
always hate the good, but she was thankful she had smiled and greeted him with Christian forbearance
to the very last. As for this danger coming from him, now that he was dead, the safest way
was to drag it to the light at once. All things worked together for good to those who loved
the Lord--if you managed them right.

"Of course," she said, as if just finishing a sentence, "you are indifferent to social rank.
And yet it will be no slight advantage to you that Catharine has no swarm of needy kinsfolk.
Her own father died when she was a baby. Mr. Guinness is the only near friend she has ever
known except myself. He had a son when I married him--" The boy's name stuck in her throat.
For a moment she felt as the murderer does, forced to touch his victim with his naked hand.
"Hugh--Hugh Guinness--was the lad's name."

"I never heard of him," indifferently.

"No, it is not probable you should. Long before Berrytown was built he went to Nicaragua. He
died there. Well," with a little wave of the hand, "there you have Kitty's whole family. It
will be better that she should be so untrammeled, for the interests of the school."

"The school? I'm not a Reformatory machine altogether, I suppose!" He had been watching Catharine,
who was moving about in the shop. When he was not in sight of her he always remembered that
she was a mere child, to be instructed from the very rudiments up after marriage, and that
the Guinnesses were ten degrees, at least, below him in the social scale. But she was near--she
was coming! The complacent smile went out of his trig little features: he moved his tongue
about to moisten his dry lips before he could speak. He was absolutely frightened at himself.
"There's more than the school to be thought of, Mrs. Guinness," he blurted out. "I--I love
Catharine. And I want this matter settled. Immediately--within the hour."

"Very well. You will be satisfied with the result, I am sure, Mr. Muller. I give Catharine
to you with all my heart." But she did not look any more at ease than he. They both turned
to look at Kitty, who came toward them in her usual headlong gait through the shop.

CHAPTER III.

Her mother scanned Catharine when she came in as she had never done before. She was "taking
stock" of her, so to speak: she wished to know what was in the girl to have secured this lover,
or what there was to hold him should he ever hear Hugh's damning story. Her eye ran over her.
She was able to hold her motherly fondness aside while she judged her. Kitty was flushed and
awakened from head to foot with the excitement of this single visitor.

"At her age," thought Mrs. Guinness, "I could have faced a regiment of lovers. Kitty's weak:
I always felt her brain was small--small. She has nothing of my face, or address either. There's
no beauty there but youth, and her curious eyes." She never had been sure whether she admired
Kitty's eyes or not.

But clergymen and reformers were as vulnerable as other men to soft, flushing cheeks and moist
lips, and Mr. Muller, as she judged from his agitation, was no wiser than the rest. He pressed
nervously forward, bridging his nose with his eye-glasses.

"Catharine, my child, will you walk out with me? I wish to consult you on a little matter."

"Oh, with pleasure," said Kitty.

Her mother stood aghast. Like the mass of women, she viewed the matter of love from the sentimental,
L.E.L. stand-point. It had been a forbidden subject to Kitty. Her heart her mother supposed,
slept, like the summer dawn, full of dreams, passion, dewy tenderness, waiting for the touch
of the coming day. What kind of awakening would the plump "Will you marry me?" of this fat
little clergyman be? In the street of Berry town, too! in the middle of the afternoon! If it
were only moonlight!

"Pray wait until evening, Catharine: you're always famished for your supper," she cried anxiously.

"But I'm not hungry now at all," running up the stairs. For politeness' sake Kitty would lie
with a smile on her mouth though a fox were gnawing at her stomach. Something in her running
reminded Mr. Muller that she was a school-girl and he a middle-aged noted reformer. He fidgeted
about the room, looking at the prints of La Fayette and Franklin on the whitewashed wall, and
the Tomb of Washington done in faded chenilles by Mr. Guinness's first wife, buttoning his
gloves with an anxious frown.

"I'm sure I don't know what my sister Maria will say to this," after one or two uneasy laughs.
"I never mean to be eccentric, yet somehow I always am different from anybody else. Now, in
church-matters--I never intended to leave the orthodox communion, yet when I showed how my
Church was clinging to worn-out dogmas, and opened my Reformatory in Berrytown, the Free-Religionists
in Boston seized me, and printed my opening sermon under one cover with that of an Oneidaite
and a Spiritualist. Do I look like a medium or a Free-Lover? That was going a little too far,
I take it."

"Ah?" came Mrs. Guinness's calm interrogatory. No more.

William Muller was a man of culture and a certain force in one direction, and when pleading
the cause of the vicious children to whom he was giving his life could hold men of real mental
strength attentive and subdued. He did not know why, when this commonplace little woman had
her steady eye on him, he should always dribble out all his weakness to her. But he did it--talked
on in a leaky way of his squabble with his church and the praises he had received in newspapers
for his school, until he heard Kitty's step on the stairs.

"Ah! there she is!" he cried relieved.

Catharine came back, close buttoned in a brown dress, with high-laced boots, and a light stick
in her hand. She used to call it her alpenstock, and make all Switzerland out of the New Jersey
sands with it. She ran in to kiss her father good-bye, blushing and delighted. It was the first
time she had ever walked with any man but himself. "Here's an adventure!" she whispered. Every
day she and Peter expected an adventure before night. She drew back startled at the strange,
uneasy look he gave her. Her mother, too, pulled her hastily away, and walked beside her to
the gate.

"Child," she whispered breathlessly, "he is your lover."

"Lover?" said Kitty aloud. "Lover?" But Mr. Muller joined her at the moment, and opening the
gate motioned for her to precede him. They went down the quiet street together.

Mrs. Guinness went back and watched them from the shop-window. "It is as I thought," she said
triumphantly.

Peter nodded. She came behind him, leaning on his shoulder. "It was only proper for me to speak
to him of--of--" It was fifteen years since Hugh's name had passed between them.

"Whatever was necessary to protect you and Catharine," he said quietly. She pressed her hands
on his forehead beneath his wig, and presently he drew one of them down and held it to his
lips, thinking how forbearing she had been with his boy. Mrs. Guinness went up stairs then
and knelt down by the bed. She was rather fond of the exercise which she called praying--taking
a larger image of herself into her confidence. Her one idea of Him was that He could provide
comfortably here and elsewhere for herself and Catharine. But to-day her conscience irritated
her like a nettle. Could it be that she was at soul tricky? Could God hold her, rigorous church-member,
fond wife and mother as she was, guilty of this boy's blood? Nettles, however, do not sting
very deeply. She rose presently, unfolded her work, and sat sewing and singing a hymn, a complacent
smile on her good-humored face.

Down in the shop Peter had taken out the violin again, and was playing some nameless old air,
into the two or three monotonous notes of which had crept an infinite stillness and longing.
He often played it, but only when he was alone, for he would not allow Kitty to hear any but
merry, vivacious music.

CHAPTER IV.

Meanwhile, Catharine and Mr. Muller walked down the street in absolute silence, Kitty bearing
herself with her usual grave politeness, though there was a quizzical laugh in her eyes. "Lover?
My lover?" she thought. But she did not blush, as some other innocent girls would have done.
She had never talked an hour in her life to a young man, or heard from other girls their incessant
chirping of "he--he," like that of birds in spring wooing their mates. Her nearest acquaintance
with lovers was old Peter's rendering of Romeo or Othello. She remembered them well enough
as her eye furtively ran over the jaunty little figure beside her. "Is his hose ungartered,
his beard neglected, his shoe untied?" she thought. "Pshaw! he is not Orlando, any more than
I am Rosalind." Her mother had been mistaken, that was all: she let the matter slip easily
past her. There was a certain tough common sense in Catharine that summarily sent mistakes
and sentimental fancies to the right about.

Mr. Muller, finding the words he wished to speak would not come at once, and ashamed of jogging
on in silence, began to overflow with the ordinary ideas of which he was full. They passed
the grape-packing house. "Eight thousand boxes despatched last season, Catharine! And there
is the Freedmen's Agency. Three teachers supported, five hundred primers furnished to Virginia
alone since January, and I really forget the number of Bibles. But the world moves: yes indeed.
And I think sometimes Berrytown moves in the van."

"I've no doubt of that," said Kitty politely. "Dear me! Five hundred spelling-books!" But she
felt humiliated. She had neither picked grapes nor taught freedmen. What thin wisps of hair
these women had stopping to speak to Mr. Muller! She put her hand suddenly to the back of her head.

"Those are employees in the canning-house," he said as they passed on. "One is educating herself
as a short-hand reporter, and the other has a lecture ready for next winter on Shakespeare's
Women."

"What admirable persons they must be! Ah! now I have it right!" setting her hat higher on the
light chestnut coils. Mr. Muller looked, and his eye rested there. She knew that, though the
back of her head was toward him. But lover? Nonsense! He meant no doubt to propose that she
should go into the typesetting business or stenography.

Now, to tell Kitty's secret, she had had her love-affair her mother knew nothing about, which
made her purblind in this matter. It was this: There was a certain cave (originally a spring-house)
behind the walnut trees, quite covered over with trumpet-vines and partridge-berries. She had
a bench there, from which she could see only the shady old house and the sun going down. When
she was a child of about eight, alone all day long, year in and out, she had taken down this
bench, and working stealthily and blushing terribly, had made it large enough for two. She
never allowed anybody, not even Peter, dearest of all, to come into the cave or sit on the
bench afterward. What her childish fancy of an unknown friend was, or how it grew and altered
with her years, only she knew, though after she was grown she told her father of a certain
Sir Guy in some of his crusading stories in whom she had believed as a fact. "I actually thought
he would come to woo me," she said laughing, "and I had a castle where I sat and waited for
him. There never was a child so full of absurd fancies."

But she never said where the castle was, and she was fond still of sitting alone for hours
on the old bench, over which the shade grew heavier year by year, and the moonlight crept with
more mysterious glitter. She came in sometimes when she had been there in the evening, and
the sound of old Peter's violin alone broke the silence, with her cheeks feverish, as though
there had been an actual presence with her to share her secret thoughts. The only living being
she had ever taken into her hiding-place was, oddly enough, a baby of whom she was fond. It
happened to fall asleep in her arms one day, and Catharine stole out with it and sat on the
old seat, feeling its warm breath on her breast. The girl was shaken by an emotion which she
did not understand: her blood grew hot, her breath came and went, she stroked the baby's hand
and foot, kissed it, glanced about her with eyes guilty yet pure.

But it is certain Kitty had no thought of her cave this afternoon. Mr. Muller and his affairs
were quite another matter. There was an awkward silence. Mr. Muller was collecting his forces:
he cleared his throat. "Catharine--" he said.

"Ah, William!" cried a clear, well-toned voice behind them. He turned, half annoyed and half
relieved, to meet a young lady in gray, stepping alertly from the doorway of the Water-cure House.

"Maria? This is my sister Maria, Miss Vogdes."

The lady looked at Kitty--a steady, straightforward look--then held out her hand. It was a
large, warm, hearty hand, and gripped yours like a man's. Kitty took it, but felt like shirking
the eyes. She had no mind to be so weighed and measured. She had an uncomfortable consciousness
that her inner nature was all bared and sorted by this agreeable young woman in this first
moment to the last odd and end in it, though she could not have put the consciousness into words.

"Going to the school, William? I am."

"Well--yes, we will go there." He turned irresolutely, and they walked together down the plank
pathway, Kitty with an oppressive sense of having fallen into the clutch of one of the Primal
Forces, who was about to settle her destiny for her; in which she stumbled almost on the truth.
Miss Muller was quite aware of the fact of her brother's visits at the book-shop, and their
motive. She glanced at her watch: she could give herself half an hour to find out what stuff
was in the girl, though it hardly needed so long. "A good type of the Domestic Woman in the
raw state," she thought. (She always jotted down her thoughts sharply to herself, as a busy
shopkeeper makes entries in his day-book.) "Pulpy, kissable. A vine to which poor William would
appear an oak. A devoted wife, and, if he died, a gay widow, ready to be a fond wife to somebody
else."

"What do you mean to make of yourself, Miss Vogdes?" she snapped suddenly, just as Kitty was
counting the hen-coops of the society in the field they were passing, and wondering how she
could contrive to get a pair of their Cochin Chinas.

"To make?" stammered Kitty ("I knew she would take me by the throat somehow," she thought)--"of
myself?--Why, I am Peter Guinness's daughter."

"You poor child!" Miss Muller laughed. It was a very merry, infectious laugh. She laid her
hand on Kitty's shoulder gently, as though she had been a helpless kitten. "Now you see how
our social system works, William. Ask a boy that question, and his answer comes pat--a doctor,
carpenter, what not. In any case, he has a career, an independent soul and identity. This poor
girl is--Peter Guinness's daughter, is content to be that. Though perhaps," turning sharply
on her, "she thinks of the day when she will be the wife of somebody, the mother of children.
Those, two ideas are enough to fill the brains of most women."

Mr. Muller colored, and smiled significantly to himself. Catharine looked at her with a grave
suspense, but made no answer.

"Yes," Miss Muller went on, a certain heat coming into her delicate face, "that contents the
most of them--to be the fool or slave of a lover or a husband or son. 'The perfume and suppliance
of a minute--no more but that.'"

She walked on in silence after this, and Catharine scanned her quietly. She was not at all
the mad woman Mrs. Guinness had always described her--not at all what Kitty had fancied a lecturer
on woman suffrage, a manager of the Water-cure and a skillful operating surgeon must be. She
was little, pretty, frail, with a very genuine look and voice--almost as young as Kitty, and
far more tastefully dressed. Catharine eyed her wonderful coiffure with envy, and was quite
sure those rosy-tipped, well-kept fingers never had anything to do with cutting up dead babies.

Mr. Muller at the moment was comparing the two girls critically. The point on which he dwelt
longest was that his sister's eyes, fine, limpid and brown, were those of an actress, acting
to herself very probably. They went through the whole imperative mood--exhorted, commanded,
entreated in five minutes: even a certain woeful sadness which came into them at times, and
was there now, was quite bare and ready to be seen of all men.

"She is always on review before herself: she is conscious of herself from head to foot," he
thought with shrewdness only born out of long knowledge. "Her very toes, I've no doubt, say
to each other, 'I, Maria.'"

As for his future wife, her eyes were given her to see with, nothing more. "And she looks out
with them, never in," he reflected complacently. For he had come by this time to regard her
as his future wife. It seemed quite natural when Maria presently took Kitty in hand as one
of the family, and began to manage for her as she did for them all, from Grandfather Hicks
down to the dog Tar.

"I think, William, Miss Vogdes has the maternal instinct largely developed," looking at her
face and the shape of her head as a naturalist would at a new bug. "You could find work for
her in here," unlatching the gate of the Reformatory school. "She could serve humanity here
just as well as if she had more--more--well, we'll say stamina."

"Precisely what I thought of," cheerfully. "You've hit the nail on the head about her, Maria."
He was a peaceable, affectionate fellow at bottom. He had never hoped that his sister would
tolerate Kitty, and women's squabbles in a family he abhorred, like every other man; and here
she was extending a hospitable greeting, finding work for Kitty already. Io triumphe!

"Suppose you show Miss Vogdes the institution, sister?" he said, rubbing his eye-glasses and
putting them on again in a flutter of pleasure and cordiality.

Miss Muller nodded authoritatively, and he fell into the background.

"You'll observe, Miss Vogdes," with a laugh and shrug, "Berrytown has given its best of æsthetic
instincts here: five square stories painted white, with green shutters; pebble walks; six straight
evergreens to testify of the Beautiful. Inside--here we are! Parlor: yellow-pine floors, spotless;
green paper blinds in the windows, that hang stirless the year round. This is the kitchen:
white boards, shining caldrons. William, show the soup."

Mr. Muller gravely held up a ladleful: "Beef and cabbage. To each child we allow per diem three
parts of animal food, three purely farinaceous, four vegetable. The proper scale, I hold, of
healthful nourishment," putting back the ladle. He had not spilled a drop.

"Dining-room," continued Miss Muller: "more white boards; shining tin plates; these three hundred
little figures in blue jeans ranged against the wall are the--the patients. Now observe." Mr.
Muller rapped once, they raised their hands; twice, they clasped them; three times, they rattled
off the Lord's Prayer; the next moment they were shoveling their soup into their mouths in silence.

"Miss Vogdes does not approve their religious teaching, William. You see," turning to her,
"how they need a real motherly care. You could give it to them."

But Kitty, who perhaps did "want stamina," and who was more of a child than any before her,
made no answer. Vice and disease faced her as never before: those hundreds of hungry eyes fenced
her in.

"Are you sick?" said Mr. Muller anxiously, seeing her face. "It is the smell of the soup, perhaps.
Come out of this. Let me pass, Maria. You forget how foolishly tender her life has been: she
never probably looked at crime before. Come out to the fresh air."

"You'd better stay," said Maria coolly, aside. "These children will plead your cause with such
a girl as that better than you can do or have done, I take it. Now, my dear," putting Kitty's
hand between her own, "this is my brother's work, in which he wishes you to join him. Put it
to yourself whether it is not your duty. You're very young; you've dreamed a good deal, most
likely: this wakening to the fact that there is work in the world besides marrying and nursing
babies revolts and shocks most young girls. Yet here it is." Her voice was very gentle, and
sincere in every cadence, the words true: there lay the terrible grinding power of them. "Talk
over your future life with William, my dear. There is the matron. I must go and see about that
charge for pepper she made last month. Pepper for these children's stomachs, indeed!"

Mr. Muller drew Catharine's hand in his arm. "I did not mean to bring you here to-day," he
said, nervously mopping his face with his handkerchief. "Maria is so fond of managing! But--but
it was as my wife I wanted your help."

"My wife." Kitty was not surprised. At eighteen one reasons as the bird flies. Since she passed
the six straight evergreens yonder she had learned that life was not an old book-house, a few
sad and merry tunes, meals, and a bench to dream on. It was work--for Christ. Not far-off pagans,
but little children with sin and disease heavy upon them, asking her to take it away.

She might want stamina or any other intellectual power, but her emotions were hot and near
the surface: these children and their misery wounded and bruised her as they had never done
Mr. Muller or his sister: her sense of duty and affection for her God, too, was as real and
urgent with her as that of a dog for his master.

"Take me home now," she said quietly.

"But, Catharine--This is no answer. And my love for you is of such long standing!" pleaded
the little man, whose mouth, being once opened by his passion, found it difficult to close.
He forgot, too, the hundreds of eyes staring at him over the soup-spoons.

"Shall we go out?" said Kitty with an impatient laugh, which would not be polite. "There's
too much beef here. And cabbage."

They passed Miss Muller, who nodded down on Catharine from the heights of brusque sincerity
of the Woman's Rights people: "Come and see me, my dear. You and I shall get on very comfortably,
I dare say;" to which Kitty replied with her old-fashioned manner, which had a fine courteous
quality in it, whether it meant anything or not.

They were out in the street again. The sun was still hot and glaring. Past the new row of Morse's
blue-painted shops, down the factory alley, all along the cinder path, Mr. Muller pressed and
urged his suit. She heard every word with sharp distinctness.

The children: her work for Christ. Under all was a dull consciousness that this thing had been
coming on her since the day, years ago, when she had suffered conviction at a revival and been
converted. All His followers must give their lives to His service. Give their lives! These
were words which to the poor little girl had always been terribly real, never a hackneyed form.
Now the time had come, there was a dreadful wrenching at her heart.

"Oh, God! oh, my God! I want to do what's right!" cried Kitty silently, looking away to the
farthest horizon.

Mr. Muller remembered by this time some of his long-planned endearing speeches, and used them.
But he could not bring a blush to her cheek. She did presently look straight at him, her eye
passing quickly and critically over the neat paunchy little figure in its fashionably-cut coat
and tight-fitting trowsers. When she was a girl of ten she had fancied that Dr. Brownlee would
be her future husband--the actual Sir Guy. She would listen Sunday after Sunday to the gray-bearded
old fellow dealing the thunders of Sinai from the pulpit overhead, in a rapt delight, thinking
how sweet it would be to be guided step by step by so holy and great a man. Long after she
grew out of that, indeed only a year or two ago, she used to tremble and grow hot to her finger-tips
when young Herr Bluhm, the music-master, went by the gate. A nod of his curly bullet head or
the tramp of his sturdy cowskin boots along the road made her nerves tingle as never before.
"What was this that ailed her?" she had asked herself a dozen times a day. All Mr. Muller's
love-making did not move her now as one note of Bluhm's voluntaries on the organ had done.
She had thought him Mendelssohn and Mozart in one: the tears came now, thinking of that divine
music. But one day Mrs. Guinness had brought him in, being a phrenologist, to "feel Kitty's
head." She felt the astonished indignation yet which stunned her from his thick thumb and fore
finger as they gripped and fumbled over her head as if she had been a log of wood. But what
could poor Bluhm know of the delicate fancies about himself in her brain as he measured it,
which his heavy paws, smelling of garlic and tobacco, were putting to flight? "Philoprogenitiveness--whew!
this little girl will be fond of children, madam. Tune, time!--has no more notion of music
than a frog."

"At least," thought Catharine now, "Mr. Muller is a gentleman. I shall never feel disgust for him."

They had reached the gate now. He waited. "I shall not come in. I've confused and startled
you, Catharine. You want time to think," he said gently.

"I understand, oh, I quite understand. But I never thought of myself as your wife," she said
quietly. "It would be better you gave me time."

"Good-bye, then, my--my darling."

"Good-bye."

She stood looking over the gate, the walnut branches dark overhead, a level ray of sunlight
on her strange alluring eyes and full bosom. Mr. Muller lingered, smoothing his hat before
he put it on.

"She has not at all the intellectual power of Maria," he thought. "Maria's the sort of woman
I ought to have chosen, I suppose," being a reformer, first of all, in the very grain. But
the silly thought of holding her hand or kissing her lips came to him at the moment, and tormented
him thereafter with a feverish desire.

CHAPTER V.

Catharine stood a long time by the gate.

"Don't question the child," said Peter to her mother. He would not even look at her when she
came in, but fidgeted about, his leathery jaws red as a girl's at the thought that Kitty loved
and was beloved.

"Is supper over? I'm hungry," was all she said. They watched her furtively as she ate.

"It's prayer-meeting night, Catharine," said Mrs. Guinness when she was through, taking her
bonnet from the closet.

"I'm not going."

"Mr. Muller will miss you, my dear."

"Mr. Muller never has enough of prayer-meetings," recklessly, "but I have. I prefer going to
bed to-night;" and she went up stairs.

Before her mother was gone, however, she began to change her dress, putting on one which, when
the cape was not worn, left her shoulders and arms bare. She shook down her hair after the
fashion of a portrait in the book-shop of Kitty Clive, Peg Woffington or some other ancient
beauty more amiable than discreet. There was a delicious flavor of wickedness in the taking
out of every hairpin. Then she came down to Peter where he sat smoking.

"In the dark, father? I'll light the candles;" which she did, scolding Jane savagely between-times.
"We'll have some old plays to-night, father," bringing a book which her mother had forbidden,
and then bringing his sheepskin-lined chair up to the table. Peter eyed her furtively as he
puffed out his cigar to the last ash. On the stage or in the ball-room he had never seen, he
thought, a finer woman than Catharine; and the old man's taste in beauty or dress or wine had
been keen enough when he was a young blood on the town. He was annoyed and irritable.

"Catharine," he said sharply "bring your shawl: the night is chilly." But he read the plays
with outward good-humor, and with an inward delight and gusto, which he would not betray. All
his youth--that old Peter Guinness, for whom each day's bumpers had been frothed so high--came
back in the familiar exits and entrances. The words were innocent enough as he altered them
in reading for Kitty, though a good deal disjointed as to meaning; but she was not critical--forced
herself to take an interest in his stories of Burton and Kean, and how he first saw old Jefferson.

"I suppose," moving uneasily on her stool at his feet, "that this now is 'the world, the flesh
and the devil!' But," viciously snapping her eyes, "I like it, I like it! I wish I could think
of something else to do."

In the middle of Peter's croaking of "Poor Yarico," to show her how Catalani sang it on the
London boards, she jumped up and went to the window. People were coming home from prayer-meeting,
husbands and wives together.

"I suppose every woman must marry, father?" she said.

Peter looked doubtfully at her over his spectacles, opened his mouth and shut it once or twice.
"I judge that is the highest lot for a woman," he said slowly, "to be the wife of a good man."

"A good man? Oh yes, good enough!" and with that she flung herself down on the floor, and,
putting her head on Peter's knee, cried as if her heart would break. For Kitty was never in
the habit of carrying her pain off into solitary places: when she cried it must be with her
head on somebody's knee.

       *       *       *       *       *

This chapter of Catharine's history every wide-awake young woman among our readers has doubtless
finished for herself: she knows the closing-in process by which society, expediency, propinquity,
even moral obligations, hedge many a man and woman and drive them into marriage.

In the weeks that followed she saw but one path open to her: in it lay her work for Christ
and her woman's birthright to be a wife and mother (for Kitty, ever since she was a baby nursing
dolls, had meant to be both).

She spent most of her time shut up with her Bible and hymn-book, sometimes praying over them,
sometimes sticking in her forefinger and opening at chance verses to try her fortune about
this affair. During this time she was usually unnaturally humble and meek, but there were days
when her temper was intolerable.

"Don't come complaining to me," said Peter testily to her mother. "The child's a good child
enough. But when you force her to stretch her heart over three hundred vicious little imps,
no wonder it breaks."

"Kitty's a free agent," she replied calmly.

Kitty was a free agent, and at the end of two weeks she accepted Mr. Muller.

[TO BE CONTINUED.]

THE GLACIERS OF PARADISE.

  Spring is waking, and the Yokul lifts on high his glittering shield,
  Far and wide in sunny splendor gleams the ice-engirded field,
  And the swelling freshet murmurs gay spring-ditties as it flows,
  Till its noisy life it mingles in the ocean's grand repose;
                      And in silence,
                      Dream-fraught silence,
              O'er its course the billows close.

  On the strand they gayly played, where the trembling birch trees grow,
  Children both with golden ringlets and with cheeks like maiden snow,
  Wherein blushed fresh spring-like roses--blushed and hid, and blushed again,
  While they plucked the shining pebbles, smooth-worn by the stormy main;
                      And in silence,
                      Rippling silence,
              Chants the sea its old refrain.

  She, the fair and gladsome maiden, raised her head and called his name:
  He was deep-eyed, light and slender, shy of mien and slight of frame.
  Like a laughing brook she skippèd to and fro along the strand;
  He was grave, like nodding fern-leaf, gently by the breezes fanned,
                      Which in silence,
                      Pensive silence,
              Grows upon the brooklet's sand,

  "Ragnas," said she, "when God's angels visit will this world of ours,
  They descend, so mother told me, on the Yokul's shining towers.
  Now, if I should die, then promise thou wilt climb the peaks of ice,
  And my hand I'll reach to help thee up to God's bright paradise."
                      But in silence,
                      Wondering silence,
              Gazed he in her innocent eyes.

  It was summer: thrush and linnet sung their gladsome summer-lay;
  Through the fir trees' cooling vista rose the cataract's white spray;
  And the light blue smoke of even o'er the darksome forests fell--
  Rose and lingered like a lover loath to bid his love farewell;
                      And in silence,
                      Wistful silence,
              Shed its peace o'er sunlit dell.

  On the pleasant hillside sat they, where the silvery birches grow,
  And th' eternal sun of midnight bathed them in its fitful glow--
  She a maid of eighteen summers, fresh and fair as Norway's spring;
  Tall and dark-browed he, like pine-woods in whose gloom the Hulders[1] sing,
                      When in silence,
                      Deep-toned silence,
              Night lets droop her dusky wing.

  It was now that he must leave her, and the waves and tempest breast:
  Heavy-hearted sat they, gazing on the Yokul's flaming crest;
  And she spoke: "O Ragnas, never, while yon airy peak shall gleam
  O'er our home, shall I forget thee or our childhood's blissful dream,
                      Until silence,
                      Death and silence,
              Freeze my heart and memory's stream."

  Up he sprang, and boldly looked he toward the midnight-lighted west,
  Seized her white, soft hand and pressed it closely to his throbbing breast,
  And the love his childhood fostered, and in youth made warm his blood,
  Trembled on his lips as trembles bursting flower in freezing bud:
                      Ah, but silence,
                      Fateful silence,
              Held the mighty feeling's flood.

  Years had passed with autumn's splendor, like a glistening shower of gems;
  Doubly rich the sunlight streamèd from the Yokul's diadems;
  Once again in joyful rapture he his native vale beheld,
  For the love long years had fostered whispered still of faith unquelled,
                      Spite of silence,
                      Hapless silence,
              That the timid tongue had spelled.

  And his boat shot swiftly onward: well the rowers plied their oar,
  Till a heavy tolling reached them from the church-tower on the shore;
  And a solemn train of barges slowly wound their pensive way
  Through the hushèd waves that glittered o'er their image in the bay;
                      And the silence,
                      Listening silence,
              Dimmed the splendor of the day.

  O'er the barge that now drew nearer countless virgin lilies wept,
  Telling that some white-souled maiden in the snowy bower slept.
  Dumb he stood, and gazed in terror on the shroud and lilies sweet,
  And a dread foreboding filled him, and his heart forgot to beat;
                      And in silence,
                      Deathlike silence,
              Fell he at the boatman's feet.

  So the parish-people told me; and as years went rolling by
  Oft they saw him sadly staring on the flaming sunset sky;
  Watched the purple-stainèd Yokul, half in joy and half in pain,
  As if hoped he there to see her coming back to earth again;
                      Mourned his silence,
                      Fateful silence,
              That had rent two lives atwain.

  Till at length one Sabbath morning--deep-voiced church-bells shook the air--
  While in festal garb the church-folk wandered to their house of prayer,
  Reached their ears a hollow thunder from the glaciers overhead,
  And huge blocks of ice came crashing downward to the river's bed,
                      And in silence,
                      Wrathful silence,
              Down the seething stream they sped.

  Ah, the breathless hush that followed! for amid the icy waste
  They a human shape discernèd, madly, as by demons chased,
  Up the crystal ledges climbing, pausing now where ice-walls screen
  From the blast, then upward springing o'er abyss and dread ravine,
                      Until silence,
                      Glittering silence,
              Reigned amid the icebergs' sheen.

  They have searched for him, they told me, sought him far and sought him near:
  Ne'er a trace was found to tell them of his grave so lone and drear;
  But the legend goes that angels swift the shining ether clove,
  And with them his youth's beloved bore him up to God above,
                      Where shall silence,
                      Deepest silence,
              Never sunder hearts that love.

THACKERAY'S "GRAY FRIARS."

There is an eloquent passage in one of Victor Hugo's novels in which the writer affectionately
apostrophizes the Paris of his youth--those quaint old streets of the Quartier Latin so redolent
of the happy associations which cling to the springtide of life. Were Thackeray living now,
he would, we fancy, experience emotions very similar to those of his French confrère should
he try to find his beloved "Gray Friars," which lives enshrined in the most pathetic scene
he ever penned, and is ever and anon coming before us in the pages of his several stories.
It is but a few years since the author of Vanity Fair passed away, yet already Gray Friars'
surroundings are no longer those with which he was familiar.

Descending Holborn Hill five years ago, you found yourself, when at the foot of that celebrated
thoroughfare, at Snow Hill, just at that point where the words, "Here he is, father!" struck
upon the parental ears of Mr. Squeers as his son and heir manfully "went for" Smike. Turning
to the left, instead of proceeding up Newgate street, a circuitous street took you to Smithfield,
so long associated with stakes and steaks. Thence, when half-way through the forest of pens,
you turned sharp off to the left, and then, after another hundred yards by a turn to the right,
found yourself in a long narrow lane, called Charter-House lane. This brought you presently
to some iron gates admitting you to a quaint and not very mathematical quadrangle, such as
you would never have dreamed of stumbling upon there. This is Charter-House Square, which,
still intensely respectable, was once eminently fashionable. At one corner of it is a little
recess known as Rutland Square, for on this site once stood the abode of the dukes of that
ilk, and near to it is a stately mansion with a high pitched roof which was in days long gone
the residence of the Venetian ambassador. A garden occupies the centre of the square. Everything
is neat, orderly and severely dull, the most dissipated tenants of the square being boarding-house
keepers of a highly sedate description. The secret of all this tremendous respectability is
to be found in the contiguity to the Charter-House itself, a portion of whose buildings abut
on the square, which, with many of the streets adjoining, belongs to this wealthy institution.
Four years ago the place was so secluded that a stranger to London might have walked around
the spot a dozen times without suspecting its existence, and living in one of its comfortable
old mansions supposed himself in the cathedral close of a provincial city. The entrance to
the Charter-House itself is under an archway through venerable oaken portals, which are said--and
there seems no reason to question the statement--to be the identical gates of the monastery
which occupied the ground in the time of Henry VIII. This monastery had been a religious house
of the Carthusians.[2] The order first came to England in 1180, and was seated at a place called
Witham Priory[3] in Somersetshire, to this day known as Charter-House Witham. There Henry II.
founded and endowed a monastery. The London branch of the establishment at Witham was founded
by Sir Walter de Manni, seigneur de Manni in Cambrai, France, who was made a knight of the
Garter by Edward III., in reward for gallant services. Manni founded the house in pious commemoration
of a decimating pestilence, on which occasion not fewer than fifty thousand persons are said
to have been buried within the thirteen acres which he bought and enclosed, and a gentle eminence
known as the "hill" in the play-ground, separating what was called "Upper Green" from "Under
Green," is said to owe its shape to the thousands of bodies buried there. Manni died in 1371:
his funeral was conducted with the utmost pomp, and attended by the king and the princes of
the blood.

A hundred and fifty years rolled on without aught very momentous to interrupt the daily routine
of the monks of Charter-House, who, had there not been a woman in the case, might possibly
be the occupants of the ground to this day. When, however, Henry's fancy for Anne Boleyn led
him to look with favor on the Reformation, the Charter-House, in common with other such establishments,
came in for an ample share of Thomas Cromwell's scrutinizing inquiries. And a sad fate its
occupants had. Required to take the oath of allegiance to Henry VIII., they refused.

On the 4th of May, 1535, Haughton was executed with all the horrors attending the punishment
of death for high treason in those barbarous times. He and his companions, certain monks of
Sion Priory, died without a murmur, and Haughton's arm was hung up under the archway of the
Charter-House beneath which the visitor drives to-day, to awe his brethren. The remnant never
gave in. Some were executed; ten died of filth and fever in Newgate; and thus the noblest band
of monks in the country was broken up by Henry's ruthless hand.

The Charter-House was then granted to two men, by name Bridges and Hall, for their lives, after
which it was bestowed in 1545 on Sir E. North. North's son sold it to the duke of Norfolk,
who resided there, on and off, until decapitated in 1572. The duke was beheaded by Elizabeth
for intriguing with Mary queen of Scots, and the papers proving his offence are said to have
been found concealed beneath the roof of the stately mansion he had erected for himself at
the Charter-House.

Before the duke came to grief that most erratic of sovereigns was a visitor at his house--as
indeed where was she not?--coming thence from Hampton Court in 1568, and remaining a day with
him; and when her successor, James I., came to take up her English sceptre, he, mindful of
what the Howards had suffered for their sympathy with his mother's cause, came straight thither
from Theobalds, his halting-place next to London, and remained on a visit of four days.

From the duke of Norfolk the Charter-House passed to his eldest son by his second wife, Lord
Thomas Howard, who was created by James I. earl of Suffolk;[4] and he about 1609 sold it to
Mr. Thomas Sutton.

Sutton's career was remarkable. It was said of the late earl of Derby that even had he been
born in a shepherd's cot on Salisbury Plain, instead of in the purple at Knowsley, he would
still have proved himself a remarkable man. In local phraseology, he was "bound to get on,"
and so was Thomas Sutton. The son of a country gentleman at a place called Knaith in Lincolnshire,
he inherited early in life a good property from his father, and spent some time in traveling
abroad. Then he became attached to the household of the duke of Norfolk, probably as surveyor
and manager of that great peer's vast estates, and in 1569, when a serious disturbance broke
out in the north of England, he repaired thither, and greatly distinguished himself in aiding
to quell it. He then received the appointment of master-general of ordnance for the North for life.

Whilst in the North he found another mode of making hay whilst the sun shone. Soon after his
arrival he bought a lease of the bishop of Durham of the manors of Gateshead and Wickham, and
worked the collieries on these properties to such good purpose that, on coming up to London
in 1580 he brought with him two horse-loads of money, and was reputed to be worth fifty thousand
pounds--a great sum in those days.

About 1582 he increased his wealth by marriage, and commenced business as a merchant in London.
His large amount of ready money--a commodity especially scarce in those days--soon enabled
him to carry on very large commercial operations; and amongst other sources of wealth he probably
derived considerable profit from his office of victualer of the navy. In 1590, finding himself
without prospect of children, he withdrew from business, and retired to the country, having
already invested largely in real estate. Although very frugal, there are sufficient evidences
of his liberality to the poor on his property; and it seems not improbable that his charitable
schemes now began to take definite form, for after his death a credible witness stated that
Sutton was in the habit of repairing to a summer-house in his garden for private devotion,
and on one of these occasions he heard him utter the words: "Lord, Thou hast given me a large
and liberal estate: give me also a heart to make use thereof."

About 1608, when he had quite retired from the world, he was greatly exercised by a rumor that
he was to be raised to the peerage--an honor which it was contemplated to bestow with the understanding
that he would make Prince Charles, subsequently Charles I., his heir. This was a court intrigue
to get his money, but an urgent appeal to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere and the earl of Salisbury,
prime minister, appears to have put an end to trouble in the matter. He died on the 12th of
December, 1611, at the age of seventy-nine, leaving immense wealth, and on the 12th of December,
1614, his body was brought on the shoulders of his pensioners to Charter-House Chapel, and
interred in a vault ready for it there, beneath the huge monument erected to his memory. Perhaps
he consulted "Jingling Geordie," then planning his own singular scheme,[7] on the point, and
got him to persuade the king, always vain of his scholarship, that it would well become him
to become patron of an institution having for one of its main objects the education of youth
in sound learning. Be this as it may, the fact is certain that a degree of royal and other
powerful protection was somehow secured for the institution which for all time prevented its
funds from being diverted to other purposes.

Sutton's bequest of the bulk of his estate to charitable uses was not unnaturally viewed with
strong disapprobation by his nephew, one Simon Baxter, for whom he had, however, not neglected
to provide, who brought a suit to set aside the will. However, notwithstanding that he had
Bacon for his counsel, he failed to interfere with his uncle's disposition of his estate; the
court holding that the claims of kinship had been sufficiently recognized.[8]

In the same year, 1614, the institution opened. The rules and orders for its government may
yet be seen, bearing the autograph signature of Charles I., then prince of Wales. From that
time almost every man in the country, of the first rank of eminence by birth or fortune, has
been a governor, and the name of Cromwell may be seen not far from that of Charles on the roll.
Up to about 1850 the patronage was vested exclusively in the governors. Amongst these were
always included--though not necessarily--the sovereign, the archbishop of Canterbury and the
bishop of London. The remainder were men eminent in Church or State, "the master of the hospital,"[9]
who must not be confounded with the school-master, being the only official member. The sovereign
had two nominations to the other governors' one.

A boy on the foundation received his education entirely free. Whilst within the walls he was
clothed in black cloth at the expense of the house, and even had shirts and shoes provided
for him. His only expenses were a fee to the matron of twenty-five dollars a year, and the
cost of books, stationery, etc., the whole amounting to a sum less than one hundred dollars
a year. On leaving school for college he received an allowance--four hundred dollars for three
years, and five hundred dollars for the fourth.

There may have been a time when much of the patronage was improperly bestowed, but this certainly
was not the case in our day. The majority of the boys on the foundation were the sons of well-born
and often distinguished gentlemen of small means, and the sort of perversion of patronage to
which Thackeray alludes had ceased to take place. When some of the places on the foundation
were thrown open, it was a subject of general remark that several of the boys who got scholarships
were those whose parents could perfectly have afforded to give them a first-class education.

Probably there will some day be a reaction in England in this matter. The prevalent present
plan is to give every advantage to the clever boy (which means a boy who has a faculty for
acquirement, but often lacks those qualities most needed to make him a valuable citizen), and
to let those who are not so bright at book-learning, and need every aid, scramble along as
they can. It was certainly not the system which Sutton designed, and there are not a few who,
without being by any means bigoted conservatives, consider that the utter indifference displayed
of late years to the intentions of founders is quite unjustifiable, and offers little encouragement
to those who would be disposed to make similar bequests.

At Oxford, for instance, nearly every scholarship is now thrown open to general competition.
This sounds very fine, but is in utter disregard of the fact that the founder in most instances
was induced to bequeath his money with the view that those who came from the part of the country
to which he himself belonged should benefit. Of course, time had rendered necessary certain
changes, but these have been sweeping to a degree which is inconsistent with a due regard to
the wills of the dead, and meanwhile no one seems disposed to admit that the public schools
or universities turn out men one whit better than in days gone by, or indeed do more for the
general education of the people.

Recently a sweeping change has been made at the Charter-House, which had seemed to be almost
proof against innovation. So far as nominating boys to the foundation, the governors' patronage
will, after one more term apiece, be at an end, and the privilege of participating in Button's
benefits will be open to all boys who have been for some months members of the school, and
are clever enough to beat their fellows in competition. The governors reserve, however, their
right of nominating aged or disabled men, whose number now, we believe, amounts to one hundred.

A school-day at Charter-House began at eight, with what we called "first school." Prayers,
lasting about five minutes, took place in the large school-room. These were read by a "gown-boy"
monitor. The lessons at first school consisted entirely of repetition--repeating Latin poetry,
and occasionally prose. As each boy finished his repetition--the boys being taken up in the
order in which they were numbered the previous day--he left the school and went to breakfast.
Breakfast consisted of an almost unlimited supply of hot rolls and butter and milk, but this
was supplemented in the case of almost every boy by edibles purchased with his pocket-money.
For those who had the privilege of fagging this was recognized and allowed, and in regard to
the rest it was connived at, and marmalades, potted meats and such-like relishes freely circulated,
being supplied for the most part by the servants, who drove a lively trade in such comestibles.

Toasting was brought to the very highest perfection. Never before or since have we tasted anything
of its kind so good as a buttered roll toasted. It was a French roll buttered all over outside,
and then skillfully grilled until the outside was a rich crisp brown. This was brought by the
fag to his master "hot and hot," and, being cut open, eaten with butter. The rooms were warmed
by immense open fireplaces, there being no limit to the expenditure of coal, which was prodigious.

In our time (1847-1853) there was an immense deal of fagging, which has been, we believe very
properly, much diminished. Under boys were called in to perform many menial offices which should
have been done by servants. The task-work which by "gown-boys" was most disliked was what was
called being basonite. This duty devolved upon the twelve junior boys occupying what was known
as "the under bedroom." To this hour we recall with horror how on a gloomy, foggy, wintry Monday
morning we remembered on waking that it was our basonite week--for a fresh set of three went
to work each Monday morning--and that we must get up and call the monitors. This basonite duty
consisted of the most elaborate valeting. Each monitor's clothes were brushed, warm water was
fetched and poured out for him, and everything so arranged that he might lie in bed up to the
last possible moment, and then one small boy being ready with his coat, another with his waistcoat,
and a third with his cap--be able to dress in five minutes and rush into school. At midday,
when the monitors washed their hands for dinner, similar work had to be done, and again in
the evening, when they washed their hands for supper. The only set-off to all this was that
each monitor had been a basonite, and each basonite had a very good chance of becoming a monitor.
But it was carrying the fagging system to far too great an extent, and the practice is now
greatly modified.

The domestic arrangements were in many respects rough and comfortless, and so intensely conservative
were the ruling powers in these respects that complaint or remonstrance scarcely received any
attention. On the other hand, the utmost liberality prevailed in most matters. The foundation
scholars' dinner, for instance, was provided in a long, low, old-fashioned, oak-paneled hall,
admirably adapted for the purpose. The food was excellent in quality, unlimited in quantity,
and very comfortably served. The only drawback was want of variety, and the perennial reappearance
of raspberry tartlets every Wednesday at length provoked a mutiny against that form of pastry,
the order being passed down that no one was to touch it.

An upper boy had two fags, the inferior of the two being called his tea-fag. A good feeling
nearly always subsisted between master and fag, inasmuch as the former generally selected a
boy he liked; and indeed in many cases the connection engendered a warm and lasting regard
between the parties. The fag had access to his master's study, could retreat there to do his
lessons in quiet, and not unfrequently was assisted in them by his master.

Those who came off worst were dirty boys: no mercy was shown them. One such we can recall--now
a very spruce, well-appointed government official--whose obstinate adherence to dirt was marvelous,
seeing what it cost him.

There are always some bullies among a lot of boys, but serious bullying was uncommon, and not
unfrequently a hideous retribution befell a bully through some "big fellow" resolving to wreak
on him what he inflicted on others. We can recall one very bright, brilliant youth, now high
in the Indian civil service, whose drollery when bullying was irresistible, even to those who
knew their turn might come next. "Come here, F----," we remember his saying to a fat youth
of reputed uncleanness: then dropping his voice to a tone of subdued horror and solemnity,
"I was shocked to hear you use a bad word just now." "No indeed, B----," protested the trembling
F----. "Ah, well, I'm certain that you are now thinking it; and, besides, at any rate, you
look fat and disgusting; so hold down your hands;" and poor F---- retired howling after a tremendous
"swinger"--i.e. swinging box on the ear.

The school was divided into six forms, the sixth being the highest. Below the first form were
two classes called upper and lower petties. Up to 1850, classics were the almost exclusive
study, but the changes then made in the curriculum of studies at Oxford rendered attention
to mathematics absolutely necessary. Much less stress was laid upon Latin verses at Charter-House
than at Eton, and a Latin prose composition was regarded as the most important part of scholarship,
inasmuch as a certain proficiency in it is a sine qua non at Oxford. French was taught twice
a week by a master of celebrity, who, however, did not understand the art of dinning learning
into unwilling boys. It rarely happens in England that boys acquire any real knowledge of French
at school: those who gain the prizes are almost invariably boys who have resided abroad and
picked up the language in childhood. Music was taught by Mr. Hullah, and attendance on the
part of gown-boys was compulsory. Drawing and fencing were extras.

Very great importance was attached to the annual examination, which was conducted by examiners
specially appointed by the governors. The result, which was kept a close secret until "Prize
Saturday," was as eagerly looked forward to as the Derby by a betting man. The different forms
were divided into classes, as at Oxford, according to merit, and the names printed along with
the examination papers in pamphlet form. After this examination boys went up to the form above
them, each boy usually remaining a year in each form. The system of punishment was as follows.
A book called the "Black Book" was kept by the school monitor of the week, there being four
gown-boy--that is, foundation--monitors who took the duty of school monitor in rotation. A
boy put down for three offences during the same week was flogged, but the end of each week
cleared off old scores. The entries were in this wise:

  Name of Boy.    Offence.          By whom put down.
  Robinson 1        Idle                Dr. Saunders.
  Smith 1, 2        Talking in School   Mr. Curtis.

"Go and put your name down," a master would say. "Oh please, sir, I'm down twice." "Then put
it down a third time." Then would follow entreaties, which, unless the delinquent had been
previously privately marked down for execution, would probably avail. When a flogging offence
was committed a boy was put down thus:

  Robinson 1, 2, 3   Impertinent        Mr. ----.

The flogging varied much in severity according to the crime. The process was precisely the
same as at Eton. Partially denuded of his nether garments, the victim knelt upon the block,
the monitor standing at his head. The birches were kept in a long box which served as a settee,
and were furnished periodically by the man who brought the fire fagots. Now and again the box
would, by the carelessness of the functionary called "the school-groom," be left open, and
it was then considered a point of honor on the part of an under boy to promptly avail himself
of the opportunity to "skin" the rods--i.e. draw them through a piece of stuff in such a way
as to take the buds off, after which they hurt very much less.

Serious offences, such as insubordination and gross disobedience, were punished by a flogging
with two birches, which was too severe a punishment. The degree of pain varied very much according
to the delicacy of skin, and no doubt some boys--one of our comrades had been flogged about
twenty-five times--did not feel much after many floggings, becoming literally case-hardened;
whereas, we have known a boy compelled to stay in bed two or three days from the effects of
a flogging which would have left little mark upon the "twenty-fiver." When a victim issued
from the flogging-room the questions from an eager throng were, "How many cuts, old fellow?
Did it take much? You howled like the devil!"[10]

The monitors were furnished with small canes, which they were permitted to use with moderation,
but nothing like the horrible process of "tunding," as at Winchester, was known. The theory
of entrusting this power to monitors is, that if you do not give certain boys the right to
punish, might will be right, whilst the monitors, being duly made to feel their responsibility,
will only punish where punishment is properly due, and will serve as a protection to the weak.

There was a half-holiday every Wednesday and Saturday. Every Saturday upper boys who had friends
might go out from Saturday till Sunday night, and lower boys were allowed to do the same every
other Saturday. These events were of course greatly looked forward to from week to week. Not
the least agreeable feature was the probable addition to pocket-money, for in England it is
the custom to "tip" school-boys, and we have ourselves come back joyous on a Sunday evening
with six sovereigns chinking in our pockets. Alas, no one tips us now! Then there was the delight
of comparing notes of the doings during the delightful preceding twenty-four hours. Thus, whilst
Brown detailed the delights of the pantomime to which Uncle John had taken him on Saturday
night, Robinson descanted on the marvels of the Zoological Gardens, with special reference
to the free-and-easy life of monkeydom, and Smith never wearied of enlarging on the terrors
and glories of the Tower of London. Altogether, there were fourteen weeks' holiday in the year--six
weeks in August, five at Christmas and three at Whitsuntide, with two days at Easter.

There were several beds in each bedroom, and there was a very strict rule that the most perfect
order should prevail--in fact, lower boys were forbidden to talk; but talk they always did,
and long stories, often protracted for nights, were told; and for our part, we must confess
that we have never enjoyed any fictions more than those.

Evening prayers took place in the several houses at nine, after which the lower boys went to
bed. A junior master--there was one to each house--always attended at prayers, which were read
by a monitor. Before prayers names were called over and every boy accounted for.

Although in the midst of brick and mortar, two large spaces, containing several acres, were
available for cricket, whilst foot-ball--and very fierce games of it, too--was usually played
in the curious old cloisters of the Chartreuse monks which opened on "Upper Green." The grass-plot
of Upper Green was kept sacred from the feet of under boys except in "cricket quarter," as
the summer quarter was termed. It was rolled, watered and attended to with an assiduity such
as befalls few spots of ground in the world. The roof of the cloisters was a terrace flagged
with stone, and on the occasion of cricket-matches a gay bevy of ladies assembled here to look
at the exploits of the young Rawdon Crawleys and Pendennises of the day. Immediately opposite
the terrace, across the green, on the immensely high blank wall, was the word "Crown" rudely
painted, and above it what was intended as a representation of that sign of sovereignty. This
had a history. It was said to have been written there originally by "the bold and strong-minded
Law," commemorated by Macaulay in his Warren Hastings article, who became Lord Ellenborough,
and the last lord chief-justice who had the honor of a seat in the cabinet. It was probably
put up originally as a goal for boys running races, and for nearly a century was regularly
repainted as commemorative of a famous alumnus who was so fondly attached to the place of his
early education that he desired to be buried in its chapel, and an imposing monument to his
memory may be seen on its walls. Between Upper and Under Greens, on the slight eminence to
which we have alluded, stood "School," a large ugly edifice of brick mounted with stone, which
derived an interest in the eyes of those educated there from the fact that the names of hundreds
of old Carthusians were engraven on its face; for it was the custom of boys leaving school
to have their names bracketed with those of friends; and when Brown took his departure his
name was duly cut, with a space left for Robinson's name when the time of his departure came.

These stones have now exchanged the murky air of London for that of one of the pleasantest
sites in Surrey. Charter-House School has, after passing two hundred and sixty years in the
metropolis, changed its location, and must be looked for now on a delightful spot near Godalming
in Surrey. The governors very wisely determined about five years ago that boys were much better
in country than in town, and, having ample funds, took measures accordingly. Last October the
new buildings were ready for the boys' reception, and they met there for the first time. The
stones, however, were, with a sentiment most will appreciate, removed, in order to connect
the past with the present, for the Charter-House must ever have many tender ties binding it
to the site of the old monastery with its rich historic memories; and however famous may be
the men who go forth from the new ground which Sutton's famous foundation occupies, it must
derive a great part of its fame for a long time to come from the place which sent out into
the world Addison, Steele, Thirlwall, Grote, Leech and Thackeray, not to mention a host of
names of those who in arms and arts have done credit to the place of their education.[11]

The home for aged and infirm or disabled men will remain where it has always been. This establishment
has indeed been a welcome refuge to thousands who have known better days. Men of all ranks
and conditions, who have experienced in the afternoon of life contrary winds too powerful for
them to encounter, have here found a haven for the remnant of their days. Some have held most
important positions, and a lord mayor of London, who had received emperors at his table, was
a few years ago one of Sutton's "poor brethren." The pensioners were always called cods by
the boys, probably short for codgers. Each had a room plainly furnished, about one hundred
and fifty dollars a year, rations, and a dinner every day in the great hall. The boys, who
did not often know their names, gave them nicknames by which they became generally known. Thus
three were called "Battle," "Murder" and "Sudden Death;" another "Larky," in consequence of
a certain levity of demeanor at divine service. These old gentlemen were expected to attend
chapel daily. Every evening at nine o'clock the chapel bell tolled the exact number of them,
just as Great Tom at Christ Church, Oxford, nightly rings out the number of the students. Being
for the most part aged men, soured by misfortune and failure, they are naturally enough often
hard to please and difficult to deal with.

AN OLD "GOWN-BOY."

[Footnote 2: The original seat of the Carthusian order was at Chartreux in Dauphiny, where
it was founded by Saint Bruno.]

[Footnote 3: Witham, which is not far from Fonthill, became in 1763 the property of Alderman
Beckford, the millionaire father of the celebrated author of Vathek.]

[Footnote 4: Lord Suffolk probably applied the purchase-money (thirteen thousand pounds) to
help build the palace, called Audley End or Inn, he raised in Essex. It stands on abbey-land
granted by Henry VIII. to his wife's father, Lord Audley of Walden, near Saffron-Walden in
Essex, and was generally regarded as the most magnificent structure of its period, although
Evelyn gives the preference to Clarendon House, that grand mansion of the chancellor's which
provoked so much jealousy against him, and came to be called Dunkirk House, from the insinuation
that it was built out of the funds paid by the French for Dunkirk. Abbey-lands are supposed
by many to carry ill-luck with them, and quickly to change hands. Audley End has proved no
exception to this hypothetical fate. Only a portion of it now remains, but this, though much
marred by injudicious alterations, is amply sufficient to show how grand it was. It has long
since passed out of the hands of the Howards, and now belongs to Lord Braybrooke, whose family
name is Nevill. A relation of his, a former peer of the name, edited the best edition of Pepys'
Diary, in which and in Evelyn is frequent reference to Audley End.]

[Footnote 5: The order of proceedings was subsequently inverted.]

[Footnote 6: The Newcomers: "Founder's Day at Gray Friars." On one of the last Founder's Days
of his life Thackeray came with a friend early in the day, and scattered half sovereigns to
the little gown-boys in "Gown-boys' Hall."]

[Footnote 7: Heriot's Hospital at Edinburgh.]

[Footnote 8: Simon Baxter was his only sister's son. Sutton had left him an estate which in
1615 he sold to the ancestor of the present earl of Sefton for fifteen thousand pounds--equal
to about seventy-five thousand pounds now--and a legacy of three hundred pounds.]

[Footnote 9: This was a post which Thackeray coveted, and had he lived might possibly have
filled. The master's lodge, a spacious antique residence, lined with portraits of governors
in their robes of estate, by Lely, Kneller, etc., would in his hands have become a resort of
rare interest and hospitality.]

[Footnote 10: In what is known as "The Charter-House Play," which describes some boyish orgies
and their subsequent punishment, the latter is described in the pathetic lines:

  Now the victim low is bending,
  Now the fearful rod descending,
  Hark a blow! Again, again
  Sounds the instrument of pain.

  Goddess of mercy! oh impart
  Thy kindness to the doctor's heart:
  Bid him words of pardon say--
  Cast the blood-stained scourge away.

  In vain, in vain! he will not hear:
  Mercy is a stranger there.
  Justice, unrelenting dame,
  First asserts her lawful claim.

  This is aye her maxim true:
  "They who sin must suffer too."
  When of fun we've had our fill,
  Justice then sends in her bill,
  And as soon as we have read it,
  Pay we must: she gives no credit.

There is some rather fine doggerel too, in which the doctor--the Dr. Portman Pendennis--apostrophizes
a monitor in whom he had believed, but finds to have been as bad as the rest. The Doctor (with
voice indicative of tears and indignation):

  Oh, Simon Steady! Simon Steady, oh!
  What would your father say to see you so?--
  You whom I always trusted, whom I deemed
  As really good and honest as you seemed.

  Are you the leader of this lawless throng,
  The chief of all that's dissolute and wrong?

Then with awful emphasis:

  Bad is the drunkard, shameless is the youth
  Who dares desert the sacred paths of truth;
  But he who hides himself 'neath Virtue's pall,
  The painted hypocrite, is worse than all!

In acting this play the manner of the real doctor (Mr. Gladstone's old tutor, now dean of Peterborough)
was often imitated to the life, which of course brought down the house.]

[Footnote 11: In his curious London and the Country, Carbonadoed and Quartered into severall
Characters (1632), Lupton writes under the head of

  "CHARTER-HOUSE.

"This place is well described by three things--magnificence, munificence and religious government.
The first shows the wealth of the founder; the second, the means to make the good thing done
durable; the third demonstrates his intent that thus established it.... This one place hath
sent many a famous member to the universities, and not a few to the wars.

ROMANCE-TIME.

Early morning at Borva, fresh, luminous and rare; the mountains in the south grown pale and
cloud-like under a sapphire sky; the sea ruffled into a darker blue by a light breeze from
the west: and the sunlight lying hot on the red gravel and white shells around Mackenzie's
house. There is an odor of sweetbrier about, hovering in the warm, still air, except at such
times as the breeze freshens a bit, and brings round the shoulder of the hill the cold, strange
scent of the rocks and the sea beyond.

And on this fresh and pleasant morning Sheila sat in the big garden seat in front of the house,
talking to the stranger to whom she had been introduced the day before. He was no more a stranger,
however, to all appearance, for what could be more frank and friendly than their conversation,
or more bright and winning than the smile with which she frequently turned to speak or to listen?
Of course this stranger could not be her friend as Mr. Ingram was--that was impossible. But
he talked a great deal more than Mr. Ingram, and was apparently more anxious to please and
be pleased; and indeed was altogether very winning and courteous and pleasant in his ways.
Beyond this vague impression, Sheila ventured upon no further comparison between the two men.
If her older friend had been down, she would doubtless have preferred talking to him about
all that had happened in the island since his last visit; but here was this newer friend thrown,
as it were, upon her hospitality, and eager, with a most respectful and yet simple and friendly
interest, to be taught all that Ingram already knew. Was he not, too, in mere appearance like
one of the princes she had read of in many an ancient ballad--tall and handsome and yellow-haired,
fit to have come sailing over the sea, with a dozen merry comrades, to carry off some sea-king's
daughter to be his bride? Sheila began to regret that the young man knew so little about the
sea and the northern islands and those old-time stories; but then he was very anxious to learn.

"You must say Mach-Klyoda instead of Macleod," she was saying to him, "if you like Styornoway
better than Stornoway. It is the Gaelic, that is all."

"Oh, it is ever so much prettier," said young Lavender with a quite genuine enthusiasm in his
face, not altogether begotten of the letter y; "and indeed I don't think you can possibly tell
how singularly pleasant and quaint it is to an English ear to hear just that little softening
of the vowels that the people have here. I suppose you don't notice that they say gyarden for
garden--"

"They!" As if he had paid attention to the pronunciation of any one except Sheila herself!

"--but not quite so hard as I pronounce it. And so with a great many other words, that are
softened and sweetened, and made almost poetical in their sound by the least bit of inflection.
How surprised and pleased English ladies would be to hear you speak! Oh, I beg your pardon--I
did not mean to--I--I beg your pardon--"

Sheila seemed a little astonished by her companion's evident mortification, and said with a
smile, "If others speak so in the island, of course I must too; and you say it does not shock you."

His distress at his own rudeness now found an easy vent. He protested that no people could
talk English like the people of Lewis. He gave Sheila to understand that the speech of English
folks was as the croaking of ravens compared with the sweet tones of the northern isles; and
this drew him on to speak of his friends in the South and of London, and of the chances of
Sheila ever going thither.

"It must be so strange never to have seen London," he said. "Don't you ever dream of what it
is like? Don't you ever try to think of a great space, nearly as big as this island, all covered
over with large houses, the roads between the houses all made of stone, and great bridges going
over the rivers, with railway-trains standing? By the way, you have never seen a railway-engine!"

He looked at her for a moment in astonishment, as if he had not hitherto realized to himself
the absolute ignorance of the remote princess. Sheila, with some little touch of humor appearing
in her calm eyes, said, "But I am not quite ignorant of all these things. I have seen pictures
of them, and my papa has described them to me so often that I will feel as if I had seen them
all; and I do not think I should be surprised, except, perhaps, by the noise of the big towns.
It was many a time my papa told me of that; but he says I cannot understand it, nor the great
distance of land you travel over to get to London. That is what I do not wish to see. I was
often thinking of it, and that to pass so many places that you do not know would make you very
sad."

"That can be easily avoided," he said lightly. "When you go to London, you must go from Glasgow
or Edinburgh in a night-train, and fall fast asleep, and in the morning you will find yourself
in London, without having seen anything."

"Just as if one had gone across a great distance of sea, and come to another island you will
never see before," said Sheila, with the gray-blue eyes under the black eyelashes grown strange
and distant.

"But you must not think of it as a melancholy thing," he said, almost anxiously. "You will
find yourself among all sorts of gayeties and amusements; you will have cheerful people around
you, and plenty of things to see; you will drive in beautiful parks, and go to theatres, and
meet people in large and brilliant rooms, filled with flowers and silver and light. And all
through the winter, that must be so cold and dark up here, you will find abundance of warmth
and light, and plenty of flowers, and every sort of pleasant thing. You will hear no more of
those songs of drowned people; and you will be afraid no longer of the storms, or listen to
the waves at night; and by and by, when you have got quite accustomed to London, and got a
great many friends, you might be disposed to stay there altogether; and you would grow to think
of this island as a desolate and melancholy place, and never seek to come back."

The girl rose suddenly and turned to a fuchsia tree, pretending to pick some of its flowers.
Tears had sprung to her eyes unbidden, and it was in rather an uncertain voice that she said,
still managing to conceal her face, "I like to hear you talk of those places, but--but I will
never leave Borva."

What possible interest could he have in combating this decision so anxiously, almost so imploringly?
He renewed his complaints against the melancholy of the sea and the dreariness of the northern
winters. He described again and again the brilliant lights and colors of town-life in the South.
As a mere matter of experience and education she ought to go to London; and had not her papa
as good as intimated his intention of taking her?

In the midst of these representations a step was heard in the hall, and then the girl looked
round with a bright light on her face.

"Well, Sheila?" said Ingram, according to his custom, and both the girl's hands were in his
the next minute. "You are down early. What have you been about? Have you been telling Mr. Lavender
of the Black Horse of Loch Suainabhal?"

"No: Mr. Lavender has been telling me of London."

"And I have been trying to induce Miss Mackenzie to pay us a visit, so that we may show her
the difference between a city and an island. But all to no purpose. Miss Mackenzie seems to
like hard winters and darkness and cold; and as for that perpetual and melancholy and cruel
sea, that in the winter-time I should fancy might drive anybody into a lunatic asylum--"

"Ah, you must not talk badly of the sea," said the girl, with all her courage and brightness
returned to her face: "it is our very good friend. It gives us food, and keeps many people
alive. It carries the lads away to other places, and brings them back with money in their pockets--"

"And sometimes it smashes a few of them on the rocks, or swallows up a dozen families, and
the next morning it is as smooth and treacherous and fair as if nothing had happened."

"But that is not the sea at all," said Sheila: "that is the storms that will wreck the boats;
and how can the sea help that? When the sea is let alone the sea is very good to us."

Ingram laughed aloud and patted the girl's head fondly; and Lavender, blushing a little, confessed
he was beaten, and that he would never again, in Miss Mackenzie's presence, say anything against
the sea.

The King of Borva now appearing, they all went in to breakfast; and Sheila sat opposite the
window, so that all the light coming in from the clear sky and the sea was reflected upon her
face, and lit up every varying expression that crossed it or that shone up in the beautiful
deeps of her eyes. Lavender, his own face in shadow, could look at her from time to time, himself
unseen; and as he sat in almost absolute silence, and noticed how she talked with Ingram, and
what deference she paid him, and how anxious she was to please him, he began to wonder if he
should ever be admitted to a like friendship with her. It was so strange, too, that this handsome,
proud-featured, proud-spirited girl should so devote herself to the amusement of a man like
Ingram, and, forgetting all the court that should have been paid to a pretty woman, seem determined
to persuade him that he was conferring a favor upon her by every word and look. Of course,
Lavender admitted to himself, Ingram was a very good sort of fellow--a very good sort of fellow
indeed. If any one was in a scrape about money, Ingram would come to the rescue without a moment's
hesitation, although the salary of a clerk in the Board of Trade might have been made the excuse,
by any other man, for a very justifiable refusal. He was very clever too--had read much, and
all that kind of thing. But he was not the sort of man you might expect to get on well with
women. Unless with very intimate friends, he was a trifle silent and reserved. Often he was
inclined to be pragmatic and sententious, and had a habit of saying unpleasantly bitter things
when some careless joke was being made. He was a little dingy in appearance; and a man who
had a somewhat cold manner, who was sallow of face, who was obviously getting gray, and who
was generally insignificant in appearance, was not the sort of man, one would think, to fascinate
an exceptionally handsome girl, who had brains enough to know the fineness of her own face.
But here was this princess paying attentions to him such as must have driven a more impressionable
man out of his senses, while Ingram sat quiet and pleased, sometimes making fun of her, and
generally talking to her as if she were a child. Sheila had chatted very pleasantly with him,
Lavender, in the morning, but it was evident that her relations with Ingram were of a very
different kind, such as he could not well understand. For it was scarcely possible that she
could be in love with Ingram, and yet surely the pleasure that dwelt in her expressive face
when she spoke to him or listened to him was not the result of a mere friendship.

If Lavender had been told at that moment that these two were lovers, and that they were looking
forward to an early marriage, he would have rejoiced with an enthusiasm of joy. He would have
honestly and cordially shaken Ingram by the hand; he would have made plans for introducing
the young bride to all the people he knew; and he would have gone straight off, on reaching
London, to buy Sheila a diamond necklace even if he had to borrow the money from Ingram himself.

"And have you got rid yet of the Airgiod-cearc[12] Sheila?" said Ingram, suddenly breaking
in upon these dreams; "or does every owner of hens still pay his annual shilling to the Lord
of Lewis?"

"It is not away yet," said the girl, "but when Sir James comes in the autumn I will go over
to Stornoway and ask him to take away the tax; and I know he will do it, for what is the shilling
worth to him, when he has spent thousands and thousands of pounds on the Lewis? But it will
be very hard on some of the poor people that only keep one or two hens; and I will tell Sir
James of all that--"

"You will do nothing of the kind, Sheila," said her father impatiently. "What is the Airgiod-cearc
to you, that you will go over to Stornoway only to be laughed at and make a fool of yourself?"

"That is nothing, not anything at all," said the girl, "if Sir James will only take away the tax."

"Why, Sheila, they would treat you as another Lady Godiva!" said Ingram, with a good-humored smile.

"But Miss Mackenzie is quite right," exclaimed Lavender, with a sudden flush of color leaping
into his handsome face and an honest glow of admiration into his eyes. "I think it is a very
noble thing for her to do, and nobody, either in Stornoway or anywhere else, would be such
a brute as to laugh at her for trying to help those poor people, who have not too many friends
and defenders, God knows!"

Ingram looked surprised. Since when had the young gentleman across the table acquired such
a singular interest in the poorer classes, of whose very existence he had for the most part
seemed unaware? But the enthusiasm in his face was quite honest: there could be no doubt of
that. As for Sheila, with a beating heart she ventured to send to her champion a brief and
timid glance of gratitude, which the young man observed, and never forgot.

"You will not know what it is all about," said the King of Borva with a peevish air, as though
it were too bad that a person of his authority should have to descend to petty details about
a hen-tax. "It is many and many a tax and a due Sir James will take away from his tenants in
the Lewis, and he will spend more money a thousand times than ever he will get back; and it
was this Airgiod-cearc, it will stand in the place of a great many other things taken away,
just to remind the folk that they have not their land all in their own right. It is many things
you will have to do in managing the poor people, not to let them get too proud, or forgetful
of what they owe to you; and now there is no more tacksmen to be the masters of the small crofters,
and the crofters they would think they were landlords themselves if there were no dues for
them to pay."

"I have heard of those middlemen: they were dreadful tyrants and thieves, weren't they?" said
Lavender. Ingram kicked his foot under the table. "I mean, that was the popular impression
of them--a vulgar error, I presume," continued the young man in the coolest manner. "And so
you have got rid of them? Well, I dare say many of them were honest men, and suffered very
unjustly in common report."

Mackenzie answered nothing, but his daughter said quickly, "But, you know, Mr. Lavender, they
have not gone away merely because they cease to have the letting of the land to the crofters.
They have still their old holdings, and so have the crofters in most cases. Every one now holds
direct from the proprietor, that is all."

"So that there is no difference between the former tacksman and his serf except the relative
size of their farms?"

"Well, the crofters have no leases, but the tacksmen have," said the girl somewhat timidly;
and then she added, "But you have not decided yet, Mr. Ingram, what you will do to-day. It
is too clear for the salmon-fishing. Will you go over to Meavig, and show Mr. Lavender the
Bay of Uig and the Seven Hunters?"

"Surely we must show him Borvabost first, Sheila," said Ingram. "He saw nothing of it last
night in the dark; and I think, if you offered to take Mr. Lavender round in your boat and
show him what a clever sailor you are, he would prefer that to walking over the hill."

"I can take you all round in the boat, certainly," said the girl with a quick blush of pleasure;
and forthwith a message was sent to Duncan that cushions should be taken down to the Maighdean-mhara,
the little vessel of which Sheila was both skipper and pilot.

How beautiful was the fair sea-picture that lay around them as the Maighdean-mhara stood out
to the mouth of Loch Roag on this bright summer morning! Sheila sat in the stern of the small
boat, her hand on the filler. Lufrath lay at her feet, his nose between the long and shaggy
paws. Duncan, grave and watchful as to the wind and the points of the coast, sat amidships,
with the sheets of the mainsail held fast, and superintended the seamanship of his young mistress
with a respectful but most evident pride. And as Ingram had gone off with Mackenzie to walk
over to the White Water before going down to Borvabost, Frank Lavender was Sheila's sole companion
out in this wonderland of rock and sea and blue sky.

He did not talk much to her, and she was so well occupied with the boat that he could regard
with impunity the shifting lights and graces of her face and all the wonder and winning depths
of her eyes. The sea was blue around them; the sky overhead had not a speck of cloud in it;
the white sand-bays, the green stretches of pasture and the far and spectral mountains trembled
in a haze of sunlight. Then there was all the delight of the fresh and cool wind, the hissing
of the water along the boat, and the joyous rapidity with which the small vessel, lying over
a little, ran through the crisply curling waters, and brought into view the newer wonders of
the opening sea.

Was it not all a dream, that he should be sitting by the side of this sea-princess, who was
attended only by her deerhound and the tall keeper? And if a dream, why should it not go on
for ever? To live for ever in this magic land--to have the princess herself carry him in this
little boat into the quiet bays of the islands, or out at night, in moonlight, on the open
sea--to forget for ever the godless South and its social phantasmagoria, and live in this beautiful
and distant solitude, with the solemn secrets of the hills and the moving deep for ever present
to the imagination, might not that be a nobler life? And some day or other he would take this
island-princess up to London, and he would bid the women that he knew--the scheming mothers
and the doll-like daughters--stand aside from before this perfect work of God. She would carry
with her the mystery of the sea in the deeps of her eyes, and the music of the far hills would
be heard in her voice, and all the sweetness and purity and brightness of the clear summer
skies would be mirrored in her innocent soul. She would appear in London as some wild-plumaged
bird hailing from distant climes, and before she had lived there long enough to grow sad, and
have the weight of the city clouding the brightness of her eyes, she would be spirited away
again into this strange sea-kingdom, where there seemed to be perpetual sunshine and the light
music of the waves.

Poor Sheila! She little knew what was expected of her, or the sort of drama into which she
was being thrown as a central figure. She little knew that she, a simple Highland girl, was
being transformed into a wonderful creature of romance, who was to put to shame the gentle
dames and maidens of London society, and do many other extraordinary things. But what would
have appeared the most extraordinary of all these speculations, if she had only known of them,
was the assumption that she would marry Frank Lavender. That the young man had quite naturally
taken for granted, but perhaps only as a basis for his imaginative scenes. In order to do these
fine things she would have to be married to somebody, and why not to himself? Think of the
pride he would have in leading this beautiful girl, with her quaint manners and fashion of
speech, into a London drawing-room! Would not every one wish to know her? Would not every one
listen to her singing of those Gaelic songs? for of course she must sing well. Would not all
his artist friends be anxious to paint her? and she would go to the Academy to convince the
loungers there how utterly the canvas had failed to catch the light and dignity and sweetness
of her face.

When Sheila spoke he started.

"Did you not see it?"

"What?"

"The seal: it rose for a moment just over there," said the girl, with a great interest visible
in her eyes.

The beautiful dreams he had been dreaming were considerably shattered by this interruption.
How could a fairy princess be so interested in some common animal showing its head out of the
sea? It also occurred to him, just at this moment, that if Sheila and Mairi went out in this
boat by themselves, they must be in the habit of hoisting up the mainsail; and was such rude
and coarse work befitting the character of a princess?

"He looks very like a black man in the water when his head comes up," said Sheila--"when the
water is smooth so that you will see him look at you. But I have not told you yet about the
Black Horse that Alister-nan-Each saw at Loch Suainabhal one night. Loch Suainabhal, that is
inland and fresh water, so it was not a seal; but Alister was going along the shore, and he
saw it lying up by the road, and he looked at it for a long time. It was quite black, and he
thought it was a boat; but when he came near he saw it begin to move, and then it went down
across the shore and splashed into the loch. And it had a head bigger than a horse, and quite
black, and it made a noise as it went down the shore to the loch."

"Don't you think Alister must have been taking a little whisky, Miss Mackenzie?"

"No, not that, for he came to me just after he will see the beast."

"And do you really believe he saw such an animal?" said Lavender with a smile.

"I do not know," said the girl gravely. "Perhaps it was only a fright, and he imagined he saw
it; but I do not know it is impossible there can be such an animal at Loch Suainabhal. But
that is nothing: it is of no consequence. But I have seen stranger things than the Black Horse,
that many people will not believe."

"May I ask what they are?" he said gently.

"Some other time, perhaps, I will tell you; but there is much explanation about it, and, you
see, we are going in to Borvabost."

Was this, then, the capital of the small empire over which the princess ruled? He saw before
him but a long row of small huts or hovels resembling bee-hives, which stood above the curve
of a white bay, and at one portion of the bay was a small creek, near which a number of large
boats, bottom upward, lay on the beach. What odd little dwellings those were! The walls, a
few feet high, were built of rude blocks of stone or slices of turf, and from those low supports
rose a rounded roof of straw, which was thatched over by a further layer of turf. There were
few windows, and no chimneys at all--not even a hole in the roof. And what was meant by the
two men who, standing on one of the turf walls, were busily engaged in digging into the rich
brown and black thatch and heaving it into a cart? Sheila had to explain to him that while
she was doing everything in her power to get the people to suffer the introduction of windows,
it was hopeless to think of chimneys; for by carefully guarding against the egress of the peat-smoke,
it slowly saturated the thatch of the roof, which at certain periods of the year was then taken
off to dress the fields, and a new roof of straw put on.

By this time they had run the Maighdean-mhara--the "Sea Maiden"--into a creek, and were climbing
up the steep beach of shingle that had been worn smooth by the unquiet waters of the Atlantic.

"And will you want to speak to me, Ailasa?" said Sheila, turning to a small girl who had approached
her somewhat diffidently.

She was a pretty little thing, with a round fair face tanned by the sun, brown hair and soft
dark eyes. She was bare-headed, bare-footed and bare-armed, but she was otherwise smartly dressed,
and she held in her hand an enormous flounder, apparently about half as heavy as herself.

"Will ye hef the fesh, Miss Sheila?" said the small Ailasa, holding out the flounder, but looking
down all the same.

"Did you catch it yourself, Ailasa?"

"Yes, it wass Donald and me: we wass out in a boat, and Donald had a line."

"And it is a present for me?" said Sheila, patting the small head and its wild and soft hair.
"Thank you, Ailasa. But you must ask Donald to carry it up to the house and give it to Mairi.
I cannot take it with me just now, you know."

There was a small boy cowering behind one of the upturned boats, and by his furtive peepings
showing that he was in league with his sister. Ailasa, not thinking that she was discovering
his whereabouts, turned quite naturally in that direction, until she was suddenly stopped by
Lavender, who called to her and put his hand in his pocket. But he was too late. Sheila had
stepped in, and with a quick look, which was all the protest that was needed, shut her hand
over the half crown he had in his fingers.

"Never mind, Ailasa," she said. "Go away and get Donald, and bid him carry the fish up to Mairi."

Lavender put up the half crown in his pocket in a somewhat dazed fashion: what he chiefly knew
was that Sheila had for a moment held his hand in hers and that her eyes had met his.

Well, that little incident of Ailasa and the flounder was rather pleasant to him. It did not
shock the romantic associations he had begun to weave around his fair companion. But when they
had gone up to the cottages--Mackenzie and Ingram not yet having arrived--and when Sheila proceeded
to tell him about the circumstances of the fishermen's lives, and to explain how such and such
things were done in the fields and in the pickling-houses, and so forth, Lavender was a little
disappointed. Sheila took him into some of the cottages, or rather hovels, and he vaguely knew
in the darkness that she sat down by the low glow of the peat-fire, and began to ask the women
about all sorts of improvements in the walls and windows and gardens, and what not. Surely
it was not for a princess to go advising people about particular sorts of soap, or offering
to pay for a pane of glass if the husband of the woman would make the necessary aperture in
the stone wall. The picture of Sheila appearing as a sea-princess in a London drawing-room
was all very beautiful in its way, but here she was discussing as to the quality given to broth
by the addition of a certain vegetable which she offered to send down from her own garden if
the cottager in question would try to grow it.

"I wonder, Miss Mackenzie," he said at length, when they got outside, his eyes dazed with the
light and smarting with the peat-smoke--"I wonder you can trouble yourself with such little
matters that those people should find out for themselves."

The girl looked up with some surprise: "That is the work I have to do. My papa cannot do everything
in the island."

"But what is the necessity for your bothering yourself about such things? Surely they ought
to be able to look after their own gardens and houses. It is no degradation--certainly not,
for anything you interested yourself in would become worthy of attention by the very fact--but,
after all, it seems such a pity you should give up your time to these commonplace details."

"But some one must do it," said the girl quite innocently, "and my papa has no time. And they
will be very good in doing what I ask them--every one in the island."

Was this a willful affectation? he said to himself. Or was she really incapable of understanding
that there was anything incongruous in a young lady of her position, education and refinement
busying herself with the curing of fish and the cost of lime? He had himself marked the incongruity
long ago, when Ingram had been telling him of the remote and beautiful maiden whose only notions
of the world had been derived from literature--who was more familiar with the magic land in
which Endymion wandered than with any other--and that at the same time she was about as good
as her father at planning a wooden bridge over a stream. When Lavender had got outside again--when
he found himself walking with her along the white beach in front of the blue Atlantic--she
was again the princess of his dreams. He looked at her face, and he saw in her eyes that she
must be familiar with all the romantic nooks and glades of English poetry. The plashing of
the waves down there and the music of her voice recalled the sad legends of the fishermen he
hoped to hear her sing. But ever and anon there occurred a jarring recollection--whether arising
from a contradiction between his notion of Sheila and the actual Sheila, or whether from some
incongruity in himself, he did not stop to consider. He only knew that a beautiful maiden who
had lived by the sea all her life, and who had followed the wanderings of Endymion in the enchanted
forest, need not have been so particular about a method of boiling potatoes, or have shown
so much interest in a pattern for children's frocks.

Mackenzie and Ingram met them. There was the usual "Well, Sheila?" followed by a thousand questions
about the very things she had been inquiring into. That was one of the odd points about Ingram
that puzzled and sometimes vexed Lavender; for if you are walking home at night it is inconvenient
to be accompanied by a friend who would stop to ask about the circumstances of some old crone
hobbling along the pavement, or who could, on his own doorstep, stop to have a chat with a
garrulous policeman. Ingram was about as odd as Sheila herself in the attention he paid to
those wretched cotters and their doings. He could not advise on the important subject of broth,
but he would have tasted it by way of discovery, even if it had been presented to him in a
tea-cup. He had already been prowling round the place with Mackenzie. He had inspected the
apparatus in the creek for hauling up the boats. He had visited the curing-houses. He had examined
the heaps of fish drying on the beach. He had drunk whisky with John the Piper and shaken hands
with Alister-nan-Each. And now he had come to tell Sheila that the piper was bringing down
luncheon from Mackenzie's house, and that after they had eaten and drunk on the white beach
they would put out the Maighdean-mhara once more to sea, and sail over to Mevaig, that the
stranger might see the wondrous sands of the Bay of Uig.

But it was not in consonance with the dignity of a king that his guests should eat from off
the pebbles, like so many fishermen, and when Mairi and another girl brought down the baskets,
luncheon was placed in the stern of the small vessel, while Duncan got up the sails and put
out from the stone quay. As for John the Piper, was he insulted at having been sent on a menial
errand? They had scarcely got away from the shore when the sounds of the pipes was wafted to
them from the hillside above, and it was the "Lament of Mackrimmon" that followed them out to sea:

  Mackrimmon shall no more return,
  Oh never, never more return!

That was the wild and ominous air that was skirling up on the hillside; and Mackenzie's face,
as he heard it, grew wroth. "That teffle of a piper John!" he said with an involuntary stamp
of his foot. "What for will he be playing Cha till mi tuilich?"

"It is out of mischief, papa," said Sheila--"that is all."

"It will be more than mischief if I burn his pipes and drive him out of Borva. Then there will
be no more of mischief."

"It is very bad of John to do that," said Sheila to Lavender, apparently in explanation of
her father's anger, "for we have given him shelter here when there will be no more pipes in
all the Lewis. It wass the Free Church ministers, they put down the pipes, for there wass too
much wildness at the marriages when the pipes would play."

"And what do the people dance to now?" asked the young gentleman, who seemed to resent this
piece of paternal government.

Sheila laughed in an embarrassed way.

"Miss Mackenzie would rather not tell you," said Ingram. "The fact is, the noble mountaineers
of these districts have had to fall back on the Jew's harp. The ministers allow that instrument
to be used--I suppose because there is a look of piety in the name. But the dancing doesn't
get very mad when you have two or three young fellows playing a strathspey on a bit of trembling
wire."

"That teffle of a piper John!" growled Mackenzie under his breath; and so the Maighdean-mhara
lightly sped on her way, opening out the various headlands of the islands, until at last she
got into the narrows by Eilean-Aird-Meinish, and ran up the long arm of the sea to Mevaig.

They landed and went up the rocks. They passed two or three small white houses overlooking
the still, green waters of the sea, and then, following the line of a river, plunged into the
heart of a strange and lonely district, in which there appeared to be no life. The river-track
took them up a great glen, the sides of which were about as sheer as a railway-cutting. There
were no trees or bushes about, but the green pasture along the bed of the valley wore its brightest
colors in the warm sunlight, and far up on the hillsides the browns and crimsons of the heather
and the silver-gray of the rocks trembled in the white haze of the heat. Over that again the
blue sky, as still and silent as the world below.

They wandered on, content with idleness and a fine day. Mr. Mackenzie was talking with some
little loudness, so that Lavender might hear, of Mr. John Stuart Mill, and was anxious to convey
to Ted Ingram that a wise man, who is responsible for the well-being of his fellow-creatures,
will study all sides of all questions, however dangerous. Sheila was doing her best to entertain
the stranger, and he, in a dream of his own, was listening to the information she gave him.
How much of it did he carry away? He was told that the gray goose built its nest in the rushes
at the edge of lakes: Sheila knew several nests in Borva. Sheila also caught the young of the
wild-duck when the mother was guiding them down the hill-rivulets to the sea. She had tamed
many of them, catching them thus before they could fly. The names of most of the mountains
about here ended in bhal, which was a Gaelic corruption of the Norse fiall, a mountain. There
were many Norse names all through the Lewis, but more particularly toward the Butt. The termination
bost, for example, at the end of many words, meant an inhabited place, but she fancied bost
was Danish. And did Mr. Lavender know of the legend connected with the air of Cha till, cha
till mi tuille?

Lavender started as from a trance, with an impression that he had been desperately rude. He
was about to say that the gray gosling in the legend could not speak Scandinavian, when he
was interrupted by Mr. Mackenzie turning and asking him if he knew from what ports the English
smacks hailed that came up hither to the cod and the ling fishing for a couple of months in
the autumn. The young man said he did not know. There were many fishermen at Brighton. And
when the King of Borva turned to Ingram, to see why he was shouting with laughter, Sheila suddenly
announced to the party that before them lay the great Bay of Uig.

It was certainly a strange and impressive scene. They stood on the top of a lofty range of
hill, and, underneath them lay a vast semicircle, miles in extent, of gleaming white sand,
that had in bygone ages been washed in by the Atlantic. Into this vast plain of silver whiteness
the sea, entering by a somewhat narrow portal, stretched in long arms of a pale blue. Elsewhere,
the great crescent of sand was surrounded by a low line of rocky hill, showing a thousand tints
of olive-green and gray and heather-purple; and beyond that again rose the giant bulk of Mealasabhal,
grown pale in the heat, into the southern sky. There was not a ship visible along the blue
plain of the Atlantic. The only human habitation to be seen in the strange world beneath them
was a solitary manse. But away toward the summit of Mealasabhal two specks slowly circled in
the air, which Sheila thought were eagles; and far out on the western sea, lying like dusky
whales in the vague blue, were the Pladda Islands--the remote and unvisited Seven Hunters--whose
only inhabitants are certain flocks of sheep belonging to dwellers on the mainland of Lewis.

The travelers sat down on a low block of gneiss to rest themselves, and then and there did
the King of Borva recite his grievances and rage against the English smacks. Was it not enough
that they should in passing steal the sheep, but that they should also, in mere wantonness,
stalk them as deer, wounding them with rifle-bullets, and leaving them to die among the rocks?
Sheila said bravely that no one could tell that it was the English fishermen who did that.
Why not the crews of merchant-vessels, who might be of any nation? It was unfair to charge
upon any body of men such a despicable act, when there was no proof of it whatever.

"Why, Sheila," said Ingram with some surprise, "you never doubted before that it was the English
smacks that killed the sheep."

Sheila cast down her eyes and said nothing.

Was the sinister prophecy of John the Piper to be fulfilled? Mackenzie was so much engaged
in expounding politics to Ingram, and Sheila was so proud to show her companion all the wonders
of Uig, that when they returned to Mevaig in the evening the wind had altogether gone down
and the sea was as a sea of glass. But if John the Piper had been ready to foretell for Mackenzie
the fate of Mackrimmon, he had taken means to defeat destiny by bringing over from Borvabost
a large and heavy boat pulled by six rowers. These were not strapping young fellows, clad in
the best blue cloth to be got in Stornoway, but elderly men, gray, wrinkled, weather-beaten
and hard of face, who sat stolidly in the boat and listened with a sort of bovine gaze to the
old hunchback's wicked stories and jokes. John was in a mischievous mood, but Lavender, in
a confidential whisper, informed Sheila that her father would speedily be avenged on the inconsiderate
piper.

"Come, men, sing us a song, quick!" said Mackenzie as the party took their seats in the stern
and the great oars splashed into the sea of gold. "Look sharp, John, and no teffle of a drowning
song!"

In a shrill, high, querulous voice the piper, who was himself pulling one of the two stroke
oars, began to sing, and then the men behind him, gathering courage, joined in an octave lower,
their voices being even more uncertain and lugubrious than his own. These poor fishermen had
not had the musical education of Clan-Alpine's warriors. The performance was not enlivening,
and as the monotonous and melancholy sing-song that kept time to the oars told its story in
Gaelic, all that the English strangers could make out was an occasional reference to Jura or
Scarba or Isla. It was, indeed, the song of an exile shut up in "sea-worn Mull," who was complaining
of the wearisome look of the neighboring islands.

"But why do you sing such Gaelic as that, John?" said young Lavender confidently. "I should
have thought a man in your position--the last of the Hebridean bards--would have known the
classical Gaelic. Don't you know the classical Gaelic?"

"There iss only the wan sort of Kâllic, and it is a ferry goot sort of Kâllic," said the piper
with some show of petulance.

"Do you mean to tell me you don't know your own tongue? Do you not know what the greatest of
all the bards wrote about your own island?--'O et præsidium et dulce decus meum, agus, Tityre
tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine Styornoway, Arma virumque cano, Macklyoda et Borvabost sub tegmine
fagi?'"

Not only John the Piper, but all the men behind him, began to look amazed and sorely troubled;
and all the more so that Ingram--who had picked up more Gaelic words than his friend--came
to his assistance, and began to talk to him in this unknown tongue. They heard references in
the conversation to persons and things with which they were familiar in their own language,
but still accompanied by much more they could not understand.

The men now began to whisper awe-stricken questions to each other; and at last John the Piper
could not restrain his curiosity. "What in ta name of Kott is tat sort of Kâllic?" he asked,
with some look of fear in his eyes.

"You are not much of a student, John," said Lavender carelessly, "but still, a man in your
position should know something of your own language. A bard, a poet, and not know the classical
form of your own tongue!"

"Is it, ta Welsh Kâllic?" cried John in desperation, for he knew that the men behind him would
carry the story of his ignorance all over Borvabost.

"The Welsh Gaelic? No. I see you will have to go to school again."

"There iss no more Kâllic in ta schools," said the piper, eagerly seizing the excuse. "It iss
Miss Sheila, she will hef put away all ta Kâllic from ta schools."

"But you were born half a century before Miss Sheila: how is it you neglected to learn that
form of Gaelic that has been sacred to the use of the bards and poets since the time of Ossian?"

There were no more quips or cranks for John the Piper during the rest of the pull home. The
wretched man relapsed into a moody silence and worked mechanically at his oar, brooding over
this mysterious language of which he had not even heard. As for Lavender, he turned to Mackenzie
and begged to know what he thought of affairs in France.

And so they sailed back to Borvabost over the smooth water that lay like a lake of gold. Was
it not a strange sight to see the Atlantic one vast and smooth yellow plain under the great
glow of saffron that spread across the regions of the sunset? It was a world of light, unbroken
but by the presence of a heavy coaster that had anchored in the bay, and that sent a long line
of trembling black down on the perfect mirror of the sea. As they got near the shore the portions
that were in shadow showed with a strange distinctness the dark green of the pasture and the
sharp outlines of the rocks; and there was a cold scent of seaweed in the evening air. The
six heavy oars plashed into the smooth bay. The big boat was moored to the quay, and its passengers
landed once more in Borva. And when they turned, on their way home, to look from the brow of
the hill, on which Sheila had placed a garden-seat, lo! all the west was on fire, the mountains
in the south had grown dark on their eastern side, and the plain of the sea was like a lake
of blood, with the heavy hull and masts of the coaster grown large and solemn and distant.
There was scarcely a ripple around the rocks at their feet to break the stillness of the approaching
twilight.

So another day had passed, devoid of adventure or incident. Lavender had not rescued his wonderful
princess from an angry sea, nor had he shown prowess in slaying a dozen stags, nor in any way
distinguished himself. To all outward appearance the relations of the party were the same at
night as they had been in the morning. But the greatest crises of life steal on us imperceptibly,
and have sometimes occurred and wound us in their consequences before we know. The memorable
things in a man's career are not always marked by some sharp convulsion. The youth does not
necessarily marry the girl whom he happens to fish out of a mill-pond: his future life may
be far more definitely shaped for him at a prosaic dinner-table, where he fancies he is only
thinking of the wines. We are indeed but as children seated on the shore, watching the ripples
that come on to our feet; and while the ripples unceasingly repeat themselves, and while the
hour that passes is but as the hour before it, constellation after constellation has gone by
over our heads unheeded and unseen, and we awake with a start to find ourselves in a new day,
with all our former life cut off from us and become as a dream.

CHAPTER V.

SHEILA SINGS.

A knocking at Ingram's door.

"Well, what's the matter?"

"Will ye be goin' to ta fishin', Mr. Ingram?"

"Is that you, Duncan? How the devil have you got over from Mevaig at this hour of the morning?"

"Oh, there wass a bit breeze tis morning, and I hef prought over ta Maighdean-mhara. And there
iss a very goot ripple on ta watter, if you will tek ta other gentleman to try for ta salmon."

"All right! Hammer at his door until he gets up. I shall be ready in ten minutes."

About half an hour thereafter the two young men were standing at the front of Mackenzie's house,
examining the enormous rod that Duncan had placed against the porch. It was still early morning,
and there was a cold wind blowing in from the sea, but there was not a speck of cloud in the
sky, and the day promised to be hot. The plain of the Atlantic was no longer a sheet of glass:
it was rough and gray, and far out an occasional quiver of white showed where a wave was hissing
over. There was not much of a sea on, but the heavy wash of the water round the rocks and sandy
bays could be distinctly heard in the silence of the morning.

And what was this moving object down there by the shore where the Maighdean-mhara lay at anchor?
Both the young men at once recognized the glimmer of the small white feather and the tightly-fitting
blue dress of the sea-princess.

"Why, there is Sheila!" cried Ingram. "What in all the world is she about at such an hour?"

At this moment Duncan came out with a book of flies in his hand, and he said in rather a petulant
way, "And it iss no wonder Miss Sheila will be out. And it wass Miss Sheila herself will tell
me to see if you will go to ta White Water and try for a salmon."

"And she is bringing up something from the boat: I must go and carry it for her," said Lavender,
making down the path to the shore with the speed of a deer.

When Sheila and he came up the hill there was a fine color in the girl's face from her morning's
exertions, but she was not disposed to go indoors to rest. On the contrary, she was soon engaged
in helping Mairi to bring in some coffee to the parlor, while Duncan cut slices of ham and
cold beef big enough to have provisioned a fishing-boat bound for Caithness. Sheila had had
her breakfast; so she devoted all her time to waiting upon her two guests, until Lavender could
scarcely eat through the embarrassment produced by her noble servitude. Ingram was not so sensitive,
and made a very good meal indeed.

"Where's your father, Sheila?" said Ingram when the last of their preparations had been made
and they were about to start for the river, "Isn't he up yet?"

"My father?" said the girl, with the least possible elevation of her eyebrows--"he will be
down at Borvabost an hour ago. And I hope that John the Piper will not see him this morning.
But we must make haste, Mr. Ingram, for the wind will fall when the sun gets stronger, and
then your friend will have no more of the fishing."

So they set out, and Ingram put Sheila's hand on his arm, and took her along with him in that
fashion, while the tall gillie walked behind with Lavender, who was or was not pleased with
the arrangement. The young man, indeed, was a trifle silent, but Duncan was in an amiable and
communicative mood, and passed the time in telling him stories of the salmon he had caught,
and of the people who had tried to catch them and failed. Sheila and Ingram certainly went
a good pace up the hill and round the summit of it, and down again into the valley of the White
Water. The light step of the girl seemed to be as full of spring as the heather on which she
trod; and as for her feet getting wet, the dew must have soaked them long ago. She was in the
brightest of spirits. Lavender could hear her laughing in a low pleased fashion, and then presently
her head would be turned up toward her companion, and all the light of some humorous anecdote
would appear in her face and in her eloquent eyes, and it would be Ingram's turn to break out
into one of those short abrupt laughs that had something sardonic in them.

But hark! From the other side of the valley comes another sound, the faint and distant skirl
of the pipes, and yonder is the white-haired hunchback, a mere speck in a waste of brown and
green morass. What is he playing to himself now?

"He is a foolish fellow, that John," said the tall keeper, "for if he comes down to Borvabost
this morning it iss Mr. Mackenzie will fling his pipes in ta sea, and he will hef to go away
and work in ta steamboat. He iss a ferry foolish fellow; and it wass him tat wass goin' into
ta steamboat before, and he went to a tailor in Styornoway, and he said to him, 'I want a pair
o' troosers.' And the tailor said to him, 'What sort o' troosers iss it you will want?' And
he said to him, 'I want a pair o' troosers for a steamboat.' A pair o' troosers for a steamboat!--he
is a teffle of a foolish fellow. And it wass him that went in ta steamboat with a lot o' freens
o' his, that wass a' goin' to Skye to a big weddin' there; and it wass a very bad passage,
and when tey got into Portree the captain said to him, 'John, where iss all your freens that
tey do not come ashore?' And he said to him, 'I hef peen down below, sir, and four-thirds o'
ta whole o' them are a' half-trooned and sick and tead.' Four-thirds o' ta whole o' them! And
he iss just the ferry man to laugh at every other pody when it iss a mistake you will make
in ta English."

"I suppose," said Lavender, "you found it rather difficult to learn good English?"

"Well, sir, I hefna got ta goot English yet. But Miss Sheila she has put away all the Gaelic
from the schools, and the young ones they will learn more of ta good English after that."

"I wish I knew as much Gaelic as you know English," said the young man.

"Oh, you will soon learn. It iss very easy if you will only stay in ta island."

"It would take me several months to pick it up, I suppose?"

"Oh, yes--nine or six--that will do," said Duncan. "You will begin to learn ta names o' ta
islands and ta places. There now, as far as you can see is ta Seann Bheinn; and it means ta
old hill. And there is a rock there: it is Stac-nan Balg--"

Here Duncan looked rather perplexed.

"Yes," said Lavender: "what does that mean?"

"It means--it means," said Duncan in still greater perplexity, and getting a little impatient,
"it means--stac, tat iss a steep rock: Stac-nan-Balg--it means--well, sir, it is ower deep
for ta English"

The tone of mortification in which Duncan uttered these words warned Lavender that his philological
studies might as well cease; and indeed Sheila and Ingram had by this time reached the banks
of the White Water, and were waiting Duncan and the majestic rod.

It was much too bright and pleasant a morning for good fishing, but there was a fair ripple
on the pools of the stream, where ever and anon a salmon fresh run from the sea would leap
into the air, showing a gleaming curve of silver to the sunlight. The splash of the big fish
seemed an invitation, and Duncan was all anxiety to teach the stranger, who, as he fancied,
knew nothing about throwing a fly. Ingram lay down on a rock some little distance back from
the banks, and put his hands beneath his head and watched the operations going forward. But
was it really Duncan who was to teach the stranger? It was Sheila who picked out flies for
him. It was Sheila who held the rod while he put them on the line. It was Sheila who told him
where the bigger salmon usually lay--under the opposite bank of the broad and almost lake-like
pool into which the small but rapid White Water came tumbling and foaming down its narrow channel
of rocks and stones.

Then Sheila waited to see her pupil begin. He had evidently a little difficulty about the big
double-handed rod, a somewhat more formidable engine of destruction than the supple little
thing with which he had whipped the streams of Devonshire and Cornwall.

The first cast sent both flies and a lump of line tumbling on to the pool, and would have driven
the boldest of salmon out of its wits. The second pretty nearly took a piece out of Ingram's
ear, and made him shift his quarters with rapidity. Duncan gave him up in despair. The third
cast dropped both flies with the lightness of a feather in the running waters of the other
side of the pool; and the next second there was a slight wave along the surface, a dexterous
jerk with the butt, and presently the line was whirled out into the middle of the pool, running
rapidly off the reel from the straining rod.

"Plenty o' line, sir, plenty o' line!" shouted Duncan in a wild fever of anxiety, for the fish
had plunged suddenly.

Ingram had come running down to the bank. Sheila was all excitement and interest as she stood
and watched every slackening or tightening of the line as the fish went up the pool and down
the pool, and crossed the current in his efforts to escape. The only self-possessed person,
indeed, was Lavender himself, who presently said, "Miss Mackenzie, won't you take the rod now
and have the honor of landing him? I don't think he will show much more fight."

At this moment, however, the line slackened suddenly, and the fish threw himself clean out
of the water, turning a complete summersault. It was a dangerous moment, but the captive was
well hooked, and in his next plunge Lavender was admonished by Duncan to keep a good strain on him.

"I will take the second one," Sheila promised, "if you like; but you must surely land your
first salmon yourself."

I suppose nobody but a fisherman can understand the generosity of the offer made by the young
man. To have hooked your first salmon--to have its first wild rushes and plunges safely over--and
to offer to another the delight of bringing him victoriously to bank! But Sheila knew. And
what could have surpassed the cleverness with which he had hooked the fish, and the coolness
and courage he showed throughout the playing of him, except this more than royal offer on the
part of the young hero?

The fish was losing strength. All the line had been got in, although the fore finger of the
fisherman felt the pulse of his captive, as it were, ready for any expiring plunge. They caught
occasional glimpses of a large white body gliding through the ruddy-brown water. Duncan was
down on his knees more than once, with the landing-net in his hand, but again and again the
big fish would sheer off, with just such indications of power as to make his conqueror cautious.
At length he was guided slowly in to the bank. Behind him the landing-net was gently let into
the water--then a quick forward movement, and a fourteen-pounder was scooped up and flung upon
the bank, landing-net and all. "Hurrah!" cried Ingram, and Lavender blushed like a school-girl;
and Sheila, quite naturally and without thinking, shook hands with him and said, "I congratulate
you;" and there was more congratulation in her glad eyes than in that simple little gesture.

It was a good beginning, and of course the young man was very much pleased to show Sheila that
he was no mere lily-fingered idler about town. He buckled to his work in earnest. With a few
more casts he soon got into the way of managing the big rod; and every time the flies fell
lightly on the other side of the pool, to be dragged with gentle jerks across the foaming current
of the stream. Ingram went back to his couch on the rock. He lay and watched the monotonous
flinging back of the long rod, the light whistle of the line through the air, and the careful
manipulation of the flies through the water. Or was it something else that he was watching--something
that awakened in his mind a sudden sense of surprise and fear, and a new and strange consciousness
that he had been guiltily remiss?

Sheila was wholly preoccupied with her companion and his efforts. He had had one or two rises,
but had struck either too soon or too late, until at last there was a terrific plunge and rush,
and again the line was whirled out. But Duncan did not like the look of it, somehow. The fish
had been sheering off when it was hooked, and the deep plunge at the outset was ugly.

"Now will you take the rod?" said Lavender to Sheila.

But before she could answer the fish had come rushing up to the surface, and had thrown itself
out of the water, so that it fell on the opposite bank. It was a splendid animal, and Duncan,
despite his doubts, called out to Ingram to slacken his hold. There was another spring into
the air, the fish fell with a splash into the water, and the line was flying helplessly in
the air, with the two flies floating about.

"Ay," said Duncan, with a sigh, "it wass foul-hooked. It wass no chance of catching him whatever."

Lavender was more successful next time, however, with a pretty little grilse of about half
a dozen pounds, that seemed to have in him the spirit and fight of a dozen salmon. How he rushed
and struggled, how he plunged and sulked, how he burrowed along the banks, and then ran out
to the middle of the pool, and then threw himself into the air, with the line apparently but
not really doubling up under him! All these things can only be understood by the fisherman
who has played in a Highland stream a wild and powerful little grilse fresh in from the salt
water. And it was Sheila who held him captive, who humored him when he sulked, and gently guided
him away from dangerous places, and kept him well in hand when he tried to cross the current,
until at last, all the fierceness gone out of him, he let himself be tenderly inveigled into
the side of the pool, where Duncan, by a dexterous movement, surrounded him with network and
placed his shining body among the bright green grass.

But Ingram was not so overjoyed this time. He complimented Sheila in a friendly way, but he
was rather grave, and obviously did not care for this business of fishing. And so Sheila, fancying
that he was rather dull because he was not joining in the sport, proposed that he should walk
back to the house with her, leaving Mr. Lavender with Duncan. And Ingram was quite ready to do so.

But Lavender protested that he cared very little for salmon-fishing. He suggested that they
should all go back together. The sun was killing the wind, and soon the pools would be as clear
as glass. Had they not better try in the afternoon, when perhaps the breeze would freshen?
And so they walked back to the house.

On the garden-seat a book lay open. It was Mr. Mill's Essay on Liberty, and it had evidently
been left there by Mr. Mackenzie, perhaps--who knows?--to hint to his friends from the South
that he was familiar with the problems of the age. Lavender winked to Ingram, but somehow his
companion seemed in no humor for a joke.

They had luncheon then, and after luncheon Ingram touched Lavender on the shoulder and said,
"I want to have a word with you privately. Let's walk down to the shore."

And so they did; and when they had got some little distance from the house, Ingram said, "Look
here, Lavender. I mean to be frank with you. I don't think it fair that you should try to drag
Sheila Mackenzie into a flirtation. I knew you would fall in love with her. For a week or two,
that does not matter--it harms no one. But I never thought of the chance of her being led into
such a thing, for what is a mere passing amusement to you would be a very serious thing to her."

"Well?"

"Well? Is not that enough? Do you think it fair to take advantage of this girl's ignorance
of the world?"

Lavender stopped in the middle of the path, and said, somewhat stiffly, "This may be as well
settled at once. You have talked of flirtation and all that sort of thing. You may regard it
as you please, but before I leave this island I mean to ask Sheila Mackenzie to be my wife."

"Why, you are mad!" cried Ingram, amazed to see that the young man was perfectly serious.

The other shrugged his shoulders.

"Do you mean to say," continued Ingram, "that even supposing Sheila would consent--which is
impossible--you would try to take away that girl from her father?"

"Girls must leave their fathers some time or other," said Lavender somewhat sullenly.

"Not unless they are asked."

"Oh well, they are sure to be asked, and they are sure to go. If their mothers had not done
so before them, where would they be? It's all very well for you to talk about it and argue
it out as a theory, but I know what the facts of the case are, and what any man in my position
would do; and I know that I am careless of any consequences so long as I can secure her for
my wife."

"Apparently you are--careless of any consequences to herself or those about her."

"But what is your objection, Ingram?" said the young man, suddenly abandoning his defiant manner:
"why should you object? Do you think I would make a bad husband to the woman I married?"

"I believe nothing of the sort. I believe you would make a very good husband if you were to
marry a woman whom you knew something about, and whom you had really learned to love and respect
through your knowledge of her. I tell you, you know nothing about Sheila Mackenzie as yet.
If you were to marry her to-morrow, you would discover in six months she was a woman wholly
different from what you had expected."

"Very well, then," said Lavender with an air of triumph, "you can't deny this: you think so
much of her that the real woman I would discover must be better than the one I imagine; and
so you don't expect I shall be disappointed?"

"If you marry Sheila Mackenzie you will be disappointed--not through her fault, but your own.
Why, a more preposterous notion never entered into a man's head! She knows nothing of your
friends or your ways of life: you know nothing of hers. She would be miserable in London, even
if you could persuade her father to go with her, which is the most unlikely thing in the world.
Do give up this foolish idea, like a good fellow; and do it before Sheila is dragged into a
flirtation that may have the most serious consequences to her."

Lavender would not promise, but all that afternoon various resolutions and emotions were struggling
within him for mastery, insomuch that Duncan could not understand the blundering way in which
he whipped the pools. Mackenzie, Sheila and Ingram had gone off to pay a visit to an old crone
who lived in a neighboring island, and in whom Ingram had been much interested a few years
before; so that Lavender had an opportunity of practicing the art of salmon-fishing without
interruptions. But all the skill he had shown in the morning seemed to have deserted him; and
at last he gave the rod to Duncan, and, sitting down on a top-coat flung on the wet heather,
indolently watched the gillie's operations.

Should he at once fly from temptation and return to London? Would it not be heroic to leave
this old man in possession of his only daughter? Sheila would never know of the sacrifice,
but what of that? It might be for her happiness that he should go.

But when a young man is in love, or fancies himself in love, with a young girl, it is hard
for him to persuade himself that anybody else can make her as happy as he might. Who could
be so tender to her, so watchful over her, as himself? He does not reflect that her parents
have had the experience of years in taking care of her, while he would be a mere novice at
the business. The pleasure with which he regards the prospect of being constantly with her
he transfers to her, and she seems to demand it of him as a duty that he should confer upon
her this new happiness.
