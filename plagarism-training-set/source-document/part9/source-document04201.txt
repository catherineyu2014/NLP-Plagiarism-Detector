253. Food Notions.--Many erroneous ideas exist as to the nutritive value of foods, and often
wholesome and valuable foods are discriminated against because of prejudice. Skim milk is usually
regarded as containing little if any nourishing material, when in reality it has a high protein
content, and can be added to other foods to increase their nutritive value. The less expensive
cuts of meat contain more total nutrients than many of the more expensive ones. Beef extracts
have been erroneously said to contain more nutrients than beef,[51] and mushrooms to be equal
in value of beefsteak; chemical analyses fail to confirm either statement. The banana also
has been overestimated as to food value, and while it contains more nutrients than many fruits,
it is not the equal of cereals, as has been claimed.[82] Cocoa, although a valuable beverage,
adds but little in the way of nutrients to a ration unless it is made with milk. The value
of a food should be based upon its composition as determined by chemical analysis, its digestibility
as founded upon digestion experiments, and its palatability and mechanical structure. Food
notions have, in many instances, been the cause of banishing from the dietary wholesome and
nutritious foods, of greatly increasing the cost of living, as well as of promulgating incorrect
ideas in regard to foods, so that individuals and in some cases entire families have suffered
from improper or insufficient food.

254. Dietary of Two Families Compared.--A dietary study often reveals ways in which it is possible
to improve the ration in kinds and amounts of food, and sometimes at less expense. The following
dietaries of two families for the same period show that one family expends over twice as much
in the purchase of foods as the other family, and yet the one whose food costs the less actually
secures the larger amount of nutritive material and is better fed than the family where more
money is expended for food.[13]

In comparing the foods used by the two families, it will be observed that family No. 1 purchased
their bread at the bakery at a cost of $ 1.00, while the bread of family No. 2 was home-made,
skim milk being used in its preparation, the flour, milk, yeast, and shortening costing about
55 cents. Family No. 1 consumed 10 pounds of expensive steaks, family No. 2 consumed the same
number of pounds, a portion being cheaper cuts. Instead of the 20 pounds of roast or similar
beef used by family No. 1, only one half as much and cheaper cuts as boiling pieces, stew,
rump roast, etc., were used by family No. 2; 5 pounds of beans and 5 pounds of cheese taking
the place of some of the meat. Family No. 1 consumed 4 pounds of high-priced cereal breakfast
foods, supposing they contained a larger amount of nutrients than were actually present. In
place of the 4 pounds of high-priced cereal breakfast foods of family No. 1, family No. 2 used
5 pounds of oatmeal purchased in bulk. Family No. 1 bought their cake and pastry for $3.00,
while those of family No. 2 were home made and cost $1.00. Family No. 2 used 2 pounds less
butter per week because of the preparation and use of home-made shortening from beef suet and
milk. They also purchased a smaller amount of tea, coffee, and spices than family No. 1. Family
No. 2 consumed a larger quantity of less expensive fruits and vegetables than family No. 1,
who ate 75 cents' worth of mushrooms with the idea that they contained as much protein as meat,
but analyses show that mushrooms contain no more nutrients than potatoes and similar vegetables.
In place of the celery and oranges, apples and prunes were used by family No. 2. The same amount
of potatoes was used by each. Fifty cents was spent for milk by family No. 1 and $1.00 by family
No. 2. The total amount expended for food by family No. 1 was $23.45, while family No. 2 purchased
a greater variety of foods for $11.30, as well as foods containing more nutrients. The approximate
amounts of nutrients in the foods purchased by the two families are given in the following
table, from which it will be observed that family No. 2 obtained a much larger amount of total
nutrients and was better fed at considerably less expense than family No. 1.

  =====================================================

255. Food in its Relation to Mental and Physical Vigor.--When the body is not properly supplied
with food, the best results in the form of productive work cannot be secured. There is a close
relationship between the nature of the food consumed and mental activity, also ability to satisfactorily
perform physical labor. "The productive power of the individual as well as of the nation depends
doubtless upon many factors other than food, such as race, climate, habit, etc., but there
is no gainsaying the fact that diet has also a profound and direct influence upon it."[83]

If the body is diseased, it cannot make the right uses of the food, and often the food is blamed
when the trouble is due primarily to other causes. The fact that a diseased digestive tract
is unable to utilize some foods is no valid reason why these foods should be discarded in the
dietary of persons in normal health, particularly when the food is in no way responsible for
the disease.

Some diseases are most prevalent in the case of a restricted diet. A change in the dietary
of the Japanese navy greatly improved the health of the sailors.

     "The prevalence of kakke or beriberi in the navy turned the
     attention of many medical specialists toward the problem of
     nutrition.... It was generally believed that there was some very
     close connection between the disease and the rice diet.... One
     outcome of these investigations was the passage of the food supply
     act of the navy in 1884. The ration provided in accordance with
     this act was sufficient to furnish an abundance of protein and
     energy.... Following the change of ration in 1884, the prevalence
     of the disease was very materially diminished, and at the end of
     three years cases of kakke were practically unknown among the
     marines."[83]

256. Dietary Studies in Public Institutions.--Dietary studies in public institutions, as prisons,
and asylums for the insane, show that it is possible to secure greater variety of food containing
a larger amount of nutrients, and even at a reduction in cost.[84] In such institutions it
is important that the food should be not only ample in amount, but wholesome and nutritious,
as many of the inmates respond both physically and mentally to an improved diet. For humanitarian
as well as economic reasons institutional dietetics should more generally be placed under the
supervision of skilled dietists.

CHAPTER XVIII

RATIONAL FEEDING OF MAN

257. Object.--Rational feeding of man has for its object the regulation of the food supply
in accord with the demands of the body. It is based upon the same principles as the rational
feeding of animals; in each, the best results in the way of health, amount of labor performed,
and economy are secured when the body receives nutrients sufficient for the production of heat
and energy and for the repair of worn-out tissues. Rational feeding is simply regulation of
the food, both as to kind and amount, to meet the needs of the body.[72]

258. Standard Rations.--In human feeding, as in animal feeding, it is not possible to lay down
hard and fast rules as to the quantity of nutrients required for a standard ration.[85] As
stated in the chapter on Dietary Studies, such standards have been proposed, but they are to
be considered as tentative rather than absolute, for the amount of food required by different
persons must necessarily vary with the individuality. While it is impossible to establish absolute
standards, any large variation from the provisional standards usually results in lessened ability
to accomplish work, ill health, or increased expense.

259. Amounts of Food Consumed.--The approximate amounts of some food articles consumed per
day are as follows:

  ===================================
          |   RANGE   | APPROXIMATE
          |           |AMOUNT IN LBS.
  --------|--------------------------
  Bread   |6 to 14 oz.| 0.50
  Butter  |2 to  5 oz.| 0.12
  Potatoes|8 to 16 oz.| 0.75
  Cheese  |1 to  4 oz.| 0.12
  Beans   |1 to  4 oz.| 0.12
  Milk    |8 to 32 oz.|  --
  Sugar   |2 to  5 oz.| 0.20
  Meats   |4 to 12 oz.| 0.25
  Oatmeal |1 to  4 oz.| 0.12
  ===================================

In the calculation of rations it is desirable that the amount of any food article should not
exceed that designated, unless for some special reason it has been found the food can consistently
be increased. The amount of nutrients given in dietary standards is for one day, and the nutrients
may be divided among the three meals as desired. It is to be noted that, ordinarily, the foods
which supply carbohydrates are flour, corn meal, cereal products, potatoes, beans, sugar, and
milk; those which supply fat are milk, butter, lard, and meats; and those which supply protein
in liberal amounts are beans, cheese, meats, oatmeal, cereals, bread, and milk.

260. Average Composition of Foods.--The amounts of nutrients in foods are determined from the
average composition of the foods. These figures for average composition are based upon analyses
of a large number of samples of food materials.[7] In individual cases it will be found that
foods may vary from the standards given; as for example, milk may contain from 2.5 to 5 per
cent of fat, while the protein and fat of meats vary appreciably from the figures given for
average composition. With the cereals and vegetable foods, variations from the standards are
small. In the table, the composition of the food as purchased represents all of the nutrients
in the food, including those in the refuse, trimmings, or waste, while the figures for the
edible portion represent the nutrients in the food after deducting what is lost as refuse.
In making calculations, the student should use the figures given for the foods as purchased,
unless the weights are of the edible portion only. The figures in the table are on the basis
of percentage amounts, or nutrients in 100 pounds of food. By moving the decimal point two
places to the left, the figures will represent the nutrients in one pound, and if this is multiplied
by the number of pounds or fraction of a pound used, the quantity of nutrients is secured.
For example, suppose bread contains 9.5 per cent of protein and 56 per cent of carbohydrates,
1 pound would contain 0.095 pound of protein, 0.56 pound of carbohydrates; and 0.5 of a pound
would contain approximately 0.05 pound of protein and 0.28 pound of carbohydrates. In calculating
rations, it is not necessary to carry the figures to the third decimal place.

261. Example of a Ration.--Suppose it is desired to calculate a ration for a man at light muscular
work. First, note the requirements in the way of nutrients in the table "Dietary Standards,"
Section 246. Such a ration should supply approximately 0.22 pound each of protein and fat,
and 0.77 pound of carbohydrates, and should yield 2800 calories. A trial ration is made by
combining the following:

  ==========================================================
                                                 | Pound
  Bread                                          |  0.50
  Butter                                         |  0.12
  Potatoes                                       |  0.75
  Milk                                           |  1.00
  Sugar                                          |  0.12
  Beef                                           |  0.25
  Ham                                            |  0.20
  Oatmeal                                        |  0.12
  Eggs                                           |  0.25
  ==========================================================

The quantities of nutrients in these food materials are approximately as follows:

RATION FOR MAN AT MODERATE WORK

  ===================================================================
                           |      | PROTEIN | FAT  | C.H. |
                           | LB.  |   LB.   | LB.  | LB.  | CALORIES
  -------------------------+------+---------+------+------+----------
  Bread                    | 0.50 |   0.05  | 0.01 | 0.29 |    653
  Butter                   | 0.12 |    --   | 0.10 |  --  |    432
  Potato                   | 0.75 |   0.01  |  --  | 0.12 |    244
  Milk                     | 1.00 |   0.04  | 0.04 | 0.05 |    323
  Sugar                    | 0.12 |    --   |  --  | 0.12 |    192
  Beef (round)             | 0.25 |   0.05  | 0.03 |  --  |    218
  Ham                      | 0.20 |   0.03  | 0.07 |  --  |    331
  Oatmeal                  | 0.12 |   0.02  | 0.01 | 0.08 |    223
  Eggs                     | 0.25 |   0.03  | 0.03 |  --  |    164
  Squash                   | 0.20 |    --   |  --  | 0.01 |     25
                           |------+---------+------+------+----------
                           |      |   0.23  | 0.29 | 0.67 |   2805
  ===================================================================

It is to be noted that this ration contains approximately the amount of protein called for
in the standard ration, while the fat is slightly more and the carbohydrates are less. The
food value of the ration is practically that called for in the standard. This ration is sufficiently
near the standard to supply the nutrient requirements of a man at light muscular work. To supply
palatability, some fruit and vegetables should be added to the ration. These will contribute
but little to the nutrient content, but are necessary in order to secure health and the best
returns from the other foods, and as previously stated, they are not to be estimated entirely
upon the basis of nutrient content. A number of food articles could be substituted in this
ration, if desired, either in the interests of economy, palatability, or personal preference.

262. Requisites of a Balanced Ration.--Reasonable combinations of foods should be made to form
balanced rations.[2] A number of foods slow of digestion, or which require a large amount of
intestinal work, should not be combined; neither should foods which are easily digested and
which leave but little indigestible residue. After a ration has been calculated and found to
contain the requisite amount of nutrients, it should be critically examined to see whether
or not it fulfills the following requirements:

     1. Economy and adaptability to the work required.

     2. Necessary bulk or volume.

     3. Desired physiological influence of the foods upon the digestive
     tract, whether constipating or laxative in character.

     4. Ease of digestion.

     5. Effect upon health. It is recognized that there are foods
     wholesome and nutritious, that cannot be used by some persons,
     while with others the same foods can be consumed with impunity.

As explained in the chapter on Dietary Studies, the nutrients should be supplied from a number
of foods rather than from a few, because it is believed the various nutrients, particularly
the proteins, are not absolutely identical from all sources, or equal in nutritive value.

EXAMPLES

1. Calculate a ration for a man with little physical exercise.

2. Calculate a ration for a man at hard muscular labor, and give the approximate cost of the
ration.

3. Calculate the amounts of food and the nutrient requirements for a family of seven for 10
days; five of the family to consume 0.8 as much as an adult. Calculate the cost of the food;
then calculate on the same basis the probable cost of food for one year, adding 20 per cent
for fluctuation in market price and additional foods not included in the list.

4. Weigh out the food articles used in problem No. 2, and apportion them among three meals.

CHAPTER XIX

WATER

263. Importance.--Water is one of the most essential food materials. It enters into the composition
of the body, and without it the nutrients of foods would be unavailable, and life could not
be sustained. Water unites chemically with various elements to form plant tissue and supplies
hydrogen and oxygen for the production of organic compounds within the leaves of plants. In
the animal economy it is not definitely known whether or not water furnishes any of the elements
of which the tissues are composed, as the food contains liberal amounts of hydrogen and oxygen;
it is necessary mainly as the vehicle for distributing nutrients in suspension and solution,
and as a medium in which chemical, physical, and physiological changes essential to life processes
take place. From a sanitary point of view, the condition of the water supply is of great importance,
as impure water seriously affects the health of the consumer.[87]

264. Impurities in Water.--Waters are impure because of: (1) excessive amounts of alkaline
salts and other mineral compounds; (2) decaying animal and vegetable matters which act chemically
as poisons and irritants, and which may serve as food for the development of objectionable
bacterial bodies; and (3) injurious bacteria. The most common forms of impurities are excess
of organic matter and bacterial contamination. The sanitary condition of water is greatly influenced
by the character of the soil through which it flows and the extent to which it has been polluted
by surface drainage.[88]

265. Mineral Impurities.--- The mineral impurities of water are mainly soluble alkaline and
similar compounds dissolved by the water in passing through various layers of soil and rock.
When water contains a large amount of sodium chloride, sodium sulphate or carbonate, or other
alkaline salts, it is termed an "alkali water." Where water passes through soil that has been
largely formed from the decay of rocks containing alkaline minerals, the water dissolves some
of these minerals and becomes alkaline. The kind of alkali determines the character of the
water; in some cases it is sodium carbonate, which is particularly objectionable. The continued
use of strong alkali water causes digestion disorders, because of the irritating action upon
the digestive tract. Hard waters are due to the presence of lime compounds. In regions where
limestone predominates, the carbon dioxid in water acts as a solvent, producing hard waters.
Waters that are hard on account of the presence of calcium carbonate give a deposit when boiled,
due to liberation of the carbon dioxid which is the material that renders the lime soluble.
Calcium sulphate, or gypsum, on the other hand, imparts permanent hardness. There is no deposit
when such waters are boiled. A large number of minerals are found in various waters, often
sufficient in amount to impart physiological properties. Water that is highly charged with
mineral matter is difficult to improve sufficiently for household purposes. About the only
way is by distillation.[89]

266. Organic Impurities.--Water that flows over the surface of the ground comes in contact
with animal and vegetable material in various stages of decay, and as a result some is dissolved
and some is mechanically carried along by the water. After becoming soluble, the organic matter
undergoes further chemical changes, as oxidation and nitrification caused by bacteria. If the
organic matter contain a large amount of nitrogenous material, particularly of proteid origin,
a series of chemical changes induced by bacterial action takes place, resulting in the production
of nitrites. The nitrifying organisms first produce nitrous acid products (nitrites), and in
the further development of the nitrifying process these are changed to nitrates. The ammonia
formed as the result of the decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter readily undergoes nitrification
changes. Nitrates and nitrites alone are not injurious in water, but they are usually associated
with objectionable bacteria and generally indicate previous contamination.[90]

267. Interpretation of a Water Analysis.--"Total solid matter" represents all the mineral,
vegetable, and animal matter which a water contains. It is the residue obtained by evaporating
the water to dryness at a temperature of 212° F. Average drinking water contains from 20 to
90 grains per gallon of solid matter. "Free ammonia" is that formed as a result of the decomposition
of animal or vegetable matter containing nitrogen. Water of high purity usually contains less
than 0.07 parts per million of free ammonia. "Albuminoid ammonia" is derived from the partially
decomposed animal or vegetable material in water. The greater the amount of nitrogenous organic
impurities, the higher the albuminoid ammonia. A good drinking water ought not to contain more
than 0.10 part per million of albuminoid ammonia. An abnormal quantity of chlorine indicates
surface drainage or sewage contamination, or an excess of alkaline matter, as common salt.
Nitrites should not be present, as they are generally associated with matter not completely
oxidized. Nitrites are usually considered more objectionable than nitrates; both are innocuous
unless associated with disease-producing nitroörganisms.

268. Natural Purification of Water.--River waters are sometimes dark colored because of large
amounts of dissolved organic matter, but in contact with the sun and air they gradually undergo
natural purification and the organic matter is oxidized. However, absolute reliance cannot
be placed upon natural purification of a bad water, as the objectionable organisms often have
great resistive power. There is no perfectly pure water except that prepared in the chemical
laboratory by distillation. All natural waters come in contact with the soil and air, and necessarily
contain impurities proportional to the extent of their contamination.

269. Water in Relation to Health.--There are many diseases, of which typhoid fever is a type,
that are distinctly water-born. The typhoid bacilli, present in countless numbers in the feces
of persons suffering or convalescent from typhoid fever, find their way into streams, lakes,
and wells.[91] They retain their vitality, and when they enter the digestive tract of an individual,
rapidly increase in numbers. Numerous disastrous outbreaks of typhoid fever have been traced
to contamination of water. Coupled with the sanitary improvement of a city's water supply,
there is diminution of typhoid fever cases, and a noticeable lowering of the death rate. Many
cities and villages are dependent for their water upon rivers and lakes into which surface
drainage finds its way, with all contaminating substances. Mechanical sedimentation and filtration
greatly improve waters of this class, but do not necessarily render them entirely pure. Compounds
of iron and aluminium are sometimes added in small amounts, under chemical supervision, to
such waters to precipitate the organic impurities. Spring waters are not entirely above suspicion,
as oftentimes the soil through which they flow is highly polluted. All water of doubtful purity
should be boiled, and there are but few natural waters of undoubted purity. There is no such
thing as absolutely pure water in a state of nature. The mountain streams perhaps approach
nearest to it where there are no humans to pollute the banks; but then there are always the
beasts and birds, and they, too, are subject to disease. There are very few waters that at
some time of the year and under some conditions are not contaminated with disease-producing
organisms. No matter how carefully guarded are the banks of lakes furnishing the water supply
of cities, more or less objectionable matter will get in. In seasons of heavy rains, large
amounts of surface water enter the lakes, carrying along the filth gathered from many acres
of land drained by the streams entering the lakes. Some of the most serious outbreaks of typhoid
fever have come from temporary contamination of ordinarily fairly good drinking water. In general,
too little attention is given to the purity of drinking water. It is just as important that
water should be boiled as that food should be cooked. One of the objects of cooking is to destroy
the injurious bacteria, and they are frequently more numerous in the drinking water than in
the food.

The argument is sometimes advanced that the mineral matter present in water is needed for the
construction of the bone and other tissues of the body, and that distilled water fails to supply
the necessary mineral matter. This is an erroneous assumption, as the mineral matter in the
food is more than sufficient for this purpose. When water is highly charged with mineral salts,
additional work for their elimination is called for on the part of the organs of excretion,
particularly the kidneys; and furthermore, water nearly saturated with minerals cannot exert
its full solvent action.

In discussing the immediate benefits resulting from improvement of water, Fuertes says:[92]

     "Immediately after the change to the 'four mile intake' at Chicago
     in 1893, there was a great reduction in typhoid. Lawrence, Mass.,
     showed a great improvement with the setting of the filters in
     operation in September, 1893; fully half of the deaths in 1894 were
     among persons known to have used the unfiltered canal water. The
     conclusion is warranted that for the efficient control of the death
     rate from typhoid fever it is necessary to have efficient sewerage
     and drainage, proper methods of living, and pure water. The reason
     why our large cities, which are all provided with sewerage, have
     such high death rates is therefore without doubt their continuance
     of the filthy practice of supplying drinking water which carries in
     solution and suspension the washings from farms, from the streets,
     from privies, from pigpens, and the sewage of cities.... And also
     we should recognize the importance of flies and other winged
     insects and birds which feed on offal as carriers of bacteria of
     specific diseases from points of infection to the watersheds, and
     the consequent washing of newly infected matter into our drinking
     water by rains."

There is a very close relationship between the surface water and that of shallow wells. A shallow
well is simply a reservoir for surface water accumulations. It is stated that, when an improved
system of drainage was introduced into a part of London, many of the shallow wells became dry,
indicating the source from which they received their supply. Direct subterranean connection
between cesspools and wells is often traced in the following way: A small amount of lithium,
which gives a distinct flame reaction, and a minute trace of which can be detected with the
spectroscope, is placed in the cesspool, and after a short time a lithium reaction is secured
from the well water.

Rain water is relied upon in some localities for drinking purposes. That collected in cities
and in the vicinity of barns and dwellings contains appreciable amounts of organic impurities.
The brown color is due to the impurities, ammonium carbonate being one of these. There are
also traces of nitrates and nitrites obtained from the air. When used for drinking, rain water
should be boiled.

270. Improvement of Waters.--Waters are improved by: (1) boiling, which destroys the disease-producing
organisms; (2) filtration, which removes the materials mechanically suspended in the water;
and (3) distillation, which eliminates the impurities in suspension and solution, as well as
destroys all germ life.

271. Boiling Water.--In order to destroy the bacteria that may be in drinking water, it is
not sufficient to heat the water or merely let it come to a boil. It has been found that if
water is only partially sterilized and then cooled in the open air, the bacteria develop more
rapidly than if the water had not been heated at all. It should boil vigorously five to ten
minutes; cholera and typhoid bacteria succumb in five minutes or less. Care should be taken
in cooling that the water is not exposed to dust particles from the air nor placed in open
vessels in a dirty refrigerator. It should be kept in perfectly clean, tight-stoppered bottles.
These bottles should be frequently scalded. Great reliance may be placed upon this method of
water purification when properly carried out.

272. Filtration.--Among the most efficient forms of water filters are the Berkefeld and Pasteur.
The Pasteur filter is made of unglazed porcelain, and the Berkefeld of fine infusorial earth
(finely divided SiO{2}). Both are porous and allow a moderately rapid flow of water. The flow
from the Berkefeld filter is more rapid than from the Pasteur. The mechanical impurities of
the water are deposited upon the filtering surface, due to the attraction which the material
has for particles in suspension. These particles usually are the sources of contamination and
carry bacteria. When first used, filters are satisfactory, but unless carefully looked after
they soon lose their ability to remove germs from the water and may increase the impurity by
accumulation. Small faucet filters are made of porous stone, asbestos, charcoal, etc. Many
of them are of no value whatever or are even worse than valueless. Filters should be frequently
cleansed in boiling water or in steam under pressure. Unless this is done, the filters may
become incubators for bacteria.

273. Distillation.--When an unquestionably pure water supply is desired, distillation should
be resorted to. There are many forms of stills for domestic use which are easily manipulated
and produce distilled water economically.[93] The mineral matter of water is in no way essential
for any functional purpose, and hence its removal through distillation is not detrimental.

274. Chemical Purification.--Purification of water by the use of chemicals should not be attempted
in the household or by inexperienced persons. When done under supervision of a chemist or bacteriologist,
it may be of great value to a community. Turneaure and Russell,[94] in discussing the purification
of water by addition of chemicals, state:

     "There are a considerable number of chemical substances that may be
     added to water in order to purify it by carrying down the suspended
     matter as well as bacteria, by sedimentation. Such a process of
     purification is to be seen in the addition of alum, sulphate of
     iron, and calcium hydrate to water. Methods of this character are
     directly dependent upon the flocculating action of the chemical
     added, and the removal of the bacteria is accomplished by
     subsidence."

275. Ice.--The purity of the ice supply is also of much importance. While freezing reduces
the number of organisms and lessens their vitality, it does not make an impure water absolutely
wholesome. The way, too, in which ice is often handled and stored subjects it to contamination,
and foods which are placed in direct contact with it mechanically absorb the impurities which
it contains. For cooling water, ice should be placed around rather than in it. Diseases have
frequently been traced to impure ice. The only absolutely pure ice is that made from distilled
water.

276. Mineral Waters.--When water is charged with carbonic acid gas under pressure, carbonated
water results, and when minerals, as salts of sodium, potassium, or lithium, are added, artificial
mineral waters are produced. Natural mineral waters are placed on the market to some extent,
but most mineral waters are artificial products and they are sometimes prepared from water
of low sanitary character. Mineral waters should not be used extensively except under medical
direction, as many have pronounced medicinal properties. Some of the constituents are bicarbonates
of sodium, potassium, and lithium; sulphates of magnesium (Epsom salts) and calcium; and chloride
of sodium. The sweetened mineral waters, as lemonade, orangeade, ginger ale, and beer, contain
sugar and organic acids, as citric and tartaric, and are flavored with natural or artificial
products. Most of them are prepared without either fruit or ginger. Natural mineral waters
used under the direction of a physician are often beneficial in cases of chronic digestion
disorders or other diseases.

277. Materials for Softening Water.--The materials most commonly used for softening water are
sodium carbonate (washing soda), borax, ammonia, ammonium carbonate, potash, and soda lye.
Waters that are very hard with limestone should have a small amount of washing soda added to
them. Two ounces for a large tub of water is the most that should be used, and it should first
be dissolved in a little water. If too much soda is used, it is injurious, as only a certain
amount can be utilized for softening the water, and the excess simply injures the hands and
fabric. When hard limewater is boiled and a very little soda lye added, a precipitate of carbonate
of lime is formed, and then if the water is strained, it is greatly improved for washing purposes.
Borax is valuable for making some hard waters soft. It is not as strong in its action as is
sodium carbonate. For the hardest water 1/4 pound of borax to a large tubful may be used; most
waters, however, do not need so much. Ammonia is one of the most useful reagents for softening
water. It is better than washing soda and borax, because the ammonia is volatile and does not
leave any residue to act on the clothes, thus causing injury. For bathing purposes, the water
should be softened with ammonia, in preference to any other material. Ammonia should not be
poured directly into hot water; it should be added to the water while cold, or to a small quantity
of cold water, and then to the warm water, as this prevents the ammonia from vaporizing too
readily. Ammonia produces the same effect as potash or soda lye, without leaving a residue
in the garments washed. It is especially valuable in washing woolen goods or materials liable
to shrink. Waters which are hard with alum salts are greatly benefited by the addition of ammonia.
A little in such a water will cause a precipitate to form, and when the water is strained it
is in good condition for cleaning purposes. Ammonium carbonate is used to some extent as a
softening and cleaning agent, and is valuable, as there is no injurious effect upon clothing,
because it readily volatilizes. Caustic potash and caustic soda are sometimes employed for
softening water, but they are very active and are not adapted to washing colored or delicate
fabrics. They may be used for very heavy and coarse articles that are greasy,--not more than
a gram in a gallon of water. Bleaching powder is not generally a safe material for cleansing
purposes, as it weakens the texture of clothing. After a contagious disease, articles may be
soaked in water containing a little bleaching powder and a few drops of carbolic acid, followed
by thorough rinsing and bleaching in the sun. But as a rule formaline is preferable for disinfecting
clothing. It can be used at the rate of about one pound to 100 gallons of water. Bleaching
powder, caustic potash or soda, and strong soap are not suitable for cleaning woodwork, because
of the action of the alkali on paint and wood; they roughen the surface and discolor the paint.
Waters vary so in composition, that a material suitable for softening one may not prove to
be the best for softening another. The special kind must be determined largely by trial, and
it should be the aim to use as little as possible. When carbolic acid, formaline, bleaching
powder, and caustic soda are used, the hands should be protected and the clothes should be
well rinsed.

278. Economic Value of a Pure Water Supply.--From a financial point of view, the money spent
in securing pure water is one of the best investments a community can make. Statisticians estimate
the death of an adult results in a loss to the state of from $1000 to $5000; and to the losses
sustained by death must be added those incurred by sickness and by lessened quality and quantity
of work through impaired vitality,--all caused by using poor drinking water. Wherever plants
have been installed for improving the sanitary condition of the water supply, the death rate
has been lowered and the returns to the community have been far greater than the cost of the
plant. Impure water is the most expensive food that can be consumed.

CHAPTER XX

FOOD AS AFFECTED BY HOUSEHOLD SANITATION AND STORAGE

279. Injurious Compounds in Foods.--An ordinary chemical analysis of a food determines only
the nutrients, as protein, carbohydrates, and fats; and unless there is reason to believe the
food contains injurious substances no special tests for these are made. There are a number
of poisonous compounds that foods may contain, and many of them can but imperfectly be determined
by chemical analysis. Numerous organic compounds are produced in foods as the result of the
workings of microörganisms; some of these are poisonous, while others impart only special characteristics,
as taste and odor. The poisonous bacteria finding their way into food produce organic compounds
of a toxic character; and hence it is that the sanitary condition of a food, as influenced
by preparation and storage, is often of more vital importance than the nutrient content.[95]

280. Sources of Contamination of Food.--As a rule, too little attention is given to the sanitary
handling and preparation of foods. They are often exposed to impure air and to the dust and
filth from unclean streets and surroundings, and as a result they become inoculated with bacteria,
which are often the disease-producing kind. Gelatine plates exposed by bacteriologists under
the same conditions as foods develop large numbers of injurious microörganisms. In order to
avoid contamination in the handling of food, there must be: (1) protection from impure air
and dust; (2) storage in clean, sanitary, and ventilated storerooms and warehouses; (3) storage
of perishable foods at a low temperature so as to retard fermentation changes; and (4) workmen
free from contagious diseases in all occupations pertaining to the preparation of foods. Ordinarily,
foods should not be stored in the paper wrappers in which they are purchased, as unclean paper
is often a source of contamination.

281. Sanitary Inspection of Food.--During recent years some state and city boards of health
have introduced sanitary inspection of foods, with a view of preventing contamination during
manufacture and transportation, and this has done much to improve the quality and wholesomeness.
Putrid meats, fish, and vegetables are not allowed to be sold, and foods are required to be
handled and stored in a sanitary way. Next to a pure water supply, there is no factor that
so greatly influences for good the health of a community as the sanitary condition of the food.
While the cooking of foods destroys many organisms, it often fails to render innocuous the
poisons which they produce, and furthermore the unsound foods when cooked are not entirely
wholesome, and they have poor keeping qualities.

Often meats, vegetables, and other foods eaten uncooked, as well as the numerous cooked foods,
are exposed in dirty market places, and accumulate large amounts of filth, and are inoculated
with disease germs by flies. Protection of food from flies is a matter of vital importance,
as they are carriers of many diseases. In the case of typhoid fever, next to impure drinking
water flies are credited with being the greatest distributors of the disease germs.[96]

282. Infection from Impure Air.--The dust particles of the air contain decayed animal and vegetable
matter in which bacteria are present; these find their way into the food when it is not carefully
protected, into the water supply, and also into the lungs and other organs of the body. When
foods are protected from the mechanical impurities which gain access through the air, and fermentation
is delayed by storage at a low temperature, digestion disorders are greatly lessened. From
a sanitary point of view, the air of food storerooms and of living rooms should be of equally
high purity. When foods are kept in unventilated living rooms, they become contaminated with
the impurities thrown off from the lungs in respiration, which include not only carbon dioxid,
but the more objectionable toxic organic materials.

Vegetable foods need to be stored in well-ventilated places, as the plant cells are still alive
and carrying on life functions, as the giving off of carbon dioxid, which is akin to animal
respiration; in fact, it is plant-cell respiration. Provision should be made for the removal
of the carbon dioxid and other products, as they contaminate the air. When vegetable tissue
ceases to produce carbon dioxid, death and decay set in, accompanied by fermentation changes.

283. Storage of Food in Cellars.--Cellars are often in a very unsanitary condition, damp, poorly
lighted, unventilated, and the air filled with floating particles from decaying vegetables.
The walls and shelves absorb the dust and germs from the foul air and are bacterially contaminated,
and whenever a sound food is stored in such a cellar, it readily becomes inoculated with bacteria.
There is a much closer relationship existing between the atmosphere of the cellar and that
of the house than is generally realized. An unclean cellar means contaminated air throughout
the house. When careful attention is given to the sanitary condition of the cellar, many of
the more common diseases are greatly reduced. Cases of rheumatism have often been traced to
a damp cellar. In some localities where the cellars are unusually unsanitary, there is in the
season of spring rains, when they are especially damp and contain the maximum of decayed vegetation,
a prevalence of what might be called "cellaritis." The symptoms differ and the trouble is variously
attributed, but the real cause is the same, although overlooked, for, unfortunately, doctors
do not visit the cellar.

Cellars should be frequently cleaned and disinfected, using for the purpose some of the well-known
disinfectants, as formaline, bleaching powder, or a dilute solution of carbolic acid. It has
been found in large cities, when the spread of such diseases as yellow fever was imminent,
that a general and thorough cleaning up of streets and cellars with the improved sanitary conditions
resulting greatly lowered the usual death rate.

284. Sunlight, Pure Water, and Pure Air as Disinfectants.--The most effectual and valuable
disinfectants are sunlight, pure water, and pure air. Many kinds of microörganisms, particularly
those that are disease-producing, are destroyed when exposed for a time to sunlight. The chemical
action of the sun's rays is destructive to the organic material which makes up the composition
of many of these organisms, while higher forms of organic life are stirred into activity by
it. The disinfecting power of sunlight should be made use of to the fullest extent, not only
in the house, but plenty of sunlight should also be planned for in constructing barns and other
buildings where milk-and meat-producing animals are kept. Pure water is also a disinfectant,
but when water becomes polluted it loses this power. Many disease-producing organisms are rendered
inactive when placed in pure water. Water contains more dissolved oxygen than air, and apparently
a portion of the oxygen in water is in a more active condition than that in air. Pure air,
too, is a disinfectant; the ozone and hydrogen peroxide and oxides of nitrogen, which are present
in traces, exert a beneficial influence in oxidizing organic matter. Fresh air and sunlight,
acting jointly, are nature's most effectual disinfectants. Sunshine, fresh air, and pure water
are a health-producing trinity. In discussing the importance of pure air, water, and sunlight,
Ellen H. Richards[97] says:

     "The country dweller surrounds his house with evergreens or shade
     trees, the city dweller is surrounded with high brick walls.
     Blinds, shades, or thick draperies shut out still more, and prevent
     the beneficial sunlight from acting its role of germ prevention and
     germ destruction. Bright-colored carpets and pale-faced children
     are the opposite results which follow. Sunlight, pure air, and pure
     water are our common birthright which we often bargain away for
     so-called comforts."

And Dr. Woods Hutchinson says of sunlight:

     "It is a splendid and matchless servant in the promoting of
     healthfulness of the house, for which no substitute has yet been
     discovered. It is the foe alike of bacilli and the blues; the best
     tonic ever yet invented for the liver and for the scalp, and for
     everything between, the only real complexion restorer, and the
     deadliest foe of dirt and disease."

285. Utensils for Storage of Food.--In order that dishes and household utensils may be kept
in the best sanitary condition, they should be free from seams, cracks, and crevices where
dust and dirt particles can find lodgment. From the seams of a milk pail that has not been
well washed, decaying milk solids can be removed with the aid of a pin or a toothpick. This
material acts as a "starter" or culture when pure, fresh milk is placed in the pail, contaminating
it and causing it to become sour. Not only is this true of milk, but also of other foods. Wooden
utensils are not satisfactory for the handling, storage, or preparation of foods, as it is
difficult to keep wood in a sanitary condition. Uncleanliness of dishes in which foods are
placed is too often caused by the use of foul dishcloths and failure to thoroughly wash and
rinse the dishes. It is always well to rinse dishes with scalding water, as colds and skin
diseases may be communicated from the edges of drinking glasses, and from forks and spoons,
and, unless the dish towels are kept scrupulously clean, it is more sanitary to drain the dishes
than to wipe them.

286. Contamination from Unclean Dishcloths.--When the dishcloth is foul, the fat absorbed by
the fibers becomes rancid, the proteids undergo putrefaction changes with formation of ill-smelling
gases containing nitrogen, the carbohydrates ferment and are particularly attractive to flies,
and all the various disease germs collected on the surface of the dishcloth are, along with
the rancid fat and other putrifying materials, distributed over the surface of the dishes with
which the cloth comes in contact.

287. Refrigeration.--At a low temperature the insoluble or unorganized ferments become inactive,
but the chemical ferments or enzymes are still capable of carrying on fermentation. Thus it
is that a food, when placed in a refrigerator or in cold storage, continues to undergo chemical
change. An example of such enzymic action is the curing of beef and cheese in cold storage.
A small amount of ventilation is required when foods are refrigerated, just sufficient to keep
up a slight circulation of air. It seems not to be generally understood that all fermentation
changes do not cease when food is placed in refrigerators, and this often leads to neglect
in their care. Cleanliness is equally as essential, or more so, in the refrigeration of food
as in its handling in other ways. Too often the refrigerator is neglected, milk and other food
is spilt, filling the cracks, and slow decomposition sets in. A well-cared-for refrigerator
is an important factor in the preservation of food, but when it is neglected, it becomes a
source of contamination. Unclean vegetables and food receptacles, impure ice and foul air,
are the most common forms of contamination. The chemical changes which foods undergo during
refrigeration are such as result in softening of the tissues.

288. Soil.--The soil about dwellings and places where foods are stored frequently becomes polluted
with decaying animal and vegetable matter, and in such soils disease-producing organisms readily
find lodgment. Poorly drained soils containing an excess of vegetable matter furnish a medium
in which the tapeworm and the germs of typhoid fever, lockjaw, and various diseases affecting
the digestive tract, may propagate. The wind carries the dust particles from these contaminated
places into unprotected food, where they cause fermentation changes and the disease germs multiply.
In considering the sanitary condition of a locality, the character of the soil is an important
factor. Whenever there is reason to suspect that a soil is unsanitary, it should be disinfected
with lime or formaldehyde. Soils about dwellings need care and frequent disinfecting to keep
them in a sanitary condition, equally as much as do the rooms in the dwellings.[99] In the
growing of garden vegetables, frequently large quantities of fertilizers of unsanitary character
are used, and vegetables often retain mechanically on their surfaces particles of these. To
this dirt clinging to the vegetables have been traced diseases, as typhoid fever and various
digestion disorders.

289. Disposal of Kitchen Refuse.--Refuse, as vegetable parings, bones, and meat scraps, unless
they are used for food for animals or collected as garbage, should preferably be burned; then
there is no danger of their furnishing propagating media for disease germs. Garbage cans should
be kept clean, and well covered to protect the contents from flies. Where the refuse cannot
be burned, it should be composted. For this, a well-drained place should be selected, and the
refuse should be kept covered with earth to keep off the flies and absorb the odors that arise
from the fermenting material, and to prevent its being carried away by the wind. Lime should
be sprinkled about the compost heap, and from time to time it should be drawn away and the
place covered with clean earth. It is very unsanitary to throw all of the kitchen refuse in
the same place year after year without resorting to any means for keeping the soil in a sanitary
condition. Although composting refuse is not as sanitary as burning, it is far more sanitary
than neglecting to care for it at all, as is too frequently the case.

Ground polluted with kitchen refuse containing large amounts of fatty material and soap becomes
diseased, so that the natural fermentation changes fail to take place, and the soil becomes
"sewage sick" and gets in such a condition that vegetation will not grow. Failure to properly
dispose of kitchen refuse is frequently the cause of the spread of germ diseases, through the
dust and flies that are attracted by the material and carry the germs from the refuse pile to food.

Where there is no drainage system, disposal of the liquid refuse is a serious problem. Drain
basins and cesspools are often resorted to, and these may become additional sources of contamination.
As stated in the chapter on well water, direct communication is frequently established between
such places and shallow wells. Where the only place for the disposal of waste water is the
surface of the ground, it should be thrown some distance from the house and where it will drain
from and not toward the well. The land should be well drained and open to the sunlight. Coarse
sand and lime should be sprinkled over it frequently, and occasionally the soil should be removed
and replaced with fresh. Sunlight, aëration, and disinfection of the soil and good drainage
are necessary, in order to keep in a sanitary condition the place where the dish water is thrown.

Poor plumbing is often the cause of contaminated food. The gases which escape from unclean
traps may carry with them solid particles of organic matter in various stages of decay. The
"house side" of traps always ventilates into the rooms, and hence it is important that they
be kept scrupulously clean. Where the drip pipe from the refrigerator drains directly into
the sewerage system, there is always danger. Special attention should be given to the care
of plumbing near places where foods are stored. Frequently there are leaky joints due to settling
of the dwellings or to extreme changes in temperature, and the plumbing should be occasionally
inspected by one familiar with the subject.[100]

290. General Considerations.--In order to keep food in the most wholesome condition, special
care should be taken that all of its surroundings are sanitary. The air, the dishes in which
the food is placed, the refrigerator, cellar or closet where stored, and the other food with
which it comes in contact, all influence the wholesomeness or cause contamination. A food may
contain sufficient nutrients to give it high value, and yet, on account of products formed
during fermentation, be poisonous. Foods are particularly susceptible to putrefaction changes,
and chemicals and preservatives added as preventives, with a view of retarding these changes,
are objectionable, besides failing to prevent all fermentation from taking place. Intelligent
thought should be exercised in the care of food, for the health of the consumer is largely
dependent upon the purity and wholesomeness of the food supply.

Before performing an experiment, the student is advised to review those topics presented in
the text which have a bearing upon the experiment, so that a clear conception may be gained
of the relationship between the laboratory work and that of the class room. The student should
endeavor to cultivate the power of observation and to grasp the principle involved in the work,
rather than do it in a merely mechanical and perfunctory way. Neatness is one of the essentials
for success in laboratory practice, and too much emphasis cannot be laid upon this requisite
to good work. The student should learn to use his time in the laboratory profitably and economically.
He should obtain a clear idea of what he is to do, and then do it to the best of his ability.
If the experiment is not a success, repeat it. While the work is in progress it should be given
undivided attention. Care should be exercised to prevent anything getting into the sinks that
will clog the plumbing; soil, matches, broken glass, and paper should be deposited in the waste
jars.

A careful record of the experiments should be kept by each student in a suitable note-book.
It is suggested that those students desiring more time in writing out the experiments than
the laboratory period affords, take notes as they make the various tests, and then amplify
and rearrange them in the evening study time. The final writing up of the notes should, however,
be done before the next laboratory period. Careful attention should be given to the spelling,
language, and punctuation, and the note-book should represent the student's individual work.
He who attempts to cheat by copying the results of others, only cheats himself. In recording
the results of an experiment, the student should state briefly and clearly the following:

  1. Number and title of experiment.
  2. How the experiment is performed.
  3. What was observed.
  4. What the experiment proves.

Directions for Weighing.--Place the dish or material to be weighed in the left-hand pan of
the balance. With the forceps lay a weight from the weight box on the right-hand pan. Do not
touch the weights with the hands. If the weight selected is too heavy, replace it with a lighter
weight. Add weights until the pans are counterpoised; this will be indicated by the needle
swinging nearly as many divisions on one side of the scale as on the other. The brass weights
are the gram weights. The other weights are fractions of a gm. The 500, 200, 100 mg. (milligram)
weights are recorded as 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1 gm. The 50, 20, and 10 mg. weights as 0.05, 0.02,
and 0.01 gm. If the 10, and 2 gm., and the 200, the 100, and the 50 mg. weights are used, the
resulting weight is 12.35 gms. No moist substances should ever come in contact with the scale
pans. The weights and forceps should always be replaced in the weight box. Too much care and
neatness cannot be exercised in weighing.

Directions for Measuring.--Reagents are measured in graduated cylinders (see Fig. 74). When
the directions call for the addition of 5 or 10 cc. of a reagent, unless so directed it is
not absolutely necessary to measure the reagent in a measuring cylinder. A large test tube
holds about 30 cc. of water. Measure out 5 cc. of water and transfer it to a large test tube.
Note its volume. Add approximately 5 cc. of water directly to the test tube. Measure it. Repeat
this operation until you can judge with a fair degree of accuracy the part of a test tube filled
by 5 cc. In the experiments where a burette is used for measuring reagents, the burette is
first filled with the reagent by means of a funnel. The tip of the burette is allowed to fill
before the readings are made, which are from the lowest point or meniscus. When reagents are
removed from bottles, the stopper should be held between the first and second fingers of the
right hand (see Fig. 75). Hold the test tube or receptacle that is to receive the reagent in
the left hand. Pour the liquid slowly until the desired amount is secured. Before inserting
the stopper, touch it to the neck of the bottle to catch the few drops on the edge, thus preventing
their streaking down the sides of the bottle on to the shelf. Replace the bottle in its proper
place. Every precaution should be taken to prevent contamination of reagents.

Use of the Microscope.--Special directions in the use of the microscope will be given by the
instructor. The object or material to be examined is placed on a microscopical slide. Care
should be exercised to secure a representative sample, and to properly distribute the substance
on the slide. If a pulverized material is to be examined, use but little and spread it in as
thin a layer as possible. If a liquid, one or two drops placed on the slide will suffice. The
material on the slide is covered with a cover glass, before it is placed on the stage of the
microscope. In focusing, do not allow the object glass of the microscope to come in contact
with the cover glass. Focus upward, not downward. Special care should be exercised in focusing
and in handling the eye-piece and objective. A camel's-hair brush, clean dry chamois skin,
or clean silk only should be used in polishing the lenses. Always put the microscope back in
its case after using.

Experiment No. 1

Water in Flour

Carefully weigh a porcelain or aluminum dish. (Porcelain must be used if the ash is to be determined
on the same sample.) Place in it about 2 gm. of flour; record the weight; then place the dish
in the water oven for at least 6 hours. After drying, weigh again, and from the loss of weight
calculate the per cent of water in the flour. (Weight of flour and dish before drying minus
weight of flour and dish after drying equals weight of water lost. Weight of water divided
by weight of flour taken, multiplied by 100, equals the per cent of water in the flour.)

How does the amount of water you obtained compare with the amount given in the tables of analysis?

Experiment No. 2

Water in Butter

Carefully weigh a clean, dry aluminum dish, place in it about 2 gms. of butter, and weigh again.
Record the weights. Place the dish containing butter in the water oven for 5 or 6 hours and
then weigh. The loss in weight represents the water in the butter. Calculate the per cent of
water. Care must be taken to get a representative sample of the butter to be tested; preferably
small amounts should be taken with the butter trier from various parts of the package.

Experiment No. 3

Ash in Flour

Place the porcelain dish containing flour from the preceding experiment in a muffle furnace

to neutralize the citric acid in the lemon juice. Calculate the per cent of citric acid.

(1 cc. of N/10 KOH solution equals 0.00642 gm. citric acid. 1 cc. of H{2}O weighs 1 gm. Because
of sugar and other matter in solution 1 cc. of lemon juice weighs approximately 1.03 gm.)

1. What is the characteristic acid of lemons? 2. What is the salt formed when the lemon juice
is neutralized by the KOH solution? 3. Describe briefly the process for determining the acidity
of lemon juice. 4. What per cent of acidity did you obtain? 5. How does this compare with the

Experiment No. 10

Lemon Extract

To 5 cc. of the extract in a test tube add an equal volume of water. A cloudy appearance indicates
the presence of lemon oil. If the solution remains clear after adding the water, the extract
does not contain lemon oil.

Why does the extract containing lemon oil become cloudy on adding water?

Experiment No. 11

Vanilla Extract

Pour into a test tube 5 cc. of the extract to be tested. Evaporate to one third. Then add sufficient
water to restore the original volume. If a brown, flocculent precipitate is formed, the sample
contains pure vanilla extract. Resin is present in vanilla beans and is extracted in the essence.
The resin is readily soluble in 50 per cent alcohol. If the alcohol is removed from the extract,
the excess of resin is precipitated, or if free from alkali, it may be precipitated by diluting
the original solution with twice its volume of water. Test the two samples and compare.

cent solution of potassium bisulphate and a piece of white woolen cloth which has previously
been boiled in a 0.1 per cent solution of NaOH and thoroughly washed in water. Remove the cloth
from the solution, wash in boiling water, and dry between pieces of filter paper. A bright
red indicates coal tar dye. If the coloring matter is entirely from fruit, the woolen cloth
will be either uncolored or will have a faint pink or brown color which is changed to green
or yellow by ammonia and is not restored by washing. This is the Arata test.

with water.

Experiment No. 19

Testing for Oleomargarine

Apply the following tests to two samples of the material:

Boiling or Spoon Test.--Melt the sample to be tested--a piece about the size of a chestnut--in
a large spoon, hastening the process by stirring with a splinter. Then, increasing the heat,
bring to as brisk a boil as possible and stir thoroughly, not neglecting the outer edges. Oleomargarine
and renovated butter boil noisily, sputtering like a mixture of grease and water, and produce
no foam, or but very little. Genuine butter boils with less noise and produces an abundance
of foam.

Waterhouse Test.--Into a small beaker pour 50 cc. of sweet milk. Heat nearly to boiling and
add from 5 to 10 gms. of butter or oleomargarine. Stir with a glass rod until fat is melted.
Then place the beaker in cold water and stir the milk until the temperature falls sufficiently
for the fat to congeal. At this point the fat, if oleomargarine, can easily be collected into
one lump by means of the rod; while if butter, it will granulate and cannot be collected.

  (From Farmers' Bul. 131, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.)

Experiment No. 20

Testing for Watering or Skimming of Milk

a. Fat Content of Milk by Means of Babcock Test.--Measure with pipette into test bottle 17.6
cc. of milk. Sample should be carefully taken and well mixed. Measure with cylinder 17.5 cc.
commercial H{2}SO{4} and add to milk in test bottle. (See Fig. 25.) Mix acid and milk by rotating
the bottle. Then place test bottles in centrifugal machine and whirl 5 minutes. Add sufficient
hot water to test bottles to bring contents up to about the 8th mark on stem. Then whirl bottles
2 minutes longer and read fat. Read from extreme lowest to highest point. Each large division
as 1 to 2 represents a whole per cent, each small division 0.2 of a per cent.

b. Determining Specific Gravity by Means of Lactometer.--Pour 150 cc. of milk into 200 cc.
cylinder. Place lactometer in milk and note depth to which it sinks as indicated on stem. Note
also temperature of milk. For each 10° above 60° F. add 1 to the lactometer number, in order
to make the necessary correction for temperature. For example, if milk has sp. gr. of 1.032
at temperature of 70°, it will be equivalent to sp. gr. of 1.033 at 60°. Ordinarily milk has
a sp. gr. of 1.029 to 1.034. If milk has sp. gr. less than 1.029, or contains less than 3 per
cent fat, it may be considered watered milk. If the milk has a high sp. gr. (above 1.035) and
a low content of fat, some of the fat has been removed.

  (For extended direction for milk testing see Snyder's "Dairy Chemistry.")

Qualitative Tests for Minerals in Water

Test for Chlorids.--To 10 cc. of H{2}O add a few drops of HNO{3} and 2 cc. of AgNO{3}. A white
precipitate indicates the presence of chlorids, usually in the form of sodium chlorid.

Test for Sulphates.--To 10 cc. of water add 2 cc. of dilute HCl and 2 cc. of BaCl{2}. A cloudiness
or the formation of a white precipitate indicates the presence of sulphates.
