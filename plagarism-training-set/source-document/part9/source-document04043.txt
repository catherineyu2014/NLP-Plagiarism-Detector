According to all accounts, the Allied position in the west, especially the British section
thereof, is  as "safe as the Bank of  England," to use the words  of one  of  our officers
already quoted;  and  though the  Kaiser, recovered from his illness, has again returned to
the front--or, at least. the distant rear of the front--he does not seem to have much refreshed
the offensive  spirit of  his armies.  Nevertheless, the  French communiqués have suffered
from no great diminution  in the daily records  of sporadic trench-fighting all along  the
Allied line--fighting of  a fluctuating, if on the whole  favourable, kind for the strategic
plans  of General Joffre, as to whom, one  German officer in Belgium said that he  wished to
God his country had such  a War Lord, seeing that, apart  from Marshal Hindenburg, all their
Generals were only worthy of disdain.

In  a telegram  to his  aunt,  the Dowager  Grand Duchess  of Baden,  only daughter of the
old Emperor William, the Kaiser gave "God alone the glory" for a grand victory which was supposed
to have been achieved by Hindenburg over the  Russians in front  of Warsaw--a  victory which
caused  Berlin to burst out into bunting and braying  and comparisons to Salamis and Leipzig
in its  momentous results. But  this acknowledgment  of the Kaiser  to the Lord  of  Hosts,
"our  old  ally of  Rossbach"--which  must  surely  have inspired  Hindenburg himself  with
a  feeling of  jealousy  and sense  of soreness--turned out to have been  altogether premature,
and of the nature of shouting before they were out of the wood.

For a  fortnight or so the  fighting in Poland  continued to be of  a very confused kind, the
telegrams from both sides being most contradictory, but on  the whole  the  advantage  seemed
to  remain  with  the Russians,  who recorded their victories  in very striking figures of
killed and captured during their  defence of several  rivers tributary  to the Vistula  on
its left bank. Fate made  the Château,  with the small adjoining  village, for upwards  of
eight weeks a  disputed tactical point between the Germans and the Allies, a narrow strip of
only 150 yards of ground  intervening between  the trenches.  The Germans  held Vermelles from
October 16  until  early  in December,  fortifying  the Château  and grounds. They had  to
be shelled out  By October 21, the  Château was only smouldering walls, and French engineers
were mining approaches to it. Then an English  heavy battery  bombarded Vermelles. Finally
the French  "in a very brilliant attack," stormed and took Vermelles, village and château.
For  years past, as  head of various administrative  departments in Egypt,  he devoted his
energies to improving the lot of the natives, by  whom he is called "the Father of the Fellaheen."

General Oscar Potiorek commanded the Austrian Army invading Serbia. Elated at  occupying Belgrade
without firing  a shot,  he promised  his Imperial master  at  Vienna that  in  a  fortnight
Serbia  would be  conquered.  A Field-Marshal's baton  and the  highest Austrian military 
decoration were bestowed  on  him. Within  a  week  Potiorek's  army were  fugitives.  The
Field-Marshal is to be court-martialled.  After describing  the earlier  part  of the  action,
he  writes: "By  now  her  three  funnels  and   her  foremast  had  been  shot  away, and
she  was on  fire  aft.  We turned  again,  and  after giving  her  a salvo  or  two with 
the  starboard  guns, saw  her  run  ashore on  North Keeling  Island. So  at 11.20  a.m. we
ceased firing,  the action  having lasted  one hour  forty  minutes." Later,  the writer  of
the letter  was sent  in  a  cutter to  the  "Emden"  to  arrange  for the  surrender  and
taking  off the  wounded.  "From  the number  of  men we  rescued--i.e., 150,"  he  continues,
"we  have  been  able  to   reckon  their  losses.

                                                    [Continued opposite.  As  regards  the  fate  of  the
German  landing-party, he  says: "Early  in the  morning we  made for  the
cable-station, to find that the party landed by the Germans to destroy the
station had seized a schooner and  departed. The poor devils aren't likely
to  go far  with a  leaking ship  and the  leathers removed  from all  the
pumps." It  may be  that the vessel  seen on the  right in  the right-hand
photograph is the  one in which they  escaped. It consists of a  chain of electric lamps
laid under water  to mark the navigable channel, connected  by an electric
cable controlled  from the  shore. In  time of war,  of course,  the light
would  be switched  on only  when a  friendly vessel  was signalled.--[By

This  method of  stopping  the inrush  of  water was  tested  on the  U.S. battle-ship "North
Carolina." An American  naval officer wrote:  "Its use will  permit  us  to  repair  from 
inside  all  holes  made  beneath  the water-line. Strong pressure is exerted  in the holed
compartment; slighter pressure, graduated, in those adjacent (shaded darker)."--[By Courtesy

samples of the  dinner he has prepared. These are  tasted by the officers, and, with  a hearty
exchange  of good  wishes, the procession  passes from table  to  table. It  is  stated  that
the  officers  of  the Grand  Fleet collectively  subscribed to  provide  Christmas dinners
at  home for  the children  of their  men.  It  is certain  that  friends  at home  provided
Christmas fare for the crews in the North Sea. Here we see a suspect being  brought through
the French lines after having been found  in a  suspicious position  near our  Allies' artillery.

The British officer, who is once more showing what a magnificent sportsman and fighter he is
in the field, is not altogether  neglecting sport as he knows it at home  while he is at the
front. As the  troops passed the  Konak, the building in the background with a  cupola, they
sang the Austrian national anthem. General  Frank sent the  following message to the  Emperor
Francis Joseph: "On the occasion of  the sixty-sixth anniversary of your Majesty's accession
permit me to lay at  your feet the information that Belgrade was to-day occupied  by the troops
of the  Fifth Army." Belgrade  remained in Austrian hands less  than a fortnight. The Serbians
recaptured  it after a desperate  battle.  At Belgrade  they  placed  60,000 Austrians  hors
de combat, and  from December 3 to  15 had captured 274  officers and 46,000 men. In the distance
the  smoke of her burning is seen going up to heaven. The  blockade of Tsing-tau began on August
27. The Japanese  troops landed  in Lao-shan  Bay on  September 18,  the small British force
on the 24th. On the  28th they carried the high ground 2-1/2 miles from the  main German position,
and fire was  opened on the fortress during the first week in October. The general bombardment
began on October 31 and lasted till the night of  November 6, when the Japanese stormed the
central fort.  The  gun-team of  artillerymen  are  standing  in rear  of  the piece,  and
in  the foreground,  to the  right, is  one of  the detachment receiving orders by  telephone
from the battery-commandant at  his post of observation.  Profiting  by their  experiences
in  siege-warfare at  Port Arthur, the Japanese  were fully prepared with a very  large and
efficient siege-gun train to  undertake the attack on Tsing-tau  immediately war was declared.
Particularly has this been the case  during the  battles in  Northern France  and Flanders,
wherever the trenches approached one  another within flinging distance.  There also, on occasion,
where the  troops facing  one another  were further  apart, and beyond reach  of a throw  by
hand, an  improvised catapult of  the classic type has  been devised  by our  men for  slinging
hand-bombs;  utilising a metal spring  bent back and held  fast in a  notch, to be released
on the lighting  of the  fuse.  An illustration  of a  catapult  appeared in  the "Illustrated
War News" of December 23. The grenades are shown in the act  of being introduced into the breech
of the weapons, and the apparatus  for holding each grenade  in the hand is  clearly shown.
In the photograph  above the shells are  seen bursting at a  certain distance from the firing-point.
Our soldiers in the trenches in Flanders, according to  "Eye-Witness,"  have  made improvised
hand-grenades  for  themselves, utilising empty jam-tins. These are charged with gun-cotton
and fused, and on being  lighted are flung  across among  the Germans in  their trenches. What
the jam-tin  hand-grenades  look like  the  "War News"  illustration referred to shows, and
how they are used with catapults. The Canal  is securely held along its hundred miles of  length.
Our illustration shows one of the several  British  advanced-camps  on  the eastern  bank 
(the  Asiatic  or Sinaitic Peninsula  side), placed there  to prevent a surprise  attack. In
all  cases, our  positions are  well fortified,  and, with  the desert  in front,  present
a  formidable  barrier to  the enemy.  In  support of  the entrenched camps, movable pontoon-bridges
have been constructed at certain points. Friedrich Karl, released  on the proclamation of peace,
decorated with the  Cross of the Legion of Honour, and retired to  the little farm, where she
ended her days. The spirit of this romance of the Franco-German War of 1870-71 lives in the
picture by E.J. Delahaye. Chivalry  was not then dead, and the "Red Prince," father  of our
popular Duchess  of Connaught,  although Juliette Dodu had hindered the  German advance on
Paris, shook her  by the hand and said that it was "an honour to meet so brave a woman." It
was  stated  unofficially  in a  report  from Budapest that the southern Austro-Hungarian 
Army had lost over 60,000 men killed  and wounded  during the  rear-guard  actions and  the
flight,  and about  35,000 prisoners,  together with  a large  amount of  guns and  war material.
Many of the Austrian soldiers, it  is said, dropped  by the way  from fatigue and  weakness,
as they had had  neither food nor rest,  and several of the  officers did the same. It  was
impossible for some  parts of the  army to make a  stand, as their artillery had been obliged
to  remain behind owing to the exhaustion of  the horses.  Only  those of  the Austrian  regiments
which had  their supply-wagons with them were able to reach the Bosnian frontier. At Rabaul,
New Britain, on the 13th, a  British Proclamation was read, with a special one in "pidgin"
English for the natives. The  German Acting-Governor, Dr. Haber, surrendered  on the 21st.
Our photographs show: (1)  German troops marching  into  Herbertshöhe  to  surrender;  (2)
A  German  building  at Friedrich  Wilhelmshafen, now  garrison headquarters;  (3) The  Australian
Naval Brigade marching through Rabaul; and  (4) Dr. Haber, followed by the German Commander,
riding into Herbertshöhe to surrender. King Gustav was the convener  of the meeting, the object
of which was  to arrive  at an  understanding by  means of  which the  Scandinavian countries
might be  able to draw closer together in  view of the interests common to them all as neutrals.
The  "reversion" takes  many shapes,  and  we have  seen  instances of  it  during the  war
in  various ways.  It  is  surely readily  recognisable,  for example,  in that  spirit  of
sheer   ruthlessness  which  inspired  the  perpetration of  the  inhuman  outrages  that 
have laid  Belgium  waste,  and  of  the killing of  harmless women and  children by  naval
shells at  the peaceful watering-place  of  Scarborough.  Another   and  more  innocuous  form
of going  back to  the  habits  and methods  typical  of  primitive man,  is, perhaps,  traceable
in  the  illustrations given  above. In very much the same way, as modern exploration has brought
to light, the primaeval cave-dwelling  inhabitants of  Europe in prehistoric  times left rudimentary
traces  of their presence  in certain  places in the  shape of carvings and roughly  painted
"portraits" of themselves,  of the creatures they  hunted  for  food  and  fought with,  and
of  the  implements  they used.  According to  the  German  newspaper from  which  we reproduce
the illustrations given here, they are the work of a German artist who has had to go to  the
Front as a conscript  and serve in the ranks  of an infantry battalion. There, with a hastily
raised commando at his heels, he forcibly seized the place and, after  submitting the local
officials  to brutal ill-treatment, in a wild, incendiary  speech called on the Dutch of  South
Africa to rise in arms  against the  British Government.  It was at  Winburg that  De Wet performed,
as  it is  stated,  the  theatrical  and unworthy  outrage  of trampling on and tearing the
Union Jack. The identical flag which suffered the maltreatment is shown in our photograph,
in the state in which it was after De Wet's puerile act of  defiance had been committed. Reparation
and atonement  are  to  come,  as  we  shall  learn  when  De  Wet  faces  his court-martial,
probably at an early date. The  Premier of France, M. Viviani, in  his great speech at the
opening of the Chambers, paid  an eloquent tribute to the French Army. "We have," he  said,
"the certainty of success. We  owe this certainty ... to our  Army, whose heroism in  numerous
combats has been  guided by their incomparable  chiefs from  the  victory on  the Marne  to
the victory  in Flanders.... Let us do honour to all these heroes. Glory to those who have
fallen before  the victory, and to  those also who through  it will avenge them  to-morrow!
It will be  seen  from  our  photographs  that the  trenches  on  the  East  Coast are  constructed
on  the  latest pattern  as developed  in  the war,  with deep passage-ways,  roofed sections,
traverses, and  zigzags to  avoid an enfilading  fire  from the  flank.  They  are,  indeed,
to judge  by  the photograph, remarkably similar to those constructed at the front in France
and  Flanders. It was also anticipated that the  conditions of the Christmas spent by the Germans
at  the front  would,  like  those  experienced  by our  own  men and  those of  the  Allied
Armies,  be ameliorated  by  the reception  and distribution  of  gifts from  home.  For  a
considerable  while  Germany's women-folk, especially,  collected gifts for  fathers and brothers
at the front; and it is certain that their efforts were much appreciated. It shows how some
of the French are making  the best  of things,  regardless of  weather and  the enemy.  They
hollowed out the  trench at one point (describes the  officer), and roofed it over with planks
and earth, forming a bomb-proof. A seat was cut at the sides and a table  got from a village
near. A roll  of sheet-iron found in the  village was  made a  chimney for  a fire  with a
cosy chimney-corner beside it. With some wire, also, a sort of candelabra was constructed.
The flowers on the  table are in a  German shell for vase,  and the gramophone was another
village "find." It is evident  that the war may develop a race of military troglodytes. Mr.
John Dakin, writing of this drawing, made by him from a sketch which he made at the Front,
says: "Throughout the war, the enemy has displayed considerable skill in  locating and shelling
any buildings selected for  occupation by our Staff. Various methods of  countering these tactics
have been devised. On at least  one occasion, headquarters was established  in a subterranean
apartment, which was not merely bomb-proof, but a comfortable retreat from the  weather.  By
day,  the Germans,  we are  told, were persistently  aggressive, continuously  launching attacks
against various points of the Russian lines, while the Russians remained on the defensive.
With the  coming of darkness,  however, regularly, night after  night, the Germans  redoubled
their  efforts  everywhere, taking  advantage  of  the obscurity  to fling  forward dense 
swarms and  columns of  men in  massed formation, to  storm the  entrenched Russian  position,
apparently  at any cost. They failed every time, it would appear, beaten back after literally
a  massacre.  The Russians,  it is  stated, invariably allowed the Germans to come in to well
within point-blank range, remaining silent, holding their fire and not showing a light meanwhile.
Then, as the enemy got within point-blank range, searchlights were suddenly switched on and
a ceaseless  fusillade  of  Maxim and  rifle-fire  from the  Russians literally mowed the Germans
down by hundreds, breaking up their masses and paralysing the attack. No. 1 is  McDougal's
Armoured Whale-back, with  conning-towers, a  design  of 1892  for  converting whalebacks 
into war-vessels.  No. 2  is an  American  design of  1892, Commodore  Folger's Dynamite Ram,
cigar-shaped,  with two guns throwing masses  of dynamite or aerial torpedoes. No. 3 is a design
by the Earl of Mayo in 1894 and called "Aries the  Ram," built round  an immense beam  of steel
terminating  in a sharp point, No. 4 is Gathmann's boat for a heavy gun forward, designed in
1900. She was to  be of great speed, and the forward gun  was to throw 600 lb. of gun-cotton
at the rate of 2000 feet per second. A formidable Armada this, had it been practicable. The
vessel  was  to  carry  four  large barbettes  and  a  huge  umbrella-like fighting-top. Illustration
No. 2 is  an Immersible Ironclad, designed by a French engineer named  Le Grand, in 1862. 
In action the vessel  was to be partly  submerged, so  that only  her  three turrets  and the
top of  the armoured glacis  would be visible.  No. 3  is Admiral Elliott's  "Ram," of 1884.
The  ship was  to  carry  a  "crinoline"  of stanchions  along  her water-line, practically
a fixed  torpedo-net. No.  4 is  Thomas Cornish's Invulnerable  Ironclad, of  1885. She  was
to  have two  separate parallel hulls under water; above she was of turtle-back shape. Particularly
singled out for praise has been their audacious expertness  in close-quarter combats. They
supply both infantry and  artillery, and are recruited all  over Siberia, forming ordinarily
two separate commands, the  East Siberian and the West Siberian troops, which garrison the
fortresses and districts between Vladisvostock and the  Ural Mountains, the  dividing range
between European  and Asiatic Russia. They  are  as proof  against  physical  discomfort  or
hardships,  and  as determined to  be "jolly,"  as was Mark  Tapley himself.  Our illustration
shows one of our soldiers writing home  from the loft over a cow-shed, his only shelter "somewhere
near the front."  A shaft of sunlight relieves the gloom of his rough surroundings, and no
doubt is reflected in the messages he is  sending to  his friends at  home.  Our  photographs
were  taken  on  and  near  the  battlefield. No.  1 on  the  first page  represents a  preliminary
incident. It  shows an  Austrian  patrol  captured  while   pressing  forward  with  the  rash
assurance that  characterised the  Austrian headlong advance.  No. 2  is a battlefield  scene,
on  December 3,  when the  Serbians suddenly  attacked the  Austrians  and  broke  up  their
positions  at  all  points  at  the outset,  making  whole regiments,  scattered  and  isolated
among  ravines and  valleys,  in  many  instances, surrender  at  discretion.  No. 3  shows
Serbian  villagers placing  wreaths on  the graves  of fallen  countrymen. Photograph  No.
4  lets  us realise  something of  the heroic part the women villagers took in helping to achieve
the triumph. As the  battle took  shape they  came forward  and cheered  the men-folk  on,
calling out  "Napréd, braco,  Napréd," "Forward, brothers,  forward," also helping (as our
photograph shows) to push the cannon and ease the worn-out horses. Yet another instance of
the work the Serbian women did is shown in our page  photograph. The grim  realities of the
war over-rode all considerations  of sentiment, and the hope which  was, for a while, common
to both sides had to be left unfulfilled. None the less, the Season was not  without its little
luxuries, and, thanks  to the excellent work  of the  Army Service  Corps  and the  thoughtfulness
of  sympathetic friends  at home,  there  was  no dearth  of  substantial necessaries  and
comforts, as well as tobacco and cigarettes galore. It is a reassuring picture, this of the
two men in khaki, rifle on shoulder, but  swinging  from the  deadly  barrels  berried  mistletoe,
so  rich  in suggestion of the happiness of Christmases when the scourge of war was not upon
the nations.--[Photograph by L.N.A.]

The  conditions under  which tens  of  thousands of  soldiers spent  their Christmas were memorably
abnormal, but, none  the less, the season was not passed  without such  observance of  old
customs,  and such  care for  all available good  cheer, as were  possible. Our photograph
depicts  the unfortunate fate that has befallen  a once well-known object in the  streets of
London--one of  the motor-'buses  shipped across  to France  to serve  in transporting British
troops to  the front, now in  the hands of the enemy.  Not many of them have  had such bad
luck,  from all accounts, but  accidents cannot be helped, and  a victim  has been  claimed
now and  again, mostly  at places where some raiding  Uhlan patrol has managed  to cut in and
ambush one on some outlying road  near the line of communications between  the front and an
army base,  catching the  'bus while  returning after  discharging its soldier "fares."  It
was stated  that the  explosions  killed  two officers  and  eight men,  while one  officer
and  fifty-six  men  were injured.  The  Germans  also  used hand-grenades, as  shown in our
photograph.  These appear to have  been of the improvised "jam-tin" type such as has been employed
in the trenches in Flanders  "Eye-Witness" wrote  recently: "Mines  have not  played such 
an important part  in this  mole-work as  might have  been supposed. That  is a typical announcement
one constantly sees in  the Paris communiqués recording events in the  district where the photograph
given above was taken. Special interest being taken in the fighting in Flanders, one rather
overlooks the give-and-take  warfare being carried  on further east, where  siege-trench fighting
like that  on the Aisne still  goes on. There the  Germans occupy deeply  dug lines which 
are largely made  up of underground  galleries partly  natural, partly  artificial, in  character,
as  our  photograph shows.  When  the  French  artillery fire  is  severe, the  Germans  scuttle
like  rabbits  into  their  burrows, coming  out  to man  the  trenches in  front  immediately
the  French infantry  begin  to approach.--[Photo. by C.N.]
