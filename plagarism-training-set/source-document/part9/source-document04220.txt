[326-2] This reason for the desire of King John of Portugal to have the Demarcation Line moved
further west has escaped all the writers on the subject. If Columbus reported the king's ideas
correctly, we may have here a clew to one of the reasons why Cabral went so far to the southwest
in 1500 that he discovered Brazil when on his voyage to India, and perhaps also one of the
reasons why Vasco da Gama struck off so boldly into the South Atlantic. Cf. Bourne, Spain in
America, pp. 72, 74.

[327-1] Sierra Leone.

[328-1] As one faces north.

[329-1] On Hanno's voyage see Encyclopædia Britannica under his name. There was no Greek historian
Amianus; the name should be Arrianus, who wrote the history of Alexander the Great's expedition
to India and a history of India. The reference is to the latter work, ch. XLIII., sects. 11, 12.

Ludovico Celio: Ludovico Ricchieri, born about 1450. He was for a time a professor in the Academy
at Milan. He took the Latin name Rhodiginus from his birthplace Rovigo, and sometimes his name
appears in full as Ludovicus Coelius Richerius Rhodiginus. His Antiquarum Lectionum Libri XVI.
was published at Venice in 1516, at Paris in 1517, and in an extended form at Basel, 1542.
It is a collection of passages from the classical authors relating to all branches of knowledge,
with a critical commentary.

[329-2] The Guards, "the two brightest stars in Ursa Minor." (Tolhausen.)

[329-3] Grajos. The meaning given in the dictionaries for grajo is "daw."

[329-4] This word, as a name of a fish, is Portuguese. It means "blunted."

[329-5] See Pliny, Natural History, book IV., ch. XXXVI. The Cassiterides are commonly identified
with the Scilly Islands.

[329-6] The fifth clime or climate is a term in Ptolemy's geographical system. The fifth climate
was a strip 255 Roman miles in width lying between 41° and 45° north latitude. Cf. Raccolta
Columbiana,[TN-7] Parte I., Tomo 2, p. 293. The latitude of the Azores is about 37°-40°.

[330-1] The names are alcatraz and rabihorcado. See above, note to Journal of First Voyage,
p. 98, note 1, and p. 103, note 1.

[330-2] Huelva, near Palos.

[331-1] Trinidad.

[331-2] Salve Regina, one of the great hymns to the Virgin in the Catholic service. "The antiphon
said after Lauds and Compline from Trinity Sunday to Advent." Addis and Arnold, Catholic Dictionary.

[331-3] I.e., that his will was not to serve the sovereigns but to advance himself.

[332-1] Cape of the Galley. To-day, Cape Galeota.

[332-2] The last of the canonical hours of prayer, after sunset or early evening.

[334-1] Sandy Point.

[334-2] Of the whale.

[334-3] One of the native names of the Orinoco, here referring to one of the northern branch
mouths. A detailed map of the region is given Winsor's Columbus, p. 353.

[336-1] "A sort of veil, or head attire used by the Moorish women, made of thin silk, striped
of several colors, and shagged at the ends, which hangs down on the back." John Stevens, A
New Dictionary, Spanish and English, etc. (London. 1726.)

[337-1] The exploration of the west coast of Africa, the only equatorial regions then known
to Europeans, had led to the conclusion that black was the natural color of the inhabitants
of the tropics.

[337-2] The Navidad referred to by Las Casas was near the Gulf of Paria. (Thacher.)

[337-3] Poner á monte carracas. Poner á monte is not given in the Spanish dictionaries, and
is apparently a sea phrase identical with the Portuguese "pôr um navio a monte," to beach or
ground a vessel. The translator went entirely astray in this passage. See Thacher's Columbus,
II. 388. The figure here given and the use of word pasos, normally, a land measure of length,
instead of braza, "fathom," would seem to indicate that the 65 paces refers to the extent of
shore laid bare, and not to the height of the tide. The corresponding passage in the Historie
reads: "so that it seemed a rapid river both day and night and at all hours, notwithstanding
the fact that the water rose and fell along the shore (per la spiaggia) more than sixty paces
between the waves (alle marette) as it is wont to do in San Lucar di Barrameda where the waters
[of the river] are high since although the water rises and falls it never ceases to run toward
the sea," Historie (London ed.), p. 229. In this passage maree, "tides," should be read instead
of marette.

[338-1] Accepting the emendation of de Lollis which substitutes fructas for fuentes, "springs."

[339-1] I.e., north by east.

[339-2] Loma.

[340-1] Las Casas here quotes Columbus's letter to Ferdinand and Isabella on this voyage. See
Major, Select Letters of Columbus, p. 123.

[340-2] Serpent's mouth. The name is still retained.

[340-3] Lapa means barnacle; caracol, periwinkle; and delfin, dolphin.

[340-4] Dragon's mouth. The name is still retained.

[340-5] I.e., along the south shore of the peninsula of Paria in the Gulf of Paria.

[341-1] The grammatical form of this sentence follows the original, which is irregular.

[341-2] See p. 311, note 2.

[341-3] Galos paules (Cat-Pauls). A species of African monkey was so called in Spain. The name
occurs in Marco Polo. On its history and meaning, see Yule's Marco Polo, II. 372.

[342-1] Im Thurn, Among the Indians of Guiana, p. 193, says, "Indians after babyhood are never
seen perfectly naked."

[343-1] Flechas con hierba muy á punto, literally, arrows with grass very sharp. Gaffarel,
Histoire de la Découverte de l'Amérique, II. 196, interprets this to mean arrows feathered
with grass; but hierba used in connection with arrows usually means poison. Cf. Oviedo, lib.
IX., title of cap. XII., "Del árbol ó mançanillo con cuya fructa los indios caribes flecheros
haçen la hierba con que tiran é pélean."

[343-2] Hureyos is Tureyos in the printed edition of Las Casas, an obvious correction of the
manuscript reading. On turey, see above, p. 310.

[343-3] See above, p. 336, note 1.

[344-1] Needle. Alcatrazes, to-day. (Navarrete.)

[344-2] Gardens.

[344-3] Ojas de oro. The translator took ojas (hojas) for ojos and rendered it "eyes of gold."
See Thacher, Columbus, II. 393.

[345-1] I.e., in Española.

[346-1] Irregularly shaped pearls, seed pearls.

[346-2] "Keep your eyes open."

[347-1] Isabela in the printed text.

[348-1] The north wind.

[348-2] Pliny, Natural History, book IX., ch. LIV.

[348-3] The name is still used. It is the Rhicopharia mangle. See the description of it in
Thompson's Alcedo's Geographical and Historical Dictionary of America and the West Indies,
Appendix.

[349-1] Las Casas here inserts a long disquisition on pearls which is omitted. It covers pp.
246-252 of the printed edition, Vol. II.

[350-1] I.e., the western end of the Gulf of Paria.

[350-2] These mouths of the Orinoco supplied the fresh water, but they can hardly be the streams
referred to by the sailors who explored the western end of the Gulf of Paria. Las Casas had
no good map of this region.

[352-1] Columbus elaborated this point in his letter to Ferdinand and Isabella. Major, Select
Letters of Columbus, p. 113. Columbus's estimate of the sacrifice of lives in the exploration
of the west coast of Africa must be considered a most gross exaggeration. The contemporary
narratives of those explorations give no such impression.

[352-2] Cf. Columbus's letter to the sovereigns, "Your Highnesses have here another world."
Major, Select Letters of Columbus, p. 148, and the letter to the nurse of Prince John, p. 381,
post. "I have placed under the dominion of the King and Queen our sovereigns another world."
These passages clearly show that Columbus during and after this voyage realized that he accomplished
something quite different from merely reaching Asia by a western route. He had found a hitherto
unknown portion of the world, unknown to the ancients or to Marco Polo, but not for that reason
necessarily physically detached from the known Asia. For a fuller discussion of the meaning
of the phrase "another world," "New World," and of Columbus's ideas of what he had done, see
Bourne, Spain in America, pp. 94-98, and the facsimile of the Bartholomew Columbus map, opposite
p. 96.

[352-3] A noteworthy prediction. In fact the discovery of the New World has effected a most
momentous change in the relative strength and range of Christianity among the world-religions.
During the Middle Ages Christianity lost more ground territorially than it gained. Since the
discovery of America its gain has been steady.

[352-4] Such in fact their Highnesses' grandson, Charles I. (V. as Emperor), was during his
long reign, and such during a part of his reign if not the whole, was their great-grandson
Philip II. See Oviedo's reflections upon Columbus's career. Bourne, Spain in America, p. 82.

[353-1] Las Casas here comments at some length on these remarks of Columbus and the great significance
of his discoveries. The passage omitted takes up pp. 255 (line six from bottom) to 258.

[353-2] Las Casas explains leste, which would seem to have been either peculiar to sailors
or at least not in common usage then for "east."

[353-3] Probably gatos in the sense of gatos paules, monkeys, noted above, p. 341, as very
plentiful.

[353-4] Port of the Cabins.

[353-5] The Catholicon was one of the earliest Latin lexicons of modern times and the first
to be printed. It was compiled by Johannes de Janua (Giovanni Balbi of Genoa) toward the end
of the thirteenth century and first printed at Mainz in 1460, and very frequently later.

[354-1] The third of the canonical hours of prayer, about nine o'clock in the morning.

[355-1] El agua les es medicina, i.e., a means of curing the ill.

[355-2] Abajo. Las Casas views the mainland as extending up from the sea. Columbus was going
west along the north shore of the peninsula of Paria.

[355-3] I.e., to go west along the north shore of this supposed island until looking south
he was to the right of it and abreast of the Gulf of Pearls.

[355-4] Three of the greatest known rivers, each of which drained a vast range of territory.
This narrative reveals the gradual dawning upon Columbus of the fact that he had discovered
a hitherto unknown continental mass. In his letter to the sovereigns his conviction is settled
and his efforts to adjust it with previous knowledge and the geographical traditions of the
ages are most interesting. See Major, Select Letters of Columbus, pp. 134 et seqq. "Ptolemy,"
he says, on p. 136, "and the others who have written upon the globe had no information respecting
this part of the world, for it was most unknown."

[356-1] The Witnesses.

[358-1] The reference is to II. Esdras, VI. 42, in the Apocrypha of the English Bible. The
Apocryphal books of I. and II. Esdras were known as III. and IV. Esdras in the Middle Ages,
and the canonical books in the Vulgate called I. and II. Esdras are called Ezra and Nehemiah
in the English Bible. II.

[358-2] The reference is wrong, as Las Casas points out two or three pages further on (II.
266); it should be to the treatise De Bono Mortis, cap. 10

[359-1] Francis de Mayrones was an eminent Scotist philosopher. He died in 1327. Columbus here
quotes from his Theologicae Veritates (Venice, 1493). See Raccolta Colombiana, Parte I., tomo
II., p. 377. Las Casas (II. 266) was unable to verify the citation from St. Augustine.
