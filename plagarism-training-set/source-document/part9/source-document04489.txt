                                PREFACE.

The original conception of this little book was due to the Rev. W. H. Frere, and it could not
have been carried out at all without his help and advice, which have been ungrudgingly given.

But he is not responsible for any part of the book, except the notes on the tropes and the
third and fourth portraits of St. Gregory. Whatever else in the book is of any value has been
compiled from the following sources:--

    Morin.--"Les véritables origines du Chant Grégorien." Maredsous,
          1890.
    Morin.--"Revue Bénédictine," for May, 1890. Maredsous.
    Wagner.--"Einführung in die Gregorianischen Melodien," Pt. 1.
          Freiburg, 1901.

                              INTRODUCTION.

The Great Pope, the thirteen hundredth anniversary of whose death is commemorated on March
the 12th, 1904, was born at Rome, probably about the year 540. His father, Gordianus, was a
wealthy man of senatorial rank; his mother, Silvia, was renowned for her virtues. He received
from his parents an excellent liberal and religious education. He further applied himself to
the study of law, and--probably at about the age of 30--was made prætor of Rome by the Emperor
Justin II. But he became dissatisfied with his mode of life, and retiring to the monastery
of St. Andrew, which he had founded on the Coelian hill, lived there as monk and as abbot.
He had long been an ardent admirer of St. Bennet (who had been dead little more than thirty
years), and on his father's death had made use of his patrimony to found six other monasteries
in Sicily. He was not, however, allowed to enjoy his retirement at St. Andrew's for long, for
Pope Benedict I. ordained him deacon, and sent him to Constantinople as his apocrisiarius or
confidential agent. Pelagius II. continued him in this office, making use of him especially
to appeal to the Emperor for aid against the Lombards, who, while settling in North Italy,
were wandering southwards, devastating the country as they went.
