MATHEMATICAL PUZZLES.

No. I.

Two countrymen were going along the road, each driving sheep.

Said one, "Hi, neighbor, give me one of your sheep, and then I shall have twice as many as
you will have."

"Nay, neighbor," replied the other, "give me one of your sheep, and then we shall both have
the same number."

How many sheep did each have?

No. II.

An old man lived in a little hut by a bridge which crossed a deep river.

One day a wicked water-spirit appeared to him and said: "My friend, I know you are very poor.
Now I will increase whatever money you may have twofold, asking only in return this small favor,
that every time you cross the bridge you will throw twenty-four cents into the water, and at
the same time the money you have left shall be doubled." The poor old man was delighted at
what he thought a generous offer of the water-spirit, and faithfully fulfilled all the conditions;
but, to his sorrow and astonishment, when he had three times thrown the tribute of twenty-four
cents to the water-spirit, he found himself penniless.

How much money did he have when the water-spirit first appeared to him?

No. III.

A good mother went to buy eggs for her children, for the Easter season was approaching, and
the eggs were to be colored red and blue. She bought from a grocer half of his entire stock
and half an egg more. Then a second woman came, and she bought half of what the grocer had
remaining and half an egg more. A third woman and a fourth woman did the same thing, and in
the end the grocer had one egg left.

How many had he in the beginning?

No. IV.

A man had seven sons, and a property of $49,000. Now the younger sons were jealous because
their father spent more for the elder brother than he did for them, and they entreated him
to make his will in their favor. To satisfy their demands he made his will, and the younger
sons were contented. This is the will: The oldest son to have $1000 and an eighth of what remained;
the second son to have $2000 and an eighth of what remained; the third, $3000 and an eighth
of what remained; the fourth, $4000 and an eighth of what remained; the fifth, $5000 and an
eighth of what remained; the sixth, $6000 and an eighth of what remained; the seventh and youngest
to have all that remained when the sixth had taken his share.

What share of the $49,000 did each receive?
