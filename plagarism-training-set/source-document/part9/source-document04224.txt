It is told as a well-known jest, that a beggar woman, repulsed from door to door as she solicited
quarters through a village of Annandale, asked, in her despair, if there were no Christians
in the place. To which the hearers, concluding that she inquired for some persons so surnamed,
answered, 'Na, na, there are nae Christians here; we are a' Johnstones and Jardines.'

NOTE 6, p. 244

The mysterious rites in which Meg Merrilies is described as engaging belong to her character
as a queen of her race. All know that gipsies in every country claim acquaintance with the
gift of fortune-telling; but, as is often the case, they are liable to the superstitions of
which they avail themselves in others. The correspondent of Blackwood, quoted in the Introduction
to this Tale, gives us some information on the subject of their credulity.

'I have ever understood,' he says, speaking of the Yetholm gipsies,' that they are extremely
superstitious, carefully noticing the formation of the clouds, the flight of particular birds,
and the soughing of the winds, before attempting any enterprise. They have been known for several
successive days to turn back with their loaded carts, asses, and children, upon meeting with
persons whom they considered of unlucky aspect; nor do they ever proceed on their summer peregrinations
without some propitious omen of their fortunate return. They also burn the clothes of their
dead, not so much from any apprehension of infection being communicated by them, as the conviction
that the very circumstance of wearing them would shorten the days of their living. They likewise
carefully watch the corpse by night and day till the time of interment, and conceive that "the
deil tinkles at the lyke-wake" of those who felt in their dead-thraw the agonies and terrors
of remorse.'

These notions are not peculiar to the gipsies; but, having been once generally entertained
among the Scottish common people, are now only found among those who are the most rude in their
habits and most devoid of instruction. The popular idea, that the protracted struggle between
life and death is painfully prolonged by keeping the door of the apartment shut, was received
as certain by the superstitious eld of Scotland. But neither was it to be thrown wide open.
To leave the door ajar was the plan adopted by the old crones who understood the mysteries
of deathbeds and lykewakes. In that case there was room for the imprisoned spirit to escape;
and yet an obstacle, we have been assured, was offered to the entrance of any frightful form
which might otherwise intrude itself. The threshold of a habitation was in some sort a sacred
limit, and the subject of much superstition. A bride, even to this day, is always lifted over
it, a rule derived apparently from the Romans.
