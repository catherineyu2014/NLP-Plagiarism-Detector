Messrs. Puttick and Simpson, who have during the present week been selling the curious Dramatic
Library, printed and manuscript, and the theatrical portraits of the late Mr. James Winston,
will commence, on Monday, the sale of Mr. Mitchell's Collection of Autograph Letters. The most
interesting portion of these are eight-and-forty unpublished letters by Garrick, among which
is one written to his brother Peter, commenced on the day on which he made his appearance on
the London boards and finished on the following. In it he communicates his change of occupation
to his brother, premising that since he had been in business he had "run out four hundred pounds,
and found trade not increasing," and had now begun to think of some way of redeeming his fortune.
"My mind (as you know) has always been inclined to the stage; nay, so strongly so, that all
my illness and lowness of spirits was owing to my want of resolution to tell you my thoughts
when here.... Though I know you will be displeased with me, yet I hope when you shall find
that I may have the genius of an actor without the vices, you will think less severe of me,
and not be ashamed to own me for a brother." He makes an offer as to the transfer of his business,
stock, &c. "Last night I played Richard the Third to the surprise of every body; and as I shall
make very near 300l. per annum of it, and as it is really what I doat upon, I am resolved to
pursue it." In a postscript, he adds, "I have a farce (The Lying Valet), coming out at Drury-lane."
And his progress in his new profession is shown in another letter, addressed also to his brother
Peter, on the 19th of April following, in which, after mentioning some affairs of business
connected with their wine trade, he says:

     "The favour I have met with from the greatest men has made me far
     from repenting of my choice. I am very intimate with Mr. Glover,
     who will bring out a Tragedy next winter on my account. I have
     supp'd with the great Mr. Murray, Counsellor, and shall with Mr.
     Pope by his introduction. I supp'd with Mr. Littleton, the prince's
     favourite, last Thursday night, and met with the highest civility
     and complaisance; he told me he never knew what acting was till I
     appeared, and said I was only born to act what Shakspeare writ....
     I believe nobody as an Actor was ever more caressed, and my
     character as a private man makes 'em more desirous of my company
     (all this entre nous as one brother to another). I am not fixed
     for next year, but shall certainly be at the other end of the town.
     I am offered 500 guineas and a clear benefit, or part of the
     management," &c.

The whole collection forms, indeed, a curious and new contribution towards the biography of
that distinguished actor. 8vo. 1778.

Preparing for Publication, handsomely printed in 8vo.

A SERIES OF EDITIONS OF THE GREEK AND LATIN CLASSICS,

To be issued under the general title of

BIBLIOTHECA CLASSICA

Edited by various hands, under the direction of GEORGE LONG, Esq., M.A., late Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge, Classical Lecturer of Brighton College; and the Rev. ARTHUR JOHN MACLEANE,
M.A., Trinity College, Cambridge, and Principal of Brighton College.

Early in the ensuing year will be commenced a Series of the Greek and Roman Authors, carefully
edited with English Notes, on a uniform plan. The series will be especially adapted to the
wants of students in the higher forms of public schools and at the universities, and will embrace,
in the first instance, those works which are usually read in the course of a classical education.

The works will be edited by various hands; and, to secure uniformity and consistency in execution,
the series will be under the united management of Mr. Long and Mr. Macleane.

The first volume will be ready early in 1850. The subsequent volumes will be published at intervals,
as regularly as may be found practicable, at the rate of four or five volumes in the year.

The following works are undertaken by the gentlemen whose names are set opposite:--

HOMER: Illiad,     -    Rev. Benjamin Hall Kennedy. D.D.,
Odyssey                 late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge;
                              Head Master of Shrewsbury
                              School.
HESIOD             -    Edward Law Lushington, Esq., M.A.,
                              late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge;
                              Professor of Greek in the
                              University of Glasgow.
 HERODOTUS         -    Rev. J.W. Blakesley, M.A., late Fellow

                                   of Greek and Roman Antiquities,
                                  and of the Greek and Roman
                                 Biography and Mythology.
TACITUS            -   Wm. B. Donne, Esq.
VIRGIL             -   Rev. Charles Merivale, M.A.. late Fellow

JUVENAL                Cambridge: Professor of Humanity in
and PERSIUS           the University of Glasgow.

The undermentioned volumes are already in progress, and are expected to appear during 1850-1:--

HERODOTUS, Three Volumes. ILIAD, One Volume. HORACE, Two Volumes. CICERO, Orations, Vol. I.
PLATO, Dialogues, Vol. I. TACITUS, Vol. I.

Each work will be sold separately; but, as the Publishers expect that they will be enabled
to extend the series until it shall approximate to a complete collection of the Greek and Latin
Classics, and as they have reason to think that such a collection would be found an acceptable
addition to all public and private Libraries, they hope to receive the names of persons who
are willing to give encouragement to the scheme, as Subscribers to the entire Series.

A CHROMO-LITHOGRAPHIC DRAWING OF THE PAINTED CEILING IN THE NAVE OF PETERBOROUGH CATHEDRAL,
coloured as in the original, by G. STRICKLAND. This curious relic of Ecclesiastical Decoration
of The Twelfth Century is considered to be the finest specimen of its character and period
in Great Britain; it is in a high state of preservation and no representation of it exists.
The Drawing is six feet long, and its details all bear the same relative proportions as the
original.

Publishing in Parts, impl. 12 Parts are now published. Published by GEORGE BELL, 186. Fleet
Street, (continued). The second volume, which will complete the work, is now in progress, and

THE HISTORY and ART of WARMING and VENTILATING ROOMS and BUILDINGS.

     "The whole of the work seems to be arranged skilfully, and drawn up
     with care; it comprises much information valuable to the student of
     antiquities, and will well repay the perusal of those who are
     interested in the theories and practice of warming and ventilating
     houses"--Archaeological Journal.

     "Expedients of all time and nations collected with research,
     selected with judgment, and skilfully arranged and
     described."--Athenæum

8vo., price 16s.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE TRAGEDIES of ÆSCHYLUS and SOPHOCLES, from the Greek, Latin, and English
Poets, with an Introductory Essay by J.F. BOYES, M.A., St. John's College, Oxford.

A few Copies of the ILLUSTRATIONS of ÆSCHYLUS may still be had separately, price 9s. Also Copies
of PARTS II. and III. to complete Sets, price 3s. each.

     "Mr. Boyes has collected these illustrations more for the purpose
     of determining the heads of thought by a comparison of minds, than
     for the detection of Plagiarism. His work will amuse those whose
     days of study are gone by, but who love to review their classic
     recollections, and to recall those images of sublimity and beauty
     which had delighted their young hearts and charmed their youthful
     fancy. To use the language of Cicero, he has rendered those studies
     which nurtured boyhood delightful to age"--Athenæum

     "This is one of the most pleasing classical works that we have
     lately read. 1849.
