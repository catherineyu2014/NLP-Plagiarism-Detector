PREFACE.

Although most excellent food is to be found on the table of metaphysical thought, there has
never yet been a metaphysical story setting forth a picture of every-day life, in its search
for, and attainment of satisfaction through the knowledge of Christ Philosophy.

Knowing the pressing need of such a book among the many inquirers and students on this theme,
and with the hope of helping to fill that need, this story is told.

It is a book of facts, not fiction, although wearing the dress of fiction. Every case of healing,
every seemingly marvelous experience has come under the observation of the writer and can be
authenticated as a veritable fact.

That there are hundreds, yea, thousands to-day, who leave their homes and go to distant cities
for the sake of pursuing the study of Christ Philosophy, or receiving the benefit of its healing
ministry, is proof enough that the story of one woman's experience will be interesting and
helpful to all.

While the lessons contained in Mrs. Hayden's letters are not exhaustive, they are valuable
for their very simplicity, and are thoroughly practical, complete instructions for the beginning
and continuance of the study of this wonderful truth.

With every lesson supplemented by personal experiences, the reader sees not only the theory
but the practice demonstrated, and in this simple story he may find the mirror of his own inner
hopes and aspirations, with a broader view of their possible attainment than he has yet seen.

Carlyle says: "If a book come from the heart, it will contrive to reach other hearts." "The
Right Knock" is presented with no other apology than this: it has come from the heart.

PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION.

To a new and awakened public the author gives greetings and begs to say a few more words about
THE RIGHT KNOCK.

After all these years of work along the lines laid out in the book and with a wide knowledge
of prevailing systems of mental training, the author is happy to be able to say with unbounded
confidence that there is nothing to excel this system for beginners, for those desiring to
lay a lasting foundation. The emphasis laid upon the necessity for persistent, regular and
systematic practice of word speaking by audible repetition, is great, but none too great. For
the faithful student this never fails to bring results, never fails to put him in the way of
understanding and demonstration. With regular practice and constant application in the daily
life, with good judgment as to the details of practice, length of time at one exercise, etc.,
the pupil is assured in one way or another certain convincing experiences which develop individuality
and, with that, his God-like gifts. Thousands have proven this.

The unnumbered letters of gratitude, the kind words, the warm hand-clasps, the many testimonials
of sick beds forsaken, depressed spirits revived, vices discontinued, of physical and moral
strength regained, prove that the work of the Spirit is not to be measured by puny human standards
of judgment, prove that simple things--the things from which we expect the least, in which
we put the least ambition or worldly desire may be those which will yield the "hundred fold"
of real blessing.

The test of any spiritual truth lies in its demonstration and in the inspiration and faithfulness
with which it can be lived. Be true to the truth and you will demonstrate it. Live the Christ
life and the works will follow; yet seek truth for its own sake, not for its power.

A word about Christian Science. Sometimes persons aver of THE RIGHT KNOCK that it teaches Christian
Science pure and simple. With all due respect and a recognition of the grand and marvelous
work done by Mrs. Eddy, the author feels called upon to say, in justice to Mrs. Eddy as well
as herself, that this is not true.

There are undoubtedly many similar statements, yet there are many differences which the careful
reader will discover. Please note, for example, that not matter itself, but matter as the real
substance or power, is denied. Not sickness of the body, but sickness of the Spirit, is a falsity,
etc., etc.

In brief, the author of THE RIGHT KNOCK believes there is a name, place and condition for everything,
and that the discrimination of the plane on which a thing or condition exists, is the key to
placing it in the right relation to the whole.

In conclusion, the author would say most earnestly, study one writer or teacher at one time,
just as you would study music of one instructor at one time. It is not the many books but the
Book within which is to reveal all things.

  God speed you.

  HELEN VAN-ANDERSON.
