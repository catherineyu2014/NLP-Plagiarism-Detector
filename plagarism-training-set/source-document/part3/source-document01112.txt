PREFACE.

How best to perform construction work and what it will cost for materials, labor, plant and
general expenses are matters of vital interest to engineers and contractors. This book is a
treatise on the methods and cost of concrete construction. No attempt has been made to present
the subject of cement testing which is already covered by Mr. W. Purves Taylor's excellent
book, nor to discuss the physical properties of cements and concrete, as they are discussed
by Falk and by Sabin, nor to consider reinforced concrete design as do Turneaure and Maurer
or Buel and Hill, nor to present a general treatise on cements, mortars and concrete construction
like that of Reid or of Taylor and Thompson. On the contrary, the authors have handled the
subject of concrete construction solely from the viewpoint of the builder of concrete structures.
By doing this they have been able to crowd a great amount of detailed information on methods
and costs of concrete construction into a volume of moderate size.

Though the special information contained in the book is of most particular assistance to the
contractor or engineer engaged in the actual work of making and placing concrete, it is believed
that it will also prove highly useful to the designing engineer and to the architect. It seems
plain that no designer of concrete structures can be a really good designer without having
a profound knowledge of methods of construction and of detailed costs. This book, it is believed,
gives these methods and cost data in greater number and more thoroughly analyzed than they
can be found elsewhere in engineering literature.

The costs and other facts contained in the book have been collected from a multitude of sources,
from the engineering journals, from the transactions of the engineering societies, from Government
Reports and from the personal records of the authors and of other engineers and contractors.
It is but fair to say that the great bulk of the matter contained in the book, though portions
of it have appeared previously in other forms in the authors' contributions to the technical
press, was collected and worked up originally by the authors. Where this has not been the case
the original data have been added to and re-analyzed by the authors. Under these circumstances
it has been impracticable to give specific credit in the pages of the book to every source
from which the authors have drawn aid. They wish here to acknowledge, therefore, the help secured
from many engineers and contractors, from the volumes of Engineering News, Engineering Record
and Engineering-Contracting, and from the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers
and the proceedings and papers of various other civil engineering societies and organizations
of concrete workers. The work done by these journals and societies in gathering and publishing
information on concrete construction is of great and enduring value and deserves full acknowledgment.

In answer to any possible inquiry as to the relative parts of the work done by the two authors
in preparing this book, they will answer that it has been truly the labor of both in every part.

Concrete Construction Methods and Cost

CHAPTER I.

METHODS AND COST OF SELECTING AND PREPARING MATERIALS FOR CONCRETE.

Concrete is an artificial stone produced by mixing cement mortar with broken stone, gravel,
broken slag, cinders or other similar fragmentary materials. The component parts are therefore
hydraulic cement, sand and the broken stone or other coarse material commonly designated as
the aggregate.

CEMENT.

At least a score of varieties of hydraulic cement are listed in the classifications of cement
technologists. The constructing engineer and contractor recognize only three varieties: Portland
cement, natural cement and slag or puzzolan cement. All concrete used in engineering work is
made of either Portland, natural or slag cement, and the great bulk of all concrete is made
of Portland cement. Only these three varieties of cement are, therefore, considered here and
they only in their aspects having relation to the economics of construction work. For a full
discussion of the chemical and physical properties of hydraulic cements and for the methods
of determining these properties by tests, the reader is referred to "Practical Cement Testing,"
by W. Purves Taylor.

~PORTLAND CEMENT.~--Portland cement is the best of the hydraulic cements. Being made from a
rigidly controlled artificial mixture of lime, silica and alumina the product of the best mills
is a remarkably strong, uniform and stable material. It is suitable for all classes of concrete
work and is the only variety of hydraulic cement allowable for reinforced concrete or for plain
concrete having to endure hard wear or to be used where strength, density and durability of
high degree are demanded.
