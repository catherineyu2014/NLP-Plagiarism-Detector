The question is often raised whether Arctic exploration pays. Probably by itself, that is,
if it would have no bearing upon anything else, it would not pay for the lives that are lost
by it and the money that is spent upon it. But when we consider that every scientific fact
is an addition to our knowledge, and may influence for great good some other line of work which
would seem to be in no way connected with it, it is undoubtedly true that the explorations
should continue on scientific lines until no part of the globe which can be reached is unknown
to man.

Among the many features which contribute to the general excellence of the book a few may be
briefly mentioned as follows:

=More and better Illustrations and Maps than have ever appeared in any text-book on the subject.

Carefully selected lists of books for supplementary reading.

Suggestive questions for pupils to discuss.

Introductory chapter of hints to teachers, illuminating the author's method of treatment.

Notes throughout the text explanatory of general statements.

Special stress laid upon the industrial and social development, with a lucid presentation of
the powerful influence exerted by routes and modes of travel, soil, and climate.

Prominence given to the characteristics of our great national leaders.

Emphasis of the importance of the West and South in our national development.

Pupils are led throughout to form high ideals of social duty.=

=TO THE TEACHER.= (Extract.)

The Recitation.--The purposes of the recitation should include more than a test of memory;
they should include a comparison and discussion of facts acquired in the preparation of the
lesson. At the beginning of the recitation a topic should be named and the pupil required to
recite upon it without question or comment from the teacher. Such a method, if persisted in,
will inevitably develop fluency and readiness of expression. The best work lies in helping
the pupil to get definite ideas and then to give these ideas clear expression in well connected
sentences.

=TO THE PUPIL.= (Specimen.)

1. What complaints did we make against England about searching American vessels and impressing
American seamen? What complaints did England enter against us?

2. How did England and France injure American commerce? What was Jefferson's purpose in securing
the passage of the Embargo Act? What was the Embargo? How did it affect American commerce?

3. Learn well the story of the Star Spangled Banner's origin and then memorize the poem. Read
again and again Drake's American Flag and Holmes's Old Ironsides.
