Napoleon read the English newspapers every day in French, and M. de Bausset says the translation
was rigorously exact. One day in January, 1811, the emperor gave some of these extracts to
de B., and ordered him to read them aloud during dinner. The prefect got on pretty well, till
he stumbled at some uncouth epithets, with which he was puzzled how to deal, especially in
the presence of the empress, and a room full of domestics. He blew his nose, and skipped the
words--"No!" said Napoleon, "read out! you will find many more." "I should be wanting--" "Read,
I tell you," repeated the emperor, "read every thing!" At last de B. ran upon "tyrant or despot,"
which he commuted for "emperor." Napoleon caught the paper out of his hands, read the real
phrase aloud, and then ordered M. de B. to continue. These translations used to be made by
Maret, Duke of Bassano.

RETENTIVE MEMORY.

The historian, Fuller, in 1607, had a most retentive memory; he could repeat 500 strange, unconnected
words, after twice hearing them; and a sermon verbatim, after reading it once. He undertook,
after passing from Temple Bar to the farthest part of Cheapside and back again, to mention
all the signs over the shops on both sides of the streets, repeated them backwards and forwards,
and performed the task with great exactness.

VOLTAIRE.

When Voltaire was once ridiculing our immortal author of "Paradise Lost," in the presence of
Dr. Young, it is said the latter delivered the following extempore:

  "Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin,
   Thou seem'st a Milton, with his Death and Sin."
                                        R.Y.

VENTILATION.

Garrick told Cibber, "that his pieces were the best ventilators to his theatre at Drury Lane;
for as soon as any of them were played, the audience directly left the house."

ACROSTIC TO BRAHAM.

  B ear not away ye gales that sound!
  R apture be mute, nor breathe one sigh!
  A ttentive angels hover round--
  H eaven listens to his melody;
  A nd all the spheres' harmonious strings
  M ove in celestial strains when Braham sings!
