  Pour moi je prefere les poetes qui
font des vers, les medecins qui sachent guerir, les peintres qui sanchent peindre.

Nor, in looking at a work of art, should we be dreaming of what it symbolises, but rather loving
it for what it is.  Indeed, the transcendental spirit is alien to the spirit of art.  Nor,
in its primary aspect, has a painting, for instance, any more spiritual message or meaning
for us than a blue tile from the wall of Damascus, or a Hitzen vase.

But it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the aesthetic demands of the age:
there should be also about it, if it is to give us any permanent delight, the impress of a
distinct individuality.  Whatever work we have in the nineteenth century must rest on the two
poles of personality and perfection.  And so in this little volume, by separating the earlier
and more simple work from the work that is later and stronger and possesses increased technical
power and more artistic vision, one might weave these disconnected poems, these stray and scattered
threads, into one fiery-coloured strand of life, noting first a boy's mere gladness of being
young, with all its simple joy in field and flower, in sunlight and in song, and then the bitterness
of sudden sorrow at the ending by Death of one of the brief and beautiful friendships of one's
youth, with all those unanswered lodgings and questionings unsatisfied by which we vex, so
uselessly, the marble face of death; the artistic contrast between the discontented incompleteness
of the spirit and the complete perfection of the style that expresses it forming the chief
element of the aesthetic charm of these particular poems;--and then the birth of Love, and
all the wonder and the fear and the perilous delight of one on whose boyish brows the little
wings of love have beaten for the first time; and the love-songs, so dainty and delicate, little
swallow-flights of music, and full of such fragrance and freedom that they might all be sung
in the open air and across moving water; and then autumn, coming with its choirless woods and
odorous decay and ruined loveliness, Love lying dead; and the sense of the mere pity of it.

One might stop there, for from a young poet one should ask for no deeper chords of life than
those that love and friendship make eternal for us; and the best poems in the volume belong
clearly to a later time, a time when these real experiences become absorbed and gathered up
into a form which seems from such real experiences to be the most alien and the most remote;
when the simple expression of joy or sorrow suffices no longer, and lives rather in the stateliness
of the cadenced metre, in the music and colour of the linked words, than in any direct utterance;
lives, one might say, in the perfection of the form more than in the pathos of the feeling.
And yet, after the broken music of love and the burial of love in the autumn woods, we can
trace that wandering among strange people, and in lands unknown to us, by which we try so pathetically
to heal the hurts of the life we know, and that pure and passionate devotion to Art which one
gets when the harsh reality of life has too suddenly wounded one, and is with discontent or
sorrow marring one's youth, just as often, I think, as one gets it from any natural joy of
living; and that curious intensity of vision by which, in moments of overmastering sadness
and despair ungovernable, artistic things will live in one's memory with a vivid realism caught
from the life which they help one to forget-- an old grey tomb in Flanders with a strange legend
on it, making one think how, perhaps, passion does live on after death; a necklace of blue
and amber beads and a broken mirror found in a girl's grave at Rome, a marble image of a boy
habited like Eros, and with the pathetic tradition of a great king's sorrow lingering about
it like a purple shadow,--over all these the tired spirit broods with that calm and certain
joy that one gets when one has found something that the ages never dull and the world cannot
harm; and with it comes that desire of Greek things which is often an artistic method of expressing
one's desire for perfection; and that longing for the old dead days which is so modern, so
incomplete, so touching, being, in a way, the inverted torch of Hope, which burns the hand
it should guide; and for many things a little sadness, and for all things a great love; and
lastly, in the pinewood by the sea, once more the quick and vital pulse of joyous youth leaping
and laughing in every line, the frank and fearless freedom of wave and wind waking into fire
life's burnt-out ashes and into song the silent lips of pain,--how clearly one seems to see
it all, the long colonnade of pines with sea and sky peeping in here and there like a flitting
of silver; the open place in the green, deep heart of the wood with the little moss-grown altar
to the old Italian god in it; and the flowers all about, cyclamen in the shadowy places, and
the stars of the white narcissus lying like snow-flakes over the grass, where the quick, bright-eyed
lizard starts by the stone, and the snake lies coiled lazily in the sun on the hot sand, and
overhead the gossamer floats from the branches like thin, tremulous threads of gold,--the scene
is so perfect for its motive, for surely here, if anywhere, the real gladness of life might
be revealed to one's youth--the gladness that comes, not from the rejection, but from the absorption,
of all passion, and is like that serene calm that dwells in the faces of the Greek statues,
and which despair and sorrow cannot touch, but intensify only.

In some such way as this we could gather up these strewn and scattered petals of song into
one perfect rose of life, and yet, perhaps, in so doing, we might be missing the true quality
of the poems; one's real life is so often the life that one does not lead; and beautiful poems,
like threads of beautiful silks, may be woven into many patterns and to suit many designs,
all wonderful and all different:  and romantic poetry, too, is essentially the poetry of impressions,
being like that latest school of painting, the school of Whistler and Albert Moore, in its
choice of situation as opposed to subject; in its dealing with the exceptions rather than with
the types of life; in its brief intensity; in what one might call its fiery-coloured momentariness,
it being indeed the momentary situations of life, the momentary aspects of nature, which poetry
and painting new seek to render for us.  Sincerity and constancy will the artist, indeed, have
always; but sincerity in art is merely that plastic perfection of execution without which a
poem or a painting, however noble its sentiment or human its origin, is but wasted and unreal
work, and the constancy of the artist cannot be to any definite rule or system of living, but
to that principle of beauty only through which the inconstant shadows of his life are in their
most fleeting moment arrested and made permanent.  He will not, for instance, in intellectual
matters acquiesce in that facile orthodoxy of our day which is so reasonable and so artistically
uninteresting, nor yet will he desire that fiery faith of the antique time which, while it
intensified, yet limited the vision; still less will he allow the calm of his culture to be
marred by the discordant despair of doubt or the sadness of a sterile scepticism; for the Valley
Perilous, where ignorant armies clash by night, is no resting-place meet for her to whom the
gods have assigned the clear upland, the serene height, and the sunlit air,-- rather will he
be always curiously testing new forms of belief, tinging his nature with the sentiment that
still lingers about some beautiful creeds, and searching for experience itself, and not for
the fruits of experience; when he has got its secret, he will leave without regret much that
was once very precious to him.  "I am always insincere," says Emerson somewhere, "as knowing
that there are other moods":  "Les emotions," wrote Theophile Gautier once in a review of Arsene
Houssaye, "Les emotions, ne se ressemblent pas, mais etre emu--voila l'important."

Now, this is the secret of the art of the modern romantic school, and gives one the right keynote
for its apprehension; but the real quality of all work which, like Mr. Rodd's, aims, as I said,
at a purely artistic effect, cannot be described in terms of intellectual criticism; it is
too intangible for that.  One can perhaps convey it best in terms of the other arts, and by
reference to them; and, indeed, some of these poems are as iridescent and as exquisite as a
lovely fragment of Venetian glass; others as delicate in perfect workmanship and as single
in natural motive as an etching by Whistler is, or one of those beautiful little Greek figures
which in the olive woods round Tanagra men can still find, with the faint gilding and the fading
crimson not yet fled from hair and lips and raiment; and many of them seem like one of Corot's
twilights just passing into music; for not merely in visible colour, but in sentiment also--which
is the colour of poetry--may there be a kind of tone.

But I think that the best likeness to the quality of this young poet's work I ever saw was
in the landscape by the Loire.  We were staying once, he and I, at Amboise, that little village
with its grey slate roofs and steep streets and gaunt, grim gateway, where the quiet cottages
nestle like white pigeons into the sombre clefts of the great bastioned rock, and the stately
Renaissance houses stand silent and apart--very desolate now, but with some memory of the old
days still lingering about the delicately-twisted pillars, and the carved doorways, with their
grotesque animals, and laughing masks, and quaint heraldic devices, all reminding one of a
people who could not think life real till they had made it fantastic.  And above the village,
and beyond the bend of the river, we used to go in the afternoon, and sketch from one of the
big barges that bring the wine in autumn and the wood in winter down to the sea, or lie in
the long grass and make plans pour la gloire, et pour ennuyer les Philistins, or wander along
the low, sedgy banks, "matching our reeds in sportive rivalry," as comrades used in the old
Sicilian days; and the land was an ordinary land enough, and bare, too, when one thought of
Italy, and how the oleanders were robing the hillsides by Genoa in scarlet, and the cyclamen
filling with its purple every valley from Florence to Rome; for there was not much real beauty,
perhaps, in it, only long, white dusty roads and straight rows of formal poplars; but, now
and then, some little breaking gleam of broken light would lend to the grey field and the silent
barn a secret and a mystery that were hardly their own, would transfigure for one exquisite
moment the peasants passing down through the vineyard, or the shepherd watching on the hill,
would tip the willows with silver and touch the river into gold; and the wonder of the effect,
with the strange simplicity of the material, always seemed to me to be a little like the quality
of these the verses of my friend.
