THE LIFE AND WORKS OF ARY SCHEFFER.

No painter of this age has made so deep an impression on the popular mind of America as Ary
Scheffer. Few, if any other contemporary artists are domesticated at our firesides, and known
and loved in our remotest villages and towns. Only a small number, indeed, of his original
works have been exhibited here,--yet engravings from them are not only familiar to every person
of acknowledged taste and culture, but are dear to the hearts of many who scarcely know the
artist's name. Young maidens delight in their tender pathos, and the suffering heart is consoled
and elevated by their pure and lofty religious aspiration. An effect so great must have an
adequate and peculiar cause; and we shall not have far to seek for it, but shall find it in
the aim and character of the artist. Scheffer has two prominent qualities, by which he has
won his place in the popular estimation. The first is his sentiment. His works are full of
simple, tender pathos. His pictures always tell their story, first to the eye, next to the
heart and soul of the beholder. His admirable knowledge of composition is always subordinate
to expression. His meaning is not merely historical or poetical, but is true to life and every-day
experience. Added to this power of pathos and sentiment is the deep religious feeling which
pervades every work of his pencil, whatever be its outward form. His religion is of no dogma
or sect, but the inflowing of a life which makes all things holy and full of infinite meaning.
Whether he paint the legends of the Catholic Church, as in "St. Augustine" and "St. Monica,"
or illustrate the life-poem of the Protestant Goethe, or tell a simple story of childhood,
the same feelings are kindled, in our heart's faith in God, love to man, the sure hope of immortality.
It is this genuine and earnest religion of humanity which has made his works familiar to every
lover of Art and sentiment, and given us a feeling of personal love and reverence for the made
artist.

It is now nearly a year since his labors on earth terminated, and yet no adequate account of
his life and labors has appeared. It is very difficult to satisfy the craving desire to know
more of the personal life and character of him who has been a household friend so long. Yet
it is rather the privilege of succeeding generations, than of contemporaries, to draw aside
the veil from the sanctuary, and to behold the works of a man in his greatest art,--the art
of life. But the cold waters of the Atlantic, like the river of Death, make the person of a
European artist sacred to us; and it is hard for us to realize that those whom we have surrounded
with a halo of classic reverence were partakers of the daily jar and turmoil of our busy age,--that
the good physician who tended our sick children so faithfully had lived in familiar intercourse
with Goethe, and might have listened to the first performance of those symphonies of Beethoven
which seem to us as eternal as the mountains. Losing the effluence of his personal presence,
which his neighbors and countrymen enjoyed, we demand the privilege of posterity to hear and
tell all that can be told of him. We can wait fifty years more for a biography of Allston,
because something of his gracious presence yet lingers among us; but we can touch Scheffer
only with the burin or the pen. So we shall throw in our mite to fill up this chasm. A few
gleanings from current French literature, a few anecdotes familiarly told of the great artist,
and the vivid recollection of one short interview are all the aids we can summon to enable
our readers to call up in their own minds a living image which will answer to the name that
has so long been familiar to our lips and dear to our hearts.

Ary Scheffer was born about the year 1795, in the town of Dordrecht, in Holland; but, as at
that period Holland belonged to the French Empire, the child was entitled by birth to those
privileges of a French citizen which opened to him important advantages in his artistic career.
French by this accident of birth, and still more so by his education and long residence at
Paris, he yet always retained traces of his Teutonic origin in the form of his head, in his
general appearance, and in his earnest and religious character. He always cherished a warm
affection for his native land.

Many distinguished artists have been the sons of painters or designers of superior note. Raffaello,
Albert Dürer, Alonzo Cano, Vandyck, Luca Giordano are familiar instances. It seems as if the
accumulation of two generations of talent were necessary to produce the fine flower of genius.
The father of Ary Scheffer was an artist of considerable ability, and promised to become an
eminent painter, when he was cut off by an early death. He left a widow, many unfinished pictures,
and three sons, yet very young. The character of the mother we infer only from her influence
on her son, from the devoted affection he bore to her, and from the wisdom with which she guided
his early education; but these show her to have been a true woman,--brave, loving, and always
loyal to the highest. The three sons all lived to middle age, and all became distinguished
men. Ary, the eldest, very early gave unequivocal signs of his future destiny. His countrymen
still remember a large picture painted by him at Amsterdam when only twelve years old, indicating
extraordinary talent, even at that early age. His mother did not, however, overrate this boyish
success, as stamping him a prodigy, but regarded it only as a motive for giving him a thorough
artistic education. He went, accordingly, to Paris, and entered the atelier of Guérin, the
teacher then most in vogue.

It was in the latter days of the Empire that Ary Scheffer commenced his studies,--a period
of great stagnation in Art. The whole force of the popular mind had for many years been turned
to politics and war; and if French Art had striven to emancipate itself from slavish dependence
on the Greek, it still clung to the Roman models, which are far less inspiring. "The autocrat
David, with his correct, but soulless compositions, was more absolute than his master, the
Emperor." Only in the Saloon of 1819 did the Revolution, which had already affected every other
department of thought and life, reach the ateliers. It commenced in that of Guérin. The very
weakness of the master, who himself halted between two opinions, left the pupils in freedom
to pursue their own course. Scheffer did not esteem this a fortunate circumstance for himself.
His own nature was too strong and living to be crushed by a severe master or exact study, and
he felt the want of that thorough early training which would have saved him much struggle in
after life. He used to speak of Ingres as such a teacher as he would have chosen for himself.
From the pupil of David, the admirer of Michel Angelo, the conservator of the sacred traditions
of Art, the student might learn all the treasured wisdom of antiquity,--while the influences
around him, and his own genius, would impel him towards prophesying the hope of the future.
His favorite companions of the atelier at this time were Eugène Delacroix and Géricault. Delacroix
ranks among the greatest living French artists; and if death early closed the brilliant career
of Géricault, it has not yet shrouded his name in oblivion. The trio made their first appearance
together in the Saloon of 1819. Géricault sent his "Wreck of the Medusa," Delacroix "The Barque
of Dante," and Ary Scheffer "The Citizens of Calais."[1]

The works of these friends may be considered as the commencement of the modern French school
of Art, still so little known, and so ill appreciated by us, but which is really an expression
of the new ideas of Art and Humanity which have agitated France to its centre for half a century.
Their hour of triumph has not yet come; but as the poet sings most touchingly of his love,
neither when he rejoices in its happy consummation, nor in the hour of utter despair, but when
doubt still tempers hope,--so does the artist labor with prophetic zeal to express those sentiments
of humanity and brotherhood which are not yet organized into institutions. A careless eye might
have perceived little departure from the old models in these pictures, but a keener one would
have already discovered that Scheffer and his friends worked with a different aim from that
of their predecessors. Not merely to paint a well-composed picture on a classical theme, but
to give expression to thought and feeling, was now the object. "The Wreck of the Medusa" of
Géricault is full of earnest, if niggling life. Delacroix has followed his own bent with such
independent zeal as has made him the object of intense admiration to some, of bitter hatred
to others. But Ary Scheffer has taken his rank at the head of the Spiritualist school, and
has awakened a wider love and obtained a fuller appreciation than either of them. The spirit
which found in them its first expression is continually increasing in power, and developing
into richer life. The living artists of France are the exponents of her genuine Christian democracy.

"The entire collection of Rosa Bonheur's works," says a French writer, "might be called the
Hymn to Labor. Here she shows us the ploughing, there the reaping, farther on the gathering
in of the hay, then of the harvests, elsewhere the vintage,--always and everywhere labor."
Edouard Frère, in his scenes from humble life, which the skilful lithographer places within
the means of all, represents the incidents of domestic existence among the poor. "The Prayer
at the Mother's Knee," "The Woman at her Ironing Table," "The Child shelling Peas," "The Walk
to School amid Rain and Sleet," are all charming idyls of every-day life. With yet greater
skill and deeper pathos does the peasant Millet tell the story of his neighbors. The washerwomen,
as the sun sets upon their labors, and they go wearily homeward; the digger, at his lonely
task, who can pause but an instant to wipe the sweat from his brow; the sewing-women bending
over their work, while every nerve and muscle are strained by the unremitting toil; the girl
tending her geese; the woman her cows:--such are the subjects of his masterly pencil. Do not
all these facts point to the realization of Christian democracy? If the king is now but the
servant of the people, so the artist who is royal in the kingdom of the mind finds his true
glory in serving humanity. What a change from the classic subjects or monkish legends which
occupied the pencils of David and his greater predecessors, Le Sueur and Poussin!

And yet those students of the antique have done French Art good service; they have furnished
it with admirable tools, so that to them we are indebted for the thorough drawing, the masterly
knowledge, which render Paris the great school for all beginners in Art. Such men as we have
named do not scorn the past, but use it in the service of the present. While Scheffer always
subordinated the material part of Art to its expression, he was never afraid of knowing too
much, but often regretted the loss of valuable time in youth from incompetent instruction.

Encouraged by the success of his first essay, Scheffer continued to paint a series of small
pictures, representing simple and affecting scenes from common life, some of which are familiar
to all. "The Soldier's Widow," "The Conscript's Return," "The Orphans at their Mother's Tomb,"
"The Sister of Charity," "The Fishermen before a Storm," "The Burning of the Farm," and "The
Scene of the Invasion in 1814," are titles which give an idea of the range of his subjects
and the tenor of his thoughts at this time. The French have long excelled in the art of composition.
It is this quality which gives the greatest value to the works of Le Sueur and Poussin. Scheffer
possessed this power in a remarkable degree, but it was united to a directness and truth of
feeling which made his art the perfection of natural expression. A very charming little engraving,
entitled "The Lost Children," which appeared in "The Token" for 1830, is probably from a picture
of this period. A little boy and girl are lost in a wood. Wearied with their fruitless attempts
to find a path, the boy has at length sunk down upon a log and buried his face in his hands;
while the little girl, still patient, still hopeful, stands, with folded hands, looking earnestly
into the wood, with a sweet, sad look of anxiety, but not of despair. The contrast in the expression
of the two figures is very touching and very true to Nature;--the boy was hopeful so long as
his own exertions offered a chance of escape, but the courage of the girl appears when earthly
hope is most dim and faint. The sweet unconsciousness of this early picture has hardly been
surpassed by any subsequent work. "Naturalness and the charm of composition," says a French
critic, "are the secrets of Scheffer's success in these early pictures, to which may be added
a third,--the distinction of the type of his faces, and especially of his female heads,--a
kind of suave and melancholy ideal, which gave so new a stamp to his works."

These small pictures were very successful in winning popular favor; but this success, far from
intoxicating the young artist, only opened his eyes to his own faults. He applied himself diligently
to repairing the deficiencies which he recognized in his work, by severe studies and labors.
He knew the danger of working too long on small-sized pictures, in which faults may be so easily
hidden. About the year 1826 he turned resolutely from his "pretty jewels," as he called them,
and commenced his "Femmes Suliotes," on a large canvas, with figures the size of life. M. Vitet
describes the appearance of the canvas when Scheffer had already spent eight days "in the fire
of his first thought." It seemed to him rather like a vision than a picture, as he saw the
dim outlines of those heroic women, who cast themselves from the rock to escape slavery by
death. He confesses that the finished picture never moved him as did the sketch. Three years
earlier Scheffer had sent to the Saloon of 1824, in company with three or four small pictures,
a large picture of Gaston de Foix after the Battle of Ravenna. It was a sombre picture, painted
with that lavish use of pigment and that unrestrained freedom which distinguished the innovators
of that day. The new school were in raptures, and claimed Scheffer as belonging to them. The
public judged less favorably; "they admired the noble head of Gaston de Foix, but, uninterested
in the remainder of the picture, they turned off to look at 'The Soldier's Widow.'" Scheffer
did not listen to his flatterers; but, remembering Michel Angelo's words to the young sculptor,
"The light of the public square will test its value," he believed in the verdict of the people,
and never again painted in the same manner. It was one of his peculiar merits, that, although
open to conviction, and ready to try a new path which seemed to offer itself, he was also ready
to turn from it when he found it leading him astray. "Les Femmes Suliotes" did not seem to
have been designed by the same hand or with the same pencil as the "Gaston de Foix." The first
sketch was particularly pleasing,--already clear and harmonious in color, although rather low
in tone. Many counselled him to leave the picture, thus. "No," said Scheffer, "I did not take
a large canvas merely to increase the size of my figures and to paint large in water-colors,
but to give greater truth and thoroughness to my forms." In 1827 this picture was exhibited
with ample success, and the critics were forced to acknowledge the great improvement in his
style, although he had not entirely escaped from the influence of his companions, and some
violent contrasts of color mar the general effect. The picture is now in the Luxembourg Gallery.

M. Vitet divides Scheffer's artistic life into three portions: that in which he painted subjects
from simple life; that devoted to poetic subjects; and the last, or distinctively religious
period. These divisions cannot, of course, be very sharply drawn, but may help us to understand
the progress of his mind; and "Les Femmes Suliotes" will mark the transition from the first
to the second period. Turning from the simple scenes of domestic sorrow, he now sought inspiration
in literature. The vigorous and hearty Northern Muse especially won his favor; yet the greatest
Italian poet was also his earnest study. Goethe, Schiller, Byron, Dante, all furnished subjects
for his pencil. The story of Faust and Margaret took such hold of his imagination that it pursued
him for nearly thirty years. Their forms appeared before him in new attitudes and situations
almost to his last hour, so that, in the midst of his labors on religious pictures, he seized
his pencils to paint yet another Faust, another Margaret. Nor can we wonder at this absorbing
interest, when we reflect on the profound significance and touching pathos of this theme, which
may wear a hundred faces, and touch every chord of the human heart. It is intellect and passion,
in contrast with innocence and faith; it is natural and spontaneous love, thwarted by convention
and circumstance; it is condemnation before men, and forgiveness before God; it is the ideal
and the worldly; it is an epitome of human life,--love, joy, sorrow, sin,--birth, life, death,
and the sure hope of resurrection. How pregnant with expression was it to a mind like Scheffer's,
where the intellectual, the affectional, and the spiritual natures were so nicely blended!
He first painted "Margaret at her Wheel," in 1831,--accompanied by a "Faust tormented by Doubt."
These were two simple heads, each by itself, like a portrait, but with all the fine perception
of character which constitutes an ideal work. Next he painted "Margaret at Church." Here other
figures fill up the canvas; but the touching expression of the young girl, whose soul is just
beginning to be torn by the yet new joy of her love and the bitter consciousness of her lost
innocence, fills the mind of the spectator. This is the most inspired and the most touching
of all the pictures; it strikes the key-note of the whole story; it is the meeting of the young
girl's own ideal world of pure thought with the outward world. The sense of guilt comes from
the reflection in the thoughts of those about her; and where all before was peace and love,
now come discord and agony;--she has eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and is
already cast out of her paradise. "Margaret on the Sabbath," "Margaret going out of Church,"
and "Margaret walking in the Garden," are all charming idyls, but have less expression. The
last picture, painted just before Scheffer's death, and soon to be engraved, represents "Margaret
at the Fountain." "It is full of expression, and paints the joy and pain of love still struggling
in the young girl's heart, while conscience begins to make its chiding voice heard."

The "Mignons" are the best known of all Scheffer's works of this period. The youngest one,
"Mignon regrettant sa Patrie," is the most satisfactory in its simple, unconscious expression.
The wonderful child stands in the most natural attitude, absorbed in her own thought, and struggling
to recall those dim memories, floating in beauty before her mind, which seem almost to belong
to a previous state of existence. There is less of the weird and fantastic than Goethe has
given to her,--but the central, deep nature is beautifully reproduced. "Mignon aspirant au
Ciel," although full of spiritual beauty, is a little more constrained; the longing after her
heavenly home is less naturally expressed than her childish regret; the pose is a little mannered;
and the feeling is more conscious, but less deep. "Mignon with the Old Harper" is far less
interesting; the old man's head does not express that mixture of inspiration and insanity,
the result of a life of love, misery, and wrong, which Goethe has portrayed in this strange
character.

A very different picture, painted at this period, is peculiarly interesting to us as our first
acquaintance among Scheffer's works. An excellent copy or duplicate of it belongs to the Boston
Athenæum. The original is in the Luxembourg at Paris. The subject is taken from Schiller's
ballad of "Count Eberhard." After the victory in which his son has fallen, though the old Count
has said to those who would have paused to mourn his death, "My son is like another man; on,
comrades, to the foe!"--yet now he sits alone in his tent and looks upon the dead body of his
child. The silent grief of the stern old man is very touching. This sorrow, so contrary to
Nature, when old age stands by the grave of youth, always moves the deepest feeling; and Scheffer,
in the noble old man and the brave and beautiful boy before him, has given it its simplest
and most appropriate expression. This picture was painted in 1834. At that period Scheffer
was engaged in some experiments in color, and this sad subject led him to employ the dark tints
of Rembrandt. In 1850 he painted a duplicate of it, lighter and more agreeable in tone. He
painted "The Giaour" and "Medora," from Byron, which pictures we have never seen. The wayward
and morbid Muse of the English Lord does not seem to us a fit inspiration for the pure pencil
of Scheffer.

The well-known composition of "Francesca da Rimini" may well conclude our brief notice of the
pictures of this second epoch. M. Vitet regards it as the most harmonious and complete of all
his works; but we think it has taken less hold on the popular heart than the "Mignons" and
"Margaret." Yet it is a work of great skill and beauty. The difficult theme is managed with
that moderation and good taste which recognize the true limits of the art. The crowd of spirits
which Dante so powerfully describes as driven by the wind without rest are only dimly seen
in the background. The horrors of hell are shown only in the anguish of those faces, in the
despairing languor of the attitude, which not even mutual love can lighten. The love which
made them one in guilt, one in condemnation, is stronger than death, stronger than hell; but
it cannot bring peace and joy to these souls shut out from heaven and God.

    "Se fosse amico il Re dell' universo,
    Noi pregheremmo."

But even prayer is denied to him who feels that he has not God for a friend. There is no mark
of physical torture; it is pure spiritual suffering,--restless, aimless weariness,--the loss
of hope; it is death,--and love demands life. How strangely appropriate is this punishment
of spirits driven hither and thither by the winds, with no hope of rest, to those who reject
the firm anchorage of duty and principle, and allow themselves to float at the mercy of their
impulses and passions! The overpowering compassion and sympathy of the poets is shown in their
earnest faces. Neither here, nor in the well-known "Dante and Beatrice," which is too familiar
to need description, does Scheffer quite do justice to our ideal of the sublime poet of Heaven
and Hell; but neither do the portraits which remain of him. The picture was first exhibited
in 1835. As it had suffered very much in 1850, Scheffer painted a repetition of it, with a
few slight alterations, in which, however, his progress in his art during twenty years was
very evident. This copy is very far superior to the engraving.

About this period Scheffer seems to have wandered a little from the true mission of Art, and
to have esteemed it her province to represent abstract theological truths. His religious feeling
seems to have become morbid, and his natural melancholy intensified. The death of his wife,
and consequent loneliness, may have given this ascetic tinge to his feelings. But we must acknowledge,
if it were so, that the sorrow which oppressed did not embitter his heart, and that a brave
and humane spirit appears even in those works which have the least artistic merit to recommend
them. The "Christus Consolator" is the best known of this class of pictures. It is cold, abstract,
and inharmonious; but its religious spirit and the beautiful truth which it expresses have
won for it a welcome which it seems hardly to merit. Yet it has touching beauty in the separate
figures. The woman who leans so trustingly on her Saviour's arm has a very high and holy face,
whose type we recognize in more than one of his pictures; and the mother and her dead child
form a very touching group. But the various persons are not connected by any common story or
mutual relation, and we feel a want of unity in the whole work. Perhaps the strongest tribute
to its power of expression is the story, that religious publishers found it necessary to blot
out the figure of the slave who takes his place among the recipients of Christ's blessing,
in order to fit their reprint for a Southern market. As a companion to it, he painted the "Christus
Remunerator," which is less interesting. To this same class of pictures we should probably
refer "The Lamentations of Earth to Heaven," which we have never seen, but which is thus described
by M. Anatole de la Lorge:--

"There are also treasures of disappointed pleasure and of bitterness in this picture of 'The
Lamentations of Earth to Heaven,'--dim symbol of human suffering. How does one, in the presence
of this poem, feel filled with the spirit of St. Augustine, the nothingness of what we call
joy, happiness, glory, here below,--delights of a moment, which at most only aid us to traverse
in a dream this valley of tears! Certain pages of 'The City of God,' funeral prayers of Bossuet,
can alone serve us for a comparison, in order to express the effect produced upon those who
have visited this chef d'oeuvre in Ary Scheffer's atelier. Before producing it, the artist
must have thought long, suffered long; for each stroke of the pencil seems to hide a grief,
each figure speaks to you in passing, and utters a complaint, a sigh, a prayer,--sad echoes
of the despair of life! The religious tendency of the thinker is here fully shown; his poetic
sympathy, his aspirations, his dreams, have found a free course. We must mark, also, with what
freedom his lamentations spring from the ground, to carry even to the feet of the Creator the
overwhelming weight of earthly woe. Ary Scheffer's picture is like the epitaph destined some
day for the obsequies of the world; it breathes of death, and has the sombre harmony of the
Miserere. And nevertheless,--a strange thing!--this dreaming painter, who seizes and afflicts
us, is the same man who at the same time reassures and consoles us,--without doubt, because
by dint of spiritualizing our thoughts he raises them above our sufferings, by showing the
consoling light of eternity to those whom he would sever from the deceitful joys of earth."

If the picture be not overcolored by the critic's eye, we must believe this to be the culmination
of the morbidly spiritualistic tendency which we meet in Scheffer's works. Yet it never exists
unrelieved by redeeming qualities. Many will remember the original picture of the "Dead Christ,"
which was exhibited here by an Art Union about ten years ago. The engraving gives but a faint
idea of the touching expression of the whole group. The deathly pallor of the corpse was in
strange harmony with the face of the mother which bent over it, her whole being dissolved in
grief and love. No picture of this scene recalls to us more fully the simple account in the
Gospels. The cold, wan color of the whole scene seems like that gray pall which a public grief
will draw across the sky, even when the meridian sun is shining in its glory. We have seen
such days even in Boston. No wonder that darkness covered the land to the believing disciples
even until the ninth hour.

His "St. Monica," which appeared in 1846, met with great success. "Ruth and Naomi" is yet unknown
to us, but it seems to be a subject specially adapted to his powers. Of those works which he
produced within the last twelve years, very few are yet engraved. When thus placed before the
public, we believe the popular estimate of Scheffer will be raised even higher than at present.

His pictures of Christ are of very superior merit. His representation of the person of Jesus
was not formal and conventional, but fresh in expression and feeling, and full of touching
pathos and sentiment. He has neither the youthful beauty with which the Italians represent
him, nor the worn and wasted features which the early Germans often gave him, but a thoughtful,
earnest, tender beauty. The predominant expression is the love and tenderness born of suffering.
Three of his finest representations of the life of Jesus of Nazareth are, "The Christ weeping
over Jerusalem," the "Ecce Homo," and "The Temptation." The last is as original in design and
composition; it is noble in expression. The two figures stand on the summit of a mountain,
and the calm, still air around them gives a wonderful sense of height and solitude. You almost
feel the frost of the high, rare atmosphere. Satan is a very powerful figure,--not the vulgar
devil, but the determined will, the unsanctified power. The figure of Christ is simple and
expressive,--even the flow of the drapery being full of significance and beauty. Another composition
of great beauty represents a group of souls rising from earth, and soaring upwards to heaven.
The highest ones are already rejoicing in the heavenly light, while those below seem scarcely
awakened from the sleep of death. The whole picture is full of aspiration; everything seems
mounting upwards.

Scheffer also painted a few pictures which can hardly be called his own. Such are "The Battle
of Tolbiac," and "Charlemagne dictating his Statutes." These were painted by the command of
Louis Philippe, who was his constant friend and patron. The young princes were his pupils;
and Scheffer was careful to form them to better taste than that of the citizen monarch who
has lined Versailles with poor pictures. For the King he painted "The Battle of Tolbiac," and
we can only regret the time which was thus wasted; but for his pupils he designed "Francesca
da Rimini" and the "Mignons."

A few masterly portraits by Scheffer's hand indicate his power of reproducing individual character.
Among these we may name that of his mother, which is said to be his finest work,--one of the
Queen,--a picture of Lamennais,--and another of Emilia Manin, to which we shall again refer.
He occasionally modelled a bust, and sometimes engaged in literary labor, contributing some
valuable articles on Art to "La Revue Française."

It would be impossible for us to analyze or even enumerate all of Scheffer's works. They are
scattered throughout France and Holland, and a few have found their way to this country. Most
of the engravings from his pictures are too well known to require description; and we feel
that we have said enough to justify our placing Scheffer in the high rank which we claim for
him. Engravings give us a juster idea of the French than of the Dutch or Italian artists; for
their merit is rather in design and composition than in color. We agree with M. Vitet, that
color need not be a prominent excellence in a work of high spiritual beauty, and that it should
always be toned to a complete harmony with the prevailing feeling of the picture. In this aspect
we look upon the cold color of the "Dead Christ" as hardly a defect; it is in keeping with
the sad solemnity of the scene. But if color should not be so brilliant as to overpower the
expression of form and sentiment, still less should it be so inharmonious as to distract the
mind from it, as is sometimes the case with Scheffer. The "Dante and Beatrice" is a familiar
instance. We can see no reason why Beatrice should be dressed in disagreeable pink, and Dante
in brick-red. Surely, such color is neither agreeable to the eye nor harmonious with the expression
of the scene. This defect in color has led many to prefer the engravings to Scheffer's original
pictures; but no copy can quite reproduce the nice touches of thought and feeling given by
the master's hand. Color is supposed by many to belong mainly to the representation of physical
beauty; but has not Allston proved to us that the most subtile and delicate harmonies of color
may be united with ethereal grace and spiritual beauty? Compare his "Beatrice" with that of
Scheffer. But, in truth, the whole spiritual relation of color is yet but dimly understood;
and there are, perhaps, influences in the climate and organization of the French nation which
have rendered them inferior in this department of Art. Allowing this deduction--a great one,
certainly,--still, if the expression of the highest thoughts in the most beautiful forms be
the true aim of Art, Scheffer must rank among the very first painters of his age. Delaroche
may surpass him in strength and vigor of conception, and in thorough modelling and execution;
but Scheffer has taken a deeper hold of the feelings, and has risen into a higher spiritual region.

It has been reproachfully said that Scheffer is the painter for pretty women, for poets, and
for lovers. The reproach is also a eulogium, since he must thus meet the demand of the human
soul in its highest and finest development. Others have accused him of morbid sensibility.
There is reason for the charge. He has not the full, round, healthy, development which belongs
to the perfect type of Art. Compare the "St. Cecilia" of Scheffer--this single figure, with
such womanly depth of feeling, such lofty inspiration, yet so sad--with the joyous and almost
girlish grace of Raphael's representation of the same subject, and we feel at once the height
and the limitation of Scheffer's genius. There is always pathos, always suffering; we cannot
recall a single subject, unless it be the group of rising spirits, in which struggle and sorrow
do not form the key-note.

    "In all your music, one pathetic minor
        Your ears shall cross;
    And all fair sights shall mind you of diviner,
        With sense of loss."

This is one view of human life, but it is a transitional and imperfect one,--neither that of
the first healthy unconsciousness of childhood, nor of the full consciousness of a soul which
has risen to that height of divine wisdom which feels the meaning of all suffering, of all
life. The music of Beethoven expresses the struggle, the contest, the sufferings of humanity,
as Art has never done before; but it always contains an eternal prophecy, rather than a mournful
regret,--and in the last triumphant symphony it swells onward and upward, until at last it
bursts forth in all the freedom and gush of song, and its theme is "The Hymn to Joy." How much
the fatherless home of Scheffer's childhood, how much his own desolated life, when his beloved
companion was so early taken from his side, may have had to do with this melancholy cast of
thought, or how far it belonged to his delicate physical constitution, we are not prepared
to say. It becomes less prominent in his later compositions, "as faith became stronger and
sight clearer"; and perhaps in those pictures yet unknown to us we may find still brighter
omens of the new life of rest and joy into which he has entered.

If we turn from Scheffer's works to his life, our task is no less grateful and pleasing. The
admiration and affection which his countrymen express for his character surpass even what they
feel for his works. He was a noble, generous, active, benevolent friend of humanity. He gave
freely to all who were in need, counsel, money, advice, personal care, and love. Young artists
found him ever ready to help them. "He gave them," says M. Vitet, "home, atelier, material,
sympathy,--whatever they needed." Another writer, M. Anatole de la Lorge, said of him, while
yet living,--"Ary Scheffer has the rare good luck not to be exclusive. His heart can pity every
suffering as fully as his pencil can portray it. A faithful and intimate friend of a now fallen
dynasty, (that of Orléans,) proud, even distrustful towards men in power, indifferent to their
opinion, inaccessible to their offers, Ary Scheffer, in his original individuality, is one
of the most independent and most honorable political men of our country. His studio is the
rendezvous of all opinions, provided they are honest,--of all religions, provided they are
sincere. There each one is received, not according to the habit which he wears, as the ancient
proverb says, but according to the mind (esprit) which he has shown. We say mind, but it is
heart that we should say; for Ary Scheffer seems to us to estimate the latter more highly than
the former. His whole life proves it." Always an ardent friend of liberty, he was also a lover
of law and order, and he rendered good service in their preservation in the capital during
the Revolution of 1848, for which, he received honorable distinction.

The same writer quoted above gives an interesting description of his meeting with Ary Scheffer
in the sick-room and by the death-bed of an Italian refugee, Emilia Manin. A young Venetian
girl, full of devotion to her country and her proscribed father, she supported her exile with
all a woman's courage, buoyed up by the hope of returning to her country, redeemed from its
misery. She is described as possessing extraordinary powers of mind and great beauty of person.
There were no questions, however sublime or abstract, which she did not treat with a surprising
depth and sagacity. "Her speech, ordinarily timid and feeble, became emphatic and stirring;
her great, dreamy eyes suddenly acquired unequalled energy; she spoke of the misfortunes of
her country in terms so moving as to draw tears from our eyes." But the body which contained
this burning soul was very frail, "and the poor Emilia, the silent martyr, turned her head
upon her pillow, and took her first hour of repose. When no longer able to speak, she had traced
with a trembling hand on a paper these last words,--'Oh, Venice! I shall never see thee more!'
She yet retained the position in which she drew her last breath, when Ary Scheffer came, as
Tintoret formerly came to the bedside of his daughter, to retrace, with a hand unsteady through
emotion, the features of Emilia Manin. This holy image, snatched by genius from death, is one
of the most admirable works we have ever seen. She lies there, extended and cold,--the poor
child!--in that peace unknown to the life which she had lived in the body. It is, indeed, the
intelligent brow from which the inspiration of her soul seemed to speak. It is the delicate
mouth and the pale lips, which, never uttering a murmur, betrayed the celestial goodness of
her heart. In truth, it would have been difficult to hide our emotion, in recognizing--thanks
to the pure devotion of the painter--the touching features of this innocent victim, whom we
had known, loved, and venerated during her life. Some hours later, we again found Ary Scheffer
sustaining with us the tottering steps of Manin upon the freshly removed earth which was soon
to cover the coffin of his child."

By the same loving and faithful hand were traced the features of the Abbé de Lamennais, a name
so dear to those who live in the hope of new progress and liberty for humanity. "At the moment,"
says M. de la Lorge, "when death was yet tearing this great genius from the earth, the pencil
of the artist restored him, in some sense alive, in the midst of us all, his friends, his disciples,
his admirers. Hereafter, thanks to the indefatigable devotion of Ary Scheffer, we shall be
permitted to see again the meagre visage, the burning eyes, the sad and energetic features
of the Breton Apostle."

Into the domestic life of Scheffer it is not at present our privilege to enter. Some near friend--the
brother, the daughter, the wife--may, perhaps, hereafter, lift the veil from the sacred spot,
and reveal him to us in those relations which most deeply affect and most truly express a man's
inmost nature. We close this notice with some slight sketch of his life in the atelier.

None could enter this room without a feeling of reverence and sacredness. In the failing light
of a November afternoon, all was subdued to a quiet and religious tone. Large and commodious
in size, it was filled with objects of the deepest interest. Nothing was in disorder; there
was no smoke, no unnecessary litter; yet everywhere little sketches or hints of pictures were
perceptible among the casts, which one longed to bring forth into the light. A few portraits
especially dear to him--best of all, that of his mother--were on the walls; a few casts of
the finest statues--among others, that of the Venus de Milo--around the room. His last copy
of the "Francesca da Rimini," and the original picture of "The Three Marys," and the yet unfinished
"Temptation on the Mount," were all there. On the easel stood the picture of the "Group of
Spirits ascending to Heaven." Such was the aspect of this celebrated atelier, as we saw it
in 1854. But "the greatest thing in the room was the master of it." Ary Scheffer was then about
sixty years of age, but was still healthy and fresh in appearance. His face was rather German
than French, and bore the stamp of purity and goodness in every line; but the eyes especially
had the fire of genius tempered by gentleness and love. It was a face which satisfied you at
once, answering to all you could ask of the painter of "Mignon," and the "Christus Consolator."
His manner was quiet and reserved, but courteous. Unconscious modesty was the peculiar charm
of his appearance. One of our party said that he reminded him strongly of Allston. It was a
reverend presence, which forbade common topics, and strangers thus meeting had few words to
say. As we turned away, we knew that we should never meet again on earth; but we had gained
a new life, and we had beheld, as it were, the face of an angel.

Two American artists stood with us in that room: one a fair young girl, whose purity of soul
was mirrored in her beautiful face, who had gone to Paris to continue her studies in an art
which she loved as she did her life; the other, a man of mature age, whose high and reverent
genius has always met with a loving and faithful appreciation among his countrymen, which does
them as much honor as it did him. The young girl lay down to die amid her labors, and her frail
body rests amid the flowers and trees of Montmartre; the grown man came home but to bid farewell
to home, friends, and life; the great artist whom we met to honor has gone home too. A threefold
halo of sanctity rests on that room to us.

To those who shared the privilege of Scheffer's friendship this room was endeared by hours
of the richest social enjoyment. His liberal hospitality welcomed all ranks and all classes.
It is related that Louis Philippe once sat waiting for him in the atelier, and answered a knock
at the door. The visitor was delivering his messages to him, when the artist returned, and
was somewhat surprised to find his royal friend playing the part of concierge. "It was not
rare to meet in this atelier the great men of finance, who counted themselves among his most
passionate admirers." Here was conversation, not without gayety, but without loud laughter
or revelry. Scheffer was very fond of music of the highest order. He was a generous patron
of musicians, and loved to listen to music while he was engaged in painting. His friends sometimes
held an extemporaneous concert in his room, without preparation, programme, or audience. Think
of listening to an andante of Mozart's, played in that room! "Music doubled her power, and
painting seemed illuminated." Beethoven was his favorite composer; his lofty genius harmonized
with, and satisfied the longings of, Scheffer's aspiring nature.

Ary Scheffer was a personal friend of the Orléans family. He was, however, an ardent lover
of liberty; and his hospitalities were free to all shades of opinion. He did not forsake this
family when their star went down. Hearing of the death of Hélène, the Duchess of Orléans, he
hastened to England, to pay a last tribute of love and respect to her memory. The English climate
had always been ungenial to him. He took a severe cold, which proved fatal in its results.
He died soon after his return to Paris, on the 16th of June, 1858. Sadly as the news of his
death struck upon our hearts, it seemed no great change for him to die. So pure and holy was
his life, so spiritual his whole nature, so lofty his aspirations, that it seemed as if

    "He might to Heaven from Paradise go,
    As from one room to another."

Ary Scheffer was twice married. His first wife died early. Many years after her death he again
married,--very happily, as we have heard. He leaves behind him one daughter, who is also an
artist. Under her loving care, we trust every relic of his artistic labors and every trait
of his personal life will be faithfully preserved.

Both his brothers lived to middle age. One, of whom we know little but that M. Vitet calls
him "a distinguished man," died in 1855. The only surviving brother, Henri, is also a painter,
of considerable reputation. He is a thorough and accomplished draughtsman, and a superior teacher.
His atelier is one of the few in Paris which are open to women, and several American ladies
have enjoyed its advantages.

We have spoken of Scheffer's love for his native country. By his will he bequeathed to his
native town of Dordrecht "the portrait of Sir J. Reynolds, by Scheffer; a dog lying down, life-size,
by the same; a copy of the picture of the 'Christus Remunerator,' on pasteboard, of the size
of the original in England; a copy of the 'Christus Consolator,'--both by himself: also, his
own statue, in plaster; his own bust, by his daughter; and the Virgin and Infant Jesus, by
himself." The town of Dordrecht proposes to erect a statue in commemoration of the fame of
the great artist.

It is too early to assign to Ary Scheffer the rank which he will finally occupy in the new
era of French Art which is coeval with his labors. He will always stand as the companion of
Ingres and Delaroche and Géricault; and if his successors surpass him even in his own path,
they will owe much to him who helped to open the way. He lived through times of trouble, when
a man's faith in humanity might well be shaken, yet he remained no less a believer in and lover
of mankind. Brighter days for France may lead her artists to a healthier and freer development;
but they can never be more single-hearted, true, and loving than Ary Scheffer.

gives a graphic description of the effect it produced upon her, in her "Sunny Memories of Sunny
Lands."

A VISIT TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD.

We have all, in our days of atlases and "the use of the globes," been made aware of the fact,
that off the southern shore of Massachusetts lies a long and narrow island, called Martha's
Vineyard, one of the many defences thrown out by the beleaguered New England coast against
its untiring foe, the Atlantic.

But how many are those who know more than this? How many have visited it, inquired into its
traditions, classified its curiosities, mineral, saline, and human? How many have seen Gay
Head and the Gay-Head Indians? Not many, truly; and yet the island is well worth a visit, and
will repay the tourist better for his time and labor than any jaded, glaring, seaside watering-place,
with its barrack of white hotel, and its crowd of idle people.

In the first place, the delicious suggestiveness of the name,--Martha's Vineyard! At once we
ask, Who was Martha? and how did she use her vineyard? Was she the thrifty wife of some old
Puritan proprietor of untamed acres?--and did she fancy the wild grapes of this little island,
fuller of flavor, and sweeter for the manufacture of her jellies and home-made wine, than those
which grew elsewhere?--and did she come in the vintage season, with her children and her friends,
to gather in the rich purple clusters, bearing them back as did the Israelitish spies, to show
the fatness of the promised land?

It was one of the fairest days of the Indian summer, when Caleb, Mysie, and the Baron (a young
gentleman four years old) set gayly forth to explore this new and almost unknown region.

The first stage of their journey was New Bedford; and at the neat and quiet hotel where they
spent the night, Caleb ascertained that the steamer "Eagle's Wing" would leave its wharf, bound
to the Vineyard.

Pending this event, the trio wandered about the quiet wharves, inspecting the shipping, and
saturating themselves with nautical odors and information. They discovered that whaleships
are not the leviathans of the deep which Mysie had supposed them, being very rarely of a thousand
tons, and averaging five hundred. They were informed that whaling has ceased to be a profitable
occupation to any but the officers of the ships, the owners frequently making only enough to
repay their outlay from a voyage which has brought the captain and first mate several thousand
dollars each.

Every member of a whaleship's crew, from the captain down to the cabin-boy, is paid, not fixed
wages, but a "lay," or share of the profits of the voyage. Formerly, these "lays" were so graduated,
that the chief advantage of the expedition was to the owners; but, of late years, matters have
altered, so that now it is not uncommon for the captain to receive a twelfth, tenth, or even
eighth of the entire profit, and the other officers in proportion.

The attention of our travellers was now directed to numerous squares and plateaus of great
black objects buried in seaweed; these, they were informed, were casks of oil, stored in this
manner instead of in warehouses, as less liable to leakage.

It was also asserted, as a fact, that the sperm whale, alarmed at the untiring rigor of his
assailants, has almost disappeared from the navigable waters, retreating to the fastnesses
of the Frozen Ocean, where he is still pursued, although at the greatest peril, by the dauntless
New Bedford, Nantucket, and Vineyard whalemen, who, as the narrator proudly stated, have, time
and again, come out unscathed from the perils under which Franklin and his crew succumbed.
Many a man now walks the streets of these seaports who has conversed with the Esquimaux last
in company with that ill-fated crew.

Full-fed with maritime and oleaginous lore, our travellers at last embarked upon the "Eagle's
Wing," bound down the Vineyard Sound. As the steamer gained its offing, the view of New Bedford
was very picturesque, reminding one of Boston seated at the head of her beautiful bay. The
passage through the islands, though not long, is intricate, requiring skilful pilotage; and
as the boat passed through the channel called Wood's Hole, certain feeble-minded sisters were
positive that all on board were bound to immediate destruction; and, in truth, the reefs, between
which the channel lies, approach too closely to leave much room for steering. The perils of
the vasty deep, however, were finally surmounted, and the steamer made fast to its wharf at
Holmes's Hole, one of the two principal ports of Martha's Vineyard.

Our trio disembarked, and found themselves at once the subjects of fierce contention to no
less than three aspirants for the honor of conveying them and their luggage to their point
of destination. One of these, called Dave, was a grave, saturnine Yankee, his hands in the
pockets of his black trousers, his costume further exhibiting the national livery of black
dress coat, black satin waistcoat and necktie, cow-hide boots, and stiff, shiny hat, very much
upon the back of his head. The languid and independent offers of this individual were, however,
quite drowned by the flood of vociferous overtures from his two rivals,--an original youth,
about eighteen years old, and a man, or rather mannikin, who, judging by his face, might be
in his fiftieth, and, by his back, in his tenth year.

Mannikin first succeeded in gaining the attention of Caleb,--the efforts of Mysie, meanwhile,
barely sufficing to restrain the Baron from plunging over the side of the wharf, in his anxiety
to witness the departure of the steamboat. Mannikin, asserting earnestly that he had a "good
conveyance" close at hand, danced around the group with vehement gesticulations, intended to
strike despair into the souls of his two adversaries, who, nevertheless, retained their ground,--Dave
lounging in the middle distance, a grim smile of derision upon his face, and Youth dodging
in with loud offers of service, wherever Mannikin left a point undefended.

Caleb, at last, demanding to see the "good conveyance," was led away to the head of the wharf,
when Youth at once seized the opportunity to rush in, and breathlessly inquire of Mysie,--

"Wher' ye goin', Ma'am? Wher' ye want to be kerried?"

"We are going to Gay-Head Light-house; but my"--

"Ga'ed Light? I kin kerry ye there fust-rate, and cheap too;--kerry ye there for two dollars!"

"My husband has already spoken"--

"Wat! t' ole Ransom? Wy, he a'n't got nothin' but a weelbarry." And Caleb, returning at the
same moment with a somewhat perplexed air, corroborated this statement by saying,--

"This man has no carriage, but will get us one in a short time."

"But this boy," retorted Mysie, "says he has a carriage, and will carry us to Gay Head for
two dollars."

"You hear that, ole feller?--they're a-goin' with me!" crowed triumphant Youth at disconcerted
Mannikin, who nevertheless rapidly proceeded to pile the luggage upon his barrow and trundle
it away.

This coup d'état was checked by Caleb, but afterward allowed, upon discovering that Youth's
carriage was still reposing in his father's stable, "jist up here"; and Mannikin was consoled
by being allowed to earn a quarter of a dollar by transporting the luggage to that destination.
The procession at once set forth, including Dave, who strolled in the rear, softly whistling,
and apparently totally unconcerned, yet all the while alive with feline watchfulness.

Arrived at the stable, the travellers were requested to wait there while Youth went to find
his father and "borry a wip."

At these last words, a "subtle smile, foreboding triumph," broke over Dave's composed features,
as he muttered,--

"Reckin you'll need one 'fore you reach Ga'ed Light."

The coast clear, Dave became a little more communicative, expatiated upon the dangers and discomforts
of the road, the incapacity of Youth's horse, and the improbability that his father would ratify
the bargain, concluding by offering to "do the job himself in good shape for four dollars,"
which offer was held in abeyance until we should learn the result of Youth's interview with
his father.

In the mean time, a matron suddenly made her appearance in the barn, with a hospitable entreaty
that "the woman and child" would come up to the house and warm themselves; and Caleb strongly
advocating the Idea, Mysie and the Baron proceeded houseward.

About half-way they encountered Paterfamilias, hastening with Youth toward the barn, and to
him Matron at once recapitulated the affair, concluding with mentioning the stipulated price.
At this Pater turned, with thunderous brow, toward Youth; but Matron interposed, with womanly
tact,--

"You can do jest as you like, you know, about lettin' him go; but Dave's in the barn."

"Dave in my barn! Wat in thunder's he doin' there? Yes, go, boy,--go for nothin', if they ask
you to, sooner than let that"--

The rest of the sentence was lost in the distance. But Mysie, following her guide to the house,
felt quite sure of their conveyance; and, in fact, barely sufficient time elapsed for the hostess
to possess herself of the leading facts in her guests' history, before the carriage was announced,
and our travellers hastened down the lane, and found there awaiting them the evident model
of the Autocrat's "One-Hoss Shay," in its last five years of senility;--to this was attached
a quadruped who immediately reminded Mysie of a long-forgotten conundrum.

"What was the first created animal?"

Ans. "Shay-'oss."

Holding him ostentatiously by the head stood Youth, the "borried" whip flourished in his right
hand, as he invited his passengers to seat themselves without reference to him.

This being done and the seat pretty thoroughly filled, Youth perched himself upon a bag and
valise, which filled the front of the vehicle, and the journey commenced.

That ride! The first mile was not passed before the meaning of Dave's malicious smile, at mention
of a whip, became painfully apparent; for never was weapon more perseveringly used, or with
so little result, the cunning old beast falling into a jog-trot at the commencement, from which
no amount of vociferation or whipping could move him.

"I wouldn't hurry him so much," interposed Mysie, her compassion aroused both for beast and
Youth. "I don't like to see a horse whipped so much."

"Oh, you see, Ma'am, he's so used to it, he won't go noways without it; feels kind o' lonesome,
I 'xpect. It don't hurt him none, nuther; his skin's got so thick an' tough, that he wouldn't
know, if you was to put bilin' tar on him."

"Do you feed your horse on oats, much?" inquired Caleb, gravely, after a long and observant
silence.

"No, Sir, we darsn't give him no oats, 'cause he'd be sure to run away; doos sometimes, as it is."

"I don't think you need fear it to-day," replied Caleb, quietly, as he settled himself into
the corner, in the vain hope of a nap; but Youth was now loquaciously inclined.

"Reck'n Dave was disappinted," said he, with a chuckle. "He meant to kerry ye himself; but
soon's I see him round, I says to myself, says I, 'Ole Chick, you sha'n't come it this time,
if I go for nothin'.'"

"Competition is the soul of trade," drowsily murmured Caleb; but as Youth turned to inquire,
"Whossay?" the bag upon which he was seated, and upon which, in the enjoyment of his triumph,
he had been wriggling somewhat too vivaciously, suddenly gave way, and a pair of snow-white
hose came tumbling out. They were at once caught and held admiringly up by Youth, with the
ingenuous remark,--

"How wite them looks! An' if you'll blieve it, mine was jest as clean yis'day mornin',--an'
now you look at 'em!" To facilitate which inspection, the speaker conscientiously drew up his
corduroys, so as fully to display a pair of home-knit socks, which certainly had wofully deteriorated
from the condition ascribed to them "yis'day mornin'."

"You see, I went clammin' las' night," pursued Youth; "an' that's death on clo's."

"What's clammin'?" inquired the Baron, changing the subject with unconscious tact, and quite
surprised at the admiring kiss bestowed upon him by his mother, while Youth, readjusting his
corduroys, replied with astonishment,--

"Clammin'? Wy, clammin's goin' arter clams; didn't ye never eat no clam-chowder?"

"N-o, I don't think I ever did," replied the Baron, reflectively. "Is it like ice-cream?"

"Well, I never eat none o' that, so I dunno," was the reply; and Youth and Child, each regarding
the other with wondering pity, relapsed into silence.

Having now passed from the township of Holmes's Hole into Tisbury, the road lay through what
would have been an oak forest, except that none of the trees exceeded some four feet in height,--Youth
affirming this to be their mature growth, and that no larger ones had grown since the forest
was cleared by the original settlers. A few miles more were slowly passed, and Mysie began
to look hopefully from every eminence for a sight of the light-house, when she was stunned
by the information, that they were then entering Chilmark, and were "'bout half-way."

Caleb, with an exclamation of disgust, leaped from "the shay," and accomplished the remaining
ten miles, wrathfully, on foot,--while Mysie, wrapping her feminine patience about her as a
mantle, resigned herself to endurance; but Youth, noticing, perhaps, her weary and disconsolate
expression, applied himself sedulously to the task of entertaining her; and, as a light and
airy way of opening the conversation, inquired,--

"Was you pooty sick aboard the boat?"

"Not at all."

"That's curous! Women 'most alluz is,--'specially wen it's so ruffly as it is to-day. Was bubby
sick any?"

"No."

"Wa-al, that's very fortnit, for I don't blieve he'll be sick wen he grows up an' goes walin'.
It's pooty tryin', the fust two or three weeks out, ginerally. How young is he a-goin' to begin?"

"I do not think he will ever go to sea."

"Not a-goin' to sea? Wy, his father's a captain, I 'xpect; a'n't he?"

"No."

"Mate, then, a'n't he?"

"He is not a sailor at all."

"Ha'n't never ben to sea?"

"Never."

Oh, the look of wide-mouthed astonishment which took possession of Youth's hitherto vacant
features, at thus encountering a strong-looking man, in the prime of life, who had never been
to sea, and a healthy, sturdy boy, whose parents did not mean that he ever should! He had no
more to say; every faculty was, for at least an hour, devoted to the contemplation of these
lusus naturæ, thus presented to his vision.

At last, the road, which had long been in a condition of ominous second-childhood, suddenly
died a natural death at the foot of a steep hill, where a rail-fence presented itself as a
barrier to farther progress. The bars were soon removed by Youth, who triumphantly announced,
as Cha-os walked slowly through the opening thus presented,--

"Now we're on Ga'ed, an' I'll run along and take down the next bars, if you kin drive. Git
along, Tom,--you ha'n't got nothin' but two feathers ahind you now."

"How far is it to the Light-house?" inquired Mysie, faintly.

"Ony 'bout four mild," was the discouraging reply, as Youth "loped" on in advance.

"Four mild!" and such miles! The only road, a faint track in the grass, now undiscernible in
the gathering gloom, now on the slope of steep hills marked by deep gullies worn by the impetuous
autumn rains, and down which the poor old "shay" jerked along in a series of bumps and jolts
threatening to demolish at once that patriarchal vehicle and the bones of its occupants.

At last, however, from the top of one of these declivities, the brilliant, flashing light of
the long-watched-for Pharos greeted Mysie's despairing eyes, and woke new hopes of warmth,
rest, and shelter. But never did bewildering ignisfatuus retire more persistently from the
pursuit of unwary traveller than did that Light-house from the occupants of that creaking "shay";
and it was not till total darkness had settled upon the earth that they reached its door, and
discovered, by the lamplight streaming out, that Caleb stood in the entrance, awaiting their
arrival.

As the chaise stopped, he came forward and lifted the stiff and weary forms of "the woman and
child" to the ground, and delivered them to the guidance of the hostess.

The first aspect of affairs was somewhat discouraging,--the parlor into which they were ushered
being without fire and but dimly lighted, the bedroom not yet prepared for toilet purposes,
and the hostess, as she averred, entirely unprepared for company.

Left alone in the dreary parlor, Caleb subsided into moody silence, and Mysie into tears, upon
which the Baron followed suit, and produced such a ludicrous state of affairs, that the sobs
which had evoked his changed to an irrepressible laugh, in which all parties soon joined. This
pleasant frame of mind was speedily encouraged and augmented, first, by water and towels ad
libitum, and then by an introduction to the dining-room, in whose ample grate now roared a
fire, of what our travellers were informed was peat,--an article supplying, in the absence
of all other indigenous fuel, nearly every chimney upon the island.

A good cup of tea and a substantial supper prepared the trio to accept the invitation of the
excellent Mr. F. (the chief keeper, and their host) to go up with him "into the Light."

And now our travellers suddenly found that they had made a pilgrimage unawares. They had come
to the island for sea-air and pebbles, to shoot ducks, see the Indians, and find out who Martha
was, and had come to the Light-house, as the only "white" dwelling upon the Head,--the rest
being all occupied by the descendants of the red men,--and now found themselves applauded by
their host for having "come so far to see our Light;--not so far as some, either," continued
he, "for we have had visitors from every part of the Union,--even from Florida; every one who
understands such things is so anxious to see it."

"Why, is it different from common light-houses?" carelessly inquired Caleb.

"Don't you know? Haven't you come on purpose to see it?" asked the keeper, in astonishment,--and
then proceeded to explain, that this is the famous Fresnel light, the identical structure exhibited
at the great Exposition at Paris, bought there by an agent of the United States, and shipped
by him to America.

Owing, however, to some inexplicable blunder, its arrival was not made known to the proper
authorities,--and the papers which should have accompanied it being lost or not delivered,
no one at the custom-house knew what the huge case contained. It was deposited in a bonded
warehouse during the legal interval, but, never having been claimed, was then sold, still unexamined,
to the highest bidder. He soon identified his purchase, and proceeded to make his own profit
out of it,--the consequence being that government at last discovered that the Fresnel light
had been some two years in this country, and was then upon exhibition, if the President and
cabinet would like to take a peep. The particulars of the bargain which ensued did not transpire,
but it resulted in the lantern being repacked and reshipped to Gay Head, its original destination.

While hearing this little history, the party were breathlessly climbing three steep iron staircases,
the last of which ended at a trap-door, giving admittance to the clock-room, where the keeper
generally sits; from here another ladder-like staircase leads up into the lantern. Arrived
at the top, the Baron screamed with delight at the gorgeous spectacle before him.

The lamp (into the four concentric wicks of which a continual and superabundant supply of oil
is forced by a species of clock-work, causing a flame of dazzling brilliancy) is surrounded
by a revolving cover, about eight feet high by four or five in diameter, and in shape like
the hand-glasses with which gardeners cover tender plants, or the shades which one sees over
fancy clocks and articles of bijouterie. This cover is composed of over six hundred pieces
of glass, arranged in a complicated and scientific system of lenses and prisms, very difficult
to comprehend, but very beautiful in the result; for every ray of light from that brilliant
flame is shivered into a thousand glittering arrows, reflected, refracted, tinted with all
the rainbow hues, and finally projected through the clear plate-glass windows of the lantern
with all the force and brilliancy of a hundred rays. If any one cares to understand more clearly
the why and the how, let him either go and see for himself or read about it in Brande's Encyclopædia.
Mysie and the Baron were content to bask ignorantly in the glittering, ever-changing, ever-flowing
flood of light, dreaming of Fairy Land, and careless of philosophy. Only so much heed did they
give to the outer world as always to place themselves upon the landward side of the lantern,
lest unwittingly their forms should hide one ray of the blessed light from those for whose
good it was put there.

Caleb, meanwhile, sat with his host in the clock-room, smoking many a meerschaum, and listening
to the keeper's talk about his beautiful charge,--a pet as well as a duty with him, obviously.

With the same fond pride with which a mother affects to complain of the care she lavishes upon
her darling child would the old man speak of the time necessary to keep his six hundred lenses
clear and spotless, each one being rubbed daily with softest doeskin saturated with rouge,
to keep the windows of the lantern free from constantly accumulating saline incrustations,--of
the care with which the lamp, when burning, must be watched, lest intrusive fly or miller should
drown in the great reservoir of oil and be drawn into the air-passages. This duty, and the
necessity of winding up the "clock" (which forces the oil up into the wick) every half-hour,
require a constant watch to be kept through the night, which is divided between the chief and
two assistant keepers.

The morning after their arrival, our travellers, strong with the vigor of the young day, set
forth to explore the cliffs, bidding adieu to original Youth, who, standing ready to depart,
beside his horse, was carolling the following ditty in glorification of his native town:--

    "Ga'ed Light is out o' sight,
        Menemshee Crik is sandy,
    Holmes's Hole's a pooty place,
        An' Oldtown Pint's onhandy."

(Oldtown being synonymous with Edgartown, the rival seaport.)

Leaving this young patriot to his national anthem, a walk of a few hundred feet through deep
sword-edged grass brought our explorers to the edge of a cliff, down which they gazed with
awe-hushed breath. Below them, at a depth of a hundred and fifty feet, the thunderous waves
beat upon the foot of the cliff over whose brink they peered, and which, stern and impassive
as it had stood for ages, frowned back with the mute strength of endurance upon the furious,
eager waves, which now and again dashed themselves fiercely against its front, only to be flung
back shattered into a thousand glittering fragments.

The cliffs themselves are very curious and beautiful, being composed of red and black ochre,
the largest cliff showing the one color on its northern and the other on its southern face.
The forms are various,--some showing a sheer descent, with no vestige of earth or vegetation,
their faces seamed with scars won in the elemental war which they have so long withstood. In
other spots the cliff has been rent into sharp pinnacles, varied and beautiful in hue.

One spot, in particular, which became Mysie's favorite resort, was at once singular and beautiful
in its conformation. About three feet above the water's edge lay a level plateau, its floor
of loose, sandy, black conglomerate, abounding in sparkling bits of quartz and sulphate of
iron; beneath this lay a bed of beautifully marbled and variegated clay, its edge showing all
along the black border of the plateau like the brilliant wreath with which a brunette binds
her dusky hair. Blocks of this clay, fallen upon the beach, and wet with every flowing wave,
lay glistening in the sunlight and looking like--

"Castile soap, mamma," suggested the Baron, as Mysie was describing the scene in his presence,
and hesitated for a simile.

At the back of the terrace, which, in its widest part, measured some fifty feet, rose suddenly
and sharply the pinnacled cliffs, some snowy white, some black, some deep red, and others a
cold gray. At either hand they extended quite down to the water's edge, so that, seated upon
the plateau, nothing met the eye but ocean, sky, and cliffs; no work of man struck a discordant
note in the grand harmony of these three simple, mighty elements of creation.

Mysie sometimes took a book here with her, but it was not a place to read in; the scene crushed
and dwarfed human thoughts and words to nothingness; and to repeat to the ocean himself what
had been said of him by the loftiest even of poets seemed tame and impertinent.

These cliffs extend about a mile along the shore, and then suddenly give place to a broad sandy
beach, behind which lies a level, desolate moor, treeless, shrubless, and barren of all vegetation,
save coarse grass and weeds, and a profusion of stunted dog-roses, which, in their season,
must throw a rare and singular charm over their sterile home.

The beach, though smooth and even, is not flat, like those of Nantasket, Nahant, and Newport,
but shelves rapidly down; and there is a belief among the islanders, that a short distance
out it terminates suddenly at the brow of a submarine precipice, beyond which are no soundings.

Owing to the sharp declivity of the beach, the rollers break with great force, and the surf
is very high. At one point is grouped a cluster of rocks, half in the water, half on the beach,
among which, as the tide comes in, the waves break with furious force, dashing high over the
outermost barrier, and then plunging and leaping forward, like a troop of wild horses, their
white manes flung high in air, as they leap forward over one and another of the obstacles in
their path.

Perched upon the crest of one of these half-submerged rocks, watching the mad waves fling themselves
exhausted at her feet, it was Mysie's delight to sit, enjoying the half danger of her position,
and retreating only when the waters had many times closed behind her throne, leaving, in their
momentary absence, but a wet and slippery path back to the beach.

Along this beach, too, lay the road to Squipnocket, a pond famed for its immense flocks of
wild geese and ducks,--fame shared by Menemshee Creek and Pond, as well as several others of
similar aboriginal titles.

To these repaired, almost daily, Caleb, accompanied by one or another of his host's five sons;
and the result of their efforts with the gun was no inconsiderable addition to the table at
Ga'ed Light.

But greatest of all the wonders at the Head are the Fossil Cliffs.

A short time after the arrival of our travellers, their hostess inquired if they had yet found
any fossils. Mysie frankly confessed that they did not know there were any to find, which was
evidently as great a surprise to Mrs. F. as their ignorance of the Fresnel light had been to
her husband. She at once offered the services of her daughter Clarissa as guide and assistant,
and gave glowing accounts of the treasures to be found. The offer was gladly accepted; and
Clarissa, a merry little romp, about twelve years old, soon made her appearance, armed with
a pickaxe, hoe, and basket.

Thus laden, and in the teeth of a shrewd northeast wind, the little barefooted pioneer led
the way directly over the brow of a cliff, which, had Mysie been alone, she would have pronounced
entirely impracticable. Now, however, fired with a lofty emulation, she silently followed her
guide, grasping, however, at every shrub and protection with somewhat convulsive energy.

"Here's a good place," announced Clarissa, pausing where a shelf of gravelly rock afforded
tolerable foothold. "Professor Hitchcock told father that in here were strata of the tertiary
formation, and there's where we get the fossils."

"But how do you come at the tertiary formation through all this sand and gravel?" asked Mysie,
aghast at the prospect.

"Oh, dig; that's why I brought the pick and hoe; we must dig a hole about a foot deep, and
then we shall come to the stuff that has the fossils in it. You may have the hoe, and I'll
take the pick, 'cause that's the hardest."

"Then let me have it; I am stronger than you," exclaimed Mysie, suddenly roused to enthusiasm
at the idea of "picking" her way into the tertiary formation of the earth, and exhuming its
fossilized remains.

Seizing the pickaxe, she aimed a mighty blow at the clay and gravel conglomerate before her;
but the instrument, falling wide of its intended mark, struck upon a rock, and sent such a
jarring thrill up both her arms and such a tingle to her fingers' ends as suddenly quenched
her antiquarian zeal, and reminded her of a frightful account she once read of a convent of
nuns captured by some brutal potentate, who forced them to mend his highways by breaking stones
upon them with very heavy hammers; and the historian mentioned, as a common occurrence, that,
when any sister dislocated her shoulder, one of her comrades would set it, and the sufferer
would then resume her labors.

Mysie, having this warning before her eyes, and being doubtful of Clarissa's surgical abilities,
concluded to postpone her researches, and proposed to her companion to fill the basket with
shells and pebbles from the beach, to which cowardly proposition Clarissa yielded but a reluctant
consent.

The next day, however, Mr. F. and Caleb, learning the result of the fossil-search, offered
to apply their more efficient skill and strength to a new attempt in the same direction; and,
with high hopes for the result, Mysie, still accompanied by Clarissa, proceeded to another
portion of the cliffs, where a low, wedge-shaped promontory, shadowed by beetling crags, was,
as Mr. F. confidently stated, "sure for teeth."

The pickaxe, in the sinewy arms of its owner, soon dislodged great cakes of the upper deposit
and laid bare a stratum of olive-green clay, which was announced to be a fossil-bed. Lumps
of this clay being broken off and crumbled up, proved indeed rich in deposit. They found sharks'
teeth, the edges still sharply serrated, firmly set in pieces of the jawbone,--whales' teeth,--vertebrae
of various species,--fragments of bone, great and small,--several species of shell-fish, among
which chiefly abounded a kind called quahaug,--and many nondescript fragments, not easily classified.
One of these was a little bone closely resembling the tibia of a child's leg, and may have
belonged to some antediluvian infant lost at sea, (if Noah's ancestors were mariners,) or perhaps
drowned in the Deluge,--for Mr. F. quoted an eminent geologist who has visited the Vineyard,
and who supposed these remains to have been brought here by that mighty Flood-tide. Another
savant, however, supposes the island to have been thrown up from the sea by volcanic action;
and that the fossils, now imbedded in cliffs a hundred feet high, were once deposited upon
the bed of the ocean. There is certainly a great amount of conglomerate, which has evidently
been fused by intense heat; and masses of rock, sea-pebbles, sand, and iron-ore are now as
firmly integrated as a piece of granite.

However, the fossils came; here they certainly are; many of them perfect in form, and light
and porous to the eye, but all hard and heavy as stone to the touch. Teeth, which are considered
the most valuable of all the remains, are sometimes found as wide as a man's hand, and weighing
several pounds; but Mysie was quite content with the more insignificant weight of those which
filled her basket, especially when an immense reticulated paving-stone was added, which Mr.
F. pronounced to be a whale's vertebra. She then was induced to trust the precious collection
to Caleb's care, the more willingly that the ascent of the cliffs was now to be attempted.
This was easily and quickly accomplished by Mr. F. and his little son, by going to the right
spot before beginning to climb; but Mysie declaring that the ascent was quite practicable where
they were, Caleb and Clarissa felt bound in honor to accompany her. For some distance, all
went very well,--the face of the cliff presuming slight inequalities of surface, which answered
for foot-and hand-holds, and not being very steep; but suddenly Mysie, the leader of the group,
arriving within about three feet of the top, found the rock above her so smooth as to give
no possible foothold by which she might reach the strong, coarse grass which nodded tauntingly
to her over the brink.

Clinging closely to the face of the cliff, she turned her head to announce to Caleb that she
could not go on, and, in turning, looked down. Before this she had felt no fear, only perplexity;
but the sight of those cruel rocks below,--the hollow booming of the waves, as they lashed
the foot of the cliff,--the consciousness that a fall of a hundred feet awaited her, should
she let go her hold,--all this struck terror to Mysie's heart; and while a heavy, confused
noise came throbbing and ringing through her head, she shut her eyes, and fancied she had seen
her last of earth.

In an instant Caleb was beside her,--his arm about her, holding her safely where she was; but
to continue was impossible for either.

"Ho! Mr. F.!" shouted Caleb; "come this way, will you, and give my wife your hand? She is a
little frightened, and can't go on."

Presently a stout arm and hand appeared from among that nodding, mocking grass, and a cheery
voice exclaimed,--

"Here, my dear lady, take right hold, strong;--you can't pull me over,--not if you try to."

Unclasping, with some difficulty, her fingers from the rock, into which they seemed to have
grown, Mysie grasped the proffered hand, and the next moment was safe upon the turf.

"Oh, my good gracious!" muttered the kind old man; but whether the exclamation was caused by
Mysie's face, pale, no doubt, by the effort necessary to raise her half-fainting figure, or
by the idea of the peril in which she had been, did not appear.

Clarissa, calm and equable, was next passed up by Caleb, who, declining the proffered hand,
drew himself up, by a firm grasp upon the rocky scarp of the cliff.

"Guess you was scart some then, wa'n't you?" inquired Clarissa, as the party walked homeward.

"Oh, no!" replied Mysie, quickly. "But I could not get over the top of the cliff alone,--it
was so steep."

"Oh, that was the matter?" drawled the child, with a sidelong glance of her sharp black eyes.

The northeast wind which went fossilizing with Mysie and Clara on their first excursion was
the precursor of a furious storm of rain and wind, ranking, according to the dictum of experienced
weatherseers, as little inferior to that famous one in which fell the Minot's Ledge Light-house.

As the gale reached its height, it was a sight at once terrible and beautiful, to watch, standing
in the lantern, the goaded sea, whose foam-capped waves could plainly be seen at the horizon
line, breaking here and there upon sunken rocks, over which in their playful moods they scarcely
rippled, but on which they now dashed with such white fury as to make them discernible, even
through the darkness of night. One long, low ridge of submarine rocks, around which seethed
a perpetual caldron, was called the Devil's Bridge; but when erected, or for what purpose,
tradition failed to state.

Never, surely, did the wind rave about a peaceful inland dwelling as it did about that lonely
light-house for two long nights. It roared, it howled, it shrieked, it whistled; it drew back
to gather strength, and then rushed to the attack with such mad fury, that the strong, young
light-house, whose frame was all of iron and stone, shrunk trembling before it, and the children
in their beds screamed aloud for fear. But through all and beyond all, the calm, strong light
sent out its piercing, warning rays into the black night; and who can tell what sinner it may
that night have prevented from crossing the Devil's Bridge to the world which lies beyond?

There was but one wreck during the storm, so far as our travellers heard; and in this the lives
were saved. Two men, caught out in a fishing-smack, finding that their little vessel was foundering,
betook themselves to their small boat; but this filled more rapidly than they could bale it;
and they had just given themselves up for lost, when their signals of distress were observed
on board the light-ship stationed near Newport, which sent a life-boat to their assistance,
and rescued them just as their little boat went to pieces.

When Mysie heard this occurrence mentioned, as they were journeying homeward, it recalled to
her mind a little incident of the day succeeding the storm.

Walking with Clara upon the beach, they saw borne toward them, on the crest of a mighty wave,
a square beam of wood, bent at an obtuse angle, which Clara at once pronounced to be the knee
from some large boat, and, rushing dauntlessly into the water, the energetic little maid battled
with the wave for its unwieldy toy, and finally dragged it triumphantly out upon the beach,
and beyond the reach of the wave, only wishing that she had "a piece of chalk to make father's
mark upon it." Failing the chalk, she rushed off home for "father and one of the boys," who
soon bestowed the prize in a place of safety.

Mysie at first wondered considerably that persons should take so much trouble for a piece of
wood, but ceased to do so when she remembered that on the whole island could not probably be
found a tree of a foot in diameter, and that everything like board or joist at the light-house
must be brought by sea to Holmes's Hole, Edgartown, or Menemshee, and thence carted over that
road to Gay Head, becoming, by the time it reached "the Light," not a common necessary, but
an expensive luxury. She was not, therefore, surprised at being accompanied in her next walk
along the beach by quite a little party of wreckers, who, joyfully seizing every chip which
the waves tossed within their reach, accumulated at last a very respectable pile of drift-wood.

"It would be a good thing for you, if the schooner "Mary Ann" should go to pieces off here,"
remarked Mysie to Clara, who had become her constant attendant.

"Why?" inquired she, expectantly.

"On account of her cargo. When hailed by another ship, and asked his name, the captain replied,--

    'I'm Jonathan Homer, master and owner
        Of the schooner Mary Ann;
    She comes from Pank-a-tank, laden with oak plank,
        And bound to Surinam.'"

"Did he really say so?" asked Clara, sharply.

"I don't know," said Mysie, laughing; "but that's what I heard about it when I was a little girl."

While the storm continued too violent for out-of-door exercise, Mysie cultivated an acquaintance
with a remarkably pleasant and intelligent lady who fortunately was making a visit at the light-house.
She had been for many years a resident of the Vineyard, and had taken great interest in its
history, both past and present. From her Mysie derived much curious and interesting information.

It seems that the island was first discovered by a certain Thomas Mayhew, who, voyaging with
others to settle in the Plymouth Colony during its early days, was driven by stress of weather
into a safe and commodious bay, now Edgartown harbor, but then seen and used for the first
time by white men. The storm over, his companions prepared to resume their voyage; but Mayhew,
seeing the land fair and pleasant to look upon, decided to remain there, and landed with whoever
in the ship belonged to him.

He, of course, found the land in the hands of its original possessors, a small and peaceful
tribe of Indians, living quietly upon their own island, and having very little communication
with their neighbors. With them Thomas Mayhew bargained for what land he wanted, selecting
it in what is now the town of Chilmark, and paying for it, to the satisfaction of all parties,
with an old soldier's coat which happened to be among his possessions.

In process of time, one of his sons, named Experience, having been educated for the purpose
in England, returned to his father's home as a missionary to the kind and hospitable savages
among whom he dwelt. So prosperous were the labors of himself, and afterward of his son Zachariah,
that in a journal, kept by the latter, it is mentioned that there were then upon the island
twelve thousand "praying Indians."

Experience Mayhew is still spoken of as "the great Indian missionary," and the house in which
he lived was still standing a few years since upon the farm of Mr. Hancock in Chilmark.

The island is to this day full of Mayhews of every degree,--so far, at least, as distinctions
of rank have obtained among this isolated and primitive people.

When Massachusetts erected herself into a State, and included the Vineyard within her bounds,
it was divided into the townships of Edgartown, (or Oldtown,) Holmes's Hole, Tisbury, and Chilmark,
and the district of Gay Head, which last, with the island of Chip-a-quid-dick, off Edgartown,
and a small tract of land in Tisbury, named Christian-town, were made over in perpetuity to
the Indians who chose to remain. They have not the power of alienating any portion of this
territory, nor may any white man build or dwell there. If, however, one of the tribe marry
out of the community, the alien husband or wife may come to live with the native spouse so
long as the marriage continues; and the Indians have taken advantage of this permission to
intermarry with the negroes, until there is not one pure-blooded descendant of the original
stock remaining, and its physiognomy and complexion are in most cases undistinguishable in
the combination of the two races.

Gay Head contains eleven hundred acres, seven of which are the birthright of every Indian child;
but it is not generally divided by fences, the cattle of the whole tribe grazing together in
amicable companionship. Much of the value of the property lies in the cranberry-meadows, which
are large and productive, and in the beds of rich peat. A great deal of the soil, however,
is valuable for cultivation, although but little used, as the majority of the men follow the
example of their white co-islanders, and plough the sea instead of the land. They make excellent
seamen, and sometimes rise to the rank of officers, although few white sailors are sufficiently
liberal in their views to approve of being commanded by "a nigger," as they persist in calling
these half-breeds.

The wigwams, which, no doubt, were at first erected here, have given place to neat and substantial
frame buildings, as comfortable, apparently, as those in many New England villages. There is
also a nice-looking Baptist church, of which denomination almost every adult is a member. Near
this is a parsonage, occupied until lately by a white clergyman; but the spirit of Experience
Mayhew is not common in these days; and his successor, finding the parish lonely and uncongenial,
removed to a pleasanter one,--his pulpit being now filled by a preacher from among the Indians
themselves.

Mysie took occasion to call at one of these quasi wigwams, soon after her arrival, but could
discern only one aboriginal vestige in either inhabitants or customs. This existed in the shape
of a dish of succotash, (corn and beans boiled together,) which the good woman was preparing
for breakfast,--very possibly in ignorance that her ancestors had cooked and eaten and named
the compound ages before the white intruders ever saw their shore.

Mysie pursued her morning walk in a somewhat melancholy mood. It is a sad and dreary sight
to behold a nation in decay; saddest when the fall is from so slight an elevation as that on
which the savage stood. Greece and Rome, falling into old age, proudly boast, "Men cannot say
I did not have the crown"; each shows undying, unsurpassable achievements of her day of power
and strength,--each, if she live no longer in the sight of the world, is sure of dwelling forever
in its memory. But the aboriginal, when his simple routine of life is broken up by the intrusion
of a people more powerful, more wicked, and more wise than himself, is incapable of exchanging
his own purely physical ambitions and pursuits for the intellectual and cultivated life belonging
to the better class of his conquerors, while his wild and sensuous nature grasps eagerly at
the new forms of vice which follow in their train. Civilization to the savage destroys his
own existence, and gives him no better one,--destroys it irremediably and forever. The life
sufficient for himself and for the day is not that which stretches its hand into the future
and sets its mark on ages not yet born; it dies and is forgotten,--forgotten even by the descendants
of those who lived it.

Some of the Indian names still survive; and Mysie's indignation was roused, when a descendant
of the Mayhews, pointing out the hamlets of Menemshee and Nashaquitsa, (commonly called Quitsy,)
added, contemptuously,--

"But them's only nicknames given by the colored folks; it's all Chilmark by rights."

"I suppose they are the names used by the ancestors of these Indians, before a white man ever
saw the island,--are they not?" inquired she, somewhat dryly.

"Like enough, like enough," replied the other, carelessly, and not in the least appreciating
the rebuke.

From the lady before referred to Mysie received an answer to her oft-repeated question,--

"Is there any tradition how the island received its name?"

"Oh, yes," was the unexpected and welcome answer. "All the islands near here were granted by
the King of England to a gentleman whose name is forgotten; but he had four daughters, among
whom he divided his new possessions.

"This one, remarkable then, as now, in a degree, for its abundance of wild grapes, he gave
to Martha as her Vineyard.

"The group to the north, consisting of Pennikeese, Cuttyhunk, Nashawena, Naushon, Pasqui, and
Punkatasset, are called the Elizabeth Islands, from the daughter who inherited them.

"That little island to the southwest of us was Naomi's portion. It is now called Noman's Land,
and is remarkable only for the fine quality of the codfish caught and cured there.

"The strangest of all, however, was the name given to the island selected by Ann, which was
first called Nan-took-it, and is now known as Nantucket."

"Thank Heaven, that I at last know something about Martha!" ejaculated Mysie.

       *       *       *       *       *

At length, every corner filled with specimens, every face deeply imbrowned by sun and wind,
and the Baron with only the ghost of a pair of shoes to his feet, our travellers set their
faces homeward,--Caleb resolving to renew his acquaintance with the birds at some future period,
his imagination having been quite inflamed by the accounts of plover and grouse to be found
here in their season. The latter, however, are very strictly protected by law during most of
the season, on account of the rapidity with which they were disappearing. They are identical
with the prairie-fowl, so common at the West, and are said to be delicious eating.

Desirous to improve their minds and manners by as much travel as possible, the trio resolved
to leave the island by the way of Edgartown, the terminus of the steamboat route. Bidding adieu
to their kind and obliging host and hostess, the twelve children, and the pleasant new friend,
they set out, upon the most charming of all autumn days, for Edgartown, fully prepared to be
dazzled by its beauty and confounded by its magnificence.

"Edgartown is a much finer place than Holmes's Hole, I understand," remarked Caleb to their driver.

"Well, I dunno; it's some bigger," was the reply.

"But it is a better sort of place, I am told; people from Edgartown don't seem to think much
of Holmes's Hole."

"No, nor the Holmes's Hole folks don't think much of Oldtown; it's pretty much according to
who you talk to, which place is called the handsomest, I reckon."

"Athens or Rome, London or Paris, Oldtown or Holmes's Hole, Mysie," murmured Caleb, as their
driver stopped to reply to the driver of "a team," who was anxious to know when he was "a-goin'
to butcher agin."

Edgartown proved to be a pretty little seaside town, with some handsome wooden houses, a little
bank, and a very nice tavern, at which the travellers received very satisfactory entertainment.
The next day, reembarking upon the "Eagle's Wing," they soon reached New Bedford.

OCTOBER TO MAY.

    The day that brightens half the earth
        Is night to half. Ah, sweet!
    One's mourning is another's mirth;--
You wear your bright years like a crown,--
While mine, dead garlands, tangle down
        In chains about my feet.

    The breeze which wakes the folded flower
        Sweeps dead leaves from the tree;--
    So partial Time, as hour by hour
He tells the rapid years,--cheu!
Brings bloom and beauty still to you,
        But leaves his blight with me.

    The rain which calls the violet up
        Out of the moistened mould
    Shatters the wind-flower's fragile cup;--
For even Nature has her pets,
And, favoring the new, forgets
        To love and spare the old.

    The shower which makes the bud a rose
        Beats off the lilac-bloom.
    I am a lilac,--so life goes,--
A lilac that has outlived May;--
You are a blush-rose. Welladay!
        I pass, and give you room!

THE ELEUSINIA.

What did the Eleusinia mean? Perhaps, reader, you think the question of little interest. "The
Eleusinia! Why, Lobeck made that little matter clear long ago; and there was Porphyry, who
told us that the whole thing was only an illustration of the Platonic philosophy. St. Croix,
too,--he made the affair as clear as day!"

But the question is not so easily settled, my friend; and I insist upon it that you have an
interest in it. Were I to ask you the meaning of Freemasonry, you would think that of importance;
you could not utter the name without wonder; and it may be that there is even more wonder in
it than you suspect,--though you be an arch-mason yourself. But in sight of Eleusis, freemasonry
sinks into insignificance. For, of all races, the Grecian was the most mysterious; and, of
all Grecian mysteries, the Eleusinia were the mysteries par excellence. They must certainly
have meant something to Greece,--something more than can ever be adequately known to us. A
farce is soon over; but the Eleusinia reached from the mythic Eumolpus to Theodosius the Great,--nearly
two thousand years. Think you that all Athens, every fifth year, for more than sixty generations,
went to Eleusis to witness and take part in a sham?

But, reader, let us go to Eleusis, and see, for ourselves, this great festival. Suppose it
to be the 15th of September, B.C. 411, Anno Mundi 3593 (though we would not make oath to that).
It is a fine morning at Athens, and every one is astir, for it is the day of assembling together
at Eleusis. Then, for company, we shall have Plato, now eighteen years old, Sophocles, an old
man of eighty-four, Euripides, at sixty-nine, and Aristophanes, at forty-five. Socrates, who
has his peculiar notions about things, is not one of the initiated, but will go with us, if
we ask him. These are the élite of Athens. Then there are the Sophists and their young disciples,
and the vast crowd of the Athenian people. Some of the oldest among them may have seen and
heard the "Prometheus Vinctus"; certainly very many of them have seen "Antigone," and "Oedipus,"
and "Electra"; and all of them have heard the Rhapsodists. Great wonders have they seen and
heard, which, in their appeal to the heart, transcend all the wonders of this nineteenth century.
Not more fatal to the poor Indian was modern civilization, bringing swift ruin to his wigwam
and transforming his hunting-grounds into the sites of populous cities, than modern improvements
would have been to the Greek. Modern strategy! What a subject for Homer would the siege of
Troy have been, had it consisted of a series of pitched battles with rifles! Railways, steamboats,
and telegraphs, annihilating space and time, would also have annihilated the Argonautic expedition
and the wanderings of Ulysses. There would have been little fear, in a modern steamship, of
the Sirens' song; one whistle would have broken the charm. A modern steamship might have borne
Ulysses to Hades,--but it would never have brought him back, as his own ship did. And now do
you think a ride to Eleusis by railway to-day would strike this Athenian populace, to say nothing
of the philosophers and poets we have along with us?

But they are thinking of Eleusis, and not of the way to Eleusis; so that we may as well keep
our suggestion to ourselves,--also those pious admonitions which we were just about to administer
to our companions on heathenish superstitions. A strange fascination these Athenians have;
and before we are aware, our thoughts, too, are centred in Eleusis, whither are tending, not
Athens only, but vast multitudes from all Greece. Their movement is tumultuous; but it is a
tumult of natural enthusiasm, and not of Bacchic frenzy. If Athens be, as Milton calls her,
"the eye of Greece," surely Eleusis must be its heart!

There are nine days of the festival. This first is the day of the agurmos, ([Greek: agyrmos],)
or assembling together the flux of Grecian life into the secret chambers of its Eleusinian
heart. To-morrow is the day of purification; then, "To the sea, all ye that are initiated!"
([Greek: Alade, mystai!]) lest any come with the stain of impurity to the mysteries of God.
The third day is the day of sacrifices, that the heart also may be made pure, when are offered
barley from the fields of Eleusis and a mullet. All other sacrifices may be tasted; but this
is for Demeter alone, and not to be touched by mortal lips. On the fourth day, we join the
procession bearing the sacred basket of the goddess, filled with curious symbols, grains of
salt, carded wool, sesame, pomegranates, and poppies,--symbols of the gifts of our Great Mother
and of her mighty sorrow. On the night of the fifth, we are lost in the hurrying tumult of
the torch-light processions. Then there is the sixth day, the great day of all, when from Athens
the statue of Iacchus (Bacchus) is borne, crowned with myrtle, tumultuously through the sacred
gate, along the sacred way, halting by the sacred fig-tree, (all sacred, mark you, from Eleusinian
associations,) where the procession rests, and then moves on to the bridge over the Cephissus,
where again it rests, and where the expression of the wildest grief gives place to the trifling
farce,--even as Demeter, in the midst of her grief, smiled at the levity of Iambe in the palace
of Celeus. Through the "mystical entrance" we enter Eleusis. On the seventh day, games are
celebrated; and to the victor is given a measure of barley,--as it were a gift direct from
the hand of the goddess. The eighth is sacred to Aesculapius, the Divine Physician, who heals
all diseases; and in the evening is performed the initiatory ritual.

Let us enter the mystic temple and be initiated,--though it must be supposed that a year ago
we were initiated into the Lesser Mysteries at Agræ. ("Certamen enim,--et præludium certaminis;
et mysteria sunt quæ præcedunt mysteria.") We must have been mystæ (veiled) before we can become
epoptæ (seers); in plain English, we must have shut our eyes to all else before we can behold
the mysteries. Crowned with myrtle, we enter with the other mystæ into the vestibule of the
temple,--blind as yet, but the Hierophant within will soon open our eyes.

But first,--for here we must do nothing rashly,--first we must wash in this holy water; for
it is with pure hands and a pure heart that we are bidden to enter the most sacred inclosure.
Then, led into the presence of the Hierophant, he reads to us, from a book of stone, things
which we must not divulge on pain of death. Let it suffice that they fit the place and the
occasion; and though you might laugh at them, if they were spoken outside, still you seem very
far from that mood now, as you hear the words of the old man (for old he always was) and look
upon the revealed symbols. And very far indeed are you from ridicule, when Demeter seals, by
her own peculiar utterances and signals, by vivid coruscations of light, and cloud piled upon
cloud, all that we have seen and heard from her sacred priest; and when, finally, the light
of a serene wonder fills the temple, and we see the pure fields of Elysium and hear the choirs
of the Blessed;--then, not merely by external seeming or philosophic interpretation, but in
real fact, does the Hierophant become the Creator and Revealer of all things; the Sun is but
his torch-bearer, the Moon his attendant at the altar, and Hermes his mystic herald. But the
final word has been uttered: "Conx Ompax." The rite is consummated, and we are epoptæ forever!

One day more, and the Eleusinia themselves are completed. As in the beginning by lustration
and sacrifices we conciliated the favor of the gods, so now by libation we finally commend
ourselves to their care. Thus did the Greeks begin all things with lustration and end with
libation, each day, each feast,--all their solemn treaties, their ceremonies, and sacred festivals.
But, like all else Eleusinian, this libation must be sui generis, emptied from two bowls,--the
one toward the East, the other toward the West. Thus is finished this Epos, or, as Clemens
Alexandrinus calls it, the "mystical drama" of the Eleusinia.

Now, reader, you have seen the Mysteries. And what do they mean? Let us take care lest we deceive
ourselves, as many before us have done, by merely looking at the Eleusinia.

Oh, this everlasting staring! This it is that leads us astray. That old stargazer, with whom
Aesop has made us acquainted, deserved, indeed, to fall into the well, no less for his profanity
than his stupidity. Yet this same star-gazing it is that we miscall reflection. Thus, in our
blank wonder at Nature, in our naked analysis of her life, expressed through long lists of
genera and species and mathematical calculations, as if we were calling off the roll of creation,
or as if her depth of meaning rested in her vast orbs and incalculable velocities,--in all
this we fail of her real mystery.

To mere external seeming, the Eleusinia point to Demeter for their interpretation. To her are
they consecrated,--of her grief are they commemorative; out of reverence to her do the mystæ
purify themselves by lustration and by the sacrifice that may not be tasted; she it is who
is symbolized, in the procession of the basket, as our Great Mother, through the salt, wool,
and sesame, which point to her bountiful gifts,--while by the poppies and pomegranates it is
hinted that she nourishes in her heart some profound sorrow: by the former, that she seeks
to bury this sorrow in eternal oblivion,--by the latter, that it must be eternally reiterated.
The procession of the torches defines the sorrow; and by this wild, despairing search in the
darkness do we know that her daughter Proserpine, plucking flowers in the fields of light,
has been snatched by ruthless Pluto to the realm of the Invisible. Then by the procession of
Iacchus we learn that divine aid has come to the despairing Demeter; by the coming of, Aesculapius
shall all her wounds be healed; and the change in the evening from the mystæ to epoptæ is because
that now to Demeter, the cycle of her grief being accomplished, the ways of Jove are made plain,--even
his permission of violence from unseen hands; to her also is the final libation.

But the story of the stolen Proserpina is itself an afterthought, a fable invented to explain
the Mysteries; and, however much it may have modified them in detail, certainly could not have
been their ground. Nor is the sorrowing Demeter herself adequate to the solution. For the Eleusinia
are older than Eleusis,--older than Demeter, even the Demeter of Thrace,--certainly as old
as Isis, who was to Egypt what Demeter was to Greece,--the Great Mother[2] of a thousand names,
who also had her endlessly repeated sorrow for the loss of Osiris, and in honor of whom the
Egyptians held an annual festival. Thus we only remove the mystery back to the very verge of
myth itself; and we must either give up the solution or take a different course. But perhaps
Isis will reveal herself, and at the same time unveil the Mysteries. Let us read her tablet:
"I am all that, has been, all that is, all that is to be; and the veil which is over my face
no mortal hand hath ever raised!" Now, reader, would it not be strange, if, in solving her
mystery, we should also solve the Sphinx's riddle? But so it is. This is the Sphinx in her
eldest shape,--this Isis of a thousand names; and the answer to her ever-recurring riddle is
always the same. In the Human Spirit is infolded whatsoever has been, is, or shall be; and
mortality cannot reveal it!

Not to Demeter, then, nor even to Isis, do the Eleusinia primarily point, but to the human
heart. We no longer look at them; henceforth they are within us. Long has this mystic mother,
the wonder of the world, waited for the revelation of her face. Let us draw aside the veil,
(not by mortal hand,--it moves at your will,) and listen:--

"I am the First and the Last,--mother of gods and men. As deep as is my mystery, so deep is
my sorrow. For, lo! all generations are mine. But the fairest fruit of my Holy Garden was plucked
by my mortal children; since which, Apollo among men and Artemis among women have raged with
their fearful arrows. My fairest children, whom I have brought forth and nourished in the light,
have been stolen by the children of darkness. By the Flood they were taken; and I wandered
forty days and forty nights upon the waters, ere again I saw the face of the earth. Then, wherever
I went, I brought joy; at Cyprus the grasses sprang up beneath my feet, the golden-filleted
Horæ crowned me with a wreath of gold and clothed me in immortal robes. Then, also, was renewed
my grief; for Adonis, whom I had chosen, was slain in the chase and carried to Hades. Six months
I wept his loss, when he rose again and I triumphed. Thus in Egypt I mourned for Osiris, for
Atys in Phrygia, and for Proserpina at Eleusis,--all of whom passed to the underworld, were
restored for a season, and then retaken. Thus is my sorrow repeated without end. All things
are taken from me. Night treads upon the heels of Day, the desolation of Winter wastes the
fair fruit of Summer, and Death walks in the ways of Life with inexorable claims. But at the
last, through Him, my First-begotten and my Best-beloved, who also died and descended into
Hades, and the third day rose again,--through Him, having ceased from wandering, I shall triumph
in Infinite Joy!"

That, reader, is not so difficult to translate into human language. Thus, from the beginning
to the end of the world, do these Mysteries, under various names, shadow forth the great problem
of human life, which problem, as being fundamental, must be religious, the same that is shadowed
forth in Nature and Revelation, namely: man's sin, and his redemption from sin,--his great
loss, his infinite error, and his final salvation.

Sorrow, so strong a sense of which pervaded these Mysteries that it was the name (Achtheia)
by which Demeter was known to her mystic worshippers,--human sorrow it was which veiled the
eyelids; toward which veiling (or muesis) the lotus about the head of Isis and the poppy in
the hand of Demeter distinctly point. Hence the mystæ, whom the reader must suppose to have
closed their eyes to all without them,--even to Nature, except as in sympathy she mirrors forth
the central sorrow of their hearts. But this same sorrow and its mighty work, veiled from all
mortal vision, shut out by very necessity from any sympathy save that of God, is a preparation
for a purer vision,--a second initiation, in which the eyes shall be reopened and the mystæ
become epoptæ; and of such significance was this higher vision to the Greek, that it was a
synonyme for the highest earthly happiness and a foretaste of Elysium.

As this vision of the epoptæ was the vision of real faith, so the muesis, or veiling of the
mystæ, was no mere affectation of mysticism. Not so easily could be set aside this weight of
sorrow upon the eyelids, which, notwithstanding that, leading to self, it leads to wandering,
leads also through Divine aid to that peace which passeth all understanding. Thus were the
Hebrews led out of Egyptian bondage through wanderings in the Wilderness to the Promised Land.
Even thus, through rites and ceremonies which to us are hieroglyphics hard to be deciphered,
which are known only as shrouded in infinite sorrow,--as dimly shadowing forth some wild search
in darkness and some final resurrection into light,--through these, many from Egypt and India
and Scythia, from Scandinavia and from the aboriginal forests of America, have for unnumbered
ages passed from a world of bewildering error to the heaven of their hopes. To the eye of sense
and to shallow infidelity, this may seem absurd; but the foolishness of man is the wisdom of
God to the salvation of His erring children. Happy, indeed, are the initiated! Blessed are
the poor in spirit, the Pariah, and the slave,--all they whose eyes are veiled with overshadowing
sorrow! for only thus is revealed the glory of human life!

There are many things, kind reader, which, in our senseless staring, we may call the signs
of human weakness, but which, by a higher interpretation, become revelations of human power.
The gross and pitiable features of the world are dissolved and clarified, when by an impassioned
sympathy we can penetrate to the heart of things. We are about to pity the ragged vesture,
the feeble knees, and the beseeching hand of poverty, and the cries of the oppressed and the
weary; but, at a thought, Pity is slain by Reverence. We are ready to cry out against the sluggish
movement of the world and its lazy flux of life; but before the satire is spoken, we are fascinated
by an undercurrent of this same world, earnest and full toward its sure goal,--of which, indeed,
we only dream; but "the dream is from God,"[3] and surer than sight. There is a profounder
calm than appears to the eye, in the quiet cottages scattered up and down among the peaceful
valleys; the rest of death is more untroubled than the marble face which it leaves as its visible
symbol; and sleep, "the minor mystery of death," ([Greek: hypnos ta mikra tou thanutou mystêria][4])
has a deeper significance than is revealed in any external token. So what is sneeringly called
the credulity of human nature is its holy faith, and, in spite of all the hard facts which
you may charge upon it, is the glory of man. It introduces us into that region where "nothing
is unexpected, nothing impossible."[5] It was the glory of our childhood, and by it childhood
is made immortal. Myth herself is ever a child,--a genuine child of the earth, indeed,--but
received among men as the child of Heaven.

Upon the slightest material basis have been constructed myths and miracles and fairy-tales
without number; and so it must ever be. Thus man asserts his own inherent strength of imagination
and faith over against the external fact. Whatsoever is facile to Imagination is also facile
to Faith. Easy, therefore, in our thoughts, is the transition from the Cinder-wench in the
ashes to the Cinderella of the palace; easy the apotheosis of the slave, and the passage from
the weary earth to the fields of Elysium and the Isles of the Blessed.

This flight of the Imagination, this vision of Faith,--these, reader, are only for the epoptæ.
It matters not, that, by naked analysis, you can prove that the palaces of our fancy and the
temples of our faith are but the baseless fabric of a dream. It may be that the greater part
of life is made up of dreams, and that wakefulness is merely incidental as a relief to the
picture. It may be, indeed, in the last analysis, that the ideal is the highest, if not the
only real.

For the sensible, palpable fact can, by the nature of things, exist for us only in the Present.
But, my dear reader, it is just here, in this Present, that the tenure by which we have hold
upon life is the most frail and shadowy. For, by the strictest analysis, there is no Present.
The formula, It is, even before we can give it utterance, by some subtile chemistry of logic,
is resolved into It was and It shall be. Thus by our analysis do we retreat into the ideal.
In the deepest reflection, all that we call external is only the material basis upon which
our dreams are built; and the sleep that surrounds life swallows up life,--all but a dim wreck
of matter, floating this way and that, and forever evanishing from sight. Complete the analysis,
and we lose even the shadow of the external Present, and only the Past and the Future are left
us as our sure inheritance. This is the first initiation,--the veiling of the eyes to the external.
But, as epoptæ, by the synthesis of this Past and Future in a living nature, we obtain a higher,
an ideal Present, comprehending within itself all that can be real for us within us or without.
This is the second initiation, in which is unveiled to us the Present as a new birth from our
own life.

Thus the great problem of Idealism is symbolically solved in the Eleusinia. For us there is
nothing real except as we realize it. Let it be that myriads have walked upon the earth before
us,--that each race and generation has wrought its change and left its monumental record upon
pillar and pyramid and obelisk; set aside the ruin which Time has wrought both upon the change
and the record, levelling the cities and temples of men, diminishing the shadows of the Pyramids,
and rendering more shadowy the names and memories of heroes,--obliterating even its own ruin;--set
aside this oblivion of Time, still there would be hieroglyphics,--still to us all that comes
from this abyss of Time behind us, or from the abyss of Space around us, must be but dim and
evanescent imagery and empty reverberation of sound, except as, becoming a part of our own
life, by a new birth, it receives shape and significance. Nothing can be unveiled to us till
it is born of us. Thus the epoptæ are both creators and interpreters. Strength of knowledge
and strength of purpose, lying at the foundation of our own nature, become also the measure
of our interpretation of all Nature. Therefore in each successive cycle of human history, as
we realize more completely the great Ideal, our appreciation of the Past increases, and our
hope of the Future. The difference lies not in the data of history, but in what we make of
the data.

We cannot see too clearly that the great problem of life, in Philosophy, Art, or Religion,
is essentially the same from the beginning. Like Nature, indeed, it repeats itself under various
external phases, in different ages and under different skies. History whispers from her antediluvian
lips of a race of giants; so does the earth reveal mammoths and stupendous forests. But the
wonder neither of Man nor of Nature was greater then than now. We say much, too, of Progress.
But the progress does not consist in a change of the fundamental problem of the race; we have
only learned to use our material so that we effect our changes more readily, and write our
record with a finer touch and in clearer outline. The progress is in the facility and elaboration,
and may be measured in Space and Time; but the Ideal is ever the same and immeasurable. Homer
is hard to read; but when once you have read him you have read all poetry. Or suppose that
Orpheus, instead of striving with his mythic brother Cheiron, were to engage in a musical contest
with Mozart, and you, reader? were to adjudge the prize. Undoubtedly you would give the palm
to Mozart. Not that Mozart is the better musician; the difficulty is all in your ear, my friend.
If you could only hear the nice vibrations of the "golden shell," you might reverse your decision.

So in Religion; the central idea, if you can only discern it, is ever the same. She no longer,
indeed, looks with the bewildered gaze of her childhood to the mountains and rivers, to the
sun, moon, and stars, for aid. In the fulness of time the veil is rent in twain, and she looks
beyond with a clearer eye to the surer signs that are visible of her unspeakable glory. But
the longing of her heart is ever the same.

What remains to us of ancient systems of faith is, for the most part, mere name and shadow.
It is even more difficult for us to realize to ourselves a single ceremony of Grecian worship,--for
instance, a dance in honor of Apollo,--in its subtile meaning, than it would be to appreciate
the "Prometheus" of Æschylus. This ignorance leads oftentimes to the most shocking profanation;
and from mere lack of vision we ridicule much that should call forth our reverence.

Thus many Christian writers have sought to throw ridicule upon the Eleusinia. But we must remember,
that, to Greece, throughout her whole history, they presented a well-defined system of faith,--that,
essentially, they even served the function of a church by their inherent idea of divine discipline
and purification and the hope which they ever held out of future resurrection and glory. Why,
then, you ask, if they were so pure and full of meaning, why was not such a man as Socrates
one of the Initiated? The reason, reader, was simply this: What the Eleusinia furnished to
Greece, that Socrates furnished to himself. That man who could stand stock-still a whole day,
lost in silent contemplation, what was the need to him of the Eleusinian veil? The most self-sufficient
man in all Greece, who could find the way directly to himself and to the mystery and responsibility
of his own will without the medium of external rites, to whom there were the ever-present intimations
of his strange Divinity,--what need to him of the Eleusinian revealings or their sublime self-intuition
([Greek: autopsia])? He had his own separate tragedy also. And when with his last words he
requested that a cock be sacrificed to Æsculapius, that, reader, was to indicate that to him
had come the eighth day of the drama, in which the Great Physician brings deliverance,--and
in the evening of which there should be the final unveiling of the eyes in the presence of
the Great Hierophant!

Such were the Eleusinia of Greece. But what do they mean to us? We have already hinted at their
connection with the Sphinx's riddle. It is through this connection that they receive their
most general significance; for this riddle is the riddle of the race, and the problem which
it involves can be adequately realized only in the life of the race. To Greece, as peculiarly
sensitive to all that is tragical, the Sphinx connected her questions most intimately with
human sorrow, either in the individual or the household.

"Who is it," thus the riddle ran, "who is it that in the morning creeps upon all-fours, touching
the earth in complete dependence,--and at noon, grown into the fulness of beauty and strength,
walks erect with his face toward heaven,--but at the going down of the sun, returns again to
his original frailty and dependence?"

This, answered Oedipus, is Man; and most fearfully did he realize it in his own life! In the
mysteries of the Eleusinia there is the same prominence of human sorrow,--only here the Sphinx
propounds her riddle in its religious phase; and in the change from the mystæ to the epoptæ,
in the revelation of the central self, was the great problem symbolically realized.

Greece had her reckoning; and to her eye the Sphinx long ago seemed to plunge herself headlong
into precipitate destruction. But this strange lady is ever reappearing with her awful alternative:
they who cannot solve her riddle must die. It is no trifling account, reader, which we have
with this lady. For now her riddle has grown to fearful proportions, connecting itself with
the rise and fall of empires, with the dim realm of superstition, with vast systems of philosophy
and faith. And the answer is always the same: "That which hath been is that which shall be;
and that which hath been is named already,--and it is known that it is Man."

What is it that shall explain the difference between our map of the world and that of Sesostris
or Anaximander? Geological deposits, the washing away of mountains, and the change of river-courses
are certainly but trifling in such an account. But an Argonautic expedition, a Trojan siege,
a Jewish exodus, Nomadic invasions, and the names of Hanno, Cæsar, William the Conqueror, and
Columbus, suggest an explanation. It is the flux of human life which must account for the flowing
outline of the earth's geography. As with the terrestrial, so with the celestial. The heavens
change by a subtiler movement than the precession of the equinoxes. In Job, "Behold the height
of the stars, how high they are!" but to Homer they bathe in the Western seas; while to us,
they are again removed to an incalculable distance,--but at the same time so near, that, in
our hopes, they are the many mansions of our Father's house, the stepping-stones to our everlasting
rest.

But there is also another map, reader, more shadowy in its outline, of an invisible region,
neither of the heavens nor of the earth,--but having vague relations to each, with a secret
history of its own, of which now and then strange tales and traditions are softly whispered
in our ear,--where each of us has been, though no two ever tell the same story of their wanderings.
Strange to say, each one calls all other tales superstitions and old-wives' fables; but observe,
he always trembles when he tells his own. But they are all true; there is not one old-wife's
fable on the list. Necromancers have had private interviews with visitors who had no right
to be seen this side the Styx. The Witch of Endor and the raising of Samuel were literal facts.
Above all others, the Nemesis and Eumenides were facts not to be withstood. And, philosophize
as we may, ghosts have been seen at dead of night, and not always under the conduct of Mercury;[6]
even the Salem witchcraft was very far from being a humbug. They are all true,--the gibbering
ghost, the riding hag, the enchantment of wizards, and all the miracles of magic, none of which
we have ever seen with the eye, but all of which we believe at heart. But who is it that weirdly
draws aside the dark curtain? Who is this mystic lady, ever weaving at her loom,--weaving long
ago, and weaving yet,--singing with unutterable sadness, as she interweaves with her web all
the sorrows and shadowy fears that ever were or that ever shall be? We know, indeed, that she
weaves the web of Fate and the curtain of the Invisible; for we have seen her work. We know,
too, that she alone can show the many-colored web or draw aside the dark curtain; for we have
seen her revelations. But who is she?

Ay, reader, the Sphinx puts close questions now and then; but there is only one answer that
can satisfy her or avert death. This person,--the only real mystery which can exist for you,--of
all things the most familiar, and at the same the most unfamiliar,--is yourself! You need not
speak in whispers. It is true, this lady has a golden quiver as well as a golden distaff; but
her arrows are all for those who cannot solve her riddle.

Protagoras, then, was right; and, looking back through these twenty-two centuries, we nod assent
to his grand proposition: "Man is the measure of all things,--of the possible, how it is,--of
the impossible, how it is not." In the individual life are laid the foundations of the universe,
and upon each individual artist depend the symmetry and meaning of the constructed whole. This
Master-Artist it is who holds the keys of life and death; and whatsoever he shall bind or loose
in his consciousness shall be bound or loosed throughout the universe. Apart from him, Nature
is resolved into an intangible, shapeless vanity of silence and darkness,--without a name,
and, in fact, no Nature at all. To man, all Nature must be human in some soul. God himself
is worshipped under a human phase; and it is here that Christianity, the flower of all Faith,
furnishes the highest answer and realization of this world-riddle of the Sphinx,--here that
it rests its eternal Truth, even as here it secures its unfailing appeal to the human heart!

The process by which any nature is realized is the process by which it is humanized. Thus are
all things given to us for an inheritance. Let it be, that, apart from us, the universe sinks
into insignificance and nothingness; to us it is a royal possession; and we are all kings,
with a dominion as unlimited as our desire. Ubi Cæsar, ibi Roma! Rome is the world; and each
man, if he will, is Cæsar.

If he will;--ay, there's the rub! In the strength of his will lie glory and absolute sway.
But if he fail, then becomes evident the frailty of his tenure,--"he is a king of shreds and
patches!"

Here is the crying treachery; and thus it happens that there are slaves and craven hearts.
This is the profound pathos of history, (for the Sphinx has always more or less of sadness
in her face,) which enters so inevitably into all human triumphs. The monuments of Egypt, the
palaces and tombs of her kings,--revelations of the strength of will,--also by inevitable suggestions
call to our remembrance successive generations of slaves and their endless toil. Morn after
morn, at sunrise, for thousands of years, did Memnon breathe forth his music, that his name
might be remembered upon the earth; but his music was the swell of a broken harp, and his name
was whispered in mournful silence! Among the embalmed dead, in urn-burials, in the midst of
catacombs, and among the graves upon our hillsides and in our valleys, there lurks the same
sad mockery. Surely "purple Death and the strong Fates do conquer us!" Strangely, in vast solitudes,
comes over us a sense of desolation, when even the faintest adumbrations of life seem lost
in the inertia of mortality. In all pomp lurks the pomp of funeral; and we do now and then
pay homage to the grim skeleton king who sways this dusty earth,--yea, who sways our hearts
of dust!

But it is only when we yield that we are conquered. "The daemon shall not choose us, but we
shall choose our daemon."[7] It is only when we lose hold of our royal inheritance that Time
is seen with his scythe and the heritage becomes a waste.

This is the failure, the central loss, over which Achtheia mourns. Happy are the epoptæ who
know this, who have looked the Sphinx in the face, and escaped death! They are the seers, they
the heroes!

But "Conx Ompax!"

And now, like good Grecians, let us make the double libation to our lady,--toward the East
and toward the West. That is an important point, reader; for thus is recognized the intimate
connection which our lady has with the movements of Nature, in which her life is mirrored,--
especially with the rising, the ongoing, and the waning of the day; and you remember that this
also was the relief of the Sphinx's riddle,--this same movement from the rising to the setting
sun. But prominently, as in all worship, are our eyes turned toward the East,--toward the resurrection.
In the tomb of Memnon, at Thebes, are wrought two series of paintings; in the one, through
successive stages, the sun is represented in his course from the East to the West,--and in
the other is represented, through various stages, his return to the Orient. It was to this
Orient that the old king looked, awaiting his regeneration.

Thus, reader, in all nations,--by no mere superstition, but by a glorious symbolism of Faith,--do
the children of the earth lay them down in their last sleep with their faces to the East.

[2] The worship of this Great Mother is not more wonderful for its antiquity in time than for
its prevalence as regards space. To the Hindu she was the Lady Isani. She was the Ceres of
Roman mythology, the Cybele of Phrygia and Lydia, and the Disa of the North. According to Tacitus,
(Germania, c. 9,) she was worshipped by the ancient Suevi. She was worshipped by the Muscovite,
and representations of her are found upon the sacred drums of the Laplanders. She swayed the
ancient world, from its southeast corner in India to Scandinavia in the northwest; and everywhere
she is the "Mater Dolorosa." And who is it, reader, that in the Christian world struggles for
life and power under the name of the Holy Virgin, and through the sad features of the Madonna?

[6] This function of Mercury, as Psycho-Pompos, or conductor of departed souls to Hades, is
often misunderstood. He was a Pompos not so much for the safety of the dead (though that was
an important consideration) as for the peace of the living. The Greeks had an overwhelming
fear of the dead, as is evident from the propitiatory rites to their shades; hence the necessity
of putting them under strict charge,--even against their will. (Horace, I. Ode xxiv. 15.) All
Mercury's qualifications point to this office, by which he defends the living against the invasions
of the dead. Hence his craft and agility;--for who so fleet and subtle as a ghost?

THE MINISTER'S WOOING.

[Continued.]

CHAPTER XXII.

Mary returned to the house with her basket of warm, fresh eggs, which she set down mournfully
upon the table. In her heart there was one conscious want and yearning, and that was to go
to the friends of him she had lost,--to go to his mother. The first impulse of bereavement
is to stretch out the hands towards what was nearest and dearest to the departed.

Her dove came fluttering down out of the tree, and settled on her hand, and began asking in
his dumb way to be noticed. Mary stroked his white feathers, and bent her head down over them
till they were wet with tears. "Oh, birdie, you live, but he is gone!" she said. Then suddenly
putting it gently from her, and going near and throwing her arms around her mother's neck,--"Mother,"
she said, "I want to go up to Cousin Ellen's." (This was the familiar name by which she always
called Mrs. Marvyn.) "Can't you go with me, mother?"

"My daughter, I have thought of it. I hurried about my baking this morning, and sent word to
Mr. Jenkyns that he needn't come to see about the chimney, because I expected to go as soon
as breakfast should be out of the way. So, hurry, now, boil some eggs, and get on the cold
beef and potatoes; for I see Solomon and Amaziah coming in with the milk. They'll want their
breakfast immediately."

The breakfast for the hired men was soon arranged on the table, and Mary sat down to preside
while her mother was going on with her baking,--introducing various loaves of white and brown
bread into the capacious oven by means of a long iron shovel, and discoursing at intervals
with Solomon, with regard to the different farming operations which he had in hand for the day.

Solomon was a tall, large-boned man, brawny and angular; with a face tanned by the sun, and
graven with those considerate lines which New England so early writes on the faces of her sons.
He was reputed an oracle in matters of agriculture and cattle, and, like oracles generally,
was prudently sparing of his responses. Amaziah was one of those uncouth over-grown boys of
eighteen whose physical bulk appears to have so suddenly developed that the soul has more matter
than she has learned to recognize, so that the hapless individual is always awkwardly conscious
of too much limb; and in Amaziah's case, this consciousness grew particularly distressing when
Mary was in the room. He liked to have her there, he said,--"but, somehow, she was so white
and pretty, she made him feel sort o' awful-like."

Of course, as such poor mortals always do, he must, on this particular morning, blunder into
precisely the wrong subject.

"S'pose you've heerd the news that Jeduthun Pettibone brought home in the 'Flying Scud,' 'bout
the wreck o' the 'Monsoon'; it's an awful providence, that 'ar' is,--a'n't it? Why, Jeduthun
says she jest crushed like an egg-shell";--and with that Amaziah illustrated the fact by crushing
an egg in his great brown hand.

Mary did not answer. She could not grow any paler than she was before; a dreadful curiosity
came over her, but her lips could frame no question. Amaziah went on:--

"Ye see, the cap'en he got killed with a spar when the blow fust come on, and Jim Marvyn he
commanded; and Jeduthun says that he seemed to have the spirit of ten men in him; he worked
and he watched, and he was everywhere at once, and he kep' 'em all up for three days, till
finally they lost their rudder, and went drivin' right onto the rocks. When, they come in sight,
he come up on deck, and says he, 'Well, my boys, we're headin' right into eternity,' says he,
'and our chances for this world a'n't worth mentionin', any on us; but we'll all have one try
for our lives. Boys, I've tried to do my duty by you and the ship,--but God's will be done!
All I have to ask now is, that, if any of you git to shore, you'll find my mother and tell
her I died thinkin' of her and father and my dear friends.' That was the last Jeduthun saw
of him; for in a few minutes more the ship struck, and then it was every man for himself. Laws!
Jeduthun says there couldn't nobody have stood beatin' agin them rocks, unless they was all
leather and inger-rubber like him. Why, he says the waves would take strong men and jest crush
'em against the rocks like smashin' a pie-plate!"

Here Mary's paleness became livid; she made a hasty motion to rise from the table, and Solomon
trod on the foot of the narrator.

"You seem to forget that friends and relations has feelin's," he said, as Mary hastily went
into her own room.

Amaziah, suddenly awakened to the fact that he had been trespassing, sat with mouth half open
and a stupefied look of perplexity on his face for a moment, and then, rising hastily, said,
"Well, Sol, I guess I'll go an' yoke up the steers."

At eight o'clock all the morning toils were over, the wide kitchen cool and still, and the
one-horse wagon standing at the door, into which climbed Mary, her mother, and the Doctor;
for, though invested with no spiritual authority, and charged with no ritual or form for hours
of affliction, the religion of New England always expects her minister as a first visitor in
every house of mourning.

The ride was a sorrowful and silent one. The Doctor, propped upon his cane, seemed to reflect
deeply.

"Have you been at all conversant with the exercises of our young friend's mind on the subject
of religion?" he asked.

Mrs. Scudder did not at first reply. The remembrance of James's last letter flashed over her
mind, and she felt the vibration of the frail child beside her, in whom every nerve was quivering.
After a moment, she said,--"It does not become us to judge the spiritual state of any one.
James's mind was in an unsettled way when he left; but who can say what wonders may have been
effected by divine grace since then?"

This conversation fell on the soul of Mary like the sound of clods falling on a coffin to the
ear of one buried alive;--she heard it with a dull, smothering sense of suffocation. That question
to be raised?--and about one, too, for whom she could have given her own soul? At this moment
she felt how idle is the mere hope or promise of personal salvation made to one who has passed
beyond the life of self, and struck deep the roots of his existence in others. She did not
utter a word;--how could she? A doubt,--the faintest shadow of a doubt,--in such a case, falls
on the soul with the weight of mountain certainty; and in that short ride she felt what an
infinite pain may be locked in one small, silent breast.

The wagon drew up to the house of mourning. Cato stood at the gate, and came forward, officiously,
to help them out. "Mass'r and Missis will be glad to see you," he said. "It's a drefful stroke
has come upon 'em."

Candace appeared at the door. There was a majesty of sorrow in her bearing, as she received
them. She said not a word, but pointed with her finger towards the inner room; but as Mary
lifted up her faded, weary face to hers, her whole soul seemed to heave towards her like a
billow, and she took her up in her arms and broke forth into sobbing, and, carrying her in,
as if she had been a child, set her down in the inner room and sat down beside her.

Mrs. Marvyn and her husband sat together, holding each other's hands, the open Bible between
them. For a few moments nothing was to be heard but sobs and unrestrained weeping, and then
all kneeled down to pray.

After they rose up, Mr. Zebedee Marvyn stood for a moment thoughtfully, and then said,--"If
it had pleased the Lord to give me a sure evidence of my son's salvation, I could have given
him up with all my heart; but now, whatever there may be, I have seen none." He stood in an
attitude of hopeless, heart-smitten dejection, which contrasted painfully with his usual upright
carriage and the firm lines of his face.

Mrs. Marvyn started as if a sword had pierced her, passed her arm round Mary's waist, with
a strong, nervous clasp, unlike her usual calm self, and said,--"Stay with me, daughter, to-day!--stay
with me!"

"Mary can stay as long as you wish, cousin," said Mrs. Scudder; "we have nothing to call her home."

"Come with me!" said Mrs. Marvyn to Mary, opening an adjoining door into her bedroom, and drawing
her in with a sort of suppressed vehemence,--"I want you!--I must have you!"

"Mrs. Marvyn's state alarms me," said her husband, looking apprehensively after her when the
door was closed; "she has not shed any tears, nor slept any, since she heard this news. You
know that her mind has been in a peculiar and unhappy state with regard to religious things
for many years. I was in hopes she might feel free to open her exercises of mind to the Doctor."

"Perhaps she will feel more freedom with Mary," said the Doctor. "There is no healing for such
troubles except in unconditional submission to Infinite Wisdom and Goodness. The Lord reigneth,
and will at last bring infinite good out of evil, whether our small portion of existence be
included or not."

After a few moments more of conference, Mrs. Scudder and the Doctor departed, leaving Mary
alone in the house of mourning.

CHAPTER XXIII.

We have said before, what we now repeat, that it is impossible to write a story of New England
life and manners for superficial thought or shallow feeling. They who would fully understand
the springs which moved the characters with whom we now associate must go down with us to the
very depths.

Never was there a community where the roots of common life shot down so deeply, and were so
intensely grappled around things sublime and eternal. The founders of it were a body of confessors
and martyrs, who turned their backs on the whole glory of the visible, to found in the wilderness
a republic of which the God of Heaven and Earth should be the sovereign power. For the first
hundred years grew this community, shut out by a fathomless ocean from the existing world,
and divided by an antagonism not less deep from all the reigning ideas of nominal Christendom.

In a community thus unworldly must have arisen a mode of thought, energetic, original, and
sublime. The leaders of thought and feeling were the ministry, and we boldly assert that the
spectacle of the early ministry of New England was one to which the world gives no parallel.
Living an intense, earnest, practical life, mostly tilling the earth with their own hands,
they yet carried on the most startling and original religious investigations with a simplicity
that might have been deemed audacious, were it not so reverential. All old issues relating
to government, religion, ritual, and forms of church organization having for them passed away,
they went straight to the heart of things, and boldly confronted the problem of universal being.
They had come out from the world as witnesses to the most solemn and sacred of human rights.
They had accustomed themselves boldly to challenge and dispute all sham pretensions and idolatries
of past ages,--to question the right of kings in the State, and of prelates in the Church;
and now they turned the same bold inquiries towards the Eternal Throne, and threw down their
glove in the lists as authorized defenders of every mystery in the Eternal Government. The
task they proposed to themselves was that of reconciling the most tremendous facts of sin and
evil, present and eternal, with those conceptions of Infinite Power and Benevolence which their
own strong and generous natures enabled them so vividly to realize. In the intervals of planting
and harvesting, they were busy with the toils of adjusting the laws of a universe. Solemnly
simple, they made long journeys in their old one-horse chaises, to settle with each other some
nice point of celestial jurisprudence, and to compare their maps of the Infinite. Their letters
to each other form a literature altogether unique. Hopkins sends to Edwards the younger his
scheme of the universe, in which he starts with the proposition, that God is infinitely above
all obligations of any kind to his creatures. Edwards replies with the brusque comment,--"This
is wrong; God has no more right to injure a creature than a creature has to injure God"; and
each probably about that time preached a sermon on his own views, which was discussed by every
farmer, in intervals of plough and hoe, by every woman and girl, at loom, spinning-wheel, or
wash-tub. New England was one vast sea, surging from depths to heights with thought and discussion
on the most insoluble of mysteries. And it is to be added, that no man or woman accepted any
theory or speculation simply as theory or speculation; all was profoundly real and vital,--a
foundation on which actual life was based with intensest earnestness.

The views of human existence which resulted from this course of training were gloomy enough
to oppress any heart which did not rise above them by triumphant faith or sink below them by
brutish insensibility; for they included every moral problem of natural or revealed religion,
divested of all those softening poetries and tender draperies which forms, ceremonies, and
rituals had thrown around them in other parts and ages of Christendom. The human race, without
exception, coming into existence "under God's wrath and curse," with a nature so fatally disordered,
that, although perfect free agents, men were infallibly certain to do nothing to Divine acceptance
until regenerated by the supernatural aid of God's Spirit,--this aid being given only to a
certain decreed number of the human race, the rest, with enough free agency to make them responsible,
but without this indispensable assistance exposed to the malignant assaults of evil spirits
versed in every art of temptation, were sure to fall hopelessly into perdition. The standard
of what constituted a true regeneration, as presented in such treatises as Edwards on the Affections,
and others of the times, made this change to be something so high, disinterested, and superhuman,
so removed from all natural and common habits and feelings, that the most earnest and devoted,
whose whole life had been a constant travail of endeavor, a tissue of almost unearthly disinterestedness,
often lived and died with only a glimmering hope of its attainment.

According to any views then entertained of the evidences of a true regeneration, the number
of the whole human race who could be supposed as yet to have received this grace was so small,
that, as to any numerical valuation, it must have been expressed as an infinitesimal. Dr. Hopkins
in many places distinctly recognizes the fact, that the greater part of the human race, up
to his time, had been eternally lost,--and boldly assumes the ground, that this amount of sin
and suffering, being the best and most necessary means of the greatest final amount of happiness,
was not merely permitted, but distinctly chosen, decreed, and provided for, as essential in
the schemes of Infinite Benevolence. He held that this decree not only permitted each individual
act of sin, but also took measures to make it certain, though, by an exercise of infinite skill,
it accomplished this result without violating human free agency.

The preaching of those times was animated by an unflinching consistency which never shrank
from carrying an idea to its remotest logical verge. The sufferings of the lost were not kept
from view, but proclaimed with a terrible power. Dr. Hopkins boldly asserts, that "all the
use which God will have for them is to suffer; this is all the end they can answer; therefore
all their faculties, and their whole capacities, will be employed and used for this end....
The body can by omnipotence be made capable of suffering the greatest imaginable pain, without
producing dissolution, or abating the least degree of life or sensibility.... One way in which
God will show his power in the punishment of the wicked will be in strengthening and upholding
their bodies and souls in torments which otherwise would be intolerable."

The sermons preached by President Edwards on this subject are so terrific in their refined
poetry of torture, that very few persons of quick sensibility could read them through without
agony; and it is related, that, when, in those calm and tender tones which never rose to passionate
enunciation, he read these discourses, the house was often filled with shrieks and waitings,
and that a brother minister once laid hold of his skirts, exclaiming, in an involuntary agony,
"Oh! Mr. Edwards! Mr. Edwards! is God not a God of mercy?"

Not that these men were indifferent or insensible to the dread words they spoke; their whole
lives and deportment bore thrilling witness to their sincerity. Edwards set apart special days
of fasting, in view of the dreadful doom of the lost, in which he was wont to walk the floor,
weeping and wringing his hands. Hopkins fasted every Saturday. David Brainerd gave up every
refinement of civilized life to weep and pray at the feet of hardened savages, if by any means
he might save one. All, by lives of eminent purity and earnestness, gave awful weight and sanction
to their words.

If we add to this statement the fact, that it was always proposed to every inquiring soul,
as an evidence of regeneration, that it should truly and heartily accept all the ways of God
thus declared right and lovely, and from the heart submit to Him as the only just and good,
it will be seen what materials of tremendous internal conflict and agitation were all the while
working in every bosom. Almost all the histories of religious experience of those times relate
paroxysms of opposition to God and fierce rebellion, expressed in language which appalls the
very soul,--followed, at length, by mysterious elevations of faith and reactions of confiding
love, the result of Divine interposition, which carried the soul far above the region of the
intellect, into that of direct spiritual intuition.

President Edwards records that he was once in this state of enmity,--that the facts of the
Divine administration seemed horrible to him,--and that this opposition was overcome by no
course of reasoning, but by an "inward and sweet sense," which came to him once when walking
alone in the fields, and, looking up into the blue sky, he saw the blending of the Divine majesty
with a calm, sweet, and almost infinite meekness.

The piety which grew up under such a system was, of necessity, energetic,--it was the uprousing
of the whole energy of the human soul, pierced and wrenched and probed from her lowest depths
to her topmost heights with every awful life-force possible to existence. He whose faith in
God came clear through these terrible tests would be sure never to know greater ones. He might
certainly challenge earth or heaven, things present or things to come, to swerve him from this
grand allegiance.

But it is to be conceded, that these systems, so admirable in relation to the energy, earnestness,
and acuteness of their authors, when received as absolute truth, and as a basis of actual life,
had, on minds of a certain class, the effect of a slow poison, producing life-habits of morbid
action very different from any which ever followed the simple reading of the Bible. They differ
from the New Testament as the living embrace of a friend does from his lifeless body, mapped
out under the knife of the anatomical demonstrator;--every nerve and muscle is there, but to
a sensitive spirit there is the very chill of death in the analysis.

All systems that deal with the infinite are, besides, exposed to danger from small, unsuspected
admixtures of human error, which become deadly when carried to such vast results. The smallest
speck of earth's dust, in the focus of an infinite lens, appears magnified among the heavenly
orbs as a frightful monster.

Thus it happened, that, while strong spirits walked, palm-crowned, with victorious hymns, along
these sublime paths, feebler and more sensitive ones lay along the track, bleeding away in
life-long despair. Fearful to them were the shadows that lay over the cradle and the grave.
The mother clasped her babe to her bosom, and looked with shuddering to the awful coming trial
of free agency, with its terrible responsibilities and risks, and, as she thought of the infinite
chances against her beloved, almost wished it might die in infancy. But when the stroke of
death came, and some young, thoughtless head was laid suddenly low, who can say what silent
anguish of loving hearts sounded the dread depths of eternity with the awful question, Where?

In no other time or place of Christendom have so fearful issues been presented to the mind.
Some church interposed its protecting shield; the Christian born and baptized child was supposed
in some wise rescued from the curse of the fall, and related to the great redemption,--to be
a member of Christ's family, and, if ever so sinful, still infolded in some vague sphere of
hope and protection. Augustine solaced the dread anxieties of trembling love by prayers offered
for the dead, in times when the Church above and on earth presented itself to the eye of the
mourner as a great assembly with one accord lifting interceding hands for the parted soul.

But the clear logic and intense individualism of New England deepened the problems of the Augustinian
faith, while they swept away all those softening provisions so earnestly clasped to the throbbing
heart of that great poet of theology. No rite, no form, no paternal relation, no faith or prayer
of church, earthly or heavenly, interposed the slightest shield between the trembling spirit
and Eternal Justice. The individual entered eternity alone, as if he had no interceding relation
in the universe.

This, then, was the awful dread which was constantly underlying life. This it was which caused
the tolling bell in green hollows and lonely dells to be a sound which shook the soul and searched
the heart with fearful questions. And this it was that was lying with mountain weight on the
soul of the mother, too keenly agonized to feel that doubt in such a case was any less a torture
than the most dreadful certainty.

Hers was a nature more reasoning than creative and poetic; and whatever she believed bound
her mind in strictest chains to its logical results. She delighted in the regions of mathematical
knowledge, and walked them as a native home; but the commerce with abstract certainties fitted
her mind still more to be stiffened and enchained by glacial reasonings, in regions where spiritual
intuitions are as necessary as wings to birds.

Mary was by nature of the class who never reason abstractly, whose intellections all begin
in the heart, which sends them colored with its warm life-tint to the brain. Her perceptions
of the same subjects were as different from Mrs. Marvyn's as his who revels only in color from
his who is busy with the dry details of mere outline. The one mind was arranged like a map,
and the other like a picture. In all the system which had been explained to her, her mind selected
points on which it seized with intense sympathy, which it dwelt upon and expanded till all
else fell away. The sublimity of disinterested benevolence,--the harmony and order of a system
tending in its final results to infinite happiness,--the goodness of God,--the love of a self-sacrificing
Redeemer,--were all so many glorious pictures, which she revolved in her mind with small care
for their logical relations.

Mrs. Marvyn had never, in all the course of their intimacy, opened her mouth to Mary on the
subject of religion. It was not an uncommon incident of those times for persons of great elevation
and purity of character to be familiarly known and spoken of as living under a cloud of religious
gloom; and it was simply regarded as one more mysterious instance of the workings of that infinite
decree which denied to them the special illumination of the Spirit.

When Mrs. Marvyn had drawn Mary with her into her room, she seemed like a person almost in
frenzy. She shut and bolted the door, drew her to the foot of the bed, and, throwing her arms
round her, rested her hot and throbbing forehead on her shoulder. She pressed her thin hand
over her eyes, and then, suddenly drawing back, looked her in the face as one resolved to speak
something long suppressed. Her soft brown eyes had a flash of despairing wildness in them,
like that of a hunted animal turning in its death-struggle on its pursuer.

"Mary," she said, "I can't help it,--don't mind what I say, but I must speak or die! Mary,
I cannot, will not, be resigned!--it is all hard, unjust, cruel!--to all eternity I will say
so! To me there is no goodness, no justice, no mercy in anything! Life seems to me the most
tremendous doom that can be inflicted on a helpless being! What had we done, that it should
be sent upon us? Why were we made to love so, to hope so,--our hearts so full of feeling, and
all the laws of Nature marching over us,--never stopping for our agony? Why, we can suffer
so in this life that we had better never have been born!

"But, Mary, think what a moment life is! think of those awful ages of eternity! and then think
of all God's power and knowledge used on the lost to make them suffer! think that all but the
merest fragment of mankind have gone into this,--are in it now! The number of the elect is
so small we can scarce count them for anything! Think what noble minds, what warm, generous
hearts, what splendid natures are wrecked and thrown away by thousands and tens of thousands!
How we love each other! how our hearts weave into each other! how more than glad we should
be to die for each other! And all this ends--O God, how must it end?--Mary! it isn't my sorrow
only! What right have I to mourn? Is my son any better than any other mother's son? Thousands
of thousands, whose mothers loved them as I love mine, are gone there!--Oh, my wedding-day!
Why did they rejoice? Brides should wear mourning,--the bells should toll for every wedding;
every new family is built over this awful pit of despair, and only one in a thousand escapes!"

Pale, aghast, horror-stricken, Mary stood dumb, as one who in the dark and storm sees by the
sudden glare of lightning a chasm yawning under foot. It was amazement and dimness of anguish;--the
dreadful words struck on the very centre where her soul rested. She felt as if the point of
a wedge were being driven between her life and her life's life,--between her and her God. She
clasped her hands instinctively on her bosom, as if to hold there some cherished image, and
said in a piercing voice of supplication, "My God! my God! oh, where art Thou?"

Mrs. Marvyn walked up and down the room with a vivid spot of red in each cheek and a baleful
fire in her eyes, talking in rapid soliloquy, scarcely regarding her listener, absorbed in
her own enkindled thoughts.

"Dr. Hopkins says that this is all best,--better than it would have been in any other possible
way,--that God chose it because it was for a greater final good,--that He not only chose it,
but took means to make it certain,--that He ordains every sin, and does all that is necessary
to make it certain,--that He creates the vessels of wrath and fits them for destruction, and
that He has an infinite knowledge by which He can do it without violating their free agency.--So
much the worse! What a use of infinite knowledge What if men should do so? What if a father
should take means to make it certain that his poor little child should be an abandoned wretch,
without violating his free agency? So much the worse, I say!--They say He does this so that
He may show to all eternity, by their example, the evil nature of sin and its consequences!
This is all that the greater part of the human race have been used for yet; and it is all right,
because an overplus of infinite happiness is yet to be wrought out by it!--It is not right!
No possible amount of good to ever so many can make it right to deprave ever so few;--happiness
and misery cannot be measured so! I never can think it right,--never!--Yet they say our salvation
depends on our loving God,--loving Him better than ourselves,--loving Him better than our dearest
friends.--It is impossible!--it is contrary to the laws of my nature! I can never love God!
I can never praise Him!--I am lost! lost! lost! And what is worse, I cannot redeem my friends!
Oh, I could suffer forever,--how willingly!--if I could save him!--But oh, eternity, eternity!
Frightful, unspeakable woe! No end!--no bottom!--no shore!--no hope!--O God! O God!"

Mrs. Marvyn's eyes grew wilder,--she walked the door, wringing her hands,--and her words, mingled
with shrieks and moans, became whirling and confused, as when in autumn a storm drives the
leaves in dizzy mazes.

Mary was alarmed,--the ecstasy of despair was just verging on insanity. She rushed out and
called Mr. Marvyn.

"Oh! come in! do! quick!--I'm afraid her mind is going!" she said.

"It is what I feared," he said, rising from where he sat reading his great Bible, with an air
of heartbroken dejection. "Since she heard this news, she has not slept nor shed a tear. The
Lord hath covered us with a cloud in the day of his fierce anger."

He came into the room, and tried to take his wife into his arms. She pushed him violently back,
her eyes glistening with a fierce light. "Leave me alone!" she said,--"I am a lost spirit!"

These words were uttered in a shriek that went through Mary's heart like an arrow.

At this moment, Candace, who had been anxiously listening at the door for an hour past, suddenly
burst into the room.

"Lor' bress ye, Squire Marvyn, we won't hab her goin' on dis yer way," she said. "Do talk gospel
to her, can't ye?--ef you can't, I will."

"Come, ye poor little lamb," she said, walking straight up to Mrs. Marvyn, "come to ole Candace!"--and
with that she gathered the pale form to her bosom, and sat down and began rocking her, as if
she had been a babe. "Honey, darlin', ye a'n't right,--dar's a drefful mistake somewhar," she
said. "Why, de Lord a'n't like what ye tink,--He loves ye, honey! Why, jes' feel how I loves
ye,--poor ole black Candace,--an' I a'n't better'n Him as made me! Who was it wore de crown
o' thorns, lamb?--who was it sweat great drops o' blood?--who was it said, 'Father, forgive
dem'? Say, honey!--wasn't it de Lord dat made ye?--Dar, dar, now ye'r' cryin'!--cry away, and
ease yer poor little heart! He died for Mass'r Jim,--loved him and died for him,--jes' give
up his sweet, precious body and soul for him on de cross! Laws, jes' leave him in Jesus' hands!
Why, honey, dar's de very print o' de nails in his hands now!"

The flood-gates were rent; and healing sobs and tears shook the frail form, as a faded lily
shakes under the soft rains of summer. All in the room wept together.

"Now, honey," said Candace, after a pause of some minutes, "I knows our Doctor's a mighty good
man, an' larned,--an' in fair weather I ha'n't no 'bjection to yer hearin' all about dese yer
great an' mighty tings he's got to say. But, honey, dey won't do for you now; sick folks mus'n't
hab strong meat; an' times like dese, dar jest a'n't but one ting to come to, an' dat ar's
Jesus. Jes' come right down to whar poor ole black Candace has to stay allers,--it's a good
place, darlin'! Look right at Jesus. Tell ye, honey, ye can't live no other way now. Don't
ye 'member how He looked on His mother, when she stood faintin' an' tremblin' under de cross,
jes' like you? He knows all about mothers' hearts; He won't break yours. It was jes' 'cause
He know'd we'd come into straits like dis yer, dat he went through all dese tings,--Him, de
Lord o' Glory! Is dis Him you was a-talkin' about?--Him you can't love? Look at Him, an' see
ef you can't. Look an' see what He is!--don't ask no questions, and don't go to no reasonin's,--jes'
look at Him, hangin' dar, so sweet and patient, on de cross! All dey could do couldn't stop
his lovin' 'em; he prayed for 'em wid all de breath he had. Dar's a God you can love, a'n't
dar? Candace loves Him,--poor, ole, foolish, black, wicked Candace,--and she knows He loves
her,"--and here Candace broke down into torrents of weeping.

They laid the mother, faint and weary, on her bed, and beneath the shadow of that suffering
cross came down a healing sleep on those weary eyelids.

"Honey," said Candace, mysteriously, after she had drawn Mary out of the room, "don't ye go
for to troublin' yer mind wid dis yer. I'm clar Mass'r James is one o' de 'lect; and I'm clar
dar's consid'able more o' de 'lect dan people tink. Why, Jesus didn't die for nothin',--all
dat love a'n't gwine to be wasted. De 'lect is more'n you or I knows, honey! Dar's de Spirit,--He'll
give it to 'em; and ef Mass'r James is called an' took, depend upon it de Lord has got him
ready,--course He has,--so don't ye go to layin' on yer poor heart what no mortal creetur can
live under; 'cause, as we's got to live in dis yer world, it's quite clar de Lord must ha'
fixed it so we can; and ef tings was as some folks suppose, why, we couldn't live, and dar
wouldn't be no sense in anyting dat goes on."

The sudden shock of these scenes was followed, in Mrs. Marvyn's case, by a low, lingering fever.
Her room was darkened, and she lay on her bed, a pale, suffering form, with scarcely the ability
to raise her hand. The shimmering twilight of the sick-room fell on white napkins, spread over
stands, where constantly appeared new vials, big and little, as the physician, made his daily
visit, and prescribed now this drug and now that, for a wound that had struck through the soul.

Mary remained many days at the white house, because, to the invalid, no step, no voice, no
hand was like hers. We see her there now, as she sits in the glimmering by the bed-curtains,--her
head a little drooped, as droops a snowdrop over a grave;--one ray of light from a round hole
in the closed shutters falls on her smooth-parted hair, her small hands are clasped on her
knees, her mouth has lines of sad compression, and in her eyes are infinite questionings.

CHAPTER XXIV.

When Mrs. Marvyn began to amend, Mary returned to the home cottage, and resumed the details
of her industrious and quiet life.

Between her and her two best friends had fallen a curtain of silence. The subject that filled
all her thoughts could not be named between them. The Doctor often looked at her pale cheeks
and drooping form with a face of honest sorrow, and heaved deep sighs as she passed; but he
did not find any power within himself by which he could approach her. When he would speak,
and she turned her sad, patient eyes so gently on him, the words went back again to his heart,
and there, taking a second thought, spread upward wing in prayer.

Mrs. Scudder sometimes came to her room after she was gone to bed, and found her weeping; and
when gently she urged her to sleep, she would wipe her eyes so patiently and turn her head
with such obedient sweetness, that her mother's heart utterly failed her. For hours Mary sat
in her room with James's last letter spread out before her. How anxiously had she studied every
word and phrase in it, weighing them to see if the hope of eternal life were in them! How she
dwelt on those last promises! Had he kept them? Ah! to die without one word more! Would no
angel tell her?--would not the loving God, who knew all, just whisper one word? He must have
read the little Bible! What had he thought? What did he feel in that awful hour when he felt
himself drifting on to that fearful eternity? Perhaps he had been regenerated,--perhaps there
had been a sudden change;--who knows?--she had read of such things;--perhaps--Ah, in that perhaps
lies a world of anguish! Love will not hear of it. Love dies for certainty. Against an uncertainty
who can brace the soul? We put all our forces of faith and prayer against it, and it goes down
just as a buoy sinks in the water, and the next moment it is up again. The soul fatigues itself
with efforts which come and go in waves; and when with laborious care she has adjusted all
things in the light of hope, back flows the tide, and sweeps all away. In such struggles life
spends itself fast; an inward wound does not carry one deathward more surely than this worst
wound of the soul. God has made us so mercifully that there is no certainty, however dreadful,
to which life-forces do not in time adjust themselves,--but to uncertainty there is no possible
adjustment. Where is he? Oh, question of questions!--question which we suppress, but which
a power of infinite force still urges on the soul, who feels a part of herself torn away.

Mary sat at her window in evening hours, and watched the slanting sunbeams through the green
blades of grass, and thought one year ago he stood there, with his well-knit, manly form, his
bright eye, his buoyant hope, his victorious mastery of life! And where was he now? Was his
heart as sick, longing for her, as hers for him? Was he looking back to earth and its joys
with pangs of unutterable regret? or had a divine power interpenetrated his soul, and lighted
there the flame of a celestial love which bore him far above earth? If he were among the lost,
in what age of eternity could she ever be blessed? Could Christ be happy, if those who were
one with Him were sinful and accursed? and could Christ's own loved ones be happy, when those
with whom they have exchanged being, in whom they live and feel, are as wandering stars, for
whom is reserved the mist of darkness forever? She had been taught that the agonies of the
lost would be forever in sight of the saints, without abating in the least their eternal joys;
nay, that they would find in it increasing motives to praise and adoration. Could it be so?
Would the last act of the great Bridegroom of the Church be to strike from the heart of his
purified Bride those yearnings of self-devoting love which His whole example had taught her,
and in which she reflected, as in a glass, His own nature? If not, is there not some provision
by which those roots of deathless love which Christ's betrothed ones strike into other hearts
shall have a divine, redeeming power? Question vital as life-blood to ten thousand hearts,--fathers,
mothers, wives, husbands,--to all who feel the infinite sacredness of love!

After the first interview with Mrs. Marvyn, the subject which had so agitated them was not
renewed. She had risen at last from her sick-bed, as thin and shadowy as a faded moon after
sunrise. Candace often shook her head mournfully, as her eyes followed her about her dally
tasks. Once only, with Mary, she alluded to the conversation which had passed between them;--it
was one day when they were together, spinning, in the north upper room that looked out upon
the sea. It was a glorious day. A ship was coming in under full sail, with white gleaming wings.
Mrs. Marvyn watched it a few moments,--the gay creature, so full of exultant life,--and then
smothered down an inward groan, and Mary thought she heard her saying, "Thy will be done!"

"Mary," she said, gently, "I hope you will forget all I said to you that dreadful day. It had
to be said, or I should have died. Mary, I begin to think that it is not best to stretch our
minds with reasonings where we are so limited, where we can know so little. I am quite sure
there must be dreadful mistakes somewhere.

"It seems to me irreverent and shocking that a child should oppose a father, or a creature
its Creator. I never should have done it, only that, where direct questions are presented to
the judgment, one cannot help judging. If one is required to praise a being as just and good,
one must judge of his actions by some standard of right,--and we have no standard but such
as our Creator has placed in us. I have been told it was my duty to attend to these subjects,
and I have tried to,--and the result has been that the facts presented seem wholly irreconcilable
with any notions of justice or mercy that I am able to form. If these be the facts, I can only
say that my nature is made entirely opposed to them. If I followed the standard of right they
present, and acted according to my small mortal powers on the same principles, I should be
a very bad person. Any father, who should make such use of power over his children as they
say the Deity does with regard to us, would be looked upon as a monster by our very imperfect
moral sense. Yet I cannot say that the facts are not so. When I heard the Doctor's sermons
on 'Sin a Necessary Means of the Greatest Good,' I could not extricate myself from the reasoning.

"I have thought, in desperate moments, of giving up the Bible itself. But what do I gain? Do
I not see the same difficulty in Nature? I see everywhere a Being whose main ends seem to be
beneficent, but whose good purposes are worked out at terrible expense of suffering, and apparently
by the total sacrifice of myriads of sensitive creatures. I see unflinching order, general
good-will, but no sympathy, no mercy. Storms, earthquakes, volcanoes, sickness, death, go on
without regarding us. Everywhere I see the most hopeless, unrelieved suffering,--and for aught
I see, it may be eternal. Immortality is a dreadful chance, and I would rather never have been.--The
Doctor's dreadful system is, I confess, much like the laws of Nature,--about what one might
reason out from them.

"There is but just one thing remaining, and that is, as Candace said, the cross of Christ.
If God so loved us,--if He died for us,--greater love hath no man than this. It seems to me
that love is shown here in the two highest forms possible to our comprehension. We see a Being
who gives himself for us,--and more than that, harder than that, a Being who consents to the
suffering of a dearer than self. Mary, I feel that I must love more, to give up one of my children
to suffer, than to consent to suffer myself. There is a world of comfort to me in the words,
'He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him
also freely give us all things?' These words speak to my heart. I can interpret them by my
own nature, and I rest on them. If there is a fathomless mystery of sin and sorrow, there is
a deeper mystery of God's love. So, Mary, I try Candace's way,--I look at Christ,--I pray to
Him. If he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father, it is enough. I rest there,--I wait. What
I know not now I shall know hereafter."

Mary kept all things and pondered them in her heart. She could speak to no one,--not to her
mother, nor to her spiritual guide; for had she not passed to a region beyond theirs? As well
might those on the hither side of mortality instruct the souls gone beyond the veil as souls
outside a great affliction guide those who are struggling in it. That is a mighty baptism,
and only Christ can go down with us into those waters.

Mrs. Scudder and the Doctor only marked that she was more than ever conscientious in every
duty, and that she brought to life's daily realities something of the calmness and disengagedness
of one whose soul has been wrenched by a mighty shock from all moorings here below. Hopes did
not excite, fears did not alarm her; life had no force strong enough to awaken a thrill within;
and the only subjects on which she ever spoke with any degree of ardor were religious subjects.

One who should have seen moving about the daily ministrations of the cottage a pale girl, whose
steps were firm, whose eye was calm, whose hands were ever busy, would scarce imagine that
through that silent heart were passing tides of thought that measured a universe; but it was
even so. Through that one gap of sorrow flowed in the whole awful mystery of existence, and
silently, as she spun and sewed, she thought over and over again all that she had ever been
taught, and compared and revolved it by the light of a dawning inward revelation.

Sorrow is the great birth-agony of immortal powers,--sorrow is the great searcher and revealer
of hearts, the great test of truth; for Plato has wisely said, sorrow will not endure sophisms,--all
shams and unrealities melt in the fire of that awful furnace. Sorrow reveals forces in ourselves
we never dreamed of. The soul, a bound and sleeping prisoner, hears her knock on her cell-door,
and wakens. Oh, how narrow the walls! oh, how close and dark the grated window! how the long
useless wings beat against the impassable barriers! Where are we? What is this prison? What
is beyond? Oh for more air, more light! When will the door be opened? The soul seems to itself
to widen and deepen; it trembles at its own dreadful forces; it gathers up in waves that break
with wailing only to flow back into the everlasting void. The calmest and most centred natures
are sometimes thrown by the shock of a great sorrow into a tumultuous amazement. All things
are changed. The earth no longer seems solid, the skies no longer secure; a deep abyss seems
underlying every joyous scene of life. The soul, struck with this awful inspiration, is a mournful
Cassandra; she sees blood on every threshold, and shudders in the midst of mirth and festival
with the weight of a terrible wisdom.

Who shall dare be glad any more, that has once seen the frail foundations on which love and
joy are built? Our brighter hours, have they only been weaving a network of agonizing remembrances
for this day of bereavement? The heart is pierced with every past joy, with every hope of its
ignorant prosperity. Behind every scale in music, the gayest and cheeriest, the grandest, the
most triumphant, lies its dark relative minor; the notes are the same, but the change of a
semitone changes all to gloom;--all our gayest hours are tunes that have a modulation into
these dreary keys ever possible; at any moment the key-note may be struck.

The firmest, best-prepared natures are often beside themselves with astonishment and dismay,
when they are called to this dread initiation. They thought it a very happy world before,--a
glorious universe. Now it is darkened with the shadow of insoluble mysteries. Why this everlasting
tramp of inevitable laws on quivering life? If the wheels must roll, why must the crushed be
so living and sensitive?

And yet sorrow is godlike, sorrow is grand and great, sorrow is wise and farseeing. Our own
instinctive valuations, the intense sympathy which we give to the tragedy which God has inwoven
into the laws of Nature, show us that it is with no slavish dread, no cowardly shrinking, that
we should approach her divine mysteries. What are the natures that cannot suffer? Who values
them? From the fat oyster, over which the silver tide rises and falls without one pulse upon
its fleshy ear, to the hero who stands with quivering nerve parting with wife and child and
home for country and God, all the way up is an ascending scale, marked by increasing power
to suffer; and when we look to the Head of all being, up through principalities and powers
and princedoms, with dazzling orders and celestial blazonry, to behold by what emblem the Infinite
Sovereign chooses to reveal himself, we behold, in the midst of the throne, "a lamb as it had
been slain."

Sorrow is divine. Sorrow is reigning on the throne of the universe, and the crown of all crowns
has been one of thorns. There have been many books that treat of the mystery of sorrow, but
only one that bids us glory in tribulation, and count it all joy when we fall into divers afflictions,
that so we may be associated with that great fellowship of suffering of which the Incarnate
God is the head, and through which He is carrying a redemptive conflict to a glorious victory
over evil. If we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him.

Even in the very making up of our physical nature, God puts suggestions of such a result. "Weeping
may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning." There are victorious powers in our
nature which are all the while working for us in our deepest pain. It is said, that, after
the sufferings of the rack, there ensues a period in which the simple repose from torture produces
a beatific trance; it is the reaction of Nature, asserting the benignant intentions of her
Creator. So, after great mental conflicts and agonies must come a reaction, and the Divine
Spirit, co-working with our spirit, seizes the favorable moment, and, interpenetrating natural
laws with a celestial vitality, carries up the soul to joys beyond the ordinary possibilities
of mortality.

It is said that gardeners, sometimes, when they would bring a rose to richer flowering, deprive
it, for a season, of light and moisture. Silent and dark it stands, dropping one fading leaf
after another, and seeming to go down patiently to death.

Gradually, as months passed away, the floods grew still; the mighty rushes of the inner tides
ceased to dash. There came first a delicious calmness, and then a celestial inner clearness,
in which the soul seemed to lie quiet as an untroubled ocean, reflecting heaven. Then came
the fulness of mysterious communion given to the pure in heart,--that advent of the Comforter
in the soul, teaching all things and bringing all things to remembrance; and Mary moved in
a world transfigured by a celestial radiance. Her face, so long mournfully calm, like some
chiselled statue of Patience, now wore a radiance, as when one places a light behind some alabaster
screen sculptured with mysterious and holy emblems, and words of strange sweetness broke from
her, as if one should hear snatches of music from a door suddenly opened in heaven. In her
eyes there was that nameless depth that one sees with awe in the Sistine Madonna,--eyes that
have measured infinite sorrow and looked through it to an infinite peace.

"My dear Madam," said the Doctor to Mrs. Scudder, "I cannot but think that there must be some
uncommonly gracious exercises passing in the mind of your daughter; for I observe, that, though
she is not inclined to conversation, she seems to be much in prayer; and I have, of late, felt
the sense of a Divine Presence with her in a most unusual degree. Has she opened her mind to you?"

"Mary was always a silent girl," said Mrs. Scudder, "and not given to speaking of her own feelings;
indeed, until she gave you an account of her spiritual state, on joining the church, I never
knew what her exercises were. Hers is a most singular case. I never knew the time when she
did not seem to love God more than anything else. It has disturbed me sometimes,--because I
did not know but it might be mere natural sensibility, instead of gracious affection."

"Do not disturb yourself, Madam," said the Doctor. "The Spirit worketh when, where, and how
He will; and, undoubtedly, there have been cases where His operations commence exceedingly
early. Mr. Edwards relates a case of a young person who experienced a marked conversion when
three years of age; and Jeremiah was called from the womb. (Jeremiah, i. 5.) In all cases we
must test the quality of the evidence without relation to the time of its commencement. I do
not generally lay much stress on our impressions, which are often uncertain and delusive; yet
I have had an impression that the Lord would be pleased to make some singular manifestations
of His grace through this young person. In the economy of grace there is neither male nor female;
and Peter says (Acts, ii. 17) that the Spirit of the Lord shall be poured out and your sons
and your daughters shall prophesy. Yet if we consider that the Son of God, as to his human
nature, was made of a woman, it leads us to see that in matters of grace God sets a special
value on woman's nature and designs to put special honor upon it. Accordingly, there have been
in the Church, in all ages, holy women who have received the Spirit and been called to a ministration
in the things of God,--such as Deborah, Huldah, and Anna, the prophetess. In our own days,
most uncommon manifestations of divine grace have been given to holy women. It was my privilege
to be in the family of President Edwards at a time when Northampton was specially visited,
and his wife seemed and spoke more like a glorified spirit than a mortal woman,--and multitudes
flocked to the house to hear her wonderful words. She seemed to have such a sense of the Divine
love as was almost beyond the powers of nature to endure. Just to speak the words, 'Our Father
who art in heaven,' would overcome her with such a manifestation that she would become cold
and almost faint; and though she uttered much, yet she told us that the divinest things she
saw could not be spoken. These things could not be fanaticism, for she was a person of a singular
evenness of nature, and of great skill and discretion in temporal matters, and of an exceeding
humility, sweetness, and quietness of disposition."

"I have observed of late," said Mrs. Scudder, "that, in our praying circles, Mary seemed much
carried out of herself, and often as if she would speak, and with difficulty holding herself
back. I have not urged her, because I thought it best to wait till she should feel full liberty."

"Therein you do rightly, Madam," said the Doctor; "but I am persuaded you will hear from her yet."

It came at length, the hour of utterance. And one day, in a praying circle of the women of
the church, all were startled by the clear silver tones of one who sat among them and spoke
with the unconscious simplicity of an angel child, calling God her Father, and speaking of
an ineffable union in Christ, binding all things together in one, and making all complete in
Him. She spoke of a love passing knowledge,--passing all love of lovers or of mothers,--a love
forever spending, yet never spent,--a love ever pierced and bleeding, yet ever constant and
triumphant, rejoicing with infinite joy to bear in its own body the sins and sorrows of a universe,--conquering,
victorious love, rejoicing to endure, panting to give, and offering its whole self with an
infinite joyfulness for our salvation. And when, kneeling, she poured out her soul in prayer,
her words seemed so many winged angels, musical with unearthly harpings of an untold blessedness.
They who heard her had the sensation of rising in the air, of feeling a celestial light and
warmth, descending into their souls; and when, rising, she stood silent and with downcast drooping
eyelids, there were tears in all eyes, and a hush in all movements as she passed, as if something
celestial were passing out.

Miss Prissy came rushing homeward, to hold a private congratulatory talk with the Doctor and
Mrs. Scudder, while Mary was tranquilly setting the tea-table and cutting bread for supper.

"To see her now, certainly," said Miss Prissy, "moving round so thoughtful, not forgetting
anything, and doing everything so calm, you wouldn't 'a' thought it could be her that spoke
those blessed words and made that prayer! Well, certainly, that prayer seemed to take us all
right up and put us down in heaven! and when I opened my eyes, and saw the roses and asparagus-bushes
on the manteltree-piece, I had to ask myself, 'Where have I been?' Oh, Miss Scudder, her afflictions
have been sanctified to her!--and really, when I see her going on so, I feel she can't be long
for us. They say, dying grace is for dying hours; and I'm sure this seems more like dying grace
than anything that I ever yet saw."

"She is a precious gift," said the Doctor; "let us thank the Lord for his grace through her.
She has evidently had a manifestation of the Beloved, and feedeth among the lilies (Canticles,
vi. 3); and we will not question the Lord's further dispensations concerning her."

"Certainly," said Miss Prissy, briskly, "it's never best to borrow trouble; 'sufficient unto
the day' is enough, to be sure.--And now, Miss Scudder, I thought I'd just take a look at that
dove-colored silk of yours to-night, to see what would have to be done with it, because I must
make every minute tell; and you know I lose half a day every week for the prayer-meeting. Though
I ought not to say I lose it, either; for I was telling Miss General Wilcox I wouldn't give
up that meeting for bags and bags of gold. She wanted me to come and sew for her one Wednesday,
and says I, 'Miss Wilcox, I'm poor and have to live by my work, but I a'n't so poor but what
I have some comforts, and I can't give up my prayer-meeting for any money,--for you see, if
one gets a little lift there, it makes all the work go lighter,--but then I have to be particular
to save up every scrap and end of time."

Mrs. Scudder and Miss Prissy crossed the kitchen and entered the bedroom, and soon had the
dove-colored silk under consideration.

"Well, Miss Scudder," said Miss Prissy, after mature investigation, "here's a broad hem, not
cut at all on the edge, as I see, and that might be turned down, and so cut off the worn spot
up by the waist,--and then, if it is turned, it will look every bit and grain as well as a
new silk;--I'll sit right down now and go to ripping. I put my ripping-knife into my pocket
when I put on this dress to go to prayer-meeting, because, says I to myself, there'll be something
to do at Miss Scudder's to-night. You just get an iron to the fire, and we'll have it all ripped
and pressed out before dark."

Miss Prissy seated herself at the open window, as cheery as a fresh apple-blossom, and began
busily plying her knife, looking at the garment she was ripping with an astute air, as if she
were about to circumvent it into being a new dress by some surprising act of legerdemain. Mrs.
Scudder walked to the looking-glass and began changing her bonnet cap for a tea-table one.

Miss Prissy, after a while, commenced in a mysterious tone.

"Miss Scudder, I know folks like me shouldn't have their eyes open too wide, but then I can't
help noticing some things. Did you see the Doctor's face when we was talking to him about Mary?
Why, he colored all up and the tears came into his eyes. It's my belief that that blessed man
worships the ground she treads on. I don't mean worships, either,--'cause that would be wicked,
and he's too good a man to make a graven image of anything,--but it's clear to see that there
a'n't anybody in the world like Mary to him. I always did think so; but I used to think Mary
was such a little poppet--that she'd do better for--Well, you know, I thought about some younger
man;--but, laws, now I see how she rises up to be ahead of everybody, and is so kind of solemn-like.
I can't but see the leadings of Providence. What a minister's wife she'd be, Miss Scudder!--why,
all the ladies coming out of prayer-meeting were speaking of it. You see, they want the Doctor
to get married;--it seems more comfortable-like to have ministers married; one feels more free
to open their exercises of mind; and as Miss Deacon Twitchel said to me,--'If the Lord had
made a woman o' purpose, as he did for Adam, he wouldn't have made her a bit different from
Mary Scudder.' Why, the oldest of us would follow her lead,--'cause she goes before us without
knowing it."

"I feel that the Lord has greatly blessed me in such a child," said Mrs. Scudder, "and I feel
disposed to wait the leadings of Providence."

"Just exactly," said Miss Prissy, giving a shake to her silk; "and as Miss Twitchel said, in
this case every providence seems to p'int. I felt dreadfully for her along six months back;
but now I see how she's been brought out, I begin to see that things are for the best, perhaps,
after all. I can't help feeling that Jim Marvyn is gone to heaven, poor fellow! His father
is a deacon,--and such a good man!--and Jim, though he did make a great laugh wherever he went,
and sometimes laughed where he hadn't ought to, was a noble-hearted fellow. Now, to be sure,
as the Doctor says, 'amiable instincts a'n't true holiness'; but then they are better than
unamiable ones, like Simeon Brown's. I do think, if that man is a Christian, he is a dreadful
ugly one; he snapped me short up about my change, when he settled with me last Tuesday; and
if I hadn't felt that it was a sinful rising, I should have told him I'd never put foot in
his house again; I'm glad, for my part, he's gone out of our church. Now Jim Marvyn was like
a prince to poor people; and I remember once his mother told him to settle with me, and he
gave me 'most double, and wouldn't let me make change. 'Confound it all, Miss Prissy,' says
he, 'I wouldn't stitch as you do from morning to night for double that money.' Now I know we
can't do anything to recommend ourselves to the Lord, but then I can't help feeling some sorts
of folks must be by nature more pleasing to Him than others. David was a man after God's own
heart, and he was a generous, whole-souled fellow, like Jim Marvyn, though he did get carried
away by his spirits sometimes and do wrong things; and so I hope the Lord saw fit to make Jim
one of the elect. We don't ever know what God's grace has done for folks. I think a great many
are converted when we know nothing about it, as Miss Twitchel told poor old Miss Tyrel, who
was mourning about her son, a dreadful wild boy, who was killed falling from mast-head; she
says, that from the mast-head to the deck was time enough for divine grace to do the work."

"I have always had a trembling hope for poor James," said Mrs. Scudder,--"not on account of
any of his good deeds or amiable traits, because election is without foresight of any good
works,--but I felt he was a child of the covenant, at least by the father's side, and I hope
the Lord has heard his prayer. These are dark providences; the world is full of them; and all
we can do is to have faith that the Lord will bring infinite good out of finite evil, and make
everything better than if the evil had not happened. That's what our good Doctor is always
repeating; and we must try to rejoice, in view of the happiness of the universe, without considering
whether we or our friends are to be included in it or not."

"Well, dear me!" said Miss Prissy, "I hope, if that is necessary, it will please the Lord to
give it to me; for I don't seem to find any powers in me to get up to it. But all's for the
best, at any rate,--and that's a comfort."

Just at this moment Mary's clear voice at the door announced that tea was on the table.

"Coming, this very minute," said Miss Prissy, bustling up and pulling off her spectacles. Then,
running across the room, she shut the door mysteriously, and turned to Mrs. Scudder with the
air of an impending secret. Miss Prissy was subject to sudden impulses of confidence, in which
she was so very cautious that not the thickest oak-plank door seemed secure enough, and her
voice dropped to its lowest key. The most important and critical words were entirely omitted,
or supplied by a knowing wink and a slight stamp of the foot.

In this mood she now approached Mrs. Scudder, and, holding up her hand on the door-side to
prevent consequences, if, after all she should be betrayed into a loud word, she said, "I thought
I'd just say, Miss Scudder, that, in case Mary should ---- the Doctor,--in case, you know,
there should be a ---- in the house, you must just contrive it so as to give me a month's notice,
so that I could give you a whole fortnight to fix her up as such a good man's ---- ought to
be. Now I know how spiritually-minded our blessed Doctor is; but, bless you, Ma'am, he's got
eyes. I tell you, Miss Scudder, these men, the best of 'em, feel what's what, though they don't
know much. I saw the Doctor look at Mary that night I dressed her for the wedding-party. I
tell you he'd like to have his wife look pretty well, and he'll get up some blessed text or
other about it, just as he did that night about being brought unto the king in raiment of needle-work.
That is an encouraging thought to us sewing-women.

"But this thing was spoken of after the meeting. Miss Twitchel and Miss Jones were talking
about it; and they all say that there would be the best setting-out got for her that was ever
seen in Newport, if it should happen. Why, there's reason in it. She ought to have at least
two real good India silks that will stand alone,--and you'll see she'll have 'em, too; you
let me alone for that; and I was thinking, as I lay awake last night, of a new way of making
up, that you will say is just the sweetest that ever you did see. And Miss Jones was saying
that she hoped there wouldn't anything happen without her knowing it, because her husband's
sister in Philadelphia has sent her a new receipt for cake, and she has tried it and it came
out beautifully, and she says she'll send some in."

All the time that this stream was flowing, Mrs. Scudder stood with the properly reserved air
of a discreet matron, who leaves all such matters to Providence, and is not supposed unduly
to anticipate the future; and, in reply, she warmly pressed Miss Prissy's hand, and remarked,
that no one could tell what a day might bring forth,--and other general observations on the
uncertainty of mortal prospects, which form a becoming shield when people do not wish to say
more exactly what they are thinking of.

[To be continued.]

ONCE AND NOW.

The Mourner lies in the solemn room
    Where his Dead hath lately lain;
And in the drear, oppressive gloom,
Death-pallid with the dying moon,
    There pass before his brain,
In blended visions manifold,
The present and the days of old.

Fair falls the snow on her grave to-day,
    Shrouding her sleep sublime;
But he sees in the sunny far-away
None among maidens so fair and gay
    As she in her sweet spring-time:
Where the song and the sport and the revel be,
None among maidens so fair as she.

He marks where the perfect crescent dips
    Above the heaven of her eyes,
Her beamy hair in soft eclipse,
The red enchantment of her lips,
    And all the grace that lies
Dreaming in her neck's pure curve,
With its regal lift and its swanlike swerve.

In pictures which are forever joys,
    She cometh to him once more:
Once, with her dainty foot a-poise,
She drives the bird with a merry noise
    From her lifted battledoor,
And tosses back, with impatient air,
The ruffled glory of her hair;--

Then gayly draping a painted doll,
    To please an eager child;
Or pacing athwart a stately hall;
Or kneeling at dewy evenfall,
    When clouds are crimson-piled,
And all the hushed and scented air
Is tremulous with the voice of prayer;--

Or standing mute and rapture-bound
    The while her sisters sing;
From voice and lute there floats around
A golden confluence of sound,
    Spreading in fairy ring;
And with a beautiful grace and glow
Her head sways to the music's flow.

One night of nights in lustrous June,
    She walks with him alone;
Through silver glidings of the moon
The runnels purl a dreamy tune;
    His arm is round her thrown:
But looks and sounds far lovelier
Thrill on his trancéd soul from her.

And then that rounded bliss, increased
    To one consummate hour!
The marriage-robe, the stoléd priest,
The kisses when the rite hath ceased,
    And with her heart's rich dower
She standeth by his shielding side,
His wedded wife and his own bright bride!

And then the sacred influence
    That flushed her flower to prime!
Through Love's divine omnipotence
She ripened to a mother once,
    But once, and for all time:
No higher heaven on him smiled
Than that young mother and her child.

Then all the pleasant household scenes
    Through all the latter years!
No murky shadow intervenes,--
Her gentle aspect only leans
    Through the soft mist of tears;
Her sweet, warm smile, her welkin glance,--
There is no speech nor utterance.

O angel form, O darling face,
    Slow fading from the shore!
O brave, true heart, whose warmest place
Was his alone by Love's sweet grace,
    Still, still, forevermore!
And now he lonely lieth, broken-hearted;
For all the grace and glory have departed.

Snow-cold in sculptured calm she lies,
    Apparelled saintly white;
On her sealed lips no sweet replies,
And the blue splendor of her eyes
    Gone down in dreamless night;
All empery of Death expressed
In that inexorable rest!

Now leave this fair and holy Thing
    Alone with God's dear grace!
Her grave is but the entering
Beneath the shadow of His wing,
    Her trusty hiding-place,
Till, in the grand, sweet Dawn, at last,
This tyranny be overpast.

A TRIP TO CUBA.

CAN GRANDE'S DEPARTURE.--THE DOMINICA.--LOTTERY-TICKETS.

I have not told you how Can Grande took leave of the Isle of Rogues, as one of our party christened
the fair Queen of the Antilles. I could not tell you how he loathed the goings on at Havana,
how hateful he found the Spaniards, and how villainous the American hotel-keepers. His superlatives
of censure were in such constant employment that they began to have a threadbare sound before
he left us; and as he has it in prospective to run the gantlet of all the inn-keepers on the
continent of Europe, to say nothing of farther lands, where inn-keepers would be a relief,
there is no knowing what exhaustion his powers in this sort may undergo before he reaches us
again. He may break down into weak, compliant good-nature, and never be able to abuse anybody
again, as long as he lives. In that case, his past life and his future, taken together, will
make a very respectable average. But the climate really did not suit him, the company did not
satisfy him, and there came a moment when he said, "I can bear it no longer!" and we answered,
"Go in peace!"

It now becomes me to speak of Sobrina, who has long been on a temperance footing, and who forgets
even to blush when the former toddy is mentioned, though she still shudders at the remembrance
of sour-sop. She is the business-man of the party; and while philosophy and highest considerations
occupy the others, with an occasional squabble over virtue and the rights of man, she changes
lodgings, hires carts, transports baggage, and, knowing half-a-dozen words of Spanish, makes
herself clearly comprehensible to everybody. We have found a Spanish steamer for Can Grande;
but she rows thither in a boat and secures his passage and state-room. The noontide sun is
hot upon the waters, but her zeal is hotter still. Now she has made a curious bargain with
her boatmen, by which they are to convey the whole party to the steamer on the fourth day.

"What did you tell them?" we asked.

"I said, tres noches (three nights) and un dia, (one day,) and then took out my watch and showed
them five o'clock on it, and pointed to the boat and to myself. They understood, perfectly."

And so, in truth, they did; for, going to the wharf on the day and at the hour appointed, we
found the boatmen in waiting, with eager faces. But here a new difficulty presented itself;--the
runner of our hotel, a rascal German, whose Cuban life has sharpened his wits and blunted his
conscience, insisted that the hiring of boats for the lodgers was one of his (many) perquisites,
and that before his sovereign prerogative all other agreements were null and void.--N.B. There
was always something experimentative about this man's wickedness. He felt that he did not know
how far men might be gulled, or the point where they would be likely to resist. This was a
fault of youth. With increasing years and experience he will become bolder and more skilful,
and bids fair, we should say, to become one of the most dexterous operators known in his peculiar
line. On the present occasion, he did not heed the piteous pleadings of the disappointed boatmen,
nor Sobrina's explanations, nor Can Grande's arguments. But when the whole five of us fixed
upon him our mild and scornful eyes, something within him gave way. He felt a little bit of
the moral pressure of Boston, and feebly broke down, saying, "You better do as you like, then,"
and so the point was carried.

A pleasant run brought us to the side of the steamer. It was dusk already as we ascended her
steep gangway, and from that to darkness there is, at this season, but the interval of a breath.
Dusk, too, were our thoughts, at parting from Can Grande, the mighty, the vehement, the great
fighter. How were we to miss his deep music, here and at home! With his assistance we had made
a very respectable band; now we were to be only a wandering drum and fife,--the fife particularly
shrill, and the drum particularly solemn. Well, we went below, and examined the little den
where Can Grande was to pass the other seven days of his tropical voyaging. The berths were
arranged the wrong way,--across, not along, the vessel,--and we foresaw that his head would
go up and his feet down, and vice versâ, with every movement of the steamer, and our weak brains
reeled at the bare thought of what he was to suffer. He, good soul, meanwhile, was thinking
of his supper, and wondering if he could get tea, coffee, and chocolate, a toasted roll, and
the touch of cold ham which an invalid loves. And we beheld, and they were bringing up the
side of the vessel trays of delicious pastry, and festoons of fowls, with more literal butcher's
meat. And we said, "There will be no famine on board. Make the most of your supper, Can Grande;
for it will be the last of earth to you, for some time to come." And now came silence, and
tears, and last embraces; we slipped down the gangway into our little craft, and, looking up,
saw, bending above us, between the slouched hat and the silver beard, the eyes that we can
never forget, that seemed to drop back in the darkness with the solemnity of a last farewell.
We went home, and the drum hung himself gloomily on his peg, and the little fife shut up for
the remainder of the evening.

Has Mr. Dana described the Dominica, I wonder? Well, if he has, I cannot help it. He never
can have eaten so many ices there as I have, nor passed so many patient hours amid the screeching,
chattering, and devouring, which make it most like a cage of strange birds, or the monkey department
in the Jardin des Plantes.--Mem. I always observed that the monkeys just mentioned seemed far
more mirthful than their brethren in the London Zoölogical Gardens. They form themselves, so
to speak, on a livelier model, and feel themselves more at home with their hosts.

But the Dominica. You know, probably, that it is the great café of Havana. All the day long
it is full of people of all nations, sipping ices, chocolate, and so on; and all night long,
also, up to the to me very questionable hour when its patrons go home and its garçons go to
bed. We often found it a welcome refuge at noon, when the douche of sunlight on one's cervix
bewilders the faculties, and confuses one's principles of gravitation, toleration, etc., etc.
You enter from the Tophet of the street, and the intolerable glare is at once softened to a
sort of golden shadow. The floor is of stone; in the midst trickles a tiny fountain with golden
network; all other available space is crowded with marble tables, square or round; and they,
in turn, are scarcely visible for the swarm of black-coats that gather round them. The smoke
of innumerable cigars gives a Rembrandtic tinge to the depths of the picture, and the rows
and groups of nodding Panama hats are like very dull flower-beds. In the company, of course,
the Spanish-Cuban element largely predominates; yet here and there the sharper English breaks
upon the ear.

"Yes, I went to that plantation; but they have only one thousand boxes of sugar, and we want
three thousand for our operation."

A Yankee, you say. Yes, certainly; and turning, you see the tall, strong Philadelphian from
our hotel, who calls for everything by its right name, and always says, "Mas! mas!" when the
waiter helps him to ice. Some one near us is speaking a fuller English, with a richer "r" and
deeper intonation. See there! that is our own jolly captain, Brownless of ours, the King of
the "Karnak"; and going up to the British lion, we shake the noble beast heartily by the paw.

The people about us are imbibing a variety of cooling liquids. Our turn comes at last. The
garçon who says, "I speke Aingliss," brings us each a delicious orange granizada, a sort of
half-frozen water-ice, familiar to Italy, but unknown in America. It is ice in the first enthusiasm
of freezing,--condensed, not hardened. Promoting its liquefaction with the spoon, you enjoy
it through the mediation of a straw. The unskilful make strange noises and gurglings through
this tenuis avena; but to those who have not forgotten the accomplishment of suction, as acquired
at an early period of existence, the modus in quo is easy and agreeable.

You will hardly weary of watching the groups that come and go and sit and talk in this dreamy
place. If you are a lady, every black eye directs its full, tiresome stare at your face, no
matter how plain that face may be. But you have learned before this to consider those eyes
as so many black dots, so many marks of wonder with no sentence attached; and so you coolly
pursue your philosophizing in your corner, strong in the support of a companion, who, though
deeply humanitarian and peaceful, would not hesitate to punch any number of Spanish heads that
should be necessary for the maintenance of your comfort and his dignity.

The scene is occasionally varied by the appearance of a beggar-woman, got up in great decency,
and with a wonderful air of pinched and faded gentility. She wears an old shawl upon her head,
but it is as nicely folded as an aristocratic mantilla; her feet are cased in the linen slippers
worn by the poorer classes, but there are no unsavory rags and dirt about her. "That good walk
of yours, friend," I thought, "does not look like starvation." Yet, if over there were a moment
when one's heart should soften towards an imposing fellow-creature, it is when one is in the
midst of the orange granizada. The beggar circles slowly and mournfully round all the marble
tables in turn, holding out her hand to each, as the plate is offered at a church collection.
She is not importunate; but, looking in each one's face, seems to divine whether he will give
or no. A Yankee, sitting with a Spaniard, offers her his cigar. The Spaniard gravely pushes
the cigar away, and gives her a medio.

More pertinacious is the seller of lottery-tickets, male or female, who has more at stake,
and must run the risk of your displeasure for the chance of your custom. Even in your bed you
are hardly safe from the ticket-vender. You stand at your window, and he, waiting in the street,
perceives you, and with nods, winks, and showing of his wares endeavors to establish a communication
with you. Or you stop and wait somewhere in your volante, and in the twinkling of an eye the
wretch is at your side to bear you company till you drive off again. At the Dominica he is
especially persevering, and stands and waits with as much zeal as if he knew the saintly line
of Milton. Like the beggar, however, he is discriminative in the choice of his victims, and
persecutes the stony Yankee less than the oily Spaniard, whose inbred superstitions force him
to believe in luck.

Very strange stories do they tell about the trade in lottery-tickets,--strange, at least, to
us, who consider them the folly of follies. Here, as in Italy, the lotteries are under the
care of the State, and their administration is as careful and important as that of any other
branch of finance. They are a regular and even reputable mode of investment. The wealthy commercial
houses all own tickets, sometimes keeping the same number for years, but more frequently changing
after each unsuccessful experiment. A French gentleman in Havana assured me that his tickets
had already cost him seven thousand dollars. "And now," said he, "I cannot withdraw, for I
cannot lose what I have already paid. The number has not been up once in eight years; its turn
must come soon. If I were to sell my ticket, some one would be sure to draw the great prize
with it the week after." This, perhaps, is not very unlike the calculations of business risks
most in vogue in our great cities. A single ticket costs an ounce (seventeen dollars); but
you are constantly offered fractions, to an eighth or a sixteenth. There are ticket-brokers
who accommodate the poorer classes with interests to the amount of ten cents, and so on. Thus,
for them, the lottery replaces the savings-bank, with entire uncertainty of any return, and
the demoralizing process of expectation thrown into the bargain. The negroes invest a good
deal of money in this way, and we heard in Matanzas a curious anecdote on this head. A number
of negroes, putting their means together, had commissioned a ticket-broker to purchase and
hold for them a certain ticket. After long waiting and paying up, news came to Matanzas that
the ticket had drawn the $100,000 prize. The owners of the negroes were in despair at this
intelligence. "Now my cook will buy himself," says one; "my calesero will be free," says another;
and so on. The poor slaves ran, of course, in great agitation, to get their money. But, lo!
the office was shut up. The rascal broker had absconded. He had never run the risk of purchasing
the ticket; but had coolly appropriated this and similar investments to his own use, preferring
the bird in the hand to the whole aviary of possibilities. He was never heard of more; but
should he ever turn up anywhere, I commend him as the fittest subject for Lynch-law on record.

Well, as I have told you, all these golden chances wait for you at the Dominica, and many Americans
buy, and look very foolish when they acknowledge it. The Nassauese all bought largely during
their short stay; and even their little children held up with exultation their fragments of
tickets, all good for something, and bad for something, too.

If you visit the Dominica in the evening, you find the same crowd, only with a sprinkling of
women, oftenest of your own country, in audacious bonnets, and with voices and laughter which
bring the black eyes upon them for a time. If it be Sunday evening, you will see here and there
groups of ladies in full ball-dress, fresh from the Paseo, the volante waiting for them outside.
All is then at its gayest and busiest; but your favorite waiter, with disappointment in his
eyes, will tell you that there is "no mas" of your favorite granizada, and will persuade you
to take, I know not what nauseous substitute in its place; for all ices are not good at the
Dominica, and some are (excuse the word) nasty. People sit and sip, prolonging their pleasures
with dilatory spoon and indefatigable tongue. Group follows group; but the Spaniards are what
I should call heavy sitters, and tarry long over their ice or chocolate. The waiter invariably
brings to every table a chafing-dish with a burning coal, which will light a cigar long after
its outer glow has subsided into ashy white. Some humans retain this kindling power;--vide
Ninon and the ancient Goethe;--it is the heart of fire, not the flame of beauty, that does
it. When one goes home, tired, at ten or eleven, the company shows no sign of thinning, nor
does one imagine how the ground is ever cleared, so as to allow an interval of sleep between
the last ice at night and the first coffee in the morning. It is the universal siesta which
makes the Cubans so bright and fresh in the evening. With all this, their habits are sober,
and the evening refreshment always light. No suppers are eaten here; and it is even held dangerous
to take fruit as late as eight o'clock, P.M.

The Dominica has still another aspect to you, when you go there in the character of a citizen
and head of family to order West India sweetmeats for home-consumption. You utter the magic
word dulces, and are shown with respect into the establishment across the way, where a neat
steam-engine is in full operation, tended by blacks and whites, stripped above the waist, and
with no superfluous clothing below it. Here they grind the chocolate, and make the famous preserves,
of which a list is shown you, with prices affixed. As you will probably lose some minutes in
perplexity as to which are best for you to order, let me tell you that the guava jelly and
marmalade are first among them, and there is no second. You may throw in a little pine-apple,
mamey, lime, and cocoa-plum; but the guava is the thing, and, in case of a long run on the
tea-table, will give the most effectual support. The limes used to be famous in our youth;
but in these days they make them hard and tough. The marmalade of bitter oranges is one of
the most useful of Southern preserves; but I do not remember it on the list of the Dominica.
Having given your order, let me further advise you to remain, if practicable, and see it fulfilled;
as you will find, otherwise, divers trifling discrepancies between the bill and the goods as
delivered, which, though of course purely accidental, will all be, somehow, to the Dominica's
advantage, and not to yours. If you are in moderate circumstances, order eight or ten dollars'
worth; if affluent, twenty or thirty dollars' worth; if rash and extravagant, you may rise
even to sixty dollars; but you will find in such an outlay food for repentance. One word in
your ear: do not buy the syrups, for they are made with very bad sugar, and have no savor of
the fruits they represent.

And this is all I can tell about the Dominica, which I recommend to all of you for refreshment
and amusement. We have nothing like it in New York or Boston,--our salons of the same description
having in them much more to eat and much less to see. As I look back upon it, the place assumes
a deeply Moorish aspect. I see the fountain, the golden light, the dark faces, and intense
black eyes, a little softened by the comforting distance. Oh! to sit there for one hour, and
help the garçon's bad English, and be pestered by the beggar, and tormented by the ticket-vender,
and support the battery of the wondering looks, which make it sin for you, a woman, to be abroad
by day! Is there any purgatory which does not grow lovely as you remember it? Would not a man
be hanged twice, if he could?

ZELMA'S VOW.

[Continued from the July Number.]

PART SECOND.

HOW IT WAS KEPT.

It was late when Zelma Burleigh returned to the Grange. As she stole softly into the hall,
she startled an Italian greyhound, which was lying asleep on a mat near the door. As he sprang
up, the little silver bells on his collar tinkled out his master's secret;--Sir Harry Willerton
was still in the drawing-room with Bessie.

As Zelma passed up to her chamber, she said to herself bitterly,--"Thus openly and fearlessly
can the rich and well-born woo and be wooed, while such as we must steal away to happiness
as to crime, and plight our vows under the chill and shadow of night!" But the next moment
she felt that there was about her love a piquant sense of peril and lawlessness, a wild flavor
infinitely more to her taste than would be any prudent, commendable affection grown in drawing-rooms,
nourished by conventionalism, and propped by social fitness; and remembering the manly beauty
and brilliant parts of her lover, she felt that she would not exchange him for the proudest
noble of the realm.

After a time Bessie came stealing up from the drawing-room, and lay down by her cousin's side,
softly, for fear of waking her; and all night long Bessie's secret curled about her smiling
mouth, and quivered through the lids of her shut eyes, and overran her red lips in murmurs
of happy dreams; but Zelma's secret burned like slow fire in her deepest heart. Bessie dreamed
of merry games and quiet rambles and country fêtes with the gay Sir Harry; but Zelma, when
at last she slept, dreamed of wandering with her adventurous lover from province to province,--then
of playing Juliet to his Romeo before a vast metropolitan audience.

Days went on, and Bessie's pure, transparent nature, a lily-bud of sweetest womanhood, seemed
unconsciously revealing itself, leaf by leaf, to all the world, and blooming out its beautiful
innermost life; but Zelma's secret still smouldered in her shut heart, never by any chance
flaming up to her lips in words. Her month assumed a look of rigid resolution, almost of desperation;
and her eyes shone with a hard, diamond-like brilliancy, fitful, but never soft or tearful.
Her manner grew more and more moody and constrained, till even her matter-of-fact uncle and
aunt, good easy souls, and her absorbed cousin, became curious and anxious. The little elfish
black pony was in more frequent request than ever; for his mistress now went out at any hour
that suited her whim, in any weather, chose the loneliest by-ways, and rode furiously. Often,
at evening, she ascended a dark gorge of the western hills and plunged down on the other side,
as though in hot pursuit of the setting sun; and at length there came a report from the gossiping
post-mistress of a little village over there, that she came for letters, which she duly received,
addressed in a dashing, manly hand. This story, coming to the ears of Roger Burleigh, quickened
his dull suspicions that "something was wrong with that poor girl"; and just as he was getting
positive and peremptory, and Bessie perplexed and alarmed, Zelma disappeared!

For several days there were anxious inquiries and vain searches in every direction,--storming,
weeping, and sleeplessness in the Squire's usually happy household; and then came a letter,
whose Scottish post-mark revealed much of the mystery. It was from Zelma, telling that she
had left the Grange forever, and become the wife of "Mr. Bury, the strolling player"; and saying
that she had taken this step of her own free will, knowing it to be a fatal, unpardonable sin
against caste, and that it would set a great gulf between her and her respectable relatives.
Yet, she asked, had not a gulf of feeling, as deep and wide, ever separated their hearts from
the gypsy's daughter? and was it not better and more honest to break the weak social ties of
protection and dependence which had stretched like wild vines across the chasm to hide it from
the world? She then bade them all an abrupt and final farewell It was a letter brief, cold,
and curt, almost to insolence; but beneath her new name, which was dashed off with somewhat
of a dramatic flourish, there appeared hurriedly scrawled in pencil a woman's postscript, containing
the real soul of the letter, a passionate burst of feeling, a bitter cry of long-repressed,
sorrowful tenderness. It implored forgiveness for any pain she might ever have given them,
for any disgrace she might ever bring upon them,--it thanked and blessed them for past kindness,
and humbly prayed for them the choicest gifts and the most loving protection of Heaven. This
postscript was signed "Zelle,"--the orphan's childish and pet name at the Grange, which she
now put off with the peace and purity of maidenhood and domestic life.

When it was known how Zelma Burleigh had fled, and with whom, the neighboring gentry were duly
shocked and scandalized. The village gossips declared that they had always foreseen some such
fate for "that strange girl," and sagely prophesied that the master of Willerton Hall would
abandon all thought of an alliance with a family whose escutcheon had suffered so severely.
But they counted on the baronet, not on the man,--and so, for once, were mistaken.

As for honest Roger Burleigh, he was beside himself with amazement and indignation at the folly
and ingratitude of his niece and the measureless presumption of "that infernal puppy of a play-actor,"
as he denominated Zelma's clever husband.

As he was one day talking over the sad affair with his friend Sir Harry, who best succeeded
in soothing him down, he inveighed against all actors and actresses in the strongest terms
of aversion and contempt, giving free expression to the violent provincial prejudice of his
time against players of all degrees.

"But, my dear Sir," interrupted the young Baronet, "your niece has not become an actress,--only
the wife of a promising actor."

"No,--but she will be one yet. She's stage-struck now, more than anything else; and mark my
words,--that villain will have her on the boards before the year's end, and live by her ranting.
Why, you see, Sir Harry, strolling is in the blood, and must out, I suppose. The girl, as you
may have heard, is half gypsy. My brother, Captain Burleigh, was a sad scamp, and actually
married a Spanish Zincala! He was drunk at the time, we have the consolation to believe, or
he could never have so far belied his good old English blood, dissipated dog as he was. To
be sure, she saved his life once, and really was a beautiful, devoted creature, by all accounts;
and if Zelma had done no worse than she,--run away with any poor devil, provided only he were
a gentleman,--or if she had gone off vagabondizing with one of her mother's people, it would
not have been so infamous an affair as it is; she might still have been accounted an honest
woman;--but, my God, Sir Harry, a strolling player!"

Mrs. Burleigh was but a dutiful echo of her husband's prejudices, and gave up her hapless niece
as lost beyond redemption; but Bessie, though she grieved more than either, suffered from no
sense of humiliation, and allowed no virtuous anger, no injurious doubts, to enter her blessed
little heart. Yet she missed her lost companion, her strong friend, and, still vine-like in
her instincts, turned wholly to the new support,--to one who submitted himself gladly to the
sweet inthralment, and felt all the grander for the luscious weight and tendril-like clasp.
And so Love came to pretty Bessie's heart "with healing in his wings."

       *       *       *       *       *

Unspeakable was the dismay of Mr. Bury at finding that a very modest amount of personal property
was all that his runaway wife could hope to receive from her relatives,--that she was utterly
portionless, her father having more than exhausted the patrimony of a younger son. He had supposed,
from Zelma's apparently honorable position in the household of her uncle, that she was, if
not an heiress, at least respectably dowered. Had he been better informed, it is doubtful whether,
improvident and enamored as he was, he would have ruralized and practicalized Romeo in the
lane of Burleigh Grange. Zelma herself, too unworldly to suspect that self-interest had anything
to do with her conquest, never alluded to her lack of dowry till it was too late. Then both
manly shame and manly passion (for the actor loved her in his way, which was by no means her
way, or the way of any large, loyal nature) restrained all unbecoming expression of chagrin
and disappointment,-- which yet sunk into his heart, and prepared the not uncongenial coil
for a goodly crop of suspicion, jealousy, alienation, aversion, and all manner of domestic
infelicities.

We cannot follow Zelma step by step, in her precarious and wandering life, for the six months
succeeding her marriage. It was a life not altogether distasteful to her. She was not enough
of a fine lady to be dismayed or humiliated by its straits and shifts of poverty, by its isolation
and ostracism; while there was something in its alternations of want and profusion, in its
piquant contrasts of real and mimic life, in its excitement, action, and change, which had
a peculiar charm for her wild and restless spirit. But from many of the associations of the
stage, from nearly all actors and actresses, and from all green-room loungers, she instinctively
recoiled, and held herself haughtily aloof from the motley little world behind the scenes,--apparently
by no effort, but as sphered apart by the atmosphere of refinement and superiority which enveloped
her. Yet she almost constantly accompanied her husband to rehearsal and play, where, for a
time, her presence was grateful both to the pride and a more amiable passion of her mercurial
lord. But the sight of that shy, shadowy figure haunting the wings, of those keen, critical
eyes ever following the business of the stage, at last grew irksome to him, and he would fain
have persuaded her to remain quietly at their lodgings, whilst he was attending to his professional
duties. But no, she would go with him,--not for pleasure, or even affection, but, as she always
avowed, for artistic purposes. That she had cherished, ever since her marriage, the plan of
adopting her husband's profession, she had never concealed from him. He usually laughed, in
his gay, supercilious way, when she spoke of this purpose, or lightly patted her grand head
and declared her to be a wilful, unpractical enthusiast,--too much a child of Nature to attempt
an art of any kind,--born to live and be poetry, not to declaim it,--to inspire genius, not
to embody it,--a Muse, not a Sibyl.

Once, when she was more than usually earnest in pleading for her plan,--not merely on the strength
of her own deep, prophetic conviction of her fitness for a dramatic career, but on the ground
of an urgent and bitter necessity for exertion on her part, to ward off actual destitution
and suffering,--he exclaimed, somewhat impatiently,--"Why, Zelma, it is an impossibility, almost
an absurdity, you urge! You could never make an actress. You are too hopelessly natural, erratic,
and impulsive. You would follow no teaching implicitly, but, when you saw fit, would trample
on conventionalities and venerable stage-traditions. You would set up the standard of revolt
against the ancient canons of Art, and flout it in the faces of the critics, and--fail,--ay,
fail, in spite of your great, staring eyes, the tragic weight of your brows, and the fiery
swell of your nostril."

"I should certainly tread my own ways on the boards, as elsewhere," replied Zelma, quietly,--"move
and act from the central force, the instinct and inspiration of Nature,--letting the passion
of my part work itself out in its own gestures, postures, looks, and tones,--falling short
of, or going beyond, mere stage-traditions. With all due deference for authorities, this would
be my art, as it has been the art of all truly great actors. I shall certainly not adopt my
husband's profession without his consent,--but I shall never cease importuning him for that
consent."

Lawrence "laughed a laugh of merry scorn," and left her to her solitary studies and the patient
nursing of her purpose.

It was finally, for Zelma's sake, through the unsolicited influence of Sir Harry Willerton,
that "Mr. Lawrence Bury, Tragedian," attained to a high point in a provincial actor's ambition,--a
London engagement.

After a disheartening period of waiting and idleness, during which he and his wife made actual
face-to-face acquaintance with want, and both came near playing their parts in the high-tragedy
of starvation in a garret, he made his first appearance before the audience of Covent Garden,
in the part of Mercutio. He was young, shapely, handsome, and clever,--full of flash and dash,
and, above all, new. He had chosen well his part,--Mercutio,--that graceful frolic of fancy,
which less requires sustained intellectual power than the exaltation of animal spirits,--that
brief sunburst of life, that brilliant bubble of character, which reflects, for a moment, a
world of beauty and sparkle, and dies in a flash of wit, yet leaves on the mind a want, a tender
regret, which follow one through all the storm and woe of the tragedy.

So it was little wonder, perhaps, that he achieved a decided success, though incomparably greater
artists had failed where he triumphed, and that, in spite of the doubtful looks and faint praise
of the critics, he became at once a public favorite,--the fashion, the rage. Ladies of the
highest ton condescended to admire and applaud, and hailed as a benefactor the creator of a
new sensation.

Very soon the young actor's aspiring soul rose above all secondary parts, dropped Mercutio
and Horatio for Romeo and Hamlet, and had not the sense to see that he was getting utterly
out of his element, dashing with silken sails into the tempest of tragedy, soaring on Icarian
wings over its profoundest deeps and into the height and heat of its intensest passion.

Yet with the young, the unthinking, the eager, the curious, it was then as it is now and ever
shall be,--confidence easily passed for genius, and presumption for power. Tributes of admiration
and envy poured in upon him,--anonymous missives, tender and daring, odorous with the atmosphere
of luxurious boudoirs, and coarse scrawls, scented with orange-peel and lamp-smoke, and seeming
to hiss with the sibilant whisper of green-room spite; and the young actor, valuing alike the
sentiments, kindly or malign, which ministered to his egoism, intoxicated with the first foamy
draught of fame, grew careless, freakish, and arrogant, as all suddenly adopted pets of the
public are likely to do.

At length Mr. Bury played before Royalty, and Royalty was heard to say to Nobility in attendance,--"What!--Who
is he? Where did he come from? How old is he? Not quite equal to Garrick yet, but clever,--eh,
my Lord?"

This gracious royal criticism, being duly reported and printed, removed the last let to aristocratic
favor; fast young bloods of the highest nobility did not acorn to shake off their perfumes
and air their profane vocabulary in the green-room, offering snuff and the incense of flattery
together to the Tamerlane, the Romeo, or the Lord Hamlet of the night.

Happily, with the actor's fame rose his salary; and as both rose, the actor and his wife descended
from their lofty attic-room--into whose one window the stars looked with, it seemed to Zelma,
a startling nearness--to respectable lodgings on the second floor.

It was during this first London season that the manager of Covent Garden, himself an actor,
remarked the rare capabilities of Zelma's face, voice, and figure for the stage, and in a matter-of-fact
business way spoke of them to her husband. The leading actor looked annoyed, and sought to
change the subject of conversation; but as the wife's dreamy eyes flashed with sudden splendor,
revealing the true dramatic fire, the manager returned upon him with his artistic convictions
and practical arguments, and at length wrung from him most reluctant consent that Zelma, after
the necessary study, should make a trial of her powers.

Though well over the first summer-warmth of his romantic passion, Lawrence Bury had not yet
grown so utterly cold toward his beautiful wife that he could see that trial approach without
some slight sympathetic dread; but his miserable egoism forbade him to wish her success; in
his secret heart he even hoped that an utter, irretrievable failure would wither at once and
forever her pretty artistic aspirations.

Zelma chose for her début the part of Zara in "The Mourning Bride,"--not out of any love for
the character, which was too stormy, vicious, and revengeful to engage her sympathies,--but
because it was rapid, vehement, sharply defined, and, if realized at all, she said, would put
her, by its very fierceness and wickedness, too far out of herself for failure,--sweep her
through the play like a whirlwind, and give her no time to droop. It had for her heart, moreover,
a peculiar charm of association, as her first play,--as that in which she had first beheld
the hero of her dreams, "the god of her idolatry," before whom she yet bowed, but as with eyes
cast down or veiled, not in reverence, but from a chill, unavowed fear of beholding the very
common clay of which he was fashioned.

The awful night of the début arrived, as doomsday will come at last; and after having been
elaborately arrayed for her part by a gossiping tire-woman, who would chatter incessantly,
relating, for the encouragement of the débutante, tale after tale of stage-fright, swoons,
and failure,--after having been plumed, powdered, and most reluctantly rouged, the rose of
nineteen summers having suddenly paled on her cheek, Zelma was silently conducted from her
dressing-room by her husband, who, as Osmyn, took his stand with her, the guards, and attendants
at the left wing, awaiting the summons to the presence of King Manuel. As they were listening
to the last tender bleating of Almeria, the same pretty actress whom Zelma had seen as Zara
at Arden, and the gruff responses of her sire, an eager whisper ran through the group;--the
King and Queen had entered the royal box! This was quite unexpected, and Zelma was aghast.
Involuntarily, she stretched out her hand and grasped that of her husband;--as she did so,
the rattle of the chains on her wrist betrayed her. The attendants looked round and smiled;--Lawrence
frowned and turned away, with a boy's pettishness. He had been more than usually moody that
day; but Zelma had believed him troubled for her sake, and even now interpreted his unkindness
as nervous anxiety.

The next moment, everything, even he, was forgotten; for she stood, she hardly knew how, upon
the stage, receiving and mechanically acknowledging a great burst of generous British applause.

It was a greeting less complaisant and patronizing than is usually given to débutantes. Zelma's
youthful charms, heightened by her sumptuous dress, took her audience by surprise, and, while
voice and action delayed, made for her friends and favor, and bribed judgment with beauty.

King Manuel receives his captives with a courteous speech,--only a few lines; but, during their
reading, through what a lifetime of fear, of pain, of unimaginable horrors passed Zelma! Stage-fright,
that waking nightmare of débutantes, clutched her at once, petrifying, while it tortured her.
The house seemed to surge around her, the stage to rock under her feet. She fancied she heard
low, elfish laughter behind the scenes, and already the hiss of the critics seemed to sing
in her reeling brain. A thousand eyes pierced her through and through,--seemed to see how the
frightened blood had shrunk away from its mask of rouge and hidden in her heart,--how that
poor childish heart fluttered and palpitated,--how near the hot tears were to the glazed eyeballs,--how
fast the black, obliterating shadows were creeping over the records of memory,--how the first
instinct of fear, a blind impulse to flight, was maddening her.

She raised her eyes to the royal box, where sat a stout, middle-aged man, with a dull, good-humored
face, a star and ribbon on his breast, and by his side a woman, ample and motherly, with an
ugly tuft of feathers on her head, and a diamond tiara, which lit up her heavy Dutch features
like a torch. The King, the Queen!

Just at this moment, his Majesty was in gracious converse with a lady on his right, a foreign
princess, of an ancient, unpronounceable title,--a thin, colorless head and form, overloaded
with immemorial family-jewels,--a mere frame of a woman, to hang brilliants upon. She was one
shine and shiver of diamonds, from head to foot;--she palpitated light, like a glow-worm. Her
Majesty, meanwhile, was regaling herself from a jewelled snuff-box, and talking affably over
her shoulder to her favorite mistress of the robes, the fearful Schwellenberg.

But Zelma, looking through the transfiguring atmosphere of loyalty, beheld the royal group
encompassed by all the ideal splendor and sacredness of majesty;--over their very commonplace
heads towered the airy crowns of a hundred regal ancestors, piled round on round, and glimmering
away into the clouds.

Ere she turned her fascinated eyes away from the august sight, her cue was given. She started,
and struggled to speak, but her lips clung together. There was a dull roar and whirl in her
brain, as of a vortex of waters. In piteous appealing she looked into the face of her husband,
and caught on his lips a strange, faint smile of mingled pity and exultation. It stung her
like a lash! Instantly she was herself, or rather Zara, a captive, but every inch a queen,
and delivered herself calmly and proudly, though with a little tremble of her past agitation
in her voice,--a thrill of womanly feeling, which felt its way at once to the hearts of her
audience.

The first act, however, afforded her so little scope for acting, that she left the stage unassured
of her own success. There was doubt before and behind the curtain. The critics had given no
certain sign,--the general applause might have been merely an involuntary tribute to youth
and beauty. Actors and actresses hung back,--even the friendly manager was guarded in his congratulations.
But in the second act the débutante put an end to this dubious state of things,--at least,
so far as her audience was concerned. "The Captive Queen" took captive all, save that stern
row of critics,--the indomitable, the incorruptible. Their awful judgment still hung suspended
over her head.

In a scene with Osmyn Zelma first revealed her tragic power. In her fitful tenderness, in the
passionate reproaches which she stormed upon him, in her entreaties and imprecations, she was
the poet's ideal, and more. She dashed into the crude and sketchy character bold strokes of
Nature and illuminative gleams of genius, all her own.

Mr. Bury, as Osmyn, was cold and unsympathetic, avoided the eye of Zara, and was even more
tender than was "set down in the book" to Almeria.

"How well he acts his part!" said to herself the generous Zelma.

"How anxiety for his wife dashes his spirit!" said the charitable audience.

At the close of this act the manager grasped Zelma's hand, and spoke of her success as certain.
She thanked him with an absent air, and gazed about her wistfully. Surely her husband should
have been the first to give her joy. But he did not come forward. She shrank away to her dressing-room,
and waited for him vainly till she knew he was on the stage, where she next met him in the
great prison-scene.

In this scene, some bitterness of feeling--the first sharp pangs of jealousy--gave, unconsciously
to herself, a terrible vitality and reality to her acting. She filled the stage with the electrical
atmosphere of her genius. Waxen Almeria, who was to have gone out as she entered, received
a shock of it, and stood for a moment transfixed. Even Osmyn kindled out of his stony coldness,
and gazed with awe and irrepressible admiration at this new revelation of that strange, profound
creature he had called "wife." She, so late a shy woodland nymph, stealing to his embrace,--now
an angered goddess, blazing before him, calling down upon him the lightnings of Olympus, with
all the world to see him shrink and shrivel into nothingness! And all this power and passion,
overtopping his utmost reach of art, outsoaring his wildest aspirations, he had wooed, fondled,
and protected! At first he was overwhelmed with amazement; he could hardly have been more so,
had a volcano broken out through his hearth-stone; but soon, under the fierce storm of Zara's
taunts and reproaches, a sullen rage took possession of him. He could not separate the actress
from the wife,--and the wife seemed in open, disloyal revolt. Every burst of applause from
the audience was an insult to him; and he felt a mad desire to oppose, to defy them all, to
assert a master's right over that frenzied woman, to grasp her by the arm and drag her from
the stage before their eyes!

This scene closes with a memorable speech:--

    "Vile and ingrate! too late thou shalt repent
    The base injustice thou hast done my love!

Zelma gave these lines as no pre-Siddonian actress had ever given them,--with a certain sublimity
of rage, the ire of an immortal,--and swept off the scene before a wild tumult of applause,
led by the vanquished critics. It followed her, surge on surge, to her dressing-room, whither
she hastily retreated through a crowd of players and green-room habitués.

That sudden tempest shook even the royal box. The King, who a short time before had been observed
to nod, not shaking his "ambrosial locks" in Jove-like approval, but somnolently, started up,
exclaiming, "What! what! what's that?"--and the Queen--took snuff.

In her dressing-room Zelma waited for her husband. "Surely he will come now," she said.

She had already put off the tragedy-queen; she was again the loving wife, yearning for one
proud smile, one tender word, one straining embrace. The tempest outside the curtain still
rolled in upon her, as she sat alone, drooping and sad, a spent thunder-cloud. The sound brought
her no sense of triumph; she only looked around her drearily, like a frightened child, and
called, "Lawrence!"

Instead of him came the manager. She must go before the curtain; the audience would not be denied.

Lawrence led her out,--holding her hot, trembling fingers in his cold, nerveless hand, a moody
frown on his brow, and his lips writhing with a forced smile.

As Zelma bent and smiled in modest acknowledgment of renewed applause, led by royalty itself,--her
aspirations so speedily fulfilled, her genius so early crowned,--even at that supreme moment,
the grief of the woman would have outweighed the triumph of the artist, and saddened all those
plaudits into knell-like sounds, could she have known that the miserable fiends of envy and
jealousy had grasped her husband's heart and torn it out of her possession forever.

In the death-scene, where the full tide of womanly feeling, which has been driven out of Zara's
heart by the volcanic shocks of fierce passions, comes pouring back with whelming force, Zelma
lost none of her power, but won new laurels, bedewed with tears from "eyes unused to weep."

Zara dies by her own hand, clinging to the headless body of King Manuel, believing it to be
Osmyn's. Zelma gave the concluding lines of her part brokenly, in a tone of almost childlike
lamenting, with piteous murmurs and penitent caresses:--

    "Cold, cold!--my veins are icicles and frost!
    Cover us close, or I shall chill his breast,
    And fright him from my arms!--See! see! he slides
    Still farther from me! Look! he hides his face!
    I cannot feel it!--quite beyond my reach!--Ah,
    now he's gone, and all is dark!"

With that last desolate moan of a proud and stormy spirit, sobbing itself into the death-quiet,
a visible shudder crept through the house. Even the King threw himself back in his royal chair
with an uncomfortable sort of "ahem!" as though choking with an emotion of common humanity;
and the Queen--forgot to take snuff.

       *       *       *       *       *

From the night of her triumphant début, the life of the actress ran in the full sunlight of
public favor; but the life of the woman crept away into the shadow,--not of that quiet and
repose so grateful to the true artist, but of domestic discomfort and jealous estrangement.

Nobly self-forgetful always, Zelma, in the first hour of success, feeling, in spite of herself,
the pettiness and egoism of her husband's nature, with a sense of humiliation in which it seemed
her very soul blushed, offered to renounce forever the career on which she had just entered.
Mr. Bury, however, angrily refused to accept the sacrifice, though she pressed it upon him,
at last, as a "peace-offering," on her knees, and weeping like a penitent. "It is too late,"
he said, bitterly. "The deed is done. You are mine no longer,--you belong to the public;--I
wish you joy of your fickle master."

From that time Zelma went her own ways, calm and self-reliant outwardly, but inwardly tortured
with a host of womanly griefs and regrets, a helpless sense of wrong and desolation. She flew
to her beautiful art for consolation, flinging herself, with a sort of desperate abandonment,
out of her own life of monotonous misery into the varied sorrows of the characters she personated.
For her the cup of fame was not mantling with the wine of delight which reddens the lips and
"maketh glad the heart." The costly pearl she had dissolved in it had not sweetened the draught;
but it was intoxicating, and she drank it with feverish avidity.

But for Lawrence Bury, his powers flagged and failed in the unnatural rivalship; his acting
grew more and more cold and mechanical. He became more than ever subject to moods and caprices,
and rapidly lost favor with the public, till at last he was regarded only as the husband of
the popular actress,--then, merely tolerated for her sake. He fell, or rather flung himself,
into a life of reckless dissipation and profligacy, and sunk so low that he scrupled not to
accept from his wife, and squander on base pleasures, money won by the genius for which he
hated her. Many were the nights when Zelma returned from the playhouse to her cheerless lodgings,
exhausted, dispirited, and alone, to walk her chamber till the morning, wrestling with real
terrors and sorrows, the homely distresses of the heart, hard, absolute, unrelieved,--to which
the tragic agonies she had been representing seemed but child's play.

At length, finding himself at the lowest ebb of theatrical favor, and hating horribly the scene
of his humiliating defeat, Mr. Bury resolved to return to his old strolling life in the provinces.
Making at the same moment the first announcement of his going and his hurried adieux to Zelma,
who heard his last cold words in dumb dismay, with little show of emotion, but with heavy grief
and dread presentiments at her heart, he departed. He was accompanied by the fair actress with
whom he played first parts at Arden,--but now, green-room gossip said, not in a merely professional
association. This story was brought to Zelma; but her bitter cup was full without it. With
a noble blindness, the fanaticism of wifely faith, she rejected it utterly. "He is weak, misguided,
mad," she said, "but not so basely false as that. He must run his wild, wretched course awhile
longer,--it seems necessary for him; but he will return at last,--surely he will,--sorrowful,
repentant, 'in his right mind,' himself and mine once more. He cannot weary out God's patience
and my love."

After the first shock of her desertion was past, Zelma was conscious of a sense of relief from
a weight of daily recurring care and humiliation, the torture of an unloving presence, chill
and ungenial as arctic sunlight. Even in the cold blank of his absence there was something
grateful to her bruised heart, like the balm of darkness to suffering eyes. Her art was now
all in all to her,--the strong-winged passion, which lifted her out of herself and her sorrows.
She was studying Juliet for the first time. She had been playing for more than a year before
she could be prevailed upon to attempt a Shakspearian character, restrained by a profound modesty
from exercising her crude powers upon one of those grand creations.

When, at length, she made choice of Juliet, what study was hers!--how reverent! how loving!
how glad!--the perfect service of the spirit! She shut out the world of London from her sight,
from her thoughts, till it seemed lost in one of its own fogs. The air, the sky, the passion,
the poetry of Italy were above and around her. Again she revelled in that wondrous garden of
love and poesy, with a background of graves, solemnizing joy. Now her fancy flitted, on swift,
unresting wing, from beauty to beauty,--now settled, bee-like, on some rich, half-hidden thought,
and hung upon it, sucking out its most sweet and secret heart of meaning. She steeped her soul
in the delicious romance, the summer warmth, the moonlight, the sighs and tears of the play.
She went from the closet to the stage, not brain-weary and pale with thought, but fresh, tender,
and virginal,--not like one who had committed the part of Juliet, but one whom Juliet possessed
in every part. She seemed to bear about her an atmosphere of poetry and love, the subtile spirit
of that marvellous play. There was no air of study, not the faintest taint of the midnight
oil;--like a gatherer of roses from some garden of Cashmere, or a peasant-girl from the vintage,
she brought only odors from her toil,--the sweets of the fancy, a flavor of the passion she
had made her own.

On her first night in this play, Zelma was startled by recognizing among the audience the once
familiar faces of her uncle Roger, her cousin Bessie, and Sir Harry Willerton. They had all
come up to London to draw up the papers and purchase the trousseau for the wedding, which would
have taken place a year sooner, but for the death of Bessie's mother.

Squire Burleigh had been entrapped by his daughter and her lover into coming to the play,--he
being in utter ignorance as to whom he was to see in the part of Juliet. When he recognized
his niece in the ball-room scene, he was shocked, and even angry. He started up, impetuously,
to leave the house; and it was only by the united entreaties of Bessie and Sir Harry that he
was persuaded to stay. As the play went on, however, his sympathies became enlisted, in spite
of his prejudices. Gradually his heart melted toward the fair offender, and irrepressible tears
of admiration and pity welled up to his kindly blue eyes. He watched the progress of the drama
with an almost breathless interest while she was before him, but grew listless and indifferent
whenever she left the stage. The passion of Romeo, the philosophy of the Friar, the quaint
garrulousness of the Nurse, the trenchant wit of Mercutio were alike without charm for him.

But though thus lost in the fortunes and sorrows of the heroine of the play, the dramatic illusion
was far from complete for him. It was not Juliet,--it was Zelma, the wild, misguided, lost,
but still beloved child of his poor brother; and in his bewildered brain her sad story was
strangely complicated with that of the hapless girl of Verona. When she swallowed the sleeping-draught,
he shrank and shuddered at the horrible pictures conjured up by her frenzied fancy; and in
the last woful scene, he forgot himself, the play, the audience, everything but her, the forlorn
gypsy child, the shy and lonely little girl whom long years ago he had taken on his knee, and
smoothed down her tangled black hair, as he might have smoothed the plumage of an eaglet, struggling
and palpitating under his hand, and glancing up sideways, with fierce and frightened eyes,--and
now, when he saw her about to plunge the cruel blade into her breast, he leaped to his feet
and electrified the house by calling out, in a tone of agonized entreaty,--"Don't, Zelle! for
God's sake, don't! Leave this, and come home with us,--home to the Grange!"

It was a great proof of Mrs. Bury's presence of mind and command over her emotions, that she
was not visibly discomposed by this strange and touching appeal, or by the laughter and applause
it called forth, but finished her sad part, and was Juliet to the last.

When, obeying the stormy summons of the audience, the lovers arose from the dead, and glided
ghost-like before the curtain, Zelma, really pale with the passion and woe of her part, glanced
eagerly at the box in which she had beheld her friends;--it was empty. The worthy Squire, overcome
with confusion at the exposure he had made of his weakness and simplicity, had hurried from
the theatre, willingly accompanied by his daughter and Sir Harry.

On the following day, sweet Bessie Burleigh, with the consent, at the request even, of her
father, sought out her famous cousin, bearing terms of reconciliation and proffers of renewed
affection.

The actress was alone. She had just risen from her late breakfast, and was in a morning costume,--careless,
but not untidy. She looked languid and jaded; the beautiful light of young love, which the
night before had shone with a soft, lambent flame in every glance, seemed to have burned itself
out in her hollow eyes, or to have been quenched in tears.

She flung herself on her cousin's breast with a laugh of pure joy and a child's quick impulse
of lovingness; but almost immediately drew herself back, as with a sudden sense of having leaned
across a chasm in the embrace. But Bessie, guessing her feeling, clung about her very tenderly,
calling her pet names, smoothing her hair and kissing her wan cheek till she almost kissed
back its faded roses. And infinite good she did poor Zelma.

Bessie--dear, simple heart!--was no diplomatist; she did not creep stealthily toward her object,
but dashed at it at once.

"I am come, dearest Zelle, to win you home," she said. "You cannot think how lonely it is at
the Grange, now that dear mamma is gone; and by-and-by it will be yet more lonely,--at least,
for poor papa. He loves you still, though he was angry with you at first,--and he longs to
have you come back, and to make it all up with you. Oh, I am sure, you must be weary of this
life,--or rather, this mockery of life, this prolonged fever dream, this playing with passion
and pain! It is killing you! Why, you look worn and anxious and sad as death by daylight, though
you do bloom out strangely bright and beautiful on the stage. So, dear, come into the country,
and rest and renew your life."

Zelma opened her superb eyes in amazement, and her cheek kindled with a little flush of displeasure;
yet she answered playfully,--"What! would you resolve 'the new star of the drama' into nebulousness
and nothingness again? Remember my art, sweet Coz; I am a priestess sworn to its altar."

"But, surely," replied Bessie, ingenuously, "you will not live on thus alone, unprotected,
a mark for suspicion and calumny; for they say--they say that your husband has deserted you."

"Mr. Bury is absent, fulfilling a professional engagement. I shall await his return here,"
replied Zelma, haughtily.

Bessie blushed deeply and was silent. So, too, was the actress, for some moments; then, softened
almost to tears, half closing her eyes, and letting her fancy float away like thistle-down
over town and country, upland, valley, and moor, she said softly,--"Dear Burleigh Grange, how
lovely it must be now! What a verdurous twilight reigns under the old elms of the avenue!--in
what a passion of bloom the roses are unfolding to the sun, these warm May-days! How the honeysuckles
drip with sweet dews! how thickly the shed hawthorn-blossoms lie on the grass of the long lane,
rolling in little drifts before the wind! And the birds,--do the same birds come back to nest
in their old places about the Grange, I wonder?"

"Yes," answered Bessie, smiling; "I think all the birds have come back, save one, the dearest
of them all, who fled away in the night-time. Her nest is empty still. Oh, Zelle, do you remember
our pleasant little chamber in the turret? I could not stay there when you were gone. It is
the stillest, loneliest place in all the house now. Even your pet hound refuses to enter it."

"Now, my Cousin, you are really cruel," said Zelma, the tears at last forcing their way through
her reluctant eyelids. "When I left Burleigh Grange, I went like Eve from Paradise,--forever."

"Ah, but Cousin dear, there is no terrible angel with a flaming sword guarding the gates of
the Grange against you."

"Yes, the angel of its peace and ancient honor," said the actress; then added, pleasantly,
"and he is backed by a mighty ogre, Respectability. No, no, Bessie, I can never go back to
my old home, or my old self; it is quite impossible. But you and my uncle are very good to
ask me. Heaven bless you for that! And, dear, when you are Lady Willerton, a proud wife, and,
if God please, a happy mother, put me away from your thoughts, if I trouble you. Rest in the
safe haven of home, anchored in content, and do not vex yourself about the poor waif afloat
on wild, unknown seas. It is not worth while."

So Bessie Burleigh was obliged to abandon her dear, impracticable plan; and the cousins parted
forever, though neither thought or meant it then. Bessie returned to Arden, married the master
of Willerton Hall, and slid into the easy grooves of a happy, luxurious country-life; while
Zelma rode for a few proud years on the topmost swell of popular favor,--then suddenly passed
away beyond the horizon of London life, and so, as it were, out of the world.

One dreary November night, after having revealed new powers and won new honors by her first
personation of Belvedera, Zelma went home to find on her table a brief, business-like letter
from the manager of a theatre at Walton, a town in the North, stating that Mr. Lawrence Bury
had died suddenly at that place of a violent, inflammatory disease, brought on, it was to be
feared, by some excesses to which he had been addicted. The theatrical wardrobe of the deceased
(of small value) had been retained in payment for expenses of illness and burial; his private
papers were at the disposal of the widow. Deceased had been buried in the parish church-yard
of Walton. This was all.

Zelma had abruptly dismissed her maid, that she might read quite unobserved a letter which
she suspected brought news from her husband; so she was quite alone throughout that fearful
night. What fierce, face-to-face wrestlings with grief and remorse were hers! What sweet, torturing
memories of love, of estrangement, of loss! What visions of him, torn with the agonies, wild
with the terrors of death, calling her name in vain imploring or with angry imprecations!--of
him, so young, so sinful, dragged struggling toward the abyss of mystery and night, wrenched,
as it were, out of life, with all its passions hot at his heart!

Hour after hour she sat at her table, grasping the fatal letter, still as death, and all but
as cold. She yet wore the last dress of Belvedera, and was half enveloped by the black cloud
of her dishevelled hair; but the simulated frenzy, which so late had drawn shuddering sighs
from a thousand hearts, was succeeded by a silent, stony despair, infinitely more terrible.
A sense of hopeless desolation and abandonment settled upon her soul; the distances of universes
seemed to separate her from the dead. But to this suddenly succeeded a chill, awful sense of
a presence, wrapped in silence and mystery, melting through all material barriers, treading
on the impalpable air, not "looking ancient kindness on her pain," but lowering amid the shadows
of her chamber, stern, perturbed, unreconciled. All these lonely horrors, these wild griefs,
unrelieved by human sympathy or companionship, by even the unconscious comfort which flows
in the breathing of a near sleeper, crowded and pressed upon her brain, and seemed to touch
her veins with frost and fire.

For long weeks, Zelma lay ill, with a slow, baffling fever. Her mind, torn from its moorings,
went wandering, wandering, over a vast sea of troubled dreams,--now creeping on through weary
stretches of calm, now plunging into the heart of tempests and tossed upon mountainous surges,
now touching momently at islands of light, now wrecked upon black, desert shores.

All was strange, vague, and terrible, at first; but gradually there stole back upon her her
own life of womanhood and Art,--its scenes and changes, its struggles, temptations, and triumphs,
its brief joy and long sorrow, all shaken and confused together, but still familiar. Now the
faces of her audiences seemed to throng upon her, packing her room from floor to ceiling, darkening
the light, sucking up all the air, and again piercing her through and through with their cold,
merciless gaze. Now the characters she had personated grouped themselves around her bed, all
distinct, yet duplicates and multiplications of herself, mocking her with her own voice, and
glaring at her with her own eyes. Now pleasant summer-scenes at Burleigh Grange brightened
the dull walls, and a memory of the long lane in the white prime of its hawthorn bloom flowed
like a river of fragrance through her chamber. Then there strode in upon her a form of beauty
and terror, and held her by the passion and gloom of his eye,--and with him crept in a chill
and heavy air, like an exhalation from the rank turf of neglected graves.

       *       *       *       *       *

Zelma recovered from this illness, if it could be called a recovery, to a state of only tolerable
physical health, and a condition of pitiable mental apathy and languor. She turned with a half-weary,
half-petulant distaste from her former pursuits and pleasures, and abandoned her profession
with a sort of terror,--feeling that its mockery of sorrows, such as had fallen so crushingly
on her unchastened heart, would madden her utterly. But neither could she endure again the
constraint and conventionalities of English private life; she had died to her art, and she
glided, like a phantom, out of her country, and out of the thoughts of the public, in whose
breath she had lived, for whose pleasure she had toiled, often from the hidden force of her
own sorrows, the elements of all tragedy seething in her secret heart.

Year after year she lived a wandering, out-of-the-way life on the Continent. It was said that
she went to Spain, sought out her mother's wild kindred, and dwelt with them, making their
life her life, their ways her ways, shrinking neither from sun-glare nor tempest, privation
nor peril. But, at length, tired of wandering and satiated with adventure, she flung off the
Zincala, returned to England, and even returned, forsworn, to her art, as all do, or long to
do, who have once embraced it from a genuine passion.

She made no effort to obtain an engagement at Covent Garden; for her, that stage was haunted
by a presence more gloomy than Hamlet, more dreadful than the Ghost. Nor did she seek to tread,
with her free, unpractised step, the classic boards of Drury Lane,--where Garrick, the Grand
Monarque of the Drama, though now toward the end of his reign, ruled with jealous, despotic
sway,--but modestly and quietly appeared at a minor theatre, seeming, to such play-goers as
remembered her brief, brilliant career and sudden disappearance, like the Muse of Tragedy returned
from the shades.

She was kindly received, both for her own sake, and because of the pleasant memories which
the sight of her, pale, slender, and sad-eyed, yet beautiful still, revived. Those who had
once sworn by her swore by her still, and were loath to admit even to themselves that her early
style of acting--easy, flowing, impulsive, the natural translation in action of a strong and
imaginative nature--must remain what, in the long absence of the actress, it had become, a
beautiful tradition of the stage,--that her present personations were wanting in force and
spontaneity,--that they were efforts, rather than inspirations,--were marked by a weary tension
of thought,--were careful, but not composed, roughened by unsteady strokes of genius, freshly
furrowed with labor.

Mrs. Bury made a grave mistake in choosing for her second début her great part of Juliet; for
she had outlived the possibility of playing it as she played it at that period of her life
when her soul readily melted in the divine glow of youthful passion and flowed into the character,
taking its perfect shape, rounded and smooth and fair. Through long years of sorrow and unrest,
she had now to toil back to that golden time,--and there was a sort of sharpness and haggardness
about her acting, a singular tone of weariness, broken by starts and bursts of almost preternatural
power. Except in scenes and sentiments of pathos, where she had lost nothing, the last, fine,
evanishing tints, the delicate aroma of the character, were wanting in her personation. It
was touched with autumnal shadows,--it was comparatively hard and dry, not from any inartistic
misapprehension of the poet's ideal, but because the fountain of youth in Zelma's own soul
ran low, and was choked by the dead violets which once sweetened its waters.

She felt all this bitterly that night, ere the play was over; and though her audience generously
applauded and old friends congratulated her, she never played Juliet again.

Yet, even in the darker and sterner parts, in which she was once so famous, she was hardly
more successful now. In losing her bloom and youthful fulness of form, she had not gained that
statuesque repose, or that refined essence of physical power and energy, which sometimes belongs
to slenderness and pallor. She was often strangely agitated and unnerved when the occasion
called most for calm, sustained power,--at times, glancing around wildly and piteously, like
a haunted creature. Her passion was fitful and strained,--the fire of rage flickered in her
eye, her relaxed lips quivered out curses, her hand shook with the dagger and spilled the poison.
Her sorrows, real and imaginary, seemed to have broken her spirit with her heart.

But in anything weird and supernatural, awful with vague, unearthly terrors, she was greater
than ever. Whenever, in her part of Lady Macbeth, she came to the sleep-walking scene, that
shadowy neutral ground between death and life, where the perturbed, burdened spirit moans out
its secret agony, she gave startling token of the genius which had electrified and awed her
audiences of old. A solemn stillness pervaded the house; every eye followed the ghost-like
gliding of her form, every ear hung upon the voice whose tones could sound the most mysterious
and awful depths of human grief and despair.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was during the first season of her reappearance that Mrs. Bury went to Drury Lane, on an
off-night, to witness one of the latest efforts of Garrick as Richard the Third. He was, as
usual, terribly great in the part; but, in spite of his overwhelming power, Zelma found herself
watching the Lady Anne of the night with a strange, fascinated interest. This part, of too
secondary and negative a character for the display of high dramatic powers, even in an actress
who should be perfect mistress of herself, was borne by a young and beautiful woman, new to
the London stage, though of some provincial reputation, who on this occasion was distressingly
nervous and ill-assured. She had to contend not only with stage-fright, but Garrick-fright.
"She met Roscius in all his terrors," and shrank from the encounter. The fierce lightnings
of his dreadful eyes seemed to shrivel and paralyze her; even his demoniac cunning and persuasiveness
filled her with mortal fear. Her voice shook with a pathetic tremor, became hoarse and almost
inaudible; her eyes sank, or wandered wildly; her brow was bathed with the sweat of a secret
agony; she might have given way utterly under the paralyzing spell, had not some sudden inspiration
of genius or love, a prophetic thrill of power, or a memory of her unwearied babe, come to
nerve, to upbear her. She roused, and went through her part with some flickering flashes of
spirit, and through all her painful embarrassment was stately and graceful by the regal necessity
of her beauty. The event was not success,--was but a shade better than utter failure; and when,
soon after, that beautiful woman dropped out of London dramatic life, few were they who missed
her enough to ask whither she had gone.

But Zelma, whose sad, searching eyes saw deeper than the eyes of critics, recognized from the
first her grand, long-sought ideal in the fair unknown, whose name had appeared on the play-bills
in small, deprecating type, under the overwhelming capitals of "MR. GARRICK"--"Mrs. Siddons."
She looked upon that frightened and fragile woman with prophetic reverence and noble admiration:
and as she walked her lonely chamber that night, she said to herself, somewhat sadly, but not
bitterly,--"The true light of the English drama has arisen at last. 'Out, out, brief candle!'"

       *       *       *       *       *

Season after season, year after year, Zelma continued to play in London, but never again with
the fame, the homage, the flatteries and triumphs of a great actress. All these she saw at
last accorded to her noble rival. Mrs. Bury had shone very acceptably in a doubtful dramatic
period,--first as an inspired, impassioned enthusiast, and after as a conscientious artist,
subdued and saddened, yet always careful and earnest; but, like many another lesser light,
she was destined to be lost sight of in the long, splendid day of the Kembles.

Yet once again the spirit of unrest, the nomadic instinct, came back upon Zelma Bury,--haunted
her heart and stirred in her blood till she could resist no longer, but, joining a company
for a provincial tour, left London.

The health of the actress had been long declining, under the almost unsuspected attacks of
a slow, insidious disease. She was more weak and ill than she would confess, even to herself;
she wanted change, she said, only change. She never dreamed of rest. Week after week she travelled,--never
tarrying long enough In one place to weary of it,--the peaceful sights and sounds of rural
life tranquillizing and refreshing her soul, as the clear expanse of its sky, the green of
its woods and parks, the daisied swell of its downs refreshed and soothed her eye, tired of
striking forever against dull brick walls and struggling with smoke and fog.

Then May came round,--the haunted month of all the year for her. The hawthorn-hedges burst
into flower,--the high-ways and by-paths and lanes became Milky Ways of bloom, and all England
was once more veined with fragrance.

They were in the North, when one morning Zelma was startled by hearing the manager say that
the next night they should play at Walton. It was there that Lawrence Bury died; it was there
he slept, in the stranger's unvisited grave. She would seek out that grave and sink on it,
as on the breast of one beloved, though long estranged. It would cool the dull, ceaseless fever
of her heart to press it against the cold mound, and to whisper into the rank grass her faithful
remembrance, her forgiveness, her unconquerable love.

But it was late when the players reached Walton; and, after the necessary arrangements for
the evening were concluded, Zelma found that she had no time for a pilgrimage to the parish
churchyard. She could see it from a window of her lodgings;--it was high-walled, dark and damp,
crowded with quaint, mossy tomb-stones, and brooded over by immemorial yews. In the deepening,
misty twilight, there was something awful in the spot. It was easy to fancy unquiet spectres
lurking in its gloomy shadows, waiting for the night Yet Zelma's heart yearned toward it, and
she murmured softly, as she turned away, "Wait for me, love!"

The play, on this night, was "The Fair Penitent." In the character of Calista Mrs. Bury had
always been accounted great, though it was distasteful to her. Indeed, for the entire play
she expressed only contempt and aversion; yet she played her part in it faithfully and carefully,
as she performed all professional tasks.

In reading this tragedy now, one is at a loss to understand how such trash could have been
tolerated at the very time of the revival of a pure dramatic literature,--how such an unsavored
broth of sentiment, such a meagre hash of heroics, could have been relished, even when served
by Kembles, after the rich, varied, Olympian banquets of Shakspeare.

The argument is briefly this:--

Calista, daughter of Sciolto, is betrothed to Altamount, a young lord, favored by Sciolto.
Altamount has a friend, Horatio, and an enemy, Lothario, secretly the lover and seducer of
Calista, whose dishonor is discovered by Horatio, shortly after her marriage with Altamount,
to whom he reveals it. Calista denies the charge, with fierce indignation and scorn; and the
young husband believes her and discredits his friend. But the fourth act brings the guilt of
Calista and the villany of Lothario fully to light. Lothario is killed by the injured husband,
Sciolto goes mad with shame and rage, and Calista falls into a state of despair and penitence.

The fifth act opens with Sciolto's elaborate preparations for vengeance on his daughter. She
examines the cross-bones curiously, lays her hand on the skull, soliloquizing upon mortality,
somewhat in the strain of Hamlet; then peers into the coffin of Lothario, beholds his pale
visage, "grim with clotted blood," and the stern, unwinking stare of his dead eyes. Sciolto
enters and bids her prepare to die; but while she stands meek and unresisting before him, his
heart fails him; he rushes out, and is shortly after killed by Lothario's faction. Calista
then dies by her own hand, leaving Altamount desperate and despairing.

Poor Calista is neither a lovely nor a lofty character; but there is something almost grand
in her fierce pride, in her defiant hauteur, in her mighty struggle with shame. Mrs. Siddons
made the part terribly impressive. Mrs. Bury softened it somewhat, giving it a womanly dignity
and pathos that would seem foreign and almost impossible to the character.

       *       *       *       *       *

When Zelma entered her dressing-room, on that first night at Walton, she found on her table
a small spray of hawthorn-blossoms.

"How came these flowers here?" she asked, in a hurried, startled tone.

"I placed them there," replied her little maid, Susan, half-frightened by the strange agitation
of her mistress. "I plucked the sprig in our landlady's garden; for I remembered that you loved
hawthorn-blossoms, and used often to buy them in Covent-Garden Market."

"Ah, yes; thank you, Susan. I do indeed love them, and I will wear them to-night."

As she said this, she placed the flowers in her bosom,--but, the little maid noticed, not as
an ornament, but quite out of sight, where her close bodice would crush them against her heart.

During the first acts of the play, Zelma was languid, absent, and more unequal than usual.
A strange sense of evil, a vague foreboding, haunted her. It was in vain that she said to herself,
"What have I, a lonely, disappointed woman, loveless and joyless, to fear of misfortune more,--since
death itself were welcome as change, and doubly welcome as rest?" The nameless fear still clung
to her, sending cold thrills along her veins, fiercely grasping and holding her palpitating heart.

When, in the last act, reclining on her sombre couch, she waited through the playing of the
"soft music," there came to her a little season of respite and calm. Tender thoughts, and sweet,
wild fancies of other days revisited her. The wilted hawthorn-blossoms in her bosom seemed
to revive and to pour forth volumes of fragrance, which enveloped her like an atmosphere; and
as she rose and advanced slowly toward the foot-lights, winking dimly like funeral lamps amid
the gloom of the scene, it strangely seemed to her that she was going down the long, sweet
lane of Burleigh Grange. The magic of that perfume, and something of kindred sweetness in the
sad, wailing music, brought old times and scenes before her with preternatural distinctness.
Then she became conscious of a something making still darker and deeper the gloomy shadows
cast by the black hangings of the scene,--a presence, not palpable or visible to the senses,
but terribly real to the finer perceptions of the spirit,--a presence unearthly, yet familiar
and commanding, persistent, resistless, unappeasable,--moving as she moved, pausing as she
paused, clutching at her hands, and searching after her eyes. The air about her seemed heavy
with a brooding horror which sought to resolve itself into shape,--the dread mystery of life
in death waiting to be revealed. Her own soul seemed groping and beating against the veil which
hides the unseen; she gasped, she trembled, and great drops, like the distillation of the last
mortal anguish, burst from her forehead.

She was roused by a murmur of applause from the audience. She was acting so well! Nerving herself
by an almost superhuman effort, her phantom-haunted soul standing at bay, she approached the
table, and began, in a voice but slightly broken, the reading of her melancholy soliloquy.
But, as she laid her hand on the skull, she gave a wild start of horror,--not at the touch
of the cold, smooth bone, nor at the blank, black stare of the eyeless sockets, but at finding
beneath her hand a mass of soft, curling hair, damp, as with night-dew!--at beholding eyes
with "speculation" in them,--ay, with human passions, luminous and full,--eyes that now yearned
with love, now burned with hate,--ah, God! the eyes of Lawrence Bury!

With a shrill, frenzied shriek, Zelma sprang back and stood for a moment shuddering and crouching
in a mute agony of fear. Then she burst into wild cries of grief and passionate entreaty, stretching
her tremulous hands into the void air, in piteous imploring.

"She has gone mad! Take her away!" shouted the excited audience; but before any one could reach
her, she had fallen on the stage in strong convulsions.

The actors raised her and bore her out; and as they did so, a little stream of blood was seen
to bubble from her lips. A medical man, who happened to be present, having proffered his services,
was hurried behind the scenes to where the sufferer lay, on a rude couch in the green-room,
surrounded by the frightened players, and wept over by her faithful little maid.

The audience lingered awhile within sound of the fitful, frenzied cries of the dying actress,
and then dispersed in dismay and confusion.

Zelma remained for some hours convulsed and delirious; but toward morning she sank into a deep,
swoon-like sleep of utter exhaustion. She awoke from this, quite sane and calm, but marble-white
and cold,--the work of death all done, it seemed, save the dashing out of the sad, wild light
yet burning in her sunken eyes. But the bright red blood no longer oozed from her lips, and
they told her she was better. She gave no heed to the assurance, but, somewhat in her old,
quick, decisive way, called for the manager. Scarcely had he reached her side, when she began
to question him eagerly, though in hoarse, failing tones, in regard to the skull used in the
play of the preceding night. The manager had procured it of the sexton, he said, and knew nothing
more of it.

She sent for the sexton. He came,--a man "of the earth, earthy,"--a man with a grave-ward stoop
and a strange uneven gait, caught in forty years' stumbling over mounds. A smell of turf and
mould, an odor of mortality, went before him.

He approached the couch of the actress, and looked down upon her with a curious, professional
look, as though he were peering into a face newly coffined or freshly exhumed; but when Zelma
fixed her live eyes upon him, angry and threatening, and asked, in abrupt, yet solemn tones,
"Whose was that skull you brought for me last night?" he fell back with an exclamation of surprise
and terror. As soon as he could collect himself sufficiently, he replied, that, to the best
of his knowledge, the skull had belonged to a poor play-actor, who had died in the parish some
sixteen or, it might be, eighteen years before; and compelled by the merciless inquisition
of those eyes, fixed and stern, though dilating with horror, he added, that, if his memory
served him well, the player's name was Bury.

A strong shudder shivered through the poor woman's frame at this confirmation of the awful
revealment of the previous night; but she replied calmly, though with added sternness,--"He
was my husband. How dared you disturb his bones? Are you a ghoul, that you burrow among graves
and steal from the dead?"

The poor man eagerly denied being anything so inhuman. The skull had rolled into a grave he
had been digging by the side of the almost forgotten grave of the poor player; and, as the
manager had bespoken one for the play, he had thought it no harm to furnish him this. But he
would put it back carefully into its place that very day.

"See that you do it, man, if you value the repose of your own soul!" said Zelma, with an awful
impressiveness, raising herself on one elbow and looking him out of the room.

When he was gone, she sunk back and murmured, partly to herself, partly to her little maid,
who wept through all, the more that she did not understand,--"I knew it was so; it was needless
to ask. Well, 'tis well; he will forgive me, now that I come when he calls me, accomplishing
to the utmost my vow. He will make peace with me, when I take my old place at his side,--when
my head shall lie as low as his,--when he sees that all the laurels have dropped away,--when
he sees the sorrow shining through the dark of my hair in rifts of silver."

After a little time she grew restless, and would return to her lodgings.

As the doctor and her attendant were about placing her in a sedan-chair to bear her away, a
strange desire seized her to behold the theatre and tread the boards once more. They conducted
her to the centre of the stage, and seated her on the black couch of Calista. There they left
her quite alone for a while, and stood back where they could observe without disturbing her.
They saw her gaze about her dreamily and mournfully; then she seemed to be recalling and reciting
some favorite part. To their surprise, the tones of her voice were clear and resonant once
more; and when she had ceased speaking, she rose and walked toward them, slowly, but firmly,
turning once or twice to bow proudly and solemnly to an invisible audience. Just before she
reached them, she suddenly pressed her hand on her heart, and the next instant felt forward
into the arms of her maid. The young girl could not support the weight--the dead weight, and
sank with it to the floor. Zelma had made her last exit.

THE MURDER OF THE INNOCENTS.

A SECOND EPISTLE TO DOLOROSUS.

So you are already mending, my dear fellow? Can it be that my modest epistle has done so much
service? Are you like those invalids in Central Africa, who, when the medicine itself is not
accessible, straightway swallow the written prescription as a substitute, inwardly digest it,
and recover? No,--I think you have tested the actual materia medica recommended. I hear of
you from all directions, walking up hills in the mornings and down hills in the afternoons,
skimming round in wherries like a rather unsteady water-spider, blistering your hands upon
gymnastic bars, receiving severe contusions on your nose from cricket-balls, shaking up and
down on hard-trotting horses, and making the most startling innovations in respect to eating,
sleeping, and bathing. Like all our countrymen, you are plunging from one extreme to the other.
Undoubtedly, you will soon make yourself sick again; but your present extreme is the safer
of the two. Time works many miracles; it has made Louis Napoleon espouse the cause of liberty,
and it may yet make you reasonable.

After all, that advice of mine, which is thought to have benefited you so greatly, was simply
that which Dr. Abernethy used to give his patients: "Don't come to me,--go buy a skipping-rope."
If you can only guard against excesses, and keep the skipping-rope in operation, there are
yet hopes for you. Only remember that it is equally important to preserve health as to attain
it, and it needs much the same regimen. Do not be like that Lord Russell in Spence's Anecdotes,
who only went hunting for the sake of an appetite, and who, the moment he felt any sensation
of vitality in the epigastrium, used to turn short round, exclaiming, "I have found it!" and
ride home from the finest chase. It was the same Lord Russell, by the way, who, when he met
a beggar and was implored to give him something, because he was almost famished with hunger,
called him a happy dog, and envied him too much to relieve him. From some recent remarks of
your boarding-house hostess, my friend, I am led to suppose that you are now almost as well
off, in point of appetite, as if you were a beggar; and I wish to keep you so.

How much the spirits rise with health! A family of children is a very different sight to a
healthy man and to a dyspeptic. What pleasure you now take in yours! You are going to live
more in their manner and for their sakes, henceforward, you tell me. You are to enter upon
business again, but in a more moderate way; you are to live in a pleasant little suburban cottage,
with fresh air, a horse-railroad, and good schools. For I am startled to find that your interest
In your offspring, like that of most American parents, culminates in the school-room. This
important matter you have neglected long enough, you think, foolishly absorbed in making money
for them. Now they shall have money enough, to be sure, but wisdom in plenty. Angelina shall
walk in silk attire, and knowledge have to spare. To which school shall you send her? you ask
me, with something of the old careworn expression, pulling six different prospectuses from
your pocket. Put them away, Dolorosus; I know the needs of Angelina, and I can answer instantly.
Send the girl, for the present at least, to that school whose daily hours of session are the
shortest, and whose recess-times and vacations are of the most formidable length.

No, anxious parent, I am not joking. I am more anxious for your children than you are. On the
faith of an ex-teacher and ex-school-committee- man,--for what respectable middle-aged American
man but has passed through both these spheres of uncomfortable usefulness?--I am terribly in
earnest. Upon this point asserted,--that the merit of an American school, at least so far as
Angelina is concerned, is in inverse ratio to the time given to study,--I will lay down incontrovertible
propositions. You may wonder, Dolorosus, what Sir Walter Scott has to do with Angelina, except
to supply her with novel-reading, and with passages for impassioned recitation, at the twilight
hour, from the "Lady of the Lake." But that same Scott has left one remark on record which
may yet save the lives and reasons of greater men than himself, more gifted women (if that
were possible) than Angelina, if we can only accept it with the deference to which that same
healthiness of his entitles it. This he said in the fulness of his magnificent strength, and
when he was producing, with astounding rapidity, those pages of delight over which every new
generation still hangs enchanted.

He did not mean, of course, that this was the maximum of possible mental labor, but only of
wise and desirable labor. In later life, driven by terrible pecuniary involvements, he himself
worked far more than this. Southey, his contemporary, worked far more,--writing, in 1814, "I
cannot get through more than at present, unless I give up sleep, or the little exercise I take
(walking a mile and back, after breakfast); and, that hour excepted, and my meals, (barely
the meals, for I remain not one minute after them,) the pen or the book is always in my hand."
Our own time and country afford a yet more astonishing instance. Theodore Parker, to my certain
knowledge, has often spent in his study from twelve to seventeen hours daily, for weeks together.
But the result in all these cases has sadly proved the supremacy of the laws which were defied;
and the nobler the victim, the more tremendous the warning retribution.

Let us return, then, from the practice of Scott's ruined days to the principles of his sound ones.

It is vain to suggest, at this point, that the application of Scott's estimate is not fair,
because the mental labor of our schools is different in quality from his, and therefore less
exhausting. It differs only in being more exhausting. To the robust and affluent mind of the
novelist, composition was not, of itself, exceedingly fatiguing; we know this from his own
testimony; he was able, moreover, to select his own subject, keep his own hours, and arrange
all his own conditions of labor. And on the other hand, when we consider what energy and genius
have for years been brought to bear upon the perfecting of our educational methods,--how thoroughly
our best schools are now graded and systematized, until each day's lessons become a Procrustes-bed
to which all must fit themselves,--how stimulating the apparatus of prizes and applauses, how
crushing the penalties of reproof and degradation,--when we reflect, that it is the ideal of
every school, that the whole faculties of every scholar should be concentrated upon every lesson
and every recitation from beginning to end, and that anything short of this is considered partial
failure,--it is not exaggeration to say, that the daily tension of brain demanded of children
in our best schools is altogether severer, while it lasts, than that upon which Scott based
his estimate. Most of the intelligent men in the profession would probably admit, with Scott,
that even that is too large an allowance in maturity for vigorous work of the brain.

Taking, then, five hours as the reasonable daily limit of mental effort for children of eight
to fourteen years, and one hour as the longest time of continuous confinement, (it was a standing
rule of the Jesuits, by the way, that no pupil should study more than two hours without relaxation,)
the important question now recurs, To what school shall we send Angelina?

Shall we send her, for instance, to Dothegirls' Hall? At that seminary of useful knowledge,
I find by careful inquiry that the daily performance is as follows, at least in summer. The
pupils rise at or before five, A.M.; at any rate, they study from five to seven, two hours.
From seven to eight they breakfast. From eight to two they are in the schoolroom, six consecutive
hours. From two to three they dine. From three to five they are "allowed" to walk or take other
exercise,--that is, if it is pleasant weather, and if they feel the spirit for it, and if the
time is not all used up in sewing, writing letters, school politics, and all the small miscellaneous
duties of existence, for which no other moment is provided during day or night. From five to
six they study; from six to seven comes the tea-table; from seven to nine study again; then
bed and (at least for the stupid ones) sleep.

Eleven solid hours of study each day, Dolorosus! Eight for sleep, three for meals, two during
which out-door exercise is "allowed." There is no mistake about this statement; I wish there
were. I have not imagined it; who could have done so, short of Milton and Dante, who were versed
in the exploration of kindred regions of torment? But as I cannot expect the general public
to believe the statement, even if you do,--and as this letter, like my previous one, may accidentally
find its way into print,--and as I cannot refer to those who have personally attended the school,
since they probably die off too fast to be summoned as witnesses,--I will come down to a rather
milder statement, and see if you will believe that.

Shall we send her, then, to the famous New York school of Mrs. Destructive? This is recently
noticed as follows in the "Household Journal":--"Of this most admirable school, for faithful
and well-bred system of education, we have long intended to speak approvingly; but in the following
extract from the circular the truth is more expressively given:--'From September to April the
time of rising is a quarter before seven o'clock, and from April to July half an hour earlier;
then breakfast; after which, from eight to nine o'clock, study,--the school opening at nine
o'clock, with reading the Scriptures and prayer. From nine until half past twelve, the recitations
succeed one another, with occasional short intervals of rest. From half past twelve to one,
recreation and lunch. From one to three o'clock, at which hour the school closes, the studies
are exclusively in the French language.... From three to four o'clock in the winter, but later
in the summer, exercise in the open air. There are also opportunities for exercise several
times in the day, at short intervals, which cannot easily be explained. From a quarter past
four to five o'clock, study; then dinner, and soon after, tea. From seven to nine, two hours
of study; immediately after which all retire for the night, and lights in the sleeping apartments
must be extinguished at half past nine.'" You have summed up the total already, Dolorosus;
I see it on your lips;--nine--hours-- and--a quarter of study, and one solitary hour for exercise,
not counting those inexplicable "short intervals which cannot easily be explained!"

You will be pleased to hear that I have had an opportunity of witnessing the brilliant results
of Mrs. Destructive's system, in the case of my charming little neighbor, Fanny Carroll. She
has lately returned from a stay of one year under that fashionable roof. In most respects,
I was assured, the results of the school were all that could be desired; the mother informed
me, with delight, that the child now spoke French like an angel from Paris, and handled her
silver fork like a seraph from the skies. You may well suppose that I hastened to call upon
her; for the gay little creature was always a great pet of mine, and I always quoted her with
delight, as a proof that bloom and strength were not monopolized by English girls. In the parlor
I found the mother closeted with the family physician. Soon, Fanny, aged sixteen, glided in,--a
pale spectre, exquisite in costume, unexceptionable in manners, looking in all respects like
an exceedingly used-up belle of five-and-twenty. "What were you just saying that some of my
Fanny's symptoms were, Doctor?" asked the languid mother, as if longing for a second taste
of some dainty morsel. The courteous physician dropped them into her eager palm, like sugar-plums,
one by one: "Vertigo, headache, neuralgic pains, and general debility." The mother sighed once
genteelly at me, and then again, quite sincerely, to herself;--but I never yet saw an habitual
invalid who did not seem to take a secret satisfaction in finding her child to be a chip of
the old block, though block and chip were both wofully decayed. However, nothing is now said
of Miss Carroll's returning to school; and the other day I actually saw her dashing through
the lane on the family pony, with a tinge of the old brightness in her cheeks. I ventured to
inquire of her, soon after, if she had finished her education; and she replied, with a slight
tinge of satire, that she studied regularly every day, at various "short intervals, which could
not easily be explained."

Five hours a day the safe limit for study, Dolorosus, and these terrible schools quietly put
into their programmes nine, ten, eleven hours; and the deluded parents think they have out-manoeuvred
the laws of Nature, and made a better bargain with Time. But these are private, exclusive schools,
you may say, for especially favored children. We cannot afford to have most of the rising generation
murdered so expensively; and in our public schools, at least, one thinks there may be some
relaxation of this tremendous strain. Besides, physiological reformers had the making of our
public system. "A man without high health," said Horace Mann, "is as much at war with Nature
as a guilty soul is at war with the spirit of God." Look first at our Normal Schools, therefore,
and see how finely their theory, also, presents this same lofty view.

"Those who have had much to do with students, especially with the female portion," said a Normal
School Report a few years since, "well know the sort of martyr-spirit that extensively prevails,--how
ready they often are to sacrifice everything for the sake of a good lesson,--how false are
their notions of true economy in mental labor, ... sacrificing their physical natures most
unscrupulously to their intellectual. Indeed, so strong had this passion for abuse become [in
this institution], that no study of the laws of the physical organization, no warning, no painful
experiences of their own or of their associates, were sufficient to overcome their readiness
for self-sacrifice." And it appears, that, in consequence of this state of things, circulars
were sent to all boarding-houses in the village, laying down stringent rules to prevent the
young ladies from exceeding the prescribed amount of study.

Now turn from theory to practice. What was this "prescribed amount of study" which these desperate
young females persisted in exceeding in this model school? It began with an hour's study before
daylight (in winter),--a thing most dangerous to eyesight, as multitudes have found to their
cost. Then from eight to half past two, from four to half past five, from seven to nine,--with
one or two slight recesses. Ten hours and three quarters daily, Dolorosus! as surely as you
are a living sinner, and as surely as the Board of Education who framed that programme were
sinners likewise. I believe that some Normal Schools have learned more moderation now; but
I know also what forlorn wrecks of womanhood have been strewed along their melancholy history,
thus far; and at what incalculable cost their successes have been purchased.

But it is premature to contemplate this form of martyrdom, for Angelina, who has to run the
gantlet of our common schools and high schools first. Let us consider her prospects in these,
carrying with us that blessed maxim, five hours' study a day,--"Nature loves the number five,"
as Emerson judiciously remarks,--for our aegis against the wiles of schoolmasters.

The year 1854 is memorable for a bomb-shell then thrown into the midst of the triumphant school-system
of Boston, in the form of a solemn protest by the city physician against the ruinous manner
in which the children were overworked. Fact, feeling, and physiology were brought to bear,
with much tact and energy, and the one special point of assault was the practice of imposing
out-of-school studies, beyond the habitual six hours of session. A committee of inquiry was
appointed. They interrogated the grammar-school teachers. The innocent and unsuspecting teachers
were amazed at the suggestion of any excess. Most of them promptly replied, in writing, that
"they had never heard of any complaints on this subject from parents or guardians"; that "most
of the masters were watchful upon the matter"; that "none of them pressed out-of-school studies";
while "the general opinion appeared to be, that a moderate amount of out-of-school study was
both necessary for the prescribed course of study and wholesome in its influence on character
and habits." They suggested that "commonly the ill health that might exist arose from other
causes than excessive study"; one attributed it to the use of confectionery, another to fashionable
parties, another to the practice of "chewing pitch,"--anything, everything, rather than admit
that American children of fourteen could possibly be damaged by working only two hours day
more than Walter Scott.

However, the committee thought differently. At any rate, they fancied that they had more immediate
control over the school-hours than they could exercise over the propensity of young girls for
confectionery, or over the improprieties of small boys who, yet immature for tobacco, touched
pitch and were defiled. So by their influence was passed that immortal Section 7 of Chapter
V. of the School Regulations,--the Magna Charta of childish liberty, so far as it goes, and
the only safeguard which renders it prudent to rear a family within the limits of Boston:--

"In assigning lessons to boys to be studied out of school-hours, the instructors shall not
assign a longer lesson than a boy of good capacity can acquire by an hour's study; but no out-of-school
lessons shall be assigned to girls, nor shall the lessons to be studied in school be so long
as to require a scholar of ordinary capacity to study out of school in order to learn them."

It appears that since that epoch this rule has "generally" been observed, "though many of the
teachers would prefer a different practice." "The rule is regarded by some as an uncomfortable
restriction, which without, adequate reason (!) retards the progress of pupils." "A majority
of our teachers would consider the permission to assign lessons for study at home to be a decided
advantage and privilege." So say the later reports of the committee.

Fortunately for Angelina and the junior members of the house of Dolorosus, you are not now
directly dependent upon Boston regulations. I mention them only because they represent a contest
which is inevitable in every large town in the United States where the public-school system
is sufficiently perfected to be dangerous. It is simply the question, whether children can
bear more brain-work than men can. Physiology, speaking through my humble voice, (the personification
may remind you of the days when men began poems with "Inoculation, heavenly maid!") shrieks
loudly for five hours as the utmost limit, and four hours as far more reasonable than six.
But even the comparatively moderate "friends of education" still claim the contrary. Mr. Bishop,
the worthy Superintendent of Schools in Boston, says, (Report, 1855,) "The time daily allotted
to studies may very properly be extended to seven hours a day for young persons over fifteen
years of age"; and the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, in his recent volume,
seems to think it a great concession to limit the period for younger pupils to six.

And we must not forget, that, frame regulations as we may, the tendency will always be to overrun
them. In the report of the Boston sub-committee to which I have referred, it was expressly
admitted that the restrictions recommended "would not alone remedy the evil, or do much toward
it; there would still be much, and with the ambitious too much, studying out of school." They
ascribed the real difficulty "to the general arrangements of our schools, and to the strong
pressure from various causes urging the pupils to intense application and the masters to encourage
it," and said that this "could only be met by some general changes introduced by general legislation."
Some few of the masters had previously admitted the same thing: "The pressure from without,
the expectations of the committee, the wishes of the parents, the ambition of the pupils, and
an exacting public sentiment, do tend to stimulate many to excessive application, both in and
out of school."

This admits the same fact, in a different form. If these children have half their vitality
taken out of them for life by premature and excessive brain-work, it makes no difference whether
it is done in the form of direct taxation or of indirect,--whether they are compelled to it
by authority or allured into it by excitement and emulation. If a horse breaks a blood-vessel
by running too hard, it is no matter whether he was goaded by whip and spur, or ingeniously
coaxed by the Hibernian method of a lock of hay tied six inches before his nose. The method
is nothing,--it is the pace which kills. Probably the fact is, that for every extra hour directly
required by the teacher, another is indirectly extorted in addition by the general stimulus
of the school. The best scholars put on the added hour, because they are the best,--and the
inferior scholars, because they are not the best. In either case the excess is destructive
in its tendency, and the only refuge for individuals is to be found in a combination of fortunate
dulness with happy indifference to shame. But is it desirable, my friend, to construct our
school-system on such a basis that safety and health shall be monopolized by the stupid and
the shameless?

Is this magnificent system of public instruction, the glory of the world, to turn out merely
a vast machine for grinding down Young America, just as the system of middle-men, similarly
organized, has ground down the Irish peasantry? Look at it! as now arranged, committees are
responsible to the public, teachers to committees, pupils to teachers,--all pledged to extract
a maximum crop from childish brains. Each is responsible to the authority next above him for
a certain amount, and must get it out of the victim next below him. Constant improvements in
machinery perfect and expedite the work; improved gauges and metres (in the form of examinations)
compute the comparative yield to a nicety, and allow no evasion. The child cannot spare an
hour, for he must keep up with the other children; the teacher dares not relax, for he must
keep up with the other schools; the committees must only stimulate, not check, for the eyes
of the editors are upon them, and the municipal glory is at stake: every one of these, from
highest to lowest, has his appointed place in the tread-mill and must keep step with the rest;
and only once a year, at the summer vacation, the vast machine stops, and the poor remains
of childish brain and body are taken out and handed to anxious parents (like you, Dolorosus):--"Here,
most worthy tax-payer, is the dilapidated residue of your beloved Angelina; take her to the
sea-shore for a few weeks, and make the most of her."

Do not you know that foreigners, coming from the contemplation of races less precociously intellectual,
see the danger we are in, if we do not? I was struck by the sudden disappointment of an enthusiastic
English teacher, (Mr. Calthrop,) who visited the New York schools the other day and got a little
behind the scenes. I spent four or five days in doing little else than going through these
truly wonderful schools.

I am sure that we have all had the same experience. How exciting it was, last year, to be sure,
to see Angelina at the grammar-school examination, multiplying mentally 351,426 by 236,145,
and announcing the result in two minutes and thirteen seconds as 82,987,492,770! I remember
how you stood trembling as she staggered under the monstrous load, and how your cheek hung
out the red flag of parental exultation when she can out safe. But when I looked at her colorless
visage, sharp features, and shiny consumptive skin, I groaned inwardly. It seemed as if that
crop of figures, like the innumerable florets of the whiteweed, now overspreading your paternal
farm, were exhausting the last vitality from a shallow soil. What a pity it is that the Deity
gave to these children of ours bodies as well as brains! How it interferes with thorough instruction
in the languages and the sciences! You remember the negro-trader in "Uncle Tom," who sighs
for a lot of negroes specially constructed for his convenience, with the souls left out? Could
not some of our school-committees take measures to secure the companion set, possessing merely
the brains, and with the troublesome bodies conveniently omitted?

The truth is, that we Americans, having overcome all other obstacles to universal education
of the people, have thought to overcome even the limitations imposed by the laws of Nature;
and so we were going triumphantly on, when the ruined health of our children suddenly brought
us to a stand. Now we suddenly discover, that, in the absence of Inquisitions, and other unpleasant
Old-World tortures, our school-houses have taken their place. We have outgrown war, we think;
and yet we have not outgrown a form of contest which is undeniably more sanguinary, since one-half
the community actually die, under present arrangements, before they are old enough to see a
battle-field,--that is, before the age of eighteen. It is an actual fact, that, if you can
only keep Angelina alive up to that birthday, even if she be an ignoramus, she will at least
have accomplished the feat of surviving half her contemporaries. Can there be no Peace Society
to check this terrific carnage? Dolorosus, rather than have a child of mine die, as I have
recently heard of a child's dying, insane from sheer overwork, and raving of algebra, I would
have her come no nearer to the splendors of science than the man in the French play, who brings
away from school only the general impression that two and two make five for a creditor and
three for a debtor.

De Quincey wrote a treatise on "Murder considered as one of the Fine Arts," and it is certainly
the fine art which receives most attention in our schools. "So far as the body is concerned,"
said Horace Mann of these institutions, "they provide for all the natural tendencies to physical
ease and inactivity as carefully as though paleness and languor, muscular enervation and debility,
were held to be constituent elements in national beauty." With this denial of the body on one
side, with this tremendous stimulus of brain on the other, and with a delicate and nervous
national organization to begin with, the result is inevitable. Boys hold out better than girls,
partly because they are not so docile in school, partly because they are allowed to be more
active out of it, and so have more recuperative power. But who has not seen some delicate girl,
after five consecutive hours spent over French and Latin and Algebra, come home to swallow
an indigestible dinner, and straightway settle down again to spend literally every waking hour
out of the twenty-four in study, save those scanty meal-times,--protracting the labor, it may
be, far into the night, till the weary eyes close unwillingly over the slate or the lexicon,--then
to bed, to be vexed by troubled dreams, instead of being wrapt in the sunny slumber of childhood,--waking
unrefreshed, to be reproached by parents and friends with the nervous irritability which this
detestable routine has created?

For I aver that parents are more exacting than even teachers. It is outrageous to heap it all
upon the pedagogues, as if they were the only apostolical successors of him whom Charles Lamb
lauded "the much calumniated good King Herod." Indeed, teachers have no objection to educating
the bodies of their small subjects, if they can only be as well paid for it as for educating
their intellects. But, until recently, they have never been allowed to put the bodies into
the bill. And as charity begins at home, even in a physiological sense,--and as their own children's
bodies required bread and butter,--they naturally postponed all regard for the physical education
of their pupils until the thing acquired a marketable value. Now that the change is taking
place, every schoolmaster in the land gladly adapts himself to it, and hastens to insert in
his advertisement, "Especial attention given to physical education." But what good does this
do, so long as parents are not willing that time enough should be deducted from the ordinary
tasks to make the athletic apparatus available,--so long as it is regarded as a merit in pupils
to take time from their plays and give it to extra studies,--so long as we exult over an inactive
and studious child, as Dr. Beattie did over his, that "exploits of strength, dexterity, and
speed" "to him no vanity or joy could bring," and then almost die of despair, like Dr. Beattie,
because such a child dies before us? With girls it is far worse. "Girls, during childhood,
are liable to no diseases distinct from those of boys," says Salzmann, "except the disease
of education." What mother in decent society, I ask you, who is not delighted to have her little
girl devote even Wednesday and Saturday afternoons to additional tasks in drawing or music,
rather than run the risk of having her make a noise somewhere, or possibly even soil her dress?
Papa himself will far more readily appropriate ten dollars to this additional confinement than
five to the gymnasium or the riding-school. And so, beset with snares on every hand, the poor
little well-educated thing can only pray the prayer recorded of a despairing child, brought
up in the best society,--that she might "die and go to heaven and play with the Irish children
on Saturday afternoons."

And the Sunday Schools coöperate with the week-day seminaries in the pious work of destruction.
Dolorosus, are all your small neighbors hard at work in committing to memory Scripture texts
for a wager,--I have an impression, however, that they call it a prize,--consisting of one
Bible? In my circle of society the excitement runs high. At any tea-drinking, you may hear
the ladies discussing the comparative points and prospects of their various little Ellens and
Harriets, with shrill eagerness; while their husbands, on the other side of the room, are debating
the merits of Ethan Allen and Flora Temple, the famous trotting-horses, who are soon expected
to try their speed on our "Agricultural Ground." Each horse, and each girl, appears to have
enthusiastic backers, though the Sunday-School excitement has the advantage of lasting longer.
From inquiry, I find the state of the field to be about as follows:--Fanny Hastings, who won
the prize last year, is not to be entered for it again; she damaged her memory by the process,
her teacher tells me, so that she can now scarcely fix the simplest lesson in her mind. Carry
Blake had got up to five thousand verses, but had such terrible headaches that her mother compelled
her to stop, some weeks ago; the texts have all vanished from her brain, but the headache unfortunately
still lingers. Nelly Sanborn has reached six thousand, although her anxious father long since
tried to buy her off by offering her a new Bible twice as handsome as the prize one: but what
did she care for that? she said; she had handsome Bibles already, but she had no intention
of being beaten by Ella Prentiss. Poor child, we see no chance for her; for Ella has it all
her own way; she has made up a score of seven thousand one hundred texts, and it is only three
days to the fatal Sunday. Between ourselves, I think Nelly does her work more fairly; for Ella
has a marvellous ingenuity in picking out easy verses, like Jack Horner's plums, and valuing
every sacred sentence, not by its subject, but by its shortness. Still, she is bound to win.

"How is her health this summer?" I asked her mother, the other day.

"Well, her verses weigh on her," said the good woman, solemnly.

And here I pledge you my word, Dolorosus, that to every one of these statements I might append,
as Miss Edgeworth does to every particularly tough story,--"N.B. This is a fact." I will only
add that our Sunday-School Superintendent, who is a physician, told me that he had as strong
objections to the whole thing as I could have; but that it was no use talking; all the other
schools did it, and ours must; emulation was the order of the day. "Besides," he added, with
that sort of cheerful hopelessness peculiar to his profession, "the boys are not trying for
the prize much, this year; and as for the girls, they would probably lose their health very
soon, at any rate, and may as well devote it to a sacred cause."

Do not misunderstand me. The supposed object in this case is a good one, just as the object
in week-day schools is a good one,--to communicate valuable knowledge and develop the powers
of the mind. The defect in policy, in both cases, appears to be, that it totally defeats its
own aim, renders the employments hateful that should be delightful, and sacrifices the whole
powers, so far as its influence goes, without any equivalent. All excess defeats itself. As
a grown man can work more in ten hours than in fifteen, taking a series of days together, so
a child can make more substantial mental progress in five hours daily than in ten. Your child's
mind is not an earthen jar, to be filled by pouring into it; it is a delicate plant, to be
wisely and healthfully reared; and your wife might as well attempt to enrich her mignonette-bed
by laying a Greek Lexicon upon it as try to cultivate that young nature by a topdressing of
Encyclopædias. I use the word on high authority. "Courage, my boy!" wrote Lord Chatham to his
son, "only the Encyclopædia to learn!"--and the cruel diseases of a lifetime repaid Pitt for
the forcing. I do not object to the severest quality of study for boys or girls;--while their
brains work, let them work in earnest. But I do object to this immoderate and terrific quantity.
Cut down every school, public and private, to five hours' total work per diem for the oldest
children, and four for the younger ones, and they will accomplish more in the end than you
ever saw them do in six or seven. Only give little enough at a time, and some freshness to
do it with, and you may, if you like, send Angelina to any school, and put her through the
whole programme of the last educational prospectus sent to me,--"Philology, Pantology, Orthology,
Aristology, and Linguistics."

For what is the end to be desired? Is it to exhibit a prodigy, or to rear a noble and symmetrical
specimen of a human being? Because Socrates taught that a boy who has learned to speak is not
too small for the sciences,--because Tiberius delivered his father's funeral oration at the
age of nine, and Marcus Aurelius put on the philosophic gown at twelve, and Cicero wrote a
treatise on the art of speaking at thirteen,--because Lipsius is said to have composed a work
the day he was born, meaning, say the commentators, that he began a new life at the age of
ten,--because the learned Licetus, who was brought into the world so feeble as to be baked
up to maturity in an oven, sent forth from that receptacle, like a loaf of bread, a treatise
called "Gonopsychanthropologia,"--is it, therefore, indispensably necessary, Dolorosus, that
all your pale little offspring shall imitate these? Spare these innocents! it is not their
fault that they are your children,--so do not visit it upon them so severely. Turn, Angelina,
ever dear, and out of a little childish recreation we will yet extract a great deal of maturer
wisdom for you, if we can only bring this deluded parent to his senses.

To change the sweet privilege of childhood into weary days and restless nights,--to darken
its pure associations, which for many are the sole light that ever brings them back from sin
and despair to the heaven of their infancy,--to banish those reveries of innocent fancy which
even noisy boyhood knows, and which are the appointed guardians of its purity before conscience
wakes,--to abolish its moments of priceless idleness, saturated with sunshine, blissful, aimless
moments, when every angel is near,--to bring insanity, once the terrible prerogative of maturer
life, down into the summer region of childhood, with blight and ruin;--all this is the work
of our folly, Dolorosus, of our miserable ambition to have our unconscious little ones begin,
in their very infancy, the race of desperate ambition, which has, we admit, exhausted prematurely
the lives of their parents. Every intelligent physician understands, that, other things being
equal, the chances of recovery are far less in the studious, highly intellectual child than
in one of an opposite description. The immediate mischief may have seemed slight, but the brain
is left in a condition of peculiar impressibility, which renders it morbidly sensitive to every
adverse influence."

Indeed, here is precisely the weakness of our whole national training thus far,--brilliant
immediate results, instead of wise delays. The life of the average American is a very hasty
breakfast, a magnificent luncheon, a dyspeptic dinner, and no supper. Our masculine energy
is like our feminine beauty, bright and evanescent. As enthusiastic travellers inform us that
there are in every American village a dozen, girls of sixteen who are prettier than any English
hamlet of the same size can produce, so the same village undoubtedly possesses a dozen very
young men who, tried by the same standard, are "smarter" than their English peers. Come again
fifteen years after, when the Englishmen and Englishwomen are reported to be just in their
prime, and, lo! those lovely girls are sallow old women, and the boys are worn-out men,--with
fire left in them, it may be, but fuel gone,--retired from active business, very likely, and
just waiting for consumption to carry them off, as one waits for the omnibus.

To say that this should be amended is to say little. Either it must be amended, or the American
race fails;--there is no middle ground. If we fail, (which I do not expect, I assure you,)
we fail disastrously. If we succeed, if we bring up our vital and muscular developments into
due proportion with our nervous energy, we shall have a race of men and women such as the world
never saw. Dolorosus, when in the course of human events you are next invited to give a Fourth-of-July
Oration, grasp at the opportunity, and take for your subject "Health." Tell your audience,
when you rise to the accustomed flowers of rhetoric as the day wears on, that Health is the
central luminary, of which all the stars that spangle the proud flag of our common country
are but satellites; and close with a hint to the plumed emblem of our nation, (pointing to
the stuffed one which will probably be exhibited on the platform,) that she should not henceforward
confine her energies to the hatching of short-lived eaglets, but endeavor rather to educate
a few full-grown birds.

As I take it, Nature said, some years since,--"Thus far the English is my best race; but we
have had Englishmen enough; now for another turning of the globe, and a step farther. But the
promise must be fulfilled through unequalled dangers. With the new drop came new intoxication,
new ardors, passions, ambitions, hopes, reactions, and despairs,--more daring, more invention,
more disease, more insanity,--forgetfulness, at first, of the old, wholesome traditions of
living, recklessness of sin and saleratus, loss of refreshing sleep and of the power of play.
To surmount all this, we have got to fight the good fight, I assure you, Dolorosus. Nature
is yet pledged to produce that finer type, and if we miss it, she will leave us to decay, like
our predecessors,--whirl the globe over once more, and choose a new place for a new experiment.

MY DOUBLE; AND HOW HE UNDID ME.

Alas! how little we knew on the day of my ordination, and in those halcyon moments of our first
housekeeping! We were passing through one of the large halls, when my destiny was fulfilled!
I saw my man! Céleste.

THE SINGER.

A star into our twilight fell,
    'Mong peasant homes in vales remote;
Men marvelled not till all the dell
    Was waked as by a bugle-note.

They wondered at the wild-eyed boy,
    And drank his song like draughts of wine;
And yet, amid their new-born joy,
    They bade him tend the herds and swine.

But he knew neither swine nor herds,--
    His shepherd soul was otherwhere;
The flocks he tended were the birds,
    And stars that fill the folds of air.

To sweeter song the wind would melt
    That fanned him with its perfumed wing;
Flowers thronged his path as if they felt
    The warm and flashing feet of Spring.

The brooklet flung its ringlets wide,
    And leapt to him, and kept his pace,--
Sang when he sang, and when he sighed,
    Turned up to him its starry face.

Through many a dawn and noon and night,
    The singing boy still kept his course;
For in his heart that meteor light
    Still burned with all its natal force.

He sang,--nor cherished thought of care,--
    As when, upon the garden-vine,
A blue-bird thrills the April air,
    Regardless of the herds and swine.

The children in their May-time plays,
    The maidens in their rosy hours,
And matrons in their autumn days,
    All heard and flung him praise or flowers.

And Age, to chimney-nooks beguiled,
    Caught the sweet music's tender closes,
And, gazing on the embers, smiled
    As on a bed of summer roses.

And many a heart, by hope forsook,
    Received his song through depths of pain,
As the dry channels of a brook
    The freshness of a summer rain.

But when he looked for house or bread,
    The stewards of earth's oil and wine
Shook sternly the reproving head,
    And bade him tend the herds and swine!

He strayed into the harvest plains,
    And 'mid the sultry windrows sung,
Till glowing girls and swarthy swains
    Caught music from his charmed tongue,--

Caught music that from heart to brain
    Went thrilling with delicious measure,
Till toil, which late had seemed a pain,
    Became a sweet Arcadian pleasure.

The farmer, at the day's decline,
    Sat listening till the eve was late;
Then, offering neither bread nor wine,
    Arose, and barred the outer gate,--

And said, "Would you have where to sleep
    On wholesome straw, good brother mine,
You need but plow, and sow, and reap,
    And daily tend the herds and swine."

The poet's locks shook out reply;
    He turned him gayly down the rill;
Yet left a light which shall not die,
    A sunshine on the farmer's sill.

He strewed the vale with flowers of song;
    He filled the homes with lighter grace,
Which round those hearth-stones lingered long,
    And still makes beautiful the place.

The country, hamlet, and the town
    Grew wiser, better, for his songs;--
The roaring city could not drown
    The voice that to the world belongs.

To beds of pain, to rooms of death,
    The soft and solemn music stole,
And soothed the dying with its breath,
    And passed into the mourner's soul.

And yet what was the poet's meed?
    Such, Bard of Alloway, was thine!
The soul that sings, the heart must bleed,
    Or tend the common herds and swine.

The nation heard his patriot lays,
    And rung them, like an anthem, round,
Till Freedom waved her branch of bays,
    Wherewith the world shall yet be crowned.

His war-songs fired the battle-host,
    His mottoes on their banners burned;
And when the foe had fled the coast,
    Wild with his songs the troops returned.

Then at the feast's triumphal board,
    His thrilling music cheered the wine;--
But when the singer asked reward,
    They pointed to the herds and swine.

"What! he a bard? Then bid him go
    And beg,--it is the poet's trade!
Dan Homer was the first to show
    The rank for which the bards were made!

"A living bard! What's he to us?
    A bard, to live, must first be dead!
And when he dies, we may discuss
    To whom belongs the poet's head!"

'Neath suns that burn, through storms that drench,
    He went, an outcast from his birth,
Still singing,--for they could not quench
    The fire that was not born of earth.

At last, behind cold prison-bars,
    By colder natures unforgiven,
His frail dust starved! but 'mid the stars
    His spirit found its native heaven.

Now, when a meteor-spark, forlorn,
    Descends upon its fiery wing,
I sigh to think a soul is born,
    Perchance, to suffer and to sing:--

Its own heart a consuming pyre
    Of flame, to brighten and refine:--
A singer, in the starry choir,
    That will not tend the herds and swine.

THE PROFESSOR AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE.

WHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE HEARD, AND WHAT HE SAW.

REVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES. By CHARLES MACKAY, LL.D., F.S.A. London: Smith, Elder, & Co.
1859. Whether Mr. Dickens, in putting forth this suggestion through one of his favorite characters,
had or had not a view to subsequent operations of his own, has long been a sore question among
his admirers on this side of the Atlantic. We believe that he had not; and that such "blowing-up"
as he imparted to the people of this country was wholly unpremeditated and spontaneous, besides
being of so harmless a nature that the patriot of most uneasy virtue need have been nowise
distressed in consequence. The language can show few more amusing books than the "American
Notes," especially the serious parts thereof.

Mr. Dickens had plenty of objects besides his future self at which to aim his satirical shot.
At the time he discharged it, the literary market of England was overstocked with books on
America, the authors of which had apparently tasked the best energies of their lungs in incessant
"blowings-up" of all that came within range of their breath. Up to that period, though viewing
America from various stand-points, they had seldom failed to recognize this one essential element
of success. Since then, however, attempts have been made to satisfy the prejudices of all sides,--in
which the bitter and the sweet have been deftly mingled, with the obvious belief that persons
aggrieved, while suffering from the authors' stings, would derive comfort from the consciousness
of accompanying honey. These hopes generally proved fallacious, and the authors, falling to
the ground between the two stools of American sensitiveness and British asperity, were regarded
in the light of stern warnings by many of their successors, who straightway became pitiless.

The critical works on America by English writers, published during the last fifty years, may
be numbered by hundreds. Of these, nearly half have at different times been reprinted in this
country. Most of them are now unknown, having passed to that oblivion of letters from whose
bourn no short-sighted and narrow-minded traveller ever ought to return. The annual harvest
began to appear about a half-century ago, when little more than descriptions of scenery and
geographical statistics were ventured upon,--although one quaint explorer, John Lambert, vouchsafed,
in 1810, some sketches of society, from which we learn, among other interesting facts, that
a species of Bloomerism pervaded New York, and flourished on Broadway, even at that early day.
Our visitors very soon enlarged the sphere of their observations, and entered upon the widest
discussions of republican manners and morals. Slavery, as was to be expected, received immediate
attention. In the course of ten years, "American Tours" had set in with such rigor, that one
writer felt called upon to apologize for adding another to the already profuse supply. This
was in 1818. For the next fifteen years, the principle of unlimited mockery was quite faithfully
observed. The Honorable De Roos, who made a naval examination in 1826, and satisfied himself
that the United States could never be a maritime power,--Colonel Maxwell, who entered upon
a military investigation, and came to a similar conclusion respecting our prospects as to army,
and who gained great credit for independent judgment by pronouncing Niagara a humbug,--Mrs.
Kemble, frisky and fragmentary, excepting when her father was concerned, and then filially
diffuse,--Mrs. Trollope, who refused to incumber herself with amiability or veracity,--Mr.
Lieber, who was principally troubled by a camp meeting at which he assisted,--Miss Martineau,
who retailed too much of the gossip that had been decanted through the tunnel of her trumpet,--and
Captain Marryatt, who was simply clownish,--afford fair examples of the style which dominated
until about 1836 or 1837. Then works of a better order began to appear. America received scientific
attention. It had been agriculturally worked up in 1818 by Cobbett, whose example was now followed
by Shirreff and others. In 1839, George Combe subjected us to phrenological treatment, and
had the frankness to acknowledge that it was impossible for an individual to properly describe
a great nation. Afterwards came Lyell, the geologist, who did not, however, confine himself
to scientific research, but also analyzed the social deposits, and ascertained that Slavery
was triturable. The manufacturers of gossip, meanwhile, had revolutionized the old system.
Mr. Dickens blew hot and cold, uniting extremes. Godley, in 1841, disavowed satire, and was
solemnly severe. Others evinced a similar disposition, but the result was not triumphant. Alexander
Mackay, in 1846, returned to ridicule; and Alfred Bunn, a few years after, surpassed even Marryatt
in his flippant falsehood. Mr. Arthur Cunynghame, a Canadian officer, entertained his friends,
in 1850, with a dainty volume, in which the first personal pronoun averaged one hundred to
a page, and the manner of which was as stiff as the ramrods of his regiment. Of our more recent
judges, the best remembered are Lady Emmeline Stuart Wortley who gave to the world the details
of her private experiences,--Mr. Chambers, of whose book there is really nothing in particular
to say,--Mr. Baxter, who considered Peter Parley a shining light of American literature,--Miss
Murray, who sacrificed her interests at St. James's upon the shrine of Antislavery,--Mr. Phillipps,
scientific,--Mr. Russell, agricultural,--Mr. Jobson, theological,--and Mr. Colley Grattan,
who may be termed the Sir Anthony Absolute of American censors, insisting that the Lady Columbia
shall be as ugly as he chooses, shall have a hump on each shoulder, shall be as crooked as
the crescent, and so forth.

Last of all comes Mr. Charles Mackay's book. Before proceeding to the few general words we
have to say of it, let us look for a moment at a question which he, like a number of his predecessors,
has considered with some attention. Why it is that the people of the United States manifest
such acute sensibility to the strictures of English writers, and receive their criticisms with
so much suspicion, Mr. Mackay is unable fully to determine. He is forced to believe that it
is only their anxiety "to stand well in English opinion which causes them to wince"; particularly
as "French and Germans may condemn, and nobody cares what they say." This is but a part of
the truth. Unquestionably, Americans do, as Mr. Mackay says, "attach undue importance to what
English travellers may say"; but this does not account for the universal feeling of mortification
which follows the appearance of each new tourist's story. Americans have not failed to observe,
that, of the hundreds of writers who come over, only a few of the most prominent of whom we
have mentioned above, not one in fifty is animated by a sincere impulse of honest good-will.
They have learned to mistrust them all, as triflers with our reputation, if not predetermined
calumniators. They have witnessed over and over again the childish ignorance, the discourtesy,
the vulgar deceptions of this class of bookmakers. They are not blind to these repeated struggles
to digest a mass of mental food for years, in days or weeks. They know their nation cannot
be understood by these chance viewers, feebly glancing through greenest spectacles, any more
than the Atlantic can be sounded with a seven-fathom line. They have become familiar with the
English traveller only to regard him with contempt. Each new production has opened the old
wound. Each new announcement awakens only derisive expectations. As for "French and Germans,"
with them it is very different; and Mr. Mackay ought to know it. They commonly write, if not
with comprehensive vision, at least with integrity of purpose. The best works on America are
by Frenchmen. What Englishman has shown the sincerity and fairness of De Tocqueville or Chevalier?
Knowing, then, that absurd malice and a capacity for microscopic investigation of superficial
irregularities in a society not yet defined are the principal, and in many cases the only,
qualifications deemed necessary to accomplish an English book on America, is it matter for
wonder that Americans should hesitate to kiss the clumsy rods so liberally dispensed?

We hasten to say that Mr. Charles Mackay's "Life and Liberty in America" is unusually free
from the worst of these faults. Hasty judgments, offences against taste, inaccuracies, occasional
revelations of personal pique it has; but it is not malicious. Sometimes it is even affecting
in its tenderness. It breathes a spirit of paternal regard. But it is, perhaps, the dullest
of books. If not "icily regular," it is "splendidly null." The style is as oppressive as a
London fog. It is marked, to use the author's own words, by "elegant and drowsy stagnation."
After the first few pages, it is with weariness that we follow him. We are inclined to think
Mr. Mackay has written too much, Mr. Squeers had milk for three of his pupils watered up to
the necessities of five. Mr. Mackay's experiences might have sustained him through a single
small volume, but he has diluted them to the requirements of two large ones. This would injure
the prospects of his work in America, but may not interfere with them in England. Minute details
of toilet agonies, pecuniary miseries, laundry tribulations, and anxieties of appetite may
possess an interest abroad which we are unable to appreciate here. We are not excited by the
intelligence that Mr. Mackay had an altercation with a negro servant on board a Sound steamer,
because he could not have lager-beer at table. Such things have been noticed before. We do
not shed a sympathetic tear over the two dollars which he once had to disgorge in New York,
in payment for a ride of two miles; nor do we mourn for the numerous other dollars with which
he reluctantly parted to satisfy the rapacity of hack-drivers all over the Union. We do not
thrill with indignation, when we learn that he was, on a certain occasion, swept by crinolines
into the middle of Broadway. Neither are we in any way stirred by such information as, that
he, like an English lord of whom he tells, was accustomed to eat oysters every night in New
York; or that he "was pervaded, permeated, steeped, and bathed in a longing desire to behold
Niagara," and that, when he beheld it, his "feelings were not so much those of astonishment
as of an overpowering sense of Law"; or that a peddler in a railroad-car sold nine bottles
of quack medicine at a dollar a bottle; or that he had eight pages of interview with a Baltimore
madman, who proved his insanity by perpetually calling Mr. Mackay the "Prince of the Poets
of England." The dreary solemnity with which these incidents are narrated renders them doubly
tedious. A flash of humor might enliven them, but we never see a spark. Mr. Mackay's comic
stories, too, of which there are not a few, are most lamentable specimens of wit, suggesting
forcibly the poppy-seeds spoken of by Mr. Pillicoddy, which are soporific in tendency, and
which, if taken incessantly for a period of three weeks, produce instant death.

Mr. Mackay's experiences were not of a startling character. He travelled leisurely, and recorded
discreetly. His blunders on a large scale are not numerous; but of minor facts, he announces
many which may be classed among the remarkable discoveries of the season. He states that New
York, New Jersey,(!) and Brooklyn form one city; that Broadway, N.Y., is decorated with elms,
willows, and mountain-ashes, "drooping in green beauty"; that persons with decent coats and
clean shirts in Boston may be safely put down as lecturers, Unitarian ministers, or poets;
that Maryland and Virginia are one commonwealth; that eighteen months before every Presidential
election, a cause of quarrel is made with England by both the principal political parties,
for the purpose of securing the Irish rote; that measly pork is caused by too hasty insertion
in brine after killing, and consequent rapid fermentation; that the people of the United States,
unless they have travelled in Europe, are quite unable to appreciate wit. [Mr. Mackay's wit?
If so, certainly.] These are but random pluckings from a rich blossoming.

The subject upon which the author has labored most earnestly is that of Slavery. If the views
he sets forth are the result of his own investigation, he is entitled to credit for unusual
exactness. There is nothing new about them, to be sure; but there is also nothing absurd, which
is a great point. He maintains the argument against Slavery, that it is to be practically considered
in its injurious influences on the white people of the Slave States, and, through them, on
the nation at large. When he undertakes an emotional view of the "institution," he becomes
feeble again. He thus describes his sensations while visiting a slave-market in New Orleans:--"I
entertained at that moment such a hatred of slavery, that, had it been in my power to abolish
it in an instant off the face of the earth by the mere expression of my will, slavery at that
moment would have ceased to exist,"--an avowal which will hardly be likely to confound the
American people by its boldness.

The statistical information in these volumes is as accurate as that of ordinary gazetteers.
In most cases, the author appears to have drawn his information from proper sources. The principal
exceptions to this are shown in one or two statements which he makes on the authority of his
Pylades, Colonel Fuller, and in his remarks upon Canada, which are colored with excessive warmth.
Mr. Mackay rests greater hopes upon the future of Canada than upon that of the United States.
He considers the Canadians as the rivals in energy, enterprise, and industry of the people
of the United States. His testimony differs from that of Lord Durham, who had good opportunities
for knowing something about the matter when he had charge of Canadian affairs, and who declared,
that "on the American side of the frontier all is activity and bustle," etc., "on the British
side all seems waste and desolate."

Mr. Mackay gives correctly the most prominent names of American literature, but his list of
artists is very imperfect. The little that he says about American music is all wrong. The first
opera by an American was produced in 1845; and it is not true that this is a solitary example.
Were it possible for us to pursue them, we should run down more errors of this kind than a
prudent man would have put into print.

Altogether, while we readily admit that Mr. Mackay has honestly, and, in general, good-naturedly,
performed his duty as an American chronicler, renouncing in a great measure the old principle
of "blowing-up," and that his essays do not reek with ignorance, like those of many of his
predecessors, it is yet proper to say that he has achieved a stupendous bore. His two volumes
are to us a melancholy remembrance. Their life is spiced with no variety. The same dead level
of dry personal detail speaks through each chapter; or if occasional relief is afforded, it
is "in liquid lines mellifluously bland," and prosier than all the rest. The one source of
amusement that the reader will discover is the complacent self-confidence which no assumption
of modesty can hide. "A controversy had been raging for at least a week" in Philadelphia about
the author's letters in the "Illustrated London News." His defender was "one of the most influential
and best-conducted papers of the Union"; his assailant behaved "scurvily." We cannot lavish
examples. This is the type of a hundred. Mr. Mackay seems to expect that his Jeremiad on tobacco-chewing
and spitting will act in America as St. Patrick's spells did on the vermin of Ireland. Unfortunately,
it will not. Mr. Dickens attempted the same thing in a much better manner,--excepting where
Mr. Mackay has copied him exactly, as he has once or twice,--and even the novelist's efforts
were fruitless. On the other hand, the main source of annoyance will be found in the needless
elevation of minute evils, and the determination to form general judgments from isolated experiences.
But of this we do not much complain. Rome derived some benefit from the cackling of a goose.
Possibly we may be made in some respects a wiser and a better nation through Mr. Mackay's influence.
For ourselves, however, if our aspirations ever turn toward a literary Paradise, we shall pray
that it may be one where travellers cease from troubling and dull tourists are at rest.

1. The New and the Old; or California and India in Romantic Aspects. By J.W. PALMER, M.D. New
York: Rudd & Carleton. 1859.

2. Up and Down the Irawaddi; being Passages of Adventure in the Burman Empire. By the Same.

It has passed into a scornful proverb, that it needs good optics to see what is not to be seen;
and yet we should be inclined to say that the first essential of a good traveller was to be
gifted with eyesight of precisely that kind. All his senses should be as delicate as eyes;
and, above all, he should be able to see with the fine eye of imagination, compared with which
all the other organs with which the mind grasps and the memory holds are as clumsy as thumbs.
The demand for this kind of traveller and the opportunity for him increase as we learn more
and more minutely the dry facts and figures of the most inaccessible corners of the earth's
surface. There is no hope of another Ferdinand Mendez Pinto, with his statistics of Dreamland,
who makes no difficulty of impressing "fourscore thousand rhinocerots" to draw the wagons of
the King of Tartary's army, or of killing eight hundred and fifty thousand men with a flourish
of his quill,--for what were a few ciphers to him, when his inkhorn was full and all Christendom
to be astonished?--but there is all the more need of voyagers who give us something better
than a census of population, and who know of other exports from strange countries than can
be expressed by $----. Give us the traveller who makes us feel the mystery of the Figure at
Saïs, whose veil has a new meaning for every beholder, rather than him who brings back a photograph
of the uncovered countenance, with its one unvarying granite story for all. There is one glory
of the Gazetteer with his fixed facts, and another of the Poet with his variable quantities
of fancy. The fixed fact may be unfixed next year, like an almanac, but the hasty sketch of
the true artist is good forever.

Critics have a good-natured way of stigmatizing, for the initiated, all poetry that is not
poetry, by saying that it is "elegant," "harmonious," or, worse than all, "descriptive." This
last commonly means that the author has done for his readers precisely what they could do for
themselves,--that he has made a catalogue of the natural objects to be found in a certain number
of acres, which differs from the literary efforts of an auctioneer only in this, that each
line begins with a capital and contains the same number of syllables. He counts the number
of cabbages in a field, of cows in a pasture, and tells us how many times a squirrel ran up
(or down) a given tree in a given time. He informs us that the bark of the shagbark is shaggy,
that the sleep-at-noon slumbers at mid-day, that moss is apt to grow on fallen tree-trunks
in damp places,--treats us as the old alchemists do, who give us a list of the materials out
of which gold (if it had any moral sense) would at once consent to be made, but somehow won't,--and
leaves us impressed with that very dead certainty, that things are so-and-so, which is the
result of verses that are only so-so.

Readers of the "Atlantic" need not be told that Dr. Palmer is not a descriptive poet of this
fashion. They have known how to appreciate his sketches of East Indian life, so vivid, picturesque,
and imaginative that they could make "Griffins" feel twinges of liver-complaint, and so true
that we have heard them pronounced "incomparable" by men familiar with India. Dr. Palmer is
no mere describer; he sees with the eye of a poet, touches only what is characteristic, and,
while he seems to surrender himself wholly to the Circe Imagination, retains the polished coolness
of the man of the world, and the brownness of the man of the nineteenth century. He not only
knows how to observe, but how to write,--both of them accomplishments rare enough in an age
when everybody is ready to contract for their display by the column. His style is nervous and
original, not harassingly pointed like a chestnut-burr, but full of esprit or wit diffused,--that
Gallic leaven which pervades whole sentences and paragraphs with an indefinable lightness and
palatableness. It is a thoroughly American style, too, a little over-indifferent to tradition
and convention, but quite free of the sic-semper-tyrannis swagger. Uncle Bull, who is just
like his nephew in thinking that he has a divine right to the world's oyster, cannot swallow
it properly till he has donned a white choker, and refuses to be comforted when Jonathan disposes
of it in his rapid way with the shell for a platter. We confess that we prefer the free-and-easy
manner in its proper place to the diplomatic way of always treating the reader with sentiments
of the highest consideration, and like a book all the more for having an Occidental flavor.

But it is not merely or chiefly as being among the cleverest and liveliest of modern light
literature that we value Dr. Palmer's books. They have a true poetic value, and instruct as
much as they entertain. While he is telling us a San Francisco story, the truth of the accessories
and the skill with which they are grouped bring the California of 1849 before us with unmatched
vividness. We have been getting knowledge and learning a deep moral without suspecting it,
as if by our own observation and experience. In the same way "Asirvadam the Brahmin" is a prose
poem that lets us into the secret of the Indian revolt. It is seldom that we meet with volumes
of more real power than these, or whose force is so artistically masked under ease and playfulness.
We prefer the "Old" part of the book to the "New." It seems to us to show a better style of
handling. There is something of melodrama in the style of the California stories,--a flavor
of blue lights and burnt cork. At the same time, we must admit that there is a melodramatic
taint in our American life:--witness the Sickles vulgarity. Young America is b'hoyish rather
than boyish, and perhaps the "New" may be all the truer to Nature for what we dislike in it.

"The New and the Old" is fittingly dedicated to the Autocrat of all the Breakfast-Tables, than
whom no man has done more to demonstrate that wit and mirth are not incompatible with seriousness
of purpose and incisiveness of thought.

Napoleonic Ideas. By Prince NAPOLEON LOUIS BONAPARTE. Translated by JAMES A. DORR. New York:
D. Appleton & Company. 1859.

This publication has at least that merit which is one of the first in literature,--it is timely.
Though we look upon the Emperor of the French as a kind of imperial Jonathan Wild, it does
not the less concern us to make a true estimate of his intellectual capacity. Nothing is more
unwise than to assume that a man's brain must be limited because his moral sense is small;
yet no mistake is more common. Napoleon the Third may play an important part in History, though
by no possibility an heroic one. In reading this little volume, one cannot fail to be struck
with the presence of mind and the absence of heart of which it gives evidence. It is the advertisement
of a charlatan, whose sole inheritance is the right to manufacture the Napoleonic pill, and
we read with unavoidable distrust the vouchers of its wonderful efficacy. We do not fancy the
Bonapartist grape-cure, nor believe in it.

Mr. Dorr's translation is excellent. He understands French, and is able to do it into English
elegantly and accurately without any trace of foreign idiom. This is no easy thing; for our
general experience has been that translators read French like Englishmen and write English
like Frenchmen.

Country Life. By R. MORRIS COPELAND. Boston: John P. Jewett & Company. 1859.

In an article on "Farming Life in New England," published in a former volume of the "Atlantic,"
a valued contributor drew attention to the painful lack of beauty in the lives and homes of
our rural population. Some attempts were made to show that his statements were exaggerated;
but we are satisfied that they were true in all essential particulars. The abolition of entails,
(however wise in itself,) and the consequent subdivision of estates, will always put country
life, in the English sense of the words, out of the question here. Our houses will continue
to be tents; trees, without ancestral associations, will be valued by the cord; and that cumulative
charm, the slow result of associations, of the hereditary taste of many generations, must always
be wanting. Age is one of the prime elements of natural beauty; but among us the love of what
is new so predominates, that we have known the largest oak in a county to be cut down by the
selectmen to make room for a shanty schoolhouse, simply because the tree was of "no account,"
being hollow and gnarled, and otherwise delightfully picturesque. Our people are singularly
dead also to the value of beauty in public architecture; and while they clear away a tree which
the seasons have been two centuries in building, they will put up with as little remorse a
stone or brick abomination that shall be a waking nightmare for a couple of centuries to come.
But selectmen are not chosen with reference to their knowledge of Price or Ruskin.

Mr. Copeland's book is specially adapted to the conditions of a community like ours. Its title
might have been "Rural Æsthetics for Men of Limited Means, or the Laws of Beauty considered
in their Application to Small Estates." It is a volume happily conceived and happily executed,
and meets a palpable and increasing want of our civilization. Whatever adds grace to the daily
lives of a people, and awakens in them a perception of the beauty of outward Nature and its
healthful reaction on the nature of man,--whatever tends to make toil unsordid, and to put
it in relations of intelligent sympathy with the beautiful progression of the seasons,--adds
incalculably to the wealth of a country, though the increase may not appear in the Report of
the Secretary of the Interior.

Mr. Copeland's volume is calculated to do this, and his own qualifications for the task he
has undertaken are manifold. Chief among them we should reckon a true enthusiasm for the cause
he advocates, and a hearty delight in out-of-doors-life. He writes with the zeal and warmth
of a reformer; but these are tempered by practical knowledge, and such a respect for the useful
as will not sacrifice it to the merely pretty. His volume contains not only suggestions in
landscape-gardening, guided always by the true principle of making Nature our ally rather than
attempting to subdue her, but minute directions for the greenhouse, grapery, conservatory,
farm, and kitchen-garden. One may learn from it how to plant whatever grows, and to care for
it afterwards. Engravings and plans make clear whatever needs illustration. The book has also
the special merit of not being adapted to the meridian of Greenwich.

We do not always agree with Mr. Copeland; we dissent especially from his prejudice against
the noble horsechestnut-tree, with its grand thunder-cloud of foliage, its bee-haunted cones
of bloom, and its polished fruit so uselessly useful to children,--Bushy Park is answer enough
on that score; but we cordially appreciate his taste and ability. His book will justify a warm
commendation. It is laid out on true principles of landscape-farming. The stiff and square
economical details are relieved by passages of great beauty and picturesqueness. The cockney
who owns a snoring-privilege in the suburbs will be stimulated to a sense of latent beauty
in clouds and fields; and the farmer who looks on the cosmic forces as mere motive-power for
the wheels of his money-mill will find the truth of the proverb, that more water runs over
the dam than the miller wots of, and learn that Nature is as lavish of Beauty as she is frugal
in Use. Even to the editor, whose only fields are those of literature, and whose only leaves
grow from a composing-stick, the advent of a book like this is refreshing. It enables him to
lay out with a judicious economy the gardens attached to his Spanish manor-houses, and to do
his farming without risk of loss, in the most charming way of all, (especially in July weather,)--by
proxy. Without leaving our study, we have already raised some astonishing prize-vegetables,
and our fat cattle have been approvingly mentioned in the committee's report. We have found
an afternoon's reading in Mr. Copeland's book almost as good as owning that "place in the country"
which almost all men dream of as an ideal to be realized whenever their visionary ship comes in.

High Life in New York. By JONATHAN SLICK. Philadelphia: Peterson & Brothers.

The advantages of a favorable introduction are very obvious. A person who enters society fortified
with eulogistic letters, giving assurance of his trustworthiness, so far as respectability
and good behavior are concerned, is tolerably sure of a comfortable reception. But if, unable
to sustain the character his credentials ascribe to him, he immediately begin to display bad
manners, ignorance, and folly, he not only forfeits the position to which he has gained accidental
access, but also brings discredit upon his too hasty indorser.

In literature it is not different. The collection of printed matter which appears under the
title of "High Life in New York" is accompanied by a note, signed by the publishers, who are
naturally supposed to know something of the real value of the works they issue, in which "editors
are forewarned that it is a volume which, for downright drollery and hearty humor, has never
had its equal in the productions of any American pen," and are otherwise admonished in various
ways calculated to inspire lofty expectations, and to fill the mind with exalted visions of
coming joy. But when it appears, on examination, that the book is as utterly unworthy of these
elaborate commendations as any book can possibly be,--that it is from beginning to end nothing
but a dead level of stagnant verbiage, a desolate waste of dreary platitude,--the reader cannot
but regard the publishers' ardent expressions of approbation as going quite beyond the license
allowable in preliminary puffs.

"High Life in New York" represents a class of publications which has, of late, in many ways,
been set before the public with too great liberality. The sole object seems to be to exhibit
the "Yankee" character in its traditional deformities of stupidity and meanness,--otherwise
denominated simplicity and shrewdness. Mr. Jonathan Slick is in no respect different from the
ordinary fabulous Yankee. An illiterate clown he is, who, visiting New York, contrives by vice
of impudence, to interfere very seriously with certain conventionalities of the metropolis.
He overthrows, by his indomitable will, a great many social follies. He eats soup with a knife
and fork; wears no more than one shirt a week; forces his way into ladies' chambers at unseemly
hours, to cure them of timidity; and introduces sundry other reforms, all of which are recorded
as evidences of glorious independence and a true nobility of spirit. Sometimes he goes farther,--farther
than we care to follow him. It would be easy to show wherein he is offensive, not to say disgusting;
but we are not so disposed. It is not considered necessary for the traveller who has dragged
his way over a muddy road to prove the nastiness of his pilgrimage by imparting the stain to
our carpets.

In this book, as in most of its class, the Yankee dialect is employed throughout, the author
evidently believing that bad spelling and bad grammar are the legitimate sources of New England
humor. This shows that he mistakes means for ends,--just as one who supposes that Mr. Merryman,
in the circus, must, of necessity, be funny, because he wears the motley and his nose is painted
red. The Yankee dialect is Mr. Jonathan Slick's principal element of wit; his second is the
onion. The book is redolent of onions. That odorous vegetable breathes from every page. A woman
weeps, and onions are invoked to lend aromatic fragrance to a stale comparison. In one place,
onions and education are woven together by some extraordinary rhetorical machinery; in another,
religion is glorified through the medium of the onion; until at last the narrative seems to
resolve itself into a nauseating nightmare, such as might torture the brain of some unhappy
dreamer in a bed of onions.

Why such works are ever written at all, it is difficult to imagine; but how it is, that, when
written, they find publishers, is inconceivable.

Great Auction-Sale of Slaves, at Savannah, Georgia. New York: Published by the American Anti-Slavery
Society.

This little pamphlet, reprinted from the columns of the "New York Tribune," possesses a double
interest. It furnishes the best and most minute description of an auction-sale of slaves that
has ever been published; and it admirably illustrates the enterprise and prompt energy which
often distinguish the journalism of America above that of any other country.

The slave-sale of which it is a record took place on the second and third days of March last,
in the city of Savannah. For many reasons, it had been looked forward to with more than usual
interest. The position of the owner, Mr. Pierce M. Butler, of Philadelphia, and the large number
(no less than four hundred and thirty-six) and superior quality of the human chattels offered
for sale, added to the importance of the event. The "Tribune" had one of its best descriptive
writers, Mr. Mortimer Thomson, on the spot. The duty Mr. Thomson undertook was not without
danger; for a somewhat extensive notoriety as an attaché of the "Tribune" was not likely to
insure him the most cordial reception at the South. Had his presence been discovered, the temper
of the people of Savannah would speedily have betrayed itself; and had his purpose been suspected,
their wrath would assuredly have culminated in wreakages of a nature unfavorable to his personal
comfort. But with caution, and the aid of Masonic influences, he escaped detection, and accomplished
his aim. The result of his observations was a report of considerable length, in which every
striking incident of the sale was narrated with accurate fidelity. Although written mostly
on the rail and against time, under circumstances which would be fatal to the labors of any
man not inured by newspaper experience to all sorts of literary hardships, the style is clear,
distinct, and often eloquent. The scene and the transaction are brought vividly to the reader's
mind. The throng of eager speculators,--the heavy-eyed and brutal drivers,--the sprightlier
representatives of Chivalry,--the unhappy slaves, abandoning hope as they enter the mart, excepting
in rare cases, where, grasping at straws, they pray in trembling tones that their ties of love
may remain unsevered,--the operations of the sale,--the shrinking women, standing submissively
under the vile jests of the reckless crowd,--are portrayed with all the emphasis of truth.
One little episode in particular, the love-story of Jeffrey and Dorcas, is a more affecting
history than romance can show.

The effect of this publication in the "Tribune" was prodigious. It was widely circulated through
all the journals of the North. The Anti-Slavery Society preserved it in a pamphlet. The ire
of a good portion of the Southern journals was ludicrous to witness, and proved how keenly
the blow was felt. The report was republished in Great Britain,--first in the London "Times,"
and subsequently, as a pamphlet, in Edinburgh, in Glasgow, and in Belfast. In one publisher's
announcement, at least, it was advertised as "Greeley's Account of the Great Slave-Sale."

Popular Tales from the Norse. New York: D. Appleton & Co. 12mo. pp. lxix., 379.

The tales of which this volume presents the first English translation--though, as regards some
of them, hardly the first English version--appear to have been collected about twenty or twenty-five
years ago. Two gentlemen, Messrs. Asbjörnsen and Moe, (the name of the first of whom begets
much confidence in his ability for the task,) went out among the most unlettered and rudest
of the common folk of Norway and Sweden, and there, from the lips of old women and little children,
gathered these stories of the antique time. Of what age the stories are, nobody knows,--those
who listened to them in their childhood, to relate them in turn in their declining years, least
perhaps of all. For they are a part of the inheritance common to all the races that have sprung
from the Asiatic ancestor, who, at periods the nearest of which is far beyond the ken of history,
and at intervals of centuries, sent off descendants to find a resting-place in Europe; and
it is one great object, if not the principal object, of the original collectors and the translator
of these tales to exhibit in them a bond of union among all European peoples.

Indeed, the tales in their present form may be regarded as examples in point appended to the
translator's Essay which opens the volume. For they will add little to our stock of available
stories, for either youthful or adult reading. The best of them already are a part of our nursery
lore, and are known to the English race under forms better adapted to English taste and sympathies
than those under which they are here presented; and nearly all of those that are exceptions
to this remark are unfitted for "home consumption," either by the objectionable nature of their
subjects, by the still more objectionable tendency of their teaching, or by a yet more fatal
demerit,--their lack of interest. They are in some respects notably tame and puerile,--with
a puerility which is not childish simplicity, but a lack of inventive fancy, and which exhibits
itself in bald repetition. The giant, for instance, always complains of a smell of Christian
blood, and is always answered by the formula, that a crow flew over the chimney and must have
dropped a bone down it; the hero almost always meets three old women, or three Trolls, or three
enchanted beasts or birds, of whom he in that case always asks the same questions, receiving
the same replies, verbatim. There is a reason for this sameness, which is indicative of the
rude condition of the people among whom the tales have been perpetuated; but the sameness palls
none the less upon more cultivated minds. (p. lxii.) We cannot agree with him in this appreciation
of the moral tone of the stories, many of which certainly speak ill for the honesty and manliness
of the race among which they have been for centuries cherished household-treasures. For in
a large proportion of those that have a successful hero, he obtains his success either by lying
or some kind of deceit or treachery, by stealing, or by imposing upon the credulity or feebleness
of age; and of those in which the hero is himself victorious over oppression, we are not able
to recollect one which exhibits the beauty of moderation and magnanimity, not to say of Christian
charity and forgiveness. Certainly the heroes of these tales do make the best of everything,
but they are not at all scrupulous as to their way of making it; and they do also keep a good
face to the foe, when (often by craft, theft, or violence) they have obtained some implement
or other gift of supernatural power which places their opponents entirely at their mercy and
with no risk to themselves. But of a manful contest on equal terms, or of a victory obtained
over tyrannous power by a union of patience, boldness, and honest skill, or even by undegrading
stratagem, the collection affords no instance that we remember.

The story of Shortshanks may be taken as a fair, and even a favorable example of the tone of
these Norse tales. Shortshanks and King Sturdy are twin brothers, who set out to seek their
fortunes within a few minutes of their birth, driven thereto by a precocious perception of
the res angustæ domi. They part at two roads almost immediately, and the story follows the
fortunes of Shortshanks, the younger; for in these miniature romances the elder is, as usual,
continually snubbed, and the younger is always the great man. Shortshanks has not gone far
before he meets "an old crook-backed hag," who has only one eye; and he commences his career
by gouging out or "snapping up" the single comfort of this helpless creature. The ship takes
him to the king's palace, on arriving at which he puts his vessel in his pocket, when he summons
his craft to his aid, and gets a place in the king's kitchen to carry wood and water for the
maid. The king's daughter has for some inscrutable reason been promised to three ogres, who
come successively to fetch her; and a certain Ritter Red professes to be man enough to rescue
her, but on the approach of the first ogre proves to be a coward and climbs a tree. But Shortshanks
slips off from his scullery; and having a weapon which can put a whole army to flight by a
single stroke, he is very brave, and keeps a remarkably good face to the foe, giving him with
his tongue as good as he sends, and, laughing the ogres' dubs to scorn, cuts off the ogrous
heads, (there are five on the first individual, ten on the second, and fifteen on the third,)
and carries off much treasure from the ships in which his foes came to fetch their victim.
Ritter Red descends, and takes the lungs and the tongues of the ogres, (though, as the latter
were thirty in number and of gigantic size, he must have had trouble in carrying them,) and
wishes to pass them off as evidence that he is the deliverer of the princess, of which they
would seem to have been very satisfactory proof: but the gold, silver, and diamonds carry the
day; Shortshanks has the princess and half the kingdom, and Ritter Red is thrown into a pit
full of snakes,--on the French general's principle, we suppose, who hung his cowards "pour
encourager les autres." But the king has another daughter, whom an ogre has carried off to
the bottom of the sea. Shortshanks discovers her while the ogre is out looking for a man who
can brew a hundred lasts of malt at one strike. He finds the man at home, of course, and puts
him to his task. Shortshanks gets the ogre and all his kith and kin to help the brew, and brews
the wort so strong, that, on tasting it, they all fall down dead, except one, an old woman,
"who lay bed-ridden in the chimney-corner," and to her our hero carries his wort and kills
her too. He then carries off the treasure of the ogres, and gives this princess and the other
half of the kingdom to his brother Sturdy.

Now we have no particular fault to find with such stories as these, when they are produced
as characteristic specimens of the folk-lore of a people; as such, they have a value beside
their intrinsic interest;--but when we are asked to receive them as part of the evidence that
that people is an honest and manly race, and as an acceptable addition to our stock of household
tales, we demur. The truth is, that the very worth of these tales is to be found not only in
the fact that they form a part of the stock from which our own are derived, but in the other
fact that they represent that stock as it existed at an earlier and ruder stage of humanitarian
development. They were told by savage mothers to savage children; and although some of them
teach the few virtues common to barbarism and civilization, they are filled with the glorification
of savage vice and crime;--deceit, theft, violence, even ruthless vengeance upon a cruel parent,
are constantly practised by the characters which they hold up to favor. Such humor as they
have, too, is of the coarsest kind, and is expressed chiefly in rude practical jokes, or the
bloody overreaching of the poor thick-headed Trolls, who are the butts of the stories and the
victims of their heroes. There is good ethnological and mythological reason why the Trolls
should be butts and victims, it is true; but that is not to the present purpose.

But although this judgment must be passed upon the collection, considered merely as tales to
be told and read at this stage of the world's progress, there are several notable exceptions
to it,--tales which are based upon healthy instincts, and which appeal to sympathies that are
never entirely undeveloped in the breasts of human beings above the grade of Bushmen, or in
which the fun does not depend upon the exhibition of unexpected modes of inflicting death,
pain, or discomfort. It is not, however, in these that we are to look for the chief attraction
and compensating value of the collection. Those are to be found, as we have already hinted,
in the relative aspects of the tales, which the general reader might consider for a long time
fruitlessly, save for the help of Mr. Dasent's Introductory Essay. This is at once an acute
and learned commentary upon the tales themselves, and a thoroughly elaborated monograph upon
mythology in its ethnological relations. We know no other essay upon this subject that is so
comprehensive, so compact, so clear, and so well adapted to interest intelligent readers who
have little previous knowledge on the subject, as Mr. Dasent's, although, of necessity, it
presents us with results, not processes. A perusal of this Essay will give the intelligent
and attentive reader so just a general notion of the last results of philological and ethnological
investigation into the history of the origin and progress of the Indo-European races, that
he can listen with understanding to the conversation of men who have made that subject their
special study, and appreciate, in a measure at least, the value of the many references to it
which he meets in the course of his miscellaneous reading. And should he be led by the contagion
of Mr. Dasent's intelligent enthusiasm to desire a more intimate acquaintance with a topic
which rarely fails to fascinate those whose tastes lead them to enter at all upon it, he may
start from this Essay with hints as to the plan and purpose of his reading which will save
him much otherwise blind and fruitless labor.

This, however, is not all. It is but right also to say that the readers whose religion is one
of extreme orthodoxy, that is, who deem it their bounden duty to believe exactly and literally
as somebody else believed before them,--such readers will find their orthodoxy often shocked
by the tales which Mr. Dasent has translated, and yet oftener and more violently by conclusions
which Mr. Dasent draws from a comparison of these stories with others that bear the same relation
to other races which these do to the Norsemen.

Still more will orthodoxy be shocked by Mr. Dasent's neglect to except Christianity from the
conclusion, (no new one, it need hardly be said, to those who know anything of the subject,)
that the mythologies or personal histories of all religions have been evolved the one from
the other, or grafted the one upon the other,--and by his intimation, that Christianity, keeping
pure in its spirit and undiverted from its purpose, has yet not hesitated to adapt its outward
forms to the tough popular traditions which it found deeply rooted in the soil where it sought
to grow, thus making itself "all things to all men, that it might by all means save some."

It will be seen that this book is not milk for babes, but meat for strong men. Among the tales
are some--and those, perhaps, the most interesting--which Mr. Dasent justly characterizes as
"intensely heathen," and yet in which the Saviour of the world or his apostles appear as interlocutors
or actors, which alone unfits the volume for the book-table of the household room. We are led
to insist upon this trait of the collection the more, because the translator's choice of language
often seems to be the result of a desire to adapt himself to very youthful readers,--though
why should even they be led to believe that such phrases as the following are correct by seeing
them in print?--"Tore it up like nothing"; "ran away like anything"; "it was no good" [i.e.
of no use]; "in all my born days"; "after a bit" [i.e. a little while]; "she had to let him
in, and when he was, he lay," etc.; "the Giant got up cruelly early." These, and others like
them, are profusely scattered through the tales, apparently from the mistaken notion that they
have some idiomatic force. They jar upon the ear of the reader who comes to them from Mr. Dasent's
admirably written Introductory Essay.

The book is one which we can heartily recommend to all who are interested in popular traditions
for their own sake, or in their ethnological relations.

Love, From the French of M.J. Michelet. Translated from the Fourth Paris Edition, by J.W. Palmer,
M.D., Author of "The New and The Old," "Up and Down the Irawaddi," etc.

M. Michelet perhaps longs, like Anacreon, to tell the story of the Atrides and of Cadmus, but
here we find him singing only of Love. It is a surprise to us that the historian should have
chosen this subject;--the book itself is another surprise. It starts from a few facts which
it borrows from science, and out of them it builds a poem,--a drama in five acts called Books,
to disguise them. Two characters figure chiefly on the stage,--a husband and a wife. The unity
of time is not very strictly kept, for the pair are traced from youth to age, and even beyond
their mortal years. Moral reflections and occasional rhapsodies are wreathed about this physiological
and psychological love-drama.

Here, then, is a book with the most taking word in the language for its title, and one of the
most distinguished personages in contemporary literature for its author. It has been extensively
read in France, and is attracting general notice in this country. Opinions are divided among
us concerning it; it is extravagantly praised, and hastily condemned.

On the whole, the book is destined, we believe, to do much more good than harm. Admit all its
high-flown sentimentalism to be half-unconscious affectation, such as we pardon in writers
of the Great Nation,--admit that the author is wild and fanciful in many of his statements,
that he talks of a state of society of which it has been said that the law is that a man shall
hate his neighbor and love his neighbor's wife,--admit all this and what lesser faults may
be added to them, its great lessons are on the side of humanity, and especially of justice
to woman, founded on a study of her organic and spiritual limitations.

Woman is an invalid. This is the first axiom, out of which flow the precepts of care, bodily
and mental, of tenderness, of consideration, with which the book abounds. To show this, M.
Michelet has recourse to the investigations of the physiologists who during the present century
have studied the special conditions which according to the old axiom make woman what she is.
As nothing short of this can by any possibility enable us to understand the feminine nature,
we must not find fault with some details not commonly thought adapted to the general reader.
They are given delicately, but they are given, and suggest a certain reserve in introducing
the book to the reading classes. Not only is woman an invalid, but the rhythmic character of
her life, "as if scanned by Nature," is an element not to be neglected without total failure
to read her in health and in disease. There is a great deal relating to this matter, some of
it seeming fanciful and overwrought, but not more so than the natures of many women. For woman
herself is an hyperbole, and the plainest statement of her condition is a figure of speech.
Some of those chapters that are written, as we might say, in hysteric paragraphs, only more
fitly express the extravagances which belong to the nervous movements of the woman's nature.

The husband must create the wife. Much of the book is taken up with the precepts by which this
new birth of the woman is to be brought about, M. Michelet's "entire affection" hateth those
"nicer hands" winch would refuse any, even the humblest offices. The husband should be at once
nurse and physician. He should regulate the food of the body, and measure out the doses of
mental nourishment. All this is kind and good and affectionate; but there is just a suspicion
excited that Madame might become slightly ennuyée, if she were subjected to this minute surveillance
over her physical and spiritual hygiene. Everything must depend on individual tendencies and
aptitudes; we have known husbands that were born for nurses,--and others, not less affectionate,
that worried more than they helped in that capacity.

We cannot follow M. Michelet through his study of the reaction of the characters of the husband
and wife upon each other, of the influence of maternity on conjugal relations, of the languishing
of love and its rejuvenescence. Still less can we do more than remotely allude to those chapters
in which his model woman is represented as ready on the slightest occasion to prove the name
of her sex synonymous with frailty. We really do not know what to make of such things. The
cool calculations of temptation as certain, and failure as probable,--the serious advice not
to strike a wife under any circumstances,--such words have literally no meaning to most of
our own American readers. Our women are educated to self-reliance,--and our men are, at least,
too busy for the trade of tempters.

In a word, this book was written for French people, and is adjusted to the meridian of Paris.
We must remember this always in reading it, and also remember that a Frenchman does not think
English any more than he talks it. We sometimes flatter ourselves with the idea that we as
a people are original in our tendency to extravagance of thought and language. It is a conceit
of ours. Remember Sterne's perruquier.

       *       *       *       *       *

How much such experiences as the following amount to we must leave to the ecclesiastical bodies
to settle.

"The Church is openly against her, [woman,] owing her a grudge for the sin of Eve."

"It is very easy for us, educated in the religion of the indulgent God of Nature, to look our
common destiny in the face. But she, impressed with the dogma of eternal punishment, though
she may have received other ideas from you, still, in her suffering and debility, has painful
foreshadowings of the future state."

But here are physiological statements which we take the liberty to question on our own responsibility.

"A French girl of fifteen is as mature as an English one of eighteen." What will Mr. Roberton
of Manchester, who has exploded so many of our fancies about the women of the East, say to this?

"A wound, for which the German woman would require surgical aid, in the French woman cures
itself." We must say of such an unproved assertion as the French General said of the charge
at Balaklava,--"C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la"--médecine.

"Generally, she [woman] is sick from love,--man, from indigestion." What a pity Nature never
makes such pretty epigrams with her facts as wits do with their words!

We have enough, too, of that self-assertion which Carlyle and Ruskin and some of our clerical
neighbors have made us familiar with, and which gives flavor to a work of genius. "I was worth
more than my writings, more than my discourses. I brought to this teaching of philosophy and
history a soul as yet entire,--a great freshness of mind, under forms often subtle,--a true
simplicity of heart," etc.

M. Michelet does not undervalue the importance of his work. He thinks he has ruined the dancing-gardens
by the startling revelations respecting woman contained in his book. He announces a still greater
triumph:--"I believe I have effectually suppressed old women. They will no longer be met with."
M. Michelet has not seen the columns of some of our weekly newspapers.

These are scales from the husk of his book, which, with all its fantasies, is a generous plea
for woman. Wise persons may safely read it, though they be not Parisians.

The translation is, and is generally considered, excellent. We notice two errors,--Jerres,
instead of Serres,--and would, for should, after the Scotch and Southern provincial fashion;--with
some questionable words, as reliable, for which we have Sir Robert Peel's authority, which
cannot make it as honest a word as trustworthy,-- masculize, which is at least intelligible,--and
fast, used as college-boys use it in their loose talk, but not with the meaning which sober
scholars are wont to give it. With these slight exceptions, the translation appears to us singularly
felicitous, notwithstanding the task must have been very difficult, which Dr. Palmer has performed
with such rare success.

Farm-Drainage. By HENRY E. FRENCH. New York: A.O. Moore & Co. 1859. 8vo. pp. 384.

We remember standing, thirty years ago, upon the cupola of a court-house in New Jersey, and,
while enjoying the whole panorama, being particularly impressed with the superior fertility
and luxuriance of one farm on the outskirts of the town. We recollect further, that, on inquiry,
we found this farm to belong to a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, who also exercised the
trade of a potter, and underdrained his land with tile-drains. His neighbors attributed the
improvement in his farm to manure and tillage, and thought his attempts to introduce tile-drains
into use arose chiefly from his desire to make a market for his tiles. Thirty years have made
a great change; and a New Hampshire Judge of the Court of Common Pleas gives us a book on Farm-Drainage
which tells us that in England twenty millions of dollars have been loaned by the government
to be used in underdraining with tile!

We believe that Judge French has given the first practical guide in draining to the American
farmer,--indeed, the first book professing to be a complete practical guide to the farmers
of any country. His right to speak is derived from successful experiments of his own, from
a visit to European agriculturists, and from a personal correspondence with the best drainage-engineers
of England and America, as well as from the study of all available magazines and journals.
No one could handle the subject in a more pleasant and lucid style; flashes of wit, and even
of humor, are sparkling through every chapter, but they never divert the mind of the reader
from the main purpose of elucidating the subject of deep drainage. The title-page does not
promise so much as the book performs; and we feel confident that its reputation will increase,
as our farmers begin to understand the true effects of deep drainage on upland, and seek for
a guide in the improvement of their farms.

The rain-tables, furnished by Dr. E. Hobbs, of Waltham, afford some very interesting statistics,
by which our climate may be definitely compared with that of our mother country. In England,
they have about 156 rainy days per annum, and we but 56. In England, one inch in 24 hours is
considered a great rain; but in New England six inches and seven-eighths (6.88) has been known
to fall in 24 hours. In England, the annual fall is about 21,--in New England, 42 inches. The
experiments on the retention of water by the soil are also interesting; showing that ordinary
arable soil is capable of holding nearly six inches of water in every foot of soil.

Not the least valuable portion of the book is a brief discussion of some of the legal questions
connected with drainage; the rights of land-owners in running waters, and in reference to the
water in the soil; the rights of mill-owners and water-power companies; and the subject of
flowage, by which so many thousand acres of valuable arable land are ruined to support unprofitable
manufacturing companies. The rights of agriculturists, and the interests of agriculture, demand
the care of our governments, and the hearty aid of our scientific men; and we are glad to find
a judge who, at least when off the bench, speaks sound words in their behalf.

Agriculture in the Atlantic States is beginning to attract the attention which its great importance
demands. Thorough draining is, as yet, little used among us, but a beginning has been made;
and Judge French's book will, doubtless, be of value in extension of the practice. If any reader
has not yet heard what thorough draining is, we would say, in brief, that it consists in laying
tile-pipes, from one and a half to three inches in diameter, four feet under ground, at from
twenty to sixty feet apart, so inclined as to drain out of your ground all the water that may
be within three feet of the surface. This costs from $30 to $60 per acre, and is in almost
all kinds of arable land an excellent investment of capital,--making the spring earlier, the
land warmer, rain less injurious, drought less severe, the crops better in quality and greater
in quantity. In short, thorough draining is, as our author says, following Cromwell's advice,
"trusting in Providence, but keeping the powder dry."

The Novels of James Fenimore Cooper. Illustrated with Steel Engravings from Drawings by Darley.
New York: W.A. Townsend & Co.

The British Museum, it is said, has accumulated over twenty-seven thousand novels written since
the publication of "Waverley." With the general diffusion of education the ambition of authorship
has had a corresponding increase; and people who were not inspired to make rhymes, nor learned
enough to undertake history, philosophy, or science, as well as those who despaired of success
in essays, travels, or sermons, have all thought themselves capable of representing human life
in the form of fiction. Very few of the twenty-seven thousand, probably, are wholly destitute
of merit. Each author has drawn what he saw, or knew, or did, or imagined; and so has preserved
something worthy, for those who live upon his plane and see the world with his eyes. The difficulty
is, that the vision of most men is limited; they observe human nature only in a few of its
many aspects; they cannot so far lift themselves above the trivial affairs around them as to
take in the whole of humanity at a glance. Even when rare types of character are presented
to view, it is only a genius who can for the time assimilate himself to them, and so make their
portraits life-like upon his canvas. In every old-fashioned town there are models for new Dogberrys
and Edie Ochiltrees; our seaports have plenty of Bunsbys; every great city has its Becky Sharpe
and Major Pendennis. One has only to listen to a group of Irish laborers in their unrestrained
talk to find that the delicious non sequitur, which is the charm of the grave-diggers' conversation
in "Hamlet," is by no means obsolete. But who can write such a colloquy? It would be easier,
we fancy, for a clever man to give a sketch of Lord Bacon, with all his rapid and profound
generalization, than to follow the slow and tortuous mental processes of a clodhopper.

To secure the attention of his readers, the novelist must construct a plot and create the characters
whose movements shall produce the designed catastrophe, and, by the incidents and dialogue,
exhibit the passions, the virtues, the aspirations, the weaknesses, and the villany of human
nature. It is needless to say that most characters in fiction are as shadowy as Ossian's ghosts;
the proof is, that, when the incidents of the story have passed out of memory, the persons
are likewise forgotten. Of all the popular novelists, not more than half a dozen have ever
created characters that survive,--characters that are felt to be "representative men." After
Shakspeare and Scott, Dickens comes first, unquestionably; although, in analysis, philosophy,
force, and purity of style, he is far inferior to Thackeray. Parson Adams will not be forgotten,
nor that gentle monogamist, the good Vicar of Wakefield. But as for Bulwer, notwithstanding
his wonderful art in construction and the brilliancy of his style, who remembers a character
out of his novels, unless it be Doctor Riccabocca?

After this rather long preamble, let us hasten to say, that Cooper, in spite of many and the
most obvious faults, has succeeded in portraying a few characters which stand out in bold relief,--and
that his works, after years of criticism and competition, still hold their place, on both continents,
among the most delightful novels in the language. Other writers have appeared, with more culture,
with more imagination, with more spiritual insight, with more attractiveness of style; but
Leatherstocking, in the virgin forest, with the crafty, painted savage retreating before him,
and the far-distant hum of civilization following his trail, is a creation which no reader
ever can or would forget,--a creation for which the merely accomplished writer would gladly
exchange all the fine sentences and word-pictures that he had ever put on paper. It is also
due to Cooper to say, that "The Pilot" was the first, and still is the best, of nautical novels;
we say this in fell recollection of its trace of stupid heroines. The very air of the book
is salt. As you read, you hear the wind in the rigging,--a sound that one never forgets. The
form and motion of waves, the passing of distant ships, the outlines of spars and cordage against
the sky, the blue above and the blue below, all the scenery of the sea, here for the first
time found an appreciative artist.

We have not space to mention these novels separately. We are glad to see an edition which is
worthy of the author's genius,--each volume graced with the designs of Darley. The style in
which the work has been issued is creditable to the publishers, and cannot fail to be remunerative.

Ettore Fieramosca; or, the Challenge of Barletta. The Struggles of an Italian against Foreign
Invaders and Foreign Protectors. By MASSIMO D' AZEGLIO. Boston: Phillips, Sampson, & Co. 16mo.

The recent war led to the publication of a great number of books upon the state of Italy and
the relative positions of the contending powers; now that the wave has receded, all these are
left high and dry. This novel, however, does not depend upon any transient interest in the
affairs of Italy for its success. As the production of an eminent author, who is also one of
the first of Italian statesmen, it demands a respectful consideration. The condition of the
country in the sixteenth century presents a striking counterpart to that of the present year:
two foreign monarchs were at war in the Peninsula; and then, as now, it was a question whether
unhappy Italy had not as much to fear from her allies as from her invaders.

The scene of the story is laid in the little town of Barletta, on the Adriatic coast, in the
present kingdom of Naples. The action turns upon the fortunes of the day in a contest à l'outrance,
wherein a dozen French knights, the flower of the invading army, were met and vanquished by
an equal number of Italians, of whom the hero, Ettore Fieramosca, was the chief. The English
reader will not expect to find in this book any of the traits with which he is familiar in
the novels of our own authors. There is little scenery-painting, few wayside reflections, and
no attempt at portraying the comic side of human nature, or even the ordinary gayety of domestic
life. The times did not suggest such topics; and if they did, we suspect that the Italian novelists
would turn from such commonplace affairs to the more stirring events with which History has
been heretofore concerned. But the story before us has no lack of incident. When the persons
of the drama are fairly brought upon the stage, the action begins at once; surprise follows
surprise, plot is matched by plot, until the fortunes of the actors are entwined inextricably.
The portraits of the famous Colonna and of the infamous Cæsar Borgia (the latter being the
arch "villain" of the story) are drawn in sharp and decisive lines. The tournament which forms
the scene of the catastrophe is a brilliant picture, though not a pleasing one for a Friend
or a member of the Peace Society.

Of course the element of Love is not wanting; two golden threads run through the crimsoned
web; but whether they meet before Atropos comes with the fatal shears, it is not best to say.
When the modern novel-reader can answer the momentous question, "Did they marry?" the charm
of the most exciting story, for him, is gone.

Aside from the interest which one feels in the changing fortunes of the hero, the book is especially
valuable for the light it throws upon that period of Italian history, and upon the subtilties
of Italian character.
