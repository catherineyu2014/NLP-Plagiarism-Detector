43.  Carry out the behest of thy lord to thee.  How good is the teaching of a man's father,
for he hath come from him, who hath spoken of his son while he was yet unborn; and that which
is done for him (the son) is more than that which is commanded him.  Forsooth, a good son is
of the gift of the God; he doeth more than is {61} enjoined on him, he doeth right, and putteth
his heart into all his goings.

D.  If now thou attain my position, thy body shall flourish, the King shall be content in all
that thou doest, and thou shalt gather years of life not fewer than I have passed upon earth.
I have gathered even fivescore and ten years of life, for the King hath bestowed upon me favours
more than upon my forefathers; this because I wrought truth and justice for the King unto mine
old age.

  IT IS FINISHED

  FROM ITS BEGINNING TO ITS END

  EVEN AS FOUND IN WRITING.

[1] The King.

[2] Title of an order of the priesthood.

[3] The customary attitude of a submissive inferior at that time.

[4] The God Osiris was believed to have reigned on earth many thousand years before Mênês,
the first historical king.

[5] Soul = ka', and throughout this work.   Ka' is translated person in § 22, will in § 27.

[6] An obscure or corrupt phrase here follows, which does not admit of satisfactory translation.

[7] Translation doubtful.

[8] i.e. comfortable.

[9] His belly, presumably.

[10] The above translation is not satisfactory; the text may be corrupt.  No intelligible translation
of it has yet been made.

[11] i.e. all wickedness is contained therein.

[12] A servant.

[13] Compare Prov. xvii. 18.

[14] So also in life, by diversity of aim, alternating work and play, happiness is secured.
Tacking is evidently meant in the case of the steersman.

[15] This section refers to the relations between the son of a nobleman and his tutor, dwelling
on the benefits from former pupils in high places, if their schooldays have been pleasant.
The last sentence of this section, as of sections 23 and 25, is somewhat à propos des bottes.

[16] An obscure phrase is here.

[17] Literally, "It is that which preventeth the heart from advancing (?)"  A curious phrase.

[18] Literally, after his stick or sceptre.

[19] Who knows them.

[20] The greater part of this section is a play upon the root 'sôdem, which in its meaning
includes our hear (listen) and obey.  This tiresome torture of words is frequent in Egyptian,
especially in old religious texts.

[21] The "Followers of Horus" are a legendary dynasty of demigods, believed by the Egyptians
to have ruled for about 13,400 years after the reign of Horus, and before that of Mênês.  There
is also an order of spirits of this name.

[22] A word of unknown meaning; apparently some kind of plant.  Such a word seems out of place
here, and may be idiomatic, like our "flowery language."  But the preceding line obviously
refers to this book.

THE INSTRUCTION OF KE'GEMNI

On Avoiding Offence

1.[1] The cautious man flourisheth, the exact one is praised; the innermost chamber openeth
unto the man of silence.  Wide[2] is the seat of the man gentle of speech; but knives are prepared
against one that forceth a path, that he advance not, save in due season.

2.  If thou sit with a company of people, desire not the bread that thou likest: short is the
time of restraining the heart, and gluttony is an abomination; therein is the quality of a
beast.  A cup of water quencheth the thirst, and a mouthful of melon supporteth the heart.
A good thing standeth for goodness, but some small thing standeth for plenty.[3]  A base man
is he that is governed by his belly; he departeth only when he is no longer able to fill full
his belly in men's houses.

{63}

3.  If thou sit with a glutton, eat with him, then depart (?).

If thou drink with a drunkard, accept [drink], and his heart shall be satisfied.
