CHAPTER I

Little Sister

  "And could another child-world be my share,
  I'd be a Little Sister there."

"Have I got a Little Sister anywhere in this house?" inquired Laddie at the door, in his most
coaxing voice.

"Yes sir," I answered, dropping the trousers I was making for Hezekiah, my pet bluejay, and
running as fast as I could.  There was no telling what minute May might take it into her head
that she was a little sister and reach him first.  Maybe he wanted me to do something for him,
and I loved to wait on Laddie.

"Ask mother if you may go with me a while."

"Mother doesn't care where I am, if I come when the supper bell rings."

"All right!" said Laddie.

He led the way around the house, sat on the front step and took me between his knees.

"Oh, is it going to be a secret?" I cried.

Secrets with Laddie were the greatest joy in life.  He was so big and so handsome.  He was
so much nicer than any one else in our family, or among our friends, that to share his secrets,
run his errands, and love him blindly was the greatest happiness.  Sometimes I disobeyed father
and mother; I minded Laddie like his right hand.

"The biggest secret yet," he said gravely.

"Tell quick!" I begged, holding my ear to his lips.

"Not so fast!" said Laddie.  "Not so fast!  I have doubts about this. I don't know that I should
send you.  Possibly you can't find the way. You may be afraid.  Above all, there is never to
be a whisper.  Not to any one!  Do you understand?"

"What's the matter?" I asked.

"Something serious," said Laddie.  "You see, I expected to have an hour or two for myself this
afternoon, so I made an engagement to spend the time with a Fairy Princess in our Big Woods.
Father and I broke the reaper taking it from the shed just now and you know how he is about
Fairies."

I did know how he was about Fairies.  He hadn't a particle of patience with them.  A Princess
would be the Queen's daughter.  My father's people were English, and I had heard enough talk
to understand that.  I was almost wild with excitement.

"Tell me the secret, hurry!" I cried.

"It's just this," he said.  "It took me a long time to coax the Princess into our Big Woods.
I had to fix a throne for her to sit on; spread a Magic Carpet for her feet, and build a wall
to screen her. Now, what is she going to think if I'm not there to welcome her when she comes?
She promised to show me how to make sunshine on dark days."

"Tell father and he can have Leon help him."
