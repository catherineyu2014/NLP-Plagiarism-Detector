We have now to review briefly the discussions which went on during these years in {283} respect
to the political relations of the different states of the Empire.  Broadly speaking, two schools
or tendencies existed.  One favoured the retention of the powers of self-government already
acquired by the Dominions and the taking up of still further duties, while at the same time
aiming at full co-operation and harmony in matters of essential common interest.  The other,
declaring that the tendency towards self-government had already gone too far and would if continued
lead to the disruption of the Empire, advocated setting up some central council or parliament
with legislative and executive control over the whole Empire, within limitations more or less
wide.  One stood for a free alliance and co-operation, the other for organic or federal union
and centralization.  These two theories of empire did not, in Canada, become party creeds;
but, on the whole, Liberals were sympathetic with free alliance, while centralization drew
most of its support from Conservative ranks.  On some issues, however, there was an approach
to unanimity, and on others the division cut across party lines.

In domestic affairs self-government was almost entirely won.  Some survivals of the {284} old
colonial subordination remained in the formal inability of Canadians to amend their own constitution
and in the appeal from the decisions of Canadian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council--limitations which had been wholly or mainly removed in the case of the newer Commonwealth
of Australia.  But the long-contested control over copyright was finally conceded, and the
Hutton and Dundonald incidents led to the clearer recognition that if imperial officers entered
the military service of the Dominion they were, precisely as in the United Kingdom, under the
control of the responsible civil ministers.  The provision that the commander of the militia
must be a British officer was dropped in the revision of the Militia Act in 1904.  In the words
of Mr, now Sir Robert, Borden in 1902, words which became increasingly true as years went by;
'Step by step the colonies have advanced towards the position of virtual independence so far
as their internal affairs are concerned, and in all the important instances the claim has been
made by Canada, has been resisted at first by the imperial statesmen, and finally has been
conceded, and has proved of advantage both to the Mother Country and to the colonies.'

{285}

In foreign affairs self-government came more slowly, in the face of greater opposition, but
still steadily and surely.  Its coming was more imperceptible; in fact, many Canadians continued
to believe that they had no voice in the control of foreign policy, and made on this very ground
a strong plea either for setting up some central authority in which they would have representation,
or else for declining to take any part in imperial wars because they had not and could not
have a real voice in imperial policy.

This belief was well founded, so far as concerned part of the field of foreign affairs, but
it failed to recognize the striking advance made in other areas.  We were like M. Jourdain
of Molière's comedy, who was surprised to find that he had been talking prose all his life
without knowing it.  We had been carrying on a steadily increasing part of our foreign affairs
without consciously labelling them as such.  For to-day foreign affairs are largely commercial
affairs, questions of trade and tariff, of immigration and transportation, of fishery or power
or navigation rights.  And it is largely with contiguous countries that the most important
questions arise.  Now, as has been seen from the review of relations with {286} the United
States and other foreign countries in an earlier chapter, Canada had come to have all but complete
control of such affairs.

In 1909, following Australia's example, Canada established a department of External Affairs
for 'the conduct and management of international or intercolonial negotiations, so far as they
may appertain to the government of Canada.'  In introducing this measure Sir Wilfrid declared:
'All governments have found it necessary to have a department whose only business will be to
deal with relations with foreign countries....  We have now reached a standard as a nation
which necessitates the establishment of a Department of External Affairs.' On Sir Robert Borden's
accession to power one of his first steps was to increase the importance of this department
by giving it a minister as well as a deputy, attaching the portfolio to the office of the prime
minister.  For other purposes special envoys were sent, as when Mr Fielding negotiated trade
relations in France and in the United States, or Mr Lemieux arranged a compromise with the
government of Japan upon the immigration issue.  In these cases the British ambassador was
nominally associated with the Canadian envoy.  Even this formal {287} limitation was lacking
in the case of the conventions effected with France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and Italy in
1909-10, by negotiation with their consuls in Ottawa.  Finally, in the Waterways Treaty with
the United States, the international status of Canada was for the first time formally recognized
in the provision that the decision to submit to arbitration matters other than those regarding
boundary waters should be made on the one hand by the President and Senate of the United States,
and on the other by the Governor-General in Council, the Cabinet of the Dominion.

At the close of this period, then, every phase of our foreign relations so far as they concerned
the United States, and an increasingly large share of our foreign relations with other powers,
were under Canadian control.  It remained true, however, that Canada had no voice in determining
peace and war.  In other words, it was with Britain's neighbours, rather than with Canada's
neighbours, that any serious war was most likely to come.  Diplomatic policy and the momentous
issue of peace or war in Europe or Asia were determined by the British Cabinet. In this field
alone equality was as yet to seek.  The {288} consistent upholder of Dominion autonomy contended
that here, too, power and responsibility would come in the same measure as military and naval
preparation and participation in British wars.  Just as Canada secured a voice in her foreign
commercial relations as soon as her trade interests and industrial development gave her commercial
weight, so a share in the last word of diplomacy might be expected to come almost automatically
as Dominion and Commonwealth built up military and naval forces, or took part in oversea wars.

In this conception the Crown became the chief visible link of Empire. Autonomists believed
that 'His Majesty's Government' should remain a manifold power.  'We all claim to be His Majesty's
Government,' declared Sir Wilfrid at the Conference of 1907.  The Government at Sydney was
as much His Majesty's as the Government at Westminster.  The Canadian Privy Council was as
much His Majesty's as the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.  The tendency in the Dominions
had been to magnify the powers of the king, who was equally their king, and to lessen the powers
of the parliament elected in the United Kingdom.  In fact the Crown became, if the metaphor
is not too homely for such great {289} affairs, a siphon which transferred power from His Majesty's
Government in the old land to His Majesty's Governments in the Dominions.

It was, however, not enough to have independent control.  It was equally necessary, as the
other half of the policy of co-operation, to provide means for securing united and effective
action.  These were provided in many forms.  High commissioners and agents-general became increasingly
important as ambassadors to London.  Departments of External Affairs ensured more constant
and systematic intercourse. Special conferences, such as the Naval Conference of 1909 in London,
or the several exchanges of visits between the Australian and the New Zealand ministers, kept
the different states in touch with each other. But by far the most important agency was the
Colonial or Imperial Conference, now a definitely established body, in which Dominions and
Kingdom met on equal footing, exchanged views, and received new light on each other's problems.
Thus the question of co-operation between the Five Nations became much like the problem which
faces any allies, such as those of the Triple Entente, save that in the case of the British
Empire the alliance is not transitory and a {290} common king gives a central rallying-point.
Nowhere has this free form of unity, as unique in political annals as the British Empire itself,
received clearer expression than in the words of Edward Blake in the British House of Commons
in 1900:

For many years I for my part have looked to conference, to delegation, to correspondence, to
negotiation, to quasi-diplomatic methods, subject always to the action of free parliaments
here and elsewhere, as the only feasible way of working the quasi-federal union between the
Empire and the sister nations of Canada and Australia.  A quarter of a century past I dreamed
the dream of imperial parliamentary federation, but many years ago I came to the conclusion
that we had passed the turning that could lead to that terminus, if ever, indeed, there was
a practicable road.  We have too long and too extensively gone on the lines of separate action
here and elsewhere to go back now.  Never forget--you have the lesson here to-day--that the
good will on which you depend is due to local freedom, and would not survive its limitation.

But to many this trend of affairs was far from satisfactory.  They urged that Canada should
retrace her steps and take the turning that led to imperial parliamentary federation.  This
agitation was carried on chiefly in private circles and through the press.  One organization
after another--British Empire League, {291} Pollock Committee, Round Table--undertook earnest
and devoted campaigns of education, which, if they did not attain precisely the end sought,
at least made towards clearer thinking and against passive colonialism.  Occasionally the question
was raised in parliament.  Typical of such debates was that of March 13, 1905, when Colonel,
now General Sir Sam, Hughes moved a resolution in favour of parliamentary federation.  Mr Borden
refrained from either opposing or approving the motion, but, as did other members of his party,
made it a starting-point for a speech in favour of imperial preference.  Sir Wilfrid Laurier
declared:

I do not think that it would be possible to find in any of the self-governing colonies any
desire or any intention to part with any of the powers which they have at the present time.
At present we are proud to say and to believe that the relations of the British Empire, within
all its parts, are absolutely satisfactory....  It is not in accordance with the traditions
of British history, it is not in accordance with the traditions of the Anglo-Saxon race, to
make any change in their institutions until these institutions have been proved insufficient
or defective in some way....  The British Empire to-day is composed of nations, all bearing
allegiance to the same sovereign.

At the Conference of 1907 it was proposed {292} that the Colonial Conference be changed into
an Imperial Council.  This suggestion met support from various quarters, but was blocked by
Sir Wilfrid's firm opposition.  He agreed heartily that the Conference should be styled Imperial
rather than Colonial, but, backed by all his colleagues, opposed any attempt to turn the Conference
into a Council, with independent powers and an overwhelming representation from the United
Kingdom.  In fact the Conference was established more firmly than ever on a basis of equality.
The prime minister of the United Kingdom, rather than the colonial secretary, became the special
representative of his country, and the Conference was declared to be 'between His Majesty's
Government and His Governments of the self-governing Dominions overseas.'

At this Conference, perhaps more significant than anything that was said or done was the presence
of General Botha as prime minister of the self-governing colony of the Transvaal.  It was only
five years since Botha, as commander-in-chief of the Boers who had held out to the last, had
laid down his arms.  Now he sat in the highest councils of the Empire, saying little, studying
his fellow-ministers and the common problems, and impressing all by {293} his strong common
sense and his frank loyalty.  His presence there was due to the courage and confidence which
had been displayed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. One of the first steps taken by Campbell-Bannerman's
Ministry in 1906 had been to grant to the Transvaal full and immediate self-government without
any intervening period of half-freedom.  The policy had been a bold one.  To a German empire-framer
it would have appeared incredible folly.  The king had remonstrated against it, the leader
of the Opposition had termed it dangerous and reckless, Mr Kipling had hurled sonnets against
it.  But the Government had stood firm, with the result here seen, and with still greater justification
to follow.  In this and the following Conference General Botha manifested a special regard
for his Canadian colleague, like himself a leader from a minority race. Undoubtedly Wilfrid
Laurier's example, Canada's example, counted much in making clear to Louis Botha the path which
led to loyal and lasting co-operation.

The centralization policy found a new champion at the Conference of 1911.

Sir Joseph Ward, Mr Seddon's successor as prime minister of New Zealand, {294} submitted some
months in advance a proposal for an Imperial Council of State advisory to the British Government,
and then, having meantime been persuaded to go the whole road, made a speech in favour of a
central parliament.  The proposal met with still less favour than before.  British, Australian,
South African, Newfoundland, and Canadian prime ministers joined in pronouncing it unworkable
and undesirable.  'The proposal seems to me to be absolutely impracticable,' declared Sir Wilfrid
Laurier.  'It is not a practical scheme; our present system of responsible government has not
broken down,' agreed Premier Fisher of Australia.  'The creation of some body with centralized
authority over the whole Empire would be a step entirely antagonistic to the policy of Great
Britain which has been so successful in the past, and which has undoubtedly made the Empire
what it is to-day. Mr Asquith summed up:
