[Footnote 34135: Durand-Maillan, 297. "Fragment," by Lanjuinais. "Seven strangers, seven outside
agents, Desfieux, Proly, Pereyra, Dubuisson, Gusman, the two brothers Frey, etc., were set
up by the commune as an insurrectionary committee." Most of them are vile fellows, as is the
case with Varlet, Dobsen, Hassenfratz, Rousselin, Desfieux, Gusman, etc.]

[Footnote 34136: Buchez et Roux, XXVIII. 156. "We, members of the revolutionary commission,
citizens Clémence, of the Bon-Conseil section; Dunouy, of the Sans-culottes section; Bonin,
of the section of Les Marchés, Auvray of the section of Mont-Blanc; Séguy, of the section of
Butte-des-Moulins; Moissard, of Grenelle; Berot, canton d'Issy; Rousselin, section of the Unité;
Marchand, section of Mont-Blanc; Grespin, section of Gravilliers." They resign on the 6th of
June.--The commission, at first composed of nine members, ends in comprising eleven (Buchez
et Roux, XXVII. 316, official reports of the commune. May 31.) then 25 (Speech by Pache to
the Committee of Public Safety, June 1.)]

the above important measures... until the perturbators of the Assembly, known under the title
of the 'Right,' did themselves the justice to perceive that they were not worthy of taking
part in them; they evacuated the Assembly, after the great gesticulations and imprecations,
to which you know they are liable."]

the arrest of all suspected persons concealing themselves in the sections of Paris. Citizen
Robin is arrested on the 2nd of June, "for having manifested opinions contrary to the sovereignty
of the people in the National Assembly." The same day a proclamation is made on the territory
of the section by a deputation of the commune, accompanied by one member and two drummers,
"tending (tendantes) to make known to the people that the country will be saved by awaiting
(en atendans) with courage the decree which is to be rendered to prevent traitors (les traitre)
from longer sitting in the senate house."--Ibid., June 4. The committee decides that it will
add new members to its number, but they will be taken only from all "good sans-cullote; no
notary, no notary's clerk, no lawyers nor their clerks, no banker nor rich landlord" being
admissible, unless he gives evidence of unmistakable civism since 1789.--Cf. F7, 2497 (section
of the Droits de l'Homme), F7, 2484 (section of the Halle-au-blé), the resemblance in orthography
and in their acts; the registry of the Piques section (F7, 2475) is one of the most interesting;
here may be found the details of the appearance of the ministers before it; the committee that
examines them does not even spell their names correctly, "Clavier" being often written for
Clavière, and "Goyer" for Gohier.]

[Footnote 34155: Buchez et Roux, XXVII 359. Official reports of the commune, June 1. "One member
of the Council stated that on going to the Beaurepaire section he was not well received; that
the president of this section spoke uncivilly to him and took him for an imaginary municipalist;
that he was threatened with the lock-up, and that his liberty was solely due to the brave citizens
of the Sans-culottes section and the gunners of the Beaurepaire section who went with him."--Preparations
for the investment began on the 1st of June. ("Archives Nationales," F7, 2497, official reports
of the Droits de l'Homme section, June 1.) Orders of Henriot to the commandant of the section
to send "400 homme et la compagnie de canonier avec le 2 pièces de canon au Carouzel le long

[Footnote 34156: "Lanjuinais states 100,000 men, Meillan 50,000; the deputies of the Somme
say 60,000, but without any evidence. Judging by various indications I should put the number
much lower, on account of the disarmament and absentees: say 30,000 men, the same as May 31.]

that the indigent, by giving up their freedom, have a right to be supported. Society pays the
cost, but shuts them up and sets them to work. As this condition is repugnant to them, they
avoid the workhouse as much as possible." Similar institutions existed in France before the
revolution. (SR).]

[Footnote 34170: Sieyès (quoted by Barante, "Histoire de la Convention," III. 169) thus describes
it: "The fake people, the deadliest enemy which the French people ever had, blocked incessantly
the approaches to the Convention... At the entrance or exit of the Convention the astonished
spectator thought that a new invasion of barbarian hordes had suddenly occurred, a new irruption
of voracious, sanguinary harpies, flocking there to seize hold of the revolution as if it were
the natural prey of their species."]

[Footnote 34171: Gouverneur Morris, II. 241. Letter of Oct. 23, 1792. "The populace--something,
thank God, that is unknown in America"--He often insists on this essential characteristic of
the French Revolution.--On this ever-present class, see the accurate and complete work well
supported by facts, of Dr. Lombrose, "L'Uomo delinquente."]

days (June 1 and 2).]

Chaumette went so far as to demand Hébert's arrest.]

[Footnote 34177: Mallet du Pan, II. 52. (March 8, 1794).--The titular general of the revolutionary
army was Ronsin. "Previous to the Revolution he was a seedy author earning his living and reputation
by working for the boulevard stalls... One day a person informed him that his staff 'was behaving
very badly, acting tyrannically in the most outrageous manner at the theaters and everywhere
else, striking women and tearing their bonnets to pieces. Your men commit rape, pillage, and
massacre.' To which he replied; 'Well, what shall I do? I know that they are a lot of ruffians
as well as you do; but those are the follows I need for my revolutionary army. Find me honest
people, if you can, that will do that business.'" (Prudhomme, "Crimes de la Révolution," V. 130.)]

evening) "A sort of low-class artisan who seemed to me to have been a soldier... Apparently
he had associated only with disorderly men; I am sure that he would be found fond of gaming,
wine, women, and everything that denotes a bad character."]

[Footnote 34181: Charlotte de Corday d'Armont, 1768 to 1793. Young French girl who knifed Marat
in his bath. Adherent of the Revolution, she considered Marat as being responsible for the
elimination of the Girondists and the establishment of the terror. She was guillotined. (SR.)]

[Footnote 34182: Lauvergne, "Histoire de la Révolution dans le département du Var," 176. At
Toulon "the spirit of counter-revolution was nothing else than the sentiment of self-preservation."
It was the same thing at Lyons. (Nolhac, "Souvenir de trois année de la Révolution à Lyon,"
p. 14.)]
