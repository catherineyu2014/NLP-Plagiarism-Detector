fruits, as oranges and prunes, the amount rejected in eating is
practically the same as refuse. In others, as apples and pears, more or
less of the edible material is ordinarily rejected with the skin and
seeds and other inedible portions. The edible material which is thus
thrown away, and should properly be classed with the waste, is here
classed with the refuse. The figures for refuse here given represent, as
nearly as can be ascertained, the quantities ordinarily rejected.]

[Footnote G: The average of five analyses of cereal coffee grain is: Water 6.2, protein 13.3,
fat 3.4, carbohydrates 72.6, and ash 4.5 per cent. Only a portion of the nutrients, however,
enter into the infusion. The average in the table represents the available nutrients in the
beverage. If a record is made of all foods purchased and the waste and non-edible portions
are deducted, the nutrients consumed by a family may be calculated by multiplying the weight
of each food by the average composition. If such calculations be made, it will be found that
in some families nearly a half pound per day of both protein and fat is consumed by adults,
while in other families less than half of this amount is used. The object of dietary studies
is to determine the source, cost, composition, and nutritive value of the foods consumed by
different families; they also enable comparisons to be made of the amounts of nutrients purchased.
Extensive dietary studies have been made by the United States Department of Agriculture, and
the results have been published in various bulletins.[76]

245. Wide and Narrow Rations.--When the amount of carbohydrates in a ration is small in comparison
with the protein, it is called a narrow ration, while a wide ration is one in which the carbohydrates
are much in excess of the protein. When a ration contains 0.40 of a pound of protein, 0.40
of a pound of fat, and 1 pound of carbohydrates, it has a nutritive ratio of 1 to 4.8 and is
a narrow ration. To calculate the nutritive ratio, the fat is multiplied by 2-1/4, the product
added to the carbohydrates, and this sum divided by the protein. It is not possible to designate
accurately the amount of protein and other nutrients that should be in the daily ration of
all persons, because the needs of the body vary so with different individuals. Hard and fast
rules governing the amounts of nutrients to be consumed cannot as yet be formulated, as our
knowledge of the subject is too limited. It is known that both excessive and scant amounts
are alike injurious. While the appetite may indicate either hunger or satiety, it alone cannot
always be relied upon as a safe guide for determining the amount and kind of food to consume,
although the demands of appetite should not be disregarded until it has been demonstrated beyond
a doubt that it is not voicing the needs of nature. There has been a tendency which perhaps
was a survival of the Puritanical ideas of the early days to stamp as hurtful whatever seemed
desirable and pleasant; as examples might be cited the craving for water by fever patients,
and for sugar by growing children, which have now been proven to be normal demands of nature.

246. Dietary Standards.--As a result of a large number of dietary studies and digestion experiments,
dietary standards have been prepared. Atwater in this country and Voit in Germany have proposed
such standards for men employed at different kinds of labor, as follows:

  ==========================================================================
                                   |Protein| Fat|Carbo-  | Fuel   |Nutritive
                                   |       |    |hydrates| Value  |
  ---------------------------------|-------|----|-----------------|---------
                                   |  lb.  | lb.|   lb.  |Calories| Ratio
  Man with little physical exercise| 0.20  |0.20|  0.66  |  2450  |  5.5
  Man with light muscular work     | 0.22  |0.22|  0.77  |  2800  |  5.7
  Man with moderate muscular work  | 0.28  |0.28|  0.99  |  3520  |  5.8
  Man with active muscular work    | 0.33  |0.33|  1.10  |  4060  |  5.6
  Man with hard muscular work      | 0.39  |0.55|  1.43  |  5700  |  6.9
  ==========================================================================

In the table it will be seen that the quantity of nutrients increases with the labor to be
performed. In order to secure the necessary heat and energy, rations for men at heavy labor
contain proportionally more fat and carbohydrates than are required for light work. All dietary
standards, however, should be regarded as tentative only. Opinions differ greatly on different
points; for example, as to the amount of protein a ration should contain. This is a matter
that can be determined only from extended investigations under a variety of conditions, and
as yet results are too meager to formulate other than tentative standards. Chittenden has found
that the body can be sustained on very much less protein than is called for in the standard
ration.[77] The amount of protein in the ration should be ample to sustain the body weight
and maintain a nitrogen equilibrium; that is, the income and outgo of nitrogen from the body
should be practically equal.

     "While one freely admits that health and a large measure of
     muscular strength may be maintained upon a minimum supply of
     protein, yet I think that a dispassionate survey of mankind will
     show that races which adopt such a diet are lacking in what, for
     want of a better word, one can only describe as energy." [28]

On the other hand, excessive and unnecessarily large amounts of protein are sometimes consumed,
adding greatly to the cost of the ration and necessitating additional labor on the part of
the body for its elimination.

247. Number of Meals per Day.--Some persons advocate two meals per day rather than three, but
dietary studies show that the best results are secured when the food is divided among three
rather than two meals, and with a two-meal system the tendency is to consume a larger total
amount of food than when three meals are eaten. It is not essential that the food be equally
divided among the three meals. Any one of them may be lighter or more substantial as the habits
and inclinations of the individual dictate. If it is found necessary to reduce the total quantity
of food consumed, this may be done by a proportional reduction of each of the meals, or of
any one of them instead of decreasing the number of meals per day. The occasional missing of
a meal is sometimes beneficial, in cases of digestion disorders, but the ordinary requirements
of persons in normal health who have either mental or physical labor to perform are best met
when three meals per day are consumed, as this insures an even supply of nutrients. For persons
of sedentary habits, the kind and quantity of food at each meal must be regulated largely by
the individual from knowledge based on personal experience.

     "In the matter of diet every man must, in the last resort, be a law
     unto himself; but he should draw up his dietetic code intelligently
     and apply it honestly, giving due heed to the warnings which nature
     is sure to address to him should he at any time transgress."[28]

If there is trouble in digesting the food, it is well to study the other habits of life along
with the food question, for it may be the difficulty arises from some other cause, and would
be remedied by more exercise and fresh air, avoiding rush immediately after meals, more thorough
mastication, or less worry. It is a serious matter to shut off the supply of food from a person
not suffering from some disease and who is working; as well cut off the supply of fuel from
a furnace and then expect a full amount of energy and heat. But unlike the furnace, when the
human body is deprived of needed nutrients it preys upon itself and uses up its reserve that
should be drawn upon only in cases of illness or extreme nervous strain. Some persons live
in such a way as to never have any reserve of strength and energy to call upon but use up each
day all the body can produce and so become physical bankrupts when they should be in their
prime. Food is required for the production of nerve energy as well as physical energy.[78]

248. Mixed Dietary Desirable.--Experiments in the feeding of farm animals show that the best
results come from the combination of a number of foods to form a mixed ration, rather than
from the use of one food alone,[79] for in this way the work of digestion is more evenly distributed,
and a higher degree of efficiency is secured from the foods consumed. The same is true in human
feeding; the best results are secured from a mixed diet. Ordinarily, about two fifths of the
nutrients of a ration are derived from animal and three fifths from vegetable sources.

249. Animal and Vegetable Foods; Economy of Production.--Animal foods can never compete in
cheapness of the nutrients with cereals and vegetables, as it takes six to eight pounds or
more of a cereal, together with forage crops, to make a pound of meat. Hence the returns in
food value are very much larger from the direct use of the cereals as human food, than from
the feeding of cereals to cattle and the use of the meat. As the population of a country increases,
and foods necessarily become more expensive, cereals are destined to replace animal foods to
a great extent, solely as a matter of economy.

250. Food Habits.--Long-established dietary habits and customs are not easily changed, and
when the body becomes accustomed to certain foods, substitution of others, although equally
valuable, may fail to give satisfactory results. For example, immigrants from southern Europe
demand foods with which they are familiar, as macaroni, olive oil, and certain kinds of cheese,
foods which are generally imported and more expensive than the staples produced in this country,[80]
and when they are compelled to live on other foods, even though they have as many nutrients,
they complain of being underfed. Previously acquired food habits appear to affect materially
the process of digestion and assimilation. Sudden and pronounced change in the feeding of farm
animals is attended with unsatisfactory results, and whenever changes are made in the food
of either humans or animals they should be gradual rather than radical.

251. Underfed Families.--As the purchasing of food is often done by inexperienced persons,
palatability rather than nutritive value is made the basis of choice. Dietary studies show
that because of lack of knowledge of the nutritive value of foods, whole families are often
underfed. Particularly is this true where the means for purchasing foods are limited. In dietary
studies among poor families in New York City,[81] the United States Department of Agriculture
notes: "It is quite evident that what is needed among these families more than anything else
is instruction in the way to make the little they have go the farthest." Some classes of the
rich too are equally liable to be underfed, as they are more prone to food notions and are
able to indulge them. Among the children of the rich are found some as poorly nourished as
among the poor.

252. Cheap and Expensive Foods.--Among the more expensive items of a ration are meats, butter,
and canned fruits. The difference in composition and nutritive value between various cuts of
meat is small, being largely physical, and affecting taste and flavor rather than nutritive
value. Expensive cuts of meat, high-priced breakfast cereals, tropical fruits and foods which
impart special flavors, add little in the way of nutritive value to the ration, but greatly
enhance the cost of living. Ordinarily the cheapest foods are corn meal, wheat flour and bread,
milk, beans, cheese, sugar, and potatoes.[7] The amount of animal and vegetable foods to combine
with these to form a balanced ration may be governed largely by personal preference or cost,
as there is little difference in nutritive value. The selection of foods on the basis of cost
and nutritive value is discussed in Chapter XVI.
