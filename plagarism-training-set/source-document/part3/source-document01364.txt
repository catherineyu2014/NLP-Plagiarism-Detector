~Methyl alcohol~ (wood alcohol) (CH{3}OH). When wood is placed in an air-tight retort and heated,
a number of compounds are evolved, the most important of which are the three liquids, methyl
alcohol, acetic acid, and acetone. Methyl alcohol is obtained entirely from this source, and
on this account is commonly called wood alcohol. It is a colorless liquid which has a density
of 0.79 and boils at 67°. It burns with an almost colorless flame and is sometimes used for
heating purposes, in place of the more expensive ethyl alcohol. It is a good solvent for organic
substances and is used especially as a solvent in the manufacture of varnishes. It is very
poisonous.

~Ethyl alcohol~ (common alcohol) (C{2}H{5}OH). 1. Preparation. This compound may be prepared
from glucose (C{6}H{12}O{6}), a sugar easily obtained from starch. If some baker's yeast is
added to a solution of glucose and the temperature is maintained at about 30°, bubbles of gas
are soon evolved, showing that a change is taking place. The yeast contains a large number
of minute organized bodies, which are really forms of plant life. The plant grows in the glucose
solution, and in so doing secretes a substance known as zymase, which breaks down the glucose
in accordance with the following equation:

    C{6}H{12}O{6} = 2C{2}H{5}OH + 2CO{2}.

     ~Laboratory preparation of alcohol.~ The formation of alcohol and
     carbon dioxide from glucose may be shown as follows: About 100
     g. of glucose are dissolved in a liter of water in flask A
     (Fig. 90). This flask is connected with the bottle B, which
     is partially filled with limewater. The tube C contains solid
     sodium hydroxide. A little baker's yeast is now added to the
     solution in flask A, and the apparatus is connected, as shown
     in the figure. If the temperature is maintained at about 30°,
     the reaction soon begins. The bubbles of gas escape through the
     limewater in B. A precipitate of calcium carbonate soon forms
     in the limewater, showing the presence of carbon dioxide. The
     sodium hydroxide in tube C prevents the carbon dioxide in the
     air from acting on the limewater. The alcohol remains in the
     flask A and may be separated by fractional distillation.

2. Properties. Ethyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a pleasant odor. It has a density of
0.78 and boils at 78°. It resembles methyl alcohol in its general properties. It is sometimes
used as a source of heat, since its flame is very hot and does not deposit carbon, as the flame
from oil does. When taken into the system in small quantities it causes intoxication; in larger
quantities it acts as a poison. The intoxicating properties of such liquors as beer, wine,
and whisky are due to the alcohol present. Beer contains from 2 to 5% of alcohol, wine from
5 to 20%, and whisky about 50%. The ordinary alcohol of the druggist contains 94% of alcohol
and 6% of water. When this is boiled with lime and then distilled nearly all the water is removed,
the distillate being called absolute alcohol.

     ~Commercial preparation of alcohol.~ Alcohol is prepared
     commercially from starch obtained from corn or potatoes. The
     starch is first converted into a sugar known as maltose, by the
     action of malt, a substance prepared by moistening barley
     with water, allowing it to germinate, and then drying it. There
     is present in the malt a substance known as diastase, which has
     the property of changing starch into maltose. This sugar, like
     glucose, breaks down into alcohol and carbon dioxide in the
     presence of yeast. The resulting alcohol is separated by
     fractional distillation.

     ~Denatured alcohol.~ The 94% alcohol is prepared at present at a
     cost of about 35 cents per gallon, which is about half the cost
     of the preparation of methyl alcohol. The government, however,
     imposes a tax on all ethyl alcohol which amounts to $2.08 per
     gallon on the 94% product. This increases its cost to such an
     extent that it is not economical to use it for many purposes
     for which it is adapted, such as a solvent in the preparation
     of paints and varnishes and as a material for the preparation
     of many important organic compounds. By an act of Congress in
     1906, the tax was removed from denatured alcohol, that is
     alcohol mixed with some substance which renders it unfit for
     the purposes of a beverage but will not impair its use for
     manufacturing purposes. Some of the European countries have
     similar laws. The substances ordinarily used to denature
     alcohol are wood alcohol and pyridine, the latter compound
     having a very offensive odor.

     ~Fermentation.~ The reaction which takes place in the preparation
     of ethyl alcohol belongs to the class of changes known under
     the general name of fermentation. Thus we say that the yeast
     causes the glucose to ferment, and the process is known as
     alcoholic fermentation. There are many kinds of fermentations,
     and each is thought to be due to the presence of a definite
     substance known as an enzyme, which acts by catalysis. In
     many cases, as in alcoholic fermentation, the change is brought
     about by the action of minute forms of life. These probably
     secrete the enzymes which cause the fermentation to take place.
     Thus the yeast plant is supposed to bring about alcoholic
     fermentation by secreting the enzyme known as zymase.

~Glycerin~ (C{3}H{5}(OH){3}). This compound may be regarded as derived from propane (C{3}H{8})
by displacing three atoms of hydrogen by three hydroxyl groups, and must therefore be regarded
as an alcohol. It is formed in the manufacture of soaps, as will be explained later. It is
an oily, colorless liquid having a sweetish taste. It is used in medicine and in the manufacture
of the explosives nitroglycerin and dynamite.

ALDEHYDES

When alcohols are treated with certain oxidizing agents two hydrogen atoms are removed from
each molecule of the alcohol. The resulting compounds are known as aldehydes. The relation
of the aldehydes derived from methyl and ethyl alcohol to the alcohols themselves may be shown
as follows:

    Alcohols  {CH{3}OH          Corresponding aldehydes  {CH{2}O
              {C{2}H{5}OH                               {C{2}H{4}O

The first of these (CH{2}O) is a gas known as formaldehyde. Its aqueous solution is largely
used as an antiseptic and disinfectant under the name of formalin. Acetaldehyde (C{2}H{4}O)
is a liquid boiling at 21°.

ACIDS

Like the other classes of organic compounds, the organic acids may be arranged in homologous
series. One of the most important of these series is the fatty-acid series, the name having
been given to it because the derivatives of certain of its members are constituents of the
fats. Some of the most important members of the series are given in the following table. They
are all monobasic, and this fact is expressed in the formulas by separating the replaceable
hydrogen atom from the rest of the molecule:

    H·CHO{2}            formic acid, a liquid boiling at 100°.
    H·C{2}H{3}O        acetic acid, a liquid boiling at 118°.
    H·C{3}H{5}O{2}    propionic acid, a liquid boiling at 140°.
    H·C{4}H{7}O{2}    butyric acid, a liquid boiling at 163°.
    H·C{16}H{31}O{2}  palmitic acid, a solid melting at 62°.
    H·C{18}H{35}O{2}  stearic acid, a solid melting at 69°.
