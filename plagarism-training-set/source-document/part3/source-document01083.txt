PREFACE.

It has always appeared to me a curious thing that the bow, without which the fiddle could have
no being, should have received so scant attention, not alone from the community of fiddlers,
but also from writers on the subject. I only know of one book in which the subject is adequately
handled. Out of every twenty violinists who profess to some knowledge of the various types
of Cremonese and other fiddles of repute and value, barely three will be met with who take
a similar interest in the bow beyond knowing a good one, or rather one that suits their particular
physique, when playing with it. They are all familiar with the names of Dodd and Tourte, but
it is seldom that their knowledge extends beyond the names. As for a perception of the characteristics
of bows as works of art, which is the standard of the fiddle connoisseur, it hardly has any
existence outside the small circle of bow makers. Of the large number of undoubted fiddle experts
now in London, but a small proportion profess to any similar knowledge of bows, and of these
there are but few who can be credited with real authority in the matter.

It is, therefore, with the object of bringing the bow into more general notice that this little
book has been written, and, to drop into the good old prefatory style, if I succeed in arousing
the interest of but one violinist in the bow for itself, and apart from its work, my efforts
will not have been in vain.

My most hearty thanks are due to those who have so kindly assisted me in my work. To Messrs.
W. E. Hill and Sons, Mr. E. Withers, Mr. F. W. Chanot, Mr. J. Chanot, and Messrs. Beare, Goodwin
and Co., for the loan of valuable bows for the purpose of illustration, and Mr. A. Tubbs, who,
in addition to similar favours, most kindly placed much of his valuable time at my disposal,
and very patiently helped me to a sufficient understanding of the bow maker's craft for the
purpose of collecting materials for the second part of the book.

The third part, in which I treat of the use of the bow, I have purposely avoided making a systematic
handbook of bowing technique, for to handle that subject as exhaustively as I should wish would
require a separate volume. As stated in Chapter XIV., that portion of the book is addressed
almost exclusively to teachers, and in the few cases where I have gone into questions of technique
it has been limited to those points that appear to be most neglected or misunderstood by the
generality of teachers.

"Anything that is worth doing is worth doing well" is a maxim that teachers should hold up
to themselves and their pupils, and this reminds me of an exhortation to that effect in "Musick's
Monument," that quaint and pathetic book of Thomas Mace (1676) with which I cannot do better
than end my already too extensive preamble.

"Now being Thus far ready for Exercise, attempt the Striking of your Strings; but before you
do That, Arm yourself with Preparative Resolutions to gain a Handsome--Smooth--Sweet--Smart--Clear--Stroak;
or else Play not at all."

PUBLISHER'S NOTE.

In this new impression of the late Mr. Saint-George's book opportunity has been taken to correct
a few obvious errors, such as those occurring in the notices of the three bowmakers named Peccatte;
the deaths of those makers which have occurred since the publication of the first edition have
been noted, and a few fresh names have been added to the list contained in Chapter VIII. In
other respects the text of the work remains practically as the author left it.

THE BOW: Its History, Manufacture and Use.

PART I. THE HISTORY OF THE BOW.

As has been observed by the most talented writer on this subject "the history of the bow is
practically that of the violin." It will therefore be readily understood that in the earlier
portions of this opusculum it will be impossible to separate them to any great extent; also,
I must crave my readers' indulgence for going over a considerable tract of already well trodden
ground. My excuse must be my desire for completeness, for, as I propose to deal with the evolution
of the modern bow, I find it difficult to arbitrarily select a starting point to the exclusion
of all previous details, whether of ascertained fact or conjecture. Therefore I will follow
the invariable custom of fiddle literature and go back to the regions of speculative history
for a commencement.

Speculative history is, I fear, more fascinating to the writer than convincing to the reader,
so I will be as brief as possible in this particular, nor will I, like one John Gunn who wrote
a treatise on fingering the violoncello, fill up space with irrelevant matter such as the modes
and tunings of the ancient Greek lyres, etc., highly interesting as these subjects may be,
although it is a very tempting method of getting over the "bald and unconvincing" nature of
the bow's early history.

We of the present generation, having the bow in its most perfect form, are apt to take its
existence for granted; we do not think that there must have been a period when no such thing
was known, and, consequently, fail to appreciate the difficulties in the way of its discovery
or invention. With some other instruments it is different. For wind instruments we have a prototype
in the human voice, and one may reasonably suppose that the trumpet class were evolved by slow
process from the simple action of placing the hands on either side of the mouth to augment
a shout. The harp may have been suggested by the twanging of a bow-string as an arrow left
the archer's hand, and a seventeenth century play writer fancifully attributed the invention
of string instruments to the finding of a "dead horse head." Here, of course, would be found
a complete resonance-chamber and possibly some dried and stretched sinews--quite sufficient
to suggest lute-like instruments to men of genius such as must have formed a much larger proportion
of the world's population in prehistoric times than is the case to-day; for brilliant as our
great men of art and science are, there are few who can be called originators in the simplest
meaning of the word.

Thus, then, we have wind instruments, harps and lutes; but the bow eludes us. If we are determined
to find a suggestion in nature we must turn to certain insects of the cricket and grasshopper
tribe. Many of these, in particular the locusts, are thorough fiddlers, using their long hind-leg
as a bow across the edge of the hollow wing-case to produce the familiar chirping sound.

Naturally, the strings are absent, but here is to be found a perfect example of the excitation
of frictional vibration. Whether this was actually what suggested the bow is another matter.

For my own part, while admitting that in close observation of nature our early forefathers
were probably supreme, I prefer to think that the innate concept of the bow was latent in the
human mind and only waited some fortunate accident of observation to start it into being.

I am aware, however, that this is a highly unscientific position to take up.

That there should be so little in the way of adequate record concerning the development of
this indispensable adjunct of the violin is not a matter for great wonderment, for, as has
elsewhere been shown, the earlier bowed instruments were of such primitive construction, and,
consequently, so weak in tone that they were totally unsuited to the purposes of ceremonial
or pageantry; two subjects which form prominent features in ancient pictorial representations.
And if we come to what we fondly term "more civilized" times, we find such crude drawings of
early viols and kindred instruments that we must not be surprised if such an apparently unimportant
detail as the bow should receive still more perfunctory treatment at the hands of the artist.

We must also remember that the word "fiddlesticks" is still applied to anything that is beneath
contempt in its utter lack of importance.

Undoubtedly the idea of exciting vibrations in a stretched string by means of friction is one
of great antiquity; so much so, indeed, that the question of origin becomes merely one of conjecture.
True, the majority of writers look upon the bow as a development of the plectrum, but this
is a theory that I must confess does not strike me as being satisfactorily probable. To paraphrase
a popular expression, "fingers were made before plectra," the latter being an "improvement"
on nature's contrivance. And I see no reasonable objection to the supposition that friction
may have been used as a means of tone-production prior to the introduction of the plectrum.

The great dissimilarity between the producing of sound by plucking, and that by friction is
such that I see no occasion to evolve one from the other and consider their introduction most
probably coeval.

When we come to the direct percussion of a string, as in the dulcimer, piano, etc., we at once
perceive a possible connection between the hammer of the one and the rod or bow of the other:
the accidental colliding of the bow with the strings of its accompanying instrument would soon
suggest experiments ending in the forming of dulcimer-like instruments.[1] But if we grant
that the art of plucking a string had first advanced as far as the substitution of a plectrum
for what Mace calls the "nibble end of the flesh," I fail to see how such an implement could
suggest the friction of a string, as, if short enough for manipulation in its original use,
it would not be long enough to excite the continuous vibrations characteristic of the bow.

[Footnote 1: The bow is frequently used now as a means of percussion for certain effects.]

I do not accept the theory of a long plectrum used for pizzicato purposes, as I consider, with
Engel, that such an implement would have been unmanageably clumsy even for the primitive music
of the ancients. Whenever I see a rod, as in the accompanying drawing of the Assyrian Trigonon,
I maintain that its purpose was to excite frictional vibrations.

The method of performance readily suggests itself in this case as it will be seen that it would
be quite possible and convenient for the player to pass his rod--probably a rough surfaced
reed--between the strings. I do not think it could have been used for percussion as, in that
case, it would surely have had some hammer like projection at its end; a salient feature hardly
to be missed by the artist as were the less obtrusive details of the true bow in later ages.

We are all familiar with the oft repeated anecdote of Paganini's playing with a light reed-stem,
and I remember having seen at Christmas festivities in country homesteads, the village fiddler
playing a brisk old-time tune with the long stem of his clay pipe; also, quite recently, I
read an account of an "artiste" in the States who charmed his enlightened audiences with his
performances on the violin by using a variety of heterogeneous objects in lieu of the conventional
bow, including a stick of sealing-wax and a candle!

Now I do not wish to prove that the implement held by the benign Assyrian in Fig. 2, is either
of the last named articles, but merely to draw attention to the fact that friction-tone is
producible without the aid of a "bow" proper.

The use of plain reed stems or other suitable rods for the production of continuous sounds
would naturally soon give place to more elaborately constructed implements; although Rühlmann
gives a drawing of a portion of the sculptured decorations that adorn the famous "Golden Porch"
at Freiburg which represents a crwth and bow of the twelfth century, the bow being merely a
straight rod ornamented at either end with a simple knob (Fig. 3).

He also gives a drawing of a violist of the fourteenth century, sculptured on the cathedral
at Cologne, where the bow is even simpler in form. It is, however, impossible to judge how
far the sculptor's imagination, or lack of observation, may have been responsible for these
representations, so that they can hardly be taken as reliable evidence of the use of such primitive
contrivances at so late a period.

In attempting to trace the use of the bow to its source we are obliged to content ourselves
with the generalized statement that it is undoubtedly of oriental origin. Thus, that it had
an origin is proved beyond "all possible, probable shadow of doubt."

But whether the first form of bowed instrument became extinct prehistorically, or whether it
still survives, as some suppose, in the Ravanastron of India, is not easily determined.

My own personal belief in the extreme antiquity of the bow is such as almost to justify the
quaint statement of Jean Jacques Rousseau that Adam played the viol in Paradise.

Of existing bowed instruments the Ravanastron (Fig. 4) most certainly seems to be the oldest,
as its structure is more primitive than any other.

Concerning this instrument legend runs to the effect that it was invented by Ravana, who was
king of Ceylon some 5,000 years prior to the Christian era. How far this is accurate is impossible
to say, for the oldest names for the bow known to Sanskrit scholars only take us back 1,500
to 2,000 years. Of these names it is interesting to note that the Kôna was evidently no more
than a "friction rod" as, judging from the early descriptions, it would appear to have been
without hair. Whether the Gârikâ or Parivàdas approached more nearly to the modern idea of
a bow I am unfortunately not in a position to state with any degree of certainty.

The Ravanastron was, like the violin in its earliest stages, played only by the inferior classes
of India; a fact that, as Engel clearly points out, makes it seem highly improbable that it
was a Mohammedan importation, despite some writers' assertions to that effect. Undoubtedly
it was introduced with Buddhism, from India into China, where it became modified in unimportant
details into the Ur-heen.

A curious point in connection with some oriental fiddles, such as the Ur-heen, Uh-Ch'in (Fig.
5), Koka, etc., is that the hair of the bow passes between the strings.

Whether this circumstance is at all confirmatory of the supposition that the rod of the Trigonon
was passed between the strings would be difficult to establish irrefutably; doubtless a logician
could do so, but I prefer making a simple statement of facts rather than forcing them into
agreement with any special theory; although I have plenty of worthy precedents for such a proceeding,
for I have observed that most doubtful or disputed questions--the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy,
for instance--are handled in this manner.

What strikes one very forcibly on looking into the use of the bow in the East is the great
number of bowed instruments one finds. Thus in India we have the Ravanastron in various forms;
the Omerti (Fig. 6), the Bengalese Sarìndâ, etc.

In China, the Ur-heen, Uh-Ch'in, Saw-oo and Sawduang. In Siam, the Saw-tai, etc. In Turkey
and Arabia, the Kemangeh-a-gouz (Fig. 7), Kemangeh-roumy, Rebâb-esh-Sha'er (Fig. 8), and Rebâb-el-maghanny,
also the more modern Gunibry.

In Persia there is also an instrument strongly resembling the Omerti and Kemangeh in outline,
called the Sitâra (Fig. 9). Then there is a primitive bowed instrument with three strings,
known to the peasants of Russia as the Goudok, which is no doubt an immediate descendant of
the three-stringed Rebâb, and, more remotely, of the Ravanastron. Abyssinia too, has its bowed
instruments. In fact, the use of the bow is universal in the "glorious Orient," from whence
nearly all products of western civilization are derived. In almost all cases great antiquity
is ascribed to these instruments. The very name "Kemangeh-a-gouz," ancient in itself, can be
roughly translated "ancient-fiddle," thus showing that the Persians [the name is Persian and
bears out the Arab records that it came to them from Persia] considered it then a relic of
the past, and that it was a survival of some still older instrument inherited, most likely
from India. There can be little doubt that Fétis was right in assuming this to have been the
Omerti, for, barring the long "tail-pin," the structure of both is almost identical.

The bows of all these instruments bear a strong resemblance to each other, as is only to be
expected where all are of the simplest description. In the majority of cases the bow is merely
a length of cane with a bunch of horse-hair tied at each end in such a manner as to pull the
cane into a more or less pronounced curve. Those of the Goudok and Sarìndâ (Fig. 10) are short,
approach nearly to a semi-circle, and are quite rigid.

Those of the Ravanastron, Omerti, etc., are longer, and being more slender, have a certain
amount of flexibility, but it does not appear that this latter qualification is sought for
or considered indispensable. On the other hand, the now nearly obsolete Kokiu of Japan had
a bow of about forty-five inches in length that was extremely elastic. It was made in sections
after the manner of a fishing-rod, and the hair was tightened by the finger of the player,
as in some of the early viol bows of Europe.

The method of hairing in most cases amounts to the simplest way of tying the hair on to the
stick. Sometimes the hair is passed through a slit and held in place by a knot. In other specimens
it is attached to a leather thong, and occasionally it is plugged into the open end of a piece
of bamboo (Fig. 11).

The bows of the Saw-tai (Fig. 12), Uh-Ch'in, Koka and a few others show a distinct advance
in point of curve and adjustment of hair, and strongly resemble the bow of the quaint Swedish
Nyckelharpa in present use (Fig. 13).

The bows of the Sitâra (Fig. 9) and Saw-oo (Fig. 14), approach more nearly to the European
form. The drawings of the latter, however, were made from highly ornate and elaborate specimens
that may have been affected by Western influence. But against this must be set the religious
conservatism of eastern nations. In many cases it would amount to gross sacrilege to alter
in any way the construction of certain objects in daily use, so that we may take it generally
that the east of to-day differs very little from what it was, even several thousand years ago,
in such matters.

Perhaps the most interesting of the primitive bowed instruments is the Welsh Crwth. Unlike
the still more ancient forms yet surviving in the East, it is now completely obsolete: unless
we may count the Norwegian and Icelandic langspiel and fidla as descendants thereof.

At one time it was considered an ancestor of the violin, but since Mr. Heron-Allen brought
his legal acumen and skill in sifting evidence to bear on the subject, we find that it must
unquestionably be looked upon as the last of its race, and not as a direct forerunner of anything
else. As to its origin, I should say it was two-fold. The oft-quoted lines of that seventh
century Bishop, Venantius Fortunatus:--

  "Romanusque lyra, plaudat tibi Barbarus harpa
   Græcus Achilliaca, Chrotta Britanna canat"

prove, however translated, that the Crwth was essentially British. The structure of the instrument
strongly suggests its derivation from the Roman and Greek lyres, and I have little doubt that
the first Crwth was in fact a lyre in the hands of one of our early British ancestors, who
thought he would try thereon the effect of a Rebab or Kemangeh bow, and most probably got himself
heartily laughed at for his pains. This is a kind of experiment that has been tried in modern
times, as witness the "Streich-Guitarre" and more recent "Streich-Zither."

That the Eastern fiddles should have come to Britain then is not a very extravagant supposition.
The distance is not great from northern Africa, through Spain, where a form of Rebab is still
played by the Basque peasantry, on through Europe generally and across the Channel to England.
Also, it is very likely that there were a number of Orientals in attendance on the Imperial
Court of the Cæsars who would naturally bring their customs, religions and arts with them.

I do not think the Greeks and Romans made any use of the bow whatever, although, considering
the enormous spread of the Roman Empire, and, as I say, the diverse nationalities that surrounded
the court, many of the Indian, Persian and African bowed instruments must have been fairly
familiar objects in Rome and elsewhere. But being instruments of conquered nations; primitive
in construction and strange in tonality; they were probably held in too light esteem ever to
be adopted and developed by people of such importance and civilization as the Romans or Greeks.

I say all this with due respect to Mr. Fleming. This gentleman has contributed sundry valuable
works to the bibliography of the violin, and in certain places mentions an Etruscan vase illustrated
in a catalogue published by Prince Lucien Napoleon of Canino. He describes the decorations
of this vase as follows: "The subject is a man seated reading a volume to two youths, who,
leaning on knotted sticks, are listening attentively. On a little table or box in front of
the principal figure is inscribed the name 'Chironeis.' On each side of the reader is an object
which authorities in these matters term 'thecæ,' indicating the profession of this principal
figure. One of these has a neck or handle, an oval disc, or sounding plane, and a tail piece
extending below the disc rather more than half the length of the neck. From the upper extremity
of the neck to the lower extremity of the disc are stretched strings, and across these strings
at the centre of the disc is placed a bow of as rational construction as anything that has
come down to us prior to the days of Corelli. The instrument is indeed almost identical with
the Ravanastron." Now all this sounds very nice and extremely convincing, and whether or no
Mr. Fleming himself believes the Greeks used the bow, I have no doubt that he is perfectly
satisfied that he has proved such to be the case.

As I have seen neither the original vase or Prince Napoleon's catalogue, I feel some diffidence
in throwing my half-ounce of doubt on this pound--good, thumping weight--of fact. However,
I have seen the reproduction of the drawing as given by Mr. Fleming in his book, "Violins,
Old and New," and, since he makes such a feature of this Grecian Ravanastron, I feel safe in
assuming that it is accurately copied.

I distinctly remember first looking at that drawing. I gazed at it long and earnestly. I then
referred to the text; after which I rapidly searched through the book to see if there was another
drawing of a Greek vase. I thought perchance the printers in a playful mood might have transposed
them; such things have happened. But it was not so; the drawing on page 250 was the only one.
So I returned to it. There were the reader, the box, the inscription, the attentive youths
with their knotted sticks, and, lastly, the "thecæ." I was not long in doubt as to which of
these objects was the one Mr. Fleming attached so much importance to.

Ods catgut and fiddlesticks! as Bob Acres would genteelly have exclaimed. So this was the Etruscan
Ravanastron I had dreamed about; this was the Greek fiddle I had discoursed so learnedly of
when my pupils with childlike pertinacity questioned me as to the origin of the violin.

That is a useful sort of vase. If ever I come across anyone anxious to prove something, I shall
advise him to use that drawing. That Ravanastron would prove anything; in fact it proved too
much for me.
