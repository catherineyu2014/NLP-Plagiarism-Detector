[Sidenote: With the Editor]

While much that is interesting has happened this week in connection with the Maine disaster,
little can be even surmised as to the final action that will be taken by our Government. In
our news columns we have given such statements as seem worthy of repetition, but we wish our
readers to remember that unconfirmed news must not be accepted as fact. Careful attention to
the rumors and reports will, however, enable us to discriminate between the reports published
for sensational purposes and those based upon actual information.

We have received a number of suggestions from our subscribers concerning subjects relative
to Current History that they would like to have written up in our paper. We are very glad to
receive these letters and to provide articles to meet the demand. It is a pleasure to us to
keep in touch with our subscribers, and it is, of course, our desire to give them exactly what
they want. Let us hear from you on this subject, and address your letter to the Assistant Editor.

Answers to Correspondents

          DEAR EDITOR:

          I would like to hear about flowers and things that
          grow in the woods. I was in Vermont last summer. I
          went out in the woods and found a great many
          mushrooms. There are twelve kinds which grow in
          Holyoke.

          HOLYOKE, MASS.                            NEWTON R.

Mushrooms will be added to the list. This is the first inquiry about them. "NATURALIST."

          DEAR NATURALIST:

          I second the motion, made in the last number of
          THE GREAT ROUND WORLD by Willard P. M., to have a
          book telling how to catch, tame, and care for
          animals that inhabit our own woods. And I would
          suggest that these animals be simply described. We
          boys who are interested in our animals and birds
          are in great need of such a book; it would have
          helped me in any of the following cases. The
          summer resort at which I have spent several
          summers is infested with moles, yet for two years
          I have tried unsuccessfully to obtain one alive.
          Last spring I had three young crows, all of which
          died, not from inattention, but because I did not
          know how to care for them. Again, I have come
          across animals that I could not find a name for.
          For instance, last summer I came across two
          animals, one that resembled a shrew, another that
          looked somewhat like a mouse. Now if I had had a
          book like this proposed one on hand, I would
          simply have looked up its habits, would have found
          its name, would have known how to tame and feed
          it, and would have had a new addition to my
          menagerie. At least, I could do this if the
          animals were simply and plainly described as I
          suggested.

                                                 G. L. S.

Harold H. C., Cornwall.--The fastest large vessels are the new ocean liners. Several of these
have made runs of over five hundred miles in a day. The new torpedo-boats can outstrip any
of the large vessels for short distances. Several of them have records of about thirty miles
an hour. Seals cannot breathe under water; they are obliged to come to the surface frequently.

"B. S." asks: "For how long are foreign ministers to this country appointed? by whom? and how
are our foreign ministers appointed? and what is their salary?"

Foreign ministers are appointed by the head of the Government, and generally until their successor
is appointed. Our ministers are appointed by the President; their salaries differ according
to the importance of their position.
