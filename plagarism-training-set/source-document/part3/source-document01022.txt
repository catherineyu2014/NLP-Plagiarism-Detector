"SUBSCRIBER," NEW YORK.--It is not easy to stop a canary from moulting. The best way to treat
it is to feed it with nothing but rapeseed, and two or three times a week give it a slice of
hard-boiled egg. It should have plenty of fresh drinking water, in which you might put every
morning a few drops of "bird tonic," which can be purchased at any bird store. Do not hang
the cage in a very hot room.

THE DARWINOGRAM.

The object of this game is to discover from what prehistoric animal you are descended. You
select any one of the numbers, and follow the line to which it belongs with the point of a
pencil to the other end, and there you will find your original ancestor, according to the theory
of Mr. Darwin. It may prove to be a butterfly, or it may prove to be a goose.

THE LITTLE SPANISH DANCER.

This lively little fellow is very easily made. Take an old kid glove and cut off the fingers--this
is for the foundation. Upon it you may sew any bits of bright silk or cloth you like to look
like a jacket, and hide the doubled-up fingers. Make two little mittens, and two little socks
with stuffed toes, remembering to stuff one sock higher than the other, as your forefinger
is shorter than your middle finger, and you want your dancer to have both legs the same size.
After dressing up your hand to your satisfaction, paint on the back of the wrist a face with
water-colors, mixing a little gum with them if they will not "lay," and the little Spaniard
is ready to dance as long as it pleases you.

CHARADE.

  My whole most mischievous appears;
    Yet, if I you offend,
  Cut off my first, and swiftly will
    You bring me to my end.

  Freed from my last, I'm gayly off,
    Yet would you me detain;
  Cut off my last, and, lo! for time
    Without end I'll remain.

  My first the teamster names his nag
    That helps to draw the load,
  As toward my last their journey tends
    Along the country road.

  When, eagerly, we are my first,
    My last to then pursue,
  We're anxious most to shun my whole,
    While yet my whole we do.
