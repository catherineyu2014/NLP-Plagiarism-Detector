A few rain drops fell on his face and hands. "I hope it won't rain," he murmured, "it might
make dying more difficult, but no--the sky is clear." Then he slightly bent forward and listened
eagerly. Everything was calm, motionless, as in suspense. Nobody passed through the avenue.
Only in the adjoining side streets pedestrians flitted by like ghosts.

So this was the end! After having struggled bravely for years, after living up to high ideals
as well as one could, to go down a long, dark avenue--a falling star flashed across the tree tops.

The tall, lean man pressed his hand to his heart, although he was not certain of having heard
a report, he felt, that his friend had arrived at the goal of his life's journey. The game was up!
