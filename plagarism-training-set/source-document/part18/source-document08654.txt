In May 1814 Schopenhauer removed from Weimar to Dresden, in consequence of the recurrence of
domestic differences with his mother. This was the final break between the pair, and he did
not see her again during the remaining twenty-four years of her life, although they resumed
correspondence some years before her death. It were futile to attempt to revive the dead bones
of the cause of these unfortunate differences between Johanna Schopenhauer and her son. It
was a question of opposing temperaments; both and neither were at once to blame. There is no
reason to suppose that Schopenhauer was ever a conciliatory son, or a companionable person
to live with; in fact, there is plenty to show that he possessed trying and irritating qualities,
and that he assumed an attitude of criticism towards his mother that could not in any circumstances
be agreeable. On the other hand, Anselm Feuerbach in his Memoirs furnishes us with a scarcely
prepossessing picture of Mrs. Schopenhauer: "Madame Schopenhauer," he writes, "a rich widow.
Makes profession of erudition. Authoress. Prattles much and well, intelligently; without heart
and soul. Self-complacent, eager after approbation, and constantly smiling to herself. God
preserve us from women whose mind has shot up into mere intellect."

Schopenhauer meanwhile was working out his philosophical system, the idea of his principal
philosophical work. "Under my hands," he wrote in 1813, "and still more in my mind grows a
work, a philosophy which will be an ethics and a metaphysics in one:--two branches which hitherto
have been separated as falsely as man has been divided into soul and body. The work grows,
slowly and gradually aggregating its parts like the child in the womb. I became aware of one
member, one vessel, one part after another. In other words, I set each sentence down without
anxiety as to how it will fit into the whole; for I know it has all sprung from a single foundation.
It is thus that an organic whole originates, and that alone will live.... Chance, thou ruler
of this sense-world! Let me live and find peace for yet a few years, for I love my work as
the mother her child. When it is matured and has come to birth, then exact from me thy duties,
taking interest for the postponement. But, if I sink before the time in this iron age, then
grant that these miniature beginnings, these studies of mine, be given to the world as they
are and for what they are: some day perchance will arise a kindred spirit, who can frame the
members together and 'restore' the fragment of antiquity."[1]

By March 1817 he had completed the preparatory work of his system, and began to put the whole
thing together; a year later Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung: vier B�cher, nebst einem Anhange,
der die Kritik der Kantischen Philosophie enth�lt ("The World as Will and Idea; four books,
with an appendix containing a criticism on the philosophy of Kant"). Some delay occurring in
the publication, Schopenhauer wrote one of his characteristically abusive letters to Brockhaus,
his publisher, who retorted "that he must decline all further correspondence with one whose
letters, in their divine coarseness and rusticity, savoured more of the cabman than of the
philosopher," and concluded with a hope that his fears that the work he was printing would
be good for nothing but waste paper, might not be realised.[2] The work appeared about the
end of December 1818 with 1819 on the title-page. Schopenhauer had meanwhile proceeded in September
to Italy, where he revised the final proofs. So far as the reception of the work was concerned
there was reason to believe that the fears of Brockhaus would be realised, as, in fact, they
came practically to be. But in the face of this general want of appreciation, Schopenhauer
had some crumbs of consolation. His sister wrote to him in March (he was then staying at Naples)
that Goethe "had received it with great joy, immediately cut the thick book, and began instantly
to read it. An hour later he sent me a note to say that he thanked you very much and thought
that the whole book was good. He pointed out the most important passages, read them to us,
and was greatly delighted.... You are the only author whom Goethe has ever read seriously,
it seems to me, and I rejoice." Nevertheless the book did not sell. Sixteen years later Brockhaus
informed Schopenhauer that a large number of copies had been sold at waste paper price, and
that he had even then a few in stock. Still, during the years 1842-43, Schopenhauer was contemplating
the issue of a second edition and making revisions for that purpose; when he had completed
the work he took it to Brockhaus, and agreed to leave the question of remuneration open. In
the following year the second edition was issued (500 copies of the first volume, and 750 of
the second), and for this the author was to receive no remuneration. "Not to my contemporaries,"
says Schopenhauer with fine conviction in his preface to this edition, "not to my compatriots--to
mankind I commit my now completed work, in the confidence that it will not be without value
for them, even if this should be late recognised, as is commonly the lot of what is good. For
it cannot have been for the passing generation, engrossed with the delusion of the moment,
that my mind, almost against my will, has uninterruptedly stuck to its work through the course
of a long life. And while the lapse of time has not been able to make me doubt the worth of
my work, neither has the lack of sympathy; for I constantly saw the false and the bad, and
finally the absurd and senseless, stand in universal admiration and honour, and I bethought
myself that if it were not the case, those who are capable of recognising the genuine and right
are so rare that we may look for them in vain for some twenty years, then those who are capable
of producing it could not be so few that their works afterwards form an exception to the perishableness
of earthly things; and thus would be lost the reviving prospect of posterity which every one
who sets before himself a high aim requires to strengthen him."[3]

When Schopenhauer started for Italy Goethe had provided him with a letter of introduction to
Lord Byron, who was then staying at Venice, but Schopenhauer never made use of the letter;
he said that he hadn't the courage to present himself. "Do you know," he says in a letter,
"three great pessimists were in Italy at the same time--Byron, Leopardi, and myself! And yet
not one of us has made the acquaintance of the other." He remained in Italy until June 1819,
when he proceeded to Milan, where he received distressing news from his sister to the effect
that a Dantzic firm, in which she and her mother had invested all their capital, and in which
he himself had invested a little, had become bankrupt. Schopenhauer immediately proposed to
share his own income with them. But later, when the defaulting firm offered to its creditors
a composition of thirty per cent, Schopenhauer would accept nothing less than seventy per cent
in the case of immediate payment, or the whole if the payment were deferred; and he was so
indignant at his mother and sister falling in with the arrangement of the debtors, that he
did not correspond with them again for eleven years. With reference to this affair he wrote:
"I can imagine that from your point of view my behaviour may seem hard and unfair. That is
a mere illusion which disappears as soon as you reflect that all I want is merely not to have
taken from me what is most rightly and incontestably mine, what, moreover, my whole happiness,
my freedom, my learned leisure depend upon;--a blessing which in this world people like me
enjoy so rarely that it would be almost as unconscientious as cowardly not to defend it to
the uttermost and maintain it by every exertion. You say, perhaps, that if all your creditors
were of this way of thinking, I too should come badly off. But if all men thought as I do,
there would be much more thinking done, and in that case probably there would be neither bankruptcies,
nor wars, nor gaming tables."[4]

In July 1819, when he was at Heidelberg, the idea occurred to him of turning university lecturer,
and took practical shape the following summer, when he delivered a course of lectures on philosophy
at the Berlin University. But the experiment was not a success; the course was not completed
through the want of attendance, while Hegel at the same time and place was lecturing to a crowded
and enthusiastic audience. This failure embittered him, and during the next few years there
is little of any moment in his life to record. There was one incident, however, to which his
detractors would seem to have attached more importance than it was worth, but which must have
been sufficiently disturbing to Schopenhauer--we refer to the Marquet affair. It appears on
his returning home one day he found three women gossiping outside his door, one of whom was
a seamstress who occupied another room in the house. Their presence irritated Schopenhauer
(whose sensitiveness in such matters may be estimated from his essay "On Noise"), who, finding
them occupying the same position on another occasion, requested them to go away, but the seamstress
replied that she was an honest person and refused to move. Schopenhauer disappeared into his
apartments and returned with a stick. According to his own account, he offered his arm to the
woman in order to take her out; but she would not accept it, and remained where she was. He
then threatened to put her out, and carried his threat into execution by seizing her round
the waist and putting her out. She screamed, and attempted to return. Schopenhauer now pushed
her out; the woman fell, and raised the whole house. This woman, Caroline Luise Marquet, brought
an action against him for damages, alleging that he had kicked and beaten her. Schopenhauer
defended his own case, with the result that the action was dismissed. The woman appealed, and
Schopenhauer, who was contemplating going to Switzerland, did not alter his plans, so that
the appeal was heard during his absence, the judgment reversed, and he was mulcted in a fine
of twenty thalers. But the unfortunate business did not end here. Schopenhauer proceeded from
Switzerland to Italy, and did not return to Berlin until May 1825. Caroline Marquet renewed
her complaints before the courts, stating that his ill-usage had occasioned a fever through
which she had lost the power of one of her arms, that her whole system was entirely shaken,
and demanding a monthly allowance as compensation. She won her case; the defendant had to pay
three hundred thalers in costs and contribute sixty thalers a year to her maintenance while
she lived. Schopenhauer on returning to Berlin did what he could to get the judgment reversed,
but unsuccessfully. The woman lived for twenty years; he inscribed on her death certificate,
"Obit anus, obit onus"

The idea of marriage seems to have more or less possessed Schopenhauer about this time, but
he could not finally determine to take the step. There is sufficient to show in the following
essays in what light he regarded women. Marriage was a debt, he said, contracted in youth and
paid off in old age. Married people have the whole burden of life to bear, while the unmarried
have only half, was a characteristically selfish apothegm. Had not all the true philosophers
been celibates--Descartes, Leibnitz, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Kant? The classic writers were
of course not to be considered, because with them woman occupied a subordinate position. Had
not all the great poets married, and with disastrous consequences? Plainly, Schopenhauer was
not the person to sacrifice the individual to the will of the species.

In August 1831 he made a fortuitous expedition to Frankfort-on-the-Main--an expedition partly
prompted by the outbreak of cholera at Berlin at the time, and partly by the portent of a dream
(he was credulous in such matters) which at the beginning of the year had intimated his death.
Here, however, he practically remained until his death, leading a quiet, mechanically regular
life and devoting his thoughts to the development of his philosophic ideas, isolated at first,
but as time went on enjoying somewhat greedily the success which had been denied him in his
earlier days. In February 1839 he had a moment of elation when he heard from the Scientific
Society of Drontheim that he had won the prize for the best essay on the question, "Whether
free will could be proved from the evidence of consciousness," and that he had been elected
a member of the Society; and a corresponding moment of despondency when he was informed by
the Royal Danish Academy of the Sciences at Copenhagen, in a similar competition, that his
essay on "Whether the source and foundation of ethics was to be sought in an intuitive moral
idea, and in the analysis of other derivative moral conceptions, or in some other principle
of knowledge," had failed, partly on the ground of the want of respect which it showed to the
opinions of the chief philosophers. He published these essays in 1841 under the title of "The
Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics," and ten years later Parerga und Paralipomena the composition
of which had engaged his attention for five or six years. The latter work, which proved to
be his most popular, was refused by three publishers, and when eventually it was accepted by
Hayn of Berlin, the author only received ten free copies of his work as payment. It is from
this book that all except one of the following essays have been selected; the exception is
"The Metaphysics of Love," which appears in the supplement of the third book of his principal
work. The second edition of Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung appeared in 1844, and was received
with growing appreciation. Hitherto he had been chiefly known in Frankfort as the son of the
celebrated Johanna Schopenhauer; now he came to have a following which, if at first small in
numbers, were sufficiently enthusiastic, and proved, indeed, so far as his reputation was concerned,
helpful. Artists painted his portrait; a bust of him was made by Elizabeth Ney. In the April
number of the Westminster Review for 1853 John Oxenford, in an article entitled "Iconoclasm
in German Philosophy," heralded in England his recognition as a writer and thinker; three years
later Saint-Ren� Taillandier, in the Revue des Deux Mondes, did a similar service for him in
France. One of his most enthusiastic admirers was Richard Wagner, who in 1854 sent him a copy
of his Der Ring der Nibelungen, with the inscription "In admiration and gratitude." The Philosophical
Faculty of the University of Leipzic offered a prize for an exposition and criticism of his
philosophical system. Two Frenchmen, M. Foucher de Careil and M. Challemel Lacour, who visited
Schopenhauer during his last days, have given an account of their impressions of the interview,
the latter in an article entitled, "Un Bouddhiste Contemporain en Allemagne," which appeared
in the Revue des Deux Mondes for March 15th, 1870. M. Foucher de Careil gives a charming picture
of him:--

  "Quand je le vis, pour la premi�re fois, en 1859, � la table de
  l'h�tel d'Angleterre, � Francfort, c'�tait d�j� un vieillard, � l'oeil
  d'un bleu vif et limpide, � la l�vre mince et l�g�rement sarcastique,
  autour de laquelle errait un fin sourire, et dont le vaste front,
  estomp� de deux touffes de cheveux blancs sur les c�t�s, relevait d'un
  cachet de noblesse et de distinction la physionomie petillante
  d'esprit et de malice. Les habits, son jabot de dentelle, sa cravate
  blanche rappelaient un vieillard de la fin du r�gne de Louis XV; ses
  mani�res �taient celles d'un homme de bonne compagnie. Habituellement
  r�serv� et d'un naturel craintif jusqu'� la m�fiance, il ne se livrait
  qu'avec ses intimes ou les �trangers de passage � Francfort. Ses
  mouvements �taient vifs et devenaient d'une p�tulance extraordinaire
  dans la conversation; il fuyait les discussions et les vains combats
  de paroles, mais c'�tait pour mieux jouir du charme d'une causerie
  intime. Il poss�dait et parlait avec une �gale perfection quatre
  langues: le fran�ais, l'anglais, l'allemand, l'italien et passablement
  l'espagnol. Quand il causait, la verve du vieillard brodait sur le
  canevas un peu lourd de l'allemand ses brilliantes arabesques latines,
  grecques, fran�aises, anglaises, italiennes. C'�tait un entrain, une
  pr�cision et des sailles, une richesse de citations, une exactitude de
  d�tails qui faisait couler les heures; et quelquefois le petit cercle
  de ses intimes l'�coutait jusqu'� minuit, sans qu'un moment de fatigue
  se f�t peint sur ses traits ou que le feu de son regard se f�t un
  instant amorti. Sa parole nette et accentu�e captivait l'auditoire:
  elle peignait et analysait tout ensemble; une sensibilit� d�licate en
  augmentait le feu; elle �tait exacte et pr�cise sur toutes sortes de
  sujets."

Schopenhauer died on the 20th September 1860, in his seventy-third year, peacefully, alone
as he had lived, but not without warning. One day in April, taking his usual brisk walk after
dinner, he suffered from palpitation of the heart, he could scarcely breathe. These symptoms
developed during the next few months, and Dr. Gwinner advised him to discontinue his cold baths
and to breakfast in bed; but Schopenhauer, notwithstanding his early medical training, was
little inclined to follow medical advice. To Dr. Gwinner, on the evening of the 18th September,
when he expressed a hope that he might be able to go to Italy, he said that it would be a pity
if he died now, as he wished to make several important additions to his Parerga; he spoke about
his works and of the warm recognition with which they had been welcomed in the most remote
places. Dr. Gwinner had never before found him so eager and gentle, and left him reluctantly,
without, however, the least premonition that he had seen him for the last time. On the second
morning after this interview Schopenhauer got up as usual, and had his cold bath and breakfast.
His servant had opened the window to let in the morning air and had then left him. A little
later Dr. Gwinner arrived and found him reclining in a corner of the sofa; his face wore its
customary expression; there was no sign of there having been any struggle with death. There
had been no struggle with death; he had died, as he had hoped he would die, painlessly, easily.

In preparing the above notice the writer has to acknowledge her indebtedness to Dr. Gwinner's
Life and Professor Wallace's little work on the same subject, as well as to the few other authorities
that have been available.--THE TRANSLATOR.

ESSAYS OF SCHOPENHAUER.

ON AUTHORSHIP AND STYLE.

There are, first of all, two kinds of authors: those who write for the subject's sake, and
those who write for writing's sake. The first kind have had thoughts or experiences which seem
to them worth communicating, while the second kind need money and consequently write for money.
They think in order to write, and they may be recognised by their spinning out their thoughts
to the greatest possible length, and also by the way they work out their thoughts, which are
half-true, perverse, forced, and vacillating; then also by their love of evasion, so that they
may seem what they are not; and this is why their writing is lacking in definiteness and clearness.

Consequently, it is soon recognised that they write for the sake of filling up the paper, and
this is the case sometimes with the best authors; for example, in parts of Lessing's Dramaturgie,
and even in many of Jean Paul's romances. As soon as this is perceived the book should be thrown
away, for time is precious. As a matter of fact, the author is cheating the reader as soon
as he writes for the sake of filling up paper; because his pretext for writing is that he has
something to impart. Writing for money and preservation of copyright are, at bottom, the ruin
of literature. It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes
anything worth writing. What an inestimable advantage it would be, if, in every branch of literature,
there existed only a few but excellent books! This can never come to pass so long as money
is to be made by writing. It seems as if money lay under a curse, for every author deteriorates
directly he writes in any way for the sake of money. The best works of great men all come from
the time when they had to write either for nothing or for very little pay. This is confirmed
by the Spanish proverb: honra y provecho no caben en un saco (Honour and money are not to be
found in the same purse). The deplorable condition of the literature of to-day, both in Germany
and other countries, is due to the fact that books are written for the sake of earning money.
Every one who is in want of money sits down and writes a book, and the public is stupid enough
to buy it. The secondary effect of this is the ruin of language.

A great number of bad authors eke out their existence entirely by the foolishness of the public,
which only will read what has just been printed. I refer to journalists, who have been appropriately
so-called. In other words, it would be "day labourer."

       *       *       *       *       *

Again, it may be said that there are three kinds of authors. In the first place, there are
those who write without thinking. They write from memory, from reminiscences, or even direct
from other people's books. This class is the most numerous. In the second, those who think
whilst they are writing. They think in order to write; and they are numerous. In the third
place, there are those who have thought before they begin to write. They write solely because
they have thought; and they are rare.

Authors of the second class, who postpone their thinking until they begin to write, are like
a sportsman who goes out at random--he is not likely to bring home very much. While the writing
of an author of the third, the rare class, is like a chase where the game has been captured
beforehand and cooped up in some enclosure from which it is afterwards set free, so many at
a time, into another enclosure, where it is not possible for it to escape, and the sportsman
has now nothing to do but to aim and fire--that is to say, put his thoughts on paper. This
is the kind of sport which yields something.

But although the number of those authors who really and seriously think before they write is
small, only extremely few of them think about the subject itself; the rest think only about
the books written on this subject, and what has been said by others upon it, I mean. In order
to think, they must have the more direct and powerful incentive of other people's thoughts.
These become their next theme, and therefore they always remain under their influence and are
never, strictly speaking, original. On the contrary, the former are roused to thought through
the subject itself, hence their thinking is directed immediately to it. It is only among them
that we find the authors whose names become immortal. Let it be understood that I am speaking
here of writers of the higher branches of literature, and not of writers on the method of distilling
brandy.

It is only the writer who takes the material on which he writes direct out of his own head
that is worth reading. Book manufacturers, compilers, and the ordinary history writers, and
others like them, take their material straight out of books; it passes into their fingers without
its having paid transit duty or undergone inspection when it was in their heads, to say nothing
of elaboration. (How learned many a man would be if he knew everything that was in his own
books!) Hence their talk is often of such a vague nature that one racks one's brains in vain
to understand of what they are really thinking. They are not thinking at all. The book from
which they copy is sometimes composed in the same way: so that writing of this kind is like
a plaster cast of a cast of a cast, and so on, until finally all that is left is a scarcely
recognisable outline of the face of Antinous. Therefore, compilations should be read as seldom
as possible: it is difficult to avoid them entirely, since compendia, which contain in a small
space knowledge that has been collected in the course of several centuries, are included in
compilations.

No greater mistake can be made than to imagine that what has been written latest is always
the more correct; that what is written later on is an improvement on what was written previously;
and that every change means progress. Men who think and have correct judgment, and people who
treat their subject earnestly, are all exceptions only. Vermin is the rule everywhere in the
world: it is always at hand and busily engaged in trying to improve in its own way upon the
mature deliberations of the thinkers. So that if a man wishes to improve himself in any subject
he must guard against immediately seizing the newest books written upon it, in the assumption
that science is always advancing and that the older books have been made use of in the compiling
of the new. They have, it is true, been used; but how? The writer often does not thoroughly
understand the old books; he will, at the same time, not use their exact words, so that the
result is he spoils and bungles what has been said in a much better and clearer way by the
old writers; since they wrote from their own lively knowledge of the subject. He often leaves
out the best things they have written, their most striking elucidations of the matter, their
happiest remarks, because he does not recognise their value or feel how pregnant they are.
It is only what is stupid and shallow that appeals to him. An old and excellent book is frequently
shelved for new and bad ones; which, written for the sake of money, wear a pretentious air
and are much eulogised by the authors' friends. In science, a man who wishes to distinguish
himself brings something new to market; this frequently consists in his denouncing some principle
that has been previously held as correct, so that he may establish a wrong one of his own.
Sometimes his attempt is successful for a short time, when a return is made to the old and
correct doctrine. These innovators are serious about nothing else in the world than their own
priceless person, and it is this that they wish to make its mark. They bring this quickly about
by beginning a paradox; the sterility of their own heads suggests their taking the path of
negation; and truths that have long been recognised are now denied--for instance, the vital
power, the sympathetic nervous system, generatio equivoca, Bichat's distinction between the
working of the passions and the working of intelligence, or they return to crass atomism, etc.,
etc. Hence the course of science is often retrogressive.

To this class of writers belong also those translators who, besides translating their author,
at the same time correct and alter him, a thing that always seems to me impertinent. Write
books yourself which are worth translating and leave the books of other people as they are.
One should read, if it is possible, the real authors, the founders and discoverers of things,
or at any rate the recognised great masters in every branch of learning, and buy second-hand
books rather than read their contents in new ones.

It is true that inventis aliquid addere facile est, therefore a man, after having studied the
principles of his subject, will have to make himself acquainted with the more recent information
written upon it. In general, the following rule holds good here as elsewhere, namely: what
is new is seldom good; because a good thing is only new for a short time.

What the address is to a letter the title should be to a book--that is, its immediate aim should
be to bring the book to that part of the public that will be interested in its contents. Therefore,
the title should be effective, and since it is essentially short, it should be concise, laconic,
pregnant, and if possible express the contents in a word. Therefore a title that is prolix,
or means nothing at all, or that is indirect or ambiguous, is bad; so is one that is false
and misleading: this last may prepare for the book the same fate as that which awaits a wrongly
addressed letter. The worst titles are those that are stolen, such titles that is to say that
other books already bear; for in the first place they are a plagiarism, and in the second a
most convincing proof of an absolute want of originality. A man who has not enough originality
to think out a new title for his book will be much less capable of giving it new contents.
Akin to these are those titles which have been imitated, in other words, half stolen; for instance,
a long time after I had written "On Will in Nature," Oersted wrote "On Mind in Nature."

       *       *       *       *       *

A book can never be anything more than the impression of its author's thoughts. The value of
these thoughts lies either in the matter about which he has thought, or in the form in which
he develops his matter--that is to say, what he has thought about it.

The matter of books is very various, as also are the merits conferred on books on account of
their matter. All matter that is the outcome of experience, in other words everything that
is founded on fact, whether it be historical or physical, taken by itself and in its widest
sense, is included in the term matter. It is the motif that gives its peculiar character to
the book, so that a book can be important whoever the author may have been; while with form
the peculiar character of a book rests with the author of it. The subjects may be of such a
nature as to be accessible and well known to everybody; but the form in which they are expounded,
what has been thought about them, gives the book its value, and this depends upon the author.
Therefore if a book, from this point of view, is excellent and without a rival, so also is
its author. From this it follows that the merit of a writer worth reading is all the greater
the less he is dependent on matter--and the better known and worn out this matter, the greater
will be his merit. The three great Grecian tragedians, for instance, all worked at the same
subject.

So that when a book becomes famous one should carefully distinguish whether it is so on account
of its matter or its form.

Quite ordinary and shallow men are able to produce books of very great importance because of
their matter, which was accessible to them alone. Take, for instance, books which give descriptions
of foreign countries, rare natural phenomena, experiments that have been made, historical events
of which they were witnesses, or have spent both time and trouble in inquiring into and specially
studying the authorities for them.

On the other hand, it is on form that we are dependent, where the matter is accessible to every
one or very well known; and it is what has been thought about the matter that will give any
value to the achievement; it will only be an eminent man who will be able to write anything
that is worth reading. For the others will only think what is possible for every other man
to think. They give the impress of their own mind; but every one already possesses the original
of this impression.

However, the public is very much more interested in matter than in form, and it is for this
very reason that it is behindhand in any high degree of culture. It is most laughable the way
the public reveals its liking for matter in poetic works; it carefully investigates the real
events or personal circumstances of the poet's life which served to give the motif of his works;
nay, finally, it finds these more interesting than the works themselves; it reads more about
Goethe than what has been written by Goethe, and industriously studies the legend of Faust
in preference to Goethe's Faust itself. And when B�rger said that "people would make learned
expositions as to who Leonora really was," we see this literally fulfilled in Goethe's case,
for we now have many learned expositions on Faust and the Faust legend. They are and will remain
of a purely material character. This preference for matter to form is the same as a man ignoring
the shape and painting of a fine Etruscan vase in order to make a chemical examination of the
clay and colours of which it is made. The attempt to be effective by means of the matter used,
thereby ministering to this evil propensity of the public, is absolutely to be censured in
branches of writing where the merit must lie expressly in the form; as, for instance, in poetical
writing. However, there are numerous bad dramatic authors striving to fill the theatre by means
of the matter they are treating. For instance, they place on the stage any kind of celebrated
man, however stripped of dramatic incidents his life may have been, nay, sometimes without
waiting until the persons who appear with him are dead.

The distinction between matter and form, of which I am here speaking, is true also in regard
to conversation. It is chiefly intelligence, judgment, wit, and vivacity that enable a man
to converse; they give form to the conversation. However, the matter of the conversation must
soon come into notice--in other words, that about which one can talk to the man, namely, his
knowledge. If this is very small, it will only be his possessing the above-named formal qualities
in a quite exceptionally high degree that will make his conversation of any value, for his
matter will be restricted to things concerning humanity and nature, which are known generally.
It is just the reverse if a man is wanting in these formal qualities, but has, on the other
hand, knowledge of such a kind that it lends value to his conversation; this value, however,
will then entirely rest on the matter of his conversation, for, according to the Spanish proverb,
mas sabe el necio en su casa, que el sabio en la agena.

A thought only really lives until it has reached the boundary line of words; it then becomes
petrified and dies immediately; yet it is as everlasting as the fossilised animals and plants
of former ages. Its existence, which is really momentary, may be compared to a crystal the
instant it becomes crystallised.

As soon as a thought has found words it no longer exists in us or is serious in its deepest sense.

When it begins to exist for others it ceases to live in us; just as a child frees itself from
its mother when it comes into existence. The poet has also said:

  "Ihr m�sst mich nicht durch Widerspruch verwirren!
  Sobald man spricht, beginnt man schon zu irren."

The pen is to thought what the stick is to walking, but one walks most easily without a stick,
and thinks most perfectly when no pen is at hand. It is only when a man begins to get old that
he likes to make use of a stick and his pen.

A hypothesis that has once gained a position in the mind, or been born in it, leads a life
resembling that of an organism, in so far as it receives from the outer world matter only that
is advantageous and homogeneous to it; on the other hand, matter that is harmful and heterogeneous
to it is either rejected, or if it must be received, cast off again entirely.

Abstract and indefinite terms should be employed in satire only as they are in algebra, in
place of concrete and specified quantities. Moreover, it should be used as sparingly as the
dissecting knife on the body of a living man. At the risk of forfeiting his life it is an unsafe
experiment.

For a work to become immortal it must possess so many excellences that it will not be easy
to find a man who understands and values them all; so that there will be in all ages men who
recognise and appreciate some of these excellences; by this means the credit of the work will
be retained throughout the long course of centuries and ever-changing interests, for, as it
is appreciated first in this sense, then in that, the interest is never exhausted.

An author like this, in other words, an author who has a claim to live on in posterity, can
only be a man who seeks in vain his like among his contemporaries over the wide world, his
marked distinction making him a striking contrast to every one else. Even if he existed through
several generations, like the wandering Jew, he would still occupy the same position; in short,
he would be, as Ariosto has put it, lo fece natura, e poi ruppe lo stampo. If this were not
so, one would not be able to understand why his thoughts should not perish like those of other men.

In almost every age, whether it be in literature or art, we find that if a thoroughly wrong
idea, or a fashion, or a manner is in vogue, it is admired. Those of ordinary intelligence
trouble themselves inordinately to acquire it and put it in practice. An intelligent man sees
through it and despises it, consequently he remains out of the fashion. Some years later the
public sees through it and takes the sham for what it is worth; it now laughs at it, and the
much-admired colour of all these works of fashion falls off like the plaster from a badly-built
wall: and they are in the same dilapidated condition. We should be glad and not sorry when
a fundamentally wrong notion of which we have been secretly conscious for a long time finally
gains a footing and is proclaimed both loudly and openly. The falseness of it will soon be
felt and eventually proclaimed equally loudly and openly. It is as if an abscess had burst.

The man who publishes and edits an article written by an anonymous critic should be held as
immediately responsible for it as if he had written it himself; just as one holds a manager
responsible for bad work done by his workmen. In this way the fellow would be treated as he
deserves to be--namely, without any ceremony.

An anonymous writer is a literary fraud against whom one should immediately cry out, "Wretch,
if you do not wish to admit what it is you say against other people, hold your slanderous tongue."

An anonymous criticism carries no more weight than an anonymous letter, and should therefore
be looked upon with equal mistrust. Or do we wish to accept the assumed name of a man, who
in reality represents a soci�t� anonyme, as a guarantee for the veracity of his friends?
