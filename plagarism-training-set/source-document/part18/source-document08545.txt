THIS POPULAR HISTORY OF OUR INDIAN MAMMALS IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED (BY PERMISSION) TO ONE
WHO TAKES A DEEP INTEREST IN ALL THAT CONCERNS OUR EASTERN EMPIRE, THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL
OF NORTHBROOK, G.C.S.I., LATE GOVERNOR-GENERAL AND VICEROY OF INDIA.

PREFACE.

This work is designed to meet an existing want, viz.: a popular manual of Indian Mammalia.
At present the only work of the kind is one which treats exclusively of the Peninsula of India,
and which consequently omits the more interesting types found in Assam, Burmah, and Ceylon,
as well as the countries bordering the British Indian Empire on the North. The geographical
limits of the present work have been extended to all territories likely to be reached by the
sportsman from India, thus greatly enlarging the field of its usefulness.

The stiff formality of the compiled "Natural Histories" has been discarded, and the Author
has endeavoured to present, in interesting conversational and often anecdotal style, the results
of experience by himself and his personal friends; at the same time freely availing himself
of all the known authorities upon the subject.

NATURAL HISTORY OF THE MAMMALIA OF BRITISH INDIA AND CEYLON.

INTRODUCTION.

In laying before the public the following history of the Indian Mammalia, I am actuated by
the feeling that a popular work on the subject is needed, and would be appreciated by many
who do not care to purchase the expensive books that exist, and who also may be more bothered
than enlightened by over-much technical phraseology and those learned anatomical dissertations
which are necessary to the scientific zoologist.

Another motive in thus venturing is, that the only complete history of Indian Mammalia is Dr.
Jerdon's, which is exhaustive within the boundaries he has assigned to India proper; but as
he has excluded Assam, Cachar, Tenasserim, Burmah, Arracan, and Ceylon, his book is incomplete
as a Natural History of the Mammals of British India. I shall have to acknowledge much to Jerdon
in the following pages, and it is to him I owe much encouragement, whilst we were together
in the field during the Indian Mutiny, in the pursuit of the study to which he devoted his
life; and the general arrangement of this work will be based on his book, his numbers being
preserved, in order that those who possess his 'Mammals of India' may readily refer to the
noted species.

But I must also plead indebtedness to many other naturalists who have left their records in
the 'Journals of the Asiatic Society' and other publications, or who have brought out books
of their own, such as Blyth, Elliott, Hodgson, Sherwill, Sykes, Tickell, Hutton, Kellaart,
Emerson Tennent, and others; Col. McMaster's 'Notes on Jerdon,' Dr. Anderson's 'Anatomical
and Zoological Researches,' Horsfield's 'Catalogue of the Mammalia in the Museum of the East
India Company,' Dr. Dobson's 'Monograph of the Asiatic Chiroptera,' the writings of Professors
Martin Duncan, Flowers, Kitchen Parker, Boyd Dawkins, Garrod, Mr. E. R. Alston, Sir Victor
Brooke and others; the Proceedings and Journals of the Zoological, Linnean, and Asiatic Societies,
and the correspondence in The Asian; so that after all my own share is minimised to a few remarks
here and there, based on personal experience during a long period of jungle life, and on observation
of the habits of animals in their wild state, and also in captivity, having made a large collection
of living specimens from time to time.

As regards classification, Cuvier's system is the most popular, so I shall adopt it to a certain
extent, keeping it as a basis, but engrafting on it such modifications as have met with the
approval of modern naturalists. For comparison I give below a synopsis of Cuvier's arrangement.
I have placed Cetacea after Carnivora, and Edentata at the end. In this I have followed recent
authors as well as Jerdon, whose running numbers I have preserved as far as possible for purposes
of reference.

Cuvier divides the Mammals into nine orders, as follows. (The examples I give are Indian ones,
except where stated otherwise):--

Order I.--BIMANA. Man.

Order II.--QUADRUMANA. Two families--1st, Apes and Monkeys; 2nd, Lemurs.

Order III.--CARNARIA. Three families--1st, Cheiroptera, Bats; 2nd, Insectivora, Hedgehogs,
Shrews, Moles, Tupaiae, &c.; 3rd, Carnivora: Tribe 1, Plantigrades, Bears, Ailurus, Badger,
Arctonyx; 2, Digitigrades, Martens, Weasels, Otters, Cats, Hyaenas, Civets, Musangs, Mongoose,
Dogs, Wolves and Foxes.

Order IV.--MARSUPIATA. Implacental Mammals peculiar to America and Australia, such as Opossums,
Dasyures, Wombats, and Kangaroos. We have none in India.

Order V.--RODENTIA. Squirrels, Marmots, Jerboas, Mole-Rats, Rats, Mice, Voles, Porcupines,
and Hares.

Order VI.--EDENTATA, or toothless Mammals, either partially or totally without teeth. Three
families--1st, Tardigrades, the Sloths, peculiar to America; 2nd, Effodientia, or Burrowers,
of which the Indian type is the Manis, but which includes in other parts of the world the Armadillos
and Anteaters; 3rd, Monotremata, Spiny Anteaters or Echidnas, and the Ornithorynchus.

Order VII.--PACHYDERMATA, or thick-skinned Mammals. Three families--1st, Proboscidians, Elephants;
2nd, Ordinary Pachyderms, Rhinoceroses, Hogs; 3rd, Solidungula, Horses.

Order VIII.--RUMINANTIA, or cud-chewing Mammals. Four families--1st, Hornless Ruminants, Camels,
Musks; 2nd, Cervidae, true horns shed periodically, Deer; 3rd, Persistent horns, Giraffes;

ORDER BIMANA.

Some people have an extreme repugnance to the idea that man should be treated of in connection
with other animals. The development theory is shocking to them, and they would deny that man
has anything in common with the brute creation. This is of course mere sentiment; no history
of nature would be complete without the noblest work of the Creator. The great gulf that separates
the human species from the rest of the animals is the impassable one of intellect. Physically,
he should be compared with the other mammals, otherwise we should lose our first standpoint
of comparison. There is no degradation in this, nor is it an acceptance of the development
theory. To argue that man evolved from the monkey is an ingenious joke which will not bear
the test of examination, and the Scriptural account may still be accepted. I firmly believe
in man as an original creation just as much as I disbelieve in any development of the Flying
Lemur (Galeopithecus) from the Bat, or that the habits of an animal would in time materially
alter its anatomy, as in the case of the abnormal length of the hind toe and nail of the Jacana.
It is not that the habit of running over floating leaves induced the change, but that an all-wise
Creator so fashioned it that it might run on those leaves in search of its food. I accept the
development theory to the extent of the multiplication of species, or perhaps, more correctly,
varieties in genera. We see in the human race how circumstances affect physical appearance.
The child of the ploughman or navvy inherits the broad shoulders and thick-set frame of his
father; and in India you may see it still more forcibly in the difference between Hindu and
Mahomedan races, and those Hindus who have been converted to Mahomedanism. I do not mean isolated
converts here and there who intermarry with pure Mahomedan women, but I mean whole communities
who have in olden days been forced to accept Islam. In a few generations the face assumes an
unmistakable Mahomedan type. It is the difference in living and in thought that effects this
change.

It is the same with animals inhabiting mountainous districts as compared with the same living
in the plains; constant enforced exercise tells on the former, and induces a more robust and
active form.

Whether diet operates in the same degree to effect changes I am inclined to doubt. In man there
is no dental or intestinal difference, whether he be as carnivorous as an Esquimaux or as vegetarian
as a Hindu; whereas in created carnivorous, insectivorous, and herbivorous animals there is
a striking difference, instantly to be recognised even in those of the same family. Therefore,
if diet has operated in effecting such changes, why has it not in the human race?

"Who shall decide when doctors disagree?" is a quotation that may aptly be applied to the question
of the classification of man; Cuvier, Blumenbach, Fischer, Bory St. Vincent, Prichard, Latham,
Morton, Agassiz and others have each a system.

Cuvier recognises only three types--the Caucasian, the Mongolian, and the Negro or Ethiopian,
including Blumenbach's fourth and fifth classes, American and Malay in Mongolian. But even
Cuvier himself could hardly reconcile the American with the Mongol; he had the high cheek-bone
and the scanty beard, it is true, but his eyes and his nose were as Caucasian as could be,
and his numerous dialects had no affinity with the type to which he was assigned.

Fischer in his classification divided man into seven races:--

1st.--Homo japeticus, divided into three varieties--Caucasicus, Arabicus and Indicus.

2nd.--H. Neptunianus, consisting of--1st, the Malays peopling the coasts of the islands of
the Indian Ocean, Madagascar, &c.; 2nd, New Zealanders and Islanders of the Pacific; and, 3rd,
the Papuans.

3rd.--H. Scythicus. Three divisions, viz.: 1st, Calmucks and other Tartars; 2nd, Chinese and
Japanese; and, 3rd, Esquimaux.

4th.--H. Americanus, and

5th.--H. Columbicus, belong to the American Continent.

6th.--H. AEthiopicus. The Negro.

7th.--H. Polynesius. The inland inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, of the Islands of the Indian
Ocean, of Madagascar, New Guinea, New Holland, &c.

I think this system is the one that most commends itself from its clearness, but there are
hardly two writers on ethnology who keep to the same classification.

Agassiz classifies by realms, and has eight divisions.

The Indian races with which we have now to deal are distributed, generally speaking, as follows:--

Caucasian.--(Homo japeticus, Bory and Fischer). Northerly, westerly, and in the Valley of the
Ganges in particular, but otherwise generally distributed over the most cultivated parts of
the Peninsula, comprising the Afghans (Pathans), Sikhs, Brahmins, Rajputs or Kshatryas of the
north-west, the Arabs, Parsees, and Mahrattas of the west coast, the Singhalese of the extreme
south, the Tamils of the east, and the Bengalis of the north-east.

Mongolians (H. Scythicus), inhabiting the chain of mountains to the north, from Little Thibet
on the west to Bhotan on the east, and then sweeping downwards southerly to where Tenasserim
joins the Malay Peninsula. They comprise the Hill Tribes of the N. Himalayas, the Goorkhas
of Nepal, and the Hill Tribes of the north-eastern frontier, viz. Khamtis, Singphos, Mishmis,
Abors, Nagas, Jynteas, Khasyas, and Garos. Those of the northern borders: Bhotias, Lepchas,
Limbus, Murmis and Haioos; of the Assam Valley Kachari, Mech and Koch.

The Malays (H. Neptunianus) Tipperah and Chittagong tribes, the Burmese and Siamese.

Now comes the most difficult group to classify--the aborigines of the interior, and of the
hill ranges of Central India, the Kols, Gonds, Bhils, and others which have certain characteristics
of the Mongolian, but with skins almost as dark as the Negro, and the full eye of the Caucasian.
The main body of these tribes, which I should feel inclined to classify under Fischer's H.
Polynesius, have been divided by Indian ethnologists into two large groups--the Kolarians and
Dravidians. The former comprise the Juangs, Kharrias, Mundas, Bhumij, Ho or Larka Kols, Santals,
Birhors, Korwas, Kurs, Kurkus or Muasis, Bhils, Minas, Kulis. The latter contains the Oraons,
Malers, Paharis of Rajamahal, Gonds and Kands.

The Cheroos and Kharwars, Parheyas, Kisans, Bhuikers, Boyars, Nagbansis, Kaurs, Mars, Bhunyiars,
Bendkars form another great group apart from the Kolarians and Dravidians, and approximating
more to the Indian variety of the Japetic class.

Then there are the extremely low types which one has no hesitation in assigning to the lowest
form of the Polynesian group, such as the Andamanese, the jungle tree-men of Chittagong, Tipperah,
and the vast forests stretching towards Sambhulpur.

On these I would now more particularly dwell as points of comparison with the rest of the animal
kingdom. I have taken but a superficial view of the varieties of the higher types of the human
race in India, for the subject, if thoroughly entered into, would require a volume of no ordinary
dimensions; and those who wish to pursue the study further should read an able paper by Sir
George Campbell in the 'Journal of the Asiatic Society' for June 1866 (vol. xxxv. Part II.),
Colonel Dalton's 'Ethnology of Bengal,' the Rev. S. Hislop's 'Memoranda,' and the 'Report of
the Central Provinces Ethnological Committee.' There is as yet, however, very little reliable
information regarding the wilder forms of humanity inhabiting dense forests, where, enjoying
apparently complete immunity from the deadly malaria that proves fatal to all others, they
live a life but a few degrees removed from the Quadrumana.

I have in my book on the Seonee District described the little colonies in the heart of the
Bison jungles. Clusters of huts imbedded in tangled masses of foliage, surrounded by an atmosphere
reeking with the effluvia of decaying vegetation, where, unheedful of the great outer world
beyond their sylvan limits, the Gonds pass year after year of uneventful lives.

In some of these hamlets I was looked upon with positive awe, as being the first white man
the Baigas had seen. But these simple savages rank high in the scale compared with some others,
of whom we have as yet but imperfect descriptions.

Some years ago Mr. Piddington communicated to the Asiatic Society an account of some "Monkey-men"
he came across on the borders of the Palamow jungle. He was in the habit of employing the aboriginal
tribes to work for him, and on one occasion a party of his men found in the jungle a man and
woman in a state of starvation, and brought them in. They were both very short in stature,
with disproportionately long arms, which in the man were covered with a reddish-brown hair.
They looked almost more like baboons than human beings, and their language was unintelligible,
except that words here and there resembled those in one of the Kolarian dialects. By signs,
and by the help of these words, one of the Dhangars managed to make out that they lived in
the depths of the forest, but had to fly from their people on account of a blood feud. Mr.
Piddington was anxious to send them down to Calcutta, but before he could do so, they decamped
one night, and fled again to their native wilds. Those jungles are, I believe, still in a great
measure unexplored; and, if some day they are opened out, it is to be hoped that the "Monkey-men"
will be again discovered.[1]

[Footnote 1: There has been lately exhibited in London a child from Borneo which has several
points in common with the monkey--hairy face and arms, the hair on the fore-arm being reversed,
as in the apes.]

The lowest type with which we are familiar is the Andamanese, and the wilder sort of these
will hardly bear comparison with even the degraded Australian or African Bosjesman, and approximate
in debasement to the Fuegians.

The Andamanese are small in stature--the men averaging about five feet, the women less. They
are very dark, I may say black, but here the resemblance to the Negro ceases. They have not
the thick lips and flat nose, nor the peculiar heel of the Negro. In habit they are in small
degree above the brutes, architecture and agriculture being unknown. The only arts they are
masters of are limited to the manufacture of weapons, such as spears, bows and arrows, and
canoes. They wear no kind of dress, but, when flies and mosquitoes are troublesome, plaster
themselves with mud. The women are fond of painting themselves with red ochre, which they lay
thickly over their heads, after scraping off the hair with a flint-knife. They swim and dive
like ducks, and run up trees like monkeys. Though affectionate to their children, they are
ruthless to the stranger, killing every one who happens to be cast away on their inhospitable
shores. They have been accused of cannibalism, but this is open to doubt. The bodies of those
they have killed have been found dreadfully mutilated, almost pounded to a jelly, but no portion
had been removed.[2]

[Footnote 2: Since the above was written there has been published in the 'Journal of the Anthropological
Institute,' vol. xii., a most interesting and exhaustive paper on these people by Mr. E. H.
Man, F.R.G.S., giving them credit for much intelligence.]

In the above description I speak of the savage Andamanese in his wild state, and not of the
specimens to be seen at Port Blair, who have become in an infinitesimal degree civilised--that
is to say, to the extent of holding intercourse with foreigners, making some slight additions
to their argillaceous dress-suits, and understanding the principles of exchange and barter--though
as regards this last a friend informs me that they have no notion of a token currency, but
only understand the argumentum ad hominem in the shape of comestibles, so that your bargains,
to be effectual, must be made within reach of a cookshop or grocery. The same friend tells
me he learnt at Port Blair that there were marriage restrictions on which great stress was
laid. This may be the case on the South Island; there is much testimony on the other side as
regards the more savage Andamanese.

The forest tribes of Chittagong are much higher in the scale than the Andamanese, but they
are nevertheless savages of a low type. Captain Lewin says: "The men wear scarcely any clothing,
and the petticoat of the women is scanty, reaching only to the knee; they worship the terrene
elements, and have vague and undefined ideas of some divine power which overshadows all. They
were born and they die for ends to them as incomputable as the path of a cannon-shot fired
into the darkness. They are cruel, and attach but little value to life. Reverence or respect
are emotions unknown to them, they salute neither their chiefs nor their elders, neither have
they any expression conveying thanks." There is, however, much that is interesting in these
wild people, and to those who wish to know more I recommend Captain Lewin's account of 'The
Hill Tracts of Chittagong.'

ORDER QUADRUMANA.

The monkeys of the Indian Peninsula are restricted to a few groups, of which the principal
one is that of the Semnopitheci. These monkeys are distinguished not only by their peculiar
black faces, with a ridge of long stiff black hair projecting forwards over the eyebrows, thin
slim bodies and long tails, but by the absence of cheek pouches, and the possession of a peculiar
sacculated stomach, which, as figured in Cuvier, resembles a bunch of grapes. Jerdon says of
this group that, out of five species found on the continent there is only one spread through
all the plains of Central and Northern India, and one through the Himalayas, whilst there are
three well-marked species in the extreme south of the Peninsula; but then he omits at least
four species inhabiting Chittagong, Tenasserim, Arracan, which also belong to the continent
of India, though perhaps not to the actual Peninsula. Sir Emerson Tennent, in his 'Natural
History of Ceylon,' also mentions and figures three species, of which two are not included
in Jerdon's 'Mammals,' though incidentally spoken of. I propose to add the Ceylon Mammalia
to the Indian, and therefore shall allude to these further on.

The next group of Indian monkeys is that of the Macaques or Magots, or Monkey Baboons of India,
the Lal Bundar of the natives. They have simple stomachs and cheek pouches, which last, I dare
say, most of us have noticed who have happened to give two plantains in succession to one of them.

Although numerically the Langurs or Entellus Monkeys form the most important group of the Quadrumana
in India, yet the Gibbons (which are not included by Jerdon) rank highest in the scale, though
the species are restricted to but three--Hylobates hooluck, H. lar and H. syndactylus. They
are superior in formation (that is taking man as the highest development of the form, to which
some people take objection, though to my way of thinking there is not much to choose between
the highest type of monkey and the lowest of humanity, if we would but look facts straight
in the face), and they are also vastly superior in intellect to either the Langurs or the Macaques,
though inferior perhaps to the Ourangs.

GENUS HYLOBATES--THE GIBBONS,

Which, with the long arms of the Ourangs and the receding forehead of the Chimpanzee, possess
the callosities of the true monkeys, but differ from them in having neither tail nor cheek
pouches. They are true bipeds on the ground, applying the sole of the foot flatly, not, as
Cuvier and others have remarked of the Ourangs, with the outer edge of the sole only, but flat
down, as Blyth, who first mentions it, noticed it, with the thumb or big toe widely separated.

NO. 1. HYLOBATES HOOLUCK. The White-fronted Gibbon.

NATIVE NAMES.--Hooluck, Hookoo.

HABITAT.--Garo and Khasia Hills, Valley of Assam, and Arracan.

DESCRIPTION.--Males deep black, marked with white across the forehead. Females vary from brownish
black to whitish-brown, without, however, the fulvous tint observable in pale specimens of
the next species.

"In general they are paler on the crown, back, and outside of limbs, darker in front, and much
darker on the cheeks and chin."--Blyth.

SIZE.--About two feet.

[Figure: Skull of Hylobates hooluck.]

I think of all the monkey family this Gibbon makes one of the most interesting pets. It is
mild and most docile, and capable of great attachment. Even the adult male has been caught,
and within the short space of a month so completely tamed that he would follow and come to
a call. One I had for a time, some years ago, was a most engaging little creature. Nothing
contented him so much as being allowed to sit by my side with his arm linked through mine,
and he would resist any attempt I made to go away. He was extremely clean in his habits, which
cannot be said of all the monkey tribe. Soon after he came to me I gave him a piece of blanket
to sleep on in his box, but the next morning I found he had rolled it up and made a sort of
pillow for his head, so a second piece was given him. He was destined for the Queen's Gardens
at Delhi, but unfortunately on his way up he got a chill, and contracted a disease akin to
consumption. During his illness he was most carefully tended by my brother, who had a little
bed made for him, and the doctor came daily to see the little patient, who gratefully accepted
his attentions; but, to their disappointment, he died. The only objection to these monkeys
as pets is the power they have of howling, or rather whooping, a piercing and somewhat hysterical
"Whoop-poo! whoop-poo! whoop-poo!" for several minutes, till fairly exhausted.

They are very fond of swinging by their long arms, and walk something like a tipsy sailor.
A friend, resident on the frontiers of Assam, tells me that the full-grown adult pines and
dies in confinement. I think it probable that it may miss a certain amount of insect diet,
and would recommend those who cannot let their pets run loose in a garden to give them raw
eggs and a little minced meat, and a spider or two occasionally.

In its wild state this Gibbon feeds on leaves, insects, eggs and small birds. Dr. Anderson
notices the following as favourite leaves: Moringa pterygosperma (horse-radish tree), Spondias
mangifera (amra), Ficus religiosa (the pipal), also Beta vulgaris; and it is specially partial
to the Ipomoea reptans (the water convolvulus) and the bright-coloured flowers of the Indian
shot (Canna Indica). Of insects it prefers spiders and the Orthoptera; eggs and small birds
are also eagerly devoured.

NO. 2. HYLOBATES LAR. The White-handed Gibbon.

HABITAT.--Arracan, Lower Pegu, Tenasserim, and the Malayan Peninsula.

[Figure: HYLOBATES LAR. HYLOBATES HOOLUCK.]

DESCRIPTION.--"This species is generally recognisable by its pale yellowish, almost white hands
and feet, by the grey, almost white, supercilium, whiskers and beard, and by the deep black
of the rest of the pelage."--Anderson.

SIZE.--About same as H. hooluck.

It is, however, found in every variety of colour, from black to brownish, and variegated with
light-coloured patches, and occasionally of a fulvous white. For a long time I supposed it
to be synonymous with H. agilis of Cuvier, or H. variegatus of Temminck, but both Mr. Blyth
and Dr. Anderson separate it. Blyth mentions a significant fact in distinguishing the two Indian
Gibbons, whatever be their variations of colour, viz.: "H. hooluck has constantly a broad white
frontal band either continuous or divided in the middle, while H. lar has invariably white
hands and feet, less brightly so in some, and a white ring encircling the visage, which is
seldom incomplete."[3]

[Footnote 3: There is an excellent coloured drawing by Wolf of these two Gibbons in the 'Proceedings
of the Zoological Society,' 1870, page 86, from which I have partly adapted the accompanying
sketch.]

H. lar has sometimes the index and middle fingers connected by a web, as in the case of H.
syndactylus (a Sumatran species very distinct in other respects). The very closely allied H.
agilis has also this peculiarity in occasional specimens. This Gibbon was called "agilis" by
Cuvier from its extreme rapidity in springing from branch to branch. Duvaucel says: "The velocity
of its movements is wonderful; it escapes like a bird on the wing. Ascending rapidly to the
top of a tree, it then seizes a flexible branch, swings itself two or three times to gain the
necessary impetus, and then launches itself forward, repeatedly clearing in succession, without
effort and without fatigue, spaces of forty feet."

Sir Stamford Raffles writes that it is believed in Sumatra that it is so jealous that if in
captivity preference be given to one over another, the neglected one will die of grief; and
he found that one he had sickened under similar circumstances and did not recover till his
rival (a Siamang, H. syndactylus) was removed.

NO. 3. HYLOBATES SYNDACTYLUS. The Siamang.

HABITAT.--Tenasserim Province, Sumatra, Malayan Peninsula.

DESCRIPTION.--A more robust and thick-set animal than the two last; deep, woolly, black fur;
no white supercilium nor white round the face. The skull is distinguished from the skull of
the other Gibbons, according to Dr. Anderson, by the greater forward projection of the supraorbital
ridges, and by its much deeper face, and the occipital region more abruptly truncated than
in the other species. The index and middle toes of the foot are united to the last phalange.

SIZE.--About three feet.

This Gibbon is included in the Indian group on the authority of Helfer, who stated it to be
found in the southern parts of the Tenasserim province. Blyth mentions another distinguishing
characteristic--it is not only larger than the other Gibbons, but it possesses an inflatable
laryngeal sac. Its arms are immense--five feet across in an adult of three feet high.

The other species of this genus inhabiting adjacent and other countries are H. Pileatus and
H. leucogenys in Siam; H. leuciscus, Java; H. Mulleri and H. concolor, Borneo.

GENUS PRESBYTES--CUVIER'S GENUS SEMNOPITHECUS.

These monkeys are characterised by their slender bodies and long limbs and tails. Jerdon says
the Germans call them Slim-apes. Other striking peculiarities are the absence of cheek pouches,
which, if present, are but rudimentary. Then they differ from the true monkeys (Cercopithecus)
by the form of the last molar tooth in the lower jaw, which has five tubercles instead of four;
and, finally, they are to be distinguished by the peculiar structure of the stomach, which
is singularly complicated, almost as much so as in the case of Ruminants, which have four divisions.
The stomach of this genus of monkey consists of three divisions: 1st, a simple cardiac pouch
with smooth parietes; 2nd, a wide sacculated middle portion; 3rd, a narrow elongated canal,
sacculated at first, and of simple structure towards the termination. Cuvier from this supposes
it to be more herbivorous than other genera, and considers this conclusion justified by the
blunter tubercles of the molars and greater length of intestines and caecum, all of which point
to a vegetable diet. "The head is round, the face but little produced, having a high facial
angle."--Jerdon.

But the tout ensemble of the Langur is so peculiar that no one who has once been told of a
long, loosed-limbed, slender monkey with a prodigious tail, black face, with overhanging brows
of long stiff black hair, projecting like a pent-house, would fail to recognise the animal.

The Hanuman monkey is reverenced by the Hindus. Hanuman was the son of Pavana, god of the winds;
his strength was enormous, but in attempting to seize the sun he was struck by Indra with a
thunderbolt which broke his jaw (hanu), whereupon his father shut himself up in a cave, and
would not let a breeze cool the earth till the gods had promised his son immortality. Hanuman
aided Rama in his attack upon Ceylon, and by his superhuman strength mountains were torn up
and cast into the sea, so as to form a bridge of rocks across the Straits of Manar.[4]

[Footnote 4: The legend, with native picture, is given in Wilkin's 'Hindoo Mythology.']

The species of this genus of monkey abound throughout the Peninsula. All Indian sportsmen are
familiar with their habits, and have often been assisted by them in tracking a tiger. Their
loud whoops and immense bounds from tree to tree when excited, or the flashing of their white
teeth as they gibber at their lurking foe, have often told the shikari of the whereabouts of
the object of his search. The Langurs take enormous leaps, twenty-five feet in width, with
thirty to forty in a drop, and never miss a branch. I have watched them often in the Central
Indian jungles.

Jerdon's statement that they can run with great rapidity on all-fours is qualified by McMaster,
who easily ran down a large male on horseback on getting him out on a plain.

A correspondent of the Asian, quoting from the Indian Medical Gazette for 1870, states that
experiments with one of this genus (Presbytes entellus) showed that strychnine has no effect
on Langurs--as much as five grains were given within an hour without effect. "From a quarter
to half of a grain will kill a dog in from five to ten minutes, and even one twenty-fourth
of a grain will have a decided tetanic effect in human beings of delicate temperament."--Cooley's
Cycl. Two days after ten grains of strychnine were dissolved in spirits of wine, and mixed
with rum and water, cold but sweet, which the animal drank with relish, and remained unhurt.

The same experiment was tried with one of another genus (Inuus rhesus), who rejected the poisoned
fruit at once, and on having strychnine in solution poured down his throat, died.

The Langur was then tried with cyanide of potassium, which he rejected at once, but on being
forced to take a few grains, was dead in a few seconds.

Although we may not sympathize with those who practise such cruel experiments as these above
alluded to, the facts elucidated are worth recording, and tend to prove the peculiar herbivorous
nature of this genus, which, in common with other strictly herbivorous animals, instinctively
knows what to choose and what to avoid, and can partake, without danger, of some of the most
virulent vegetable poisons. It is possible that in the forests they eat the fruit of the Strychnos
nux-vomica, which is also the favourite food of the pied hornbill (Hydrocissa coronata).

NO. 4. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES ENTELLUS. The Bengal Langur (Jerdon's No. 1).

NATIVE NAMES.--Langur, Hanuman, Hindi; Wanur and Makur, Mahratti; Musya, Canarese.

HABITAT.--Bengal and Central India.

[Figure: Presbytes entellus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Pale dirty or ashy grey; darker on the shoulders and rump; greyish-brown on the
tail; paler on the head and lower parts; hands and feet black.

SIZE.--Length of male thirty inches to root of tail; tail forty-three inches.

The Entellus monkey is in some parts of India deemed sacred, and is permitted by the Hindus
to plunder their grain-shops with impunity; but I think that with increasing hard times the
Hanumans are not allowed such freedom as they used to have, and in most parts of India I have
been in they are considered an unmitigated nuisance, and the people have implored the aid of
Europeans to get rid of their tormentors. In the forest the Langur lives on grain, fruit, the
pods of leguminous trees, and young buds and leaves. Sir Emerson Tennent notices the fondness
of an allied species for the flowers of the red hibiscus (H. rosa sinensis). The female has
usually only one young one, though sometimes twins. The very young babies have not black but
light-coloured faces, which darken afterwards. I have always found them most difficult to rear,
requiring almost as much attention as a human baby. Their diet and hours of feeding must be
as systematically arranged; and if cow's milk be given it must be freely diluted with water--two-thirds
to one-third milk when very young, and afterwards decreased to one-half. They are extremely
susceptible to cold. In confinement they are quiet and gentle whilst young, but the old males
are generally sullen and treacherous. Jerdon says, on the authority of the Bengal Sporting
Magazine (August 1836), that the males live apart from the females, who have only one or two
old males with each colony, and that they have fights at certain seasons, when the vanquished
males receive charge of all the young ones of their own sex, with whom they retire to some
neighbouring jungle. Blyth notices that in one locality he found only males of all ages, and
in another chiefly females. I have found these monkeys mostly on the banks of streams in the
forests of the Central Provinces; in fact, the presence of them anywhere in arid jungles is
a sign that water is somewhere in the vicinity. They are timid creatures, and I have never
seen the slightest disposition about them to show fight, whereas I was once most deliberately
charged by the old males of a party of Rhesus monkeys. I was at the time on field service during
the Mutiny, and, seeing several nursing mothers in the party, tried to run them down in the
open and secure a baby; but they were too quick for me, and, on being attacked by the old males,
I had to pistol the leader.

NO. 5. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES SCHISTACEUS.[5] The Himalayan Langur (Jerdon's No. 2).

[Footnote 5: Mr. J. Cockburn, of the Imperial Museum, has, since I wrote about the preceding
species, given me some interesting information regarding the geographical distribution of Presbytes
entellus and Hylobates hooluck. He says: "The latter has never been known to occur on the north
bank of the Brahmaputra, though swarming in the forests at the very water's edge on the south
bank. The entellus monkey is also not found on the north bank of the Ganges, and attempts at
its introduction have repeatedly failed." P. schistaceus replaces it in the Sub-Himalayan forests.]

NATIVE NAMES.--Langur, Hindi; Kamba Suhu, Lepcha; Kubup, Bhotia.

HABITAT.--The whole range of the Himalayas from Nepal to beyond Simla.

DESCRIPTION (after Hodgson).--Dark slaty above; head and lower parts pale yellowish; hands
concolorous with body, or only a little darker; tail slightly tufted; hair on the crown of
the head short and radiated; on the cheeks long, directed backwards, and covering the ears.
Hutton's description is, dark greyish, with pale hands and feet, white head, dark face, white
throat and breast, and white tip to the tail.

SIZE.--About thirty inches; tail, thirty-six inches.

Captain Hutton, writing from Mussoorie, says: "On the Simla side I observed them also, leaping
and playing about, while the fir-trees, among which they sported, were loaded with snow-wreaths,
at an elevation of 11,000 feet."--'Jour. As. Soc. Beng.' xiii. p. 471.

Dr. Anderson remarks on the skull of this species, that it can be easily distinguished from
entellus by its larger size, the supraorbital ridge being less forwardly projected, and not
forming so thick and wide a pent roof, but the most marked difference lies in the much longer
facial portion of schistaceus; the teeth are also larger; the symphysis or junction of the
lower jaw is considerably longer and broader, and the lower jaw itself is generally more massive
and deep.

NO. 6. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES PRIAMUS. The Madras Langur.

NATIVE NAME.--Gandangi, Telugu.

HABITAT.--The Coromandel Coast and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Ashy grey, with a pale reddish or chocolat-au-lait tint overlying the whole back
and head; sides of the head, chin, throat, and beneath pale yellowish; hands and feet whitish;
face, palms and fingers, and soles of feet and toes black; hair long and straight, not wavy;
tail of the colour of the darker portion of the back, ending in a whitish tuft.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--About the same as P. entellus.

Blyth, who is followed by Jerdon, describes this monkey as having a compressed high vertical
crest, but Dr. Anderson found that the specimens in the Indian Museum owed these crests to
bad stuffing. Kellaart, however, mentions it, and calls the animal "the Crested Monkey." In
Sir Emerson Tennent's figure of P. priamus a slight crest is noticeable; but Kellaart is very
positive on this point, saying: "P. priamus is easily distinguished from all other known species
of monkeys in Ceylon by its high compressed vertical crest."

Jerdon says this species is not found on the Malabar Coast, but neither he nor McMaster give
much information regarding it.

In these particulars this species resembles P. entellus.

NO. 7. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES JOHNII. The Malabar Langur (Jerdon's No. 4).

HABITAT.--The Malabar Coast, from N. Lat. 14 degrees or 15 degrees to Cape Comorin.

DESCRIPTION.--Above dusky brown, slightly paling on the sides; crown, occiput, sides of head
and beard fulvous, darkest on the crown; limbs and tail dark brown, almost black; beneath yellowish
white.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Not quite so large as P. entellus.

This monkey was named after a member of the Danish factory at Tranquebar, M. John, who first
described it. It abounds in forests, and does not frequent villages, though it will visit gardens
and fields, where, however, it shuns observation.

The young are of a sooty brown, or nearly black, without any indication of the light-coloured
hood of the adult.

NO. 8. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES JUBATUS. The Nilgheri Langur (Jerdon's No. 5).

HABITAT.--The Nilgheri Hills, the Animallies, Pulneys, the Wynaad, and all the higher parts
of the range of the Ghats as low as Travancore.

DESCRIPTION.--Dark glossy black throughout, except head and nape, which are reddish brown;
hair very long; in old individuals a greyish patch on the rump.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Length of head and body, 26 inches; tail, 30.

This monkey does not, as a rule, descend lower than 2,500 to 3,000 feet; it is shy and wary.
The fur is fine and glossy, and is much prized (Jerdon). Its flesh is excellent food for dogs
(McMaster).

Dr. Anderson makes this synonymous with the last.

NO. 9. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES PILEATUS. The Capped Langur.

HABITAT.--Assam, Chittagong, Tipperah.

DESCRIPTION.--General colour dark ashy grey, with a slight ferruginous tint; darker near head
and on shoulders; underneath and on the inside of the limbs pale yellowish, with a darker shade
of orange or golden yellow on the breast and belly. The crown of the head is densely covered
with bristly hairs, regularly disposed and somewhat elongated on the vertex so as to resemble
a cap, whence the name. Along the forehead is a superciliary crest of long black bristles,
directed outwardly; whiskers full and down to the chin: behind the ears is a small tuft of
white hairs; the tail is long, one third longer than the body, darker near the end, and tufted;
fingers and toes black.

SIZE.--A little smaller than P. entellus.

This monkey is found in Northern Assam, Tipperah and southwards to Tenasserim; in Blyth's 'Catalogue
of the Mammals of Burmah' it is mentioned as P. chrysogaster (Semnopithecus potenziani of Bonaparte
and Peters). He writes of it: "Females and young have the lower parts white, or but faintly
tinted with ferruginous, and the rest of the coat is of a pure grey; the face black, and there
is no crest, but the hairs of the crown are so disposed as to appear like a small flat cap
laid upon the top of the head. The old males seem always to be of a deep rust-colour on the
cheeks, lower parts, and more or less on the outer side of the limbs; while in old females
this rust colour is diluted or little more than indicated."

Dr. Anderson says that a young one he had was of a mild disposition, which however is not the
character of the adult animal, which is uncertain, and the males when irritated are fierce,
and determined in attack. No rule, however, is without its exception, for one adult male, possessed
by Blyth, is reported as having been an exceeding gentle animal.

NO. 10. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES BARBEI. The Tipperah Langur.

HABITAT.--Tipperah, Tenasserim.

DESCRIPTION.--No vertical crest of hair on the head, nor is the occipital hair directed downwards,
as in the next species. Shoulders and outside of arm silvered; tail slightly paler than body,
"which is of a blackish fuliginous hue."

More information is required about this monkey, which was named by Blyth after its donor to
the Asiatic Society, the Rev. J. Barbe. Blyth considered it as distinct from P. Phayrei and
P. obscurus, which last is from Malacca.

Dr. Anderson noticed it in the valley of the Tapeng in the centre of the Kakhyen Hills, in
troops of thirty to fifty, in high forest trees overhanging the mountain streams. Being seldom
disturbed, they permitted a near approach.

NO. 11. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES PHAYREI. Syn.--SEMNOPITHECUS CRISTATUS. The Silvery-Leaf
Monkey (Blyth).

HABITAT.--Arracan, Malayan Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo.

DESCRIPTION.-Colour dusky grey-brown above, more or less dark, with black hands and feet; a
conspicuous crest on the vertex; under parts white, scarcely extending to the inside of the
limbs; sides grey like the back; whiskers dark, very long, concealing the ears in front; lips
and eyelids conspicuously white, with white moustachial hairs above and similar hairs below.

SIZE.--Two feet; tail, 2 feet 6 inches.

This monkey was named by Blyth after Captain (now Sir Arthur) Phayre, who first brought it
to his notice; but he afterwards reconciled it as being synonymous with Semnopithecus cristatus.
The colouring, according to different authors, seems to vary considerably, which causes some
confusion in description. It differs from an allied species, S. maurus, in selecting low marshy
situations near the banks of streams. Its favourite food is the fruit of the Nibong palm (Oncosperma
filamentosa).

NO. 12. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES OBSCURUS. The Dusky-Leaf Monkey.

HABITAT.--Mergui and the Malayan Peninsula.

DESCRIPTION.--Adults ashy or brownish black, darker on forehead, sides of face, shoulder, and
sides of body; the hair on the nape is lengthened and whitish. The newly-born young are of
a golden ferruginous colour, which afterward changes to dusky-ash colour, the terminal half
of the tail being last to change; the mouth and eyelids are whitish, but the rest of the face
black.

SIZE.--Body, 1 foot 9 inches; tail, 2 feet 8 inches.

This monkey is most common in the Malayan Peninsula, but has been found to extend to Mergui,
where Blyth states it was procured by the late Major Berdmore. Dr. Anderson says it is not
unfrequently offered for sale in the Singapore market.

NO. 13. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES CEPHALOPTERUS. The Ceylon Langur.

NATIVE NAME.--Kallu Wanderu.

HABITAT.--The low lands of Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--General colour cinereous black; croup and inside of thighs whitish; head rufescent
brown; hair on crown short, semi-erect; occipital hairs long, albescent; whiskers white, thick
and long, terminating at the chin in a short beard, and laterally angularly pointed; upper
lip thinly fringed with white hairs; superciliary hairs black, long, stiff and standing erect;
tail albescent and terminating in a beard tuft; face, palms, soles, fingers, toes and callosities
black; irides brown.--Kellaart.

SIZE.--Length, 20 inches; tail 24 inches.

Sir E. Tennent says of this monkey that it is never found at a higher elevation than 1,300
feet (when it is replaced by the next species).

NO. 14. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES URSINUS. The Great Wanderu.

NATIVE NAME.--Maha Wanderu.

HABITAT.--The mountainous district of Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur long, almost uniformly greyish black; whiskers full and white; occiput and
croup in old specimens paler coloured; hands and feet blackish; tail long, getting lighter
towards the lower half. The young and adults under middle age have a rufous tint, corresponding
with that of the head of all ages.

SIZE.--Body about 22 inches; tail, 26 inches.

The name Wanderu is a corruption of the Singhalese generic word for monkey, Ouandura, or Wandura,
which bears a striking resemblance to the Hindi Bandra, commonly called Bandar--b and v being
interchangeable--and is evidently derived from the Sanscrit Banur, which in the south again
becomes Wanur, and further south, in Ceylon, Wandura. There has been a certain amount of confusion
between this animal and Inuus silenus, the lion monkey, which had the name Wanderu applied
to it by Buffon, and it is so figured in Cuvier. They are both large monkeys, with great beards
of light coloured hair, but in no other respect do they resemble. This was written in 1861;
since then much of the mountainous forest land has been cleared for coffee-planting, and the
Wanderu either driven into corners or become more familiarised with man. More therefore must
be known of its habits by this time, and information regarding it is desirable.

NO. 15. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES THERSITES.

NATIVE NAME.--Ellee Wanderu (Kellaart).

HABITAT.--Ceylon.

[Figure: Presbytes thersites.]

DESCRIPTION.--Chiefly distinguished from the others by wanting the head tuft; uniform dusky
grey, darker on crown and fore-limbs; slaty brown on wrists and hands; hair on toes whitish;
whiskers and beard largely developed and conspicuously white.

The name was given by Blyth to a single specimen forwarded by Dr. Templeton, and it was for
a time doubtful whether it was really a native, till Dr. Kellaart procured a second.

Dr. Anderson considers this monkey as identical with Semnopithecus priamus, but Kellaart, as
I have before stated, is very positive on the point of difference, calling S. priamus emphatically
the crested monkey, and alleging that thersites has no crest, and it is probable he had opportunities
of observing the two animals in life; he says he had a young specimen of priamus, which distinctly
showed the crest, and a young thersites of the same age which showed no sign of it.

In Emerson Tennent's 'Natural History of Ceylon,' (1861) page 5, there is a plate of a group
in which are included priamus and thersites; in the original they are wrongly numbered--the
former should be 2 and not 3, and the latter 3 and not 2. If these be correct (and Wolf's name
should be a voucher for their being so) there is a decided difference. There is no crest in
the latter, and the white whiskers terminate abruptly on a level with the eyebrow, and the
superciliary ridge of hair is wanting.

NO. 16. SEMNOPITHECUS vel PRESBYTES ALBINUS (Kellaart). The White Langur.

HABITAT.--Ceylon, in the hills beyond Matelle.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur dense, sinuous, nearly of uniform white colour, with only a slight dash of
grey on the head; face and ears black; palm, soles, fingers and toes flesh-coloured; limbs
and body the shape of P. ursinus; long white hairs prolonged over the toes and claws, giving
the appearance of a white spaniel dog to this monkey; irides brown; whiskers white, full, and
pointed laterally.--Kellaart.

The above description was taken by Dr. Kellaart from a living specimen. He considered it to
be a distinct species, and not an Albino, from the black face and ears and brown eyes.

The Kandyans assured him that they were to be seen (rarely however) in small parties of three
and four over the hills beyond Matelle, but never in company with the dark kind. An old writer
of the seventeenth century, Knox, says of the monkeys of Ceylon (where he was captive for some
time) that there are some "milk-white in body and face, but of this sort there is not such
plenty."--Tennent's 'Natural History of Ceylon,' page 8.

NOTE.--Since the above was in type I have found in the List of Animals in the Zoological Society's
Gardens, a species entered as Semnopithecus leucoprymnus, the Purple-faced Monkey from Ceylon--see
P.Z.S.

PAPIONINAE.

This sub-family comprises the true baboons of Africa and the monkey-like baboons of India.
They have the stomach simple, and cheek-pouches are always present. According to Cuvier they
possess, like the last family, a fifth tubercle on their last molars. They produce early, but
are not completely adult for four or five years; the period of gestation is seven months.

The third sub-family of Simiadae consists of the genera Cercopithicus, Macacus, and Cynocephalus,
as generally accepted by modern zoologists, but Jerdon seems to have followed Ogilby in his
classification, which merges the long-tailed Macaques into Cercopithecus, and substituting
Papio for the others.

GENUS INUUS.

Cuvier applies this term to the Magots or rudimentary-tailed Macaques. The monkeys of this
genus are more compactly built than those of the last. They are also less herbivorous in their
diet, eating frogs, lizards, crabs and insects, as well as vegetables and fruit. Their callosities
and cheek-pouches are large, and they have a sac which communicates with the larynx under the
thyroid cartilage, which fills with air when they cry out.

Some naturalists of the day, however, place all under the generic name Macacus.

NO. 17. INUUS vel MACACUS SILENUS. The Lion Monkey (Jerdon's No. 6).

NATIVE NAMES.--Nil bandar, Bengali; Shia bandar, Hindi; Nella manthi, Malabari.

HABITAT.--The Western Ghats of India from North Lat. 14 degrees to the extreme south, but most
abundant in Cochin and Travancore (Jerdon), also Ceylon (Cuvier and Horsfield), though not
confirmed by Emerson Tennent, who states that the silenus is not found in the island except
as introduced by Arab horse-dealers occasionally, and that it certainly is not indigenous.
Blyth was also assured by Dr. Templeton of Colombo that the only specimens there were imported.

[Figure: Macacus silenus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Black, with a reddish-white hood or beard surrounding the face and neck; tail
with a tuft of whitish hair at the tip; a little greyish on the chest.

SIZE.--About 24 inches; tail, 10 inches.

There is a plate of this monkey in Carpenter and Westwood's edition of Cuvier, under the mistaken
name of Wanderoo.

It is somewhat sulky and savage, and is difficult to get near in a wild state. Jerdon states
that he met with it only in dense unfrequented forest, and sometimes at a considerable elevation.
It occurs in troops of from twelve to twenty.

NO. 18. INUUS vel MACACUS RHESUS. The Bengal Monkey (Jerdon's No. 7).

NATIVE NAMES.--Bandar, Hindi; Markot, Bengali; Suhu, Lepcha, Piyu, Bhotia.

HABITAT.--India generally from the North to about Lat. 18 degrees or 19 degrees; but not in
the South, where it is replaced by Macacus radiatus.

[Figure: Macacus rhesus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Above brownish ochrey or rufous; limbs and beneath ashy-brown; callosities and
adjacent parts red; face of adult males red.

SIZE.--Twenty-two inches; tail 11 inches.

This monkey is too well-known to need description. It is the common acting monkey of the bandar-wallas,
the delight of all Anglo-Indian children, who go into raptures over the romance of Munsur-ram
and Chameli, their quarrels, parting, and reconciliation, so admirably acted by these miniature
comedians.

NOTE.--For Macacus rheso-similis, Sclater, see P.Z.S. 1872, p. 495, pl. xxv., also P.Z.S. 1875,
p. 418.

NO. 19. INUUS vel MACACUS PELOPS. Syn.--MACACUS ASSAMENSIS. The Hill Monkey (Jerdon's No. 8).

HABITAT.--The Himalayan ranges and Assam.

DESCRIPTION.--Brownish grey, somewhat mixed with slaty, and rusty brownish on the shoulders
in some; beneath light ashy brown; fur fuller and more wavy than in rhesus; canine teeth long;
of stout habit; callosities and face less red than in the last species (Jerdon). Face flesh-coloured,
but interspersed with a few black hairs (McClelland).

NO. 20. INUUS vel MACACUS NEMESTRINUS. The Pig-tailed Monkey.

HABITAT.--Tenasserim and the Malay Archipelago.

[Figure: Macacus nemestrinus.]

DESCRIPTION.--General colour grizzled brown; the piles annulated with dusky and fulvous; crown
darker, and the middle of the back also darker; the hair lengthened on the fore-quarters; the
back stripe extends along the tail, becoming almost black; the tail terminates in a bright
ferruginous tuft. This monkey is noted for its docility, and in Bencoolen is trained to be
useful as well as amusing. According to Sir Stamford Raffles it is taught to climb the cocoa
palms for the fruit for its master, and to select only those that are ripe.

NO. 21. INUUS vel MACACUS LEONINUS. The Long-haired Pig-tailed Monkey.

HABITAT.--Arracan.

DESCRIPTION.--A thick-set powerful animal, with a broad, rather flattened head above, and a
moderately short, well clad, up-turned tail, about one-third the length of the body and head;
the female smaller.--Anderson.

Face fleshy brown; whitish round the eyes and on the forehead; eyebrows brownish, a narrow
reddish line running out from the external angle of the eye. The upper surface of the head
is densely covered with short dark fur, yellowish brown, broadly tipped with black; the hair
radiating from the vertex; on and around the ear the hair is pale grey; above the external
orbital angle and on the sides of the face the hair is dense and directed backwards, pale greyish,
obscurely annulated with dusky brown, and this is prolonged downwards to the middle of the
throat. On the shoulders, back of the neck, and upper part of the thighs, the hairs are very
long, fully three inches in the first-mentioned localities; the basal halves greyish; and the
remainder ringed with eleven bands of dark brown and orange; the tips being dark. The middle
and small of the back is almost black, the shorter hair there being wholly dark; and this colour
is prolonged on the tail, which is tufted. The hair on the chest is annulated, but paler than
on the shoulders, and it is especially dense on the lower part. The lower halves of the limbs
are also well clad with annulated fur, like their outsides, but their upper halves internally
and the belly are only sparsely covered with long brownish grey plain hairs, not ringed.

The female differs from the male in the absence of the black on the head and back, and in the
hair of the under parts being brownish grey, without annulations. The shoulders somewhat brighter
than the rest of the fur, which is yellowish olive; greyish olive on outside of limbs; dusky
on upper surface of hands and feet; and black on upper surface of tail.

SIZE.--Length of male, head and body 23 inches; tail, without hair, 8 inches; with hair 10 inches.

The above description is taken from Dr. Anderson's account, 'Anat. and Zool. Res.,' where at
page 54 will be found a plate of the skull showing the powerful canine teeth. Blyth mentions
a fine male with hair on the shoulders four to five inches long.

NO. 22. INUUS vel MACACUS ARCTOIDES. The Brown Stump-tailed Monkey.

HABITAT.--Cachar, Kakhyen Hills, east of Bhamo.

DESCRIPTION.--Upper surface of head and along the back dark brown, almost blackish; sides and
limbs dark brown; the hair, which is very long, is ringed with light yellowish and dark brown,
darker still at the tips; face red; tail short and stumpy, little over an inch long.

This monkey is one over which many naturalists have argued; it is synonymous with Macacus speciosus,
M. maurus, M. melanotus, and was thought to be with M. brunneus till Dr. Anderson placed the
latter in a separate species on account of the non-annulation of its hair. It is essentially
a denizen of the hills; it has been obtained in Cachar and in Upper Assam. Dr. Anderson got
it in the Kakhyen Hills on the frontier of Yunnan, beyond which, he says, it spreads to the
southeast to Cochin-China.

NO. 23. INUUS vel MACACUS THIBETANUS. The Thibetan Stump-tailed Monkey.

DESCRIPTION.--Head large and whiskered; form robust; tail stumpy and clad; general colour of
the animal brown; whiskers greyish; face nude and flesh-coloured, with a deep crimson flush
round the eyes.

SIZE.--Two feet 9 inches; tail about 3 inches.

This large monkey, though not belonging to British India, inhabiting, it is said, "the coldest
and least accessible forests of Eastern Thibet," is mentioned here, as the exploration of that
country by travellers from India is attracting attention.

GENUS MACACUS.

Tail longer than in Inuus, and face not so lengthened; otherwise as in that genus.--Jerdon.

NO. 24. MACACUS RADIATUS. The Madras Monkey (Jerdon's No. 9).

NATIVE NAMES.--Bandar, Hindi; Makadu or Wanur, Mahratti; Kerda mahr of the Ghats; Munga, Canarese;
Koti, Telegu; Vella munthi, Malabar.

HABITAT.--All over the southern parts of India, as far north as lat. 18 degrees.

[Figure: Macacus radiatus and Macacus pileatus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Of a dusky olive brown, paler and whitish underneath, ashy on outer sides of
limbs; tail dusky brown above, whitish beneath; hairs on the crown of the head radiated.

SIZE.--Twenty inches; tail 15 inches.

Elliott remarks of this monkey that it inhabits not only the wildest jungles, but the most
populous towns, and it is noted for its audacity in stealing fruit and grain from shops. Jerdon
says: "It is the monkey most commonly found in menageries, and led about to show various tricks
and feats of agility. It is certainly the most inquisitive and mischievous of its tribe, and
its powers of mimicry are surpassed by none." It may be taught to turn a wheel regularly; it
smokes tobacco without inconvenience.--Horsfield.

NO. 25. MACACUS PILEATUS (vel SINICUS, Lin.). The Capped Monkey, or Bonneted Macaque of Cuvier.

NATIVE NAME.--Rilawa, Singhalese.

HABITAT.--Ceylon and China.

DESCRIPTION.--Yellowish brown, with a slight shade of green in old specimens; in some the back
is light chestnut brown; yellowish brown hairs on the crown of the head, radiating from the
centre to the circumference; face flesh-coloured and beardless; ears, palms, soles, fingers,
and toes blackish; irides reddish brown; callosities flesh-coloured; tail longish, terminating
in short tuft.--Kellaart.

SIZE.--Head and body about 20 inches; tail 18 inches.

This is the Macacus sinicus of Cuvier, and is very similar to the last species. It also, like
the last, smokes tobacco; and one that belonged to the captain of a tug steamer, in which I
once went down from Calcutta to the Sandheads, not only smoked, but chewed tobacco. Kellaart
says of it: "This monkey is a lively, spirited animal, but easily tamed; particularly fond
of making grimaces, with which it invariably welcomes its master and friends. It is truly astonishing
to see the large quantity of food it will cram down its cheek pouches for future mastication."

NO. 26. MACACUS CYNOMOLGUS. The Crab-eating Macaque.

NATIVE NAME.--Kra, Malay.

HABITAT.--Tenasserim, Nicobars, Malay Archipelago.

[Figure: Macacus cynomolgus.]

DESCRIPTION.--"The leading features of this animal are its massive form, its large head closely
set on the shoulders, its stout and rather short legs, its slender loins and heavy buttocks,
its tail thick at the base" (Anderson). The general colour is similar to that of the Bengal
rhesus monkey, but the skin of the chest and belly is bluish, the face livid, with a white
area between the eyes and white eyelids. Hands and feet blackish.

SIZE.--About that of the Bengal rhesus.

According to Captain (now Sir Arthur) Phayre "these monkeys frequent the banks of salt-water
creeks and devour shell-fish. In the cheek-pouch of the female were found the claws and body
of a crab. There is not much on record concerning the habits of this monkey in its wild state
beyond what is stated concerning its partiality for crabs, which can also, I believe, be said
of the rhesus in the Bengal Sunderbunds."

NO. 27. MACACUS CARBONARIUS. The Black-faced Crab-eating Monkey.

HABITAT.--Burmah.

DESCRIPTION.--In all respects the same as the last, except that its face is blackish, with
conspicuously white eyelids.

FAMILY LEMURIDAE.

The Indian members of this family belong to the sub-family named by Geoffroy Nycticebinae.

NATIVE NAME.--Sharmindi billi, Hindi.

HABITAT.--Eastern Bengal, Assam, Garo Hills, Sylhet, Arracan.--Horsfield.

[Figure: Loris gracilis and Nycticebus tardigradus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Dark ashy grey, with a darker band down middle of back, beneath lighter grey;
forehead in some dark, with a narrow white stripe between the eyes, disappearing above them;
ears and round the eye dark; tail very short.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Length about 14 to 15 inches; tail 5/8 of an inch.

Nocturnal in its habits; sleeping during the day in holes of trees, and coming out to feed
at night. Sir William Jones describes one kept by him for some time; it appeared to have been
gentle, though at times petulant when disturbed; susceptible of cold; slept from sunrise to
sunset rolled up like a hedgehog. Its food was chiefly plantains, and mangoes when in season.
Peaches, mulberries, and guavas, it did not so much care for, but it was most eager after grasshoppers,
which it devoured voraciously. It was very particular in the performance of its toilet, cleaning
and licking its fur. Cuvier also notices this last peculiarity, and with regard to its diet
says it eats small birds as well as insects. These animals are occasionally to be bought in
the Calcutta market. A friend of mine had a pair which were a source of great amusement to
his guests after dinner. (See Appendix C, p.526.)

GENUS LORIS.

Body and limbs slender; no tail; eyes very large, almost contiguous; nose acute.

NO. 29. LORIS GRACILIS. The Slender Lemur (Jerdon's No. 11).

NATIVE NAMES.--Tevangar, Tamil; Dewantsipilli, Telegu. (Oona happslava, Singhalese.--Kellaart.)

HABITAT.--Southern India and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Above greyish rufescent (tawny snuff brown: Kellaart); beneath a paler shade;
a white triangular spot on forehead, extending down the nose; fur short, dense, and soft; ears
thin, rounded (Jerdon). A hooped claw on inner toes; nails of other toes flat; posterior third
of palms and soles hairy (Kellaart).

SIZE.--About 8 inches; arm, 5; leg, 5-1/2.

This, like the last, is also nocturnal in its habits, and from the extreme slowness of its
movements is called in Ceylon "the Ceylon sloth." Its diet is varied--fruit, flower, and leaf
buds, insects, eggs, and young birds. Sir Emerson Tennent says the Singhalese assert that it
has been known to strangle pea-fowl at night and feast on the brain, but this I doubt. Smaller
birds it might overcome. Jerdon states that in confinement it will eat boiled rice, plantains,
honey or syrup and raw meat. McMaster, at page 6 of his 'Notes on Jerdon,' gives an interesting
extract from an old account of 'Dr. John Fryer's Voyage to East India and Bombain,' in which
he describes this little animal as "Men of the Woods, or more truly Satyrs;" asleep during
the day; but at "Night they Sport and Eat." "They had Heads like an owl. Bodied like a monkey
without Tails. Only the first finger of the Right Hand was armed with a claw like a bird, otherwise
they had hands and feet which they walk upright on, not pronely, as other Beasts do."

These little creatures double themselves up when they sleep, bending the head down between
their legs. Although so sluggish generally, Jerdon says they can move with considerable agility
when they choose.

SUB-ORDER PLEUROPTERA.--FAMILY GALAEOPITHECIDAE.

There is a curious link between the Lemurs and the Bats in the Colugos. (Galaeopithecus): their
limbs are connected with a membrane as in the Flying Squirrels, by which they can leap and
float for a hundred yards on an inclined plane. They are mild, inoffensive animals, subsisting
on fruits and leaves. Cuvier places them after the Bats, but they seem properly to link the
Lemurs and the frugivorous Bats. As yet they have not been found in India proper, but are common
in the Malayan Peninsula, and have been found in Burmah.

NO. 30. GALAEOPITHECUS VOLANS. The Flying Lemur.

NATIVE NAME.--Myook-hloung-pyan, Burmese.

HABITAT.--Mergui; the Malayan Peninsula.

[Figure: Galaeopithecus volans.]

DESCRIPTION.--Fur olive brown, mottled with irregular whitish spots and blotches; the pile
is short, but exquisitely soft; head and brain very small; tail long and prehensile. The membrane
is continued from each side of the neck to the fore feet; thence to the hind feet, again to
the tip of the tail. This animal is also nocturnal in its habits, and very sluggish in its
motions by day, at which time it usually hangs from a branch suspended by its fore hands, its
mottled back assimilating closely with the rugged bark of the tree; it is exclusively herbivorous,
possessing a very voluminous stomach, and long convoluted intestines. Wallace says of it, that
its brain is very small, and it possesses such tenacity of life that it is very difficult to
kill; he adds that it is said to have only one at a birth, and one he shot had a very small
blind naked little creature clinging closely to its breast, which was quite bare and much wrinkled.
Raffles, however, gives two as the number produced at each birth. Dr. Cantor says that in confinement
plantains constitute the favourite food, but deprived of liberty it soon dies. In its wild
state it "lives entirely on young fruits and leaves; those of the cocoanut and Bombax pentandrum
are its favourite food, and it commits great injury to the plantations of these."--Horsfield's
'Cat. Mam.' Regarding its powers of flight, Wallace, in his 'Travels in the Malay Archipelago,'
says: "I saw one of these animals run up a tree in a rather open space, and then glide obliquely
through the air to another tree on which it alighted near its base, and immediately began to
ascend. I paced the distance from one tree to the other, and found it to be seventy yards,
and the amount of descent not more than thirty-five or forty feet, or less than one in five.
This, I think, proves that the animal must have some power of guiding itself through the air,
otherwise in so long a distance it would have little chance of alighting exactly upon the trunk."

There is a carefully prepared skeleton of this animal in the Indian Museum in Calcutta.

ORDER CARNARIA.

CHEIROPTERA.

It may seem strange to many that such an insignificant, weird little creature as a bat should
rank so high in the animal kingdom as to be but a few removes from man. It has, however, some
striking anatomical affinities with the last Order, Quadrumana, sufficient to justify its being
placed in the next link of the great chain of creation.

[Figure: Sternum of Pteropus.]

"Bats have the arms, fore-arms and fingers excessively elongated, so as to form with the membrane
that occupies their intervals, real wings, the surface of which is equally or more extended
than in those of birds. Hence they fly high and with great rapidity."--Cuvier. They suckle
their young at the breast, but some of them have pubic warts resembling mammae. The muscles
of the chest are developed in proportion, and the sternum has a medial ridge something like
that of a bird. They are all nocturnal, with small eyes (except in the case of the frugivorous
bats), large ears, and in some cases membranous appendages to the nostrils, which may possibly
be for the purpose of guiding themselves in the dark, for it is proved by experiment that bats
are not dependent on eyesight for guidance, and one naturalist has remarked that, in a certain
species of bat which has no facial membrane, this delicacy of perception was absent. I have
noticed this in one species, Cynopterus marginatus, one of which flew into my room not long
ago, and which repeatedly dashed itself against a glass door in its efforts to escape. I had
all the other doors closed.

Bats are mostly insectivorous; a few are fruit-eaters, such as our common flying-fox. They
produce from one to two at a birth, which are carried about by the mother and suckled at the
breast, this peculiarity being one of the anatomical details alluded to as claiming for the
bats so high a place.

Bats are divided into four sub-families--Pteropodidae, Vampyridae, Noctilionidae, and Vespertilionidae.

MEGACHIROPTERA.

SUB-FAMILY PTEROPODIDAE.

GENUS PTEROPUS.

These are frugivorous bats of large size, differing, as remarked by Jerdon, so much in their
dentition from the insectivorous species that they seem to lead through the flying Lemurs (Colugos)
directly to the Quadrumana. The dentition is more adapted to their diet; they have cutting
incisors to each jaw, and grinders with flat crowns, and their intestines are longer than those
of the insectivorous bats. They produce but one at birth, and the young ones leave their parents
as soon as they can provide for themselves. The tongue is covered with rough papillae. They
have no tail. These bats and some of the following genus, which are also frugivorous, are distinguished
from the rest of the bats by a claw on the first or index finger, which is short.

Dental formula: Inc., 4/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars, 2--2/3--3; molars, 3--3/3--3.

NATIVE NAMES.--Badul, Bengali and Mahratti; Wurbagul, Hindi; Toggul bawali, Canarese; Sikurayi,
Telegu.

HABITAT.--All through India, Ceylon, and Burmah.

[Figure: The Flying Fox at Home.]

DESCRIPTION.--Head and nape rufous black; neck and shoulders golden yellow (the hair longer);
back dark brown; chin dark; rest of body beneath fulvous or rusty brown; interfemoral membrane
brownish black.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Length, 12 to 14 inches; extent of wings, 46 to 52 inches.

These bats roost on trees in vast numbers. I have generally found them to prefer tamarinds
of large size. Some idea of the extent of these colonies may be gathered from observations
by McMaster, who attempted to calculate the number in a colony. He says: "In five minutes a
friend and I counted upwards of six hundred as they passed over head, en route to their feeding
grounds; supposing their nightly exodus to continue for twenty minutes, this would give upwards
of two thousand in one roosting place, exclusive of those who took a different direction."

[Figure: Head of Pteropus medius.]

Tickell's account of these colonies is most graphic, though Emerson Tennent has also given
a most interesting and correct account of their habits. The former writes:--"From the arrival
of the first comer until the sun is high above the horizon, a scene of incessant wrangling
and contention is enacted among them, as each endeavours to secure a higher and better place,
or to eject a neighbour from too close vicinage. In these struggles the bats hook themselves
along the branches, scrambling about hand over hand with some speed, biting each other severely,
striking out with the long claw of the thumb, shrieking and cackling without intermission.
Each new arrival is compelled to fly several times round the tree, being threatened from all
points, and, when he eventually hooks on, he has to go through a series of combats, and be
probably ejected two or three times before he makes good his tenure." For faithful portraying,
no one could improve on this description. These bats are exceeding strong on the wing. I was
aware that they went long distances in search of food, but I was not aware of the power they
had for sustained flight till the year 1869, when, on my way to England on furlough, I discovered
a large flying fox winging his way towards our vessel, which was at that time more than two
hundred miles from land. Exhausted, it clung on to the fore-yard arm; and a present of a rupee
induced a Lascar to go aloft and seize it, which he did after several attempts. The voracity
with which it attacked some plantains showed that it had been for some time deprived of food,
probably having been blown off shore by high winds. Hanging head-downwards from its cage, it
stuffed the fruit into its cheeks, monkey-fashion, and then seemed to chew it at leisure. When
I left the steamer at Suez it remained in the captain's possession, and seemed to be tame and
reconciled to its imprisonment, tempered by a surfeit of plantains. In flying over water they
frequently dip down to touch the surface. Jerdon was in doubt whether they did this to drink
or not, but McMaster feels sure that they do this in order to drink, and that the habit is
not peculiar to the Pteropodidae, as he has noticed other bats doing the same. Colonel Sykes
states that he "can personally testify that their flesh is delicate and without disagreeable
flavour;" and another colonel of my acquaintance once regaled his friends on some flying fox
cutlets, which were pronounced "not bad." Dr. Day accuses these bats of intemperate habits;
drinking the toddy from the earthen pots on the cocoanut trees, and flying home intoxicated.
The wild almond is a favourite fruit.

Mr. Rainey, who has been a careful observer of animals for years, states that in Bengal these
bats prefer clumps of bamboos for a resting place, and feed much on the fruit of the betel-nut
palm when ripe. Another naturalist, Mr. G. Vidal, writes that in Southern India the P. medius
feeds chiefly on the green drupe or nut of the Alexandrian laurel (Calophyllum inophyllum),
the kernels of which contain a strong-smelling green oil on which the bats fatten amazingly;
and then they in turn yield, when boiled down, an oil which is recommended as an excellent
stimulative application for the hair. I noticed in Seonee a curious superstition to the effect
that a bone of this bat tied on to the ankle by a cord of black cowhair is a sovereign remedy,
according to the natives, for rheumatism in the leg. Tickell states that these bats produce
one at a time in March or April, and they continue a fixture on the mother till the end of
May or beginning of June.

NO. 32. PTEROPUS LESCHENAULTII (CYNONYCTERIS AMPLEXICAUDATA). The Fulvous Fox-Bat (Jerdon's
No. 13).

Dobson places this bat in the sub-group Cynonycteris. It seems to differ from Pteropus only,
as far as I can see, in having a small distinct tail, though the above-quoted author considers
it closely allied to the next genus.

HABITAT.--The Carnatic, Madras and Trichinopoly; stated also procurable at Calcutta and Pondicherry
(Jerdon); Ceylon (Kellaart).

DESCRIPTION.--Fur short and downy; fulvous ashy, or dull light ashy brown colour, denser and
paler beneath; the hairs whitish at the base; membranes dark brown.

SIZE.--Length, 5 to 5-1/2 inches; extent of wing, 18 to 20 inches.

More information is required regarding the habits of this bat.

GENUS CYNOPTERUS.

This genus has four molars less than the last, a shorter muzzle; the cheek-bones or zygomatic
arch more projecting; tongue rather longer and more tapering, and slightly extensile.

NO. 33. CYNOPTERUS MARGINATUS. The Small Fox-Bat (Jerdon's No. 14).

NATIVE NAME.--Chamgadili, Hindi; Coteekan voulha, Singhalese.

HABITAT.--India generally, and Ceylon.

[Figure: Cynopterus marginatus.]

DESCRIPTION.--General colour fulvous olivaceous, paler beneath and with an ashy tinge; ears
with a narrow margin of white (Jerdon.) A reddish smear on neck and shoulders of most specimens;
membranes dusky brown. Females paler (Kellaart).

SIZE.--Length, 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 inches; extent of wing, 17 to 20 inches.

This bat is found all over India; it is frugivorous exclusively, though some of this sub-order
are insectivorous. Blyth says he kept some for several weeks; they would take no notice of
the buzz of an insect held to them, but are ravenous eaters of fruit, each devouring its own
weight at a meal, voiding its food but little changed whilst slowly munching away; of guava
it swallows the juice only. Blyth's prisoners were females, and after a time they attracted
a male which hovered about them for some days, roosting near them in a dark staircase; he was
also caught, with one of the females who had escaped and joined him. Dr. Dobson writes that
in three hours one of these bats devoured twice its own weight. This species usually roosts
in trees.

NO. 34. MACROGLOSSUS (PTEROPUS) MINIMUS. The Tenasserim Fox-Bat.

NATIVE NAME.--Lowo-assu (dog-bat), Javanese.

HABITAT.--The Himalayas, Burmah, Tenasserim, and the Indian Archipelago.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears half length of head, narrow and rounded at tip; face abruptly narrowed in
front of eyes; muzzle long, narrow, cylindrical; lower jaw slightly projecting; eyes large;
tongue very long, last third attenuated, covered with brush-like papillae; interfemoral membrane
very narrow, especially at root of tail; fur reddish brown, and very long.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-3/10 inches.

Like other Pteropi this bat feeds on fruit of every description, but particularly attacks the
various cultivated varieties of Eugenia (Jamoon).

GENUS EONYCTERIS.

Muzzle long and cylindrical; nostrils scarcely projecting; upper lip with a shallow vertical
groove in front; index finger without a claw; thumb short; part of the terminal phalanx included
in the wing membrane; metacarpal bone of the second finger equal to the index finger in length;
tail short and distinct; the base contained in the narrow interfemoral membrane; tongue long,
as in Macroglossus.

NO. 35. EONYCTERIS SPELAEA.

HABITAT.--Burmah.

DESCRIPTION.--Head long; muzzle narrow, cylindrical, abruptly narrowed in front of the eyes;
nostrils with an intervening emargination, which also passes down to the lips; tongue very
long and pointed; ears conical, with rounded tips; body clothed with very short and thinly-spread
fur of a uniform dark brown colour; the fur on the head extends only as far as the inner corners
of the eye, leaving the rest of the face naked; tail half an inch. On each side, and a little
behind the anal opening, are two small, kidney-shaped subcutaneous glandular bodies.

SIZE.--Head and body, 4 inches; tail, 1/2 inch.

Found in Farm Caves, Moulmein. The absence of the claw on the index finger is specially to
be noted.

MICROCHIROPTERA.

SUB-FAMILY VAMPYRIDAE.

GENUS MEGADERMA.

Bats with simple or complicated nose-leaves or membranes. The conch of the ear very large,
and joined together on the top of the head; tragus large and bifurcated; nasal membranes complicated;
no tail; wings remarkably ample. They have four incisors below but none above, the intermaxillaries
remaining cartilaginous.

NO. 36. MEGADERMA LYRA. The Large-eared Vampire Bat (Jerdon's No. 15).

HABITAT.--India and Ceylon.

[Figure: Megaderma lyra.]

DESCRIPTION.--Above ashy blue, slaty or pale mouse colour; albescent or yellowish ashy beneath;
nasal appendage large, oblong, free at the tip, reaching to the base of the ears with a fold
down the centre; tragus (oreillon) cordate, two-lobed, anterior long, narrow and pointed, posterior
lobe half the height and rounded; muzzle truncated; under-lip cleft; wing membranes dark brown.

SIZE.--Head and body, 3 or 3-1/2 inches; wing extent, 14 to 19 inches.

Very abundant in old buildings. They are beyond doubt blood-suckers. Blyth noticed one fly
into his room one evening with a small vespertilio, which it dropped on being chased. The smaller
bat was weak from loss of blood, and next morning (the Megaderm having been caught), on both
bats being put into the same cage, the little one was again attacked and devoured; it was seized
both times behind the ear. McMaster writes that in Rangoon he had a tame canary killed by a
bat, and the bird's mate soon afterwards was destroyed in the same way. The case was clearly
proved.

Mr. Frith informed Mr. Blyth that these bats were in the habit of resorting to the verandah
of his house at Mymensing, and that every morning the ground under them was strewed with the
hind quarters of frogs, and the wings of large grasshoppers and crickets. On one occasion the
remains of a small fish were observed; but frogs appeared to be their chief diet--never toads;
and of a quiet evening these animals could be distinctly heard crunching the heads and smaller
bones of their victims.

NO. 37. MEGADERMA SPECTRUM. The Cashmere Vampire (Jerdon's No. 16).

HABITAT.--Cashmere.

DESCRIPTION.--Above slaty cinereous, whitish beneath; the vertical nose-leaf of moderate size,
oval; inner lobe of tragus ovate (Jerdon).

SIZE.--Two and three-quarter inches.

Dobson makes this bat synonymous with the last.

NO. 38. MEGADERMA SPASMA.

HABITAT.--Tenasserim, Ceylon.

[Figure: Megaderma spasma.]

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle, ear-conch, and tragus similar to those of M. lyra; the posterior portion
of the tragus, however, is longer and more attenuated upwards, and more acutely pointed; the
nose-leaf is shorter, with convex sides; but the anterior concave disc is considerably larger,
and the base of the thickened process is cordate; thumbs and wings as in M. lyra; interfemoral
membrane deeper; the calcaneum stronger; colour the same.

SIZE.--Head and body, about 3 inches. This bat is alluded to by Jerdon as M. Horsfieldii.

RHINOLOPHINAE.

Nasal leaf complicated, and crests resting on the forehead, presenting more or less the figure
of a horse-shoe; tail long and placed in the interfemoral membrane; ears large, but separate,
and not joined at the base, as in the last genus; without a tragus, but often with a lobe at
the base of the outer margin; wings large and long; forefinger of a single joint.

GENUS RHINOLOPHUS.

Nose-leaf cordate, or semi-orbicular, bi-lobed in front of the nostrils; a longitudinal crest
along the nose and an erect frontal leaf posteriorly more or less lanceolate.--Jerdon.

HABITAT.--Nepaul, Darjeeling, Khasya Hills.

[Figure: Rhinolophus luctus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Ears very large, much longer than the head; broad, acutely pointed; nasal apparatus
very complicated; the lower leaf very large, concealing the upper lip like a door knocker;
the upper leaf like a graduated spire; ears transversely striate; a rather large semi-circular
lobe at base of ear; fur long, dense, soft, and lax, slightly curled or woolly black with a
silvery grizzle, or greyish-black or rich chestnut-brown.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Length, 3-3/4; tail, 1-3/4; wing expanse, 17 inches.

NO. 40. RHINOLOPHUS MITRATUS. The Mitred Leaf-Bat (Jerdon's No. 18).

HABITAT.--Chybassa, Central India, Mussoorie(?)

DESCRIPTION.--Ears large; anti-helix moderately developed; upper leaf triangular acute; tail
extending beyond the tibia; color above light brown; paler beneath.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-1/2 inches; tail, 1-1/2 inch; wing expanse, 12 to 14 inches.

NO. 41.

HABITAT.--Nepaul, Mussoorie.

[Figure: Rhinolophus ferrum-equinum.]

DESCRIPTION.--Upper process like a barbed spear-head; central one small and narrow, a little
expanded at the summit; anti-tragus less developed than usual; lips simple; colour a uniform
deep brown, with tips of the hair paler, and somewhat rusty.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-5/8 inches; tail, 1-7/8 inch; wing, 15-1/2 inches.

The tail of this species seems unusually long. It is found in cavities of rock, and issues
forth soon after dusk--sooner, according to Hodgson, than the species of vespertilio.

NO. 42. RHINOLOPHUS PEARSONII. Pearson's Leaf-Bat (Jerdon's No. 20).

HABITAT.--Lower Himalayan range, Darjeeling, Mussoorie, &c.

DESCRIPTION.--Colour above dark brown, with a slight shade of chestnut; underneath brown, with
a sooty cast; fur very long, dense and soft; ears distinct, with an additional rounded lobe
below, measuring anteriorly nearly three-fourths of an inch; point of the facial crest moderately
developed; length from the tip of the nose to root of tail three inches; tail half an inch;
length of fore-arm two inches; expanse of the wings eleven inches. Although allied to Mr. Hodgson's
R. tragatus, possesses distinct characters.--Horsfield.

SIZE.--As given by Horsfield above.

This bat was first sent from Darjeeling by Mr. J. T. Pearson, and was named after him. It has
also, according to Jerdon, been found by Captain Hutton at Mussoorie; it is therefore reasonable
to suppose that it inhabits the whole range of the lower Himalayas. One striking difference
between it and the last species is the very short tail, and it is easily to be recognised by
the great length of the fur.

NO. 43. RHINOLOPHUS AFFINIS. The Allied Leaf-Bat (Jerdon's No. 21).

HABITAT.--Ceylon, Burmah, and perhaps the Malabar coast.

DESCRIPTION.--Above bright red ferruginous brown; tips of hair darker, paler beneath; ears
pointed and external; edge deeply emarginated; internal edge and basal third of external surface
hairy; anti-helix well developed; nasal process apparently very similar to that of R. mitratus
(Kellaart). Upper leaf triangular, emarginate at the tip, reaching above the base of the ears
(Jerdon).

SIZE.--Head and body about 2-3/10 inches; tail, 1 inch; wing extent, 12 inches.

This bat seems to vary much in colour. Kellaart says some are of a brighter red than others,
and a few had a yellower tinge. Another marked variety was of a uniform pale yellow brown.

NO. 44. RHINOLOPHUS ROUXI. The Rufous Leaf-Bat (Jerdon's No. 22).

HABITAT.--India generally.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears large, pointed, externally notched; tragus broad; tips of upper nose-leaf
triangular, with its sides well emarginate, reaching above the base of the ears; no upper incisors
[as in Megaderma lyra]; lower molars only five; canines very large; fur short, crisp; colour
above smoky brown in some, reddish brown in others, and golden rufous in some; beneath paler.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Length, 2-3/8 inches; tail, 1-1/8; wing expanse, 13 inches.

Hodgson considers this bat as allied to the two following species. It is the R. lepidus of Blyth.

NO. 45. RHINOLOPHUS MACROTIS. The Large-eared Leaf-Bat (Jerdon's No. 23).

HABITAT.--Lower Himalayas.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears very large, broad, oval, with pointed recurved tip, and a large obtuse tragus;
anterior central crest of nose-leaf produced in front over the top of the flat transverse front
edge; hinder leaf lanceolate triangular; above sooty brown or light earthy olive-brown, paler
below, some with a rufous or Isabelline tint; no pubic teats.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1-3/4 inch; tail, 3/4; wing expanse, 9-3/4.

NO. 46. RHINOLOPHUS SUB-BADIUS. The Bay Leaf-Bat (Jerdon's No. 24).

HABITAT.--Nepaul.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears not larger than the head, obtusely pointed and ovoid; nasal appendage quadrate,
with a transverse bar nearly surmounting it; upper leaf triangular, with slightly emarginate
sides; clear brown above, paler below and on head and face.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1-1/2 inch; tail, 1-1/4; wing expanse, 7-1/2.--Jerdon.

NO. 47. RHINOLOPHUS RAMMANIKA (Kellaart).

HABITAT.--Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Above rufescent, beneath ashy brown; face slightly fulvous; round the base of
the ears and on the sides of the posterior half of the body bright fulvous; tail enclosed in
the interfemoral membrane.

This is a doubtful species. Dr. Kellaart got one from Amanapoora hill at Kaduganava. He says:
"As the specimen reached us in a dried condition, we are unable to say anything more about
its nasal processes than that in place of a transverse process above the nostrils it had a
small triangular peak over the usual horse-shoe process surrounding the nasal opening. This
triangular crest was hairy; superiorly there was no appearance of a sac above it to the best
of our recollection."

NO. 48. RHINOLOPHUS ANDAMANENSIS.

HABITAT.--Southern Andaman Island.

DESCRIPTION (apud Dobson).--Like R. affinis generally, but the anterior horizontal horse-shoe
shaped membrane is very broad, completely concealing the muzzle when viewed from above, as
in R. Pearsonii; the posterior terminal leaf is also much longer, produced backwards between
the ears, and not concave on the sides as in R. affinis. The thumb is also much longer. Fur
bright reddish brown above and beneath.

NO. 49. RHINOLOPHUS MINOR.

HABITAT.--Burmah, Yunan.

DESCRIPTION.--Light brown above, greyish brown beneath; ears slightly shorter than the head,
sub-acutely pointed; anti-tragus large, separated by a deep angular notch; lower lip with three
vertical grooves.

SIZE.--Length of head and body from 1 to 1-3/4 inch.

NO. 50. RHINOLOPHUS COELOPHYLLUS.

HABITAT.--Burmah.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur brown, with whitish roots, light brownish white below; ears large, with pointed
tips projecting outwards; "anti-tragus large, separated by an angular emargination from the
outer margin of the ear; horse-shoe large; horizontal margins of central nose-leaf triangular,
small; erect portion rather short, with parallel sides and rounded summit, meeting the connected
vertical process at the same level" (Dobson). For a more detailed description see Dobson's
Monograph, page 53. Three vertical grooves on lower lip.

SIZE.--Length of head and body about 2 inches.

NO. 51. RHINOLOPHUS GAROENSIS.

HABITAT.--Garo Hills, Assam; Himalayas (Mussoorie).

DESCRIPTION (apud Dobson).--Ears acutely pointed, with a large anti-tragus, as in R. affinis;
anterior vertical process of the sella maintaining the same breadth upwards and rounded off
above, considerably exceeded in height by the upper edge of the connecting process, which develops
a long acutely pointed projection; terminal portion of the posterior leaf broad with straight
sides, forming an almost equilateral triangle.

Wing membrane from the ankles, inter femoral membrane square behind; extreme tip of the tail free.

SIZE.--Length of head and body about 1.5 inch.

This bat is figured (head only) in Dobson's Monograph, page 48.

NO. 52. RHINOLOPHUS PETERSII.

HABITAT.--India. Precise locality unknown.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears acutely pointed, with an emargination immediately beneath the tip; anti-tragus
large, separated from the outer margin by a deep angular incision; nose-leaf horizontal, horse-shoe-shaped,
not so broad as the muzzle; vertical part of the sella almost same breadth upwards, and rounded
off above, exceeded considerably in height by the upper margin of the posterior connecting
process; lower lip with three vertical grooves; fur dark brown above, greyish brown beneath.

SIZE.--Length of head and body, 2.5 inches; tail, 1 inch.

There are two good woodcuts of the head of this bat in Dobson's Monograph.

NO. 53. RHINOLOPHUS TRIFOLIATUS.

HABITAT.--East coast of India.

DESCRIPTION.--Very much like R. perniger (luctus), but is distinguished by its smaller size
and by the more pointed vertical process of the central nose-leaf, which in the other is truncated.

SIZE.--Length of head and body, 2 inches; tail about 1 inch.

GENUS HIPPOSIDEROS (GRAY) VEL PHYLLORHINA (BONAPARTE).

Nasal-leaf broad, depressed, transverse; ears with transverse wrinkles; a circular sac behind
the nasal crest, which can be turned inside out; when alarmed the animal blows it out, and
then withdraws it at each breath; it contains a waxy matter of green or yellow colour. Blyth
thinks that this sac is affected by the amorous season, as in the case of the infra-orbital
cavities of various ruminants and analogous glandular follicles in other animals.

NO. 54. HIPPOSIDEROS ARMIGER. The Large Horse-shoe Bat (Jerdon's No. 25).

HABITAT.--Lower Himalaya ranges; Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Nasal-leaf large and square; lips with a triple fold of skin on each side; tragus
vaguely developed and wavily emarginate; of a uniform light-brown colour, with maroon tips
to the hairs of the upper parts; membranes black.

SIZE.--Head and body, 4-1/2 inches; tail, 2-1/2; wing expanse, 22.

Jerdon makes this out to be the same as Kellaart's H. lankadiva and the Malayan H. nobilis,
but those are synonymous with Phyllorhina diadema. Kellaart supposed it to be identical with
H. insignis, which will be found further on as Phyllorhina larvata, all those bats closely
resembling each other in a general way. I think this No. 25 of Jerdon is the same as Peter's
Phyllorhina armigera. Hutton found it at Darjeeling, and writes of it as follows:--

"When captured alive the large ears are kept in a constant state of rapid tremulous motion,
and the animal emits a low purring sound, which becomes a sharp scream when alarmed or irritated.
When suspended at rest the tail and inter-femoral membrane are turned up, not in front, like
the Rhinolophi, but behind, over the lower part of the back; neither does it appear to envelope
itself in its wings so completely as does R. luctus." He then goes on to say he has noticed
the tremor of the ears and facial crests in all the Rhinolophi when disturbed, and concludes
with a graphic description of this species, sallying forth in the evening to prey upon the
noisy Cicadas; leisurely wheeling with noiseless, cautious flight round some wide-spreading
oak, "scanning each branch as he slowly passes by--now rising to a higher circle, and then
perchance descending to the lower branches, until at length, detecting the unfortunate minstrel,
it darts suddenly into the tree, and snatching the still screaming insect from its perch, bears
it away."

Jerdon procured specimens at Darjeeling, and Kellaart says it is found in great abundance at
Kandy and its neighbourhood; Kurnegalle Tunnel swarms with them.

NO. 55. HIPPOSIDEROS SPEORIS. The Indian Horse-shoe Bat (Jerdon's No. 26).

HABITAT.--India generally and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Mouse brown or fulvous brown. Occasionally golden fulvous and sometimes dusky
black above, paler beneath; membranes dusky brown; interfemoral membrane narrow, enclosing
the tail except the last half joint (about 2-10ths of an inch), which is free.

Ear large, erect and pointed, rounded at the base and emarginated on the outer edge; nasal
process complicated. "Males have a frontal sac; females none" (Kellaart). Pubis naked, with
two inguinal warts.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2 inches; tail, 1-2/10; wing expanse, 12.

Inhabits old buildings, wells, &c.

NO. 56. HIPPOSIDEROS MURINUS. The Little Horse-shoe Bat (Jerdon's No. 27).

HABITAT.--Southern India, Ceylon, and Burmah.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle short; body short and thick; a transverse frontal leaf with a sac behind
it; no folds of skin on each side of the horse-shoe as in the last species; ears large, naked
and rounded; colour dusky brown or mouse, sometimes light fawn; wing membrane blackish; interfemoral
membrane large, and including the tail all but the tip.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1-4/5 inch; tail, 1-1/5 inch; wing expanse, 10.

Jerdon says the mouse-coloured variety is common in the Carnatic, but he has only seen the
light fulvous race on the Nilgheries; but Mr. Elliot procured both in the southern Mahratta
country. A dark variety of this bat was called Rhinolophus ater by Templeton, and H. atratus
by Kellaart; in other respects it is identical, only a little smaller.

NO. 57. HIPPOSIDEROS CINERACEUS. The Ashy Horse-shoe Bat (Jerdon's No. 28).

HABITAT.--Punjab Salt range.

DESCRIPTION.--Similar to the last, but larger, and I should think the argument against H. atratus
would apply to this as a distinct species.

NO. 58. HIPPOSIDEROS LARVATUS. Syn.--PHYLLORHINA LARVATA.

HABITAT.--Arracan.

DESCRIPTION.--The fur of the upper part bright fulvous; more or less tinged with maroon on
the back, lighter underneath; membranes dusky, but tinged with the prevailing colour of the
fur; ears angulated; a minute false molar in front of the carnassial in the upper jaw.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-3/4 inches; tail, 1-1/4; wing extent, 12.

Kellaart writes of this bat under his H. aureus. He describes it as head, neck, and body of
a bright golden yellow, with a slight maroon shade on the tips of the hairs on the back. Females
paler coloured. Frontal sac only in males; the waxy matter of a yellow colour, and quite transparent.

NO. 59. HIPPOSIDEROS VULGARIS. Syn.--PHYLLORHINA LARVATA. The Common Malayan Horse-shoe Bat.

HABITAT.--Arracan and Malayana.

DESCRIPTION.--"It differs from the last in being rather smaller, and of a brown colour above,
much paler at the base of the hairs and at their extreme tips, and lighter coloured below;
the ears more apiculated, or rather they appear so from being strongly emarginated externally
towards the tip."--Blyth.

NO. 60. HIPPOSIDEROS BLYTHII.

HABITAT.--Ceylon, Fort Frederic.

DESCRIPTION.--Above surface colour a rich dark tawny brown; base of hairs much lighter coloured,
of a brighter yellow tinge; beneath paler; face partially blackish; ears black; tip of tail
excerted; no frontal sac; membranes blackish; nasal processes as in H. speoris.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-2/10 inches; tail, 1; wing expanse, 12.

Dr. Kellaart considered this a new and undescribed species, distinguished from H. speoris and
H. vulgaris (vel Templetonii--Kellaart) by the greater length of the fore-arm, which is two
inches. This remark however does not apply to vulgaris, of which Kellaart himself gives two
inches as the length of the radius, and Blyth gives two and a quarter. The absence of the frontal
sac would have been a greater proof, but both specimens on which Kellaart made his observations
were females; and as colouring is so varied in the bat tribe as to preclude the division of
species on this ground, I think we may put this down as a doubtful species on which more information
is desirable.

NO. 61. PHYLLORHINA DIADEMA.

HABITAT.--India generally; Ceylon and Burmah.

DESCRIPTION.--The fur with three shades--buff, then reddish brown with ashy tips, underneath
greyish or pale brown. "The hinder erect nose-leaf," according to Dobson's description, "equals
the horse-shoe and slightly exceeds the sella in width, its free margin forming a segment of
the circumference of a circle, with a small blunt projection in the centre and three vertical
ridges on its concave front surface; sella large, with a prominent ridge in the centre, forming
a small projection above and one smaller on each side; sides of the muzzle with prominent vertical
leaves, three on each side; no frontal pore."

There is a good figure of the head of this bat in Cuvier's 'Animal Kingdom,' Carpenter's and
Westwood's edition, under the name of Rhinolophus nobilis. It is the same also as Kellaart's
Hipposideros lankadiva. Captain Hutton, who was a keen observer of the habits of the bats at
Mussoorie, says of this one: "Like R. affinis, this species may frequently be heard during
its flight cracking and crunching the hard wings of beetles, which in the evening hours are
usually abundant among the trees; the teeth are strong, and the tout ensemble of its aspect
is not unlike that of a bull-dog."--'Proc. Zoo. Soc.,' 1872, page 701.

NO. 62. PHYLLORHINA MASONI.

HABITAT.--Burmah (Moulmein).

DESCRIPTION.--This bat resembles the last closely; such difference as exists is that the concave
surface of the terminal nose-leaf is divided into two cells only by a single central vertical
ridge, and from the under surface of the juncture of the mandible a small bony process projects
downwards about equal to the lower canine tooth in vertical extent, and covered by the integument.

There is an excellent figure of this bat in Dobson's Monograph, from whence I have also taken
the above description.

NO. 63. PHYLLORHINA NICOBARENSIS.

HABITAT.--Nicobar Island.

DESCRIPTION.--"Ears large, acute; outer margin slightly concave beneath the tip; no frontal
sac behind the nose-leaf; upper margin of the transverse terminal leaf simple, forming an arc
of a circle, folded back and overhanging the concave front surface, which is divided into two
cells only by a single central longitudinal ridge; in front the margin of the horse-shoe is
marked by three small points" (Dobson). Fur light brown, then greyish, with light brown tips.

SIZE.--Length of head and body, 3 inches.

NO. 64. PHYLLORHINA ARMIGERA.

HABITAT.--The entire range of the Himalayas, Khasya Hills, and Ceylon.

[Figure: Phyllorhina armigera.  Male. Female.]

DESCRIPTION.--The hinder erect nose-leaf narrow, not so broad as the horse-shoe; upper edge
sinuate, slightly elevated in the centre, and at either extremity; vertical ridges beneath
well developed, prominent, enclosing moderately deep cells; wart-like granular elevations on
each side above the eyes are usually greatly developed, forming large thickened longitudinal
elevations extending forward on each side of the posterior erect nose-leaf, and backwards towards
the frontal sac (Dobson). The colour varies.

SIZE.--Length of head and body from 3 to 4 inches; tail about 2.

This is the largest of this genus, and one of the most interesting of the species. My space
will not admit of extensive quotations from those who have written about it, but there is a
fuller description of it in Dr. Dobson's book, and a very interesting account of its habits
by Capt. J. Hutton, in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' 1872, page 701.

NO. 65. PHYLLORHINA LEPTOPHYLLA.

HABITAT.--Khasya Hills.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears large, broad, triangular, with subacute tips; outer margin slightly concave;
upper transverse nose-leaf small; upper edge simple, narrower than horse-shoe, thin; three
vertical folds in front faintly descernible at base only; horse-shoe with small incision in
centre of front free edge; frontal pore small, placed at some distance behind the transverse
nose-leaf; fur and integuments dark throughout.--Dobson.

NO. 66. PHYLLORHINA GALERITA.

HABITAT.--Central India, Deccan.

DESCRIPTION.--"Ear comparatively small, as broad as long; inner margin very convex forward;
outer margin slightly concave beneath the tip; nose-leaf as in P. larvata, but the transverse
terminal leaf is more rectangular; the superior margin less convex, and its concave front surface
is marked by three very prominent vertical ridges; frontal pore small, indistinct, not larger
than in the females of P. larvata."--Dobson.

SIZE.--Head and body about 2 inches; tail, 1 inch.

NO. 67. PHYLLORHINA BICOLOR.

HABITAT.--India (N. W. Himalaya), Nicobar Islands.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur above reddish chestnut; the base of the hairs pale reddish-white, or base
of hair pure white, the tip, dark reddish-brown. Ears as long as the head, broad; the lower
half of the inner margin very convex; the summit of the ear conch rounded off broadly as far
as a point on the outer side, where a slight but distinct flattening occurs, and indicates
the position of the tip. Horse-shoe small, square; the concave front surface divided into four
cells by three distinct vertical ridges; no secondary leaflets external to the horse-shoe;
frontal sac distinct in males, rudimentary in females (Dobson). Blyth includes this bat in
his Burmese Catalogue, but does not say much about it.

GENUS COELOPS.

Possesses the general characteristics of Rhinolophus, but the tail and calcanea wanting entirely;
the intercrural membrane acutely emarginate to the depth of a line even with the knees; ears
large, broad and rounded; the summit of the facial membranes rising abruptly, obtusely bifid,
bent forward; fur long, delicately fine.--Jerdon.

NO. 68. COELOPS FRITHII. Frith's Tailless Bat (Jerdon's No. 29).

HABITAT.--The Sunderbunds, Bengal.

DESCRIPTION.--Colour dusky or blackish; the fur tipped with ashy brown above, paler and somewhat
ashy beneath; membranes fuscous.

SIZE.--Length, 1-7/8 inch; membrane beyond 3/4 inch; forearm, 1-3/4.

This bat is rare. The above description, given by Jerdon, is based on one specimen sent to
Mr. Blyth by Mr. Frith, who obtained it in the Sunderbunds. It also inhabits Java. Dr. Dobson
examined a specimen from thence in the Leyden Museum. He says: "Calcanea and tail very short,"
whereas the above description says entirely wanting. "The ears are funnel-shaped, and thickly
covered with fine hair. Metacarpal bone of thumb very long; the wing membrane enclosing the
thumb up to the base of the claw; wing to the tarsus close to the ankles; feet very slender;
toes with strong claws."

GENUS RHINOPOMA.

Ears moderate, but joined above, as in the Megaderms; the nostrils at the end of the muzzle,
with a little lamina above, forming a kind of snout; tail slender and joined at the base with
the intercrural membrane, but extending far beyond it.

HABITAT.--All over India, Burmah and Malayana.

[Figure: Skull of Rhinopoma.]

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle long, thick, truncated, and surrounded by a small leaf; tragus oblong,
bi-acuminate; forehead concave with a channel down the centre; fur soft and very fine, dull
brown throughout; face, rump, and part of abdominal region naked.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-6/10 inches; tail, 2-1/2; expanse, 13.

Frequents old ruins, caves, and clefts in rocks.

SUB-FAMILY NOCTILIONIDAE.

Bats without facial membranes; with short obtuse and bull-doggish heads; large lips.

GENUS TAPHOZOUS.

Have a small rounded indenture on the forehead; no raised lamina on the nostrils; the head
pyramidal; eyes rather large; ears moderate in size and not joined at the base, but widely
apart; the tip of the tail free above the membrane, which is much longer.

The males have a transverse cavity under the throat; wings long and narrow, collapsing with
a double flexure outwards; fur soft and velvety.

NO. 70. TAPHOZOUS LONGIMANUS. The Long-armed Bat (Jerdon's No. 31).

HABITAT.--India generally.

DESCRIPTION.--"Ears oval, with many distinct folds, naked except at the base; tragus securiform;
fur thick, close, fuscous-black; or dark fuscous-brown above; beneath paler, except on the
throat, the hairs being conspicuously tipped with grey, the upper hairs being all white at
their base; face nude, and the membrane dark brownish-black" (Jerdon). The gular sac, though
represented in the male, is almost absent in the female, being but a rudimentary fold of skin;
in this it differs from another common Indian species, T. saccolaimus, in which the gular sac
is well developed in both sexes, though larger in the male.

SIZE.--Length, 5 inches; expanse, 15 to 16; tail, 1; fore-arm, 2-5/8; tibia, 1 inch.

This bat frequents old buildings, dark cellars, old ruins, &c.; the young are fulvescent, and
become darker with age. Blyth states that it has a surprising faculty for creeping about on
the vertical board of a cage, hitching its claws into the minute pores of the wood.

NO. 71. TAPHOZOUS MELANOPOGON. The Black-bearded Bat (Jerdon's No. 32).

HABITAT.--Common about Calcutta, East Coast of India, Burmah, and Cochin China.

DESCRIPTION.--"No gular sac, the openings of small pores appearing along a line corresponding
to the position of the mouth of the gular sac in other species; in some male specimens the
hair behind these pores is very long, forming a dense black beard" (Dobson). Ears moderate,
oval, with the outer margin extending under the eyes, dilated into a large rounded lobe; the
tragus leaf-shaped; the head, muzzle, and chin covered with short hairs.

SIZE.--Length of head and body about 3-1/2; tail, 2/3; wing expanse, 14 inches.

Horsfield says it occurs in caves in Java inhabited by the esculent swallows (Collocalia nidifica),
the gelatinous nests of which are used for soup by the Chinese. Dobson remarks that the black
beard is not always developed in the males; he conceives it to be owing to certain conditions,
probably connected with the amorous seasons. In five males in the Indian Museum the beard is
well developed; he found that only two per cent. of the Cochin China specimens in the Paris
Museum possessed it.

NO. 72. TAPHOZOUS SACCOLAIMUS. The White-bellied Bat (Jerdon's No. 33).

HABITAT.--Peninsula of India, Burmah, and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--"Muzzle angular, naked, very acute; nostrils small, close; ears distant, shorter
than the head, large inner margin recurved, outer margin dilated, reaching to the commissure
of the mouth; tragus wide, securiform (i.e. axe-shaped); fur short, smooth, blackish on the
head, chestnut brown on the back; beneath, dirty-white or black brown above with white pencillings;
pure white below" (Jerdon). Dobson says of the fur: "above, white at the base, the terminal
three-fourths of the hairs black, with a few irregular small white patches on the back; beneath
dark brown." The gular sac is to be found in both sexes, but somewhat larger in the males.

SIZE.--About 5 inches; wing expanse, 17.

NO. 73. TAPHOZOUS THEOBALDI.

HABITAT.--Tenasserim.

DESCRIPTION.--The gular sac is absent in both sexes; ears larger than in any others of the
sub-genus; the muzzle, from the corners of the eyes downwards, naked.

SIZE.--Head and body about 3-1/10 inches; tail, 1-1/4.

NO. 74. TAPHOZOUS KACHHENSIS.

HABITAT.--Kachh, N. W. India.

DESCRIPTION (apud Dobson).--"Gular sac absent in both male and female; its usual position indicated
in the male by a semi-circular fold of skin and nakedness of the integument in this situation;
in other respects similar to T. nudiventris. The deposits of fat about the tail very large."

SIZE.--Head and body about 3 inches; tail, 1-1/4.

T. nudiventris, above alluded to, is an inhabitant of Asia Minor, Egypt, and Nubia; similar
to the above, only that it has a small gular sac in the male, of which a trace only exists
in the female. Its most striking peculiarity is the deposit of fat at the root of the tail,
which may possibly be for purposes of absorption during the dormant winter season.

GENUS NYCTINOMUS.

"Ears broad, short, approximate or connate with the outer margin, terminating in an erect lobe
beyond the conch; tragus small, concealed" (often very small and quadrate, but never reduced
to a mere point, as in Molossus--Dobson); "wings narrow, folded as in Taphozous; intercrural
membrane short, truncate; tall free at the tip; feet short, with strong toes; muzzle thick;
lips tumid, lax; upper lip with coarse wrinkles."--Jerdon.

Dental formula: Inc., 2/6 or 2/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premol., 2--2/2--2; mol., 3--3/3--3.

NO. 75. NYCTINOMUS PLICATUS. The Wrinkle-lipped Bat (Jerdon's No. 34).

HABITAT.--India generally.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle broad and thick; upper lip overhanging the lower, marked by vertical wrinkles;
ears large and quadrilateral; outer margin ending in a decided anti-tragus; tail thick; the
lower part of the leg is free from the wing membrane, which however, is connected with the
ankle by a strong fibrous band; fur dense, smoky or snuff brown above (or bluish black--Dobson);
paler beneath.

SIZE.--Head and body about 2-1/10 inches; tail, 1-1/10. Jerdon gives length, 4-1/4 to 4-1/10;
expanse, 13-1/2; tail, 1-3/4.

This bat is common about Calcutta, frequenting ruins, dark places and hollow trees. It is allied
to N. tenuis (Horsfield), and it is mentioned as inhabiting hollow trees in such numbers as
to attract attention by the hissing noise from within, every available spot in the interior
being occupied. A synonym of the genus is Dysopes.

NO. 76. NYCTINOMUS TRAGATUS.

HABITAT.--India generally.

DESCRIPTION.--This differs from the last in having the wing membrane from the ankles, and in
the free portion of the tail being shorter; ears united at the base; tragus broad and rounded
above, partially concealed by the large anti-tragus.

SIZE.--About the same as the last.

SUB-FAMILY VESPERTILIONIDAE.

These bats have simple nostrils, as in the frugivorous ones, with no complications of foliated
cutaneous appendages; the muzzle is conical, moderately long, and clad with fur; the ears wide
apart; the inner margins springing from the sides, not the top of the head; the tragi are large;
eyes usually very small, and the tail, which is long, is wholly included in the membrane.

Dentition (usually): Inc., 2--2/6; can., 1--1/1--1, premol., 3--3/3--3; mol., 3--3/3--3. The
upper incisors are small, and placed in pairs near the canines, leaving a gap in the centre.
The lower ones sharp-edged and somewhat notched. At birth there are twenty-two teeth, which
are shed, and replaced by others, with sixteen additional ones, the adult bat having thirty-eight
teeth.

GENUS PLECOTUS.

Ears very large, united at the base; outer margin of the ear conch terminating opposite the
base of the tragus, the inner margin with an abrupt rounded projection directed inwards above
the base; tragus very large, tapering upwards, with a lobe at the base of the outer margin.

The English species P. auritus is very common there, and also in France; its ears are nearly
as long as its body, yet, when reposing, they are so folded as to be almost out of sight. The
Indian species is only a variety distinguishable by its yet longer ears ("and comparative shortness
of the thumbs"--Dobson).

NO. 77. PLECOTUS AURITUS vel HOMOCHROUS.

HABITAT.--The Himalayas and the Khasia Hills.

[Figure: Plecotus auritus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Head slightly raised above the face-line; ears nearly as long as the fore-arm,
joined by a low band across the forehead at the bases of their inner margins; wings from the
base of the toes; feet slender; tip of the tail free; fur silky, short, and of a uniform dull
brown.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.7 inch; ears, 1.55 (ears of English type of same size, 1.4 inch); tail,
1.7 inch. Jerdon gives larger results, but I put more reliance on Dobson's figures.

GENUS VESPERUGO.

Bats with very broad and obtuse muzzles; the glandular prominences much developed between the
eyes and the nostrils; crown of the head flat; but what distinguishes it from the following
genus, Scotophilus, is the presence of four incisors in the upper jaw, whereas Scotophilus
has two only--otherwise the two genera are very similar.

NO. 78. VESPERUGO NOCTULA.

HABITAT.--Nepal.

[Figure: Vesperugo noctula.]

DESCRIPTION.--Head broad and flat; ears oval and broad; the outer margin convex, reflected
backwards, and forming a thick lobe terminating close to the angle of the mouth; tragus short
and curved inwards; muzzle devoid of hair; fur dark reddish brown.

NO. 79. VESPERUGO LEUCOTIS.

HABITAT.--Deserts of Northern India, and Beluchistan.

DESCRIPTION.--"Ears, sides of face, about the eyes, interfemoral membrane, antehumeral membrane,
and that portion of the wing membrane along the sides of the body, white, very translucent;
remaining portion of wing membrane sepia, traversed by very distinct reticulations; fur on
the upper surface black at the base of the hairs for about half their length, remaining portion
light yellowish brown; beneath the same, but paler, almost white."--Dobson.

NO. 80. VESPERUGO MAURUS.

HABITAT.--Khasya Hills.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle broad and flat, with large labial development; ears broad, triangular,
broadly rounded off above; tragus broad and square; fur long and dense, uniformly sooty brown,
with greyish tips; membranes, nose, ears and lips black.

SIZE.--Head and body 1-1/10 inch; tail, 1 inch.

NO. 81. VESPERUGO AFFINIS.

HABITAT.--Burmah (Bhamo, Yunan).

DESCRIPTION (apud Dobson).--Head flat; upper labial glands so developed as to cause a deep
depression between them on the face behind the nostrils; ears broad as long from behind; the
outer margin extends from the tip to its termination near the corner of the mouth without emargination
or lobe; tragus broad; inner margin straight; outer convex; small triangular lobe at base.
Fur chocolate brown above, lighter on head and neck; beneath dark brown with lighter tips on
the pubes, and along the thighs dirty white or pale buff.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.9 inch; tail, 1.65 inch.

There is a good figure of the head of this bat in Dobson's Monograph; it was obtained by Dr.
J. Anderson at an elevation of 4500 feet at Bhamo.

NO. 82. VESPERUGO PACHYOTIS.

DESCRIPTION.--"This species is readily distinguished by the peculiar thickness of the lower
half of the outer side of the ear-conch, which appears as it were excavated out of the thick
integument of the neck; tragus short, curved inwards."--Dobson.

This bat is more fully described with three illustrations in Dobson's Monograph; he does not
mention where it is found, so it may or it may not be an Indian species.

NO. 83. VESPERUGO ATRATUS. Syn.--NYCTICEJUS ATRATUS.

HABITAT.--Darjeeling.

DESCRIPTION.--Head broad; muzzle obtuse; upper labial glands largely developed; ears large,
oval, with rounded tips, which in the natural position of the ears appear acute, owing to the
longitudinal folding of the outer side of the conch on the inner, commencing at and almost
bisecting the tip (Dobson). Fur long, dense and black; Jerdon says rich dark brown; paler beneath.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.9 inch; tail, 1.8 inch.

NO. 84. VESPERUGO TICKELLI.

HABITAT.--Chybassa, Jashpur, and Sirguja.

DESCRIPTION.--Head broad and flat; labial glands developed; ears moderate, rounded above; outer
edge straight, emarginate opposite base of tragus, terminating in a small lobe; tragus lunate;
tail long; last vertebra free. The face is more clad with fur than in other species of this
genus; fur of the body pale, straw brown above, pale buff beneath. For a fuller description
and illustration, see Dobson's Monograph.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.65 inch; tail, 2 inches.

NO. 85. VESPERUGO PACHYPUS.

HABITAT.--Darjeeling, Tenasserim, and Andaman Islands.

short; under surface of the base of the thumb and soles of the feet with broad fleshy pads;
wings rather short; fur fine and dense, above reddish brown, paler beneath.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.75 inch; tail 1 inch.

NO. 86. VESPERUGO ANNECTANS.

HABITAT.--Naga Hills and Assam.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle sharper; face hairy; ears pointed; tragus long; colour dark brown; illustration
in Dobson's Monograph.

SIZE.--About 2 inches; tail, 1.6 inch.

Unites the appearance of a Vespertilio to the dentition of Vesperugo.

NO. 87. VESPERUGO DORMERI.

HABITAT.--Southern India and Bellary Hills.

DESCRIPTION.--Head flat; ears shorter, triangular, with rounded tips; tragus with a small triangular
lobe near base of outer margin; fur brown, with ashy tips above, darker brown below, with the
terminal third of the hairs white. Dentition approaches the next genus, there being only one
pair of unicuspidate upper incisors placed, one by each upper canine.

NO. 88. (VESPERUGO) SCOTOPHILUS SEROTINUS. Syn.--VESPERUGO SEROTINUS. The Silky Bat (Jerdon's
No. 35).

HABITAT.--Europe, but extending through Asia to the Himalayas, Beluchistan and Kashmir.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears shorter than head, widely separate, ovate, angular, projecting forward,
terminating in a convex; lobe ending on a level with the corner of the mouth; tragus twice
the length of its breadth, semi-cordate; fur deep bay or chestnut brown; above fulvous, grey
beneath; hairs of back long and silky, but the colour of the fur varies considerably.

This is a rare bat in India, though Captain Hutton has procured it at Mussoorie. In England
it is not uncommon even near London; it flies steadily and rather slow, and is found in ruins,
roofs of churches, and sometimes old hollow trees.

NO. 89. (VESPERUGO) SCOTOPHILUS LEISLERI. Syn.--VESPERUGO LEISLERI. The Hairy-armed Bat (Jerdon's
No. 36).

HABITAT.--Himalayas.

[Figure: Vesperugo Leisleri.]

DESCRIPTION.--Ears short, oval, triangular; tragus short, rounded at tip; membrane attached
to base of outer toe; all toes short; membrane over the arms very hairy, some cross-lines of
hair on the interfemoral membrane; fur long, deep fuscous brown at base, chestnut at the tip;
beneath greyish brown.--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2-1/4 inches; tail, 3-3/4; expanse, 11-1/2.

SCOTOPHILUS PACHYOMUS. (Jerdon's No. 37.)

Synonymous with his No. 35; see Dobson's Monograph.

NO. 90. (VESPERUGO) SCOTOPHILUS COROMANDELIANUS. Syn.--VESPERUGO ABRAMUS; VESPERTILIO COROMANDELICUS.
The Coromandel Bat (Jerdon's No. 38).

HABITAT.--India generally, Burmah and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears triangular, rather large; outer margin straight or slightly concave; tragus
lunate; feet small; wing membrane attached to the base of the toes; fur short, above dingy
brown, the hairs tipped with a lighter tinge, paler beneath.

SIZE.--2-1/2 inches, including tail, which is about 1-1/8; wing expanse, 7-1/2.

This is a very common little bat, akin to the English Pipistrelle, and is found everywhere
in roofs, hollow bamboos, &c.

NO. 91. (VESPERUGO) SCOTOPHILUS LOBATUS. Syn.--VESPERUGO KUHLII. The Lobe-eared Bat (Jerdon's
No. 39).

HABITAT.--India generally.

DESCRIPTION.--Ears small, triangular; the base of the margin very convex forward; a triangular
lobule above the base of the outer margin; tragus short and uniform in width; a short muzzle;
wings from the base of the toes; feet small; calcaneum long; tip of tail free; fur blackish
yellow above, ashy beneath.

SIZE.--Two and a-half inches, of which the tail is 1-1/4; expanse 7-2/3. Jerdon, quoting Tomes,
states that this is the same as V. Abramus, but that is the synonym of the last species.

GENUS SCOTOPHILUS.

Muzzle short, bluntly conical, devoid of hair; ears longer than broad; tail shorter than the
head and body; wing membrane attached to the base of the toes.

Jerdon's formula gives upper incisors 4.

NO. 92. SCOTOPHILUS FULIGINOSUS. The Smoky Bat (Jerdon's No. 40).

HABITAT.--Central Nepal.

DESCRIPTION (apud Hodgson).--"Feet very small, included in the wing membrane nearly to the
end of the toes; ears acutely pointed, shorter than the head; muzzle groved, nudish; face sharp;
rostrum somewhat recurved; wholly sooty brown; a little smaller than Vesp. formosa."

I cannot find this bat mentioned by any other author, and Jerdon says it does not seem to be
recognised.

NO. 93. SCOTOPHILUS TEMMINCKII. Syn.--NYCTICEJUS TEMMINCKII (Jerdon).

HABITAT.--India generally; Burmah and Ceylon.

[Figure: Scotophilus Temminckii.]

DESCRIPTION.--Ears short, rounded and narrow; tragus narrow, curved and pointed inwards; muzzle
thick, blunt and conical; the fur varies, sometimes dark olive brown, fulvous beneath, and
occasionally chestnut, with a paler shade of yellow below.

SIZE.--Four and a-half inches, of which the tail is 1-1/2; expanse, 13.

A very common species, appearing early in the evening. Horsfield says of it that it collects
by hundreds in hollow trees, and feeds chiefly on white ants.

NO. 94. SCOTOPHILUS HEATHII.

HABITAT.--India and Ceylon (Rajanpore, Punjab).

DESCRIPTION.--Similar to the above, but longer in all its measurements (Dobson). Judging from
drawings, the head and muzzle of this are more in a line than in the last species, the ears
project forward, and are also larger, the tragus especially, and there is a greater width between
the ears.

SIZE.--Five inches, of which the tail is 2.

NO. 95. SCOTOPHILUS EMARGINATUS.

HABITAT.--India; precise locality unknown.

DESCRIPTION.--Head broad and flat; muzzle obtuse and thick; ears long and large, with rounded
tips turning outwards; tragus short; thumb long with a strong claw; wing membrane quite devoid
of hair, except on the interfemoral membrane, which is half covered; fur tricolored, first
dark chestnut, buff, and then yellowish brown.

NO. 96. SCOTOPHILUS ORNATUS. Syn.--NYCTICEJUS ORNATUS.

HABITAT.--India and Burmah.

DESCRIPTION.--Head broad; muzzle short; ears triangular, erect, with rounded tips, and broadly
rounded lobe at the base; tragus narrow, semi-lunate, curved towards the front; fur a light
Isabelline brown, spotted with white; a white spot on the centre of the forehead, and from
the back of the head down the spine for two-thirds of its length a narrow white streak; on
each side of the body two white patches; a broad white collar, or rather demi-collar, from
one ear spot to the other, passing under the throat. Dr. Dobson says the position of these
patches is very constant, but the size varies, being greatest in individuals of a pale rusty
red colour, and these he found always to be males.

SIZE.--Head and body, 3 inches; tail, 2 inches; expanse, 15.

NO. 97. SCOTOPHILUS PALLIDUS.

HABITAT.--Mian Mir, Lahore.

DESCRIPTION.--Head and muzzle as in S. Temminckii; ears slightly shorter than the head; internal
basal lobe convex, evenly rounded; tip broadly rounded off; tragus moderately long and rounded
at the tip; a prominent triangular lobe at base. Wing membrane from base of toes; lobule at
the heel very narrow and long; last rudimentary caudal vertebra free; fur of the body, wings,
and interfemoral membrane pale buff throughout.

SIZE.--Head and body, 2 inches; tail, 1.4 inch.

NOCTULINIA NOCTULA. (See ante: Vesperugo noctula--Jerdon's No. 41.)

NYCTICEJUS HEATHII. Large Yellow Bat (Jerdon's No. 42). (See ante: Scotophilus Heathii.)

NYCTICEJUS LUTEUS. The Bengal Yellow Bat (Jerdon's No. 43).

NYCTICEJUS TEMMINCKII. The Common Yellow Bat (Jerdon's No. 44).

Both the above (Nos. 43 and 44) are, according to Dr. Dobson, synonymous with Scotophilus Temminckii,
which see.

NYCTICEJUS CASTANEUS. The Chestnut Bat (Jerdon's No. 45).

This is also a variety of Scotophilus Temminckii.

NYCTICEJUS ATRATUS. The Sombre Bat (Jerdon's No. 46). (See ante: Vesperugo atratus.)

NYCTICEJUS CANUS. The Hoary Bat (Jerdon's No. 47). (See ante: Vesperugo lobatus.)

NYCTICEJUS ORNATUS. The Harlequin Bat (Jerdon's No. 48). (See ante: Scotophilus ornatus.)

NO. 98. NYCTICEJUS NIVICOLUS. The Alpine Bat (Jerdon's No. 49).

HABITAT.--Sikim.

DESCRIPTION.--"Head and body above uniform light brown with a slight yellowish shade; underneath,
from the throat to the vent, dark grey with a brownish tint, lighter on the sides of the throat.
Ears long, attenuated to an obtuse point."--Jerdon.

This bat was described by Hodgson ('Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.' 1855), but there is some doubt about
it, and it has been classed as a Lasiurus and also with Scot. ornatus and Vesp. formosa, but
Jerdon thinks it a distinct species. I cannot find any mention of it in Dobson's monograph.

GENUS HARPIOCEPHALUS.

This is also the genus Murina of Gray. Dr. Dobson explains his acceptance of the former term
in the following way: that he first accepted Murina on the score of priority in a paper showing
that Harpiocephalus and Murina must be united in a single genus; but finding afterwards that
Gray had founded Murina on a specimen of what he believed to be Vesp. suillus (Temm.), but
which was in reality a specimen of a very different species from Darjeeling, belonging to the
same section of the genus as Vespertilio harpia (Temm.) the type of his genus Harpiocephalus,
it remained therefore either to discard both names or to retain Harpiocephalus, in which course
he was supported by Professor Peters, to whom he mentioned the facts.

Horsfield's genus Lasiurus is included in this one, though Jerdon considers it distinct from
Murina.

Muzzle elongated, conical; nostrils prominent, tubular; produced beyond the upper lip, opening
laterally or sublaterally, emarginate between; crown of the head scarcely raised above the
face line; ears thin, generally covered with glandular papillae; tragus long, attenuated towards
the tip, and inclined outwards; thumb very large, with a large, strongly curved claw; wings
around interfemoral membrane very hairy.--Dobson.

NO. 99. HARPIOCEPHALUS HARPIA. Lasiurus Pearsonii (Horsfield) (Jerdon's No. 50).

HABITAT.--Darjeeling and Khasia hills.

DESCRIPTION.--"Fur above very soft, silky, and rather long; colour on the head, neck, and shoulders
brownish grey, with a ferruginous cast, variegated with whitish hairs; the rest of the body
above, with the base of the membrane, the thighs and the interfemoral membrane, have a deep
bay or reddish-brown hue, and delicate hairs of the same colour are scattered over the membrane
and project from its border; the body underneath is thickly covered with a grey fur, which
is paler on the breast and body; the interfemoral membrane marked with regularly parallel transverse
lines" (Horsfield). Ears ovoid; tragus rather long, nearly straight, acute at the tip (Jerdon).
Muzzle rather short, obtusely conical; end of nose projecting considerably beyond the lip,
consisting of diverging tubular nostrils opening laterally, with a slight emargination between
each (Dobson). Hodgson, who procured it at Darjeeling, writes of it: "Entire legs and caudal
membrane clad in fur like the body, which is thick and woolly. Colour bright rusty above; sooty
below, the hairs tipped with hoary."

[Figure: Skull of Harpiocephalus harpia.]

This bat is, for its size, one of the most powerfully armed with teeth. The skull reminds one
of that of a dog or hyaena in miniature; the teeth are very stout, the canines blunt and conical,
and the cusps of the molars short and blunt, well coated with enamel; the jaws are correspondingly
muscular and adapted to the food of the animal, which consists of hard-shelled beetles, the
crushed cases of which have been found in its stomach.

NO. 100. HARPIOCEPHALUS (MURINA) SUILLUS. The Pig-Bat (Jerdon's No. 51).

HABITAT.--Darjeeling (Jerdon); Malayan archipelago.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle narrow, elongated; nostrils very prominent, which, viewed from below,
resemble in shape a small hour-glass placed horizontally at the extremity of the muzzle; ears
moderate, shorter than the head, rounded at the tips; tragus moderately long, attenuated above
and slightly curved outwards; fur light greyish-brown; extremities dark brown; beneath light
greyish-brown throughout.--Dobson.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1-3/4 to 2 inches; tail, 1-1/2 inch; expanse 9 to 10.

NO. 101. HARPIOCEPHALUS AURATUS.

HABITAT.--Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Head and muzzle as in H. suillus, but the nostrils are differently shaped; each
nostril forms a distinct tube directed sublaterally with a circular aperture marked by a very
small notch on the outer and upper margin (Dobson). The whole body is thickly clad; the fur
on the back is black, with bright golden yellow tips; the back of the fore-arm covered with
short golden hair; the hair of the under parts black with silvery tips, whiter on the lower
jaw, neck and pubis; the interfemoral membrane is covered with very long hair, which forms
a fringe along its free margin extending on the legs and feet, and projecting beyond the toes;
underneath short silvery hair.

SIZE.--Head and body 1.4 inch; tail 1.2.

NO. 102. HARPIOCEPHALUS GRISEUS.

HABITAT.--Jeripani, N.W. Himalayas.

DESCRIPTION.--Head and muzzle as in H. suillus; fur above dark brown, with yellowish-brown
extremities; beneath similar, but with the extreme points of the hairs ashy.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.4 inch; tail 1 inch.

This bat was found near Mussoorie by Captain Hutton, who writes that it occurs, but sparingly,
on the outer southern range of hills at 5500 feet. It skims close to the ground, and somewhat
leisurely over the surface of the crops and grass; and one which flew into his room kept low
down, passing under chairs and tables, instead of soaring towards the ceiling, as bats generally
do.

NO. 103. HARPIOCEPHALUS LEUCOGASTER.

HABITAT.--N.W. Himalayas, Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Head and muzzle as in H. harpia; fur long and dense, above brown with grey bases;
underneath whitish; sides light brown. It differs from the next species by a small projecting
tooth on the inner margin of the ear conch, by the smaller size of the first upper premolar,
and by the colour.--Dobson.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.9 inch; tail 1.5.

NO. 104. HARPIOCEPHALUS CYCLOTIS.

HABITAT.--Darjeeling, Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Similar to the last, but with round ears; fur bicoloured, the hairs being dark
brown at the base, with bright ferruginous tips; below pale brown; the upper surface of the
interfemoral membrane and back of the feet covered with hair, which also extends beyond the
toes; the first premolar in the upper jaw nearly equal in size to the second, whereas in the
last species it is only about three-fourths.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1.7 inch; tail, 1.5.

GENUS KERIVOULA.

The generic name of this bat is composed of two Singhalese words--kehel or kela, the plantain,
and voulha, which is the Singhalese for bat, the specimen on which Gray founded his genus being
the following:--

NO. 105. KERIVOULA PICTA. The Painted Bat (Jerdon's No. 53).

HABITAT.--India generally, Burmah and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--"Fur fine, woolly; above yellowish-red or golden rufous, beneath less brilliant
and more yellow; wing membranes inky black, with rich orange stripes along the fingers extending
in indentations into the membrane."--Jerdon.

Ears moderate, laid forwards; the tips reach midway between the eyes and the middle of the
muzzle; tragus very long and straight; thumb short; wings to the base of the toes.

This beautiful little bat is found all over India, but is not common; it is occasionally caught
in plantain gardens, as it resorts to the leaves of that tree for shelter during the night,
and may sometimes be discovered in the folds of a leaf. As Jerdon remarks, it looks more like
a butterfly or a moth when disturbed during the day time. Dr. Dobson pertinently observes that
the colours of this bat appear to be the result of the "protective mimicry" which we see so
often in insects, the Mantidea and other genera, the colours being adapted to their abiding
places. (Nephelium [Scytalia] longanum) [the ash phul of Bengal]. This bat was named by Pallas
Vespertilio pictus. Boddaert in 1785 termed it Vesp. kerivoula, and Gray afterwards took the
second specific name for that of the genus, leaving the first as it is.

KERIVOULA PALLIDA. (Jerdon's No. 54.)

This is synonymous with Vespertilio formosus, which see further on, it is the same as the Kerivoula
formosa of Gray.

       *       *       *       *       *

We have now concluded our notice of Indian bats but yet much is to be discovered concerning
them. Very little is known of the habits of these small nocturnal animals, only a few of the
most familiar large ones are such as one can discourse upon in a popular way; the lives and
habits of the rest are a blank to us. We see them flit about rapidly in the dusky evening,
and capture one here and there, but, after a bare description, in most cases very uninteresting
to all save those who are "bat fanciers," what can be said about them? Many of them have been
written about for a century, yet how little knowledge has been gained! It has been no small
labour to collate all the foregoing species, and to compare them with various works; it would
have been a most difficult task but for the assistance I have received from Dr. Dobson's book,
which every naturalist should possess if he desires to have a thorough record of all the Indian
Chiroptera.

INSECTIVORA.

These are mostly small animals of, with few exceptions, nocturnal habits.

Their chief characteristic lies in their pointed dentition, which enable them to pierce and
crush the hard-shelled insects on which they feed. The skull is elongated, the bones of the
face and jaw especially, and those of the latter are comparatively weak. Before we come to
the teeth we may notice some other peculiarities of this order.

The limbs are short, feet five-toed and plantigrade, with the entire sole placed on the ground
in running, and these animals are all possessed of clavicles which in the next order are but
rudimentary; in this respect they legitimately follow the Bats. The mammae are placed under
the abdomen, and are more than two. None of them (except Tupaia) have a caecum (this genus
has been most exhaustively described in all its osteological details by Dr. J. Anderson: see
his 'Anatomical and Zoological Researches'); the snout is usually prolonged and mobile. The
dentition is eccentric, and not always easy to determine; some have long incisors in front,
followed by other incisors along the sides of their narrow jaws and canines, all shorter than
the molars; others have large separated canines, between which are placed small incisors. In
Blyth's additions to Cuvier he states that "in this group we are led to identify the canine
tooth as simply the first of the false molars, which in some has two fangs, and, as in the
Lemurs, to perceive that the second in the lower jaw is in some more analogous in size and
character to an ordinary canine than that which follows the incisors. The incisor teeth are
never more than six in number, which is the maximum throughout placental mammalia (as opposed
by marsupial), and in several instances one or two pairs are deficient. (It should be remarked
that a single tooth with two fangs is often represented by two separate teeth, each with one
fang.) The canines, with the succeeding false molars, are extremely variable, but there are
ordinarily three tuberculated molars posterior to the representative of the carnivorous or
cutting grinder of the true Carnivora." All the molar teeth are studded with sharp points or
cusps; the deciduous teeth are developed and disappear before birth. This order is divided
into four families, viz., Talpidae or Moles, Sorecidae or Shrews, Erinaceidae or Hedgehogs,
and the Tupaiadae, Banxrings or Tree-shrews. Of all these well-defined types are to be found
in India, but America and Africa possess various genera which we have not, such as the Condylures
(Condylura, Illiger), the Shrew-moles (Scalops, Cuvier), belonging to Talpidae; the Solendons,
Desmans, and Chrysochlores to Sorecidae; the Sokinahs, Tenrecs and Gymnures to Erinaceidae;
and the Macroscelles or Elephant-mice of the Cape Colony form another group more allied to
Tupaia than the rest. This last family is the most interesting. Anatomically belonging to this
order, they externally resemble the squirrels so closely as to have been frequently mistaken
for them. The grovelling Mole and creeping Shrew are as unlike the sprightly Tupaia, as it
springs from branch to branch, whisking its long bushy tail, as it is possible to conceive.
I intend further on to give an illustration of this little animal. The first we have on record
concerning it is in the papers relating to Captain Cook's third voyage, which are now in the
British Museum, where the animal is described and figured as Sciurus dissimilis; it was obtained
at Pulo Condore, an island 100 miles from Saigon, in 1780.

Sir T. Stamford Raffles was the next to describe it, which he did under the generic name Tupaia--tupai
being a Malayan word applied to various squirrel-like small animals--but he was somewhat forestalled
in the publication of his papers by MM. Diard and Duvaucel. Dr. Anderson relates how Sir T.
Raffles engaged the services of these two naturalists to assist him in his researches, on the
understanding that the whole of the observations and collections were to be the property of
the East India Company; but ultimately on this point there arose a disagreement between them,
and the paper that was first read before the Asiatic Society of Bengal on the 10th of March,
1820, was drawn up by MM. Diard and Duvaucel, though forwarded by Sir T. Raffles, whose own
paper on the subject was not read before the Linnean Society until the 5th of December of that
year, nor published till 1821; therefore to the others belongs the credit of first bringing
this curious group to notice.

They regarded it in the light of a true Shrew, disguised in the form and habits of a squirrel,
and they proposed for it the name Sorex-Glis, i.e. Shrew-squirrel (Glis properly means a dormouse,
but Linnaeus used it for his rodential group which he termed Glires); this was afterwards changed
by Desmarest and Giebel to Gli Sorex and Glisosorex, which latter stands for one of the generic
terms applied to the group. F. Cuvier, objecting to Tupaia, proposed Cladobates (signifying
branch walkers), and Temminck, also objecting to Tupaia, suggested Hylogale (from Gr. hyla,
forest, and gale, a weasel), so now we have four generic names for this one small group. English
naturalists have however accepted Tupaia; and, as Dr. Anderson fairly remarks, though it is
a pity that some definite rules are not laid down for the guidance of naturalists for the acceptance
or rejection of terms, still those who reject Tupaia on the ground of its being taken from
a savage tongue should be consistent, and refuse all others of similar origin. He is quite
right; but how many we should have to reject if we did so--Siamanga in Quadrumana, Kerivoula
in Cheiroptera, Tupaia in Insectivora, Golunda in Rodentia, Rusa in Ruminantia, and others!
At the same time these names are wrong; they convey no meaning; and had they a meaning (which
only Kerivoula or Kelivoulha, i.e. plantain-bat, has) it is not expressed in languages common
to all western nations, such as the Latin and Greek. Tupaia is an unfortunate selection, inasmuch
as it does not apply to one type of animal, but reminds me somewhat of the Madras puchi, which
refers, in a general way, to most creeping insects, known or unknown.

FAMILY TALPIDAE--THE MOLES.

These animals have a small cylindrical body, very short arm attached to a large shoulder-blade,
supported by a stout clavicle or collar-bone. The fore-feet are of great breadth, supported
by the powerful muscles of the arm; the palm of the foot or hand is directed outwards or backwards,
the lower edge being trenchant, with scarcely perceptible fingers armed with long, flat nails,
strong and sharp, with which to tear up the ground and shovel the earth aside. The hind feet
are small and weak in comparison, with slender claws. The head tapers to a point, the long
snout being provided with a little bone which assists it in rooting, and the cervical muscles
are very strong. The eyes are microscopical, and almost concealed in the fur. At one time it
was a popular delusion that the mole was devoid of the power of sight, but this is not the
case. The sense of hearing is extremely acute, and the tympanum is large, although externally
there is no aural development. The tail is short, the fur set vertically in the skin, whence
it is soft and velvety. The bones of the pubis do not join, and the young when produced are
large. The mammae are six in number. The jaws are weak, the incisors are six above and eight
below. The canines (false molars?) have two roots. There are four false molars above and three
below, and three molars with pointed cusps.

Moles live principally on earth-worms, snails, and small insects, though they are also said
to devour frogs and small birds. They are more common in Europe than in India, where the few
known species are only to be found in hilly parts. I have, I think, procured them on the Satpura
range some years ago, but I cannot speak positively to the fact at this lapse of time, as I
had not then devoted much attention to the smaller mammalia, and it is possible that my supposed
moles were a species of shrew.

They are seldom if ever trapped in India, for the simple reason that they are not considered
worth trapping, and the destruction of moles in England has long been carried on in the same
spirit of ignorance which led farmers, both there and in France, to destroy small birds wholesale,
till they did themselves much injury by the multiplication of noxious insects. Moles, instead
of being the farmers' foes, are the farmers' friends. Mr. Buckland in his notes to Gilbert
White's 'Natural History of Selborne'(Macmillan's edition de luxe of 1876)--says: "After dinner
we went round the sweetstuff and toy booths in the streets, and the vicar, my brother-in-law,
the Rev. H. Gordon, of Harting, Petersfield, Hants, introduced me to a merchant of gingerbread
nuts who was a great authority on moles. He tends cows for a contractor who keeps a great many
of the animals to make concentrated milk for the navy. The moles are of great service; eat
up the worms that eat the grass, and wherever the moles have been afterwards the grass grows
there very luxuriantly. When the moles have eaten all the grubs and the worms in a certain
space, they migrate to another, and repeat their gratuitous work. The grass where moles have
been is always the best for cows." In another place he says: "M. Carl Vogt relates an instance
of a landed proprietor in France who destroyed every mole upon his property. The next season
his fields were ravaged with wire-worms, and his crops totally destroyed. He then purchased
moles of his neighbours, and preserved them as his best friends."

The poor little despised mole has had its part to play in history. My readers may remember
that William the Third's horse is supposed to have put his foot into a mole-pit, and that the
king's death was hastened by the unconscious agency of "the little gentleman in black," who
was so often toasted afterwards by the Jacobites.

HABITAT.--The Eastern Himalayan range.

NATIVE NAMES.--Pariam, Lepcha; Biyu-kantyen, Bhotia (Jerdon).

DESCRIPTION.--Velvety black, with a greyish sheen in certain lights; snout nude; eyes apparently
wanting. Jerdon says there is no perforation of the integument over the eyes, but this I doubt,
and think that by examination with a lens an opening would be discovered, as in the case of
the Apennine mole, which M. Savi considered to be quite blind. I hope to have an opportunity
of testing this shortly. The feet are fleshy white, also the tail, which, as its specific name
implies, is very small. "There are three small upper premolars between the quasi-canine tooth
and the large scissor-toothed premolar, which is much developed."

SIZE.--Length, 4-3/4 to 5 inches; head alone, 1-3/4; palm with claws, 7/8 inch; tail, 3/16
of an inch or less.

Jerdon says: "This mole is not uncommon at Darjeeling, and many of the roads and pathways in
the station are intersected by its runs, which often proceed from the base of some mighty oak-tree
to that of another. If these runs are broken down or holes made in them they are generally
repaired during the night. The moles do not appear to form mole-hills as in Europe." Jerdon's
specimens were dead ones picked up, as the Lepchas do not know how to trap them.

NO. 123. TALPA MACRURA. The Long-tailed Mole (Jerdon's No. 68).

HABITAT.--Sikim.

DESCRIPTION.--Deep slaty blue, with a whitish or hoary gloss, iridescent when wet; the tail
covered with soft hair.

SIZE.--Head and body, 4 inches; tail, 1-1/4 inch; head alone, 1-1/8 inch; palm, 3/4 inch.

NO. 124. TALPA LEUCURA (Blyth). The White-tailed Mole.

HABITAT.--Sylhet, Burmah (Tenasserim).

DESCRIPTION.--Similar to micrura, but with a short tail covered with white hairs, and it has
one premolar less.

FAMILY SORECIDAE.

Small animals, which from their size, shape, and nocturnal habits are frequently confounded
with rats and mice, as in the case of the common Indian Shrew, known to most of us as the Musk-rat;
they have distinct though small eyes, distinct ears, the conch of which is like that of a mouse.
The tail thick and tapering, whence the generic name Pachyura, applied by De Selys Longchamp,
and followed latterly by Blyth; but there is also a sub-family of bats to which the term has
been applied. "On each flank there is a band of stiff closely-set bristles, from between which,
during the rutting season, exudes an odorous fluid, the product of a peculiar gland" (Cuvier);
the two middle superior incisors are hooked and dentated at the base, the lower ones slanted
and elongated; five small teeth follow the larger incisors on the upper jaw, and two those
on the lower. There are three molars with sharp-pointed cusps in each jaw, with a small tuberculous
tooth in the upper. The feet are five-toed, separate, not webbed like the moles; the snout
is long and pointed and very mobile.

This family has been subdivided in various genera by naturalists, each one having his followers;
and it is puzzling to know which to adopt. Simplicity being the great point to aim at in all
these matters, I may broadly state that Shrews are divided into land and water shrews (Sorex
and Hydrosorex); the former includes Crocidura of Wagner, Corsira of Gray, and Anurosorex of
Milne-Edwards, the latter Crossopus and Chimarrogale, Gray.

For ages both in the West and East this poor little animal has been the victim of ignorance.
It is pleasant to think that such barbarities have now ceased, for though shrew ashes are to
be found in various parts of England, I have never heard (in my own county, Derbyshire, at
least) of the necessity for their use. In an article I contributed to a magazine some thirteen
years ago, I pointed out a coincident superstition prevailing in India. Whilst marching as
a Settlement officer in the district of Seonee, I noticed that one of my camels had a sore
back and on inquiring into the cause was told by the natives that a musk-rat (our commonest
shrew) had run over him. Jerdon also remarks that in Southern India (Malabar) the bite of S.
murinus is considered venomous, and so it is in Bengal.

GENUS SOREX (Linn.).

SYNONYM.--Pachyura, De S. Long; Crocidura, Wagner.

[Figure: Dentition of Shrew (magnified).]

DESCRIPTION.--Upper front teeth large; "inferior incisors entire, or rarely so much as the
trace of a serrated upper edge;" between these and the first cutting molar four teeth as follows:
large, small, middling, very small; teeth wholly white; tail thick and tapering, with a few
scattered hairs, some with glands secreting a pungent musky odour, some without.

NATIVE NAME.--Chachhunder, Hind.; Sondeli, Canarese.

HABITAT.--India generally.

DESCRIPTION.--Bluish gray, sometimes slightly mouse-coloured; naked parts flesh-coloured.

SIZE.--Head and body, 6 to 7 inches; tail 3-1/2 to 4 inches.

This little animal is almost too well known, as far as its appearance is concerned, to need
much description, though most erroneous ideas prevail about its habits. It is proverbially
difficult to uproot an old-established prejudice; and, though amongst my friends I have been
fighting its battles for the poor little shrew for years, I doubt whether I have converted
many to my opinions. Certainly its appearance and its smell go strongly against it--the latter
especially--but even here its powers are greatly exaggerated. I think by this time the old
fallacy of musk-rats tainting beer and wine in bottles by simply running over them is exploded.
When I came out in 1856 it was a common thing at the mess table, or in one's own house, to
reject a bottle of beer or wine, because it was "musk-ratty;" but how seldom is the complaint
made now since country-bottled beverages are not used? Jerdon, Kellaart, and every Indian naturalist
scouts the idea of this peculiar power to do what no chemist has yet succeeded in, viz., the
creation of an essence subtle enough to pass through glass. That musky bottles were frequent
formerly is due to impregnated corks and insufficient washing before the bottle was filled.
The musk-rat in a quiescent state is not offensive, and its odour is more powerful at certain
seasons. I am peculiarly sensitive to smells, and dislike that of musk in particular, yet I
have no objection to a musk-rat running about my room quietly if I do not startle him. I never
allow one to be killed, and encourage their presence in the house, for I think the temporary
inconvenience of a whiff of musk is amply repaid by the destruction of the numerous objectionable
insects which lurk in the corners of Indian houses. The notion that they do damage by gnawing
is an erroneous one, the mischief done by mice and rats being frequently laid to their charge;
they have not the powerful dentition necessary for nibbling through wood and mortar. In my
book on 'Camp Life in Seonee,' I say a good word for my little friends, and relate as follows
an experiment which I tried many years ago: "We had once been talking at mess about musk-rats;
some one declared a bottle of sherry had been tainted, and nobody defended the poor little
beast but myself, and I was considerably laughed at. However, one night soon after, as I was
dressing before dinner, I heard a musk-rat squeak in my room. Here was a chance. Shutting the
door, I laid a clean pocket-handkerchief on the ground next to the wall, knowing the way in
which the animal usually skirts round a room; on he came and ran over the handkerchief, and
then, seeing me, he turned and went back again. I then headed him once more and quietly turned
him; and thus went on till I had made him run over the handkerchief five times. I then took
it up, and there was not the least smell. I then went across to the mess house, and, producing
the handkerchief, asked several of my brother officers if they could perceive any peculiar
smell about it. No, none of them could. 'Well, all I know is,' said I, 'that I have driven
a musk-rat five times over that pocket-handkerchief just now.'"

When I was at Nagpore in 1864 I made friends with one of these shrews, and it would come out
every evening at my whistle and take grasshoppers out of my fingers. It seemed to be very short-sighted,
and did not notice the insect till quite close to my hand, when, with a short swift spring,
it would pounce upon its prey.

A correspondent of The Asian, writing from Ceylon, gives an account of a musk-rat attacking
a large frog, and holding on to it in spite of interference.

McMaster says that these shrews will also eat bread, and adds: "insects, however, form their
chief diet, so they thus do us more good than harm. I once disturbed one that evidently had
been eating part of a large scorpion."

NO. 126. SOREX MURINUS. The Mouse-coloured Shrew (Jerdon's No. 70).

HABITAT.--India generally, Burmah and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Brownish-grey above, paler beneath; fur coarser and longer than in the last species,
and in the young ones the colour is more of a bluish-grey, browner on the back. The ears are
larger than those of S. caerulescens; tail nearly equal to the body, thick at the base, and
sparsely covered with long coarse hairs; feet and tail flesh-coloured in the living animal.

SIZE.--Head and body about 6 inches; tail, 3-1/2 inches.

"This," as Jerdon says, "is the common musk-rat of China, Burmah, and the Malayan countries,
extending into Lower Bengal and Southern India, especially the Malabar Coast, where it is said
to be the common species, the bite of which is considered venomous by the natives." Kellaart
mentions it in Ceylon as the "common musk shrew or rat of Europeans;" but he confuses it with
the last species. He gives the Singhalese name as "koone meeyo." The musky odour of this species
is less powerful, and is almost absent in the young. Blyth states that he was never able to
obtain a specimen of it in Lower Bengal, yet the natives here discriminate between the light
and dark-coloured shrews, and hold, with the people of Malabar, that the bite of the latter
is venomous. Horsfield states that it has been found in Upper India, Nepal, and Assam, and
he gives the vernacular name in the last-named country as "seeka."

NO. 127. SOREX NEMORIVAGUS. The Nepal Wood Shrew (Jerdon's No. 71).

HABITAT.--Nepal.

DESCRIPTION.--Differs from the last "by a stouter make, by ears smaller and legs entirely nude,
and by a longer and more tetragonal tail; colour sooty black, with a vague reddish smear; the
nude parts fleshy grey; snout to rump, 3-5/8 inches; tail, 2 inches, planta, 11/16 inch. Found
only in woods and coppices."--Hodgson.

NO. 128. SOREX SERPENTARIUS. The Rufescent Shrew (Jerdon's No. 72).

HABITAT.--Southern India, Burmah and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Colour dusky greyish, with rufous brown tips to the hairs (Blyth). Above dusky
slate colour with rufescent tips to the fur; beneath paler, with a faint rufous tinge about
the breast (Jerdon). Fur short ashy-brown, with a ferruginous smear on the upper surface; beneath
a little paler coloured (Kellaart). Teeth and limbs small; tail slender.

The smell of this musk shrew is said by Kellaart, who names it S. Kandianus, to be quite as
powerful as that of S. caerulescens. Blyth seems to think that this animal gets more rufescent
with age, judging from two examples sent from Mergui. By some oversight, I suppose, he has
not included this species in his 'Catalogue of the Mammals of Burmah.'

NO. 129. SOREX SATURATIOR. The Dark Brown Shrew (Jerdon's No. 73).

HABITAT.--Darjeeling.

DESCRIPTION.--"Colour uniform deep brown, inclining to blackish, with a very slight rufescent
shade; fur short, with an admixture of a few lengthened piles, when adpressed to the body smooth,
but reversed somewhat harsh and rough; tail cylindrical, long, gradually tapering; mouth elongated,
regularly attenuated, ears moderate, rounded."

SIZE.--Head and body, 5-1/2 inches; tail, 3 inches.

Jerdon seems to think this is the same as S. Griffithi or closely allied; I cannot say anything
about this, as I have no personal knowledge of the species, but on comparison with the description
of S. Griffithi (which see further on) I should say they were identical.

NO. 130. SOREX TYTLERI. The Dehra Shrew (Jerdon's No. 74).

HABITAT.--Dehra Doon.

DESCRIPTION.--"Light rufescent sandy brown, paler beneath; unusually well clad even on the
feet and tail, this last being covered with shortish fur having numerous long hairs intermixed;
form very robust; basal portion of tail very thick."

NO. 131. SOREX NIGER. The Neilgherry Wood Shrew (Jerdon's No. 75).

HABITAT.--Ootacamund, Neilgherry hills.

DESCRIPTION.--"Blackish-brown, with a rufescent shade on the upper parts; abdomen greyish;
tail equal in length to the entire animal, exclusive of the head, gradually tapering to a point;
snout greatly attenuated. Length of head and body, 3-1/2 inches; of the tail, 2-1/2 inches."--Horsfield.

NO. 132. SOREX LEUCOPS. The Long-tailed Shrew (Jerdon's No. 76).

HABITAT.--Nepal.

DESCRIPTION.--Uniform blackish-brown colour; tail very long and slender, exceeding in length
the head and body, terminating in a whitish tip of half an inch long.

SIZE.--Head and body, 3 inches; tail, 2-1/2 inches. Jerdon supposes that it is found at great
altitudes, from Hodgson having in another place described it (MSS.) under the name nivicola.

NO. 133. SOREX SOCCATUS. The Hairy-footed Shrew (Jerdon's No. 77).

HABITAT.--Nepal, Sikim, Mussoorie. This animal was caught in a wood plentifully watered, but
not near the water. It had no musky smell when brought to me dead."

NO. 134. SOREX MONTANUS. The Ceylon Black Shrew.

HABITAT.--Ceylon, mountainous parts.

DESCRIPTION.--"Fur above sooty black without any ferruginous smear, beneath lighter coloured;
whiskers long, silvery grey; some parts of legs and feet greyish, clothed with adpressed hairs;
claws short, whitish; ears large, round, naked; outer margin lying on a level with the fur
of the head and neck, the ears being thus concealed posteriorly; tail tetragonal, tapering,
shorter than head and body."--Kellaart.

SIZE.--Head and body, 3-3/4 inches; tail, 2-1/4 inches; hind feet, 1/3 inch.

NO. 135. SOREX FERRUGINEUS. The Ceylon Rufescent Shrew.

HABITAT.--Ceylon, Dimboola, below Newara Elia.

NO. 136. SOREX GRIFFITHI. The Large Black Shrew.

HABITAT.--Khasia hills and Arracan.

DESCRIPTION.--"Deep blackish-brown, with a slight rufous reflection in a certain light; fur
short, close, soft, and adpressed; tail thick at the base, with a few long very slender straggling
hairs along its entire length; ears small and rounded; snout elongated."--Horsfield.

SIZE.--Head and body, 5-3/4 inches; tail, 2-1/2 inches.

Horsfield puts this down as having been found in Afghanistan by Griffiths, but this is an error
owing to Griffiths' Afghanistan and Khasia collections having got mixed up.

NO. 137. SOREX HETERODON.

HABITAT.--Khasia hills.

DESCRIPTION.--"Very similar to S. soccatus in general appearance, but less dark coloured, with
shorter fur, and pale instead of blackish feet and tail underneath; the feet too are broader,
especially the hind feet, and they have a hairy patch below the heel" (Blyth). The skull is
narrower, and the upper incisors less strongly hooked.

GENUS FEROCULUS.

Teeth small; upper incisors shorter and less strongly hooked than in restricted Sorex; posterior
spur large; lower incisors serrated with three coronal points. Feet very large.

NO. 138. FEROCULUS MACROPUS. The Large-footed Shrew.

HABITAT.--Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur, long, soft uniform blackish--faint rufescent tinge.

SIZE.--Head and body 4-1/4 inches; tail 2-1/4.

       *       *       *       *       *

The following species are of a more diminutive type, and are commonly called "pigmy-shrews;"
in other respects they are true shrews.

NO. 139. SOREX HODGSONI. The Nepal Pigmy-Shrew (Jerdon's No. 78).

HABITAT.--Nepal and Sikim.

DESCRIPTION.--Brown, with a slight tinge of chestnut; feet and tail furred; claws white.

Found in coppices and fields; rarely entering houses.

NO. 140. SOREX PERROTETI. The Neilgherry Pigmy-Shrew (Jerdon's No. 79).

HABITAT.--Neilgherry hills, probably also other parts of Southern India.

DESCRIPTION.--"Back deep blackish-brown; belly pale; limbs and feet brown; palms and plantae
clad with hairs; ears large, conspicuous."

SIZE.--Head and body, 1-4/12 inch; tail, 11/12 inch.

NO. 141. SOREX MICRONYX. The Small-clawed Pigmy-Shrew (Jerdon's No. 80).

HABITAT.--West Himalayas, Kumaon, Mussoorie.

DESCRIPTION.--Claws very minute, with fine hairs impending them, only to be detected by a lens;
fur paler and more chestnut-brown than any other of these minute shrews, and more silvery below.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1-5/8 inch; tail 1-1/8 inch.

NO. 142. SOREX MELANODON. The Black-toothed Pigmy-Shrew (Jerdon's No. 81).

HABITAT.--Calcutta.

DESCRIPTION.--Called melanodon from the remarkable colouring of its teeth, which are piceous
and white-tipped; colour uniform fuscous, scarcely paler beneath.

SIZE.--Head and body, 1-7/8 inch; tail, 1-1/16 inch.

NO. 143. SOREX NUDIPES. The Naked-footed Shrew.

HABITAT.--Tenasserim.

DESCRIPTION.--"Remarkable for its naked feet and very large ears; also for the odoriferous
glands on the sides being strongly developed, whereas we can detect them in no other of these
minute species" (Blyth). Colour brown above, a little grizzled and glistening, more silvery below.

NO. 144. SOREX ATRATUS. The Black Pigmy-Shrew.

HABITAT.--Khasia hills.

DESCRIPTION.--"Very dark colour, extending over the feet and tail which is even blackish underneath;
fur blackish-brown above, a little tinged rufescent, and with dark greyish underneath; the
feet and tail conspicuously furred, beside the scattered long hairs upon the latter."--Blyth.

This species was determined by Blyth on a single specimen, which was found without its head,
impaled by some shrike upon a thorn at Cherrapunji. The same thing occasionally occurs in England,
when the common shrew may be found impaled by the rufous-backed shrike (Lanius collurio).

SUB-GENUS SORICULUS (Blyth).

The foregoing species being of the white-toothed variety (with the exception of S. melanodon,
which, however, exhibits coloration decidedly the reverse of the following type), we now come
to the shrews with teeth tipped with a darker colour; the dentition is as in the restricted
shrews, with the peculiarity of colour above mentioned. The hind feet of ordinary proportions,
unadapted for aquatic habits, and the tail slender and tapering, like that of a mouse, instead
of being cylindrical with a stiff brush at the end.

NO. 145. SORICULUS NIGRESCENS. The Mouse-tailed Shrew (Jerdon's No. 82).

HABITAT.--Sikim and Nepal.

DESCRIPTION.--"Above dark-blackish or blackish-brown, slightly tinged rufescent, and with a
silvery cast in certain lights; beneath greyish-black" (Jerdon). Feet and claws pale; tail
slender, straight and naked.

SIZE.--Head and body, 3-1/4 inches; tail, 1-1/2 inch; hind foot, 5/8 inch.

Jerdon says that Kellaart named an allied species from Ceylon Corsira newera ellia, but I have
not been able to find it in his 'Prodromus Faunae Zeylanicae,' nor elsewhere.

GENUS CROSSOPUS (Wagner).

The hind feet large; the lower surface, as also of the tail, fringed with stiff hairs; tail
somewhat compressed towards the tip; habits aquatic.

NO. 146. CROSSOPUS HIMALAICUS. The Himalayan Water-Shrew (Jerdon's No. 83).

NATIVE NAMES.--Oong lagniyu, Lepcha; Choopitsi, Bhot.

HABITAT.--Darjeeling.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur dark brown above, paler beneath; rusty brown on the lower part of throat
and middle of belly, according to Jerdon; slate coloured back with scattered long hairs, which
are longer and white-tipped on the sides and rump, according to Blyth's memoir; ears very small,
hairy, concealed; tail long, slender, fringed with stiff whitish hair beneath; whiskers long
and brown.

SIZE.--Head and body, 5 to 6 inches; tail about 3-1/2 inches; hind foot, 3/4 to 11/12 inch.

Jerdon procured this water-shrew at Darjeeling in the Little Rungeet river; it is said to live
on small fish, tadpoles, water insects, &c. The movements of the English water-shrew, when
swimming, are very agile. It propels itself by alternate strokes of its hind feet, but with
an undulating motion, its sides being in a manner extended, and body flattened, showing a narrow
white border on each side; then the fur collects a mass of tiny air bubbles which make the
submerged portion glow like silver. It prefers clear still water, but at the same time will
make its way up running streams and ditches, and occasionally wanders away into fields, and
has been found in houses and barns.

Its food is principally aquatic insects, worms, mollusca, and freshwater crustacea. In Bell's
'British Quadrupeds' its mode of poking about amongst stones in search of fresh-water shrimps
(Gammarus pulex) is well described. Mr. F. Buckland states that he once dissected a water-shrew
and found the intestines to contain a dark fluid pulpy matter, which, on being examined by
a microscope, proved to consist entirely of the horny cases and legs of minute water insects.
Continental writers declare that it will attack any small animal that comes in its way, giving
it quite a ferocious character, and it is said to destroy fish spawn. I can hardly believe
in its destroying large fish by eating out their brain and eyes. Brehm, who gives it credit
for this, must have been mistaken. I have also read of its attacking a rat in a trap which
was dead, and was discovered devouring it, having succeeded in making a small hole through
the skin.

In England this animal breeds in May. The young are from five to seven in number, and are brought
forth in a small chamber in the bank, which is constructed with several openings, one of which
is usually under the level of the water.

Dr. Anderson has very fully described the Himalayan species under the name of Chimarrogale
Himalaica. He caught a specimen in a mountain stream at Ponsee in the Kakhyen hills, 3500 feet
above the sea level, and observed it running over the stones in the bed of the stream and plunging
freely into the water hunting for insects.

GENUS NYCTOGALE.

Head and skull as in Soricidae, but with palmated feet and compressed tail, as in Myogalidae.
Special characteristic, large pads on the soles of the feet, which form sucking discs.

NO. 147. NYCTOGALE ELEGANS. The Thibet Water-Shrew.

HABITAT.--Moupin in Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur of two kinds, a soft under down of slaty grey colour through which pass longer
hairs, grey at the base with white tips, "causing the animal to vary considerably in appearance
according as these hairs are raised or laid flat;" ears quite concealed, and without a conch;
tail stout, longer than the body, quadrangular at the base, then triangular, and finally flattened;
feet large and palmated, with large pads on the soles, depressed in the middle, forming sucking
discs, which are a peculiar characteristic of this animal.

SIZE.--Head and body about 3-1/2 inches; tail about 4 inches.

Though this is not properly an Indian animal, I have thought fit to include it as belonging
to a border country in which much interest is taken, and which has as yet been imperfectly
explored.

GENUS CORSIRA.

Of Gray, Amphisorex of Duvernoy; differs in dentition from the last in having the lower quasi-incisors
serrated with three or four coronal points, and the anterior point of the upper incisors not
prolonged beyond the posterior spur, tipped with ferruginous; the lateral small teeth in the
upper jaw are five in number, diminishing in size from the first backwards. Tail cylindrical,
not tapering, and furnished with a stiffish brush at the extremity. The common British land-shrew
is of this type.

NO. 148. CORSIRA ALPINA. The Alpine Shrew (Jerdon's No. 84).

HABITAT.--Darjeeling.

DESCRIPTION.--Deep blackish brown, very slightly rufescent in certain lights; tail slender,
nearly naked, very slightly attenuated, compressed at the tip.

This is identical with the European Alpine shrew; the Sorex caudatus of Horsfield's Catalogue
(No. 148), which was a specimen named by Hodgson, is also the same animal.

GENUS ANUROSOREX.

Remarkably for its large head, nude, scaly extremities, and extremely short, nude, scaly tail.
"The structure of the ear, limbs and tail has special reference to a burrowing animal--the
ear being valvular, so that it may be effectually closed against the entrance of foreign substances,
and the feet devoid of hair, but scaly, and the tail reduced to very small dimensions. The
eye is also excessively small, and buried deep in the dense silky fur. The hind feet, contrary
to what is almost invariably the case in burrowing mammals, are larger than the fore feet."--Anderson.

NO. 149. ANUROSOREX ASSAMENSIS. The Assam Burrowing Shrew.

HABITAT.--Assam, Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--General colour dark slaty, faintly washed with brownish rusty on the long hairs
of the rump; fur long and silky, longest over the rump; occasional long brown hairs with pale
tips are scattered over the body; long whiskers, yellow claws; naked parts of snout, limbs
and tail flesh-coloured.

SIZE.--Head and body nearly 3 inches; tail, 1/2 inch; forefoot, 1/2 inch; hind foot, 3/4 inch.

The skull and dentition of this animal are essentially soricine. The Thibetan species (A. squamipes)
is described as being over four inches in length, of a greyish colour, with a greenish-brown
tinge; feet and nails whitish. It lives in burrows which it digs in the earth. I think it should
properly come after the moles, which it resembles in some particulars.

FAMILY ERINACEIDAE--THE HEDGEHOGS.

The molar teeth broad; the hinder ones nearly square, the tubercles on their upper surface
rounded; the other teeth are three incisors on each side, of which the inner one is considerably
larger than the rest; behind these, separated by a little gap, come three premolars gradually
increasing in size, then one having much the appearance of a true molar, but furnished with
a cutting edge; then three molar teeth, two of which are nearly square with strong tubercles.
The last molar is small. In the lower jaw the lowermost incisor is very large, and projects
almost horizontally forwards, and it is followed by three small teeth now acknowledged to be
premolars, with another large premolar, which is of the nature of a carnassial or cutting tooth
acting on the one in the upper jaw. Then three molars as above, two large and one small, but
with sharp tubercles. The skull has a more carnivorous form; it has "a complete zygomatic arch,
and the tympanic bone forms a bundle-like swelling on each side of the back of the skull."
Feet pentadactylous or five-toed; legs very short. The tibia and fibula (two bones of the shank)
are joined together. The back is clothed with hair intermixed with sharp spines or bristles.
Tail short or wanting entirely.

[Figure: Dentition of Hedgehog.]

GENUS ERINACEUS.

The European hedgehog is well known to most of us. Few boys who have lived a country life have
been without one at some time or other as a pet. I used to keep mine in a hole at the root
of an old apple-tree, which was my special property, and they were occasionally brought into
the house at the cook's request to demolish the black-beetles in the kitchen. These they devour
with avidity and pursue them with the greatest ardour. They also eat slugs, worms, and snails;
worms they seize and eat from end to end, like a Neapolitan boy with a string of maccaroni,
slowly masticating, the unconsumed portion being constantly transferred from one side of the
mouth to the other, so that both sides of the jaws may come into play. Dr. Dallas quaintly
remarks on the process: "This must be an unpleasant operation for the worm, much as its captor
may enjoy it." Toads, frogs, mice, and even snakes are eaten by the European hedgehog. It would
be interesting to find out whether the Indian hedgehog also attacks snakes; even the viper
in Europe is devoured by this animal, who apparently takes little heed of its bite. The European
species also eats eggs when it can get them, and I have no doubt does much damage to those
birds who make their nests on the ground.

Few dogs will tackle a hedgehog, for the little creature at once rolls itself into a spiny
ball, all sharp prickles, by means of the contraction of a set of cutaneous muscles, the most
important of which, the orbicularis panniculi, form a broad band encircling the body which
draws together the edges of the spiny part of the skin. There is a most interesting account
of the mechanism of the spines in Mr. F. Buckland's notes to White's 'Natural History of Selborne,'
vol. ii., page 76. A jet of water poured on to the part within which the head is concealed
will make the creature unroll, and it is said that foxes and some dogs have discovered a way
of applying this plan, and also that foxes will roll a hedgehog into a ditch or pond, and thus
make him either expose himself to attack or drown. Gipsies eat hedgehogs, and consider them
a delicacy--the meat being white and as tender as a chicken (not quite equal to porcupine,
I should say); they cook them by rolling them in clay, and baking them till the clay is dry;
when the ball is broken open the prickles come off with the crust.

[Figure: Hedgehog.]

Hedgehogs have had several popular fallacies concerning them. They were supposed to suck cows
dry during the night and to be proof against poisons. Mr. Frank Buckland tried prussic acid
on one with fatal results, but he says the bite of a viper seemed to have no effect. Pallas,
I know, has remarked that hedgehogs will eat hundreds of cantharides beetles with impunity,
whereas one or two will cause extreme agony to a cat or dog. The female goes with young about
seven weeks, and she has from three to eight in number. The little ones when born have soft
spines--which, however, soon harden--are blind, and, with the exception of the rudimentary
prickles, quite naked. They are white at birth, but in about a month acquire the colour of
the mother.

NO. 150. ERINACEUS COLLARIS. The Collared Hedgehog (Jerdon's No. 85).

HABITAT.--Northern India and Afghanistan. Dallas says from Madras to Candahar; but Jerdon calls
it the North Indian hedgehog, and assigns to it the North-west, Punjab, and Sind, giving Southern
India to the next species.

DESCRIPTION.--Spines irregularly interwoven, ringed with white and black, with yellowish tips,
or simply white and black, or black with a white ring in the middle; ears large; chin white;
belly and legs pale brown.

SIZE.--Head and body, 8 to 9 inches; tail, 7/12 inch.

I have found this species in the Punjab near Lahore. One evening, whilst walking in the dusk,
a small animal, which I took to be a rat, ran suddenly between my legs. Now I confess to an
antipathy to rats, and, though I would not willingly hurt any animal, I could not resist an
impulsive kick, which sent my supposed rat high in the air. I felt a qualm of conscience immediately
afterwards, and ran to pick up my victim, and was sorry to find I had perpetrated such an assault
on an unoffending little hedgehog, which was however only stunned, and was carried off by me
to the Zoological Gardens. Captain Hutton writes of them that they feed on beetles, lizards,
and snails; "when touched they have the habit of suddenly jerking up the back with some force
so as to prick the fingers or mouth of the assailant, and at the same time emitting a blowing
sound, not unlike the noise produced when blowing upon a flame with a pair of bellows." He
also says they are very tenacious of life, bearing long abstinence with apparent ease; when
alarmed they roll themselves up into a ball like the European species.

Hutton also remarks that E. collaris, on hearing a noise, jerks the skin and quills of its
neck completely over its head, leaving only the tip of the nose free.

NO. 151. ERINACEUS MICROPUS. The Small-footed Hedgehog (Jerdon's No. 86).

HABITAT.--South India.

DESCRIPTION.--"Ears moderately large; form somewhat elongated; tail very short, concealed;
feet and limbs very small; head and ears nude, sooty-coloured; belly very thinly clad with
yellowish hairs; spines ringed dark brown and whitish, or whitish with a broad brown sub-terminal
ring, tipped white."--Jerdon.

SIZE.--Head and body about 6 inches. Dr. Anderson considers this as identical with E. collaris.

NO. 152. ERINACEUS PICTUS. The Painted Hedgehog.

HABITAT.--Central India, Goona, Ulwar, Agra, Kurrachee.

DESCRIPTION.--Similar to the above, but the tips of the spines are more broadly white, and
the brown bands below not so dark; the ears are somewhat larger than micropus, and the feet
narrower and not so long.

NO. 153. ERINACEUS GRAYI.

HABITAT.--North-west India.

DESCRIPTION.--The general colour is blackish-brown; the spines are narrowly tipped with black,
succeeded by a narrowish yellow band; then a blackish-brown band, the rest of the spine being
yellowish; the broad dark-brown band is so strongly developed as to give the animal its dark
appearance when viewed from the side; some animals are, however, lighter than others. The feet
are large; the fore-feet broad, somewhat truncated, with moderately long toes and powerful claws.

SIZE.--Head and body about 6-3/4 inches.

NO. 154. ERINACEUS BLANFORDI (Anderson).

HABITAT.--Sind, where one specimen was obtained by Mr. W. T. Blanford, at Rohri.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle rather short, not much pointed; ears moderately large, but broader than
long, and rounded at the tips; feet larger and broader than in the next species, with the first
toe more largely developed than in the last. The spines meet in a point on the forehead, and
there is no bare patch on the vertex. Each spine is broadly tipped with deep black, succeeded
by a very broad yellow band, followed by a dusky brown base; fur deep brown; a few white hairs
on chin and anterior angle of ear.

SIZE.--Head and body, 5.36 inches.

NO. 155. ERINACEUS JERDONI (Anderson).

HABITAT.--Sind, Punjab frontier.

DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle moderately long and pointed; ears large, round at tip and broad at base;
feet large, especially the fore-feet; claws strong. The spines begin on a line with the anterior
margins of the ears; large nude area on the vertex; spines with two white and three black bands,
beginning with a black band. When they are laid flat the animal looks black; but an erection
the white shows and gives a variegated appearance.

SIZE.--Head and body about 7-1/2 inches.

NO. 156. ERINACEUS MEGALOTIS. The Large-eared Hedgehog.

HABITAT.--Afghanistan.

More information is required about this species. Jerdon seems to think it may be the same as
described by Pallas (E. auritus), which description I have before me now ('Zoographica Rosso
Asiatica,' vol. i. page 138), but I am unable to say from comparison that the two are identical--the
ears and the muzzle are longer than in the common hedgehog. This is the species which he noticed
devouring blistering beetles with impunity. It has a very delicate fur of long silky white
hairs, covering the head, breast and abdomen, "forming also along the sides a beautiful ornamental
border" (Horsfield, from a specimen brought from Mesopotamia by Commander Jones, I.N.)

The space to which I am obliged to limit myself will not allow of my describing at greater
length; but to those of my readers who are interested in the Indian hedgehogs, I recommend
the paper by Dr. J. Anderson in the 'Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal' for 1878, page
195, with excellently drawn plates of the heads, skulls and feet of the various species. There
is one peculiarity which he notices regarding the skull of E. collaris (or, as he calls it,
micropus): the zygomatic arch is not continuous as in the other species, but is broken in the
middle, the gap being caused by the absence of the malar or cheek-bone. In this respect it
resembles, though Dr. Anderson does not notice it, the Centetidae or Tanrecs of Madagascar.

Dr. Anderson's classification is very simple and good. He has two groups: the first, containing
E. micropus and E. pictus, is distinguished by the second upper premolar simple, one-fanged,
the feet club-shaped; soles tubercular. The second group, containing E. Grayi, E. Blanfordi
and E. Jerdoni, has the second upper premolar compound, three-fanged, and the feet well developed
and broad. The first group has also a division or bare area on the vertex; the second has not.

FAMILY HYLOMIDAE (Anderson).

The following little animal has affinities to both Erinaceidae and Tupaiidae, and therefore
it may appropriately be placed here. Dr. Anderson on the above ground has placed it in a separate
family, otherwise it is generally classed with the Erinaceidae. Its skull has the general form
of the skull of Tupaia, but in its imperfect orbit, in the rudiment of a post-orbital process,
and in the absence of any imperfections of the zygomatic arch and in the position of the lachrymal
foramen it resembles the skull of Erinaceus. The teeth are 44 in number: Inc., 3--3/3--3; can.,
1--1/1--1; premolars, 4--4/4--4; molars, 3--3/3--3, and partake of the character of both Tupaia
and Erinaceus. The shank-bones being united and the rudimentary tail create an affinity to
the latter, whilst its arboreal habits are those of the former.

GENUS HYLOMYS.

Head elongate; ears round; feet arboreal, naked below; tail semi-nude; pelage not spiny.

NO. 157. HYLOMYS PEGUENSIS. The Short-tailed Tree-Shrew.

HABITAT.--Burmah, Pegu, Ponsee in the Kakhyen hills.

Appears to be identical with the species from Borneo (H. suillus).

FAMILY TUPAIIDAE.

These interesting little animals were first accurately described about the year 1820, though,
as I have before stated, it was noticed in the papers connected with Captain Cook's voyages,
but was then supposed to be a squirrel. Sir T. Stamford Raffles writes: "This singular little
animal was first observed tame in the house of a gentleman at Penang, and afterwards found
wild at Singapore in the woods near Bencoolen, where it lives on the fruit of the kayogadis,
&c." Another species, T. Javanica, had, however, been discovered in Java fourteen years before,
but not published till 1821. They are sprightly little creatures, easily tamed, and, not being
purely insectivorous, are not difficult to feed in captivity. Sir T. S. Raffles describes one
that roamed freely all over the house, presenting himself regularly at meal-times for milk
and fruit. Dr. Sal. Muller describes the other species (T. Javanica) as a confiding, simple
little animal, always in motion, seeking its food at one time amongst dry leaves and moss on
the ground, and again on the stems and branches of trees, poking its nose into every crevice.
Its nest, he says, is formed of moss at some height from the ground, supported on clusters
of orchideous plants. Dr. Cantor, in his 'Catalogue of the Mammalia of the Malayan Peninsula,'
writes as follows: "In a state of nature it lives singly or in pairs, fiercely attacking intruders
of its own species. When several are confined together they fight each other, or jointly attack
and destroy the weakest. The natural food is mixed insectivorous and frugivorous. In confinement,
individuals may be fed exclusively on either, though preference is evinced for insects; and
eggs, fish and earth-worms are equally relished. A short, peculiar, tremulous, whistling sound,
often heard by calls and answers in the Malayan jungle, marks their pleasurable emotions, as
for instance on the appearance of food, while the contrary is expressed by shrill protracted
cries. Their disposition is very restless, and their great agility enables them to perform
the most extraordinary bounds in all directions, in which exercise they spend the day, till
night sends them to sleep in their rudely-constructed lairs in the highest branches of trees.
At times they will sit on their haunches, holding their food between their forelegs, and after
feeding they smooth the head and face with both fore-paws, and lick the lips and palms. They
are also fond of water, both to drink and to bathe in. The female usually produces one young."

The above description reminds one forcibly of the habits of squirrels, so it is no wonder that
at one time these little creatures were confounded with the Sciuridae.

GENUS TUPAIA.

The dentition of this genus is as follows: Either four or six incisors in the upper jaw, but
always six in the lower; four premolars and three molars in each jaw, upper and lower. The
skull has a complete bony orbit, and the zygomatic arch is also complete, but with a small
elongated perforation; the muzzle attenuated, except in T. Ellioti; ears oval; the stomach
possesses a caecum or blind gut; the eyes are large and prominent, and the tail bushy, like
that of a squirrel; the toes are five in number, with strong claws; the shank-bones are not
united as in the hedgehogs. The diet is mixed insectivorous and frugivorous.

NO. 158. TUPAIA ELLIOTI. Elliot's Tree-Shrew (Jerdon's No. 87).

HABITAT.--Southern India, Godavery district, Cuttack; the Central Provinces, Bhagulpore range.

[Figure: Dentition of Tupaia.]

DESCRIPTION.--Fur pale rufous brown, darker on the back and paler on the sides; the chin, throat,
breast and belly yellowish, also a streak of the same under the tail; the upper surface of
the tail is of the same colour as the centre of the back; there is a pale line from the muzzle
over the eye, and a similar patch beneath it; the fur of this species is shorter and more harsh,
and the head is more blunt than in the Malayan members of the family.

SIZE.--Head and body, 7 to 8 inches; tail, 7 to 9 inches.

NO. 159. TUPAIA PEGUANA. Syn.--TUPAIA BELANGERI. The Pegu Tree-Shrew (Jerdon's No. 88).

HABITAT.--Sikim (Darjeeling), Assam and through Arakan to Tenasserim.

[Figure: Tupaia Peguana.]

DESCRIPTION.--Jerdon says: "General hue a dusky greenish-brown, the hairs being ringed brown
and yellow; lower parts the same, but lighter; and with a pale buff line; a stripe from the
throat to the vent, broadest between the forearms and then narrowing; ears livid red, with
a few short hairs; palms and soles dark livid red." Dr. Anderson remarks that the fur is of
two kinds of hairs--one fine and wavy at the extremity, banded with black, yellow and black;
the second being strong and somewhat bristly, longer than the other, and banded with a black
basal half and then followed by rings of yellow and black, then yellow again with a black tip,
the black basal half of the hairs being hidden, the annulation of the free portions produces
a rufous olive-grey tint over the body and tail.

SIZE.--Head and body about 7 inches; tail, 6-1/2.

Jerdon says of it that those he procured at Darjeeling frequented the zone from 3000 to 6000
feet; they were said by the natives to kill small birds, mice, &c. The Lepcha name he gives
is Kalli-tang-zhing. McMaster in his notes writes: "The Burmese Tupaia is a harmless little
animal; in the dry season living in trees and in the monsoon freely entering our houses, and
in impudent familiarity taking the place held in India by the common palm squirrel. It is,
however, probably from its rat-like head and thievish expression, very unpopular. I have found
them in rat-traps, however, so possibly they deserve to be so." He adds he cannot endorse the
statement regarding their extraordinary agility mentioned by Dr. Cantor and quoted by Jerdon,
for he had seen his terriers catch them, which they were never able to do with squirrels; and
cats often seize them.

Mason says: "One that made his home in the mango-tree near my house at Tonghoo made himself
nearly as familiar as the cat. Sometimes I had to drive him off the bed, and he was very fond
of putting his nose into the teacups immediately after breakfast, and acquired a taste both
for tea and coffee. He lost his life at last by incontinently walking into a rat-trap."

The Burmese name for it is Tswai in Arracan. Jerdon states that it is one of the few novelties
that had escaped the notice of Mr. Brian Hodgson, but Dr. Anderson mentions a specimen (unnamed)
from Nepal in the British Museum which was obtained by Hodgson.

NO. 160. TUPAIA CHINENSIS (Anderson).

HABITAT.--Burmah, Kakhyen hills, east of the valley of the Irrawaddy.

DESCRIPTION.--Ferruginous above, yellowish below, the basal two-thirds of the hair being blackish,
succeeded by a yellow, a black, and then a yellow and black band, which is terminal; there
is a faint shoulder streak washed with yellowish; the chest pale orange yellow, which hue extends
along the middle of the belly as a narrow line; under surfaces of limbs grizzled as on the
back, but paler; upper surface of tail concolorous with the dorsum.

SIZE.--Head and body, 6-1/2 inches; tail, 6.16.

The teeth are larger than those of T. Ellioti, but smaller than the Malayan T. ferruginea,
and the skull is smaller than that of the last species, and the teeth are also smaller. Dr.
Anderson says: "When I first observed the animal it was on a grassy clearing close to patches
of fruit, and was so comporting itself that in the distance I mistook it for a squirrel. The
next time I noticed it was in hedgerows."

The other varieties of Tupaia belong to the Malayan Archipelago--T. ferruginea, T. tana, T.
splendidula, and T. Javanica to Borneo and Java. There is one species which inhabits the Nicobars.

NO. 161. TUPAIA NICOBARICA.

HABITAT.--Nicobar Island.

DESCRIPTION.--Front and sides of the face, outside of fore-limbs, throat and chest, golden
yellow; inner side of hind limbs rich red brown, which is also the colour of the hind legs
and feet; head dark brown, with golden hairs intermixed; back dark maroon, almost black; upper
surface of the tail the same; pale oval patch between shoulders, dark band on each side between
it and fore-limbs, passing forward over the ears.

SIZE.--Head and body, 7.10; tail, 8 inches.

       *       *       *       *       *

There is a little animal allied to the genus Tupaia, which has hitherto been found only in
Borneo and Sumatra, but as Sumatran types have been found in Tenasserim, perhaps some day the
Ptilocercus Lowii may be discovered there. It has a rather shorter head than the true Banxrings,
more like T. Ellioti, but its dentition is nearly the same, as also are its habits. Its chief
peculiarity lies in its tail, which is long, slender and naked, like that of a rat for two-thirds
of its length, the terminal third being adorned with a broad fringe of hair on each side, like
the wings of an arrow or the plumes of a feather. There is an excellent coloured picture of
it in the 'Proc. Zool. Society,' vol. of Plates.

       *       *       *       *       *

I had almost concluded my sketch of the Insectivora without alluding to one most interesting
genus, which ought properly to have come between the shrews and the hedgehogs, the Gymnura,
which, though common in the Malay countries, has only recently been found in Burmah--a fact
of which I was not aware till I saw it included in a paper on Tenasserim mammals by Mr. W.
T. Blanford ('Jour. As. Soc. Beng.,' 1878, page 150). Before I refer to his notes I may state
that this animal is a sort of link between the Soricidae and the Erinaceidae, and De Blainville
proposed for it the generic name of Echinosorex, but the one generally adopted is Gymnura,
which was the specific name given to it by its discoverer, Sir Stamford Raffles, who described
it as a Viverra (V. gymnura); however, Horsfield and Vigors and Lesson, the two former in England
and the latter in France, saw that it was not a civet, and, taking the naked tail as a peculiarity,
they called the genus Gymnura, and the specimen Rafflesii. There is not much on record regarding
the anatomy of the animal, and in what respects it internally resembles the hedgehogs. Outwardly
it has the general soricine form, though much larger than the largest shrew. The long tail
too is against its resemblance to the hedgehogs, which rests principally on its spiny pelage.

The teeth in some degree resemble Erinaceus, the molars and premolars especially, but the number
in all is greater, there being forty-four, or eight more. It would be interesting to know whether
the zygomatic arch is perfect and the tibia and fibula united, as in the hedgehogs, or wanting
and distinct as in the shrews. I have given a slight sketch in outline of the animal.

NO. 162. GYMNURA RAFFLESII. The Bulau.

HABITAT.--Tenasserim (Sumatra, Borneo); Malacca.

[Figure: Gymnura Rafflesii.]

DESCRIPTION.--Long tapering head, with elongated muzzle, short legs, shrew-like body, with
a long, round, tapering and scaly rat-like tail, naked, with the exception of a few stiff hairs
here and there among the scales. In each jaw on each side three incisors, one canine (those
in the upper jaw double-fanged) and seven premolars and molars; feet five-toed, plantigrade,
armed with strong claws. Fur of two kinds, fine and soft, with longer and more spiny ones intermixed.
The colour varies a good deal, the general tint being greyish-black, with head and neck pale
or whitish, and with a broad black patch over the eye. Some have been found almost wholly white,
with the black eye-streak and only a portion of the longer hairs black, so that much stress
cannot be laid on the colouring; the tail is blackish at the base, whitish and compressed at
the tip. Mr. Blanford says: "The small scales covering the tail are indistinctly arranged in
rings and sub-imbricate; on the lower surface the scales are convex and distinctly imbricate,
the bristles arising from the interstices. Thus the under surface of the tail is very rough,
and may probably be of use to the animal in climbing." He also refers to the fact that the
claws of his specimen are not retractile, and mentions that in the original description both
in Latin and English the retractability of the claws is pointed out as a distinction between
Gymnura and Tupaia. In the description given of the Sumatran animal both by Dallas and Cuvier
nothing is mentioned about this feature.

SIZE.--A Sumatran specimen: head and body, 14 inches; tail, 12 inches. Mr. Blanford's specimen:
head and body, 12 inches; tail, 8.5.

Mr. Blanford was informed by Mr. Davison, who obtained it in Burmah, that the Gymnura is purely
nocturnal in its habits, and lives under the roots of trees. It has a peculiar and most offensive
smell, resembling decomposed cooked vegetables. The Bulau has not the power of rolling itself
up like the hedgehog, nor have the similar forms of insectivores which resemble the hedgehog
in some respects, such as the Tenrecs (Centetes), Tendracs (Ericulus), and Sokinahs (Echinops)
of Madagascar.

CARNIVORA.

Speaking generally, the whole range of mammals between the Quadrumana and the Rodentia are
carnivorous with few exceptions, yet there is one family which, from its muscular development
and dentition, is pre-eminently flesh-eating, as Cuvier aptly remarks, "the sanguinary appetite
is combined with the force necessary for its gratification." Their forms are agile and muscular;
their circulation and respiration rapid. As Professor Kitchen Parker graphically writes: "This
group, which comprises all the great beasts of prey, is one of the most compact as well as
the most interesting among the mammalia. So many of the animals contained in it have become
'familiar in our mouths as household words,' bearing as they do an important part in fable,
in travel, and even in history; so many of them are of such wonderful beauty, so many of such
terrible ferocity, that no one can fail to be interested in them, even apart from the fact
likely to influence us more in their favour than any other, that the two home pets, which of
all others are the commonest and the most interesting, belong to the group. No one who has
had a dog friend, no one who has watched the wonderful instance of maternal love afforded by
a cat with her kittens, no one who loves riding across country after a fox, no lady with a
taste for handsome furs, no boy who has read of lion and tiger hunts and has longed to emulate
the doughty deeds of the hunter, can fail to be interested in an assemblage which furnishes
animals at once so useful, so beautiful and so destructive. It must not be supposed from the
name of this group that all its members are exclusively flesh-eaters, and indeed it will be
hardly necessary to warn the reader against falling into this mistake, as there are few people
who have never given a dog a biscuit, or a bear a bun. Still both the dog and several kinds
of bears prefer flesh-meat when they can get it, but there are some bears which live almost
exclusively on fruit, and are, therefore, in strictness not carnivorous at all. The name must,
however, be taken as a sort of general title for a certain set of animals which have certain
characteristics in common, and which differ from all other animals in particular ways." I would
I had more space at my disposal for further quotations from Professor Parker's 'General Remarks
on the Land Carnivora,' his style is so graphic.

The dentition of the Carnivora varies according to the exclusiveness of their fleshy diet,
and the nature of that diet.

In taking two typical forms I give below sketches from skulls in my possession of the tiger,
and the common Indian black bear; the one has trenchant cutting teeth which work up and down,
the edges sliding past each other just like a pair of scissors; the other has flat crowned
molars adapted for triturating the roots and herbage on which it feeds. A skull of an old bear
which I have has molars of which the crowns are worn almost smooth from attrition. In the most
carnivorous forms the tubercular molars are almost rudimentary.

[Figure: Dentition of Tiger and Indian Black Bear]

The skull exhibits peculiar features for the attachment of the necessary powerful muscles.
The bones of the face are short in comparison with the cranial portion of the skull (the reverse
of the Herbivores); the strongly built zygomatic arch, the roughened ridges and the broad ascending
ramus of the lower jaw, all afford place for the attachment of the immense muscular development.
Then the hinge of the jaw is peculiar; it allows of no lateral motion, as in the ruminants;
the condyle, or hinge-bolt of a tiger's jaw (taken from the largest in my collection), measures
two inches, and as this fits accurately into its corresponding (glenoid) cavity, there can
be no side motion, but a vertical chopping one only. The skeleton of a typical carnivore is
the perfection of strength and suppleness. The tissue of the bones is dense and white; the
head small and beautifully articulated; the spine flexible yet strong. In those which show
the greatest activity, such as the cats, civets and dogs, the spinous processes, especially
in the lumbar region, are greatly developed--more so than in the bears. These serve for the
attachment of the powerful muscles of the neck and back. The clavicle or collar-bone is wanting,
or but rudimentary. The stomach is simple; the intestinal canal short; liver lobed; organs
of sight, hearing, and smell much developed.

Now we come to the divisions into which this group has been separated by naturalists. I shall
not attempt to describe the various systems, but take the one which appears to me the simplest
and best to fit in with Cuvier's general arrangement, which I have followed. Modern zoologists
have divided the family into two great groups--the Fissipedia (split-feet) or land Carnivora,
and the Pinnipedia (fin-feet) or water Carnivora. Of the land Carnivora some naturalists have
made the following three groups on the characteristics of the feet, viz., Plantigrada, Sub-plantigrada
and Digitigrada. The dogs and cats, it is well known, walk on their toes--they are the Digitigrada;
the bears and allied forms on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, more or less,
and thus form the other two divisions, but there is another classification which recommends
itself by its simplicity and accuracy. Broadly speaking, there are three types of land carnivores--the
cat, the dog, and the bear, which have been scientifically named AEluroidea (from the Greek
ailouros, a cat); Cynoidea (from kuon, a dog); and Arctoidea (from arctos, a bear). The distinction
is greater between the families of Digitigrades, the cat and dog, than between the Plantigrades
and Sub-plantigrades, and therefore I propose to adopt the following arrangement:--

I. ARCTOIDEA |Plantigrades.
             |Sub-plantigrades.

II. AELUROIDEA |
               |Digitigrades.
III. CYNOIDEA  |

I may here remark that the Insectivora are in most cases plantigrade, therefore the term is
not an apposite one as applied to the bear and bear-like animals only, but in treating of them
under the term Arctoidea we may divide them again into Plantigrades and Sub-plantigrades.

ARCTOIDEA.

PLANTIGRADA.

URSIDAE.

The bears differ from the dogs and cats widely in form and manner, and diet. The cat has a
light springy action, treading on the tips of its toes, a well-knit body glistening in a silky
coat, often richly variegated, "a clean cut," rounded face, with beautifully chiselled nostrils
and thin lips, and lives exclusively on flesh. The bear shambles along with an awkward gait,
placing the entire sole of his foot on the ground; he has rough dingy fur, a snout like a pig's,
and is chiefly a vegetarian--and in respect to this last peculiarity his dentition is modified
considerably: the incisors are large, tri-cuspidate; the canines somewhat smaller than in the
restricted carnivora; these are followed by three small teeth, which usually fall out at an
early period, then comes a permanent premolar of considerable size, succeeded by two molars
in the upper, and three in the under jaw. In actual numbers this formula agrees with that for
the dogs; but the form of the teeth is very different, inasmuch as the large premolars and
the molars have flat tuberculated crowns, constituting them true grinders, instead of the trenchant
shape of the cats, which is also, to a modified extent, possessed by the dogs, of which the
last two molars have, instead of cutting edges, a grinding surface with four cusps. The trenchant
character is entirely lost in the bear, even in the carnivorous species which exhibit no material
difference in the teeth, any more than, as I mentioned at the commencement of this work, do
the teeth of the human race, be they as carnivorous as the Esquimaux, or vegetarian as the Hindu.

[Figure: Dentition of Bear.]

[Figure: Skull of Bear (under view).]

There is also another peculiarity in the bear's skull as compared with the cat's. In the latter
there is a considerable bulging below the aperture of the ear called the bulla tympani, or
bulb of the drum. This is almost wanting in the bear, and it would be interesting to know whether
this much affects its hearing. I myself am of opinion that bears are not acute in this sense,
but then my experience has been with the common Indian Ursus, or Melursus labiatus only, and
the skulls of this species in my possession strongly exhibit this peculiarity.[6] The cylindrical
bones resemble those of man nearer than any other animal, the femur especially; and a skinned
bear has a most absurd resemblance to a robust human being. The sole of the hind foot leaves
a mark not unlike that of a human print.

[Footnote 6: On referring to Mr. Sanderson's interesting book, 'Thirteen Years among the Wild
Beasts of India,' and General Shakespear's 'Wild Sports,' I find that both those authors corroborate
my assertion that the sloth bear is deficient in the sense of hearing. Captain Baldwin, however,
thinks otherwise; but the evidence seems to be against him in this respect.]

The Brown Bear of Europe (Ursus arctos) is the type of the family, and has been known from
the earliest ages--I may say safely prehistoric ages, for its bones have been frequently found
in post-pliocene formations along with those of other animals of which some are extinct. An
extinct species of bear, Ursus spelaeus, commonly called the Cave Bear, seems to have been
the ancestor of the Brown Bear which still is found in various parts of Europe, and is said
to have been found within historic times in Great Britain.

The bear of which we have the oldest record is almost the same as our Indian Brown or Snow
Bear. Our bear (U. Isabellinus) is but a variety of U. Syriacus, which was the one slain by
David, and is spoken of in various parts of the Bible. It is the nearest approach we have to
the European U. arctos.

NO. 163. URSUS ISABELLINUS. The Himalayan Brown Bear (Jerdon's No. 89).

NATIVE NAME.--Barf-ka-rich or Bhalu, Hind.; Harput, Kashmiri; Drin-mor, Ladakhi.

[Figure: URSUS ISABELLINUS.]

DESCRIPTION.--A yellowish-brown colour, varying somewhat according to sex and time of year.
Jerdon says: "In winter and spring the fur is long and shaggy, in some inclining to silvery
grey, in others to reddish brown; the hair is thinner and darker in summer as the season advances,
and in autumn the under fur has mostly disappeared, and a white collar on the chest is then
very apparent. The cubs show this collar distinctly. The females are said to be lighter in
colour than the males."

Gray does not agree in the theory that Ursus Syriacus is the same as this species; in external
appearance he says it is the same, but there are differences in the skull; the nose is broader,
and the depression in the forehead less. The zygomatic arch is wider and stronger; the lower
jaw stronger and higher, and the upper tubercular grinders shorter and thicker than in Ursus
Isabellinus.

"It is found," Jerdon says, "only on the Himalayas and at great elevations in summer close
to the snow. In autumn they descend lower, coming into the forests to feed on various fruits,
seeds, acorns, hips of rose-bushes, &c., and often coming close to villages to plunder apples,
walnuts, apricots, buckwheat, &c. Their usual food in spring and summer is grass and roots.
They also feed on various insects, and are seen turning over stones to look for scorpions (it
is said) and insects that harbour in such places. In winter they retreat to caves, remaining
in a state of semi-torpidity, issuing forth in March and April. Occasionally they are said
to kill sheep or goats, often wantonly, apparently, as they do not feed upon them. They litter
in April and May, the female having generally two cubs. This bear does not climb trees well."

       *       *       *       *       *

The next three species belong to the group of Sun Bears; Helarctos of some authors.

NO. 164. URSUS (HELARCTOS) TORQUATUS vel TIBETANUS. The Himalayan Black Bear (Jerdon's No. 90).

NATIVE NAME.--Bhalu, Hind.; Thom, Bhot.; Sona, Lepcha.

HABITAT.--The Himalayas, Nepal, Assam, Eastern Siberia, and China.

[Figure: URSUS TIBETANUS.]

DESCRIPTION.--Entirely black, with the exception of a broad white V-shaped mark on the chest
and a white chin. Neck thick, head flattened; ears large; claws very long and curved; fur short;
body and head more slender than the preceding species.

Jerdon remarks that the specific name of this bear is unfortunate, since it is rare in Thibet.
However the more appropriate specific name torquatus is now more generally adopted. It seems
to be common in all the Himalayan ranges, where it is to be found from 5000 to 12,000 feet.
Jerdon says it lives chiefly on fruit and roots, apricots, walnuts, apples, currants, &c.,
and also on various grains, barley, Indian corn, buckwheat, &c., and in winter on acorns, climbing
the oak trees and breaking down the branches. They are not afraid of venturing near villages,
and destroy not only garden stuff, but--being, like all bears, fond of honey--pull down the
hives attached to the cottages of the hill people. "Now and then they will kill sheep, goats,
&c., and are said occasionally to eat flesh. This bear has bad eyesight, but great power of
smell, and if approached from windward is sure to take alarm. A wounded bear will sometimes
show fight, but in general it tries to escape. It is said sometimes to coil itself into the
form of a ball, and thus roll down steep hills if frightened or wounded." If cornered it attacks
savagely, as all bears will, and the face generally suffers, according to Jerdon; but I have
noticed this with the common Indian Sloth Bear, several of the men wounded in my district had
their scalps torn. He says: "It has been noticed that if caught in a noose or snare, if they
cannot break it by force they never have the intelligence to bite the rope in two, but remain
till they die or are killed." In captivity this bear, if taken young, is very quiet, but is
not so docile as the Malayan species.[7]

[Footnote 7: Since writing the above, the following letter appeared in The Asian of May 11, 1880:--

"THE HIMALAYAN BLACK BEAR.

"SIR,--Mr. Sterndale, in the course of his interesting papers on the Mammalia of British India,
remarks of Ursus Tibetanus, commonly known as the Himalayan Black Bear, that 'a wounded one
will sometimes show fight, but in general it tries to escape.' This description is not, I think,
quite correct. As it would lead one to suppose that this bear is not more savage than any other
wild animal--the nature of most of the ferae being to try to escape when wounded, unless they
see the hunter who has fired at them, when many will charge at once, and desperately. The Himalayan
Black Bear will not only do this almost invariably, but often attacks men without any provocation
whatever, and is altogether about the most fierce, vicious, dangerous brute to be met with
either in the hills or plains of India. They inflict the most horrible wounds, chiefly with
their paws, and generally--as Mr. Sterndale states--on the face and head. I have repeatedly
met natives in the interior frightfully mutilated by encounters with the Black Bear, and cases
in which Europeans have been killed by them are by no means uncommon. These brutes are totally
different in their dispositions to the Brown Bear (Ursus Isabellinus), which, however desperately
wounded, will never charge. I believe there is no case on record of a hunter being charged
by a Brown Bear; or even of natives, under any circumstances, being attacked by one; whereas
every one of your readers who has ever marched in the Himalayas must have come across many
victims of the ferocity of Ursus Tibetanus. As I said before, this brute often, unwounded,
attacks man without any provocation whatever. Two cases that I know of myself may not be without
interest. An officer shooting near my camp was stalking some thar. He was getting close to
them, when a Black Bear rushed out at him from behind a large rock on his right and above him.
He was so intent on the thar, and the brute's rush was so sudden, that he had barely time to
pull from the hip, but he was fortunate enough to kill the animal almost at his feet. I heard
this from him on the morning after it happened. On another occasion, I was shooting in Chumba
with a friend. One evening he encamped at a village, about which there was, as usual, a little
cultivation on terraces, and a good many apricot-trees. Lower down the khud there was dense
jungle. The villagers told us that a Black Bear had lately been regularly visiting these trees,
and generally came out about dusk, so that if we would go down and wait, we should be pretty
sure of a shot. We went, and took up positions behind trees, about 200 yards apart, each of
us having a man from the village with us. Intervening jungle prevented us from seeing each
other. I had not been at my post more than ten minutes when I was startled by loud shrieks
and cries from the direction of my companion. No shot was fired, and the coolie with me said
that the bear had killed some one. In less than a minute I had reached the spot where I had
left my friend. He, and the man with him, had disappeared; but, guided by the shrieks, which
still continued, I made my way into the thick cover in front of his post, and about fifty yards
inside it, much to my relief, came upon him, rifle in hand, standing over the dead body of
a man, over which two people--the coolie that had been with my friend and an old woman--were
weeping, and shrieking loudly, 'Look out!' said he, as I came up, 'the bear has just killed
this fellow!' The first thing to be done was to carry him out into the open. I helped to do
this, and directly I touched him I felt that he was stone cold, and a further examination showed
he must have been dead some hours. That he had been killed by a bear was also very evident.
He was naked to the waist, and had been cutting grass. His bundle lay by him, and the long
curved kind of sickle that the hillmen used to cut grass with was stuck in his girdle, showing
that he had not had time to draw it to strike one blow in his defence. The mark of the bear's
paw on his left side was quite distinct. This had felled him to the ground, and then the savage
brute had given him one bite--no more, but that one had demolished almost the whole of the
back of his head, and death must have been instantaneous. The man had apparently cut his load
of grass, and was returning with it to the village, when he disturbed the bear, which attacked
him at once. The old woman was his mother, and the coolie with J---- some relation. Her son
having been away all day, I suppose the old woman had gone to look for him. She found his body,
as described, just below J----'s post, and at once set up a lamentation which brought the coolie,
J----'s attendant, down to her, and J---- following himself, thought at first that the man
had been killed then and there. There was such a row kicked up that no bear came near the apricots
that night, and the next day we had to march, as our leave was up. I have heard of many other
cases of the Black Bear attacking without any provocation, and from what I know of the brute
I quite believe them; and, after all, the animal is not worth shooting. Their skins are always
poor and mangy, and generally so greasy that they are very difficult to keep until you can
make them over to the dresser. The skin of the Snow or Brown Bear, on the other hand, particularly
if shot early in the season, is a splendid trophy, and forms a most beautiful and luxurious
rug, the fur being extremely soft, and several inches in depth.

"SPINDRIFT."]

In The Asian of January 7th, 1879, page 68, a correspondent ("N. F. T. T.") writes that he
obtained a specimen of this bear which was coal black throughout, with the exception of a dark
dirty yellow on the lower lip, but of the usual crescentic white mark she had not a trace.
This exceptional specimen was shot in Kumaon. Robinson, in his 'Account of Assam,' states that
these bears are numerous there, and in some places accidents caused by them are not unfrequent.

All the Sun Bears are distinguished for their eccentric antics, conspicuous among which is
the gift of walking about on their hind legs in a singularly human fashion. Those in the London
Zoological Gardens invariably attract a crowd. They struggle together in a playful way, standing
on their hind legs to wrestle. They fall and roll, and bite and hug most absurdly.

Captain J. H. Baldwin, in his 'Large and Small Game of Bengal,' puts this bear down as not
only carnivorous, but a foul feeder. He says: "On my first visit to the hills I very soon learnt
that this bear was a flesh-eater, so far as regards a sheep, goats, &c., but I could hardly
believe that he would make a repast on such abominations (i.e. carrion), though the paharies
repeatedly informed me that such was the case. One day, however, I saw a bear busy making a
meal off a bullock that had died of disease, and had been thrown into the bed of a stream."
In another page Captain Baldwin states that the Himalayan Bear is a good swimmer; he noticed
one crossing the River Pindur in the flood, when, as he remarks, "no human being, however strong
a swimmer, could have stemmed such a roaring rapid."

NO. 165. URSUS (HELARCTOS) GEDROSIANUS. Baluchistan Bear.

NATIVE NAME.--Mamh.

HABITAT.--Baluchistan.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur ranging from brown to brownish-black, otherwise as in last species.

This is a new species, brought to notice by Mr. W. T. Blanford, and named by him. The skull
of the first specimen procured was scarcely distinguishable from that of a female of Ursus
torquatus, and he was for a time apparently in doubt as to the distinctness of the species,
taking the brown skin as merely a variety; but a subsequently received skull of an adult male
seems to prove that it is a much smaller animal.

NO. 166. URSUS (HELARCTOS) MALAYANUS. The Bruang or Malayan Sun Bear.

NATIVE NAME.--Wet-woon, Arracan.

HABITAT.--Burmah, Malay Peninsula and adjacent islands.

[Figure: Ursus Malayanus.]

DESCRIPTION.--Smaller than U. torquatus, not exceeding four and a half feet in length. Fur
black, brownish on the nose; the chest marked with a white crescent, or, in the Bornean variety,
an orange-coloured heart-shaped patch; the claws are remarkably long; mouth and lower jaw dirty
white; the lower part of the crescent prolonged in a narrow white streak down to the belly,
where it is widened out into a large irregular spot. Marsden, in his 'History of Sumatra,'
published towards the end of the last century, speaks of this bear under the name of Bruang
(query: is our Bruin derived from this?), and mentions its habit of climbing the cocoa-nut
trees to devour the tender part, or cabbage.

It is more tamable and docile than the Himalayan Sun Bear, and is even more eccentric in its
ways. The one in the London "Zoo," when given a biscuit, lies down on its back, and passes
it about from fore to hind paws, eyeing it affectionately, and making most comical noises as
it rolls about. Sir Stamford Raffles writes of one which was in his possession for two years:--"He
was brought up in the nursery with the children; and when admitted to my table, as was frequently
the case, gave a proof of his taste by refusing to eat any fruit but mangosteens, or to drink
any wine but champagne. The only time I ever knew him out of humour was on an occasion when
no champagne was forthcoming. He was naturally of a playful and affectionate disposition, and
it was never found necessary to chain or chastise him. It was usual for this bear, the cat,
the dog, and a small blue mountain bird, or lory, of New Holland, to mess together and eat
out of the same dish. His favourite playfellow was the dog, whose teasing and worrying was
always borne, and returned with the utmost good humour and playfulness. As he grew up he became
a very powerful animal, and in his rambles in the garden he would lay hold of the largest plantains,
the stems of which he could scarcely embrace, and tear them up by the roots." The late General
A. C. McMaster gives an equally amusing account of his pet of this species which was obtained
in Burmah. "Ada," he writes, "is never out of temper, and always ready to play with any one.
While she was with me, 'Ada' would not eat meat in any shape; but I was told by one of the
ship's officers that another of the same species, 'Ethel' (also presented by me to the Committee
of the People's Park of Madras, and by them sent to England), while coming over from Burmah
killed and devoured a large fowl put into her cage. I do not doubt the killing, for at that
time 'Ethel' had not long been caught, and was a little demon in temper, but I suspect that,
while attention was taken off, some knowing lascar secured the body of the chicken, and gave
her credit for having swallowed it. 'Ada's' greatest delight was in getting up small trees;
even when she was a chubby infant I could, by merely striking the bark, or a branch some feet
above her head, cause her to scramble up almost any tree. At this time poor 'Ada,' a Burman
otter, and a large white poodle were, like many human beings of different tastes or pursuits,
very fast friends." In another part he mentions having heard of a bear of this species who
delighted in cherry brandy, "and on one occasion, having been indulged with an entire bottle
of this insinuating beverage, got so completely intoxicated that it stole a bottle of blacking,
and drank off the contents under the impression that they were some more of its favourite liquor.
The owner of the bear told me that he saw it suffering from this strange mixture, and evidently
with, as may easily be imagined, a terrible headache."

So much for the amusing side of the picture, now for the other.

Although strictly frugivorous, still it has been known to attack and devour man in cases of
the greatest want, and it also occasionally devours small animals and birds, in the pursuit
of which, according to Dr. Sal Muller, it prefers those that live on a vegetable diet. The
Rev. Mr. Mason, in his writings about Burmah, says "they will occasionally attack man when
alone;" he instances a bear upsetting two men on a raft, and he goes on to add that "last year
a Karen of my acquaintance in Tonghoo was attacked by one, overcome, and left by the bear for
dead." In this case there was no attempt to devour, and it may have been, as I have often observed
with the Indian Sloth Bear, that such attacks are made by females with young.

Dr. Sal Muller states: "in his native forests this bear displays much zeal and ingenuity in
discovering the nests of bees, and in extracting their contents by means of his teeth from
the narrow orifices of the branches of the trees in which they are concealed."

The next species constitutes the genus Melursus of Meyer or Prochilus of Illiger. It is an
awkward-shaped beast, from which it probably derives its name of "Sloth Bear," for it is not
like the sloth in other respects. It has long shaggy hair, large curved claws (which is certainly
another point of resemblance to the sloth), and a very much elongated mobile snout. Another
peculiarity is in its dentition; instead of six incisors in the upper jaw it has only four.

Blyth, in his later writings, adopts Illiger's generic name Prochilus.

NO. 167. URSUS (MELURSUS) LABIATUS. The Common Indian Sloth Bear.

NATIVE NAMES.--Bhalu, Hind.; Reench, Hind.; Riksha, Sanscrit; Aswail, Mahr.; Elugu, Tel.; Kaddi
or Karadi, Can.; Yerid or Asol of the Gonds; Banna of the Coles.

HABITAT.--All over the peninsula of India. Blyth says it is not found in Burmah.

[Figure: Ursus labiatus.]

DESCRIPTION.--General shape of the ursine type, but more than usually ungainly and awkward.
Hair very long and shaggy, all black, with the exception of a white V-shaped mark on the chest,
and dirty whitish muzzle and tips to its feet; snout prolonged and flexible; claws very large.

SIZE.--A large animal of this species will measure from five to six feet in length, and stand
nearly three feet high, weighing from fifteen to twenty stones.

Our old friend is so well known that he hardly requires description, and the very thought of
him brings back many a ludicrous and exciting scene of one's jungle days. There is frequently
an element of comicality in most bear-hunts, as well as a considerable spice of danger; for,
though some people may pooh-pooh this, I know that a she-bear with cubs is no despicable antagonist.
Otherwise the male is more anxious to get away than to provoke an attack.

This bear does not hibernate at all, but is active all the year round. In the hot weather it
lies all day in cool caves, emerging only at night. In March and April, when the mohwa-tree
is in flower, it revels in the luscious petals that fall from the trees, even ascending the
branches to shake down the coveted blossoms. The mohwa (Bassia latifolia) well merits a slight
digression from our subject. It is a large-sized umbrageous tree, with oblong leaves from four
to eight inches long, and two to four inches broad. The flowers are globular, cream coloured,
with a faint greenish tint, waxy in appearance, succulent and extremely sweet, but to my taste
extremely nasty, there being a peculiar disagreeable flavour which lingers long in the mouth.
However not only do all animals, carnivorous as well as herbivorous, like them, but they are
highly appreciated by the natives, who not only eat them raw, but dry them in the sun and thus
keep them for future consumption, and also distil an extremely intoxicating spirit from them.
The fresh refuse, or marc, after the extraction of the spirit is also attractive to animals.
Some years ago I sent to Mr. Frank Buckland, for publication in Land and Water, an account
of a dog which used to frequent a distillery for the purpose of indulging in this refuse, the
result of which was his becoming completely intoxicated. This marc, after further fermentation,
becomes intensely acid, and on one occasion I used it successfully in cleaning and brightening
a massive steel and iron gate which I had constructed. I made a large vat, and filling it with
this fermented refuse, put the gate in to pickle. The seeds of the mohwa yield an oil much
prized by the natives, and used occasionally for adulterating ghee. The wood is not much used;
it is not of sufficient value to compensate for the flower and fruit, consequently the tree
is seldom cut down. When an old one falls the trunk and large limbs are sometimes used for
sluices in tanks, for the heart wood is generally rotten and hollow, and it stands well under
water. If you ask a Gond about the mohwa he will tell you it is his father and mother. His
fleshly father and mother die and disappear, but the mohwa is with him for ever! A good mohwa
crop is therefore always anxiously looked for, and the possession of trees coveted; in fact
a large number of these trees is an important item for consideration in the assessment of land
revenues. No wonder then that the villager looks with disfavour on the prowling bear who nightly
gathers up the fallen harvest, or who shakes down the long-prayed-for crop from the laden boughs.

The Sloth Bear is also partial to mangos, sugar-cane, and the pods of the amaltas or cassia(Cathartocarpus
fistula), and the fruit of the jack-tree (Artocarpus integrifolia).

It is extremely fond of honey, and never passes an ant-hill without digging up its contents,
especially those of white ants. About twenty years ago my first experience of this was in a
neighbour's garden. He had recently built himself a house, and was laying out and sowing his
flower-beds with great care. It so happened that one of the beds lay over a large ants' nest,
and to his dismay he found one morning a huge pit dug in the centre of it, to the total destruction
of all his tender annuals, by a bear that had wandered through the station during the night.
Tickell describes the operation thus: "On arriving at an ant-hill the bear scrapes away with
the fore-feet till he reaches the large combs at the bottom of the galleries. He then with
violent puffs dissipates the dust and crumbled particles of the nest, and sucks out the inhabitants
of the comb by such forcible inhalations as to be heard at two hundred yards distant or more.
Large larvae are in this way sucked out from great depths under the soil."

Insects of all sorts seem not to come amiss to this animal, which systematically hunts for
them, turning over stones in the operation.

The Sloth Bear has usually two young ones at a birth. They are born blind, and continue so
till about the end of the third week. The mother is a most affectionate parent, defending her
offspring with the greatest ferocity. A she-bear with cubs is always an awkward customer, and
she continues her solicitude for them till they are nearly full grown. The young ones are not
difficult to rear if ordinary care be taken. The great mistake that most people make in feeding
the young of wild animals is the giving of pure cows' milk. I mentioned this in 'Seonee' in
speaking of a bear:--

"The little brute was as savage as his elders, and would do nothing but walk to the end of
the string by which he was attached to a tent peg, roll head over heels, and walk in a contrary
direction, when a similar somersault would be performed; and he whined and wailed just like
a child; one might have mistaken it for the puling of some villager's brat. Milford was going
to give it pure cows' milk when Fordham advised him not to do so, but to mix it with one half
the quantity of water. 'The great mistake people make,' he said, 'who try to rear wild animals,
is to give them what they think is best for them, viz., good fresh cows' milk, and they wonder
that the little creatures pine away and die, instead of flourishing on it. Cows' milk is too
rich; buffalos' milk is better, but both should be mixed with water. It does not matter what
the animal is: tiger-cub, fawn, or baby monkey--all require the same caution.'"

I had considerable experience in the bringing up of young things of all sorts when in the Seonee
district, and only after some time learnt the proper proportions of milk and water, and also
that regularity in feeding was necessary--two-thirds water to one of milk for the first month;
after that half and half.

The Sloth Bear carries her cubs on her back, as do the opossums, and a singular little animal
called the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)--and she seems to do this for some time, as Mr. Sanderson
writes he shot one which was carrying a cub as large as a sheep-dog.

In that most charming of all sporting books ever written, Campbell's 'Old Forest Ranger,' there
is an amusingly-told bit with reference to this habit of cub-carrying which I am sure my readers
will forgive me for extracting. Old Dr. Jock M'Phee had been knocked over by a she-bear, and
is relating his grievances to Charles:--

"Well, as I was saying, I was sitting at my pass, and thinking o' my old sweethearts, and the
like o' that, when a' at ance I heard a terrible stramash among the bushes, and then a wild
growl, just at my very lug. Up I jumps wi' the fusee in my hand, and my heart in my mouth,
and out came a muckle brute o' a bear, wi' that wee towsie tyke sitting on her back, as conciety
as you please, and haudin' the grip like grim death wi' his claws. The auld bear, as soon as
she seed me, she up wi' her birse, and shows her muckle white teeth, and grins at me like a
perfect cannibal; and the wee deevil he sets up his birse too, and snaps his bit teeth, and
tries to grin like the mither o't, with a queer auld farrant look that amaist gart me laugh;
although, to tell the blessed truth, Maister Charles, I thought it nae laughing sport. Well,
there was naething else for it, so I lets drive at them wi' the grit-shot, thinking to ding
them baith at ance. I killed the sma' ane dead enough; but the auld one, she lets a roar that
amaist deeved me, and at me she comes like a tiger. I was that frighted, sir, I did na ken
what to do; but in despair I just held out the muzzle o' the fusee to fend her off, and I believe
that saved my life, for she gripped it atween her teeth, dang me o'er the braid o' my back,
and off she set, trailing me through the bushes like a tether-stick; for some way or other
I never let go the grip I had o' the stock. I was that stupefied I hae nae recollection what
happened after this, till I found mysel' sticking in the middle o' a brier-bush, wi' my breeks
rived the way you see, and poor old 'Meg' smashed in bits--de'el be in her skin that did it."

Poor old Jock M'Phee! On the whole he did well to escape with but injury to his garments. I
have seen several men mauled by she-bears; one of them was scalped and torn to such an extent
that it was a long time before he recovered; and I always marvelled to think he got over it at all.

The British soldier is rather fond of a bear cub as a pet; and Captain Baldwin tells an amusing
story of one which followed the men on to the parade ground, and quite disorganised the manoeuvres
by frightening the colonel's horse. In 1858 I was quartered for a time with a naval brigade;
and once, when there was an alarm of the enemy, Jack went to the front with all his pets, including
Bruin, which brought up the rear, shuffling along in blissful ignorance of the bubble reputation
to be found at the cannon's mouth.

Although as a rule vegetarian, yet this species is not altogether free from the imputation
of being a devourer of flesh when it comes in its way. In such cases it possibly has been impelled
by hunger, and I doubt whether it ever kills for the sake of eating. I have known even ruminants
eat meat, and in their case hunger could not have been urged as an excuse. Mr. Sanderson mentions
an instance when a Barking Deer he shot was partially devoured by a bear during the night.

Very few elephants, however steady with tigers, will stand a bear. Whether it is that bears
make such a row when wounded, or whether there be anything in the smell, I know not, but I
have heard many sportsmen allude to the fact. A favourite elephant I had would stand anything
but a bear and a pig. Few horses will approach a bear, and this is one difficulty in spearing
them; and for this reason I think bear dancers should be prohibited in towns. Calcutta used
to swarm with them at one time. It always makes me angry when I see these men going about with
the poor brutes, whose teeth and claws are often drawn, and a cruel ring passed through their
sensitive nostrils. I should like to set an old she-bear after the bhalu-wallas, with a fair
field and no favour.

The bear rising to hug its adversary is a fallacy as far as this species is concerned; it does
not squeeze, but uses its claws freely and with great effect.

       *       *       *       *       *

I think we have now exhausted our Indian bears. Some have spoken of a dwarf bear supposed to
inhabit the Lower Himalayas, but as yet it is unknown--possibly it may be the Ailuropus. We
now come to the Bear-like animals, the next in order, being the Racoons (Procyon), Coatis (Nasua),
Kinkajous (Cercoleptes), and the Cacomixle (Bassaris) of North and South America, and then
our own Panda or Cat-Bear (Ailurus fulgens).

This, with the above-mentioned Racoons, &c., forms a small group of curious bear-like animals,
mostly of small size. Externally they differ considerably, especially in their long bushy tails,
but in all essential particulars they coincide. They are plantigrade, and are without a caecum
or blind gut; the skull, however it may approach to a viverrine or feline shape, has still
marked arctoid characteristics. The ear passage is well marked and bony, as in that of the
bear, but the bulb of the drum (bulla tympani) is much developed, as in the dogs and cats.
The molars are more tuberculated than in the bears, resembling the hinder molars of a dog.

AILURIDAE.

F. Cuvier, who received the first specimen of the type of this family from his son-in-law,
M. Duvaucel, was not happy in his selection of a name, which would lead one to suppose that
it was affixed to the cats instead of the bears. It certainly in some degree resembles the
cat externally, and it has also semi-retractile claws, but in greater measure it belongs to
the Arctoidea. There are only two genera as yet known--the Red Cat-Bear, Ailurus fulgens, and
the Thibetan Ailuropus melanoleucos.

GENUS AILUROPUS.

This very rare and most curious animal should properly come between the bears and Ailurus,
as it seems to form a link between the two. Such also is the idea of a naturalist friend of
mine, who, in writing to me about it, expressed it as being a link between Helarctos Malayanus
and Ailurus fulgens. Very little is, however, known of the creature, which inhabits the most
inaccessible portions of a little-known country--the province of Moupin in Eastern Thibet.
It was procured there by the Abbe David, who, after a prolonged residence in China, lived for
nearly a year in Moupin, and he sent specimens of the skull, skin, &c., to M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards,
from whose elaborate description in his 'Recherches sur les Mammiferes' I have extracted the
following notice. The original article is too long to translate in extenso, but I have taken
the chief points.

NO. 168. AILUROPUS MELANOLEUCOS.

HABITAT.--The hilly parts Moupin, Eastern Thibet.

[Figure: Ailuropus melanoleucos.]

DESCRIPTION.--The Ailuropus has a thick-set heavy form. His head is short, rather slender in
front, but extremely enlarged in the middle and after part; the nose is small and naked at
its extremity; the forehead very large and convex; the eyes are small; the ears short, wide
between and rounded at the ends; neck thick and very strong; the body is squat and massive;
the tail is so short as to be hardly distinguishable. The feet are short, very large, nearly
of the same length, terminated by five toes very large and with rounded ends, the general conformation
of which recalls in all respects those of the bears, but of which the lower parts, instead
of being completely placed on the sole in walking and entirely naked or devoid of hair, are
always in great measure raised, and abundantly clad with fur to almost their full extent.

On the hind feet can be noticed at the base of the toes a transverse range of five little fleshy
pads, and towards the anterior extremity of the metatarsal region another naked cushion placed
transversely; but between these parts, as well as the posterior two-thirds of the planta, the
hair is as abundant and as long almost as on the upper part of the foot. In the fore-limbs
the disposition is much the same, though the metacarpal cushion may be larger; and there is
another fleshy pad without hair near the claws.

The Ailuropus is thus an animal not strictly plantigrade, like the Bears in general, or the
same as the Polar Bear, of which the feet, although placed flat on the earth, are not devoid
of hair; but, on the contrary, the Ailuropus resembles the Ailurus, which is semi-plantigrade,
yet hairy under Its soles.

The colouring of the Ailuropus is remarkable: it is white with the exception of the circumferences
of the eyes, the ears, the shoulders, and the lower part of the neck which are entirely black.
These stand out clearly on a groundwork of slightly yellowish-white; the spots round the eyes
are circular, and give a strange aspect to the animal; those on the shoulders represent a sort
of band placed transversely across the withers, widening as they descend downwards to lower
limbs. The hinder limbs are also black from the lower part of the thigh down to the toes, but
the haunches, as also the greater part of the tail, are as white as the back and belly; the
colouring is the same in young and old. The fur is long, thick, and coarse, like that of the bears.

From the general form of the skull it would seem impossible to determine the family to which
this animal belongs. In effect the head differs considerably from the Ursidae and the Mustelidae,
and presents certain resemblances to that of the hyaena; but there are numerous and important
particulars which indicate a special zoological type, and it is only by an inspection of the
dental system that the natural affinities of the Ailuropus can be determined.

In the upper jaw the incisors are, as usual, in three pairs. They are remarkable for their
oblique direction; the centre ones are small and a little widened at the base; the second pair
are stronger and dilated towards the cutting edge; the external incisors are also strong and
excavated outside to admit the canines of the lower jaw. The canines are stout, but short,
with a well-marked blunt ridge down the posterior side, as in the Malayan bears.

The molars are six in number on each side, of which four are premolars, and two true molars.
The first premolar, situated behind, a little within the line of the canine, is very small,
tuberculiform, and a little compressed laterally. The second is strong and essentially carnassial;
it is compressed laterally and obliquely placed. It is furnished with three lobes: the first
lobe is short, thick, and obtuse; the second is raised, triangular and with cutting edges;
the third of the size of the first, but more compressed--in short, a double-fanged tooth. This
molar differs considerably from the corresponding tooth of the bear by its form and relative
development, since in that family it is one-fanged, very low and obtuse. On the contrary, it
approaches to that of the hyaenas and felines. With the panda (Ailurus fulgens) the corresponding
premolar is equally large, double-fanged and trenchant, but the division in lobes is not so marked.

The third or penultimate molar of the Ailuropus is larger and thicker than the preceding, divided
in five distinct lobes--three outer ones in a line, and two less projecting ones within.

The last premolar is remarkably large; it is much larger behind than in front, and its crown
is divided into six lobes, of which five are very strong; the three external ones are much
developed and trenchant, the centre one being the highest and of a triangular shape. Of the
internal lobes, the first one is almost as large as the external ones; the second is very small,
almost hidden in the groove between the last mentioned; and the third, which is very large,
rounded and placed obliquely inwards in front, and outwards behind. Professor Milne-Edwards
remarks that he knows not amongst the carnivora a similar example of a tooth so disposed. That
of Ailurus shows the least difference, that is to say it is nearest in structure, having also
six lobes, but more thick-set or depressed.

The true molars are remarkable for their enormous development: the first is almost square,
with blunt rounded cusps, four-fanged, and presenting a strange mixture of characteristics,
in its outward portion resembling an essentially carnivorous type, and its internal portion
that of molars intended to triturate vegetable substances. Amongst bears, and especially the
Malayan bears, this character is presented, but in a less striking degree; the panda resembles
it more, with certain restrictions, but the most striking analogy is with the genus Hyaenarctos.

The last molar is peculiar in shape, longer than broad, and is tuberculous, as in the bears,
but it differs in this respect from the pandas, in which the last molar is almost a repetition
of the preceding one, and its longitudinal diameter is less than its transverse.

In the lower jaw the first premolar, instead of being small and tuberculate, as its corresponding
tooth in the upper jaw, is large, double-fanged, trenchant and tri-lobed, resembling, except
for size, the two following ones. The second is not inserted obliquely like its correspondent
in the upper jaw, its axis is in a line with that of its neighbours; tricuspidate, the middle
lobe being the highest. The third premolar is very large, and agrees with its upper one, excepting
the lobule on the inner border.

The first true molar is longer than broad, and wider in front; the crown, with five conical
tubercles in two groups, separated by a transverse groove; the next molar is thicker and stouter
than the preceding one, and the last is smaller, and both much resemble those of the bears,
and differ notably from the pandas.

From what M. Milne-Edwards describes, we may briefly epitomise that the premolarial dentition
of the Ailuropus is ailuroid or feline, and that the true molars are arctoid or ursine.

The skull is remarkable for the elongation of the cranium and the elevation of the occipital
crest, for the shortness of the muzzle, for the depression of the post-frontal portion, and
for the enormous development of the zygomatic arches. In another part M. Milne-Edwards remarks
that there is no carnivorous animal of which the zygomatic arches are so developed as in the
Ailuropus. He states that it inhabits the most inaccessible mountains of Eastern Thibet, and
it never descends from its retreats to ravage the fields, as do the Black Bears; therefore
it is difficult to obtain. It lives principally on roots, bamboos and other vegetables; but
we may reasonably suppose from its conformation that it is carnivorous at times, when opportunity
offers, as are some of the bears, and as is the Ailurus. I have dwelt at some length on this
animal, though not a denizen of India proper; but it will be a prize to any of our border sportsmen
who come across it on the confines of Thibet, and therefore I have deemed it worthy of space.

SIZE.--From muzzle to tail, about four feet ten inches; height about twenty-six inches.

NATIVE NAMES.--Wah, Nepal; Wah-donka, Bhot.; Sunnam or Suknam, Lepch.; Negalya, Ponya of the
Nepalese (Jerdon). In the Zoological Gardens in London it is called the Panda, but I am unable
just now to state the derivation of this name.

HABITAT.--Eastern Himalayas and Eastern Thibet.

[Figure: Ailurus fulgens.]

DESCRIPTION.--"Skull ovate; forehead arched; nose short; brain case ovate, ventricose; the
zygomatic arches very large, expanded; crown bent down behind" (Gray). The lower jaw is very
massive, and the ascending ramus unusually large, extending far above the zygomatic arch, forming
almost a right angle with equal arms. Hodgson's description is: "Ursine arm; feline paw; profoundly
cross-hinged, yet grinding jaw, and purely triturative and almost ruminant molar of Ailurus;
tongue smooth; pupil round; feet enveloped in woolly socks with leporine completeness. It walks
like the marten; climbs and fights with all the four legs at once, like the Paradoxuri, and
does not employ its forefeet--like the racoon, coatis, or bears--in eating."

Jerdon's outward description is: "Above deep ochreous-red; head and tail paler and somewhat
fulvous, displayed on the tail in rings; face, chin, and ears within white; ears externally,
all the lower surface and the entire limbs and tip of tail jet-black; from the eye to the gape
a broad vertical line of ochreous-red blending with the dark lower surface; moustache white;
muzzle black."

The one at present in the London "Zoo" is thus described: "Rich red-chestnut in colour on the
upper surface, jet black as to the lower surface, the limbs also black, the snout and inside
of ears white; the tail bushy, reddish-brown in colour and indistinctly ringed."

SIZE.--Head and body 22 inches; tail 16; height about 9; weight about 8 lbs.

Jerdon has epitomised Hodgson's description of the habits of this animal as follows: "The Wah
is a vegetivorous climber, breeding and feeding chiefly on the ground, and having its retreat
in holes and clefts of rock. It eats fruits, roots, sprouts of bamboo, acorns, &c.; also, it
is said, eggs and young birds; also milk and ghee, which it is said to purloin occasionally
from the villages. They feed morning and evening, and sleep much in the day. They are excellent
climbers, but on the ground move rather awkwardly and slowly. Their senses all appear somewhat
blunt, and they are easily captured. In captivity they are placid and inoffensive, docile and
silent, and shortly after being taken may be suffered to go abroad. They prefer rice and milk
to all other food, refusing animal food, and they are free from all offensive odour. They drink
by lapping with the tongue, spit like cats when angered, and now and then utter a short deep
grunt like a young bear. The female brings forth two young in spring. They usually sleep on
the side, and rolled into a ball, the head concealed by the bushy tail." (For the full account
see 'Jour. As. Soc. Beng.' vol. xvi. p. 1113.)

Mr. Bartlett, who has studied the habits of the specimen in the London Gardens, says that in
drinking it sucks up the fluids like a bear instead of licking it up like a dog or cat, which
disagrees with what Hodgson states above. "When offended it would rush at Mr. Bartlett, and
strike at him with both feet, the body being raised like a bear's, and the claws projecting."

General Hardwicke was the first to discover this animal, which he described in a paper read
before the Linnaean Society on the 6th of November 1821, but it was not published for some
years, and in the meanwhile M. Duvaucel sent one to M. F. Cuvier, who introduced it first to
the world. Some years ago I had a beautiful skin of one offered to me for sale at Darjeeling
by some Bhotias, but as it was redolent of musk and other abominations quite foreign to its
innocent inodorous self, I declined to give the high price wanted for it.

SEMI-PLANTIGRADES.

These form part of the Plantigrada of Cuvier and part of the Digitigrada; they walk on their
toes, but at the same time keep the wrist and heel much nearer to the ground than do the true
Digitigrades, and sometimes rest on them. Of those Semi-plantigrades with which we now have
to deal there are three sections, viz., the Mustelidae, containing the Gluttons, Martens, Weasels,
Ferrets, Grisons, &c., the Melidae, Melididae and Melinidae of various authors: i.e. Badgers,
Ratels, and Skunks; and the Lutridae or Otters. Some writers bring them all under one great
family, Mustelidae, but the above tripartite arrangement is, I think, better for ordinary purposes.
To the mind of only moderate scientific attainments, a distinct classification of well-defined
groups is always an easier matter than a large family split up into many genera defined by
internal anatomical peculiarities.

Of the Semi-plantigrades at large Jerdon remarks: "None of them have more than one true molar
above and another below, which, however, vary much in development, and the flesh tooth is most
marked in those in which the tuberculate is least developed, and vice versa. The great and
small intestines differ little in calibre, and many of them (i.e. the family) can diffuse at
will a disgusting stench." This last peculiarity is a specialty of the American members of
the family, notably the skunk, of the power of which almost incredible stories are told. I
remember reading not long ago an account of a train passing over a skunk, and for a time the
majority of the passengers suffered from nausea in consequence. Sir John Richardson writes:
"I have known a dead skunk thrown over the stockades of a trading port produce instant nausea
in several women in a house with closed doors, upwards of a hundred yards distant." The secretion
is intensely inflammatory if squirted in the eye.

MELIDIDAE; OR, BADGER-LIKE ANIMALS.

This group is distinguished by a heavier form, stouter limbs, coarse hair, and slower action;
in most the claws are adapted for burrowing. None of them are arboreal, although in olden times
marvellous tales were told of the wolverene or glutton as being in the habit of dropping down
from branches of trees on the backs of large animals, clinging on to them and draining their
life blood as they fled. Some of them are capable of emitting a noisome smell. The teledu of
Java (Mydaus meliceps) is the worst of the family in this respect, and almost equals the skunk.
It is possible that this animal may be found in Tenasserim.

GENUS ARCTONYX.

Dentition much the same as that of the Badger (Meles). The incisors are disposed in a regular
curve, vertical in the upper jaw, obliquely inclined in the lower; canines strong, grinders
compressed; general form of the badger, but stouter. Feet five-toed, with strong claws adapted
for digging, that of the index finger being larger than the other.

NO. 170. ARCTONYX COLLARIS. The Hog-Badger (Jerdon's No. 93).

NATIVE NAMES.--Balu-suar, Hind., Sand-pig, or, as Jerdon has it, Bhalu-soor, Hind., i.e. Bear-pig;
Khway-too-wet-too, Arakanese.

HABITAT.--Nepal, Sikim, Assam, Sylhet, Arakan, extending, as Dr. Anderson has observed, to
Western Yunnan. The late General A. C. McMaster found it in Shway Gheen On the Sitang river
in Pegu. I heard of it in the forests of Seonee in the Central Provinces, but I never came
across one.

[Figure: Arctonyx collaris.]

DESCRIPTION.--"Hair of the body rough, bristly, and straggling; that of the head shorter, and
more closely adpressed. Head, throat, and breast yellowish white; on the upper part this colour
forms a broad regularly-defined band from the snout to the occiput; ears of the same colour;
the nape of the neck, a narrow band across the breast, the anterior portion of the abdomen,
the extremities, a band arising from the middle of the upper lip, gradually wider posteriorly,
including the eyes and ears, and another somewhat narrower arising from the lower lip, passing
the cheek, uniting with the former on the neck, are deep blackish-brown" (Horsfield). The tail
is short, attenuated towards the end, and covered with rough hairs.

SIZE.--From snout to root of tail, 25 inches; tail, 7 inches; height at the rump, 12 inches.

M. Duvaucel states that "it passes the greatest part of the day in profound somnolence, but
becomes active at the approach of night; its gait is heavy, slow, and painful; it readily supports
itself erect on its hind feet, and prefers vegetables to flesh."

Jerdon alludes to all this, and adds, "one kept in captivity preferred fruit, plantains, &c.,
as food, and refused all kinds of meat. Another would eat meat, fish, and used to burrow and
grope under the walls of the bungalow for worms and shells." My idea is Balu-suar, or Sand-pig
is the correct name, although Bhalu-suar or Bear-pig may hit off the appearance of the animal
better, but its locality has always been pointed out to me by the Gonds in the sandy beds of
rivers in the bamboo forests of Seonee; and Horsfield also has it Baloo-soor, Sand-pig.

Bewick, who was the first to figure and describe it, got, as the vulgar phrase hath it, the
wrong pig by the lug, as he translates it Sand-bear. McMaster also speaks of those he saw as
being in deep ravines on the Sitang river.

The stomach of Arctonyx is simple; there is no caecum, as is the case also with the bears;
the liver has five lobes; under the tail it has glands, as in the Badgers, secreting a fatty
and odorous substance.

NO. 171. ARCTONYX TAXOIDES. The Assam Badger.

HABITAT.--Assam and Burmah.

DESCRIPTION.--Smaller than the last, with longer and finer fur, narrower muzzle, smaller ears,
shorter tail, and more distinct markings. The measurement of the respective skulls show a great
difference. The length of a skull of a female of this species given by Dr. Anderson is 4.75
inches against 6.38 of a female of A. collaris. The breadth across the zygomatic arch is 2.38
against 3.64 of A. collaris. The breadth of the palate between the molars is only 0.81 against
1.07.

GENUS MELES. SUB-GENUS TAXIDIA.

This sub-genus is that of the American type of Badger, to which Hodgson, who first described
the Thibetan T. leucurus, supposed his species to belong; but other recent naturalists, among
whom are Drs. Gray and Anderson, prefer to class it as Meles. Hodgson founded his classification
on the dentition of his specimen, but Blyth has thrown some doubt on its correctness, believing
that the skull obtained by Hodgson with the skin was that of Meles albogularis. Hodgson, however,
says: "from the English Badger type of restricted Meles our animal may be at once discriminated
without referring to skulls by its inferior size, greater length of tail, and partially-clad
planta or foot-sole."

NATIVE NAME.--Tampha.

HABITAT.--The plains of Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--"Fur long, flaccid, dark iron-grey and white mixed; hair long, white, with a
broad sub-lunate black band and a white tip; under fur abundant, long, white; a streak on each
side of the forehead blackish grey, varied; chin, throat, legs and under side of the body black;
tail, sides of head, and body whitish."--Gray.

The aspect, according to Hodgson, is entirely that of a long-tailed Badger (Gray remarks: "it
most resembles the European animal "), with somewhat smaller head, with longer, finer fur than
usual; the entire sole of the foot is not naked, but only about two-thirds, and the toe-pads
are very much developed, thus raising the powerful long fossorial claws from the ground in walking.

SIZE.--Total length 37 inches, of which the tail, with the hair, is 10 inches, and without
the hair 7 inches; the longest hair of the body is 4-1/2 inches.

There is not much known about the Tampha. According to what Hodgson was able to gather concerning
his habits, "he dwells in the more secluded spots of inhabited districts, makes a comfortable,
spacious and well-arranged subterraneous abode, dwells there in peace with his mate, who has
an annual brood of two to four young, molests not his neighbour, defends himself if compelled
to it with unconquerable resolution, and feeds on roots, nuts, insects and reptiles, but chiefly
the two former--on vegetables, not animals--a point of information confirmed by the prevalent
triturant character of the teeth." The colouring of this animal is almost identical with the
English badger, only that his tail is longer and whiter.

NO. 173. MELES ALBOGULARIS. The White-throated Thibetan Badger.

HABITAT.--Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Smaller and much less tufted ears than the last species; a shorter and much less
bushy tail; and the fur shorter and coarser, though of finer texture than in the European badger,
with much woolly hair at its base. Both the English badger and M. leucurus are black throated;
this one is white throated. The English animal has a broad band of brownish-black, which begins
between the muzzle and the eye, and runs through the eye and ear till it fades off on the neck;
the space of white between these two bands on the forehead runs back and contracts behind the
ears. In the Thibetan animal it contracts just behind the eyes, and is continued as a faint
narrow streak only as far as the ears. In the English one the cheeks are broadly white between
the eye-band and the black throat; in the Thibetan there is a little white below the eye, and
this is bordered by a narrow black stripe, beneath which is the white throat.

There is another Thibetan badger mentioned by Professor Milne-Edwards in his 'Recherches sur
les Mammiferes,' a white-throated one, M. obscurus, but it appears to be the same as M. albogularis.

GENUS MELLIVORA.

Tubercular grinder transverse; flesh-tooth larger, with a small internal lobe, and with a single
tubercle; lower flesh-tooth tricuspidate, sharp-edged; head depressed; nose blunt; ears not
visible externally; body stout, depressed; legs short, and strong; feet plantigrade, five-toed;
front claws elongated and strong; the bald sole of the hind foot occupying the whole under
surface, only slightly divided across about one-third of its length from the front; tail very
short, with powerfully offensive glands; it has a thick loose skin and a subcutaneous layer
of fat, which doubtless protect it from stings of bees, on which this genus is supposed to
feed whenever it can.

NO. 174. MELLIVORA INDICA. The Indian Ratel or Honey-Badger (Jerdon's No. 94).

NATIVE NAME.--Biju, Hind.; Biyu-khawar, Telegu; Tavakaradi, Tamil; Bajru-bhal, at Bhagulpore
(Santali?); Bharsiah, Nepalese.

HABITAT.--Throughout India.

[Figure: Mellivora Indica.]

DESCRIPTION.--The upper half of its body is ashy-grey; the lower half, muzzle, limbs, and tail
black; the general appearance is that of a black animal with a grey cloak on its back. The
only difference between the Indian and the Cape Ratel is, that the grey cloak of the latter
has a conspicuous white border which is wanting in the Indian species; the tail also of the
latter is shorter, otherwise they are the same, and were for a long time considered the same.

SIZE.--Head and body, 26 to 32 inches; tail, 5 to 6 inches.

Jerdon says it is chiefly found in hilly districts, and that he has not found it in Lower Bengal
nor on the Malabar coast. In Central India it is not uncommon. It has got a reputation for
digging into graves, and is called in some parts "the grave-digger;" but I do not believe in
its carnivorous propensities to this extent; it lives principally on small fry, insects, and
small animals, honey and vegetable food. Jerdon says it is destructive to poultry, which is
probable, for it will eat small birds. Both it and the Cape species will eagerly look out for
bees, but it is not to be supposed, as some books would make out, that bees and honey form
the staple diet. Its thick and loose skin, the stiffness of the hair above, and the layer of
fat below, effectually preserve it from the effects of the stings. The tail glands contain
a very strong and pungent secretion.

Some years ago, before I knew exactly what they were, the Ratels in the London Zoological Gardens
used to interest me greatly. They had a low cage, on the ground I think, and their peculiar
antics never failed to draw a crowd. They used to run round in an idiotic sort of way, and
always at one point gravely turn head over heels and then proceed as before and repeat. In
Cassell's 'Natural History' this is alluded to, only the writer says that now they are in fresh
quarters, and the flitting seems to have disturbed them. He adds: "We have often watched one
of them run round and round the cage in the usual purposeless manner of captive animals, but
with this peculiarity: when he reached a particular corner of the den, he quietly, and without
effort, turned head over heels, and then went on again. On one occasion, after he had been
doing this with great regularity for some rounds he seemed to become abstracted, and passed
the usual spot without the somersault; when, however, he had proceeded a few paces he recollected
himself, stopped for a moment, returned to the exact place, turned over as usual, and proceeded
without further let or hindrance." The African species is said to live largely on bees--I suppose
ground bees, such as our English humble bee, for these animals are not arboreal--and it is
said to exhibit great skill in tracking the flying insects to their nest. "Sparrman states
that it seats itself on a hillock to look for the bees, and shades its eyes with one forepaw
against the rays of the setting sun." Here is something for our Indian naturalists to observe.
Some other animals are said to do the same; whether the Biju does it or not I cannot say. McMaster
says of it: "Two that I saw in confinement appeared very good-tempered, and much more playful
than tame bears would have been. They were, I think, fed entirely upon vegetables, rice and
milk." This animal is the same as Hodgson's Ursitaxus inauritus, the Bharsiah which figures
as a separate genus in Cuvier. The skull is very like that of the wolverenes in general form.

GENUS GULO--THE GLUTTON OR WOLVERENE.

This animal was placed by Linnaeus among the Ursidae, and is classed by some with the Melididae,
but its dentition is more that of the Martens, which occupy the next group. The true Glutton
(Gulo luscus) is not known in India, but we have some so-called Wolverenes (Helictis) to which
I shall presently allude. Still a few remarks about the typical animal, which is by no means
an uninteresting creature, may not be out of place. The Glutton inhabits a wide tract of country
in the Northern Hemisphere, the colder regions of Europe, Asia, and America; it is abundant
in Siberia and Kamschatka, and is the pest of the trappers in North America. Fabulous stories
were told of this animal in olden days, some of which are still propagated at the present time.
It was supposed to be of insatiable appetite, and to attack its prey (deer, &c.) by dropping
down from the branch of a tree on to the back of its victim, and to eat its way into a vital
part, whilst being carried along--a decided fallacy, for neither the Glutton nor our Indian
species of Helictis are arboreal in their habits. Then it was accused of eating to such a pitch
of distention that it had to squeeze itself between two close-growing trees for relief ere
it returned again to the repast. There is no doubt, however, that it is to a great extent voracious
and extremely cunning; and what it cannot eat it will carry off and hide. The trappers complain
bitterly of it, and spare no pains to kill every one they can come across; but it is not easily
to be caught, and only a very cunningly-devised bait will succeed.

Were I to relate some of the stories recorded of this animal I might get accused, if not of
being a romancer myself, at all events of being a too credulous propagator of other people's
romances. It is told of it that it will discover hidden stores, and, digging them up out of
the snow, carefully smooth the surface over again; that it will avoid every trap set for itself,
and, going round to the back of spring guns, gnaw through the string connected with the trigger
before it drags away the bait. It follows up the lines laid down by the trappers, taking the
martens out, and devouring them, or hiding what it cannot eat, and by wearying out the patience
of the hunters, compel them to strike a new "marten-road."

It is said by Dr. Coues to possess a singular habit of sitting down on its haunches, shading
its eyes with a forepaw, and gazing earnestly at the approaching enemy before it takes to flight.
I have already alluded to the Cape ratel doing this on the look-out for bees. The Indian form
of Wolverene is a slighter and much smaller animal, with a still more weasel-like appearance.
The Glutton is comparatively a large beast, the body being about 2-1/2 feet, and the tail 10
inches; the Helictis is only half the size, and there is a slight difference in the dentition.

GENUS HELICTIS.

"Head tapering; nose acute, conical; muzzle bald, obliquely truncated; other side hairy, with
a central groove; nostrils inferior; ears ovate; body slender; legs short; toes 5.5; front
claws elongate, curved; hinder short and acute; sole of foot hairy behind, bald in front, and
rhombic for half the length of the foot, with three large oblong pads on the front, and three
small ones on the hinder edge; toes elongate; thumb short; fur black, like Herpestes; tail
moderate, sub-cylindrical; teeth, 38; premolars, 4--4/4--4; grinders, 5/6."--Gray.

There are four species of this genus, and of these two come within the geographical limits
of these papers, viz., Helictis Nipalensis and H. moschata; the third, H. orientalis, belongs
to Java; and the fourth, H. subaurantiaca, to Formosa.

NO. 175. HELICTIS NIPALENSIS. The Nepal Wolverene (Jerdon's No. 95).

NATIVE NAME.--Oker, Nepalese; Kyoung-pyan, Arakanese.

HABITAT.--Nepal, Arakan, and Pegu.

DESCRIPTION.--Hodgson, who first described this animal in the 'Journal of the Asiatic Society
of Beng.' (vol. v. pp. 237-38), says: "Above earthy brown; below, with the edge of the upper
lip, the insides of the limbs, and terminal half of the tail, yellow; a white mesial stroke
from the nape to the hips, and a white band across the forehead, spreading on the cheeks, and
confluent with the pale colour of the animal's lower surface; head and body vermi-formed; digits
and nails of the anterior extremities stronger; half way from the os calcis to the fingers
hairy; fur of two sorts and abundant, but not lengthened, nor harsh, nor annulated; tail cylindrico-tapered,
pointed, half the length of the animal." He goes on to add: "The anterior limbs are decidedly
fossorial, and the hinder suited for walking in a sub-plantigrade manner; both wholly unfitted
for rapatory or scansorial purposes."

SIZE.--Head and body 16 inches; tail 7-1/2 inches, 9 inches, including hair.

The habits of this animal are nocturnal. Swinhoe mentions this in his account of the Formosan
species, and Dr. Anderson relates that he is aware that the Nepal one is similar in its ways,
and that it not unfrequently enters Bhotia huts at night; and on one occasion he killed one
in a Bhotia hut, thinking it was a large rat, greatly to the chagrin of his host, who informed
him that the animal was in the habit of visiting him nightly, and was most useful in destroying
cockroaches and other insects.

NO. 176. HELICTIS MOSCHATA. The Chinese Wolverene.

HABITAT.--China, also Burmah (Pegu, Yunnan).

DESCRIPTION.--Similar to the last, but differing in dentition and the formation of certain
points in the skull. The teeth are smaller, and the infra-orbital foramen much larger. Both
the above species are noted for long skulls and palate, whereas H. orientalis has a short skull
and palate. The following are the chief characteristics:--

Short head and palate, large teeth, small infra-orbital foramen = H. orientalis.

Long head and palate, small teeth, large infra-orbital foramen = H. moschata.

Dr. Anderson obtained a specimen of this species at an elevation of 5000 feet, at Teng-yue-chow
in Yunnan.

MUSTELIDAE--MARTENS AND WEASELS.

In India the members of this family are restricted to the Weasels and Martens, but in other
countries are included the Grisons, Zorillas, Skunks, &c. They are small animals of elongated
form, with short legs, commonly expressed as vermiform; where the head of a weasel will go
his body will follow--at least that was my experience in my boyish days, when I was particularly
interested in vermin, and the gamekeeper was my first instructor in natural history. The face
is rounded like a cat, but the skull behind the eye is very long and pear-shaped when viewed
from above; in proportion to a cat's skull the brain case is a fourth longer. They are most
sanguinary in their habits, and their agility is great, so on the whole they are most formidable
to many animals, not only smaller, but in many cases four times their own size. The ferocity
of the common weasel (Putorius vulgaris) ought to be as proverbial as its watchfulness. A case
has been known of a kite carrying off one of these animals, but falling dead after a time with
the large blood-vessels under the wing cut through by the savage little prisoner, who, on reaching
terra firma, escaped apparently unhurt. I think in Wolff's admirable 'Illustrations of Natural
History' this fact, related by Bell, is made the subject of a picture called "Catching a Tartar."

[Figure: Skull of Putorius.]

Most of the animals of this group are eagerly sought for on account of their fur. In Northern
India the skin of one species, probably a variety of Martes abietum, is sold in the bazaars
at Peshawur and Lahore. In 1868 I bought sufficient to line a large overcoat, which proved
most comfortable in travelling in the cold weather in the Punjab, as well as in subsequent
wanderings on the European continent in winter.

Dr. E. Coues, in his monograph on the North American Mustelidae, gives the following interesting
information regarding the number of skins of various species sold by the Hudson's Bay Company
in London during the century 1769-1868:--

Sables, 1,240,511; otters, 674,027; wolverenes, 68,694; minks, 1,507,240; skunks, 218,653;
badgers, 275,302; sea otters, 5349. In 1868, which appears to have been a prosperous year,
the Company sold: Sables, 106,254; otters, 14,966; wolverenes, 1104; minks, 73,473; skunks,
6298; badgers, 1551; sea otters, 123.[8]

[Footnote 8: In the same year were sold by other firms, 22,000 otter skins and 4500 sables.
See Appendix C for further statistics.]

When one considers the number of those whose skins are damaged and cast aside, the number that
fall victims to larger predatory animals, and the operations of disease, from which no animals,
small or great, are free, we may form some idea of the immense multitude of these little creatures.

The ordinary divisions of the restricted Mustelidae are the Martens (Martes), Pole-cats (Putorius),
and Weasels (Mustela), but Gray has further subdivided them chiefly on the characteristics
of the feet.

The Martens have four more teeth than the rest, which are distinguished as follows:--

Putorius.--Short ovate head; feet very hairy, especially between the pads; body stout; underside
blackish.

Mustela.--Narrow, elongated head; feet very hairy between the pads; slender body; under-side
yellow or white.

Vison.--Head elongate, narrow; feet slightly hairy; pads exposed; body rather slender; under-side
same colour as upper.

Gymnopus.--Head elongate, narrow; feet rather naked, bald beneath, between, and rather behind
the pads; toes largely webbed; soles hairy behind; body slender.

It is doubtful whether these distinctions are of sufficient importance to warrant so much subdivision;
and unnecessary multiplication of genera is a thing to be avoided as much as possible.

GENUS MARTES--THE MARTENS.

A more or less arboreal group of larger size, and possibly less sanguinary habits than the
weasels, although in this respect I do not think there is much difference. The tail is longer,
though not so long as the head and body, and it is bushy; the fur is fine and in general highly
prized; the dentition differs from the typical Mustela in having four more teeth and an additional
false molar on either side in each jaw; and the inner side of the carnassial or flesh tooth
has a tubercle which is not present in the weasels; head elongate; feet very hairy; space between
the pads hairy, often covering them from sight, except in the case of Martes flavigula, of
which the soles are nude.

NO. 177. MARTES FLAVIGULA. The White-cheeked Marten (Jerdon's No. 96).

NATIVE NAMES.--Mal-sampra, Nepalese; Tuturala in Kumaon; Kusiah in Sirmoor; Huniah or Aniar,
Bhotia; Sakku, Lepcha.

HABITAT.--Nepal, Thibet, Kumaon, Gurhwal, Sirmoor, Assam, Burmah, Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Glossy blackish brown, with the throat and breast yellow; the chin and lower
parts white, from which I have preferred to call it after Pennant "the White-cheeked Marten"
instead of the "yellow-throated," this characteristic belonging also to some other species.
The fur seems to vary a good deal. Jerdon says of it: "The body is at times dirty brownish
or chestnut brown, or brown mixed with grey, and the middle of the back is sometimes paler
than the rest, or the same tint as the sides of the body. In some the top of the head is pale
brown, but it is edged by a dark peripheral line, and in some there are one or more irregular
dark spots between the fore-limbs."

Blyth writes of the Burmese specimens that they are "similar to the Himalayan, but differing
from the Malayan race--found also in Formosa--by having much longer fur, and a wholly black
cap instead of a brown cap with a black periphery." The soles are nude.

SIZE.--Head and body about 20 inches; tail, including fur, 12 inches.

This Indian Marten, according to Jerdon, is also found in Ceylon; it was, however, apparently
unknown to Kellaart, nor does Sir Emerson Tennent allude to it. It is to be had in the Neilgherries,
the Khasia hills, and the ranges in Arakan, as well as in the valleys of the great Himalayan
chain up to 7000 or 8000 feet of elevation. It is found in pairs or in small families of five
or six. If hunted it takes to trees at once, being a good climber. According to Captain the
Hon. C. Shore, who observed its habits in Kumaon and Gurhwal, "its food is chiefly birds, rats,
mice, hares and even young fawns of the kakur or barking-deer." He adds: "The specimen sent
to the Zoological Society was brought to me in September 1828, when it was about four months
old. It had been caught when not many days old, and was so tame that it was always kept loose
about a well, sporting about the windlasses, posts, &c., and playing tricks with the people
who came to draw water." This is the one alluded to by Jerdon as having been described by Mr.
Bennett in the 'Gardens and Menageries of the Zoological Society.' Martes Gwatkinsi of Horsfield's
Catalogue (page 99), is evidently, as Jerdon says, the same as M. flavigula, although the colouring
is different, and is supposed to be the same animal in its summer fur, some specimens being
darker than others. It is just one hundred years since this little animal was first described,
the earliest record of it being in Pennant's 'History of Quadrupeds' (first edition), published
in 1781. It must, however, have been known before that, for Pennant first observed it in Brooks's
Menagerie in 1774, and named it the "White-cheeked Weasel," which Boddart afterwards in 1785
introduced into his 'Elenchus Animalium' under the name of Mustela flavigula (Horsfield).

NO. 178. MARTES ABIETUM. The Pine Marten.

HABITAT.--Ladakh and the Upper Himalayas, Afghanistan (?)

DESCRIPTION.--Brown; throat yellow or yellow spotted (Gray). Light yellowish-grey, rather deeper
in a line along the back; the hair brown; extremities blackish; chin, threat and breast white
(according to Horsfield).

SIZE.--About 18 to 20 inches; tail 12 inches.

Horsfield remarks that the specimens received in the Indian Museum combine the peculiarities
of the Pine and Beech Martens respectively, and lead to the conclusion that both are varieties
of one species. This idea was prevalent some time ago, and the Beech Marten (M. foina) was
supposed to be merely a variety of the Pine species, but there are certain differences in the
skulls of the two animals. It is stated by the editor of my edition of Cuvier that, on examination
of the crania of the two, he found that those of M. abietum are constantly smaller, with the
zygomatic arch fully twice as strong as in the other. There is also a slight difference in
the teeth, the hinder upper tubercular grinder in M. foina not being quite so large as in the
other.

The Pine Marten has a wide distribution; the finest specimens are found in Sweden; in England
it is becoming scarce, but in other parts of Europe and Asia it is common. Professor Parker
and his brother write of it: "This animal is essentially arboreal in its habits, inhabiting
chiefly thick coniferous woods, whence its name of Pine Marten is derived. In the branches
the female makes a nest of leaves or moss, and sometimes spares herself this trouble by ejecting
squirrels or woodpeckers, and occupying the vacant dwellings. For its size it is, like all
the Mustelidae, extremely ferocious and strong. It attacks and kills fawns, notwithstanding
their superior size; from these down to mice nothing comes amiss to it, and nothing is safe
from its attacks." It seems almost incredible that such a small animal should venture on such
large game, but the same is reported of M. flavigula; and a much smaller creature, the Yellow-bellied
Weasel, M. kathiah, is reported by Hodgson to attack even goats and sheep.

NO. 179. MARTES TOUFOEUS.

NATIVE NAME.--Toufee.

HABITAT.--Thibet.

DESCRIPTION (from skins only).--General colour smoky brown, darker along the spine and on the
limbs, but without marks, and paler to sordid yellowish hoary on the neck and head; head palest,
except the mystaceal region and chin, which are embrowned; moustache moderate and dark brown.

SIZE.--Head and body about 20 to 22 inches.

The above description is taken from Hodgson, who had only received imperfect skins. Jerdon
just alludes to it by name, but I cannot find it mentioned by any other author. As much stress
cannot be laid on colouring in these animals, I feel inclined to think that it is a variety
of Martes abietum, probably in its dark summer coat.

GENUS MUSTELA--THE WEASELS.

These are smaller animals of the true vermiform shape; the legs are very short in comparison
with the body, and the neck is very thick and very long, and the head is small, so that head,
neck, and body are almost equally cylindrical, and the length of the neck gives a far, set-back
appearance to the forelegs, so much so that they seem to start from behind the chest instead
of in front of it. The teeth are 34 in number, or four less than in the preceding genus; upper
tubercular grinder transverse or broader than long; the feet are slightly webbed, covered with
hair, and the space between the pads is hairy; the tail is short; fur dark above, white or
yellowish beneath.

Some authors contend that the weasel, though commonly referred to the genus Mustela, should
be Putorius, which is an instance of the disagreement which exists among naturalists. I have
however followed Gray in his classification, although perhaps Cuvier, who classes the weasels
and pole-cats under the genus Putorius, has the claim of priority. Ray applied the name of
Mustela to the restricted weasels, and Martes to the martens, but Cuvier gives Mustela to the
martens, and brings the weasels and pole-cats together under Putorius.

NO. 180. MUSTELA (VISON: Gray) SUB-HEMACHALANA. The Sub-Hemachal Weasel (Jerdon's No. 97).

NATIVE NAMES.--Zimiong, Bhotia; Sang-king, Lepcha; Kran or Gran, Kashmiri.

DESCRIPTION.--"Uniform bright brown, darker along the dorsal line; nose, upper lip, and forehead,
with two inches of the end of the tail black-brown; mere edge of upper lip and whole of lower
jaw hoary; a short longitudinal white stripe occasionally on the front of the neck, and some
vague spots of the same laterally, the signs, I suspect, of immaturity; feet frequently darker
than the body or dusky brown; whiskers dark; fur close, glossy and soft, of two sorts, or fine
hair and soft wool, the latter and the hair basally of dusky hue, but the hair externally bright
brown; head, ears, and limbs more closely clad than the body, tail more laxly, tapering to
the point."--Hodgson.

SIZE.--Head and body about 12 inches; tail, 6 inches.

Jerdon calls this the Himalayan Weasel, but I have preferred to translate Hodgson's' name,
which, I confess, puzzled me for some time till I found out there was a Hemachal range in Thibet.

NO. 181. MUSTELA (GYMNOPUS: Gray) KATHIAH. The Yellow-bellied Weasel (Jerdon's No. 98).

NATIVE NAME.--Kathia-nyal, Nepalese.

HABITAT.--Nepal, Bhotan.

DESCRIPTION.--Dark brown; upper lip, chin, throat, chest, underside of body and front of thighs,
bright yellow; tail dark brown, shorter than the body and head, tapering, and of the same colour
to the tip; the soles of the hind feet bald; pads well developed, exposed.

SIZE.--Head and body, 10 inches; tail, 5 inches.

Hodgson states that a horribly offensive yellowish-grey fluid exudes from two subcaudal glands.
He says that the Nepalese highly prize this little animal for its services in ridding houses
of rats. It is easily tamed; and such is the dread of it common to all murine animals that
not one will approach a house wherein it is domiciled. Rats and mice seem to have an instinctive
sense of its hostility to them, so much so that when it is introduced into a house they are
observed to hurry away in all directions, being apprised, no doubt, of its presence by the
peculiar odour it emits. Its ferocity and courage are made subservient to the amusement of
the rich, who train it to attack large fowls, geese, and even goats and sheep. It seizes these
by the great artery of the neck, and does not quit its hold till the victim sinks exhausted
from the loss of blood--a cruel pastime which one could only expect of a barbarous people.

NO. 182. MUSTELA (GYMNOPUS: Gray) STRIGIDORSA. The Striped Weasel (Jerdon's No. 99).

HABITAT.--Sikim.

DESCRIPTION.--Dark chestnut-brown, with a narrow streak of long yellow hairs down the back;
edge of upper lip, chin, throat, chest, and a narrow stripe down the centre of the belly, yellow,
or yellowish-white.

SIZE.--Head and body, 12 inches; tail, 5-1/2 inches without the hair, 6-1/2 inches with it.

This is similar to the last, but is slightly larger, and distinguishable by the dorsal stripe.

NO. 183. MUSTELA ERMINEA. The Ermine or Stoat.

HABITAT.--Europe, America and Asia (the Himalayas, Nepal, Thibet, Afghanistan).

DESCRIPTION.--Brown above; upper lip, chin, and lower surface of body, inside of limbs and
feet yellowish-white; tail brown, with a black tip. In winter the whole body changes to a yellowish-white,
with the exception of the black tip of the tail.

SIZE.--Head and body, about 10 inches; tail, 4-1/2 inches.

This is about the best known in a general way from its fur being used as part of the insignia
of royalty. The fur however only becomes valuable after it has completed its winter change.
How this is done was for a long time a subject of speculation and inquiry. It is, however,
now proved that it is according to season that the mode of alteration is effected. In spring
the new hairs are brown, replacing the white ones of winter; in autumn the existing brown hairs
turn white. Mr. Bell, who gave the subject his careful consideration, says that in Ross's first
Polar expedition, a Hudson's Bay lemming (Myodes) was exposed in its summer coat to a temperature
of 30 degrees below zero. Next morning the fur on the cheeks and a patch on each shoulder had
become perfectly white; at the end of the week the winter change was complete, with the exception
of a dark band across the shoulder and a dorsal stripe.

Hodgson remarks that the Ermine is common in Thibet, where the skins enter largely into the
peltry trade with China.

In one year 187,000 skins were imported into England.

NO. 184. MUSTELA (VISON: Gray) CANIGULA. The Hoary Red-necked Weasel.

HABITAT.--Nepal hills, Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Pale reddish-brown, scarcely paler beneath; face, chin, throat, sides of neck
and chest white; tail half as long as body and head, concolorous with the back; feet whitish.
Sometimes chest brown and white mottled, according to Gray. Hodgson, who discovered the animal,
writes: "Colour throughout cinnamon red without black tip to the tail, but the chaffron and
entire head and neck below hoary."

SIZE.--15-1/2 inches; tail without hair 7-1/2 inches, with hair 9-1/2 inches.

NO. 185. MUSTELA STOLICZKANA.

HABITAT.--Yarkand.

DESCRIPTION.--Colour pale sandy brown above; hairs light at base, white below; tail concolorous
with back; small white spot close to anterior angle of each eye; a sandy spot behind the gape;
feet whitish.

SIZE.--Head and body, 12.2; tail, 3 inches, including hair.

NO. 186. MUSTELA (VISON) SIBIRICA.

HABITAT.--Himalayas (Thibet?); Afghanistan (Candahar).

DESCRIPTION.--Pale brown; head blackish, varied; spot on each side of nose, on upper and lower
lips and front of chin, white; tail end pale brown like back, varies; throat more or less white.

This Weasel, described first by Pallas ('Specil Zool.' xiv. t. 4, f. 1.) was obtained in Candahar
by Captain T. Hutton, who describes it in the 'Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal,' vol. xiv.
pp. 346 to 352.

NO. 187. MUSTELA ALPINA. The Alpine Weasel.

HABITAT.--Said to be found in Thibet, otherwise an inhabitant of the Altai mountains.

DESCRIPTION.--Pale yellow brown; upper lip, chin, and underneath yellowish-white; head varied
with black-tipped hairs; tail cylindrical, unicolour, not so long as head and body.--Gray.

NO. 188. MUSTELA HODGSONI.

HABITAT.--Himalaya, Afghanistan.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur yellowish-brown, paler beneath; upper part and side of head much darker;
face, chin, and throat varied with white; tail long, and bushy towards the end.

NO. 189. MUSTELA (VISON) HORSFIELDI.

HABITAT.--Bhotan.

DESCRIPTION.--Uniform dark blackish-brown, very little paler beneath; middle of front of chin
and lower lip white; whiskers black; tail slender, blackish at tip, half the length of head
and body.

NO. 190. MUSTELA (GYMNOPUS) NUDIPES. Gymnopus leucocephalus of Gray.

HABITAT.--Borneo, Sumatra, Java, but possibly Tenasserim.

DESCRIPTION.--Golden fulvous with white head.

As so many Malayan animals are found on the confines of Burmah, and even extending into Assam,
it is probable that this species may be discovered in Tenasserim.

GENUS PUTORIUS--THE POLE-CAT.

This is a larger animal than the weasel, and in form more resembles the marten, except in the
shortness of its tail; the body is stouter and the neck shorter than in Mustela; the head is
short and ovate; the feet generally hairy, and the space between the pads very much so; the
under side of the body is blackish; the fur is made up of two kinds, the shorter is woolly
and lighter coloured than the longer, which is dark and shining.

The disgusting smell of the common Pole-cat (Putorius foetidus) is well known, and has become
proverbial. In my county, as well as in many parts of England, the popular name is "foumart,"
which is said to be derived from "foul marten." The foumart is the special abhorrence of the
game-keeper; it does more damage amongst game and poultry than any of the other Mustelidae,
and consequently greater pains are taken to trap and shoot it, in fact, so much so that I wonder
that the animal is not now extinct in the British Isles. Professor Parker writes: "It has been
known to kill as many as sixteen turkeys in a single night; and indeed it seems to be a point
of honour with this bloodthirsty little creature to kill everything it can overpower, and to
leave no survivors on its battle-fields." According to Bell, a female Pole-cat, which was tracked
to her nest, was found to have laid up in a side hole a store of food consisting of forty frogs
and two toads, all bitten through the brain, so that, though capable of living for some time,
they were deprived of the power of escape. Now, this is a most wonderful instance of instinct
bordering upon reason. Only the Reptilia can exist for any length of time after injury to the
brain; to any of the smaller mammalia such a process as that adopted by the Pole-cat, would
have resulted in instant death and speedy decomposition.

The Ferret (Putorius furo) is a domesticated variety of the Pole-cat, reputed to be of African
origin. Certain it is that it cannot stand extreme cold like its wild cousin, and an English
winter is fatal to it if not properly looked after. It inter-breeds with the Pole-cat.

Ferrets are not safe pets in houses where there are young children. Cases have been known of
their attacking infants in the cradle, and severely lacerating them.

They are chiefly used for killing rats and driving rabbits out of burrows; in the latter case
they are muzzled. As pets they are stupid, and show but little attachment. Forbearance as regards
making its teeth meet in your fingers is, I think, the utmost you can expect in return for
kindness to a ferret, and that is something, considering what a sanguinary little beast it is.

HABITAT.--Utsang in Thibet, also Ladakh.

DESCRIPTION.--"Tail one-third of entire length; soles clad; fur long; above and laterally sordid
fulvous, deeply shaded on the back with black; below from throat backwards, with the whole
limbs and tail, black; head pale, with a dark mask over the face."--Hodgson.

SIZE.--Head and body, 14 inches; tail, 6 inches, with hair 7 inches; palma, 1-3/4; planta, 2-3/8.

This animal, according to Gray, is synonymous with the Siberian Putorius Eversmannii, although
the sudden contraction of the brain case in front, behind the orbit, mentioned of this species,
is not perceptible in the illustration given by Hodgson of the skull of this Thibetan specimen.
Horsfield, in his catalogue, states that the second specimen obtained by Captain R. Strachey
in Ladakh, north of Kumaon, agreed in external character.

In some respects it is similar to the European Pole-cat, but as yet little is known of its habits.

NO. 192. PUTORIUS DAVIDIANUS.

HABITAT.--Moupin in Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Uniform fulvous brown, yellower under the throat; upper lip and round nostrils
to corner of the eye white, darker on nose and forehead.

SIZE.--Head and body about 11-1/2 inches; tail, 6-1/2 inches.

This is one of the specimens collected by the Abbe David, after whom it is named. A fuller
description of it will be found in Milne-Edwards's 'Recherches sur les Mammiferes,' page 343.
There is also a plate of the animal in the volume of illustrations.

NO. 193. PUTORIUS ASTUTUS.

HABITAT.--Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--About the size of Ermine, but with a longer tail. Colour brown, the white of
the chest tinted with yellow; tail uniform in colour, darker on head.

This is also described and figured by Milne-Edwards.

NO. 194. PUTORIUS MOUPINENSIS.

HABITAT.--Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Reddish-brown, white under the chin, and then again a patch on the chest.

LUTRIDAE--THE OTTERS.

We now come to the third group of the musteline animals, the most aquatic of all the Fissipedia--the
Lutridae or Otters--of which there are two great divisions, the common Otters (Lutra) and the
Sea-Otters, (Enhydra). With the latter, a most interesting animal in all its ways, as well
as most valuable on account of its fur, we have nothing to do. I am not aware that it is found
in the tropics, but is a denizen of the North Pacific. Of Lutra we have several species in
two genera. Dr. Gray has divided the Otters into no less than nine genera on three characteristics,
the tail, feet, and muzzle, but these have been held open to objection. The classification
most to be depended upon is the division of the tribe into long-clawed Otters (Lutra), and
short or rudimentary-clawed Otters (Aonyx). The characteristics of the skulls confirm this
arrangement, as the short-clawed Otters are distinguishable from the others by a shorter and
more globose cranium and larger molars, and, as Dr. Anderson says, "the inner portion of the
last molar being the largest part of the tooth, while in Lutra the outer exceeds the inner
half; the almost general absence of the first upper premolar; and the rudimentary claws, which
are associated with much more feebly-developed finger and toe bones, which are much tapered
to a point, while in Lutra these bones are strong and well developed." Gray has separated a
genus, which he called Pteronura, on account of a flattened tail arising from a longitudinal
ridge on each side, but this flattening of the tail is common to all the genera more or less.

All the Otters, though active on land, are still only thoroughly at home in the water, and
they are therefore specially constituted for such a mode of life. They have an elongated flattened
form; webbed feet with short claws; compressed and tapering tail; dense fur of two kinds, one
of long brown shining hairs; the under fur short and fine, impervious to wet, and well adapted
for keeping an equality of temperature; the skull is peculiar, the brain case being very long,
and compressed from above downwards; the facial portion forms only about one-fourth of the
extreme length; the teeth are strong and sharp; the upper flesh tooth very large.

Jerdon states that the otter has a nictitating membrane or additional semi-transparent eyelid,
similar to that in the eyes of birds, which he supposes is a defence to them under water; but
I have not noticed this myself, and have failed to discover it in the writings of others. I
should think that the vision of the animal under water would not require obscuring by a semi-transparent
membrane, which none of the marine carnivora possess, though their eyes are somewhat formed
for seeing better under water than when exposed to the full light above. Some idea of the rapidity
of these animals in the water may be conceived when we think that their food is almost exclusively
fish, of which they sometimes kill more than they can eat. They reside in burrows, making the
entrance under water, and working upwards, making a small hole for the ventilation of their
chamber. The female has about four or five young ones at a time, after a period of gestation
of about nine weeks, and the mother very soon drives them forth to shift for themselves in
the water.

Professor Parker, who also notices Kingsley's description,[9] states that the Canadian otter
has a peculiar habit in winter of sliding down ridges of snow, apparently for amusement. It,
with its companions, scrambles up a high ridge, and then, lying down flat, glides head-foremost
down the declivity, sometimes for a distance of twenty yards. "This sport they continue apparently
with the keenest enjoyment, until fatigue or hunger induces them to desist."

[Footnote 9: In fact it was his quotation that induced me to buy a copy of that most charming
little book, which I recommend every one to read.--R. A. S.]

The following are the Indian species; Lutra nair, L. simung vel monticola, L. Ellioti, and
L. aurobrunnea of the long-clawed family, and Aonyx leptonyx of the short-clawed.

NATIVE NAMES.--Ud or Ood, Ood-bilao, Panikutta, Hindi; Nir-nai, Canarese; Neeru-kuka, Telegu;
Jal-manjer, Mahratti.

HABITAT.--India generally, Burmah and Ceylon.

DESCRIPTION.--Hair more or less brown above, sometimes with a chestnut hue, sometimes grizzled,
or with a tinge of dun; yellowish-white, or with a fulvescent tinged white below; the throat,
upper lip, and sides of head are nearly white; the line of separation of upper and lower parts
not very distinctly marked. Some have whitish paws.

SIZE.--Head and body, 29 to 30 inches; tail about 17 inches.
