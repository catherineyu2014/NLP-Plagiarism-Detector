It has been already pointed out, and is probably well known, that the clergyman of the parish
church has possessed from immemorial time the prerogative of refusing to allow in the churchyard
under his control any monument, gravestone, design, or epitaph which is, in his opinion, irreverent,
indecorous, or in any way unbecoming the solemnity and sanctity of the place. This authority,
wherever exercised, has been subject to the higher jurisdiction of the Diocesan Bishop, and
presumably to the rule of the Ecclesiastical Courts; but, as we have seen, the authority has
been but indifferently employed, and the inference is that the clergy have in times past been
wofully ignorant or lamentably careless as to their powers and obligations. A more healthy
system now prevails, and we seldom or never find anything in the way of ornament, emblem, or
inscription of an offensive or ridiculous character placed in any of our burial-grounds, the
Burial Boards being as strict and watchful over the cemeteries as the rectors and vicars are
in the management of the churchyards. Nor has there been, so far as we have gone, any difficulty
in reconciling this stringency of supervision with the Acts of Parliament which have been passed
in recognition of religious equality at the grave; and it is not too much to hope that there
is in the present day such universal prevalence of good taste and propriety under the solemnity
of death as to ensure concurrence among all sects and parties in securing decorum in all things
relating to interments. To the incongruities which have been left to us as legacies from our
ancestors we may be indulgent. They are landmarks of the generations which created them, and
records of times and manners which we would fain believe that we have left behind in these
days of better education and better thought. They are therefore of value to us as items of
history, and, though we would not repeat many of them, we shall preserve them, not only because
we reverence the graves of our forefathers, but because they are entitled to our protection
as ancient monuments. However uncouth they may be in design or expression, they must be tolerated
for their age. It cannot be denied that some of them try our patience, in the epitaphs even
more perhaps than in the carvings, and "merely mock whom they were meant to honour." Two out
of a vast number may be selected as painful evidences of a departed century's tombstone ribaldry.
The first, from a village near Bath, is a deplorable mixture of piety and profanity, sentiment
and vulgarity:

    "To the memory of Thomas and Richard Fry, stonemasons, who
    were crushed to death, Aug. the 25th, 1776, by the slipdown
    of a wall they were in the act of building. Thomas was 19 and
    Richard 21 years.

    "They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in death
    were not divided.

    "Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for their works follow
    them.

    "A sacred Truth: now learn our awful fate.

  "Dear Friends, we were first cousins, and what not:
  To toil as masons was our humble lot.
  As just returning from a house of call,
  The parson bade us set about his wall.
  Flush'd with good liquor, cheerfully we strove
  To place big stones below and big above;
  We made too quick work--down the fabric came;
  It crush'd our vitals: people call'd out shame!
  But we heard nothing, mute as fish we lay,
  And shall lie sprawling till the judgment day.
  From our misfortune this good moral know--
  Never to work too fast nor drink too slow."

The habit of imitation which we have noticed in the masonry of the gravestone is even more
pronounced in the epitaphs.

These lines, however, have undergone variations out of number, a not infrequent device being
to adapt them to circumstances by such changes as--

  "Affliction sore short time I bore," etc.

The same idea has an extended application at the grave of Joseph Crate, who died in 1805, aged
42 years, and is buried at Hendon Churchyard:

  "Affliction sore long time I bore,
        Physicians were in vain:
  My children dear and wife, whose care
        Assuaged my every pain,
  Are left behind to mourn my fate:
        Then Christians let them find
  That pity which their case excites
        And prove to them most kind."

But the most startling perversion of the original text I saw in the churchyard at Saundersfoot,
South Wales, where the stone-carver had evidently had his lesson by dictation, and made many
original mistakes, the most notable of which was in the second line:--

  "Affliction sore long time I bore,
        Anitions were in vain," etc.

The following from Hyden, Yorkshire, is remarkable:

    "William Strutton, of Padrington, buried 18th May, 1734,
    aged 97 years, who had by his first wife 28 children, by
    his second, 17: was own father to 45, grandfather to 86,
    great-grandfather to 23; in all 154 children."

Witty tombstones, even when they are not vulgar, are always in bad taste. Two well-known instances
may suffice--

  On Dr. Walker, who wrote a book on English
      Particles:

    "Here lie Walker's Particles."

  On Dr. Fuller:

    "Here lies Fuller's Earth."

The same misplaced jocularity must be accountable for an enigmatical inscription at St. Andrew's,
Worcester, on the tomb of a man who died in 1780, aged 65 years:

  "H.L.T.B.O.
      R.W.
  I.H.O.A.J.R."

This, we are told, should be read as follows:

  "Here lyeth the Body of
      Richard Weston
  In hope of a Joyful Resurrection."

Rhymed epitaphs have a history almost contemporaneous with that of the old gravestones, having
their flourishing period between the middle of the seventeenth century and the early part of
the nineteenth century. They were little used in England prior to the reign of James the First,
and it is supposed that Mary, Queen of Scots, brought the custom from France. She is also said
to have been an adept at composing epitaphs, and some attributed to her are extant.

It may be suspected also that other inventors have written a vast number of the more or less
apocryphal elegies which go to make up the many books of epitaphs which have been published;
but this is a point wide of our subject, and we must be careful in our Rambles that we do not
go astray.

    THE RECORDS OF THE WOOLWICH DISTRICT.

    BY W.T. VINCENT,

    President of the Woolwich Antiquarian Society.

    Comprising Woolwich, Plumstead, Charlton, Shooters' Hill,
    Westcombe Park, Eltham, Abbey Wood, Belvedere, Erith, and
    Bexley.

    WITH FIVE HUNDRED ILLUSTRATIONS.

    The Work is Dedicated, by permission, to H.R.H. PRINCE ARTHUR,
    DUKE OF CONNAUGHT, and has been graciously accepted by HER
    MAJESTY THE QUEEN and H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES. It has
    also been universally extolled in the Press, from which the
    following are a few extracts:--

    "THE RECORDS OF WOOLWICH.--Mr. Freeman long ago suggested that
    it would be a useful division of labour if separate towns and
    districts were described by those in the several localities
    who had special knowledge on the subject, and he himself led
    the way in carrying out the design. Of local guide-books so
    called there is no end, but what is wanted in each case is an
    exhaustive history of the district, its natural formation, its
    antiquities, and the many objects of interest that are sure to
    abound, and that only want to be brought to light in order to
    form material for the future historian of the English nation.
    This labour Mr. W.T. Vincent proposes to perform for Woolwich
    in a work which he entitles 'The Records of the Woolwich
    District.' Mr. Vincent has been engaged in the task for
    twelve years. This is the work of a writer who has studied his
    subject in all the places where information can be obtained.
    The Preface alone will gain the reader's attention, even if
    the locality itself had no interest for him. It appears that
    Mr. Vincent had scented out the existence of a sealed packet
    of papers having reference to Woolwich, and, after a long
    hunt, ran the packet to earth in the British Museum. It was
    not until the authorities of the War Office had deliberated
    for a month on the subject that Mr. Vincent was allowed to see
    and open the packet, which was more than a hundred years old,
    and contained maps, plans, and views, several of which he
    produces."--The Times.

    "We must resist the temptation to extract, and conclude this
    notice by expressing our approval of the numerous facsimile
    reproductions of old prints illustrative of the text, each on
    a leaf of plate paper, while vignettes, maps, and plans are
    liberally dispersed through the letterpress, which is executed
    by Messrs. Virtue and Co., the well-known printers of the Art
    Journal. As to the text, the industry, care, research, and
    observation expended shew that it has been a labour of love.
    No prospect of profit could urge the production of such a
    work. It is, therefore, doubly reliable as a contribution
    to the antiquarian, topographical, anecdotal, pictorial, and
    descriptive history of an interesting locality, executed by
    a writer who is 'to the manner born.' We fully hope that Mr.
    Thomas Vincent, whose name is not unknown in the literary
    world, will reap his reward of fame and respect from his
    townsmen, and of fair profit, which his public spirit
    deserves."--The Morning Advertiser.

    "'The Records of the Woolwich District' deal with all the
    parishes which surround Shooters' Hill, necessarily dwelling
    most fully upon the northern slope. Of Shooters' Hill itself,
    and of all the other suburbs, some novel and attractive
    tidings may be expected."--The Kentish Independent.

    "There can be no doubt that such a work, adequately and
    conscientiously executed, is much needed, and may be of great
    value. It has been undertaken by Mr. Vincent, well known as a
    journalist in the locality, and as the author of that useful
    directory 'Warlike Woolwich.' ... The printing has been
    entrusted to Messrs. Virtue and Co., the proprietors of the
    Art Journal, a sufficient guarantee for its quality. We are
    notified that there are over five hundred illustrations to be
    introduced, including a series of maps and drawings, included
    in the 'sealed packet,' and a hundred and fifty portraits of
    public persons, past and present. ... We hope the publication
    will command the success it deserves. The object of the author
    is evidently not mere money-making; he has undertaken the work
    from an earnest and enthusiastic desire to supply a worthy
    history of the locality with which he has been for his life
    connected, and we congratulate him upon the excellent promise
    of his First Number."--The Kentish Mercury.
