PREFACE

The 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers is one of the oldest regiments in the service. It
was raised in February and March, 1661, to form the garrison of Bombay, which had been ceded
to the Crown as part of the dowry of the Infanta of Portugal, on her marriage with King Charles
II. It then consisted of four companies, the establishment of each being one captain, one lieutenant,
one ensign, two sergeants, three corporals, two drummers, and 100 privates, and arrived at
Bombay on September 18th, 1662, under the command of Sir Abraham Shipman. Under various titles
it took part in nearly all the continuous fighting of which the history of India of those days
is principally composed, being generally known as the Bombay European Regiment, until in March,
1843, it was granted the title of 1st Bombay Fusiliers. In 1862 the regiment was transferred
to the Crown, when the word 'Royal' was added to its title, and it became known as the 103rd
Regiment, The Royal Bombay Fusiliers. In 1873 the regiment was linked to the Royal Madras Fusiliers,
whose history up to that time had been very similar to its own. By General Order 41, of 1881,
the titles of the two regiments underwent yet another change, when they became known by their
present names, the 1st and 2nd Battalions Royal Dublin Fusiliers.

The 2nd Battalion first left India for home service on January 2nd, 1871, when it embarked
on H.M.S. Malabar, arriving at Portsmouth Harbour about 8 a.m. on February 4th, and was stationed
at Parkhurst. Its home service lasted until 1884, when it embarked for Gibraltar. In 1885 it
moved to Egypt, and in 1886 to India, where it was quartered until 1897, when it was suddenly
ordered to South Africa, on account of our strained relations with the Transvaal Republic.
On arrival at Durban, however, the difficulties had been settled for the time being, and the
regiment was quartered at Pietermaritzburg until it moved up to Dundee in 1899, just previous
to the outbreak of war.

The late Major-General Penn-Symons assumed command of the Natal force in 1897, and from that
date commenced the firm friendship and mutual regard between him and the regiment, which lasted
without a break until the day when he met his death at Talana. The interest he took in the
battalion and his zeal resulted in a stiff training, but a training for which we must always
feel grateful, and remember with kind, if sad, recollections. It was his custom to see a great
deal of the regiments under his command, and he very frequently lunched with us, by which means
he not only made himself personally acquainted with the characters of the officers of the regiment,
but also had an opportunity of seeing for himself the deep esprit de corps which existed in
it, and without which no regiment can ever hope to successfully overcome the perils and hardships
incidental to active service.

As the shadow of the coming war grew dark and ever darker on the Northern horizon, the disposition
of the Natal troops underwent some change, and General Penn-Symons' brigade, of which the regiment
formed part, was moved up to Dundee, and was there stationed at the time of the outbreak of
hostilities. In spite of the long roll of battle honours, of which both battalions are so justly
proud, the South African Campaign was the first active service either had seen under their
present titles, and the first opportunity afforded them of making those new titles as celebrated
as the old ones which had done so much towards the acquisition of our Indian Empire. Imbued
with these feelings the regiment lay camped within full view of Talana Hill, waiting the oncoming
of the huge wave of invasion which was so shortly to sweep over the borders, engulf Ladysmith,
and threaten to reach Maritzburg itself. But that was not to be. Its force was spent long ere
it reached the capital, and a few horsemen near the banks of the Mooi River marked the line
of its utmost limit in this direction.

The present work only claims to be a plain soldier's narrative of the part taken by the 2nd
Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers in stemming this rush, and its subsequent efforts, its grim
fights on the hills which fringe the borders of the River Tugela, its long and weary marches
across the rolling uplands of the Transvaal, and its subsequent monotonous life of constant
vigil in fort and blockhouse, and on escort duty.

All five battalions took part in the war. The 1st sailed from Ireland on November 10th, 1899,
and sent three companies under Major Hicks to strengthen the 2nd Battalion. They arrived in
time to share in the action at Colenso on December 15th, and all the subsequent fighting which
finally resulted in the relief of Ladysmith, after which they returned to the headquarters
of the 1st Battalion, which formed part of the Natal army under General Sir Redvers Buller,
and later on advanced through Laing's Nek and Alleman's Nek into the Transvaal. The 3rd Battalion
sent a very strong draft of its reserve, and the 4th and 5th Battalions volunteered and came
out to the front, where they rendered most excellent service. In addition to the battalions
there were a good many officers of one or other battalion employed in various ways in the huge
theatre of operations. Major Godley and Major Pilson had been selected for special service
before the war, and the former served in Mafeking during the siege, while the latter served
under General Plumer in his endeavours to raise it. Captain Kinsman also served with the latter
force. Major Rutherford, Adjutant of the Ceylon Volunteers, arrived in command of the contingent
from that corps. Lieutenants Cory and Taylor served with the Mounted Infantry most of the time,
as did Lieutenants Garvice, Grimshaw, and Frankland, after the capture of Pretoria, while Captain
Carington Smith's share in the war is briefly stated later on. Captain MacBean was on the staff
until he was killed at Nooitgedacht. The M.I. of the regiment served with great distinction,
and it is regretted that it is impossible to include an account of the many actions and marches
in which they took part, but the present volume deals almost exclusively with the battalion
as a battalion.

The authors are desirous of expressing their most hearty and cordial thanks to all those who
have assisted them in the preparation of this volume. They are especially indebted to Colonel
H. Tempest Hicks, C.B., without whose co-operation the work could not have been carried out,
for the loan of his diary, and for the sketches and many of the photographs. To Colonel F.
P. English, D.S.O., for the extracts from his diary containing an account of the operations
in the Aden Hinterland and photographs. To Captain L. F. Renny for his Ladysmith notes. Also
to Sergeant-Major C. V. Brumby, Quartermaster-Sergeant Purcell, and Mr. French (late Quartermaster-Sergeant),
for assistance in collecting data, compiling the appendix, and for photographs, respectively.

THE 2ND BATTALION

ROYAL DUBLIN FUSILIERS

CHAPTER I.

TALANA.

The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers left India for Maritzburg, Natal, in 1897,
and therefore, on the outbreak of the war between Great Britain and the South African Republics,
had the advantage of possessing some acquaintance with the topography of the colony, and of
a two years' training and preparation for the long struggle which was to ensue.

The political situation had become so threatening by July, 1899, that the military authorities
began to take precautionary measures, and the battalion was ordered to effect a partial mobilisation
and to collect its transport. On September 20th it moved by train to Ladysmith,[1] and four
days later proceeded to Dundee. Here Major-General Sir W. Penn-Symons assumed the command of
a small force, consisting of 18th Hussars, 13th, 67th, and 69th Batteries R.F.A., 1st Leicestershire
Regiment, 1st King's Royal Rifles, and 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Each infantry battalion
had a mounted infantry company. The brigade was reinforced on October 16th by the 1st Royal
Irish Fusiliers.

         [Footnote 1: It was at Ladysmith that the battalion adopted
         the green tops on the helmets, a distinguishing badge which
         was worn throughout the war. The 1st Battalion painted theirs
         blue on account of the historic nickname, 'Blue-caps,'
         acquired by them at the time of the Mutiny.]

The country was still nominally at peace, but the Dundee force held itself ready for emergencies,
and sent out mounted patrols by day and infantry piquets by night, while the important railway
junction at Glencoe was held by a company. The General utilised this period of waiting in carrying
out field-firing and practising various forms of attack. As he was a practical and experienced
soldier, he succeeded in bringing his command to a high state of efficiency, and the battalion
owed much to his careful preparation. It was due largely to his teaching that the men knew
how to advance from cover to cover and displayed such ready 'initiative' in the various battles
of the Natal Campaign. The opportunity of putting into practice this teaching soon presented
itself, for on October 12th news was received that the South African Republics had declared
war on the previous day.

Consideration of the advisability of pushing forward a small force to Dundee, and of the reasons
for such a movement, does not fall within the scope of this work; but a glance at the map will
show that Sir W. Penn-Symons had a wide front to watch, since he could be attacked from three
sides. Although precise information regarding the Boer forces was lacking, it was known that
commandoes were assembling at Volksrust, along the left bank of the Buffalo River, and on the
far side of Van Reenan's Pass.

Early in the morning of October 13th a telegram was received from Sir G. White, asking General
Penn-Symons to send a battalion to Ladysmith at once, as the Boers were reported to be advancing
on that town. The General paid the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers the compliment of selecting them
for this duty, and they entrained accordingly, about 4.30 a.m., reaching Ladysmith some four
hours later. They detrained with the utmost haste and marched at once towards Dewdrop, whither
the Ladysmith garrison had been sent; but the report of a Boer advance was discovered to be
without foundation, and the battalion was halted five miles outside Ladysmith, and ordered
to return. It did not reach the camp at Dundee until 11 p.m.

On the following day Sir W. Penn-Symons moved his detachment closer to the town of Dundee,
and placed his camp three or four hundred yards north of the road to Glencoe Junction. It soon
became clear that the Boers meant to invade Natal, and Newcastle was occupied by them on the
15th, while the mounted patrols of the Dundee force were already in touch with the commandoes
on the left bank of the Buffalo. The detached company at Glencoe was withdrawn on the 18th,
and on the 19th three companies of the regiment, under Major English, were sent to the Navigation
Colliery in order to bring away large quantities of mealie bags stored there.

Colonel Cooper, commanding the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, had been given an extension
of his command, and was hurrying back from a short period of leave in England, so the battalion
was at this time under the command of Major S. G. Bird.

It was now evident to every one that we were on the eve of hostilities, and a spirit of keen
excitement and anticipation ran through all ranks. After a long tour of foreign service, during
which the regiment had not had the good fortune to see active service, though on three occasions
they had been within measurable distance of it, they were now to have the long-wished-for chance
of showing that, in spite of altered denominations and other changes, they were prepared to
keep their gallant and historical reputation untarnished. Our advanced patrols had already
seen the first signs of the coming torrent of invasion, and one and all were seized with that
feeling, common to all mankind, of longing to get the waiting and the preparation over, and
to commence the real business for which they had been so carefully and so thoroughly prepared.
Full of the most implicit confidence in their brave leader, the regiment knew to a man that
they would soon be at hand-grips, and their two years' residence in the country and knowledge
of the history of the last Boer War, and the stain to be rubbed out, made every pulse tingle
with the desire to show that the past had been but an unfortunate blunder, and that the British
soldier of the present day was no whit inferior to his predecessors of Indian, Peninsular,
Waterloo, and Crimean fame.

On the night of the 19-20th October, Lieutenant Grimshaw was sent with a patrol of the Mounted
Infantry company of the battalion to watch the road to Vant's and Landsman's Drifts, ten miles
east of Dundee. About 2 a.m. on October 20th this officer reported that a Boer commando was
advancing on the town. At a later hour he forwarded a second message to the effect that he
was retiring before superior numbers, one man of his party having been wounded, and that the
enemy were in occupation of the hills to the east of the town. On the receipt of this message
General Penn-Symons ordered two companies of the Dublin Fusiliers to support Lieutenant Grimshaw.
'B' and 'E' companies, under Captains Dibley and Weldon, accordingly left camp at 4 a.m., and,
moving through the town, took up a position in Sand Spruit, which runs along the eastern edge
of Dundee. The whole brigade stood to arms, as usual, at 5 a.m., but was dismissed at 5.15
a.m. At about 5.30 a.m. the mist lifted, and everybody's gaze was directed on Talana Hill,
where numbers of men in black mackintoshes could be seen. The general impression was that they
were members of the town guard, but the arrival of the first shell soon dispelled this illusion.

Soon after 5.30 a.m. the Boer artillery opened fire on the camp. Their fire was accurate enough,
considering that the range was near 5400 yards, but the damage done was practically nothing,
as very few shells burst, and these only on impact. Our own artillery (13th and 69th Field
Batteries, with 'D' company of the battalion as escort) did not immediately respond, as they
were at the time engaged in watering their horses; but as soon as possible they were in position
to the east of the camp, and began to shell the crest of Talana Hill. They obtained the range
almost immediately, and in a short time overpowered the hostile guns, which were thus prevented
from playing an important part in the day's battle.
