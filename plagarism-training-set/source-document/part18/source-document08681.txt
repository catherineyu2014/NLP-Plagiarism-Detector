Plum-pudding never disagrees with me, however much I take of it. No more do mince-pies, no
matter how many I eat. Steaming hot-and-strong gin-punch is the most wholesome beverage; so,
also, is brandy-punch. It can't harm anybody who, on the Pickwickian principle, "takes enough
of it." Both beverages go admirably with cigars and pipes. If you have anything like a headache
on Boxing-day morning, depend upon it, it comes from abstemiousness in drinking, eating, and
smoking.

LITERARY AND DRAMATIC.--It is now generally known, and, if not, it is high time it should be,
that A Million of Money, advertised as original, is only an instance of genuine "translation"
from Old Drury Lane to Covent Garden, where it ought to continue its previous success.

SHAKSPEARE AT YULETIDE.--Excellent arrangements at the Lyceum for Christmas. Genial Ravenswood
is to be performed only on a Friday. For the rest,--no not "the rest" where so much work is
involved,--for "the remainder" of the week, the Master of the Shakespearian Revels gives us
Much Ado About Nothing, with our ELLEN and HENRY as Beatrice and Benedick, and with all its
memorable glory of costume and scenery,--a Shakspearian revival well worthy to be reckoned
as among the foremost of all the attractions offered by the theatres this Christmas.

"KEEP THE POT A-BOILING!"

(A SEASONABLE SUGGESTION.)

  Christmas comes once more,
    Well-beloved Old Father!
  Though the season's hoar,
    Warm his welcome--rather!
  Parties come and go,
    True to him our heart is,
  With his beard of snow,
    Best of (Christmas) Parties!
  Say the day is chill,
    Say the weather's windy,
  He brings warm good-will,
    Not heart-freezing shindy.
  "Union!" is his cry,--
    Hearts and hands and voices.
  Confraternity
    His kind soul rejoices.
  When the youngsters slide
    On the frozen river.
  As they glow and glide,
    Do they shrink or shiver?
  Nay; nor dread nor doubt
    Their brisk sport is spoiling,
  Gleefully they shout,
    "Keep the Pot a-boiling!"

  Keep it? Ay, by Jove!
    We are on our mettle.
  'Tis a game we love
    More than Pot and Kettle.
  Poorish sport that same,
    Angry mutual blackening.
  Here's a merrier game.
    Pull up there! Who's slackening?
  Not the leader, Punch!
    On he goes, amazing,
  To the rest his hunch
    Like a beacon blazing.
  Not Old Father X!
    How the Ancient goes it!
  'Tis a sight to vex
    Malice, and he knows it;
  Not young Master BULL!
    At the game he's handy,
  Nor has much the pull
    Of his pal, young SANDY;
  Not that dark-eyed girl
    With her cloak a-flying,
  She can swing and swirl
    With the boys. She's trying
  Everything she knows.
    As for Master PADDY,
  Whoop there! Down he goes!
    Bumped a bit, poor laddy!
  What then? At this game
    Who would be a stopper
  Just because he came
    Now and then a cropper?
  Up and on once more,
    Chance by courage foiling!
  Hark the jovial roar!
    "Keep the Pot a-boiling!"

  Father Christmas, hail!
    Sure 'tis flagrant folly
  Now to rave and rail.
    Truce--beneath your holly!
  Darkest England waits
    Care Co-operative;
  Mood that moat elates
    Is to-day--the dative!
  You need not doubt,
    You're no "Grecian" giver.
  Many "cold without,"
    Foodless, hopeless, shiver;
  Many a poor man's pot,
    Even at your season,
  With no pudding hot
    Bubbles. Is't not treason
  Unto more than kings
    To waste time in fighting
  Whilst such crooked things
    Stand in need of righting?
  In the name of those
    Starving, suffering, toiling,
  Let our quarrels close--
    "Keep the Pot a-boiling!"
