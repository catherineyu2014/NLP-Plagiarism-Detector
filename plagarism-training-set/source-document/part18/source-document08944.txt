PREFACE.

The subject of this book died one hundred years ago. Within his forty years of life, he discovered
a very large area of what is now an important region of the earth; he participated in stirring
events which are memorable in modern history; he applied a vigorous and original mind to the
advancement of knowledge, with useful results; and he was the victim of circumstances which,
however stated, were peculiarly unfortunate, and must evoke the sympathy of everyone who takes
the trouble to understand them. His career was crowded with adventures: war, perilous voyages,
explorations of unknown coasts, encounters with savages, shipwreck and imprisonment are the
elements which go to make up his story. He was, withal, a downright Englishman of exceptionally
high character, proud of his service and unsparing of himself in the pursuit of his duty.

Yet up to this time his biography has not been written. There are, it is true, outlines of
his career in various works of reference, notably that contributed by Sir J.K. Laughton to
the Dictionary of National Biography. But there is no book to which a reader can turn for a
fairly full account of his achievements, and an estimate of his personality. Of all discoverers
of leading rank Matthew Flinders is the only one about whom there is no ample and convenient
record.

This book endeavours to fill the gap.

The material upon which it is founded is set forth in the footnotes and the bibliography. Here
the author takes pleasure in acknowledging the assistance he has received from several quarters.
A previous book brought him the acquaintance of the grand-nephew of that Comte de Fleurieu
who largely inspired three famous French voyages to Australia--those of Laperouse, Dentrecasteaux
and Baudin--all of which have an important bearing upon the subject. The Comte A. de Fleurieu
had long been engaged in collecting material relative to the work and influence of his distinguished
grand-uncle, and in the most generous manner he handed over to the author his very large collection
of manuscripts and note-books to be read, noted, and used at discretion. Even when a historian
does not actually quote or directly use matter bearing upon his subject, it is of immense advantage
to have access to documents which throw light upon it, and which enable an in-and-out knowledge
of a period and persons to be obtained. This book owes much of whatever value it may possess
to monsieur de Fleurieu's assistance in this respect, and the author thanks him most warmly.

The Flinders papers, of which free use has been made, were presented to the Melbourne Public
Library by Professor W.M. Flinders Petrie. They are described in the bibliography. The transcripts
of family and personal documents were especially valuable. Although they were not supplied
for this book, Professor Flinders Petrie gave them in order that they might be of use to some
biographer of his grandfather, and the author begs to thank him, and also Mr. E La Touche Armstrong,
the chief librarian, in whose custody they are, and who has given frequent access to them.

The rich stores of manuscripts in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, have been thoroughly examined,
with the assistance of Mr. W.H. Ifould, principal librarian, Mr. Hugh Wright, and the staff
of that institution. Help from this quarter was accorded with such grace that one came to think
giving trouble was almost like conferring a favour.

All copies of documents from Paris and Caen cited in this book have been made by Madame Robert
Helouis. The author was able to indicate the whereabouts of the principal papers, but Madame
Helouis, developing an interest in the subject as she pursued her task, was enabled, owing
to her extensive knowledge of the resources of the French archives, to find and transcribe
many new and valuable papers. The author also wishes to thank Captain Francis Bayldon, of Sydney,
who has kindly given help on several technical points; Miss Alma Hansen, University of Melbourne,
who was generous enough to make a study of the Dutch Generale Beschrijvinge van Indien--no
light task--to verify a point of some importance for the purpose of the chapter on "The Naming
of Australia"; and Mr. E.A. Petherick, whose manuscript bibliography, containing an immense
quantity of material, the fruit of a long life's labour, has always been cheerfully made available.

Professor Flinders Petrie has been kind enough to read and make some useful suggestions upon
the personal and family passages of the book, which has consequently benefited greatly.

The whole work has been read through by Mr. A.W. Jose, author of The History of Australasia,
whose criticism on a multitude of points, some minute, but all important, has been of the utmost
value. The help given by Mr. Jose has been more than friendly; it has been informed by a keen
enthusiasm for the subject, and great knowledge of the original authorities. The author's obligations
to him are gratefully acknowledged.

It is hoped that these pages will enable the reader to know Matthew Flinders the man, as well
as the navigator; for the study of the manuscript and printed material about him has convinced
the author that he was not only remarkable for what he did and endured, but for his own sake
as an Englishman of the very best type.

3. FACSIMILE OF LETTER TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS, 1794.

(Mitchell Library.)

H.M.S Bellerophon

Spithead March 20th 1794.

Sir Joseph,

Yesterdays Post brought me a Letter from Mr. Miles, in Answer to the one I wrote him for his
Power of Attorney, after I had the Honour of waiting upon you in the Country, at which Time
you were pleased to express a Desire to be informed when it should arrive; in Compliance with
which, I now take the Liberty of addressing you. It seems he has not sent the Power, but says
he enclosd something like one to you by which it appears he is not exactly acquainted with
the Business in Question, he tells me he has explained his Sense of the Matter in your Letter
and begd that the remaining Sum might be paid to Mr. Dixon or Mr. Lee, from whom he wishes
me to receive it. When I wrote for the Power, I explaind to him (as far as my Knowledge of
the Subject extended) the Necessity of his sending it, that he was to consider himself as employd
by Government, that it was from the Treasury his Salary was to be got and that they would require
some Authority for paying it to me--at present Sir, I am at a Loss how to proceed; whether
what he has sent will be sufficient, or whether it will still be necessary to get a regular
Power is what I must trespass upon your Generosity for a Knowledge of the doing which will
add to the Obligation your Goodness before conferd upon me; with a gratefull Sense of which
I beg leave to subscribe myself, Sir Joseph

your much obligd and

most humble Servant

Mattw. Flinders.

To Sir Jos Banks Bart.

1798

FEBRUARY SATURDAY 10 close round the rock. At 8, when off a rocky point on which are two eminences
of white stone in the form of oblique cones inclining inwards, we stood to the southward, and
off and on during the night, keeping the peak and high land of Cape Barren in sight, the wind,
from the westward. SUNDAY 11 At the following noon, the observed latitude was 40 degrees 41
1/2, Cape Barren bearing north-by-west. The wind being strong at west-south-west we continued
standing off and on, and lying to occasionally, till day light next morning, when we made sail
MONDAY 12 west-north-west for the south end of Clarkes Island, having the wind now at north
by east. A little to the westward of the rocky point, which has the inclining cones upon it,
lies an island, between which and the point, is a deep channel of between half and three-quarters
of a mile wide; and about the same distance to the westward of this island, is another of nearly
the same size: they are rather low and covered with brush and grass. Between these islands
and Clarkes Island, we observed two low islets, and two rocks above water, the latter not more
than three or four miles from us. To the southward also, we saw the land extending a great
distance; but the whole are better seen in the sketch.

About ten o'clock, the ebb tide was running with such violence, that although the schooner
was going one knot and a half through the water, yet by the land we were evidently going retrograde
almost as much, and towards the land withal: but the light air that remained enabled us to
draw the ???

New South Wales; Western Port, excepted. Notwithstanding this evident superiority, the vegetable
Mould, is frequently, of nor great depth, and is sometimes, (perhaps advantageously) mixed
with small quantities of sand.

The best of the soil, lies upon the sides of sloping hills, and in the broad vallies between
them. Some parts that are low and level, have a wet, peaty, surface, bounded by small tracts
of flowering heath and oderiferous plants, that perfume the air with the fragrance of their oils.

The Plants, retain in general, the air of those of New South Wales, while, they are in reality,
different. The rich & vivid colouring of the more northern flowers, and that soft & exquisite
graduation of their tints, for which they are so singularly distinguished, hold with them here,
but in a less eminent degree. The two countries present a perfect similarity in this, that
the more barren spots are the most adorned.

Except in these useless places, the grass does not grow in tufts, but covers the land equally,
with a short, nutritious herbage, better adapted possibly, to the bite of small, than of large
cattle. The food for the latter, is grown in the bottoms of the vallies & upon the damp flats.
A large proportion of the soil, promises a fair return, for the labours of the cultivator,
and a smaller, insures an ample reward: but the greater part, would perhaps turn to more advantage,
if left for pasturage, than if thrown into cultivation; it would be rich as the one, but poor
as the other. Water is found in runs, more than in Ponds, and the not

To his Excellency the

Minister of the marine and colonies

of France.

The memorial of Matthew Flinders Esq.

Prisoner in the Isle of France.

May it please Your Excellency

Your memorialist was commander of His Britannic Majesty's ship the Investigator, despatched
by the Admiralty of England to complete the discovery of New Holland and New South Wales, which
had been begun by the early Dutch navigators, and continued at different periods by Cook, D'Entrecasteaux,
Vancouver, and your memorialist. He was furnished with a passport by order of His Imperial
and Royal Majesty, then first Consul of France; and signed by the marine minister Forfait the
4th Prarial, year 9; which passport permitted the Investigator to touch at French ports in
any part of the world, in cases of distress, and promised assistance and protection to the
commander and company, provided they should not have unnecessarily deviated from their route,
or have done, or announced the intention of doing any thing injurious to the French nation
or its allies: Your memorialist sailed from England in July 1801, and in April 1802, whilst
pursuing the discovery of the unknown part of the south coast of New South Wales, he met with
the commandant Baudin, who being furnished with a passport by the Admiralty of Great Britain,
had been sent by the French government with the ships Geographe and Naturaliste upon a nearly
similar expedition some months before. From Port Jackson, where the commandant was again met
with, your memorialist, accompanied by the brig Lady Nelson, continued his examinations and
discoveries northward, through many difficulties and dangers, but with success, until December
1802, when, in the Gulf of Carpentaria

from the general's conduct, that he has sought to impose upon him, and this for the purpose,
perhaps for the pleasure, of prolonging to the utmost my unjust detention.

But if apprehensions for the safety of this land are not the cause of the order of the French
government remaining unexecuted, what reason can there be, sufficiently strong to have induced
the captain-general to incur the risk of misobedience, first to the passport, and afterwards
to the order for my liberation. This I shall endeavour to explain in the following and last
chapter of this discussion; promising, however, that what I shall have to offer upon this part
of the subject, can only be what a consideration of the captain-general's conduct has furnished
me, as being the most probable. I am not conscious of having omitted any material circumstance,
either here or in the narration, or of having misrepresented any; as if after an attentive
perusal, the reader thinks my explanation not borne out by the facts, I submit it to his judgment
to deduce a better; and should esteem myself obliged by his making it public, so that it may
reach so far as even to me.
