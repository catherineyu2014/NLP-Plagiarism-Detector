A DICTIONARY of ARCHAIC and PROVINCIAL WORDS, Obsolete Phrases, Proverbs, and Ancient Customs,
from the Reign of Edward I. by JAMES ORCHARD HALLIWELL, F.R.S.F.S.A. &c.

It contains above 50,000 Words (embodying all the known scattered glossaries of the English
Language), forming a complete key to the reader of the works of our old Poets, Dramatists,
Theologians, and other authors whose works abound with allusions, of which explanations are
not to be found in ordinary dictionaries and books of reference. Most of the principal Archaisms
are illustrated by examples selected from early inedited MSS, and rare books, and by far the
greater portion will be found to be original authorities.

ANGLO-SAXON.--A DELECTUS in ANGLO-SAXON, intended as a First Class-book in the Language. By
the Rev. W. BARNES, of St. John's College, Cambridge, Author of the Poems and Glossary in the
Dorset Dialect. 12mo. cloth, 2s. 6d.

"To those who wish to possess a critical knowledge of their own native English, some acquaintance
with Anglo-Saxon is indispensable; and we have never seen an introduction better calculated
than the present to supply the wants of a beginner in a short space of time. The declensions
and conjugations are well stated, and illustrated by references to the Greek, Latin, French,
and other languages. A philosophical spirit pervades every part. The Delectus consists of Short
pieces, on various subjects, with extracts from Anglo-Saxon History and the Saxon Chronicle.
There is a good glossary at the end."--Athenæum, Oct. 20. 1849.

ANGLO-SAXON.--GUIDE to the ANGLO-SAXON TONGUE; with Lessons in Verse and Prose. For the use

D.D. F.R.S. &c. In 8vo. closely printed in treble columns, cloth, 12s.

remodelled and enlarged, bringing it down to the present state of Anglo-Saxon literature, both
at home and abroad.

HOLBEIN'S DANCE of DEATH; with an Historical and Literary Introduction by an Antiquary. Square
post 8vo., with 54 Engravings, being the most accurate copies ever executed of these gems of
art, and a Frontispiece of an Ancient Bedstead at Aix-la-Chapelle, with a Dance of Death carved

truthful."--Athenæum.

ENGLISH SURNAMES: an Essay on Family Nomenclature, Historical, Etymological, and Humorous.
By MARK ANTONY-LOWER, M.A. Third Edition, enlarged, 2 vols. post 8v., cloth, 12s.

This new and much improved edition, besides a great enlargement of the chapters contained in
the previous editions, comprises several that are entirely new, together with Notes on Scottish,
Irish, and Norman Surnames. The "Additional Prolusions," besides the articles on Rebuses, Allusive
Arms, and the Roll of Battel Abbey, contain Dissertations on Inn Signs, and Remarks on Christian
Names; with a copious Index of many thousand names. These features render "English Surnames"
rather a new work than a new edition.

HERALD'S VISITATIONS.--An Index to all the Pedigrees and Arms in the Heraldic Visitations and
other Genealogical MSS. in the British Museum. By G. SIMS, of the Manuscript Department. 8vo.,
closely printed in double columns, cloth, 15s.

An indispensable book to those engaged in genealogical or topographical pursuits, affording
a ready clue to the pedigrees and arms of above 30,000 of the gentry of England, their residences,
&c. (distinguishing the different families of the same name in every county), as recorded by
the Heralds in their Visitations, with Indexes to other genealogical MSS. in the British Museum.
It has been the work of immense labour. No public library ought to be without it. 15s., cloth.

"One of the first wants of an incipient antiquary is the facility of comparison, and here it
is furnished him at one glance. The places, indeed, form the most valuable part of the book,
both by their number and the judicious selection of types and examples which they contain.
It is a book which we can, on this account, safely and warmly recommend to all who are interested
in the antiquities of their native land."--Literary Gazette.

"A book of such utility--so concise, so clear, so well condensed from such varied and voluminous
sources, cannot fail to be generally acceptable."--Art-Union.
