In the next group of experiments, the subject was required to execute a series of reactions
in groups of alternating content, the first to contain two uniform beats, the second to consist
of a single reaction. This second beat with the interval following it constitutes a measure
which was to be made rhythmically equivalent to the two-beat group with which it alternated.
The time-relations of the series were therefore left to the adjustment of the reactor. The
intensive relations were separated into two groups; in the first the final reaction was to
be kept uniform in strength with those of the preceding group, in the second it was to be accented.

The absolute and relative intensive values for the two forms are given in the following table:

TABLE XXVI.

  Rhythm.              1st Beat.  2d Beat.  3d Beat.  Value.

  Syncopated Measures      13.00     15.12     16.50  Absolute.
  Unaccented,               1.000     1.175     1.269 Relative.

  Syncopated Measures      10.95     11.82     16.11  Absolute.
  Accented,                 1.000     1.079     1.471 Relative.

These averages hold for every individual record, and therefore represent a thoroughly established
type. In both forms the reaction of the syncopated measure receives the greatest stress. In
the first form, while the stress is relatively less than in the second, it is at the same time
absolutely greater. The whole set of values is raised (the ratio of average intensities in
the two forms being 1.147:1.000), as it has already been found to be raised in other forms
difficult to execute. To this cause the preponderance is undoubtedly to be attributed, as the
reports of every subject describe this form as unnatural, in consequence of the restraint it
imposes on an impulse to accent the final reaction, i.e., the syncopated measure.

In the next set of experiments the series of reactions involved the alternation of a syncopated
measure consisting of a single beat with a full measure of three beats. The same discrimination
into accented and unaccented forms in the final measure was made as in the preceding group.
The series of absolute and relative values are given in the following table.

TABLE XXVII.

  Rhythm.            1st Beat.  2d Beat.  3rd Beat.  4th Beat.  Value.

  Syncopated Measures   9.77      8.96       9.61      13.78   Absolute.
  Unaccented,           1.000     0.915      0.983      1.165  Relative.

  Syncopated Measures  11.57     11.07      11.53      21.50   Absolute.
  Accented,             1.000     0.957      0.996      1.858  Relative.

These averages hold for every subject where the syncopated measure receives accentuation, and
for two out of three reactors where it is unaccented. The latter individual variation shows
a progressive increase in intensity throughout the series.

Here, as in the preceding forms, a well-established type is presented. Not only when accentuation
is consciously introduced, but also when the attempt is made--and in so far as the introspection
of the reactor goes, successfully made--to maintain a uniformity among the reactions of the
full and syncopated measures, the emphasis on the latter is unconsciously increased. In the
accented form, as before, there is a clear discrimination into two grades of intensity (ratio
of first three elements to final, 1.000:1.888) while in the unaccented no such broad separation
exists (ratio of first three elements to final, 1.000:1.156).

The type of succession in each of these forms of reaction is a transformed dactylic, in which
group should now be included the simple four-beat rhythm with final accent, which was found
to follow the same curve. The group begins with a minor stress in both of the present forms,
this stress being greater in the unaccented than in the accented type. This preponderance I
believe to be due to the endeavor to repress the natural accent on the syncopated measure.
In both forms the intensive value of the second element is less than that of the third, while
the intensity of the initial reaction is greater than that of either of these subsequent beats.
This form of succession I have called a transformed dactylic. It adheres to the dactylic type
in possessing initial accentuation; it departs from the normal dactylic succession in inverting
the values of the second and third members of the group. This inversion is not inherent in
the rhythmic type. The series of three beats decreasing in intensity represents the natural
dactylic; the distortion actually presented is the result of the proximity of each of these
groups to a syncopated measure which follows it. This influence I believe to be reducible to
more elementary terms. The syncopated measure is used to mark the close of a logical sequence,
or to attract the hearer's attention to a striking thought. In both cases it is introduced
at significant points in the rhythmical series and represents natural nodes of accentuation.
The distortion of adjacent measures is to be attributed to the increase in this elementary
factor of stress, rather than to the secondary significance of the syncopation, for apart from
any such change in the rhythmical structure we have found that the reactions adjacent to that
which receives accentual stress are drawn toward it and increased in relative intensity.

Further quantitative analysis of rhythmical sequences, involving a comparison of the forms
of successive measures throughout the higher syntheses of verse, couplet and stanza, will,
I believe, confirm this conception of the mutable character of the relations existing between
the elements of the rhythmical unit, and the dependence of their quantitative values on fixed
points and modes of structural change occurring within the series. An unbroken sequence of
dactyls we shall expect to find composed of forms in which a progressive decrease of intensity
is presented from beginning to end of the series (unless we should conceive the whole succession
of elements in a verse to take shape in dependence on the point of finality toward which it
is directed); and when, at any point, a syncopated measure is introduced we shall look for
a distortion of this natural form, at least in the case of the immediately preceding measure,
by an inversion of the relative values of the second and third elements of the group. This
inversion will unquestionably be found to affect the temporal as well as the intensive relations
of the unit. We should likewise expect the relations of accented and unaccented elements in
the two-beat rhythms to be similarly affected by the occurrence of syncopated measures, and
indeed to find that their influence penetrates every order of rhythm and extends to all degrees
of synthesis.

To the quantitative analysis of the intensive relations presented by beaten rhythms must be
added the evidence afforded by the apprehension of auditory types. When a series of sounds
temporally and qualitatively uniform was given by making and breaking an electric circuit in
connection with a telephone receiver, the members of a group of six observers without exception
rhythmized the stimuli in groups--of two, three and four elements according to rate of succession--having
initial accentuation, however frequently the series was repeated. When the series of intervals
was temporally differentiated so that every alternate interval, in one case, and every third
in another, stood to the remaining interval or intervals in the ratio, 2:1, the members of
this same group as uniformly rhythmized the material in measures having final accentuation.
In triple groups the amphibrachic form (in regard to temporal relations only, as no accentuation
was introduced) was never heard under natural conditions. When the beginning of the series
was made to coincide with the initiation of an amphibrachic group, four of those taking part
in the investigation succeeded in maintaining this form of apprehension for a time, all but
one losing it in the dactylic after a few repetitions; while the remaining two members were
unable to hold the amphibrachic form in consciousness at all.

(b) The Distribution of Durations.

The inquiry concerning this topic took the direction, first, of a series of experiments on
the influence which the introduction of a louder sound into a series otherwise intensively
uniform exerts on the apparent form of the series within which it occurs. Such a group of experiments
forms the natural preliminary to an investigation of the relation of accentuation to the form
of the rhythm group. The apparatus employed was the fourth in the series already described.
The sounds which composed the series were six in number; of these, five were produced by the
fall of the hammer through a distance of 2/8 inch; the sixth, louder sound, by a fall through
7/8 inch. In those cases in which the intensity of this louder sound was itself varied there
was added a third height of fall of two inches. The succession of sounds was given, in different
experiments, at rates of 2.5, 2.2, and 1.8 sec. for the whole series. The durations of the
intervals following and (in one or two cases) preceding the louder sound were changed; all
the others remained constant. A longer interval intervened between the close and beginning
of the series than between pairs of successive sounds. After hearing the series the subject
reported the relations which appeared to him to obtain among its successive elements. As a
single hearing very commonly produced but a confused impression, due to what was reported as
a condition of unpreparedness which made it impossible for the hearer to form any distinct
judgment of such relations, and so defeated the object of the experiment, the method adopted
was to repeat each series before asking for judgment. The first succession of sounds then formed
both a signal for the appearance of the second repetition and a reinforcement of the apperception
of its material.

In order to define the direction of attention on the part of the observer it was made known
that the factors to be compared were the durations of the intervals adjacent to the louder
sound in relation to the remaining intervals of the series, and that all other temporal and
intensive values were maintained unchanged from experiment to experiment. In no instance, on
the other hand, did any subject know the direction or nature of the variation in those quantities
concerning which he was to give judgment. In all, five subjects shared in the investigation,
C., E., F., H. and N. Of these C only had musical training. In the tables and diagrams the
interval preceding the louder sound is indicated by the letter B, that following it by the
letter A. Totals--judgment or errors--are indicated by the letter T, and errors by the letter
E. The sign '+' indicates that the interval against which it stands is judged to be greater
than the remaining intervals of the series, the sign '=' that it is judged equal, and the sign
'-' that it is judged less.

The first series of changes consisted in the introduction of variations in the duration of
the interval following the loud sound, in the form of successive increments. This loud sound
was at the third position in the series. All intensive relations and the duration of the interval
preceding the louder sound remained unchanged. The results of the experiment are presented
in the following table.

The value of the interval following the louder sound is correctly reported eight times out
of thirty; that preceding it is correctly reported sixteen times out of thirty. The influence
which such a change in intensive value introduced at a single point in a series of sounds exerts
on the apparent relation of its adjacent intervals to those of the remainder of the series
is not equally distributed between that which precedes and that which follows it, but affects
the latter more frequently than the former in a ratio (allowing latitude for future correction)
of 2:1. In the case of interval A the error is one of underestimation in twenty-seven cases;
in none is it an error of overestimation. In the case of interval B the error is one of overestimation
in seventeen instances, of underestimation in two. The influence of the introduction of such
a louder sound, therefore, is to cause a decrease in the apparent duration of the interval
which follows it, and an increase in that of the interval which precedes it. The illusion is
more pronounced and invariable in the case of the interval following the louder sound than
of that preceding it, the proportion of such characteristic misinterpretations to the whole
number of judgments in the two cases being, for A, 77 per cent.; for B, 54 per cent. The effect
on interval A is very strong. In the second group, where the ratio of this interval to the
others of the series is 3:2, it is still judged to be equal to these others in 50 per cent.
of the cases, and less in 35 per cent. Further, these figures do not give exhaustive expression
to the whole number of errors which may be represented in the judgments recorded, since no
account is taken of greater and less but only of change of sign; and an interval might be underestimated
and still be reported greater than the remaining intervals of the series in a group of experiments
in which the relation of the interval in question to these remaining intervals ranged from
the neighborhood of equivalent values to that in which one was double the other. If in a rough
way a quantitative valuation of errors be introduced by making a transference from any one
sign to that adjacent to it (e.g., - to =, or = to +) equal to one, and that from one extreme
sign to the other equal to two, the difference in the influence exerted on the two intervals
will become still more evident, since the errors will then have the total (quantitative) values
of A 46, and B 19, or ratio of 1.000:0.413.

Next, the position of the louder sound in the series of six was changed, all other conditions
being maintained uniform throughout the set of experiments. The series of intervals bore the
following relative values: A, 0.900; B, 1.100; all other intervals, 1.000. The louder sound
was produced by a fall of 0.875 inch; all others by a fall of 0.250 inch. The louder sound
occurred successively in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth positions of the series.
In the first of these forms it must of course be remembered that no interval B exists. The
results of the experiment are shown in the following table:

  Total judgments, 113; Errors (B = 31), A = 57.

The relatively meager results set forth in the preceding section are corroborated in the present
set of experiments. That such a variation of intensity introduced into an otherwise undifferentiated
auditory series, while it affects the time-values of both preceding and following intervals,
has a much greater influence on the latter than on the former, is as apparent here as in the
previous test. The number of errors, irrespective of extent, for the two intervals are: B,
82.3 per cent, of total judgments; A, 90.7 per cent. When the mean and extreme sign displacements
are estimated on the quantitative basis given above these percentages become B, 64.5; A, 90.7,
respectively--a ratio of 0.711:1.000.

The direction of error, likewise, is the same as in the preceding section. Since the actual
values of the two intervals here are throughout of extreme sign--one always greater, the other
always less--only errors which lie in a single direction are discriminable. Illusions lying
in this direction will be clearly exhibited, since the differences of interval introduced are
in every case above the threshold of discrimination when the disturbing element of variations
in intensity has been removed and the series of sounds made intensively uniform. In case of
a tendency to underestimate B or overestimate A, errors would not be shown. This problem, however,
is not to be met here, as the results show; for there is recorded a proportion of 82.3 per
cent. of errors in judgment of interval B, and of 90.7 per cent. in judgment of interval A,
all the former being errors of overestimation, all of the latter of underestimation.

The influence of position in the series on the effect exerted by such a change of intensity
in a single member can be stated only tentatively. The number of experiments with the louder
sound in position five was smaller than in the other cases, and the relation which there appears
cannot be absolutely maintained. It may be also that the number of intervals following that
concerning which judgment is to be given, and with which that interval may be compared, has
an influence on the accuracy of the judgment made. If we abstract from this last set of results,
the tendency which appears is toward an increase in accuracy of perception of comparative durations
from the beginning to the end of the series, a tendency which appears more markedly in the
relations of the interval preceding the louder sound than in those of the interval which follows
it. This conclusion is based on the succession of values which the proportion of errors to
total judgments presents, as in the annexed table.

Next, the relation of the amount of increase in intensity introduced at a single position in
such a series to the amount of error thereby occasioned in the apprehension of the adjacent
intervals was taken up. Two sets of experiments were carried out, in each of which five of
the sounds were of equal intensity, while one, occurring in the midst of the series, was louder;
but in one of the sets this louder sound was occasioned by a fall of the hammer through a distance
of 0.875 inch, while in the other the distance traversed was 2.00 inches. In both cases the
extent of fall in the remaining hammers was uniformly 0.25 inch. The results are given in the
following table:

   ¹Interval B in these experiments is of the same duration as all
   others but that following the louder sound; hence, judgments in
   the second column are correct.

Again the markedly greater influence of increased intensity on the interval following than
on that preceding it appears, the percentage of errors being, for B (both intensities), 21.6
per cent.; for A, 56.6 per cent. Also, in these latter experiments the direction of error is
more definite in the case of interval A than in that of interval B.

The influence of changes in intensity on the amount of error produced is striking. Two intensities
only were used for comparison, but the results of subsequent work in various other aspects
of the general investigation show that this correlation holds for all ranges of intensities
tested, and that the amount of underestimation of the interval following a louder sound introduced
into an otherwise uniform series is a function of the excess of the former over the latter.
The law holds, but not with equal rigor, of the interval preceding the louder sound. So far
as these records go, the influence of such an increase of intensity is more marked in the case
of interval B than in that of interval A. It is to be noted, however, that the absolute percentage
of errors in the case of A is several times greater than in that of B. I conclude that A is
much more sensitive than B to such influences, and that there is here presented, in passing
from intensity I. to intensity II., the rise of conditions under which the influence of the
louder sound on B is first distinctly felt--that is, the appearance of a threshold--and that
the rate of change manifested might not hold for higher intensities.

Lastly, the rate at which the sounds of the series succeeded one another was varied, in order
to determine the relation which the amount of influence exerted bore to the absolute value
of the intervals which it affected. Three rates were adopted, the whole series of sounds occupying
respectively 2.50 secs., 2.20 secs, and 1.80 secs. The results are summed in the following table:

In the case of interval A the direction of the curve of error changes in passing from Rate
II. to Rate III. In the case of interval B the increase is continuous.

This increase in the percentage of error is, further, distinctly in the direction of an accentuation
of the overestimation of the interval B, as is shown in the percentage of cases in which this
interval appeared greater than the rest of the series for each of the three rates.

If the three rates be combined in the one set of results, the difference in the effects produced
on the interval following the louder sound and on that which precedes it becomes again apparent.
This is done in the table below.

The overestimation of the interval before the louder sound also tends to increase in extent
with the actual increase in duration of the interval following that sound over the other intervals
of the series.

Thus, the form which the sensible time-relations of such a limited series of sounds present
is found to be intimately dependent on the intensive preponderance of certain elements within
it, on the degree of increased stress which such elements receive, on their local position
in the series, and on the rate at which the stimulations succeed one another. The knowledge
of these facts prepares us for the whole series of relations manifested in the special quantitative
investigations reported in the sections which follow. In the first of these is presented the
time-relations obtaining among the successive reactions of the various rhythm types discussed
in the preceding division of this part, the section, namely, on the distribution of intensities.

In the first group of reactions the series was not to be consciously accented, nor to be divided
into groups by the introduction of pauses. The reactor was required only to conceive it as
a succession of two-beat groups continuously repeated, the way in which the groups should be
defined, whether by counting or otherwise, being left to his own discretion. The experimental
group was composed of five subjects.

The following table presents the quantitative results of an analysis of the material in series
of ten successive pairs of reactions, upon the basis of unity as the value of the first element.

TABLE XXXV.

  Quantities.       I    II    III   IV     V    VI    VII  VIII   IX    X

Within the limits of the calculation no progressive change appears, either of acceleration
or of retardation, whether in general or on the part of individual reactors. In narrower ranges
the inconstancy of the periods is very marked, and their variations of clearly defined rhythmical
character. The duration of the total measures of two beats is throughout alternately longer
and shorter, the average of their values presenting a ratio of 1.000:0.847. The order of this
arrangement, namely, that the longer period precedes the shorter in the larger group, is drawn
from the fact that measurements consistently began with the initial reaction of the series.

An analysis of the constituent intervals of the unit group, as shown in the second and third
lines of the table, reveals the existence of a complex subordinate rhythm. The two components
of the rhythmical group do not increase and decrease concomitantly in temporal value in composing
the alternate long and short measures of the fluent rhythm. The movement involves a double
compensating rhythmical change, in which the two elements are simultaneously in opposite phases
to each other. A measure which presents a major first interval contains always a minor second;
one introduced by a minor first concludes with a major second. The ratios of these two series
of periodic variations must themselves manifestly be different. Their values are, for the first
interval of the measure, 1.000:1.214; and for the second interval, 1.000:0.764. The greater
rhythmical differentiation marks the second of the two intervals; on the variations of this
second interval, therefore, depends the appearance of that larger rhythm which characterizes
the series. The ratios of these primary intervals are less consistently maintained than are
those of the rhythmical measures built out of them. It will be noted that in both intervals
there is a tendency for the value of the difference between those of alternate groups to increase
as the tapping progresses. This change I have interpreted as indicative of a progressive definition
in the process of rhythmization, depending on an increase in coördination and differentiation
of the reactions as the series advances.

A simple stress on alternate elements was next introduced in the series, forming a simple trochaic
measure repeated without interruption. The quantitative results follow, arranged as in the
preceding experiment.

TABLE XXXVI.

  Quantity.    I    II    III   IV     V    VI    VII  VIII   IX    X
  Measure,  1.000 1.035 1.070 1.035 1.087 1.070 1.071 1.052 1.070 1.070

Here again there is no progressive acceleration or retardation. The rhythmical differentiation
of alternate measures is very slight--the average ratio of the first to the second being 1.000:0.993--but
is of the same type as in the preceding. The excess in the amount of this differentiation presented
by the first type of reaction over the second may be due to the presence of a tendency to impart
rhythmical character to such a series of reactions, which, prohibited in one form--the intensive
accent--finds expression through the substitution for this of a temporal form of differentiation.

In this trochaic rhythm the phases of variation in the constituent intervals of the measure
are concomitant, and their indices of differentiation almost identical with each other. Their
values are, for the first, 1.000:0.979; and for the second, 1.000:0.995. The higher index is
that of the first interval, that, namely, which follows the accented beat of the measure, and
indicates that the rhythmical change is due chiefly to a differentiation in the element which
receives the stress.

In iambic measures similarly beaten out there is likewise no acceleration nor retardation apparent
in the progress of the tapping. The temporal differentiation of alternate measures is of the
same extent as in the preceding group, namely, 1.000:0.991. the proportional quantitative values
of the measure and its constituent intervals, taken in series of ten successive repetitions,
are as follow:

TABLE XXXVII. That is, the greater index of instability again attaches to that element which
receives the stress. Though this holds true throughout these experiments, the amount of difference
here is misleading, since on account of the smaller absolute value of the first interval the
proportional amount of change within it which passes unrecorded is greater than in the case
of the second interval.

In general, the larger temporal variations of the trochaic and iambic rhythm forms are too
slight to be significant when taken individually. The evidence of rhythmical treatment in such
a series of reactions, which is strongly marked in the unaccented form, nevertheless receives
reinforcement from these inconsiderable but harmonious results.

The proportional values of the variations in alternate measures for accented and unaccented
elements are given in the following table, in which the figures for the trochaic and iambic
forms are combined:

TABLE XXXVIII.

  Interval     I    II    III   IV    V     VI    VII  VIII   IX    X

It is perhaps worthy of note that in this table a still higher rhythmical synthesis of regular
form appears in the accented elements if the figures be taken in series of four consecutive
pairs of reactions.

In the group of triple rhythms next taken up--the dactylic, the amphibrachic and the anapæstic--each
type presents an increase in the duration of the unit group between the beginning and end of
the series, but without any regular curve connecting these terms. Neither the average results
nor those of the individual subjects show anywhere a decrease of duration in the progress of
the tapping. The proportional results for each of the three rhythm forms, and their averages,
are given in the following table.

TABLE XXXIX.

When all types and subjects are thus combined the summation of these inconstant retardations
presents sharply differentiated terms and a curve uninverted at any point.

A separate analysis of the components of the rhythmical group shows, for the dactylic form,
an important increase in duration in only one of the three intervals, namely, that following
the element which receives accentual stress. The proportional values for these intervals follow.

TABLE XL. In such a case, if the increase in duration be confined to a single element and parallel
the changes in a simultaneous variant of a different order, we should regard them as functionally
connected, and therefore interpret the successively greater periods of time occupied by the
rhythmical measures as constituting no real slowing of the tempo. The measure of relative tempo
in such a case consists in the ratios of the successive durations of the rhythmical units after
the subtraction of that element of increase due to this extraneous source. Here, since the
increase is confined to that member of the group which receives accentual stress, and since
the increase of accentuation is typically accompanied by an extension of the following interval,
the changes presented do fulfil the conditions of a progressively increased accentuation of
the rhythm group, and to this origin I think it is undoubtedly to be attributed. It is to be
noted that the final interval also undergoes a slight increase, while the median suffers a
similarly slight decrease in duration as the series progresses.

In the amphibrachic form the changes manifested by the constituents of the unit group are more
obscure. No progressive retardation of the accented element is apparent. In the initial and
final intervals the difference in duration between the first and last members of the series
is small and appears early in the process. If we assume the general application of the laws
of change presented in the preceding section, there should be here two influences concerned
in the determination of the relations presented, the factors, namely, of position and accent.
The falling of the accentual stress on the median interval eliminates one of the two factors
of progressive reduction in that element and replaces it by a factor of increase, thereby doing
away with the curve of change; while at the same time it decreases the changes which occur
in the bounding intervals of the group by removing the accent from the first and by the proximate
position of its own accent tending to reduce the last interval.

Under this same assumption there should be expected in the anapæstic form of rhythm an exaggeration
of the progressive increase in the final interval, together with a further reduction in the
duration of the initial; since from the falling of the accent on the final interval two factors
of increase combine, while in the initial, which immediately follows the accented interval
in the series, a positive factor of reduction appears. This is actually the type of change
presented by the quantitative relations, which are given as proportional values in the following
table.

TABLE XLI. The figures annexed give these averages as proportions of the first interval in
the series.

The relations of the various intervals in the three forms are put together here for comparison:

  Anapæstic,      1.000 : 1.050     1.000 : 1.000     1.000 : 1.146

An analysis of the factors of accentual stress and of position in the rhythmical group in isolation
from each other, confirms the assumptions already made as to their influence in defining the
form of the rhythmic unit. Table XLIV. exhibits the series of temporal changes taking place
in accented and unaccented intervals, respectively, for the three forms combined, and therefore
independent of position in the group.

TABLE XLIV. Both the intensive accentuation and the demarcation of successive groups thus appear
to be factors of definition in the rhythmic unit. Those types which are either marked by a
more forcible accent or separated by longer pauses are more distinctly apprehended and more
easily held together than those in which the accent is weaker or the pause relatively less.
It would follow that the general set of changes which these series of reactions present are
factors of a process of definition in the rhythmical treatment of the tapping, and are not
due to any progressive change in the elementary time relations of the series.

The figures for measures of four beats are incomplete. They show an increase in the average
duration of the group from first to last of the series in three out of the four forms, namely,
those having initial, secondary and final stress.

Of the relative amounts contributed by the several elements to the total progressive variation
of the measures in the first form, the least marks those intervals which follow unaccented
beats, the greatest those which follow accented beats; among the latter, that shows the greater
increase which receives the primary accent, that on which falls the secondary, subconscious
accent shows the less; and of the two subgroups which contain these accents that in which the
major accent occurs contributes much more largely to the progressive change than does that
which contains the minor.

When the phases of accented and unaccented elements are compared, irrespective of their position
in the rhythmic group, the same functional differences are found to exist as in the case of
triple rhythms. Their quantitative relations are given in the following table.

TABLE XLVI.

The contribution of the several intervals according to position in the series and irrespective
of accentual stress is given in the table following.

TABLE XLVII. The values of the minor pair are almost equal; of the major the third exceeds
the first. Under the assumption already made this would indicate the existence at these points
of nodes of natural accentuation, of which the second marks the maximum reached in the present
series.

The determination of relative time-values for accented and unaccented intervals was next sought
by indirect experimentation, in which the affective aspect of the experience was eliminated
from consideration, and account was taken only of the perception of quantitative variations
in the duration of the successive intervals. Proceeding from the well-known observation that
if every alternate element of a temporally uniform auditory series receive increased stress,
the whole series will coalesce into successive groups of two elements in which the louder sound
precedes and the weaker follows, while the interval which succeeds the unaccented sound, and
which therefore separates adjacent groups, will appear of greater duration than that which
follows the accented element, the investigation sought by employing the method of right and
wrong cases with a series of changing time-values for the two intervals to determine the quantitative
proportion of the two durations necessary to produce the impression of temporal uniformity
in the series.

Two rhythm forms only were tested, the trochaic and dactylic, since without an actual prolongation
of considerable value in the interval following the louder sound, at the outset, no apprehension
of the series as iambic or anapæstic could be brought about. The stimuli were given by mechanism
number 4, the distance of fall being 2/8 and 7/8 inch respectively for unaccented and accented
sounds. The series of changes included extreme proportional values of 0.714 and 1.769 in duration
of the two intervals. Six persons took part in the investigation. In the following table is
given the percentage of cases in which the interval following the unaccented element was judged
respectively greater than, equal to, or less than that which followed the accented element,
for each of the series of ratios presented by the time-values of the intervals in trochaic rhythm.

TABLE XLIX.

     1.000 : 1.400        22.0    "         56.0    "      22.0    "
     1.000 : 1.222        16.0    "         84.0    "
     1.000 : 1.118        26.0    "         74.0    "
     1.000 : 1.000        61.6    "         38.4    "
     1.000 : 0.895       100.0    "
     1.000 : 0.800        88.8    "         11.2    "
     1.000 : 0.714       100.0    "

The anomalous percentage which appears in the first horizontal row needs explanation. The limit
of possible differentiation in the time-values of accented and unaccented intervals in a rhythmical
group is characteristically manifested, not by the rise of a perception of the greater duration
of the interval following the accented element, but through an inversion of the rhythmical
figure, the original trochee disappearing and giving place to an iambic form of grouping, the
dactyl being replaced by an anapæst. In the case in question the inversion had taken place
for all subjects but one, in whom the original trochaic form, together with its typical distribution
of intervals, remained unchanged even with such a great actual disparity as is here involved.

For this group of observers and for the series of intensities taken account of in the present
experiment, the distribution of time-values necessary to support psychological uniformity lies
near to the ratio 1.400:1.000 for accented and unaccented intervals respectively, since here
the distribution of errors in judgment is arranged symmetrically about the indifference point.
Overestimation of the interval following the louder sound appears by no means invariable. Under
conditions of objective uniformity the judgment of equality was given in 38.4 per cent, of
all cases. This cannot be baldly interpreted as a persistence of the capacity for correct estimation
of the time values of the two intervals in the presence of an appreciation of the series as
a rhythmical group. The rhythmic integration of the stimuli is weakest when the intervals separating
them are uniform, and since the question asked of the observer was invariably as to the apparent
relative duration of the two intervals, it may well be conceived that the hearers lapsed from
a rhythmical apprehension of the stimuli in these cases, and regarded the successive intervals
in isolation from one another. The illusions of judgment which appear in these experiences
are essentially dependent on an apprehension of the series of sounds in the form of rhythmical
groups. So long as that attitude obtains it is absolutely impossible to make impartial comparison
of the duration of successive intervals. The group is a unit which cannot be analyzed while
it continues to be apprehended as part of a rhythmical sequence. We should expect to find,
were observation possible, a solution of continuity in the rhythmical apprehension in every
case in which these distortions of the normal rhythm form are forced on the attention. This
solution appears tardily. If the observer be required to estimate critically the values of
the successive intervals, the attention from the outset is turned away from the rhythmical
grouping and directed on each interval as it appears. When this attitude prevails very small
differences in duration are recognized (e.g., those of 1.000:1.118, and 1.000:0.895). But when
this is not the case, the changes of relative duration, if not too great for the limits of
adaptation, are absorbed by the rhythmical formula and pass unobserved, while variations which
overstep these limits appear in consciousness only as the emergence of a new rhythmic figure.
Such inversions are not wholly restricted by the necessity of maintaining the coincidence of
accentuation with objective stress. With the relatively great differences involved in the present
set of experiments, the rhythmical forms which appeared ignored often the objective accentuation
of single groups and of longer series. Thus, if the second interval of a dactyl were lengthened
the unaccented element which preceded it received accentuation, while the actual stress on
the first sound of the group passed unobserved; and in a complex series of twelve hammer-strokes
the whole system of accentuation might be transposed in the hearer's consciousness by variations
in the duration of certain intervals, or even by simple increase or decrease in the rate of
succession.[6]

   [6] Bolton found one subject apperceiving in four-beat groups a
   series of sounds in which increased stress fell only on every
   sixth.

In the experiments on dactylic rhythm the changes introduced affected the initial and final
intervals only, the one being diminished in proportion as the other was increased, so that
the total duration of the group remained constant. The figures, arranged as in the preceding
table, are given in Table L.

The percentage given in the case of the highest ratio is based on the reports of two subjects
only, one of them the exceptional observer commented on in connection with two-beat rhythms;
for all other participants the anapæstic form had already replaced the dactylic. The distribution
of values which supports psychological uniformity in this rhythmic figure lies between the
ratios 1.166, 1.000, 0.800, and 1.250, 1.000, 0.755, since in this region the proportion of
errors in judgment on either side becomes inverted. The two rhythmic forms, therefore, present
no important differences[7] in the relations which support psychological uniformity. A comparison
in detail of the distribution of judgments in the two cases reveals a higher percentage of
plus and minus, and a lower percentage of equality judgments throughout the changes of relation
in the dactylic form than in the trochaic. This appears to indicate a greater rhythmical integration
in the former case than in the latter. On the one hand, the illusion of isolation from adjacent
groups is greater at every point at which the intervening interval is actually reduced below
the value of either of the internal intervals in the dactylic than in the trochaic rhythm;
and on the other, the sensitiveness to differences in the whole series is less in the case
of the trochee than in that of the dactyl, if we may take the higher percentage of cases in
which no discrimination has been made in the former rhythm as a negative index of such sensibility.

   [7] The ratios of initial to final intervals in the two cases
   are, for trochaic measures, 1.400:1.000, and for dactylic,
   1.400(to 1.666):1.000.
    1.000 : 1.666        33.2    "        23.9    "        42.9    "
    1.000 : 1.400        39.0    "        46.0    "        15.0    "
    1.000 : 1.182        60.0    "        37.2    "         2.8    "
    1.000 : 1.000        85.4    "        12.2    "         2.4    "
    1.000 : 0.846        89.2    "        10.8    "
    1.000 : 0.714       100.0    "
    1.000 : 0.660        96.0    "         4.0    "

The increase in the number of inverted forms which occur is coördinated percentually in the
following table with the successive increments of difference between the accented and unaccented
intervals of the group:

TABLE LI.

  Rhythm.  2.428 2.000 1.769 1.666 1.571 1.400 1.222 1.182 1.118 1.000
  Trochaic,             93.7        74.0  44.2  25.0        25.0   2.9
  Datylic,  93.6  54.0        39.4        18.4

These figures are corroborative of the preceding conclusions. The dactylic figure is maintained
in the presence of much greater differences in the relative durations of accented and unaccented
intervals than is the trochaic. In the latter, inversions not only appear earlier in the series,
but become the (practically) exclusive mode of apprehension at a point where not fifty per
cent, of the dactyls have suffered transformation. At a certain definite stage in the process
the tendencies toward the two forms of apprehension balance each other, so that with the slightest
change in direction of attention the rhythmical figure inverts and reverts to the original
form indifferently. These points are defined, in the case of the two rhythms here reported
on, by the following (or intermediate) ratios: Trochaic-Iambic, (1.400-1.571): 1.000; Dactylic-Anapæstic,
(1.666-2.000): 1.000.

The temporal conditions of such equilibrium are a strict function of the degree of accentuation
which the rhythm group presents. The location of the indifference point must, therefore be
independently determined for each intensive value through which the accented element may pass.
Its changes are given for five such increments in the following table, in which the values
of the various intervals are represented as proportions of the absolute magnitudes which appear
in the first, or undifferentiated series.

IV. THE COMBINATION OF RHYTHMICAL GROUPS IN HIGHER SYNTHESES AND THEIR EQUIVALENCES.

In the elaboration of higher rhythmical forms the combination of formally identical groups
is rather the rule than the exception, since in poetical structures the definition of the metrical
form and the maintenance of its proper relations depend on a clear preponderance of its own
particular unit-type over local variants. In the experimental investigation of composite rhythm
forms the temporal relations of structures presenting such likeness in their constituent groups
were first taken up. In the conduct of the research those differences of intensity which are
actually expressed and apprehended in the utterance of a rhythmic sequence were uniformly employed.
While there is no doubt that a succession of perfectly identical forms would, under the requisite
temporal conditions, be apprehended as presenting major and minor phases of accentuation, yet
in the expression of rhythmic relations the subordination of accents is consistently observed,
and all our ordinary apprehension of rhythm, therefore, is supported by an objective configuration
which fulfils already the form of our own subjective interpretation.

The temporal relations of these major and minor phases cannot be considered apart from the
index of their respective accentuations. As the distribution of elements within the simple
group fluctuates with the changes in intensive accentuation, so does the form of temporal succession
in larger structures depend on the relations of intensity in their primary and secondary accentuations.
The quantitative values hereafter given apply, therefore, only to those specific intensities
involved in the experiment. Two types were chosen, the trochee and the dactyl. The series of
sounds was given by successive hammer-falls of 7/8 and 1/8 inch for the major, and 3/8 and
1/8 inch for the minor phase. The distribution of time-values within each group was made on
the basis of previous experimentation to determine those relations which support psychological
uniformity. These internal relations were maintained unchanged throughout the series of ratios
which the durations of the two groups presented. Four subjects took part in the experiment.
The quantitative results in the composition of trochaic forms are given in the following tables
(LIII., LIV.), the figures of which present, in the form of percentages of total judgments,
the apprehension of sensible equality or disparity in the two groups.

In the earlier set of experiments the series of ratios diverged in both directions from unity;
in the later it departed in one only, since every divergence in the opposite direction had,
in the previous experiments, been remarked at once by the observer. In this second set the
series of differences is more finely graded than in the former; otherwise the two sets of figures
may be considered identical. Using the equilibrium of errors as an index of sensible equality,
the two trochaic groups are perceptually uniform when the temporal ratio of major and minor
lies between 1.000:0.757 and 1.000:0.779.

In the dactylic form, as in the second trochaic series, ratios varying from unity in one direction
only were employed. The results follow:

TABLE LV.         37.5 per cent.
  1.000 : 0.915          33.3 "         66.6 "

  1.000 : 0.800                         40.0 "         60.0 "

As in the preceding case, when relations of equality obtained between the two subgroups, the
secondary period in every instance appeared longer than the primary. This prolongation was
uniformly reported as displeasing. The distribution of values which here support psychological
uniformity lies between 1.000:0.915 and 1.000:0.895, that is to say, the difference of phases
is less marked than in the case of the simpler trochaic composite. This is a structural principle
which penetrates all rhythmical forms. The difference in the case of both of these composites
is less than in the opposition of phases within the simple group, in which for identical intensities
and (practically) the same group of observers these presented the ratio 1.000:0.714. It is
evident that the relative differentiation of accented and unaccented intervals due to specific
variations in intensity is greater than is that of successive groups characterized by similar
differences of accentual stress; and if still more extensive groups were compared it would
unquestionably be found that a further approximation to equality had taken place.

In the integration of rhythmical groups this subordination of the intensive accents which characterize
them is not the sole mechanism of higher synthesis with which we are presented. Another mode
is the antithesis of rhythmical quantities through verse catalepsis. Such variation of the
rhythmical figure can take place in two directions and in two only: by an increase in the number
of constituents, giving what may be called redundancy to the measure, and by a decrease in
their number, or syncopation. Each of these forms of departure from the typical figure fulfils
a specific rhythmic function which determines its temporal and intensive characters, and its
local position in the rhythmical sequence.

(a) Redundant Measures.--The position of such a measure is uniformly initial. On rare occasions
individual observers reported an inversion of this order in the earlier portion of the series,[8]
but in no case were subjectively formulated series concluded in this way; and when the objective
succession ended with the redundant measure the experience was rhythmically displeasing. In
accentual stress the redundant measure is of secondary rank, the chief intensity falling upon
the shorter, typical groups. Variation from the type does not, therefore, unconditionally indicate
a point of accentual stress, though the two are commonly connected.

   [8] This was probably due to beginning the series of
   stimulations with the typical measure. Such beginning was
   always made by chance.

In regard to the relative duration of the redundant measure the subjective reports indicate
a large variability. The dactylic form appears to be slightly longer than the trochaics among
which it appears; but not infrequently it is shorter.[9] These variations are probably connected
with differences in stress due to the relation which the measure bears to the accentual initiation
of the whole series; for this accent apparently may fall either within the redundant measure
itself or on the first element of the succeeding

               >/   \  >            |   |  >    >
group, thus:  | q q q; q q; |, or | e e e  q q; q q |.
                              \/

   [9] The only form taken up was the occurrence of dactylic
   measures in trochaic series.

Two rhythm forms were analyzed, the trochaic and the dactylic, the series of sounds being given
by hammer-falls of 7/8 and 1/8 inch for accented and unaccented elements respectively. In each
experiment full and syncopated measures alternated regularly with each other in continuous
succession, giving the forms

    >     >           >       >
  | q. q; q % | and | q. q q; q. % % |.
    \/           \/

The initiation of the series was in every case determined by chance. Six observers took part
in the work with trochaic forms, five in that with dactylic. The quantitative results are given
in the following tables, in each of which the relations of duration, position and stress are
included.

TABLE LVII. In position it is final. This relation is independent of the factor of duration,
on which the order of elements in the simple measure depends. Even the excessive shortening
which occurs in the trochaic form, when the full measure has a duration almost one and one
half times as great as the syncopated, brings about no inversion of the order.

In duration the syncopated group is a shortened measure. The amount of reduction necessary
to preserve rhythmical proportion with the rest of the sequence is greater in the trochaic
than in the dactylic form, as in the relation of accented to unaccented elements in the simple
measure it is greater than in the case of the trochaic, a principle of structure which has
already been pointed out.

There is similar evidence in beaten rhythms to show that when a full measure is elided, the
pause which replaces it is of less value than the duration of a syncopated measure. When trochaic
rhythms were beaten out with a distinct pause after each measure, the relative values of the
two intervals were 1.000:2.046. Such a pause cannot be equivalent to a suppressed beat and
its interval; I regard it as functionally equal to a whole measure. If that value be allowed
for the second interval which it possesses in the same rhythm type when no pause is introduced,
namely, 1.000:0.920, the first two intervals will have a value--in terms of linear measurement--of
1.93 + 1.77 or 3.70. The value of the suppressed measure would therefore be 2.15, a ratio of
acatalectic to elided group of 1.000:0.581.

Iambic rhythm beaten out without separating pauses presents the following ratio between first
and second intervals, 1.000:1.054; on the introduction of a pause between the measures the
ratio becomes 1.000:2.131. The assignment of these proportional values gives 1.68 + 1.77, or
3.45, as the duration of the first two intervals, and 1.81 for the pause, a ratio of 1.00:0.524.

In continuous dactylic tapping, the values of the successive intervals are 1.000; 0.756; 0.927;
with a separating pause their relations are 1.000; 0.692; 1.346. These being analyzed as before,
the elided measure will have the relative value of 0.419. This shows a decline in the proportional
duration of the elision as the total value of the measure elided increases. There can be little
question that this principle applies also to the value of elisions of higher rhythmic structures
as well.

In intensity the syncopated measure is a point of increased accentual
stress. This relation is not constantly maintained in the trochaic
form, in which at one ratio the accent appears reduced;[10] in the
dactylic form divergences are all in the direction of an apparent
increase in accentuation. In rhythms beaten out the form of succession
                                 >     .          >     >
was always prescribed (e.g., | q. q; q% | or | q. %; q. q|, but not
                                 \/         \/
either at the subjects' preference), so that no material was there
afforded for a determination of the primacy of particular figures; but
the results must of course show any tendency which exists toward an
increased accentuation of the syncopated measure. It needs but a
cursory reference to the statements of these results in Pt. III., B,
of this paper, to observe how constant and pronounced this tendency
is.[11]

   [10] This result is clearly irregular, and is probably due to
   the effect of accidental variations on a meager series of
   judgments. The number of these was three for each observer,
   making eighteen judgments in all the basis of each percentage
   in the table.

   [11] The subjective notes of the observers frequently refer to
   this as an explicitly conscious process, the nature of the
   rhythmical sequence requiring a greater stress at that point
   than elsewhere. Extracts are appended:

   Trochaic Syncopation.--"There is almost a necessity for an
   accent on the last beat." "... an almost imperative tendency
   to emphasize the final syllable beyond the rest." "The two taps
   were followed by a pause and then a tap with increased
   pressure." "This was not satisfactory with any adjustment of
   time relations so long as the stress of all three beats was the
   same. In attempting to make them all equal I almost
   involuntarily fell into the habit of emphasizing the final
   one."

   Dactylic Syncopation.--"In this series it was easy to lay
   stress on the last (beat) ... this is the natural grouping; I
   unconsciously make such." "... of these the heavy one
   (accented syncopation) was much more satisfactory." "It was
   constantly my tendency to increase the strength of the last
   tap." "In this it is natural for me to make the final stroke
   heavy. To make the second group balance the first by equalizing
   the time alone is less satisfactory than by introducing
   elements of both time and force." "I felt that the latter part
   of the rhythm (unaccented syncopation) was lacking in force.
   Something seemed continually to be dropped at the end of each
   group."

   The reactors frequently repeated the full measure several times
   before introducing the syncopated measure, which thus brought a
   series to its close. It will probably be found that in the
   actual construction of poetic measures the syncopated or
   partially syncopated foot is systematically introduced
   coincidently with points of rhythmical or logical pause.

Conclusive evidence of the integration of simple rhythm forms in higher structures is presented
by the process of increasing definition which every rhythmical sequence manifests between its
inception and its close. This process is manifested equally in the facts of sensory apprehension
and those of motor reproduction of rhythm forms. On the one hand, there is a progressive refinement
in the discrimination of variations from temporal uniformity as the series of stimulations
advances; and correspondingly, the sequence of motor reactions presents a clearly marked increase
in coördination taking place parallel with its progress. A rhythmical form is thus given to
the whole succession of simple measures which are included within the limits of the larger
series, a form which is no less definite than that exhibited by the intensive and temporal
relations of the rhythmical unit, and which, there can be little doubt, is even more important
than the latter in determining the character of the rhythm experience as a whole.

The presentation of experimental results bearing on this point will follow the lines already
laid down. Only that part of the material which is derived from the apprehension of sensory
rhythm forms can be applied to the determination of this formal curve for the ordinary metrical
types and their complications. The facts of progressive coördination presented by beaten rhythms
are based on the repetition of simple forms only. The completion of the evidence requires a
quantitative analysis of the temporal relations presented by the whole sequence of integrated
measures which compose the common verse forms: dimeter, trimeter, etc. This matter was not
taken up in the present investigation.

The perception of variations in the measures of an iambic pentameter line was first taken up.
The series of sounds was produced by the fall of hammer, the distances traversed being, for
the accented elements 0.875 inch, and for the unaccented, 0.250 inch. The series was followed
by a pause equal to one and a half measures, and was repeated before judgment was made. The
time occupied by the series of sounds was 2.62 seconds. The intervals between the successive
sounds were adjusted on the basis of previous experimentation concerning the most acceptable
relations between the durations of accented and unaccented intervals. Their values were in
the ratio 1.000:0.714 for accented and unaccented respectively. The variations were introduced
in a single element, namely, the interval following the accented beat of the group, which,
in this form of rhythm, is also the inter-group interval. This interval was changed by successive
increments of one seventh its original value, or one twelfth the duration of the whole measure.
Four such additions were made, the final value of the interval standing to its original duration
in the ratio 1.000:0.636. The same series of changes in the duration of the accented interval
was made successively in each measure of the pentameter series. In all these experiments the
subjects were in ignorance of the character and position of the changes introduced. The results
appear in the annexed table.

TABLE LVIII.

                     Position in Series.    Percentage Values.
  Ratios. On the right these numbers are given as
percentages of the whole number of judgments. These figures show an
increase of discriminative sensibility for such changes as the series
advances. The percentage of correct discrimination, as it stands in
the table, is the same for the first and second positions in the
line, but this coincidence is to be attributed to accident, in
consequence of the relatively small number of judgments on which the
results are based, rather than to a functional indifference in the two
positions. I conclude that fuller experiments would show a curve of
continuous increase in the number of correct judgments for the whole
series of measures here included. If we number the series of ratios
given above from one to five, the thresholds of perceptible change for
this series of positions, expressed in terms of this numerical series,
would be: I., 4.1; II., 4.1; III., 3.9; IV., 3.6.

Secondly, in a series of five trochaic measures, the intervals separating the groups--which
in this case follow the unaccented beat--were successively lengthened by increments identical
with those employed in the preceding set of experiments. The results are presented in the table
below, arranged similarly to the previous one.

TABLE LIX.

                    Position in Series.         Percentage Values.
  Ratios. The sensitiveness to small differences in duration within the
rhythmical series becomes continuously greater as that series
proceeds. The thresholds of perceptible change in terms of the
numerical series of ratios (as in preceding paragraph) are as follows:
I., 4.0; II., 4.0; III., 3.7; IV., 3.6.

Finally, the intensity of the preceding sound was increased as well as the duration of the
interval separating it from the following stroke. The measure employed was the trochaic, the
interval suffering change was that following the accented beat--in this case, therefore, the
intra-group interval. The relations obtaining among the unchanged measures were, as to duration
of accented and unaccented elements, 1.000:0.714; as to intensity, 0.875:0.250 inch. Instead
of a series, as in the preceding experiments, only one change in each direction was introduced,
namely, an increase in duration of a single accented element of the series from 1.000 to 1.285,
and an increase of the same element in intensity from 0.875 to 1.875 inch fall. The results
are given in the annexed table:

The figures show that in regard to the discrimination of changes in duration occurring in intervals
internal to the rhythm group, as well as in the case of intervals separating adjacent groups,
there is a progressive increase in sensibility to variations as the succession of sounds advances.
This increased sensitiveness is here complicated with another element, the tendency to underestimate
the duration of the interval following a louder sound introduced into a series. The influence
of this second factor cannot be analyzed in detail, since the amount of underestimation is
not recorded unless it be sufficient to displace the sign of the interval; but if such a quantitative
method be applied as has already been described, the results show a continuous decrease in
the amount of underestimation of this interval from the first position to the fourth, or penultimate,
which presents the following relative values: 92, 66, 50, 40. A phase of rapid increase in
the amount of underestimation appears in the fifth or final position, represented on the above
scale of relative values by 120. This falling off at the end of the series, which appeared
also in previous experiments, can be attributed only to an interference with the functions
which the several measures bear in the process of comparison, and indicates that the accuracy
of judgment is dependent on a comparison of the measure or element in question with those which
follow as well as with those which precede it.

The results presented in the preceding section form the statement of but one half the evidence
of higher rhythmical synthesis afforded by the material of the present investigation. We turn
now to the second set of results. It deals, in general, with the quantitative relations of
rhythmic forms which find expression through finger reactions. Portions of this evidence have
already been presented, through motives of economy, in connection with the discussion of the
phases of differentiation in intensity and duration which such beaten rhythms manifest. The
burden of it, however, is contained in the results of an analysis, form by form, of the proportional
mean variations which characterize these types of rhythmic expression. This method has been
applied to a study (a) of the characters of the constituent intervals of the unit, in their
relation to accentuation and position; (b) of the simple group which these elements compose;
and (c) of the forms of higher synthesis manifested by the variations in successive groups.
The first of these relations concerns, indeed, only the internal organization of the simple
group, and has no direct bearing on the combination of such groups in higher syntheses; but,
again for the sake of economy, the items are included with the rest of the material.

The application of such a method, as in all treatment of material by mean variations, involves
much labor,[12] and on that account alone the lack of its employment to any considerable extent
in previous investigations may be excused; but to this method, as it seems to me, must the
final appeal be made, as an indisputable means by which all questions concerning the refined
features of rhythmical organization, the definition of units and the determination of the forms
in which they enter into larger rhythmic quantities, are to be settled.

[12] In connection with this work some 48,000 individual measurements were made (for the transcription
of which I am indebted to the patient assistance of my wife). Half of these were measurements
of the intensity of the successive reactions; the other half, of the intervals which separated
them. The former series has been employed in obtaining the averages which appear in the section
on the distribution of intensities; the latter in that on the distribution of durations. The
determination of mean variations was made in connection with the second series only (24,000).
These quantities were combined in series of single groups, and in series of two, four, eight
and ten groups, and for each of these groupings severally the mean variation of the series
was computed.

Of all the possible forms of rhythmic apprehension or expression, the material for such a statistical
inquiry is most readily obtainable in the form of a series of finger reactions, and to such
material the application of the method in the present investigation has been restricted.

In the first experiment of this group the reactor was asked to tap out a series in which temporal,
but not intensive variations were introduced; the strokes were to be of uniform strength but
separated into groups of two beats. No directions as to length of pause between the successive
groups were given, but the whole form of the groups was to be kept absolutely constant. The
reports of the subjects were uniformly to the effect that no accent had been introduced. At
a cursory examination no intensive grouping was apparent. These records were the earliest analyzed,
when only time relations were in mind, and no measurements were made of variations in strength.
Only the mean variations of the intervals, therefore, will here be taken up.

A word first as to the relative value of the two intervals and its significance. The form of
a rhythmical series is determined in every part by subordination to principles of strict temporal
arrangement. Every suppression of elements in such a series, every rest and syncopated measure
has as positive and well-defined a function as have the successive reactions and their normal
intervals. If such a pause is made as we find introduced in the present case, its value must
be a fixed function of the system of durations of which it forms a part, whether it replace
an element in a rhythmical unit, or a subgroup in a higher rhythmical quantity. In general,
the value of such a rest is less than the duration of a corresponding full measure or interval.
For example, the syncopated forms | >q % | and | >q % %| are demonstrably of shorter average
duration than the corresponding measures| >q q | and | >q q q|; and the pause occurring at
the close of a syncopated line--such as that in the middle of a catalectic trochaic tetrameter--should
be found of less value than that of the regular foot.

In the present instance two reactions are made, a pause follows, then
the reactions take place again, and so on. The intervals separating
successive groups of reactions thus result from the coalescence of two
periods, the interval which would regularly follow the reaction and
the additional pause at its close. The value of the latter I interpret
as functionally equivalent to a group of two beats and not to a single
interval; that is, the rhythm beaten out is essentially quadruple, the
second member of each composite group being suppressed, as follows:
    >
  | q q; % % |.
    \/

To estimate the proper value of such a rest the average relative duration of first and second
intervals was taken in a continuous series of two-beat measures, in which the first member
was accented sufficiently to define the rhythmical groups. The ratio was 1.000:0.760. In the
present instance the values of the simple initial interval and the composite interval which
follows it are, in terms of the linear measurement, 1.55 mm. and 3.96 mm. Assuming the above
ratio to hold, the duration of a period which included the second beat-interval and a group-rest
should be 1.16 + 1.55 + 1.16 = 3.87 mm. This is slightly less than the actual value of the
period, whereas it should be greater. It must be remembered, however, that the disparity between
the two intervals increases with initial accentuation, and in consequence the proportional
amounts here added for the second interval (1.16 to 1.55) should be greater. This interval
is not rhythmically 'dead' or insensitive. The index of mean variation in all reactors is greater
for the first than for the second interval (or interval + pause) in the ratio 1.000:0.436,
that is, the value of the latter is more clearly defined than that of the former, and the reactor
doubly sensitive to variations occurring within it.

An analysis of the variations of these intervals separately in series of four groups reveals
a secondary reciprocal rhythm, in which the changes in value of the mean variation at any moment
are in opposite directions in the two intervals. These values in percentages of the total duration
of the periods are given in the following table.

  Interval.  1st Group.       2d. Group.       3d Group.       4th Group.
  First,    15.4  per cent.  26.4  per cent.  13.8 per cent.  30.3 per cent.
  Second,   12.4     "        7.0     "        9.6    "        7.5    "

Without measurement of their intensive values, interpretation of these variations is speculative.
They indicate that the pairs of beats are combined in higher groups of four; that the differences
of mean variation in the first interval are functions of an alternating major and minor accentuation,
the former occurring in the second and fourth, the latter in the first and third; and that
the inversely varying values of the mean variation in the second interval are functions of
the division into minor and major groups, the reduced values of the second and fourth of these
intervals being characteristic of the greater sensitiveness to variations occurring in the
group pause than to changes occurring within the group.

The fixity of the group is markedly greater than that of the simple interval. In the one case
in which the mean variation of the group is greater than that of the elementary period the
material involved was meager (five instead of ten repetitions) and the discrepancy therefore
insignificant.

The difference in the mean variation of the first and second intervals respectively rises to
an individual maximum of 3.000:1.000, and averages for all subjects 2.290:1.000; the fixity,
that is to say, of the inter-group interval in this form of tapping is more than twice as great
as that of the intra-group interval. The fixity of the larger rhythmical quantities is greater
than that of the smaller, whether the relation be between the elementary interval and the unit
group, or between the synthetic unit and its higher composite. The average mean variation of
the beat intervals exceeds that of the whole group in the relation of 1.953:1.000. The differentiation
of larger and smaller groups is less clear. When the material is taken in groups of eight successive
beats the mean variation is less in the case of every subject than when taken in fours, in
the ratio 1.000:1.521. The comparative values for groups of two and four beats is reversed
in two thirds of the cases, yet so that an average for all subjects gives the ratio 1.000:1.066
between groups of four and two beats. The whole series of values arranged on the basis of unity
for the mean variation of the beat interval is given in Table LXII.

TABLE LXII.

  Proportional. Single Beat.  2-Beat Group.  4-Beat Group.   8-Beat Group.
     M.V.           1.000          0.512        0.480            0.320

The persons taking part in the investigation were next required to make a series of reactions
composed of unit groups of two beats, in each of which the first member received accentuation,
a simple trochaic rhythm. In this type the relation of intra-group to inter-group interval
remains unchanged. In all subjects but one the mean variation of the first interval exceeds
that of the second in the average ratio 1.722:1.000. The amount of difference is less than
in the preceding type of reaction. In the former there is presented not an intensively uniform
series, but an irregularly rhythmical grouping of intensities, in dependence on the well-defined
parallel types of temporal differentiation; in the latter such intensive differentiation is
fundamental and constant in its form. Assuming the character of the second interval to remain
unchanged, there is in the intensive fixity of the initial accented element, on the one hand,
and the alternate assertion of the impulse to accentuation and repression of it in the attempt
to preserve uniformity, on the other, an occasion for the difference in the relation of the
mean variation of this interval to that of the following in the two cases. It is to be expected
that there should be less irregularity in a series of reactions each of which represents an
attempt to produce a definite and constant rhythmical accent, than in a series in which such
an accent is spasmodically given and repressed.

For a like reason, the difference in value between the mean variations of the elementary interval
and the unit group should be less in the case of the positive rhythm form than in that of a
series which combines a definite temporal segregation with an attempt to maintain intensive
uniformity. The mean variation of the interval is still of greater value than that of the unit
group, but stands to it in the reduced ratio 1.000:0.969.

The relations of higher groups present certain departures from the
preceding type. In three cases out of five the unit has a greater
                                       >     .
fixity than its immediate compound ( | q. q; q q |), with an average
                                       \/
ratio of 0.969:1.072. The original relation, however, is reëstablished
in the case of the next higher multiple, the eight-beat group, the
whole series of values, arranged on the basis of unity for the simple
interval, being as follows:

TABLE LXIII. The interpretation of this rhythmical variation, as in the preceding reaction
series, must be speculative in the absence of quantitative measurement of intensive changes,
but is still not left in doubt. The rhythmic material is combined in larger syntheses than
the groups of two beats, alternately accented and unaccented, which were avowedly in mind.
This secondary grouping appears in at least a measure of four beats, into which the unit group
enters as the elementary interval entered into the composition of that unit. In this larger
group the initial period, or element of stress, is characterized by a greater mean variation
than the unaccented period which follows it. There are present in this first interval two factors
of instability: the factor of accent, that element which receives the stress, being in general
characterized by a greater mean variation than the unaccented; and the factor of position,
the initial member of a rhythmical group, independent of accentuation, being marked by a like
excess of mean variation over those which follow it. The interpretation of the latter fact
lies in the direction of a development of uniformity in the motor habit, which is partially
interrupted and reëstablished with the ending and beginning of each successive group, large
or small, in the series of reactions.

Further, when the material is arranged with four unit groups in each series, the same relation
is found to hold between the first period composed of two unit groups and the second like period,
as obtained within these pairs themselves. The mean variation of the first period of four beats
is greater than that of the second in the case of all subjects but one, with an average ratio
for all subjects of 1.000:0.745. The analysis was not carried further; there is, however, nothing
which points to a limitation of the process of synthesis to groups of this magnitude; rather,
to judge from the close approximation in definition of the two orders manifested here, there
is suggested the probability that it is carried into still higher groupings.

In the next rhythmical type analyzed--the iambic form--that relation of the first to the second
interval holds which was found to obtain in the preceding forms. The excess of mean variation
in the former over the latter presents the ratio 1.274: 1.000. In amount it is less than in
either of the previous types (2.290:1.000 and 1.722:1.000). For here, though both elements
have constant relations as accented or unaccented members of the group, the factor of stress
has been transferred from the initial to the final beat. Instead, therefore, of combining in
a single member, the factors of inconstancy due to stress and to position are distributed between
the two elements, and tend to neutralize each other. That the preponderance of irregularity
is still with the initial interval leads to the inference that position is a greater factor
of inconstancy than accentuation.

Also, the group presents here, as in the preceding forms, a greater fixity than does the individual
interval. This relation holds for all subjects but one, the average mean variations of the
simple interval and of the unit group having the ratio 1.000:0.824.

In larger groupings irregularities in the relations of higher and lower again occur, and again
the greater constancy obtains between the first and second orders of higher grouping (in which
for only one subject has the lower group a greater fixity than the higher, and the averages
for all subjects in the two cases are in the ratio 1.149:0.951), and the lesser constancy between
the unit group and the first higher (in which two subjects manifested like relations with those
just given, while three present inverted relations). The whole series of relations, on the
basis of unity for the mean variation of the simple interval, is given in Table LXIV.

TABLE LXIV. A single subject, in the case of each order of grouping, diverges from the type.
The ratio of difference in the mean variations of the first and second members of the groups
is, for series of four beats, 1.000:0.657, and for series of eight beats, 1.000:0.770. This
indicates a diminishing definition of rhythmical quantities as the synthesis proceeds, but
a diminution which follows too gradual a curve to indicate the disappearance of synthesis at
the proximate step in the process.

Three-beat rhythms were next taken up and the same method of analysis carried out in connection
with each of the three accentual forms, initial, median, and final stress. In these types of
rhythm the intra-group intervals are more than one in number; for the purpose of comparison
with the final, or inter-group interval, the average of the first and second intervals has
been taken in each case.

The results agree with those of the preceding types. The mean variation of the interval separating
the groups is less throughout than that of the average group-interval. The ratios for the various
rhythm types are as follows:

TABLE LXV.

  Rhythm Form.   Initial Stress.   Median Stress.   Final Stress.
    Ratios,       1.000 : 0.758    1.000 : 0.527    1.000 : 0.658

This relation, true of the average intra-group interval, is also true of each interval separately.
Among these ratios the greatest departure from unity appears in the second form which all subjects
found most difficult to reproduce, and in which the tendency to revert to the first form constantly
reasserts itself. The difference in value of the mean variations is least in the first form,
that with initial accent, and of intermediate magnitude in the third form when the accent is
final. The contrary might be expected, since in the first form--as in the second also--the
factors of stress and initial position are both represented in the average of the first two
intervals, while in the third form the factor of stress affects the final interval and should,
on the assumption already made concerning its significance as a disturbing element, tend to
increase the mean variation of that interval, and, therefore, to reduce to its lowest degree
the index of difference between the two phases. That it does so tend is evident from a comparison
of the proportional mean variations of this interval in the three forms, which are in order:
initial stress, 4.65 per cent.; median stress, 4.70 per cent., and final stress, 7.15 per cent.
That the consequent reduction also follows is shown by the individual records, of which, out
of four, three give an average value for this relation, in forms having final stress, of 1.000:0.968,
the least of the group of three; while the fourth subject departs from this type in having
the mean variation of the initial interval very great, while that of the final interval is
reduced to zero.

If, as has been assumed, the magnitude of the average mean variation may be taken as an index
of the fixity or definition of the rhythm form, the first of these three types, the ordinary
dactylic is the most clearly defined; the second, or amphibrachic, stands next, and the third,
the anapæstic, has least fixity; for in regard to the final interval, to the average of the
first and second and also to each of these earlier intervals separately, the amount of mean
variation increases in the order of the accents as follows:

TABLE LXVI.

  Interval.   Initial Stress.   Median Stress.   Final Stress.
  First,      5.82 per cent.    9.95 per cent.   11.95 per cent.
  Second,     6.45     "        7.87     "        9.77     "
  Third,      4.65     "        4.70     "        7.15     "

In these triple rhythms, as in the two-beat forms, the simple interval is more variable than
the unit group, and the lower group likewise more unstable than the higher. The series of proportional
values for the three forms is given in the table annexed:

TABLE LXVII.

  Rhythm Form.    Single Interval.  3-Beat Group.  6-Beat Group.
  Initial Stress,     1.000            1.214          1.037
  Median   "          1.000            0.422          0.319
  Final    "          1.000            0.686          0.524

A comparison of the second and third columns of the table shows an excess of mean variation
of the smaller group over that of the larger in each of the three forms. It is true also of
the individual subjects except in two instances, in each of which the two indices are equal.
This proportion is broken in the relation of the primary interval to the unit group in the
dactylic rhythm form. A similar diversity of the individual records occurred in the two-beat
rhythms.

The same indication of higher groupings appears here as in the case of previous rhythms. Rhythmical
variations are presented in the amount of the mean variations for alternate groups of three
beats. Chronologically in the records, as well as in dependence on theoretical interpretation,
the first member of each higher group is characterized by the greater instability. The amounts
of this difference in coördination between the first and last halves in series of six beats
is set down for the three rhythm forms in the following table:

TABLE LXVIII.

  Stress.     First Half.    Second Half
  Initial,      1.000          0.794¹
  Median,       1.000          0.668
  Final,        1.000          0.770

    ¹These figures are made up from the records of three out of
    four subjects. In the exceptional results of the fourth
    subject no mean variation appears in the first half and 6.3
    per cent, in the second, making the average for the whole
    group 1.000:1.023.

There is still other evidence of higher rhythmical grouping than these oscillations in the
amount of the mean variation of alternate groups. Exactness of coördination between the individual
intervals of successive groups might undergo development without affecting the relative uniformity
of such total groups themselves. But, throughout these results, an increase in coördination
between the periods of the whole group takes place in passing from the first to the second
member of a composite group. The relation here is not, however, so uniform as in the preceding
case. The series of proportional values is given on page 403.

TABLE LXIX.

  Stress.    First Half.    Second Half.
  Initial,     1.000          0.846¹
  Median,      1.000          1.064
  Final,       1.000          0.742

    ¹ Here also the records of three subjects only are involved,
    the results of the same reactor as in the preceding cases
    being discarded. Including this, the ratio becomes
    1.000:1.016.

The index of mean variation for the individual elements of the group also shows a progressive
decrease from first to last as follows:

TABLE LXX.

  Stress.     Interval I.      Interval II.    Interval III.
  Initial,   5.82 per cent.   6.45 per cent.  4.65 per cent.
  Median,    9.95    "        7.87    "       4.70    "
  Final,    11.95    "        9.77    "       7.15    "

The relation holds in all cases except that of I. to II. in the rhythm with initial stress.
From this table may be gathered the predominance of primacy of position as a factor of disturbance
over that of stress. Indeed, in this group of reactions the index of variation for the accented
element, all forms combined, falls below that of the unaccented in the ratio 6.95 per cent.
: 7.91 per cent.

In rhythms of four beats, as in those of three, the estimation of values is made on the basis
of an average of the mean variations for the three intra-group intervals, which is then compared
with the final or inter-group interval. As in those previous forms, sensitiveness to variations
in duration is greater throughout in the case of the latter than in that of the former. The
proportional values of their several mean variations are given in the annexed table:

TABLE LXXI.

  Interval.  Initial Stress. Secondary Stress. Tertiary Stress. Final Stress.
  Intra-group,    1.000           1.000            1.000           1.000
  Inter-group,    0.941           0.775            0.725           0.713

This relation, true of the average of all intra-group intervals, is not, as in the preceding
forms, true of each of the three constituent intervals in every case. In the second and fourth
forms, those marked by secondary and final stress, it holds for each member of the group of
intervals; in the first form it fails for the second and third intervals, while in the third
form it fails for the last of the three.

The proportional amount of this difference in mean variation continuously increases from beginning
to end of the series of rhythmical forms. This cannot be interpreted as directly indicative
of a corresponding change in the definition which the four forms possess. The absolute values
of the several mean variations must simultaneously be taken into account. First, then, in regard
to the final pause there is presented the following series of values:

TABLE LXXII.

  Stress. Initial.       Secondary.     Tertiary.      Final.
  M.V.    6.57 per cent. 9.50 per cent. 4.90 per cent. 15.70 per cent.

A very striking rhythmical alternation in the magnitude of the mean variation thus occurs according
as the accents fall on the first member of the subgroups when its amount is smaller or on the
second member when it is larger. Further, the cases noted above, the second and fourth forms,
in which each of the intra-group intervals is severally of greater mean variation than the
final pause, are just those in which the index of mean variation in the final pause itself
is at a maximum.

The average mean variations of the earlier intervals thus present changes which are analogous
to and synchronous with those of the final pause. Their values in proportion to the whole duration
of the intervals are as follows[13]:

   [13] In the second line of figures has been added the series of
   values of the average mean variation for all four intervals of
   the group.

TABLE LXXIII.

  Stress. Initial.       Secondary.      Tertiary.      Final.
  M.V.    6.98 per cent. 12.25 per cent. 6.57 per cent. 22.0 per cent.
  M.V.    6.87     "     11.56     "     6.15     "     20.45    "

Those rhythmical forms having their accentual stress initial, or on the initial elements of
the subgroups, are marked by a sensitiveness almost twice as great as those in which the stress
is final, or on the final elements of the subgroups.

Finally, if we take the whole series of intervals severally, we shall find that this rhythmical
variation holds true of each element individually as it does of their average. The whole series
of values is given in the table annexed.

TABLE LXXIV.

  Stress.
  Interval.   Initial.        Secondary.      Tertiary.        Final.

  First,   9.57 per cent. 13.23 per cent. 9.00 per cent. 11.45 per cent.
  Second,  5.53     "     10.60     "     8.70     "      9.00     "
  Third,   5.83     "     12.93     "     2.00     "     12.90     "
  Fourth,  6.57     "      9.50     "     4.90     "      7.85     "

It is an obvious inference from these facts that the position of the accent in a rhythmical
group is of very great significance in relation to the character of the rhythmical movement.
The initial accent gives incomparably greater coördination and perfection to the forms of uttered
(produced) rhythm than does the final. It is in this sense the natural position of the accent,
because on the success and fluency of this coördination the æsthetic value of the rhythm depends.

In general, though not so unequivocally, the four-beat rhythms show a progressive increase
of stability in passing from the simple interval to the group, and from the smaller group to
the larger. The series of values for the four accentual positions follows.

TABLE LXXV.

  Stress.      Single Interval.   4-Beat Group.   2-Beat Group.
  Initial,      7.27 per cent.    8.20 per cent.  8.17 per cent.
  Secondary,   11.60     "        9.60    "       6.25     "
  Tertiary,     3.20     "        3.40    "       2.25     "
  Final,       10.22     "        6.30    "       6.00     "
  Average,      8.07     "        6.87    "       5.67     "

Here, as in the preceding rhythmical forms, the most constant relation is that of smaller and
larger groups, in which no exception occurs to the excess of mean variation in the former over
the latter. The cases in which this relation is reversed are found, as before, in comparing
the simple interval with the duration of the unit group; and the exceptional instances are
just those, namely the first and third forms, in which the mean variation of this uncompounded
interval is itself at a minimum. This means that the simple interval presents a more mobile
character than that of the group; and while in general it is less stable than the latter, it
is also the first to show the influence of increased coördination. Training affects more readily
the single element than the composite measure, and in the most highly coördinated forms of
rhythm the simple interval is itself the most perfectly integrated unit in the system of reactions.

Here, as in the preceding rhythmical forms, evidence of higher grouping appears in the alternate
increase and decrease of mean variation as we pass from the first to the second subgroup when
the material is arranged in series of eight beats. The proportional values of the indices are
given in the following table:

TABLE LXXVI.

  Subgroups  Init. Stress   Sec. Stress   Tert. Stress   Fin. Stress
  1st Four,      1.000         1.000          1.000         1.000
  2d Four,       0.950         0.762          0.984         0.790

The first member of the larger group, in the case of every rhythm form here in question, is
less exactly coördinated than the second, the interpretation of which fact need not here be
repeated. Several additional points, however, are to be noted. The differences in stability
of coördination which are encountered as one passes from the first to the last of the four
rhythm forms, extends, when the reactions are analyzed in series of eight beats, to both members
of the compound group, but not in equal ratios. The mean variation of the second and fourth
forms is greater, both in the first and second subgroups, than that of the corresponding subgroups
of the first and third forms; but this increase is greatest in the first member of the composite
group. That is, as the group grows more unstable it does so mainly through an increase in variation
of its initial member; or, in other words, the difference in variability of the beat intervals
of the first and last subgroups reaches its maximum in those rhythmic types in which the indices
of mean variation for these intervals are themselves at their maxima.

This process of coördination, with its indication of a higher rhythmical synthesis, appears
also in the transformations in the value of the mean variations in duration of the total groups,
when the material is treated in series of eight beats, as in table LXXVII.

TABLE LXXVII.

  Subgroups.   Init. Stress.   Sec. Stress.   Tert. Stress.   Final Stress.
  1st Four,         1.000          1.000           1.000           1.000
  2d Four,          0.773          0.768           0.943           0.579

The total initial group, therefore, as well as each of its constituent intervals, is less stable
than the second.

Within the unit group itself the values of the mean variation show here, as in the preceding
forms, a progressive increase in sensitiveness to temporal variations from first to last of
the component intervals. The proportional values for the four intervals in order are, 1.000,
0.786, 0.771, 0.666. The distribution of these relative values, however, is not uniform for
all four rhythmical forms, but falls into two separate types in dependence on the position
of the accents as initial or final, following the discrimination already made. The figures
for the four forms separately are as follows:

TABLE LXXVIII.

  Stress.     1st Interval.    2d Interval.    3d Interval.    4th Interval.

  Initial,    9.57 per cent.   5.53 per cent.  5.83 per cent.  6.57 per cent.
  Secondary, 13.23    "       10.60    "      12.93    "       9.50    "
  Tertiary,   9.00    "        8.70    "       2.00    "       4.90    "
  Final,     11.45    "        9.00    "      12.60    "       7.85    "

In the first type (Rhythms I. and III.) appear a descending curve followed by an ascending;
in the second type (Rhythms II. and IV.) a second descending curve follows the first. The changes
in the first type are not coördinated with a similar curve of variation in the intensive magnitude
of the beats. It is to be noted here that the smallest mean variation presented in this whole
set of results is found in that element of the first form which receives the stress, an exception
to the general rule. The variations in the contrasted type have their maxima at those points
on which the group initiation-- primary or secondary--falls, namely, the first and third.

As in preceding rhythmical forms, while the separation of accentual stress from primacy in
the series tends to increase the mean variation of that element on which this stress falls
and to raise the index of mean variation for the whole group, yet the mean variation of the
initial element is also raised, and to a still greater degree, reinforcing the evidence that
primacy of position is a more important factor of instability than the introduction of accentual
stress.

In the investigation of mean variations for units (if we may call them such) of more than four
beats only a modicum of material has been worked up, since the types of relation already discovered
are of too definite a character to leave any doubt as to their significance in the expression
of rhythm. The results of these further experiments confirm the conclusions of the earlier
experiments at every point.

These higher series were treated in two ways. In the first the reactor beat out a rhythm consisting
in the simple succession of groups of reactions, each of which contained one and only one accent.
These units in each case were marked by initial stress, and were composed of five, six, seven,
eight and ten beats respectively. The results are given in the following table, which contains
the series of mean variations in duration both for single intervals and for total groups.

The averages for the combined, median, unaccented intervals are given separately from those
of the final interval, for the reason that the mean variation of the latter is greater in three
cases out of five than that of the former, a relation which apparently contradicts what has
already been said concerning the sensitiveness to variations which marks the intervals separating
rhythmical groups. The reason for this final increase in variation appears when the relative
intensities of the series of reactions are considered. They are given in Table LXXX.

  Ten,             1.000        0.621       0.640     0.545

In every case the final element is marked by an increase over that which precedes it (see last
two columns of table) of the average value for all rhythms of 1.000:0.900; an increase which
raises it above the average value of the whole series of preceding unaccented beats in three
cases out of five. To this final accentuation the increase in variation is to be attributed.
Yet despite the additional element of disturbance due to this increased final stress the average
value of the mean variation for this final interval is lower than that of the median unaccented
intervals in the ratio (all rhythms combined) of 0.992:1.000.

Turning, then, to Table LXXIX., there is presented, firstly, an excess of variation in the
accented element over that of the average unaccented elements in every case but one (the six-beat
rhythm in which the values are nearly identical), which for the whole series of rhythms has
a value of 1.000:0.794. Secondly, in every completed case (part of the figures in the last
rhythm are inadvertently lacking), the average mean variation of the single interval preponderates
over that of the total group.

The second form of rhythmical tapping, in which the longer series were beaten out as pairs
of equal subgroups, was added in order to determine the quantitative relations of the mean
variations for alternate subgroups when such groups were purposely intended, instead of appearing
in the form of unconscious modifications of the rhythmical treatment, as heretofore. At the
same time the results present an additional set of figures embodying the relations here in
question. They are as follows:

TABLE LXXXI.

No exception here occurs to the characteristic predominance in instability of the accented
element. As regards simple intervals, the relation of first and second groups is reversed,
the reason for which I do not know. It may be connected with the rapid speed at which the series
of reactions was made, and its consequent raising of the threshold of perceptible variation,
proportional to the value of the whole interval, to which is also due the higher absolute value
of the variations which appear in both tables.

These inversions disappear when we compare the relative stability of the first and second subgroups,
in which the excess of variation in the former over the latter is not only constant but great,
presenting the ratio for all three rhythms of 1.000:0.816. The characteristic relation of lower
to higher rhythmical syntheses also is here preserved in regard to the two subgroups and the
total which they compose.

The points here determined are but a few of the problems regarding the structure of larger
rhythmical sequences which are pressing for examination. Of those proximate to the matter here
under consideration, the material for an analysis of the mean variation in intensity of a series
of rhythmical reactions is contained in the measurements taken in the course of the present
work, and this may at a future time be presented. The temporal variations having once been
established it becomes a minor point.

Such conclusions, however, are only preliminary to an investigation of the characteristic structure
of the ordinary metrical forms, and to these attention should next be turned. The configuration
of the common meters should be worked out both in relation to the whole formal sequence, and
to the occurrence within the series of characteristic variations. There can be no question
that each metrical structure, the iambic trimeter or dactylic tetrameter line, for example,
composes a definite rhythmical melody within which each measure is shortened or prolonged,
subdued or emphasized, according to its position and connections in the series of relations
which constitute the rhythmical sequence.

These several metrical forms should be explored and the characters of each measure in the series
quantitatively determined. Such an investigation would include an ascertainment of the proportional
time-value of each successive measure, its average force, and its sensitiveness to variations,
temporal and intensive. It should include an examination of the configuration of the single
measure and the changes in distribution of accents and intervals which it undergoes as the
rhythmical series advances. For the rhythm group must not be conceived as a simple unchanging
form; both intensively and temporally it is moulded by its function in the whole sequence,
the earlier iambic of a heroic measure being unlike the later, the dactyl which precedes a
measure of finality different from that which introduces the series. Such a set of determinations
will give the pure characteristic curves of our common poetical meters.

But these meters are no more simple forms than are their constituent measures. At every point
their structure is subject to modification by factors which appear in the rhythmic utterance
in virtue of its use as a medium for the free expression of thought and emotion; and the manner
in which the characteristic form is altered by these factors of variation must be studied.
Of these variations the more important are the effects of the introduction of variants--of
spondees among dactyls, of anapæsts among iambics, and the like--and the occurrence of points
of origin, emphasis, interruption, and finality in special accentuations, syncopated measures,
cæsural pauses and elisions. These factors influence the structure both of those measures within
which they appear and of those adjacent to them. The nature and extent of this wave of disturbance
and its relation to the configuration of the whole sequence call for examination.

Finally, this process of investigation should be applied to the larger structures of the couplet
and stanza, that the characteristic differences in the pair or series of verses involved may
be determined. These characters include the whole time occupied by each verse of the stanza,
the relative values of acatalectic and catalectic verses occurring within the same stanza structure,
differences in rhythmical melody between the latter forms, the variations of average intensity
in the accentual elements of such lines, and a determination of the values of rests of higher
and lower degrees--mid-line, verse, and couplet pauses--which appear in the various stanza
forms, and their relation to other structural elements.

RHYTHM AND RHYME.

BY R.H. STETSON.

I. INTRODUCTION.

The psychological theory of rhythm has its beginnings in the work of Herbart,[1] who inaugurated
the treatment of rhythm as a species of time perception and suggested an explanation of its
emotional effects. While Herbart had simply pointed out the effect of a whole rhythmic series
in giving rise to an emotion of expectation, delay, or haste, Lotze[2] applied the principle
severally to each unit group (each foot) in the rhythm, and made the emotional effect of rhythm
depend on these alternate feelings of strain, expectation, and satisfaction produced by every
repetition of the unit group. Vierordt[3] did the first experimental work on rhythm, determining
the period of greatest regularity in the tapping of rhythms. But the first important experiments
were carried on by von Brücke.[4] By tapping out rhythms on a kymograph, he determined the
well-known 'Taktgleichheit' of the feet in scanned verse, and noted a number of facts about
the time relations of the different unit groups. Mach[5] added to the previous knowledge about
rhythm certain observations on the subjective accentuation of an objectively uniform series,
and specially he noted that the process is involuntary. With a much clearer understanding of
the facts of rhythm than his predecessors had had, he really provided the foundation for the
theories which follow. His most important contribution, for some time overlooked, was his emphasis
of the essentially motor nature of the phenomena of rhythm, and his motor theory therefor.

Many of the recent theories of rhythm are based on Wundt's analysis. The work of Wundt and
Dietze,[6] was concerned with rhythmic series; but it may be noted that the 'span of consciousness'
and the 'synthetic activity of consciousness' were the subjects actually under investigation.
Rhythm was considered as a special temporal form of this 'psychic synthesis.' There are three
different elements in a sound series, declared these writers, which contribute to this synthesis:
qualitative changes, intensive changes and melodic changes. Of these the intensive changes
are the most important. Every increase in intensity, that is, every beat ('Hebung') is followed
by a decrease, and the next increase which follows is recognized as a repetition of the preceding
beat and as the forerunner of the beat which is to follow. From this comes the synthetic power
of the rhythm. Just as the simple unit groups are built up by this synthesizing power, so they
in turn are combined into larger phrases and periods. The motor factor has little place in
Wundt's own discussion,[7] the 'mental activity' is the all-important thing. Bolton[8] also
made a very important contribution to the experimental knowledge of rhythm. His work was based
entirely on Wundt's theory. His method of experimentation was accurate and his observations
copious. The arrangement of his apparatus, however, led him to emphasize objective uniformity
as a condition of rhythmic grouping; so that Meumann's criticism of his application of this
principle to poetry is quite just. Nevertheless Bolton established the essential facts of subjective
accentuation and apparent temporal displacement. It is noteworthy that he laid great emphasis
on the motor aspect of rhythm, and made many careful observations on the 'motor accompaniment.'
While inclining strongly to a motor interpretation he did not attempt to cut loose from the
Wundtian 'apperceptive process' as the primary factor.

   seq.

The most elaborate consideration of rhythm yet published is that of Meumann.[9] He avowedly
worked out and defended the theory of Wundt. The only important difference is the larger place
which he gave to the 'motor accompaniment,' although he was always careful to emphasize its
secondary and derived character. He insisted that the 'mental activity' is always primary,
and that without it there can be no rhythmization; and he opposed vigorously the motor inclinations
of Mach and Bolton. It is certainly unfortunate that rhythm has always fallen into the hands
of the investigators of the 'attention,' or the 'span of consciousness,' or the 'perception
of time.' It is but an incident that judgments of time are often based on rhythms; and everything
that Meumann has said of a 'mental prius,' or a 'synthesizing activity' in the case of rhythms,
may just as well be said in the case of any coördinated act.

   [9] Meumann, E.: Phil. Stud., 1894, X., S. 249 ff.

Meumann discussed in detail the characteristics of the rhythm of a simple series of sounds,
of music, and of verse. He assumed that in the simple sound series we have rhythm in its barest
form, and only the rhythmic synthetic activity is at work; while in music there is a content
which to some extent prescribes unities, and the objective regularity of the rhythm is broken.
In verse we have much more content, and the rhythmization is no longer regular in its temporal
relations; it is entirely dominated at times by the 'logical unities' of the 'thought.'

One great difficulty with such a differentiation of the three types of rhythms presents itself
when one inquires into the objective regularity of the types; the fact is that music is by
far the most regular in its time values, though it has more content than the sound series;
and that just as great irregularities are possible in the bare sound series as in the rhythm
of verse with its rich and definite content.

Later statements of the facts and theories relating to rhythm have inclined more and more to
an emphasis of the motor aspect, even on the part of Wundtians. Since Meumann there has been
some detailed laboratory work published, but the amount of accurately measured rhythmic material
is astonishingly small. Meumann established experimentally the well-known relation between
the length of a rhythmic element and its accent, and corroborated the earlier work on subjective
accentuation. The reports contain the measurements of but about eighty individual unit groups
(iambs, trochees, etc.). Ebhardt[10] gave the measurements of from 150 to 300 taps from each
of three subjects. But his work is vitiated, as far as any application to rhythm is concerned,
because he based everything on the judgment of equality, which has nothing to do with rhythm.

   [10] Ebhardt, K.: Zeilschr. f. Psych, u. Physiol. d.
   Sinnesorgane,1898, Bd. 18, S. 99.

Hurst, McKay and Pringle[11] published measurements of about 600 individual unit groups from
three different subjects; in several cases, the material consists rather too much of records
of the experimenters themselves, but in general their results agree very well with those of
other authors. Scripture[12] published the measurements of a single stanza of poetry. It is
but a single stanza and quite too little material on which to base any conclusions, but it
is notable as a measurement of freely spoken rhythm. No experiments have been published which
bear on the nature of the rhythmic phrase, of the period, or of the stanza.

Our problem is: What part do the recurrent qualitative factors, like rhyme, play in the grouping
of rhythms? They function evidently, in the main, as factors determining the periods or larger
phrases of the rhythm structure--the verses and stanzas of poetry and nonsense verse. As no
work has been done on the nature of such larger rhythmic unities, a large share of the investigation
was concerned with the nature of the verse unity.

Two methods of investigation were used: Subjects listened to rhythmic series, into which various
modifications were introduced; and secondly, rhythms of a prescribed type, produced by the
subject, were recorded and measured.

II. THE PERCEPTION OF A RHYTHMIC SERIES.

Apparatus: A disc (Fig. 1, Plate IX.) about 50 c. in diameter, rotating on a vertical pivot,
was driven by a pulley-cone underneath mounted on the same spindle (not shown in the figure).
On the face of the disc were four concentric rings of regularly spaced holes, which received
pegs of uniform height and provided with a shoulder. Corresponding holes of each circle lay
on the same radius. On a plate supported by a bracket were mounted four levers whose heads
stood in line radially to the movable disc. When the disc rotated to the right under the levers,
the pegs forced up the lever heads and made an electric contact. The dip of the levers was
controlled by a screw adjustment. The apparatus was driven by a motor and reducing gear, which
were isolated in a sound-proof box. The rate of speed was controllable.

The apparatus was built for use with sounders connected with the binding-posts, but in this
investigation sounders were dispensed with, and the clicks from the apparatus itself were used,
since but one qualitative difference was introduced. As a rule, the objective accent of the
foot was not given; the subjective accentuation was nearly always sufficient. Subjects were
quite unable to say whether the accent was objective or not. If necessary, an accentuation
was produced by raising the pegs representing the accentuated part of the foot. The group elements
were represented by single, simple clicks made by a brass screw on the lever arm striking an
iron plate (the noise of the brass peg striking the lever head was eliminated by damping with
cloth). The rhyme was represented by a compound noise consisting of a click higher in pitch
than the verse element click, made by the peg striking the lever head, and an almost simultaneous
click lower in pitch than the verse element click, made by the screw of the lever arm striking
another iron plate. The rhyme noise was not louder than the verse element click, and as a whole
gave the impression of being a lower tone because the first click was very brief. Subjects
did not analyze the rhyme noise, and had no difficulty in making it represent rhyming syllables.
The pauses throughout had no filling.

The subject was always given a normal series until the type was clearly established, and when
the variations to be judged were introduced his attention was directed as far as possible to
the factor to be introduced. This seemed the only way to obtain trustworthy judgments. If the
subject waits blindly for some perceptual change in the whole complicated mass of sensations
which the simplest rhythmic series constitutes, he is apt to fit his attention on some irrelevant
detail, and the change may not be noted until greatly exaggerated, and he may not judge that
particular factor at all.

The subject was always asked to choose a rate of delivery which would correspond to his natural
rate of reading nonsense verse, and the clicks were always associated with syllables, though
not with words. An effort was made to keep the series as colorless and devoid of content as
possible, to eliminate uncertain association. Beyond suppressed articulation, the subject was
not encouraged to mark the rhythm with any part of the body, but a number of involuntary movements
of neck, body, hand, or foot were nearly always observed. Occasionally, when a subject's expression
was doubtful, he was asked to say a nonsense series with the clicks.

The nomenclature to be used in this paper is that of meter, but it is always subject to the
reservation that the material is only analogous to series of nonsense syllables.

Records were kept in terms of the intervals on the revolving disc; the time of revolution was
also taken, so that the figures may be translated in time intervals if desired. Thus, 34, 34,
34, 34, 34 represents a series of iambs in which the unaccented click has the length of three,
and the accented click the length of four spaces between pegs. A uniform verse represented
by a digit giving the number of feet, followed by digits in parenthesis giving the character
of the foot, e.g., 4 (34), is an iambic tetrameter.

For convenience, the verse pause is written independently of the last foot of the verse, e.g.,
4 (34) p. 7 represents a tetrameter line having the intervals 34, 34, 34, 37. The interval
of the last accented syllable is counted twice.

Occasionally this is disregarded and vs. p. equals o is written to indicate that the vs. p.
is equal to the foot pause.

The results of the experiments may be grouped under three heads:

1. Why does a synthesizing factor such as rhyme occur at the end of the verse?

2. What is the relation between the verse pause and the rhyme?

3. What is the relation of rhyme to the cyclic movement of the unit group and of the verse?

1. Why the Synthesizing Factor Occurs at the Close of the Verse.

To determine a possible difference in the sense of rhythm at the beginning and the close of
a verse, pauses ('lags') were introduced into the earlier and later parts of the verse. These
pauses were made barely perceptible, i.e., barely perceptible in any part of the verse. Usually
in iambic verse the barely perceptible lag shows the following proportions to the other pauses:

  34 35 34 etc., or
  47 48.5 47.

Most of the experiments were performed with iambic tetrameter. The subject was told to note
the lags in the verse: these were introduced either in both parts of the verse or at its close
only. At least three verses were given, and records were kept of the false judgments. When
lags of identical duration were introduced between the first and second and between the third
and fourth feet, it was found that nearly always the lag would not be detected in the earlier
part of the verse but would be detected in the later part. Out of eighty-two cases, there were
but six in which the same lag was recognized in the first as well as in the last position.
In two of these cases the subject's attention had been called to the first part of the verse;
and in the four other cases the lag was still found more marked at the close than at the beginning.

There were no cases in which a lag detected in the earlier part of the verse was not also detected
in the later part. False judgments, when they occurred, were made as to a lag in the earlier
part of the verse. One subject falsely located a lag in the first of the verse four times.
Judgments as to the earlier part of the verse were uncertain and frequently changed.

The maximum lag possible without breaking the unity of the verse was determined for the earlier
and later parts of the verse. The verse unity was tested by adding enough feet to make a full
verse, after the break, and asking the subject to mark the close of the verse. In every case
this irregularity was introduced into the second verse, and the first verse was normal, e.g.
(pentameter),

     I. 5 (34).
    II. 34 lag 34 34 34 34 34.

If the lag does not break the verse, the subject should hear the close of the verse at the
end of the fifth foot in II. If the verse is broken he should ignore the first foot and make
a new verse, ending with the sixth foot.

This shows that an irregularity in the time intervals may be greater in the earlier than in
the later part of the verse. This last table is further evidence of the increased exactness
of the rhythmic perception at the close of the verse. As far as nodes are concerned, they show
clearly two types: (1) A node after the second foot (L., G., Mi., Mc.) and (2) a node after
the third foot (R., B., H.). For the tetrameter there is some indication in the cases of B.,
S. and Mc., but the other cases are negative and further evidence is needed.

With three of the subjects, Mi., J. and K., it was not always possible to get records of the
maximum lag, since it was impossible to define the verse unity. When this was unbroken it was
the unanimous testimony of the subjects, corroborated by their unconscious movements, that
there was a feeling of tension during the lag. But the subjects just referred to got a type
of unity, and there was no tension. The lags were indefinite and very long (35-90). This unity
must be of the same kind as the unity of the stanza, which includes long expressional pauses,
as well as rhythmic verse pauses.

If a subject is asked to fall in at the beginning of a rhythmic series his first attempts are
decidedly incoördinated. His earliest reactions follow the clicks which they are intended to
represent, but presently the series of motor impulses generated by the sounds and the voluntary
movements which the subject makes fuse into a voluntary type of reaction in which the cycle
has become automatic and definite, and the clicks take their proper places as coöperating and
controlling factors along with the motor cues of the process itself. The accuracy of the judgments
of time, if such judgments be made, or the estimation of the likeness of the groups, depends
on the definiteness with which movement sensations follow each other in a regular series.

The following experiments (Table I.) concern the perception of a lag in different parts not
of a verse but of a stanza. It was a question, namely, whether a lag in the first rhythmic
series (first verse) which establishes the motor cycle in the subject would be detected in
the later rhythmic series (later verses of the stanza) after the motor cycle in the subject
has been inaugurated. This responsive motor cycle should itself, of course, contain the lag
given with the first rhythmic series.

A stanza of the form of A (Table I.) was clicked out by the instrument, but the subject had
no clue as to the regularity or irregularity of any verse. The stanza was repeated as often
as the subject wished, but not without a pause of a few moments between each repetition.

TABLE I.

  THE INFLUENCE OF A LAG IN THE FIRST VERSE ON THE JUDGMENT OF IDENTICAL
  LAGS IN LATER VERSES.

       A. Stanza given:   I. 34  34  35  34   p. 7-9
                         II.  "   "   "   "      "
                        III.  "   "   "   "      "

  In 14 cases the following was reported:

                          I. Lag noted.
                         II.   "   not noted.
                        III.   "    "    "

  In 9 cases the following was reported:

                          I. Lag noted.
                         II.  "    "   but shorter than first.
                        III.  "    "    "     "      "    "

  In 6 cases the following was reported:

                          I. Lag noted.
                         II.  "    "   and equal to first.
                        III.  "    "    "    "    "   "

       B. Stanza given:   I. 35  34  34  34   p. 7-9
                         II.  "   "   "   "      "
                        III.  "   "   "   "      "

    Any pause large enough to be noted in I. was noted in II. and
    III. (This table contains the judgments made on all trials.)

Most of the judgments of the third set are due to the fact that the subject first attended
to the series on the second or third verse. The large number of cases (83 per cent.) in which
the lags in the second and third verses were concealed by the equal lag in the first verse,
makes it very probable that the type of a verse is somehow altered by the impression left by
the preceding verse.

The method of determining the maximal lags (as previously described) gave interesting evidence
on the point at which the unity of the verse is actually felt. Which of these is done depends
on the subject's attitude, or on the point at which the verse is brought to a close. In either
case the unity, the 'pentameter feeling,' is not experienced until the end of the series unified
is reached. This is the case with all the subjects.

This development of the feeling of the particular verse form only at the end of the verse,
and the fact that the subject may be uncertain which form he will hear until the series has
actually ceased, shows that the verse-form movement is not of such a character that the close
of it may not be considerably modified. A form which may fit the pentameter can be broken off
early, and become a satisfactory tetrameter. The feeling seems to depend on some total effect
of the verse at the close. This effect is probably a blending of the mass-effect of the impressions
received thus far, which have a definite character and feeling significance, and which form
the motor disposition for the next verse. The essential thing in the determination of verse
unity seems to be the dying out of the automatism, the cessation of the coördination of the
cyclic movement. The rhyme, it would seem, emphasizes the close of the automatic cycle. But
it is probable that satisfactory phrasing has other characteristics, and a definite form as
a movement whole.

2. The Relation of the Rhyme to the Verse Pause.

Determinations of the minimal satisfactory verse pause were made with a view to comparing the
minimum in unrhymed with that in rhymed verses.

The stanza used was of the following form:

    I.   34      34      34      p.
   II.   "       "       "       "
  III.   "       "       "       "

The minimal satisfactory verse pauses were:

                           Without Rhyme.      With Rhyme.
              Subject.  L.      6                  4
                 "      J.      5                  4
                 "      Mc.     6                  4
                 "      R.      7                  4
                 "      B.     6-7                 3.5
                 "      G.      6                  3.5
                 "      Mi.    6-7                 3.25

It thus appears that the minimal pause which is satisfactory, is less when rhyme is present
than when it is not present. Similar determinations were made for the maximal satisfactory
verse pauses, as follows:

                           Without Rhyme.      With Rhyme.
              Subject.  L.      9-10               11
                 "      J.       8                  9
                 "      Mc.      9                  9
                 "      R.     10-11             10-11
                 "      B.       9                  9
                 "      G.     11-12               11
                 "      Mi.     10                 10

(A few experiments were tried with verse pauses of different length in the same stanza. A difference
of one fourth the value of the pause is not detected, and unless attention is called to them,
the pauses may vary widely from one another.)

This shows that the rhyme reduces the necessary pause in verse to the mere foot pause; while
at the same time as great a pause is possible with rhyme as without it. Aside from the table
above, a large number of the records made for other purposes support this statement: whenever
rhyme was introduced, the verse pause was made equal to the foot pause, or even slightly less
than it, and was always found satisfactory.

Numerous cases of introduction of lags into the verses of rhymed stanzas go to show that irregularities
in such verses do not affect the length of the pauses.

Two hypotheses suggest themselves in explanation of the striking fact that the verse pause
becomes unnecessary at the close of a rhymed verse.

The unity is now a new kind of verse unity; the rhyme is a regular recurrent factor like the
accent of a foot, and the series of rhymes generates a new rhythm. In the rhymed stanza we
are to see not a set of verses, like the verse of blank verse, but a new and enlarged verse unity.

There are several decided objections to this conception. First, the verse pause may be eliminated,
but its elimination is not essential to the rhyme effect; the verse pause may still be as long,
if not longer, with rhyme. Secondly, the larger unity into which the verses enter is not in
many cases a unity made up exclusively of rhymed verses. Verses without rhyme alternate with
rhymed verses, and have the usual verse pause. Thirdly, the rhyme is not merely a regularly
recurring element: it is essentially a recurring element of which one may say what has been
said falsely of the rhythm elements, that each rhyme is either a repetition of something gone
before to which it refers, or the anticipation of something to which it looks forward. In most
cases, rhymes function in pairs. Such peculiarities distinguish the rhyme from the accent of
the foot. Lastly, the freedom of the whole stanza structure into which rhyme is introduced
is much greater than that of the single verse; pauses much larger than the admissible lags
of a single verse are possible between the verses, and there is no tension which persists throughout.
There is no feeling of strain if the series halts at the verse ends.

A second hypothesis is that there is some definite process at the end of the verse which marks
the close of the verse and which takes more time in the case of blank verse than in the case
of rhymed verse. If we conceive the end of the verse as a point where a dying out of the tension
occurs, we may imagine that the rhyme brings an emphasis, and becomes a qualitative signal
for this release. The slight increase of intensity on the rhyme contributes to the breaking
up of the coördination, and at the same time exhausts and satisfies the feeling of tension
which the verse embodies. It is at the point for finishing and releasing the set of strains
which constitute the motor image of the verse. A qualitative change may be supposed to produce
the effect more rapidly than the simple dying out of the tensions, which occurs in blank verse
without a differentiated end accent.

A series was arranged in which the accent of an ordinary foot and a rhyme occurred side by
side; the distance between them was gradually lessened, and the effect on the rhyme and on
the ordinary accented element was noted.

A preliminary set of experiments on the effect of two accents which approach each other gave
some very interesting results. Thus Table II. shows the effect of gradually eliminating the
verse pause from the couplet.

    3  (.25 sec.)  --- --- --- - / - -- --- --- -. Amalgamation.

As soon as the accents are within a certain distance they affect each other. As a rule the
first retains its original intensity and the second is weakened; rarely the first yields to
the second. The table shows that the distance at which this occurs is about .42 seconds. Under
many conditions it is quite possible for two accents to occur at that distance, e.g., in rapid
rhythms, without any 'fusing.' The subject has a type of rhythm very definitely in mind and
the only hypothesis which will explain the difficulty in observing the type, in spite of the
slight change in time values, is that somehow the cyclic automatic movement has been affected
and can no longer produce the normal, limiting sensation at the accent. There is not time for
the phase of relaxation before the next, objective, limiting sensation occurs. We may figure
the movement as follows:

A is a curve in which B is the relaxation phase. At C the tensions are rapidly increasing in
anticipation of the next limiting sensation at A. But if the objective factor appears too early,
the tensions will be discharged prematurely, and the second accent will be weakened. Exactly
the obverse of these phenomena is often noticed, when a slight retardation of the second accent
produces a slight increase in its intensity. When, finally, the second accent has been moved
so near the first accent that it occurs within the phase of the first, it disappears as an
independent accent. At the same time the objective stimuli immediately following now appear
at quite irregular intervals in the cycle, the coördination is broken up, and chaos without
accentuation for some distance is the result. Occasionally the process does not right itself
before the close of the verse. As this process eliminates the verse pause, the two verses become
one, as the accents approach each other. In cases where the first accent is lost, one may suppose
that the first accent functions as an anticipatory stimulus, while the second simply increases
the effect (cf. Hofbauer and Cleghorn), and marks the culmination. The fact that the second
accent is only lost at very close range favors this idea.

TABLE III.

    At 4  (.33 sec.)  Normal.
       2  (.17 sec.)  First accent of II. is weakening.

    Mc.
       5  (.42 sec.)  Normal.
       4              II. has become anapæstic.
       2  (.17 sec.)  Rhyme is lost. Amalgamation.
    J.
       3  (.25 sec.)  Normal.
       2  (.17 sec.)  Accent of rhyme is lost. Amalgamation.
    L.
       4  (.33 sec.)  Normal.
       1.6(.18 sec.)  Rhyme retains accent, first accent of II.
                        is lost. Amalgamation. Amalgamation.
    Mi.
       2  (.17 sec.)  Normal.
       1.6            First foot of II. amphibrachic.
        .4(.03 sec.)  Accent of rhyme retained. Accent of first foot
                         of II. lost. Amalgamation.

When the qualitatively different click representing the rhyme is introduced, its most striking
effect is decidedly to shorten the possible distance between the two accents. This is in accord
with the notion suggested of the function of rhyme at the verse end. The rhyme seems greatly
to hasten the relaxation phase, as compared with the time required in the ordinary foot.

There is a variety of forms possible to the unrhymed verse, but that with the climax at the
close is decidedly the most frequent. When the rhyme is introduced the climax goes with it,
and the verse flows down as it were to the end. When the rhyme is put in the very first of
the verse, however, a secondary or even a primary accent may be developed at the close of the
verse. The natural place for the climax of the verse movement is apparently at the close, and
the fact that not only is the earlier part of the verse more vague, but also that the end is
the natural, climactic position, makes the synthesizing and delimiting factor, rhyme, preferable
at the close.

The records of the next table were obtained by asking the subjects to repeat the series with
prescribed accents, until they decided whether or not the rhyme could be felt under the conditions.

The table shows that rhymes of syllables which have accents of strikingly different degrees
are difficult to feel. In the last case, of the rhyming verses separated by a verse having
a heavy end accent, it was practically impossible to hear the rhyme across the break made by
the heavy accent. Somehow the particular condition of the organism which constitutes the expectation
of a rhyme is broken up by a heavy accent.

The material for the records of Table V. was read to the subjects, the tones were in every
case those of the speaking voice, and intervals having a definite speech character were chosen.
The fifth is the interval of the rising inflection of the question, the fourth is the interval
of the rising inflection of indifference or negation, and the single falling slide used is
a descending interval of a third or fourth at the close of the sentence. The fifth appears
in the table as 5/, the fourth as 4/, and the single descending interval of finality as the
period (.). Each verse was read on approximately the first tone of the interval, the rhyming
syllable only had the second tone of the interval.

The table shows that there is a decided tendency to prefer rhymes in which the members of the
rhyme have the same interval. The only exception is in the case of couplets, where two contrasting
slides 5/ and . rhyme, whenever the finality interval occurs last. Perhaps the similarity of
pitch of the rhyming syllables is a part of the 'Gestaltqualität' whose recognition brings
about the release and satisfaction of the state which we know as the 'feeling of expecting
a rhyme.' Definite pitch relations in music seem to make rhyme of little significance. We seldom
notice the rhymes in a hymn or in a song of any musical worth. In comic operas and popular
ditties rhyme does now and then figure. In such cases the pitch of the two or more rhyming
syllables is identical; often the whole phrase is repeated for each rhyming verse. A few experiments
in singing a rhyme to simple intervals show that when the identical interval is used the two
syllables rhyme well, but if the interval be in the opposite direction, or in another chord,
the rhyme is very uncertain. It seems that in music we usually have 'feelings of expectation'
(i.e., tensions of some sort, central or peripheral), which are adequate to unite the phrases
into larger unities. These tensions are so definite and vivid that they quite obscure and swallow
up the related condition of rhyme expectation. These experiments on the modification of the
rhyme by the various pitch and accent factors are not at all exhaustive or conclusive. An extended
series of experiments is needed. The study of sound records for pitch is peculiarly tedious,
but it should reveal some interesting relations between rhyme and speech melody.

III. THE SPEAKING OF A RHYTHMIC SERIES.

I. Methods of Making Speech Records.

The study of spoken rhythm is of primary importance. Observations on what the subject really
does are always open to the objections that subjective factors play a large part, and that
the observer's perception of a rhythm is after all his perception of the rhythm, not the subject's.
The voice is an important indicator of the activities which generate the rhythms of verse and
music, and some objective method of measuring the sounds made is essential to a study of the
rhythm production.

Methods of recording and studying the tones of the voice are as numerous as they are unsatisfactory.
In the main the work has been done for purposes of phonetics, and but few of the methods are
applied in the psychological laboratory.

Marage[13] has an excellent summary of the methods with practical comments on their applicability.
Rousselot[14] (Histoire des applications de phonétique expérimentale, 401-417: objets et appareils,
1-10 et 669-700) gives a careful history of the methods from the phonetic point of view. Scripture[15]
gives a convenient English summary of the processes.

   1899, VII., p. I.

A few methods have been devised which avoid the difficulties incident to the use of a diaphragm,
but they are not applicable to the measurement of rhythm material. The instruments which might
be used for recording spoken rhythms are all modifications of two well-known forms of apparatus,
the phonautograph and the phonograph. The phonograph record is incised in wax, and presents
special difficulties for study. Boeke, however, has studied the wax record under a microscope,
with special arrangements for illumination. The work is quite too tedious to permit of its
use for material of any length, though it is fairly satisfactory when applied to single vowels.
In order to enlarge the record, and at the same time to obtain the curves in the plane of the
record surface, Hermann devised an attachment to the phonograph (cf. Marage, loc. citat.) by
which the movements of the stylus of the phonograph are magnified by a beam of light and recorded
on photographic paper. The measurements of entire words by this method would be as tedious
as by Boeke's.

E.W. Scripture has chosen another type of talking machine from which to obtain transcribed
records. The permanent record of the gramophone (which makes a record in the plane of the surface,
like the phonautograph) is carefully centered, and a lever attached to a stylus which follows
the furrow of the record transcribes the curve on the kymographic drum as the plate is slowly
revolved. The method has the advantage of using a record which may be reproduced (i.e. the
original gramophone record may be reproduced), and of giving fairly large and well defined
curves for study. It is too laborious to be applied to extended research on speech rhythms,
and has besides several objections. The investigator is dependent on the manufacturer for his
material, which is necessarily limited, and cannot meet the needs of various stages of an investigation.
He knows nothing of the conditions under which the record was produced, as to rate, on which
time relations depend, as to tone of voice, or as to muscular accompaniments. There are also
opportunities for error in the long lever used in the transcription; small errors are necessarily
magnified in the final curve, and the reading for intensity (amplitude of the curve) is especially
open to such error.

The stylus of such a recording apparatus as is used by the gramophone manufacturers, is subject
to certain variations, which may modify the linear measurements (which determine time relations).
The recording point is necessarily flexible; when such a flexible point is pressed against
the recording surface it is dragged back slightly from its original position by friction with
this surface. When the point is writing a curve the conditions are changed, and it sways forward
to nearly its original position. This elongates the initial part of the sound curve. This fact
is of little importance in the study of a single vowel, for the earlier part of the curve may
be disregarded, but if the entire record is to be measured it is a source of error. Hensen[16]
first turned the phonautograph to account for the study of speech. He used a diaphragm of goldbeater's
skin, of conical shape, with a stylus acting over a fulcrum and writing on a thinly smoked
glass plate. The apparatus was later improved by Pipping, who used a diamond in place of the
steel point. The diamond scratched the record directly on the glass. The Hensen-Pipping apparatus
has the advantage of taking records directly in the plane of the surface, but it does not make
a record which can be reproduced; in case of doubt as to the exact thing represented by the
curve, there is no means of referring to the original sounds; and it involves working with
a microscope.

   [16] Hensen: Hermann's Handbuch d. Physiol., 1879, Bd. I., Th.
   II., S. 187.

The apparatus which was used in the following experiments consisted essentially of two recording
devices--an ordinary phonograph, and a recorder of the Hensen type writing on a rotary glass
disc (see Fig. 5, Plate X.). Of the phonograph nothing need be said. The Hensen recorder, seen
in cross section in Fig. 3, was of the simplest type. A diaphragm box of the sort formerly
used in the phonograph was modified for the purpose. The diaphragm was of glass, thin rubber,
or goldbeater's skin. The stylus was attached perpendicularly to the surface of the diaphragm
at its center. The stylus consisted of a piece of light brass wire bent into a right angle;
the longer arm was perpendicular to the diaphragm; the shorter arm was tipped with a very fine
steel point, which pointed downward and wrote on the disc; the point was inclined a trifle
to the disc, in order that it might 'trail,' and write smoothly on the moving disc. The stylus
had no fulcrum or joint, but recorded directly the vibrations of the diaphragm. In early experiments,
the diaphragm and stylus were used without any other attachment.

But a flexible point writing on smoked glass is a source of error. When the disc revolves under
the stylus, the flexibility of the diaphragm and of the stylus permit it to be dragged forward
slightly by the friction of the moving surface. When the diaphragm is set vibrating the conditions
are altered, and the stylus springs back to nearly its original position. The apparent effect
is an elongation of the earlier part of the curve written, and a corresponding compression
of the last verse written. This error is easily tested by starting the disc, and without vibrating
the diaphragm stopping the disc; the stylus is now in its forward position; speak into the
apparatus and vibrate the diaphragm, and the stylus will run backward to its original position,
giving an effect in the line like a (Fig. 4). If the error is eliminated, the stylus will remain
in position throughout, and the trial record will give a sharp line across the track of the
stylus as in b.

This source of error was avoided by fixing a polished steel rod or 'guide' at right angles
to the vertical part of the stylus, just in front of the stylus; the stylus trailed against
this rod, and could not spring out of position. The friction of the rod did not modify the
record, and the rod gave much greater certainty to the details of the sound curve, by fixing
the position of the vibrating point. This rod or guide is shown in Fig. 3 (g).

The disc was driven directly from the phonograph by a very simple method. A fine chain was
fixed to the shaft carrying the disc, and wrapped around a pulley on the shaft. The chain was
unwound by the forward movement of the recording apparatus of the phonograph against the constant
tension of a spring. When the phonograph apparatus was brought back to the beginning of a record
which had been made, the spring wound up the chain, and the disc revolved back to its original
position.

A T from the speaking-tube near the diaphragm box was connected by a rubber tube with the phonograph
recorder, so that the voice of the speaker was recorded both on the smoked glass plate and
on the phonograph cylinder. The advantages of such a double record are that the possible error
of a transcription process is eliminated, and yet there is an original record to which it is
possible to refer, and by which the record measured may be checked.

An important feature in the method was the rate at which the disc revolved. The disc turned
so slowly that the vibrations, instead of being spread out as a harmonic curve, were closely
crowded together. This had two great advantages; the measurements were not so laborious, and
the intensity changes were much more definitely seen than in the elongated form of record.
Each syllable had an intensity form, as a 'box,' 'spindle,' 'double spindle,' 'truncated cone,'
'cone,' etc. (cf. p. 446).

The disc was run, as a rule, at a rate of about one revolution in two minutes. The rate could
be varied to suit the purposes of the experimenter, and it was perfectly possible to procure
the usual form of record when desired. As a result of the low rate, the records were exceedingly
condensed. The records of the 300 stanzas measured are on two glass discs of about 25 cm. diameter,
and as much more could still be recorded on them.

The diaphragm and the speaking tube were the great sources of error. For measurements of time
values the particular component of the tone to which the diaphragm happens to vibrate is not
important, but the record of intensities depends on the fidelity with which the diaphragm responds
to a given component, preferably the fundamental, of the tone. The speaking tube has a resonance
of its own which can be but partly eliminated. For the records here recorded either glass or
goldbeater's skin was used as a diaphragm. Goldbeater's skin has the advantage of being very
sensitive, and it must be used if the subject has not a resonant voice. It has the great disadvantage
of being extremely variable. It is very sensitive to moisture, even when kept as loose as possible,
and cannot be depended on to give the same results from day to day. The records marked Hu.,
Ha. and G. were usually taken with a glass diaphragm, which has the advantage of being invariable.
As the phonograph records show, glass does not modify the lower tones of the male voice to
any extent.

The speaking-tube used was of woven material, not of rubber, and a pad of felt was kept in
the tube near the diaphragm box. As far as possible more damping was used at the other end
of the tube, but this had to depend on the voices of the subjects.

The best check on the performances of a diaphragm is the number per second and character of
the vibrations. The pitch may be calculated from the rotation rate of the disc, which is very
constant, as it is driven at a low rate by the well-regulated high-speed motor of the phonograph.
But it is better to place a fork in position to write on the disc and take a parallel record.
All the records were taken with the vowel 'a' (sound as in father). This vowel has a very characteristic
signature, which is easily seen, even in a very closely packed curve, and the correctness of
this is one of the best guarantees that the fundamental of the tone is actuating the diaphragm
(though that does not mean that the diaphragm is actually giving the vibration frequency of
that fundamental).

Every record was repeated at least twice, and both records were measured. In many of the experiments
the intensities were fixed by the conditions of the experiment. There was always the corroborative
testimony of the phonograph diaphragm; for the two were not apt to err together. It was easy
to determine if the actual intensity relations were preserved in the phonograph (but it could
not be taken for granted). Each record was reproduced on the phonograph immediately after it
had been taken, and both subject and operator listened for anomalies. In practice it was not
hard to get records of the single vowel used (at a small range of pitch which was never more
than a third or fourth and was nearly always much less) which represented fairly well the relative
intensities. Beside the checks spoken of above, every record was repeated by a number of subjects,
and the comparison of the results of different voices shows uniformity.

The recording of spoken verse is another matter. It is not difficult to test a diaphragm carefully
through a small range, but to be certain of its action at all the pitches and qualities of
the speaking voice is impossible. A stable diaphragm, glass or mica, would have to be used,
and careful corrections made for the different vowels.

At best, when the records are satisfactory, nothing can be said for the measurements of intensity
but that they represent relations of more or less; the diaphragm has a minimum intensity, below
which it does not vibrate, and a maximum intensity, above which the amplitude of its vibrations
does not materially increase without breaking into partials and 'blasting.'

The disc recorder, which had for a mount a modified microscope stand, was placed on the shoe
of the disc stand and clamped. The wax and disc records were adjusted at known starting-points
and the stylus carefully lowered, by the rack and pinion adjustment, to the surface of the
disc. After a preliminary trial of the diaphragm the apparatus was started, and when at full
speed at least two satisfactory records of the material were taken. When the disc had made
a single revolution--a record of some ten or fifteen stanzas--the recorder was fed inward to
a new circle on the disc. After the records were taken, a microscope with either 2 or 4 Leitz
objective and a micrometer ocular was substituted for the recorder. The phonograph recorder
was raised and drawn back to its starting point, and the disc came back to its original position.
The microscope was focussed, and adjusted by the screw of the shoe until it had the record
line in its field; the micrometer furnished an object of reference in the field. The phonograph,
now carrying the reproducer--if possible without a horn, as the tones are truer--was started.
At the first syllable of the record the apparatus was stopped by the device furnished on the
'Commercial' phonograph, and the plate was turned by adjusting the screw at the phonograph
carriage, which changed the length of the chain connecting the two records, until the record
of the first syllable was at some chosen point in the field. In cases of records of poetry
it was found better to have a set of syllables, say 'one, two, three' prefixed to the record,
for this adjustment. The phonograph was again started, and the curve-forms representing the
spoken syllables filed past the point as the phonograph repeated each syllable. The rate was
slow enough, with the objective 2, so that there was no difficulty in observing the passing
syllables. After the conformity of the phonograph record had been noted by the operator, and
the subject had passed judgment on the phonograph as saying satisfactorily what he had said,
the curve-forms were measured with the micrometer. The record was fed slowly through the field
by means of the chain screw on the phonograph carriage; and measurements of the lengths of
syllables gave their time values. The micrometer was passed back and forth across the form
by the shoe screw, for the measurements of amplitude (intensity). The micrometer measurements
in this case could be made at least as rapidly as measurements of kymograph curves. The measurements,
with the powers used, are accurate to.01 sec.

The smoked disc records are to be preferred to those scratched with a diamond, because of the
superior legibility of the line, an important item if thousands of measurements are to be made.
The records are fixed with shellac and preserved, or they may be printed out by a photographic
process and the prints preserved. The parallel set of wax records is preserved with them. There
are several ways in which the wax records lend themselves to the study of rhythmic questions.
It is easy to change the rate, and thereby get new material for judgment, in a puzzling case.
Consonant qualities are never strong, and it is easy so to damp the reproducer that only the
vowel intensities are heard. The application in the study of rhyme is obvious.

All the series consisted of regular nonsense syllables. The accented and unaccented elements
were represented by the single syllable 'ta' ('a' as in father). Rhymes were of the form 'da,'
'na,' 'ga' and 'ka.' In other parts of the work (cf. Table IV.) the vowel o had been used in
rhymes for contrast; but the same vowel, a, was used in these records, to make the intensity
measurements comparable.

The records of the measurements were as complete as possible. The sonant and the interval of
each element were measured, and all the pauses except the stanza pause were recorded. The intensity
of each syllable was recorded beneath the length of the syllable, and notes were made both
from the appearance of the curve and from the phonograph record.

2. The Normal Form of Unrhymed Verse.

To determine the influence of a subordinate factor in rhythm such as rhyme, it is necessary
to know the normal form of verse without this factor. It is natural to assume that the simplest
possible form of material would be individual feet recorded seriatim. But on trial, such material
turned out to be very complex; the forms changed gradually, iambs becoming trochees and trochees
changing into spondees. It is very probable that the normal foot occurs only in a larger whole,
the verse.

To corroborate the conclusions from perceived rhythms as to the existence of variations in
earlier and later parts of the verse, a table of mean variations was prepared from the material
recorded and measured for other purposes.

The mean variations of the table (Table VI.) were calculated as follows: The average for all
the elements of the stanza was obtained and an average foot constructed (excluding the last
sonant and the pause of the verse). From this average foot the variations of all the first
feet were computed, then the variations of all the second feet, etc. Then the variations of
the first feet of the stanza were averaged and percentages taken, etc.; it is this last value
which goes to the making up of the tables. In inspecting the averages the corresponding elements
of the feet should be compared. Any increased length due to a prescribed accent within the
verse, etc., appears in the averages as a corresponding increase in the mean variation at that
point, and only the first and last feet can be compared as to the variations in the verse as
a whole. In making up the tables the material was grouped, not by combining the records of
each subject, but by combining all the stanzas of a single type, in order to eliminate individual
peculiarities.

Throughout the series of measurements made the accented element was nearly always longer, and
in no case did the accent fail to increase the length of the sonant. Ebhardt's suggestion that
there are two significant parts in each foot-element, viz., sonant and pause, does not seem
good. Although the sonant is much longer when accented, the ratio between the sonant and the
following interval is not definite.

An examination of thirty-two stanzas of unrhymed iambic and dactylic (catalectic) tetrameters
(cf. Table VII.) shows that the verse pause is always at least one fourth larger than the foot
pause. In the unrhymed stanzas the verse pause varies widely, and may be as large as three
times the foot pause. A pause longer than the foot pause is absolutely essential to the unity
of the verse. All sorts of ratios are presented; evidently the verse pause is not a function
of the foot pause.

The next table (Table VIII.) shows a variety of different dynamic shadings in the verse. It
is noteworthy that in these nonsense verses the type is uniform throughout the stanza. Representing
the intensities by curves similar to those used by the subjects in listening to rhythms, we
have the forms shown in Fig. 6 (a).

The general curve is like that in Fig. 6(b).

When a special emphasis is prescribed on some particular accent in the verse, the type becomes
invariable, not only in each stanza, but for all stanzas of all subjects.

The records show that the accent is produced in a variety of ways. One, for example, gets the
accent by a slight increase in intensity, but especially by a pause following the sonant.

Frequently the special accent seems to be made by a contrast between the accented foot and
the feet which follow. In most cases the influence of the special accent is to be seen, not
merely within the accented foot itself, but both before and after the accented foot. Often
the appearance under the microscope is very striking; the sonants of the feet, both accented
and unaccented, increase to the special accent and then decrease in a regular crescendo--diminuendo
form. Much of this is not shown by the mere measurements.

In general the special accent may he said to be the climax of the verse movement. It is the
crest of the wave, and, as noted above, the dynamic shading is not always made by an increase
up to the accent, nor by a stress on a special accent, but by a sharp diminuendo immediately
following the accent. A study of the phonograph record brings out these forms of shading, especially
when the record is repeated slowly, exaggerating the dynamic variations and giving an opportunity
for more careful observation.

Within the verse the general form of the syllable as it appears in the mass of closely written
vibrations, often varies, but nearly always shows a square end. Several very common shapes
are noticed and appear in the record as (1) 'truncated cones,' (2) 'boxes,' and (3) 'truncated
spindles.' (See Fig. 7.)

With the particular syllable used, 'ta,' the beginning of curve form was usually square and
abrupt (4), and not gradual (5), although a few of the latter type are found ('spindle').

One syllable form has an especial interest, because of its bearing on the problem of 'finality'
feeling at the close of the verse. At the close of each verse, whether with or without rhyme,
the syllable form is always a 'cone' (6) (cf. Fig. 8). Of about 600 verses measured not more
than 15 are exceptions to this rule. Of these 15 exceptions 10 are under special conditions
and confirm the hypothesis that this form is related to the finality process. The form very
rarely occurs within the verse, and when it does it is usually before some cæsura, or under
unusual conditions.

This 'cone' form of the closing syllable of the verse indicates a falling of the intensity
of the voice. It is often, though not always, associated with a fall in the pitch, showing
relaxation of the vocal cords. It seems to be an indication of the dying out of the intensity
factor, a sinking of the tension, at the close of the verse. In the case of unrhymed verses,
with long verse pause, the cone is often very much elongated, and it is quite impossible to
say where the sound ceases.

Special accentuation of the long syllable of the foot increases the length of the sonant, of
the accented element, and of the entire foot. There is probably a slight increase of the total
length of an accented verse as compared with the similar unaccented, but no calculations were
made to show that point. This is quite in accord with other results (Meumann, Ebhardt). This
special accentuation is connected with an increased mean variation of the time values, as noted
above. It is in that sense a 'disturbing factor.'

   The rhymes are marked 'a' and 'b'; e.g., couplets a, a, b, b,
   etc. Verse pauses in italics are equal to the foot pause; those
   marked 'x' are less than the foot pause.

3. Modification of the Normal Form of Verse due to Rhyme.

Verse Pause in Rhymed Material.

There are as wide, isolated variations as in the case of unrhymed material. As compared with
unrhymed verse, the pause is in general decidedly shorter. The verse pauses of the feminine
rhymes are generally much like those of the end rhymed material. But there are very few cases
of the verse pause being as short as the foot pause--only four cases in sixty (6.6 per cent.).
See Table IX.

This wide variation of the verse pause and its occasional equivalence to the foot pause in
rhymed verses is in accord with the notion that the rhyme in some way brings the verse to a
close by a process more rapid than that in unrhymed material.

The introduction of rhyme seems to be favorable to the division of a stanza into two parts
by producing an unusually long verse pause after the second verse. Of 43 unrhymed stanzas there
are 19 which show a decidedly long pause at the close of some one of the verses. But of these
19 cases, only 8 (18 per cent.) have the break at the close of the second verse. Of 64 rhymed
stanzas, 29 show the division, and of this 29, 22 (34 per cent.) have the break at the close
of the second verse.

Influence of the Rhymes on Intensities.

The intensities at the close of the verse, without rhyme, may be slightly greater than within
the verse. The dynamic shading of the verse is elastic, and a variety of forms is possible,
a decrescendo at the close of the verse is not unusual (cf. Table VIII.). But when the rhyme
is introduced the general dynamic form of the verse is fixed, and in the material measured
this is true not only of the verses in a stanza which contain the rhyme but of other verses
in the same stanza.

Of the 32 verses containing rhymes in Table X., but four verses are exceptions to the rule
of an increase of intensity on the rhyme. There are two cases of double, alternating rhymes
where it is doubtful if the subject actually felt one of the alternating rhymes. This increase
of intensity on the rhyme is not confined to that particular syllable or foot; often, as indicated
by the italics, the influence of the accent makes itself felt earlier in the verse.

The evidence of an increased intensity on the rhyme is not so positive in the case of rhymes
in the third foot. Among the rhymes in the second foot there is but one exception. The rhymes
in the second and third feet were never given very satisfactorily by several of the subjects.
The rhymes within the verse determine a climax in the foot in which they occur, and all the
verses follow this well-defined type. It is interesting to note, in studying the phonographic
record, that in verses in which the accentuation of the rhythm is not very definite, the accentuation
is perceived when the record is repeated at the normal speed. If the record is repeated more
slowly, and especially at such a distance that the rhyming consonants cannot be distinguished,
then the accentuation seems to disappear. It is probable that after a verse or stanza type
has been established the voice may deviate from the type, and the accentuation will be supplied
by the hearer.

IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR A MOTOR THEORY OF RHYTHM.

If the basis of rhythm is to be found in muscular sensations, rather than in the supposed activity
of some special 'mental' function, the nature of the movement cycle involved is of the greatest
interest.

In every case where a rhythm comes to peripheral expression, there are two opposing sets of
muscles involved. If a rhythmic movement be attempted with but a single set of muscles at work,
it is very unsatisfactory and soon ends in the tonic contraction of the muscle set. One may
assume that in all cases of rhythm perception there is a cycle of movement sensations involved,
and that the simplest possible case of a peripheral rhythmic movement is the type of any rhythm.
In tapping a rhythm with the finger, the flexors which bring the finger down become the positive
muscle set, and the opposing extensor muscles which raise the finger for the next blow become
the negative muscle set.

In Fig. 9 the upper curve represents the actual movement of the finger tip, and the heavy lines
a, a', a'' represent the pressure-tension-sound sensation which we call the 'beat,' and which
is the limiting sensation of the rhythm, and the regulating factor in the movement cycle of
the rhythm. The movement is divided into two phases; B, the phase of relaxation, during which
the finger is raised, and A, the phase of contraction, during which the finger delivers the
blow which produces the beat.

The curves below represent the changes in the two opposing sets of muscles whose interaction
brings about the movement cycle. The contraction of the flexors, the positive muscle set, is
represented by the curve above the base line. It is obvious that during the contraction phase,
the contraction in the positive muscle set is at its height; it continues at a maximum during
the limiting sensation and then dies away during the relaxation phase. The sensations from
this positive muscle set have the principal place in consciousness during the rhythm experience.
The curve below the base line represents the contraction of the extensors, the negative muscle
set. The contraction of the negative muscles reaches its climax very soon after the maximum
contraction of the positive muscles, in the contraction phase. The sharp tension between the
two opposing sets of muscles at the limiting sensation may be made very apparent if the finger
beats the rhythm entirely in the air; in that case the limiting sensation consists entirely
of the feeling of a sudden increase of tension between the positive and negative muscle sets.
During the relaxation phase the contraction of the negative muscles continues, but the tension
between the two sets grows less and less, for the positive muscles are rapidly relaxing. At
the highest point in the movement either muscle set is exerting but very little strain; the
condition is represented in the figure by the approach of either curve to the base-line; the
amount of tension between the two sets is figured by the distance of the two curves from each
other.

Assuming such a movement cycle, in which the tension between the two opposing sets never comes
to zero until the close of the series, it is not difficult to arrange many of the facts of
rhythmic perception under the motor theory.

1. The feeling of rhythm is more definite as we proceed in a verse, or a series of simple sound
sensations. At first the cycle is not perfectly adjusted and complete automatism established.

2. If an observer is listening to a series, and an unusually long pause is introduced between
two beats, there is always a feeling of suspense or tension during the 'lag.' As long as the
tensions are maintained there is a rhythmic continuity; the feeling of tension is the strain
of opposition between the opposing muscle sets.

3. The continuity of the rhythmic series, whereby all the beats of a period seem to belong
to a single whole, is due to the continuity of the muscle sensations involved and the continuous
feeling of slight tension between the positive and negative muscle sets; nowhere within the
period does the feeling of strain die out.

4. But at the close of the period we have a pause which is demonstrably not a function of any
of the intervals of the period. During this pause the tension between the two sets 'dies out,'
and we have a feeling of finality. This gradual dying out of the tension is clearly seen in
the constant appearance of the cone-shaped final syllable at the end of each nonsense verse.

5. The period composed of a number of unit groups (the verse, in nonsense syllables) has a
general form which suggests strongly that it has the unity of a single coördinated movement.
There is no more reason for assuming a transcendental mental activity in the case of a rhythmic
period than in the case of a single act which appears in consciousness as a unity. Undoubtedly
the breathing is correlated with the rhythmic movements and may be a factor in determining
the verse period. Meumann's principal accent, about which a number of subordinate accents are
grouped, is characteristic not only of poetry but of the simplest rhythms. At some point in
the period there is a definite climax, a chief accent; the movement 'rises' to that point and
then falls off. This is strikingly seen in nonsense verses spoken with a heavy accent within
the verse. The accent does not stand out from a dead level, but the verse culminates at that point.

Unfortunately very little is known of the mechanism of so simple a coördinated muscular activity
as that necessary for a simple rhythm. Sherrington[17] and Hering[18]have pointed out the primary
character of the grouping of the muscles in opposing sets and the reciprocal nature of almost
all muscular activity, but in a review of the work of coördinated movements Hering denies any
simultaneous stimulation of the two sets and considers the question of the innervation mechanism
of opposing muscle-sets entirely unsettled.

   [17] Sherrington, C.S.: Proceedings Royal Soc., 1897, p. 415.

   [18] Hering, H.E.: Archiv f. d. ges. Physiol. (Pflüger's),
   1897, Bd. 68, S. 222; ibid., 1898, Bd. 70, S. 559.

That the connection between the positive and negative set of muscles in a rhythmic movement
is very close, and that the reaction is of the circular type, is evident from the automatic
character of all rhythmic movements, and it is evident that the limiting sensation is the primary
cue in the reaction. Anything further is mere hypothesis. Robert Müller's[19] thorough criticism
of the Mosso ergograph throws great doubt on the present methods of investigation and invalidates
conclusions from the various curves of voluntary movements which have been obtained.

   [19] Müller, R.: Phil. Stud., 1901, Bd. 17, S. 1.

The curve of contraction and relaxation of a simple muscle is well known and is not affected
by Müller's criticism. Its chief characteristic, with or without opposing tension, is the inequality
of the intervals of the contraction and relaxation phases. As one might expect, since a single
set of muscles dominates in a rhythmic movement, the typical rhythmic curve has the general
character of the curve of the simple muscle. The average values of the phases of curves of
simple rhythmic movement obtained by A. Cleghorn[20] from a large number of observations with
at least three subjects, are as follows: phase of contraction, .44 second; phase of relaxation,
.54 second. It is very significant for a motor theory of rhythm that this general form of the
curve of rhythmic movement may easily be altered in all sorts of fashions by unusual stimuli
to the two muscle sets.

   [20] Cleghorn, A.: Am. Journal of Physiol., 1898, I., p. 336.

While it is well recognized that a rhythm does not consist necessarily of sound sensations,
the 'rhythmization' of a series of sound sensations in the ordinary perceived rhythms is a
matter of great interest. Ewald found strong reasons for believing that the ear is peculiarly
connected with the motor apparatus. The experiments of Hofbauer[21] and Cleghorn[22]show that
any strong stimulus to either eye or ear modifies decidedly the reactions of coördinated muscles.
How shall we assume that the automatic movement cycle necessary to rhythmic perception is set
up when one listens to a series of sounds?

   [21] Hofbauer: Archiv f. d. ges. Physiol. (Pflüger's), 1897,
   Bd. 68, S. 553.

   [22] Cleghorn, A.: op. cit.

It must be assumed that any chance sound sets up a contraction in a set of muscles, however
large or small. If but a single sound occurs, the phase of contraction in that muscle set is
followed by a longer phase of relaxation, and the musculature is passive as before; it may
be that the stretching of the antagonistic set of muscles weakly stimulates them, and they
then contract during the relaxation phase and assist in restoring the original condition.

But if a second sound occurs toward the end of the relaxation phase, before the tension is
quite exhausted, the movement will be repeated; the negative set of muscles will be more definitely
stimulated, for the activity will not have been exhausted when the second sound occurs. If
the sound continues to recur at regular intervals, the movement cycle thus established will
rapidly become coördinated. The positive set in its vigorous contraction furnishes a limiting
sensation which becomes a cue for its own relaxation and for the reciprocal contraction of
the negative muscle set. The contraction of the negative muscle set and the resulting changes
in tension may become in turn a cue for the positive set. The reaction is now of the circular
type and the process has become self-regulative, though constantly reinforced by the recurring
sound (which has become a part of the limiting sensation of the rhythmic movement cycle).

But it is very probable that the second sound may not be timed so as to come at the close of
the relaxation phase in the set of muscles roused; moreover, in almost all rhythms there are
secondary sounds occurring between the main beats. What happens when a sound occurs out of
place, early in the phase of relaxation, or just before or just after the climax in the contraction
phase? Does it make it impossible to establish the coördination, or destroy it if already established?

Hofbauer demonstrated that a stimulus which appears in close proximity to the limiting sensation,
either before or after, always increases the force of the reaction, so that such a slight displacement
could not affect the rhythm, which would quickly readjust itself. The possibility of a stimulus
occurring in the relaxation phase is of much more importance for a motor theory of the initiation
of a rhythmic movement. Cleghorn made the stimulus occur at the beginning of the relaxation
phase. Instead of prolonging or reinstating the contraction phase, he found that the stimulus
intensified the relaxation process and shortened its period. "The stimulated relaxation is
not only quicker than the normal, but also more complete; the end of the normal relaxation
is slow; ... relaxation under the influence of the stimulus, on the contrary, shows nothing
of this, but is a sudden sharp drop directly to the base line and sometimes below it." A comparison
of the normal phases with the same phases, when the stimulus occurs within the relaxation phase,
follows:

  Normal: Contraction-phase, .44 sec.; relaxation-phase, .54 sec.;
             total, .98 sec.
  With stim.: Contraction-phase, .47 sec.: relaxation-phase, .30 sec.;
             total, .77 sec.

It will be noticed that the total time of the movement cycle is reduced. One may then assume
that a sound which occurs too early to become a factor in the limiting sensation, functions
as a stimulus to the relaxation process and shortens the interval between the limiting sensations.
Thus the movement cycle would be modified, but not destroyed. It is impossible to say just
how the relaxation process is affected, and Cleghorn's own conclusions are open to criticism
in the light of Müller's comments on the method. The simplest assumption would be that the
stimulus acted on the negative set of muscles.

E.W. Scripture[23] objects to such a 'tonus theory,' because some subjects regularly react
before the signal. But in no case in the published records to which he refers is the error
more than.05 sec. either before or after the signal. The investigation of Hofbauer shows conclusively
that in such cases the effect of the external stimulus simply fuses with the limiting sensation.
Scripture overlooks the automatic character of the rhythmic movement.

   [23] Scripture, E.W.: 'The New Psychology,' London, 1897, p. 182.

There is a striking difference between rhythmic movement from unit group to unit group within
a period, and movement from period to period (i.e., from verse to verse of nonsense syllables).
Each foot is simply the repetition of the movement cycle; all the tensions are maintained,
and each foot is an integral part of a larger act. At the close of the period (verse) the active
tensions die out, either because of the introduction of some unusual stimulus which causes
the positive muscle set to strike a heavy blow, and abruptly upset the balanced tensions, or
because a pause of indefinite length ensues in which the tensions die out. This is the process
which we call 'finality.'

In the stanza there is evidently a different type of unity from that in the single verse. When
we hear the first verse of the stanza, we do not know what the verse whole is, until the finality
factor or the verse pause is reached, at its close. Then the verse has a certain definite cumulative
effect, a synthetic effect which results from the echoes of the various movements and the total
effect on the organism. One may call it the tetrameter feeling. The verse pause may vary within
large limits, but after a few verses there is a definite scheme, or 'Gestaltqualität,' which
represents the verse unity. It is some sort of a memory image, which functions as a cue to
the motor process. This motor image, set of strains, or whatever it be, is more than a mere
standard by which we judge the present verse. The memory image fuses in some way with the living
motor process. The preceding verse affects the character of the following verse. An irregularity,
easily noted in the first verse, is obscure in the second, and not detected in the third verse,
when the verses are identical.

The experiments of Hofbauer and Cleghorn, and many facts about the unit groups themselves,
make it evident that the function of stimuli, during the movement cycle, varies with the position
of the stimulus in that cycle. This offers a possible explanation of the striking peculiarities
of the unit groups. The iamb [\/ '] and the trochee [' \/] should be quite alike for a general
synthesizing process; but not only is the experiential character of the two quite unlike, but
the ratio between their intervals is entirely different.

A number of measurements by different observers show that in the iambic foot the unaccented
syllable is proportionately much shorter than the unaccented syllable in the trochaic foot.
It is very easy to beat a simple up-and-down accompaniment to a series of simple feet of nonsense
syllables; in the accompaniment the bottom of the down stroke, the limiting sensation of the
movement cycle, coincides with the accented syllable of the foot. It is not an unwarranted
assumption that such a fundamental accompaniment represents the fundamental movement cycle
of that rhythm.

During the present investigation several observers were asked to determine at just what point
in the fundamental movement the unaccented syllable occurred, when the subject gave a series
of nonsense syllables. In the fundamental accompaniment the excursion of the hand and arm was
at least.4 meter. Four subjects were thus tested, and the results were uniform in the case
of all the simple types of unit groups.

In the case of the iamb the unaccented syllable occurs at the top of the movement, at the very
beginning of the contraction phase (A, in Fig. 5).

In the case of the trochee the unaccented syllable occurs in the first third of the relaxation
phase (B).

It is interesting to note that the unaccented element of the trochee comes at the earlier part
of the relaxation phase, where it must intensify the relaxation process, and tend to shorten
the total length of the cycle. This may be the reason for its peculiar buoyant, vigorous and
non-final character. On the other hand the unaccented element of the iamb occurs at a point
where it may initiate and intensify the contraction, which gives the limiting sensation; it
is, therefore, more closely bound to the limiting sensation, and has the character of intensifying
the beat. There is a similar contrast in the cases of the dactyl and anapæst. The accented
syllable of the dactyl is longest, and the second unaccented syllable, the last in the group,
is shortest. The accented syllable of the anapæst is much longer in proportion than that of
the dactyl, and the unaccented syllables are very short, and hence, very close to the accented
syllable, as compared with the dactyl.

In the case of the dactyl the first unaccented syllable in the movement cycle occurs at the
beginning of the relaxation phase (B), in the same zone as the unaccented of the trochee. The
second unaccented syllable of the dactyl appears at the beginning of the next contraction phase
(A), in the zone of the unaccented syllable of the iamb. The group seems a sort of combination
of the iamb and trochee, and has an element in every possible zone of the movement cycle. Like
the trochee the dactyl is a non-final foot. It is possible to form a unit group in nonsense
syllables where the unaccented syllable of the iamb shall be represented not by two syllables,
as in the anapæst, but by even three.

The anapæst and dactyl, if they correspond to this construction, should show a decided difference
as to the possibility of prolonging the foot pause. The prolongation of the foot pause would
make the dactyl but a modified trochee.

It is significant that in poetry no other types of unit groups are often recognized. The amphibrach,
laid out on this scheme, would coincide with the dactyl, as there are but three possible zones
for foot elements: the zone of the limiting sensation (always occupied by the accented syllable),
the zone of the contraction phase (occupied by the unaccented syllables of the iamb and anapæst),
and the zone of the relaxation phase (occupied by the unaccented syllable of the trochee and
the middle syllable of the dactyl).

The simple sound series is fairly regular, because of its cyclic and automatic character. It
is not a matter of time estimation, and the 'Taktgleichheit' is not observed with accuracy.
The primary requisite for the unit groups is that they shall be alike, not that they shall
be equal. The normal cycle with a heavy accent is longer than the normal cycle with a lighter
accent, for the simple reason that it takes muscles longer to relax from the tenser condition.
Time is not mysteriously 'lost'; the objective difference is not noticed, simply because there
are no striking differences in the cycles to lead one to a time judgment. Ebhardt's notion
that the motor reaction interferes with the time judgment, and that a small amount of time
is needed in the rhythmic series in which to make time judgments, is a mere myth.

An unusual irregularity, like a 'lag,' is noted because of the sense of strain and because
other events supervene in the interval. But such lags may be large without destroying the rhythm;
indeed cæsural and verse pauses are essential to a rhythm, and in no sense rhythm-destroying.
An unbroken series of unit groups is an abstraction to which most forms of apparatus have helped
us. Between the extreme views of Bolton[24] and Sidney Lanier,[25]who make regularity an essential
of the rhythm of verse, and Meumann, on the other hand, who makes the meaning predominate over
the rhythm, the choice would fall with Meumann, if one must choose. Bolton comes to the matter
after an investigation in which regularity was a characteristic of all the series. Lanier's
constructions are in musical terms, and for that very reason open to question. He points out
many subtle and interesting relationships, but that verse can be formulated in terms of music
is a theory which stands or falls by experimental tests.

    (The first stanza was measured in the Harvard Laboratory. The

    gramophone record (1899). As the scansion of the last is in
    doubt with Scripture, no totals of feet are given.)

In the cases given in the above table there is an irregularity quite impossible to music.

In the movement cycle of the simple sounds there is a perfect uniformity of the movements of
the positive and negative sets of muscles from unit group to unit group. But in verse, the
movements of the motor apparatus are very complicated. Certain combinations require more time
for execution; but if this variation in the details of the movement does not break the series
of motor cues, or so delay the movements as to produce a feeling of strain, the unit groups
are felt to be alike. We have no means of judging their temporal equality, even if we cared
to judge of it. It is a mistake, however, to say that time relations ('quantity') play no part
in modern verse, for the phases of the movement cycle have certain duration relations which
can be varied only within limits.

Extreme caution is necessary in drawing conclusions as to the nature of verse from work with
scanned nonsense syllables or with mechanical clicks. It is safe to say that verse is rhythmic,
and, if rhythm depends on a certain regularity of movements, that verse will show such movements.
It will of course use the widest variation possible in the matter of accents, lags, dynamic
forms, and lengths of sonant and element depending on emphasis. The character of the verse
as it appears on the page may not be the character of the verse as it is actually read. The
verses may be arbitrarily united or divided. But in any simple, rhythmic series, like verse,
it seems inevitable that there shall be a pause at the end of the real verse, unless some such
device as rhyme is used for the larger phrasing.

There is a variety of repetitions in poetry. There may be a vague, haunting recurrence of a
word or phrase, without a definite or symmetrical place in the structure.

Repetition at once attracts attention and tends to become a structural element because of its
vividness in the total effect. There are two ways in which it may enter into the rhythmic structure.
It may become a well-defined refrain, usually of more than one word, repeated at intervals
and giving a sense of recognition and possibly of completeness, or it may be so correlated
that the verses are bound together and occur in groups or pairs. Rhyme is a highly specialized
form of such recurrence.

The introduction of rhyme into verse must affect the verse in two directions.

It makes one element in the time values, viz., the verse pause, much more flexible and favors
'run on' form of verses; it is an important factor in building larger unities; it correlates
verses, and contributes definite 'Gestaltqualitäten' which make possible the recognition of
structure and the control of the larger movements which determine this structure. Thus it gives
plasticity and variety to the verse.

On the other hand, it limits the verse form in several directions. The general dynamic relations
and the individual accents must conform to the types possible with rhyme. The expressional
changes of pitch, which constitute the 'melody,' or the 'inflections' of the sentences, play
an important part. The dynamic and melodic phases of spoken verse which have important relations
to the rhyme are not determined by the mere words. The verses may scan faultlessly, the lines
may read smoothly and be without harsh and difficult combinations, and yet the total rhythmic
effect may be indifferent or unpleasant. When a critic dilates on his infallible detection
of an indefinable somewhat, independent of material aspects of the verse and traceable to a
mystic charm of 'thought,' it may very well be that the unanalyzed thing lies in just such
dynamic and melodic conditions of rhythm and rhyme.

The most primitive characteristic of music is the ensemble. Savage music is often little else
than time-keeping. When the social consciousness would express itself in speech or movement
in unison, some sort of automatic regulation is necessary. This is the beginning of music.
The free reading of verse easily passes over into singing or chanting. When this happens, the
thing most noticeable in the new form is its regulated, automatic and somewhat rigid character.
It is stereotyped throughout. Not only are the intervals and accents fixed, but the pitch and
quality changes are now definite, sustained and recurrent. The whole sum of the motor processes
of utterance has become coördinated and regulated. Along with this precision of all the movements
comes a tendency to beat a new rhythm. This accompanying rhythm is simpler and broader in character;
it is a kind of long swell on which the speech movements ripple. This second rhythm may express
itself in a new movement of hand, head, foot or body; when it has become more conscious, as
in patting time to a dance or chant, it develops complicated forms, and a third rhythm may
appear beside it, to mark the main stresses of the two processes. The negro patting time for
a dance beats the third fundamental rhythm with his foot, while his hands pat an elaborate
second rhythm to the primary rhythm of the dancers.

The essential character of musical rhythm, as contrasted with the rhythm of both simple sounds
and of verse, is just this coördination of a number of rhythms which move side by side. This
is the reason for the immense complexity and variety of musical rhythms. The processes check
each other and furnish a basis for a precision and elaborateness of rhythmical movement in
the individual parts which is quite impossible in a simple rhythm.

Even when the concomitant rhythms are not expressed, as in an unaccompanied solo, an accompaniment
of some sort is present in the motor apparatus, and contributes its effect to the consciousness.
This regulation of the movement by the coincidence of several rhythms is the cause of the striking
regularity of the temporal relations. At some points in the musical series the several movement
cycles may appear in the same phase, and at these points the same irregularities as in verse
are possible, as in the case of pauses at the ends of periods and the irregularities of phrasing.
It is evident in cases of expressional variations of tempo that a single broad rhythm is dominating
and serving as a cue for the other more elaborate rhythmic processes, instead of being regulated
by them.

I. THE PROBLEMS OF SYMMETRY. Such, however, is not the case. Non-symmetrical arrangements of
space are often extremely pleasing. The question whether or not this is the fact makes the
leading problem of this paper, and the answer to it must throw light on the value of the theory
itself.

An exhaustive treatment of our question would thus divide itself into two parts; the first
dealing with real (or geometrical) symmetry, the second with apparent asymmetry; the first
seeking to show that there is a real æsthetic pleasure in geometrical symmetry, and that this
pleasure is indeed based on the harmony of the motor impulses suggested by symmetry, with the
natural motor impulses of the human organism; the second seeking to show in what manner æsthetically
pleasing but asymmetrical arrangements conform to the same principles. Within these two groups
of problems two general types of investigation are seen to be required; experiment, and the
analysis of æsthetic objects.

The main question, as stated above, is of course whether the theory can explain our pleasure
in arrangements which are completely or partly symmetrical. It is, however, an indispensible
preliminary to this question, to decide whether the pleasure in symmetrical arrangements of
space is indeed immediate and original. If it were shown to be a satisfaction of expectation,
bred partly from the observation of symmetrical forms in nature, partly from the greater convenience
of symmetrical objects in daily use, the whole question of a psychophysical explanation would
have no point. If no original æsthetic pleasure is felt, the problem would be transformed to
a demand for the explanation of the various ways in which practical satisfaction is given by
symmetrical objects and arrangements. The logical order, then, for our investigation would
be: First, the appearance of symmetry in the productions of primitive life, as a (debatable)
æsthetic phenomenon emerging from pre-æsthetic conditions; secondly, the experimental study
of real symmetry; thirdly, the analysis of geometrical symmetry in art, especially in painting
and architecture, by means of which the results of the preceding studies could be checked and
confirmed. Having once established a theory of the æsthetic significance of real symmetry,
we should next have to examine asymmetrical, beautiful objects with reference to the relation
of their parts to a middle line; to isolate the elements which suggest motor impulses; to find
out how far it is possible to establish a system of substitution of these psychological factors
and how far such substitution takes place in works of art--i.e., to what extent a substitutional
symmetry or balance is found in pleasing arrangements. These investigations, again, would fall
into the two groups of experiment and analysis. The products of civilized art are too complicated
to admit of the complete analysis and isolation of elements necessary to establish such a system
of substitution of psychological factors as we seek. From suggestions, however, obtained from
pleasing asymmetrical arrangements, first, isolated elements may be treated experimentally,
and secondly, the results checked and confirmed by works of art.

With regard to the study of objects without a natural or suggested middle line, as for instance
sculpture, many types of architecture, landscapes, gardens, room-arrangements, etc., we may
fitly consider it as a corollary to the study of asymmetrical objects with artificial limits
which do suggest a middle. If we find, by the study of them, that a system of substitution
of psychological factors does obtain, the whole field can be covered by the theory already
propounded, and its application extended to the minutest details. The hypothesis, having been
so far confirmed, may be then easily applied to the field of asymmetrical objects without a
natural middle line.

The set of problems here suggested to the student of symmetry will not be fully followed out
in this paper. The experimental treatment of geometrical symmetry, the analysis of the completely
symmetrical products of civilized art, and the analysis of all forms of asymmetry except asymmetry
in pictures will be omitted. If, however, the fact of an original æsthetic feeling for symmetry
is established by the study of primitive art, and the theory of the balance of motor impulses
through the substitution of factors is established by the experimental treatment of isolated
elements, and further confirmed by the analysis of pictures, the general argument may be taken
as sufficiently supported. This paper, then, will contain three sections: an introductory one
on symmetry in primitive art, and two main sections, one on experiments in substitutional symmetry,
and one on substitutional symmetry or balance in pictures.

II. SYMMETRY IN PRIMITIVE ART.

The question which this section will attempt to answer is this: Is there in primitive art an
original and immediate æsthetic feeling for symmetry? This question depends on two others which
must precede it: To what extent does symmetry actually appear in primitive art? and, How far
must its presence be accounted for by other than æsthetic demands?

For the purpose of this inquiry the word primitive may be taken broadly as applying to the
products of savage and half-savage peoples of to-day, as well as to those of prehistoric races.
The expression primitive art, also, requires a word of explanation. The primitive man seldom
makes purely ornamental objects, but, on the other hand, most of his articles of daily use
have an ornamental character. We have to consider primitive art, therefore, as represented
in the form and ornamentation of all these objects, constituting practically an household inventory,
with the addition of certain drawings and paintings which do not appear to serve a definite
practical end. These last, however, constitute only a small proportion of the material.

The method of the following outline treatment will be to deduct from the object under consideration
those symmetrical elements which seem to be directly traceable to non-æsthetic influences;
such elements as are not thus to be accounted for must be taken as evidence of a direct pleasure
in, and desire for symmetry on the part of primitive man. These possible non-æsthetic influences
may be provisionally suggested to be the technical conditions of construction, the greater
convenience and hence desirability of symmetrical objects for practical use, and the symmetrical
character of natural forms which were imitated.

The first great group of objects is given in primitive architecture. Here is found almost complete
unanimity of design, the conical, hemispherical or beehive form being well-nigh universal.
The hut of the Hottentots, a cattle-herding, half-nomadic people, is a good type of this. A
circle of flexible staves is stuck into the ground, bent together and fastened at the top,
and covered with skins. But this is the form of shelter constructed with the greatest ease,
suitable to the demands of elastic materials, boughs, twigs, reeds, etc., and giving the greatest
amount of space with the least material. There are, indeed, a few examples of the rectangular
form of dwelling among various primitive races, but these seem to be more or less open to explanation
by the theory advanced by Mr. V. Mendeleff, of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology. "In his opinion
the rectangular form of architecture which succeeds the type under discussion, must have resulted
from the circular form by the bringing together within a limited area of many houses.... This
partition would naturally be built straight as a two-fold measure of economy."[2] This opinion
is confirmed by Mr. Cushing's observations among the Zuñi villages, where the pueblos have
circular forms on the outskirts. Thus the shape of the typical primitive dwelling is seen to
be fully accounted for as the product of practical considerations alone. It may therefore be
dismissed as offering no especial points of interest for this inquiry.

   [2] Cushing, F.H.: 'Pueblo Pottery and Zuñi Culture-growth,'
   Rep. of Bur. of Ethnol., 1882-3, p. 473.

Next in the order of primitive development are the arts of binding and weaving. The stone axe
or arrow-head, for example, was bound to a wooden staff, and had to be lashed with perfect
evenness,[3] and when in time the material and method of fastening changed, the geometrical
forms of this careful binding continued to be engraved at the juncture of blade and handle
of various implements. It should be noted, however, that these binding-patterns, in spite of
their superfluous character, remained symmetrical.

   [3] Haddon, A.C.: 'Evolution in Art,' London, 1895, pp. 84 ff.

On the great topic of symmetry in weaving, monographs could be written. Here it is sufficient
to recall[4] that the absolutely necessary technique of weaving in all its various forms of
interlacing, plaiting, netting, embroidering, etc., implies order, uniformity, and symmetry.
The chance introduction of a thread or withe of a different color, brings out at once an ordered
pattern in the result; the crowding together or pressing apart of elements, a different alternation
of the woof, a change in the order of intersection, all introduce changes by the natural necessities
of construction which have the effect of purpose. So far, then, as the simple weaving is concerned,
the æsthetic demand for symmetry may be discounted. While it may be operative, the forms can
be explained by the necessities of construction, and we have no right to assume an æsthetic motive.

   Development of Form and Ornament,' Rep. of Bur. of Ethnol.,
   1884-5, p. 195.

The treatment of human and animal forms in weaving is, however, indicative of a direct pleasure
in symmetry. The human form appears almost exclusively (much schematized) en face. When in
profile, as for instance in Mexican and South American work, it is doubled--that is, two figures
are seen face to face. Animal figures, on the other hand, are much used as row-ornaments in
profile.[5] It would seem that only the linear conception of the row or band with its suggestions
of movement in one direction, justified the use of profile (e.g., in Peruvian woven stuffs),
since it is almost always seen under those conditions, indicating that a limited rectangular
space is felt as satisfactorily filled only by a symmetrical figure.[6] Moreover, and still
more confirmatory of this theory, even these row-pattern profiles are immensely distorted toward
symmetry, and every 'degradation' of form, to use Professor Haddon's term, is in the direction
of symmetry. (See Fig. 1.)

The shape of primitive pottery is conditioned by the following influences: The shapes of utensils
preceding clay, such as skins, gourds, shells, etc., which have been imitated, the forms of
basket models, and the conditions of construction (formation by the hands). For all these reasons,
most of these shapes are circular. The only (in the strict sense) symmetrical shapes found
are of unmistakably animal origin, and it is interesting to notice the gradual return of these
to the eurhythmic form; puma, bird, frog, etc., gradually changing into head, tail and leg
excrescences, and then handles and nodes (rectangular panels), upon a round bowl or jar L,
as shown in the figures. In fact, in ancient American pottery,[7] at least, all the symmetrical
ornamentations can be traced to the opposition of head and tail, and the sides between them,
of these animal forms. But beyond this there is no degradation of the broad outline of the
design. The head and tail, and sides, become respectively handles and nodes--but the symmetry
becomes only more and more emphasized. And as in the case of textiles, the ornaments of the
rectangular spaces given by the nodes are strikingly symmetrical. Many of these are from animal
motives, and nearly always heads are turned back over the body, tails exaggerated, or either
or both doubled, to get a symmetrical effect. Although much of the symmetrical ornament, again,
is manifestly from textile models, its symmetrical character is so carefully preserved against
the suggestions of the circular form that a direct pleasure in its symmetry may be inferred.
(See Figs. 2-7.)

   pottery, Rep. of Bur. of Ethnol., 1882-83, p. 265, p. 367, and
   p. 443.

The subject of drawing can be here only touched upon, but the results of study go to show,
in general, two main directions of primitive expression: pictorial representation, aiming at
truth of life, and symbolic ornament. The drawings of Australians, Hottentots and Bushmen,
and the carvings of the Esquimaux and of the prehistoric men of the reindeer period show remarkable
vigor and naturalness; while the ornamentation of such tribes as the South Sea Islanders has
a richness and formal beauty that compare favorably with the decoration of civilized contemporaries.
But these two types of art do not always keep pace with each other. The petroglyphs of the
North American Indians[8] exhibit the greatest irregularity, while their tattooing is extremely
regular and symmetrical. The Brazilian savage [9] draws freehand in a very lively and grotesque
manner, but his patterns are regular and carefully developed. Again, not all have artistic
talents in the same direction. Dr. Schurtz, in his 'Ornamentik der Aino,'[10] says: "There
are people who show a decided impulse for the direct imitation of nature, and especially for
the representation of events of daily life, as dancing, hunting, fishing, etc. It is, however,
remarkable that a real system of ornamentation is scarcely ever developed from pictorial representations
of this kind; that, in fact, the people who carry out these copies of everyday scenes with
especial preference, are in general less given to covering their utensils with a rich ornamentive
decoration."[11] Drawing and ornament, as the products of different tendencies, may therefore
be considered separately.

The reason for the divergence of drawing and ornament is doubtless the original motive of ornamentation,
which is found in the clan or totem ideas. Either to invoke protection or to mark ownership,
the totem symbol appears on all instruments and utensils; it has been shown, indeed, that practically
all primitive ornament is based on totemic motives.[12] Now, since a very slight suggestion
of the totem given by its recognized symbol is sufficient for the initiated, the extreme of
conventionalization and degradation of patterns is allowable, and is observed to take place.
The important point to be noted in this connection is, however, that all these changes are
toward symmetry. The most striking examples might be indefinitely multiplied, and are to be
found in the appended references (see Figs. 8 and 9).

We may distinguish here, also, between the gradual disintegration and degradation of pattern
toward symmetry, as seen in the examples just given, and the deliberate distortion of figures
for a special purpose. This is strikingly shown in the decorative art of the Indians of the
North Pacific coast. They systematically represent their totem animals--their only decorative
motives--as split in symmetrical sections, and opened out flat on the surface which is to be
covered[13] (see Fig. 11). Dr. Boas argues that their purpose is to get in all the received
symbols, or to show the whole animal, but, however this may be, every variation introduces
symmetry even where it is difficult to do so, as in the case, for instance, of bracelets, hat-brims,
etc. (Fig. 10). This may in some cases be due to the symmetrical suggestions of the human body
in tattooing,[14] but it must be so in comparatively few.

The primitive picture has for its object not only to impart information, but to excite the
very definite pleasure of recognition of a known object. All explorers agree in their accounts
of the savage's delight in his own naïve efforts at picture making. All such drawings show
in varying degrees the same characteristics; first of all, an entire lack of symmetry. In a
really great number of examples, including drawings and picture-writing from all over the world,
I have not found one which showed an attempt at symmetrical arrangement. Secondly, great life
and movement, particularly in the drawings of animals. Thirdly, an emphasis of the typical
characteristics, the logical marks, amounting sometimes to caricature. The primitive man draws
to tell a story, as children do. He gives with real power what interests him, and puts in what
he knows ought to be there, even if it is not seen, but he is so engrossed by his interest
in the imitated object as to neglect entirely its relation to a background.

Now, this very antithesis of ornament and picture is enlightening as to the dawn of æsthetic
feeling, and the strongest confirmation of our hypothesis of an original impulse to symmetry
in art. In the ornamentation of objects the content or meaning of the design is already supplied
by the merest hint of the symbol which is the practical motive of all ornamentation. The savage
artist need, therefore, concern himself no more about it, and the form of his design is free
to take whatever shape is demanded either by the conditions of technique and the surface to
be ornamented, or by the natural æsthetic impulse. We have found that technical conditions
account for only a small part of the observed symmetry in pattern, and the inference to a natural
tendency to symmetry is clear. Pictorial representation, on the other hand, is enjoyed by the
primitive man merely as an imitation, of which he can say, 'This is that animal'--to paraphrase
Aristotle's Poetics. He is thus constrained to reproduce the form as it shows meaning, and
to ignore it as form, or as his natural motor impulses would make it. In short it is impossible
to account for more than a small part of the marked symmetry of primitive art by non-æsthetic
influences, and we are therefore forced to conclude an original tendency to create symmetry,
and to take pleasure in it. A strong negative confirmation of this is given, as noted above,
by the utter lack of symmetry of the only branch of art in which the primitive man is fully
preoccupied with meaning to the neglect of shape; and by the contrast of this with those branches
of art in which attention to meaning is at its minimum.

The question put at the beginning of this section must thus be answered affirmatively. There
is evidence of an original æsthetic pleasure in symmetry.

III. EXPERIMENTS IN SUBSTITUTIONAL SYMMETRY.

A. Method of Experiment.

A certain degree of original æsthetic pleasure in symmetry may be considered to have been established
by the preceding section, and, without considering further the problems of real or geometrical
symmetry, it may now be asked whether the pleasure aroused by the form of asymmetrical objects
is not at bottom also pleasure in symmetry; whether, in other words, a kind of substitution
of factors does not obtain in such objects, which brings about a psychological state similar
to that produced by real symmetry.

The question what these substituted factors may be can perhaps be approached by a glance at
a few pictures which are accepted as beautiful in form, although not geometrically symmetrical.
Let us take, for instance, several simple pictures from among the well-known altar-pieces,
all representing the same subject, the Madonna Enthroned with Infant Christ, and all of generally
symmetrical outline. It seems, then, reasonable to assume that if the variations from symmetry
show constantly recurring tendencies, they represent the chief factors in such a substitutional
symmetry or balance, supposing it to exist. The following pictures are thus treated in detail,
M. denoting Madonna; C., Child; and Cn., Central Line. The numbers refer to the collection
of reproductions used exclusively in this investigation, and further described in section IV.

1. 56, Martin Schöngauer: Madonna in Rose-arbor. M. is seated exactly in Cn., C. on Right,
turning to Right. M. turns to Left, and her long hair and draperies form one long unbroken
line down to Left lower corner. All other details symmetrical.

2. 867, Titian: Madonna. The picture is wider than it is high. M. stands slightly to Right
of Cn.; C. on Right. Both turn slightly to Left, and the drapery of M. makes a long sweep to
Left. Also a deep perspective occupies the whole Left field.

3. 248, Raphael: Madonna (The Bridgewater Madonna). M. sits in Cn., turning to Left; C. lies
across her lap, head to Left, but his face turned up to Right, and all the lines of his body
tending sharply down to Right.

In 1, all the elements of the picture are symmetrical except the position of C. on the Right,
and the long flowing line to Left. In 2, there is a slightly greater variation. The mass of
the figures is to Right, and the C. entirely over against the deep perspective and the flowing
line on the Left, and the direction of both faces toward that side. In 3, the greater part
of C.'s figure on Left is opposed by the direction of his lines and movement to Right. Thus
these three pictures, whether or not they are considered as presenting a balance, at least
show several well-defined factors which detach themselves from the general symmetrical scheme.
(1) Interest in C. is opposed by outward-pointing line; (2) greater mass, by outward-pointing
line, deep vista, and direction of attention; and (3) again interest by direction of line and
suggestion of movement.

This analysis of several æsthetically pleasing but asymmetrical arrangements of space strongly
suggests that the elements of large size, deep perspective, suggested movement, and intrinsic
interest are in some way equivalent in their power to arouse those motor impulses which we
believe to constitute the basis of æsthetic response. It is the purpose of these experiments
to follow up the lines of these suggestions, reducing them to their simplest forms and studying
them under exact conditions.

But before describing the instruments and methods of this experimental treatment, I wish to
speak of the articles on the 'Æsthetics of Simple Form,' published as Studies from the Harvard
Psychological Laboratory, by Dr. Edgar Pierce.[15] These articles, sub-entitled 'Symmetry'
and 'The Functions of the Elements' seem at first sight to anticipate the discussions of this
paper; but a short analysis shows that while they point in the same direction, they nevertheless
deal with quite different questions and in a different manner. In the statement of his problem,
indeed, Dr. Pierce is apparently treading the same path.

   [15] Pierce E.: PSYCH. REV., 1894, I., p. 483; 1896, III., p.
   270.

He says: "Can a feeling of symmetry, that is, of æsthetical equality of the two halves, remain
where the two sides are not geometrically identical; and if so, what are the conditions under
which this can result--what variations of one side seem æsthetically equal to the variations
of the other side?" Some preliminary experiments resulted in the conclusion that an unsymmetrical
and yet pleasing arrangement of a varied content rests on the pleasure in unity, thus shutting
out the Golden Section choice, which depends on the pleasure in variety. That is, the choices
made will not in general follow the golden section, but 'when the figure consists of two halves,
the pleasure must be a feeling of æsthetical symmetry.'

The final experiments were arrangements of lines and simple figures on a square, black background
in which the center was marked by a white vertical line with a blue or a red line on each side.
On one side of these central lines a line was fixed; and the subject had to place on the other
side lines and simple figures of different sizes and different colors, so as to balance the
fixed line. The results showed that lines of greater length, or figures of greater area must
be put nearer the center than shorter or smaller ones--'A short line must be farther than a
long one, a narrow farther than a wide, a line farther than a square; an empty interval must
be larger than one filled, and so on.' And for colors, "blue, maroon and green, the dark colors,
are the farthest out; white, red and orange, the bright colors, are nearest the center. This
means that a dark color must be farther out than a bright one to compensate for a form on the
other side. The brightness of an object is then a constant substitute for its distance in satisfying
our feeling of symmetry."

Now from these conclusions two things are clear. By his extremely emphasized central line,
and his explicit question to the subjects, 'Does this balance?' the author has excluded any
other point of view than that of mechanical balance. His central fulcrum is quite overpowering.
Secondly, his inquiry has dealt only with size and color, leaving the questions of interest,
movement, and perspective untouched. But just the purpose of this experimental study is to
seek for the different and possibly conflicting tendencies in composition, and to approximate
to the conditions given in pictorial art. It is evident, I think, that the two studies on symmetry
will not trespass on each other's territory. The second paper of Dr. Pierce, on 'The Functions
of the Elements,' deals entirely with the relation of horizontal and vertical positions of
the æsthetic object and of the subject to æsthetic judgments, and has therefore no bearing
on this paper.

For his apparatus Dr. Pierce used a surface of black cloth stretched over black rubber, 1 m.
square. Now an investigation which is to deal with complicated and varied relations, resembling
those of pictures, demands an instrument resembling them also in the shape of the background.
A rectangle 600 mm. broad by 400 mm. high seemed to meet this requirement better than the square
of Dr. Pierce. Other parts, also, of his instrument seemed unfitted for our purpose. The tin,
5 cm. broad and confined to the slits across the center of the square, gave not enough opportunity
for movement in a vertical direction, while the scale at the back was very inconvenient for
reading. To supply these lacks, a scale graduated in millimeters was attached on the lower
edge of the board, between a double track in which ran slides, the positions of which could
be read on the scale. To the slides were attached long strips of tin covered with black cloth.
On these strips figures glued to small clamps or clasps could be slipped up or down; this arrangement
of coördinates made it possible to place a figure in any spot of the whole surface without
bringing the hands into the field of view. The experiments were made in a dark room, in which
the apparatus was lighted by an electric globe veiled by white paper and hung above and behind
the head of the subject, so as not to be seen by him and to cast no shadow: in this soft light
of course the black movable strips disappeared against the black background. A gray paper frame
an inch and a half wide was fitted to the black rectangle to throw it up against the black
depths of the dark room--thus giving in all details the background of a picture to be composed.

The differences in method between the two sets of experiments were fundamental. In Dr. Pierce's
experiments the figures were pulled from one side to the other of the half-square in question,
and the subject was asked to stop them where he liked; in those of the writer the subject himself
moved the slides back and forth until a position was found æsthetically satisfactory. The subject
was never asked, Does this balance? He was indeed requested to abstract from the idea of balance,
but to choose that position which was the most immediately pleasing for its own sake, and so
far as possible detached from associations.

I have said that Dr. Pierce intentionally accentuated the center. The conditions of pictorial
composition suggest in general the center only by the rectangular frame. Most of my experiments
were, therefore, made without any middle line; some were repeated with a middle line of fine
white silk thread, for the purpose of ascertaining the effect of the enhanced suggestion of
the middle line.

But the chief difference came in the different treatment of results. Dr. Pierce took averages,
whereas the present writer has interpreted individual results. Now, suppose that one tendency
led the subject to place the slide at 50 and another to place it at 130 mm. from the center.
The average of a large number of such choices would be 90--a position very probably disagreeable
in every way. For such an investigation it was evident that interpretation of individual results
was the only method possible, except where it could be conclusively shown that the subjects
took one and only one point of view. They were always encouraged to make a second choice if
they wished to do so, as it often happened that one would say: 'I like both of these ways very
much.' Of course, individual testimony would be of the highest importance, and a general grouping
into classes and indication of the majority tendency would be the only way to treat the results
statistically. And indeed in carrying out the experiments this caution was found absolutely
necessary. In all but one or two of the sections, the taking of averages would have made the
numerical results absolutely unintelligible. Only the careful study of the individual case,
comparison of various experiments on the same person to find personal tendencies, and comparison
of the different tendencies, could give valuable results for the theory of symmetry.

The first question to be taken up was the influence of right and left positions on choice.
A long series of experiments was undertaken with a line 80×10 mm. on one side and a line 160×10
mm. on the other, in which the positions of these were reversed, and each in turn taken as
fixed and variable, with a view to determining the effect of right and left positions. No definite
conclusions emerged; and in the following experiments, most of which have been made for both
right and left positions, the results will be treated as if made for one side alone, and, where
averages are taken, will be considered as indifferently left or right.

The experiments of Dr. Pierce were made for only one position of the fixed line--at 12 cm.
distance from the center. The characteristic of the following experiments is their reference
to all positions of the fixed line. For instance a fixed line, 10 cm. in length at 12 cm. distance
from the center, might be balanced by a line 5 cm. in length at 20 cm. distance. But would
the distance be in the same proportion for a given distance of the fixed line of say 20 or
25 cm.? It is clear that only a progressive series of positions of the fixed line would suggest
the changes in points of view or tendencies of choice of the subject. Accordingly, for all
the experiments the fixed line or other object was placed successively at distances of 20,
40, 60 mm., etc., from the center; or at 40, 80 mm., etc., according to the character of the
object, and for each of these fixed points the subject made one or two choices. Only an understanding
of the direction in which the variable series moved gave in many cases an explanation for the
choice.

Each choice, it should be added, was itself the outcome of a long series of trials to find
the most pleasing position. Thus, each subject made only about ten choices in an hour, each
of which, as it appears in the tables, represents a large number of approximations.

B. Experiments on Size.

I have said that different tendencies or types of choice in arrangement appeared. It will be
convenient in the course of explaining in detail the method of experiment, to discuss at the
same time the meaning of these types of choice.

From analysis of the pictures, the simplest suggestion of balance appeared in the setting off
against each other of objects of different sizes;--an apparent equivalence of a large object
near the center with a small object far from the center; thus inevitably suggesting the relations
of the mechanical balance, or lever, in which the heavy short arm balances the light long arm.
This was also the result of Dr. Pierce's experiments for one position of his fixed line. The
experiments which follow, however, differ in some significant points from this result. The
instrument used was the one described in the preceding section. On one side, in the middle
of the vertical strip, was placed the 'fixed' line, denoted by F., and the subject moved the
'variable' line, denoted by V., until he found the arrangement æsthetically pleasing. The experimenter
alone placed F. at the given reading, and read off the position of V. After the choice F. was
placed at the next interval, V. was again tried in different positions, and so on. In the following
tables the successive positions of F. are given in the left column, reading downward, and the
corresponding positions of V. in the right column. The different choices are placed together,
but in case of any preference the second choice is indicated. The measurements are always in
millimeters. Thus, F. 40, V. 60, means that F. is 40 mm. to one side of the center, and V.
60 mm. to the opposite side. F. 80×10, V. 160×10, means that the white cardboard strips 80
mm.×10 mm., etc., are used. The minus sign prefixed to a reading means that the variable was
placed on the side of the fixed line. An X indicates æsthetic dislike--refusal to choose. An
asterisk (*) indicates a second choice.

The following tables are specimen sets made by the subjects C, O, and D.

  200   96, 36         25, 36            177,--146,--148, 230

Now, on Dr. Pierce's theory, the variable in the first set should be nearer the center, since
it is twice the size of the fixed line;--but the choices V. 120, 166, 130 for F. 40; V. 110,
104, 102, 126 for F. 80; V. 128 for F. 120; V. 196 for F. 160; V. 230, 220 for F. 200, show
that other forces are at work. If these variations from the expected were slight, or if the
presence of second choices did not show a certain opposition or contrast between the two positions,
they might disappear in an average. But the position of F. 40, over against V. 120, 166, 130,
is evidently not a chance variation. Still more striking are the variations for I. (b). Here
we should expect the variable, being smaller, to be farther from the center. But for F. 40,
we have V. 27, 34; for F. 80, all nearer but two; for F. 120, V. 60, 56, 48, 82, 70; for F.
160, V. 29, 74, 16, 77, 138, and for F. 200, V. 96, 36, 25, 36, 177--while several positions
on the same side of the center as the constant show a point of view quite irreconcilable with
mechanical balance.

  180-200     90         X             X,  X      50

Here the variable should supposedly be the farther out; but we have V. 58, 20 for F. 40-60;
V. 48, 40, 56 for F. 60; V. 64, 70, 87 for F. 80; no larger choice for F. 100-120; indeed,
from this point on everything nearer, and very much nearer. We can trace in these cases, more
clearly perhaps than in the preceding, the presence of definite tendencies. O and P, from positions
in accord with the mechanical theory, approach the center rapidly; while C is seldom 'mechanical,'
but very slowly recedes from the center. The large number of refusals to choose assures us
that the subjects demand a definitely pleasant arrangement--in other words, that every choice
is the expression of a deliberate judgment.

Taking again the experiments 1. (a) and 1. (b), and grouping the results for nine subjects,
C, O, A, S, H, G, D, and P, we obtain the following general types of choice. The experiments
were repeated by each subject, so that we have eighteen records for each position. I should
note here that preliminary experiments showed that near the frame the threshold of difference
of position was 10 mm., or more, while near the center it was 4 or 5 mm.; that is, arrangements
were often judged symmetrically equal which really differed by from 4 to 10 mm., according
as they were near to or far from the center. In grouping types of choice, therefore, choices
lying within these limits will be taken as belonging to the same type.

   160 X 10 where the variable 80 X 10 has been placed at or near
   40, thus giving the same arrangement as for 1. (a).

It might be objected that a group 40-65 (2-3) would not be larger than one of 100-136 (4),
but the break between 45 and 62 shows the zones not continuous. Moreover, as said above, the
positions far from the center have a very large difference threshold.

On comparing the different groups, we find that in 1 and 2 there is a decided preference for
a position somewhat less than half way between center and frame--more sharply marked for 1
than for 2. From 3 onward there is a decided preference for the mechanical arrangement, which
would bring the larger strip nearer. Besides this, however, there are groups of variations,
some very near the center, others approaching to symmetry. The maintenance of geometrical symmetry
at a pretty constant ratio is to be noted; as also the presence of positions on the same side
of the center as the fixed line. Before discussing the significance of these groups we may
consider the results of Experiment II. (F. double line 80×10, V. single line 80×10) without
giving complete lists.

We notice therein, first of all, the practical disappearance of the symmetrical choice; for
F. 40-60, 60-80, 80-100, a tendency, decreasing, however, with distance from the center, to
the mechanical arrangement; for F. 100-120, and all the rest, not one mechanical choice, and
the positions confined almost entirely to the region 35-75. In some cases, however, the mechanical
choice for (1) 40-80, (2) 60-80, was one of two, e.g., we have for (1) 20 and 138, for (3)
70 and 162; in the last two cases the mechanical being the second choice.

Now the reversals of the mechanical choice occur for Exp. I. in 1 and 2 (F. 40 and F. 80);
that is, when the small fixed line is near the center, the larger variable is distant. For
Exp. II. the reversals, which are much more marked, occur in all cases beyond F. 40, F. 60
and F. 80; that is, when the double constant line is far from the center, the single variable
approaches. If the mechanical theory prevailed, we should have in Exp. I. the lines together
in the center, and in Exp. II. both near the fringe.

From the individual testimony, based both on I. (a) and I. (b), it appears that subject M is
perfectly uniform in mechanical choice when the fixed line is the small line--i.e. when it
moves out, the larger is placed near the center; but when the conditions of mechanical choice
would demand that, as the larger fixed line moves out, the small variable one should move out
farther, he regularly chooses the reverse. Nevertheless, he insists that in just these cases
he has a feeling of equilibrium.

A also takes the mechanical choice as the small fixed line goes farther from the center; but
when the fixed line is large and leaves the center, he reverses the mechanical choice--evidently
because it would take the small line too far out. As he says, 'he is always disturbed by too
large a black space in the center.'

G almost always takes the mechanical choice;--in one whole set of experiments, in which the
fixed line is the large line, he reverses regularly.

H takes for F. (80×10) the mechanical choice only for the positions F. 160 and F. 200--i.e.,
only when F. is very far from the center and he wishes V. (160×10) nearer. For F. (160×10)
he makes six such choices out of ten, but for positions F. 160 and F. 200 he has V. 44, 65 and 20.

S takes for F. (160×10) at F. 120, V. 185 and-70; says of V. 185, which is also his choice
for F. (160×10) at F. 80, 'I cannot go out further, because it is so hard to take in the whole
field.' For F. (160×10) at F. 200, he has V. 130 and 60; says of V. 60, 'Very agreeable elements
in connection with the relation of the two lines.'

C takes for F. (80×10) only one mechanical choice until it is at F. 120. Then always mechanical,
i.e., nearer center; for F. (160×10) makes after the position F. 40 no mechanical choice, i.e.,
V. is nearer center.

It is evident from the above tables and individual cases that the reversals from the mechanical
choice occur only when the mechanical choice would bring both lines in the center, or both
near the edges, and the subjective testimony shows from what point of view this appears desirable.
The subjects wish 'to take in the whole field,' they wish 'not to be disturbed by too large
a black space in the center'; and when, in order to cover in some way the whole space, the
small line is drawn in or the large one pushed out, they have, nevertheless, a feeling of equilibrium
in spite of the reversal of mechanical balance.

Accepting for the present, without seeking a further psychological explanation, the type of
'mechanical balance,' in which amount of space is a substitute for weight, as the one most
often observed, we have to seek some point of view from which this entire reversal is intelligible.
For even the feeling that 'the whole field must be covered' would hardly account for an exact
interchanging of positions. If size gives 'weight,' why does it not always do so? A simple
answer would seem to be given by the consideration that we tend to give most attention to the
center of a circumscribed space, and that any object in that center will get proportionately
more attention than on the outskirts. The small line near the center, therefore, would attract
attention by virtue of its centrality, and thus balance the large line, intrinsically more
noticeable but farther away. Moreover, all the other moments of æsthetic pleasure, derived
from the even filling of the space, would work in favor of this arrangement and against the
mechanical arrangement, which would leave a large black space in the middle.

The hypothesis, then, that the demand for the filling of the whole space without large gaps
anywhere enters into competition with the tendency to mechanical balance, and that this tendency
is, nevertheless, reconciled with that demand through the power of a central position to confer
importance, would seem to fit the facts. It is, of course, clear that neither 'mechanical balance'
nor the balance of 'central' with 'intrinsic' importance have been yet accounted for on psychological
grounds; it is sufficient at this point to have established the fact of some kind of balance
between elements of different qualities, and to have demonstrated that this balance is at least
not always to be translated into the 'mechanical' metaphor.

C. Experiments on Movement.

In the preceding experiments the element of size was isolated, and it was sought to discover,
in pleasing combinations of objects of different sizes, the presence of some kind of balance
and the meaning of different tendencies of arrangement. The relative value of the two objects
was taken as determined on the assumption, supported by common sense, that under like conditions
a large object is given more attention than a small one. If the unequal objects seem to balance
each other, then the only other condition in which they differ, their distance from the center,
must be the cause of their balancing. Thus the influence of relative position, being the only
unknown quantity in this balance-equation, is easily made out.

The following experiments will deal with the as yet quite undetermined elements of suggested
movement, perspective and intrinsic interest. By combining objects expressing them, each with
another simple object of the same size, another equation will be obtained in which there is
only one unknown quantity, the sizes of the objects being equal and the influence of relative
position being at least clearly indicated.

1. Movement.

The experiments on suggestion of movement were made by C, O and P. Suggestions of movement
in pictures are of two kinds--given by lines pointing in a direction which the eye of the spectator
tends to follow, and by movement represented as about to take place and therefore interpreted
as the product of internal energy. Thus, the tapering of a pyramid would give the first kind
of suggestion, the picture of a runner the second kind. Translated into terms of experiment,
this distinction would give two classes dealing with (A) the direction of a straight line as
a whole, and (B) the expression of internal energy by a curve or part of a line. In order to
be able to change the direction of a straight line at a given point, a strip of tin two inches
long was fastened by a pivot to the usual clasp which slipped up and down on the vertical black
strip. The tin strip could be moved about the pivot by black threads fastened to its perforated
ends. A strip of cardboard glued upon it would then take its direction. The first experiments,
made with the usual 80×10 strip, proved very disagreeable. The subject was much disturbed by
the blunt ends of the strip. The variable (pivoted) line was then slightly pointed at the upper
end, and in the final experiments, in which both are oblique, both strips were pointed at each
end. In Exp. III. a line pointing at an angle from the perpendicular was set over against a
line of the same dimensions in the ordinary position.

    Exp. III. (a) F. (80×10) pointed up toward center at 145°,
    V. (80×10).

    F. 40:--(1) 39 48 48, (2) 60 66 68, (3) 97 97, (4) 156* 168*.

    F. 60:--(1) 45, (2) 60 62 65 68 90, (3) 90 94, (4) 117 128 152
    155.

    F. 80:--(1) 50 44*, (2) 74 76 77, (3) 94 100 106 113 115 116,
    (4) 123 124* 140 165* 169*.

    F. 100:--(1) 36 58 60 65* 65 74 77 80 87, (2) 98 108 118, (3)
    114* 168 186* 170 136*.

    F. 120:--(1) 40 46 54 60 63 76 96 97 111, (2) 115 120 126*
    137*, (3) 170 170*.

    F. 140:--(1) 45 52 65 65 76 76 86 90, (2) 109 111, (3) 125
    140*, (4) 168*.

    F. 160:--(1) 38 50 50 60, (2) 80 90 96 98 98, (3) 176*.

    F. 180:--(1) 21 23, (2) 54 70 84 90, (3) 100 100 108 114 120,
    (4) 130 145*.

    F. 200:--(1) -2, (2) 33 37 50, (3) 106 110 to 120 115 120 130
    132 138 142.

The most striking point about these groups is the frequency of positions far from the center
when F. also is far out. At F. 120, a position at which the mechanical choice usually prevails
if F. is smaller, a very marked preference indeed appears for positions of V. nearer the center--in
fact, there is only one opposing (first) choice. Now, if it is not the wide space otherwise
left which pulls the variable in,--and we see from a note that the subjects have no feeling
of a large empty space in the center,--it must be that F. has the same effect as if it were
really smaller than V., that is, mechanically 'light.' We see, in fact, that the moment F.
has passed the point, between 80 and 100, at which both lines close together in the center
would be disagreeable, the preference is marked for inner positions of V., and I repeat that
this cannot be for space-filling reasons, from the testimony of F. 200 (3).

And this 'lightness' of the line pointed in at 45° is indeed what we should have expected a
priori since we found that objective heaviness is balanced by a movement out from the center
on the mechanical principle. If movement out and objective heaviness are in general alike in
effect, then movement in and objective lightness should be alike in effect, as we have found
to be the case from the preceding experiments. The inward-pointed line does not actually move
in, it is true, but it strongly suggests the completion of the movement. It enters into the
'mechanical' equation--it appears to balance--as if it had moved.

The point, however, in which this 'lightness' of the inward-pointed line differs from that
of the small or short line is its space-filling quality. It suggests movement in a certain
direction, and, while giving the mechanical effect of that movement as completed, seems also
in a sense to cover that space. We see from F. 180 (3), (4), and 200 (3), that the subject
does not shrink from large spaces between the lines, and does not, as in Exp. I. (a), 4 and
5, bring the variable, which in both cases is evidently 'heavier,' to the center. This must
be from the fact that the empty space does not in this experiment feel empty--it is filled
with energy of the suggested movement. This view is confirmed by the dislike which the subjects
show to the position F. 40; F., being 'lighter,' but the object of attention as close to the
center, might well balance V. far out. But as if the whole variable field would be in that
case 'overfilled,' the records show 50 per cent. of refusals to choose for this position.

In brief, then, a straight line suggesting movements in a certain direction has the effect,
in the general scheme of mechanical balance, of a static position in which this movement has
been carried out, with the added suggestion of the filling of the space over which such movement
is suggested.

A few additional experiments were made with a point on the upper end of V. The groups of III.
(a) are maintained almost exactly: F. 120 is again strikingly 'mechanical'; after F. 120 there
are only two mechanical choices out of nineteen; while for F. 40, as in Exp. III. (a), out
of six choices, four are either refusals or question-marked.

Exp. IV. Both lines took oblique directions, and, to get a pleasing effect, were pointed at
both ends. They were of the usual size, 80×10 mm., but 1 mm. broader to allow for the effect
of length given by the points. F. was fixed at 45°, as in III. (a), on the points 40, 80, 120
and 160; V. moved also on fixed points, 60, 100, 140, 180, for each position of F., but on
each point was adjusted at a pleasing angle. Thus, there were four positions of V. to each
of F., each with one or two angular positions; V. was always in the first quadrant.

The numbers of the table give the angular degrees of V.

  F. 40, V. 60:--(1) 10 12 38 44, (2) 50 57* 60, (3) 70.
     V. 100:--(1) 15 15 30 30, (2) 50 55 50, (3) 69 70*.
     V. 140:--(1) 12* 14 18 18, (2) 60 60 49, (3) 72.
     V. 180:--(1) 12 10 38, (2) 60 50, (3) 75.
        [Many refusals at 140 and 180.]

  F. 80, V. 60:--(1) 11, (2) 25 35 36*, (3) 45 48 55 58 60, (4) 69.
     V. 100:--(1) 16 15, (2) 24 27 35 40, (3) 52, (4) 62 74*.
     V. 140:--(1) 10 15 16, (2) 22 28, (3) 40 40 59 59, (4) 70.
     V. 180:--(1) 14 8, (2) 28, (3) 41 46, (4) 68 79.

  F. 120, V. 60: (1) 28, (2) 42 44 35, (3) 52 58 62 65 65.
     V. 100:--(1) 9, (2) 23 25, (3) 38 40 40 42 58, (4) 68 70.
     V. 140:--(1) 10, (2) 20 26 21* 24 29, (3) 34 42 42 44 55*, (4) 75.
     V. 180:--(1) 17 26, (2) 40 42 46, (3) 62 64 70 70*.

  F. 160, V. 60:--(1) 20 39, (2) 18, (3) 58 60 64 68 70.
     V. 100:--(1) 23 25 30 38, (2) 44 44 49, (3) 55 58 65.
     V. 140:--(1) 5, (2) 31 35 40 40 32, (3) 54 55 68.
     V. 180:--(1) 50 50 58 60, (2) 75.

The tendency to mechanical balance would, according to our previous analysis, lead the variable
to take a direction which, in its suggestion of motion inward, should be more or less strong
according as it were farther from or nearer to the center than the fixed line. Such motion
inward would, of course, be more strongly suggested by an angle less than 45° than by an angle
greater than 45°, and it seems that the angles chosen are in general in harmony with this expectation.
For the positions where F. is nearer the center than V. there is a preponderance of the angles
less than 45° (cf. F. 40 and F. 80, V. 100 and 140; F. 120, V. 140, 180). When V. passes over
to a position farther from the center than F. (e.g., from F. 80, V. 60, to F. 80, V. 100 and
from F. 120, V. 60, to F. 120, V. 140) the change is marked. In every case where F. is farther
from the center than V. (i.e., F. 80, V. 60; F. 120, V. 60 and V. 100; F. 160, V. 60, V. 100
and V. 140), there are to be noticed a lack of the very small angles and a preponderance of
the middle and larger angles. F. 160, V. 140 and 180 seem to be the only exceptions, which
are easily explainable by a dislike of the extremely small angle near the edge; for it appears
from the remarks of the subjects that there is always a subconsciousness of the direction suggested
by the lower pointed end of the line. For the outer positions of both lines, a large angle
would leave the center empty, and a small one would be disagreeable for the reason just given;
and so we find, indeed, for F. 160, V. 100, 140, 160, the middle position the favorite one.

The representation of action may be translated into experimental terms by expressing it as
a line which changes its direction, thus seeming to be animated by some internal energy. The
forms chosen were three curves 'bulging' from a straight line in differing degrees, and two
straight lines with projections. C and O were the subjects. The results are given in outline.

    Exp. V. Curve I. See Fig. 12, I

    (1) Curve out (turned away from center).

    (a) F. (80×10), V. Curve.

    About half the positions of V. are farther from the center
    than F. O at first refuses to choose, then up to F. 120 puts
    V. farther from the center than F. C has a set of positions
    of V. nearer the center and several second choices farther
    than F.

    (b) F. Curve, V. (80×10).

    No position of V. nearer center than F. O puts line farther
    out up to F. 160, then nearer than F. C has a set of nearly
    symmetrical choices and another where V. is much farther out
    than F.

    (2) Curve in (turned toward center).

    (a) F. (80×10), V. Curve.

    C is absolutely constant in putting V. farther from center
    than F. O, after F. 100, brings it slightly nearer.

    (b) F. Curve, V. (80×10).

    C, except for F. 40, invariably puts V. nearer center than
    F. O moves between 90 and 135, putting V. farther to F.
    100, nearly symmetrical at F. 100 and 120, and after F. 120,
    from 100 to 135.

    Exp. V. Curve II. See Fig. 12, II.

    (1) Curve out.

    (a) F. (80×10), V. Curve.

    In every case but one V. is nearer center than F.

    (b) F. Curve, V. (80×10).

    C puts V. farther from center than F. O puts V. farther or
    symmetrical up to F. 120, then nearer than F.

    (2) Curve in.

    (a) F. 80×10, V. Curve.

    C has V. always farther from center than F., but a second
    parallel set, omitting F. 40 (all second choices), of
    symmetrical positions. O begins with V. farther from center,
    but from F. 120 has V. always nearer, though gradually
    receding from the center.

    (b) F. Curve. V. (80×10).

    C, refusing for F. 40, continues his parallel sets, one with
    V. always nearer than F., another with symmetrical positions.
    O begins with V. nearer, changes at F. 120, and continues
    with V. farther.

Recapitulating these results, grouping together the outward and inward positions of the curves,
and indicating the distance of the line from the center by C.-L., and of the curve from the
center by C.-Cv., we have:

Out.

Cv. I.  (a)  Indeterminate.
        (b)  C.-Cv. < C.-L. (except where large gap would be left).

Cv. II. (a)  C.-Cv. < C.-L. (all cases but one).
        (b)  C.-Cv. < C.-L. (except where large gap would be left).

In.

Cv. I. (a)  C.-Cv. > C.-L. (except a few cases to avoid gap).
       (b)  C.-Cv. > C.-L. (more than half of cases).

Cv. II. (a)  C.-Cv. > C.-L. (except a few cases to avoid gap).
        (b)  C.-Cv. > C.-L. (except  a few cases to avoid gap).

It is evident that in the great majority of cases when the curve turns out it is placed nearer
the center, when it turns in, farther from the center, than the straight line. The numerical
differences for choices of the same type for the two curves are slight, but regular, and the
general tendencies are more sharply marked for the line of greater curvature. When Curve II.
is 'out,' it is usually nearer the center than Curve I. for the corresponding positions of
the straight line; when 'in' it is always farther from the center than Curve I. The greater
curvature of II. has clearly produced this difference, and the effect of the curvature in general
is evidently to make its side 'lighter' when turned toward the center, and 'heavier' when turned
away. Thus, all but the exceptions already noted seem to belong to the mechanically balanced
arrangement, in which the suggestion of force working in the direction of the curve has the
same effect as, in Exp. IV., the direction of the line. The exceptions noted, especially numerous
choices of O, seem governed by some fixed law. The evidence would seem to be overwhelming that
the reversals of the mechanical balance occur only where the lines would be crowded together
in the center or would leave an empty gap there. The remaining exceptions--the symmetrical
choices mentioned, made by C--are explained by him as follows. He says there are two ways of
regarding the curve, (1) as a striving in the direction of the 'bulge,' and (2) as the expression
of a power that presses together; and that the usual choices are the result of the first point
of view, the symmetrical choices of the second. Naturally, a pressure bending down the line
would be conceived as working in a vertical direction, and the line would be treated as another
(80×10)--giving, as is the case, symmetrical positions. Thus, we may consider the principle
of the suggestion of movement by a curve, as giving the same effect as if the movement suggested
had actually taken place, to have been established, the positive evidence being strong, and
the exceptions accounted for. It is worth noting that the curve-out series are always more
irregular--the subject repeating that it is always harder to choose for that position. Probably
the demands of space-filling come into sharper conflict with the tendency to mechanical balance,
which for the outward curve would always widely separate the two lines.

Exp. V. Curve III. See Fig. 12, III.

A series with the upper end turned out from the center was unanimously pronounced as ugly.
The inward position only appears in the results, which are given in full.

(a) F. (80×10), V. CURVE.

  F.                V.
             O.               C.

   40     106 126       68  73
   80     106 128      109 102
  120     140  88      156 110* 154   72*
  160     104  66      182  80  136* 130*
  200       X  52      178 220* 162

(b) F. CURVE, V. (80×10)

  F.                V.
              O.              C.

   40     126 122        73  80
   80     122 128        66 112* 40
  120      90 116        97 156* 55 105
  160      65  43       120 182* 87 134
  200      70  50       148  66

This curve exemplifies the same principles as the preceding. O takes the natural mechanical
choice from (a) F. 40 to F. 120, and from (b) F. 120 to F. 200. A mechanical choice, however,
for (a) F. 120 ff., and for (b) F. 40 to F. 120, would have brought the lines too far apart
in (a), and too near together in (b), hence the reversal. C inclines always to the mechanical
choice, but recognizes the other point of view in his second choices.

Exp. V. Curve IV. See Fig. 12, IV.

    Curve in.

    (a) F. (80×10), V. Curve.

    C puts V. always further than F. and, even for F. 200, has
    V. 230, X. O puts V. farther up to F. 120, then puts it
    nearer than F., and always refuses to choose for F. 200.

    (b) F. Curve, V. (80×10).

    C always puts V. nearer than F. O puts V. farther for F.
    40 and F. 80, beyond that, nearer than F.; but refuses to
    choose once each for F. 40, and F. 200.

    The same principles of choice appear. C maintains the
    mechanical choice, and O reverses it only beyond (a) F.
    120, and up to (b) F. 120, to fill space well, showing his
    preference for the mechanical choice by changing into it at an
    unusually early point.

Exp. V. Curve V. See Fig. 12, V.

    Curve in.

    (a) F. (80×10), V. Curve.

    C puts V. farther than F., except for F. 200, V. 125 and X.
    O also, changing as usual at F. 120 to V. nearer than F.

    (b) F. Curve, V. (80×10).

    O puts V. always farther than F. O has V. farther for F.
    40 and F. 80, then nearer than F. Refuses to choose for F.
    200. Results exactly parallel with those of Curve IV.

Comparing all the results of this whole series of experiments on the suggestion of movement,
we may conclude that movement, whether suggested by a whole line or part of a line, produces
in terms of mechanical balance the same effect that the balanced object would produce after
the completion of the suggested motion. This tendency to balance, it appears, lies at the basis
of our preference; it often gives way, however, before considerations of space-filling, when
the figure which on the scheme of mechanical balance is weaker, gains interest and so 'heaviness'
by being brought nearer the center.

D. Experiments on Interest.

By intrinsic interest is meant the interest which would attach to an object quite apart from
its place in the space composition. In a picture it would be represented by the interest in
an important person, in an unusual object, or in an especially beautiful object, if that beauty
were independent of the other forms in the picture--as, for instance, a lovely face, or a jeweled
goblet, etc. When the question of the influence of interest on composition came to be discussed,
it was found very difficult to abstract the form of the object from the content presented;
still more difficult to obtain an effect of interest at all without the entrance of an element
of form into the space arrangement. Disembodied intellectual interest was the problem, and
the device finally adopted seemed to present, in as indifferent a form as possible, a content
whose low degree of absolute interest was compensated for by constant change. Stamps of various
countries in black and white reproductions and very small outline pictures on squares of the
same size as the stamps were taken as material. The figures were so small in relation to the
board that any influence on composition of the lines composing them was impossible; the outline
pictures, indeed, gave to the eye which abstracted from their content an impression scarcely
stronger than the neighboring blank square.

The first set of experiments (VI.) had a small outline picture on the side, and on the other
a white paper square of the same size. The necessary interest was given in the form of novelty
by changing the picture for every choice. The subjects were M, G and D. The results were of
the same type for each subject and could therefore be averaged.

Exp. VI. (1).

    (a) F. Picture, V. Blank. Eight choices for each. M,
    Average: V. 17 mm. farther from center. G, Average: V. 10
    mm. farther from center. (Symmetrical position beyond F. 120.)
    D, Average: V. 25.8 mm. farther from center.

   (b) F. Blank, V. Picture. M, Average: V. 33 mm. nearer
   center. G, Average: V. 4 mm. nearer center. (Symmetrical
   beyond F. 120.) D, Average: V. 30 mm. nearer center. (But V.
   farther at F. 40.)

These results are practically unanimous. They show that an object which possesses intrinsic
interest acts like a mechanically heavy object, being placed nearer the center than a blank.
Two marked deviations from the mechanical choice occur--although they have not affected the
average sufficiently to destroy the general harmony of results. G, in both (a) and (b), chooses
symmetrical positions from F. 120 on. His notes ['(a) F. 140, V. 136, picture unimportant';
'(b) F. 120 and ff., loses relation as they separate'; '(b) F. 160, picture makes no impression']
show clearly that for positions wide apart the picture, already a faint outline, becomes only
a white square like the other and is put into geometrical symmetry.

Exp. VI. (2), by G and D. A stamp on one side unchanged, took the place of the blank; on the
other side the stamp was changed for each choice.

    (a) F. unchanged stamp; V. changed stamp.

    D. Two series, (1) V. always nearer center. (2) Same, except
    F. 20, V. 52; F. 80, V. 94; F. 140, V. 152; F. 160, V. 175.

    G. Two series. (1) V. much farther from center up to F. 140,
    then nearer. (2) V. farther throughout, except F. 160, V. 121.

    (b) F. changed stamp; V. unchanged stamp.

    D. Two series. (1) V. farther up to F. 100, then
    symmetrical. (2) V. farther up to F. 100, then symmetrical or
    nearer center.

    G. Two series. (1) V. farther up to F. 120, then
    symmetrical, and beyond F. 140, nearer center. F. 140, V. 63.
    (2) V. much farther up to F. 120, then nearer center, but more
    nearly symmetrical than (1). A complete series of second
    choices beginning at F. 40, V. slightly nearer center than F.

Analyzing results, we find the changed stamp, which has the interest of novelty, nearly always
nearer the center than the unchanged. This would indicate a balance of the mechanical type,
in which the interest makes an object 'heavier.' The exceptions are in (a) four choices of
D, G to F. 140, and in (b), D's choice beyond F. 200, and G's beyond F. 120. The deviations
are thus seen to be all of the same type: for positions of F. near the center, when a mechanical
choice would have brought V. still nearer [(a)], it is instead put farther away; for positions
of F. far from the center, when a mechanical choice would have put V. still farther away [(b)],
it is instead brought near. The exceptions are thus fully accounted for by the demand for space-filling.

E. Experiments on Depth.

The experiments on suggestion of depth in the third dimension were as follows. It was desired
to contrast two objects differing only with respect to the degree to which they expressed the
third dimension. Those objects that do express the third dimension are, in general, views down
streets, colonnades, corridors, gates, etc., or, in landscape, deep valleys, vistas between
trees, distant mountains, etc. It is evident that representations of products of human handiwork
would be less unnatural when isolated for experiment, and two pairs of pictures were accordingly
prepared as follows: There was drawn on a square of 80 mm. the picture of the mouth of a railway
tunnel, closed tightly by an apparently massive door; and another picture of identical form
and surroundings, but showing the rails entering at a slight curve, the deep blackness within,
and the small circle of light at the farther end. The second pair consisted of the gateway
of a baronial castle, with heraldic bearings and closed iron-wrought doors; and the same gateway
open, showing a flagged pavement and an open court with fountain beyond. The perspective effect
was heightened by all possible means for both pictures, and care was taken to have the contrast
of black and white the same for each pair, so that to the half-shut eye, opened and closed
forms seemed to have the same tone.

The subjects were directed to try to feel the third dimension as vividly as possible--to project
themselves down the vistas, as it were--and then to arrange the squares in the most pleasing
manner. The experiments were made by A, M, S, H and D. Not all made the same number of repetitions,
but as their notes were unusually suggestive, I have made use of all the results, and shall
quote the notes for the most part verbatim:

Exp. VIII. F. Closed Tunnel. V. Open Tunnel.

    Notes.--H finds that he neglects the closed tunnel almost
    entirely, eye is constantly attracted to open tunnel, F. 180,
    choice of evils. Position of closed tunnel makes the pictures
    disagreeable. F. 80, V. 13, closed tunnel grows more
    uninteresting as it goes out, while the open tunnel seems
    heavier than ever. F. 140, V.-1, closed tunnel loses force and
    doesn't gain weight. Open tunnel hangs together with the black
    field beyond it.

    Notes.--F. 120, V. 185. After this there is too large a
    black space between squares, and so a more central position is
    taken, but there is the necessity of avoiding symmetry, which
    is displeasing. F. 160, V. 115 is not symmetrical and so is
    more pleasing. F. 60, V. 195:--the open tunnel holds the eyes,
    while the other allows them to wander, and so it needs a
    bigger field on each side. F. 80, V. 180:--a position close
    together is possible, but it is hard to take them so except as
    one picture, and that is also difficult. F. 100, V.
    200:--there is the same objection to any position which seems
    to be an acknowledgment of similarity; that is, symmetrical
    position seems to imply that they are alike, and so is
    disagreeable. F. 120, V.-35, 200:--now they can be close
    together because the black tunnel harmonizes with the black to
    the right, and seems to correspond in distance and depth,
    while the tunnel 'hangs together' with the black to the left.
    (Cf. H, F. 160, V.--32.) F. 140, V. 20:--when they are
    together it is difficult to apperceive the frame as a whole;
    but this position is not far apart, and not disagreeable
    because the larger stretch of black to the right again hangs
    together with the tunnel. F. 160, V. 115:--when the open
    tunnel was in the middle, the closed one seemed to have no
    business at all, therefore the open tunnel had to be moved
    over. The only position which was not disagreeable.

    ¹Second pair (Court).

    Note.--(1) Quite impossible to take both together; necessary
    to keep turning from one to the other to get perception of
    depth together with both.

The subjects agree in remarking on the lack of interest of the closed tunnel, and the attractive
power of the open tunnel, and notes which emphasize this accompany choices where the open tunnel
is put uniformly nearer. (Cf. H, F. 180, V. 50; F. 80, V. 13; G, (2), (3), (4), (5); A, (3),
and F. 140.) As a glance at the results shows that the open tunnel is placed on the whole nearer
the center, we may conclude that these choices represent a mechanical balance, in which the
open tunnel, or depth in the third dimension, is 'heavier.'

But another point of view asserts itself constantly in the results of S, and scatteringly in
those of the others. Analyzing at first only the results of S, we find that up to F. 140, with
one exception, he places the open tunnel much farther out than the other; and from F. 140 on,
nearer. He says, F. 120, V. 185, 'After this there is too large a black space'; that is, in
bringing the open tunnel in, he is evidently filling space. But why does he put the open tunnel
so far out? It seems that he is governed by the desire for ease in the apperception of the
two objects. In his note for F. 80, V. 180, this point of view comes out clearly. He thinks
of the objects as being apperceived side by side with the space about each (which apparently
takes on the character of its object), and then he seems to balance these two fields. Cf. F.
60, V. 195: 'The closed tunnel allows the eyes to wander, and so it needs a bigger field on
each side.' Evidently there is an implication here of the idea of balance. Cf. also F. 120:
'The black tunnel harmonizes with the black to the right, and seems to correspond in distance
and depth,' while the closed tunnel 'hangs together with the black on the left.' In brief,
the view of F. seems to be that the closed tunnel is less interesting, and partly because it
'allows the eyes to wander,' partly as compensation for the greater heaviness of the open tunnel,
it takes with it a larger space than the open tunnel. It is on the whole better to put them
apart, because it is more difficult to apperceive them when close together, and so the open
tunnel in the earlier choices must, of course, go farther from the center. When these points
conflict with the necessity of filling space, the open tunnel comes nearer the center. In general,
the notes which emphasize the difficulty of apperceiving the two pictures as flat and deep
together accompany choices where the tunnel is put uniformly farther out, or symmetrically.
Cf. G, (1), (5); A, (1); M, F. 40, etc.

Thus we may continue to separate the two points of view, that of mechanical balance and that
of another kind of balance, which we have known heretofore as 'space-filling,' made possible
by the power of the center to give 'weight,' but which seems to be now more explicitly recognized
as a balancing of 'fields.' At this point we need repeat only, however, that the suggestion
of depth in the third dimension seems to confer 'weight,' 'heaviness,' 'balancing power' on
its object.

Before making a general survey of the results of this chapter, it is necessary to consider
a type of choice which has been up to this point consistently neglected--that in which the
variable has been placed on the same side of the center as the fixed object. On the theory
of balance, either in its simple mechanical form or in its various disguises, this choice would
at first seem to be inexplicable. And yet the subjects usually took special pleasure in this
choice, when they made it at all. These minus choices are confined to three or four subjects
and to two or three experiments. Exp. I. (a) and (b) show the largest number. We have:

    EXP. I. (a) F. (80×10); V. (160×10).
     F.                           V.
    120                   - 44,
    160                   -150, -105,  -88
    200                    -94,  -46, -110

        (b) F. (160×10); V. (80×10).
     F.                           V.
    120                      -70, -80
    160                     -114
    200                     -155, -146, -148

It will be noticed that, with two exceptions, none of the positions chosen are nearer than
70 mm. to the center, and that most of them are much farther away. The two lines seem to be
more pleasing when they are pretty close together on the same side. S, in I. (b) F. 120, V.-70,
notes: 'If V. is nearer O, there is a tendency to imagine a figure by the connection of the
ends of the two lines, which is disagreeable. 'The only other minus choices were in Exp. VII.,
by S,, H, and D. S, F. 120, V.-35, says: 'Now they can be close together,' and H, F. 140, 160
and 180, V. -1, -32, -71, notes the same. So also D, F. 100, V. -12; F. 140, V. -52; F. 160,
V. -75; F. 180, V. -95. It is evident from this insistence on the closeness together of the
objects, and this desire to form no figure, that the two are taken as one, and set off against
the blackness on the other side. It seems as if this were not taken as empty space, but acquired
a meaning of its own. The association with pictures in which the empty space is occupied by
a deep vista or an expanse of sky is almost irresistible. The case of Exp. VII. seems a little
different. S, at least, separates the two fields as usual, but for him also the black space
is living, 'corresponds in distance and depth.' It is at least certain that there is no subjective
feeling of emptiness or of unoccupied energies on the empty side. And it would seem that some
influence from the objects sweeps across the central field and vitalizes it. The most natural
view would seem to be that the ease of apperception of the two objects together, and the tendency
of the eye movement to begin on the occupied side, and to sweep across to the unoccupied, which
we think of as deep, combine to give a feeling of pleasure and of balance.

       *       *       *       *       *

We have now reached a point from which a backward glance can be cast upon the territory traversed.
Experiment with the isolated elements in pictorial composition has shown that pleasing arrangements
of these elements can be interpreted by the formula of mechanical balance. This principle was
obtained by opposing two lines whose relative value (corresponding to 'weight' in balance)
was known; and it was found that their relative positions corresponded to the relation of the
arms of a balance. Further opposition of lines, of which one was already determined in 'weight,'
showed the same variations and suggested certain valuations of the undetermined lines on the
basis of this common term of weight. Thus, the line suggesting movement out from the center
fitted the formula if taken as 'heavy' and vice versa, the line suggesting movement in, if
taken as 'light.' Similarly, objects of interest and objects suggesting movement in the third
dimension were 'heavy' in the same interpretation. But this interpretation, in its baldest
form, fitted only a majority of the pleasing arrangements; the minority, in which the consistent
carrying out of the lever principle would have left a large unoccupied space in the center,
exactly reversed it, bringing the 'light' element to the center and the 'heavy' to the outer
edge. Later experiments showed that this choice implied a power in the 'lighter' objects, owing
to their central position, to cover or infuse with vitality the empty space about them, so
that the principle of balance seemed to maintain itself in one form or another. The fact that
a small object far from the center is usually opposed by a large object near the center tells
us nothing of the real forces involved. Physical balance can be explained by principles of
mechanics, but no one will maintain that the visual representation of a long line weighs more
than that of a short one. Moreover, the elements in the balance seem utterly heterogeneous.
To this it may be answered that an object on the outskirts of a field of view so definitely
limited calls out of itself a reflex movement of the eye toward it, as truly spontaneous as
the impulse toward the object of intrinsic interest. And this expenditure of motor impulses
is pleasing, because it is the type of motor impulses most in harmony with our own physical
organism.

IV. SYMMETRY IN PICTURES.

A. The Balancing Factors.

The experimental treatment of suggestions as to the elements in pictorial composition has furnished
an hypothesis for the basis of our pleasure in a well-composed picture, and for the particular
function of each of the several elements. This hypothesis may be expressed as follows: (1)
The basis of æsthetic pleasure in composition is a balance of motor impulses on the part of
the spectator; (2) this balance of motor impulses is brought about by means of the elements,
through the power which they possess of drawing the attention with more or less strength towards
a certain field. But to the experimental working out of an hypothesis must succeed a verification,
in its application to the masterpieces of civilized art. We have, then, to ask whether there
is in all great pictures a balance, i.e., an equal distribution of attention on the two sides
of the central line suggested by the frame of the picture. It might be, for instance, that
a picture of pleasing composition would show, when analyzed, all the attractions for attention
on one side; which would go far to impugn either our hypothesis of balance as the basis of
pleasure, or our attribution of particular functions to the elements. But as this second matter
may be considered to have been sufficiently determined by the results of the preceding section,
the first question only remains: Is there a balance of attention in a good picture--or rather,
in the particular good pictures known to the student of art?

This question could only be answered by the examination of a large number of pictures of accepted
merit, and it was also desirable that they should be studied in a form which lent itself to
the easy comparison of one picture with another. These conditions seemed to be best fulfilled
by the collection of reproductions in black and white known as the Classischer Bilderschatz,
published by F. Bruckmann, at Munich, which contains over a thousand pictures arranged in schools.
Of these a thousand were taken--substantially the first thousand issued, after the frescoes,
triptych doors, panels, etc., which are evidently parts of a larger whole, had been laid aside.
In the following discussion the pictures will be designated, when they are not further described,
by the numbers which they bear in this collection.

The equations in the following discussion are based on a system of exact measurement, corresponding
to that followed in the experimental section. This numerical treatment is pre-supposed in all
the general attributions of balance in the analysis of single pictures. The method of measurement
was given by the conditions of viewing pictures, which are framed and thus isolated from surrounding
influences, and referred, as compositions, to the middle line suggested by this emphasized
frame. An adjustable frame of millimeter paper, divided in half vertically by a white silk
thread, was fitted over the picture to be measured, and measurements were made to left and
to right of this thread-line and, as required, vertically, by reference to the millimeter frame
divisions.

The main question, of course, to be answered by a statistical examination of these thousand
pictures refers to the existence of balance, but many other problems of symmetry are also seen
to be closely involved; the relative frequency of the elements in pictures of different types,
and the result of their employment in producing certain emotional effects, also the general
types of space arrangement as a whole, the feeling-tone belonging to them, and the relation
between content and shape. The first question will not be treated in this paper in the statistical
fulness which was necessary to establish my conclusions in the investigation itself, inasmuch
as the tables were very extensive. But examples of the tables, together with the full results,
will be given, and a sufficient amount of detailed discussion to show my methods. The two other
subjects, the use of the elements and the types of composition, will be briefly treated. I
expect in other publications to go more closely into statistical detail on these matters than
is possible in a merely experimental thesis.

In the beginning of the proposed statistical analysis a natural objection must first be forestalled:
it will be said, and truly, that color also has its effect in bringing about balance, and that
a set of black and white reproductions, therefore, ignores an important element. To this it
may be answered, first, that as a matter of fact the color scheme is, as it were, superimposed
upon the space-shape, and with a balance of its own, all the elements being interdependent;
and secondly, that the black and white does render the intensity contrasts of the colors very
well, giving as light and dark, and thus as interesting (= attractive) and the reverse, those
factors in the scheme which are most closely related to the complex of motor impulses. After
having compared, in European galleries, the originals of very many of these reproductions with
the equation of balance worked out from the black and white, the writer has seldom found an
essential correction needed.

The pictures were first classified by subjects. This may seem less logical than a division
by types of arrangement. But it really, for a majority, amounted to the same thing, as the
historical masterpieces of art mostly follow conventional arrangements; thus the altarpieces,
portraits, genre pictures, etc., were mostly after two or three models, and this classification
was of great convenience from every other point of view. The preliminary classification was
as follows: (1) Religious, Allegorical and Mythical Pictures; (2) Portraits; (3) Genre; (4)
Landscape. The historical pictures were so extremely few that they were included in the religious,
as were also all the allegorical pictures containing Biblical persons. Some pictures, of which
Watteau's are representative, which hovered between genre and landscape, were finally classified
according as they seemed to owe their interest to the figures or to the scenery. A preliminary
classification of space arrangements, still with reference to content, showed three large general
types: (1) A single subject or group in the middle; (2) the same somewhat on one side, with
subordinate elements occupying the rest of the space; (3) two objects or groups each occupying
a well-defined center. These were designated as Single Center, Single and Subordinate Center,
and Double Center pictures, or S.C., S. & S., and D.C. They are in proportions of S.C. 79 per
cent., S. & S. 5 percent., D.C. 16 per cent. The D.C. type is evidently already explicitly
balanced as regards shape and intrinsic interest, and is hence of comparative unimportance
to our problem. The S.C. will show a balance, if at all, in more or less accessory factors;
S. & S., broadly, between interest and other factors. As logically more important, this last
group will be treated more fully. The full classification of the thousand pictures by subjects
is as follows:

Altarpieces.

The pictures of the first group, consisting of the Madonna and Infant Christ surrounded by
worshippers, and briefly designated as Altarpieces, are good for detailed study because they
present a simple type, and it will be easy to show whether the variations from symmetry are
in the direction of balance or not. A few examples will make this clear. The Madonna in the
S.C. pictures is invariably seated holding the Christ.

In the following descriptions M. will denote Madonna, C. Child, Cn. central line. The elements,
Size or Mass, Direction of Motion or Attention, Direction of Line, Vista, and Interest, will
be set down as Ms., D., L., V., and I. A couple of examples will show the method of describing
and of drawing a conclusion as to balance.

1. 969. Lorenzo Lotto, Madonna with St. Bernard and St. Onofrius. C. is on one side turning
to the same; M. leans far to the other; hence interest in C., and direction of C.'s attention
are over against Mass of M. and direction of M.'s attention; i.e., I. + D. = Ms. + D., and
so far, balance. The surrounding saints are insignificant, and we may make the equation I. = Ms.

2. 368. Raffaelino di Francesco, Madonna Enthroned. The C. is on Right facing front, M. turns
away Left, hence interest in C. is over against direction of M.'s attention. Moreover, all
the saints but one turn Left, and of two small vistas behind the throne, the one on the Left
is deeper. The superior interest we feel in C. is thus balanced by the tendency of attention
to the opposite side, and we have I. = D. + V.

It is clear that the broad characteristics of the composition can be symmetrically expressed,
so that a classification of the 70 S.C. altarpieces can be made on a basis of these constant
elements, in the order of decreasing balance. Thus: Class 1, below, in which the C. is one
side of the central line, turned away from the center, the M. turned to the other, balances
in these broad lines, or I. + D. = D.; while in (9), I. + D. + D. = (x), the constant elements
work all on one side.

CLASSIFICATION OF ALTARPIECES.

   1 C. one side turned to same,  M. to other            11
   2 "     "         "     other, "       "               8
   3 "     "         "     front, "       "               2
   4 "     "         "     other, M. front.               9
   5 "     "         "     facing M.                      6
   6 "     "         "     front, M. front.               7
   7 "     "         "       "    M. turned to same.      6
   8 "     "         "    to same M. turned front.        7
   9 "     "         "       "    M.     "   to same,    14
  10 " in middle, turned front.                           0

Thus the constant elements, understanding always that C. has more interest than M., are as
follows: For (1) I. + D. = D.; (2) I. = D. + D.; (3) I. = D.; (4) I. = D.; (5) I. + D. = D.;
etc. These are in order of complete balance, but it will be seen that from (7) on, while the
factors are constant, the framework is not balanced; e.g. in (9) both I. and D. work on the
same side. For these groups, therefore, the variations, if there is balance, will be more striking.
Eliminating the balancing elements in the framework, the tables for the ten groups are:
