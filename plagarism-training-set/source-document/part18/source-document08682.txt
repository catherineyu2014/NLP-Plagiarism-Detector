All incubators must be kept in a warm location, whether operated by a lamp or otherwise. The
warmer the room or cellar, the less warmth required to be supplied. Bear in mind that the incubator
recommended has four inches of sawdust surrounding it, and more sawdust would still be an advantage.
The sawdust is not used to protect against the outside temperature, but to absorb and hold
a large amount of heat, and that is the secret of its success. The directions given were to
first fill the tank with boiling water and allow it to remain for 24 hours. In the meantime
the sawdust absorbs the heat, and more boiling water is then added until the egg-drawer is
about 110 or 115 degrees. By this time there is a quantity of stored heat in the sawdust. The
eggs will cool the drawer to 103. The loss of heat (due to its being held by the sawdust) will
be very slow. All that is needed then is to supply that which will be lost in 12 hours, and
a bucket of boiling water should keep the heat about correct, if added twice a day, but it
may require more, as some consideration must be given to fluctuations of the temperature of
the atmosphere. The third week of incubation, owing to animal heat from the embryo chicks,
a bucket of boiling water will sometimes hold temperature for 24 hours. No objection can be
urged against attaching a lamp arrangement, but a lamp is dangerous at night, while the flame
must be regulated according to temperature. The object of giving the hot water method was to
avoid lamps. We have a large number of them in use (no lamps) here, and they are equal to any
others in results.

With all due respect to some inquirers, the majority of them seem afraid of the work. Now,
there is some work with all incubators. What is desired is to get rid of the anxiety. I stated
that a bucket of water twice a day would suffice. I trusted to the judgment of the reader somewhat.
Of course, if the heat in the egg drawer is 90 degrees, and the weather cold, it may then take
a wash boiler full of water to get the temperature back to 103 degrees, but when it is at 103
keep it there, even if it occasionally requires two buckets of boiling water. To judge of what
may be required, let us suppose the operator looks at the thermometer in the morning, and it
is exactly 103 degrees. He estimates that it will lose a little by night, and draws off half
a bucket of water. At night he finds it at 102. Knowing that it is on what we term "the down
grade," he applies a bucket and a half (always allowing for the night being colder than the
day). As stated, the sawdust will not allow the drawer to become too cold, as it gives off
heat to the drawer. And, as the sawdust absorbs, it is not easy to have the heat too high.
One need not even look at the drawer until the proper times. No watching--the incubator regulates
itself. If a lamp is used, too much heat may accumulate. The flame must be occasionally turned
up or down, and the operator must remain at home and watch it, while during the third week
he will easily cook his eggs.

The incubator can be made at home for so small a sum (about $5 for the tank, $1 for faucet,
etc., with 116 feet of lumber) that it will cost but little to try it. A piece of glass can
be placed in front of the egg drawer, if preferred. If the heat goes down to 90, or rises at
times to 105, no harm is done. But it works well, and hatches, the proof being that hundreds
are in use. I did not give the plan as a theory or an experiment. They are in practical use
here, and work alongside of the more expensive ones, and have been in use for four years. To
use a lamp attachment, all that is necessary is to have a No. 2 burner lamp with a riveted
sheet-iron chimney, the chimney fitting over the flame, like an ordinary globe, and extending
the chimney (using an elbow) through the tank from the rear, ending in front. It should be
soldered at the tank. The heat from the lamp will then pass through the chimney and consequently
warm the surrounding water.--Rural New-Yorker.

THE PEAK OF TENERIFFE.

The Hon. Ralph Abercromby made a trip to the island of Teneriffe in October, 1887, for the
purpose of making some electrical and meteorological observations, and now gives some of the
results which he obtained, which may be summarized as follows: The electrical condition of
the peak of Teneriffe was found to be the same as in every other part of the world. The potential
was moderately positive, from 100 to 150 volts, at 5 ft. 5 in. from the ground, even at considerable
altitudes; but the tension rose to 549 volts on the summit of the peak, 12,200 ft., and to
247 volts on the top of the rock of Gayga, 7,100 feet. A large number of halos were seen associated
with local showers and cloud masses. The necessary ice dust appeared to be formed by rising
currents. The shadow of the peak was seen projected against the sky at sunset. The idea of
a southwest current flowing directly over the northeast trade was found to be erroneous. There
was always a regular vertical succession of air currents in intermediate directions at different
levels from the surface upward, so that the air was always circulating on a complicated screw
system.

ESTRADE'S HIGH SPEED LOCOMOTIVE.

We illustrate a very remarkable locomotive, which has been constructed from the designs of
M. Estrade, a French engineer. This engine was exhibited last year in Paris. Although the engine
was built, M. Estrade could not persuade any railway company to try it for him, and finally
he applied to the French government, who have at last sanctioned the carrying out of experiments
with it on one of the state railway lines. The engine is in all respects so opposed to English
ideas that we have hitherto said nothing about it. As, however, it is going to be tried, an
importance is given to it which it did not possess before; and, as a mechanical curiosity,
we think it is worth the consideration of our readers.

In order that we may do M. Estrade no injustice, we reproduce here in a condensed form, and
in English, the arguments in its favor contained in a paper written by M. Max de Nansouty,
C.E., who brought M. Estrade's views before the French Institution of Civil Engineers, on May
21, 1886. M. Nansouty's paper has been prepared with much care, and contains a great deal of
useful data quite apart from the Estrade engine. The paper in question is entitled "Memoire
relatif au Materiel Roulant a Grand Vitesse," D.M. Estrade.

About thirty years ago, M. Estrade, formerly pupil of the Polytechnic School, invented rolling
stock for high speed under especial conditions, and capable of leading to important results,
more especially with regard to speed. Following step by step the progress made in the construction
of railway stock, the inventor, from time to time, modified and improved his original plan,
and finally, in 1884, arrived at the conception of a system entirely new in its fundamental
principles and in its execution. A description of this system is the object of the memoir.

The great number of types of locomotives and carriages now met with in France, England, and
the United States renders it difficult to combine their advantages, as M. Estrade proposed
to do, in a system responding to the requirements of the constructor. His principal object,
however, has been to construct, under specially favorable conditions, a locomotive, tender,
and rolling stock adapted to each other, so as to establish a perfect accord between these
organs when in motion. It is, in fact, a complete train, and not, as sometimes supposed, a
locomotive only, of an especial type, which has been the object he set before him. Before entering
into other considerations, we shall first give a description of the stock proposed by M. Estrade.
The idea of the invention consists in the use of coupled wheels of large diameter and in the
adoption of a new system of double suspension.

The locomotive and tender we illustrate were constructed by MM. Boulet & Co. The locomotive
is carried on six driving wheels, 8 feet 3 inches in diameter. The total weight of the engine
is thus utilized for adhesion. The accompanying table gives the principal dimensions:

  +-----------------------+---------------+

  +-----------------------+---------------+

  |Diameter of cylinder.  |  1  6½        |
  +-----------------------+---------------+
  |Length of stroke.      |  2  3½        |

  |Grate surface.         | 25 sq. feet.  |
  +-----------------------+---------------+
  |Total heating surface. | 1,400 sq. ft. |
  +-----------------------+---------------+
  |Weight empty.          | 38 tons.      |
  +-----------------------+---------------+
  |Weight full.           | 42 tons.      |
  +---------------------------------------+

The high speeds--77 to 80 miles an hour--in view of which this stock has been constructed have,
it will be seen, caused the elements relative to the capacity of the boiler and the heating
surfaces to be developed as much as possible. It is in this, in fact, that one of the great
difficulties of the problem lies, the practical limit of stability being fixed by the diameter
of the driving wheels. Speed can only be obtained by an expenditure of steam which soon becomes
such as rapidly to exhaust the engine unless the heating surface is very large.

The tender, also fitted with wheels of 8 ft. 3 in. in diameter, offers no particular feature;
it is simply arranged so as to carry the greatest quantity of coal and water.

M. Estrade has also designed carriages. One has been constructed by MM. Reynaud, Bechade, Gire
& Co., which has very few points in common with those in general use. Independently of the
division of the compartments into two stories, wheels 8 ft. 3 in. in diameter are employed,
and the double system of suspension adopted. Two axles, 16 ft. apart, support, by means of
plate springs, an iron framing running from end to end over the whole length, its extremities
being curved toward the ground. Each frame carries in its turn three other plate springs, to
which the body is suspended by means of iron tie-rods serving to support it. This is then a
double suspension, which at once appears to be very superior to the systems adopted up to the
present time. The great diameter of the wheels has necessitated the division into two stories.
The lower story is formed of three equal parts, lengthened toward the axles by narrow compartments,
which can be utilized for luggage or converted into lavatories, etc. Above is one single compartment
with a central passage, which is reached by staircases at the end. All the vehicles of the
same train are to be united at this level by jointed platforms furnished with hand rails. It
is sufficient to point out the general disposition, without entering into details which do
not affect the system, and which must vary for the different classes and according to the requirements
of the service.

M. Nansouty draws a comparison between the diameters of the driving wheels and cylinders of
the principal locomotives now in use and those of the Estrade engine as set forth in the following
table. We only give the figures for coupled engines:

This table, the examination of which will be found very instructive, shows that there are already
in use: For locomotives with single drivers, diameters of 9 ft., 8 ft. 1 in., and 8 ft.; (2)
for locomotives with four coupled wheels, diameters 6 ft. to 7 ft. There is therefore an important
difference between the diameters of the coupled wheels of 7 ft. and those of 8 ft. 3 in., as
conceived by M. Estrade. However, the transition is not illogically sudden, and if the conception
is a bold one, "it cannot," says M. Nansouty, "on the other hand, be qualified as rash."

He goes on to consider, in the first place: Especial types of uncoupled wheels, the diameters
of which form useful samples for our present case. The engines of the Bristol and Exeter line
are express tender engines, adopted on the English lines in 1853, some specimens of which are
still in use.[1] These engines have ten wheels, the single drivers in the center, 9 ft. in
diameter, and a four-wheeled bogie at each end. The driving wheels have no flanges. The bogie
wheels are 4 ft. in diameter. The cylinders have a diameter of 16½ in. and a piston stroke
of 24 in. The boiler contains 180 tubes, and the total weight of the engine is 42 tons. These
locomotives, constructed for 7 ft. gauge, have attained a speed of seventy-seven miles per hour.

   [Footnote 1: M. Nansouty is mistaken. None of the Bristol and
   Exeter tank engines with. 9 ft. wheels are in use, so far as we
   know. ED. E.]

The single driver locomotives of the Great Northern are powerful engines in current use in
England. The driving wheels carry 17 tons, the heating surface is 1,160 square feet, the diameters
of the cylinders 18 in., and that of the driving wheels 8 ft. 1 in. We have here, then, a diameter
very near to that adopted by M. Estrade, and which, together with the previous example, forms
a precedent of great interest. The locomotive of the Great Northern has a leading four-wheeled
bogie, which considerably increases the steadiness of the engine, and counterbalances the disturbing
effect of outside cylinders. Acting on the same principles which have animated M. Estrade,
that is to say, with the aim of reducing the retarding effects of rolling friction, the constructor
of the locomotive of the Great Northern has considerably increased the diameter of the wheels
of the bogie. In this engine all the bearing are inside, while the cylinders are outside and
horizontal. The tender has six wheels, also of large dimensions. It is capable of containing
three tons and a half of coal and about 3,000 gallons of water. This type of engine is now
in current and daily use in England.

M. Nansouty next considers the broad gauge Great Western engines with 8 ft. driving wheels.
The diameters of their wheels approach those of M. Estrade, and exceed considerably in size
any lately proposed. M. Nansouty dwells especially upon the boiler power of the Great Western
railway, because one of the objections made to M. Estrade's locomotive by the learned societies
has been the difficulty of supplying boiler power enough for high speeds contemplated; and
he deals at considerable length with a large number of English engines of maximum power, the
dimensions and performance of which are too well known to our readers to need reproduction here.

Aware that a prominent weak point in M. Estrade's design is that, no matter what size we make
cylinders and wheels, we have ultimately to depend on the boiler for power, M. Nansouty argues
that M. Estrade having provided more surface than is to be found in any other engine, must
be successful. But the total heating surface in the engine, which we illustrate, is but 1,400
square feet, while that of the Great Western engines, on which he lays such stress, is 2,300
square feet, and the table which he gives of the heating surface of various English engines
really means very little. It is quite true that there are no engines working in England with
much over 1,500 square feet of surface, except those on the broad gauge, but it does not follow
that because they manage to make an average of 53 miles an hour that an addition of 500 square
feet would enable them to run at a speed higher by 20 miles an hour. There are engines in France,
however, which have as much as 1,600 square feet, as, for example, on the Paris-Orleans line,
but we have never heard that these engines attain a speed of 80 miles an hour.

Leaving the question of boiler power, M. Nansouty goes on to consider the question of adhesion.
About this he says:

Is the locomotive proposed by M. Estrade under abnormal conditions as to weight and adhesion?
This appears to have been doubted, especially taking into consideration its height and elegant
appearance. We shall again reply here by figures, while remarking that the adhesion of locomotives
increases with the speed, according to laws still unknown or imperfectly understood, and that
consequently for extreme speeds, ignorance of the value of the coefficiency of adhesion f in
the formula

                  d 2 I
    fP = 0.65 p  ------- - R
                    D

renders it impossible to pronounce upon it before the trials earnestly and justly demanded
by the author of this new system. In present practice f = 1/7 is admitted. M. Nansouty gives
in a table a resume of the experience on this subject, and goes on:
