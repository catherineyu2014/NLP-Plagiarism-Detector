   I quake not at the thunder's crack;
     I tremble not at noise of war;
   I swound not at the news of wrack;
     I shrink not at a blazing star;
   I fear not loss, I hope not gain,
   I envy none, I none disdain.

   I feign not friendship, where I hate;
     I fawn not on the great in show;
   I prize, I praise a mean estate--
     Neither too lofty nor too low;
   This, this is all my choice, my cheer--
   A mind content, a conscience clear.

V. A WISH[60]

   Mine be a cot beside the hill;
     A beehive's hum shall soothe my ear;
   A willowy brook that turns a mill
     With many a fall shall linger near.

   The swallow, oft, beneath my thatch
     Shall twitter from her clay-built nest;
   Oft shall the pilgrim lift the latch,
     And share my meal, a welcome guest.

   Around my ivied porch shall spring
     Each fragrant flower that drinks the dew;
   And Lucy, at her wheel, shall sing
     In russet gown and apron blue.

   The village church among the trees,
     Where first our marriage vows were given,
   With merry peals shall swell the breeze
     And point with taper spire to Heaven.

HOW KING ARTHUR GOT HIS NAME[61]

One day at sunset, Snowbird, the young son of a king, came over the brow of a hill that stepped
forward from a dark company of mountains and leaned over the shoreless sea which fills the
West and drowns the North. All day he had been wandering alone, his mind heavy with wonder
over many things. He had heard strange tales of late, tales about his heroic father and the
royal clan, and how they were not like other men, but half divine. He had heard, too, of his
own destiny,--that he also was to be a great king. What was Destiny, he wondered....

Then, as he wondered, he turned over and over in his mind all the names he could think of that
he might choose for his own; for the time was come for him to put away the name of his childhood
and to take on that by which he should be known among men.

He came over the brow of the hill, and out of the way of the mountain wind, and, being tired,
lay down among the heather and stared across the gray wilderness of the sea. The sun set, and
the invisible throwers of the nets trailed darkness across the waves and up the wild shores
and over the faces of the cliffs. Stars climbed out of shadowy abysses, and the great chariots
of the constellations rode from the West to the East and from the North to the South.

His eyes closed, ... but when he opened them again, he saw a great and kingly figure standing
beside him. So great in stature, so splendid in kingly beauty, was the mysterious one who had
so silently joined him, that he thought this must be one of the gods.

"Do you know me, my son?" said the kingly stranger.

The boy looked at him in awe and wonder, but unrecognizingly.

"Do you not know me, my son?" he heard again ... "for I am your father, Pendragon. But my home
is yonder, and that is why I have come to you as a vision in a dream ..." and, as he spoke,
he pointed to the constellation of the Arth, or Bear, which nightly prowls through the vast
abysses of the polar sky.

When the boy turned his gaze from the great constellation which hung in the dark wilderness
overhead, he saw that he was alone again. While he yet wondered in great awe at what he had
seen and heard, he felt himself float like a mist and become like a cloud, rise beyond the
brows of the hills, and ascend the invisible stairways of the sky....

It seemed to him thereafter that a swoon came over him, in which he passed beyond the far-off
blazing fires of strange stars. At last, suddenly, he stood on the verge of Arth, Arth Uthyr,
the Great Bear. There he saw, with the vision of immortal, not of mortal, eyes, a company of
most noble and majestic figures seated at what he thought a circular abyss, but which had the
semblance of a vast table. Each of these seven great knights or lordly kings had a star upon
his forehead, and these were stars of the mighty constellation of the Bear which the boy had
seen night after night from his home among the mountains by the sea.

It was with a burning throb at his heart that he recognized in the King of all these kings
no other than himself.

While he looked, in amazement so great that he could hear the pulse of his heart, as in the
silence of a wood one hears the tapping of a woodpecker, he saw this mighty phantom self rise
till he stood towering over all there, and heard a voice as though an ocean rose and fell through
the eternal silences.

"Comrades in God," it said, "the time is come when that which is great shall become small."

And when the voice was ended, the mighty figure faded in the blue darkness, and only a great
star shone where the uplifted dragon helm had brushed the roof of heaven. One by one the white
lords of the sky followed in his mysterious way, till once more were to be seen only the stars
of the Bear.

The boy dreamed that he fell as a falling meteor, and that he floated over land and sea as
a cloud, and then that he sank as mist upon the hills of his own land.

A noise of wind stirred in his ears. He rose stumblingly, and stood, staring around him. He
glanced upward and saw the stars of the Great Bear in their slow march round the Pole.... Then
he remembered.

He went slowly down the hill, his mind heavy with thought. When he was come to his own place,
lo! all the fierce chivalry of the land came out to meet him; for the archdruid had foretold
that the great King to be had received his mystic initiation among the holy silences of the hills.

"I am no more Snowbird, the child," the boy said, looking at them fearless and as though already
King. "Henceforth I am Arth-Urthyr,[62] for my place is in the Great Bear which we see yonder
in the north."

So all there acclaimed him as Arthur, the wondrous one of the stars, the Great Bear.

"I am old," said his father, "and soon you shall be King, Arthur, my son. So ask now a great
boon of me and it shall be granted to you."

Then Arthur remembered his dream.

"Father and King," he said, "when I am King after you, I shall make a new order of knights,
who shall be pure as the Immortal Ones, and be tender as women, and simple as little children.
But first I ask of you seven flawless knights to be of my chosen company. To-morrow let the
wood wrights make for me a round table, such as that where we eat our roasted meats, but round
and of a size whereat I and my chosen knights may sit at ease."

The king listened, and all there.

"So be it," said the king.

Then Arthur chose the seven flawless knights, and called them to him. "Ye are now Children
of the Great Bear," he said, "and comrades and liegemen to me, Arthur, who shall be King of
the West.

"And ye shall be known as the Knights of the Round Table. But no man shall make a mock of that
name and live: and in the end that name shall be so great in the mouths and minds of men that
they shall consider no glory of the world to be so great as to be the youngest and frailest
of that knighthood."

And that is how Arthur, who three years later became King of the West, read the rune of the
stars that are called the Great Bear, and took their name upon him, and from the strongest
and purest and noblest of the land made Knighthood, such as the world had not seen, such as
the world since has not seen.

Thou carried them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass
which groweth up.

In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.

For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
