the mat. Weave the border line around the entire mat, touching the marked points. Count from
C to G, mark, and do the same in the other three corners.

Weave G H around the mat, touching the marked points at the corners. Count from C to D and
over to I, and weave I J. Weave the whole figure just started, and the figure facing it, including
the ground line beneath. Weave the other corners in a similar manner.

At K count to O, back to L, over to M, and weave the figure beneath M. Mark off L M and M N.
Now continue marking alternately across the side spaces equal to L M and M N, making the last
space equal to L M. Weave the figure between these marks and continue marking and weaving in
the same way on the other sides.

Mats woven for this design should be made: 237 by 399; 345 by 507; 690 by 1014 (units double
size); 453 by 615. (16 should not be used on sabutan.)

and weave the inner border line around the entire mat. Now weave all four corner designs. Count
from G to H and up to I, and weave the two figures.

To place the next two figures, which are exactly like the two just woven, count out from J,
17 straws, and repeat from K which is the tip of the arrow of the first figure, just made.

Mats woven for this design should be: 345 by 501, 9 straws; 505 by 739, 11; 739 by 1051, 11.

Mats woven for this design should be 254 by 407 straws; 271 by 424; 304 by 542 (double); 406
by 542 (double); or 576 by 712. In the last three of these, 304 by 542, 406 by 542, and 576
by 712, the counts should all be doubled, the designs being twice the size of those in the
first two mats; that is, from A to B will be 44, B to C, 66, and so on.

Tikug mats in natural straw may be embroidered in the following colors:

No. 14 for casa, No. 12 for tree, No. 15 for border lines except on sabutan;

No. 3 for casa, No. 15 for tree, No. 8 for border lines; and Nos.

Chicken Vender Design.

border line. At the first B, count down to C and over to D and weave D E. Count from E to O
and up to G and mark. Mark H, counting from G. Mark J, counting from H. Mark all points similar
to H and J on this side of the mat, counting back from the corner a space equal to G B. Now
weave all designs on this side of the mat. Mark off spaces on each side of the mat before weaving
that side.

Mats woven for this design should be 202 by 538; 314 by 538; or 426 by 650. (On sabutan use
No. 14 instead of No. 1 for legs and feet).

[4] The Bureau of Education has taken steps to procure a series of dyes suited to each one
of the mat straws and other important fibers used in household industries and industrial instruction
in the Philippines.

[5] A tint is a paler or less intense tone than the standard color. A shade is a darker, more
intense tone of the standard color.

for placing at its disposal an unpublished manuscript on the Flora of Manila. Information from
the following sources is also acknowledged:

[9] It is probable that some of the double Moro mats which will be described under the heading
"Pandan Straws" are woven from buri straw.

[10] Due to the efforts of Elmer D. Merrill and A. D. E. Elmer, Botanists of Manila, aided
by Prof. Martelli, of Florence, Italy, our knowledge of Philippine pandans has been greatly
broadened. It is hoped that interested persons into whose hands this paper may come will help
to extend it by sending specimens of pandans for identification to the Bureau of Education,
Manila. Such specimens should consist of the ripe fruit and of at least two full-grown leaves
from which no spines or tips have been removed, and which have been cut as close as possible
to the stem.

[11] Bulletin No. 33, Bureau of Education. Journal of Science, Manila, Vol. VI, Sec. C, No. 2.

[12] To settle, if possible, the question of whether sabutan flowers and fruits, inquiries
and investigations on the ground were made in Tanay and Pililla by a representative of the
General Office of the Bureau of Education. The people interviewed in these towns were positive
in their statements that they had never seen the fruit of this pandan though they did remember
seeing the flower. Every possible effort was made to get accurate, reliable information. An
old man was engaged as guide and a male inflorescence of sabutan was found in a patch located
on a hillside, under the shade of trees and surrounded by considerable underbrush. The patch,
according to the statement of the old man was older than he could remember; the age of the
guide was, perhaps, between sixty and seventy years. The flowers were odorous and covered with
small brown insects almost hiding the inflorescence.

[13] Plain double pandan mats, the material of which resembles sabutan, are imported from Singapore
and sold by Chinese storekeepers in Manila in large quantities. They are roughly made and the
fact that they are double permits the unfinished edges to be turned under and sewed down with
coarse red cotton twine. They sell for a little less than the plain, single, Tanay sabutan
mats with finished edges.

[14] It is very difficult to obtain definite information with exact figures. These statements
were made by a woman expert in weaving mats, and owing to the frank answers to the questions
put, her information seems more reliable than that of the usual weaver interviewed. Other persons
state that from two to six leaves are taken from a plant every month.

[15] Three liters equal 1 ganta.

[16] Sabutan lends itself easily to the fabrication of pocketbooks useful as purses, card-cases
or cigarette-cases. From it can also be made very pretty, strong, durable and useful handbags.
The weaving of both of these articles has been taken up in the schools of Tanay, but it is
not as yet commercial in the town. Sets consisting of a handbag and a pocketbook in the same
color and design are attractive.

[17] Sabutan suckers may be purchased from several firms in Manila at P5 per hundred, freight
prepaid. In shipping, the plants are packed in baskets so that they can be easily handled.
It is believed by persons who have received shipments from this source that the plants will
remain in good condition out of the ground for a week or more during shipment. Hence it is
not advisable for places more remote than one week from Manila to order any of these plants.
For further information see Circular No. 82, s. 1911, Bureau of Education. It is probable that
suckers can be obtained from the cultivated plants in about a year after they are set out.

[18] At this writing no data are at hand as to the preparation of sarakat straw, but it is
probably made simply by drying. It is possible that much stronger and more pliable straw could
be obtained if a process such as is used in the preparation of sabutan were followed.

[19] Vol. I, No. 1 of the Philippine Agriculturist and Forester. A description of the plant
occurs in Mr. A. D. E. Elmer's leaflets.

[20] It is probable that the improved Andes stripper can be utilized in the cutting of pandan
straws.

[21] Arrangements are now being made through the schools for the introduction of sabutan plants
into the towns of Majayjay and Luisiana.

[22] Most of the information on "karagumoy" is taken from the report submitted to the Director
of Education by Mr. Ralph E. Spencer.

[23] The average was obtained by measuring accurately a number of specimens of the species
sent in to the Bureau of Education from various provinces

[24] Its most common name is bariu, spelled also bario, balio, balewe, baleau. In Occidental
Negros it is also called, balean, barog in Surigao, batin in Capiz.

[25] Robinson, in Vol. VI, No. 2, Section C of the Journal of Science, states that this sedge
also grows on the eastern side of Luzon.

[26] F. meliacea is also known as tikug in Samar but it cannot be used in weaving.

[27] In pulling up tikug the whole stalk can generally be obtained by grasping it a short distance
below the top. It is made into small bundles and tied a short distance below the seed heads.
Each bundle contains from forty to sixty straws. In all towns except Basey the weavers gather
the stalks they use. At Basey, however, where weaving of mats is a recognized industry, the
straw is obtained from country people who make it a business to gather and sell it. These tikug
vendors carry the bundles of green straw to the town, where they sell for from forty centavos
to one peso per hundred bundles, depending upon the length of the straws.

[28] The high cost of these dyes results from the adulteration practiced and the exorbitant
profits, usually about 450 per cent. It is expected that the new dyes obtained from Germany
through the Bureau of Education will make a saving of about 80 per cent to the workers.

[29] The following story is reported as showing the cleverness of the weavers of Basey in embroidering
designs on mats. An engineer in charge of road construction refused to buy certain mats from
a vendor but stated, jokingly, and in order to be rid of the insistent merchant, that if he
were brought mats having designs which were of interest to him, as showing scenes connected
with his work, he would buy them. In a few weeks the broker returned, bringing with him a large
mat on which were displayed a road roller, wheel barrows, shovels, spades and other implements
connected with road building, and part of a road itself.

[30] In general it may be stated that the sabutan and tikug mats are the strongest made in
the Philippines. Neither the wearing qualities of the straw nor the permanency of the dyes
in buri mats are equal to those of tikug. If tikug floor mats become dirty they may be cleaned
without injury if the dyeing was well done. They should be shaken to remove dust and dirt,
laid flat on the floor and lightly scrubbed with a cloth, sponge or brush, using lukewarm soapsuds,
after which cold water should be thrown on them. They are dried by hanging in the sunshine
or the breeze.

[31] A firm has recently entered the field and is doing a mail order business in these mats
with the United States. Their plans include the furnishing of straw and dyes to the weavers
and the weaving of standard designs.

[32] Most of the information given under this heading was taken from reports by Percy M. Jones
and Frank Thomason, formerly supervising teachers of Bohol.

[33] Circular No. 82, s. 1911, Bureau of Education.

[34] Based on original designs by Mrs. Alice Brezina.

[35] Three units will take up about 3 times 17, or 51 straws. In starting, a curved pattern
51 straws across will have to be made and slipped up or down in a sixteenth division of the
mat in order that the margin space may be determined.

[36] This design, in all cases except where G S is 8 instead of 5, would look well with the
outer border line broadened to the edge of the mat. This is a suggestion only; it means a great
deal of work.

[37] Weave large solid parts of designs first, when possible, and slight mistakes of one or
two straws, which may happen, will then occur in open parts where they will show very little.
Mistakes of this kind are only allowable in cases of flaws in the mat which is used.
