My son's letter, or rather the first draft of it, is not much more artistic in appearance than
the foregoing. He is evidently in the same class in orthography with his friend, Master Gillander,
and I do not doubt that, under careful culture, he may emulate the various virtues of his friend,
and become, in time, an accomplished "aig" sucker. Here is his letter in the original:--

"DEER FARTHER:--As this is the da fur composition doctur STUFFEM sed I mite rite you a leter
for my composition and I rite these fu lines to let you no that I am wel, but one of the boys

"THEOPHILUS"

The third epistle was written on a clean sheet, the date being in the middle of the first page,
and the entire production bearing the marks of herculean effort. I infer that this final letter
was a "corrected, proof," and had to pass a severe examination. Probably, this was the only
one intended for my eye, and I cannot account for the arrival of the three documents, except
upon the hypothesis that my boy heedlessly and hurriedly thrust them in one enclosure, and
forgot to remove the phonetic specimens before mail time. It ran thus:--

"MY DEAR FATHER: In lieu of the usual essay required of pupils on this day, my preceptor allows
me to write a letter to you, which he hopes may serve to evince my progress in the art of composition,
the improvement in my penmanship (to which he devotes special attention), and to inform you
of my continued health. Indeed, in this delightful locality, nothing else could be expected,
as Whelpville, being 796 feet above tide-water, is entirely free from those miasmatic influences
which unfortunately affect the sanitary condition of those institutions of learning that are
less favorably situated. The only case of sickness that has occurred since my arrival, and
for a long time previously, was that of my room-mate and friend, Richard Gillander, whose father
has recently purchased an estate in our neighborhood, principally on account of the salubrity
of our climate. But Richard had doubtless contracted the disease, which was of an intermittent
character, at his former school, which was the Riverbank Classical Academy, at Swamptown. Our
kind preceptor allowed Richard to return to his father's house until his health should be entirely
restored. He is now decidedly convalescent, and has written me an urgent invitation to visit
him on Saturday next. As this invitation is corroborated by a letter from Mr. Gillander to
our preceptor, I should be much pleased to accept it, with your approval. If you have no objection
to this arrangement, therefore, I will thank you to enclose me one dollar by mail, as the railway
fare to Richard's home amounts to nearly this sum.

"Hoping for a favorable reply, and promising myself the pleasure of writing you a full account
of this visit one week hence,

"I remain,

My dear parent,

Your dutiful Son,

THEOPHILUS."

This letter breathed such an air of lofty morality that I was quite overcome. I enclosed the
required dollar, of course, and wrote a line to Doctor STUFFEM complimenting him upon the manifest
improvement in his pupil. I am looking with some anxiety for the promised letter recounting
the incidents of the projected visit, and have some misgivings induced by Master DICK'S hints
concerning the gun, powderhorn, and percussion-caps. I infer, however, from the last letter,
that such a change has been wrought upon THEOPHILUS, that he will probably spend his holiday
in reciting moral apothegms to his friend and "room-mait."

SARSFIELD YOUNG'S PANORAMA.

PART III.

THE GEYSERS.

A fascinating, achromatic sketch of the Geysers of Iceland, those wonderful hydraulic volcanoes,
which would readily he considered objects of the greatest natural grandeur, if the hotels in
the neighborhood were only a little better kept and more judiciously advertised. Before these
stupendous hot-water works the spectator stands aghast, and boils his egg in fourteen seconds,
by a stop-watch.

It would seem as though the poet's invocation,

   "Come, gentle spring! ethereal mildness, come,"

were somewhat rudely answered, for the spring comes with a noise like thunder, bringing with
it "ethereal mildness" at the rate of ten thousand gallons a minute. It has been calculated
that there is thrown out annually water enough to supply all the hot whiskey punches that are
required during that time in the State of Maine alone. Old sailors say it reminds them of a
whale fastened alongside their ship--it is a Seething Tide.

These vast wreaths, which the painter's art has so beautifully revealed to us at the top of
the canvas, are steam. It runs no machinery, bursts no boilers, does nothing, in fact, that
is useful, but only hangs round. Yet these volcanoes are full of instruction to those who live
by them, impressing upon each and every one the mournful, yet scientific truth, that his life
is but a vapor.

A VIEW OF MELROSE, MIDDLESEX COUNTY, MASS.

It has been well said, "If you would view fair Melrose, do it by moonlight." Our artist found
that the suburban trains had not been arranged with an eye to this effect, and he was reluctantly
obliged to give us his impressions of this charming spot by daylight.

This, however, has its advantages.

The elegant private residences, neatly trimmed lawns, graceful shade trees, beautifully dressed
women and children, driving or promenading, are all more distinctly brought out.

The male population, for the most part, are brought out a few hours later, by steam and horse cars.

Everything here betokens ease and refinement. Here they refine sugar, in this large brick building.

The school-houses, churches, and town-hall are easily distinguished from each other, being
of brick, with a brown belfry. On the extreme left is the town-farm for paupers. We haven't
time, so we won't dwell upon this.

THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT.

These highly interesting old buildings are presented with extraordinary fidelity. They were
taken on the spot. They are three in number, you will observe. I presume you cannot tell me
what this is? We paid for it as the Sphinx, and it is pronounced by competent judges an exceedingly
flattering portrait. The Pyramids are centuries old. It is understood that Miss Sphinx, out
of respect to her sex, is about thirty summers--permanently.

I will not deceive you. These structures are immense tombs full of mummies; all the rooms are
taken. From careful observation, it is concluded that, like the Federal Union, they "must be
preserved." Here they stay in rapt solitude. A glance at the superintendent's register, as
you go in, shows that the "PHARAOH family" furnish the largest number of inmates.

Look at this caravan about to cross the Desert. The camels are going instead of coming. They
are the ships of the desert--hardships. The leading camel has a bell appended to his neck,
which at this moment is ringing for Sahara. We wish them good luck on their journey.

This gentleman on the rear camel (which you notice carries a red flag to prevent collision),
who is jauntily attired in nankeen trousers and a blue cotton umbrella, is a physician from
New Jersey, whose sands of life have nearly run out. He will get plenty more by to-morrow.

A STORM OFF HATTERAS.

A terrific sight!

You can't sec anything, it is so thick. The sea runs mountain high. The gallant ship, with
creaking masts, drives before the gale and plunges over the crests of the foaming billows.
That is what she was built for.

The thunder peals crash after crash, and occasionally crash before crash. The lightning's lurid
glare illumines, ever and anon, the scene.

The stoutest hold their breath, and if they can't do that, they hold to a belaying-pin, while
the awe-stricken crew in vain attempt to pump out the hold. All is darkness, except in the
binnacle.

We leave the noble vessel to her fate, with the cheering conviction that she is fully insured.

THE COLISEUM AT ROME.

Who has not yet heard of the Coliseum at Rome, that great masterpiece of Architecture, wherein
Rome held her gladiatorial combats, her peace jubilees, and other solemnities! What classic
associations cluster around it; what tender recollections of Latin Grammar and of ROMULUS and
REMUS, CATILINE, and other friends of our youth, crowd upon us!

Here is where the poet saw the lying gladiator die; and where Mr. FORREST beheld the arena
swim around him. You perceive from the outline of this immense building that there was ample
room for this purpose.

A look at this recalls past ages; the palmy days of Rome. I need not remind my young friends
that Rome is not so palmy as she was. And yet there is no reason in the world why she couldn't
be made a great railroad centre. Look at Troy!

Strangers repair to this venerable pile from every part of the earth, though it is somewhat
out of repair just at present.

This view, I need hardly explain, is intended to be by moonlight. The student, the philosopher,
the lover of the classics, will gaze upon this ruin with emotions of mingled joy and sadness.

Other lovers will gaze at this object, which, without my assistance, they will recognize as
the silver-orbed moon. Mark its pensive rays. The silver moon will now roll on--to the next
subject.
