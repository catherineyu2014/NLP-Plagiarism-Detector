The heating compress is indicated in the following cases: Sprained ankles, rheumatic joints,
arthritis, sore throat, etc. Directions: Wring two thicknesses of cheesecloth from cold water,
place over the painful part, and quickly cover with a mackintosh and two thicknesses of woolen
blanket bandage. On removing in the morning, sponge with cold water or alcohol.

MUSTARD PASTE

In the bronchitis of small children, particularly babies, mustard pastes are to be preferred
to the hot fomentations which are used to such great advantage in children above ten. The mustard
paste is administered as follows: One part of mustard and six parts of flour of the same measurements
are quickly stirred up with warm water to a paste thin enough to spread well upon a piece of
thin muslin, which is large enough to cover twice the part to be treated. One-half of this
muslin is thus covered with the mustard and the dry piece of cloth brought over. The edges
are then folded in such a way that the mustard will not run out. This is applied to the affected
part and allowed to remain for seven minutes on an infant, nine minutes on a child, and ten
or twelve minutes on an adult. It is then removed and the moisture which is always seen on
the reddened skin surface is not wiped off but talcum powder is sprinkled on thickly to absorb
it. If this is done, a mustard paste may be repeated every two hours if necessary and no blistering
or other harm will come to the skin.

THE OIL-SILK JACKET

The oil-silk jacket is used in bronchitis of babies and children. It consists of three layers,
the innermost layer of cheesecloth, the middle layer of thin sheet wadding, and the outer layer
of oil-silk. This jacket should comfortably cover the chest, front, and back; it has no sleeves,
and is opened on the shoulder and under the arm. It should always follow the mustard paste
in bronchitis. There should always be two such cheesecloth and cotton jackets with the oil-silk
covering so they may be changed every twelve hours, thus allowing for airing.

STEAM INHALATIONS

1. Steam inhalations are indicated in hoarseness and bronchitis. They may be given in a number
of ways. Perhaps that most convenient for the young infant is the "bronchitis tent." A sheet
completely covers the crib, and, with the bed amply protected with rubber sheeting or an extra
blanket, steam is allowed to enter under the sheet at the foot of the bed from a funnel put
into the nose of the teakettle. The steam should continue for seven or eight minutes.

2. A large, heavy-paper funnel is put in the nose of the teakettle which is boiling on the
gas range. The mother holds the child in her arms while she is enveloped with a sheet which
also includes the funnel. A helper carefully guards the flame. The mother and baby may thus
conveniently get the steam with very little difficulty.

3. For the older child or adult, steam inhalations are to be had from the ordinary croup kettle
or from a twelve- or fourteen-inch tin can which is filled two-thirds full of boiling water.
Over the top is loosely spread a cheesecloth upon which a few drops of compound tincture of
benzoin or eucalyptus are sprinkled. The opened mouth is brought near the top of this can and
a towel is thrown over the head, can and all; the patient thus being able satisfactorily to
inhale the medicated steam.

LOTIONS FOR SORE MOUTH

Boric-Acid-and-Myrrh Lotion.

  Boric acid               20 grains
  Tincture of myrrh        1/2 fluidrachm
  Glycerine                1 fluidrachm
  Water, enough to make    1 fluid ounce

Apply frequently to the inside of the mouth for inflammation or thrush.

FOR NOSEBLEED

  Tannic acid             2 drachms
  Glycerine               1 fluidrachm
  Water                   2 fluid ounces

To be injected or snuffed into the nose in obstinate cases of nosebleed.

THROAT GARGLES

Dobell's solution is an excellent throat gargle. A solution of half alcohol and half water
is also a splendid gargle.

MOUTH WASH

  Listerine                2 teaspoons
  Soda bicarbonate        10 grains
  Water                    4 ounces

Essence of cinnamon, six drops in one-half glass cold water, may also be used in brushing the
teeth and in cleansing the tongue and mouth.

DISINFECTANTS

  1. Carbolic Acid.
      Carbolic acid (95%)                  6 ounces
      Glycerine                            4 ounces
      Water                                1 gallon

Clothes should be soaked in this for several hours, then removed in a covered receptacle and
boiled thoroughly. Sheets may be wet with this and hung at the doors in case of infectious
diseases.

  2. Chloride of Lime.
      Chloride of Lime                     4 ounces
      Water (rain)                         1 gallon

In typhoid fever, all the movements from the bowels should be thoroughly mixed with this, covered
and allowed to stand several hours before pouring down the water closet. All vomited matter
should be treated the same way.

POULTICES

There are a number of mush poultices recommended for different conditions--boils, felons, etc.,
but we find the aseptic heating compress to be as effectual as any of these dirty, mush poultices
and we suggest that our readers try the boracic-acid poultice which is put on as follows: Over
any infected area or abrasion of the skin a thick padding of cotton moistened by a saturated
boracic-acid solution is placed. This is entirely covered with wax paper or oiled-silk, and
held in place by a binder. It is sanitary and much to be preferred to any of the mush poultices
of bygone days.

COUGH SYRUP

A very useful cough syrup may be made as follows: Two tablespoons of flaxseed are steeped on
the stove until clear, the jelly strained and flavored quite sour with lemon juice to which
is added rock candy for sweetening. This will often effectively relieve the irritating coughs
of childhood.

LOTIONS FOR CHAPPED HANDS

  No. 1. Glycerine        3 ounces
         Tr. Benzoin      1/2 ounce
         Water            1 ounce

ECZEMA

We wish to submit two very useful prescriptions for that troublesome skin disease which is
so annoying in childhood as well as in adult life. Prescription No. 1 is a clear fluid, and
after the affected area is thoroughly cleansed with resinol soap and rinsed in soft water,
the lotion is applied and allowed to dry. No. 2 is then patted on with sterile cotton and often
repeated to keep the eczematous skin area moist. This has proved curative in many persistent cases.

Lotion No. 1.

  Acid Carbolic   1 drachm
  Listerine       1 drachm
  Rose Water      3 ounces
  Alcohol q. s.   6 ounces

Apply No. 1 and allow to dry of itself.

Lotion No. 2.

  Ichthyol           4 drachms
  Lime Water         1 ounce
  Oil sweet almonds  1 ounce
  Glycerine          1½ ounces
  Rose Water         1½ ounces

Apply No. 2 and repeat to keep moist.

CONSTIPATION

We submit the following home regime, which has proved successful to many sufferers for the
treatment of constipation.

1. On rising in the morning, remove the moist abdominal bandage (mentioned above); drink two-thirds
of a glass of cold water; and spend fifteen to twenty minutes in the following exercises, before
dressing: Abdominal lifting with deep breathing, auto-massage, leg raising, trunk twisting,
trunk bending--forward and to sides; lying down for the trunk raising, and sitting for the
trunk circumduction. Immediately following these exercises, go to stool. Have feet raised from
the floor eight or ten inches, in order to simulate the squatting position.

2. Breakfast should include bran or bran bread, and two or three of the following foods: Apples
with skins, grapefruit, cranberries with skins (but little sugar), and figs. Immediately after
breakfast walk fifteen minutes in the open air, practicing deep abdominal breathing. If the
results at stool before breakfast were not satisfactory, vaseline rectum and go to stool again.

3. Lunch should consist of fruit only, while dinner should include bran bread and two of the
following foods: Spinach, celery, carrots, parsnips, squash, or cabbage.

4. Before retiring, walk in the open air for fifteen minutes; after undressing, exercise same
as morning; and on retiring, apply the moist abdominal bandage.

ICHTHYOL SUPPOSITORIES

  Ichthyol                        5 per cent
  Cocoa Butter q. s. ad. to make 24 suppositories.

Sig. Use one suppository in the rectum each evening for hemorrhoids.

OIL ENEMA

The best way to administer an oil enema is by means of a special enema can which holds one
pint, to which is attached a rubber tube. It is wise not to use an ordinary fountain syringe
as the oil spoils the rubber very quickly. This oil is allowed to flow in slowly, under low
pressure, and should be retained over night. Any oil is acceptable, the cheaper sweet oils
will serve just as well as olive oil.

HOT COLONIC FLUSHING

The hot colonic flushing is particularly serviceable in combating the sick headaches of migraine.
They should be taken at night just before retiring with the temperature of water as hot as
can be borne, from 108 to 110 F. Half of the water is allowed to flow into the colon and is
retained as long as possible. This brings the heat in close contact with the sympathetic nervous
system whose headquarters is in the abdomen.

ENEMAS

Position for an Enema. Lie on left side, knees brought up against abdomen, with the left arm
well underneath. This will relax the abdominal muscles and allow the water to pass upward more
freely. The water should be allowed to flow until it is felt low on the right side.

The one, two, three enema is an injection that is used for the relief of gas in the bowel.
It consists of the following: One part epsom salts, two parts glycerine, and three parts soap
suds. It is introduced by the aid of the colon tube and retained as long as is possible.

Glycerine and soapy water, equal parts, may be introduced into the bowel for temporary relief
of a persistent constipation.

In instances when feeding by the mouth is impossible, nutrient enemas should be given every
three or four hours during the day. The absorption does not take place in the large bowel as
readily as in the small intestines, so only a small amount of a more highly concentrated solution
is given at one time. A child one year of age will be given one teaspoon, from one to four
years of age a teaspoon to a tablespoon is allowed, and up to twelve years from one to eight
tablespoons are given in the nutrient enema. Peptonized meat preparations may be employed in
greater concentration than directed by the use of the mouth. Peptonized milk containing an
egg is often used. The pepsin is added to the mixture only when warm, and is injected at once.

EMETICS

  1. A glass of warm water containing as much common table
     salt as can be dissolved.
  2. A teaspoon of mustard in a large glass of warm water.
  3. A teaspoon of syrup of ipecac, repeated in fifteen minutes
     if necessary.

Any one of these emetics is useful in instances where it is desirable to empty the stomach at once.

A CALORIE

A calorie is the heat unit used in the estimation of the fuel value of various foods. For instance,
an ordinary slice of homemade bread contains 100 calories. An ordinary fig contains almost
100 calories. A large orange or an apple or a glass of grape juice contains about 100 calories.
There are 100 calories in three teaspoons of sugar or honey.

A complete food list with the estimation of calorie value of foods is found in The Science
of Living, page 370, while on page 99 of the same book is a very helpful table showing the
amounts of various foods required to equal 100 calories. The reader will find this exceedingly
practical in estimating food values for the household.

ACIDIFYING AND ALKALINIZING FOODS

Since we find that in all acute diseases the acidity of the urine is greatly increased and
in time of health it is less acid, we submit two lists of foods which tend to acidify the urine
or to alkalinize the urine.

FOODS WHICH TEND TO ACIDIFY.

1. Animal Foods: All forms of flesh foods, fish, fowl, etc., including all kinds of meat broths,
soups, beef tea, bouillon, etc.

2. Eggs. 3. Breadstuffs: All kinds of breads, whether made of wheat, rye or corn, crackers,
toasts, griddle cakes, etc. 4. Pastries. All sorts of pies and cakes--except fruit pies, and
other desserts containing milk or sour fruits.

5. Cereals: Rice, oatmeal, and breakfast foods of all kinds, including the flaked and toasted
breakfast foods.

6. Peanuts, plums, prunes, and cranberries. Plums and cranberries fall in this column because
of their benzoic acid, which the body cannot fully oxidize.

FOODS WHICH TEND TO ALKALINIZE.

1. Dairy Products: Milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, cheese, buttermilk, etc.

2. Potatoes and bananas.

3. Soups: All forms of vegetable and fruit soups and broths.

4. Fruit Juices: All the fresh fruit juices except plums.

5. Fresh Fruits: All fresh fruits, sweet and sour, except plums and cranberries.

6. Vegetables: All kinds, especially beets, carrots, celery, lettuce, and muskmelon.

7. Dried Fruits: Figs, raisins, dates, currants--all except prunes.

8. The Legumes: Beans, peas, and lentils.

9. The Nuts: All the nuts belong in this column, including almonds and chestnuts.

CEREAL WATERS, ETC.

It is often necessary to give the infant or the young child cereal water to replace food in
occasions of summer diarrhoea, etc.

1. Barley Water.

One tablespoon of barley flour in one pint of water. Boil for one-half hour, strain, and add
sufficient boiled water to make one pint.

2. Flaxseed Tea.

One tablespoon of flaxseed, one pint of boiling water; let stand and keep warm for one hour;
strain. Add juice of lemon.

3. Oatmeal Jelly.

Four tablespoons of oatmeal, one pint of water; boil for three hours in double boiler, adding
water from time to time; strain.

4. Toast Water.

One, two, or three slices of bread toasted dark brown, but not burned. Put in one quart of
boiling water, cover, and strain when cold.

5. Arrowroot Water.

Wet two teaspoons of arrowroot with a little cold water, and rub until smooth; then stir into
one pint of boiling water and boil for five minutes, stirring all the while.

6. Oatmeal Water.

One tablespoon of oatmeal to one pint of boiling water, cover and let simmer for one hour.
Add water from time to time as it evaporates; strain.

7. Rice Water.

One tablespoon of (washed) rice to one pint of water. Boil three hours adding water from time
to time.

FRUIT JUICES

Fruit juices are exceedingly beneficial all through life; particularly is this true during
early childhood when the little ones are so likely to be constipated. Any of the fruit juices
are good, particularly the juices from oranges, raisins, prunes, apples, pears, and cranberries.
All these juices are better cooked than raw with the exception of orange juice. All children
should have some fruit juice every day. For the very young baby the juices are strained through
a wire strainer and a clean cheesecloth so as to remove every particle of solid matter, and
there should be added an equal amount of cold, boiled water for the infant under ten months.

LEMONADE AND EGGNOGS

Lemonade, along with orangeade, grapefruitade and limeade should be used for children above
a year. They should be well diluted and not too sweet.

Eggnogs are splendid for children who need to be helped along with their diet. They may be
given at the close of the meal, never between meals--unless so prescribed by a physician. The
stomach should have ample time to complete the work of digesting one meal before another partial
meal is allowed to enter it. Eggnogs consist of a well-beaten egg into which there is placed
a small amount of sugar, flavoring with either nutmeg, vanilla, or cinnamon, and the glass
filled up with rich milk.

MILKSHAKE

Milkshake is a delightful drink. The white of an egg with one or two teaspoons of sugar, two
tablespoons of chopped ice, flavoring, and one ounce of cream are briskly shaken in a milk-shaker
for two minutes. Cold milk is added to fill the glass.

MEAT AND MEAT JUICES

Beef extracts are regarded by the medical profession as purely stimulants. Beef juice is practically
without food value. In the preparation of beef juice the extractives and juices leave the fibre.
The food is in the fibre of the meat. The extractives are purely of a stimulating order. We
do not advocate the giving of beef tea and beef juices to children; as a rule, we think that
cereal, gruels, strained soups, and milk are preferable.

The only reason for cooking meats is to destroy the parasites such as tapeworm, trichina, etc.,
which are so often found in the meat. The cooking of meat decreases its digestibility, as raw
meat is more easily digested than cooked meat, but we feel it is necessary to advocate the
cooking of meat in order to kill the parasites. The above is the best form of egg for the young
child. Later on the eggs may be soft boiled or poached, or even soft scrambled.

SOUPS

Two varieties of soups are given children. In the early months of childhood, from six years
to eighteen months, the soups are usually strained, but after eighteen months, soups may be
thickened with flour and rich milk making a cream soup of it. Most vegetables make good soups.
The pulp from such vegetables as asparagus, carrots, beans, peas, tomatoes, and potatoes are
made into cream soups by the addition of a little flour, rich milk, butter, and a dash of salt.

BREADS

New breads should never be given to a child. Only bread twenty-four hours old should ever be
given to a child under six years; it should be cut into slices and allowed to dry out; and
even then is better if slightly toasted. We publish a recipe for bran bread and bran biscuits
which are exceedingly good for children and adults.

Recipe for Bran Bread.

Bran Biscuits. Mix one pint of bran, one-half pint of flour, and one level teaspoon of baking
soda. Mix one-half pint of milk and four tablespoons of molasses. Add this to the bran mixture
and bake in gem pans.
