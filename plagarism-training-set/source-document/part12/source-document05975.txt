The extinction of uncertain obligations would be a public boon, if only for their tendency
to produce discontent and habits of evasion. The reservations of timber and material, and right
of road-making, are hardly less impolitic. If the law should oblige a proprietor to accommodate
his country, equity prescribes his fair indemnity. A functionary might cut through a settler's
estate in malevolence, and destroy the approaches to his dwellings, under terms without tangible
limitation. In 1831, the government authorised a party to go through an orchard, planted on
a Macquarie grant, to enlarge a road to the ferry at Risdon. The owner brought his action,
and the assessors gave him a verdict. The lawyers pleaded the general invalidity of colonial
titles, and thus the right of the crown to resume! In 1824, the roads were thirty feet: in
1827, they were increased to sixty; and the attempt was made to take from a location given
under the old rule, the increased breadth stipulated by the new.[176]

"A strange rumour," said a colonial editor, "has reached us, that free grants of land will
be conferred no more." Lord Ripon's regulations were published in London, January 20th, 1831.
They were framed to obviate the theoretical and practical evils attributed to the easy acquisition
of land; to terminate the prodigality of governors, and the frequent quarrels occasioned by
their favoritism; and above all, to prevent laborers from becoming landholders, and the tendency
of colonists to scatter over territories they can not cultivate. This important change, which
excited alarm or exultation in the colonies, was only noticed in one London newspaper: with
such indifference was a system regarded, destined to produce the most important national consequences.

Except reserves intended for public use, crown lands were offered for sale to the highest bidders,
at the upset price of five shillings, and for the first time, to the usual reservation were
added precious metals.

Arthur, who greatly disapproved the application of these rules to Van Diemen's Land, where
no tendency to dispersion had been displayed, and where free grants of land formed the basis
of the convict system, manfully employed the last hours of patronage. The lands in the towns
were rapidly disposed of, and all who could prefer a reasonable claim, were readily indulged.
A few grants were bestowed by the special favor of Arthur: 205,000 acres were alienated chiefly
in grants of extension, due by the terms of the original grants. Those whose expectations were
satisfied, were not displeased with a measure which gave a definite value to estates, and when
once the principle was established, the higher the price of crown lands, the greater the nominal
value of their own.

A large number of persons, by neglect of the conditions, were liable to forfeiture; but among
them were several favorite officers of the governor, or members of his own family. It was stated,
without contradiction, that the surveyor-general sold his maximum grant for £1,700, when none
of the conditions were fulfilled. An attorney-general not only parted with his property, but
obtained afterwards a grant in extension for improvements he never made; and a gentleman, who
had not visited the country, but was related to several persons of influence, obtained both
a country and a town allotment.[177]

Lord Ripon's regulations disappointed many officers intending to settle in the Australian colonies;
but against this a provision was made (August, 1831), which entitled them to a remission of
from £150 to £300, according to rank. They were, however, to give bonds for residence on the
land so obtained.

The ready sale of waste lands seemed to justify their valuation by the crown. In 1832, £44,000
were netted, at nearly twelve shillings per acre. This high average was occasioned by the sale
of valuable reserves: those of Ross were sold, some portions at 29s. per acre. The governor
complained that the sale of town allotments led to speculation and limited improvements; he
therefore offered land on three years' leases, except at Hobart Town, at the usual quit-rent,
and exacted the promise to erect buildings of brick or stone. The absence of competition for
the country allotments threatened to limit the proprietorship; but this precaution was forbidden
by the secretary of state in 1835, when the system of granting lands at quit-rents finally
terminated.

SECTION XII.

A work of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, professed to detect the errors in British colonisation,
and to prescribe a new and more effective plan.[178] It consisted in selling land at "a sufficient
price" to combine labor and capital, to collect all the elements of civilisation, to prevent
the dispersion of population, the premature possession of land by the workman, and speculation
by jobbers. Thus a colony, on this model, was compared to a tree transplanted, the fibres of
its roots undivided, and its branches unbroken.

For several years previous to this decisive change, the desire had been widely expressed to
relieve the parent country by the emigration of paupers. Sir William Horton devoted great attention
to the subject. He visited various districts most oppressed by population, and pointed out
the methods available to an extensive removal. The Canada Company, which transacted much business
with him while under secretary of state, had purchased and re-sold crown lands; and many laborers,
who were transferred at their own expense to that country, rapidly improved their condition.
A committee of the Commons sat upon the subject, and a bill was introduced by Mr. Horton himself,
to authorise the parishes to mortgage their poor rates. It was once intended by the government
to levy a tax on convict laborers, and to increase its amount on artizans, and thus raise a
fund for emigration: this project, Arthur successfully resisted, and large permanent resources
were discovered in the sale of lands. The parishes were not willing to incur the outlay, and
it was opposed by many who were persuaded that the poverty of the laborer resulted from oppression.[179]
The intolerable degradation of the poor led to outrages and crimes. Large numbers were transported
for agrarian offences, and many others had no refuge, but to obtain deliverance from starvation
by less concerted violations of the law.

Agricultural laborers were driven from town to town; offered by auction at two-pence a day;
harnessed to gravel carts; mocked by being sent with a barley straw fifteen miles a day; imprisoned
in pits, and kept standing morning after morning in a public pound. Such were the scenes which
induced Horton to lecture through the country on redundant population and emigration; and to
call the attention of the parliament to the march of poverty, pauperism, tyranny, and crime.[180]

The proposition of Sir William Horton led to various projects of private parties, in furtherance
of colonisation. Grants of land were given to capitalists in proportion to the laborers they
conveyed; whom they were permitted to engage as indented servants. The scheme chiefly important
to Van Diemen's Land, was the settlement of Swan River. Four gentlemen proposed to government,
to convey 10,000 persons, for a grant equivalent. The minister thought the project too vast.
Three of the four declined: Mr. Thomas Peel, a relative of Sir Robert Peel, still persevered.
Many persons entrusted their capital to agents, who presented it, and obtained a title to possessions
they never intended to cultivate.

By the regulations published at Downing-street (December 5th, 1828), the settlers were allowed
40 acres for every £3 of invested capital; 200 acres for every laborer conveyed. No convicts,
or any other description of prisoners, were to be sent; but land granted, was to be forfeited,
unless improved within twenty-one years. Thus, those who conveyed laborers, were met by competitors
who had incurred no such expenses; and the conditions imposed neutralised each other. The settler
who carried out labour, found his servant desert him to occupy land acquired by the capitalist
who carried out money. Of three hundred persons embarked by Mr. Peel, in a few months not one
remained to light his fire; but the recreant workmen were soon reduced to want. Many, under
their broken indentures, claimed relief of Mr. Peel, whose flocks had been scattered, and his
property destroyed by their desertion. He was glad to hide from their violence, while they
were embarking for the neighbouring colonies. Respectable families were compelled to perform
the most menial offices, and young women of education were reduced to rags. Contributions of
clothing were collected and forwarded by the ladies of Cornwall. Many were brought to Van Diemen's
Land, as to a city of refuge: the population, from 4,000, decreased to 1,500, and the ruined
landholders petitioned the government for a share of convict labour--a boon which the elder
colonies deprecated, and the minister refused (1835).

Swan River seemed to promise a desirable market, and the merchants dispatched vessels with
provisions and cattle: Mr. Gellibrand speculated largely. On the whole, the returns were not
equal to the outlay; and although sometimes great profits were realised, Van Diemen's Land
was injured by the trade.

Scarcely were the settlers of Western Australia landed, when another colony, Spencer's Gulf,
was projected. The authors of this scheme imputed serious detects to the plan of its immediate
predecessor. The low price and extensive holdings, the want of combinable laborers, and the
imperfect organisation of its social fabric, seemed to account for its disasters. A body of
persons, concurring in the Wakefield system of colonisation, and comprehending many members
of the House of Commons, formed themselves into an association, and applied to the government
for the necessary powers. After considerable discussion, the minister declined their proposal,
and the realisation of their hopes was deferred several years. The more active partisans of
the scheme kept it before the public. An act passed the legislature on the 15th of August,
1834, empowering the crown to erect South Australia into a British province. Commissioners
were appointed for the sale of land, and for the conveyance of emigrants. It was determined
that the price should be sufficient to prevent laborers from buying land, and furnish the cost
of their emigration. The company were authorised to borrow £50,000. If, at the expiration of
ten years, the population should not reach 20,000, the control of the land was to revert to
the crown. With a population of 50,000, they were to obtain the rights of political freedom,
and no convict ship was to anchor on their shores. The upset price was at first £1, and, for
a time, 12s. per acre. The intended colony was viewed with distrust by the elder settlements
for the theoretical character of the plan, and its entire opposition to the then prevailing
notions of penal labour. The advocates of the enterprise lost no occasion to denounce the social
condition of Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales; where, however, the scheme was pronounced
insane, and destined to certain disorder and ultimate overthrow. The appearance of new speculators
in the Australian colonies compensated them for these reproaches. In publishing their plans,
the company had always referred to supplies within their vicinity, as an immediate and certain
reserve. The Tasmanian merchants met them on the shore of the royal province. Sheep were sent
over as the basis of their flocks; timber for their huts; and the various produce of rural
wealth, originally brought at great cost from Europe. A long succession of adventurers raised
the value of produce throughout the colonies; and individuals realised large profits in the
trade; but when the arrivals from England ceased, the new colony was involved in whatever misfortunes
its peculiar plan was supposed to avert. Many hundreds, driven out by poverty, settled in the
penal colonies, and the property of Adelaide became unsaleable: the frail dwellings were deserted,
and the land lay utterly waste. Of the Adelaide traders, scarcely a house escaped insolvency,
and the loss was total. Those who remained turned their land to account: their flocks increased,
and the discovery of the mines happily realised more than their early hopes. The lands sold
by the company were freed from the mineral reservation.

An old gentleman, named Mengè, formerly an attendant on a distinguished German geologist, was
the discoverer of its mineral riches. He was employed by Mr. George F. Angus to select his
special surveys. His occasional choice of rocks and barren soil excited ridicule and astonishment;
but he was accustomed to say, "the wealth is below, not upon the ground." He lived in the cleft
of a rock at the junction of the Gawler and Para, near a plot of forty acres, almost surrounded
with water, where he cultivated melons of every variety. He spoke many languages, and had travelled
through Germany, Switzerland, and Iceland. A mineral collection he made, is in the University
Museum, Edinburgh. His excursions in South Australia were intrepid, and extended far: he carried
a wallet and a hammer, and subsisted during his wandering on gum. His conversation was visionary;
and his predictions, at the time, but little regarded.

The coast of New Holland, opposite to Van Diemen's Land, was almost neglected since the removal
of the colony in 1803. Various reports were brought by whalers of its suitableness for sheep
farming. Howell, Hume, and Batman had explored the country in 1824, and had acquired some knowledge
of its quality. In 1827, an application was made by Messrs. J. T. Gellibrand and Batman to
General Darling, for permission to land stock, to the amount of £5,000, in the neighbourhood
of Western Port. This project failed; but in 1835, Mr. Batman, called the Australian Penn,
acting for certain colonists, of whom a nephew of Arthur was one, proceeded to Port Phillip.
Several Sydney blacks, under his care, had acquired the English language, and accompanied him
thither. This important expedition embarked in a colonial vessel, and landed on the 26th May,
on the shore of Port Phillip. The civilised blacks were now decked with native ornaments, and
advanced towards the fires of the aborigines; but they had fled. They were, however, tracked
by Batman's company, who opened a friendly conference, and were perfectly understood. The natives
displayed some apprehension, and intimated they had already experienced injury from the English.
Batman gave them presents of tomahawks and trinkets, and conciliated their fullest confidence.
Some time after, the party met the chief of another tribe, who had heard reports of the white
man's liberality: he conducted them towards the huts; but in their progress they were surprised
by an hostile array of the natives. The blacks of Batman's party called out to them, and amity
was established. Batman took the spear of the chief, who carried his gun. He then proposed
to live among them: the conditions were explained to their satisfaction. The treaty of Penn
with the Indians was the model of the covenant with the tribe of Dutegaller. They conveyed
a track of 600,000 acres, for blankets and other objects of native desire, and an annual payment
of similar articles to the value of £200. This deed was signed, sealed, and delivered by the
natives in due form.

The report of this expedition was presented to Arthur, who warmly concurred in the occupation,
and approved the consideration of native rights; but observed that those rights had been disregarded
in the recent colonisation of South Australia, and that Port Phillip was within the government
of New South Wales. Arthur was desirous of making that territory dependent on Van Diemen's
Land. The minister favorably noticed the proposal; but in the meantime Governor Bourke asserted
his claim, and declared the company intruders, and their bargains with the natives void.

Notwithstanding, the colony now opened was occupied by many adventurers. Their sheep were rapidly
transferred, and the greater portion of the early inhabitants were settlers from Van Diemen's
Land. The settlement was suffered with reluctance. The theory of concentration had been adopted
only a few months before; but, except by setting up a government on the spot, it was found
that an illegal occupation of land could not be prevented. Governor Bourke wrote to the secretary
of state, that whatever the general wisdom of concentration, an opposite course was necessary
for pastoral wealth; and that to neglect nutritious food, would be to reject "the bounty of
providence." He proposed to sell the land in townships, and employ the proceeds in the public
service.

Lord Glenelg confessed that the scheme of concentration was not of universal application: that
Lord Ripon's regulations were not everywhere desirable, and that it was proper to tolerate
the ardour of private enterprise; to moderate its course, and gather up its fruits. The Dutegaller
association was dissolved; but not until they had given an impulse to colonisation, more rapid
than any example offered by history. This peaceable occupation, contrasted with the cruelties
inflicted at Twofold Bay--a whaling station, now rising into a province.

While these plans of colonisation were in progress, the social condition of the penal colonies
was constantly discussed. To correct the evils admitted on the spot, and to obviate the dangers
apprehended at home, it was determined by the ministers to promote the emigration of mechanics
and females. One series of plans were proposed for New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, and
with the same general results. The policy of government required the emigration of free mechanics.

The employment of prisoner artizans by the local government, was disapproved by the crown,
and Colonel Arthur was instructed to assign them to masters, and contract for public works.
In defending this measure, he had maintained that the high rate of wages would subvert the
design of transportation: the employer would indulge the workmen, and to obtain their full
strength supply the means of sensual gratification.

In 1831, a notice appeared inviting the opinions of the colonists on the subject of emigration.
Lord Goderich solicited the assistance of the settlers in removing the population which the
colonies might employ, and England spare. They were requested to state what amount of money
they would engage to afford, and what class of servants they required. Such as contributed
to the cost were promised a preferable claim to engage them. The notice was received in silence:
no public meeting was held. The servants of the Van Diemen's Land Company had generally deserted
their employers; and in the colonies, the valuation of pauper laborers, compared with convicts,
was not great; and although some extended their views beyond the moment, the chief object of
most persons was to secure a fortune and be gone. The settlers dreaded the vicinity of small
farmers, as fatal to the discipline of their men, and to the safety of their flocks.[181]

This notice was on its way, when Lord Howick, on the behalf of the colonial-office, addressed
the lords of the treasury, and proposed a loan of £10,000, to be repayed by the land fund.
The proceeds of sales were then a matter of conjecture; but it was the opinion of the secretary
of state, that these resources should be devoted to emigration, especially of females. He calculated
that a growing population would more than compensate for the cost, by extending the basis of
colonial revenue (1831). In this view their lordships concurred, and a commission was instantly
appointed, to carry out the design.

During this emigration the supply of labor exceeded the demand, and a benevolent society was
formed to succour the numerous poor. The governor advised that no laborers, except mechanics,
should be sent, and four members of the legislative council protested against the outlay. They
stated that the support of 10,000 prisoners, without expense to England, was a sufficient benefit
for a colony to confer; that the "poor house prisoners," and the "gaol prisoners," were equally
demoralised; and the first more insolent and uncontrollable. They contended that the expenditure
of the land fund out of the colony was to complete the mischief resulting from the cessation
of grants, "the calamities of which it was fearful to anticipate."[182]

The colony was thought likely to afford a desirable home for Chelsea pensioners, who commuted
their pensions for four years' payment. Forty-six embarked in the Science, with Messrs. Backhouse
and Walker, whose reports of their conduct explain their subsequent misfortunes. They were
intemperate and thriftless, and passed the voyage in disorder. The women were nothing superior
to their husbands.[183] On their arrival, they expended their money, and sunk into misery.
To this there were some exceptions, and here and there an old soldier may be found, whose property
has risen in value, to a competence for his declining life. The land they were enabled to acquire
was, however, generally too small in quantity to yield a living, from their unskilled and irregular
toil. Their distress excited more discussion than sympathy. They requested the sheriff to call
a meeting, to inform the crown of "their unspeakable sufferings."

The home government resolved to advance £20 to married mechanics willing to emigrate to this
colony. They gave the parties the amount, who were expected to sign a warrant of attorney for
its repayment within two years. Many emigrated, but few paid: a Mr. John Hose, who did so,
was noticed for his singular honesty; but the greater part evaded the liability with success.
Females were expected to repay £8 towards their passage; but many were minors, and the proof
of their hand-writing was not easy, and few regarded the obligation as just. The demand of
this pledge contracted the choice of emigrants: many country girls refused to sign their names
to a paper, promising a sum equal to the English wages of a year; or to enter into engagements,
of which they could not see the end. The ordinary revenue was charged with payment and collection
arising from this scheme; but the land fund eventually defrayed the loss.

A succession of vessels, with mechanics and females, anchored at Hobart Town: the Amelia Thompson
at Launceston. A committee of ladies in London, of whom Mrs. Fry was the most distinguished,
undertook the selection of the females. They were commended for their philanthropy and care
in England: in the colonies, they received but little praise. Mr. Marshall, a considerable
shipowner, was appointed agent. To fill his vessels, was said to be the main object of his
efforts, and that he held a low scale of female morality would not be unacceptable. The statements
of the colonial press were often undiscriminating and highly unjust: many valuable women were
included in these immigrations; many were girls of tender years, whose chief fault was their
ignorance.

The debarkation of these females occasioned scenes, more subjects of regret than of wonder.
Thus, on the arrival of the Strathfieldsay (1834), the fair emigrants, 286, most of good character,
were indiscreetly landed at high noon: 2,000 persons awaited them on the beach. Their feelings
were outraged with ribaldry and insult: they were astounded at their reception, and many wept.
The ladies of the colony protected and advanced them; and some, whose want drove them from
their native country, remember the day with gratitude when they first pressed the soil of Tasmania.
1,280 females were brought to the colony in three years, ending 1835; and rather more to New
South Wales.

The emigrant rarely appears to advantage: the occupation of a new sphere, in which his position
is uncertain, renders his manners awkward, and his expectations ridiculous. The disorderly
conduct of many made their presence a burden, and their civil condition no great advantage
to their masters. Yet, since it was necessary to labor or to starve, the greater portion chose
the better alternative; and the women of decent habits, found that destiny for which nature
designed them.

The extravagant expectations formed by many emigrants, fostered by reports of individual success,
which when substantially true are still exaggerated by fancy, were commonly disappointed. The
suspicious coolness of strangers; the high price of provisions; the comfortless dwellings,
with their awkward fuel; the absence of conveniences, which are not valued until lost; and
the memory of home, produced a depression of spirits, only overcome by reason or youth. But
their complaints of after years, are the result of affectation and habit: they pretend to have
sacrificed a lot, from which in reality they escaped; and forget that in the midst of those
scenes they profess to regret, they often wanted a meal.

A curious instance occurred at an early time: a settler took a location order and provisions,
and went out to commence his labors. He was disheartened by the obstruction of the forest:
at his first stroke, the axe was shivered; he threw it down in despair, and returned home in
the vessel that brought him out.

The emigrants were not, on the whole, inferior to other persons of their education and calling;
and were often justified in resisting the tyrannical spirit and disposition to oppress, which
the habits of colonial life do not extinguish. This emigration, amounting to 7,000 for both
colonies, is an epoch to be remembered for its influence on their fate.

These events revolutionised the social state of the colonies. Free workmen and their families
formed an intermediate class, whose interests were hostile to a penal government, and to bond
labor in every form. The individual importance of employers consoled them for their political
dependence; and the subservience of transportation to their material prosperity, reconciled
them to the restrictions it imposed. The free workman found it an obstacle to his advancement:
it depressed his wages and debased his position, but gave him nothing. If his industry raised
him, he yet retained the sympathies of his early life: he remained distrustful of the rich,
jealous of rank, and fond of the equality of human rights. Trial by jury, legislative assemblies,
and official responsibility, found earnest advocates, where they had often been mere rallying
points of personal discontent.

All this was foreseen by Arthur: when free laborers were intruded by the crown, the great bond
of his system was broken.
