This same summer arrived at Athens thirteen hundred targeteers, Thracian swordsmen of the tribe
of the Dii, who were to have sailed to Sicily with Demosthenes. Since they had come too late,
the Athenians determined to send them back to Thrace, whence they had come; to keep them for
the Decelean war appearing too expensive, as the pay of each man was a drachma a day. Indeed
since Decelea had been first fortified by the whole Peloponnesian army during this summer,
and then occupied for the annoyance of the country by the garrisons from the cities relieving
each other at stated intervals, it had been doing great mischief to the Athenians; in fact
this occupation, by the destruction of property and loss of men which resulted from it, was
one of the principal causes of their ruin. Previously the invasions were short, and did not
prevent their enjoying their land during the rest of the time: the enemy was now permanently
fixed in Attica; at one time it was an attack in force, at another it was the regular garrison
overrunning the country and making forays for its subsistence, and the Lacedaemonian king,
Agis, was in the field and diligently prosecuting the war; great mischief was therefore done
to the Athenians. They were deprived of their whole country: more than twenty thousand slaves
had deserted, a great part of them artisans, and all their sheep and beasts of burden were
lost; and as the cavalry rode out daily upon excursions to Decelea and to guard the country,
their horses were either lamed by being constantly worked upon rocky ground, or wounded by
the enemy.

Besides, the transport of provisions from Euboea, which had before been carried on so much
more quickly overland by Decelea from Oropus, was now effected at great cost by sea round Sunium;
everything the city required had to be imported from abroad, and instead of a city it became
a fortress. Summer and winter the Athenians were worn out by having to keep guard on the fortifications,
during the day by turns, by night all together, the cavalry excepted, at the different military
posts or upon the wall. But what most oppressed them was that they had two wars at once, and
had thus reached a pitch of frenzy which no one would have believed possible if he had heard
of it before it had come to pass. For could any one have imagined that even when besieged by
the Peloponnesians entrenched in Attica, they would still, instead of withdrawing from Sicily,
stay on there besieging in like manner Syracuse, a town (taken as a town) in no way inferior
to Athens, or would so thoroughly upset the Hellenic estimate of their strength and audacity,
as to give the spectacle of a people which, at the beginning of the war, some thought might
hold out one year, some two, none more than three, if the Peloponnesians invaded their country,
now seventeen years after the first invasion, after having already suffered from all the evils
of war, going to Sicily and undertaking a new war nothing inferior to that which they already
had with the Peloponnesians? These causes, the great losses from Decelea, and the other heavy
charges that fell upon them, produced their financial embarrassment; and it was at this time
that they imposed upon their subjects, instead of the tribute, the tax of a twentieth upon
all imports and exports by sea, which they thought would bring them in more money; their expenditure
being now not the same as at first, but having grown with the war while their revenues decayed.

Accordingly, not wishing to incur expense in their present want of money, they sent back at
once the Thracians who came too late for Demosthenes, under the conduct of Diitrephes, who
was instructed, as they were to pass through the Euripus, to make use of them if possible in
the voyage alongshore to injure the enemy. Diitrephes first landed them at Tanagra and hastily
snatched some booty; he then sailed across the Euripus in the evening from Chalcis in Euboea
and disembarking in Boeotia led them against Mycalessus. The night he passed unobserved near
the temple of Hermes, not quite two miles from Mycalessus, and at daybreak assaulted and took
the town, which is not a large one; the inhabitants being off their guard and not expecting
that any one would ever come up so far from the sea to molest them, the wall too being weak,
and in some places having tumbled down, while in others it had not been built to any height,
and the gates also being left open through their feeling of security. The Thracians bursting
into Mycalessus sacked the houses and temples, and butchered the inhabitants, sparing neither
youth nor age, but killing all they fell in with, one after the other, children and women,
and even beasts of burden, and whatever other living creatures they saw; the Thracian race,
like the bloodiest of the barbarians, being even more so when it has nothing to fear. Everywhere
confusion reigned and death in all its shapes; and in particular they attacked a boys' school,
the largest that there was in the place, into which the children had just gone, and massacred
them all. In short, the disaster falling upon the whole town was unsurpassed in magnitude,
and unapproached by any in suddenness and in horror.

Meanwhile the Thebans heard of it and marched to the rescue, and overtaking the Thracians before
they had gone far, recovered the plunder and drove them in panic to the Euripus and the sea,
where the vessels which brought them were lying. The greatest slaughter took place while they
were embarking, as they did not know how to swim, and those in the vessels on seeing what was
going on on on shore moored them out of bowshot: in the rest of the retreat the Thracians made
a very respectable defence against the Theban horse, by which they were first attacked, dashing
out and closing their ranks according to the tactics of their country, and lost only a few
men in that part of the affair. A good number who were after plunder were actually caught in
the town and put to death. Altogether the Thracians had two hundred and fifty killed out of
thirteen hundred, the Thebans and the rest who came to the rescue about twenty, troopers and
heavy infantry, with Scirphondas, one of the Boeotarchs. The Mycalessians lost a large proportion
of their population.

While Mycalessus thus experienced a calamity for its extent as lamentable as any that happened
in the war, Demosthenes, whom we left sailing to Corcyra, after the building of the fort in
Laconia, found a merchantman lying at Phea in Elis, in which the Corinthian heavy infantry
were to cross to Sicily. The ship he destroyed, but the men escaped, and subsequently got another
in which they pursued their voyage. After this, arriving at Zacynthus and Cephallenia, he took
a body of heavy infantry on board, and sending for some of the Messenians from Naupactus, crossed
over to the opposite coast of Acarnania, to Alyzia, and to Anactorium which was held by the
Athenians. While he was in these parts he was met by Eurymedon returning from Sicily, where
he had been sent, as has been mentioned, during the winter, with the money for the army, who
told him the news, and also that he had heard, while at sea, that the Syracusans had taken
Plemmyrium. Here, also, Conon came to them, the commander at Naupactus, with news that the
twenty-five Corinthian ships stationed opposite to him, far from giving over the war, were
meditating an engagement; and he therefore begged them to send him some ships, as his own eighteen
were not a match for the enemy's twenty-five. Demosthenes and Eurymedon, accordingly, sent
ten of their best sailers with Conon to reinforce the squadron at Naupactus, and meanwhile
prepared for the muster of their forces; Eurymedon, who was now the colleague of Demosthenes,
and had turned back in consequence of his appointment, sailing to Corcyra to tell them to man
fifteen ships and to enlist heavy infantry; while Demosthenes raised slingers and darters from
the parts about Acarnania.

Meanwhile the envoys, already mentioned, who had gone from Syracuse to the cities after the
capture of Plemmyrium, had succeeded in their mission, and were about to bring the army that
they had collected, when Nicias got scent of it, and sent to the Centoripae and Alicyaeans
and other of the friendly Sicels, who held the passes, not to let the enemy through, but to
combine to prevent their passing, there being no other way by which they could even attempt
it, as the Agrigentines would not give them a passage through their country. Agreeably to this
request the Sicels laid a triple ambuscade for the Siceliots upon their march, and attacking
them suddenly, while off their guard, killed about eight hundred of them and all the envoys,
the Corinthian only excepted, by whom fifteen hundred who escaped were conducted to Syracuse.

About the same time the Camarinaeans also came to the assistance of Syracuse with five hundred
heavy infantry, three hundred darters, and as many archers, while the Geloans sent crews for
five ships, four hundred darters, and two hundred horse. Indeed almost the whole of Sicily,
except the Agrigentines, who were neutral, now ceased merely to watch events as it had hitherto
done, and actively joined Syracuse against the Athenians.

While the Syracusans after the Sicel disaster put off any immediate attack upon the Athenians,
Demosthenes and Eurymedon, whose forces from Corcyra and the continent were now ready, crossed
the Ionian Gulf with all their armament to the Iapygian promontory, and starting from thence
touched at the Choerades Isles lying off Iapygia, where they took on board a hundred and fifty
Iapygian darters of the Messapian tribe, and after renewing an old friendship with Artas the
chief, who had furnished them with the darters, arrived at Metapontium in Italy. Here they
persuaded their allies the Metapontines to send with them three hundred darters and two galleys,
and with this reinforcement coasted on to Thurii, where they found the party hostile to Athens
recently expelled by a revolution, and accordingly remained there to muster and review the
whole army, to see if any had been left behind, and to prevail upon the Thurians resolutely
to join them in their expedition, and in the circumstances in which they found themselves to
conclude a defensive and offensive alliance with the Athenians.
