"I rejoice to think that it is not necessary to close these observations by combating objections
to the diffusion of science among the working classes, arising from considerations of a political
nature. Happily the time is past and gone when bigots could persuade mankind that the lights
of philosophy were to be extinguished as dangerous to religion; and when tyrants could proscribe
the instructors of the people as enemies to their power. It is preposterous to imagine that
the enlargement of our acquaintance with the laws which regulate the universe, can dispose
to unbelief. It may be a cure for superstition--for intolerance it will be the most certain
cure; but a pure and true religion has nothing to fear from the greatest expansion which the
understanding can receive by the study either of matter or of mind. The more widely science
is diffused, the better will the Author of all things be known, and the less will the people
be 'tossed to and fro by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait
to deceive.' To tyrants, indeed, and bad rulers, the progress of knowledge among the mass of
mankind is a just object of terror: it is fatal to them and their designs; they know this by
unerring instinct, and unceasingly they dread the light. But they will find it more easy to
curse than to extinguish. It is spreading in spite of them, even in those countries where arbitrary
power deems itself most secure; and in England, any attempt to check its progress would only
bring about the sudden destruction of him who should be insane enough to make it.

"To the Upper Classes of society, then, I would say, that the question no longer is whether
or not the people shall be instructed--for that has been determined long ago, and the decision
is irreversible--but whether they shall be well or ill taught--half informed or as thoroughly
as their circumstances permit and their wants require. Let no one be afraid of the bulk of
the community becoming too accomplished for their superiors. Well educated, and even well versed
in the most elevated sciences, they assuredly may become; and the worst consequence that can
follow to their superiors will be, that to deserve being called their betters, they too must
devote themselves more to the pursuit of solid and refined learning; the present public seminaries
must be enlarged: and some of the greater cities of the kingdom, especially the metropolis,
must not be left destitute of the regular means within themselves of scientific education.

"To the Working Classes I would say, that this is the time when by a great effort they may
secure for ever the inestimable blessing of knowledge. Never was the disposition more universal
among the rich to lend the requisite assistance for setting in motion the great engines of
instruction; but the people must come forward to profit by the opportunity thus afforded, and
they must themselves continue the movement once begun. Those who have already started in the
pursuit of science, and tasted its sweets, require no exhortation to persevere; but if these
pages should fall into the hands of any one at an hour for the first time stolen from his needful
rest after his day's work is done, I ask of him to reward me (who have written them for his
benefit at the like hours) by saving threepence during the next fortnight, buying with it Franklin's
Life, and reading the first page. I am quite sure he will read the rest; I am almost quite
sure he will resolve to spend his spare time and money, in gaining those kinds of knowledge
which from a printer's boy made that great man the first philosopher, and one of the first
statesmen of his age. Few are fitted by nature to go as far as he did, and it is not necessary
to lead so perfectly abstemious a life, and to be so rigidly saving of every instant of time.
But all may go a good way after him, both in temperance, industry, and knowledge, and no one
can tell before he tries how near he may be able to approach him."

We may here mention that in 1825, Lord Brougham was elected Lord Rector of the University of
Glasgow; his opponent, Sir Walter Scott, lost the election by the casting vote of Sir James
Mackintosh, in favour of Lord Brougham.

Among the originators of the London University, Lord Brougham occupies a foremost rank, and
partly by the aid of his indefatigable talents, that establishment was opened, in 1828, within
seventeen months from the day on which the first stone was laid.

Early in the year 1827 was established "the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,"
of which Lord Brougham became, and continues to this day, chairman. In the original prospectus,
issued under his sanction, we find "The object of the Society is strictly limited to what its
title imports, namely, the imparting useful information to all classes of the community, particularly
to such as are unable to avail themselves of experienced teachers, or may prefer learning by
themselves." The Society commenced their labours by a set of Treatises, the first or "Preliminary
Treatise," "On the objects, pleasures, and advantages of Science," being from the pen of Lord
Brougham; and in perspicuity and popular interest, this treatise is unrivalled in our times.
His Lordship is also understood, in conjunction with Mr. Charles Bell, to be engaged in illustrating
with notes an edition of Paley's works, to be published by the above Society.

In the preceding outline of the political life of Lord Brougham, we have quoted but few points
of his personal character. This has been so well drawn, and so recently too, that we are induced
to adopt the following traits from a contemporary Magazine.[5] The paper whence these are extracted,
purports to be a description of the Lord Chancellor's first levee:--

"Unfeigned respect for, and a slight personal acquaintance with, the noble person who now holds
the seals, led me to attend his last levee. The practice of receiving the respects of the public
on one or two stated occasions is sufficiently ancient, but I have understood was discontinued,
or not much observed, in the latter days of Lord Eldon. It was revived with somewhat greater
splendour by Lord Lyndhurst, but still it attracted little public notice. I incline to think
that it was reserved for Brougham to illustrate the ancient custom, by the splendour of those
who chose to be dutiful to the Lord Chancellor. The fashion of going to court is such, that
it infers little personal respect to the individual monarch; but the practice of attending
the levee of an inferior personage is to be ascribed to the respect which individual eminence
commands. When Lord Brougham announced his levees, it could not be known whether he should
receive the homage of the aristocracy, to whom it was not supposed that his lordship's politics
were very amicable. It was moreover thought that the republican, or, to speak more guardedly,
the whig Lord Chancellor would care little for a custom in which there was no manifest utility.
He had declared that the gewgaws of office delighted him not; and I dare say he would fain
bring his mind to believe that all ceremonial was idle, perhaps contemptible. But it is the
greatest mistake to suppose that Lord Brougham is inattentive to the ceremonies with which
his high place is surrounded. A careful observer will see clearly that imposing forms are perfectly
agreeable to his mind; nobody could ridicule form better, so long as he held no situation which
required the observance of customary rules; but elevated to his present distinction, it is
plain that he enjoys all the little peculiarities of his office. Somebody said that he presided
in the House of Lords in a bar whig, and instanced the fact as a proof of his reforming temper;
but it was not true. Accident may have obliged him to take his seat in this ungainly form,
but he had no purpose of deviating from the ancient full-bottom, and he is now to be seen in
all the amplitude of the olden fleece. In like manner he observes the strict regime, so fantastical
to a stranger, of causing counsel to be shouted for from without, although they are actually
present; and he adds to the oddness of this custom by receiving them with a most imposing mien,
and putting on his chapeau as they advance. This is a form, for which the model is not to be
found in the practice of his immediate predecessors. It is possible, however, that his extensive
and minute reading may have made him aware that Wolsey, peradventure, or some great chancellor
of old, had the fancy to be covered when the suppliants approached. Let any one observe with
what studied dignity he performs the duty of announcing the royal assent to Acts of Parliament:
he assumes a solemnity of tone for which his voice is not ill-fitted, but which is unusual
with him. These small circumstances, and many such which might be mentioned, show that State
is not uncongenial to his mind. Why should it? His weakness consists in the unreal contempt
for what is not really contemptible. With his high notions of office, I should have been surprised
if he had foregone the levee; and assuredly he has not reckoned without reason; for a more
splendid or flattering pageant could not be witnessed than that which his rooms exhibited.
Unquestionably the most remarkable man in the empire at this moment, it is his fortune to attract
the honourable regards of all who are distinguished as compeers. It is not my intention to
offer any estimate of what I conceive to be his genuine worth, as he may be appreciated in
a more dispassionate time; I speak of him only as a great man filling a very large space in
the consideration of the empire. Judging from the throng of all classes upon this occasion,
whose favour is desirable, no man is more popular * * *. The Chancellor took his place at a
corner of the room, backed by his chaplain, and was soon encircled by the visitants; his dress
remarkably plain, being a simple suit of velvet in the court cut. The names were announced
from the bottom of the stairs, and each person as he entered walked up to the Chancellor and
offered his respects. The numbers were so great that it was impossible to devote any marked
attention to each; as soon, therefore, as the visiter had made his bow, he retired into the
throng, or took his departure through the adjoining room. I was not present at the first of
the levees which were held, and at which the attendance was very distinguished; but a friend
who was, spoke very highly of the manner in which the Chancellor performed his noviciate. The
Archbishop of Canterbury came early, and was very kindly received: he was followed by the Archbishop
of York, and several other bishops, whose attendance gave proof that, differ as they might
from Lord Brougham, they surely did not consider him an enemy to the Church * * *. The most
remarkable visiter of that evening was the Duke of Wellington;--the crowd was astonished, and
I dare say the Chancellor himself was surprised, when his name was sent up--I doubt if they
had ever met in the same room before. Their political lives, with the exception of the Catholic
Question, were one unvarying course of opposition, if not enmity. I suspect that for a time
the Duke despised the talk of the lawyer; and, on the other hand, Brougham had often declared,
that the respect which he entertained for military glory was not very lofty. Some of his bitterest
tirades were levelled at the Duke personally. No one will deny that it was high-minded in the
Duke to lay aside resentment of every sort, and offer this mark of respect as well to the man
as the office. The Chancellor was flattered by the attention, and shook the Duke by the hand
very cordially * * *. Not the least remarkable personage in the room was the Lord Advocate
of Scotland. Brougham and he are very old friends, and have been much engaged in the same species
of literature. Brougham was his predecessor in the editorship of the Edinburgh Review--a fact
which is not generally known, but which is certain. Brougham was not the first editor, having
filled that office for a short time after Sidney Smith withdrew from the situation. Jeffrey
appeared extremely petit in his court-dress, and did not seem very much at home: he was acquainted
with but few of his fellow visiters, and had too much good taste to occupy much of the Chancellor's
attention: they did not seem to hold any conversation beyond the usual common-place inquiries
* * *. After I had paid my respects to the Chancellor, there came tripping up the Marquess
of Bristol, with a springy step, which he must surely have acquired at the old court of France;
for I am sure that no such movement could be attained on English ground. The elasticity of
this noble lord was such, that when once put in motion, he continued to spring up and down
in the manner of the Chinese figures, which are hawked by the Italian toy-venders. Had I been
told that the head of the house of Newry was a dancing-master, who had not yet learned the
present modes, I should certainly have believed the story without scruple, if I had met him
anywhere else. He had no sooner left the Chancellor, than he was laid hold of by a fidgetty
solicitor, who was the only member of his class in the room, and who, I understand, is a sort
of favourite of the Chancellor. The obsequious grin, and the affected ease of this worthy,
do not convey any very favourable impression on his behalf. He was solicitor for the Queen,
and in this capacity formed an intimacy with her chief counsel, which an ill-natured person
would perhaps think makes him now forget in some measure the great disparity betwixt their
present condition. The Chancellor gave no discouragement to his familiarity * * *. A variety
of lords, squires, generals, ossa innominata followed, for whom the Chancellor cared perhaps
about as much as I did. At length Sir James Scarlett was announced, and the Chancellor left
his place to meet him. His welcome was very hearty. Brougham was doubtless gratified by this
token of respect from a man who was indisputably his leader in the courts, and for whose forensic
abilities it is known, that he entertains, and has often expressed, the highest admiration.
The position of the two men was singular, and to the ex-attorney not very enviable. Scarlett
was in high practice before Brougham was even called to the bar. He kept a head of him in their
profession throughout; and twice he had filled the first places at the bar, when the respective
attainments of these eminent persons were such, that if Brougham had been placed before him,
Scarlett would have had just ground of complaint; and the bar would have unanimously decried
the appointment. Now, however, by one of those cross accidents which will occur in the most
fortunate lives, Scarlett was, with strict justice and universal acquiescence, placed below
his former competitor, and in direct opposition to all the early friends with whom he commenced
his political career. It was matter of necessity and of course that he should go out when his
employers were obliged to surrender office; and no man could complain that Brougham should
then be elevated to a distinction, which in other circumstances Scarlett might have thought
his own by indisputable right * * *. The Speaker of the House of Commons was then announced.
Brougham and he met as warm friends, though certainly men having little in kindred. In point
of talent there is no ground of comparison; yet it may be doubted whether they are not nearly
as great in their own way. I have no notion of the place which the Speaker held in parliament
before he was elected to the chair, and I know few situations which require more tact and management.
In these qualifications the present Speaker is signally gifted. He brings a degree of good
nature to the office, which no event, however untoward, can ruffle;--his calmness never forsakes
him: he is the same easy, dignified chairman at all times. The Commons are a truly turbulent
body, but they are not impatient of his sway. In all emergencies he is vigorously supported:
in his hands, the authority of his office, though rarely exercised, has lost none of its force.
Brougham himself was one of the most fiery spirits in this hot region; but a word from the
Speaker would calm him in an instant. Among other qualifications for command, he is possessed
of a fine mellow, deep-toned voice, which, while it powerfully enunciates the "Order," frees
the command from all harshness or severity. As the first commoner in the land, and a truly
estimable gentleman, he was entitled to be well received * * *. The last person of note who
arrived before I departed was Sir Thomas Denman. The Chancellor was engaged with some one at
the moment, and nothing passed betwixt them but an exchange of bows. It was nearly ten years
since I had seen Brougham and Denman together; the Queen's trial was then the all-engrossing
topic of public consideration. Who could then have foretold that these men would have in so
short a space won the confidence of a sovereign, whom they attacked with a degree of virulence
which, even in those days of party violence, was generally condemned? The change in feeling
is creditable alike to all."

Lord Brougham married, in 1816, Mary Anne, relict of John Slade, Esq., of Hill street, Berkeley-square;
by whom he has one daughter. Lady Brougham's maiden name was Eden: she is nearly related to
the Auckland and Handley families. At her marriage with Mr. Slade, in 1808, she was accounted
an extremely beautiful young woman; and she was still possessed of great personal charms at
the period of her second union. Lady Brougham had by her former marriage a son, who inherits
his father's estate, and is an. officer in the army, and a daughter. Lady Brougham brought
no property to her husband but her jointure of £1,500 a-year, and the house No. 5, Hill-street.

Lord Brougham was born in 1779, and is, consequently, in his fifty-second year.

[Footnote 1: We are aware of having already quoted these particulars, from the Spectator newspaper,
at page 412 of the Mirror, vol. xvi. but their repetition here is essential to the completeness
of the present Memoir. Of Lord Brougham's family, in connexion with Brougham Castle, in Westmoreland,
there were many conflicting statements at the period of his lordship's elevation to the peerage
towards the close of last year. The Chancellor is said to have had a latent claim as heir-general
to the Barony of Vaux, (whose arms are to be seen on the tower of Brougham Castle,) and hence
his creation by that title. Some exclusive information, obligingly furnished, (at the Chancellor's
request, in reply to our application) by a relative of his lordship, will also be found at
length in the Mirror, vol. xvi. but for the reader's convenience we quote its substance: "Before
the time of the Norman Conquest, the manor and lordship of Brougham (then called Burgham) were
held by the Saxon family of de Burgham, from whom the Lord Chancellor is lineally descended.
After the Conquest, William the Norman granted to Robert de Veteripont, or Vipont, extensive
rights and territories in Westmoreland; and among others, some oppressive rights of seigniory
over the manor of Brougham, then held by Walter de Burgham. To relieve the estate of such services,
Gilbert de Burgham, in the reign of King John, agreed to give up absolutely one-third part
of his estate to Robert de Veteripont, and also the advowson of the rectory of Brougham. This
third comprises the land upon which the castle is built, and the estate afterwards given by
Anne Countess of Pembroke, (heiress of Veteripont,) to the Hospital of Poor Widows at Appleby.
Brougham Castle, if not built, was much extended by Veteripont; and afterwards still more enlarged
by Roger Clifford, who succeeded, by marriage, to the Veteripont possessions. The manor house,
about three quarters of a mile from the castle, continued in the Brougham family; and part
of it, especially the gateway, is supposed to be of Saxon architecture: at all events, it is
the earliest Norman. The chapel is also old, except the roof, which was renewed in the year
1659. In the year 1607, Thomas Brougham, then Lord of the Manor of Brougham, died without issue
male, and the estate was sold to one Bird, who was steward of the Clifford family; the heir
male of the Brougham family then residing at Scales Hall, in Cumberland. About 1680, John Brougham
of Scales, re-purchased the estate and manor of Brougham from Bird's grandson and entailed
it on his nephew, from whom it passed by succession to the Lord Chancellor."]

[Footnote 2: The reader will find a concise narrative of the case of Mr. Smith, at page 408,
vol. iii. of the Mirror.]

[Footnote 3: In one day, during his visits to the freeholders, Mr. Brougham spoke eight speeches
to eight meetings, travelled 120 miles, and entered court the next morning, wigged and gowned
as if he had never quitted his chambers.]
