CONVENIENT ABSENCE.

An individual often visited a landscape painter, who had a very beautiful wife, but he always
met with the husband. "Zounds," said he, one day to him, "for a painter of landscapes, you
are very seldom in the country."

TARRAGON.

We recommend our correspondent, Qy? to steep shalots and tarragon in vinegar, to be used as
a sauce with rump-steaks. Or he may chop the shalots and tarragon very fine, and sprinkle them
over the meat. Tarragon sprinkled over mutton chops is a nice relish; and with sauce piquante
flavoured with the above vinegar, makes a dish on "which the gods might dine."

PEREMPTORY CONCLUSION.

An advocate, whose pleading appeared too diffuse for the cause he was defending, had received
an order from the first president to abridge it; but the former, without omitting a word of
his intended address, replied in a firm tone, that all he uttered was essential. The president,
hoping at length to make him silent, said to him, "The court orders you to conclude." "Well,"
replied the advocate, "then I conclude that the court shall hear me."

GROUNDS OF RECOGNITION.

A man went to a restaurateur's (or chop-house) in France, to dine. He perceived another man
in the room and hurried away to tell the master. "If you do not, Sir, order that man, who is
dining alone at the table in the corner, out of your house, a respectable individual will not
be able to sit down in it."--"How is that, Sir?"--"Because that is the executioner of R----."
The host, after some hesitation, at length went and spoke to the stranger, who calmly answered
him: "By whom have I been recognised?"--"By that gentleman," said the landlord, pointing out
the former. "Indeed, he ought to know me, for it is not two years since I whipped and branded him."

SINGULAR MISTAKE.

A courtier was playing at piquet, and was greatly annoyed by a short-sighted man with a long
nose. To get rid of it he took his pocket handkerchief and wiped his troublesome neighbour's
nose. "Ah, sir," said he immediately, "I really beg your pardon, I took it for my own."

BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

During the revolution, a young man was travelling in the Diligence to Lyons with "a brother
and a friend," when they had got about half way the latter's purse became empty; "Brother,"
said he to the young man, "pay for me, and I will return it to you at Lyons." "I cannot."--"Why,
are we not brothers?" "Oh certainly, but our purses are not sisters."
