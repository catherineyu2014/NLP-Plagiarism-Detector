[472]  On the summit of the Alban Mount, on the site of the present convent, stood the temple
of Jupiter Latialis, where the Latin tribes assembled annually, and renewed their league, during
the Feriae Latinae, instituted by Tarquinus Superbus.  It was here, also, that Roman generals,
who were refused the honours of a full triumph, performed the ovation, and sacrificed to Jupiter
Latialis.  Part of the triumphal way by which the mountain was ascended, formed of vast blocks
of lava, is still in good preservation, leading through groves of chestnut trees of vast size
and age.  Spanning them with extended arms--none of the shortest--the operation was repeated
five times in compassing their girth.

[478]  The attentive reader will have marked the gradual growth of the power of the pretorian
guard, who now, and on so many future occasions, ruled the destinies of the empire.

[482]  Naples and other cities on that coast were Greek colonies.

[483]  This arch was erected in memory of the standards (the eagles) lost by Varus, in Germany,
having been recovered by Germanicus under the auspices of Tiberius.  See his Life, c. xlvii.;
and Tacit. Annal. ii. 41. It seems to have stood at the foot of the Capitol, on the side of
the Forum, near the temple of Concord; but there are no remains of it.

[484]  Tacitus informs us that the same application had been made by Tiberius.  Annal. iii.
The prefect of the pretorian guards, high and important as his office had now become, was not
allowed to enter the senate-house, unless he belonged to the equestrian order.

[485]  The procurators had the administration of some of the less important provinces, with
rank and authority inferior to that of the pro- consuls and prefects.  Frequent mention of
these officers is made by Josephus; and Pontius Pilate, who sentenced our Lord to crucifixion,
held that office in Judaea, under Tiberius.

[486]  Pollio and Messala were distinguished orators, who flourished under the Caesars Julius
and Augustus.

[489]  "Ad bestias" had become a new and frequent sentence for malefactors.  It will be recollected,
that it was the most usual form of martyrdom for the primitive Christians.  Polycarp was brought
all the way from Smyrna to be exposed to it in the amphitheatre at Rome.

[490]  This reminds us of the decision of Solomon in the case of the two mothers, who each
claimed a child as their own, 1 Kings iii. 22-27.

[491]  A most absurd judicial conclusion, the business of the judge or court being to decide,
on weighing the evidence, on which side the truth preponderated.

[492]  See the note in CALIGULA, c. xix., as to Suetonius's sources of information from persons
cotemporary with the occurrences he relates.

[493]  The insult was conveyed in Greek, which seems, from Suetonius, to have been in very
common use at Rome: kai su geron ei, kai moros.

[494]  A.U.C. 798, or 800.

[495]  There was a proverb to the same effect: "Si non caste, saltem caute."

[496]  Ptolemy appointed him to an office which led him to assume a foreign dress.  Rabirius
was defended by Cicero in one of his orations, which is extant.

[497]  The Sigillaria was a street in Rome, where a fair was held after the Saturnalia, which
lasted seven days; and toys, consisting of little images and dolls, which gave their name to
the street and festival, were sold. It appears from the text, that other articles were exposed
for sale in this street.  Among these were included elegant vases of silver and bronze.  There
appears also to have been a bookseller's shop, for an ancient writer tells us that a friend
of his showed him a copy of the Second Book of the Aeneid, which he had purchased there.

[498]  Opposed to this statement there is a passage in Servius Georgius, iii. 37, asserting
that he had heard (accipimus) that Augustus, besides his victories in the east, triumphed over
the Britons in the west; and Horace says:--

    Augustus adjectis Britannis
    Imperio gravibusque Persis.--Ode iii. 5, 1.

Strabo likewise informs us, that in his time, the petty British kings sent embassies to cultivate
the alliance of Augustus, and make offerings in the Capitol: and that nearly the whole island
was on terms of amity with the Romans, and, as well as the Gauls, paid a light tribute.-- Strabo,
B. iv. p. 138.

That Augustus contemplated a descent on the island, but was prevented from attempting it by
his being recalled from Gaul by the disturbances in Dalmatia, is very probable.  Horace offers
his vows for its success:

    Serves iturum, Caesarem in ultimos Orbis Britannos.--Ode i. 35.

But the word iturus shews that the scheme was only projected, and the lines previously quoted
are mere poetical flattery.  Strabo's statement of the communications kept up with the petty
kings of Britain, who were perhaps divided by intestine wars, are, to a certain extent, probably
correct, as such a policy would be a prelude to the intended expedition.

[499]  Circius.  Aulus Gellius, Seneca, and Pliny, mention under this name the strong southerly
gales which prevail in the gulf of Genoa and the neighbouring seas.

[500]  The Stoechades were the islands now called Hieres, off Toulon.

[501]  Claudius must have expended more time in his march from Marseilles to Gessoriacum, as
Boulogne was then called, than in his vaunted conquest of Britain.

[502]  In point of fact, he was only sixteen days in the island, receiving the submission of
some tribes in the south-eastern districts. But the way had been prepared for him by his able
general, Aulus Plautius, who defeated Cunobeline, and made himself master of his capital, Camulodunum,
or Colchester.  These successes were followed up by Ostorius, who conquered Caractacus and
sent him to Rome.

It is singular that Suetonius has supplied us with no particulars of these events.  Some account
of them is given in the disquisition appended to this life of CLAUDIUS.

The expedition of Plautius took place A.U.C. 796., A.D. 44.

[503]  Carpentum: see note in CALIGULA, c. xv.

[504]  The Aemiliana, so called because it contained the monuments of the family of that name,
was a suburb of Rome, on the Via Lata, outside the gate.

[505]  The Diribitorium was a house in the Flaminian Circus, begun by Agrippa, and finished
by Augustus, in which soldiers were mustered and their pay distributed; from whence it derived
its name.  When the Romans went to give their votes at the election of magistrates, they were
conducted by officers named Diribitores.  It is possible that one and the same building may
have been used for both purposes.

The Flaminian Circus was without the city walls, in the Campus Martius. The Roman college now
stands on its site.

[506]  A law brought in by the consuls Papius Mutilus and Quintus Poppaeus; respecting which,
see AUGUSTUS, c. xxxiv.

[507]  The Fucine Lake is now called Lago di Celano, in the Farther Abruzzi.  It is very extensive,
but shallow, so that the difficulty of constructing the Claudian emissary, can scarcely be
compared to that encountered in a similar work for lowering the level of the waters in the
Alban lake, completed A.U.C. 359.
