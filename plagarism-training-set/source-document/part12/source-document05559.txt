EX-SLAVE STORIES

(Texas)

420241

     WILL ADAMS was born in 1857, a slave of Dave Cavin, in Harrison
     Co., Texas. He remained with the Cavins until 1885, then farmed for
     himself. Will lives alone in Marshall, Texas, supported by a $13.00
     monthly pension.

"My folks allus belongs to the Cavins and wore their name till after 'mancipation. Pa and ma
was named Freeman and Amelia Cavin and Massa Dave fotches them to Texas from Alabama, along
with ma's mother, what we called Maria.

"The Cavins allus thunk lots of their niggers and Grandma Maria say, 'Why shouldn't they--it
was their money.' She say there was plenty Indians here when they settled this country and
they bought and traded with them without killin' them, if they could. The Indians was poor
folks, jus' pilfer and loaf 'round all the time. The niggers was a heap sight better off than
they was, 'cause we had plenty to eat and a place to stay.

"Young Massa Tom was my special massa and he still lives here. Old Man Dave seemed to think
more of his niggers than anybody and we thunk lots of our white folks. My pa was leader on
the farm, and there wasn't no overseer or driver. When pa whip a nigger he needn't go to Massa
Dave, but pa say, 'Go you way, you nigger. Freeman didn't whip you for nothin'.' Massa Dave
allus believe pa, 'cause he tells the truth.

"One time a peddler come to our house and after supper he goes to see 'bout his pony. Pa done
feed that pony fifteen ears of corn. The peddler tell massa his pony ain't been fed nothin',
and massa git mad and say, 'Be on you way iffen you gwine 'cuse my niggers of lyin'.'

"We had good quarters and plenty to eat. I 'members when I's jus' walkin' round good pa come
in from the field at night and taken me out of bed and dress me and feed me and then play with
me for hours. Him bein' leader, he's gone from 'fore day till after night. The old heads got
out early but us young scraps slep' till eight or nine o'clock, and don't you think Massa Dave
ain't comin' round to see we is fed. I 'members him like it was yest'day, comin' to the quarters
with his stick and askin' us, 'Had your breakfas'?' We'd say, 'Yes, suh.' Then he'd ask if
we had 'nough or wanted any more. It look like he taken a pleasure in seein' us eat. At dinner,
when the field hands come in, it am the same way. He was sho' that potlicker was fill as long
as the niggers want to eat.

"The hands worked from sun to sun. Massa give them li'l crops and let them work them on Saturday.
Then he bought the stuff and the niggers go to Jefferson and buy clothes and sech like. Lots
saved money and bought freedom 'fore the war was over.

"We went to church and first the white preacher preached and then he larns our cullud preachers.
I seed him ordain a cullud preacher and he told him to allus be honest. When the white preacher
laid his hand on him, all the niggers git to hollerin' and shoutin' and prayin' and that nigger
git scart mos' to death.

"On Christmas we had all we could eat and drink and after that a big party, and you ought to
see them gals swingin' they partners round. Then massa have two niggers wrestle, and our sports
and dances was big sport for the white folks. They'd sit on the gallery and watch the niggers
put it on brown.

"Massa didn't like his niggers to marry off the place, but sometimes they'd do it, and massa
tell his neighbor, 'My nigger am comin' to you place. Make him behave.' All the niggers 'haved
then and they wasn't no Huntsville and gallows and burnin's then.

"Old massa went to war with his boy, Billie. They's lots of cryin' and weepin' when they sot
us free. Lots of them didn't want to be free, 'cause they knowed nothin' and had nowhere to
go. Them what had good massas stayed right on.

"I 'members when that Ku Klux business starts up. Smart niggers causes that. The carpet-baggers
ruint the niggers and the white men couldn't do a thing with them, so they got up the Ku Klux
and stirs up the world. Them carpet-baggers come round larnin' niggers to sass the white folks
what done fed them. They come to pa with that talk and he told them, 'Listen, white folks,
you is gwine start a graveyard if you come round here teachin' niggers to sass white folks."
Them carpet-baggers starts all the trouble at 'lections in Reconstruction. Niggers didn't know
anythin' 'bout politics.

"Mos' the young niggers ain't usin' the education they got now. I's been here eighty years
and still has to be showed and told by white folks. These young niggers won't git told by whites
or blacks either. They thinks they done knowed it all and that gits them in trouble.

"I stays with the Cavins mos' twenty years after the war. After I leaves, I allus farms and
does odd jobs round town here. I's father of ten chillen by one woman. I lives by myself now
and they gives me $13.00 a month. I'd be proud to git it if it wasn't more'n a dollar, 'cause
they ain't nothin' a old man can do no more.

     WILLIAM ADAMS, 93, was born in slavery, with no opportunity for an
     education, except three months in a public school. He has taught
     himself to read and to write. His lifelong ambition has been to
     become master of the supernatural powers which he believes to
     exist. He is now well-known among Southwestern Negroes for his
     faith in the occult.

"Yous want to know and talk about de power de people tells you I has. Well, sit down here,
right there in dat chair, befo' we'uns starts. I gits some ice water and den we'uns can discuss
de subject. I wants to 'splain it clearly, so yous can understand.

"I's born a slave, 93 years ago, so of course I 'members de war period. Like all de other slaves
I has no chance for edumacation. Three months am de total time I's spent going to school. I
teached myself to read and write. I's anxious to larn to read so I could study and find out
about many things. Dat, I has done.

"There am lots of folks, and edumacated ones, too, what says we'uns believes in superstition.
Well, its 'cause dey don't understand. 'Member de Lawd, in some of His ways, can be mysterious.
De Bible says so. There am some things de Lawd wants all folks to know, some things jus' de
chosen few to know, and some things no one should know. Now, jus' 'cause yous don't know 'bout
some of de Lawd's laws, 'taint superstition if some other person understands and believes in sich.

"There is some born to sing, some born to preach, and some born to know de signs. There is
some born under de power of de devil and have de power to put injury and misery on people,
and some born under de power of de Lawd for to do good and overcome de evil power. Now, dat
produces two forces, like fire and water. De evil forces starts de fire and I has de water
force to put de fire out.

"How I larnt sich? Well, I's done larn it. It come to me. When de Lawd gives sich power to
a person, it jus' comes to 'em. It am 40 years ago now when I's fust fully realize' dat I has
de power. However, I's allus int'rested in de workin's of de signs. When I's a little piccaninny,
my mammy and other folks used to talk about de signs. I hears dem talk about what happens to
folks 'cause a spell was put on 'em. De old folks in dem days knows more about de signs dat
de Lawd uses to reveal His laws den de folks of today. It am also true of de cullud folks in
Africa, dey native land. Some of de folks laughs at their beliefs and says it am superstition,
but it am knowin' how de Lawd reveals His laws.

"Now, let me tell yous of something I's seen. What am seen, can't be doubted. It happens when
I's a young man and befo' I's realize' dat I's one dat am chosen for to show de power. A mule
had cut his leg so bad dat him am bleedin' to death and dey couldn't stop it. An old cullud
man live near there dat dey turns to. He comes over and passes his hand over de cut. Befo'
long de bleedin' stop and dat's de power of de Lawd workin' through dat nigger, dat's all it am.

"I knows about a woman dat had lost her mind. De doctor say it was caused from a tumor in de
head. Dey took an ex-ray picture, but dere's no tumor. Dey gives up and says its a peculiar
case. Dat woman was took to one with de power of de good spirit and he say its a peculiar case
for dem dat don't understand. Dis am a case of de evil spell. Two days after, de woman have
her mind back.

"Dey's lots of dose kind of cases de ord'nary person never hear about. Yous hear of de case
de doctors can't understand, nor will dey 'spond to treatment. Dat am 'cause of de evil spell
dat am on de persons.

"'Bout special persons bein' chosen for to show de power, read yous Bible. It says in de book
of Mark, third chapter, 'and He ordained twelve, dat dey should be with Him, dat He might send
them forth to preach and to have de power to heal de sick and to cast out devils.' If it wasn't
no evil in people, why does de Lawd say, 'cast out sich?' And in de fifth chapter of James,
it further say, 'If any am sick, let him call de elders. Let dem pray over him. De prayers
of faith shall save him.' There 'tis again, Faith, dat am what counts.

"When I tells dat I seen many persons given up to die, and den a man with de power comes and
saves sich person, den its not for people to say it am superstition to believe in de power.
