In the summer of this year, a parcel of horses were taken from the West Fork, and the Indians
who had stolen them, being discovered as they were retiring, they were pursued by Captain Coburn,
who was stationed at the mouth of Little [304] Kenhawa with a party of men as scouts. Following
them across the Ohio river, he overtook them some distance in the Indian country, and retaking
the horses, returned to his station. Hitherto property recovered from the savages, had been
invariably restored to those from whom it had been stolen; but on the present occasion a different
course was pursued. Contending that they received compensation for services rendered by them
in Virginia, and were not bound to treat without its limits in pursuit of the savages or to
retake the property of which they had divested its rightful owners, they claimed the horses
as plunder taken from the Indians, sold them, and divided the proceeds of sale among themselves--much
to the dissatisfaction of those from whom the savages had taken them.[2]

In the course of the ensuing fall, Henry Neal, William Triplett and Daniel Rowell, from Neal's
station ascended the Little Kenhawa in canoes to the mouth of the Burning Spring run, from
whence they proceeded on a Buffoloe hunt in the adjoining woods. But they had been seen as
they plied their canoes up the river, by a party of Indians, who no sooner saw them placed
in a situation favoring the bloody purposes of their hearts, than they fired upon them. Neal
and Triplett were killed, and fell into the river.--Rowell was missed and escaped by swimming
the Kenhawa, the Indians shooting at him as he swam. In a few days after the dead were found
in a ripple and buried. The Indians had not been able to draw them from their watery grave,
and obtain their scalps.

During this year unsuccessful attempts were made by the general government, to terminate Indian
hostilities by negotiation. They were too much elated with their recent success, to think of
burying their resentments in a treaty of peace; and so little did they fear the operation of
the governmental forces, and such was their confidence in their own strength, that they not
only refused to negotiate at all, but put to death two of those who were sent to them as messengers
of peace. Major Truman and Col. Hardin, severally sent upon this mission, were murdered by
them; and when commissioners to treat with them, were received by them, their only answer was,
a positive refusal to enter into a treaty.[3]

When this determination was made known to the President, every precaution which could be used,
was taken by him to prevent the recurrence of these enormities which were daily committed on
the [305] frontier, and particularly in the new state of Kentucky. Gen. St. Clair, after having
asked that a court of enquiry should be held, to consider of his conduct in the campaign of
1791, and finding that his request could not be granted, resigned the command of the army,
and was succeeded by Gen. Anthony Wayne. That the operations of the army might not be defeated
as heretofore, by a too great reliance on undisciplined militia, it was recommended to Congress
to authorize the raising of three additional regiments of regular soldiers; and the bill for
complying with this recommendation, notwithstanding it was strenuously opposed by a strong
party hostile to the then administration, was finally passed.[4]

The forts Hamilton and Jefferson, erected by Gen. St. Clair, continued to be well garrisoned;
but there was some difficulty in supplying them with provisions--the Indians being always in
readiness to intercept them on their way. As early as April 1792, they taught us the necessity
of having a strong guard to escort supplies with safety, by a successful attack on Major Adair;
who with one hundred and twenty volunteers from Kentucky, had charge of a number of pack horses
laden with provisions. He was engaged by a body of savages, not much superior in number, and
although he was under cover of Fort St. Clair, yet did they drive him into the fort, and carry
off the provisions and pack horses. The courage and bold daring of the Indians, was eminently
conspicuous on this occasion. They fought with nearly equal numbers, against a body of troops,
better tutored in the science of open warfare, well mounted and equipped, armed with every
necessary weapon, and almost under the guns of the fort. And they fought successfully,--killing
one captain and ten privates, wounding several, and taking property estimated to be worth fifteen
thousand dollars. Nothing seemed to abate their ardor for war. Neither the strong garrisons
placed in the forts erected so far in advance of the settlements, nor the great preparations
which were making for striking an effectual blow at them, caused them for an instant to slacken
in hostilities, or check their movements against the frontier.

In the spring of 1793, a party of warriors proceeding towards the head waters of the Monongahela
river, discovered a marked way, leading a direction which they did not know to be inhabited
by whites. It led to a settlement which had been recently made on Elk river, by Jeremiah and
Benjamin Carpenter and a few others from Bath county, and who had been particularly careful
to make nor leave any path which might lead to a discovery of their situation, but Adam O'Brien
moving into the same section of country in the spring of 1792, and being rather an indifferent
woodsman, incautiously blazed the trees in several directions so as to enable him readily to
find his home, when business or pleasure should have drawn him from it. It was upon one of
these marked traces that the Indians chanced to fall; and pursuing it, came to the deserted
cabin of [306] O'Brien: he having returned to the interior, because of his not making a sufficiency
of grain for the subsistence of his family. Proceeding from O'Brien's, they came to the House
of Benjamin Carpenter, whom they found alone and killed. Mrs. Carpenter being discovered by
them, before she was aware of their presence, was tomahawked and scalped, a small distance
from the yard.

The burning of Benjamin Carpenter's house, led to a discovery of these outrages; and the remaining
inhabitants of that neighborhood, remote from any fort or populous settlement to which they
could fly for security, retired to the mountains and remained for several days concealed in
a cave. They then caught their horses and moved their families to the West Fork; and when they
visited the places of their former habitancy for the purpose of collecting their stock and
carrying it off with their other property, scarce a vestige of them was to be seen,--the Indians
had been there after they left the cave, and burned the houses, pillaged their movable property,
and destroyed the cattle and hogs.

Among the few interesting incidents which occurred in the upper country, during this year,
was the captivity and remarkable escape of two brothers, John and Henry Johnson:--the former
thirteen, the latter eleven years of age. They lived at a station on the west side of the Ohio
river near above Indian Short creek; and being at some distance from the house, engaged in
the sportive amusements of youth, became fatigued and seated themselves on an old log for the
purpose of resting. They presently observed two men coming towards them, whom they believed
to be white men from the station until they approached so close as to leave no prospect of
escape by flight, when to their great grief they saw that two Indians were beside them. They
were made prisoners, and taken about four miles, when after partaking of some roasted meat
and parched corn given them by their captors, they were arranged for the night, by being placed
between the two Indians and each encircled in the arms of the one next him.

Henry, the younger of the brothers, had grieved much at the idea of being carried off by the
Indians, and during his short but sorrowful journey across the hills, had wept immoderately.
John had in vain endeavored to comfort him with the hope that they should be enabled to elude
the vigilence of the savages, and to return to the hearth of their parents and brethren. He
refused to be comforted.--The ugly red man, with his tomahawk and scalping knife, which had
been often called in to quiet the cries of his infancy, was now actually before him; and every
scene of torture and of torment which had been depicted, by narration, to his youthful eye,
was now present to his terrified imagination, hightened by the thought that they were about
to be re-enacted on himself.

It was different with John. He felt the reality of their situation.--He was alive to the anguish
which he knew would agitate the bosom of his mother, and he thought over the means of allaying
it so intensely, that sleep was banished from his eyes. Finding the others all locked in deep
repose, he disengaged himself from the embrace of the savage at his side, and walked to the
fire. To test the soundness of their sleep, he rekindled the dying blaze, and moved freely
about it. All remained still and motionless,--no suppressed breathing, betrayed a feigned repose.
He gently twitched the sleeping Henry, and whispering softly in his ear, bade him get up. Henry
obeyed, and they both stood by the fire. "I think, said John, we had better go home now." "Oh!
replied Henry, they will follow and catch us again." "Never fear that, rejoined John, we'll
kill them before we go." The idea was for some time opposed by Henry; but when he beheld the
savages so soundly asleep, and listened to his brother's plan of executing his wish, he finally
consented to act the part prescribed him.

The only gun which the Indians had, was resting against a tree, at the foot of which lay their
tomahawks. John placed it on a log, with the muzzle near to the head of one of the savages;
cocked it, and leaving Henry with his finger to the trigger, ready to pull upon the signal
being given, he repaired to his own station. Holding in his hand one of their tomahawks, he
stood astride of the other Indian, and as he raised his arm to deal death to the sleeping savage,
Henry fired, and shooting off the lower part of the Indian's jaw, called to his brother, "lay
on, for I've done for this one," seized up the gun and ran off. The first blow of the tomahawk
took effect on the back of the neck, and was not fatal. The Indian attempted to spring up;
but John repeated his strokes with such force and so quickly, that he soon brought him again
to the ground; and leaving him dead proceeded on after his brother.

They presently came to a path which they recollected to have travelled, the preceding evening,
and keeping along it, arrived at the station awhile before day. The inhabitants were however,
all up and in much uneasiness for the fate of the boys; and when they came near and heard a
well known voice exclaim in accents of deep distress, "Poor little fellows, they are killed
or taken prisoners," John replied aloud,--"No mother, we are here again."

When the tale of their captivity, and the means by which their deliverance was effected, were
told, they did not obtain full credence. [308] Piqued at the doubts expressed by some, John
observed, "you had better go and see." "But, can you again find the spot," said one. "Yes,
replied he, I hung my hat up at the turning out place and can soon shew you the spot." Accompanied
by several of the men, John returned to the theatre of his daring exploits; and the truth of
his statement received ample confirmation. The savage who had been tomahawked was lying dead
by the fire--the other had crawled some distance; but was tracked by his blood until found,
when it was agreed to leave him, "as he must die at any rate."

Companies of rangers had been for several seasons stationed on the Ohio river, for the greater
security of the persons and property of those who resided on and near the frontier. During
this year a company which had been stationed at the mouth of Fishing creek,[5] and had remained
there until its term of service had expired, determined then on a scout into the Indian country;
and crossing the river, marched on for some days before they saw any thing which indicated
their nearness to Indians. Pursuing a path which seemed to be much used, they came in view
of an Indian camp, and observing another path, which likewise seemed to be much frequented,
Ensign Levi Morgan was sent with a detachment of the men, to see if it would conduct them to
where were others of the Indians, who soon returned with the information that he had seen another
of their encampments close by. Upon the receipt of this intelligence, the Lieutenant was sent
forward with a party of men to attack the second encampment, while the Captain with the residue
of the company should proceed against that which had been first discovered, and commence an
assault on it, when he should hear the firing of the Lieutenant's party at the camp which he
was sent to assail.

When the second camp was approached and the men posted at intervals around it, awaiting the
light of day to begin the assault, the Lieutenant discovered that there was a greater force
of Indians with whom he would have to contend than was expected, and prudently resolved to
withdraw his men without coming into collision with them. Orders for this movement were directly
given, and the party immediately retired. There was however, one of the detachment, who had
been posted some small distance in advance of the others with directions to fire as soon as
the Indians should be seen stirring, and who, unapprized of the withdrawal of the others, [309]
maintained his station, until he observed a squaw issuing from a camp, when he fired at her
and rushed up, expecting to be supported by his comrades. He fell into the hands of those whom
he had thus assailed; but his fate was far different from what he had every reason to suppose
it would be, under those circumstances. It was the hunting camp of Isaac Zane, and the female
at whom he had shot was the daughter of Zane; the ball had slightly wounded her in the wrist.
Her father, although he had been with the Indians ever since his captivity when only nine years
of age, had not yet acquired the ferocious and vindictive passions of those with whom he had
associated; but practising the forbearance and forgiveness of christian and civilized man,
generously conducted the wanton assailant so far upon his way, that he was enabled though alone
to reach the settlement in safety. His fate was different from that of those, who had been
taken prisoners by that part of the company which remained at the first camp with the Captain.
When the Lieutenant with the detachment, rejoined the others, disappointment at the failure
of the expedition under him, led some of the men to fall upon the Indian prisoners and inhumanly
murder them.

Notwithstanding that preparations for an active campaign against the savages was fast ripening
to their perfection, and that the troops of the general government had penetrated as far as
to the field, on which had been fought the fatal battle of the fourth of November, 1791, and
erected there Fort Recovery,[6] yet did they not cease from their accustomed inroads upon the
settlements, even after the winter of 1793.--In March 1794, a party of them crossed the Ohio
river, and as they were advancing towards the settlements on the upper branches of the Monongahela,
met with Joseph Cox, then on his way to the mouth of Leading creek on Little Kenhawa, for a
load of furs and skins which he had left there, at the close of his hunt the preceding fall.
Cox very unexpectedly met them in a narrow pass, and instantly wheeled his horse to ride off.
Endeavoring to stimulate the horse to greater speed by the application of the whip, the animal
became stubborn and refused to go at all, when Cox was forced to dismount and seek safety on
foot. His pursuers gained rapidly upon him, and he saw that one of them would soon overtake
him. He faced the savage who was near, and raised his gun to fire; but nothing daunted, the
Indian rushed forward. Cox's gun [310] missed fire, and he was instantly a prisoner. He was
taken to their towns and detained in captivity for some time; but at length made his escape,
and returned safely to the settlement.

On the 24th of July, six Indians visited the West Fork river, and at the mouth of Freeman's
creek, met with, and made prisoner, a daughter of John Runyan. She was taken off by two of
the party of savages, but did not go more than ten or twelve miles, before she was put to death.
The four Indians who remained, proceeded down the river and on the next day came to the house
of William Carder, near below the mouth of Hacker's creek. Mr. Carder discovered them approaching,
in time to fasten his door; but in the confusion of the minute, shut out two of his children,
who however ran off unperceived by the savages and arrived in safety at the house of a neighbor.
He then commenced firing and hallooing, so as to alarm those who were near and intimidate the
Indians. Both objects were accomplished. The Indians contented themselves with shooting at
the cattle, and then retreated; and Mr. Joseph Chevront, who lived hardby, hearing the report
of the guns and the loud cries of Carder, sent his own family to a place of safety, and with
nobleness of purpose, ran to the relief of his neighbor. He enabled Carder to remove his family
to a place of greater security, although the enemy were yet near, and engaged in skinning one
of the cattle that they might take with them a supply of meat. On the next day a company of
men assembled, and went in pursuit; but they could not trail the savages far, because of the
great caution with which they had retreated, and returned without accomplishing any thing.

Two days afterward, when it was believed that the Indians had left the neighborhood, they came
on Hacker's creek near to the farm of Jacob Cozad, and finding four of his sons bathing, took
three of them prisoners, and killed the fourth, by repeatedly stabbing him with a bayonet attached
to a staff. The boys, of whom they made prisoners, were immediately taken to the Indian towns
and kept in captivity until the treaty of Greenville in 1795. Two of them were then delivered
up to their father, who attended to enquire for them,--the third was not heard of for some
time after, but was at length found at Sandusky, by his elder brother and brought home.

After the victory obtained by General Wayne over the Indians, [311] Jacob Cozad, Jr. was doomed
to be burned to death, in revenge of the loss then sustained by the savages. Every preparation
for carrying into execution this dreadful determination was quickly made. The wood was piled,
the intended victim was apprized of his approaching fate, and before the flaming torch was
applied to the faggots, he was told to take leave of those who were assembled to witness the
awful spectacle. The crowd was great, and the unhappy youth could with difficulty press his
way through them. Amid the jeers and taunts of those whom he would address, he was proceeding
to discharge the last sad act of his life, when a female, whose countenance beamed with benignity,
beckoned him to follow her. He did not hesitate. He approached as if to bid her farewell, and
she succeeded in taking him off unobserved by the many eyes gazing around, and concealed him
in a wigwam among some trunks and covered loosely with a blanket. He was presently missed,
and a search immediately made for him. Many passed near in quest of the devoted victim, and
he could hear their steps and note their disappointment. After awhile the uproar ceased, and
he felt more confident of security. In a few minutes more he heard approaching footsteps and
felt that the blanket was removed from him. He turned to surrender himself to his pursuers,
and meet a dreadful death.--But no! they were two of his master's sons who had been directed
where to find him, and they conducted him securely to the Old Delaware town, where he remained
until carried to camp upon the conclusion of a treaty of peace.[7]

In a short time after the happening of the events at Cozad's, a party of Indians made an irruption
upon Tygart's Valley. For some time the inhabitants of that settlement had enjoyed a most fortunate
exemption from savage molestation; and although they had somewhat relaxed in vigilance, they
did not however omit to pursue a course calculated to ensure a continuance of their tranquillity
and repose. Instead of flying for security, as they had formerly, to the neighboring forts
upon the return of spring, the increase of population and the increased capacity of the communion
to repel aggression, caused them to neglect other acts of precaution, and only to assemble
at particular houses, when danger was believed to be instant and at hand. In consequence of
the reports which reached them of the injuries lately committed by the [312] savages upon the
West Fork, several families collected at the house of Mr. Joseph Canaan for mutual security,
and while thus assembled, were visited by a party of Indians, when perfectly unprepared for
resistance. The savages entered the house awhile after dark, and approaching the bed on which
Mr. Canaan was lolling, one of them addressed him with the familiarity of an old acquaintance
and saying "how d'ye do, how d'ye do," presented his hand. Mr. Canaan was rising to reciprocate
the greeting, when he was pierced by a ball discharged at him from another savage, and fell
dead. The report of the gun at once told, who were the visitors, and put them upon using immediate
exertions to effect their safety by flight. A young man who was near when Canaan was shot,
aimed at the murderer a blow with a drawing knife, which took effect on the head of the savage
and brought him to the ground. Ralston then escaped through the door, and fled in safety, although
fired at as he fled.

When the Indians entered the house, there was a Mrs. Ward sitting in the room. So soon as she
observed that the intruders were savages, she passed into another apartment with two of the
children, and going out with them through a window, got safely away. Mr. Lewis (brother to
Mrs. Canaan) likewise escaped from a back room, in which he had been asleep at the firing of
the gun. Three children were tomahawked and scalped,--Mrs. Canaan made prisoner, and the savages
withdrew. The severe wound inflicted on the head of the Indian by Ralston, made it necessary
that they should delay their return to their towns, until his recovery; and they accordingly
remained near the head of the middle fork of Buchannon, for several weeks. Their extreme caution
in travelling, rendered any attempt to discover them unavailing; and when their companion was
restored they proceeded on, uninterruptedly. On the close of the war, Mrs. Canaan was redeemed
from captivity by a brother from Brunswick, in New Jersey, and restored to her surviving friends.

Thus far in the year 1794, the army of the United States had not been organised for efficient
operations. Gen. Wayne had been actively employed in the discharge of every preparatory duty
devolving on him; and those distinguishing characteristics of uncommon daring and bravery,
which had acquired for him the appellation of "Mad Anthony," and which [313] so eminently fitted
him for the command of an army warring against savages, gave promise of success to his arms.
Lieut. Marks had got off by knocking down the Indian who held him prisoner; and Lieut. Michael
had lost all of his party, but three men. The entire loss of the Americans was twenty-three
killed, and forty wounded.[9] The riflemen brought in ten scalps which were taken early in
the action; beyond this the enemy's loss was never ascertained. Many of them were no doubt
killed and wounded, as they advanced in solid columns up to the very muzzles of the guns, and
were afterwards seen carrying off many of their warriors on pack horses.

At length Gen. Wayne put the army over which he had been given the command, in motion;[10]
and upon its arrival at the confluence of the Au Glaize and the Miami of the Lakes, another
effort was made for the attainment of peace, without the effusion of blood. Commissioners were
sent forward to the Indians to effect this desirable object; who exhorted them to listen to
their propositions for terminating the war, and no longer to be deluded by the counsels of
white emissaries, who had not the power to afford them protection; but only sought to involve
the frontier of the United States in a war, from which much evil, but no good could possibly
result to either party. The savages however felt confident that success would again attend
their arms, and deriving additional incentives to war from their proximity to the British fort,
recently erected at the foot of the rapids, declined the overture for peace, and seemed ardently
to desire the battle, which they knew must soon be fought.

The Indian army at this time, amounted to about two thousand warriors, and when reconnoitered
on the 19th of August were found encamped in a thick bushy wood and near to the British Fort.
The army of Gen. Wayne was equal in numbers to that of the enemy; and when on the morning of
the 20th, it took up the line of march, the troops were so disposed as to avoid being surprised,
and to come into action on the [315] shortest notice, and under the most favorable circumstances.
A select battalion of mounted volunteers, commanded by Major Price, moving in advance of the
main army, had proceeded but a few miles, when a fire so severe was aimed at it by the savages
concealed, as usual, that it was forced to fall back. The enemy had chosen their ground with
great judgment, taking a position behind the fallen timber,[11] which had been prostrated by
a tornado, and in a woods so thick as to render it impracticable for the cavalry to act with
effect. They were formed into three regular lines, much extended in front, within supporting
distance of each other, and reaching about two miles; and their first effort was to turn the
left flank of the American army. The second line was ordered to the support of the first; and
Capt. Campbell at the head of the cavalry, and Gen. Scott at the head of the mounted volunteers
were sent forward to turn the left and right wings of the enemy.

Gen. Wayne remained three days on the banks of the Miami, in front of the field of battle left
to the full and quiet possession of his army, by the flight and dispersion of the savages.
In this time, all the houses and cornfields, both above and below the British Fort, and among
the rest, the houses and stores of Col. McKee,[12] an English trader of great influence among
the Indians and which had been invariably exerted to prolong the war, were consumed by fire
or otherwise entirely destroyed. On the 27th, the American army returned to its head quarters,
laying waste the cornfields and villages on each side of the river for about fifty miles; and
[316] this too in the most populous and best improved part of the Indian country.

The loss sustained by the American army, in obtaining this brilliant victory, over a savage
enemy flushed with former successes, amounted to thirty-three killed and one hundred wounded:[13]
that of the enemy was never ascertained. In his official account of the action, Gen. Wayne
says, "The woods were strewed for a considerable distance, with the dead bodies of the Indians
and their white auxiliaries;" and at a council held a few days after, when British agents endeavored
to prevail on them to risk another engagement, they expressed a determination to "bury the
bloody hatchet" saying, that they had just lost more than two hundred of their warriors.

Some events occurred during this engagement, which are deemed worthy of being recorded here,
although not of general interest. While Capt. Campbell was engaged in turning the left-flank,
of the enemy, three of them plunged into the river, and endeavored to escape the fury of the
conflict, by swimming to the opposite shore. They were seen by two negroes, who were on the
bank to which the Indians were aiming, and who concealed themselves behind a log for the purpose
of intercepting them. When within shooting distance one of the negroes fired and killed one
of the Indians. The other two took hold of him to drag him to shore, when one of them was killed,
by the fire of the other negro. The remaining Indian, being now in shoal water, endeavored
to draw both the dead to the bank; but before he could effect this, the negro who had first
fired, had reloaded, and again discharging his gun, killed him also, and the three floated
down the river.

Another circumstance is related, which shows the obstinacy with which the contest was maintained
by individuals in both armies. A soldier and an Indian came in collision, the one having an
unloaded gun,--the other a tomahawk.

Notwithstanding the signal victory, obtained by General Wayne over the Indians, yet did their
hostility to the whites lead them to acts of occasional violence, and kept them for some time
from acceding to the proposals for peace. In [317] consequence of this, their whole country
was laid waste, and forts erected in the hearts of their settlements at once to starve and
awe them into quiet. The desired effect was produced. Their crops being laid waste, their villages
burned, fortresses erected in various parts of their country and kept well garrisoned, and
a victorious army ready to bear down upon them at any instant, there was no alternative left
them but to sue for peace. When the Shawanees made known their wish to bury the bloody hatchet,
Gen. Wayne refused to treat singly with them, and declared that all the different tribes of
the North Western Indians should be parties to any treaty which he should make. This required
some time as they had been much dispersed after the defeat of the 20th of August, and the great
devastation committed on their crops and provisions by the American army, had driven many to
the woods, to procure a precarious subsistence by hunting. Still however, to such abject want
and wretchedness were they reduced, that exertions were immediately made to collect them in
general council; and as this was the work of some time, it was not effected until midsummer
of 1795.

In this interval of time, there was but a solitary interruption, caused by savage aggression,
to the general repose and quiet of North Western Virginia; and that interruption occurred in
a settlement which had been exempt from invasion since the year 1782. In the summer of 1795,
the trail of a large party of Indians was discovered on Leading creek, and proceeding directly
towards the settlements on the head of the West Fork, those on Buchannon river, or in Tygart's
Valley. In consequence of the uncertainty against which of them, the savages would direct their
operations, intelligence of the discovery which had been made, was sent by express to all;
and measures, to guard against the happening of any unpleasant result, were taken by all, save
the inhabitants on Buchannon. They had so long been exempt from the murderous incursions of
the savages, while other settlements not remote from them, were yearly deluged with blood,
that a false security was engendered, in the issue, fatal to the lives and happiness of some
of them, by causing them to neglect the use of such precautionary means, as would warn them
of the near approach of danger, and ward it when it came.

Pursuing their usual avocations in despite of the warning which had been given them, on the
day after the express had [318] sounded an alarm among them, as John Bozarth, sen. and his
sons George and John were busied in drawing grain from the field to the barn, the agonizing
shrieks of those at the house rent the air around them; and they hastened to ascertain, and
if practicable avert the cause. The elasticity of youth enabled George to approach the house
some few paces in advance of his father, but the practised eye of the old gentleman, first
discovered an Indian, only a small distance from his son, and with his gun raised to fire upon
him. With parental solicitude he exclaimed, "See George, an Indian is going to shoot you."
George was then too near the savage, to think of escaping by flight. He looked at him steadily,
and when he supposed the fatal aim was taken and the finger just pressing on the trigger, he
fell, and the ball whistled by him. Not doubting but that the youth had fallen in death, the
savage passed by him and pressed in pursuit of the father.

Mr. Bozarth had not attained to that age when the sinews become too much relaxed for active
exertion, but was yet springy and agile, and was enabled to keep ahead of his pursuer. Despairing
of overtaking him, by reason of his great speed, the savage hurled a tomahawk at his head.
It passed harmless by; and the old gentleman got safely off.

When George Bozarth fell as the Indian fired, he lay still as if dead, and supposing the scalping
knife would be next applied to his head, determined on seizing the savage by the legs as he
would stoop over him, and endeavor to bring him to the ground; when he hoped to be able to
gain the mastery over him. Seeing him pass on in pursuit of his father, he arose and took to
flight also. On his way he overtook a younger brother, who had become alarmed, and was hobbling
slowly away on a sore foot. George gave him every aid in his power to facilitate his flight,
until he discovered that another of the savages was pressing close upon them. Knowing that
if he remained with his brother, both must inevitably perish, he was reluctantly forced to
leave him to his fate. Proceeding on, he came up with his father, who not doubting but he was
killed when the savage fired at him, broke forth with the exclamation, "Why George, I thought
you were dead," and manifested, even in that sorrowful moment, a joyful feeling at his mistake.

The Indians who were at the house, wrought their work of blood upon such as would have been
impediments to their [319] retreat; and killing two or three smaller children, took Mrs. Bozarth
and two boys prisoners. With these they made their way to their towns and arrived in time to
surrender their captives to Gen. Wayne.

This was the last mischief done by the Indians in North Western Virginia. For twenty years
the inhabitants of that section of the country, had suffered all the horrors of savage warfare,
and all the woes which spring from the uncurbed indulgence of those barbarous and vindicitive
passions, which bear sway in savage breasts. The treaty of Greenville, concluded on the 3d
of August 1795, put a period to the war, and with it, to those acts of devastation and death
which had so long spread dismay and gloom throughout the land.

FINIS.

   [1] Drake, in Aboriginal Races of North America (15th
       ed.), p. 616, cites the Waggoner massacre as "the first exploit
       in which we find Tecumseh engaged." L. V. McWhorter sends me
       this interesting note, giving the local tradition regarding the
       affair: "John Waggoner lived on Jesse's Run, more than two
       miles above its junction with Hacker's Creek. While engaged in
       burning logs in his clearing, he was sitting upon a log, with a
       handspike lying across his lap. It was thought that Tecumseh
       mistook this tool for a gun, and was nervous. But three in
       number, the Indians had entered the district with some
       trepidation. Over Sunday, while the settlers were holding
       religious services in West's Fort, the savages lay in a
       neighboring ravine. The dogs of the settlement barked furiously
       at them, and ran toward their hiding place, trying to lead
       their masters; but the latter supposed that the animals had
       merely scented wolves, hence paid no attention to them.
       Tecumseh was but thirty paces from Waggoner when he fired, and
       it is singular that he missed, for the latter was a large man
       and in fair view. Waggoner sprang up and started for his cabin,
       a short distance only, but when about fifteen yards away saw an
       Indian chasing one of the children around the house. Waggoner
       was unarmed; his gun was in the house, but he feared to enter,
       so ran for help to the cabin of Hardman, a neighbor. But
       Hardman was out hunting, and there was no gun left there. The
       screams of his family were now plainly heard by Waggoner, and
       he was with difficulty restrained from rushing back to help
       them, unarmed. Jesse Hughes carried the news into the fort, and
       a rescue party at once set out. Mrs. Waggoner and her three
       youngest children had been carried across the ridge to where is
       now Rev. Mansfield McWhorter's farm, on McKenley's Run, and
       here they were tomahawked and scalped. Henry McWhorter helped
       to carry the bodies to the fort, but made no mention of their
       being 'mangled in the most barbarous and shocking manner.'"

       The boy Peter, then eight years old, remained with the Indians
       for twenty years. The manner of his return, as related to me by
       Mr. McWhorter, was singular, and furnishes an interesting and
       instructive romance of the border. One Baker, one of John
       Waggoner's neighbors, went to Ohio to "squat," and on Paint
       Creek saw Peter with a band of Indians, recognizing him by the
       strong family resemblance. Baker at once wrote to the elder
       Waggoner, telling him of his discovery, and the latter soon
       visited the Paint Creek band, with a view to inducing his son
       to return home. But Peter was loth to go. He was united to a
       squaw, and by her had two children. In tears, she bitterly
       opposed his going. When finally he yielded to parental appeals,
       he promised her he would soon be back again. When the time for
       his return to the forest came, his relatives kept him under
       guard; when it had passed, he was afraid to return to his
       Indian relatives, having broken his word. Gradually he became
       reconciled in a measure to his new surroundings, but was ever
       melancholy, frequently lamenting that he had left his savage
       family. "Some time after his return to civilization," continues
       McWhorter, "an Indian woman, supposed to be his wife, passed
       through the Hacker Creek settlements, inquiring for Peter, and
       going on toward the East. She appeared to be demented, and sang
       snatches of savage songs. Peter never knew of her presence, nor
       would any one inform her of his whereabouts. He was reticent
       about his life among the Indians, and no details of that
       feature of his career became known to his white friends."

       Tecumseh, who is said to have been born on Hacker's Creek,
       possibly at a village near the mouth of Jesse's Run, visited
       the white settlements there, after the peace, and told the
       whites of his experiences in connection with the Waggoner
       massacre.--R. G. T.

   [2] It must be acknowledged that many of these militia forays
       against the Indians partook of the nature of buccaneering. The
       spoils were often considerable. Clark, in his Kaskaskia campaign
       (1778), captured so much booty, in property and slaves, that he
       declares his men were made "almost rich."--R. G. T.

   [3] In the spring of 1792, Major Trueman, Colonel Hardin,
       and Mr. Freeman were dispatched from Fort Washington by
       different routes, to open peace negotiations, but they were
       murdered by the savages. Gen. Rufus Putnam, aided by
       Hekewelder, the Moravian, succeeded in binding the Wabash and
       Illinois Indians to keep the peace. Later, Benjamin Lincoln,
       Timothy Pickering, and Beverly Randolph were ordered by the
       president to go to the Maumee to conclude a general treaty
       which Indians had declared their willingness to enter into. But
       the commissioners were detained at Niagara by sham conferences
       with Gov. John Graves Simcoe, of Canada, until the middle of
       July, when the Indians sent them word that unless they would in
       advance "agree that the Ohio shall remain the boundary between
       us," the proposed "meeting would be altogether unnecessary."
       The commissioners declined to accept this ultimatum, and
       returned home. Meanwhile, General Wayne was prosecuting
       preparations for an active campaign against the hostiles.--R.
       G. T.

   [4] On a plain near the old French-Indian-English trading
       village, called Logstown (just below the present Economy, Pa.,
       on the north side of the Ohio, 18 miles below Pittsburg),
       Wayne's army lay encamped from November, 1792, to April 30,
       1793. The army was fancifully called the "Legion of the United
       States," and the camp was known as Legionville. From here,
       Wayne proceeded to Cincinnati, and took up his headquarters in
       Fort Washington.--R. G. T.

   [5] Fishing Creek enters the Ohio 128 miles below
       Pittsburgh. At its mouth is now the town of New Martinsville,
       W. Va.--R. G. T.

   [6] This was an expedition made by Gen. James Wilkinson,
       second in command under Wayne, in December, 1793. He marched to
       the field from Fort Washington at the head of a thousand men,
       and left a garrison at the new fort.--R. G. T.

   [7] McWhorter says that the capture of the Cozad boys took
       place at the mouth of Lanson Run, near Berlin, W. Va. The boy
       who was killed was but six years of age; crying for his mother,
       an Indian grasped him by the heels and cracked his head against
       a tree,--a favorite method of murdering white children, among
       Indian war parties. "Jacob yelled once, after starting with the
       Indians, but was knocked down by a gun in the hands of one of
       the savages. When he came to his senses, a squaw was dragging
       him up hill by one foot. He remained with the Indians for about
       two years, being adopted into a chief's family. He died in
       1862, in his eighty-ninth year."--R. G. T.

   [8] Thirtieth of June.--R. G. T.

   [9] The white loss, in killed, was 22, including Major
       McMahon.--R. G. T.

  [10] The force started August 8. Besides the regulars, were
       about 1,100 mounted Kentucky militia, under Gen. Charles
       Scott.--R. G. T.

  [11] Hence the popular name of the engagement, "Battle of
       Fallen Timbers."--R. G. T.

  [12] Alexander McKee, the renegade, of whom mention has
       frequently been made in foregoing pages.--R. G. T.

  [13] Later authorities place the white loss at 107, killed
       and wounded.--R. G. T.
