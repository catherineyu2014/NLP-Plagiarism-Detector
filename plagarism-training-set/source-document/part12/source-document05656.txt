    Shirt, Collars and Cuffs Laundered in the newest style of finish.
    "The DOMESTIC FINISH." No high gloss to look like Celluloid or Paper
    Collars, but a nice medium finish that has all the appearance of new
    work. High gloss finish is all out of style. Gentlemen these times
    always ask for the "Domestic Finish." We have equipped ourselves
    with the latest machines for this high grade of work.

    finish as new kid. Try us and be convinced.
