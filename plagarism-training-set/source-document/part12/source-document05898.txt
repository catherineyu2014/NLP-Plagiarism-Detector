[20] P. 90. Spanish half-crowns.

[21] P. 99. Socinians; followers of the teaching of Lalius and Faustus Socinus (16th century),
which denied the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the personality of the devil,
the native and total depravity of man, the vicarious atonement and eternal punishment. The
Socinians are now represented by the Unitarians. Manicheans; followers of Manes or Manichæus
(3rd century), a Persian who maintained that there are two principles, the one good and the
other evil, each equally powerful in the government of the world.

[22] P. 107. In the 1759 editions, in place of the long passage in brackets from here to page
215, there was only the following: "'Sir,' said the Perigordian Abbé to him, 'have you noticed
that young person who has so roguish a face and so fine a figure? You may have her for ten
thousand francs a month, and fifty thousand crowns in diamonds.' 'I have only a day or two
to give her,' answered Candide, 'because I have a rendezvous at Venice.' In the evening after
supper the insinuating Perigordian redoubled his politeness and attentions."

[23] P. 108. The play referred to is supposed to be "Le Comte d'Essex," by Thomas Corneille.

[24] P. 108. In France actors were at one time looked upon as excommunicated persons, not worthy
of burial in holy ground or with Christian rites. In 1730 the "honours of sepulture" were refused
to Mademoiselle Lecouvreur (doubtless the Miss Monime of this passage). Voltaire's miscellaneous
works contain a paper on the matter.

[25] P. 109. Élie-Catherine Fréron was a French critic (1719-1776) who incurred the enmity
of Voltaire. In 1752 Fréron, in Lettres sur quelques écrits du temps, wrote pointedly of Voltaire
as one who chose to be all things to all men, and Voltaire retaliated by references such as
these in Candide.

[26] P. 111. Gabriel Gauchat (1709-1779), French ecclesiastical writer, was author of a number
of works on religious subjects.

[27] P. 112. Nicholas Charles Joseph Trublet (1697-1770) was a French writer whose criticism
of Voltaire was revenged in passages such as this one in Candide, and one in the Pauvre Diable
beginning:

    L'abbé Trublet avait alors le rage
    D'être à Paris un petit personage.

[28] P. 120. Damiens, who attempted the life of Louis XV. in 1757, was born at Arras, capital
of Artois (Atrébatie).

[29] P. 120. On May 14, 1610, Ravaillac assassinated Henry VI.

[30] P. 120. On December 27, 1594, Jean Châtel attempted to assassinate Henry IV.

[31] P. 122. This same curiously inept criticism of the war which cost France her American
provinces occurs in Voltaire's Memoirs, wherein he says, "In 1756 England made a piratical
war upon France for some acres of snow." See also his Précis du Siècle de Louis XV.

[32] P. 123. Admiral Byng was shot on March 14, 1757.

[33] P. 129. Commenting upon this passage, M. Sarcey says admirably: "All is there! In those
ten lines Voltaire has gathered all the griefs and all the terrors of these creatures; the
picture is admirable for its truth and power! But do you not feel the pity and sympathy of
the painter? Here irony becomes sad, and in a way an avenger. Voltaire cries out with horror
against the society which throws some of its members into such an abyss. He has his 'Bartholomew'
fever; we tremble with him through contagion."

[34] P. 142. The following particulars of the six monarchs may prove not uninteresting. Achmet
III. (b. 1673, d. 1739) was dethroned in 1730. Ivan VI. (b. 1740, d. 1762) was dethroned in
1741. Charles Edward Stuart, the Pretender (b. 1720, d. 1788). Auguste III. (b. 1696, d. 1763).
Stanislaus (b. 1682, d. 1766). Theodore (b. 1690, d. 1755). It will be observed that, although
quite impossible for the six kings ever to have met, five of them might have been made to do
so without any anachronism.
