=The Royal Oak=

There is in Shropshire a fine oak-tree which the country people there call the "Royal Oak".
They say it is the great-grandson, or perhaps the great-great-grandson of another fine old
oak, which more than two hundred years ago stood on the same spot, and served once as a shelter
to an English king. This king was Charles II, the son of the unlucky Charles I who had his
head cut off by his subjects because he was a weak and selfish ruler.

On the very day on which that unhappy king lost his head, the Parliament passed a law forbidding
anyone to make his son, Prince Charles of Wales, or any other person, king of England. But
the Scottish people did not obey this law. They persuaded the young prince to sign a paper,
solemnly promising to rule the country as they wished; then they crowned him king. As soon
as the Parliament heard of this they sent Cromwell and his Ironsides against the newly-crowned
king and his followers, and after several battles the Scottish army was at last broken up and
scattered at Worcester.

Charles fled and hid in a wood, where some poor wood-cutters took care of him and helped him.
He put on some of their clothes, cut his hair short, and stained his face and hands brown so
that he might appear to be a sunburnt workman like them. But it was some time before he could
escape from the wood, for Cromwell's soldiers were searching it in the hope of finding some
of the king's men. One day, Charles and two of his friends had to climb into the tall oak to
avoid being caught. They had with them some food, which proved very useful, for they were obliged
to stay in their strange hiding-place for a whole day. The top of the oak-tree had been cut
off some few years before this time, and this had made the lower branches grow thick and bushy,
so that people walking below could not easily see through them. It was a fortunate thing for
Charles, for while he was in the tree, he heard the soldiers beating the boughs and bushes
in the wood as they searched here and there, and even caught glimpses of them through the leaves
as they rode about below.

When they had gone, without even glancing up into the tall oak-tree, he came down, and rode
away from the wood on an old mill-horse, with his friends the wood-cutters walking beside him
to take care of him as best they could. The saddle was a poor one, and the horse's pace jolted
Charles so much, that at last he cried out that he had never seen so bad a steed. At this the
owner of the horse jestingly told him that he should not find fault with the poor animal, which
had never before carried the weight of three kingdoms upon its back. He meant, of course, that
Charles was king of the three kingdoms of England, and Scotland, and Ireland.

Carried by the old horse, and helped by the poor wood-cutters, Charles at last reached the
house of a friend. Here he hid for a time, and then went on to try and escape from the country.
This time, so that he might not be discovered, he was dressed as a servant, and rode on horseback,
with a lady sitting on a cushion behind him, as was then the fashion. After several more dangers
he managed to get on board a ship and sailed away to France.

=Bonnie Prince Charlie=

Prince Charlie was the grandson of King James II, who was driven away from the throne of England
because he was a selfish man and a bad ruler. The young prince tried to win the crown back
again. He came over to Scotland from France, with only seven followers; but soon a great many
of the Scots joined him, for he was so gay, and handsome, and friendly, that all who saw him
loved him. They called him "Bonnie Prince Charlie". But though the prince and his followers
were very brave, they had no chance against the well-trained soldiers of King George of England.
They won a few victories; then they were thoroughly beaten in the battle of Culloden. Thousands
of brave Scots were slain, and the prince had to fly for his life.

After this, for many weeks, he hid among the moors and mountains from the English soldiers
who were trying to find him. He lived in small huts, or in caves, and many times had nothing
but the wild berries from the woods to eat. Once he stayed for three weeks with a band of robbers,
who were very kind to him; and though the king offered a large sum of money to anyone who would
give him up, not one of his poor friends was false to him.

At last, a young and beautiful Scottish lady, named Flora MacDonald, helped him to escape.
She gave him woman's clothes, and pretended that he was her servant, called Betty Burke. Then
she took him with her away from the place where the soldiers were searching, and after a time
he reached the sea, and got safely away to France.

=Nelson and Hardy=

Lord Nelson was one of the greatest seamen that ever lived. He commanded the British fleet
at the battle of Trafalgar, when the navies of France and Spain were beaten, and England was
saved from a great danger. He did not look like a famous admiral on board his ship, the Victory,
that day. He was a small man, and his clothes were shabby. He had lost one arm and one eye
in battle; but with the eye which remained he could see more than most men with two, and his
brain was busy planning the course of the coming fight. Just before it began, he went over
his ship, giving orders to the crew, and cheering them with kind words, which touched the hearts
of the rough men, who loved their leader and were proud of him. "England expects every man
to do his duty" was the last message he sent them. Every man did his duty nobly that day, though
the battle was fierce and long; but it was the last fight of the brave commander. He was shot
in the back as he walked the deck with his friend Captain Hardy, and was carried below.

He lay dying for several hours, but, in spite of his great pain, his one thought was of the
battle. "How goes the day with us?" he asked of Hardy; and when told that many of the enemies'
ships were taken, he cried eagerly, "I am glad. Whip them, Hardy, as they have never been whipped
before." Later, when his friend came to tell him that the victory was won, Nelson pressed his
hand. "Good-bye, Hardy!" said he, "I have done my duty, and I thank God for it." These were
the last words of one of England's bravest sons.

=Watt and the Kettle=

There was once a little Scotch boy named James Watt. He was not a strong child, and could not
always run and play with other boys, but had often to amuse himself at home. One holiday afternoon
little James amused himself in this way. He held a saucer over the stream of steam which came
from the spout of a boiling kettle, and as he watched he saw little drops of water forming
on the saucer. He thought this was very strange, and wondered why it happened, for he did not
know that steam is just water changed in form by the heat, and that as soon as it touches something
cold it turns again into water. He asked his aunt to explain it, but she only told him not
to waste his time. If she could have foreseen the work which her nephew would do when he became
a man, she would not have thought he was wasting his time.

When James Watt grew up, he was as much interested in steam and its wonderful power, as he
had been as a boy. He was sure it could be made of great service to men. It was already used
for driving engines, but the engines were not good, and it cost much money to work them. Watt
thought they could be improved, but it was long before he found out the way to do this. Often,
he sat by the fire watching the lid of the kettle as it was made to dance by the steam, and
thinking of many plans; and at last a happy thought came to him. His plan enabled great improvements
to be made in the working of engines, and now steam drives our trains and ships, our mills
and factories, and is one of our most useful servants.

=Queen Victoria and her Soldiers=

Queen Victoria was always proud of her brave soldiers. In time of war, she gave orders that
news of them was to be sent to her every day, and when the generals returned home, they were
commanded to visit her, and to tell her of the bravery of the troops.

During the long war with the Russians in the Crimea, the British soldiers suffered greatly
from the freezing winds, and rain, and snow, of that cold land. When Queen Victoria heard of
this, she and her children worked with their own hands to make warm clothing for them. A great
many of the wounded and sick men were sent home in ships, to be nursed in the English hospitals,
and the Queen paid several visits to the poor fellows as they lay there. Moving from one bed
to another, she cheered them with hopeful words, and listened gladly to their stories of the
battles in which they had fought. When she saw that the hospitals were crowded, and not very
comfortable, she told Parliament that better ones ought to be provided, and after a time this
was done, and the fine hospital of Netley was built, of which the Queen laid the first stone.

Once, Queen Victoria herself gave medals to some wounded and disabled soldiers who had fought
very bravely. Some of these men could not raise their arms to salute their queen; some could
not walk, but had to be wheeled in chairs to her side; but all were proud to receive their
medals of honour from her hands.

"Noble fellows," she wrote of them afterwards, "I feel as if they were my own children."

=The Relief of Lucknow=

During the time of the terrible Indian Mutiny, when most of the native troops rose against
their British rulers, and vowed to kill every white person in the land, many cruel deeds were
done. A great number of white people were slain before the British troops could come to their
rescue, but in some places they managed to hold out until help reached them. This was the case
in the city of Lucknow, where the British governor with a small body of troops, and a great
many women and children, took refuge in the Government House from a vast host of rebels who
came to attack them. Many of the brave defenders were killed by the shot and shell of the enemy.
Many others, and especially the little children, fell sick and died, for the heat was very
great, and there was no good water to be had. Then, after many days, a small body of white
soldiers fought their way into the city, and brought help and hope to the rest of the party.
They were only just in time. Had they come a few days later they would have found the Government
House a heap of ruins, and their friends dead, for the rebels were making a mine under the
building and meant to blow it up with gunpowder. But alas! the newcomers were not strong enough
to fight their way out of Lucknow with a crowd of helpless women and children and sick folk,
so they, too were now shut in. For two months longer they held out. Then at last, when they
had almost lost hope, the great Sir Colin Campbell with his brave Highlanders and other soldiers
defeated the rebels, and brought the band of sick, starving, and weary people safely away.

=Grace Darling=

On a small rocky island, off the north coast of England, there is a lighthouse. A man named
William Darling was once keeper of this lighthouse, and his daughter Grace lived with him.
Every day Grace Darling helped her father to trim the lamps, so that at night they might shine
brightly, and warn sailors to steer their ships away from the dangerous rocks, upon which they
would have been dashed to pieces.

One stormy night Grace woke with the sound of screams in her ears. The screams came from the
sea, so she knew that some ship must be in distress. She roused her father, but they could
see nothing in the darkness. When daylight came, they found that a ship had been wrecked upon
the rocks some way off, and a few people were clinging to the masts. Grace wished to go at
once in a boat to save them; but at first her father hung back, for the wind and sea were wild,
and he feared that the small boat would be overturned by the great waves. Then Grace ran to
the boat, and seized an oar, for she could not bear to let the poor men die without trying
to save them; and the father could not let his brave, daughter go alone, so he followed, and
they rowed off.

It was hard work pulling against the strong sea, and several times the small boat was almost
sunk. But at last it reached the wreck, and William Darling managed to land upon the rock,
and with great care and skill helped the half-frozen people into the small boat. Then they
were taken to the lighthouse, where Grace warmed and fed them, until the storm ceased, and
they could return to their homes.

=David Livingstone=

At one time many people believed that the middle of Africa was a sandy desert, where nothing
could live but camels and ostriches. But they were mistaken. The great traveller, David Livingstone,
journeyed into this unknown country, and he found that it was not a desert but a beautiful
land, where many tribes of black people dwelt. He also saw that these people were often seized
by strangers, and taken away to be sold as slaves. This sight filled him with sadness, and
he made up his mind to put a stop to this cruel traffic. He worked hard, tracing the courses
of the rivers, finding the best tracts of land, and teaching the natives. Then he urged his
countrymen to send others after him to settle in this fair country, to help the natives to
learn useful trades, and to drive away the slave-merchants.

For some years he was quite alone, with his black servants, in the midst of this wild land.
His friends grew anxious, and sent Mr. Stanley, another great traveller, to look for him. Stanley
marched for nearly a year before he found Livingstone. The old explorer was white and worn
with sickness and hardship, and he was overjoyed to clasp once more the hand of a white man,
and to hear again the English tongue. But he would not return to England. He said his work
was not yet done, and he set out once more on his travels. It was his last journey. One morning
his servants found him dead upon his bed. Since that time much has been done to make Central
Africa a prosperous land. Other white men have followed where Livingstone led, and wherever
they have settled, the wicked slave-trade has been stopped.

=The Battle of Waterloo=

Fields of waving corn, green woods, fruitful orchards, a pretty farmhouse and a few cottages--such
was the plain of Waterloo. And there, on a summer Sunday, nearly a hundred years ago, was fought
a famous battle, in which the British troops under the Duke of Wellington beat the French army,
and broke the power of the great Napoleon for ever.

"We have them," cried Napoleon as he saw the British drawn up before him. He thought it would
be easy to destroy this army, so much smaller than his own, before their friends the Prussians,
who were on the way to help them, came up. But he was mistaken. Wellington had placed his foot-soldiers
in squares, and though the French horsemen, then the finest soldiers in the world, charged
again and again, these little clumps of brave men stood fast. On his favourite horse "Copenhagen",
Wellington rode to and fro cheering his men. "Stand firm, my lads," cried he. "What will they
say to this in England?"

Not till evening, when the Prussians came, would he allow them to charge the French in their
turn. Then, waving his cocked hat over his head, he gave the order, "The whole line will advance",
and the impatient troops dashed forward. The French bravely tried to stand against this terrific
charge, but they were beaten back, and the battle of Waterloo was ended.

Sixty thousand men lay dead or wounded under the fruit-trees, and among the trampled corn and
grass at the end of that terrible day.

=The Charge of the Light Brigade=

Forward the Light!

Such was the order given during a great battle to the leader of a band of six hundred British
soldiers. Forward! And there in front was a line of cannon ready to shoot them down as they
came, while on the hills on either side of the valley were the guns and riflemen of the Russians.

"Surely someone has blundered! My men are sent to certain death," thought the leader of the
Light Brigade.

"Forward! Attack!"

The order was repeated, and with the obedience of well-trained soldiers the Brigade started.

On every side thundered the enemy's guns, and shot and shell fell thick and fast, but on through
all rode the brave horsemen, on till they reached the cannon at the end of the valley. The
smoke of the enemy's fire closed round and hid them from their watching comrades, but now and
again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those who tried to stop their charge.

And then only, when the strange order had been obeyed, when their duty had been nobly done
in the face of death, did the Light Brigade--all that was left of it--turn to ride back. Alas!
there were not then six hundred. Barely two hundred brave men, wounded, and blackened by smoke
and powder, reached the British camp. The rest of the noble band lay dead or dying in the valley
of Death.

=The Coronation of King Edward VII=

Never had a country a more popular king than King Edward VII, nor a more gracious queen than
Queen Alexandra, and never was a happier day for the English people than that on which King
Edward was crowned. A few days before the date fixed for the Coronation the king suddenly became
ill, and a great gloom fell over the country, for it was feared that he might never be crowned.
But though his illness was severe he soon began to get better, and when he was out of danger
the hearts of his subjects were filled with joy and thankfulness. Guns were fired, church-bells
pealed, and glad shouts and cheers rang out from the happy crowds which lined the streets of
London, through which the king and queen, in the midst of their gay procession, drove to Westminster
Abbey.

Inside the gray old Abbey was one of the most brilliant gatherings the world has ever seen.
Princes and princesses from other lands were there, in their robes of state; peers and peeresses,
in velvet, and ermine, and glittering diamonds; grave statesmen; and soldiers in their gay
uniforms.

It was a grand and solemn scene when, before them all, the aged Archbishop of Canterbury drew
near to the King, and with trembling hands placed the crown upon his head. These are the words
that the old man said when he had crowned the king, and each one of us will pray that all these
blessings may indeed rest upon King Edward VII, and the great Empire over which he rules.

=WAR.=

  Over the broad, fair valley,
    Filling the heart with fear,
  Comes the sound of tramping horses,
    And the news of danger near.

  'Tis the enemy approaching,
    One can hear the muffled drum,
  And the marching of the soldiers,
    As on and on they come.

  Soon the air is rent in sunder,
    Bullets flying sharp and fast,
  Many stout hearts fail and tremble,
    Every moment seems their last.

  On the ground lie dead and dying,
    Young and old alike must fall;
  None to come and aid the sufferer,
    Fight they must for freedom's call.

  Many are the anxious loved ones
    Praying for the war to cease,
  Waiting for the right to conquer,
    Bringing freedom, rest, and peace.

A BOY'S HEROIC DEEDS.

May 31st, 1889, is a day that will long be remembered with horror by the people in the beautiful
valley of the Conemaugh, in Pennsylvania. On that date occurred the terrible disaster which
is known to the world and will be named in history as the "Johnstown Flood."

For many days previous to that date it had been raining hard, and great floods extended over
a vast region of country in Pennsylvania, New York and the District of Columbia. Never before
had there been such a fall of rain in that region within the memory of the oldest inhabitant.
The waters in the river and creeks of that beautiful valley rose rapidly and overflowed their
banks, while the people looked on in wonder, but seemingly not in fear. Suddenly there appeared
to their wondering gaze a great bay horse galloping at break-neck speed and bearing a rider
who waved his hands to them and cried: "South Fork dam will burst. To the hills for your lives."
Only a few heeded his words of warning, while many mocked and jeered. On dashed the rider to
warn still others of the impending danger, and, alas, to be himself and horse dashed to death
by the massive timbers of a falling bridge. South Fork dam did break, and the mighty waters
of Conemaugh Lake were hurled with resistless force upon the doomed people of that beautiful
valley. The terrible details of the appalling disaster would fill several volumes larger than
this. On rushed the mighty waters, sweeping onward in their flood dwellings, churches and buildings
of every description, whether of wood, brick or stone, until Johnstown was reached and destroyed.
The town was literally lifted from its foundations. Thousands of men, women and children were
caught up and swirled away in the pitiless flood, and their agonizing but vain appeals for
help could be heard amidst the mighty roar of the waters. Many acts of heroism were performed
by brave men and women--yes, and boys--in rescuing victims of the flood. Only one of them concerns
us here. Charles Hepenthal, a schoolboy, seventeen years of age, who was on his way to Bellefonte
from his home at East Liberty, Pa., on the evening of the flood, stood quietly among the passengers
on the express train, as they crowded to view the terrible havoc done by the flood. As the
flood reached the train, at Sang Hollow, a small frame house came pitching down the mad tide,
an eddy floated it in, near to the train, so close that the wailing cries of an infant were
heard, piercing their way through the roar. Charles Hepenthal's heart was touched and his courage
was equal to the emergency. He determined to rescue that little wailing waif from a watery
grave. Strong men urged him to desist, insisting that he would only sacrifice his own life
for nothing--that it was impossible for any one to survive in the surging waters. But the boy
was resolved. He cut the bell cord from the cars, tied it fast to his body, and out into the
whirling gulf he went; he gained the house, secured the infant and returned through the maddened
waters with the rescued babe in his arms. A shout went up from the passengers on the train.
"Wait!" he cried; "there is still another in the house, I must save her!" and, seizing a plank
to use as a support, he plunged again into the surging waters. Ah! his struggle this time was
harder, for his precious load was heavy. In the floating house on his first visit he found
a little girl, apparently ten years old, disrobed and kneeling beside her bed, on which lay
the screaming infant, praying to her Father in heaven to save her and her baby brother from
the fury of the flood. "God has heard my prayer," she cried, as Charles entered the door. "Oh,
save the baby, quick," and then fainted away on the floor. When Charles had landed the babe
in safety and returned again for the girl, he found her still unconscious on the floor, and
the water was fast flowing in at the door. In another minute she would have been drowned. But
the brave boy's manly arms were soon around her, and with his precious load the young hero
fought his way back to land and was given three times three cheers and a "tiger" by the passengers
of the day express.
