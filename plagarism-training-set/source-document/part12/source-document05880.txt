Friday Night.--Tithes Debate, which has had general effect of depressing the human mind, acted
upon CRANBORNE like electric shock. Astonished and interested House to-night by vigorous speech
delivered in favour of Bill. With clenched hands and set teeth declared that he "meant to fight
for Established Church till death." He put it to the piratical PICTON and other marauders,
whether, seeing that in such case the conflict must necessarily be prolonged, they would not
do well to seize this opportunity of settling Tithe question?

Business done.--Second Reading Tithes Bill agreed to by 289 Votes against 164.

"A (NOT) AT HOME."--Last week a paragraph appeared in an illustrated paper contradicting the
report (published in an earlier issue) that a certain titled Lady had been present at somebody's
party. This novel departure should be useful as a precedent to the crême de la crême of suburban
society. In future, such announcements as the following may be expected to be frequently found
in the "Fashionable Intelligence" columns of the more aspiring of our Penny Socials:--"On Thursday
last Mr. and Mrs. MADEIRA TOP-FLOOR SMITHIES entertained a small and select party at their
new residence, The Hollies, 24A, Zanzibar Terrace, Peckham Rye, East. Amongst those present
we did not notice H.S.H. the Prince of TECK, the Duke of WESTMINSTER, Lady BURDETT-COUTTS,
and the LORD CHANCELLOR. In the general circle, Lord CROSS, the Countess of CLARENDON, and
the Bishop of LONDON, were also conspicuous by their absence. It was rumoured that neither
the Duke of CAMBRIDGE nor Mr. GLADSTONE were expected to join the company before the close
of the entertainment."

DINNER SCARCELY À LA ROOSE.--Dear Mr. Punch,--I am a poor man, but I like a nice dinner. Now
I have discovered how to enjoy a good meal, and yet keep the cost of living within reasonable
limits. Here is my method. I order and eat, a lobster, two pounds of pork chops, a large-sized
pot of pâté de foies gras, a dressed crab, and three plates of toasted cheese. Having finished
this dainty little dinner, I find that I can eat nothing more for at least a week! That the
pleasing fare does not make me ill, is proved by my friends declaring that I look like a picture
of health. They do not say whether the picture is a good or bad one--but that is a matter of
detail.

Yours sincerely,

  THE FOUNDER OF THE MORE-THAN-ENOUGH SOCIETY.

UTOPIAN.--Neither noise, vibration, nor dust! That's what the BRAMWELLS, the WATKINS, and the
GALTONS claim for that partly-developed but promising--much promising--invention of M. GIRARD'S,
the Chemin de Fer Glissant, or Sliding Railway. What a happy ideal! By all means, "Let it slide!"

A CHANCE FOR A NEW MEMBER.--"Rookeries," said Mr. HENRY LAZARUS in his evidence at Marylebone,
"abound in St. Pancras, and it is a scandal to civilisation that they should continue to exist."
Now, Mr. BOLTON, M.P., can't you have your legal and parliamentary finger in this Rook pie?
