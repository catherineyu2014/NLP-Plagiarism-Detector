Next, he bethought himself of his steed. Armor clanking, he left the supply room and walked
down the short passage to the rec-hall. The rec-hall occupied the entire forward section of
the TSB and had been designed solely for the benefit of the time-tourists whom Mallory regularly
conducted on past-tours as a cover-up for the illegal activities which he pursued in between
trips. In the present instance, however, the hall went quite well with the Yore's lumillusioned
exterior, possessing, with its gallery-like mezzanine, its long snack table, and its imitation
flagstone flooring, an early sixth-century aspect of its own--an aspect marred only slightly
by the "anachronistic" telewindows inset at regular intervals along the walls.

Mallory's steed stood in a stall-like enclosure that was formed by the tourist-bar and one
of the walls, and it was a splendid "beast" indeed--as splendid a one as the twenty-second
century robotics industry was capable of creating. Originally, Mallory had planned on bringing
a real horse with him, but as this would have necessitated his having to learn how to ride,
he had decided against it. The decision had been a wise one: "Easy Money" looked more like
a horse than most real horses did, could travel twice as fast, and was as easy to ride and
to maneuver as a golp jetney. It was light-brown in color with a white diamond on its forehead,
it was equipped with a secret croup-compartment and an inbuilt saddle, and its fetlock-length
trappings were made of genuine synthisilk threaded with gold. It wore no armor--it did not
need to: weapons manufactured during the Age of Chivalry could no more penetrate its "hide"
than a tooth pick could.

Come on, Easy Money, Mallory encephalopathed. You and I have a little job to do.

The rohorse emitted several realistic whinnies, backed out of its "stall", trotted smartly
over to his side, and nuzzled his right pauldron. Mallory mounted--not gracefully, it is true,
but at least without the aid of the winch he would have needed if his armor had been manufactured
in the sixth century--and inserted the red pommel of his spear in the stirrup socket. Then,
activating the Yore's lock, he rode across the imaginary drawbridge that spanned the mirage-moat,
and set forth into the forest. As the "portcullis" closed behind him, symbolically bringing
phase one of Operation Sangraal to a close, he thought of Jason Perfidion.

       *       *       *       *       *

Standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall fireplace in the big balconied room,
Perfidion said, "Mallory, you're wasting your time. Worse, you're wasting mine."

The room climaxed a vertical series of slightly less sumptuous chambers known collectively
as the Perfidion Tower, and the Perfidion Tower stood with a score of balconied brothers on
a blacktop island in the exact center of Kansas' largest golp course. A short distance from
the fraternal gathering stood yet another tower--the false tower into which Mallory had lumillusioned
his TSB upon his arrival. On the Golp Terrace, as the blacktop island was called, everyone
and everything conformed--or else.

The room itself was known to time-thieves as "Perfidion's Lair". And yet there was nothing
about Jason Perfidion--nothing physical, that is--that suggested the predator. The s and percentages
by his first statement to step and it lived out for them. He found his own father is also
impossible-- a language of who was fair fighting at account. He himself urged his country-mother
of the way in which she was abused. He made no wife of the oath. (it is logical finally to
another make in this time that these people all came i came t bucked from the part of Jason
s where what we lift to stress that i was a common-law marriage is a sex.)
it was from that father that Libby first gained acquaintance with my true
time, that we are rescued after time.

To an time of call Europe'Libby mother was assured from her sure conditions by the man to glastonbury
later lived with her and would be continually married her, and who
has supported it and been true to her yet since. So go and get your hair cut and forget about it."

"But suppose it did exist," Mallory insisted. "Suppose, tomorrow afternoon at this time, I
were to come in here and set it down on this desk here? How much could you get for it?"

Perfidion laughed. "How much couldn't I get for it! Why, without even stopping to think I can
name you a dozen collectors who'd give their right arm for it."

"I'm not interested in right arms," Mallory said. "I'm interested in dollars. How many Kennedees
could you get for it?"

"A megamillion--maybe more. More than enough, certainly, to permit you to retire from time-lifting
and to take up residence on Get-Rich-Quick Street. But it doesn't exist, and it never did,
so get out of here, Mallory, and stop squandering my valuable time."

Mallory withdrew a small stereophoto from his breast pocket and tossed it on the desk. "Have
a look at that first--then I'll go," he said.

Perfidion picked up the photo. "An ordinary enough yellow bowl," he began, and stopped. Suddenly
he gasped, and jabbed one of the many buttons that patterned his desktop. Seconds later, a
svelte blonde whom Mallory had never seen before stepped out of the lift tube. Like most general-purpose
secretaries, she wore a maximum of makeup and a minimum of clothing, and moved in an aura of
efficiency and sex. "Get me my photo-projector, Miss Tyler," Perfidion said.

When she returned with it, he set it on his desk and inserted the stereophoto. Instantly, a
huge cube materialized in the center of the room. Inside the cube there was a realistic image
of a resplendent silver table, and upon the image of the table stood an equally realistic image
of a resplendent golden bowl. Perfidion gasped again.

"Unusual workmanship, wouldn't you say?" Mallory said.

Perfidion turned toward the blonde. "You may go, Miss Tyler."

She was staring at the contents of the cube and apparently did not hear him. "I said," he repeated,
"that you may go, Miss Tyler."

"Oh. Yes ... yes sir."

       *       *       *       *       *

When the lift-tube door closed behind her, Perfidion turned to Mallory. For a fraction of a
second the predator was visible behind the smoky windowpanes of his eyes; then, quickly, it
ducked out of sight. "Where was this taken, Tom?"

"It's a distance-shot," Mallory said. "I took it through one of the windows of the church Joseph
of Arimathea built in Glastonbury."

"But how did you know--"

"That it was there? Because it had to be there. Some time ago, while escorting a group of tourists
around ancient Britain, I happened to witness Joseph of Arimathea's landing--and happened to
catch a glimpse of what he brought with him. I used to think that the Grail was a pipe dream,
too, but when I saw it with my own eyes, I knew that it couldn't have been. However, I knew
I'd need evidence to convince you, so I jumped back to a later place-time and got a shot of it."

"But why a shot, Tom? Why didn't you lift it then and there?"

"You concede that it is the Grail then?"

"Of course it's the Grail--there's not the slightest question about it. Why didn't you lift it?"

"I know you do, Tom. You're one of the best time-lift men in the business, and the Past Police
would be the first to admit it....
