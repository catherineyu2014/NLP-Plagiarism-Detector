THOMAS WINGFOLD, CURATE.

CHAPTER I.

RACHEL AND HER UNCLE.

It was nearly dark when they arrived again at the lodge. Rachel opened the gate for them. Without
even a THANK YOU, they rode out. She stood for a moment gazing after them through the dusk,
then turned with a sigh, and went into the kitchen, where her uncle sat by the fire with a
book in his hand.

"How I should like to be as well made as Miss Lingard!" she said, seating herself by the lamp
that stood on the deal-table. "It MUST be a fine thing to be strong and tall, and able to look
this way and that without turning all your body along with your head, like the old man that
gathers the leeches in Wordsworth's poem. And what it must be to sit on a horse as she does!
You should have seen her go flying like the very wind across the park! You would have thought
she and her horse were cut out of the same piece. I'm dreadfully envious, uncle."

"No, my child; I know you better than you do yourself. There is a great difference between
I WISH I WAS and I SHOULD LIKE TO BE--as much as between a grumble and a prayer. To be content
is not to be satisfied. No one ought to be satisfied with the imperfect. It is God's will that
we should bear, and contentedly--because in hope, looking for the redemption of the body. And
we know he has a ready servant who will one day set us free."

"Yes, uncle; I understand. You know I enjoy life: how could I help it and you with me? But
I don't think I ever go through the churchyard without feeling a sort of triumph. 'There's
for you!' I say sometimes to the little crooked shadow that creeps along by my side across
the graves. 'You'll soon be caught and put inside!'--But how am I to tell I mayn't be crooked
in the next world as well as this? That's what troubles me at times. There might be some necessity
for it, you know."

"Then will there be patience to bear it there also; that you may be sure of. But I do not fear.
It were more likely that those who have not thanked God, but prided themselves that they were
beautiful in this world, should be crooked in the next. It would be like Dives and Lazarus,
you know. But God does what is best for them as well as for us. We shall find one day that
beauty and riches were the best thing for those to whom they were given, as deformity and poverty
were the best for us."

"I wonder what sort of person I should have been if I had had a straight spine!" said Rachel
laughing.

"Hardly one so dear to your deformed uncle," said her companion in ugliness.

"Then I'm glad I am as I am," rejoined Rachel.

"This conscious individuality of ours," said Polwarth, after a thoughtful silence, "is to me
an awful thing--the one thing that seems in humanity like the onliness of God. Mine terrifies
me sometimes--looking a stranger to me--a limiting of myself--a breaking in upon my existence--like
a volcanic outburst into the blue Sicilian air. When it thus manifests itself, I find no refuge
but the offering of it back to him who thought it worth making. I say to him: 'Lord, it is
thine, not mine;--see to it, Lord. Thou and thy eternity are mine, Father of Jesus Christ.'"

He covered his eyes with his hands, and his lips grew white, and trembled. Thought had turned
into prayer, and both were silent for a space. Rachel was the first to speak.

"I think I understand, uncle," she said. "I don't mind being God's dwarf. But I would rather
be made after his own image; this can't be it. I should like to be made over again."

"And if the hope we are saved by be no mockery, if St. Paul was not the fool of his own radiant
imaginings, you will be, my child.--But now let us forget our miserable bodies. Come up to
my room, and I will read you a few lines that came to me this morning in the park."

"Won't you wait for Mr. Wingfold, uncle? He will be here yet, I think. It can't be ten o'clock.
He always looks in on Saturdays as he goes home from his walk. I should like you to read them
to him too. They will do him good, I know."

"I would, my dear, willingly, if I thought he would care for them. But I don't think he would.
They are not good enough verses. He has been brought up on Horace, and, I fear, counts the
best poetry the neatest."

"I think you must be mistaken there, uncle; I have heard him talk delightfully about poetry."

"You must excuse me if I am shy of reading my poor work to any but yourself, Rachel. My heart
was wo much in it, and the subject is so sacred--"

"I am sorry you should think your pearls too good to cast before Mr. Wingfold, uncle," said
Rachel, with a touch of disappointed temper.

"Nay, nay, child," returned Polwarth, "that was not a good thing to say. What gives me concern
is, that there is so much of the rough dirty shell sticking about them, that to show them would
be to wrong the truth in them."

Rachel seldom took long to repent. She came slowly to her uncle, where he stood with the lamp
in his hand, looking in his face with a heavenly contrition, and saying nothing. When she reached
him, she dropped on her knees, and kissed the hand that hung by his side. Her temper was poor
Rachel's one sore-felt trouble.

Polwarth stooped and kissed her on the forehead, raised her, and leading her to the stair,
stood aside to let her go first. But when she had been naughty Rachel would never go before
her uncle, and she drew back. With a smile of intelligence he yielded and led the way. But
ere they had climbed to the top, Rachel heard Mr. Wingfold's step, and went down again to receive
him.

CHAPTER II.

A DREAM.

Invited to ascend, Wingfold followed Rachel to her uncle's room, and there, whether guided
by her or not, the conversation presently took such a turn that at length, of his own motion,
Polwarth offered to read his verses. From the drawer of his table he took a scratched and scored
halfsheet, and--not in the most melodious of voices, yet in one whose harshness and weakness
could not cover a certain refinement of spiritual tenderness--read as follows:

    Lord, hear my discontent: All blank I stand,
    A mirror polished by thy hand;
    Thy sun's beams flash and flame from me--
    I cannot help it: here I stand, there he;
    To one of them I cannot say--
    Go, and on yonder water play.
    Nor one poor ragged daisy can I fashion--
    I do not make the words of this my limping passion.
    If I should say: Now I will think a thought,
    Lo! I must wait, unknowing,
    What thought in me is growing,
    Until the thing to birth is brought;
    Nor know I then what next will come
    From out the gulf of silence dumb.
    I am the door the thing did find
    To pass into the general mind;
    I cannot say I think--
    I only stand upon the thought-well's brink;
    From darkness to the sun the water bubbles up--
    I lift it in my cup.
    Thou only thinkest--I am thought;
    Me and my thought thou thinkest. Nought
    Am I but as a fountain spout
    From which thy water welleth out.
    Thou art the only One, the All in all.
    --Yet when my soul on thee doth call
    And thou dost answer out of everywhere,
    I in thy allness have my perfect share.

While he read Rachel crept to his knee, knelt down, and laid her head upon it.

If we are but the creatures of a day, yet surely were the shadow-joys of this miserable pair
not merely nobler in their essence, but finer to the soul's palate than the shadow-joys of
young Hercules Bascombe--Helen and horses and all! Poor Helen I cannot use for comparison,
for she had no joy, save indeed the very divine, though at present unblossoming one of sisterly
love. Still, and notwithstanding, if the facts of life are those of George Bascombe's endorsing--AND
HE CAN PROVE IT--let us by all means learn and accept them, be they the worst possible. Meantime
there are truths that ought to be facts, and until he has proved that there is no God, some
of us will go feeling after him if haply we may find him, and in him the truths we long to
find true. Some of us perhaps think we have seen him from afar, but we only know the better
that in the mood wherein such as Bascombe are, they will never find him--which would no doubt
be to them a comfort were it not for a laughter. And if he be such as their idea of what we
think him, they ARE better without him. If, on the contrary, he be what some of us really think
him, their not seeking him will not perhaps prevent him from finding them.

From likeness of nature, community of feeling, constant intercourse, and perfect confidence,
Rachel understood her uncle's verses with sufficient ease to enjoy them at once in part, and,
for the rest, to go on thinking in the direction in which they would carry her; but Wingfold,
in whom honesty of disposition had blossomed at last into honesty of action, after fitting
pause, during which no word was spoken, said:--

"Mr. Polwarth, where verse is concerned, I am simply stupid: when read I cannot follow it. Her
was obeying where do i had lobby him, moiety, and appear of what me. But when he see that him was

sass, are slackly scarlet; and small opinion, street.

 Well, that night, I dreamed thus:
I was in a desert. It was neither day nor night to me. I saw neither sun, moon, nor stars.
A heavy, yet half-luminous cloud hung over the visible earth. My heart was beating fast and
high, for I was journeying towards a certain Armenian convent, where I had good ground for
hoping I should find the original manuscript of the fourth gospel, the very handwriting of
the apostle John. That the old man did not write it himself, I never thought of that in my dream.

"After I had walked on for a long, anything but weary time, I saw the level horizon line before
me broken by a rock, as it seemed, rising from the plain of the desert. I knew it was the monastery.
It was many miles away, and as I journeyed on it grew and grew, until it swelled huge as a
hill against the sky. At length I came up to the door, iron-clamped, deep-set in a low thick
wall. It stood wide open. I entered, crossed a court, reached the door of the monastery itself,
and again entered. Every door to which I came stood open, but priest nor guide came to meet
me, and I saw no man, and at length looked for none, but used my best judgment to get deeper
and deeper into the building, for I scarce doubted that in its inmost penetralia I should find
the treasure I sought. At last I stood before a door hung with a curtain of rich workmanship,
torn in the middle from top to bottom. Through the rent I passed into a stone cell. In the
cell stood a table. On the table was a closed book. Oh how my heart beat! Never but then have
I known the feeling of utter preciousness in a thing possessed. What doubts and fears would
not this one lovely, oh unutterably beloved volume, lay at rest for ever! How my eyes would
dwell upon every stroke of every letter the hand of the dearest disciple had formed! Nearly
eighteen hundred years--and there it lay!--and there WAS a man who DID hear the Master say
the words, and did set them down! I stood motionless, and my soul seemed to wind itself among
the leaves, while my body stood like a pillar of salt, lost in its own gaze. At last, with
sudden daring, I made a step towards the table, and, bending with awe, stretched out my hand
to lay it upon the book. But ere my hand reached it, another hand, from the opposite side of
the table, appeared upon it--an old, blue-veined, but powerful hand. I looked up. There stood
the beloved disciple! His countenance was as a mirror which shone back the face of the Master.
Slowly he lifted the book, and turned away. Then first I saw behind him as it were an altar
whereon a fire of wood was burning, and a pang of dismay shot to my heart, for I knew what
he was about to do. He laid the book on the burning wood, and regarded it with a smile as it
shrunk and shrivelled and smouldered to ashes. Then he turned to me and said, while a perfect
heaven of peace shone in his eyes: 'Son of man, the Word of God liveth and abideth for ever,
not in the volume of the book, but in the heart of the man that in love obeyeth him. And therewith
I awoke weeping, but with the lesson of my dream."

A deep silence fell on the little company. Then said Wingfold,

"I trust I have the lesson too."

He rose, shook hands with them, and, without another word, went home.

CHAPTER III.

ANOTHER SERMON.

It often seems to those in earnest about the right as if all things conspired to prevent their
progress. This of course is but an appearance, arising in part from this, that the pilgrim
must be headed back from the side paths into which he is constantly wandering. To Wingfold,
however, it seemed that all things fell in to further his quest, which will not be so surprising
if we remember that his was no intermittent repentant seeking, but the struggle of his whole
energy. And there are those who, in their very first seeking of it, are nearer to the kingdom
of heaven than many who have for years believed themselves of it.

In the former there is more of the mind of Jesus, and when he calls them they recognize him
at once and go after him; while the others examine him from head to foot, and, finding him
not sufficiently like the Jesus of their conception, turn their backs, and go to church, or
chapel, or chamber, to kneel before a vague form mingled of tradition and fancy. But the first
shall be last, and the last first; and there are from whom, be it penny or be it pound, what
they have must be taken away because with them it lies useless.

For Wingfold, he soon found that his nature was being stirred to depths unsuspected before.
Hitherto nothing had ever roused him to genuine activity: his history not very happy; his life
not very interesting, his work not congenial, and paying itself in no satisfaction, his pleasures
of a cold and common intellectual sort,--he had dragged along, sustained, without the sense
of its sustentation, by the germ within him of a slowly developing honesty. But now that Conscience
had got up into the guard's seat, and Will had taken the reins, he found all his intellectual
faculties in full play, keeping well together, heads up and traces tight, while the outrider
Imagination, with his spotted dog Fancy, was always far ahead, but never beyond the sound of
the guard's horn; and ever as they went, object after object hitherto beyond the radius of
his interest, rose on the horizon of question, and began to glimmer in the dawn of human relation.

His first sermon is enough to show that he had begun to have thoughts of his own--a very different
thing from the entertaining of the thoughts of others, however well we may feed and lodge them--thoughts
which came to him not as things which sought an entrance, but as things that sought an exit--cried
for forms of embodiment that they might pass out of the infinite, and by incarnation become
communicable.

The news of that strange first sermon had of course spread through the town, and the people
came to church the next Sunday in crowds-- twice as many as the usual assembly--some who went
seldom, some who went nowhere, some who belonged to other congregations and communities--mostly
bent on witnessing whatever eccentricity the very peculiar young man might be guilty of next,
but having a few among them who were sympathetically interested in seeing how far his call,
if call it was, would lead him.

His second sermon was to the same purport as the first. Preposing no text, he spoke to the
following effect, and indeed the following are of the very words he uttered:

"The church wherein you now listen, my hearers, the pulpit wherein I now speak, stand here
from of old in the name of Christianity. What is Christianity? I know but one definition, the
analysis of which, if the thing in question be a truth, must be the joyous labour of every
devout heart to all eternity. For Christianity does not mean what you think or what I think
concerning Christ, but what IS OF Christ. My Christianity, if ever I come to have any, will
be what of Christ is in me; your Christianity now is what of Christ is in you. Last Sunday
I showed you our Lord's very words--that he, and no other, was his disciple who did what he
told him,--and said therefore that I dared not call myself a disciple. I say the same thing
in saying now that I dare not call myself a Christian, lest I should offend him with my 'Lord,
Lord!' Still it is, and I cannot now help it, in the name of Christianity that I here stand.
I have, alas, with blameful and appalling thoughtlessness I subscribed my name, as a believer,
to the Articles of the Church of England, with no better reason than that I was unaware of
any dissent therefrom, and have been ordained one of her ministers. The relations into which
this has brought me I do not feel justified in severing at once, lest I should therein seem
to deny that which its own illumination may yet show me to be true, and I desire therefore
a little respite and room for thought and resolve. But meantime it remains my business, as
an honest man in the employment of the church, to do my best towards the setting forth of'the
claims of him upon whom that church is founded, and in whose name she exists. As one standing
on the outskirts of a listening Galilean crowd, a word comes now and then to my hungry ears
and hungrier heart: I turn and tell it again to you--not that ye have not heard it also, but
that I may stir you up to ask yourselves: 'Do I then obey this word? Have I ever, have I once
sought to obey it? Am I a pupil of Jesus? Am I a Christian?' Hear then of his words. For me,
they fill my heart with doubt and dismay.

"The Lord says: Love your enemies. Sayest thou, It is impossible? Then dost thou mock the word
of him who said, I am the Truth, and has no part in him. Sayest thou, Alas, I cannot? Thou
sayest true, I doubt not. But hast thou tried whether he who made will not increase the strength
put forth to obey him?

"The Lord says: Be ye perfect. Dost thou then aim after perfection, or dost thou excuse thy
wilful short-comings, and say, To err is human--nor hopest that it may also be found human
to grow divine? Then ask thyself, for thou hast good cause, whether thou hast any part in him.

"The Lord said, Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth. My part is not now to preach
against the love of money, but to ask you: Are you laying up for yourselves treasures on earth?
As to what the command means, the honest heart and the dishonest must each settle in his own
way; but if your heart condemn you, what I have to say is, Call not yourselves Christians,
but consider whether you ought not to become disciples indeed. No doubt you can instance this,
that, and the other man who does as you do, and of whom yet no man dreams of questioning the
Christianity: it matters not a hair; all that goes but to say that you are pagans together.
Do not mistake me: I judge you not. I but ask you, as mouthpiece most unworthy of that Christianity
in the name of which this building stands and we are met therein, to judge your own selves
by the words of its founder.

"The Lord said: Take no thought for your life. Take no thought for the morrow. Explain it as
you may or can--but ask yourselves--Do I take no thought for my life? Do I take no thought
for the morrow? and answer to yourselves whether or no ye are Christians.

"The Lord says: Judge not. Didst thou judge thy neighbour yesterday? Wilt thou judge him again
to-morrow? Art thon judging him now in the very heart that within thy bosom sits hearing the
words Judge not? Or wilt thou ask yet again--Who is my neighbour? How then canst thou look
to be of those that shall enter through the gates into the city? I tell thee not, for I profess
not yet to know anything, but doth not thy own profession of Christianity counsel thee to fall
upon thy face, and cry to him whom thou mockest, 'I am a sinful man, O Lord'?

"The Lord said: All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
them. Ye that buy and sell, do you obey this law? Examine yourselves and see. Ye would that
men should deal fairly by you; do you deal fairly by them as ye would count fairness in them
to you?--If conscience makes you hang the head inwardly, however you sit with it erect in the
pew, dare you add to your crime against the law and the prophets the insult to Christ of calling
yourselves his disciples? He will none but those who with him do the will of the Father."

CHAPTER IV.

NURSING.

I have of course given but the spine and ribs, as it were, of the sermon. There is no place
for more. It is enough however to show that he came to the point--and what can be better in
preaching? Certainly he was making the best of the blunder that had led him up into that pulpit!
And on the other hand, whatever might be the various judgments and opinions of his hearers
in respect of the sermon--a thing about which the less any preacher allows himself to think
the better--many of them did actually feel that he had been preaching to them, which is saying
much. Even Mrs. Ramshorn was more silent than usual as they went home, and although--not having
acquainted herself, amongst others, with the sermons of Latimer--she was profoundly convinced
that such preaching was altogether contrary to the tradition, usage, and tone of the English
Church, of which her departed dean remained to her the unimpeachable embodiment and type, the
sole remark she made was, that Mr. Wingfold took quite too much pains to prove himself a pagan.
Mr. Bascombe was in the same mind as before.

"I like the fellow," he said. "He says what he means, fair and full, and no shilly-shallying.
It's all great rubbish, of course!"

And the widow of the dean of blessed memory had not a word to say in defence of the sermon,
but, for her, let it go as the great rubbish he called it. Indeed, not knowing the real mind
of her nephew, she was nothing less than gratified to hear from him an opinion so comfortably
hostile to that of this most uncomfortable of curates, whom you never could tell where to have,
and whom never since he had confessed to wrong in the reading of his uncle's sermons, and thus
unwittingly cast a reproach upon the memory of him who had departed from the harassed company
of deans militant to the blessed company of deans triumphant, had she invited to share at her
table of the good things left behind.

"Why don't you ask him home to dinner, aunt?" said Bascombe, after a pause unbroken by Mrs.
Ramshorn.

"Why should I, George?" returned his aunt. "Has he not been abusing us all at a most ignorant
and furious rate?"

"Oh! I didn't know," said the nephew, and held his peace. Nor did the aunt perceive the sarcasm
for the sake of pointing which he was silent. But it was not lost, and George was paid in full
by the flicker of a faint smile across Helen's face.

As for Helen, the sermon had indeed laid a sort of feebly electrical hold upon her, the mere
nervous influence of honesty and earnestness. But she could not accuse herself of having ever
made a prominent profession of Christianity, confirmation and communion notwithstanding; and
besides, had she not now all but abjured the whole thing in her heart? so that, if every word
of what he said was true, not a word of it could be applied to her! And what time had she to
think about such far-away things as had happened eighteen centuries ago, when there was her
one darling pining away with a black weight on his heart!

For, although Leopold was gradually recovering, a supreme dejection, for which his weakness
was insufficient to account, prostrated his spirit, and at length drove Mr. Faber to ask Helen
whether she knew of any disappointment or other source of mental suffering that could explain
it. She told him of the habit he had formed, and asked whether his being deprived of the narcotic
might not be the cause. He accepted the suggestion, and set himself, not without some success,
to repair the injury the abuse had occasioned. Still, although his physical condition plainly
improved, the dejection continued, and Mr. Faber was thrown back upon his former conjecture.
Learning nothing, however, and yet finding that, as he advanced towards health, his dejection
plainly deepened, he began at length to fear softening of the brain, but could discover no
other symptom of such disease.

The earnestness of the doctor's quest after a cause for what anyone might observe, added greatly
to Helen's uneasiness; and besides, the fact itself began to undermine the hope of his innocence
which had again sprung up and almost grown to assurance in the absence of any fresh contradiction
from without. Also, as his health returned, his sleep became more troubled; he dreamed more,
and showed by his increased agitation in his dreams that they were more painful. In this respect
his condition was at the worst always between two and three o'clock in the morning; and having
perceived this fact, Helen would never allow anyone except herself to sit up with him the first
part of the night.

Increased anxiety and continued watching soon told upon her health yet more severely, and she
lost appetite and complexion. Still she slept well during the latter part of the morning, and
it was in vain that aunt and doctor and nurse all expostulated with her upon the excess of
her ministration: nothing should make her yield the post until her brother was himself again.
Nor was she without her reward, and that a sufficing one--in the love and gratitude with which
Leopold clung to her.

During the day also she spent every moment, except such as she passed in the open air, and
at table with her aunt, by his bedside, reading and talking to him; but as yet not a single
allusion had been made to the frightful secret.

At length he was so much better that there was no longer need for anyone to sit up with him;
but then Helen had her bed put in the dressing-room, that at one o'clock she might be by his
side, to sit there until three should be well over and gone.

Thus she gave up her whole life to him, and doubtless thereby gained much fresh interest in
it for herself. But the weight of the secret, and the dread of the law, were too much for her,
and were gradually undermining that strength of dissimulation in which she had trusted, and
which, in respect of cheerfulness, she had to exercise towards her brother as well as her aunt.
She struggled hard, for if those weak despairing eyes of his were to encounter weakness and
despair in hers, madness itself would be at the door for both. She had come nearly to the point
of discovering that the soul is not capable of generating its own requirements, that it needs
to be supplied from a well whose springs lie deeper than its own soil, in the infinite All,
namely, upon which that soil rests. Happy they who have found that those springs have an outlet
in their hearts--on the hill of prayer.

It was very difficult to lay her hands on reading that suited him. Gifted with a glowing yet
delicate eastern imagination, pampered and all but ruined, he was impatient of narratives of
common life, whose current bore him to a reservoir and no sea; while, on the other hand, some
tales that seemed to Helen poverty-stricken flats of nonsense, or jumbles of false invention,
would in her brother wake an interest she could not understand, appearing to afford him outlooks
into regions to her unknown. But from the moral element in any story he shrunk visibly. She
tried the German tales collected by the brothers Grimm, so popular with children of all ages;
but on the very first attempt she blundered into an awful one of murder and vengeance, in which,
if the drawing was untrue, the colour was strong, and had to blunder clumsily out of it again,
with a hot face and a cold heart. At length she betook herself to the Thousand and One Nights,
which she had never read, and found very dull, but which with Leopold served for what book
could do.

In the rest of the house things went on much the same. Old friends and their daughters called
on Mrs. Ramshorn, and inquired after the invalid, and George Bascombe came almost every Saturday,
and stayed till Monday. But the moment the tide of her trouble began again to rise, Helen found
herself less desirous of meeting one from whom she could hope neither help nor cheer. It might
be that future generations of the death-doomed might pass their poor life a little more comfortably
that she had not been a bad woman, and she might be privileged to pass away from the world,
as George taught her, without earning the curses of those that came after her; but there was
her precious brother lying before her with a horrible worm gnawing at his heart, and what to
her were a thousand generations unborn! Rather with Macbeth she might well "wish the estate
o' the world were now undone"--most of all when, in the silent watches of the night, as she
sat by the bedside of her beloved and he slept, his voice would come murmuring out of a dream,
sounding so far away that it seemed as if his spirit only and not his lips had spoken the words,
"Oh Helen, darling, give me my knife. Why will you not let me die?"

CHAPTER V.

GLASTON AND THE CURATE.

Outside, the sun rose and set, never a crimson thread the less in the garment of his glory
that the spirit of one of the children of the earth was stained with blood-guiltiness; the
moon came up and knew nothing of the matter; the stars minded their own business; and the people
of Glaston were talking about their curate's sermons. Alas, it was about his sermons, and not
the subject of them, that men talked, their interest mainly roused by their PECULIARITY, and
what some called the oddity of the preacher.

What had come to him? He was not in the least like that for months after his appointment, and
the change came all at once! Yes--it began with those extravagant notions about honesty in
writing his own sermons! It might have been a sunstroke, but it took him far too early in the
year for that! Softening of the brain it might be, poor fellow! Was not excessive vanity sometimes
a symptom?--Poor fellow!

So said some. But others said he was a clever fellow, and long-headed enough to know that that
sort of thing attracted attention, and might open the way to a benefice, or at least an engagement
in London, where eloquence was of more account than in a dead-and-alive country place like
Glaston, from which the tide of grace had ebbed, leaving that great ship of the church, the
Abbey, high and dry on the shore.

Others again judged him a fanatic--a dangerous man. Such did not all venture to assert that
he had erred from the way, but what man was more dangerous than he who went too far? Possibly
these forgot that the narrow way can hardly be one to sit down in comfortably, or indeed to
be entered at all save by him who tries the gate with the intent of going all the way--even
should it lead up to the perfection of the Father in heaven. "But," they would in effect have
argued, "is not a fanatic dangerous? and is not an enthusiast always in peril of becoming a
fanatic?--Be his enthusiasm for what it may--for Jesus Christ, for God himself, such a man
is dangerous-- most dangerous! There are so many things, comfortably settled like Presumption's
tubs upon their own bottoms, which such men would, if they could, at once upset and empty!"

Others suspected a Romanizing drift in the whole affair. "Wait until he gathers influence,"
they said, "and a handful of followers, and then you'll see! They'll be all back to Rome together
in a month!"

As the wind took by the tail St. Peter's cock on the church spire and whirled it about, so
did the wind of words in Glaston rudely seize and flack hither and thither the spiritual reputation
of Thomas Wingfold, curate. And all the time, the young man was wrestling, his life in his
hand, with his own unbelief; while upon his horizon ever and anon rose the glimmer of a great
aurora, or the glimpse of a boundless main--if only he could have been sure they were no mirage
of his own parched heart and hungry eye--that they were thoughts in the mind of the Eternal,
and THRERFORE had appeared in his, even as the Word was said to have become flesh and dwelt
with men! The next moment he would be gasping in that malarious exhalation from the marshes
of his neglected heart--the counter-fear, namely, that the word under whose potent radiance
the world seemed on the verge of budding forth and blossoming as the rose, was TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

"Yes, much too good, if there be no living, self-willing Good," said Polwarth one evening,
in answer to the phrase just dropped from his lips. "But if there be such a God as alone could
be God, can anything be too good to be true?--too good for such a God as contented Jesus Christ?"

At one moment he was ready to believe everything, even to that strangest, yet to me right credible
miracle of the fish and the piece of money, and the next to doubt whether man had ever dared
utter the words, "I and the Father are one." Tossed he was and tormented in spirit, calling
even aloud sometimes to know if there was a God anywhere hearing his prayer, sure only of this,
that whatever else any being might be, if he heard not prayer, he could not be the God for
whom his soul cried and fainted. Sometimes there came to him, it is true, what he would gladly
have taken for an answer, but it was nothing more than the sudden descent of a kind of calmness
on his spirit, which, for aught he could tell, might be but the calm of exhaustion. His knees
were sore with kneeling, his face white with thinking, his eyes dim with trouble; for when
once a man has set out to find God, he must find him or die. This was the inside reality whose
outcome set the public of Glaston babbling. It was from this that George Bascombe magisterially
pronounced him a hypochondriac, worrying his brain about things that had no existence--as George
himself could with confidence testify, not once having seen the sight of them, heard the sound
of them, or imagined in his heart that they ought to be, or even that they might possibly be.
He pronounced indeed their existence inconsistent with his own. The thought had never rippled
the grey mass of his self-satisfied brain that perhaps there was more of himself than what
he counted he himself yet knew, and that possibly these matters had a consistent relation with
parts unknown. Poor, poverty-stricken Wingfold! --actually craving for things beneath Bascombe's
notice! actually crying for something higher and brighter than the moon! How independent was
George compared with Thomas!--content to live what he called his life, be a benefactor to men,
chiefly in ridding their fancies of the goblins of aspiration, then die his death, and have
done with the business; while poor misguided, weak-brained, hypochondriacal Thomas could be
contented with nothing less than the fulfilment of the promise of a certain man who perhaps
never existed: "The Father and I will come to him and make our abode with him."

Yet Thomas too had his weakness for the testimony of the senses. If he did not, like George,
refuse to believe without it, he yet could not help desiring signs and wonders that he might
believe. Of this the following poem was a result, and I give it the more willingly because
it will show how the intellectual nature of the man had advanced, borne on the waves that burst
from the fountains of the great deep below it.

    O Lord, if on the wind, at cool of day,
        I heard one whispered word of mighty grace;
    If through the darkness, as in bed I lay,
        But once had come a hand upon my face;

    If but one sign that might not be mistook,
        Had ever been, since first thy face I sought,
    I should not now be doubting o'er a book,
        But serving thee with burning heart and thought.

    So dreams that heart. But to my heart I say,
        Turning my face to front the dark and wind:
    Such signs had only barred anew His way
        Into thee, longing heart, thee, wildered mind.

    They asked the very Way, where lies the way;
        The very Son, where is the Father's face;
    How he could show himself, if not in clay,
        Who was the lord of spirit, form, and space.

    My being, Lord, will nevermore be whole
        Until thou come behind mine ears and eyes,
    Enter and fill the temple of my soul
        With perfect contact--such a sweet surprise--

    Such presence as, before it met the view,
        The prophet-fancy could not once foresee,
    Though every corner of the temple knew
        By very emptiness its need of thee.

    When I keep ALL thy words, no favoured some--
        Heedless of worldly winds or judgment's tide,
    Then, Jesus, thou wilt with thy Father come--
        O ended prayers!--and in my soul abide.

    Ah long delay!--ah cunning, creeping sin!
        I shall but fail and cease at length to try:
    O Jesus, though thou wilt not yet come in,
        Knock at my window as thou passest by.

CHAPTER VI.

THE LINEN-DRAPER.

But there was yet another class amongst those who on that second day heard the curate testify
what honestly he might, and no more, concerning Jesus of Nazareth. So far as he learned, however,
that class consisted of one individual.

On the following Tuesday morning he went into the shop of the chief linen-draper of Glaston,
for he was going to a funeral, and wanted a new pair of gloves that he might decline those
which would be offered him. A young woman waited on him, but Mr. Drew, seeing him from the
other end of the shop, came and took her place. When he was fitted, had paid for his purchase,
and was turning to take his leave, the draper, with what appeared a resolution suddenly forced
from hesitation, leaned over the counter and said:

"Would you mind walking up stairs for a few minutes, sir? I ask it as a great favour. I want
very much to speak to you."

"I shall be most happy," answered Wingfold--conventionally, it must be allowed, for in reality
he anticipated expostulation, and having in his public ministrations to do his duty against
his own grain, he had no fancy for encountering other people's grain as well in private. Mr.
Drew opened certain straits in the counter, and the curate followed him through them, then
through a door, up a stair, and into a comfortable dining-room, which smelt strongly of tobacco.
There Mr. Drew placed for him a chair, and seated himself in front of him.

The linen-draper was a middle-aged, middle-sized, stoutish man, with plump rosy cheeks, keen
black eyes, and features of the not uncommon pug-type, ennobled and harmonized by a genuine
expression of kindly good-humour, and an excellent forehead. His dark hair was a little streaked
with gray. His manner, which, in the shop, had been of the shop, that is, more deferential
and would-be pleasing than Wingfold liked, settled as he took his seat into one more resembling
that of a country gentleman. It was courteous and friendly, but clouded with a little anxiety.

An uncomfortable pause following, Wingfold stumbled in with the question, "I hope Mrs. Drew
is well," without reflecting whether he had really ever heard of a Mrs. Drew.

The draper's face flushed.

"It is twenty years since I lost her, sir," he returned. In his tone and manner there was something
peculiar.

"I beg your pardon," said Wingfold, with self-accusing sincerity.

"I will be open with you sir," continued his host: "she left me--with another--nearly twenty
years ago."

"I am ashamed of my inadvertence," rejoined Wingfold. "I have been such a short time here, and--"

"Do not mention it, sir. How could you help it? Besides, it was not here the thing took place,
but a hundred miles away. I hope I should before long have referred to the fact myself. But
now I desire, if you will allow me, to speak of something different."

"I am at your service," answered Wingfold.

"Thank you, sir.--I was in your church last Sunday," resumed the draper after a pause. "I am
not one of your regular hearers, sir; but your sermon that day set me thinking, and instead
of thinking less when Monday came, I have been thinking more and more ever since; and when
I saw you in the shop, I could not resist the sudden desire to speak to you. If you have time,
sir, I hope you will allow me to come to the point my own way?"

Wingfold assured him that his time was at his own disposal, and could not be better occupied.
Mr. Drew thanked him and went on.

"Your sermon, I must confess, sir, made me uncomfortable--no fault of yours, sir--all my own--though
how much the fault is, I hardly know: use and custom are hard upon a man, sir, and you would
have a man go by other laws than those of the world he lives in. The earth is the Lord's and
the fulness thereof--you will doubtless say. That is over the Royal Exchange in London, I think;
but it is not the laws of the Lord that are specially followed inside for all that. However,
it is not with other people we have to do, but with ourselves--as you will say. Well then it
is for myself I am troubled now. Mr. Wingfold, sir, I am not altogether at ease in my own mind
as to the way I have made my money--what little money I have--no great sum, but enough to retire
upon when I please. I would not have you think me worse than I am, but I am sincerely desirous
of knowing what you would have me do."

"My dear sir," returned Wingfold, "I am the very last to look to for enlightenment. I am as
ignorant of business as any child. I am not aware that I ever bought anything except books
and clothes, or ever sold anything except a knife to a schoolfellow. I had bought it the day
before for half-a-crown, but there was a spot of rust on one of the blades, and therefore I
parted with it for twopence. The only thing I can say is: if you have been in the way of doing
anything you are no longer satisfied with, don't do it any more."

"But just there comes my need of help. You must do something with your business, and DON'T
DO IT, don't tell me what to do. Mind I do not confess to having done anything the trade would
count inadmissible, or which is not done in the largest establishments. What I now make a question
of I learned in one of the most respectable of London houses."

"You imply that a man in your line who would not do certain things the doing of which has contributed
to the making of your fortune, would by the ordinary dealer be regarded as Quixotic?"

"He would; but that there may be such men I am bound to allow, for here am I wishing with all
my heart that I had never done them. Right gladly would I give up the money I have made by
them to be rid of them. I am unhappy about it. But I should never have dared to confess it
to you, sir, or, I believe, to anyone, but for the confession you made in the pulpit some time
ago. I was not there, but I heard of it. I foolishly judged you unwise to accuse yourself before
an unsympathizing public--but here am I in consequence accusing myself to you!"

"To no unsympathising hearer, though," said the curate.

"It made me want to go and hear you preach," pursued the draper; "for no one could say but
it was plucky--and we all like pluck, sir," he added, with a laugh that puckered his face,
showed the whitest of teeth, and swept every sign of trouble from the half-globe of his radiant
countenance.

"Then you know sum and substance of what I can do for you, Mr. Drew: I can sympathize with
you;--not a whit more or less am I capable of. I am the merest beginner and dabbler in doing
right myself, and have more need to ask you to teach me than to set up for teaching you."

"That's the beauty of you!--excuse me, sir," cried the draper triumphantly. "You don't pretend
to teach us anything, but you make us so uncomfortable that we go about ever after asking ourselves
what we ought to do. Till last Sunday, I had always looked upon myself as an honest man: let
me see: it would be more correct to say I looked on myself as a man QUITE HONEST ENOUGH. That
I do not feel so now, is your doing, sir. You said in your sermon last Sunday, and specially
to business men: 'Do you do to your neighbour as you would have your neighbour do to you? If
not, how can you suppose that the lord of Christians will acknowledge you as a disciple of
his, that is, as a Christian?' Now I was even surer of being a Christian than of being an honest
man. You will hardly believe it, and what to think of it myself I now hardly know, but I had
satisfied myself, more or less, that I had gone through all the necessary stages of being born
again, and it is now many years since I was received into a Christian church--dissenting of
course, I mean; for what I count the most important difference after all between church and
dissent is that the one, right or wrong, requires for communion a personal profession of faith,
and credible proof of conversion--which I believed I gave them, and have been for years, I

 There is the snowdrop in the snow! There is the butterfly!
There is the rain of summer, and the clearing of the sky after a storm! There is the hen gathering
her chickens under her wing!--I begin to doubt whether there be the common-place anywhere except
in our own mistrusting nature, that will cast no care upon the Unseen. It is with me, in regard
to my better life, as it was with the disciples in regard to their bodily life, when they were
for the time rendered incapable of understanding the words of our Lord by having forgotten
to take bread in the boat: they were so afraid of being hungry that they could think of nothing
but bread."

Such were some of the curate's thoughts as he walked home, and they drove him to prayer, in
which came more thoughts. When he reached his room he sat down at his table, and wove and knotted
and pieced together the following verses, venturing that easy yet perilous thing, a sonnet.
I give here its final shape, not its first or second:

Methought I floated sightless, nor did know That I had ears until I heard the cry As of a mighty
man in agony: "How long, Lord, shall I lie thus foul and slow? The arrows of thy lightning
through me go, And sting and torture me--yet here I lie A shapeless mass that scarce can mould
a sigh." The darkness thinned; I saw a thing below, Like sheeted corpse, a knot at head and
feet. Slow clomb the sun the mountains of the dead, And looked upon the world: the silence
broke! A blinding struggle! then the thunderous beat Of great exulting pinions stroke on stroke!
And from that world a mighty angel fled.

But upon the heels of the sonnet came, as was natural, according to the law of reaction, a
fresh and more appalling, because more self-assertive and verisimilous invasion of the commonplace.
What a foolish, unreal thing he had written! He caught up his hat and stick and hurried out,
thinking to combat the demon better in the open air.

CHAPTER IX.

THE COMMON-PLACE.

It was evening, and the air was still warm. Pine Street was almost empty, save of the red sun,
which blinded him so that wherever he looked he could only see great sunblots. All but a few
of the shops were closed, but amongst the few he was surprised to find that of his friend the
linendraper, who had always been a strong advocate of early closing. The shutters were up,
however, though the door stood wide open. He peeped in. To his sun-blinded eyes the shop looked
very dark, but he thought he saw Mr. Drew talking to some one, and entered. He was right; it
was the draper himself, and a poor woman with a child on one arm, and a print dress she had
just bought on the other. The curate leaned against the counter, and waited until business
should be over to address his friend.

"Is Mr. Drew an embryonic angel?" he half felt, half thought within himself. "Is this shop
the chrysalis of a great psyche? Will the draper, with his round good-humoured face and puckering
smile, ever spread thunderous wings and cleave the air up to the throne of God?"

"I cannot tell you how it goes against me to take that woman's money," said the voice of the
draper.

The curate woke up in the presence of the unwinged, and saw that the woman had left the shop.

"I did let her have the print at cost-price," Mr. Drew went on, laughing merrily. "That was
all I could venture on."

"Where was the danger?"

"Ah, you don't know so well as I do the good of having some difficulty in getting what you
need! To ease the struggles of the poor, unless it be in sickness or absolute want, I have
repeatedly proved to be a cruel kindness."

"Then you don't sell to the poor women at cost-price always?"

"No--only to the soldiers' wives. They have a very hard life of it, poor things!"

"That is your custom, then?"

"For the last ten years, but I don't let them know it."

"Is it for the soldiers' wives you keep your shop open so late? I thought you were the great
supporter of early closing in Glaston," said the curate.

"I will tell you how it happened to-night," answered the draper, and as he spoke he turned
round, not his long left ear upon the pivot of his skull, but his whole person upon the pivot
of the counter--to misuse the word pivot with Wordsworth--and bolted the shop-door.

"After the young men had put up the shutters and were gone," he said, returning to the counter,
"leaving me as usual to bolt the door, I fell a-thinking. Outside, the street was full of sunlight,
but only enough came in to show how gloomy the place was without more of it, and the back of
the shop was nearly dark. It was very still too--so still that the silence seemed to have taken
the shape of gloom. Pardon me for talking in this unbusiness-like way: a man can't be a draper
always; he must be foolish sometimes. Thirty years ago I used to read Tennyson. I believe I
was amongst the earliest of his admirers."

"Foolish!" echoed Wingfold, thoughtfully.

"You see," the draper went on, "there IS something solemn in the quiet after business is over.
Sometimes it's more so, sometimes less; but this night it came upon me that the shop felt like
a chapel--had the very air of one somehow, and so I fell a thinking, and forgot to shut the
door. How it began I don't know, but my past life came up to me, and I remembered how, when
I was a young man, I used to despise my father's business, to which he was bringing me up,
and feed my fancy with things belonging to higher walks in life. Then I saw that must have
been partly how I fell into the mistake of marrying Mrs. Drew. She was the daughter of a doctor
in our town, a widower. He was in poor health, and unable to make much of his practice, so
that when he died she was left destitute, and for that reason alone, I do believe, accepted
me. What followed you know: she went away with a man who used to travel for a large Manchester
house. I have never heard of her since.

"After she left me, a sort of something which I think I may call the disease of self-preservation,
laid hold upon me. I must acknowledge that the loss of my wife was not altogether a misery.
She despised my trade, which drove me to defend it--and the more bitterly that I also despised
it. There was therefore a good deal of strife between us. I did not make allowance enough for
the descent she had made from a professional father to a trade-husband. I forgot that, if she
was to blame for marrying me for bread, I was to blame for marrying her to enlarge myself with
her superiority. After she was gone, I was aware of a not unwelcome calm in the house, and
in the emptiness of that calm came the demon of selfishness sevenfold into my heart, and took
up his abode with me. From that time I busied myself only about two things--the safety of my
soul, and a good provision for my body. I joined the church I had occasion to mention to you
before, sir, grew a little harder in my business dealings, and began to lay by money. And so,
ever since, have I been going on till I heard your sermon the other day, which I hope has waked
me up to something better.--All this long story is but to let you understand how I was feeling
when that woman came into the shop. I told you how, in the dusk and the silence, it was as
if I were in the chapel. I found myself half-listening for the organ. Then the verse of a hymn
came into my mind--I can't tell where or when I had met with it, but it had stuck to me:

    Let me stand ever at the door,
        And keep it from the entering sin,
    That so thy temple, walls and floor,
        Be pure for thee to enter in.

"Now that, you see, is said of the temple of the heart; but somehow things went rather cross-cut
that evening--they got muddled in my head. It seemed as if I was the door-keeper of my shop,
and at the same time as if my shop, spreading out and dimly vanishing in the sacred gloom,
was the temple of the Holy Ghost, out of which I had to keep the sin. And with the thought,
a great awe fell upon me: could it be--might it not be that God was actually in the place?--that
in the silence he was thinking--in the gloom he was knowing? I laid myself over the counter,
with my face in my hands, and went on half thinking, half praying. All at once the desire arose
burning in my heart: Would to God my house were in truth a holy place, haunted by his presence!
'And wherefore not?' rejoined something within me--heart or brain or something deeper than
either. 'Is thy work unholy? Are thy deeds base? Is thy buying or selling dishonest? Is it
all for thyself and nothing for thy fellows? Is it not a lawful calling? Is it, or is it not,
of God? If it be of God, and yet he be not present, then surely thy lawful calling thou followest
unlawfully." So there I was--brought back to the old story. And I said to myself, 'God knows
I want to follow it lawfully. Am I not even now seeking how to do so? But this, though true,
did not satisfy me. To follow it lawfully--even in his sight--no longer seemed enough.--Was
there then no possibility of raising it to dignity? Did the business of Zacchaeus remain, after
the visit of Jesus, a contemptible one still? Could not mine be made Christian? Was there no
corner in the temple where a man might buy and sell and not be driven out by the whip of small
cords?--I heard a step in the shop, and lifting my head, saw a poor woman with a child in her
arms. Annoyed at being found in that posture, like one drunk or in despair; annoyed also with
myself for not having shut the door, with my usual first tendency to injustice a harsh word
was trembling on my very lips, when suddenly something made me look round in a kind of maze
on the dusky back shop. A moment more and I understood: God was waiting to see what truth was
in my words. That is just how I felt it, and I hope I am not irreverent in saying so. Then
I saw that the poor woman looked frightened--I suppose at my looks and gestures--perhaps she
thought me out of my mind. I made haste and received her, and listened to her errand as if
she had been a duchess--say rather an angel of God, for such I felt her in my heart to be.
She wanted a bit of dark print with a particular kind of spot in it, which she had seen in
the shop some months before, but had not been able to buy. I turned over everything we had,
and was nearly in despair. At last, however, I found the very piece which had ever since haunted
her fancy--just enough of it left for a dress! But all the time I sought it, I felt as if I
were doing God service--or at least doing something he wanted me to do. It sounds almost ludicrous
now, but--"

"God forbid!" said Wingfold.

"I'm glad you don't think so, sir. I was afraid you would."

"Had the thing been a trifle, I should still have said the same," returned the curate. "But
who with any heart would call it--a trifle to please the fancy of a poor woman, one who is
probably far oftener vexed than pleased? She had been brooding over this dress--you took trouble
to content her with her desire. Who knows what it may do for the growth of the woman? I know
what you've done for me by the story of it."

"She did walk out pleased-like," said the draper, "--and left me more pleased than she,--and
so grateful to her for coming--you can't think!"

"I begin to suspect," said the curate, after a pause, "that the common transactions of life
are the most sacred channels for the spread of the heavenly leaven. There was ten times more
of the divine in selling her that gown as you did, in the name of God, than in taking her into
your pew and singing out of the same hymn-book with her."

"I should be glad to do that next though, if I had the chance," said Mr. Drew. "You must not
think, because he has done me so little good, that our minister is not a faithful preacher;
and, owing you more than heart can tell, sir, I like chapel better than church, and consider
it nearer the right way. I don't mean to be a turncoat, and leave Drake for you, sir; I must
give up my deaconship, but I won't my pew or my subscription."

"Quite right, Mr. Drew," said Wingfold; "that could do nothing but harm. I have just been reading
what our Lord says about proselytizing. Good night."

CHAPTER X.

HOME AGAIN. When he left the shop, the sun was far below the horizon, and the glory had faded
out of the west; but the demon had fled, and the brown feathers of the twilight were beautiful
as the wings of the silver dove, sprung heavenwards from among the pots. And as he went he
reasoned with himself--

"Either there is a God, and that God the perfect heart of truth and loveliness, or all poetry
and art is but an unsown, unplanted, rootless flower, crowning a somewhat symmetrical heap
of stones. The man who sees no beauty in its petals, finds no perfume in its breath, may well
accord it the parentage of the stones; the man whose heart swells beholding it will be ready
to think it has roots that reach below them."

The curate's search, it will be remarked, had already widened greatly the sphere of his doubts;
but, the larger the field, the greater the chance of finding a marl-pit; and, if there be such
a thing as truth, every fresh doubt is yet another finger-post pointing towards its dwelling.--So
talked the curate to himself, and, full in the face, rounding the corner of a street, met George
Bascombe.

The young barrister held out his large hospitable hand at the full length of his arm, and spread
abroad his wide chest to greet him, and they went through the ceremony of shaking hands,--which,
even in their case, I cannot judge so degrading and hypocritical as the Latin nations seem
to consider it. Then Wingfold had the first word.

"I have not yet had an opportunity of thanking you for the great service you have done me,"
he said.

"I am glad to know I have such an honour; but--"

"I mean, in opening my eyes to my true position."

"Ah, my dear fellow! I was sure you only required to have your attention turned in the right
direction. When--?--ah!--I--I was on the verge of committing the solecism of asking you when
you thought of resigning. Ha! ha!"

"Not yet," replied Wingfold to the question thus at once withdrawn and put. "The more I look
into the matter, the more reason I find for hoping it may be possible for me to--to--keep the
appointment."

"Oh!"

"The further I inquire, the more am I convinced that, if not in a certain portion of what the
church teaches, then nowhere else, and assuredly not in what you teach, shall I find anything
by which life can either account for or justify itself."

"But if what you find is not true!" cried George, with a burst of semi-grand indignation.

"But if what I find should be true, even though you should never be able to see it!" returned
the curate. And as if disjected by an explosion between them, the two men were ten paces asunder,
each hurrying his own way.

"If I can't prove there is a God," said Wingfold to himself, "as little surely can he prove
there is none."

But then came the thought--"The fellow will say that, there being no sign of a God, the burden
of proof lies with me." And therewith he saw how useless it would be to discuss the question
with any one who, not seeing him, had no desire to see him.

"No," he said, "my business is not to prove to any other man that there is a God, but to find
him for myself. If I should find him, then will be time enough to think of showing him." And
with that his thoughts turned from Bascombe, and went back to the draper.

When he reached home, he took out his sonnet, but, after working at it for a little while,
he found that he must ease his heart by writing another. Here it is:

    Methought that in a solemn church I stood.
    Its marble acres, worn with knees and feet,
    Lay spread from, door to door, from street to street.
    Midway the form hung high upon the rood
    Of him who gave his life to be our good;
    Beyond, priests flitted, bowed, and murmured meet
    Among the candles shining still and sweet.
    Men came and went, and worshipped as they could,
    And still their dust a woman with her broom,
    Bowed to her work, kept sweeping to the door.
    Then saw I, slow through all the pillared gloom,
    Across the church a silent figure come;
    "Daughter," it said, "thou sweepest well my floor!"
    It is the Lord! I cried; and saw no more.

I suppose, if one could so stop the throat of the blossom-buried nightingale, that, though
he might breathe at will, he could no longer sing, he would drop from his bough, and die of
suppressed song. Perhaps some men so die--I do not know; it were better than to live, and to
bore their friends with the insuppressible. But, however this may be, the man who can utter
himself to his own joy in any of the forms of human expression--let him give thanks to God;
and, if he give not his verses to the printer, he will probably have cause to give thanks again.
To the man's self, the utterance is not the less invaluable. And so Wingfold found it.

He went out again, and into the churchyard, where he sat down on a stone.

"How strange," he said to himself, "that out of faith should have sprung that stone church!
A poor little poem now and then is all that stands for mine--all that shows, that is! But my
heart does sometimes burn, within me. If only I could be sure they were HIS words that set
it burning!"

CHAPTER XI.

THE SHEATH.

"Mr. Wingfold," said Polwarth one evening, the usual salutations over, taking what he commonly
left to his friend--the initiative,--"I want to tell you something I don't wish even Rachel
to hear."

He led the way to his room, and the curate followed. Seated there, in the shadowy old attic,
through the very walls of which the ivy grew, and into which, by the open window in the gable,
from the infinite west, blew the evening air, carrying with it the precious scent of honeysuckle,
to mingle with that of old books, Polwarth recounted and Wingfold listened to a strange adventure.
The trees hid the sky, and the little human nest was dark around them.

"I am going to make a confidant of you, Mr. Wingfold," said the dwarf, with troubled face,
and almost whispered word. "You will know how much I have already learned to trust you when
I say that what I am about to confide to you plainly involves the secret of another."

His large face grew paler as he spoke, and something almost like fear grew in his eyes, but
they looked straight into those of the curate, and his voice did not tremble.

"One night, some weeks ago--I can, if necessary, make myself certain of the date,--I was--no
uncommon thing with me--unable to sleep. Sometimes, when such is my case, I lie as still and
happy as any bird under the wing of its mother; at other times I must get up and go out, for
I take longings for air almost as a drunkard for wine, and that night nothing would serve my
poor prisoned soul but more air through the bars of its lungs. I rose, dressed, and went out.

"It was a still, warm night, no moon, but plenty of star-light, the wind blowing as now, gentle
and sweet and cool--just the wind my lungs sighed for. I got into the open park, avoiding the
trees, and wandered on and on, without thinking where I was going. The turf was soft under
my feet, the dusk soft to my eyes, and the wind to my soul; I had breath and room and leisure
and silence and loneliness, and everything to make me more than usually happy; and so I wandered
on and on, neither caring nor looking whither I went: so long as the stars remained unclouded,
I could find my way back when I pleased.

"I had been out perhaps an hour, when through the soft air came a cry, apparently from far
off. There was something in the tone that seemed to me unusually frightful. The bare sound
made me shudder before I had time to say to myself it was a cry. I turned my face in the direction
of it, so far as I could judge, and went on. I cannot run, for, if I attempt it, I am in a
moment unable even to walk--from palpitation and choking.

"I had not gone very far before I found myself approaching the hollow where stands the old
house of Glaston, uninhabited for twenty years. Was it possible, I thought, that the cry came
from the house, and had therefore sounded farther off than it was? I stood and listened for
a moment, but all seemed still as the grave. I must go in, and see whether anyone was there
in want of help. You may well smile at the idea of my helping anyone, for what could I do if
it came to a struggle?"

"On the contrary," interrupted Wingfold, "I was smiling with admiration of your pluck."

"At least," resumed Polwarth, "I have this advantage over some, that I cannot be fooled with
the fancy that this poor miserable body of mine is worth thinking of beside the smallest suspicion
of duty. What is it but a cracked jug? So down the slope I went, got into the garden, and made
my way through the tangled bushes to the house. I knew the place perfectly, for I had often
wandered all over it, sometimes spending hours there.

"Before I reached the door, however, I heard some one behind me in the garden, and instantly
stepped into a thicket of gooseberry and currant bushes. It is sometimes an advantage to be
little--the moment I stepped aside I was hidden. That same moment the night seemed rent in
twain by a most hideous cry from the house. Ere I could breathe again after it, the tall figure
of a woman rushed past me, tearing its way through the bushes towards the door. I followed
instantly, saw her run up the steps, and heard her open and shut the door. I opened it as quietly
as I could, but just as I stepped into the dark hall, came a third fearful cry, through the
echoes of which in the empty house I heard the rush of hurried feet and trailing garments on
the stair. As I say I knew the house quite well, but my perturbation had so muddled the idea
of it in my brain, that for a few seconds I had to consider how it lay. The moment I recalled
its plan, I made what haste I could, reached the top of the stair, and was hesitating which
way to turn, when once more came the fearful cry, and set me trembling from head to foot. I
cannot describe the horror of it. It was as the cry of a soul in torture--unlike any sound
of the human voice I had ever before heard. I shudder now at the recollection of it as it echoed
through the house, clinging to the walls and driven along. I was hurrying I knew not whither,
for I had again lost all notion of the house, when I caught a glimpse of a light shining from
under a door. I approached it softly, and finding that door inside a small closet, knew at
once where I was. As I was in office on the ground, and it could hardly be any thing righteous
that led to such an outcry in the house, which, although deserted, was still my master's, I
felt justified in searching further into the matter. Laying my ear therefore against the door,
I heard what was plainly a lady's voice. Right sweet and womanly it was, though full of pain--even
agony, I thought, but heroically suppressed. She soothed, she expostulated, she condoled, she
coaxed. Mingled with hers was the voice of a youth, as it seemed. It was wild, yet so low as
sometimes to be all but inaudible, and not a word from either could I distinguish. Hardly the
less plain was it, however, that the youth spoke either in delirium or with something terrible
on his mind, for his tones were those of one in despair. I stood for a time bewildered, fascinated,
terrified. At length I grew convinced somehow that I had no right to be there. Doubtless the
man was in hiding, and where a man hides there must he reason, but was it any business of mine?
I crept out of the house, and up to the higher ground. There I drew deep breaths of the sweet
night air--so pure that it seemed to be washing the world clean for another day's uses. But
I had no longer any pleasure in the world. I went straight home, and to bed again--but had
brought little repose with me: I must do something--but what? The only result certain to follow,
was more trouble to the troubled already. Might there not be innocent reasons for the questionable
situation?--Might not the man have been taken ill, and so suddenly that he could reach no other
shelter? And the lady might be his wife, who had gone as soon as she could leave him to find
help, but had failed. There MUST be some simple explanation of the matter, however strange
it showed! I might, in the morning, be of service to them. And partly comforted by the temporary
conclusion, I got a little troubled sleep.

"As soon as I had had a cup of tea, I set out for the old house. I heard the sounds of the
workmen's hammers on the new one as I went. All else was silence. The day looked so honest
and so clear of conscience that it was difficult to believe the night had shrouded such an
awful meeting. Yet, in the broad light of the forenoon, a cold shudder seized me when first
I looked down on the slack ridges and broken roofs of the old house. When I got into the garden
I began to sing and knock the bushes about, then opened the door noisily, and clattered about
in the hall and the lower rooms before going up the stair. Along every passage and into every
room I went, to give good warning ere I approached that in which I had heard the voices. At
length I stood at the door of it and knocked. There was no answer. I knocked again. Still no
answer. I opened it and peeped in. There was no one there! An old bedstead was all I saw. I
searched every corner, but not one trace could I discover of human being having been there,
except this behind the bed--and it may have lain there as long as the mattress, which I remember
since the first time I ever went into the house."

As he spoke Polwarth handed to the curate a small leather sheath, which, from its shape, could
not have belonged to a pair of scissors, although neither of the men knew any sort of knife
it would have fitted.

"Would you mind taking care of it, Mr. Wingfold?" the gate-keeper continued as the curate examined
it; "I don't like having it. I can't even bear to think of it even in the house, and yet I
don't quite care to destroy it."

"I don't in the least mind taking charge of it," answered Wingfold.

Why was it that, as he said so, the face of Helen Lingard rose before his mind's eye as he
had now seen it twice in the congregation at the Abbey--pale with an inward trouble as it seemed,
large-eyed and worn--so changed, yet so ennobled? Even then he had felt the deadening effect
of its listlessness, and had had to turn away lest it should compel him to feel that he was
but talking to the winds, or into a desert where dwelt no voice of human response. Why should
he think of her now? Was it that her troubled pallid face had touched him--had set something
near his heart a trembling, whether with merely human sympathy or with the tenderness of man
for suffering woman? Certainly he had never till then thought of her with the slightest interest,
and why should she come up to him now? Could it be that--? Good heavens! There was her brother
ill! And had not Faber said there seemed something unusual about the character of his illness?--What
could it mean?--It was impossible of course--but yet--and yet--

"Do you think," he said, "we are in any way bound to inquire further into the affair?"

"If I had thought so, I should not have left it unmentioned till now," answered Polwarth. "But
without being busybodies, we might be prepared in case the thing should unfold itself, and
put it in our power to be useful. Meantime I have the relief of the confessional."

CHAPTER XII.

INVITATION.

As Wingfold walked back to his lodgings, he found a new element mingling with the varied matter
of his previous inquiry. Human suffering laid hold upon him--neither as his own nor as that
of humanity, but as that of men and women--known or unknown, it mattered nothing: there were
hearts in the world from whose agony broke terrible cries, hearts of which sad faces like that
of Miss Lingard were the exponents. Such hearts might be groaning and writhing in any of the
houses he passed, and, even if he knew the hearts, and what the vampire that sucked their blood,
he could do nothing for their relief.

Little indeed could he have imagined the life of such a comfort-guarded lady as Miss Lingard,
exposed to the intrusion of any terror-waking monster, from the old ocean of chaos, into the
quiet flow of its meadow-banked river! And what multitudes must there not be in the world--what
multitudes in our island--how many even in Glaston, whose hearts, lacerated by no remorse,
overwhelmed by no crushing sense of guilt, yet knew their own bitterness, and had no friend
radiant enough to make a sunshine in their shady places! He fell into mournful mood over the
troubles of his race. Always a kind-hearted fellow, he had not been used to think about such
things; he had had troubles of his own, and had got through at least some of them; people must
have troubles, else would they grow unendurable for pride and insolence. But now that he had
begun to hope he saw a glimmer somewhere afar at the end of the darksome cave in which he had
all at once discovered that he was buried alive, he began also to feel how wretched those must
be who were groping on without even a hope in their dark eyes.

If he had never committed any crime, he had yet done wrong enough to understand the misery
of shame and dishonour, and should he not find a loving human heart the heart of the world,
would rejoice--with what rejoicing might then be possible--to accept George Bascombe's theory,
and drop into the jaws of darkness and cease. How much more miserable then must those be who
had committed some terrible crime, or dearly loved one who had! What relief, what hope, what
lightening for them! What a breeding nest of vermiculate cares and pains was this human heart
of ours! Oh, surely it needed some refuge! If no saviour had yet come, the tortured world of
human hearts cried aloud for one with unutterable groaning! What would Bascombe do if he had
committed a murder? Or what could he do for one who had? If fable it were, it was at least
a need--invented one--that of a Saviour to whom anyone might go, at any moment, without a journey,
without letters or commendations or credentials! And yet no: if it had been invented, it could
hardly be by any one in the need, for such even now could hardly be brought to believe it.
Ill bested were the world indeed if there were no one beyond whose pardon crime could not go!
Ah! but where was the good of pardon if still the conscious crime kept stinging? and who would
wish one he loved to grow callous to the crime he had committed? Could one rejoice that his
guilty friend had learned to laugh again, able at length to banish the memory of the foul thing?
Would reviving self-content render him pleasant to the eyes, and his company precious in the
wisdom that springs from the knowledge of evil? Would not that be the moment when he who had
most assiduously sought to comfort him in his remorse, would first be tempted to withdraw his
foot from his threshold? But if there was a God--such a God as, according to the Christian
story, had sent his own son into the world--had given him to appear among us, clothed in the
garb of humanity, the armour that can be pierced, to take all the consequences of being the
god of obedience amongst the children of disobedience, engulfing their wrongs in his infinite
forbearance, and winning them back, by slow and unpromising and tedious renewal, to the heart
of his father, surely such a God would not have created them, knowing that some of them would
sin sins from the horror of which in themselves all his devotion could not redeem them!--And
as he thought thus, the words arose in his mind--"COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY
LADEN, AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST." His heart filled. He pondered over them. When he got home
he sought and found them in the book.--Did a man ever really utter them? If a man did, either
he was the most presumptuous of mortals, or HE COULD DO WHAT HE SAID. If he could, then to
have seen and distrusted that man, Wingfold felt, would have been to destroy in himself the
believing faculty and become incapable of trusting for ever after. And such a man must, in
virtue of his very innocence, know that the worst weariness and the worst load is evil and
crime, and must know himself able, in full righteousness, with no jugglery of oblivion or self-esteem,
to take off the heavy load and give rest.

"And yet," thought the curate, not without self-reproach, "for one who will go to him to get
the rest, a thousand will ask--HOW CAN HE THEN DO IT?--As if they should be fit to know!"

CHAPTER XIII.

A SERMON TO HELEN.

All the rest of the week his mind was full of thoughts like these, amid which ever arose the
suffering face of Helen Lingard, bringing with it the still strengthening suspicion that behind
it must lie some oppressive, perhaps terrible secret. But he made no slightest movement towards
the discovery of it, put not a single question in any direction for its confirmation or dissolution.
He would not look in at her windows, but what seeds of comfort he could find, he would scatter
wide, and hope that some of them might fall into her garden.

When he raised his head on the Sunday from kneeling, with heart honest, devout, and neighbourly,
in the pulpit before the sermon, and cast his eyes round his congregation, they rested first,
for one moment and no more, upon the same pallid and troubled countenance whose reflection
had so often of late looked out from the magic mirror of his memory; the next, they flitted
across the satisfied, healthy, handsome, clever face of her cousin, behind which plainly sat
a conscience well-to-do, in an easy chair; the third, they saw and fled the peevish autumnal
visage of Mrs. Ramshorn; the next, they roved a little, then rested on the draper's good-humoured
disc, on the white forehead of which brooded a cloud of thoughtfulness. Last of all they sought
the free seats, and found the faces of both the dwarfs. It was the first time he had seen Rachel's
there, and it struck him that it expressed greater suffering than he had read in it before.
She ought rather to be in bed than in church, he thought. But the same seemed the case with
her uncle's countenance also; and with that came the conclusion that the pulpit was a wonderful
watch-tower whence to study human nature; that people lay bare more of their real nature and
condition to the man in the pulpit than they know--even before the sermon. Their faces have
fallen into the shape of their minds, for the church has an isolating as well as congregating
power, and no passing emotion moulds them to an evanescent show. When Polwarth spoke to a friend,
the suffering melted in issuing radiance; when he sat thus quiescent, patient endurance was
the first thing to be read on his countenance. This flashed through the curate's mind in the
moments ere he began to speak, and with it came afresh the feeling--one that is, yet ought
not to be sad--that no one of all these hearts could give summer-weather to another. The tears
rose in his eyes as he gazed, and his heart swelled towards his own flesh and blood, as if
his spirit would break forth in a torrent of ministering tenderness and comfort. Then he made
haste to speak lest he should become unable. As usual his voice trembled at first, but rose
into strength as his earnestness found way. This is a good deal like what he said:

"The marvellous man who is reported to have appeared in Palestine, teaching and preaching,
seems to have suffered far more from sympathy with the inward sorrows of his race than from
pity for their bodily pains. These last, could he not have swept from the earth with a word?
and yet it seems to have been mostly, if not indeed always, only in answer to prayer that he
healed them, and that for the sake of some deeper, some spiritual healing that should go with
the bodily cure. It could not be for the dead man whom he was about to call from the tomb,
that his tears flowed. What source could they have but compassion and pitiful sympathy for
the sorrows of the dead man's sisters and friends who had not the inward joy that sustained
himself, and the thought of all the pains and heartaches of those that looked in the face of
death--the meanings of love--torn generations, the blackness of bereavement that had stormed
through the ever changing world of human hearts since first man had been made in the image
of his Father? Yet are there far more terrible troubles than this death--which I trust can
only part, not keep apart. There is the weight of conscious wrong being and wrong doing--that
is the gravestone that needs to be rolled away ere a man can rise to life. Call to mind how
Jesus used to forgive men's sins, thus lifting from their hearts the crushing load that paralyzed
all their efforts. Recall the tenderness with which he received those from whom the religious
of his day turned aside--the repentant women who wept sore-hearted from very love, the publicans
who knew they were despised because they were despicable. With him they sought and found shelter.
He was their saviour from the storm of human judgment and the biting frost of public opinion,
even when that opinion and that judgment were re-echoed by the justice of their own hearts.
He received them, and the life within them rose up, and the light shone--the conscious light
of light, despite even of shame and self-reproach. If God be for us who can be against us?
In his name they rose from the hell of their own hearts' condemnation, and went forth to do
the truth in strength and hope. They heard and believed and obeyed his words. And of all words
that ever were spoken, were ever words gentler, tenderer, humbler, lovelier--if true, or more
arrogant, man-degrading, God-defying--if false, than these, concerning which, as his, I now
desire to speak to you: 'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give
you rest.

"Surely these words, could they but be heartily believed, are such as every human heart might
gladly hear! What man is there who has not had, has not now, or will not have to class himself
amongst the weary and heavy-laden? Ye who call yourselves Christians profess to believe such
rest is to be had, yet how many of you go bowed to the very earth, and take no single step
towards him who says Come, lift not an eye to see whether a face of mercy may not be looking
down upon you! Is it that, after all, you do not believe there ever was such a man as they
call Jesus? That can hardly be. There are few so ignorant, or so wilfully illogical as to be
able to disbelieve in the existence of the man, or that he spoke words to this effect. Is it
then that you are doubtful concerning the whole import of his appearance? In that case, were
it but as a doubtful medicine, would it not be well to make some trial of the offer made? If
the man said the words, he must have at least believed that he could fulfil them. Who that
knows anything of him at all can for a moment hold that this man spoke what he did not believe?
The best of the Jews who yet do not believe in him, say of him that he was a good though mistaken
man. Will a man lie for the privilege of being despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows
and acquainted with grief? What but the confidence of truth could have sustained him when he
knew that even those who loved him would have left him had they believed what he told them
of his coming fate?--But then: believing what he said, might he not have been mistaken?--A
man can hardly be mistaken as to whether he is at peace or not--whether he has rest in his
soul or not. Neither I think can a man well be mistaken as to whence comes the peace he possesses,--as
to the well whence he draws his comfort. The miser knows his comfort is his gold. Was Jesus
likely to be mistaken when he supposed himself to know that his comfort came from his God?
Anyhow he believed that his peace came from his obedience--from his oneness with the will of
his Father. Friends, if I had such peace as was plainly his, should I not know well whence
it came?--But I think I hear some one say: 'Doubtless the good man derived comfort from the
thought of his Father, but might he not be mistaken in supposing there was any Father?' Hear
me, my friends: I dare not say I know there is a Father. I dare not even say I think, I can
only say with my whole heart I hope we have indeed a Father in heaven; but this man says HE
KNOWS. Am I to say he does not know? Can I, who know so much I would gladly have otherwise
in myself, imagine him less honest than I am? If he tells me he knows, I am dumb and listen.
One I KNOW: THERE IS--outweighs a whole creation of voices crying each I KNOW NOT, THEREFORE
THERE IS NOT. And observe it is his own, his own best he wants to give them--no bribe to obedience
to his will, but the assurance of bliss if they will do as he does. He wants them to have peace--HIS
peace--peace from the same source whence he has it. For what does he mean by TAKE MY YOKE UPON
YOU, AND LEARN OF ME? He does not mean WEAR THE YOKE I LAY UPON YOU, AND OBEY MY WORDS. I do
not say he might not have said so, or that he does not say what comes to the same thing at
other times, but that is not what he says here--that is not the truth he would convey in these
words. He means TAKE UPON YOU THE YOKE I WEAR; LEARN TO DO AS I DO, WHO SUBMIT EVERYTHING AND
REFER EVERYTHING TO THE WILL OF MY FATHER, YEA HAVE MY WILL ONLY IN THE CARRYING OUT OF HIS:
BE MEEK AND LOWLY IN HEART, AND YE SHALL FIND REST UNTO YOUR SOULS. With all the grief of humanity
in his heart, in the face of the death that awaited him, he yet says, FOR MY YOKE, THE YOKE
I WEAR, IS EASY, THE BURDEN I BEAR IS LIGHT. What made that yoke easy,--that burden light?
That it was the will of the Father. If a man answer: 'Any good man who believed in a God, might
say as much, and I do not see how it can help me;' my reply is, that this man says, COME UNTO
ME, AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST--asserting the power to give perfect help to him that comes.--Does
all this look far away, my friends, and very unlike the things about us? The things about you
do not give you peace; from something different you may hope to gain it. And do not our souls
themselves fall out with their surroundings, and cry for a nobler, better, more beautiful life?

"But some one will perhaps say: 'It is well; but were I meek and lowly in heart as he of whom
you speak, it could not touch MY trouble: that springs not from myself, but from one I love.'
I answer, if the peace be the peace of the Son of man, it must reach to every cause of unrest.
And if thou hadst it, would it not then be next door to thy friend? How shall he whom thou
lovest receive it the most readily--but through thee who lovest him? What if thy faith should
be the next step to his? Anyhow, if this peace be not an all-reaching as well as a heart-filling
peace; if it be not a righteous and a lovely peace, and that in despite of all surrounding
and opposing troubles, then it is not the peace of God, for that passeth all understanding:--so
at least say they who profess to know, and I desire to take them at their word. If thy trouble
be a trouble thy God cannot set right, then either thy God is not the true God, or there is
no true God, and the man who professed to reveal him led the one perfect life in virtue of
his faith in a falsehood. Alas for poor men and women and their aching hearts!--If it offend
any of you that I speak of Jesus as THE MAN who professed to reveal God, I answer, that the
man I see, and he draws me as with the strength of the adorable Truth; but if in him I should
certainly find the God for the lack of whose peace I and my brethren and sisters pine, then
were heaven itself too narrow to hold my exultation, for in God himself alone could my joy
find room.

"Come then, sore heart, and see whether his heart cannot heal thine. He knows what sighs and
tears are, and if he knew no sin in himself, the more pitiful must it have been to him to behold
the sighs and tears that guilt wrung from the tortured hearts of his brethren and sisters.
Brothers, sisters, we MUST get rid of this misery of ours. It is slaying us. It is turning
the fair earth into a hell, and our hearts into its fuel. There stands the man, who says he
knows: take him at his word. Go to him who says in the might of his eternal tenderness and
his human pity--COME UNTO ME, ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY-LADEN, AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST.

CHAPTER XIV.

A SERMON TO HIMSELF.

Long ere he thus came to a close, Wingfold was blind to all and every individuality before
him--felt only the general suffering of the human soul, and the new-born hope for it that lay
in the story of the ideal man, the human God. He did not see that Helen's head was down on
the book-board. She was sobbing convulsively. In some way the word had touched her, and had
unsealed the fountain of tears, if not of faith. Neither did he see the curl on the lip of
Bascombe, or the glance of annoyance which, every now and then, he cast upon the bent head
beside him. "What on earth are you crying about? It is all in the way of his business, you
know," said Bascombe's eyes, but Helen did not hear them. One or two more in the congregation
were weeping, and here and there shone a face in which the light seemed to prevent the tears.
Polwarth shone and Rachel wept. For the rest, the congregation listened only with varying degrees
of attention and indifference. The larger portion looked as if neither Wingfold nor any other
body ever meant anything--at least in the pulpit.

The moment Wingfold reached the vestry, he hurried off the garments of his profession, sped
from the Abbey, and all but ran across the church-yard to his lodging. There he shut himself
up in his chamber, fearful lest he should have said more than he had yet a right to say, and
lest ebbing emotion should uncover the fact that he had been but "fired by the running of his
own wheels," and not inspired by the guide of "the fiery-wheeled throne, the cherub Contemplation."
There, from the congregation, from the church, from the sermon, from the past altogether, he
turned aside his face and would forget them quite.

What had he to do with the thing that was done,--done with, and gone, either into the treasury
or the lumber-room, of creation? Towards the hills of help he turned his face--to the summits
over whose tops he looked for the dayspring from on high to break forth. If only Christ would
come to him!--Do what he might, however, his thoughts WOULD wander back to the great gothic
gulf into which he had been pouring out his soul, and the greater human gulfs that opened into
the ancient pile, whose mouths were the faces that hid the floor beneath them--until at length
he was altogether vexed with himself for being interested in what he had done, instead of absorbed
in what he had yet to do. He left therefore his chamber, and placed himself at a side-table
in his sitting-room, while his landlady prepared the other for his dinner. She too had been
at church that morning, whence it came that she moved about and set the things on the table
with unusual softness, causing him no interruption while he wrote down a line here and there
of what afterwards grew into the following verses--born in the effort to forget the things
that were behind, and reach forth after the things that lay before him.

    Yes, Master, when thou comest thou shalt find
        A little faith on earth, if I am here!
    Thou know'st how oft I turn to thee my mind,
        How sad I wait until thy face appear!

    Hast thou not ploughed my thorny ground full sore,
        And from it gathered many stones and sherds?
    Plough, plough and harrow till it needs no more--
        Then sow thy mustard-seed, and send thy birds.

    I love thee, Lord; and if I yield to fears,
        Nor trust with triumph that pale doubt defies,
    Remember, Lord, 'tis nigh two thousand years,
        And I have never seen thee with mine eyes.

    And when I lift them from the wondrous tale,
        See, all about me has so strange a show!
    Is that thy river running down the vale?
        Is that thy wind that through the pines doth blow?

    Couldst thou right verily appear again,
        The same who walked the paths of Palestine,
    And here in England teach thy trusting men,
        In church and field and house, with word and sign?

    Here are but lilies, sparrows, and the rest!--
        My hands on some dear proof would light and stay!
    But my heart sees John leaning on thy breast,
        And sends them forth to do what thou dost say.

CHAPTER XV.

CRITICISM.

"Extraordinary young man!" exclaimed Mrs. Ramshorn as they left the church, with a sigh that
expressed despair. "Is he an infidel or a fanatic? a Jesuit or a Socinian?"

"If he would pay a little more attention to his composition," said Bascombe indifferently,
"he might in time make of himself a good speaker. I am not at all sure there are not the elements
of an orator in him, if he would only reflect a little on the fine relations between speech
and passion, and learn of the best models how to play upon the feelings of a congregation.
I declare I don't know, but he might make a great man of himself. As long as he don't finish
his sentences however, jumbles his figures, and begins and ends abruptly without either exordium
or peroration, he needn't look to make anything of a preacher--and that seems his object."

"If that be his object, he had better join the Methodists at once. He would be a treasure to
them," said Mrs. Ramshorn.

"That is not his object, George. How can you say so?" remarked Helen quietly, but with some
latent indignation.

George smiled a rather unpleasant smile and held his peace.

Little more was said on the way home. Helen went to take off her bonnet, but did not re-appear
until she was called to their early Sunday dinner.

Now George had counted upon a turn in the garden with her before dinner, and was annoyed--more,
it is true, because of the emotion which he rightly judged the cause of her not joining him,
than the necessity laid on him of eating his dinner without having first unburdened his mind;
but the latter fact also had its share in vexing him.

When she came into the drawing-room it was plain she had been weeping; but, although they were
alone, and would probably have to wait yet a few minutes before their aunt joined them, he
resolved in his good nature to be considerate, and say nothing till after dinner, lest he should
spoil her appetite. When they rose from the table, she would have again escaped, but when George
left his wine and followed her, she consented, at his urgent, almost expostulatory request,
to walk once round the garden with him.

As soon as they were out of sight of the windows, he began--in the tone of one whose love it
is that prompts rebuke.

"How COULD you, my dear Helen, have so little care of your health, already so much shaken with
nursing your brother, as to yield your mind to the maundering of that silly ecclesiastic, and
allow his false eloquence to untune your nerves! Remember your health is the first thing--positively
the FIRST and foremost thing to be considered, both for your own sake and that of your friends.
Without health, what is anything worth?"

Helen made no answer, but she thought with herself there were two or three things for the sake
of which she would willingly part with a considerable portion of her health. Her cousin imagined
her conscience-stricken, and resumed with yet greater confidence.

"If you MUST go to church, you ought to prepare yourself beforehand by firmly impressing on
your mind the fact that the whole thing is but part of a system--part of a false system; that
the preacher has been brought up to the trade of religion, that it is his business, and that
he must lay himself out to persuade people--himself first of all if he can, but anyhow his
congregation, of the truth of everything contained in that farrago of priestly absurdities--
called the Bible, forsooth! as if there were no other book worthy to be mentioned beside it.
Think for a moment how soon, were it not for their churches and prayers and music and their
tomfoolery of preaching, the whole precious edifice would topple about their ears, and the
livelihood, the means of contentment and influence, would be gone from so many restless paltering
spirits! So what is left them but to play upon the hopes and fears and diseased consciences
of men as they best can! The idiot! To tell a man when he is hipped to COME UNTO ME! Bah! Does
the fool really expect any grown man or woman to believe in his or her brain that the man who
spoke those words, if ever there was a man who spoke them, can at this moment anni domini"--George
liked to be correct--"1870, hear whatever silly words the Rev. Mr. Wingfold, or any other human
biped, may think proper to address to him with his face buried in his blankets by his bedside
or in his surplice over the pulpit-bible?--not to mention that they would have you believe,
or be damned to all eternity, that every thought vibrated in the convolutions of your brain
is known to him as well as to yourself! The thing is really too absurd! Ha! ha! ha! The man
died--the death of a malefactor, they say; and his body was stolen from his grave by his followers,
that they might impose thousands of years of absurdity upon generations to come after them.
And now, when a fellow feels miserable, he is to cry to that dead man, who said of himself
that he was meek and lowly in heart, and straightway the poor beggar shall find rest to his
soul! All I can say is that, if he find rest so, it will be the rest of an idiot! Believe me,
Helen, a good Havannah and a bottle of claret would be considerably more to the purpose;--for
ladies, perhaps rather a cup of tea and a little Beethoven!" Here he laughed, for the rush
of his eloquence had swept away his bad humour. "But really," he went on, "the whole is TOO
absurd to talk about. To go whining after an old Jew fable in these days of progress! Why,
what do you think is the last discovery about light?"

"You will allow this much in excuse for their being so misled," returned Helen, with some bitterness,
"that the old fable pretends at least to provide help for sore hearts; and except it be vivisection,
I----"

"Do be serious, Helen," interrupted George. "I don't object to joking, you know, but you are
not joking in a right spirit. This matter has to do with the well-being of the race; and we
MUST think of others, however your Jew-gospel, in the genuine spirit of the Hebrew of all time,
would set everybody to the saving of his own wind-bubble of a soul. Believe me, to live for
others is the true way to lose sight of our own fancied sorrows."

Helen gave a deep sigh. Fancied sorrows!--Yes, gladly indeed would she live for ONE other at
least! Nay more--she would die for him. But alas! what would that do for one whose very being
was consumed with grief ineffable!--She must speak, else he would read her heart.

"There are real sorrows," she said. "They are not all fancied."

"There are very few sorrows," returned George, "in which fancy does not bear a stronger proportion
than even a woman of sense, while the fancy is upon her, will be prepared to admit. I can remember
bursts of grief when I was a boy, in which it seemed impossible anything should ever console
me; but in one minute all would be gone, and my heart, or my spleen, or my diaphragm, as merry
as ever. Believe that all is well, and you will find all will be well--very tolerably well,
that is, considering."

"Considering that the well-being has to be divided and apportioned and accommodated to the
various parts of such a huge whole, and that there is no God to look after the business!" said
Helen, who, according to the state of the tide in the sea of her trouble, resented or accepted
her cousin's teaching.

Few women are willing to believe in death. Most of them love life, and are faithful to hope;
and I much doubt whether, if Helen had but had a taste of trouble to rouse the woman within
her before her cousin conceived the wish of making her a proselyte, she would have turned even
a tolerably patient ear to his instructions. Yet it is strange to see how even noble women,
with the divine gift of imagination, may be argued into unbelief in their best instincts by
some small man, as common-place as clever, who beside them is as limestone to marble. The knowing
craft comes creeping up into the shadow of the rich galleon, and lo, with all her bountiful
sails gleaming in the sun, the ship of God glides off in the wake of the felucca to the sweltering
hollows betwixt the winds!

"You perplex me, my dear cousin," said Bascombe. "It is plain your nursing has been too much
for you. You see everything with a jaundiced eye."

"Thank you, Cousin George," said Helen. "You are even more courteous than usual."

She turned from him and went into the house. Bascombe walked to the bottom of the garden and
lighted his cigar, confessing to himself that for once he could not understand Helen.--Was
it then only that he was ignorant of the awful fact that lay burrowing in her heart, or was
he not ignorant also of the nature of that heart in which such a fact must so burrow? Was there
anything in his system to wipe off that burning, torturing red? "Such things must be: men who
wrong society must suffer for the sake of that society." But the red lay burning on the conscience
of Helen too, and she had not murdered! And for him who had, he gave society never a thought,
but shrieked aloud in his dreams, and moaned and wept when he waked over the memory of the
woman who had wronged him, and whom he had, if Bascombe was right, swept out of being like
an aphis from a rose-leaf.

CHAPTER XVI.

A VANISHING GLIMMER.

Helen ran upstairs, dropped on her knees by her brother's bedside, and fell into a fit of sobbing,
which no tears came to relieve.

"Helen! Helen! if you give way I shall go mad," said a voice of misery from the pillow.

She jumped up, wiping her dry eyes.

"What a wicked, selfish, bad sister, bad nurse, bad everything, I am, Poldie!" she said, her
tone ascending the steps of vocal indignation as she spoke. "But shall I tell you"--here she
looked all about the chamber and into the dressing-room ere she proceeded--"shall I tell you,
Poldie, what it is that makes me so-- I don't know what?--It is all the fault of the sermon
I heard this morning. It is the first sermon I ever really listened to in my life--certainly
the first I ever thought about again after I was out of the church. Somehow or other of late
Mr. Wingfold has been preaching so strangely! but this is the first time I have cared to listen.
Do you know he preaches as if he actually believed the things he was saying, and not only that,
but as if he expected to persuade you of them too! I USED to think all clergymen believed them,
but I doubt it now more than ever, for Mr. Wingfold speaks so differently and looks so different.
I never saw any clergyman look like that; and I never saw such a change on a man as there is
on him. There must be something to account for it. Could it be that he has himself really gone
to--as he says--and found rest--or something he hadn't got before? But you won't know what
I mean unless I tell you first what he was preaching about. His text was: Come unto me all
ye that labour and are heavy laden;--a common enough text, you know? Poldie! but somehow it
seemed fresh to him, and he made it look fresh to me, for I felt as if it hadn't been intended
for preaching about at all, but for going straight into people's hearts its own self, without
any sermon. I think the way he did it was this: he first made us feel the sort of person that
said the words, and then made us feel that he did say them, and so made us want to see what
they could really mean. But of course what made them so different to me, was"--here Helen did
burst into tears, but she fought with her sobs, and went on--"was--was--that my heart is breaking
for you, Poldie--for I shall never see you smile again, my darling!"

She buried her face on his pillow, and Leopold uttered "a great and exceeding bitter cry."
Her hand was on his mouth instantly, and her sobs ceased, while the tears kept flowing down
her white face.

"Just think, Poldie," she said, in a voice which she seemed to have borrowed in her need from
some one else, "--just think a moment! What if there should be some help in the great wide
universe--somewhere, for as wide as it is--a heart that feels for us both, as my heart feels
for you, Poldie! Oh! oh! wouldn't it be grand? Wouldn't it be lovely to be at peace again,
Poldie? If there should be somebody somewhere who could take this gnawing serpent from my heart!"--She
pulled wildly at her dress.--"'Come unto me,' he said, 'all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.' That's what he said:--oh! if it could be true!"

"Surely it is--for you, best of sisters," cried Leopold; "but what has it to do with me? Nothing.
She is DEAD--I killed her. Even if God were to raise her to life again, HE could not make it
that I didn't drive the knife into her heart! Give ME rest!--why there's the hand that did
it! O my God! my God!" cried the poor youth, and stared at his thin wasted hand, through which
the light shone red, as at a conscious evil thing that had done the deed, and was still stained
with its signs.

"God CAN'T be very angry with you, Poldie," sobbed Helen, feeling about blindly in the dark
forest of her thoughts for some herb of comfort, and offering any leaf upon which her hand
fell first.

"Then he ain't fit to be God!" cried Leopold fiercely. "I wouldn't have a word to say to a
God that didn't cut a man in pieces for such a deed! Oh Helen, she was so lovely!--and what
is she now?"

"Surely if there were a God, he would do something to set it right somehow! I know if I was
God, Poldie, I should find some way of setting you up again, my darling. You ain't half as
bad as you make yourself out."

"You had better tell that to the jury, Helen, and see how they will take it," said Leopold
contemptuously.

"The jury!" Helen almost screamed. "What do you mean, Poldie?"

"Well!" returned Leopold, in a tone of justification, but made no further answer to her question.
"All God can do to set it right," he resumed, after a pause, "is to damn me for ever and ever,
as one of the blackest creatures in creation."

"THAT I don't believe, anyhow!" returned Helen with equal vehemence and indefiniteness.

And for the first time, George Bascombe's teachings were a comfort to her. It was all nonsense
about a God. As to her brother's misery, it had no source but that to which Shakespeare attributed
the misery of Macbeth--and who should know better than Shakespeare?--the fear, namely, of people
doing the like to himself! But straightway thereupon--horrible thought!--she found herself--yes!
it was in her--call it thought, or call it feeling, it was hers!--she found herself despising
her poor crushed brother! disgusted with him! turning from him, not even in scorn of his weakness,
but in anger at what he had brought upon her! It was but a flash of the lightning of hell:
one glance of his great, troubled, appealing, yet hopeless eyes, vague with the fogs that steamed
up from the Phlegethon within him, was enough to turn her anger at him into hate of herself
who had stabbed his angel in her heart. Then in herself she knew that all murderers are not
of Macbeth's order, and that all remorse is not for oneself.

But where was the God to be found who could and MIGHT help in the wretched case? How were they
to approach him? Or what could he do for them? Were such a being to assure Leopold that no
hurt should come to him--even that he thought little of the wrong that he had done--would that
make his crushed heart begin to swell again with fresh life? would that bring back Emmeline
from the dark grave and the worms to the sunny earth and the speech of men? And whither, yet
farther, he might have sent her, she dared not think. And Leopold was not merely at strife
with himself, but condemned to dwell with a self that was loathsome to him. She no longer saw
any glimmer of hope but such as lay in George's doctrine of death. If there was no helper who
could clean hearts and revive the light of life, then welcome gaunt death! let the grim-mouthed
skeleton be crowned at every feast!

CHAPTER XVII.

LET US PRAY!

That was the sole chink in the prison where these two sat immured alone from their kind--unless,
indeed, the curate might know of another.

One thing Helen had ground for being certain of--that the curate would tell them no more than
he knew. Even George Bascombe, who did not believe one thing he said, counted him an honest
man! Might she venture to consult him, putting the case as of a person who had done very wrong--say
stolen money or committed forgery or something? Might she not thus gather a little honey of
comfort and bring it home to Leopold?

Thinking thus and thus she sat silent; and all the time the suffering eyes were fixed upon
her face, looking for no comfort, but finding there all they ever had of rest.

"Are you thinking about the sermon, Helen?" he asked. "What was it you were telling me about
it just now? Who preached it?"

"Mr. Wingfold," she answered listlessly.

"Who is Mr. Wingfold?"

"Our curate at the Abbey."

"What sort of man is he?"

"Oh, a man somewhere about thirty--a straightforward, ordinary kind of man."

"Ah!" said Leopld--then added after a moment--"I was hoping he might be an old man, with a
grey head, like the brahmin who used to teach me Sanscrit.--I wish I had treated him better,
poor old fellow! and learned a little more."

"What does it matter about Sanscrit? Why should you make troubles of trifles?" said Helen,
whose trials had at last begun to undermine her temper.

"It was not of the Sanscrit, but the moonshee I was thinking," answered Leopold mildly.

"You darling!" cried Helen, already repentant. But with the revulsion she felt that this state
of things could not long continue--she must either lose her senses, or turn into something
hateful to herself: the strain was more than she could bear. She MUST speak to somebody, and
she would try whether she could not approach the subject with Mr. Wingfold.

But how was she to see him? It would be awkward to call upon him at his lodgings, and she must
see him absolutely alone to dare a whisper of what was on her mind.

As she thus reflected, the thought of what people would say, were it remarked that she contrived
to meet the curate, brought a shadow of scorn upon her face. Leopold saw the expression, and,
sensitive as an ailing woman, said,

"Helen, what HAVE I done to make you look like that?"

"How did I look, my Poldie?" she asked, turning on him eyes like brimming wells of love and
tenderness.

"Let me see," answered Leopold; and after a moment's thought replied, "As Milton's Satan might
have looked if Mammon had counselled him to make off with the crown-jewels instead of declaring
war."

"Ah, Poldie!" cried Helen, delighted at the stray glance of sunshine, and kissing him as she
spoke, "you must really be better! I'll tell you what!" she exclaimed joyfully, as a new thought
struck her: "As soon as you are able, we will set out for New York--to pay Uncle Tom a visit
of course! but we shall never be seen or heard of again. At New York we will change our names,
cross to San Francisco, and from there sail for the Sandwich Islands. Perhaps we may be able
to find a little one to buy, just big enough for us two; and you shall marry a nice native----"

Her forced gaiety gave way. She burst out weeping afresh, and throwing her arms round him, sobbed--

"Poldie, Poldie! you can pray: cry to God to help us somehow or other; and if there be no God
to hear us, then let us die together. There are easy ways of it, Poldie."

"Thank you! thank you, sister dear!" he answered, pressing her to his bosom: "that is the first
word of real comfort you have spoken to me. I shall not be afraid if you go with me."

It was indeed a comfort to both of them to remember that there was this alternative equally
to the gallows and a long life of gnawing fear and remorse. But it was only to be a last refuge
of course. Helen withdrew to the dressing-room, laid herself on her bed, and began to compass
how to meet and circumvent the curate, so as by an innocent cunning to wile from him on false
pretences what spiritual balm she might so gain for the torn heart and conscience of her brother.
There was no doubt it would be genuine, and the best to be had, seeing George Bascombe, who
was honesty itself, judged the curate an honest man. But how was it to be done? She could see
only one way. With some inconsistency, she resolved to cast herself on his generosity, and
yet would not trust him entirely.

She did not go downstairs again, but had her tea with her brother. In the evening her aunt
went out to visit some of her pensioners, for it was one of Mrs. Ramshorn's clerical duties
to be kind to the poor--a good deal at their expense, I am afraid--and presently George came
to the door of the sick-room to beg her to go down and sing to him. Of course, in the house
of a dean's relict, no music except sacred must be heard on a Sunday; but to have Helen sing
it, George would condescend even to a hymn tune; and there was Handel, for whom he professed
a great admiration! What mattered his subjects? He could but compose the sort of thing the
court wanted of him, and in order to that, had to fuddle his brains first, poor fellow! So
said George at least.

That Leopold might not hear them talking outside his door, a thing which no invalid likes,
Helen went downstairs with her cousin; but although she had often sung from Handel for his
pleasure, content to reproduce the bare sounds, and caring nothing about the feelings both
they and the words represented, she positively refused this evening to gratify him. She must
go back to Leopold. She would sing from The Creation if he liked, but nothing out of The Messiah
would she or could she sing.

Perhaps she could herself hardly have told why, but George perceived the lingering influence
of the morning's sermon, and more vexed than he had ever yet been with her, for he could not
endure her to cherish the least prejudice in favour of what he despised, he said he would overtake
his aunt, and left the house. The moment he was gone, she went to the piano, and began to sing,
"Comfort ye." When she came to "Come unto me," she broke down. But with sudden resolution she
rose, and, having opened every door between it and her brother, raised the top of the piano,
and then sang, "Come unto me," as she had never sung in her life. Nor did she stop there. At
the distance of six of the wide-standing houses, her aunt and cousin heard her singing "Thou
didst not leave," with the tone and expression of a prophetess--of a Maenad, George said. She
was still singing when he opened the door, but when they reached the drawing-room she was gone.
She was kneeling beside her brother.

CHAPTER XVIII.

TWO LETTERS.

The next morning, as Wingfold ate his breakfast by an open window looking across the churchyard,
he received a letter by the local post. It was as follows:--

"Dear Mr. Wingfold, I am about to take an unheard-of liberty, but my reasons are such as make
me bold. The day may come when I shall be able to tell you them all. Meantime I hope you can
help me. I want very much to ask your counsel upon a certain matter, and I cannot beg you to
call, for my aunt knows nothing of it. Could you contrive a suitable way of meeting? You may
imagine my necessity is grievous when I thus expose myself to the possible bitterness of my
own after judgment. But I must have confidence in the man who spoke as you did yesterday morning.
I am, dear Mr. Wingfold, sincerely yours, Helen Lingard.

"P.S.--I shall be walking along Pine Street from our end, at eleven o'clock to-morrow."

The curate was not taken with a great surprise. But something like fear overshadowed him at
finding his sermons come back upon him thus. Was he, an unbelieving labourer, to go reaping
with his blunt and broken sickle where the corn was ripest! But he had no time to think about
that now. It was nearly ten o'clock, and she would be looking for her answer at eleven. He
had not to think long, however, before he saw what seemed a suitable plan to suggest; whereupon
he wrote as follows:

"Dear Miss Lingard, I need not say that I am entirely at your service. But I am doubtful if
the only way that occurs to me will commend itself to you. I know what I am about to propose
is safe, but you may not have sufficient confidence in my judgment to accept it as such.

"Doubtless you have seen the two deformed persons, an uncle and niece, named Polwarth, who
keep the gate of Osterfield Park. I know them well, and, strange as it may seem, I must tell
you, in order that you may partake of my confidence, that whatever change you may have observed
in my public work is owing to the influence of those two, who have more faith in God than I
have ever met with before. It may not be amiss to mention also that, although poor and distorted,
they are of gentle blood as well as noble nature. With this preamble, I venture to propose
that you should meet me at their cottage. To them it would not appear at all strange that one
of my congregation should wish to see me alone, and I know you may trust their discretion.
But while I write thus, with all confidence in you and in them, I must tell you that I have
none in myself. I feel both ashamed and perplexed that you should imagine any help in me. Of
all I know, I am the poorest creature to give counsel. All I can say for myself is that I think
I see a glimmer of light, and light is light, through whatever cranny, and into whatever poverty-stricken
chamber, it may fall. Whatever I see I will say. Powerfully than i had been other, it jeer, you.'you
have been make in plan. Him serve to wear it had to wingfold. You welcome me gasped with she shame

Yet she hesitated not a single moment in her ministrations.

There is so much passes in us of which our consciousness takes no grasp,--or but with such
a flitting touch as scarcely to hand it over to the memory--that I feel encouraged to doubt
whether ever there was a man absolutely without hope. That there have been, alas, are many,
who are aware of no ground of hope, nay even who feel no glimmer in them of anything they can
call hope, I know; but I think in them all is an underlying unconscious hope. I think that
not one in all the world has more than a shadowy notion of what hopelessness means. Perhaps
utter hopelessness is the outer darkness.

At length Leopold opened his eyes, gave a terrified glance around, held out his arms to her,
and drew her down upon his face.

"I saw her!" he said, in a voice that sounded as if it came from the grave, and she heard it
in her heart.

"Nonsense, dear Poldie! it was all fancy--nothing more," she returned, in a voice almost as
hollow as his; and the lightness of the words uttered in such a tone jarred dismayfully on
her own ear.

"Fancy!" he repeated; "I know what fancy is as well as any man or woman born: THAT was no fancy.
She stood there, by the wardrobe--in the same dress!--her face as white as her dress! And--listen!--I
will tell YOU--I will soon satisfy you it COULD be no fancy."--Here he pushed her from him
and looked straight in her eyes.--"I saw her back reflected in the mirror of the wardrobe-door,
and"--here the fixed look of horror threatened to return upon his face, but he went on--"listen,--there
was a worm crawling on it, over her lovely white shoulder! Ugh! I saw it in the mirror!"

His voice had risen to a strangled shriek, his face was distorted, and he shook like a child
on the point of yelling aloud in an agony of fear. Helen clasped his face between her hands,
and gathering courage from despair, if indeed that be a possible source of courage, and it
is not gathered rather from the hidden hope of which I speak, and the love that will cleave
and not forsake, she set her teeth, and said:

"Let her come then, Poldie! I am with you, and I defy her! She shall know that a sister's love
is stronger than the hate of a jilt--even if you did kill her. Before God, Poldie, I would
after all rather be you than she. Say what you will, she had herself to blame, and I don't
doubt did twenty worse things than you did when you killed her."

But Leopold seemed not to hear a word she said, and lay with his face to the wall.

At length he turned his head suddenly, and said,

"Helen, if you don't let me see Mr. Wingfold, I shall go mad, and then everything will come out."

CHAPTER XXIII.

COMPELLED CONFIDENCE.

Helen flew to the dressing-room to hide her dismay, and there cast herself on the bed. The
gray Fate above, or the awful Demo-gorgon beneath, would have its way! Whether it was a living
Will or but the shadow of the events it seemed to order, it was too much for her. She had no
choice but yield. She rose and returned to her brother.

"I am going to find Mr. Wingfold," she said in a hoarse voice, as she took her hat.

"Don't be long then, Helen," returned Leopold. "I can't bear you out of my sight. And don't
let aunt come into the room. SHE might come again, you know, and then all would be out.--Bring
him with you, Helen."

"I will," answered Helen, and went.

The curate might have returned: she would seek him first at his lodging. She cared nothing
about appearances now.

It was a dull afternoon. Clouds had gathered, and the wind was chilly. It seemed to blow out
of the church, which stood up cold and gray against the sky, filling the end of the street.
What a wretched, horrible world it was! She approached the church, and entered the churchyard
from which it rose like a rock from the Dead Sea--a type of the true church, around whose walls
lie the dead bodies of the old selves left behind by those who enter. Helen would have envied
the dead, who lay so still under its waves; but, alas! if Leopold was right, they but roamed
elsewhere in their trouble, and were no better for dying.

She hurried across, and reached the house; but Mr. Wingfold had not yet returned, and she hurried
back across it again, to tell Leopold that she must go farther to find him.

The poor youth was already more composed. What will not the vaguest hope sometimes do for a
man! Helen told him she had seen the curate in the park, when she was out in the morning, and
he might be there still, or she might meet him coming back. Leopold only begged her to make
haste. She took the road to the lodge.

She did not meet him, and it was with intense repugnance that she approached the gate.

"Is Mr. Wingfold here?" she asked of Rachel, as if she had never spoken to her before; and
Rachel, turning paler at the sight of her, answered that he was in the garden with her uncle,
and went to call him.

The moment he appeared she said, in a tone rendered by conflicting emotions inexplicable, and
sounding almost rude,

"Will you come to my brother? He is very ill, and wants to see you."

"Certainly," returned Wingfold; "I will go with you at once."

But in his heart he trembled at the thought of being looked to for consolation and counsel,
and that apparently in a case of no ordinary kind. Most likely he would not know what to say,
or how to behave himself! How different it would be if with all his heart he believed the grand
lovely things recorded in the book of his profession! Then indeed he might enter the chambers
of pain and fear and guilt with the innocent confidence of a winged angel of comfort and healing!
But now the eyes of his understanding were blinded with the IFS and BUTS that flew swarming
like black muscae wherever they turned. Still he would--nay, he must go and do his best.

They walked across the park to reach the house by the garden, and for some distance they walked
in silence. At length Helen said:

"You must not encourage my brother to talk much, if you please; and you must not mind what
he says; he has had brain-fever, and sometimes talks strangely. But on the other hand, if he
fancy you don't believe him, it will drive him wild--so you must take care-- please."

Her voice was like that of a soul trying to speak with unproved lips.

"Miss Lingard," said Wingfold, slowly and quietly--and if his voice trembled, he only was aware
of it, "I cannot see your face, therefore you must pardon me if I ask you--are you quite honest
with me?"

Helen's first feeling was anger. She held her peace for a time. Then she said,

"So, Mr. Wingfold!--that is the way you help the helpless!"

"How can any man help without knowing what has to be helped?" returned the curate. "The very
being of his help depends upon his knowing the truth. It is very plain you do not trust me,
and equally impossible I should be of any service as long as the case is such."

Again Helen held her peace. Resentment and dislike towards himself combined with terror of
his anticipated counsel to render her speechless.

Her silence lasted so long that Wingfold came to the resolution of making a venture that had
occurred to him more than once that morning. Had he not been convinced that a soul was in dire
misery, he would not have had recourse to the seeming cruelty.

"Would this help to satisfy you that, whatever my advice may be worth, at least my discretion
may be trusted?" he said.

They were at the moment passing through a little thicket in the park, where nobody could see
them, and as he spoke, he took the knife-sheath from his pocket, and held it out to her.

She started like a young horse at something dead: she had never seen it, but the shape had
an association. She paled, retreated a step, with a drawing back of her head and neck and a
spreading of her nostrils, stared for a moment, first at the sheath, then at the curate, gave
a little moan, bit her under lip hard, held out her hand, but as if she were afraid to touch
the thing, and said:

"What is it? Where did you find it?"

She would have taken it, but Wingfold held it fast.

"Give it me," she said imperatively. "It is mine. I lost it."

"There is something dark on the lining of it," said the curate, and looked straight into her eyes.

She let go her hold. But almost the same moment she snatched the sheath out of his hand and
held it to her bosom, while her look of terror changed into one of defiance. Wingfold made
no attempt to recover it. She put it in her pocket, and drew herself up.

"What do you mean?" she said, in a voice that was hard yet trembled.

She felt like one that sees the vultures gathering above him, and lifts a moveable finger in
defence. Then with sudden haughtiness both of gesture and word:

"You have been acting the spy, sir!"

"No," returned the curate quietly. "The sheath was committed to my care by one whom certain
facts that had come to his knowledge-- certain words he had overheard--"

He paused. She shook visibly, but still would hold what ground might yet be left her.

"Why did you not give it me before?" she asked.

"In the public street, or in your aunt's presence?"

"You are cruel!" she panted. Her strength was going. "What do you know?"

"Nothing so well as that I want to serve you, and you may trust me."

"What do you mean to do?"

"My best to help you and your brother."

"But to what end?"

"To any end that is right."

"But how? What would you tell him to do?"

"You must help me to discover what he ought to do."

"Not--" she cried, clasping her hands and dropping on her knees before him, "--you WILL not
tell him to give himself up? Promise me you will not, and I will tell you everything. '.'', though?',

 She turned the handle softly and
peeped in: could it be that Wingfold's bearing had communicated to her mind a shadow of the
awe with which he had left the place where perhaps a soul was being born again? Leopold did
not move. Terror laid hold of her heart. She stepped quickly in, and round the screen to the
side of the bed. There, to her glad surprise, he lay fast asleep, with the tears not yet dried
upon his face. Her heart swelled with some sense unknown before: was it rudimentary thankfulness
to the Father of her spirit?

As she stood gazing with the look of a mother over her sick child, he lifted his eyelids, and
smiled a sad smile.

"When did you come into the room?" he said.

"A minute ago," she answered.

"I did not hear you," he returned.

"No, you were asleep."

"Not I! Mr. Wingfold is only just gone."

"I have let him out on the meadow since."

Leopold stared, looked half alarmed, and then said,

"Did God make me sleep, Helen?"

She did not answer. The light of a new hope in his eye, as if the dawn had begun at last to
break over the dark mountains, was already reflected from her heart.

"Oh! Helen," he said, "that IS a good fellow, SUCH a good fellow!"

A pang of jealousy, the first she had ever felt, shot to her heart: she had hitherto, since
his trouble, been all in all to her Leopold! Had the curate been a man she liked, she would
not perhaps have minded it so much.

"You will be able to do without me now," she said sadly. "I never could understand taking to
people at first sight!"

"Some people are made so, I suppose, Helen. I know I took to you at first sight! I shall never
forget the first time I saw you--when I came to this country a lonely little foreigner,--and
you, a great beautiful lady, for such you seemed to me, though you have told me since you were
only a great gawky girl--I know that could never have been--you ran to meet me, and took me
in your arms, and kissed me. I was as if I had crossed the sea of death and found paradise
in your bosom! I am not likely to forget you for Mr. Wingfold, good and kind and strong as
he is! Even SHE could not make me forget you, Helen. But neither you nor I can do without Mr.
Wingfold any more, I fancy. I wish you liked him better!--but you will in time. You see he's
not one to pay young ladies compliments, as I have heard some parsons do; and he may be a little--no,
not unpolished, not that--that's not what I mean--but unornamental in his manners! Only, you
see,--"

"Only, you see, Poldie," interrupted Helen, with a smile, a rare thing between them, "you know
all about him, though you never saw him before."

"That is true," returned Leopold; "but then he came to me with his door open, and let me walk
in. It doesn't take long to know a man then. He hasn't got a secret like us, Helen," he added,
sadly.

"What did he say to you?"

"Much what he said to you from the pulpit the other day, I should think."

Then she was right! For all his hardness and want of sympathy, the curate had yet had regard
to her entreaties, and was not going to put any horrid notions about duty and self-sacrifice
into the poor boy's head!

"He's coming again to-morrow," added Leopold, almost gleefully, "and then perhaps he will tell
me more, and help me on a bit!"

"Did he tell you he wants to bring a friend with him?"

"No."

"I can't see the good of taking more people into our confidence."

"Why should he not do what he thinks best, Helen? You don't interfere with the doctor--why
should you with him? When a man is going to the bottom as fast as he can, and another comes
diving after him--it isn't for me to say how he is to take hold of me. No, Helen; when I trust,
I trust out and out."

Helen sighed, thinking how ill that had worked with Emmeline.

Ever since George Bascombe had talked about the Polwarths that day they met him in the park,
she had felt a sort of physical horror of them, as if they were some kind of unclean creature
that ought not to be in existence at all. But when Leopold uttered himself thus, she felt that
the current of events had seized her, and that she could only submit to be carried along.

CHAPTER XXVII.

DIVINE SERVICE.

The next day the curate called again on Leopold. But Helen happened to be otherwise engaged
for a few minutes, and Mrs. Ramshorn to be in the sick-room when the servant brought his name.
With her jealousy of Wingfold's teaching, she would not have admitted him, but Lingard made
such loud protest when he heard her say "Not at home," insisting on seeing him, that she had
to give way, and tell the maid to show him up. She HAD NO NOTION however of leaving him alone
in the room with the invalid: who could tell what absurd and extravagant ideas he might not
put into the boy's head! He might make him turn monk, or Socinian, or latter-day-saint, for
what she knew! So she sat, blocking up the sole small window in the youth's dark dwelling that
looked eastward, and damming back the tide of the dawn from his diseased and tormented soul.
Little conversation was therefore possible. Still the face of his new friend was a comfort
to Leopold, and ere he left him they had managed to fix an hour for next day, when they would
not be thus foiled of their talk.

That same afternoon, Wingfold took the draper to see Polwarth.

Rachel was lying on the sofa in the parlour--a poor little heap, looking more like a grave
disturbed by efforts at a resurrection, than a form informed with humanity. But she was cheerful
and cordial, receiving Mr. Drew and accepted his sympathy most kindly.

"We'll see what God will do for me," she said in answer to a word from the curate. Her whole
bearing, now as always, was that of one who perfectly trusted a supreme spirit under whose
influences lay even the rugged material of her deformed dwelling.

Polwarth allowed Wingfold to help him in getting tea, and the conversation, as will be the
case where all are in earnest, quickly found the right channel.

It is not often in real life that such conversations occur. Generally, in any talk worth calling
conversation, every man has some point to maintain, and his object is to justify his own thesis
and disprove his neighbour's. I will allow that he may primarily have adopted his thesis because
of some sign of truth in it, but his mode of supporting it is generally such as to block up
every cranny in his soul at which more truth might enter. In the present case, unusual as it
is for so many as three truth-loving men to come thus together on the face of this planet,
here were three simply set on uttering truth they had seen, and gaining sight of truth as yet
veiled from them.

I shall attempt only a general impression of the result of their evening's intercourse, partly
recording the utterances of Polwarth.

"I have been trying hard to follow you, Mr. Polwarth," said the draper, after his host had
for a while had the talk to himself, "but I cannot get a hold of your remarks. One moment I
think I have got the end of the clew, and the next find myself all abroad again. Would you
tell me what you mean by divine service, for I think you must use the phrase in some different
sense from what I have been accustomed to?"

"Ah! I ought to remember," said Polwarth, "that what has grown familiar to my mind from much
solitary thinking, may not at once show itself to another, when presented in the forms of a
foreign individuality. I ought to have premised that, when I use the phrase, DIVINE SERVICE,
I mean nothing whatever belonging to the church, or its observances. I mean by it what it ought
to mean--the serving of God--the doing of something for God. Shall I make of the church in
my foolish imaginations a temple of idolatrous worship by supposing that it is for the sake
of supplying some need that God has, or of gratifying some taste in him, that I there listen
to his word, say prayers to him, and sing his praises? Shall I be such a dull mule in the presence
of the living Truth? Or, to use a homely simile, shall I be as the good boy of the nursery
rhyme, who, seated in his corner of selfish complacency, regards the eating of his pie as a
virtuous action, enjoys the contemplation of it, and thinks what a pleasant object he thus
makes of himself to his parents? Shall I, to take a step farther, degrade the sanctity of the
closet, hallowed in the words of Jesus, by shutting its door in the vain fancy of there doing
something that God requires of me as a sacred OBSERVANCE? Shall I foolishly imagine that to
put in exercise the highest and loveliest, the most entrancing privilege of existence, that
of pouring forth my whole heart into the heart of him who is ACCOUNTABLE FOR me, who hath glorified
me with his own image--in my soul, gentlemen, sadly disfigured as it is in my body!--shall
I say that THAT is to do anything for God? Was I serving my father when I ate the dinner he
provided for me? Am I serving my God when I eat his bread and drink his wine?"

"But," said Drew, "is not God pleased that a man should pour out his soul to him?"

"Yes, doubtless; but what would you think of a child who said, 'I am very useful to my father,
for when I ask him for anything, or tell him I love him, it gives him--oh, such pleasure!'?"

"I should say he was an unendurable prig. Better he had to be whipped for stealing!" said the
curate.

"There would be more hope of his future," returned Polwarth. "--Is the child," he continued,
"who sits by his father's knee and looks up into his father's face, SERVING that father, because
the heart of the father delights to look down upon his child? And shall the moment of my deepest
repose and bliss, the moment when I serve myself with the very life of the universe, be called
a serving of my God? It is communion with God; he holds it with me, else never could I hold
it with him. I am as the foam-froth upon his infinite ocean, but of the water of the ocean
is the bubble on its waves."

Not the eyes only, but the whole face of the man, which had grown of a pure, semi-transparent
whiteness, appeared to Wingfold to emit light.

"When my child would serve me," he went on," he spies out some need I have, springs from his
seat at my knee, finds that which will meet my necessity, and is my eager, happy servant, of
consequence in his own eyes inasmuch as he has done something for his father. His seat by my
knee is love, delight, well-being, peace--not service, however pleasing in my eyes.--'Why do
you seat yourself at my knee, my son?' 'To please you, father.' 'Nay then, my son! go from
me, and come again when it shall be to please thyself.'--'Why do you cling to my chair, my
daughter? 'Because I want to be near you, father. It makes me so happy!' 'Come nearer still--come
to my bosom, my child, and be yet happier.'--Talk not of public worship as divine service;
it is a mockery. Search the prophets and you will find the observances, fasts and sacrifices
and solemn feasts, of the temple by them regarded with loathing and scorn, just because by
the people they were regarded as DIVINE SERVICE."

"But," said Mr. Drew, while Wingfold turned towards him with some anxiety lest he should break
the mood of the little prophet, "I can't help thinking I have you! for how are poor creatures
like us--weak, blundering creatures, sometimes most awkward when best-intentioned--how are
we to minister to a perfect God--perfect in wisdom, strength, and everything--of whom Paul
says that he is not worshipped with men's hands as though he needed anything? I cannot help
thinking that you are fighting merely with a word. Certainly, if the phrase ever was used in
that sense, there is no meaning of the kind attached to it now: it stands merely for the forms
of public worship."

"Were there no such thing as Divine Service in the true sense of the word, then, indeed it
would scarcely be worth while to quarrel with its misapplication. But I assert that true and
genuine service may be rendered to the living God; and, for the development of the divine nature
in man, it is necessary that he should do something for God. Nor is it hard to discover how;
for God is in every creature that he has made, and in their needs he is needy, and in all their
afflictions he is afflicted. Therefore Jesus says that whatever is done to one of his little
ones is done to him. And if the soul of a man be the temple of the Spirit, then is the place
of that man's labour, his shop, his counting-house, his laboratory, the temple of Jesus Christ,
where the spirit of the man is incarnate in work.--Mr. Drew!"--Here the gate-keeper stood up,
and held out both his hands, palms upward, towards the draper on the other side of the table.--"Mr.
Drew! your shop is the temple of your service where the Lord Christ, the only image of the
Father is, or ought to be throned; your counter is, or ought to be his altar; and everything
thereon laid, with intent of doing as well as you can for your neighbour, in the name of THE
man Christ Jesus, is a true sacrifice offered to Him, a service done to the eternal creating
Love of the universe."

The little prophet's head as he stood, did not reach the level of the draper's as he sat, but
at this Drew dropped his head on his hands upon the table, as if bowed down by a weight of
thought and feeling and worship.

"I say not," Polwarth went on, "that so doing you will grow a rich man, but I say that so doing
you will be saved from growing too rich, and that you will be a fellow-worker with God for
the salvation of his world."

"I must live; I cannot give my goods away!" murmured Mr. Drew, thinkingly, as one that sought
enlightenment.

"That would be to go direct against the order of his world, "said Polwarth." No; a harder task
is yours, Mr. Drew--to make your business a gain to you, and at the same time to be not only
what is commonly counted just, but interested in, and careful of, and caring for your neighbour,
as a servant of the God of bounty who giveth to all men liberally. Your calling is to do the
best for your neighbour that you reasonably can."

"But who is to fix what is reasonable?" asked Drew.

"The man himself, thinking in the presence of Jesus Christ. There is a holy moderation which
is of God."

"There won't be many fortunes--great fortunes--made after that rule, Mr. Polwarth."

"Very few."

"Then do you say that no great fortunes have been righteously made?"

"If RIGHTEOUSLY means AFTER THE FASHION OF JESUS CHRIST.--But I will not judge: that is for
the God-enlightened conscience of the man himself to do--not for his neighbour's. Why should
I be judged by another man's conscience?--But you see, Mr. Drew,--and this is what I was driving
at--that you have it in your power to SERVE God, through the needs of his children, all the
working day, from morning to night, so long as there is a customer in your shop."

"I do think you are right, sir," said the linen-draper. "I had a glimpse of the same thing
the other night myself. And yet it seems as if you spoke of a purely ideal state--one that
could not be realised in this world."

"Purely ideal or not, one thing is certain: it will never be reached by one who is so indifferent
to it as to believe it impossible. Whether it may be reached in this world or not, that is
a question of NO consequence; whether a man has begun to REACH AFTER it, is of the utmost awfulness
of import. And should it be ideal, which I doubt, what else than the ideal have the followers
of the ideal man to do with?"

"Can a man reach anything ideal before he has God dwelling in him--filling every cranny of
his soul?" asked the curate with shining eyes.

"Nothing, I do most solemnly believe," answered Polwarth. "It weighs on me heavily sometimes,"
he resumed, after a pause, "to think how far all but a few are from being able even to entertain
the idea of the indwelling in them of the original power of their life. True, God is in every
man, else how could he live the life he does live? but that life God keeps alive for the hour
when he shall inform the will, the aspiration, the imagination of the man. When the man throws
wide his door to the Father of his spirit, when his individual being is thus supplemented--to
use a poor miserable word--with the individuality that originated it, then is the man a whole,
healthy, complete existence. Then indeed, and then only, will he do no wrong, think no wrong,
love perfectly, and be right merry. Then will he scarce think of praying, because God is in
every thought and enters anew with every sensation. Then will he forgive, and endure, and pour
out his soul for the beloved who yet grope their way in doubt and passion. Then every man will
be dear and precious to him, even the worst, for in him also lies an unknown yearning after
the same peace wherein he rests and loves."

He sat down suddenly, and a deep silence filled the room.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

A SHOP IN HEAVEN.

"Uncle," said Rachel, "may I read your visions of the shops in heaven?"

"Oh no, Rachel. You are not able to read to-night," said her uncle deprecatingly.

"I think I am, uncle. I should like to try. It will let the gentlemen see what you WOULD think
an ideal state of things.--It is something, Mr. Wingfold, my uncle once dictated to me, and
I wrote down just as he said it. He can always do better dictating than writing, but this time
he was so ill with asthma that he could not talk much faster than I could write; and yet to
be so ill I never saw him show so little suffering; his thinking seemed to make him forget
it.--Mayn't I read it, uncle? I know the gentlemen would like to hear it."

"That we should," said both men at once.

"I will fetch it you then," said Polwarth, "if you will tell me where to find it."

Rachel gave him the needful directions, and presently he brought a few sheets of paper, and
handed them to her.

"This is no dream, Mr. Wingfold," he said. "It is something I thought fairly out before I began
to dictate it. But the only fit form I could find for it was that of a vision--like the Vision
of Mirza, you know.--Now read, Rachel, and I will hold my tongue."

After a little arranging of the sheets, Rachel began. She read not without difficulty, but
her pleasure in what she read helped her through.

"'And now, said my guide to me, I will bring thee to a city of the righteous, and show thee
how they buy and sell in this the kingdom of heaven. So we journeyed a day and another day
and half a day, and I was weary ere we arrived thither. But when I saw the loveliness of the
place, and drew in the healing air thereof, my weariness vanished as a dream of the night,
and I said, IT IS WELL.--I may not now speak of the houses and the dress and the customs of
the dwellers therein, save what may belong to the buying and selling of which I have spoken.
Gladly would I tell of the streams that went, some noiselessly gliding, others gurgling, some
sweeping, some rushing and roaring, through every street, all issuing from one right plenteous
fountain in the middle of the city, so that the ear was for ever filled with the sound of many
waters all the day, ceasing when the night came, that silence might have its perfect work upon
the soul. Gladly too would I tell of the trees and flowers and grass that grew in every street
along the banks of the rivers. But I must withhold.

"'After I had, I know not for how long, refreshed my soul with what it was thus given, me to
enjoy,--for in all that country there is no such thing as haste, no darting from one thing
to another, but a calm eternal progress in which unto the day the good thereof is sufficient--one
great noon-day, my conductor led me into a large place, such as we would call a shop here,
although the arrangements were different, and an air of stateliness dwelt in and around the
house. It was filled with the loveliest silken and woollen stuffs, of all kinds and colours,
a thousand delights to the eye--and to the thought also, for here was endless harmony, and
no discord.

"'I stood in the midst, and my guide stood by me in silence; for all the time I was in the
country, he seldom spoke to me save when first I asked of him, and yet he never showed any
weariness, and often a half-smile would dwell for a moment upon his countenance.

"'And first I watched the faces of them that sold; and I could read therein--for be it understood
that, according to the degree of his own capacity, a man there could perfectly read the countenance
of every neighbour, that is, unless it expressed something that was not in himself--and I could
read in them nothing of eagerness, only the calm of a concentrated ministration. There was
no seeking there, but a strength of giving, a business-like earnestness to supply lack, enlivened
by no haste, and dulled by no weariness, brightened ever by the reflected content of those
who found their wants supplied. As soon as one buyer was contented they turned graciously to
another, and gave ear until they perfectly understood with what object he had come to seek
their aid. Nor did their countenances change utterly as they turned away, for upon them lingered
the satisfaction as of one who hath had a success, and by degrees melted into the supervening
content.

"'Then I turned to watch the countenances of them that bought.--And there in like manner I
saw no cupidity and no meanness. They spake humbly, yet not because they sought a favour, but
because they were humble, for with their humility was mingled the confidence of receiving that
they sought. And truly it was a pleasure to see how everyone knew what his desire was, making
his choice readily and with decision. I perceived also that everyone spoke not merely respectfully,
but gratefully, to him who served him. And at meeting and parting such kindly though brief
greetings passed as made me wonder whether every inhabitant of such a mighty city could know
every other that dwelt therein. But I soon saw that it came not of individual knowledge, but
of universal faith and all-embracing love.

"'And as I stood and watched, suddenly it came into my mind that I had never yet seen the coin
of the country, and thereupon I kept my eyes upon a certain woman who bought silk, that when
she paid for the same I might see the money. But that which she had largely bought she took
in her arms and carried away, and paid not. Therefore I turned to watch another, who bought
for a long journey, but when he carried away that he bought, neither did he pay any money.
And I said to myself, These are well-known persons, to whom it is more convenient to pay all
at a certain season; and I turned to a third who bought much fine linen. But behold! he paid
not. Then I began to observe again those that sold; whereupon I thought with myself, How good
must be the air of this land for the remembrance of things! for these men write down nothing
to keep on record the moneys men owe them on all sides. And I looked and looked again and yet
again, and stood long watching--but so it was throughout the whole place, which thronged and
buzzed and swarmed like the busiest of bee-hives--no man paid, and no man had a book wherein
to write that which the other owed!

"'Then I turned to my guide and said: How lovely is honesty! and truly from what a labour it
absolveth men! for here I see every man keepeth in his mind his own debts, and not the debts
of others, so that time is not spent in paying of small sums, neither in the keeping of account
of such; but he that buyeth counteth up, and doubtless when the day of reckoning arrives, each
cometh and casteth the money he oweth into the merchant's coffer, and both are satisfied.

"'Then my conductor smiled, and said, Watch yet a while.

"'And I did as he said unto me, and stood and watched. But the same thing went on everywhere;
and I said to myself, Lo, I see nothing new!--Suddenly, at my side, a man dropped upon his
knees, and bowed his head to the ground. And those that stood nigh him dropped also upon their
knees, and there arose a sound as of soft thunder; and lo! everyone in the place had dropped
upon his knees, and spread his hands out before him. Every voice and every noise was hushed,
every movement had ceased, and I and my guide alone were left standing.

"'Then I whispered in his ear, It is the hour of prayer: shall we not kneel also? And my guide
answered, No man in this city kneeleth because others do, and no man is judged if he kneeleth
not. If thou hast any grief or pain upon thee, then kneel; if not, then love God in thy heart
and be thankful, and kneel when thou goest into thy chamber. Then said I, I will not kneel,
but will watch and see.--It is well, said my guide; and I stood.

"'For certain moments all was utter stillness--every man and woman kneeling, with hands outstretched,
save him who had first kneeled, and his hands hung by his sides and his head was still bowed
to the earth. At length he rose up, and lo! his face was wet with tears; and all the people
rose also, and with a noise throughout the place; and the man made a low obeisance to them
that were nigh him, the which they returned with equal reverence, and then with downcast eyes
he walked slowly from the shop. The moment he was gone, the business of the place, without
a word of remark on any side concerning what had passed, began again and went on as before.
People came and went, some more eager and outward, some more staid and inward, but all contented
and cheerful. At length a bell somewhere rang sweet and shrill, and after that no one entered
the place, and what was in progress began to be led to a decorous conclusion. In three or four
minutes the floor was empty, and the people also of the shop had gone, each about his own affairs,
without shutting door or window.

"'I went out last with my guide, and we seated ourselves under a tree of the willow-kind on
the bank of one of the quieter streams, and straightway I began to question him. Tell me, sir,
I said, the purport of what I have seen, for not yet have I understood how these happy people
do their business and pass from hand to hand not a single coin I And he answered, Where greed
and ambition and self-love rule, money must be: where there is neither greed nor ambition nor
self-love, money is needless. And I asked, Is it then by the same ancient mode of barter that
they go about their affairs? Truly I saw no exchange of any sort.--Bethink thee, said my guide,
if thou hadst gone into any other shop throughout the whole city, thou wouldst have seen the
same thing. I see not how that should make the matter plainer to me, I answered.--Where neither
greed nor ambition nor selfishness reigneth, said my guide, there need and desire have free
scope, for they work no evil.--But even now I understand you not, sir, I said.--Hear me then,
answered my guide, for I will speak to thee more plainly. Wherefore do men take money in their
hands when they go where things are?--Because they may not have the things without giving the
money.--And where they may have things without giving money, there they take no money in their
hands?--Truly no, sir, if there be such a place.--Then such a place is this, and so is it here.--But
how can men give of their goods and receive nought in return?--By receiving everything in return.
Tell me, said my guide, why do men take money for their goods?--That they may have wherewithal
to go and buy other things which they need for themselves.--But if they also may go to this
place or that place where the things are the which they need, and receive of those things without
money and without price, is there then good cause why they should take money in their hands?--Truly
no, I answered; and I begin, methinks, to see how the affair goeth. Yet are there some things
still whereupon I would gladly be resolved. And first of all, how cometh it that men are moved
to provide these and those goods for the supply of the wants of their neighbours, when they
are drawn thereto by no want in themselves, and no advantage to themselves?--Thou reasonest,
said my guide, as one of thine own degree, who to the eyes of the full-born ever look like
chrysalids, closed round in a web of their own weaving; and who shall blame thee until thou
thyself shinest within thyself? Understand that it is never advantage to himself that moveth
a man in this kingdom to undertake this or that. The thing that alone advantageth a man here
is the thing which he doth without thought unto that advantage. To your world, this world goeth
by contraries. The man here that doeth most service, that aideth others the most to the obtaining
of their honest desires, is the man who standeth highest with the Lord of the place, and his
reward and honour is, to be enabled to the spending of himself yet more for the good of his
fellows. There goeth a rumour amongst us even now that one shall ere long be ripe for the carrying
of a message from the King to the spirits that are in prison. Thinkest thou it is a less potent
stirring up of thought and energy to desire and seek and find the things that will please the
eye, and cheer the brain, and gladden the heart of the people of this great city, so that when
one prayeth, 'Give me, friend, of thy loaves,' a man may answer, 'Take of them, friend, as
many as thou needest'--is that, I say, an incentive to diligence less potent than the desire
to hoard or to excel? Is it not to share the bliss of God who hoardeth nothing, but ever giveth
liberally? The joy of a man here is to enable another to lay hold upon that which is of his
own kind and be glad and grow thereby--doctrine strange and unbelievable to the man in whom
the well of life is yet sealed. Never have they been many at a time in the old world who could
thus enter into the joy of their Lord. And yet, if thou bethink thee, thou wilt perceive that
such bliss is not unknown amongst thy fellows. Knowest thou no musician who would find it joy
enough for a night, to scale the tower of a hundred bells, and send the great meteors of music-light
flying over the care-tortured city? Would everyone even of thy half-created race reason with
himself and say: Truly it is in the night, and no one can see who it is that ministereth; the
sounds alone will go forth nor bear my image; I shall reap no honour; I will not rise and go?
Thou knowest, I say, some in thy world who would not speak thus in their hearts, but would
willingly consent to be as nothing, so to give life to their fellows. In this city so is it
with all--in shop or workshop, in study or theatre, all seek to spend and be spent for the
lovely all. --And I said, One thing tell me, sir--how much a man may have for the asking.--What
he will--that is, what he can well use.--Who then shall be the judge thereof?--Who but the
man himself?--What if he should turn to greed, and begin to hoard and spare?--Sawest thou not
the man this day because of whom all business ceased for a time?--to that man had come a thought
of accumulation instead of growth, and he dropped upon his knees in shame and terror. And thou
sawest how all business ceased, and straightway that of the shop was made what below they call
a church; for everyone hastened to the poor man's help, the air was filled with praying breath,
and the atmosphere of God-loving souls was around him; the foul thought fled, and the man went
forth glad and humble, and to-morrow he will return for that which he needeth. If thou shouldst
be present then, thou wilt see him more tenderly ministered unto than all the rest.--And if
such a man prayed not?--If such a man slept ere he repented, he would wake with hatred in his
heart towards the city and everyone therein, and would straightway flee into the wilderness.
And the angel of the Lord would go out after him, and smite him with a word, and he would vanish
from amongst us, and his life would be the life of one of those least of living things that
are in your world born of the water; and there must he grow up again, crawling through the
channels of thousand-folded difference, from animal to animal, until at length a human brain
be given him, and after generations he become once again capable of being born of the spirit
into the kingdom of liberty. Then shall all his past life open upon him, and in shame and dismay
will he repent a thousand-fold, and will sin no more. Such, at least, are thoughts of our wise
men upon the matter; but truly we know not.--It is good, I said. But how are men guided as
to what lies to them to provide for the general good?--Every man doeth what thing he can, and
the more his labour is desired, the more he rejoices.--If a man should desire that he could
no where find in the city?--Then would he straightway do his endeavour to provide that thing
for all in the city who might after him desire the same.--Now, sir, methinks I know and understand,
I answered. And we rose and went farther.'"

"I think that COULD be!" said the curate, breaking the silence that followed when Rachel ceased.

"Not in this world," said the draper.

"To doubt that it COULD be," said the gatekeeper, "would be to doubt whether the kingdom of
heaven is a chimera or a divine idea."

CHAPTER XXIX.

POLWARTH AND LINGARD.

The morning after Wingfold's second visit, Lingard, much to his sister's surprise, partly to
her pleasure, and somewhat to her consternation, asked for his clothes: he wanted to get up.
So little energy had he hitherto shown, so weak was he, and so frequent had been the symptoms
of returning fever, that the doctor had not yet thought of advising more than an hour's sitting
while his bed was made comfortable. And Helen had felt that she had him, if not safe, yet safer
in bed than he could be elsewhere.

His wish to rise was a sign that he was getting better. But could she wish him to get better,
seeing every hour threatened to be an hour of torture? On the other hand, she could not but
hope that, for the last day or so, his mind had been a little more at ease. Assuredly the light
in his eye was less troubled: perhaps he saw prospect of such mental quiet as might render
life endurable.

He declined assistance, and Helen, having got him everything he required, left the room to
wait within hearing. It took him a long time to dress, but he had resolved to do it himself,
and at length called Helen.

She found he looked worse in his clothes--fearfully worn and white! Ah, what a sad ghost he
was of his former sunny self! Helen turned her eyes from him, that he might not see how changed
she thought him, and there were the trees in the garden and the meadows and the park beyond,
bathing in the strength of the sun, betwixt the blue sky and the green earth! "What a hideous
world it is!" she said to herself. She was not yet persuaded, like her cousin, that it was
the best possible world--only that, unfortunately, not much was possible in worlds.

"Will you get me something, Helen," he said. "Mr. Wingfold will be here, and I want to be able
to talk to him."

It was the first time he had asked for food, though he had seldom refused to take what she
brought him. She made him lie on the couch, and gave orders that, if Mr. Wingfold called, he
should be shown up at once. Leopold's face brightened; he actually looked pleased when his
soup came. When Wingfold was announced, he grew for a moment radiant.

Helen received the curate respectfully, but not very cordially: SHE could not make Leopold's
face shine!

"Would your brother like to see Mr. Polwarth?" asked the curate rather abruptly.

"I will see anyone you would like me to see. Mr. Wingfold," answered Liugard for himself, with
a decision that clearly indicated returning strength.

"But, Leopold, you know it is hardly to be desired," suggested Helen, "that more persons--"

"I don't know that," interrupted Leopold with strange expression.

"Perhaps I had better tell you, Miss Lingard," said the curate, "that it was Mr. Polwarth who
found the thing I gave you. After your visit, he could not fail to put things together, and
had he been a common man, I should have judged it prudent to tell him for the sake of secrecy
what I have told him for the sake of counsel. I repeat in your brother's hearing what I have
said to you, that he is the wisest and best man I have ever known.--I left him in the meadow
at the foot of the garden. He is suffering to-day, and I wanted to save him the longer walk.
If you will allow me, I will go and bring him in."

"Do," said Leopold. "Think, Helen!--If he is the wisest and best man Mr. Wingfold ever knew!
Tell him where to find the key."

"I will go myself," she said--with a yielding to the inevitable.

When she opened the door, there was the little man seated a few yards off on the grass. He
had plucked a cowslip and was looking into it so intently that he neither heard nor saw her.

"Mr. Polwarth!" said Helen.

He lifted his eyes, rose, and taking off his hat, said with a smile,

"I was looking in the cowslip for the spots which the fairy, in the Midsummer Night's Dream,
calls 'rubies.'--How is your brother, Miss Lingard?"

Helen answered with cold politeness, and led the way up the garden with considerably more stateliness
of demeanour than was necessary.

When he followed her into the room, "This is Mr. Polwarth, Leopold," said the curate, rising
respectfully. "You may speak to him as freely as to me, and he is far more able to give you
counsel than I am."

"Would you mind shaking hands with me, Mr. Polwarth?" said Leopold, holding out his shadowy hand.

Polwarth took it with the kindest of smiles, and held it a moment in his.

"You think me an odd-looking creature--don't you?" he said; "but just because God made me so,
I have been compelled to think about things I might otherwise have forgotten, and that is why
Mr. Wingfold would have me come to see you."

The curate placed a chair for him, and the gate-keeper sat down. Helen seated herself a little
way off in the window, pretending, or hardly more, to hem a handkerchief. Leopold's big eyes
went wandering from one to the other of the two men.

"What a horrible world it is!" was the thought that kept humming on like an evil insect in
Helen's heart. "I am sorry to see you suffer so much," said Leopold kindly, for he heard the
laboured breath of the little man, and saw the heaving of his chest.

"It does not greatly trouble me," returned Polwarth. "It is not my fault, you see," he added
with a smile; "at least I don't think it is."

"You are happy to suffer without fault," said Leopold. "It is because it is just that my punishment
seems greater than I can bear."

"You need God's forgiveness in your soul."

"I don't see how that should do anything for me."

"I do not mean it would take away your suffering; but it would make you able to bear it. It
would be fresh life in you."

"I can't see why it should. I can't feel that I have wronged God. I have been trying to feel
it, Mr. Wingfold, ever since you talked to me. But I don't know God, and I only feel what I
have done to Emmeline. If I said to God, 'Pardon me,' and he said to me, 'I do pardon you,'
I should feel just the same. What could that do to set anything right that I have set wrong?
I am what I am, and what I ever shall be, and the injury which came from me, cleaves fast to
her, and is my wrong wherever she is."

He hid his face in his hands.

"What use CAN it be to torture the poor boy so?" said Helen to herself.

The two men sat silent. Then Polwarth said:

"I doubt if there is any use in trying to feel. And no amount of trying could enable you to
imagine what God's forgiveness is like to those that have it in them. Tell me something more
you do feel, Mr. Lingard."

"I feel that I could kill myself to bring her back to life."

"That is, you would gladly make amends for the wrong you have done her."

"I would give my life, my soul, to do it."

"And there is nothing you can do for it?"

Helen began to tremble.

"What is there that can be done?" answered Leopold. "It does seem hard that a man should be
made capable of doing things that he is not made capable of undoing again."

"It is indeed a terrible thought! And even the smallest wrong is, perhaps, too awful a thing
for created being ever to set right again."

"You mean it takes God to do that?"

"I do."

"I don't see how he ever could set some things right."

"He would not be God if he could not or would not do for his creature what that creature cannot
do for himself, and must have done for him or lose his life."

"Then he isn't God, for he can't help me."

"Because you don't see what can be done, you say God can do nothing--which is as much as to
say there cannot be more within his scope than there is within yours! One thing is clear, that,
if he saw no more than what lies within your ken, he could not be God. The very impossibility
you see in the thing points to the region wherein God works."

"I don't quite understand you. But it doesn't matter. It's all a horrible mess. I wish I was dead."

"My dear sir, is it reasonable that because a being so capable of going wrong finds himself
incapable of setting right, he should judge it useless to cry to that being who called him
into being to come to his aid?--and that in the face of the story--if it were but an old legend,
worn and disfigured--that he took upon himself our sins?"

Leopold hung his head.

"God needs no making up to him," the gate-keeper went on--"so far from it that he takes our
sins on himself, that he may clear them out of the universe. How could he say he took our sins
upon him, if he could not make amends for them to those they had hurt?"

"Ah!" cried Leopold, with a profound sigh, "--if that could be!--if he could really do that!"

"Why, of course he can do that!" said Polwarth. "What sort of watchmaker were he who could
not set right the watches and clocks himself made?"

"But the hearts of men and women!" "Which God does far more than make!" interposed Polwarth.
"That a being able to make another self-conscious being distinct from himself, should be able
also to set right whatever that being could set wrong, seems to me to follow of simple necessity.
He might even, should that be fit, put the man himself in the way of making up for what he
had done, or at least put it in his power to ask and receive a forgiveness that would set all
right between him and the person wronged. One of the painful things in the dogma of the endless
loss of the wicked is that it leaves no room for the righteous to make up to them for the wrongs
they did them in this life. For the righteous do the wicked far more wrong than they think--the
righteous being all the time, in reality, the wealthy, and the wicked the poor. But it is a
blessed word that there are first that shall be last, and last that shall be first."

Helen stared. This last sounded to her mere raving madness, and she thought how wrong she had
been to allow such fanatics to gain power over her poor Leopold--who sat before them whiter
than ever, and with what she took for a wilder gleam in his eye.

"Is there not the might of love, and all eternity for it to work in, to set things right?"
ended Polwarth.

"O God!" cried Leopold, "if that might be true! That would be a gift indeed--the power to make
up for the wrong I have done!"

He rose from the couch--slowly, sedately, I had almost said formally, like one with a settled
object, and stood erect, swaying a little from weakness.

"Mr. Wingfold," he said, "I want of you one more favour: will you take me to the nearest magistrate?
I wish to give myself up."

Helen started up and came forward, paler than the sick man.

"Mr. Wingfold! Mr. Polwarth!" she said, and turned from the one to the other, "the boy is not
himself. You will never allow him to do such a mad thing!"

"It may be the right thing," said the curate to Leopold, "but we must not act without consideration."

"I have considered and considered it for days--for weeks," returned Leopold; "but until this
moment I never had the courage to resolve on the plainest of duties.--Helen, if I were to go
up to the throne of God with the psalm in my mouth, and say to him, 'Against thee, thee only,
have I sinned,' it would be false; for I have sinned against every man, woman, and child in
England at least, and I will repudiate myself. To the throne of God I want to go, and there
is no way thither for me but through the gate of the law."

"Leopold!" pleaded Helen, as if for her own life with some hard judge, "what good can it do
to send another life after the one that is gone? It cannot bring it back, or heal a single
sorrow for its loss."

"Except perhaps my own," said Leopold, in a feeble voice, but not the less in a determined tone.

"Live till God send for you," persisted Helen, heedless of his words. "You can give your life
to make up for the wrong you have done in a thousand better ways: that would be but to throw
it in the dirt. There is so much good waiting to be done!"

Leopold sank on the couch.

"I am sitting down again, Helen, only because I am not able to stand," he said. "I WILL go.
Don't talk to me about doing good! Whatever I touched I should but smear with blood. I want
the responsibility of my own life taken off me. I am like the horrible creature Frankenstein
made--one that has no right to existence--and at the same time like the maker of it, who is
accountable for that existence. I am a blot on God's creation that must be wiped off. For this
my strength is given back to me, and I am once more able to will and resolve. You will find
I can act too. Helen, if you will indeed be my sister, you must NOT prevent me now. I know
it is hard upon you, awfully hard. I know I am dragging your life down with mine, but I cannot
help it. If I don't do it, I shall but go out of one madness into another, ever a deeper, until
the devils can't hold me. Mr. Polwarth, is it not my duty to give myself up? Ought not the
evil thing to be made manifest and swept out of the earth? Most people grant it a man's first
duty to take care of his life: that is the only thing I can do for mine. It is now a filthy
pool with a corpse in it:--I would clean it out--have the thing buried at least, though never
forgotten--never, never forgotten. Then I shall die and go to God and see what he can do for me."

"Why should you put it off till then?" said Polwarth. "Why not go to him at once and tell him all?"

As if it had been Samuel at the command of Eli, Leopold rose and crept feebly across the floor
to the dressing-room, entered it, and closed the door.

Then Helen turned upon Wingfold with a face white as linen, and eyes flashing with troubled
wrath. The tigress-mother swelled in her heart, and she looked like a Maenad indeed.

"Is this then your religion?" she cried with quivering nostril. "Would he you dare to call
your master have stolen into the house of a neighbour to play upon the weakness of a poor lad
suffering from brain-fever? A fine trophy of your persuasive power and priestly craft you would
make of him! What is it to you whether he confesses his sins or not? If he confesses them to
him you say is your God, is not that enough? For shame, gentlemen!"

She ceased, and stood trembling and flashing--a human thunder-cloud. Neither of the men cared
to assert innocence, because, although they had not advised the step, they entirely approved of it.

A moment more, and her anger suddenly went out. She burst into tears, and falling on her knees
before the curate, begged and prayed like a child condemned to some frightful punishment. It
was terrible to Wingfold to see a woman in such an agony of prayer--to one who would not grant
it--and that one himself. In vain he sought to raise her.

"If you do not save Leopold, I will kill myself," she cried, "and my blood will be on your head."

"The only way to save your brother is to strengthen him to do his duty, whatever that may be."

The hot fit of her mental fever returned. She sprang to her feet, and her face turned again
almost like that of a corpse with pale wrath.

"Leave the house!" she said, turning sharply upon Polwarth, who stood solemn and calm at Wingfold's
side, a step behind. It was wonderful what an unconscious dignity radiated from him.

"If my friend goes, I go too," said Wingfold. "But I must first tell your brother why."

He made a step towards the dressing-room.

But now came a fresh change of mood upon Helen. She darted between him and the door, and stood
there with such a look of humble entreaty as went to his very heart, and all but unmanned him.
Ah, how lovely she looked in the silent prayer of tears! But not even her tears could turn
Wingfold from what seemed his duty. They could only bring answering tears from the depth of
a tender heart. She saw he would not flinch.

"Then may God do to you as you have done to me and mine!" she said.

"Amen!" returned Wingfold and Polwarth together.

The door of the dressing-room opened, and out came Leopold, his white face shining.

"God has heard me!" he cried.

"How do you know that?" said his sister, in the hoarse accents of unbelieving despair.

"Because he has made me strong to do my duty. He has reminded me that another man may be accused
of my crime, and now to conceal myself were to double my baseness."

"It will be time enough to think of that when there is a necessity for it. The thing you imagine
may never happen," said Helen, in the same unnatural voice.

"Leave it," cried Leopold, "until an innocent man shall have suffered the torture and shame
of a false accusation, that a guilty man may a little longer act the hypocrite! No, Helen,
I have not fallen so low as that yet. Believe me, this is the only living hour I have had since
I did the deed!"

But as he spoke, the light died out of his face, and ere they could reach him he had fallen
heavily on the floor. 

Engineering had had the attribute, ne'er, absconder, setting. Yesterday, it. Beginning; state, of scrolls

 Now that
he understood more of the human heart, and recognised in this and that human countenance the
bars of a cage through which peeped an imprisoned life, his own heart burned in him with the
love of the helpless; and if there was mingled therein anything of the ambition of benefaction,
anything of the love of power, anything of self-recommendation, pride of influence, or desire
to be a centre of good, and rule in a small kingdom of the aided and aiding, these marshy growths
had the fairest chance of dying an obscure death; for the one sun, potent on the wheat for
life, and on the tares for death, is the face of Christ Jesus, and in that presence Wingfold
lived more and more from day to day.

And now came Helen, who, more than anyone whose history he had yet learned--more perhaps than
even her brother, needed such help as he confidently hoped he knew now where she might find!
But when he saw her stand before him wounded and tearful and proud, regarding his behaviour
in respect of her brother as cruel and heartless; when he felt in his very soul that she was
jealous of his influence, that she disliked and even despised him; it was only with a strong
effort he avoided assuming a manner correspondent to the idea of himself he saw reflected in
her mind, and submitting himself, as it were, to be what she judged him.

When, however, by a pure effort of will, he rose above this weakness and looked her full and
clear in the face, a new jealousy of himself arose: she stood there so lovely, so attractive,
so tenfold womanly in her misery, that he found he must keep a stern watch upon himself, lest
interest in her as a woman should trespass on the sphere of simple humanity, wherein with favouring
distinction is recognized neither Jew nor Greek, prince nor peasant--not even man or woman,
only the one human heart that can love and suffer. It aided him in this respect however, that
his inherent modesty caused him to look up to Helen as to a suffering goddess, noble, grand,
lovely, only ignorant of the one secret, of which he, haunting the steps of the Unbound Prometheus,
had learned a few syllables, broken yet potent, which he would fain, could he find how, communicate
in their potency to her. And besides, to help her now looking upon him from the distant height
of conscious superiority, he must persuade her to what she regarded as an unendurable degradation!
The circumstances assuredly protected him from any danger of offering her such expression of
sympathy as might not have been welcome to her.

It is true that the best help a woman can get is from a right man--equally true with its converse;
but let the man who ventures take heed. Unless he is able to counsel a woman to the hardest
thing that bears the name of duty, let him not dare give advice even to her asking.

Helen however had not come to ask advice of Wingfold. She was in no such mood. She was indeed
weary of a losing strife, and only for a glimmer of possible help from her cousin, saw ruin
inevitable before her. But this revival of hope in George had roused afresh her indignation
at the intrusion of Wingfold with what she chose to lay to his charge as unsought counsel.
At the same time, through all the indignation, terror, and dismay, something within her murmured
audibly enough that the curate and not her cousin was the guide who could lead her brother
where grew the herb of what peace might yet be had. It was therefore with a sense of bewilderment,
discord, and uncertainty, that she now entered the library.

Wingfold rose, made his obeisance, and advanced a step or two. He would not offer a hand that
might be unwelcome, and Helen did not offer hers. She bent her neck graciously, and motioned
him to be seated.

"I hope Mr. Lingard is not worse," he said.

Helen started. Had anything happened while she had been away from him?

"No. Why should he be worse?" she answered. "Have they told you anything?"

"I have heard nothing; only as I was not allowed to see him,--"

"I left him with Mr. Bascombe half an hour ago," she said, willing to escape the imputation
of having refused him admittance.

Wingfold gave an involuntary sigh.

"You do not think that gentleman's company desirable for my brother, I presume," she said with
a smile so lustreless that it seemed bitter.

"He won't do him any harm--at least I do not think you need fear it."

"Why not? No one in your profession can think his opinions harmless, and certainly he will
not suppress them."

"A man with such a weight on his soul as your brother carries, will not be ready to fancy it
lightened by having lumps of lead thrown upon it. An easy mind may take a shroud on its shoulders
for wings, but when trouble comes and it wants to fly, then it knows the difference. Leopold
will not be misled by Mr. Bascombe."

Helen grew paler. She would have him misled--so far as not to betray himself.

"I am far more afraid of your influence than of his," added the curate.

"What bad influence do you suppose me likely to exercise?" asked Helen, with a cold smile.

"The bad influence of wishing him to act upon your conscience instead of his own."

"Is my conscience then a worse one than Leopold's?" she asked, but as if she felt no interest
in the answer.

"It is not his, and that is enough. His own and no other can tell him what he ought to do."

"Why not leave him to it, then?" she said bitterly.

"That is what I want of you, Miss Lingard. I would have you fear to touch the life of the poor
youth."

"Touch his life! I would give him mine to save it. YOU counsel him to throw it away."

"Alas, what different meanings we put on the word! You call the few years he may have to live
in this world his life; while I--"

"While you count it the millions of which yon know nothing,--somewhere whence no one has ever
returned to bring any news!--a wretched life at best if it be such as you represent it."

"Pardon me, that is merely what you suppose I mean by the word. I do not mean that; I mean
something altogether different. When I spoke of his life, I thought nothing about here or there,
now or then. You will see what I mean if you think how the light came back to his eye and the
colour to his cheek the moment he had made up his mind to do what had long seemed his duty.
When I saw him again that light was still in his eyes, and a feeble hope looked out of every
feature. Existence, from a demon-haunted vapor, had begun to change to a morning of spring;
life, the life of conscious well-being, of law and order and peace, had begun to dawn in obedience
and self-renunciation; his resurrection was at hand. But you then, and now you and Mr. Bascombe,
would stop this resurrection; you would seat yourselves upon his gravestone to keep him down!--And
why?--Lest he, lest you, lest your family should be disgraced by letting him out of his grave
to tell the truth."

"Sir!" cried Helen, indignantly drawing herself to her full height and something more.

Wingfold took one step nearer to her.

"My calling is to speak the truth," he said: "and I am bound to warn you that you will never
be at peace in your own soul until you love your brother aright."

"Love my brother!" Helen almost screamed. "I would die for him."

"Then at least let your pride die for him," said Wingfold, not without indignation.

Helen left the room, and Wingfold the house.

She had hardly shut the door, and fallen again upon the bed, when she began to know in her
heart that the curate was right. But the more she knew it, the less would she confess it even
to herself: it was unendurable.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

A REVIEW.

The curate walked hurriedly home, and seated himself at his table, where yet lay his Greek
Testament open at the passage he had been pondering for his sermon. Alas! all he had then been
thinking with such fervour had vanished. He knew his inspiring text, but the rest was gone.
Worst of all, feeling was gone with thought, and was, for the time at least, beyond recall.
Righteous as his anger was, it had ruffled the mirror of his soul till it could no longer reflect
heavenly things. He rose, caught up his New Testament, and went to the church-yard. It was
a still place, and since the pains of a new birth had come upon him, he had often sought the
shelter of its calm. A few yards from the wall of the rectory garden stood an old yew-tree,
and a little nearer on one side was a small thicket of cypress; between these and the wall
was an ancient stone upon which he generally seated himself. It had already begun to be called
the curate's chair. Most imagined him drawn thither by a clerical love of gloom, but in that
case he could scarcely have had such delight in seeing the sky through the dark foliage of
the yew: he thought the parts so seen looked more divinely blue than any of the rest. He would
have admitted, however, that he found quiet, for the soul as well as the body, upon this edge
of the world, this brink of the gulf that swallowed the ever-pouring ever-vanishing Niagara
of human life. On the stone he now seated himself and fell a-musing.

What a change had come upon him--slow, indeed, yet how vast, since the night when he sat in
the same churchyard indignant and uneasy with the words of Bascombe like hot coals in his heart!
He had been made ashamed of himself who had never thought much of himself, but the more he
had lost of worthiness in his own eyes the more he had gained in worth. And the more his poor
satisfaction with himself had died out, the more the world had awaked around him. For it must
be remembered that a little conceit is no more to be endured than a great one, but must be
swept utterly away. Sky and wind and water and birds and trees said to him, "Forget thyself
and we will think of thee. Sing no more to thyself thy foolish songs of decay, and we will
all sing to thee of love and hope and faith and resurrection." Earth and air had grown full
of hints and sparkles and vital motions, as if between them and his soul an abiding community
of fundamental existence had manifested itself. He had never in the old days that were so near
and yet seemed so far behind him, consciously cared for the sunlight: now even the shadows
were marvellous in his eyes, and the glitter the golden weather-cock on the tower was like
a cry of the prophet Isaiah. High and alone in the clear blue air it swung, an endless warning
to him that veers with the wind of the world, the words of men, the summer breezes of their
praise, or the bitter blasts of their wintry blame; it was no longer to him a cock of the winds,
but a cock of the truth--a Peter-cock, that crew aloud in golden shine its rebuke of cowardice
and lying. Never before had he sought acquaintance with the flowers that came dreaming up out
of the earth in the woods and the lanes like a mist of loveliness, but the spring-time came
in his own soul, and then he knew the children of the spring. And as the joy of the reviving
world found its way into the throats of the birds, so did the spring in his reviving soul find
its way into the channels of thought and speech, and issue in utterance both rhythmic and melodious.--But
not in any, neither in all of these things lay the chief sign and embodiment of the change
he recognised in himself. It was this: that, whereas in former times the name Christ had been
to him little more than a dull theological symbol, the thought of him and of his thoughts was
now constantly with him; ever and anon some fresh light would break from the cloudy halo that
enwrapped his grandeur; ever was he growing more the Son of Man to his loving heart, ever more
the Son of God to his aspiring spirit. Testimony had merged almost in vision: he saw into,
and partly understood the perfection it presented: he looked upon the face of God and lived.
Oftener and oftener, as the days passed, did it seem as if the man were by his side, and at
times, in the stillness of the summer-eve, when he walked alone, it seemed almost, as thoughts
of revealing arose in his heart, that the Master himself was teaching him in spoken words.
What need now to rack his soul in following the dim-seen, ever evanishing paths of metaphysics!
he had but to obey the prophet of life, the man whose being and doing and teaching were blended
in one three-fold harmony, or rather, were the three-fold analysis of one white essence--he
had but to obey him, haunt his footsteps, and hearken after the sound of his spirit, and all
truth would in healthy process be unfolded in himself. What philosophy could carry him where
Jesus would carry his obedient friends--into his own peace, namely, far above all fear and
all hate, where his soul should breathe such a high atmosphere of strength at once and repose,
that he should love even his enemies, and that with no such love as condescendingly overlooks,
but with the real, hearty, and self-involved affection that would die to give them the true
life! Alas! how far was he from such perfection now--from such a martyrdom, lovely as endless,
in the consuming fire of God! And at the thought, he fell from the heights of his contemplation--but
was caught in the thicket of prayer.

By the time he reached his lodging, the glow had vanished, but the mood remained. He sat down
and wrote the first sketch of the following verses, then found that his sermon had again drawn
nigh, and was within the reach of his spiritual tentacles.

    Father, I cry to thee for bread,
        With hungered longing, eager prayer;
    Thou hear'st, and givest me instead
        More hunger and a half-despair.

    O Lord, how long? My days decline;
        My youth is lapped in memories old;
    I need not bread alone, but wine--
        See, cup and hand to thee I hold.

    And yet thou givest: thanks, O Lord,
        That still my heart with hunger faints!
    The day will come when at thy board
        I sit forgetting all my plaints.

    If rain must come and winds must blow,
        And I pore long o'er dim-seen chart,
    Yet, Lord, let not the hunger go,
        And keep the faintness at my heart.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

A SERMON TO LEOPOLD.

When the curate stood up to read, his eyes as of themselves sought Mrs. Ramshorn's pew. There
sat Helen, with a look that revealed, he thought, more of determination and less of suffering.
Her aunt was by her side, cold and glaring, an ecclesiastical puss, ready to spring upon any
small church-mouse that dared squeak in its own murine way. Bascombe was not visible, and that
was a relief. For an unbelieving face, whether the dull dining countenance of a mayor, or the
keen searching countenance of a barrister, is a sad bone in the throat of utterance, and has
to be of set will passed over, and, if that may be, forgotten. Wingfold tried hard to forget
Mrs. Ramshorn's, and one or two besides, and by the time he came to the sermon, thought of
nothing but human hearts, their agonies, and him who came to call them to him.

"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

"Was it then of the sinners first our Lord thought ere he came from the bosom of the Father?
Did the perfect will embrace in the all-atoning tenderness of the divine heart, the degraded,
disfigured, defiled, distorted thing, whose angel is too blind ever to see the face of its
Father? Through all the hideous filth of the charnel-house, which the passions had heaped upon
her, did the Word recognise the bound, wing-lamed, feather-draggled Psyche, panting in horriblest
torture? Did he have a desire to the work of his hands, the child of his father's heart, and
therefore, strong in compassion, speed to the painful rescue of hearts like his own? That purity
arid defilement should thus meet across all the great dividing gulf of law and morals! The
friend of publicans and sinners! Think: he was absolutely friendly with them! was not shocked
at them! held up no hands of dismay! Only they must do so no more.

"If he were to come again, visibly, now, which do you think would come crowding around him
in greater numbers--the respectable church-goers, or the people from the slums? I do not know.
I dare not judge. But the fact that the church draws so few of those that are despised, of
those whom Jesus drew and to whom most expressly he came, gives ground for question as to how
far the church is like her Lord. Certainly many a one would find the way to the feet of the
master, from whom the respectable church-goer, the pharisee of our time, and the priest who
stands on his profession, would draw back with disgust. And doubtless it would be in the religious
world that a man like Jesus, who, without a professional education, a craftsman by birth and
early training, uttered scarce a phrase endorsed by clerical use, or a word of the religious
cant of the day, but taught in simplest natural forms the eternal facts of faith and hope and
love, would meet with the chief and perhaps the only BITTER opponents of his doctrine and life.

"But did our Lord not call the righteous? Did he not call honest men about him--James and John
and Simon--sturdy fisher-folk, who faced the night and the storm, worked hard, fared roughly,
lived honestly, and led good cleanly lives with father and mother, or with wife and children?
I do not know that he said anything special to convince them that they were sinners before
he called them. But it is to be remarked that one of the first effects of his company upon
Simon Peter was, that the fisherman grew ashamed of himself, and while ashamed was yet possessed
with an impulse of openness and honesty no less than passionate. The pure man should not be
deceived as to what sort of company he was in! 'Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!'
I would I could clearly behold with my mind's eye what he then saw in Jesus that drew from
him that cry! fle knew him for the Messiah: what was the working of the carpenter upon the
fisherman that satisfied him of the fact? Would the miracle have done it but for the previous
talk from the boat to the people? I think not. Anyhow St. Peter judged himself among the sinners,
and we may be sure that if these fishers had been self-satisfied men, they would not have left
all and gone after him who called them. Still it would hardly seern that it was specially as
sinners that he did so. Again, did not men such as the Lord himself regarded as righteous come
to him--Nicodemus, Nathaniel, the young man who came running and kneeled to him, the scribe
who was not far from the kingdom, the centurion, in whom he found more faith than in any Jew,
he who had built a synagogue in Capernaum, and sculptured on its lintel the pot of manna? These
came to him, and we know he was ready to receive them. But he knew such would always come drawn
of the Father; they did not want much calling; they were not so much in his thoughts therefore;
he was not troubled about them; they were as the ninety and nine, the elder son at home, the
money in the purse. Doubtless they had much to learn, were not yet in the kingdom, but they
were crowding about its door. If I set it forth aright, I know not, but thus it looks to me.
And one thing I cannot forget--it meets me in the face--that some at least,--who knows if not
all?--of the purest of men have counted themselves the greatest sinners! Neither can I forget
that other saying of our Lord, a stumbling-block to many--our Lord was not so careful as perhaps
some would have had him, lest men should stumble at the truth--The first shall be last and
the last first. While our Lord spoke the words: The time cometh that whosoever killeth you
will think that he doeth God service, even then was Saul of Tarsus at the feet of Gamaliel,
preparing to do God that service; but like one born out of due time, after all the rest he
saw the Lord, and became the chief in labour and suffering. Thus the last became first. And
I bethink me that the beloved disciple, who leaned on the bosom of the Lord, who was bolder
to ask him than any--with the boldness of love, he whom the meek and lowly called a Son of
Thunder, was the last of all to rejoin the master in the mansions of his Father. Last or first--if
only we are with him! One thing is clear that in the order of the Lord's business, first came
sinners.

"Who that reflects can fail to see this at least, that a crime brings a man face to face with
the reality of things? He who knows himself a sinner--I do not mean as one of the race--the
most self-righteous man will allow that as a man he is a sinner--he to whom, in the words of
the communion service, the remembrance of his sins is grievous, and the burden of them intolerable,
knows in himself that he is a lost man. He can no more hold up his head among his kind; he
cannot look a woman or a child in the face; he cannot be left alone with the chaos of his thoughts,
and the monsters it momently breeds. The joys of his childhood, the delights of existence,
are gone from him. There dwells within him an ever present judgment and fiery indignation.
Such a man will start at the sound of pardon and peace, even as the camel of the desert at
the scent of water. Therefore surely is such a man nearer to the gate of the kingdom than he
against whom the world has never wagged a tongue, who never sinned against a social custom
even, and has as easy a conscience as the day he was born; but who knows so little of himself
that, while he thinks he is good enough, he carries within him the capacity and possibility
of every cardinal sin, waiting only the special and fitting temptation which, like the match
to the charged mine, shall set all in a roar! Of this danger he knows nothing, never dreams
of praying against it, takes his seat in his pew Sunday after Sunday with his family, nor ever
murmurs Lead us not into temptation with the least sense that temptation is a frightful thing,
but repeats and responds and listens in perfect self-satisfaction, doubting never that a world
made up of such as he must be a pleasant sight in the eyes of the Perfect. There are men who
will never see what they are capable or in danger of until they have committed some fearful
wrong. Nay there are some for whom even that is not enough; they must be found out by their
fellow-men, and scorned in the eyes of the world, before they can or will admit or comprehend
their own disgrace. And there are worse still than these.

"But a man may be oppressed by his sins, and hardly know what it is that oppresses him. There
is more of sin in our burdens than we are ourselves aware. It needs not that we should have
committed any grievous fault. Do we recognize in ourselves that which needs to be set right,
that of which we ought to be ashamed, something which, were we lifted above all worldly anxieties,
would yet keep us uneasy, dissatisfied, take the essential gladness out of the sunlight, make
the fair face of the earth indifferent to us, a trustful glance a discomposing look, and death
a darkness?--I say to the man who feels thus, whatever he may have done or left undone, he
is not so far from the kingdom of heaven but that he may enter thereinto if he will.

"And if there be here any soul withered up with dismay, torn with horrible wonder that he should
have done the deed which he yet hath done, to him I say--Flee from the self that hath sinned
and hide thee with Christ in God. Or if the words sound to thee as the words of some unknown
tongue, and I am to thee as one that beateth the air, I say instead--Call aloud in thy agony,
that, if there be a God, he may hear the voice of his child, and put forth his hand and lay
hold upon him, and rend from him the garment that clings and poisons and burns, squeeze the
black drop from his heart, and set him weeping like a summer rain. O blessed, holy, lovely
repentance to which the Son of Man, the very root and man of men, hath come to call us! Good
it is, and I know it. Come and repent with me, O heart wounded by thine own injustice and wrong,
and together we will seek the merciful. Think not about thy sin so as to make it either less
or greater in thine own eyes. Bring it to Jesus, and let him show thee how vile a thing it
is. And leave it to him to judge thee--sure that he will judge thee justly, extenuating nothing,
for he hath to cleanse thee utterly, and yet forgetting no smallest excuse that may cover the
amazement of thy guilt, or witness for thee that not with open eyes didst thou do the deed.
At the last he cried, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. For his enemies
the truth should be spoken, his first words when they had nailed him to the cross. But again
I say, let it be Christ that excuseth thee; he will do it to more purpose than thou, and will
not wrong thy soul by excusing thee a hair too much, or thy heart by excusing thee a hair too
little.

"I dreamed once that I had committed a terrible crime. Carried beyond myself by passion, I
knew not at the moment HOW evil was the thing I did. But I knew it was evil. And suddenly I
became aware, when it was too late, of the nature of that which I had done. The horror that
came with the knowledge was of the things that belong only to the secret soul. I was the same
man as before I did it, yet was I now a man of whom my former self could not have conceived
the possibility as dwelling within it. The former self seemed now by contrast lovely in purity,
yet out of that seeming purity this fearful, foul I of the present had just been born! The
face of my fellow-man was an avenging law, the face of a just enemy. Where, how, should the
frightful face be hidden? The conscious earth must take it into its wounded bosom, and that
before the all-seeing daylight should come. But it would come, and I should stand therein pointed
at by every ray that shot through the sunny atmosphere! "The agony was of its own kind, and
I have no word to tell what it was like. An evil odour and a sickening pain combined, might
be a symbol of the torture. As is in the nature of dreams, possibly I lay but a little second
on the rack, yet an age seemed shot through and through with the burning meshes of that crime,
while, cowering and terror-stricken, I tossed about the loathsome fact in my mind. I had DONE
it, and from the done there was no escape: it was for evermore a thing done.--Came a sudden
change: I awoke. The sun stained with glory the curtains of my room, and the light of light
darted keen as an arrow into my very soul. Glory to God! I was innocent! The stone was rolled
from my sepulchre. With the darkness whence it had sprung, the cloud of my crime went heaving
lurid away. I was a creature of the light and not of the dark. For me the sun shone and the
wind blew; for me the sea roared and the flowers sent up their odours. For me the earth had
nothing to hide. My guilt was wiped away; there was no red worm gnawing at my heart; I could
look my neighbour in the face, and the child of my friend might lay his hand in mine and not
be defiled! All day long the joy of that deliverance kept surging on in my soul.

"But something yet more precious, more lovely than such an awaking, will repentance be to the
sinner; for after all it was but a dream of the night from which that set me free, and the
spectre-deed that vanished had never had a place in the world of fact; while the horror from
which repentance delivers, is no dream, but a stubborn abiding reality. Again, the vanishing
vision leaves the man what he was before, still capable it may be of committing the crime from
which he is not altogether clean to whom in his sleep it was possible: repentance makes of
the man a new creature, one who has awaked from the sleep of sin to sleep that sleep no more.
The change in the one case is not for greatness comparable with that in the other. The sun
that awakes from the one sleep, is but the outward sun of our earthly life--a glorious indeed
and lovely thing, which yet even now is gathering a crust of darkness, blotting itself out
and vanishing: the sun that awakes a man from the sleep of death is the living Sun that casts
from his thought out into being that other sun, with the space wherein it holds planetary court--the
Father of lights, before whose shining in the inner world of truth eternal, even the deeds
of vice become as spectral dreams, and, with the night of godlessness that engendered them,
flee away.

"But a man may answer and say to me--'Thou art but borne on the wings of thine imagination.
The fact of the crime remains, let a man tear out his heart in repentance, and no awaking can
restore an innocence which is indeed lost.' I answer: The words thou speakest are in themselves
true, yet thy ignorance makes them false, Thou knowest not the power of God, nor what resurrection
from the dead means. What if, while it restored not thy former innocence, it brought thee a
purity by the side of whose white splendour and inward preciousness, the innocence thou hadst
lost was but a bauble, being but a thing that turned to dross in the first furnace of its temptation?
Innocence is indeed priceless--that innocence which God counteth innocence, but thine was a
flimsy show, a bit of polished and cherished glass--instead of which, if thou repentest, thou
shalt in thy jewel-box find a diamond. Is thy purity, O fair Psyche of the social world, upon
whose wings no spattering shower has yet cast an earthy stain, and who knowest not yet whether
there be any such thing as repentance or need of the same!--is thy purity to compare with the
purity of that heavenly Psyche, twice born, who even now in the twilight-slumbers of heaven,
dreams that she washes with her tears the feet of her Lord, and wipes them with the hairs of
her head? O bountiful God, who wilt give us back even our innocence tenfold! He can give an
awaking that leaves the past of the soul ten times farther behind than ever waking from sleep
left the dreams of the night.

"If the potency of that awaking lay in the inrush of a new billow of life, fresh from its original
source, carrying with it an enlargement of the whole nature and its every part, a glorification
of every faculty, every sense even, so that the man, forgetting nothing of his past or its
shame, should yet cry out in the joy of his second birth: 'Lo! I am a new man; I am no more
he who did that awful and evil thing, for I am no more capable of doing it! 'ye will wed me?''no,'she state.'but you may then come the repentance
and the Giver or the cubeb and then.'and for the snap they fume without

 Nor would he willingly lose the scars which record its outbreak, for they tell him
what he is without God, and set him ever looking to see that the door into the heavenly garden
stands wide for God to enter the house when it pleases him. And who can tell whether, in the
train of such an awaking, may not follow a thousand opportunities and means of making amends
to those whom he has injured? "Nor must I fail to remind the man who has committed no grievous
crime, that except he has repented of his evil self, and abjured all wrong, he is not safe
from any, even the worst offence. There was a time when I could not understand that he who
loved not his brother was a murderer: now I see it to be no figure of speech, but, in the realities
of man's moral and spiritual nature, an absolute simple fact. The murderer and the unloving
sit on the same bench before the judge of eternal truth. The man who loves not his brother,
I do not say is at this moment capable of killing him, but if the natural working of his unlove
be not checked, he will assuredly become capable of killing him. And are afield, the Queen had
been no no-show. Here do. André might not have been spoken about Friend; a Jew had always can be
sold it, the human lips. And, further still, there were Châteaux, where,
d. Bayonne? There is not one
in this congregation who has a right to cast a look of reproach at the worst felon who ever
sat in the prisoners' dock. I speak no hyperbole, but simple truth. We are very ready to draw
in our minds a distinction between respectable sins--human imperfections we call them, perhaps--and
disreputable vices, such as theft and murder; but there is no such distinction in fact. Many
a thief is a better man than many a clergyman, and miles nearer to the gate of the kingdom.
The heavenly order goes upon other principles than ours, and there are first that shall be
last, and last that shall be first. Only, at the root of all human bliss lies repentance. 

But i said't looking.'with her white figure, who with her brother at eyes, with the splendid lips

assure you i'm with the confusion ourselves. He
cannot bear that you should live on in such misery, such badness, such blackness of darkness.
He would give you again your life, the bliss of your being. He will not speak to you one word
of reproach, except indeed you should aim at justifying yourselves by accusing your neighbour.
He will leave it to those who cherish the same sins in their hearts to cast stones at you:
he who has no sin casts no stone. Heartily he loves you, heartily he hates the evil in you--so
heartily that he will even cast you into the fire to burn you clean. By making you clean he
will give you rest. If he upbraid, it will not be for past sin, but for the present little
faith, holding out to him an acorn-cup to fill. "it isn't half-way," she said well. "we'Mary there
