A very interesting book for the little ones. It presents vivid pictures of New England life,
and is fragrant and dewy with fresh breezes from the maple bush, the hillside, and the pasture
lands. The style is excellent, and the matter as sprightly and entertaining as it is simply
natural and morally improving.

     THE POET, AND OTHER POEMS. By ACHSA W. SPRAGUE.
     Boston: William White & Co., 158 Washington street. For sale by A.
     J. Davis, New York.

'Miss Sprague was chiefly known to the world as a trance lecturer under what claimed to be
spirit influence. Although speaking in the interest of a faith generally unpopular, and involved
in no slight degree in crudities, extravagance, and quackery, she was herself neither fool
nor fanatic. She was a true child of nature, direct and simple in her manners, and impatient
of the artificiality and formal etiquette of fashionable society.' These poems are characterized
by great case of style, flowing rhythm, earnestness in the cause of philanthropy, and frequently
contain high moral lessons. But it is somewhat strange that the poems of trance writers and
speakers, so often marked by exquisite, varied, and delicate chimes of ringing rhythm, of brilliant
words, of sparkling poetic dust blown from the pages of great writers, and drifting through
the world, should so seldom give us those great granite blocks of originality, which must constitute
the enduring base for the new era therein announced. Is there nothing new in the world beyond
the grave which they deem open to their vision? We ask this in no spirit of censure or cavil,
for we have no prejudice against the school of spiritualistic literature, save where it militates
against the faith in our Redeemer.
