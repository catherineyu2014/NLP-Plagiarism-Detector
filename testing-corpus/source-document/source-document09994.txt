Peter Paul Rubens was of a distinguished family at Antwerp; but his father being (says Pilkington)
under the necessity of quitting his country, to avoid the calamities attendant on a civil war,
retired for security to Cologne; and during his residence in that city Rubens was born, in
1577. The day of his nativity was the Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul; and thence he received
at the baptismal font the names of these apostles.

Having been absent from his native country eight years, he was summoned home by the repeated
illness of his mother; but, though he hastened with all speed, he did not reach Antwerp in
time to afford his beloved parent the consolations of his presence and affections. The loss
of her affected him deeply; and he intended, when he had arranged his private affairs, to go
and reside in Italy; but the Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella exerted their interest
to retain him in Flanders, and in their service. He consequently established himself at Antwerp,
where he married his first wife, Elizabeth Brants, and built a magnificent house, with a saloon
in form of a rotunda, which he enriched with antique statues, busts, vases, and pictures, by
the most celebrated masters; and here, surrounded by works of art, he carried, (says his biographer,)
into execution those numberless productions of his prolific and rich invention, which once
adorned his native country, but now are become the spoil of war, and the tokens of conquest
and ambition, shining with equal lustre among super-eminent productions of painting in the
gallery of the Louvre.

The whole of the paintings, except two, which adorn the gallery of the Luxembourg, were executed
at Antwerp, by Rubens, for Mary de Medici.

He died in the year 1640, at the age of 63; and was buried, with extraordinary pomp, in the
church of St. James, at Antwerp, under the altar of his private chapel, which he had previously
decorated with a very fine picture.

The Emperor Adrian and the Architect Apollodorus.--When Apollodorus was conversing with Trajan
on some plans of architecture, Adrian interfered, and gave an opinion, which the artist treated
with contempt. "Go," says he, "and paint gourds" (an amusement which Adrian was fond of), "for
you are very ignorant of the subject on which we are conversing." When Adrian became emperor,
the affront was remembered, and it prevented Apollodorus from being employed. Nor was the opinion
which Apollodorus gave with respect to the plans of a sumptuous temple of Venus forgotten:
viz.--upon seeing the statues sitting, as they were, in the temple (which, it seems, wanted
much of its due proportion in height), he said, "if the goddesses should ever attempt to stand
upon their feet, they would assuredly break their heads against the ceiling." Adrian, meanly
jealous and inexcusably revengeful, banished the architect, and having caused him to be accused
of various crimes, put him to death.

Juan Rufa said--"There are two classes of persons who are inconsolable, the rich on the point
of death, and women on the departure of their beauty." He said, on another occasion, "that
he who defined a compliment to be an agreeable falsehood, which serves as a net to catch dupes,
was not far short of the truth, since the greater part of compliments are expressions directly
at variance with internal conviction."
